<text>The Dairy Shorthorn is a British breed of dairy cattle. It derives from the Shorthorn cattle of Teesside, in the North Riding of Yorkshire and in Northumbria (now divided between County Durham and Northumberland) in north-eastern England. The Shorthorn was for this reason at first known as the Durham or Teeswater.

Selective breeding for a dairy type began in the late eighteenth century. This is known as the Dairy Shorthorn in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and South Africa, and as the Milking Shorthorn in Canada, New Zealand and the United States. The Illawarra Shorthorn of Australia is largely descended from the Dairy Shorthorn.

Worldwide, the conservation status of the Dairy Shorthorn, the Illawarra Shorthorn and the Milking Shorthorn is &quot;not at risk&quot;. In the United Kingdom the small remainder of the breed not affected by indiscriminate cross-breeding in the twentieth century is known as the Dairy Shorthorn (Original Population). It is critically endangered. Both it and the Northern Dairy Shorthorn are listed as &quot;priority&quot; – the highest category of risk – on the watchlist of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.

In the nineteenth century the Durham – as it was then usually known – was very extensively used for cross-breeding in many countries of the world; it has contributed to the development of more than forty different breeds.

== History ==

Short-horned cattle of good quality are documented on the Yorkshire estates of the Dukes and Earls of Northumberland in the late sixteenth century. The first significant attempts at selective breeding of these cattle were made by Charles and Robert Colling in County Durham, who based their work on that of Robert Bakewell of Dishley, in Leicestershire. The principal work of selection for dairy qualities in the Durham/Shorthorn was done in the early nineteenth century by Thomas Bates of Kirklevington (now in Stockton-on-Tees, North Yorkshire), building principally on stock bought from the Colling brothers. A herd-book for all types of Shorthorn cattle – the Coates Herd Book – was begun by George Coates in 1822, and initially listed 850 cows and 710 bulls; it was later taken over by the breed society, the Shorthorn Society of Great Britain and Ireland, which was formed in 1874. Thomas Bates&#x27;s herd was auctioned off piecemeal in 1850, which led to an expansion of interest in cattle of this type. For the next hundred years the Shorthorn held a dominant position in British agriculture: in 1937–1938, just before the outbreak of the Second World War, the number of Shorthorn bulls registered with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries was , not far from double the number of all registered bulls of other cattle breeds (). Breed numbers reached a peak in 1949, after which increasing competition from the Friesian caused them to decline rapidly. The number of registered bulls, already much lower than before the war at about 35% of the national total in 1949, fell to little over 10% in 1960. Separate sections for beef and dairy strains within the Shorthorn breed were created in 1958.

In 1969 the breed society approved a programme of cross-breeding of the Dairy Shorthorn with a variety of other European breeds. Initially these were the Danish Red, the Meuse-Rhine-Yssel, the Red Friesian, the Red Holstein and the Simmental; later, introgression from Angeln, Ayrshire, Norwegian Red and Swedish Red-and-White was also permitted, as was the use of any bull that the Society had approved. Animals with no more than 25% Shorthorn heritage could be registered in the Dairy Shorthorn herd-book. The programme led to the development of a new composite breed, the Blended Red-and-White Shorthorn. It also led to the virtual extinction of the Dairy Shorthorn: by about 2009 there fewer than 100 breeding cows, and by 2012 there were no more than 50; in that year six purebred calves were added to the herd-book. The remnants of the breed were renamed to Dairy Shorthorn (Original Population) It is a critically endangered breed; both it and the Northern Dairy Shorthorn are listed as &quot;priority&quot; – the highest category of risk – on the watchlist of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.

== In other countries ==

Shorthorns of both beef and dairy type were first exported to Maryland and Virginia in the United States in 1783. With further imports through the 1800s the breed spread across the whole country.

The first dairy cows imported into New Zealand were Shorthorns, when in 1814, they were shipped from New South Wales. Shorthorns were used as draught animals in bullock teams, were good milkers and provided good meat. Shorthorn herds were established by the early 1840s, and for a long time Shorthorns were New Zealand&#x27;s most popular cattle breed.

The breed has served as part of the foundation for other red dairy breeds, including Swedish Red cattle, Angeln cattle and Illawarra cattle in Australia (with some Ayrshire ancestry). The Ayrshire cattle breed was originally formed from dairy-type Shorthorn cattle in Scotland.

The Milking/Dairy Shorthorn breed has seen population growth in several countries in the past decade after many years of population decline. The Canadian Milking Shorthorn Society had their highest registration and membership totals in over 25 years in 2012. All major populations have seen an increase in interest in Milking Shorthorns by dairy producers, artificial insemination organisations, and crossbreeders.

== Characteristics ==

The Dairy Shorthorn is an average-sized breed, with mature cows averaging tall at the tailhead, and weighing . They are red, red with white markings, white, or roan. Red and white coat colour genes in purebred Milking Shorthorns are co-dominant, resulting in the roan coloration and unique colour patterns seen in the breed. Average milk production for the breed is about in an annual lactation of 305 days, with 3.8% butterfat and 3.3% protein.

Milking/Dairy Shorthorn cattle are also known for high levels of fertility, grazing efficiency, and ease of management that result in the breed being highly suitable for low-input dairy operations in various production environments. Milking Shorthorns are known for their durability, longevity, and ease of calving as well as their versatility in a number of production environments.

=== Original strains ===
There are small groups of Milking/Dairy Shorthorns that have not been affected by cross-breeding and so remain true to the conformation and production levels of Shorthorns from the early twentieth century. These include the Dairy Shorthorn population in Australia, the Native Milking Shorthorns of the United States and the Dairy Shorthorn (Original Population) in the United Kingdom. In some countries, these animals may be known as Dual Purpose Shorthorns.

<text>The Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal is a military award of the United States Marine Corps. It was established on 8 May 1919 as the &quot;Marine Corps Expeditionary Ribbon&quot;. A full-sized medal was authorized on 1 March 1921. The Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal is therefore one of the oldest medals of the United States military which is still issued to active duty personnel.

==Award criteria==

To be awarded the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, a Marine must have engaged in a landing on foreign territory, participated in combat operations against an opposing force, or participated in a designated operation for which no other service medal is authorized. After 1961, some commands permitted eligible personnel to choose between the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, or the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, depending on the nature of the operation in question.

==Design==
In 1919, the Corps established the Expeditionary Ribbon to recognize &quot;limited service against an opposing force.&quot; Two years later, in 1921, the ribbon became the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal (MCEM). The medal was designed by Walker Hancock and features a 1920s-era Marine in full combat gear, advancing with one foot in the water and one foot on land, bayonet at the ready, with the word &quot;Expeditions&quot;. On the reverse of both the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal and Navy Expeditionary Medal, in the center of the bronze medallion an eagle is shown alight upon an anchor; the eagle is facing to the left and the flukes of the anchor are to the right. The eagle is grasping sprigs of laurel, which extend beyond the anchor in both directions. Above the eagle are the words UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS or UNITED STATES NAVY presented as an arch. Above the laurel are the words FOR SERVICE presented horizontally. The eagle is the American bald eagle and represents the United States, the anchor alludes to Marine Corps or Navy service, and the laurel is symbolic of victory and achievement.

Subsequent awards of the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal were originally denoted by award numerals. After 1921, multiple awards were denoted by bronze service stars. The Fleet Marine Force Combat Operation Insignia is also authorized for navy personnel who were on duty with and attached to a Marine Corps unit that participated in combat. The Wake Island Device is authorized for any personnel who were awarded the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal as part of the defense of Wake Island during the opening days of World War II.

<text>Iphigenia in Tauris (, &quot;Iphigeneia en Taurois&quot;) is a drama by the playwright Euripides, written between 414 BC and 412 BC. It has much in common with another of Euripides&#x27;s plays, &quot;Helen&quot;, as well as the lost play &quot;Andromeda&quot;, and is often described as a romance, a melodrama, a tragi-comedy or an escape play.

Although the play is generally known in English as &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot;, this is, strictly speaking, the Latin title of the play (corresponding to the Greek Ἰφιγένεια ἐν Ταύροις), the meaning of which is Iphigenia among the Taurians. There is no such place as &quot;Tauris&quot; in Euripides&#x27; play, although Goethe, in his play &quot;Iphigenie auf Tauris&quot; ironically utilising this translation error, posits such a place. The name refers to the Crimean Peninsula (ancient &quot;Taurikḗ&quot;).

==Background==

Years before the time period covered by the play, the young princess Iphigenia narrowly avoided death by sacrifice at the hands of her father, Agamemnon. (See plot of &quot;Iphigenia at Aulis&quot;.) At the last moment the goddess Artemis, to whom the sacrifice was to be made, intervened and replaced Iphigenia on the altar with a deer, saving the girl and sweeping her off to the land of the Taurians. She has since been made a priestess at the temple of Artemis in Taurica, a position in which she has the gruesome task of ritually sacrificing foreigners who land on King Thoas&#x27;s shores.

Iphigenia hates her forced religious servitude and is desperate to contact her family in Greece. She wants to inform them that, thanks to the miraculous swap performed by Artemis, she is still alive and wants to return to her homeland, leaving the role of high priestess to someone else. Furthermore, she has had a prophetic dream about her younger brother Orestes and believes that he is dead.

Meanwhile, Orestes has killed his mother Clytemnestra to avenge his father Agamemnon with assistance from his friend Pylades. He becomes haunted by the Erinyes for committing the crime and goes through periodic fits of madness. He is told by Apollo to go to Athens to be brought to trial (as portrayed in &quot;Eumenides&quot; by Aeschylus). Although the trial ends in his favour, the Erinyes continue to haunt him. Apollo sends him to steal a sacred statue of Artemis to bring back to Athens so that he may be set free.

==Plot==
The scene represents the front of the temple of Artemis in the land of the Taurians (presently, the Crimean peninsula). The altar is in the center.

The play begins with Iphigenia reflecting on her brother&#x27;s death. She recounts her &quot;sacrifice&quot; at the hands of Agamemnon, and how she was saved by Artemis and made priestess in this temple. She has had a dream in which the structure of her family&#x27;s house crashed down in ruins, leaving only a single column which she then washed clean as if preparing it for ritual sacrifice. She interprets this dream to mean that Orestes is dead.

Orestes and Pylades enter, having just arrived in this land. Orestes was sent by Apollo to retrieve the image of Artemis from the temple, and Pylades has accompanied him. Orestes explains that he has avenged Agamemnon&#x27;s death by killing Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus. The two decide to hide and make a plan to retrieve the idol without being captured. They know that the Taurians sacrifice Hellene blood in their temple of Artemis. Orestes and Pylades exit. Iphigenia enters and discusses her sad life with the chorus, composed of captive Greek maidens, attendants of Iphigenia. She believes that her father&#x27;s bloodline has ended with the death of Orestes.

A herdsman enters and explains to Iphigenia that he has captured two Hellenes and that Iphigenia should make ready the lustral water and the rites of consecration. The herdsman heard one called Pylades by the other, but did not hear the name of the other. Iphigenia tells the herdsmen to bring the strangers to the temple, and says that she will prepare to sacrifice them. The herdsman leaves to fetch the strangers. Iphigenia explains that she was tricked into going to Aulis, through the treachery of Odysseus. She was told that she was being married to Achilles, but upon arriving in Aulis, she discovered that she was going to be sacrificed by Agamemnon. Now, she presides over the sacrifices of any Hellene trespassers in the land of the Taurians, to avenge the crimes against her.
Orestes and Pylades enter in bonds. Iphigenia demands that the prisoners&#x27; bonds be loosened, because they are hallowed. The attendants to Iphigenia leave to prepare for the sacrifice. Iphigenia asks Orestes his origins, but Orestes refuses to tell Iphigenia his name. Iphigenia finds out which of the two is Pylades and that they are from Argos. Iphigenia asks Orestes many questions, especially of Greeks who fought in Troy. She asks if Helen has returned home to the house of Menelaus, and of the fates of Calchas, Odysseus, Achilles, and Agamemnon. Orestes informs Iphigenia that Agamemnon is dead, but that his son lives. Upon hearing this, Iphigenia decides that she wants one of the strangers to return a letter to Argos, and that she will only sacrifice one of them. Orestes demands that he be sacrificed, and that Pylades be sent home with the letter, because Orestes brought Pylades on this trip, and it would not be right for Pylades to die while Orestes lives.

Pylades promises to deliver the letter unless his boat is shipwrecked and the letter is lost. Iphigenia then recites the letter to Pylades so that, if it is lost, he can still relay the message. She recites:
&quot;She that was sacrificed in Aulis send this message, Iphigenia, still alive, though dead to those at Argos. Fetch me back to Argos, my brother, before I die. Rescue me from this barbarian land, free me from this slaughterous priesthood, in which it is my office to kill strangers. Else I shall become a curse upon your house, Orestes. Goddess Artemis saved me and substituted a deer, which my father sacrificed believing he was thrusting the sharp blade into me. Then she brought me to stay in this land.&quot; 
During this recitation, Orestes asks Pylades what he should do, having realized that he was standing in front of his sister.

Orestes reveals his identity to Iphigenia, who demands proof. First, Orestes recounts how Iphigenia embroidered the scene of the quarrel between Atreus and Thyestes on a fine web. Orestes also spoke of Pelops’ ancient spear, which he brandished in his hands when he killed Oenomaus and won Hippodamia, the maid of Pisa, which was hidden away in Iphigenia&#x27;s maiden chamber. This is evidence enough for Iphigenia, who embraces Orestes. Orestes explains that he has come to this land by the bidding of Phoebus&#x27;s oracle, and that if he is successful, he might finally be free of the haunting Erinyes.
Orestes, Pylades, and Iphigenia plan an escape whereby Iphigenia will claim that the strangers need to be cleansed in order to be sacrificed and will take them to the bay where their ship is anchored. Additionally, Iphigenia will bring the statue that Orestes was sent to retrieve. Orestes and Pylades exit into the temple. Thoas, king of the Taurians, enters and asks whether or not the first rites have been performed over the strangers. Iphigenia has just retrieved the statue from the temple and explains that when the strangers were brought in front of the statue, the statue turned and closed its eyes. Iphigenia interprets it thus to Thoas: The strangers arrived with the blood of kin on their hands and they must be cleansed. Also, the statue must be cleansed. Iphigenia explains that she would like to clean the strangers and the statue in the sea, to make for a purer sacrifice. Thoas agrees that this must be done, and suspects nothing. Iphigenia tells Thoas that he must remain at the temple and cleanse the hall with torches, and that she may take a long time. All three exit the stage.

A messenger enters, shouting that the strangers have escaped. Thoas enters from the temple, asking what all the noise is about. The messenger explains Iphigenia&#x27;s lies and that the strangers fought some of the natives, then escaped on their Hellene ship with the priestess and the statue. Thoas calls upon the citizens of his land to run along the shore and catch the ship. Athena enters and explains to Thoas that he shouldn&#x27;t be angry. She addresses Iphigenia, telling her to be priestess at the sacred terraces of Brauron, and she tells Orestes that she is saving him again. Thoas heeds Athena&#x27;s words, because whoever hears the words of the gods and heeds them not is out of his mind.

==Date==

The exact date of &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot; is unknown. Metrical analysis by Zielinski indicated a date between 414 and 413 BCE, but later analysis by Martin Cropp and Gordon Fick using more sophisticated statistical techniques indicated a wider range of 416 to 412 BCE. The plot of &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot; is similar to that of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Helen&quot; and &quot;Andromeda&quot;, both of which are known to have been first performed in 412. This has often been taken as a reason to reject 412 as the date for &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot;, since that would mean three similar plays would have been performed in the same trilogy. However, Matthew Wright believes the plot and other stylistic similarities between the three plays indicates that they most likely were produced as part of the same trilogy in 412. Among Wright&#x27;s reasons are the fact that although the plots are similar they are not identical, and that this type of escape plot may have been particularly relevant in 412 at the first Dionysia after Athens&#x27; failed Sicilian Expedition. Also, other than this play and the two plays known to date to 412, we do not know of any such escape plays by Euripides; if he produced two that year, why not three, which might make a particularly strong impression if the escape theme was one Euripides wished to emphasize that year. Finally, Aristophanes overtly parodied &quot;Helen&quot; and &quot;Andromeda&quot; in his comedy &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot;, produced in 411, and Wright sees a more subtle parody of &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot; in the final escape plan attempted in &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot; as well.

<text>The Brown Swiss or American Brown Swiss is an American breed of dairy cattle. It derives from the traditional triple-purpose Braunvieh (&quot;Swiss Brown&quot;) of the Alpine region of Europe, but has diverged substantially from it. It was selectively bred for dairy qualities only, and its draft and beef capabilities were lost. Milk yield was measured in 2013 at per year; the milk has about 4% butterfat and 3.5% protein and is suitable for making cheese.

In the twentieth century the Brown Swiss became a world breed, with a global population estimated in 1990 at seven million head. It has been much used for cross-breeding and has influenced a number of modern breeds.

In English &quot;Swiss Brown&quot; refers to the original Braunvieh breed, as opposed to &quot;Brown Swiss&quot; for the American breed. 

== History ==

The Braunvieh is a traditional breed of triple-purpose cattle from the Alpine region, particularly Switzerland; at was reared as a draft beast, for its milk and for its meat. The Braunvieh was first imported to the United States in 1869, when seven cows and a bull were shipped to one Henry M. Clark in Belmont, Massachusetts. Between then and 1906, when cattle imports to the United States were banned because of fear of disease, many more were imported, sometimes by immigrants arriving from Europe. The American Brown Swiss descends from a total of 167 imported parent animals. A breed society, the Brown Swiss Cattle Breeders&#x27; Association, was formed in 1880; the first herd-book dates from 1889. By the end of the century breeding was directed towards dairy qualities; a production register for cows was opened in 1911. From about 1940 the breed became more diffused across the United States. In the mid-twentieth century, intensive selective breeding for dairy characteristics and excessive inbreeding led to a loss of genetic diversity, and also to an increase in transmissible genetic defects such as the recessive factors for bovine progressive degenerative myeloencephalopathy (&quot;weaver disease&quot;) and spinal muscular atrophy, both of which have a high percentage of carriers in the Brown Swiss (2.6% and 9.2% respectively).

The Brown Swiss was exported – either on the hoof or in the form of embryos or semen – to many countries of the world. It has been much used for cross-breeding, notably with many of the original Alpine breeds of brown cattle in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. In 1990 the global population was estimated to be approximately seven million head.

== Characteristics ==

The American Brown Swiss is of medium size. The coat is usually a light grayish brown, but varies from almost white to gray or dark brown. There may be some shading in the coat, with the forequarters often darker than the legs and hind parts. The muzzle is black, ringed with creamy white.

== Use ==

The milk of the Brown Swiss is unique, having longer-chain fatty acids than other popular dairy breeds and smaller fat globules in the cream; this difference means that cream rises much more slowly in milk from Brown Swiss cows. This difference, and the ratio of protein to fat in the milk, is ideal for cheesemaking.

<text>Francis Bowen ( ; September 8, 1811 – January 22, 1890) was an American philosopher, writer, and educationalist.

==Biography==
He was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts. He was educated at Mayhew School, Boston, Phillips Exeter Academy, and Harvard University, graduating from the latter in 1833. While attending Harvard, he taught school at Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, and Concord, Lexington and Northborough, Massachusetts. After graduating from Harvard, he taught for two years at Phillips Exeter Academy, returning to Harvard from 1835 to 1839 to tutor in Greek and teach intellectual philosophy and political economy. In 1839 he went to Europe, and, while living in Paris, met Sismondi, de Gerando, and other scholars. He returned to Cambridge in 1841 and devoted himself to literature. He was editor and proprietor of the &quot;North American Review&quot; from 1843 to 1854, writing, during this time, about one fourth of the articles in it. In 1848 and 1849, he delivered lectures before the Lowell Institute on the application of metaphysical and ethical science to the evidences of religion.

In 1850 he was appointed McLean professor of history at Harvard, but his appointment was disapproved by the board of overseers on account of political opinions he had expressed concerning the Hungarian revolution of 1848. Bowen had written two articles on Hungary for his &quot;North American Review&quot;:
&quot;The War of Races in Hungary&quot; (January 1850) and &quot;The Rebellion of the Slavonic, Wallachian, and German Hungarians against the Magyars&quot; (January 1851). 
Robert Carter wrote a series of articles for the Boston &quot;Atlas&quot; in reply. These articles, republished in a pamphlet as &quot;The Hungarian Controversy&quot; (Boston, 1852), are said to have been the cause of the rejection by the overseers of Bowen&#x27;s appointment.

In the winter of 1850, Bowen lectured again before the Lowell Institute on political economy, and in 1852 on the origin and development of the English and American constitutions. In 1853, on the election of James Walker to the presidency of Harvard, Bowen was appointed his successor as Alford professor of natural religion, moral philosophy and civil polity. This time the appointment was approved almost unanimously by the overseers, and he occupied the chair until 1889. After 1858, he lectured before the Lowell Institute on the English metaphysicians and philosophers from Francis Bacon to Sir William Hamilton.

In 1876 he was a member of the United States Silver Commission which was appointed to consider currency reform. In 1877, he wrote the minority report in which he opposed the restoration of the double standard and the remonetization of silver. In 1888, he was asked to endorse the Republican Party&#x27;s tariff platform, but replied by publishing an article (&quot;Nation&quot;, November 8, 1888) denouncing the current tariff as tyranny.

In philosophy and metaphysics, Bowen upheld the views of George Berkeley and John Locke and opposed those of Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Victor Cousin, Auguste Comte, and John Stuart Mill. The latter replied to his criticism in the 3rd edition of his &quot;Logic&quot;. In political economy, Bowen opposed the doctrines of Adam Smith on free trade, Thomas Malthus on population, and David Ricardo on rent. He took pains to trace the influence of our form of government and condition of society upon economical questions. A significant philosophical interest was harmonizing philosophy with Christianity. Piety marked his writing and teaching.

According to Quinton the philosophers C. S. Peirce, William James, and their early associate Chauncey Wright were all Bowen’s pupils.

He died in Boston, Massachusetts.

<text>Alphonse &quot;Al&quot; Bundy is a fictional character and the protagonist of the American television series &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, played by Ed O&#x27;Neill. He is a misanthropic, working-class father of two who is portrayed as a tragicomedic figure. He laments his lot in life, but nevertheless stands by his family, displaying wit, self-sacrifice, and resilience in times of crisis.

He and his wife Peggy were rated the 59th best characters on television by Bravo. In a 2016 interview, O&#x27;Neill said that he based his interpretation of Al Bundy on one of his uncles.

== Character background ==

Alphonse &quot;Al&quot; Bundy was born on November 7, 1948, in Chicago, Illinois. Al&#x27;s mother may have been an alcoholic: as shown in flashback sequences, he recalls a moment when his mother tells him that he can become anything and then, in real-time, remarks &quot;Yeah right, Mom, try saying that when you&#x27;re sober!&quot;. He was a star fullback on the Polk High School Football team and was offered a scholarship to play college football. However, a broken leg and his subsequent marriage to high-school sweetheart Peggy Wanker while intoxicated changed his fortunes.

Al and Peggy live in Chicago and have two children: Kelly (Christina Applegate), a promiscuous, dim-witted blonde, and Bud (David Faustino), an intelligent but sex-obsessed and unpopular schemer named after Budweiser beer. Al works as a shoe salesman at the fictional Gary&#x27;s Shoes and Accessories for Today&#x27;s Woman in the fictional New Market Mall. He loses or quits the job several times throughout the series, yet always ends up re-hired.

Al has a sarcastic and cynical sense of humor, and he frequently makes sardonic observations. He is also often criticized by Peggy for his poor hygiene. Allegedly, Al showers and brushes his teeth as rarely as he has sex, which is extremely infrequent, as he continually avoids Peggy&#x27;s advances.

== Relationships with others==

Despite his criticism of and seeming antipathy for his family he does sometimes display great affection for them. Examples can be seen on the rare occasions when he obtains money enabling him to enjoy luxuries. In one episode, Peggy and Al receive free first class plane tickets to New York City and they are shown sipping champagne together and singing &quot;I Got You, Babe&quot;. In another episode, Al&#x27;s car goes missing and the only reason he wants it back is to recover a mysterious item in the trunk, which turns out to be a family photo of Al, Peggy, Kelly, and Bud together, suggesting his distaste for them is spawned merely by his dissatisfaction with his extremely poor quality of life. Al is protective of Kelly, who he refers to by the term of endearment &quot;Pumpkin.” He regularly insults and often physically assaults her dates (who are usually trying to take advantage of her) and throws them bodily from the house.

Al is detested by most of his neighbors, except for Steve Rhoades and Jefferson D&#x27;Arcy; both are, at different times, married to Marcy who is Al&#x27;s arch-nemesis. In &quot;Route 666&quot;, Marcy said that, when the neighborhood thought Al had died, they all started dancing and singing &quot;Ding dong, the shoe man&#x27;s dead&quot; and called it a &quot;cruel, cruel hoax&quot; when they learned that Al had survived his latest misadventure. In another example of the neighborhood&#x27;s distaste of Al during &quot;You Better Shop Around&quot;, after he caused a city-wide blackout during a heatwave, the neighbors show up at his house with pitchforks and torches. Other people barely acknowledge that he exists and, as a result, his name often ends up misspelled on paychecks, reserved parking spots, etc. (e.g., &quot;Bumby&quot;, &quot;Boondy&quot; or &quot;Birdy&quot;).

Politically, Al appears to have mixed views; various episodes depict him mocking Rush Limbaugh, whereas others show him as a committed fan of conservative icon John Wayne. He is an ardent admirer of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He continually battles with Marcy, a staunch feminist, and even forms a misogynist group named &quot;No Ma&#x27;am&quot;. His views on economic issues display a left-leaning populist disdain for the wealthy, including leading a violent protest against a proposed law that would tax beer, but not wine.

Al cannot stop himself from uttering insulting one-liners to obese women, a behavior he has compulsively engaged in since he was a child.

== Income ==

Throughout the series, Al is continually saddled with massive debts caused by everything from the various failed schemes he becomes involved in to his wife&#x27;s extravagant spending habits. However, he never appears to miss a mortgage payment or file for bankruptcy. According to family lore, the &quot;Bundy Will&quot; (a document perpetuating these debts rather than bestowing an inheritance) is passed down from generation to generation as a punishment after Al&#x27;s ancestor, Seamus McBundy, insulted an obese witch who then cursed the family. Peggy often jokes that Al makes minimum wage and his poor financial outlook is frequently mocked and employed as comedy. In one episode, Al is offered early retirement and given a year&#x27;s pay: $12,000, yet in another episode he says that after taxes and Peggy&#x27;s profligate spending he only gets one nickel out of every paycheck. In &quot;My Mom, The Mom&quot;, Al states he earns a 10% commission on each sale. In &quot;Weenie Tot Lovers and Other Strangers&quot;, Peg states his paycheck was for &quot;80 pesos&quot;. The family also obtained money by appearing on game-shows, engaging in theft, participating in various absurd schemes, and mooching off of the Rhoades/D&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s wealth.

== &quot;The Dodge&quot; ==

Al owns a 1970s Dodge automobile. The car is only ever referred to as &quot;The Dodge&quot;, but the model occasionally shown is (alternately) a harvest gold or blue Plymouth Duster. Bud once described Al&#x27;s Dodge as being assembled from various parts of many different wrecked and derelict Dodges. It is depicted as hopelessly unreliable and Al is often shown pushing the broken-down car into the garage. In one episode, Al is offered a brand-new Dodge Viper, as his old car is about to turn one million miles and the car company wants to film the event. His actions cause the car to turn the millionth mile before Dodge can film it and they refuse to honor the deal.

== Running gags ==

Most of the show&#x27;s running gags concern Al. The constantly unlucky Al maintains a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; attitude whenever something in the house needs repair. When he combines his creativity with his poor judgment and lack of skill, the results are usually absurd and result in property damage and/or physical injury to Al. He has survived incredible injuries resulting from repeatedly falling off his roof while installing a satellite dish and getting shocked by the same dish, to being crushed by a massive woman wrestler (Big Bad Mama from Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling), to jumping from an airplane without a parachute. He even survived a huge explosion when he dynamited his own yard trying to kill a rabbit who was eating his vegetable garden. (The rabbit survives unscathed.)

He is often seen leaving restrooms, even public ones, with a newspaper tucked under his arm, to the sound of a toilet flushing. 

Al loves bowling, and &quot;nudie&quot; bars and regularly comments on both. His favorite magazine is the pornographic &quot;Big&#x27;uns&quot;. He enjoys watching sports on television with his right hand tucked into his waistband (he switches to his left hand on Sundays), and his favorite sitcom is the fictional &quot;Psycho Dad&quot;, which he always mentions.

Al&#x27;s greatest life achievement was scoring four touchdowns in a single game while playing in the 1966 city football championship game versus fictional Andrew Johnson High School, and he constantly makes reference to it in comparison to the way his life has turned out instead. The episode, &quot;Damn Bundys&quot;, featured Al selling his soul to the devil (Robert Englund) in order to lead the Chicago Bears to the Super Bowl as the oldest rookie in NFL history; Al scores the touchdown and ends up in hell with his family and neighbors for 300 years. In the Season 10 episode &quot;Dud Bowl II&quot;, a scoreboard at Polk High&#x27;s football stadium was to be dedicated to Al, but Marcy arranged for it to instead be named after Terry Bradshaw out of malice; after Kelly convinces Bradshaw to let the scoreboard to be named after Al, Al (unaware of this) arranges for Jefferson and Bud to destroy the scoreboard.

Al does have some talents, which are frequently referenced. He is an extremely gifted bowler and he always appears to win fistfights.

== Reception ==
Al Bundy had a highly positive reception. Much of the praise went to O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s portrayal of the character. Al and Peg were named the 59th best TV characters by Bravo.

In 2009, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him among the 10 most memorable fathers in television history. In 2014, BuzzFeed listed Al Bundy as the 10th greatest TV dad of all time.

<doc id="969684" wikidata="Q209542" url="?curid=969684" title="Herd">
<text>A herd is a social group of certain animals of the same species, either wild or domestic. The form of collective animal behavior associated with this is called &quot;herding&quot;. These animals are known as gregarious animals.

The term &quot;herd&quot; is generally applied to mammals, and most particularly to the grazing ungulates that classically display this behaviour. Different terms are used for similar groupings in other species; in the case of birds, for example, the word is &quot;flocking&quot;, but &quot;flock&quot; may also be used for mammals, particularly sheep or goats. Large groups of carnivores are usually called &quot;packs&quot;, and in nature a herd is classically subject to predation from pack hunters.

Special collective nouns may be used for particular taxa (for example a flock of geese, if not in flight, is sometimes called a &quot;gaggle&quot;) but for theoretical discussions of behavioural ecology, the generic term &quot;herd&quot; can be used for all such kinds of assemblage.

The word &quot;herd&quot;, as a noun, can also refer to one who controls, possesses and has care for such groups of animals when they are domesticated. Examples of herds in this sense include shepherds (who tend to sheep), goatherds (who tend to goats), and cowherds (who tend to cattle).

==The structure and size of herds==
When an association of animals (or, by extension, people) is described as a herd, the implication is that the group tends to act together (for example, all moving in the same direction at a given time), but that this does not occur as a result of planning or coordination. Rather, each individual is choosing behaviour in correspondence with most other members, possibly through imitation or possibly because all are responding to the same external circumstances. A herd can be contrasted with a coordinated group where individuals have distinct roles. Many human groupings, such as army detachments or sports teams, show such coordination and differentiation of roles, but so do some animal groupings such as those of eusocial insects, which are coordinated through pheromones and other forms of animal communication.

A herd is, by definition, relatively unstructured. However, there may be two or a few animals which tend to be imitated by the bulk of the herd more than others. An animal in this role is called a &quot;control animal&quot;, since its behaviour will predict that of the herd as a whole. It cannot be assumed, however, that the control animal is deliberately taking a leadership role; control animals are not necessarily socially dominant in conflict situations, though they often are. Group size is an important characteristic of the social environment of gregarious species.

==Costs and benefits of animals in groups==

The reason why animals form herds can not always be stated easily, since the underlying mechanisms are diverse and complex. Understanding the social behaviour of animals and the formation of groups has been a fundamental goal in the field of sociobiology and behavioural ecology. Theoretical framework is focused on the costs and benefits associated with living in groups in terms of the fitness of each individual compared to living solitarily. Living in groups evolved independently multiple times in various taxa and can only occur if its benefits outweigh the costs within an evolutionary timescale. Thus, animals form groups whenever this increases their fitness compared to living in solitary.

The following includes an outline about some of the major effects determining the trade-offs for living in groups.

===Dilution effect===
Perhaps the most studied effect of herds is the so-called dilution effect. The key argument is that the risk of being preyed upon for any particular individual is smaller within a larger group, strictly because a predator has to decide which individual to attack. Although the dilution effect is influenced by so-called selfish herding, it is primarily a direct effect of group size instead of the position within a herd. Greater group sizes result in higher visibility and detection rates for predators, but this relation is not directly proportional and saturates at some point, while the risk of being attacked for an individual is directly proportional to group size. Thus, the net effect for an individual in a group concerning its predation risk is beneficial.

Whenever groups, such as shoals of fish, synchronize their movements, it becomes harder for predators to focus on particular individuals. However, animals that are weak and slower or on the periphery are preferred by predators, so that certain positions within the group are better than others (see selfish herd theory). For fit animals, being in a group with such vulnerable individuals may thus decrease the chance of being preyed upon even further.

===Collective vigilance===

The effect of collective vigilance in social groups has been widely studied within the framework of optimal foraging theory and animal decision making. While animals under the risk of predation are feeding or resting, they have to stay vigilant and watch for predators. It could be shown in many studies (especially for birds) that with increase in group size individual animals are less attentive, while the overall vigilance suffers little (many eyes effect). This means food intake and other activities related to fitness are optimized in terms of time allocation when animals stay in groups.

However, some details about this concepts remain unclear. Being the first to detect predators and react accordingly can be advantageous, implying individuals may not fully be able to rely only on the group. Moreover, the competition for food can lead to the misuse of warning calls, as was observed for great tits: If food is scarce or monopolized by dominant birds, other birds (mainly subordinates) use antipredatory warning calls to induce an interruption of feeding and gain access to resources.

Another study concerning a flock of geese suggested that the benefits of lower vigilance concerned only those in central positions, due to the fact that the possibly more vulnerable individuals in the flock&#x27;s periphery have a greater need to stay attentive. This implies that the decrease in overall vigilance arises simply because the geese on the edge of the flock comprise a smaller group when groups get large.

A special case of collective vigilance in groups is that of sentinels. Individuals take turn in keeping guard, while all others participate in other activities. Thus, the strength of social bonds and trust within these groups have to be much higher than in the former cases.

===Foraging===
Hunting together enables group-living predators, such as wolves and wild dogs, to catch large prey, which they are unable to achieve when hunting alone. Working together significantly improves foraging efficiency, meaning the net energy gain of each individual is increased when animals are feeding collectively. As an example, a group of Spinner dolphins is able to corral fish into a smaller volume, which makes catching them easier, as there is less opportunity for the fish to escape. Furthermore, large groups are able to monopolize resources and defend them against solitary animals or smaller groups of the same or different species. It has been shown that larger groups of lions tend to be more successful in protecting prey from hyenas than smaller ones. Being able to communicate the location and type of food to other group members may increase the chance for each individual to find profitable food sources, a mechanism which is known to be used by both bees (via a Waggle dance) and several species of birds (using specific vocalisations to indicate food).

In terms of Optimal foraging theory, animals always try to maximize their net energy gain when feeding, because this is positively correlated to their fitness. If their energy requirement is fixed and additional energy is not increasing fitness, they will use as little time for foraging as possible (time minimizers). If on the other hand time allocated to foraging is fixed, an animal&#x27;s gain in fitness is related to the quantity and quality of resources it feeds on (Energy maximizers).

Since foraging may be energetically costly (searching, hunting, handling, etc.) and may induce risk of predation, animals in groups may have an advantage, since their combined effort in locating and handling food will reduce time needed to forage sufficiently. Thus, animals in groups may have shorter searching and handling times as well as an increased chance of finding (or monopolizing) highly profitable food, which makes foraging in groups beneficial for time minimizers and energy maximizers alike.

The obvious disadvantage of foraging in groups is (scramble or direct) competition with other group members. In general, it is clear that the amount of resources available for each individual decreases with group size. If the resource availability is critical, competition within the group may get so intense, that animals no longer experience benefits from living in groups. However, only the relative importance of within- and between-group competition determines the optimal group size and ultimately the decision of each individual whether or not to stay in the group.

===Diseases and parasites===
Since animals in groups stay near each other and interact frequently, infectious diseases and parasites spread much easier between them compared to solitary animals. Studies have shown a positive correlation between herd size and intensity of infections, but the extent to which this sometimes drastic reduction in fitness governs group size and structure is still unclear. However, some animals have found countermeasures such as propolis in beehives or grooming in social animals.

===Energetic advantages===
Staying together in groups often brings energetic advantages. Birds flying together in a flock use aerodynamic effects to reduce energetic costs, e.g. by positioning themselves in a V-shaped formation. A similar effect can be observed when fish swim together in fixed formations.

Another benefit of group living occurs when climate is harsh and cold: By staying close together animals experience better thermoregulation, because their overall surface to volume ratio is reduced. Consequently, maintaining adequate body temperatures becomes less energetically costly.

===Antipredatory behaviour===
The collective force of a group mobbing predators can reduce risk of predation significantly. Flocks of raven are able to actively defend themselves against eagles and baboons collectively mob lions, which is impossible for individuals alone. This behaviour may be based on reciprocal altruism, meaning animals are more likely to help each other if their conspecifics did so earlier.

===Mating===
Animals living in groups are more likely to find mates than those living in solitary and are also able to compare potential partners in order to optimize genetic quality for their offspring.

==Domestic herds==

Domestic animal herds are assembled by humans for practicality in raising them and controlling them. Their behaviour may be quite different from that of wild herds of the same or related species, since both their composition (in terms of the distribution of age and sex within the herd) and their history (in terms of when and how the individuals joined the herd) are likely to be very different.

== Human parallels ==
The term herd is also applied metaphorically to human beings in social psychology, with the concept of herd behaviour. However both the term and concepts that underlie its use are controversial.

The term has acquired a semi-technical usage in behavioral finance to describe the largest group of market investors or market speculators who tend to &quot;move with the market&quot;, or &quot;follow the general market trend&quot;. This is at least a plausible example of genuine herding, though according to some researchers it results from rational decisions through processes such as information cascade and rational expectations. Other researchers, however, ascribe it to non-rational process such as mimicry, fear and greed contagion. &quot;Contrarians&quot; or contrarian investors are those who deliberately choose to invest or speculate counter to the &quot;herd&quot;.

<doc id="969685" wikidata="Q2637350" url="?curid=969685" title="Chaim Soloveitchik">
<text>Chaim (Halevi) Soloveitchik (Yiddish: חיים סאָלאָווייטשיק, ), also known as Chaim Brisker (1853 – 30 July 1918), was a rabbi and Talmudic scholar credited as the founder of the Brisker method of Talmudic study within Judaism. He was also a member of the Soloveitchik dynasty, the son of Yosef Dov Soloveitchik.

He is also known as the Gra&quot;ch (Hebrew: גר״ח), an abbreviation of &quot;HaGaon Reb Chaim.&quot;

== Biography ==
Soloveitchik was born in Volozhin on March 25, 1853, where his father, Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik was a lecturer in the Volozhiner Yeshiva. The family moved away from Volozhin, and after a few years his father was appointed as a rabbi in Slutsk, where Chaim was first educated.

He joined the faculty of the Volozhiner Yeshiva in 1880, and later became assistant rosh yeshiva for a short time, until the Russian Empire forced the yeshiva to close, when he moved to Brisk, Belarus and succeeded his father as the rabbi there.
He died on July 30, 1918 after seeking medical treatment in Warsaw and was buried in the Jewish Cemetery there.

== Works ==
He is considered the founder of the &quot;Brisker method&quot; (in Yiddish: &quot;Brisker derech&quot;; ), a method of highly exacting and analytical Talmudical study that focuses on precise definition/s and categorization/s of Jewish law as commanded in the Torah. His works would have particular emphasis on the legal writings of Maimonides.

Soloveitchik&#x27;s primary work was &quot;Chiddushei Rabbeinu Chaim&quot;, a volume of insights on Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; which often would suggest novel understandings of the Talmud as well. Based on his teachings and lectures, his students wrote down his insights on the Talmud known as &quot;Chiddushi HaGRaCh Al Shas&quot;. This book is known as &quot;Reb Chaim&#x27;s stencils&quot; and contains analytical insights into Talmudic topics.

== Views ==
Soloveitchik worked with Sholom Dovber Schneersohn, the fifth rebbe of the hasidic dynasty of Lubavitch, in counteracting antisemitic decrees by the czarist regime. He expanded the definition of who represented Amalek, claiming that all who sought to destroy the Jewish people were ideological descendants of the Jewish enemy.

Soloveitchik was an opponent of Zionism and viewed it as a movement to destroy traditional Judaism and replace it with nationalism.

== Family ==
A member of the Soloveitchik-family rabbinical dynasty, he is commonly known as &quot;Reb Chaim Brisker&quot; (&quot;Rabbi Chaim [from] Brisk&quot;).

He married the daughter of Refael Shapiro, who was also the granddaughter of Berlin. Reb Chaim had four children, R. Yisrael Gershon, R. Moshe, Sara (Glickson), and R. Yitchak Zev (also known as Rabbi Velvel Soloveitchik). R. Moshe moved to the United States and subsequently served as a &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot; of Yeshiva Yitzchak Elchonon (YU/RIETS) in New York and who was in turn succeeded by his sons Joseph B. Soloveitchik (1903–1993) and Ahron Soloveichik (1917-2001). R. Yitzchak Zev moved to Israel and his sons led prominent yeshivas.

<doc id="969687" wikidata="Q4544935" url="?curid=969687" title="( ) (film)">
<text>( ) is a 2003 silent film directed by Morgan Fisher.

==Summary==
The film consists entirely of insert shots extracted from feature films, considering the &quot;status of the insert shot in an ingenious way&quot;, according to film expert Susan Oxtoby.

Fisher said of his film, &quot;Inserts are above all instrumental. They have a job to do, and they do it; and they do little, if anything, else. Sometimes inserts are remarkably beautiful, but this beauty is usually hard to see because the only thing that registers is the news, the expository information, that the insert conveys... By chance, I learned that the root of &#x27;parenthesis&#x27; is a Greek word that means the act of inserting. And so I was given the title of the film.&quot;

==Synopsis==
P. Adams Sitney, Professor of Visual Art at Princeton University, wrote a short essay for Artforum International &quot;Medium Shots: the films of Morgan Fisher&quot; in which he describes the film &quot;&quot;( )&quot;.&quot; &quot;Fisher&#x27;s most recent film, &quot;( )&quot;, succeeds astonishingly where Frampton&#x27;s parallel effort, &quot;Hapax Legomena: Remote Control&quot; (1972) failed; it uses aleatory methods to release the narrative unconscious of a set of randomly selected films. &quot;( )&quot; is made up entirely of &quot;inserts&quot; from feature films organized according to Oulipian principles. Inserts were usually shot by assistants when star actors, large crews, or expensive sets were not needed. These include details of weapons, wounds, letters, signs, tombstones, machinery, games of chance, timepieces, money, and even intimate caresses. Fisher culled the inserts from a number of films he collected for that purpose and edited them together under constraints he does not fully reveal; he places the inserts from a given film in the order in which they appeared in that film, but two inserts from the same film never follow each other directly in his assemblage. Alternating among them we catch glimpses of violence, intrigue, high-stakes gambling, and sexual adventure.&quot;

==Screening==
&quot;( )&quot; was screened on October 18, 2003, during the New York Film Festival, and on September 13, 2004, at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival as part of the Wavelengths programming.

<doc id="969698" wikidata="Q5061513" url="?curid=969698" title="Central New York Regional Transportation Authority">
<text>The Central New York Regional Transportation Authority, commonly referred to as Centro, is a New York State public benefit corporation and the operator of mass transit in Onondaga, Oswego, Cayuga, and Oneida counties in New York state. The CNYRTA was formed on August 1, 1970, along with similar agencies in Rochester, Albany, and Buffalo.

Centro won the American Public Transportation Association&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Outstanding Public Transportation System Achievement Award&quot; for bus companies serving 4 million to 30 million riders a year.

==Organization==
Centro has a 9-member board of directors, including one non-voting member. Its CEO is Brian Schultz. In 2017, Centro had operating expenses of $93.34 million, no outstanding debt, and a level of staffing of 738 people.

==Subsidiaries==
The Central New York Regional Transportation Authority is authorized by the State of New York to operate transit services in Cayuga, Cortland, Jefferson, Madison, Oneida, Onondaga, and Oswego counties. The below subsidiaries operate transit services in the counties that have opted-in to the transportation district.

===CNY Centro===

The biggest service subsidiary, CNY Centro, operates service in the city of Syracuse and suburban Onondaga County. Centro took over the assets and operations of the Syracuse Transit Corporation on January 17, 1972, and those of the suburban Syracuse &amp; Eastern Transit Corp. in 1974. CNY Centro staff provide support and administrative functions; including marketing, procurement, route planning, human resources, training and safety for all sister subsidiaries.

Local, express, and commuter routes connect the area with Downtown Syracuse and Syracuse University.

===Centro of Oswego===

Routes are based in the City of Oswego. Service began on August 28, 1972. Centro assumed operation of the Oswego-Fulton-Syracuse intercity bus service from S&amp;O Coach on June 21, 1993.

Routes generally travel east and west through the city, with connections to routes that travel to Fulton and Syracuse made in Downtown Oswego. Centro operates two student shuttle routes on the SUNY Oswego campus.

The neighboring communities of Fulton and Mexico are also provided with fixed route service.

===Centro of Cayuga===

Routes are based in the City of Auburn. Service began on April 2, 1973. Centro assumed operation of Auburn-Syracuse intercity bus service from Onondaga Coach on August 30, 1993.

Local bus routes are interlined in a continuous loop that makes a one-seat ride throughout the entire system and city possible.

===Centro of Oneida===

Centro of Oneida began operation on April 1, 2005 with the acquisition of the financially troubled Utica Transit Authority based in Utica. The UTA was a local agency that did not have the same ability to raise revenues as a public benefit corporation such as the CNYRTA. Merging the local county bus operations into the Centro system brought greater financial stability through savings in personnel and administrative costs. On October 1, 2005, Centro of Oneida assumed the operations of the VIP Transportation bus system in Rome. This merger of services has allowed for improved transit for citizens of Oneida County.
Even though, Oneida County public transit operations have been consolidated into one system, routes do not connect the cities of Rome and Utica. They also do not connect those cities to Onondaga, Cayuga, and Oswego Counties. Service between Utica, Rome and Syracuse is provided by Birnie Bus Service.

===Call-A-Bus===

Centro&#x27;s Call-A-Bus service provides paratransit service under the criteria set forth under the ADA. Members of the riding public, with disabilities that makes travel by transit buses difficult, are able to request pre-planned travel through the Call-A-Bus program. Service is offered in all areas that have regular route service.

===Centro Parking, Inc.===

Centro Parking, Inc. is a subsidiary that leases land from the State of New York in Downtown Syracuse to sell monthly parking. Centro Parking, Inc., has in the past, offered management of parking garages for local institutions like SUNY Upstate. Revenue that is generated from the parking lots contributes to the operational budget for transit services.

==Bus routes==

Centro operates thirty-six bus routes in Syracuse, eight bus routes in Oswego County, seven bus routes in Auburn, six bus routes in Rome, and eleven bus routes in Utica. In 2018, Centro had a ridership of 10.3 million trips, down from a 2008 high of 12.1 million trips.

In Syracuse and Utica, bus routes are numbered with a two digit base number. Short turn and variations of the base route are prefixed with an additional number to denote a different travel pattern. Bus routes in Oswego and Fulton use an alpha-numeric numbering scheme that suffixes the base route with a letter to denote a different travel pattern.

In each service area, routes operate in a spoke-hub model; focused on the downtown areas of cities served with routes extending to outlying neighborhoods and communities. This focus on downtown areas is the origin for the common name of Centro; the Spanish word for downtown. Buses arrive at the various hubs at fixed times throughout the day to allow for streamlined transfers. CNY Centro and Centro of Oswego operate campus shuttle routes for Syracuse University and SUNY Oswego, respectively.

CNY Centro operates various Community Extra routes, open to the public, that directly serve public, charter, and parochial high schools attended by students who reside within the Syracuse City School District. High school students, that live 1.5 or more miles from their school, are provided with free travel to and from school on school days.

Special event service is operated by CNY Centro for sporting events at the Carrier Dome and Lakeview Amphitheater concerts. CNY Centro, Centro of Cayuga, and Centro of Oswego all operate extensive shuttle service to and from the New York State Fair. In recent years, with increased attendance at the State Fair, other Upstate New York transit agencies have provided buses and drivers to meet demand for parking lot shuttles.

Several Park-N-Rides are located throughout suburban Onondaga County that are served by CNY Centro bus routes.

==Facilities==

===Syracuse Centro Transit Hub===

The Centro Transit Hub in Syracuse, located at 599 S. Salina St, replaced the original Common Center transfer location at the intersection of S. Salina and E. Fayette Streets.

The old Common Center utilized the four corners of the intersection to &quot;line up&quot; buses, leaving passengers unprotected from inclement weather and with limited seating. Centro riders often had to cross the busy intersection twice to reach their next bus. The congestion caused by having dozens of full-sized buses and hundreds of people transferring buses at regular intervals throughout the day had been blamed for the lack of development in the 300 block of South Salina St.

Centro chose the current site of the Hub in 2006 and plans were approved by the Federal Transit Administration in November 2008. The design team included Centro, QPK Design, Parsons Brinckerhoff, Robson Woese Inc., and Fisher Associates. Construction began in 2011 and the facility opened on September 4, 2012. The facility offers twenty-two covered bus bays, covered outdoor seating, and an indoor lobby with seating, public restrooms, information booth and ticket vending machines.

===William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center===

The William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center is the long-distance ground travel (rail and bus) terminal serving the Syracuse area, located at 1 Walsh Circle. The RTC is operated by Centro subsidiary Intermodal Transportation Center, Inc. The transportation center is served by many local bus routes and provides connections to Amtrak, Greyhound, Megabus and Trailways of New York.

===Utica Centro Transit Hub===

The Centro Transit Hub in Utica, located at 15 Elizabeth St, replaced the original Busy Corner transfer location located at the intersection of Genesee, Bleecker and Lafayette Streets.

The transfer point was moved one block east to Charlotte Street between Bleecker and Elizabeth Streets. This portion of Charlotte Street was closed and converted to a center island platform with nine bus bays and seating. A lobby with an enclosed waiting area, information booth, ticket vending machines and public restrooms was also constructed. The facility opened for service on February 4, 2013.

===Rome Centro Transit Hub===

The Centro Transit Hub in Rome, located at 207 W Liberty St, replaced the original transfer location located at the Liberty-George parking garage. It is owned by the city of Rome and leased to Centro of Oneida. The Liberty-George parking structure was deemed structurally unsound and demolished in 2019, with Centro pre-emptively moving to a temporary location in 2018. The new, permanent facility offers an enclosed waiting area and information booth and opened on November 2, 2020.

<doc id="969707" wikidata="Q7314290" url="?curid=969707" title="Reprobation">
<text>Reprobation, in Christian theology, is a doctrine which teaches that a person can reject the gospel to a point where God in turn rejects them and curses their conscience. The English word &quot;reprobate&quot; is from the Latin root &quot;probare&quot; (&quot;English&quot;: prove, test), which gives the Latin participle &quot;reprobatus&quot; (reproved, condemned), the opposite of &quot;approbatus&quot; (commended, approved). The doctrine is first found in Jeremiah 6:30, but also found in many passages of scripture such as Romans 1:20-28, 2 Corinthians 13:5-6, Proverbs 1:23-33, John 12:37-41, and Hebrews 6:4-8.

Some in the Christian community will link reprobation directly with the unforgivable sin.

In Christian doctrine, when a sinner is so hardened as to feel no remorse or misgiving of conscience for particularly vile acts, it is considered a sign of reprobation. The doctrine does not stipulate that because of a reprobates&#x27; wicked deeds that God will not save them, but rather that God has effectively permanently withdrawn his offer of salvation by giving them over to a seared conscience, and now they are a reprobate capable of willingly committing these certain sins not common among mankind.

==Calvinistic doctrine==

* As stated in the Canons of Dordrecht, First Head (Chapter 1) Article 15 and Article 16:
Moreover, Holy Scripture most especially highlights this eternal and undeserved grace of our election and brings it out more clearly for us, in that it further bears witness that not all people have been chosen but that some have not been chosen or have been passed by in God&#x27;s eternal election-- those, that is, concerning whom God, on the basis of his entirely free, most just, irreproachable, and unchangeable good pleasure, made the following decision: to leave them in the common misery into which, by their own fault, they have plunged themselves; not to grant them saving faith and the grace of conversion; but finally to condemn and eternally punish them (having been left in their own ways and under his just judgment), not only for their unbelief but also for all their other sins, in order to display his justice. And this is the decision of reprobation, which does not at all make God the author of sin, but rather its fearful, irreproachable, just judge and avenger.
* As explained by Loraine Boettner, &quot;The RefDoctrine of Predestination&quot; (Eerdmans, 1932):
The doctrine of absolute Predestination of course logically holds that some are foreordained to death as truly as others are foreordained to life. The very terms “elect” and “election” imply the terms “non-elect” and “reprobation.” When some are chosen out others are left not chosen. The high privileges and glorious destiny of the former are not shared with the latter. This, too, is of God. We believe that from all eternity God has intended to leave some of Adam’s posterity in their sins, and that the decisive factor in the life of each is to be found only in God’s will. As Mozley has said, the whole race after the fall was “one mass of perdition,” and “it pleased God of His sovereign mercy to rescue some and to leave others where they were; to raise some to glory, giving them such grace as necessarily qualified them for it, and abandon the rest, from whom He withheld such grace, to eternal punishment.”

In all of the Reformed creeds in which the doctrine of reprobation is dealt with at all it is treated as an essential part of the doctrine of predestination. The Westminster Confession, after stating the doctrine of election, adds: “The rest of mankind, God was pleased, according to the inscrutable counsel of His own will, whereby He extendeth or withholdeth mercy as He pleaseth, for the glory of His sovereign power over His creatures, to pass by, and to ordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin, to the praise of His glorious justice.”

<doc id="969715" wikidata="Q807754" url="?curid=969715" title="Barbarikon">
<text>Barbarikon () was the name of a sea port near the modern-day city of Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan, important in the ancient era of the Indian subcontinent in Indian Ocean trade. The port is considered one of the premiere ports regarding the interaction between ancient India with the Middle East and Mediterranean world. It comes from the Greek word of the term (also in Latin, &quot;barbaricum&quot;), designating areas outside the Greco-Roman world.

It may have been a translation from Sumerian word Meluhha for the Sindh from which the Sanskrit word for barbarian, Mleccha derives.
Barbarikon is mentioned briefly in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea:

:&quot;This river [the Indus] has seven mouths, very shallow and marshy, so that they are not navigable, except the one in the middle; at which by the shore, is the market-town, Barbaricum. Before it there lies a small island, and inland behind it is the metropolis of Scythia, Minnagara; it is subject to Parthian princes who are constantly driving each other out.&quot;

:&quot;The ships lie at anchor at Barbaricum, but all their cargoes are carried up to the metropolis by the river, to the King. There are imported into this market a great deal of thin clothing, and a little spurious; figured linens, topaz, coral, storax, frankincense, vessels of glass, silver and gold plate, and a little wine. On the other hand there are exported costus, bdellium, lycium, nard, turquoise, lapis lazuli, Seric skins, cotton cloth, silk yarn, and indigo. And sailors set out thither with the Indian Etesian winds, about the, month of July, that is Epiphi: it is more dangerous then, but through these winds the voyage is more direct, and sooner completed.&quot;

Its principal function beyond supplying its immediate hinterland was as a transshipment port for supplies of Persian turquoise and Afghan lapis lazuli, to be carried overland to Egypt.

<doc id="969719" wikidata="Q1403627" url="?curid=969719" title="Hrethel">
<text>Hrethel (; ) is a king of the Geats.

== Name ==
Hrethel&#x27;s name appears with both the root vowel and and with both the consonant (i.e. the phoneme , pronounced in Old English) and (which would ordinarily represent the phoneme ). This is thought to be due to an early manuscript of &quot;Beowulf&quot; writing the root vowel using the early graphs (for the vowel resulting from the i-mutation of Common Germanic ) and (for the phoneme , pronounced ). Later scribes misread the former as and failed to recognise that the latter represented the sound rather than .

The name also appears as a genitive weak noun, in the half-line &quot;þæt is Hrǣdlan lāf&quot; (&#x27;that is Hrǣdla&#x27;s bequest&#x27;). Rendered in ordinary Late West Saxon spelling and in nominative form, this form of the name would presumably have been *&quot;Hrēðla&quot;.

== Role in &quot;Beowulf&quot; ==
Hrethel is married to a sister or daughter of Swerting (Hygelac is the nefa of Swerting) and he has three sons: Hæþcyn, Herebeald and Hygelac. He also has a daughter who marries Ecgþeow and has the son Beowulf.

Hrethel fosters Beowulf (his grandson) by taking him into his royal household aged seven. Fostering was a common Germanic practice and does not indicate Beowulf&#x27;s father, Ecgþeow did not want to raise him; indeed, the practice was intended to further improve relations between families and family members, and create close ties of obligation, affection and shared responsibility. As an adult, Beowulf expresses his gratitude to his foster-father explicitly:
Hreðel dies of grief when his oldest son Herebeald is killed by his own brother Hæþcyn in a hunting accident, a death that could not be avenged. He is succeeded by Hæþcyn.

<text>A Schmidt camera, also referred to as the Schmidt telescope, is a catadioptric astrophotographic telescope designed to provide wide fields of view with limited aberrations. The design was invented by Bernhard Schmidt in 1930.

Some notable examples are the Samuel Oschin telescope (formerly Palomar Schmidt), the UK Schmidt Telescope and the ESO Schmidt; these provided the major source of all-sky photographic imaging from 1950 until 2000, when electronic detectors took over. A recent example is the Kepler space telescope exoplanet finder.

Other related designs are the Wright camera and Lurie–Houghton telescope.

==Invention and design==
The Schmidt camera was invented by Estonian-German optician Bernhard Schmidt in 1930. Its optical components are an easy-to-make spherical primary mirror, and an aspherical correcting lens, known as a Schmidt corrector plate, located at the center of curvature of the primary mirror. The film or other detector is placed inside the camera, at the prime focus. The design is noted for allowing very fast focal ratios, while controlling coma and astigmatism.

Schmidt cameras have very strongly curved focal planes, thus requiring that the film, plate, or other detector be correspondingly curved. In some cases the detector is made curved; in others flat media is mechanically conformed to the shape of the focal plane through the use of retaining clips or bolts, or by the application of a vacuum. A field flattener, in its simplest form a planoconvex lens in front of the film plate or detector, is sometimes used. Since the corrector plate is at the center of curvature of the primary mirror in this design the tube length can be very long for a wide-field telescope. There are also the drawbacks of having the obstruction of the film holder or detector mounted at the focus halfway up the tube assembly, a small amount of light is blocked and there is a loss in contrast in the image due to diffraction effects of the obstruction and its support structure.

===Schmidt corrector plate===

A Schmidt corrector plate is an aspheric lens which corrects the spherical aberration introduced by the spherical primary mirror of the Schmidt or Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope designs. It was invented by Bernhard Schmidt in 1931, although it may have been independently invented by Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä in 1924 (sometimes called the Schmidt–Väisälä camera as a result). Schmidt originally introduced it as part of a wide-field photographic catadioptric telescope, the Schmidt camera. It is now used in several other telescope designs, camera lenses and image projection systems that utilise a spherical primary mirror.

====Function====
Schmidt corrector plates work because they are aspheric lenses with spherical aberration that is equal to but opposite of the spherical primary mirrors they are placed in front of. They are placed at the center of curvature &quot;C&quot; of the mirrors for a pure Schmidt camera and just behind the prime focus for a Schmidt–Cassegrain. The Schmidt corrector is thicker in the middle and the edge. This corrects the light paths so light reflected from the outer part of the mirror and light reflected from the inner portion of the mirror is brought to the same common focus &quot;F&quot;. The Schmidt corrector only corrects for spherical aberration. It does not change the focal length of the system.

====Manufacture====
Schmidt corrector plates can be manufactured in many ways. The most basic method, called the &quot;classical approach&quot;, involves directly figuring the corrector by grinding and polishing the aspherical shape into a flat glass blank using specially shaped and sized tools. This method requires a high degree of skill and training on the part of the optical engineer creating the corrector.

Schmidt himself worked out a second, more elegant, scheme for producing the complex figure needed for the correcting plate. A thin glass disk with a perfectly polished accurate flat surface on both sides was placed on a heavy rigid metal pan. The top surface of the pan around the edge of the glass disk was ground at a precise angle or bevel based on the coefficient of elasticity of the particular type of glass that was being used. The glass plate was sealed to the ground edge of the pan. Then a vacuum pump was used to exhaust the air between the pan and glass through a small hole in the center of the pan until a particular negative pressure had been achieved. This caused the glass plate to warp slightly. The exposed upper surface of the glass was then ground and polished spherical. When the vacuum was released, the lower surface of the plate returned to its original flat form while the upper surface had the aspheric figure needed for a Schmidt corrector plate. Schmidt&#x27;s vacuum figuring method is rarely used today. Holding the shape by constant vacuum is difficult and errors in the o-ring seal and even contamination behind the plate could induce optical errors. The glass plate could also break if bent enough to generate a curve for telescopes of focal ratio f/2.5 or faster. Also, for fast focal ratios, the curve obtained is not sufficiently exact and requires additional hand correction.

A third method, invented in 1970 for Celestron by Tom Johnson and John O&#x27;rourke, uses a vacuum pan with the correct shape of the curve pre-shaped into the bottom of the pan, called a &quot;master block&quot;. The upper exposed surface is then polished flat creating a corrector with the correct shape once the vacuum is released. This removes the need to have to hold a shape by applying an exact vacuum and allows for the mass production of corrector plates of the same exact shape.

The technical difficulties associated with the production of Schmidt corrector plates led some designers, such as Dmitri Dmitrievich Maksutov and Albert Bouwers, to come up with alternative designs using more conventional meniscus corrector lenses.

==Applications==
Because of its wide field of view, the Schmidt camera is typically used as a survey instrument, for research programs in which a large amount of sky must be covered. These include astronomical surveys, comet and asteroid searches, and nova patrols.

In addition, Schmidt cameras and derivative designs are frequently used for tracking artificial Earth satellites.

===Ground-based===
The first relatively large Schmidt telescopes were built at Hamburg Observatory and Palomar Observatory shortly before World War II. Between 1945 and 1980, about eight more large (1 meter or larger) Schmidt telescopes were built around the world.

One particularly famous and productive Schmidt camera is the Oschin Schmidt Telescope at Palomar Observatory, completed in 1948. This instrument was used in the National Geographic Society – Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS, 1958), the POSS-II survey, the Palomar-Leiden (asteroid) Surveys, and other projects.

The European Southern Observatory with a 1-meter Schmidt telescope at La Silla and the UK Science Research Council with a 1.2 meter Schmidt telescope at Siding Spring Observatory engaged in a collaborative sky survey to complement the first Palomar Sky Survey, but focusing on the southern hemisphere. The technical improvements developed during this survey encouraged the development of the Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS II).

The telescope used in the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) is also a Schmidt camera. The Schmidt telescope of the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory is the largest Schmidt camera of the world.

===Space-based===
A Schmidt telescope was at the heart of the Hipparcos (1989–1993) satellite from the European Space Agency. This was used in the Hipparcos Survey which mapped the distances of more than a million stars with unprecedented accuracy: it included 99% of all stars up to magnitude 11. The spherical mirror used in this telescope was extremely accurate; if scaled up to the size of the Atlantic Ocean, bumps on its surface would be about 10 cm high.

The Kepler photometer, mounted on NASA&#x27;s Kepler space telescope (2009–2018), is the largest Schmidt camera launched into space.

===Other applications===
In 1977 at Yerkes Observatory, a small Schmidt telescope was used to derive an accurate optical position for the planetary nebula NGC 7027 to allow comparison between photographs and radio maps of the object.

Starting in the early 1970s, Celestron marketed an 8-inch Schmidt camera. The camera was focused in the factory and was made of materials with low expansion coefficients so it would never need to be focused in the field. Early models required the photographer to cut and develop individual frames of 35 mm film, as the film holder could only hold one frame of film. About 300 Celestron Schmidt cameras were produced.

The Schmidt system was popular, used in reverse, for television projection systems, notably the Advent design by Henry Kloss. Large Schmidt projectors were used in theaters, but systems as small as 8 inches were made for home use and other small venues.

==Derivative designs==

===Lensless Schmidt===
In the 1930s, Schmidt noted that the corrector plate could be replaced with a simple aperture at the mirror&#x27;s center of curvature for a slow (numerically high f-ratio) camera. Such a design was used to construct a working 1/8-scale model of the Palomar Schmidt, with a 5° field. The retronym &quot;lensless Schmidt&quot; has been given to this configuration.

===Schmidt–Väisälä===

Yrjö Väisälä originally designed an &quot;astronomical camera&quot; similar to Bernhard Schmidt&#x27;s &quot;Schmidt camera&quot;, but the design was unpublished. Väisälä did mention it in lecture notes in 1924 with a footnote: &quot;problematic spherical focal plane&quot;. Once Väisälä saw Schmidt&#x27;s publication, he promptly went ahead and solved the field-flattening problem in Schmidt&#x27;s design by placing a doubly convex lens slightly in front of the film holder. This resulting system is known as: Schmidt–Väisälä camera or sometimes as &quot;Väisälä camera&quot;.

===Baker–Schmidt===
In 1940, James Baker of Harvard University modified the Schmidt camera design to include a convex secondary mirror, which reflected light back toward the primary. The photographic plate was then installed near the primary, facing the sky. This variant is called the Baker-Schmidt camera.

===Baker–Nunn===

The Baker–Nunn design, by Baker and Joseph Nunn, replaces the Baker-Schmidt camera&#x27;s corrector plate with a small triplet corrector lens closer to the focus of the camera. It used a 55 mm wide film derived from the Cinemascope 55 motion picture process. A dozen f/0.75 Baker-Nunn cameras with 20-inch apertures – each weighing 3.5 tons including a multiple axis mount allowing it to follow satellites in the sky – were used by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to track artificial satellites from June 1958 until the mid-1970s.

===Mersenne–Schmidt===
The Mersenne–Schmidt camera consists of a concave paraboloidal primary mirror, a convex spherical secondary mirror, and a concave spherical tertiary mirror. The first two mirrors (a Mersenne configuration) perform the same function of the correcting plate of the conventional Schmidt. This form was invented by Paul in 1935.
A later paper by Baker
introduced the Paul-Baker design, a similar configuration but with a flat focal plane.

===Schmidt–Newton===

The addition of a flat secondary mirror at 45° to the optical axis of the Schmidt design creates a Schmidt–Newtonian telescope.

===Schmidt–Cassegrain===

The addition of a convex secondary mirror to the Schmidt design directing light through a hole in the primary mirror creates a Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope.

The last two designs are popular with telescope manufacturers because they are compact and use simple spherical optics.

<text>Cris LaCara Aglugub (born December 25, 1942) is a former Canadian politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1999 to 2007.

==Education==
Aglugub was educated at Araneta University Foundation in the Philippines, and at Red River Community College in Manitoba. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in agriculture.

==Early career==
Before entering politics, he worked as a computer programmer and provided technical support to Manitoba Agriculture. He has served on the Mayor&#x27;s Race Relations Committee and the Manitoba Citizenship Council&#x27;s Language Bank, and is a Past President of the Philippine Association of Manitoba. He co-founded the Philippine Centre of Manitoba in 1984, and was instrumental in founding a community day care facility. During the 1990s, Aglugub helped facilitate a twinning agreement between Winnipeg and Manila, with a corresponding arrangement between the University of Manitoba and the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila.

==Political career==
Aglugub was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1999 election, running as a New Democrat in the north Winnipeg riding of The Maples. He received 4,329 votes against 2,310 for his nearest opponent, Progressive Conservative Ellen Kowalski. Following the NDP&#x27;s election victory (the Conservatives had formed government since 1988), he was named Legislative Assistant to the Minister of Labour and Immigration, and subsequently to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Trade. In 2003, he supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s bid to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party.

Aglugub was re-elected in the 2003 Manitoba general election, receiving about 68% of the vote in The Maples. He was not re-nominated for the New Democratic Party in the 2007 provincial election; Mohinder Saran retained the district for the NDP. He ran in the 2011 provincial election as a Progressive Conservative in the riding of Tyndall Park, being contested for the first time, finishing third behind Ted Marcelino of the NDP and Roldan Sevillano of the Liberals.

<text>Hæthcyn () is the son of the Geatish king Hreðel in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

The hero Beowulf is Hæþcyn&#x27;s nephew. Hæþcyn kills his elder brother Herebeald with an arrow in a hunting accident, which causes their father Hrethel to die from grief. Then Hæþcyn becomes king of Geatland. During the Swedish-Geatish wars, Hæþcyn kidnaps the Swedish queen, and is killed fighting with the Swedish king Ongenþeow who saved her. The Geatish warriors seek refuge in Hrefnesholt, where they are rescued by Hygelac, who arrives the next day with reinforcements. His warrior Eofor kills the Swedish king. Hæþcyn is succeeded by Hygelac.

<doc id="969734" wikidata="Q971586" url="?curid=969734" title="Seward Peninsula">
<text>The Seward Peninsula is a large peninsula on the western coast of the U.S. state of Alaska whose westernmost point is Cape Prince of Wales. The peninsula projects about into the Bering Sea between Norton Sound, the Bering Strait, the Chukchi Sea, and Kotzebue Sound, just below the Arctic Circle. The entire peninsula is about long and wide. Like Seward, Alaska, it was named after William H. Seward, the United States Secretary of State who fought for the U.S. purchase of Alaska.

The Seward Peninsula is a remnant of the Bering land bridge, a roughly thousand-mile-wide swath of land connecting Siberia with mainland Alaska during the Pleistocene Ice Age. This land bridge aided in the migration of humans, as well as plant and animal species, from Asia to North America. Excavations at sites such as the Trail Creek Caves and Cape Espenberg in the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve as well as Cape Denbigh to the south have provided insight into the timeline of prehistorical migrations from Asia to the Seward Peninsula.

== Demographics ==

Most of the peninsula is in the Nome Census Area, but part is in the Northwest Arctic Borough. These are the communities on the Seward Peninsula, with 2005 state population estimates:
Other locations on the Seward Peninsula include the mining towns of Council, Solomon, Candle, Haycock and Taylor. While still frequented by locals of neighboring communities, there are no longer year round residents in these locations. There was a United States Coast Guard LORAN station at Port Clarence. The U.S. Air Force operates a radar station at the &quot;Tin City&quot; site, southeast of Wales.

== Geography and ecology ==

The Seward Peninsula has several distinct geologic features. The Devil Mountain Lakes on the northern portion of the peninsula are the largest maar lakes in the world and part of the Espenberg volcanic field. They were formed over 21,000 years ago as the result of an underground steam explosion. The Killeak Lakes and White Fish Lake are also volcanic maar lakes of notable size on the northern Seward Peninsula. Four mountain ranges line the southern side of the peninsula, the most prominent being the Kigluaik (or Sawtooth) Mountains. The highest point in the range and the peninsula is the peak of Mount Osborn. Other mountain ranges on the Seward Peninsula include the Bendeleben Mountains, Darby Mountains, and York Mountains. The Bendeleben Mountains exhibit evidence of recent faulting in the late Cenozoic, with the majority of tectonic deformation and mountain formation occurring in the Cretaceous, which is attributed to regional tectonic block rotation of the Bering plate in the Arctic. The Lost Jim Lava Flow north of Kuzitrin Lake is a lava field formed roughly 1,000 to 2,000 years ago, which covers roughly .

Several geothermal hot springs are located throughout the peninsula, including Serpentine Hot Springs, Pilgrim Hot Springs, Granite Mountain, Elim, Clear Creek and Lava Creek.

The Seward Peninsula has several rivers. The largest include the Koyuk, Kuzitrin, Niukluk, Fish, Tubuktilik, Kiwalik, Buckland and Agiupuk rivers. These play a vital role in the subsistence lifestyles of many peninsula residents and ease travel, hunting, and fishing. Most peninsula rivers have at least a small yearly run of several varieties of salmon, as well as Dolly Varden trout, Arctic grayling, whitefish of various species, northern pike, and burbot. Most rivers on the Seward Peninsula freeze in mid-October; spring break-up usually occurs in mid- to late May.

The Seward Peninsula is the westernmost limit of distribution for the black spruce, &quot;Picea mariana&quot;, a dominant overstory species of the region.

Alaska&#x27;s reindeer herding was concentrated on the Seward Peninsula ever since the first shipment of reindeer were imported there from eastern Siberia in 1892. It was believed that migrating caribou could be prevented from mingling with the domesticated reindeer on the Peninsula because of the geography of the peninsula, thereby avoiding loss of reindeer that might wander off with caribou. However, in 1997 the domesticated reindeer joined the Western Arctic Caribou Herd on their summer migration and disappeared.

Cape Prince of Wales, the westernmost point on the mainland of the Americas, is on the western tip. The cape is only from Cape Dezhnev, the closest point on the Russian mainland. In August 2011 Russia announced an ambitious project to construct a rail tunnel under the Bering Strait, linking the Seward Peninsula in Alaska with the Chukchi Peninsula in Russia. If completed, the project would cost an estimated US$65 billion and would be the world&#x27;s longest tunnel at long.

The peninsula was named after William H. Seward, the United States Secretary of State who negotiated the Purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.

<doc id="969736" wikidata="Q898443" url="?curid=969736" title="Livestock branding">
<text>Livestock branding is a technique for marking livestock so as to identify the owner. Originally, livestock branding only referred to hot branding large stock with a branding iron, though the term now includes alternative techniques. Other forms of livestock identification include freeze branding, inner lip or ear tattoos, earmarking, ear tagging, and radio-frequency identification (RFID), which is tagging with a microchip implant. The semi-permanent paint markings used to identify sheep are called a paint or color brand. In the American West, branding evolved into a complex marking system still in use today.

==History==
The act of marking livestock with fire-heated marks to identify ownership has origins in ancient times, with use dating back to the ancient Egyptians around 2,700 BCE. Among the ancient Romans, the symbols used for brands were sometimes chosen as part of a magic spell aimed at protecting animals from harm.

In English lexicon, the word &quot;brand&quot;, common to most Germanic languages (from which root also comes &quot;burn&quot;, cf. German &quot;Brand&quot; &quot;burning, fire&quot;), originally meant anything hot or burning, such as a &quot;firebrand&quot;, a burning stick. By the European Middle Ages, it commonly identified the process of burning a mark into stock animals with thick hides, such as cattle, so as to identify ownership under &quot;animus revertendi&quot;. The practice became particularly widespread in nations with large cattle grazing regions, such as Spain.

These European customs were imported to the Americas and were further refined by the &quot;vaquero&quot; tradition in what today is the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. In the American West, a &quot;branding iron&quot; consisted of an iron rod with a simple symbol or mark, which cowboys heated in a fire. After the branding iron turned red hot, the cowboy pressed the branding iron against the hide of the cow. The unique brand meant that cattle owned by multiple ranches could then graze freely together on the open range. Cowboys could then separate the cattle at &quot;roundup&quot; time for driving to market. Cattle rustlers using running irons were ingenious in changing brands. The most famous brand change involved the making of the X I T brand into the Star-Cross brand, a star with a cross inside. Brands became so numerous that it became necessary to record them in books that the ranchers could carry in their pockets. Laws were passed requiring the registration of brands, and the inspection of cattle driven through various territories. Penalties were imposed on those who failed to obtain a bill of sale with a list of brands on the animals purchased.

From the Americas, many cattle branding traditions and techniques spread to Australia, where a distinct set of traditions and techniques developed. Livestock branding has been practiced in Australia since 1866, but after 1897 owners had to register their brands. These fire and paint brands could not then be duplicated legally. 

===Modern use===
Free-range or open-range grazing is less common today than in the past. However, branding still has its uses. The main purpose is in proving ownership of lost or stolen animals. Many western US states have strict laws regarding brands, including brand registration, and require brand inspections. In many cases, a brand on an animal is considered &quot;prima facie&quot; proof of ownership. (See Brand Book)

In the hides and leather industry, brands are treated as a defect, and can diminish the value of hides. This industry has a number of traditional terms relating to the type of brand on a hide. &quot;Colorado branded&quot; (slang &quot;Collie&quot;) refers to placement of a brand on the side of an animal, although this does not necessarily indicate the animal is from Colorado. &quot;Butt branded&quot; refers to a hide which has had a brand placed on the portion of the skin covering the rump area of the animal. A &quot;native&quot; hide is one without a brand.

Outside of the livestock industry, hot branding was used in 2003 by tortoise researchers to provide a permanent means of unique identification of individual Galapagos tortoises being studied. In this case, the brand was applied to the rear of the tortoises&#x27; shells. This technique has since been superseded by implanted PIT microchips (combined with ID numbers painted on the shell).

==Methods==
The traditional cowboy or stockman captured and secured an animal for branding by roping it, laying it over on the ground, tying its legs together, and applying a branding iron that had been heated in a fire. Modern ranch practice has moved toward use of chutes where animals can be run into a confined area and safely secured while the brand is applied. Two types of restraint are the cattle crush or squeeze chute (for larger cattle), which may close on either side of a standing animal, or a branding cradle, where calves are caught in a cradle which is rotated so that the animal is lying on its side.
Bronco branding is an old method of catching cleanskin (unbranded) cattle on Top End cattle stations for branding in Australia. A heavy horse, usually with some draught horse bloodlines and typically fitted with a harness horse collar, is used to rope the selected calf. The calf is then pulled up to several sloping topped panels and a post constructed for the purpose in the centre of the yard. The unmounted stockmen then apply leg ropes and pull it to the ground to be branded, earmarked and castrated (if a bull) there. With the advent of portable cradles, this method of branding has been mostly phased out on stations. However, there are now quite a few bronco branding competitions at rodeos and campdrafting days, etc.

Some ranches still heat branding irons in a wood or coal fire; others use an electric branding iron or electric sources to heat a traditional iron. Gas-fired branding iron heaters are quite popular in Australia, as iron temperatures can be regulated and there is not the heat of a nearby fire. Regardless of heating method, the iron is only applied for the amount of time needed to remove all hair and create a permanent mark. Branding irons are applied for a longer time to cattle than to horses, due to the differing thicknesses of their skins. If a brand is applied too long, it can damage the skin too deeply, thus requiring treatment for potential infection and longer-term healing. Branding wet stock may result in the smudging of the brand. Brand identification may be difficult on long-haired animals, and may necessitate clipping of the area to view the brand.

Horses may also be branded on their hooves, but this is not a permanent mark, so needs to be redone about every six months. In the military, some brands indicated the horses&#x27; army and squadron numbers. These identification numbers were used on British army horses so dead horses on the battlefield could be identified. The hooves of the dead horses were then removed and returned to the Horse Guards with a request for replacements. This method was used to prevent fraudulent requests for horses. Merino rams and bulls are sometimes firebranded on their horns for permanent individual identification.

==Temporary branding==

Some types of identification are not permanent. Temporary branding may be achieved by heat branding so that the hair is burned, but the skin is not damaged. Because this persists only until the animal sheds its hair, it is not considered a properly applied brand. Other temporary, but for a time, persistent marking methods include tagging, and nose printing. Tagging usually uses numbering system as a way to identify animals in a herd. It does this by putting together a letter and number to represent the year born and the birth order, then the tag is either attached to the animal’s ear or to some form of neck collar. Nose printing or use of indelible ink elsewhere on the skin and hair is used at some farms, sales and exhibitions. This method is like fingerprinting: it uses ink and cannot be modified. As hair or skin cells shed, the mark eventually fades. 

Microchip identification and lip or ear tattooing are generally permanent, though microchips can be removed and tattoos sometimes fade over many years. Microchips are used on many animals, and are particularly popular with horses, as the chip leaves no external marks. Tattooing the inside of the upper lip of horses is required for many racehorses, though in some localities, microchips are beginning to replace tattoos. 

Temporary branding is particularly common for sheep and goats. Ear marking or tattooing are usually used on goats under eight weeks of age because regular branding would harm them. Techniques similar to these are also used on sheep. Temporary branding on sheep is done with paint, crayons, spray markers, chalk, and much more. These can last for up to several months at a time. The sheep&#x27;s identification number is painted or sprayed with an indelible but non-toxic paint designed for the purpose onto their sides or back.

==Freeze branding==


In stark contrast to traditional hot-iron branding, freeze branding uses an iron that has been chilled with a coolant such as dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Instead of burning a scar into the animal&#x27;s skin, a freeze brand damages the pigment-producing hair cells, causing the animal&#x27;s hair to grow back white within the branded area. This white-on-dark pattern is prized by cattle ranchers as its contrast allows some range work to be conducted with binoculars rather than individual visits to every animal. Scientists also value the technique for keeping tabs on studied wildlife without having to approach to read, for example, an ear tag. 

To apply a freeze brand the hair coat of the animal is first shaved very closely so that bare skin is exposed. Then the frozen iron is pressed to the animal&#x27;s bare skin for a period of time that varies with both the species of animal and the color of its hair coat. Shorter times are used on dark-colored animals, as this causes follicle melanocyte death and hence permanent pigment loss to the hair when it regrows. Longer timessometimes as little as five additional secondsare needed for animals with white hair coats. In these cases the brand is applied for long enough to outright kill the cells of the growth follicle, preventing them from regrowing new hair filaments and leaving the animal permanently bald in the branded area. The somewhat darker epidermis then contrasts well with a pale animal&#x27;s coat.

Horses are frequently freeze-branded. Neither hogs nor birds can presently be freeze branded successfully, as their hair pigment cells are better protected. Other downsides of freeze branding include its time consuming preparation, greater expense in material and time, low tolerance for sloppy application, long wait until success (sometimes as much as five months) and absence of legal grounding in some American states. When an animal grows a long hair coat the freeze brand is still visible, but its details are not always legible. Thus it is sometimes necessary to shave or closely trim the hair to obtain a sharper view of the freeze brand.

Besides livestock, freeze branding can also be used on wild, hairless animals such as dolphins for purposes of tracking individuals. The brand appears as a white mark on their bare skin and can last for decades.

Immediately after the freeze branding iron is removed from the skin, an indented outline of the brand will be visible. Within seconds, however, the outline will disappear and within several minutes after that, the brand outline will reappear as swollen, puffy skin. Once the swelling subsides, for a short time, the brand will be difficult or impossible to see, but in a few days, the branded skin will begin to flake, and within three to four weeks, the brand will begin to take on its permanent appearance.
==Horse branding regulations==

In Australia, all Arabian, Part Bred Arabians, Australian Stock Horses, Quarter Horses, Thoroughbreds, must be branded with an owner brand on the near (left) shoulder and an individual foaling drop number (in relation to the other foals) over the foaling year number on the off shoulder. In Queensland, these three brands may be placed on the near shoulder in the above order. Stock Horse and Quarter Horse classification brands are placed on the hindquarters by the classifiers.

Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds in Australia and New Zealand are freeze branded. Standardbred brands are in the form of the Alpha Angle Branding System (AABS), which the United States also uses.

In the United States, branding of horses is not generally mandated by the government; however, there are a few exceptions: captured Mustangs made available for adoption by the BLM are freeze branded on the neck, usually with the AABS or with numbers, for identification. Horses that test positive for equine infectious anemia, that are quarantined for life rather than euthanized, will be freeze branded for permanent identification. Race horses of any breed are usually required by state racing commissions to have a lip tattoo, to be identified at the track. Some breed associations have, at times, offered freeze branding as either a requirement for registration or simply as an optional benefit to members, and individual horse owners may choose branding as a means by which to permanently identify their animals. As of 2011, the issue of whether to mandate horses be implanted with RFID microchips under the National Animal Identification System generated considerable controversy in the United States.

==Symbols and terminology==

Most brands in the United States include capital letters or numerals, often combined with other symbols such as a slash, circle, half circle, cross, or bar. Brands of this type have a specialized language for &quot;calling&quot; the brand. Some owners prefer to use simple pictures; these brands are called using a short description of the picture (e.g., &quot;rising sun&quot;). Reading a brand aloud is referred to as “calling the brand“. Brands are called from left to right, top to bottom, and when one character encloses another, from outside to inside. Reading of complex brands and picture brands depends at times upon the owner&#x27;s interpretation, may vary depending upon location, and it may require an expert to identify some of the more complex marks.

In general, the following usage of the term &quot;symbol&quot; usually means a capital letter. Uncapitalized letters are not used. Brands are usually “read” top to bottom and left to right. There are regional variations in how brands are read, and deference is given to the terminology preferred by the owner of the brand. Terms used include:

*&quot;Bar&quot;: a short horizontal line. For example, a short horizontal line over an M or before an M would be read as &quot;Bar M&quot;. Similarly, a short horizontal line under an M or after an M would be read as &quot;M Bar&quot;. The bar can also be through the middle of the symbol and would be read as &quot;Bar M&quot;.
**&quot;Rail&quot; is alternative terminology to &quot;bar&quot; in some areas referencing a long horizontal line. For example, a long horizontal line over a M or before an M would be read as &quot;Rail M&quot;. Similarly, a long horizontal line under a M or after a M would be read as &quot;M Rail&quot;.

*&quot;Box&quot;: a symbol within a square or rectangle or a square or rectangle by itself. A box with a P inside of it would be read as &quot;Box P&quot;.

*&quot;Circle&quot;: a symbol within a circle, or a circle by itself. A circle with a C inside of it would be read as &quot;Circle C&quot;.
**&quot;Half Circle or Quarter Circle&quot;: a half or quarter circle above or below a symbol, but not touching the symbol. A K with a half circle above it, open side facing up, would be read as &quot;Half Circle K&quot;. A K with a half circle below it, open side facing down, would be read as &quot;K Half Circle&quot;. See Rocking below if the circle touches the symbol.

*&quot;Crazy&quot;: An upside down symbol. An upside down R would be read as &quot;Crazy R&quot;.

*&quot;Cross&quot;: a plus sign. +

*&quot;Diamond&quot;: a symbol within a four sided box, the box tilted 45 degrees or a four sided box tilted 45 degrees by itself. The box sides are of equal length, and the box can be square or taller in height than in width, or greater in width than in height. A rafter can also be read as a &quot;Half Diamond&quot;.

*&quot;Flying&quot;: a symbol that starts and ends with a short serif or short horizontal line attached before the left side of the top of the symbol and attached after the right side of the top of the symbol, extending to the right of the symbol.

*&quot;Lazy&quot;: Symbols turned 90 degrees. A symbol turned 90 degrees, lying on its face (or right hand side) can be read as &quot;Lazy Down&quot; or &quot;Lazy Right&quot;. Similarly, a symbol turned 90 degrees, lying on its back (or left hand side) can be read as &quot;Lazy Up&quot; or &quot;Lazy Left&quot;. could be read as &quot;Lazy 5&quot; or &quot;Lazy Up 5&quot; or &quot;Lazy Left 5&quot;.

*&quot;Over&quot;: a symbol over and above another symbol, but not touching the other symbol. An H above a P would be read as &quot;H Over P&quot;.

*&quot;Rafter or Half-diamond&quot;: Two slashes joined at the top. ∧ An R with two slashes joined at the top would be read as &quot;Rafter R&quot; 

*&quot;Reverse&quot;: A reversed symbol. would be read as &quot;Reverse K&quot;. Reverse is sometimes called &quot;Back&quot; (i.e. a backwards C would be read as &quot;Back C&quot;).
**&quot;Crazy Reverse&quot;: An upside down, reversed symbol. An upside down, reversed R would be read as &quot;Crazy Reverse R&quot;

*“Running”: a letter with a curving flare attached to the right side of the top of the letter, extending to the right, with the symbol sometimes also leaning to the right like an italic letter.

*&quot;Slash&quot;: A forward or reverse slash. / \ .

*&quot;Tumbling&quot;: a symbol tipped to the right about 45 degrees.

*&quot;Walking&quot;: a symbol with a short horizontal line attached to the bottom of the symbol, extending to the right of the symbol.

Combinations of symbols can be made with each symbol distinct, or:

*&quot;Connected&quot; or &quot;conjoined&quot;, with symbols touching. would be read as &quot;T S connected&quot; or &quot;TS conjoined&quot;.

*&quot;Combined or conjoined&quot;: symbols are partially overlaid. would be read as &quot;J K Combined&quot;.

*&quot;Hanging&quot;: a symbol beneath another symbol and touching the other symbol. The hanging nomenclature may be omitted when reading the brand, such as a H with a P below it, with the top of the P touching the bottom of the right hand side of the H would be read as &quot; H Hanging P&quot;, or just &quot;H P&quot;.

*&quot;Swinging&quot;: a symbol beneath a quarter circle, the open side of the quarter circle facing the symbol, with the symbol touching the quarter circle. For example, a H with a quarter circle over it, with the top of the H touching the quarter circle would be read as &quot;Swinging H&quot;.

*&quot;Rocking&quot;: a symbol above a quarter circle, the open side of the quarter circle facing the symbol, with the bottom of the symbol touching the quarter circle. For example, a H with a quarter circle under it, with the bottom of the H touching the quarter circle, is read as &quot;Rocking H&quot;.

==Animal welfare concerns==
Livestock branding causes pain to the animals being branded, seen in behavioural and physiological indicators. Both hot and freeze branding produce thermal injury to the skin, but hot-iron branding creates more inflammation and pain than freeze branding does. Although alternative methods of identification such as ear tags are suggested, the practice of branding is still common worldwide.

Standard hot iron branding can take about eight weeks to heal. Use of analgesics helps reduce discomfort. Topical treatments such as cooling gels helps speed healing in pigs, but results are less clear for cattle. Common concerns include how long the animal is restrained, size and location of the brand, and whether analgesics are applied for pain relief. A 2018 study in Sri Lanka, where hot-iron branding is illegal but still widely practiced, concluded that it impairs animal welfare and that there is no real way to improve the procedure. However, this particular study looked at four small dairy farms that used a technique where multiple applications of irons (“drawing”) created large brands extended across the ribs and took at least a full minute to apply and 10 weeks to heal. In contrast, in nations such as the United States and Australia, pre-shaped brands are used to stamp the brand on an animal, applied for 1-5 seconds. Although branding is painful, from a welfare perspective, stamping is preferable over drawing, as less time is needed to apply the brand.

<text>The Handley Page V/1500 was a British night-flying heavy bomber built by Handley Page towards the end of the First World War. It was a large four-engined biplane, which resembled a larger version of Handley Page&#x27;s earlier O/100 and O/400 bombers, intended to bomb Berlin from East Anglian airfields. The end of the war stopped the V/1500 being used against Germany, but a single aircraft was used to carry out the first flight from England to India, and later carried out a bombing raid on Kabul during the Third Anglo-Afghan War. It was colloquially known within the fledgling Royal Air Force as the &quot;Super Handley&quot;.
The V/1500 which was shipped to Canada to attempt a transatlantic flight was flown in the US, and in 1919 crash-landed in a field at Mount Jewett, Pennsylvania. Photos appeared in the 20 February 1919 issue of the &quot;Bradford Journal&quot; newspaper.

==Development and design==
The V/1500 was produced to meet a 1917 British Air Board requirement for a large night bomber capable of reaching deeper into Germany than the Handley Page O/100 which had recently entered service, carrying a 3,000 lb (1,400 kg) bombload. It was thus capable of bombing Berlin from bases in East Anglia.

While the V/1500 had a similar fuselage to that of the O/400, it had longer-span, four-bay biplane wings and was powered by four 375 hp (280 kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engines mounted in two nacelles, with two engines pulling in the conventional manner and two pushing, rather than the two Eagle engines of the smaller bomber. Construction was of wood and fabric materials. A relatively novel design feature was the gunner&#x27;s position at the extreme rear of the fuselage, between the four fins.

Owing to pressure of work at Handley Page&#x27;s Cricklewood factory and to ensure security, the first prototype was constructed by Harland and Wolff at Belfast, Northern Ireland, being assembled at Cricklewood and first flying on 22 May 1918. Orders were placed with a number of companies (including Harland and Wolff, Beardmore, Handley Page, Grahame-White and Alliance Aircraft for a total of 210 V/1500s at £12,500 apiece, although only 40 aircraft were completed, with a further 22 produced as spares. The Beardmore order was for fifty machines in two batches, the first batch was for 20 and the second batch for 30. The company accounts state production continuing into 1921.The test pilot for Beardmore was Clifford Prodger and the aircraft were delivered from Inchinnan Aerodrome (Ref Company accounts UGD 100/8/1921 University of Glasgow and Mac Kay)

==Service==


Three aircraft were delivered to No. 166 Squadron at RAF Bircham Newton (Norfolk) during October 1918. The squadron commander did not receive clear orders for his mission until 8 November, due to debate at high level. A mission was scheduled for that night (to bomb Berlin, fly on to Prague as the Austro-Hungarian forces had surrendered by then, refuel, re-arm, and bomb Düsseldorf on the way back). No mission was flown - a technical expert insisted that all the engines on one aircraft be changed. The same happened the following day (but with a different aircraft). The three aircraft were about to taxi out after the second set of engine changes when an excited ground crew member ran out to stop them — the armistice had just been declared.

One of the original batch of aircraft (serial J1936, &quot;Old Carthusian&quot;) went on to record two significant &#x27;firsts&#x27;. On 13 December 1918, the bomber, flown by Major A.C.S. Maclaren and Captain Robert Halley, accompanied by Brigadier-general N.D.K. MacEwen, made the first ever &#x27;through-flight&#x27; from England to India. Taking off from Britain the aircraft flew via Rome, Malta, Cairo, and Baghdad, finally reaching Karachi on 15 January 1919.

The same aircraft played a pivotal role in ending the Third Anglo-Afghan War. On 25 May 1919, flying from Risalpur piloted by Captain Halley and with Lt E. Villiers as observer, the V/1500 reached Kabul in three hours. Of its payload of four 112 lb (51 kg) bombs on improvised bomb racks removed from B.E.2cs and 16 20 lb (10 kg) bombs carried in the fuselage and dropped by hand, four bombs hit the royal palace. Although the bombing did little physical damage, it had a great psychological impact on the citizens - the ladies of the royal harem rushed onto the streets in terror, causing great scandal. A few days later King Amanullah sued for peace, bringing an end to the war after less than one month of hostilities. J1936 ended its life being consumed by termites.

The Handley Page V/1500 aircraft &quot;Atlantic&quot; was shipped to Newfoundland in early 1919 to attempt the first non-stop Transatlantic flight. However, the prize was won by Alcock and Brown in a Vickers Vimy in June 1919. The crew departed for New York City but was forced to land in Parrsboro, Nova Scotia on 5 July 1919 where it was repaired over the course of the summer. The &quot;Atlantic&quot; continued to New York on 9 October 1919 carrying with it the first airmail from Canada to the United States.

They were eventually replaced in service by the Vickers Vimy.

==Survivors==

No complete example of the V/1500 remains; however, the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford holds several relics in store, including three propellers, four sections of tailplane and a compass

==Political career==
===38th Parliament===
In his first election in 2004, Bains won the Liberal nomination for the riding of Mississauga—Brampton South, and won the seat with over 57% of the total vote; beating his next nearest opponent by over 33%, or over 14,000 votes. At that time, Bains was 26 years old and the youngest Liberal MP in Parliament.

Bains was elected chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Development of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade in April 2005, and held it until October 7, 2005, when he became parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, which at the time was Paul Martin. As parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, Bains was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council, and served until February 5, 2006, the day before the Conservative government of Stephen Harper was sworn in after the 2006 federal election.

In October 2005, Bains also became a member of the Red Ribbon Task Force that released a 2006 report on revitalizing the party organization.

===In opposition===
In 2006, Bains was re-elected in his riding with just under 54% of the vote.

Also in 2006, Bains co-chaired the Liberal Party of Canada (Ontario)&#x27;s annual general meeting Toronto. Because of his position in the Party and the roles he has been given, Bains was seen as a rising star, and had been selected three years in a row in the Hill Times survey as the best up and comer.

During the 2006 Liberal leadership convention to replace Paul Martin, Bains threw his support behind Ontario Education Minister Gerard Kennedy, and after Kennedy dropped out before the third ballot, he joined Kennedy in supporting the eventual winner and new party leader, Stéphane Dion.

In the 39th Parliament, Bains held Official Opposition critic portfolios for Public Works and Government Services, the Treasury Board and International Trade, respectively. Bains was also member of the Liberal Caucus Committees for Planning and Priorities, Canada and the World and Economic Prosperity. In January 2007, he was appointed to the National Election Readiness Committee as a Caucus Representative and in March 2007 served as the Youth Liaison to the Young Liberals of Canada.

In January 2009, he was selected by Michael Ignatieff along with Steve MacKinnon to serve as Co-Chairs of the Special Committee on Party Renewal and tasked with heading a consultation process with the party membership on how to strengthen the party. In March 2009, Bains was appointed Chair of Platform Development and oversaw the creation of the party&#x27;s next electoral platform. As part of his recommendations for party renewal, delegates at the 2009 Liberal leadership election voted to ensure that all future leadership elections would be under a &quot;weighted one member, one vote&quot; system, where each riding has 100 points that are distributed to leadership candidates based on the percentage of votes from party members in that riding.

During the 40th Parliament, Bains held Official Opposition critic portfolios for Natural Resources and Small Business and Tourism.

In January 2011, Bains claimed that the Bloc Québécois was using &quot;the politics of fear&quot; and argued against their attempt to ban the ceremonial Sikh kirpan from the parliamentary buildings after an incident in which the Quebec National Assembly denied entry to a group of four kirpan-wearing Sikhs.

===Out of Parliament===
In the 2011 federal election, Eve Adams, a former Mississauga City Councillor, beat Bains by over 5,000 votes.

Bains was a director of the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation from September 2012 to September 2015. He also served on the Ontario Provincial Board of the Heart and Stroke Foundation, including a stint as Vice Chair starting December 2014. Bains is also on the board of advisors for the Pearson Centre for Progressive Policy.

Bains also entered academia and became an adjunct lecturer in a Master of Public Service program at the University of Waterloo and a distinguished visiting professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management at Ryerson University, starting in 2013 for a one-year term. His teaching contract at Ryerson was extended, and he was still a professor at the time of his re-election in 2015.

Bains was touted as a possible candidate in the 2014 municipal election in Brampton and was included in January 2014 polling alongside candidates like Susan Fennell and John Sanderson in which he finished third among voters polled. Provincial Liberal Linda Jeffrey subsequently ran for mayor and won.

===Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry===

Bains was the Ontario co-chair for the federal Liberal campaign, and was returned to the House of Commons in the 2015 federal election in the new riding of Mississauga—Malton. On November 4, 2015, he was appointed the minister of innovation, science and economic development in Justin Trudeau&#x27;s Cabinet. The next day, Bains announced that the mandatory long form census would be restored for 2016, after it was removed from the 2011 edition under the Harper government. Under Bains’ leadership, the 2016 Census response rate exceeded 98 percent, making it the most successful Census since 1666.

A major focus of Bains’ mandate is to spur innovation and economic development in Canada. Following public consultations across Canada in the summer of 2016, he launched the Inclusive Innovation Agenda. Based on the consultations, the Bains identified three priority areas for Canada&#x27;s Innovation Agenda: finding better ways for more Canadians to get the skills the global economy demands (People), harnessing emerging tech that would create industries and jobs that never existed before as well as reinvigorate existing ones (Technology), and encouraging more Canadians to start and grow companies that are competitive in the global economy (Companies).

His portfolio also includes responsibility for the six regional development agencies across Canada: Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA); Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions (CED); Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency (CanNor); Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario); Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario (FedNor); Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD).

In December 2016, he also launched Connect to Innovate, a program that will invest $500 million to bring high-speed Internet to rural and remote communities across Canada. In 2018, Bains announced $950 million for a variety of national superclusters of innovation across the country. To date, Minister Bains has supported 37 projects, investing $389 million, leading to nearly $4.1 billion in total investments in the automotive sector. Bains locked in the manufacturing of the C-Series in Montréal, protecting 6,000 direct jobs in Ontario and Québec in the aerospace industry. He also launched Canada&#x27;s first-ever Intellectual Property Strategy.
Bains worked closely with the Advisory Council on Economic Growth, which advised the minister of finance on economic policies to achieve long-term sustainable growth. The council called for a gradual increase in permanent immigration to Canada to 450,000 people a year.

In 2019, Minister Bains announced Canada&#x27;s Digital Charter.

In August 2020, amidst a review of an August 2019 decision by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to reduce capacity rates by up to 43% and access rates up to 77%, Bains released a statement saying that the government shared the fears of Canada&#x27;s big telecommunication corporations that it went too far and would disincentivize investment in communication networks, especially less profitable rural and remote areas. However, the statement also said that the government would not formally intervene in the ongoing review.

==== COVID-19 ====
In August 2020, Bains and Minister of Public Services and Procurement Anita Anand, announced major steps towards securing COVID-19 vaccine and therapies. Bains also announced the members of the COVID-19 Therapeutics Task Force and COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force (VTF). Nancy Harrison and Cédric Bisson are co-chairs of the Therapeutics Task Force (TTF) tasked with prioritizing &quot;financial support for promising COVID-19 treatment projects.&quot; The secretariat of the Therapeutics Task Force is housed at Bains&#x27; ISEDC department. Joanne Langley and J. Mark Lievonen are the co-chairs Vaccine Task Force advising the federal government on &quot;vaccine development, related bio-manufacturing and international partnerships&quot;. The secretariat of the Vaccine Task force is supported by the National Research Council of Canada. Potential members of the Joint Biomanufacturing Subcommittee of the COVID‐19 Vaccine Task Force and Therapeutics Task Force Meeting began meeting on June 22, 2020, to examine initial proposals from Laval, Quebec-based-Biodextris, Calgary, Alberta-based-Providence Therapeutics, Edmonton, Alberta-based-Entos Pharmaceuticals, Montréal-based Glycovax Pharma, Vancouver-based-Precision Nanosystems, Vancouver-based Symvivo Incorporated, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia-based IMV, Quebec City-based Medicago Inc., and Maryland-based Novavax. On June 25 they began their reviews of proposals submitted by AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Variation Biotechnologies (VBI). On July 3 they reviewed Moderna&#x27;s proposal. Later in July they reviewed Novavax and Johnson &amp; Johnson, and in September Sanofi / GSK. The first announcements of approvals began on August 5 for Pfizer and Moderna and the [rest?] of the approvals were announced in October 2020.

===Legislation===
Bains introduced legislation to amend the &quot;Copyright Act&quot; with respect to improving access to works by persons with a perceptual disability, which subsequently received Royal Assent in June 2016, thus enabling Canada to become the key 20th nation to accede to the Marrakesh Treaty, bringing the Treaty into force on September 30, 2016. He also put forward bill C-25, proposing to amend federal corporate law to promote corporate transparency and increase diversity on corporate boards. In particular, the bill focuses on the participation of women on corporate boards, as well as on senior management teams. In the same Parliamentary session, Bains introduced bill C-36, intended to enhance, reinforce and protect the independence of Statistics Canada, fulfilling a campaign promise from the Liberals 2015 election platform. In June 2018, both bills C-25 and C-36 received Royal Assent.

==Personal life==
Bains currently resides in Peel with his wife, Brahamjot, with whom he has two daughters

== Recognition ==
&quot;The Hill Times&quot; featured Bains on the cover of their &quot;Power &amp; Influence&quot; magazine in 2017. Dubbed the ‘Minister of Everything’ in the article, he was ranked 4th most influential, behind Justin Trudeau, Katie Telford and Gerald Butts. On April 7, 2017, CFIB&#x27;s Executive Vice-President and Chief Strategic Officer Laura Jones presented Bains with a Golden Scissors Award&quot; as a symbolic gesture of cutting through red tape shortly after Bains announced the interprovincial legislation entitled the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA). He is a recipient of Startup Canada&#x27;s Policy Prize (2017). In 2017, Bains was listed in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;&#x27;s The Power 50. He is featured as the second influencer on the 2018 Bay Street Bull Power 50 list, and Apolitical listed him among the World&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People in Digital Government.

These books are mainly focused on Christian martyrs. He has also written two more books with Michael Tait, one titled, &quot;Under God&quot;, containing stories of America&#x27;s spiritual battles, and another book called &quot;Living Under God: Discovering Your Part in God&#x27;s Plan&quot;.

He has written a fifth book called &quot;City on Our Knees&quot;. The book is about how Christians past and present have set aside differences, come together in unity, and stepped forward in action and prayer.

He is the president of the record label Gotee Records. He created the label with Todd Collins and Joey Elwood in order to produce Out of Eden&#x27;s &quot;Lovin&#x27; the Day&quot; after efforts to sign the group to an established label proved unsuccessful. &quot;We all collectively said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s just give this a shot&#x27;&quot;, Elwood recalls; &quot;Three naïve guys, a willing band, and some really good songs.&quot; The label was responsible for establishing artists such as Relient K, House of Heroes, Jamie Grace, Capital Kings, and Abandon Kansas. However, as a recording artist, he is under contract with ForeFront Records.

TobyMac has also helped establish a camp, called Camp Electric, located near Nashville, Tennessee, for young musicians who want to have pop and rock skills.

Amanda, who comes from Jamaica, is the daughter of Judy and Robert Levy (chairman of the agribusiness firm Jamaica Broilers Group), and the family regularly visits the island. His father died from dementia in 2015 after a degenerative phase, an experience which McKeehan cited as inspiration for some of his newest songwriting as of 2017.

They have had four sons and a daughter: Truett (September 4, 1998 – October 23, 2019), known as TruDog or Tru (stylized as TRU); twins Moses and Marlee, adopted at birth on April 30, 2002; Leo, (b. November 2, 2004); and Judah, (b. March 24, 2006). McKeehan&#x27;s son Moses suffers from muscular dystrophy.

<doc id="969746" wikidata="Q118904945" url="?curid=969746" title="Area code 900">
<text>Area code 900 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan for premium-rate telephone numbers. Area code 900 was installed in 1971.

Premium rate services are dialed in the format 1-900-XXX-XXXX. This is often called a 900 number or a 1 900 number (&quot;one-nine-hundred&quot;).

A call to a 900-number can result in high per-minute or per-call charges. For example, a &quot;psychic hotline&quot; may charge for the first minute and for each additional minute.

== History ==
The first 900-service known to have been used in the United States, was for the &quot;Ask President Carter&quot; program in March 1977, for incoming calls to a nationwide talk radio broadcast featuring the newly elected President Jimmy Carter, hosted by anchorman Walter Cronkite. At that time, the intent for area code 900 was as a choke exchange—a code that blocked large numbers of simultaneous callers from jamming up the long-distance network. Numbers with the 900 area code were those which were expected to have a huge number of potential callers, and the 900 area code was screened at the local level to allow only a certain number of the callers in each area to access the nationwide long-distance network for reaching the destination number. Also, the early incarnation of 900 was not billed at premium-rate charges, but rather at regular long-distance charges based on the time of day and day of week that the call was placed. The number used for the radio program was one that was specially arranged by AT&amp;T Corporation, CBS Radio, and the White House, to be free to the calling party. However, by 1980, the 900 area code was completely restructured by AT&amp;T to be the premium-rate special area code which it remains today. At that time, many evening news agencies conducted &quot;pulse polls&quot; for $0.50 per call charges and displayed results on television. One early use was by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; producers for the sketch &quot;Larry the Lobster&quot;, featuring Eddie Murphy. The comedy sketch drew nearly 500,000 calls. AT&amp;T and the producers of &quot;SNL&quot; split the profits of nearly $250,000.

Earlier, 976 numbers used 976 as a local prefix (970 or 540 in some markets, such as New York state), though it was not assigned to a specific telephone exchange. These numbers were dialed as any other number, such as 976-1234.

Initially, consumers had no choice regarding the accessibility to 900 or 976 numbers with their subscription service. However, in 1987, after a child had accumulated a bill of $17,000, the California Public Utilities Commission subsequently required telephone companies to give customers the option of preventing the dialing of premium-rate numbers.

From the early 1980s through the early 1990s, it was common to see commercials promoting 1 (900) numbers to children featuring such things as characters famous from Saturday morning cartoons to Santa Claus. Due to complaints from parent groups about kids not knowing the dangers and high cost of such calls, the FTC enacted new rules and such commercials directed at children ceased to air on television as of the mid-1990s.

Using 900-numbers for adult entertainment lines was a prevalent practice in the early years of the industry. This practice continues, along with the use of these numbers for things such as software technical support, banking access, and stock tips. Adult entertainment 900 numbers have been largely absent from AT&amp;T and MCI since 1991. In 1992, the Supreme Court allowed a law passed by Congress that created a block on all 900 numbers that provided adult content, except for those consumers who requested access to a specific number in writing. The law killed the adult 900 number business, which moved over to 800 numbers, where billing had to be done by credit card.

Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Hotline was a lucrative 900 number in the 1990s. Other early leaders in amassing huge volumes of revenue were the New Kids on the Block and Dionne Warwick&#x27;s Psychic Friends Network.

== Regulations ==
Consumers in the US have specific rights regarding 900 number calls, as laid down by the Federal Trade Commission, such as the right to a disclaimer at the beginning of the call and a subsequent 3-second hang-up grace period, the ability to contest billing errors, a prohibition on marketing to children, and a requirement that telecommunication companies must allow the consumer to block dialing to 900 numbers. US telephone companies are prohibited from disconnecting local service as a means to force payment for 1 (900) calls. Furthermore, in 2002, AT&amp;T withdrew from billing their customers for the fee structures. This was followed by other companies throughout the decade until 2012, when Verizon, the final hold-out, also withdrew from passing on the charges.

Various attempts have been made by vendors to circumvent these protections by using Caribbean or other international numbers outside Federal Communications Commission jurisdiction to bill US telephone subscribers; the former +1 (809) countries were popular as their North American Numbering Plan format numbers look domestic but are not. The 101XXXX dial-around prefixes were also briefly the target of abuse by premium number providers posing as inter-exchange carriers, a practice which has now been stopped. A loophole which allowed US (but not Canadian) providers in toll-free area code 800 to bill for calls by claiming the subscriber agreed to the charges has also been largely closed by more stringent regulation.

<text>Kiwalik (sometimes written &quot;Keewalik&quot;) is an unincorporated community in the Northwest Arctic Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is located where the Kiwalik River flows into Kotzebue Sound on the Seward Peninsula, south of Kotzebue.

Kiwalik was once a small community that supported mining operations at Candle, away on the Kiwalik River, by Candle Creek. It is now used only by subsistence hunters and travelers who stop to use the public shelter cabin on the public road (Kiwalik-Candle route) to access the graveyard, which is surrounded by private property. The community is now abandoned and dilapidated, filled with rusty hulks, trash and broken down buildings.

The Kiwalik river area is often featured on the National Geographic Channel series Life Below Zero as one of the places the Hailstone family visits for hunting and gathering, thus demonstrating the subsistence skills necessary for life in this landscape and climate.

==Demographics==

Kiwalik first reported on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated Inuit village of &quot;Kugalukmute.&quot; It did not appear on the census again until 1930, when it reported as &quot;Keewalik.&quot; It reported again as Keewalik in 1940. It has not reported separately since.

The &quot;Kugalukmute&quot; were the people on the Kuguruk river, (kugurukmuit) the river just to Kiwalik rivers west.

Kotzebue Sound is located in the transitional climate zone, which is characterized by long, cold winters and cool summers. The average low temperature during January is ; the average high during July is . Temperature extremes have been measured from to . Snowfall averages , with total precipitation of per year. Kotzebue Sound is ice-free from early July until early October.

The towns of Kotzebue, Kiwalik and Deering are on the shores of Kotzebue Sound. Kotzebue Sound was explored and named in 1816 by Baltic German Lieutenant Otto von Kotzebue while searching for the Northeast Passage in the service of Russia.

==Fauna==
A wide variety of birdlife is apparent at Kotzebue Sound including the tufted puffin, black-throated diver and red-throated loon.

The sound is a location for the presence of the polar bear, &quot;Ursus maritimus&quot;; in fact, the world&#x27;s record largest polar bear at 2,210 pounds (1,002 kg) was observed at Kotzebue Sound in 1960.

<doc id="969761" wikidata="Q902101" url="?curid=969761" title="Dark Kingdom">
<text>The is a group of fictional characters in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga series by Naoko Takeuchi. They are the chief villains of the first story arc in every version of the series, and were first introduced in the first chapter of the manga, &quot;Usagi – Sailor Moon&quot;, originally published in Japan&#x27;s &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; on 28 December 1991. In the DIC English adaptation, the Dark Kingdom&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Negaverse&quot;.

In each variation of the series, the characters—led by Queen Beryl—attempt to steal life energy from humans and the Silver Crystal so they can release the evil Queen Metaria, who was imprisoned by Queen Serenity during the destruction of the Moon Kingdom during the Silver Millennium period.

==Creation and conception==
The Dark Kingdom is first referenced in Naoko Takeuchi&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, which features Sailor Venus as the main character, who confronts a group of villains called the Dark Agency. In the final volume of &quot;Codename: Sailor V&quot;, the Dark Agency is revealed to be a subset of the Dark Kingdom, which leads to the beginning of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;. Takeuchi developed the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series and the Dark Kingdom when &quot;Codename: Sailor V&quot; was first proposed for an anime adaptation. The idea was ultimately dropped, but Sailor Venus became part of a new group alongside Sailors Moon, Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter, and instead of fighting the Dark Agency, they fought the Dark Kingdom.

The names of Queen Beryl and the Four Kings of Heaven are derived from minerals: beryl, jadeite, nephrite, zoisite, and kunzite. In some English adaptations, Kunzite&#x27;s name is changed to Malachite. Several villains from subsequent arcs follow this pattern of using minerals as namesakes. The Four Kings of Heaven is speculated to be based on the Buddhist gods, The Four Heavenly Kings.

In the DIC Entertainment English adaptation, the Dark Kingdom&#x27;s name is changed to the &quot;Negaverse&quot;, a portmanteau of negative and universe. Beryl and her cohorts use &quot;nega&quot; as a prefix to show their devotion to wickedness and to underscore their dimension&#x27;s inherent negativity—e.g. &quot;negapower&quot; and &quot;negahistory&quot;.

==Key figures==

===Queen Beryl===
, named after the mineral beryl, is the first main antagonist in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series. Beryl has immense magical power and uses it to channel the life energy harvested by her servants into the entity Queen Metaria. In most versions of the story, Beryl has the ability to corrupt others into her service.

Before the events of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, Beryl is a young girl on Earth during the age of the Silver Millennium. Beryl is in love with Prince Endymion, but her love is unrequited. After discovering Endymion&#x27;s relationship with Princess Serenity, she sides with Queen Metaria and is corrupted. Beryl mobilizes the Earth in a war against the Moon Kingdom, killing Endymion while he is protecting Serenity, leading to the princess&#x27; own suicide. Though killed by Sailor Venus with the Holy Moon Sword, Beryl is reborn in the 20th century, regaining the memories of her past life upon finding Queen Metaria while traveling to D-Point in the Arctic. She becomes Queen of the Dark Kingdom, communicating with Metaria while recruiting her reincarnated generals Jadeite, Nephrite, Zoisite, and Kunzite, to find the Silver Crystal. Beryl is able to summon the reincarnated Prince Endymion, Mamoru Chiba, to her side, as a lifeless thrall after he dies and is revived with a fragment of the Silver Crystal inside him. Beryl fails in her attempt to get the Silver Crystal and is killed by Sailor Venus with the Holy Moon Sword.

In the first anime adaptation, Beryl attacks Tokyo while Usagi Tsukino and the other Sailor Guardians are searching for the Moon Princess. She also kidnaps and brainwashes Mamoru to love her and to kill Usagi. But he breaks free of her control and fatally wounds Beryl. Having lost everything, Beryl begs Metaria for more power which results in Metaria possessing Beryl&#x27;s body, transforming her into an enhanced appearance. Usagi confronts the Beryl/Metaria being as Princess Serenity and a battle ensues in which Usagi obliterates Beryl along with Metaria, destroying the two for good.

In the live-action series, Jadeite and Nephrite are rivals for her affections; Zoisite is more loyal to Endymion than to her, and Kunzite sets his sights on taking Metaria&#x27;s power for himself. At one point, Beryl creates a shadow of herself, Mio Kuroki, who sets out to ruin Usagi&#x27;s reputation while being Beryl&#x27;s eyes and ears. When she learns that Mamoru Chiba was Prince Endymion, Beryl forces him to come with her by showing him that she can easily kill the Four Kings of Heaven with Nephrite as an example. Once she has the object of her desire under her services, Beryl has Jadeite implant an item in Mamoru&#x27;s body that will shorten his life when he is with Usagi. However, Mamoru still risks his life for Usagi and Beryl loses control over Metaria&#x27;s actions due to the overuse of the Silver Crystal. She is killed when her castle crumbles under the stress of a distraught Princess using the Silver Crystal to destroy Earth. However, for all her sadness, she is not alone as Jadeite stays by her side after she removes her mind-control spell on him, saying that Beryl is his master by choice.

In &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, Beryl&#x27;s role in the reboot is the same as the manga. Unlike the manga, Beryl&#x27;s demise was altered to have her necklace that maintained her existence shattered by the Holy Moon Sword wielded by Sailor Moon.

Beryl appears in the first musical, &quot;Gaiden Dark Kingdom Fukkatsu Hen&quot;, and its revision, in a similar plot to the series&#x27; first story arc. She is then revived in the semi-original musical &quot;Eien Densetsu&quot; and its revision by Sailor Galaxia, who merely uses her as a puppet to awaken Sailor Saturn. Beryl dies while protecting Sailor Moon from a stab by the evil Tuxedo Mask mud puppet, her last statement being &quot;This time I die for passion&quot;. Similarly, in &quot;Shin Densetsu Kourin&quot;, Beryl kills the evil King Endymion mud puppet to give Sailor Moon a fighting chance against Galaxia. Several times in the musical, Beryl and Sailor Pluto share the song &quot;Onna no Ronsou&quot;, which explains why betrayal by Endymion in the past killed Beryl&#x27;s emotion of love. Each time this song is played, Sailor Pluto would always begin with &quot;Because we are the same&quot; or a similar phrase.

In the anime series, her voice actress is Keiko Han. During recording, this contrast resulted in occasional fits of giggles among the cast when Han would change from Luna&#x27;s cute, catlike voice to the deep, evil tones of Beryl. Sometimes, she would accidentally play Beryl with Luna&#x27;s voice. In &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, she is voiced by Misa Watanabe. In the DIC English adaptation, she is voiced by Naz Edwards with Jill Frappier as a stand-in during a clip show in &quot;Sailor Moon R&quot;. In the Viz Media English adaptation, her voice is supplied by Cindy Robinson. In the stage musicals, Beryl has been played by two actresses: Yuri Nishina and Akiko Miyazawa (who previously played Sailor Venus). In the live-action series, she is portrayed by adult J-pop idol Aya Sugimoto.

===Queen Metaria===
 is a malignant, amorphous energy being, and the true mastermind of the Dark Kingdom. She was born as a result of an abnormality in the Sun. Like all arch-villains in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga, she is an incarnation of the final arch-villain, Chaos. While the first official English release of the manga in English spelled her name as &quot;Metalia&quot;, it was a translation error; reprints of the manga in English as well as multiple reprints in Japanese consistently depicted the character&#x27;s name spelled as &quot;Metaria&quot; in Latin letters.

Being responsible for the fall of the Silver Millennium, Metaria used her power to corrupt the majority of Earth&#x27;s population, including Beryl, whose affections towards Endymion was exploited into attacking the Moon Kingdom as Prince Endymion and Princess Serenity were to wed. The battle came to an end when Metaria was sealed away by Queen Serenity in the area of the North Pole known as D-Point. In the 20th century, Metaria summons a reborn Beryl back into her service to obtain the Silver Crystal and take its power as her own. After Endymion&#x27;s reincarnated form is captured, Metaria turns the youth into a thrall to retrieve the then powerless Silver Crystal while sacrificing Beryl in the process. When Sailor Moon&#x27;s attempted murder-suicide of Endymion restores the Silver Crystal, Metaria makes her move and absorbs the crystal while wiping out all life on Earth. But after Sailor Moon and Mamoru escape with the crystal thanks to the Sailor Guardians&#x27; sacrifice, the form eventually destroys Metaria by targeting the star mark on her forehead and then uses the Silver Crystal&#x27;s power to restore everyone to life.

In the first anime adaptation, Metaria is much the same, with a few exceptions. She eventually becomes powerful enough to resurrect on her own and takes possession of the dying Beryl, transforming into a towering goddess-like creature who is eventually destroyed by Princess Serenity.

In the live-action series, Beryl originally intends to use the Silver Crystal to control Metaria, but later learns that the gem&#x27;s power only makes Metaria stronger due to Usagi&#x27;s rage being transmitted through it. This escalates to the point where Beryl can no longer control the actions of her own Monsters and fears that Metaria may destroy everything. Metaria later transfers her will into the strongest Monster in its service. In a vain attempt to stop Metaria, Endymion takes the creature into his own body with the intent of committing suicide in order to take it with him. Instead, Metaria takes control of Endymion and uses him in an attempt to force Sailor Moon to use the Silver Crystal&#x27;s power. Metaria&#x27;s plan succeeds, but only after Sailor Moon is forced to kill Endymion and Metaria with him. Sailor Moon revives Mamoru with the Silver Crystal&#x27;s power, with Metaria gone for good.

In the anime series, her voice actresses are Noriko Uemura in the first series and Yōko Matsuoka in &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;. In the DIC English adaptation, she is voiced by Maria Vacratsis. In the Viz Media English adaptation, her voice is supplied by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. In the live-action series, she possesses Mamoru, portrayed by Jouji Shibue.

==Four Kings of Heaven==
The are the commanders of the Dark Kingdom working directly under Queen Beryl. They provide the major antagonistic force for the beginning of every version of the series.

Before the events of the series, the Four Kings of Heaven originally functioned as the four guardians of Earth&#x27;s crown prince Endymion. They were led astray during the time of the Silver Millennium, selling their souls to the Dark Kingdom and becoming Beryl&#x27;s servants. When reincarnated in the 20th century, they again fall prey to her and obey her every command, but retain a sense that they need to seek out their real master and aid him. The Sailor Guardians fight and kill the four of them, one at a time. However, they are all briefly revived near the end of the &quot;Dark Kingdom&quot; arc and are able to remember the Golden Kingdom and their time as Prince Endymion&#x27;s guardians before being turned into the stone from which their names are derived. The stones are kept by Mamoru Chiba (Endymion&#x27;s reincarnation in the present day) who uses them to call upon the spirits of the Four Kings of Heaven for advice on a situation.

In the first anime adaptation, the Four Kings of Heaven serve as Beryl&#x27;s servants and have no connection to Mamoru. Once they are killed, the four only appear in flashbacks afterward. In the DIC English adaptation, the Four Kings of Heaven served as human-like beings from the Negaverse, an alternate dimension of evil, and had only a vague understanding of human ways.

The Four Kings of Heaven appeared in several musicals. In many of them, they are paired with the Sailor Guardians. In musical adaptations of the last arc, the Four Kings are revived by Sailor Galaxia to work under her service, but in some versions, they betray her. The musical &quot;Kakyuu-Ouhi Kourin&quot; had a group that which called themselves the Neo-Four Kings of Heaven (&quot;Neo-Shiten&#x27;ō&quot;). The members of the Neo-Four Kings of Heaven were Kunzite, Hematite, Hiddenite, and Kalunite. Hematite, Hiddenite, and Kalunite looked identical to Zoisite, Nephrite, and Jadeite respectively. In &quot;La Reconquista&quot;, the Four Kings of Heaven disguise themselves as a boy band known as Pandemic 4. The group consisted of Kunza, Jed, Nephra, and Zoi. The band appeared in the Pandemic Love game, in which they used the game to drain energy for Beryl, and had one song, .

In the live-action series, their past becomes more frequently seen. In the &quot;Sailor Moon: Another Story&quot; video game, the Four Kings of Heaven appear as ghosts who help four of the Sailor Guardians get the respective gems of each of the Four Kings of Heaven when Mamoru ends up injured by the Opposito Guardians.

In &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, the &quot;Four Heavenly Kings&quot; are kept alive beyond their deaths in the manga. They rediscover their past lives but are once again brainwashed by Beryl. During the final battle, Venus reveals that the Sailor Guardians and the Four Heavenly Kings were originally lovers much like Serenity and Endymion respectively. When the Sailor Guardians manage to reach the Four Kings during the former group&#x27;s assault on D-Point, they regain their full memories before being obliterated by Queen Metaria for outliving their usefulness.

===Jadeite===
 is the first of the Four Kings of Heaven to appear. In her &quot;Materials Collection&quot;, Naoko Takeuchi describes him as &#x27;a typical beautiful person&#x27; and a ruthless, serious type. He is about 18 years old in appearance, making him the second-youngest, while in the live-action series he is the youngest. He is the head of the Dark Kingdom&#x27;s far-eastern division and is named after the mineral jadeite.

Jadeite&#x27;s mission is to track down the Silver Crystal but eventually changes to gathering life energy to awaken Metaria. He has very little interaction with the other Four Kings of Heaven. He expresses an attraction to Sailor Mars and is the first one killed when Rei uses her &quot;Akuryo Taisan&quot; technique. After Jadeite&#x27;s death, Nephrite vows to exact revenge as he preserves Jadeite&#x27;s skeleton in a glass coffin. In the later side story &quot;Casablanca Memories&quot;, Zoisite also tries to avenge Jadeite.

In the first anime adaptation, hunting energy is Jadeite&#x27;s primary mission. He uses different aliases during his missions and has his Monsters pose as different people. After Jadeite fails numerous times and at one point costing Beryl the life of Thetis (who was one of Queen Beryl&#x27;s top Monsters), Beryl gives Jadeite one final chance to destroy the Sailor Senshi or else she will have him placed in Eternal Sleep that will have his body disappear to profound darkness forever. When Jadeite fails for a final time at the airport despite claiming that he found out the identities of the Sailor Senshi, an infuriated Beryl considers it an excuse and condemns him to Eternal Sleep by freezing him in a large crystal. As the large crystal disappears to profound darkness, Beryl warns everyone present to let Jadeite&#x27;s fate be a warning to all of them. She then appoints Nephrite to be the monsters&#x27; new commander and continue the energy-gathering.

In the live-action series, Jadeite is totally subservient to Beryl, for which she rewards him with her favor, sending him on missions that range from gathering energy to spying on his fellow warriors to attacking the Sailor Guardians directly. He disappears early in the series, reverting to crystalline form due to an injury from one of his battles, but is revived by Metaria. Firmly loyal to Beryl, he rejects Endymion as his true master until the series finale, where he stays with Beryl as the castle collapses around her.

In &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, Jadeite survives the battle against Sailor Mars, but Beryl sends Nephrite to continue fulfilling their mission. In his past life, he was the love interest of Sailor Mars. Jadeite is killed by Metaria along with the other Kings of Heaven in Episode 12.

In the original Japanese series, he is voiced by Masaya Onosaka. In &quot;Crystal&quot;, he is voiced by Daisuke Kishio. In the DIC English adaptation, his name was changed to Jedite and he is voiced by Tony Daniels. In the Viz Media English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Todd Haberkorn. In the live-action series, he was portrayed by Jun Masuo and he was portrayed in the musicals by Susumu Futabashi and Yuhka Asami.

===Nephrite===
 is the second of the Four Kings of Heaven to appear. Takeuchi describes him as cocky and emotional, writing in her concept notes he will probably get himself killed right off. He is the second-oldest, estimated at 19 years old, and is in charge of the Dark Kingdom&#x27;s North American division. He is named after the mineral nephrite.

Nephrite&#x27;s primary goal is to locate the Silver Crystal, but he also takes vows to exact revenge for the death of Jadeite. He uses a female &quot;shadow&quot; of himself to attack his victims, simultaneously taking control over their bodies and draining their energy. Sailor Jupiter kills him with her &quot;Jupiter Thunderbolt&quot; technique before any harm is done.

In the first anime adaptation, Beryl appoints Nephrite to continue the energy-hunting job after placing Jadeite in Eternal Slumber. Nephrite hypothesizes to Beryl that more energy can be taken by concentrating on a single human. Establishing himself in an abandoned church, he uses intonation with the stars to detect the &quot;energy potential&quot; of individual people before attacking them when he implants the essence of one of his Monsters into a specific person&#x27;s object. Nephrite&#x27;s only disguise is , a wealthy businessman and socialite. Over the course of his missions, Nephrite inadvertently attracts the attention and affections of Usagi&#x27;s best friend, Naru Osaka, which interferes with his progress. When Nephrite discovers that Tuxedo Mask is Sailor Moon&#x27;s weakness, Beryl orders Nephrite to destroy Sailor Moon or else he&#x27;ll join Jadeite in Eternal Sleep. Despite being unable to destroy Sailor Moon, he siphons some energy from Naru to Beryl, enough to impress her. Nephrite has kept himself distant from the Dark Kingdom during his missions to the point where he doesn&#x27;t answer Beryl&#x27;s summons. The Dark Crystal he crafts to detect the Silver Crystal reacts instead to Naru&#x27;s love for him. Eventually, he comes to return her love and chooses to rescue her from Zoisite at the cost of his own life, as he is killed by the Plant Sisters.

In the live-action series, Nephrite is Jadeite&#x27;s main rival for the attention of Beryl, who considers him useless. His physical appearance is drastically changed, and he is portrayed as hot-headed and violent. Repeatedly humiliated by the Sailor Guardians, and mocked by the other Kings of Heaven, he strives to win Beryl&#x27;s favor, but she kills her as a demonstration of her power. He is then reborn in Tokyo as a normal human being with all his memories intact, getting a job at the karaoke parlor and forging a tenuous friendship with Ami Mizuno, who was compassionate toward him when she was Dark Mercury. At the end of the series, he is re-established with the other Kings of Heaven as one of Prince Endymion&#x27;s guardians.

In &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, Nephrite attempts to appeal to Beryl to take Jadeite&#x27;s place only for Zoisite to intervene. Later, when his Soul Shadow is destroyed by Usagi, Nephrite rejoins the other Kings of Heaven to threaten the Sailor Guardians. He attempts to find the Silver Crystal by using a Monster who resembles a bride. However, he is attacked by Sailor Jupiter and is forced to flee. In his past life, he was the love interest of Sailor Jupiter. He is killed by Metaria along with the other Kings of Heaven.

In the Japanese series, he is voiced by Katsuji Mori in the first series and in &quot;Crystal&quot; by Kōsuke Toriumi. In the DIC English adaptation, his name was changed to &quot;Nephlite&quot; and Maxfield Stanton, and he is voiced by Kevin Lund. In the Viz Media English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Liam O&#x27;Brien. In the live-action series he was portrayed by Hiroyuki Matsumoto, and was portrayed in the stage musicals by Toshikazu Seike and Karen Yoda.

===Zoisite===
 is the third of the Four Kings of Heaven. Of the four, his character has undergone the most drastic changes from version to version of the story. He is the youngest, at about 16–17 years of age, described by Takeuchi as the least mature and most effeminate. He manages the Dark Kingdom&#x27;s European Division and is named after the mineral zoisite.

Zoisite first mocks Nephrite after Jadeite is killed, and then cries out in anguish after Nephrite is also killed. However, he also works closely with Kunzite, sharing concerns and strategies as he works. Seeking the Silver Crystal, he uses news reports and press releases to make the population of Tokyo help with his search, then resorts to taking their energy when they fail. He is killed by Sailor Venus&#x27;s Crescent Boomerang.

In the first anime adaptation, Zoisite is Kunzite&#x27;s lover. The DIC English adaptation of the anime changed Zoisite&#x27;s gender to female in order to make his relationship with Kunzite more socially acceptable for the 1990s when very few homosexual couples were portrayed in the media. This censorship has led to a great amount of criticism since then, with some pointing out that the changes were made to force the series into a heteronormative perspective. He is introduced along with Nephrite, mocking him in each episode. At one point when Beryl spared Nephrite from Eternal Sleep due to bringing energy despite failing to take out Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask, she told Zoisite to remember his position and to focus on finding the Silver Crystal (the DIC dub had Beryl warning Zoisite that she&#x27;ll be joining Jadeite in Eternal Sleep if he questions her judgement again). Later, he orders her Monsters the Plant Sisters to kidnap Naru and kill Nephrite. The Plant Sisters succeeded in their mission. After Metaria&#x27;s awakening, Beryl appoints Zoisite to find the Rainbow Crystals, fragments of the Silver Crystal sealed within the &quot;Seven Great Monsters&quot;. He obtains the seven crystals from the hosts of the Seven Great Monsters. Mamoru saves Usagi from certain death by intercepting Zoisite&#x27;s attack. The two are then revealed to be Princess Serenity and Prince Endymion. Infuriated that Zoisite has injured Endymion, Beryl uses an attack from her scepter to fatally wound Zoisite who later dies in Kunzite&#x27;s arms.

In the live-action series, Zoisite is a pianist, using magical songs to hunt for the hidden Moon Princess. In addition to his own &quot;Requiem for a Princess&quot;, he plays such compositions as the &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; and the &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot;. He cares very little for Beryl and comes to recognize Prince Endymion as his master long before the others. After being killed by Sailor Venus and later revived by the power of Metaria, he ignores Beryl and uses his music to attempt to reach out to Endymion and to restore the memories of their collective past life to his fellow Kings of Heaven. His loyalty to Endymion is such that he offers his own life in exchange for the Prince&#x27;s, and when Beryl asks for Usagi&#x27;s life instead, Zoisite sets out to kill her. Diverted from this course of action by Endymion, he dies protecting Sailor Moon instead.

In &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, Zoisite is wounded by Usagi&#x27;s &quot;Moon Healing Escalation&quot; technique. However, Beryl nurses him back to health. He attempts to kill both Mamoru and Usagi, only for Minako and Artemis to seriously wound him again and cause him to flee. In his past life, Zoisite was the love interest of Sailor Mercury. He is killed by Metaria along with the other Kings of Heaven in Episode 12.

In the original anime series, Zoisite is voiced by Keiichi Nanba, with Masaya Matsukaze taking over the role for &quot;Crystal&quot;. In the DIC English adaptation, his name is spelled as Zoycite, and he is voiced by Kirsten Bishop as part of being depicted as a female character. In the Viz Media English adaptation, his name is spelled as Zoisite and his voice is supplied by Lucien Dodge. In the live-action seriesm he is portrayed by Yoshito Endou. In the musicals, he is portrayed by Toshitaka Akita, Misao Idono, Akira Tomemori, and Kaname Aoki.

===Kunzite===
 is the fourth and final member of the Four Kings of Heaven. He carries a shortsword, and Takeuchi describes him as having the majesty of an Arabian king. He is the oldest, at about 25–26 years old, leads the Dark Kingdom&#x27;s Mid-Eastern division, and is named after the mineral kunzite. Unlike the others, he wears a white cape in addition to his uniform, with his tunic partially opened.

Before the beginning of the series, Kunzite is a military officer of Prince Endymion before joining Beryl and dying in the battle against the Silver Millennium. He is then revived by Beryl. Introduced as Zoisite&#x27;s advisor, Kunzite becomes Beryl&#x27;s henchman after the death of the other Kings of Heaven. He defeats the Sailor Guardians at Tokyo Tower and nearly kills Usagi, but Mamoru takes the injury for her, and they are revealed to be Princess Serenity and Prince Endymion. Remembering that Endymion is his former master, Kunzite becomes uncertain about his loyalties, causing Beryl to plant a crystal in his forehead that reduces him to little more than a mindless slave. During that time, Kunzite tells Mamoru where Metaria&#x27;s weakness is.

In the first anime adaptation, Kunzite and Zoisite are lovers as well as allies. After Metaria&#x27;s reawakening, Kunzite assists Zoisite in obtaining the Rainbow Crystals. After losing the Rainbow Crystals, Kunzite is spared when Zoisite is killed at the hands of Beryl for harming Prince Endymion. She forewarns Kunzite to let what happened to Zoisite serve as a warning to him should he harm Endymion. Zoisite dies in Kunzite&#x27;s arms. He resents being forced to work with the brainwashed Endymion because he feels he is responsible for Zoisite&#x27;s death and because of Beryl favoring him. Following Zoisite&#x27;s death, Kunzite plans to exact revenge on the Sailor Guardians and turns humans into Monsters to help him. Eventually, he captures all of the Sailor Guardians except for Sailor Moon. Kunzite is killed when Usagi reflects his own energy blade back at him as he tells Zoisite to wait for him on the other side.

In the live-action series, Kunzite is first introduced in the form of an amnesiac man named Shin, whom Usagi attempts to befriend. His memories are restored by Beryl, causing him to be a ruthless and powerful warrior. His efforts to reawaken Metaria are largely motivated by a desire for personal gain, and he is dismissive to Beryl, sometimes to the point of insubordination. He mostly works with her toward their shared goals, and he also transforms Sailor Mercury into Dark Mercury. Kunzite is awakened early on to the memory that Endymion was his master in his previous life, but he feels extreme contempt for the prince, believing he betrayed the Four Kings of Heaven in ages past and left them for dead. Eventually, at the cost of his life, he saves Endymion from an attack by Jadeite and professes his loyalty to the prince.

In &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, Kunzite turns off Tokyo&#x27;s power to provoke Minako into attacking him. However, he flees with Mamoru and is rejoined by the other Four Kings of Heaven. In his past life, he was the love interest of Sailor Venus, a fact which Venus desperately tries to remind him of each time they face off. In his last moment prior to being killed by Metaria along with the other Kings of Heaven, he manages to briefly acknowledge that he returns Venus&#x27;s love.

In the original Japanese series, he is voiced by Kazuyuki Sogabe until episode 44 of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, and by Eiji Takemoto in all media following &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;. In the DIC English adaptation, his name was changed to &quot;Malachite&quot; and he is voiced by Denis Akiyama with John Stocker as a stand-in during a clip show in &quot;Sailor Moon R&quot;. In the Viz Media English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Patrick Seitz. In the live-action series, he is portrayed by Akira Kubodera. Kunzite was portrayed in the stage musicals by Yūta Mochizuki, Ryuji Kasahara, Hideka Asano, and Miki Kawasaki.

==Servants==
===Prince Endymion===

In the manga, the first anime adaptation, and &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, Beryl discovers that Mamoru Chiba is the reincarnated Prince Endymion after being revived by a fragment of the Silver Crystal that entered his body. Beryl uses her magic to turn him into a thrall of the Dark Kingdom and has him assume the identity of Endou to aid her in her scheme to locate the Sailor Guardians&#x27; base and steal the Silver Crystal. Sailor Moon manages to break Beryl&#x27;s hold over Mamoru in the final battle.

In the live-action series, Endymion willingly takes Queen Metaria into his body in order to kill himself and finish her, but she takes control of his body until Sailor Moon kills him, defeating Metaria for good and reviving Endymion afterward.

===Dark Mercury===

In the live-action series, Kunzite attempts an experiment in which he turns one of the Sailor Guardians evil. In Act 20, he kidnaps Ami Mizuno, who at the time is the loneliest and most vulnerable member of the team, and exposes her to Queen Metaria&#x27;s energies, changing her into an evil alter ego called Dark Mercury. A black motif is added to her uniform, and she uses &quot;dark&quot; powers and an icicle sword. Kunzite keeps her fairly close, being careful to withdraw her whenever Sailor Moon attempts healing but takes advantage of her newly-sadistic personality by allowing her to attend school and antagonize Usagi. While a part of the Dark Kingdom, Mercury is as arrogant as her allies but extends a small amount of kindness to Nephrite. In the end, Dark Mercury almost kills Sailor Moon, but the knowledge that she has injured her friend reverts Ami back to her true form.

===Mio Kuroki===
 is a minor villain appearing only in the live-action series. On the outside, she was a new teen idol whose signature song &quot;Change of Pace&quot; had a following comparable to that of Minako Aino&#x27;s &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie.&quot; Also like Minako, she was good at volleyball and claimed to be a good friend of Usagi&#x27;s. The truth, however, was much more sinister. Mio was a &quot;shadow&quot; of Beryl, created by her and Jadeite sometime between Act 25 and Act 28. Her objectives in life were to be Beryl&#x27;s eyes and ears in the human world, to give Mamoru Chiba to Beryl, and to generally make the lives of the Sailor Guardians as miserable as possible—especially Usagi&#x27;s. Mio was the principal player in getting Mamoru Chiba into Beryl&#x27;s grasp; she also generally watched Mamoru during his time in the Dark Kingdom and mocked him and Rei about the fact that Princess Serenity will use her powers to destroy everything again. However, Mio&#x27;s treatment of Mamoru inadvertently came back to haunt her when Prince Endymion was possessed by Queen Metaria, who seemingly blasted her out of existence.

However, it turned out that the attack did not completely destroy her, and it took her four years to completely recover without Beryl&#x27;s power to help her. She returned in the Special Act and attempted to recreate the Dark Kingdom. with her as its queen and Mamoru as the king. After realizing that Mamoru would always love Usagi even when brainwashed, she transformed into her true form: a terrifying, giant black flower with sharp vines. She was finally destroyed when the Sailor Guardians, sans Mars (whom she had managed to defeat earlier on, rendering her incapacitated) performed the Sailor Planet Attack.

She was played by Alisa Yuriko Durbrow.

===Dark Agency===
In &quot;&quot;, Minako Aino faces off with the Dark Agency, a group of villains posing as a talent and idol agency. The Dark Agency manipulated idols into helping them gather energy for the Dark Kingdom. In the final volume of the manga, it is revealed that the Dark Agency was established by the Dark Kingdom. Their leader is , named after the mineral of the same name, whose real identity is Minako&#x27;s love interest Phantom Ace. After Sailor V defeats him, the group dissolves and the Dark Kingdom begins to act directly, thus leading into the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series. They are never mentioned in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga or other continuities.

==Monsters==
The are the Dark Kingdom&#x27;s army of minions in every version of the series, serving as the villain of the week in every adaptation. In the manga, only Jadeite and Nephrite use monsters to assist them in their missions where Jadeite uses Morga and Nephrite uses his Alter Ego medium. In &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot; which follows the manga more closely than its predecessor, one more monster appears as the mannequin bride (a disguise that Nephrite himself uses in the manga).

In the first anime adaptation, Jadeite, Nephrite, and some of Zoisite&#x27;s minions are real monsters, with Jadeite&#x27;s monsters taking the form of human characters (such as Morga impersonating Naru Osaka&#x27;s mother in every adaption) and Nephrite&#x27;s monsters having their essence implanted in a person&#x27;s object and emerging once the human victim had exceed their energy output. These monsters are killed either by Sailor Moon using &quot;Moon Tiara Action&quot; or by other Sailor Guardians&#x27; attacks at the end of each episode. Halfway through the season, Zoisite&#x27;s arc introduces the , the Dark Kingdom&#x27;s most powerful monsters, reincarnated in the series&#x27; current timeline as six normal human beings and one cat, whose bodies contain the fragments of the Silver Crystal known as the seven . Zoisite uses Nephrite&#x27;s Dark Crystal to transform the humans and the cat into the Seven Great Monsters. After this story arc, Kunzite also uses the crystal to transform random human characters into monsters to attack the Sailor Guardians. Monsters created from humans are returned to their human form by Sailor Moon using &quot;Moon Healing Escalation&quot; which restores the human while destroying the monster. In the DIC English adaptation, the Negaverse refers to the monsters as their &quot;servants&quot;, while the Sailor Guardians and Tuxedo Mask call them &quot;monsters&quot; or sometimes &quot;Negamonsters&quot;.

In the live-action series, the monsters serve much the same purpose as in the first anime adaptation. The monsters are portrayed by human actors in suits while two of them are computer-generated. They never speak, are never named, and are commanded by the Four Kings of Heaven. Swarms of monsters with black hooded robes begin to appear after Sailor Moon is revealed to be the Princess. These hooded-robed monsters are loyal to Metaria rather than Beryl and the Four Heavenly Kings and their abilities as Metaria&#x27;s foot soldiers include earth-swimming and fast movement. In Act 41, the remains of some of these hooded-robed monsters merge into a single, extremely strong monster. In Act 45, Queen Metaria turns the monster into her host in order to absorb every bit of energy in the world. However, Metaria is soon forced by Sailor Venus to leave her host, which is then destroyed by a group attack. This monster was capable of speech when Metaria was using it as a host. In the special act Mio Kuroki, under the alias of &quot;Queen Mio&quot;, summons a group of clown-like monsters called Pierrot.

In the musicals &quot;Gaiden Dark Kingdom Fukkatsu Hen&quot; and its revision, a new monster called is introduced. This monster disguises herself as Haruna Sakurada and acts as leader of other minor monsters. Manegin is portrayed by Kasumi Hyuug in the original musical and by Kiho Seishi in the revision. In &quot;La Reconquista&quot;, monsters are replaced by Lemures; however, despite their name, they are not related to the minions of the Dead Moon Circus. The leader of these Lemures is , who acts under Beryl&#x27;s direct command. The other Lemures are unnamed. In one scene, the Lemures organize a Game Show. Baba was portrayed by Mayumi Shintani, while the other unnamed Lemures were played by Ayumi Shimozono, Asuka Yoshidome, Kumiko Saitou, Shiho Tsukagoshi, Moka Kodama, and Miki Shirai.

In the video games, several monsters from the anime make appearances as common enemies while some of the Seven Great Monsters appear as bosses. Naoko Takeuchi herself designed some new monsters for the Super Famicom video game, named HiraHira, MuchiMuchi, and GoroGoro. Manegin from the musicals also appears in other video games.

===DD Girls===

The are a group of five high-ranking monsters introduced in the first anime adaptation in Episode 45. When Beryl asks her monster subjects which of them would like to dispose of the Sailor Guardians (when they attempt to find their location) and earn their place in Dark Kingdom history, the DD Girls volunteer to kill the Sailor Guardians. They create illusions of people the Sailor Guardians care about (namely Tuxedo Mask for Usagi, Motoki Furuhata for Makoto, and Ryo Urawa for Ami) in danger or pain, to lure the Guardians into a trap. The Sailor Guardians destroy the DD Girls at the cost of their lives, ensuring that Sailor Moon reaches Beryl.

In the DiC English adaptation, their name is changed to the &quot;Doom and Gloom Girls&quot;. Episodes 45 and 46 of the original Japanese version were merged into one single episode named &quot;Day of Destiny&quot;, altering the storyline that the Doom and Gloom Girls only captured Sailor Moon&#x27;s allies, and eliminating &quot;some of the tentacle-filled violence of the original, along with most of its emotional impact.&quot;

In the first anime series, their voice actresses are Naoko Nakamura and Asako Satou. In the DIC English adaptation, they are voiced by Julie Lemieux, Nadine Rabinovitch, and Alice Poon. In the Viz Media English adaptation, they are voiced by Tara Platt and Wendee Lee.

The DD Girls appear in the &quot;Another Story&quot; video game, where they are a reincarnated Beryl&#x27;s last line of defense. They also appear as bosses in other video games.

Three DD Girls appear in the first musical, &quot;Gaiden Dark Kingdom Fukkatsu Hen&quot;, played by Hisako Doubayashi, Yuko Nishi, and Mayumi Maikuma, and in its revision, played by Yuriko Nishiyama, Kaori Ishikawa, and Ai Suzuki.

==Reception==
When analyzing the contrast between young heroines and evil older women in manga, Kathryn Hemmann noted that &quot;Queen Beryl is in no way girlish&quot; and that, while the Sailor Guardians have enormous eyes, Beryl&#x27;s &quot;are narrow and shaded.&quot; Mie Hiramoto also established a contrast between Beryl and the Sailor Guardians in an analysis of anime and intertextualities, explaining that while the Guardians use Japanese women&#x27;s language, Beryl uses the more formal Standard Japanese more frequently than any other character, which is typical of villains in other anime series. The inclusion of Beryl as an evil character in a line of dolls for girls has been described as a &quot;radical idea&quot;. While reviewing shinto, feminism and anime, author Sarah Reeves considered that Beryl&#x27;s overall misconduct and strategies are the result of a lack of husband and children. 
Author Patrick Drazen described DIC&#x27;s name change for Nephrite&#x27;s disguise, Maxfield Stanton, as &quot;ridiculously soap-opera&quot;. However, Drazen later made a later review about Nephrite&#x27;s death at the hands of Zoisite&#x27;s monsters and stated that this scene must have been an unexpected development for viewers used to happy endings. Drazen also cited Nephrite&#x27;s death in Naru&#x27;s arms as a scene of redemption, saying that him smiling and laughing during his death &quot;would have been beyond him in the past, but love is turning him human.&quot; Kotono Mitsuishi, the voice actress of Usagi Tsukino, said she was particularly touched by this sequence. Sara Roncero-Menendez from &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; stated that the homosexual relationship between Zoisite and Kunzite in the first anime adaptation was censored in the English versions by changing Zoisite&#x27;s gender from male to female. In her response to an academic essay on &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; by Mary Grigsby, author Emily Ravenwood compared Zoisite and Kunzite&#x27;s relationship with that of Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus&#x27; explaining that &quot;in both cases, the feminine and masculine attributes are highlighted with a heavy hand (deliberate display of stereotypes).&quot; According to her, Kunzite and Sailor Uranus are stoic and show no emotions, with Kunzite being hyper masculinized despite the long hair; while Zoisite &quot;is the perfect limp-wristed gay boy.&quot; In her review of the DVD+Blu-ray combo pack of the English dub for Anime News Network, writer Rebecca Silverman compared Zoisite and Kunzite to Jadeite and Nephrite, stating that the former are better strategists than the latter. In this version, Zoisite&#x27;s dub is male, and Silverman described voice actor Lucien Dodge&#x27;s job as &quot;convincingly androgynous, sounding more masculine when the character is angry, which works well.&quot; In his review of season one episode &quot;Loved and Chased! Luna&#x27;s Worst Day Ever&quot;, Michael Mammano from &quot;Den of Geek&quot; described Zoisite as &quot;perfect&quot;, even with his flaws which are &quot;always consistent and in character&quot;. The author went on by saying that Zoisite was, up to that point of the series, the most efficient of the Four Kings of Heaven, &quot;but also the only one of them to be genuinely suited to comedy when the situation calls for it.&quot;

IGN writer Meghan Sullivan reviewed most of the episodes of &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, and compared the first anime adaptation&#x27;s DIC dub to the translation of &quot;Crystal&quot;, stating &quot;the new translation makes (Beryl&#x27;s) motivation for gathering human energy much more clear, which in turn makes her look much more dangerous.&quot; However, she considered that Jadeite still looks weak in &quot;Crystal&quot;, due to the failure of his monsters. Regarding Jadeite&#x27;s demise, Sullivan hoped the writers devoted more time on the confrontation against him instead of the Sailor Guardians tracking him down, since he was supposed to be a formidable opponent. In the review of the next episode, the author described Nephrite as &quot;a more formidable opponent than his predecessor.&quot; Regarding Beryl&#x27;s flashback scenes in Act 7, Sullivan wrote that it &quot;felt a little disjointed&quot;, since it did not fully explain what Beryl was doing in the North Pole and how she managed to open the portal that leads to the Dark Kingdom. Sullivan particularly enjoyed the battle between the Four Kings of Heaven and the four Sailor Guardians in Act 10, describing it as &quot;intense.&quot; In contrast, the final showdown of these two groups in Act 12 left the author unsatisfied, since according to her most of the action happened off-screen, and finally describing their demise at Queen Metaria&#x27;s hands as &quot;frustrating.&quot; Sullivan liked the battle against Beryl more, and considered that &quot;learning that she was in love with Endymion this whole time made her feel more like a person and less like a random super villain.&quot; The final battle against Metaria was labelled by the author as &quot;everything a &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; fan could ask for,&quot; with the episode itself doing &quot;a great job establishing just how powerful Metaria has become.&quot;

In 1993, &quot;Animage&quot; made a male anime character popularity poll, in which Zoisite was the tenth most popular, and Nephrite was the joint seventeenth, tying with a character from &quot;Zettai Muteki Raijin-Oh&quot;. The first official &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; character popularity poll ranked Zoisite as the twentieth most popular character, Kunzite was the twenty third, Nephrite was twenty-fourth, Jadeite was twenty-sixth, Endou was twenty-ninth, Beryl was thirtieth and Metaria was thirty-fourth, out of thirty-eight choices. IGN placed Queen Beryl at No. 90 on their list of the 100 greatest villains of all time, noting that &quot;when the iconic theme song sings about &#x27;fighting evil by moonlight,&#x27; that evil is none other than Beryl&quot;.

<text>In baseball, an appeal play occurs when a member of the defensive team calls the attention of an umpire to an infraction that they would otherwise ignore.

==Appeal play situations==
A runner shall be called out, after a successful live ball appeal, if they:
* failed to tag up on a batted ball caught in-flight,
* failed to touch a base the last time they passed it, or
* failed to touch all previous bases in order
To properly execute a live ball appeal, a fielder must, with a live ball, tag the runner or base in question and communicate to the umpire what the infraction was and which runner committed the infraction. Such communication may be non-verbal, implicit, or assumed—so long as the intent of the fielder is clear to the umpire. Contrary to popular belief, an appeal out is not a force out unless it is regarding a missed force base. For example, if a runner from third base tags up and scores, but a runner from second base leaves too early, failing to tag up, and then is put out on the appeal, the run counts if it was scored before the appeal by the fielders. Rare situations with a viable appeal on a runner who misses his force base require the umpire to recognize an apparent fourth out.

==Legal and viable appeals==
Fielders have the right to appeal any runner at any base they have reached or passed, at any time while the ball is alive, subject to the following restrictions:
* No live ball appeal may occur on a runner who misses home base (when not forced) and immediately attempts to correct his mistake; this runner must be tagged in order to be put out. (In running or sliding for home base, if the runner fails to touch home base and makes no attempt to return to the base, appeal can be made and touching home base will suffice.)
* When a running infraction occurs and then all playing action becomes relaxed, any live ball appeal must occur before the next pitch, play, or attempted play. An appeal itself does not count as an attempted play for the purposes of subsequent appeals.
* Once a fielder properly executes a legal live ball appeal on a runner, that runner may not again be appealed at that base, even if the appeal is for a different reason.

An appeal is &quot;legal&quot; if the fielder 
* has the right to appeal a runner at a base,
* clearly communicates to the umpire what the infraction was, &quot;and&quot;
* tags the runner or base in question with a live ball.

Umpires will only rule on legal appeals. A potential appeal is &quot;viable&quot; if the appeal is legal and the umpire knows that the runner has indeed committed an infraction and will be called out if the appeal is executed by a fielder.

==Example: Multiple appeals==
Suppose that runners are on first and third base, and the batter hits a fly ball. The runner on third tags up, leaving third base immediately after the outfielder touches the ball. The runner seems to score, beating the throw home, but failing to touch home plate. The runner proceeds into his dugout without again attempting to touch home base. The runner on first base stays at first base, and action becomes relaxed while the ball is in the infield. 

The fielders now suspect that the runner left third base too early and also missed the plate. Suppose that a fielder, with the live ball, touches third base and tells the nearest umpire, &quot;I think they left too early.&quot; This is a proper legal appeal, and the umpire should rule with a safe signal, perhaps saying, &quot;No, they were fine.&quot; Now no legal appeal may again occur on that runner at third base. Suppose then that a fielder, with the live ball, touches home base and says to the nearest umpire, &quot;I think they never touched home.&quot; This is a legal and viable appeal, and so the umpire should call the runner out and direct that his run shall not count. 

Since the ball was live (and indeed must be for appeals to be legal), the runner from first could have attempted to advance at any time during the appeals. If the defense attempts to play on that runner, their opportunity to appeal the runner from third base is lost, and the run would count regardless of any subsequent attempt to appeal.

==Other appeals==
A member of the defensive team may appeal to the umpire when a batter bats out of turn. The umpire then enforces the penalty for batting out of turn, if any. The ball must be live for this as for any appeal. After the appeal is made, the umpire will usually signal &quot;Time&quot; and figure out whether the appeal is successful.

When a batter appears to have swung at a pitch, but the plate umpire calls it a ball, a member of the defensive team (by rule the manager or catcher, though the pitcher often appeals and is usually recognized) may appeal for information from a base umpire with a better view of the pitch on whether the batter swung. The field umpire then signals whether the batter swung, and such a judgment must, by rule, prevail. The umpire asked is usually the first-base umpire (or third-base, if the batter is left-handed). The plate umpire is not required to ask for assistance if they believe the request is making a farce of the game. If the bat barely left the shoulder of the batter and the catcher appeals the &quot;no-swing&quot; call, the umpire will probably deny the appeal. This procedure was introduced because it is commonplace for a plate umpire to be unable to see some swings. A manager may ask an umpire to request assistance on other plays where another umpire had a better view, but the umpire is not required to do so. Such requests are common when a close home run or foul ball call is disputed, or when determining the accuracy of a close catch or no catch call. 

An appeal may be executed if a fair ball becomes dead by leaving the playing field or becoming unplayable (home run, ground rule double, wild throw into stands/dugout, stuck in fence, drunk fan runs onto the field and steals the ball, etc.) if the defense believes a baserunner failed to touch a base before touching the next base to which they are entitled. For example, if the batter hits a ball which goes over the outfield fence in fair territory (whether a home run or ground rule double) but fails to touch first base before touching second base, they may not return to first base to correct his mistake once they have touched second, and they are out at first base if the defensive team appeals. In such a case, the plate umpire would put a new ball in play, and after the ball became live by rule, the defense could appeal the missed base. Again, the ball must be live.

In U.S. high school games or other games governed by NFHS rules, the defense may execute any of the live ball appeals above during a dead ball by simply communicating the infraction to the umpire, so it is never necessary to attempt a live ball appeal; it is always safer for the defense to ask for time to make the ball dead, and then make any requests to the umpire.

<text>Damon Jerome Keith (July 4, 1922 – April 28, 2019) was a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and a former United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Keith died in office at age 96.

==Education and career==

Keith was born and grew up in Detroit, Michigan, where he graduated from Northwestern High School in 1939. Keith then moved on to West Virginia State College where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1943. He served in the United States Army from 1943 to 1946. He then attended Howard University School of Law where he received a Bachelor of Laws in 1949, and Wayne State University Law School where he received a Master of Laws in 1956. He was in the private practice of law in Detroit from 1950 to 1967. He was an attorney in the Office of the Friend of the Court in Detroit from 1951 to 1955. In 1964 Keith was elected co-chair of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission with John Feikens and was a key player in the tumultuous times following the Detroit race riots.

===Personal===

Keith married Rachel Boone in 1953 and they had three daughters. Rachel died on January 4, 2007. Keith died on April 28, 2019, at his home in Detroit, at the age of 96. The cause was complications from leukemia and cardiovascular disease.

==Federal judicial service==

At the suggestion of United States Senator Philip Hart, Keith was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on September 25, 1967, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan vacated by Judge Thomas Patrick Thornton. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 12, 1967, and received his commission the same day. He served as Chief Judge from 1975 to 1977. His service was terminated on November 22, 1977, due to his elevation to the Sixth Circuit.

Keith was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on September 28, 1977, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated by Judge Wade H. McCree. He was confirmed by the Senate on October 20, 1977, and received his commission on October 21, 1977. He was a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1975 to 1978. He assumed senior status on May 1, 1995.

==Memberships and honors==

In 1974, Keith was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP. Keith is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. In 2008, Keith received an honorary doctorate in law (Legum Doctor) from Harvard University.

==Notable cases==

In &quot;United States v. Sinclair&quot; (1971), Keith famously ruled that Nixon&#x27;s Attorney General John N. Mitchell had to disclose the transcripts of illegal wiretaps that Mitchell had authorized without first obtaining a search warrant. Keith&#x27;s decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court&#x27;s landmark decision in &quot;United States v. U.S. District Court&quot; (1972) (also known as &quot;the Keith case&quot;) contributed in 1978 to president Jimmy Carter signing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). That decision is commemorated as a &quot;Michigan Legal Milestone&quot; called &quot;the Uninvited Ear&quot; and erected by the State Bar of Michigan.

In &quot;Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft&quot; (2002), Keith, writing for a unanimous panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, found that absolute closure of deportation hearings in &quot;special interest&quot; cases was unconstitutional. Under the authorization of Attorney General John Ashcroft, Chief Immigration Judge Michael Creppy told all immigration judges to close to the public and media all hearings associated with immigration that were thought to be related to September 11 investigation. These cases were advised to be handled in seclusion, &quot;closed off from the public&quot;, and were held in special interest of national security. Officials terminated public records of the case and removed them from the court&#x27;s docket. This rule of closed deportation hearings became known as the &quot;Creppy directive&quot;.
Members of the press and public filed two of the cases challenging the Government&#x27;s closure of removal proceedings. The plaintiffs in those cases are (1) the Detroit Free Press, Inc. and Herald Co., Inc. (d/b/a the &quot;Ann Arbor News&quot;) (the &quot;free press plaintiffs&quot;) and (2) the Detroit News, Inc., Congressman John Conyers, Jr., and Metro Times, Inc. (the &quot;&quot;Detroit News&quot; plaintiffs&quot;); the two are collectively the &quot;newspaper plaintiffs&quot;. The third case, filed by the ACLU of Michigan representing Rabih Haddad (&quot;Haddad&quot;), one of the men against whom the government had instituted removal proceedings stated that Haddad, a native of Lebanon, resided in Ann Arbor, Michigan, off and on since 1988. Haddadd came to the United States in 1998 on six-month tourist visas. On December 14, 2001, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (&quot;INS&quot;) took Haddad into custody for overstaying his visa and initiated removal proceedings in Detroit before Immigration Judge Elizabeth Hacker.

==Prominent clerks==

Keith has been called a father-figure to former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, who previously clerked for him. He administered the oath of office to her in both 2003 and 2007.
Former law clerks also include:
* Lani Guinier, the first African-American woman to gain tenure at Harvard Law School
* Judge Eric L. Clay, who later served with Judge Keith on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
* Ronald Machen, the former United States Attorney for the District of Columbia
* David C. Simmons, the current Chief Administrative Law Judge of the District of Columbia Commission on Human Rights, professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center, and former Athletic Director of Howard University
* Constance L. Rice, prominent civil rights activist and co-founder of the Advancement Project
* Rashad Hussain, Deputy Associate Counsel to President Barack Obama, and the U.S. representative to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference
* Jocelyn Benson, Michigan Secretary of State and former dean of Wayne State University Law School
* Daniel Abebe, Dean of Columbia Law School, Deputy Dean of the University of Chicago Law School and professor of law.
* Jonathan J. C. Grey, judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan

==Legacy==

Keith donated his personal papers to the Walter P. Reuther Library in 1994. The materials come from milestones in his career, including his precedent-setting judicial decisions, his commitment to equality for all in the American justice system, and the many forms of recognition he received for his dedication to civil rights and Detroit.

His estate made a $100,000 bequest to a scholarship fund in his name at West Virginia State University.

&quot;Walk with Me: The Trials of Damon J. Keith,&quot; directed by Jesse Nesser, tells the story of Keith&#x27;s life. It made its world premiere at Michael Moore&#x27;s Traverse City Film Festival in 2016.

<doc id="969766" wikidata="Q929523" url="?curid=969766" title="Dave Batters">
<text>David Batters (July 12, 1969 – June 29, 2009) was a Canadian businessman and politician. Batters was a member of the Conservative Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Palliser from 2004 to 2008.

==Early life and career==
Born in Estevan, Saskatchewan, Batters worked in the health care field as a pharmaceutical representative with Pfizer Inc., and as a political assistant to Grant Devine. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in political studies from the University of Saskatchewan.

==Political career==
Batters was a supporter of the Tackling Violent Crime Act (Bill C-2), which sought tougher penalties for gun crimes and impaired driving and provided new ways to detect drug impaired driving. Batters successfully pressured the federal Liberal government during his term to reclassify crystal meth as a Schedule 1 drug (the most serious category) under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Batters&#x27; efforts also helped to secure $15 million in federal funding for the Moose Jaw Multiplex project and to secure the safe return of Saskatchewan residents from New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. In March 2006, he questioned Health Canada on its strategy concerning Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, which he believed was more prominent in First Nations communities and would be beneficial to distribute pamphlets on FASD to people on reserves in their childbearing years. At the beginning of 2008, he urged the president of Telefilm Canada not to fund films that were objectionable and supported Bill C-10.

Batters stated that one of his motivations for entering politics was the murder of his friend Michelle Lenius on November 4, 2003 by her estranged husband. In April 2008, he proposed an amendment to the Criminal Code called &quot;Michelle&#x27;s Law&quot; that would make it more difficult for anyone accused of committing a personal injury to get bail.
Batters was admitted to hospital on July 1, 2008. He announced on September 1, 2008 that he would not be running in the 2008 election because of a battle with depression that included an addiction to benzodiazepines.

==Death==
On June 29, 2009, Batters died by suicide in his Regina home, according to a release from his family. The Regina Police had arrived at his home hours earlier, after receiving a report that he was threatening to harm himself. At the time of his death, he was married to Denise Batters, who was later named to the Senate of Canada by Prime Minister Stephen Harper in 2013.

Several of his former colleagues, including Conservative MPs Tom Lukiwski, Jay Hill and Andrew Scheer and Liberal MP Ralph Goodale, paid tribute to Batters following his death. At his funeral, Harper spoke of the need for greater public understanding of, and compassion for, the struggles faced by sufferers of anxiety and depression.

<doc id="969769" wikidata="Q837803" url="?curid=969769" title="Curling at the 1924 Winter Olympics">
<text>The curling event at the 1924 Winter Olympics was contested only by men. It was the first curling event in Olympic history.

In February 2006, a few days before the start of the 2006 Winter Olympics, the International Olympic Committee ruled that the curling medals were part of the official Olympic programme in 1924, and not a demonstration event as many authoritative sources had previously claimed - the IOC itself had never done so.

This official confirmation was the culmination of an investigative campaign begun by the Glasgow-based newspaper &quot;The Herald&quot;, on behalf of the families of the eight British contestants who won the first curling gold medals. The winning team had been selected by the Royal Caledonian Curling Club, Perth.

==Medals==

Note: R. Cousin of Great Britain is listed in the Official Report as a &quot;Non-Participant&quot; and it is not known if he received a medal; however, Skip William Jackson of Great Britain is also listed in the Official Report as a &quot;Non-Participant&quot;

==Round robin results==
France, Great Britain and Sweden were the only countries to
participate. A full Swiss team is listed as attending as &quot;a Non-Participating team&quot;, indicating they withdrew before the draw.

All games were 18 ends in length.

<text>Wolfgang Menzel (21 June 179823 April 1873), German poet, critic and literary historian, was born at Waldenburg (Wałbrzych) in Silesia.

==Career overview==
He studied at the Breslau, Jena, and Bonn, and after living for some time in Aarau and Heidelberg finally settled in Stuttgart, where, from 1830 to 1838, he had a seat in the Württemberg Diet.

His first work, a clever and original volume of poems, entitled &quot;Streckverse&quot; (Heidelberg, 1823), was followed in 1824-1825 by a popular &quot;Geschichte der Deutschen&quot; in three volumes and in 1829 and 1830 by &quot;Rubezahl and Narcissus&quot;, the dramatized fairy-stories upon which his reputation as a poet chiefly rests. In 1851 he published the romance of &quot;Furore&quot;, a lively picture of the period of the Thirty Years&#x27; War; his other writings include &quot;Geschichte Europas&quot;, 1789-1815 (2 vols. Stuttgart, 1853), and histories of the German War of 1866 and of the Franco-German War of 1870-71.

From 1826 to 1848 Menzel edited a &quot;Literaturblatt&quot; in connection with the &quot;Morgenblatt&quot;; in the latter year he transferred his allegiance from the Liberal to the Conservative party, and in 1852 his &quot;Literaturblatt&quot; was revived in that interest. In 1866 his political sympathies again changed, and he opposed the particularism of the Prussian Junkers and the anti-unionism of south Germany. He died on 23 April 1873 in Stuttgart. His library of 18,000 volumes was afterwards acquired for the University of Strassburg.

Menzel was a strident opponent of innovation in poetry and in particular of Heinrich Heine.

<text>Mervyn Taylor (28 December 1931 – 23 September 2021) was an Irish Labour Party politician who served as Minister for Equality and Law Reform from 1993 to 1994 and from 1994 to 1997. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin South-West constituency from 1981 to 1997. He was the first ever Jewish cabinet minister in Ireland.

==Early life==
Taylor was born to a Jewish family in Dublin. He was educated at Zion School in Rathgar, Wesley College, Dublin and Trinity College Dublin. He later qualified as a solicitor.

==Legal practice==
He worked for Herman Good Solicitors, alongside Herman Good and future district judge Hubert Wine. Good&#x27;s involvement in the Labour Party was instrumental in Taylor getting involved in politics. Taylor later established his own firm of Taylor and Buchalter Solicitors with Don Buchalter, and practised as a solicitor for over 50 years before retiring from active practice in his 70s. He continued as a consultant to the firm of Taylor and Buchalter Solicitors for most of his 70s.

==Politics==
Taylor was elected to Dublin County Council in the 1970s, and became cathaoirleach of the council. He was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Labour Party Teachta Dála (TD) for Dublin South-West at the 1981 general election, on his third attempt. He then held the seat at every election until his retirement from politics in 1997.

He was Chairman of the Labour Party from 1987 to 1991, and Labour chief whip, from 1981 to 1988. He was assistant government chief whip from 1981 to 1982, and again from 1982 to 1987.

Taylor was a strong supporter of Israel, an unpopular cause in the Labour Party.

==Minister for Equality and Law Reform==
Taylor served two periods as Minister for Equality and Law Reform, in the 1993-94 Government under Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, and the 1994-97 Government under Taoiseach John Bruton.

===1993–1994 Government===
In January 1993, he was appointed to the newly created position of Minister for Equality and Law Reform in the Fianna Fáil–Labour coalition government led by Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach.

Legislation introduced by Taylor and enacted during his initial term of office included the Interpretation (Amendment) Act 1993 – providing for gender inclusive language in Acts of the Oireachtas, the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act 1993, the Stillbirths Registration Act 1994, Maintenance Act 1994 and the Maternity Protection Act 1994 extending maternity rights.

===1994–1997 Government===
Labour resigned from government in November 1994, and from December 1994 it was part of a new coalition government of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left formed without a new election, dubbed the Rainbow government, led by John Bruton as Taoiseach. Taylor was again appointed as Minister for Equality and Law Reform.

In 1995 Taylor was in charge of the government proposal to legislate to remove the prohibition of divorce from the constitution; he steered the relevant bills through Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. The subsequent referendum was approved by a margin of 0.5 per cent. In the course of the campaign he survived criticism of the measure directed at his Jewish faith, as well as a Supreme Court ruling that public monies could not properly be spent in promoting the government&#x27;s opinion on a referendum proposal.

===Measures introduced by Taylor and enacted by the subsequent Dáil===

Taylor also introduced two wide-ranging anti-discrimination measures: the Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill. These were struck down by the Supreme Court but revised versions were approved by the Government in the final months of Taylor&#x27;s term of office, and were ultimately published and enacted during the following Dáil term.

==Family and personal life==
Taylor was married to Marilyn Taylor (née Fisher), who is the author of numerous books for young people. They had two sons, a daughter, and eight grandchildren. Their younger son, Gideon, is chief executive officer of New York&#x27;s Jewish Community Relations Council and of the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization and is adjunct professor of law at Fordham University in New York City.

==Death and legacy==
Taylor died on 23 September 2021, aged 89. Tributes to Taylor were led by President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, describing him as &quot;one of the most gracious, unselfish and kindest members ever to serve in the Dáil&quot;. Stephen Collins, former political editor for &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, described him as &quot;a rarity in politics, a quiet man who avoided any hint of flamboyance yet made a substantial impact on the State he served during an important time of social change&quot;.

A collection of Mervyn Taylor&#x27;s papers from his time as the Minister for Equality and Law Reform is held at the National Library of Ireland.

<text>An environmental portrait is a portrait executed in the subject&#x27;s usual environment, such as in their home or workplace, and typically illuminates the subject&#x27;s life and surroundings. The term is most frequently used of a genre of photography.

By photographing a person in their natural surroundings, it is thought that you will be able to better illuminate their character, and therefore portray the essence of their personality, rather than merely a likeness of their physical features. It is also thought that by photographing a person in their natural surroundings, the subject will be more at ease, and so be more conducive to expressing themselves, as opposed to in a studio, which can be a rather intimidating and artificial experience.

== The background in environmental portraits ==
The surroundings or background is a key element in environmental portraiture, and is used to convey further information about the person being photographed.

Where it is common in studio portraiture and even in location candid photography to shoot using a shallow depth of field, thereby throwing the background out of focus, the background in environmental portraiture is an integral part of the image. Indeed, small apertures and great depth of field are commonly used in this type of photography.

=== Details in the surroundings ===
While it is often true that the background may dominate the subject, this need not necessarily be so. In fact, the details that convey the message from the surroundings can often be quite small and still be significant. The key seems to be in the symbolism expressed by various elements in the background; for instance, a baseball cap may not tell you much about your subject (unless he or she is a baseball player), but a chef&#x27;s hat gives you a lot more detail about who he is and what he does.

=== Pet environmental portraits ===
Environmental portraiture is also now a popular style adopted by those working in the field of pet photography. This is because pet portraits also benefit from the subject being seen in context or in relaxed surroundings at home.

<text>Polychrome is the &quot;practice of decorating architectural elements, sculpture, etc., in a variety of colors.&quot; The term is used to refer to certain styles of architecture, pottery, or sculpture in multiple colors.

When looking at artworks and architecture from antiquity and the European Middle Ages, people tend to believe that they were monochrome. In reality, the pre-Renaissance past was full of colour, and all the Greco-Roman sculptures and Gothic cathedrals, that are now white, beige, or grey, were initially painted in bright colours. As André Malraux stated: &quot;Athens was never white but her statues, bereft of color, have conditioned the artistic sensibilities of Europe [...] the whole past has reached us colorless.&quot; Polychrome was and is a practice not limited only to the Western world. Non-Western artworks, like Chinese temples, Oceanian Uli figures, or Maya ceramic vases, were also decorated with colours.

==Ancient Near East==
Similarly to the ancient art of other regions, Ancient Near Eastern art was polychrome, bright colours being often present. Many sculptures no longer have their original colouring today, but there are still examples that keep it. One of the best is the Ishtar Gate, the eighth gate to the inner city of Babylon (in the area of present-day Hillah, Babil Governorate, Iraq). It was constructed in by the order of King Nebuchadnezzar II on the north side of the city. It was part of a grand walled processional way leading into the city. Its colours are as rich as they were back in the day because the walls were made of glazed brick.

Many Ancient Near Eastern sculptures were painted too. Although they are grey today, all the Assyrian reliefs that decorated royal palaces were painted in highly saturated colours.
==Ancient Egypt==
Thanks to the dry climate of Egypt, the original colours of many ancient sculptures in round, reliefs, paintings, and various objects were well preserved. Some of the best preserved examples of ancient Egyptian architecture were the tombs, covered inside with sculpted reliefs painted in bright colours or just frescos. Egyptian artists primarily worked in black, red, yellow, brown, blue, and green pigments. These colours were derived from ground minerals, synthetic materials (Egyptian blue, Egyptian green, and frits used to make glass and ceramic glazes), and carbon-based blacks (soot and charcoal). Most of the minerals were available from local supplies, like iron-oxide pigments (red ochre, yellow ochre, and umber); white derived from the calcium carbonate found in Egypt&#x27;s extensive limestone hills; and blue and green from azurite and malachite.

Besides their decorative effect, colours were also used for their symbolic associations. Colours on sculptures, coffins, and architecture had both aesthetic and symbolic qualities. Ancient Egyptians saw black as the colour of the fertile alluvial soil, and so associated it with fertility and regeneration. Black was also associated with the afterlife, and was the colour of funerary deities like Anubis. White was the colour of purity, while green and blue were associated with vegetation and rejuvenation. Because of this, Osiris was often shown with green skin, and the faces of coffins from the 26th Dynasty were often green. Red, orange, and yellow were associated with the sun. Red was also the colour of the deserts, and hence associated with Seth and the forces of destruction.

Later, during the 19th century, expeditions took place that had the purpose of cataloging the art and culture of ancient Egypt. &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot; is a series of early 19th century publications full of illustrations of monuments and artifacts of Ancient Egypt. Most are black-and-white, but some are colourful, so they can show the polychromy from the past. In some cases, only a few traces of paint remained on the walls, pillars and sculptures, but the illustrators attempted successfully at showing the buildings&#x27; original state in their pictures.

==Classical world==
Some very early polychrome pottery has been excavated on Minoan Crete such as at the Bronze Age site of Phaistos. In ancient Greece sculptures were painted in strong colors. The paint was frequently limited to parts depicting clothing, hair, and so on, with the skin left in the natural color of the stone. But it could cover sculptures in their totality. The painting of Greek sculpture should not merely be seen as an enhancement of their sculpted form but has the characteristics of a distinct style of art. For example, the pedimental sculptures from the Temple of Aphaia on Aegina have recently been demonstrated to have been painted with bold and elaborate patterns, depicting, amongst other details, patterned clothing. The polychrome of stone statues was paralleled by the use of materials to distinguish skin, clothing, and other details in chryselephantine sculptures, and by the use of metals to depict lips, nipples, etc., on high-quality bronzes like the Riace bronzes. The availability of modern digital methods and techniques have allowed the reconstruction and visualization of ancient 3D polychromy in a scientifically sound method and many projects have explored these possibilities in the last years.

An early example of polychrome decoration was found in the Parthenon atop the Acropolis of Athens. By the time European antiquarianism took off in the 18th century, however, the paint that had been on classical buildings had completely weathered off. Thus, the antiquarians&#x27; and architects&#x27; first impressions of these ruins were that classical beauty was expressed only through shape and composition, lacking in robust colors, and it was that impression which informed neoclassical architecture. However, some classicists such as Jacques Ignace Hittorff noticed traces of paint on classical architecture and this slowly came to be accepted. Such acceptance was later accelerated by observation of minute color traces by microscopic and other means, enabling less tentative reconstructions than Hittorff and his contemporaries had been able to produce. An example of classical Greek architectural polychrome may be seen in the full size replica of the Parthenon exhibited in Nashville, Tennessee, US.


==East Asia==

Chinese art is known for the use of vibrant colours. Neolithic Chinese ceramic vessels, like those produced by the Yangshao culture, show the use of black and red pigments. Later, tomb and religious sculptures appear as a consequence of the spread of Buddhism. The deities most common in Chinese Buddhist sculpture are forms of the Buddha and the bodhisattva Guanyin. Traces of gold and bright colours in which sculptures were painted still give an idea of their effect. During the Han and Tang dynasties, polychrome ceramic figurines of servants, entertainers, tenants, and soldiers were placed in the tombs of people from upper-class. These figurines were mass-produced in moulds. Although Chinese porcelain is best known as being blue-and-white, many colorful ceramic vases and figures were produced during the Ming and Qing dynasties. During the same two dynasties, cloisonné vessels that use copper wires (&quot;cloisons&quot;) and bright enamel were also manufactured.

Similarly to what was happening in China, the introduction of Buddhism in Japan in 538 (or perhaps 552 AD) lead to the production of polychrome Japanese Buddhist sculptures. Japanese religious imagery had until then consisted of disposable clay figures used to convey prayers to the spirit world.

==Medieval==
Throughout medieval Europe religious sculptures in wood and other media were often brightly painted or colored, as were the interiors of church buildings. These were often destroyed or whitewashed during iconoclast phases of the Protestant Reformation or in other unrest such as the French Revolution, though some have survived in museums such as the V&amp;A, Musée de Cluny, and Louvre. The exteriors of churches were painted as well, but little has survived. Exposure to the elements and changing tastes and religious approval over time acted against their preservation. The &quot;Majesty Portal&quot; of the Collegiate church of Toro is the most extensive remaining example, due to the construction of a chapel which enclosed and protected it from the elements just a century after it was completed.

==17th and 18th centuries==

While stone and metal sculpture normally remained uncolored, like the classical survivals, polychromed wood sculptures were produced by Spanish artists: Juan Martínez Montañés, Gregorio Fernández (17th century); German: Ignaz Günther, Philipp Jakob Straub (18th century); or Brazilian: Aleijadinho (19th century).

Monochromatic color solutions of architectural orders were also designed in the late, 
dynamic Baroque, drawing on the ideas of Borromini and Guarini. Single-colored stone 
cladding was used: light sandstone, as in the case of the façade of the Bamberg Jesuit 
church (Gunzelmann 2016) designed by Georg and Leonhard Dientzenhofer (1686–1693), 
the façade of the monastery church in Michelsberg by Leonard Dientzenhofer (1696), and 
the abbey church in Neresheim by J.B. Neumann (1747–1792).

In the space of present-day Germany, during the 18th century, the Asam brothers (Egid Quirin Asam and Cosmas Damian Asam) designed churches with undulating walls, curved broken pediments and polychromy. In the German-speaking space, multiple Rococo churches and libraries with pastel polychrome stuccos and columns were built. There, faux marble columns are made from wood pillars that are covered in a layer of polychrome stucco, a mixture of plaster, lime, and pigment. When these ingredients are mixed, a homogenous-coloured paste is created. To achieve the marble look, thinner batches of darker and lighter paste are made, so that veins begin to appear. It is all roughly mixed by hand. When the material hardens it is polished by rubbing with fine sandpaper, and thus this layer of polychrome stucco becomes glossy and imitates really realistically marble. A good example of this is the Library of the Wiblingen Abbey in Ulm, Germany. Faux marble made of stucco will continue to be used during the 19th and early 20th centuries too. It is used only for interiors, because stucco dissolves outside through of contact with water.

In Wallachia, during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Brâncovenesc style was popular in architecture and decorative arts. It is named after Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu, during whose reign it was developed. Some of the churches in this style have polychrome facades, decorated with murals, like the church of the Stavropoleos Monastery in Bucharest, Romania.

The 2nd half of the 18th century was the rise of Neoclassicism, a movement which tries its best at reviving the styles of Ancient Greece, Rome, the Etruscan civilization, and sometimes even Egypt. During Louis XVI&#x27;s reign (1760–1789), interiors in the Louis XVI style start to be decorated with arabesques, inspired by those discovered in ancient houses in Pompeii and Herculaneum. They are painted in pastel colours, painted white with the ornate parts gilt, or polychrome. The State Dining Room of the Inveraray Castle in Scotland, decorated by two French painters, is a good example of a polychrome Louis XVI style interior.

===Porcelain===

With the arrival of European porcelain in the 18th century, brightly colored pottery figurines with a wide range of colors became very popular. Porcelain was developed in China in the 9th century. Its recipe was kept secret from other nations, and only successfully copied in the 15th century by the Japanese and Vietnamese. During the 18th century, German kilns finally figured out how to make porcelain, beginning with the alchemist Johann Friedrich Böttger and the physicist Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus, who made the first European variety in 1709. The Meissen Porcelain Factory was founded in the following year, and it became the leading European porcelain manufacturer. Later, other kilns stole the recipe or came up with their own porcelain technology. Another really famous factory was the Sèvres, which produced stunning porcelain for the French elite during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.

==19th century==
Compared to the 18th century, polychromy was somewhat more widespread in the 19th. However, the facades of most buildings remained white, most sculptures were unpainted, and most furniture was in the shades of its materials. Colours were added usually though glazed ceramics on buildings, different types of stone on sculptures, and through painting or intarsia most often on furniture. Like in the 18th century, porcelain remained quite colourful, many figures being life-like. In contrast with their exteriors, interiors of many houses of the rich were often decorated with boiserie, stucco, and/or painted. Like in the 2nd half of the 18th century, multiple bronze clocks and decorative objects have two tints through gilding and patina. Porcelain elements were also added for more colour.

===Neoclassicism===
Despite evidence of polychrome being discovered on Ancient Greek architecture and sculptures, most Neoclassical buildings have white or beige facades, and black metalwork. Around 1840, the French architect Jacques Ignace Hittorff, published studies of Sicilian architecture, documenting extensive evidence of color. The &quot;polychrome controversy&quot; raged for over a decade and proved to be a challenge for Neoclassical architects throughout Europe.{{sfn|Bergdoll|2000|pp=176}}

Due to the discovery of frescos in the Roman cities Pompeii and Herculaneum during the 18th century, multiple 18th and 19th century Neoclassical houses have their interiors decorated with colourful Pompeian style frescos. They often feature bright red, known as &quot;Pompeian red&quot;. The fashion for Pompeian styles of painting resulted in rooms finished in vivid blocks of colour. Examples include the Pompeian Room from the Hinxton Hall in Cambridgeshire, the Pompejanum in Aschaffenburg, Empress Joséphine&#x27;s Bedroom from the Château de Malmaison, and Napoleon&#x27;s bath of the Château de Rambouillet. By the beginning of the 19th century, painters were also able to create effects of marbling and graining to imitate wood.

===19th century maximalism===
&quot;More is more&quot; was the aesthetic principle followed in the Victorian era. Maximalism is present in many types of Victorian era designs, like ceramics, furniture, cutlery, tableware, fashion, architecture, book illustration, clocks, etc. Despite the appetite for ornamentation, many of them remain decorated with only a few colours, especially furniture. Ceramics were the field where polychrome was widespread. Besides objects, polychrome ceramic was also present in architecture and some furniture pieces and architecture through tiles.

The objects and buildings of the 19th century shown in the galleries of this page are without any doubt impressive. Today were are delighted by their ornaments, colours, and styles. However, up to the 1960s, with the rise of Postmodernism, when people started to question Modernism and began to appreciate things from the pre-Modern past, the verdict of Victorian designs wasn&#x27;t good. During the early 20th century and even when they were made, some described the Victorian age as being one that has been providing us with some of the ugliest objects that have ever been made. Descriptions like &#x27;aesthetic monstrosities&#x27; or &#x27;ornamental abominations&#x27; were around at the time, and it only got worse. At the end of the 19th century, Marc-Louis Solon (1835–1913), a well established ceramic designer, who worked for Minton and Company, was not unusual in commenting that the period &#x27;bears the stamp of an unmitigated bad taste&#x27;. As time passed, negative opinions only got worse. Pioneer Modern architects Adolf Loos and Le Corbusier felt that works like this were not simply bad, they were such an affront they should have been made illegal.

===Polychrome brickwork===
{{Main|Polychrome brickwork}}
Polychrome brickwork is a style of architectural brickwork which emerged in the 1860s and used bricks of different colours (brown, cream, yellow, red, blue, and black) in patterned combinations to highlight architectural features. These patterns were made around window arches or were just applied on walls. It was often used to replicate the effect of quoining. Early examples featured banding, with later examples exhibiting complex diagonal, criss-cross, and step patterns, in some cases even writing using bricks. Elements of glazed ceramic with details were also used for more complex ornaments.

===Romanian Revival style===
{{main|Romanian Revival architecture}}
In the Kingdom of Romania, the Romanian Revival style appeared at the end of the 19th century. It is the Romanian equivalent of the National Romantic style that was popular at the same time in Northern Europe. The movement is heavily inspired by Brâncovenesc architecture, a style that was popular in Wallachia in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Interiors of houses in this style built before WW1 are often decorated with a variety of bright colours. In the case of a few buildings, the polychrome extends on the exterior too, through the use of colorful glazed ceramic tiles. The style became more popular in the 20th century. A Romanian Revival house that stands out through its variety of colours is the Gheorghe Petrașcu House (Piața Romană no. 5) in Bucharest, by Spiru Cegăneanu, 1912

==20th century==
In the twentieth century there were notable periods of polychromy in architecture, from the expressions of Art Nouveau throughout Europe, to the international flourishing of Art Deco or Art Moderne, to the development of postmodernism in the latter decades of the century. During these periods, brickwork, stone, tile, stucco, and metal facades were designed with a focus on the use of new colors and patterns, while architects often looked for inspiration to historical examples ranging from Islamic tilework to English Victorian brick.

===Before World War I===
At the beginning of the 20th century, before the world wars, Revivalism (including Neoclassicism and the Gothic Revival) and eclecticism of historic styles were very popular in design and architecture. Many of the things said about the 19th century are still in this period. Many of the buildings from this period have their interiors decorated with colours, through tiles, mosaics, stuccos, or murals. When it comes to exteriors, most polychrome facades are decorated with ceramic tiles.

Art Nouveau was also in fashion during the 1900s all over the Western world. However, it fragmented by 1911 and from then it steadily faded, until it disappeared with WW1. Some regular Art Nouveau buildings have their facades decorated with colourful glazed ceramic ornaments. The colours used are often more earthy and faded compared to the intense ones used by Neoclassicism. Compared to other movements in design and architecture, Art Nouveau was one with different versions in multiple countries. The Belgian and French form is characterized by organic shapes, ornaments taken from the plant world, sinuous lines, asymmetry (especially when it comes to objects design), the whiplash motif, the &quot;femme fatale&quot;, and other elements of nature. In Austria, Germany and the UK, it took a more stylized geometric form, as a form of protest towards revivalism and eclecticism. The geometric ornaments found in Gustav Klimt&#x27;s paintings and in the furniture of Koloman Moser are representative of the Vienna Secession (Austrian Art Nouveau). In some countries, artists found inspiration in national tradition and folklore. In the UK for example, multiple silversmiths used interlaces taken from Celtic art. Similarly, Hungarian, Russian, and Ukrainian architects used polychromatic folkloric motifs on their buildings, usually through colourful ceramic ornaments.

===Modernism===
During the interwar period and the middle of the 20th century, Modernism was in fashion. To Modernists, form was more important than ornament, so solid blocks of strong colour were often used to emphasize shape and create contrast. Primary colours and black and white were preferred. This is really the case of the Dutch De Stijl movement, which began in 1917. The style involved reducing an object (whether a painting or a design) to its essentials, using only black, white and primary colours, and a simple geometry of straight lines and planes. Gerrit Rietveld&#x27;s Red and Blue Chair (1917–1918) and Rietveld Schröder House in Utrecht (1924) show this use of colour. Polychromy in Modernist design was not limited to De Stijl. The Unité d&#x27;habitation, a residential housing typology developed by Le Corbusier, has some flat colourful parts.

Some Art Deco objects, buildings and interiors stand out through their polychromy and use of intense colours. Fauvism, with its highly saturated colours, like the paintings of Henri Matisse, was an influence for some Art Deco designers. Another influence for polychromy were the Ballets Russes. Leon Bakst&#x27;s stage designs filled Parisian artistic circles with enthusiasm for bright colours.

Despite their lack of ornamentation, multiple Mid-century modern designs, like Lucienne Day&#x27;s textiles, Charles and Ray Eames&#x27;s Hang-It-All coat hanger (1953), or Irving Harper&#x27;s Marshmallow sofa (1956), are decorated with colours. Aside from individual objects, mid-century modern interiors were also quite colourful. This was also caused by the fact that after WW2, plastics became increasingly popular as a material for kitchenware and kitchen units, light fixtures, electrical appliances and toys, and by the fact that plastic could be produced in a wide range of colours, from jade green to red.

===Postmodernism===
The use of vivid colours continued with Postmodernism, in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Compared to Mid-century modern objects, which often had intense colours but were monochrome, Postmodern design and architecture stand out through the use of a variety of colours on single objects or buildings. Postmodern architects working with bold colors included Robert Venturi (Allen Memorial Art Museum addition; Best Company Warehouse), Michael Graves (Snyderman House; Humana Building), and James Stirling (Neue Staatsgalerie; Arthur M. Sackler Museum), among others. In the UK, John Outram created numerous bright and colourful buildings throughout the 1980s and 90s, including the &quot;Temple of Storms&quot; pumping station. Aside from architecture, bright colours were present on everything, from furniture to textiles and posters. Neon greens and yellows were popular in product design, as were fluorescent tones of scarlet, pink, and orange used together. Injection-moulded plastics gave designers new creative freedom, making it possible to mass-produce almost any shape (and colour) quickly and cheaply.

An artist well known for her polychrome artworks is Niki de Saint Phalle, who produced many sculptures painted in bold colours. She devoted the later decades of her life to building a live-in sculpture park in Tuscany, the Tarot Garden, with artworks covered in vibrant colourful mosaics.

===United States===
Polychrome building facades later rose in popularity as a way of highlighting certain trim features in Victorian and Queen Anne architecture in the United States. The rise of the modern paint industry following the American Civil War also helped to fuel the (sometimes extravagant) use of multiple colors.
The polychrome facade style faded with the rise of the 20th century&#x27;s revival movements, which stressed classical colors applied in restrained fashion and, more importantly, with the birth of modernism, which advocated clean, unornamented facades rendered in white stucco or paint. Polychromy reappeared with the flourishing of the preservation movement and its embrace of (what had previously been seen as) the excesses of the Victorian era and in San Francisco, California in the 1970s to describe its abundant late-nineteenth-century houses. These earned the endearment &#x27;Painted Ladies&#x27;, a term that in modern times is considered kitsch when it is applied to describe all Victorian houses that have been painted with period colors.

John Joseph Earley (1881–1945) developed a &quot;polychrome&quot; process of concrete slab construction and ornamentation that was admired across America. In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, his products graced a variety of buildings{{dash}}all formed by the staff of the Earley Studio in Rosslyn, Virginia. Earley&#x27;s Polychrome Historic District houses in Silver Spring, Maryland were built in the mid-1930s. The concrete panels were pre-cast with colorful stones and shipped to the lot for on-site assembly. Earley wanted to develop a higher standard of affordable housing after the Depression, but only a handful of the houses were built before he died; written records of his concrete casting techniques were destroyed in a fire. Less well-known, but just as impressive, is the Dr. Fealy Polychrome House that Earley built atop a hill in Southeast Washington, D.C. overlooking the city. His uniquely designed polychrome houses were outstanding among prefabricated houses in the country, appreciated for their Art Deco ornament and superb craftsmanship.

Native American ceramic artists, in particular those in the Southwest, produced polychrome pottery from the time of the Mogollon cultures and Mimbres peoples to contemporary times.

==21st century==
In the 2000s, the art of designing art toys was taking off. Multiple monochrome or polychrome vinyl figurines were produced during this period, and are still produced during the 2020s. A few artists who designed vinyl toys include Joe Ledbetter, Takashi Murakami, Flying Förtress, and CoonOne1.

During the 2010s and the early 2020s, a new interest for Postmodern architecture and design appeared. One of the causes were memorial exhibitions that presented the style, the most comprehensive and influential one being held at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London in 2011, called &quot;&quot;. The Salone del Mobile in Milan since 2014 showcased revivals, reinterpretations, and new postmodern-influenced designs. Because of this, multiple funky polychrome buildings were erected, like the House for Essex, Wrabness, Essex, the UK, by FAT and Grayson Perry, 2014 or the Miami Museum Garage, Miami, USA, by WORKac, 2018.

Besides revivals of Postmodernism, another key design movement of the early 2020s is Maximalism. Since its philosophy can be summarized as &quot;more is more&quot;, contrasting with the minimalist motto &quot;less is more&quot;, it is characterized by a wide use of intense colours and patterns.

==Polychromatic light==
The term polychromatic means having several colors. It is used to describe light that exhibits more than one color, which also means that it contains radiation of more than one wavelength. The study of polychromatics is particularly useful in the production of diffraction gratings.

<text>Swerting (Proto-Norse *&quot;Swartingaz&quot; ) is briefly mentioned in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, where he had a son or son-in-law, Hrethel, who was the maternal grandfather of the hero Beowulf.

==The Heaðobard tradition==
A Swerting of the same timeframe also appears in Scandinavian traditions as the killer of a Danish king named Fróði/Frotho, who corresponds to Froda, the Heaðobard, in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. In the Scandinavian traditions, Froda&#x27;s son Ingeld also appears with the name forms &quot;Ingjald&quot; or &quot;Ingellus&quot;.

===&quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and &quot;Bjarkarímur&quot;===
The &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and the &quot;Bjarkarímur&quot; tell that the king of Sweden, Jorund, was defeated by the Danish king Fróði, who made him a tributary and took his daughter. The daughter gave birth to Halfdan, but another woman became Fróði&#x27;s legitimate wife and gave him an heir named Ingjaldr. Together with one of his earls, Swerting, Jorund conspired against Fróði and killed him during the blót.

===&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;===
There is also a second version in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, concerning the adventures of Starkad, and which is based on the old warrior who restarted the conflict between the Heaðobards and the Danes. The Danish king Frotho (Froda) was killed through treachery by a Saxon named Swerting (Swertingus) (cf. the Swedish earl, above). Frotho&#x27;s son Ingellus (Ingeld) lived a wanton life and married one of Swerting&#x27;s daughters. This angered Starkad so much that he enlisted at the Swedish king Halfdan&#x27;s (Haldanus) court instead. As Ingellus continued his sinful life and did not do his duty to avenge his father, Starkad appeared during a banquet that Ingellus had with the sons of Swerting, his father&#x27;s slayer. Starkad strongly admonished Ingellus and humiliated his queen who tried to calm Starkad with kindness and her costly ribbon. Starkad succeeded in exciting Ingellus to kill Swerting&#x27;s sons and to divorce his Saxon bride.
=== &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; ===

The pedigree of king Aella of Deira given in &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; includes the name &quot;Sguerthing&quot; as great-grandfather of the king, and this has been interpreted as a reference to the Swerting of &quot;Beowulf&quot;. The name does not appear in other versions of the royal pedigree and may represent an attempt by the author of &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; to interpose this heroic character into the royal pedigree.

<doc id="969799" wikidata="Q7788215" url="?curid=969799" title="Thomas Capano">
<text>Thomas Joseph Capano (October 11, 1949 – September 19, 2011) was a disbarred American lawyer and former Delaware deputy attorney general who was convicted of the 1996 murder of Anne Marie Fahey, his former lover.

==Background==
Thomas Capano, one of four brothers, belonged to a prominent family of Delaware real estate developers and building contractors. Thomas graduated from Archmere Academy in Claymont, Delaware. He became an affluent lawyer, state prosecutor, Wilmington city attorney, legal counsel to Governor Mike Castle, and political consultant, well known in Delaware&#x27;s political circles.

In 1994, Capano was a partner at the Wilmington office of Saul Ewing LLP when he became involved with 28-year-old Anne Marie Fahey, the appointments secretary to then-Governor Tom Carper. Married with four daughters, Capano separated from his wife Kay the following year. In September 1995, while still involved with Capano, Fahey began another relationship with Michael Scanlan.

==Fahey&#x27;s disappearance and investigation==
Fahey was last seen alive on June 27, 1996, when she went to dinner with Capano in Philadelphia. Fahey&#x27;s family reported her missing on June 30. After an extensive search, the FBI joined in the investigation in July and a federal grand jury heard evidence for over a year. Capano, the last known person to have seen Fahey alive, was the prime suspect. He was arrested for her murder in November 1997, over sixteen months after her disappearance. However, Fahey&#x27;s body was never found, and prosecutors were unable to establish the cause or manner of her death.

Prosecutors alleged that Capano murdered Fahey at the house he rented and, with the assistance of his brother Gerry, dumped her body in the Atlantic Ocean. Gerry owned a boat and, when it was sold, its two anchors were missing. On November 8, 1997, Gerry was interviewed by detectives and told them that Capano had borrowed the boat and admitted that he had murdered someone who was attempting to extort him. They went to Stone Harbor, New Jersey, with a large cooler that contained Fahey&#x27;s body, sailed out to sea, and pushed the cooler overboard. Gerry told police that Capano shot the cooler in order to sink it, but that the cooler remained afloat in the water. Capano then retrieved the cooler, removed the body, and wrapped the anchor chains around it. He also asked Gerry to help dispose of a blood-stained sofa and carpet into a dumpster, which was managed by a third brother, Louis. Capano instructed Louis to empty the dumpsters outside of their regular schedule. The empty cooler was found on July 4, 1996, by a local fisherman.

Investigators did not have a murder weapon or a body, nor any evidence that Capano had purchased a gun. However, Capano&#x27;s other mistress, Debby MacIntyre, had bought a gun and admitted having supplied the weapon to Capano.

==Trial and appeals==
The highly publicized case went to trial on October 26, 1998, and lasted twelve weeks. The defense claimed that MacIntyre had burst into Capano&#x27;s room and, in a jealous rage upon seeing Capano and Fahey engaged in intimacy, had threatened to shoot herself; as Capano and MacIntyre were wrestling for the gun, it discharged and killed Fahey. On January 17, 1999, the jury convicted Capano of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to death by lethal injection. This marked the first time in Delaware state history, in which a person was convicted of murder, without a body or murder weapon.

In January 2006, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Capano&#x27;s conviction but remanded the case for sentencing because the death penalty was imposed by a non-unanimous jury verdict. In February of that year, the state abandoned its efforts to seek capital punishment, opting to leave Capano imprisoned for life without parole. In April 2008, the U.S. District Court rejected Capano&#x27;s &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition, and on September 2, 2008, the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. Capano did not appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, bringing an end to his appeals.

==Death==
Capano, aged 61, was found dead in his jail cell at 12:34 p.m. on September 19, 2011, by an officer performing a routine security check at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center state prison in Smyrna, Delaware. The medical examiner determined that Capano died of sudden cardiac arrest. He also had &quot;atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease, and that obesity was a contributing factor in his death&quot;. Following Capano&#x27;s death, his brothers Louis and Joseph engaged in a bitter court fight over their family&#x27;s multimillion-dollar real estate empire.

==Portrayals==
Several books were written about the case, including &quot;Above the Law&quot; by Brian J Karem. Published by Pinnacle Books in September 1999; &quot;And Never Let Her Go: Thomas Capano: The Deadly Seducer&quot; by Ann Rule, &quot;The Summer Wind: Thomas Capano and the Murder of Anne Marie Fahey&quot; by George Anastasia, and &quot;Fatal Embrace: The Inside Story of the Thomas Capano/Anne Marie Fahey Murder Case&quot; by Cris Barrish and Peter Meyer. In 2001, a television movie based on Rule&#x27;s book was made, &quot;And Never Let Her Go&quot;, starring Mark Harmon as Capano and Kathryn Morris as Fahey.

A 2000 episode of &quot;The FBI Files&quot;, title &quot;Deadly Obsession,&quot; and an episode of the CBS News documentary program &quot;48 Hours&quot; featured the case. In 2012, the story was featured on &quot;Behind Mansion Walls&quot;. The case was portrayed in &quot;Law and Order&quot; season 11 in an episode titled &quot;Ego&quot;. The case was also portrayed in the Season 1, Third Episode of the NBC series &quot;Boomtown&quot; (October 13, 2002). Also featured in a 2018 episode of &quot;Vanity Fair Confidential&quot; titled &quot;The Secret of the Summer Wind.&quot;

<doc id="969803" wikidata="Q124032" url="?curid=969803" title="Arnold Henry Guyot">
<text>Arnold Henry Guyot ( ) (September 28, 1807February 8, 1884) was a Swiss-American geologist and geographer.

==Early life==
Guyot was born on September 28, 1807, at Boudevilliers, near Neuchâtel, Switzerland. He was educated at Chaux-de-Fonds, then at the college of Neuchâtel. In 1825, he went to Germany and resided in Karlsruhe where he met Louis Agassiz, the beginning of a lifelong friendship. From Karlsruhe he moved to Stuttgart, where he studied at the gymnasium. He returned to Neuchâtel in 1827. He determined to enter the ministry and started at the University of Berlin to attend lectures. While pursuing his studies, he also attended lectures on philosophy and natural science. His leisure time was spent in collecting shells and plants, and he received an entrée to the Berlin Botanical Garden from Alexander von Humboldt. In 1835, he received a PhD from Berlin.

==Scientific career==
In 1838, at Agassiz&#x27;s suggestion, he visited the Swiss glaciers and communicated the results of his six-week investigation to the Geological Society of France. He was the first to point out certain important observations relating to glacial motion and structure. Among other things he noted the more rapid flow of the center than of the sides, and the more rapid flow of the top than of the bottom of glaciers; described the laminated or ribboned structure of the glacial ice; and ascribed the movement of glaciers to a gradual molecular displacement rather than to a sliding of the ice mass as held by Horace Bénédict de Saussure. He subsequently collected important data concerning erratic boulders.

In 1839, he became the colleague of Agassiz as professor of history and physical geography at the College of Neuchâtel (a.k.a. Neuchâtel Academy). The suspension of that institution in 1848 caused Guyot to emigrate, at Agassiz&#x27;s instance, to the United States, where he settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He delivered a course of lectures at the Lowell Institute which were afterward published as &quot;Earth and Man&quot; (Boston 1849). For several years the Massachusetts Board of Education retained his services as a lecturer on geography and methods of instruction to the normal schools and teachers&#x27; institutes.

He was occupied with this work until his appointment, in 1854, as professor of physical geography and geology at Princeton University, which office he retained until his death. He was also for several years lecturer on physical geography in the State Normal School in Trenton, New Jersey, and from 1861 to 1866 lecturer in the Princeton Theological Seminary. He also gave courses in the Union Theological Seminary, New York, and at Columbia College. He founded the museum at Princeton (now closed), many of the specimens of which came from his own collections. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1867.

His scientific work in the United States included the perfection of plans for a national system of meteorological observations. Most of these were conducted under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. His extensive meteorological observations led to the establishment of the United States Weather Bureau, and his &quot;Meteorological and Physical Tables&quot; (1852, revised ed. 1884) were long standard.

Guyot rejected Darwin&#x27;s theory of human evolution and, at the same time, he accepted Hugh Miller&#x27;s views on the book of Genesis, thinking that the days described there might have taken a longer period of time. Scientist James Dwight Dana described Guyot as &quot;a fervently religious man, living as if ever in communion with his Heavenly Parent; a Christian, following closely in the footsteps of his Master.&quot; Guyot&#x27;s &quot;Creation, or the Biblical Cosmogony in the Light of Modern Science&quot; (1884) was critically reviewed in the &quot;Science&quot; journal.

==Death==
Guyot died on February 8, 1884, at Princeton, New Jersey.

==Works==
His graded series of text books and wall maps were important aids in the extension and popularization of geological study in America. In addition to text books, his principal publications were:
* (translated by Cornelius Conway Felton, 1849)
*&quot;A Memoir of Louis Agassiz&quot; (1883)
*&quot;Creation, or the Biblical Cosmogony in the Light of Modern Science&quot; (1884)
*&quot;Johnson&#x27;s New Universal Cyclopaedia&quot; (1876) - editor-in-chief along with Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard
Guyot&#x27;s &quot;Earth and Man&quot; lecture series describes how geography—particularly the distribution of continents, topography, and climate regions—determines the superiority or inferiority of human races in terms of beauty, physical ability, intelligence, and morality. Through these lectures, Guyot promulgated theories of scientific racism to a wide audience in New England, including the general public and teachers who were eager to incorporate this material into their classes. Guyot is estimated to have reached about 1,500 teachers during this tour.

==Legacy==

He is the namesake of several geographical features, including Guyot Glacier in Alaska, The Guyot Crater, Mount Guyot on the North Carolina and Tennessee border, Mount Guyot in New Hampshire, Mount Guyot on the Rocky Mountain Continental Divide in Colorado, as well as a Mount Guyot just southwest of Mount Whitney in California.

The building housing the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Department of Geosciences at Princeton is named Guyot Hall in his honor. In turn the term &quot;guyot&quot;—an isolated underwater volcanic mountain (seamount), with a flat top—was coined by Harry Hammond Hess and named after the eponymous building.

<doc id="969806" wikidata="Q6555806" url="?curid=969806" title="Lionel Tate">
<text>Lionel Alexander Tate (born January 30, 1987) is the youngest American citizen ever sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, though this sentence was eventually overturned. In January 2001, when Tate was 13, he was convicted of first-degree murder for the 1999 battering death of six-year-old Tiffany Eunick in Broward County, Florida imitating professional wrestling moves.

==Murder==
On July 28, 1999, Tate was left alone with Eunick, his cousin, who was being babysat by Tate&#x27;s mother, Kathleen Grossett-Tate. While the children were downstairs playing while watching a professional wrestling program &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot;, Tate&#x27;s mother called to them to be quiet. Roughly 45 minutes later, Tate came upstairs to tell his mother that Tiffany was not breathing. Her legs, feet, and neck all had serious bruises; an example of the amount of force used on her was similar to bruises from that of a speeding car. Her other injuries included a fractured skull, lacerated liver, fractured rib, and swollen brain. These injuries were characterized by the prosecution as &quot;similar to those she would have sustained by falling from a three-story building.&quot; In sentencing Tate to life imprisonment, Judge Joel T. Lazarus of Broward County Circuit Court said that &quot;The acts of Lionel Tate were not the playful acts of a child [...] The acts of Lionel Tate were cold, callous and indescribably cruel.&quot; Dwayne Johnson, who performed as The Rock, was subpoenaed on March 3, 2000.

=== Felony murder rule ===
Florida statutes required the jury to convict Tate of first-degree murder even if the jury did not believe that he intended to kill or injure anyone—all that was required was that Tate knowingly abused another child who died as a result, as any intentional act that could reasonably be expected to result in physical injury to a child is child abuse per Florida statutes. The rule for such convictions is known as the felony murder rule. The sufficient conditions of the felony murder rule were listed by the judge Joel T. Lazarus during sentencing. Therefore, Tate was sentenced to life in prison without the prosecution having to prove that he intended to kill or injure, or realized that his acts are likely to kill or injure, or even that a typical child of his age would or should realize this.

Critics, such as the various groups listed in the &quot;amicus&quot; brief attached to Tate&#x27;s appeal, assert that convicting preteen children of first-degree murder without having to prove these children intended any harm, not to mention serious injury or death, is unacceptable.

===Sentence===
The sentence was controversial because Tate was 12 years old at the time of the murder, and his victim was 6. He was the youngest person in modern US history to be sentenced to life imprisonment, bringing broad criticism on the treatment of juvenile offenders in the justice system of the state of Florida.

===Original sentence overturned===
After the conviction, the prosecution openly joined Tate&#x27;s plea for leniency in sentencing and even offered to help in his appeal. The trial judge criticized the prosecution for compromising the integrity of the adversarial system, and said that if the prosecution felt that life imprisonment was not warranted, they should not have charged him with murder in the first place.

In January 2004, a state appeals court overturned his conviction on the basis that his mental competency had not been evaluated before trial. This opened the way for Tate to accept the same plea deal he originally turned down, and he was released on one year&#x27;s house arrest and 10 years&#x27; probation.

===Reactions by the WWF===
Eunick&#x27;s death had sparked fury and controversy. The lawyer for Lionel Tate, James Lewis was sued by the World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. alleging that the attorney and others have conspired to damage the WWF&#x27;s image. The WWF then filed the 10-count libel suit on November 9, 2000 against Lewis and the Parents Television Council in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, claiming that the PTC&#x27;s statements were false and constituted defamation. The WWF also filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the PTC for using clips from WWF programs in their promotional videos. The PTC filed for dismissal of the suit, but on May 24, 2001, U.S. district court Judge Denny Chin denied the PTC&#x27;s motion on the basis that the WWF&#x27;s lawsuit had merit. The PTC and the WWF settled out of court and, as part of the settlement agreement, the PTC paid the WWF $3.5 million USD and L. Brent Bozell III issued a public apology, stating that it was wrong to blame the World Wrestling Federation or any of its programs for the deaths of children and that the original statements had been based on what was later found to be false information designed by people close to the Tate blaming his cousin&#x27;s death on the WWF.

==Armed robbery arrest and subsequent plea bargain==
On May 23, 2005, Tate was charged with armed burglary battery, armed robbery, and violation of probation, the Broward County Sheriff&#x27;s Office said.

Tate threatened Domino&#x27;s Pizza deliveryman Walter Ernest Gallardo with a handgun outside a friend&#x27;s apartment after phoning in an order. Gallardo dropped the four pizzas and fled the scene. Tate then re-entered the apartment, assaulting the occupant who did not want Tate inside.

Gallardo called 911 upon reaching the Domino&#x27;s store and returned to identify Tate, the sheriff&#x27;s office said in a statement, but no gun was recovered.

On March 1, 2006, Tate accepted a plea bargain and was to be sentenced to 30 years&#x27; imprisonment in a sentencing hearing in April 2006. Tate admitted that he had violated probation by possessing a gun during the May 23 violent robbery, but he has refused to answer questions about where he got and later disposed of the gun. He was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea for robbery but was finally sentenced to 30 years in prison on May 18, 2006, for violating probation. On October 24, 2007, Florida&#x27;s 4th District Court of Appeal upheld that sentence.

On February 19, 2008, Tate pled no contest to the robbery and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. The sentence will run concurrently with his 30-year sentence for violating his probation. Tate is currently imprisoned in the Hamilton Correctional Institution Annex.

<doc id="969817" wikidata="Q742530" url="?curid=969817" title="Idyll">
<text>An idyll (, ; ; occasionally spelled &quot;idyl&quot; in American English) is a short poem, descriptive of rustic life, written in the style of Theocritus&#x27;s short pastoral poems, the Idylls (Εἰδύλλια).

Unlike Homer, Theocritus did not engage in heroes and warfare. His idylls are limited to a small intimate world, and describe scenes from everyday life. Later imitators include the Roman poets Virgil and Catullus, Italian poets Torquato Tasso, Sannazaro and Leopardi, the English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson (&quot;Idylls of the King&quot;), and Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Idylls from Messina&quot;. Goethe called his poem &quot;Hermann and Dorothea&quot;—which Schiller considered the very climax in Goethe&#x27;s production—an idyll.

==Terminology==
The term is used in music to refer generally to a work evocative of pastoral or rural life such as Edward MacDowell&#x27;s &quot;Forest Idylls&quot;, and more specifically to a kind of French courtly entertainment (&quot;divertissement&quot;) of the baroque era where a pastoral poem was set to music, accompanied by ballet and singing. Examples of the latter are Lully&#x27;s &quot;Idylle sur la Paix&quot; set to a text by Racine, Charpentier’s &quot;idylle sur le retour de la santé du Roi&quot; H.489 and Desmarets&#x27; &quot;Idylle sur la naissance du duc de Bourgogne&quot; set to a text by Antoinette Deshoulières.

In the visual arts, an idyll is a painting depicting the same sort of subject matter to be found in idyllic poetry, often with rural or peasant life as its central theme. One of the earliest examples is the early 15th century &quot;Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry&quot;. The genre was particularly popular in English paintings of the Victorian era.

<doc id="969821" wikidata="Q902835" url="?curid=969821" title="JAK-STAT signaling pathway">
<text>The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is a chain of interactions between proteins in a cell, and is involved in processes such as immunity, cell division, cell death, and tumor formation. The pathway communicates information from chemical signals outside of a cell to the cell nucleus, resulting in the activation of genes through the process of transcription. There are three key parts of JAK-STAT signalling: Janus kinases (JAKs), signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (STATs), and receptors (which bind the chemical signals). Disrupted JAK-STAT signalling may lead to a variety of diseases, such as skin conditions, cancers, and disorders affecting the immune system.

== Structure of JAKs and STATs ==
&quot;Main articles: JAKs and STATs&quot;

There are four JAK proteins: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAKs contains a FERM domain (approximately 400 residues), an SH2-related domain (approximately 100 residues), a kinase domain (approximately 250 residues) and a pseudokinase domain (approximately 300 residues). The kinase domain is vital for JAK activity, since it allows JAKs to phosphorylate (add phosphate groups to) proteins.

There are seven STAT proteins: STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B and STAT6. STAT proteins contain many different domains, each with a different function, of which the most conserved region is the SH2 domain. The SH2 domain is formed of 2 α-helices and a β-sheet and is formed approximately from residues 575–680. STATs also have transcriptional activation domains (TAD), which are less conserved and are located at the C-terminus. In addition, STATs also contain: tyrosine activation, amino-terminal, linker, coiled-coil and DNA-binding domains.

== Mechanism ==
The binding of various ligands, usually cytokines, such as interferons and interleukins, to cell-surface receptors, causes the receptors to dimerize, which brings the receptor-associated JAKs into close proximity. The JAKs then phosphorylate each other on tyrosine residues located in regions called activation loops, through a process called transphosphorylation, which increases the activity of their kinase domains. The activated JAKs then phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor, creating binding sites for proteins possessing SH2 domains. STATs then bind to the phosphorylated tyrosines on the receptor using their SH2 domains, and then they are tyrosine-phosphorylated by JAKs, causing the STATs to dissociate from the receptor. At least STAT5 requires glycosylation at threonine 92 for strong STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation. These activated STATs form hetero- or homodimers, where the SH2 domain of each STAT binds the phosphorylated tyrosine of the opposite STAT, and the dimer then translocates to the cell nucleus to induce transcription of target genes. STATs may also be tyrosine-phosphorylated directly by receptor tyrosine kinases - but since most receptors lack built-in kinase activity, JAKs are usually required for signalling.

=== Movement of STATs from the cytosol to the nucleus ===
To move from the cytosol to the nucleus, STAT dimers have to pass through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which are protein complexes present along the nuclear envelope that control the flow of substances in and out of the nucleus. To enable STATs to move into the nucleus, an amino acid sequence on STATs, called the nuclear localization signal (NLS), is bound by proteins called importins. Once the STAT dimer (bound to importins) enters the nucleus, a protein called Ran (associated with GTP) binds to the importins, releasing them from the STAT dimer. The STAT dimer is then free in the nucleus.

Specific STATs appear to bind to specific importin proteins. For example, STAT3 proteins can enter the nucleus by binding to importin α3 and importin α6. On the other hand, STAT1 and STAT2 bind to importin α5. Studies indicate that STAT2 requires a protein called interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to enter the nucleus. Not as much is known about nuclear entrance of other STATs, but it has been suggested that a sequence of amino acids in the DNA-binding domain of STAT4 might allow nuclear import; also, STAT5 and STAT6 can both bind to importin α3. In addition, STAT3, STAT5 and STAT6 can enter the nucleus even if they are not phosphorylated at tyrosine residues.

=== Role of post-translational modifications ===
After STATs are made by protein biosynthesis, they have non-protein molecules attached to them, called post-translational modifications. One example of this is tyrosine phosphorylation (which is fundamental for JAK-STAT signalling), but STATs experience other modifications, which may affect STAT behaviour in JAK-STAT signalling. These modifications include: methylation, acetylation and serine phosphorylation. 
*Methylation. STAT3 can be dimethylated (have two methyl groups) on a lysine residue, at position 140, and it is suggested that this could reduce STAT3 activity. There is debate as to whether STAT1 is methylated on an arginine residue (at position 31), and what the function of this methylation could be. 
*Acetylation. STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT5 and STAT6 have been shown to be acetylated. STAT1 may have an acetyl group attached to lysines at positions 410 and 413, and as a result, STAT1 can promote the transcription of apoptotic genes - triggering cell death. STAT2 acetylation is important for interactions with other STATs, and for the transcription of anti-viral genes.
Acetylation of STAT3 has been suggested to be important for its dimerization, DNA-binding and gene-transcribing ability, and IL-6 JAK-STAT pathways that use STAT3 require acetylation for transcription of IL-6 response genes. 
STAT5 acetylation on lysines at positions 694 and 701 is important for effective STAT dimerization in prolactin signalling. Adding acetyl groups to STAT6 is suggested to be essential for gene transcription in some forms of IL-4 signalling, but not all the amino acids which are acetylated on STAT6 are known.
*Serine phosphorylation. Most of the seven STATs (except STAT2) undergo serine phosphorylation. Serine phosphorylation of STATs has been shown to reduce gene transcription. It is also required for the transcription of some target genes of the cytokines IL-6 and IFN- γ. It has been proposed that phosphorylation of serine can regulate STAT1 dimerization, and that continuous serine phosphorylation on STAT3 influences cell division.

=== Recruitment of co-activators ===
Like many other transcription factors, STATs are capable of recruiting co-activators such as CBP and p300, and these co-activators increase the rate of transcription of target genes. The coactivators are able to do this by making genes on DNA more accessible to STATs and by recruiting proteins needed for transcription of genes. The interaction between STATs and coactivators occurs through the transactivation domains (TADs) of STATs. The TADs on STATs can also interact with histone acetyltransferases (HATs); these HATs add acetyl groups to lysine residues on proteins associated with DNA called histones. Adding acetyl groups removes the positive charge on lysine residues, and as a result there are weaker interactions between histones and DNA, making DNA more accessible to STATs and enabling an increase in the transcription of target genes.

=== Integration with other signalling pathways ===

JAK-STAT signalling is able to interconnect with other cell-signalling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. When JAKs are activated and phosphorylate tyrosine residues on receptors, proteins with SH2 domains (such as STATs) are able bind to the phosphotyrosines, and the proteins can carry out their function. Like STATs, the PI3K protein also has an SH2 domain, and therefore it is also able to bind to these phosphorylated receptors. As a result, activating the JAK-STAT pathway can also activate PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling.

JAK-STAT signalling can also integrate with the MAPK/ERK pathway. Firstly, a protein important for MAPK/ERK signalling, called Grb2, has an SH2 domain, and therefore it can bind to receptors phosphorylated by JAKs (in a similar way to PI3K). Grb2 then functions to allow the MAPK/ERK pathway to progress. Secondly, a protein activated by the MAPK/ERK pathway, called MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), can phosphorylate STATs, which can increase gene transcription by STATs. However, although MAPK can increase transcription induced by STATs, one study indicates that phosphorylation of STAT3 by MAPK can reduce STAT3 activity.

One example of JAK-STAT signalling integrating with other pathways is Interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor signaling in T cells. IL-2 receptors have γ (gamma) chains, which are associated with JAK3, which then phosphorylates key tyrosines on the tail of the receptor. Phosphorylation then recruits an adaptor protein called Shc, which activates the MAPK/ERK pathway, and this facilitates gene regulation by STAT5.

=== Alternative signalling pathway ===
An alternative mechanism for JAK-STAT signalling has also been suggested. In this model, SH2 domain-containing kinases, can bind to phosphorylated tyrosines on receptors and directly phosphorylate STATs, resulting in STAT dimerization. Therefore, unlike the traditional mechanism, STATs can be phosphorylated not just by JAKs, but by other receptor-bound kinases. So, if one of the kinases (either JAK or the alternative SH2-containing kinase) cannot function, signalling may still occur through activity of the other kinase. This has been shown experimentally.

== Role in cytokine receptor signalling ==
Given that many JAKs are associated with cytokine receptors, the JAK-STAT signalling pathway plays a major role in cytokine receptor signalling. Since cytokines are substances produced by immune cells that can alter the activity of neighbouring cells, the effects of JAK-STAT signalling are often more highly seen in cells of the immune system. For example, JAK3 activation in response to IL-2 is vital for lymphocyte development and function. Also, one study indicates that JAK1 is needed to carry out signalling for receptors of the cytokines IFNγ, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10.

The JAK-STAT pathway in cytokine receptor signalling can activate STATs, which can bind to DNA and allow the transcription of genes involved in immune cell division, survival, activation and recruitment. For example, STAT1 can enable the transcription of genes which inhibit cell division and stimulate inflammation. Also, STAT4 is able to activate NK cells (natural killer cells), and STAT5 can drive the formation of white blood cells. In response to cytokines, such as IL-4, JAK-STAT signalling is also able to stimulate STAT6, which can promote B-cell proliferation, immune cell survival, and the production of an antibody called IgE.

== Role in development ==
JAK-STAT signalling plays an important role in animal development. The pathway can promote blood cell division, as well as differentiation (the process of a cell becoming more specialised). In some flies with faulty JAK genes, too much blood cell division can occur, potentially resulting in leukaemia. JAK-STAT signalling has also been associated with excessive white blood cell division in humans and mice.

The signalling pathway is also crucial for eye development in the fruit fly (&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;). When mutations occur in genes coding for JAKs, some cells in the eye may be unable to divide, and other cells, such as photoreceptor cells, have been shown not to develop correctly.

The entire removal of a JAK and a STAT in &quot;Drosophila&quot; causes death of &quot;Drosophila&quot; embryos, whilst mutations in the genes coding for JAKs and STATs can cause deformities in the body patterns of flies, particularly defects in forming body segments. One theory as to how interfering with JAK-STAT signalling might cause these defects is that STATs may directly bind to DNA and promote the transcription of genes involved in forming body segments, and therefore by mutating JAKs or STATs, flies experience segmentation defects. STAT binding sites have been identified on one of these genes, called &quot;even-skipped&quot; (&quot;eve&quot;), to support this theory. Of all the segment stripes affected by JAK or STAT mutations, the fifth stripe is affected the most, the exact molecular reasons behind this are still unknown.

== Regulation ==
Given the importance of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, particularly in cytokine signalling, there are a variety of mechanisms that cells possess to regulate the amount of signalling that occurs. Three major groups of proteins that cells use to regulate this signalling pathway are protein inhibitors of activated STAT (PIAS), protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS). Computational models of JAK-STAT signaling based on the laws of chemical kinetics have elucidated the importance of these different regulatory mechanisms on JAK-STAT signaling dynamics.

=== Protein inhibitors of activated STATs (PIAS) ===

PIAS are a four-member protein family made of: PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASx, and PIASγ. The proteins add a marker, called SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier), onto other proteins – such as JAKs and STATs, modifying their function. The addition of a SUMO group onto STAT1 by PIAS1 has been shown to prevent activation of genes by STAT1. Other studies have demonstrated that adding a SUMO group to STATs may block phosphorylation of tyrosines on STATs, preventing their dimerization and inhibiting JAK-STAT signalling. PIASγ has also been shown to prevent STAT1 from functioning. PIAS proteins may also function by preventing STATs from binding to DNA (and therefore preventing gene activation), and by recruiting proteins called histone deacetylases (HDACs), which lower the level of gene expression.

=== Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) ===
Since adding phosphate groups on tyrosines is such an important part of how the JAK-STAT signalling pathway functions, removing these phosphate groups can inhibit signalling. PTPs are tyrosine phosphatases, so are able to remove these phosphates and prevent signalling. Three major PTPs are SHP-1, SHP-2 and CD45. 
* SHP-1. SHP-1 is mainly expressed in blood cells. It contains two SH2 domains and a catalytic domain (the region of a protein that carries out the main function of the protein) - the catalytic domain contains the amino acid sequence VHCSAGIGRTG (a sequence typical of PTPs). As with all PTPs, a number of amino acid structures are essential for their function: conserved cysteine, arginine and glutamine amino acids, and a loop made of tryptophan, proline and aspartate amino acids (WPD loop). When SHP-1 is inactive, the SH2 domains interact with the catalytic domain, and so the phosphatase is unable to function. When SHP-1 is activated however, the SH2 domains move away from the catalytic domain, exposing the catalytic site and therefore allowing phosphatase activity. SHP-1 is then able to bind and remove phosphate groups from the JAKs associated with receptors, preventing the transphosphorylation needed for the signalling pathway to progress. 
One example of this is seen in the JAK-STAT signalling pathway mediated by the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). Here, SHP-1 binds directly to a tyrosine residue (at position 429) on EpoR and removes phosphate groups from the receptor-associated JAK2. The ability of SHP-1 to negatively regulate the JAK-STAT pathway has also been seen in experiments using mice lacking SHP-1. These mice experience characteristics of autoimmune diseases and show high levels of cell proliferation, which are typical characteristics of an abnormally high level of JAK-STAT signalling. Additionally, adding methyl groups to the SHP-1 gene (which reduces the amount of SHP-1 produced) has been linked to lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) .

However, SHP-1 may also promote JAK-STAT signalling. A study in 1997 found that SHP-1 potentially allows higher amounts of STAT activation, as opposed to reducing STAT activity. A detailed molecular understanding for how SHP-1 can both activate and inhibit the signalling pathway is still unknown. 
* SHP-2. SHP-2 has a very similar structure to SHP-1, but unlike SHP-1, SHP-2 is produced in many different cell types - not just blood cells. Humans have two SHP-2 proteins, each made up of 593 and 597 amino acids. The SH2 domains of SHP-2 appear to play an important role in controlling the activity of SHP-2. One of the SH2 domains binds to the catalytic domain of SHP-2, to prevent SHP-2 functioning. Then, when a protein with a phosphorylated tyrosine binds, the SH2 domain changes orientation and SHP-2 is activated. SHP-2 is then able to remove phosphate groups from JAKs, STATs and the receptors themselves - so, like SHP-1, can prevent the phosphorylation needed for the pathway to continue, and therefore inhibit JAK-STAT signalling. Like SHP-1, SHP-2 is able to remove these phosphate groups through the action of the conserved cysteine, arginine, glutamine and WPD loop.

Negative regulation by SHP-2 has been reported in a number of experiments - one example has been when exploring JAK1/STAT1 signalling, where SHP-2 is able to remove phosphate groups from proteins in the pathway, such as STAT1. In a similar manner, SHP-2 has also been shown to reduce signalling involving STAT3 and STAT5 proteins, by removing phosphate groups.

Like SHP-1, SHP-2 is also believed to promote JAK-STAT signalling in some instances, as well as inhibit signalling. For example, one study indicates that SHP-2 may promote STAT5 activity instead of reducing it. Also, other studies propose that SHP-2 may increase JAK2 activity, and promote JAK2/STAT5 signalling. It is still unknown how SHP2 can both inhibit and promote JAK-STAT signalling in the JAK2/STAT5 pathway; one theory is that SHP-2 may promote activation of JAK2, but inhibit STAT5 by removing phosphate groups from it. 
* CD45. CD45 is mainly produced in blood cells. In humans it has been shown to be able to act on JAK1 and JAK3, whereas in mice, CD45 is capable of acting on all JAKs. One study indicates that CD45 can reduce the amount of time that JAK-STAT signalling is active. The exact details of how CD45 functions is still unknown.

=== Suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) ===
There are eight protein members of the SOCS family: cytokine-inducible SH2 domain-containing protein (CISH), SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, SOCS4, SOCS5, SOCS6, and SOCS7, each protein has an SH2 domain and a 40-amino-acid region called the SOCS box. The SOCS box can interact with a number of proteins to form a protein complex, and this complex can then cause the breakdown of JAKs and the receptors themselves, therefore inhibiting JAK-STAT signalling. The protein complex does this by allowing a marker called ubiquitin to be added to proteins, in a process called ubiquitination, which signals for a protein to be broken down. The proteins, such as JAKs and the receptors, are then transported to a compartment in the cell called the proteasome, which carries out protein breakdown.

SOCS can also function by binding to proteins involved in JAK-STAT signalling and blocking their activity. For example, the SH2 domain of SOCS1 binds to a tyrosine in the activation loop of JAKs, which prevents JAKs from phosphorylating each other. The SH2 domains of SOCS2, SOCS3 and CIS bind directly to receptors themselves. Also, SOCS1 and SOCS3 can prevent JAK-STAT signalling by binding to JAKs, using segments called kinase inhibitory regions (KIRs) and stopping JAKs binding to other proteins. The exact details of how other SOCS function is less understood. 


== Clinical significance ==
Since the JAK-STAT pathway plays a major role in many fundamental processes, such as apoptosis and inflammation, dysfunctional proteins in the pathway may lead to a number of diseases. For example, alterations in JAK-STAT signalling can result in cancer and diseases affecting the immune system, such as severe combined immunodeficiency disorder (SCID).

=== Immune system-related diseases ===

JAK3 can be used for the signalling of IL-2, IL-4, IL-15 and IL-21 (as well as other cytokines); therefore patients with mutations in the JAK3 gene often experience issues affecting many aspects of the immune system. For example, non-functional JAK3 causes SCID, which results in patients having no NK cells, B cells or T cells, and this would make SCID individuals susceptible to infection. Mutations of the STAT5 protein, which can signal with JAK3, has been shown to result in autoimmune disorders.

It has been suggested that patients with mutations in STAT1 and STAT2 are often more likely to develop infections from bacteria and viruses. Also, STAT4 mutations have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and STAT6 mutations are linked to asthma.

Patients with a faulty JAK-STAT signalling pathway may also experience skin disorders. For example, non-functional cytokine receptors, and overexpression of STAT3 have both been associated with psoriasis (an autoimmune disease associated with red, flaky skin). STAT3 plays an important role in psoriasis, as STAT3 can control the production of IL-23 receptors, and IL-23 can help the development of Th17 cells, and Th17 cells can induce psoriasis. Also, since many cytokines function through the STAT3 transcription factor, STAT3 plays a significant role in maintaining skin immunity. In addition, because patients with JAK3 gene mutations have no functional T cells, B cells or NK cells, they would more likely to develop skin infections.

=== Cancer ===
Cancer involves abnormal and uncontrollable cell growth in a part of the body. Therefore, since JAK-STAT signalling can allow the transcription of genes involved in cell division, one potential effect of excessive JAK-STAT signalling is cancer formation. High levels of STAT activation have been associated with cancer; in particular, high amounts of STAT3 and STAT5 activation is mostly linked to more dangerous tumours. For example, too much STAT3 activity has been associated with increasing the likelihood of melanoma (skin cancer) returning after treatment and abnormally high levels of STAT5 activity have been linked to a greater probability of patient death from prostate cancer. 
Altered JAK-STAT signalling can also be involved in developing breast cancer. JAK-STAT signalling in mammary glands (located within breasts) can promote cell division and reduce cell apoptosis during pregnancy and puberty, and therefore if excessively activated, cancer can form. High STAT3 activity plays a major role in this process, as it can allow the transcription of genes such as &quot;BCL2&quot; and &quot;c-Myc&quot;, which are involved in cell division.

Mutations in JAK2 can lead to leukaemia and lymphoma. Specifically, mutations in exons 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the JAK2 gene are proposed to be a risk factor in developing lymphoma or leukemia. Additionally, mutated STAT3 and STAT5 can increase JAK-STAT signalling in NK and T cells, which promotes very high proliferation of these cells, and increases the likelihood of developing leukaemia. Also, a JAK-STAT signalling pathway mediated by erythropoietin (EPO), which usually allows the development of red blood cells, may be altered in patients with leukemia.

=== Covid-19 ===

The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and the activator of the transcription (STAT) pathway were at the centre of attention for driving hyperinflammation in COVID-19, i.e., the SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers hyperinflammation through the JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in the recruitment of dendritic cells, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as differentiation of B cells and T cells progressing towards cytokine storm.

=== Treatments ===
Since excessive JAK-STAT signalling is responsible for some cancers and immune disorders, JAK inhibitors have been proposed as drugs for therapy. For instance, to treat some forms of leukaemia, targeting and inhibiting JAKs could eliminate the effects of EPO signalling and perhaps prevent the development of leukaemia. One example of a JAK inhibitor drug is ruxolitinib, which is used as a JAK2 inhibitor. STAT inhibitors are also being developed, and many of the inhibitors target STAT3. It has been reported that therapies which target STAT3 can improve the survival of patients with cancer. Another drug, called Tofacitinib, has been used for psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis treatment, and has been approved for treatment of Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis.

<text>Augustus Addison Gould (April 23, 1805 – September 15, 1866) was an American naturalist and the foremost conchologist of his era. He described over 1,100 new species of mollusks, including all known mollusks of Massachusetts and the shells collected by two major government exploring expeditions. He was one of the first naturalists in America to recognize the importance of geographic distribution in the description of species.

==Biography==
Born in New Ipswich, New Hampshire, he was the son of music teacher Nathaniel Duren Gould (1781–1864) who was also noted for his penmanship.

===Physician===
He graduated from Harvard College in 1825, and took his degree of doctor of medicine in 1830. &quot;Establishing himself in Boston, he devoted himself to the practice of medicine, and finally rose to high professional rank and social position. He became president of the Massachusetts Medical Society, and was employed in editing the vital statistics of the state.&quot; In 1848, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 1855 he delivered the annual address at the Massachusetts Medical Society, entitled &quot;Search Out the Secrets of Nature.&quot; He was its president from 1864 until his death. In 1856, he was appointed visiting physician to the Massachusetts General Hospital.

===Naturalist===
&quot;As a conchologist his reputation was worldwide, and he was one of the pioneers of the science in America. His writings fill many pages of the publications of the &quot;Boston Society of Natural History&quot; (see vol. xi. p. 197 for a list) and other periodicals. He published with Louis Agassiz the &quot;Principles of Zoology&quot; (2nd ed. 1851).&quot; He taught botany and zoology at Harvard for two years. When Charles Lyell visited the United States in order to pursue his geological investigations, he immediately sought the aid of Gould as a co-worker.

&quot;Gould edited &quot;The terrestrial air-breathing mollusks of the United States, and the adjacent territories of North America&quot; – &quot;Volume 1&quot; (1851–1855) of Amos Binney (1803–1847). He translated Lamarck&#x27;s &quot;Genera of Shells&quot; (1833).&quot;

&quot;The two most important monuments to his scientific work, however, are &quot;Mollusca and Shells&quot; (vol. xii, 1852) of the United States Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842 under Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, published by the government, and the &quot;Report on the Invertebrata&quot; published by order of the legislature of Massachusetts in 1841. A second edition of the latter work was authorized in 1865, and published in 1870 after the author&#x27;s death.
In 1860, Gould also reported on shells collected by the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition.&quot;

&quot;Gould was a corresponding member of all the prominent American scientific societies, and of many of those of Europe, including the London Royal Society.&quot;

He died in Boston on September 15, 1866, and was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery.

<text>A student council (also known as a student union, associated student body or student parliament) is an administrative organization of students in different educational institutes ranging from elementary schools to universities and research organizations around the world. These councils exist in most public and private K-12 school systems in different countries. Many universities, both private and public, have a student council as an apex body of all their students&#x27; organisations. Student councils often serve to engage students in learning about democracy and leadership, as originally espoused by John Dewey in &quot;&quot; (1917).

==Function==
The student council helps share ideas, interests, and concerns with teachers and institute administrative authorities. It also helps raise funds for school-wide activities, including social events, community projects, helping people in need and school reform. Most schools participate in food drives, fundraisers and parties. Many members learn skills that were an extension of their formal education.

Student councils operate in many forms. There are representative-based and modeled loosely after the U.S. Congress, or based on the Executive Branch of the United States, with a President, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, and reporter. In this form student representatives and officers are usually elected from and by the student body, although there may be prerequisites for candidacy or suffrage. In elementary schools, there are typically one or two student representatives per classroom and one presiding set of officers. However, many secondary schools have one set of officers per grade level.

An example of the structure of an elementary student council may include a president, a vice president, secretary, treasurer, sergeant of arms, fundraising officer, historian, boys rep, girls rep, and just members. These roles may be assigned or voted on, either within the student council or by the entire student body. They may also reflect descending grade-levels, with the president in the oldest grade, and so forth. Secondary school governments often have more independence and power than younger governments. Often a student government is overseen by a sponsor, which is usually a teacher at that particular school. Most junior or middle school student councils have a constitution of some sort and usually do not have a judicial branch. Compared to elementary school councils, junior high and high school councils generally have fewer people.

In some schools, a student council representative is assigned to each class. That person passes on requests, ideas and complaints from students in that class to the student council. In other schools, the elected Class Officers are automatically members of the student council.

Student councils usually do not have funding authority and generally must generate their operating funds through fundraisers such as car washes and bake sales. Some student councils have a budget from the school, along with responsibility for funding a variety of student activities within a school.

==Regional and national structures==

Student councils can have institutional power as in Spain and Germany, where they serve a political force that mediates between students and educational institutions, or they can be elected or non-elected clubs dedicated to organising fund-raisers and events.

Student councils can join larger associations, like in the United States, the National Association of Student Councils. In Canada, the Canadian Student Leadership Association coordinates the national scene, and in the United Kingdom an organization called involver provides training, support and coordination for the nation&#x27;s student councils

=== Argentina ===

=== Bulgaria ===
In Bulgaria most of the universities have a student council, regulated by law and the regulations of each university.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the student council is used for helping the school with special events and planning other events. Student councils in Canada also act as a body to advocate for student issues like tuitions.

=== Chile ===
=== Finland ===
Secondary high schools, &quot;lukio&quot;, and vocational schools in Finland have student councils. They incorporate all the students of the institution, but their status is marginal, locally and nationally. Legislation demands that they should be heard in all matters pertaining to the education in the institution, but this is often not done.

=== Germany ===

Student representation is very important in the German school system. Each state in the Federal Republic of Germany has its own peculiarities in the system, but they are by and large similar. Although education in Germany is a matter for the federal states, there is a Federal student Conference where all state student councils can elect delegates to participate and exchange views on nationwide problems that arise in education. Every school in Germany has a student council. In the case of major changes that affect school life, the student council must agree. According to the student council, every district or larger city has a District student council/City student council. At the municipal level, these councils deal with the school authorities and with the individual institutions, such as school offices, etc. Above this there is a state student representation in each state, where delegates from each district/city of the respective state come to exchange ideas. This body is granted extensive rights such as a budget of between €40,000 and €70,000 for material costs, but is also obliged to consult with the Ministry of Education when important decisions are made.

=== Greece ===
In Greece, student representation is considered the limestone of democracy. All public secondary schools have a student council which consists of 15 members: a president, a vice-president, a secretary and 12 equal voting members. Additionally, all classes have a separate student council which consists of 5 members: a president, a secretary, a treasurer and 2 equal voting members.

By law, every school should elect these councils around when a month has passed since the start of the school year. The 5-member councils for each class are elected first, and about a week later the 15-member school council is elected.

As of 2024, these councils don&#x27;t play a role in school life. Their role is mostly to give suggestions to the school staff about the school and excursions, with no guarantee of them accepting their suggestions. In recent years, the votes of the 15-member councils have been used by students to close a school for a few days because of a dispute the students have with the staff (κατάληψη). These councils, and especially the 5-member class councils have mostly educational value on teaching students how to vote, and actual power is none or very limited. On average, a 15-member school council will convene less than five times in a school year, and a 5-member class council less than three.

=== Hong Kong ===
In Hong Kong, some secondary schools have student councils, while some have Students&#x27; Unions. Student councils are directly elected by the student population, and are formed by the winning cabinet. A hierarchical structure is maintained, with positions like Secretaries/Coordinators for internal and external affairs, Treasurer, Vice-chairpersons and chairperson. Student councils represent the student body, organise events and provide welfare for students.

=== India ===
In India, student councils are rare in elementary and middle schools. They are established in many secondary and higher secondary schools and are most commonly instituted in universities.

Student councils in India may be elected, nominated or selected after interview (or written examination or both). In universities, they are elected by ballot.

=== Indonesia ===

The student councils in Indonesia are officially formed by the government and is called OSIS (abbreviation of &quot;Organisasi Siswa Intra Sekolah&quot;, Intraschool Organization of Students). OSIS, introduced in 1970, are legally mandated to exist in all junior high schools and senior high schools. Every year, the committee which usually consists of teachers and former student council members hold a selection process to admit students who meet qualifications to join OSIS, while the president is voted by students of the school. In some practices, the teachers can also vote depending on their own regulation.

=== Iran ===
In Iran, each November since 1997, elementary, secondary, and high school students at each school in the nation elect between 5-14 Student Council members, which act as the main medium of communication and debate between the student body and school officials. The size of the Council at each school depends largely on the class size and school policies. Student councils in Iran mainly promote interpersonal and leadership skills, constructive debates between school officials and the students, and the organization of school activities and field trips.

The student council body of the schools, cities, regions, and the national parliament are the same and include a president, a vice-president, a secretary, and some main members. There is also a &quot;Student council of the Provinces &quot; from among the presidents of the City Student Councils, and the presidents of these councils, who are 9th-grade or high school students, are several boys and girls who are representatives of their Provinces students in the &quot;National Student Parliament&quot;.

Each province has between 2 and 4 girl and boy representatives and these representatives are officially and legally responsible for leading and addressing the problems of students in their Provinces and improving the education system; The members of the &quot;Student Parliament&quot; (also called Student Council) in Iran are elected for a period of 2 years and during this period they have at least 2 official sessions in the main parliament of the country, with the presence of the Minister of Education and can express their demands and suggestions directly with the Minister of Education. Students and officials in Iran attach great importance to choosing a smart person and a very strong leader to represent their school, city, province, and country.

=== Ireland ===
Since 1998 in Ireland there has been sustained development of student councils in post primary schools. In 2008 the Irish Second Level Students Union was founded as the National Umbrella body to organise and coordinate the national campaign efforts of the student councils. The Union is also a member of OBESSU. Schools and staff are advised to assist the creation of a student council under section 27 of The Education Act 1998

=== Israel ===

Israel&#x27;s national student and youth council (Hebrew: מועצת התלמידים והנוער הארצית) is an elected body representing all youth in Israel since 1993. Representatives are elected democratically from district youth councils. (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Center, Haifa, Arab sector, South, North and the regional schools).
The council comprises youth from the different sectors: religious, secular, Jewish, Arab, Druze and a Bedouin representative.
The National Youth Council representatives mediate between Government decision makers and the Youth representatives. They participate in the various &quot;Knesset&quot; (the Israeli parliament) committees: Education, internal Affairs, Violence, Drugs and Science. Youth representatives participate in committees dealing with youth-related issues such as: children&#x27;s rights, violence, delinquency and youngsters at risk - cut off from mainstream youth. Youth representatives also participate in discussions concerning matriculation examinations, discussing a national project on school trips, delegations Youth representatives youth, are invited by high officials, ministers and even the president and officials from foreign countries.
Israel&#x27;s national student and youth council is the first youth council in the world that made student rights legislation. 
In 2006 graduates of the Israel&#x27;s national student and youth council founded an association named Bematana. The association&#x27;s mission is to promote young leaders who are elected as representatives in student and youth councils in Israel.
in 2012 the Israel&#x27;s national student and youth council held the International Youth Leadership Conference under the slogan. &quot;Take The Lead!&quot;

=== Japan ===

Based on alumni associations which were existed as high-level organizations of extracurricular activities, student councils were added to Japanese schools after World War II. In Japanese schools, students in a class stay together as a cohesive set in the same homeroom for most of the day. Each class has one or more elected representatives who reports to student council. The student council consists of members who are elected by the student body. The council is often responsible for organizing events such as the culture festival, sports day, and class field trips.

=== Malaysia ===
In Malaysia public secondary schools student councils are usually run and managed by the school&#x27;s prefects, also known as the Prefectorial Board. They act as the representatives between the students and the teachers. Some schools also have the prefects managed by a few groups of select teachers known as disciplinary teachers, or directly under the head teacher of discipline. Depending on each school&#x27;s individual system, the Prefectorial Board either have open recruitment for any students interested but requiring them to undergo a year&#x27;s worth of training and probation, direct recruitment via recommendations made by either teachers or senior prefects (usually students who show excel in their studies and activities) or both. Some schools have the best students from each class selected to be prefects. Positions such as head prefect (the equivalent of student president), assistant head prefect, secretary and treasurers are usually elected by students. Some schools have an internal election among prefects or have the teacher select a few possible candidates for such roles before letting the students vote. These positions form the high council or high committee. Secretary and treasurers sometimes come with assistants, either appointed by the position holder, the committee or they are voted just like the other members. Some schools will have additional positions such as &#x27;Head of Discipline&#x27; or &#x27;Head of Statistics&#x27; who themselves have a committee of their own to manage different aspects of the school.

Those not part of the high committee are then given roles and positions based on their merit and skills to form different committees to oversee different aspects of the school such as club activities, moral enforcement, school events or even paperwork management. While a prefect&#x27;s main job is to enforce discipline and be the eyes of the school, those with roles and positions have to carry out their specific duties while managing their responsibilities as prefects. These committees are headed by the high committee members who also have to manage the students and the school. Sometimes, class monitors (who also act as class reps) take part in discussions and meetings held by prefects to better engage with the students. They may also be included as part of the committees but as normal students. Each classroom also has their own committee consisting of roles such as class monitor, assistant monitor, treasurer and secretary to manage things in their own classes.

While prefects enforce the school rules and assist the teachers, they also act as the voice of students when it comes to issues concerning the well-being of students. They essentially have full influence and control over school policies. However, as school laws are created by the Malaysian Ministry of Education, the prefects have no power in amending laws.

Prefects in Malaysian schools can be identified by their distinctive blue uniform that make them stand out from normal students. Primary schools also have a prefectorial board by on a much smaller scale.

=== Norway ===
All schools in Norway are required by law to have a student council elected by the students. The aim of student council is usually to improve their school through encouraging social, cultural and other extracurricular events in the local community. The student councils in Norway are governed by a Board of Directors which is either elected directly or by the student council.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, Student Councils are being introduced in many Private and Public Schools. Student council are playing an important role in Pakistani schools.

A Student council in Pakistan may be elected, nominated or selected after interview or written examination or both, but can also be based on academic behaviour or discipline.
Sometimes council members are elected based on general elections and if the teacher voted on a good student based on records and grades.

=== Philippines ===
Student governments of different schools throughout the Philippines are often directly elected by student body members of the class or organization which they supposedly govern with all positions (President, Vice President, Secretary, etc.) being separately elected, resulting in a wide variety of mixing and matching between different student political parties. Student governments in the Philippines are always called as the &quot;Supreme Secondary Learner Government&quot;, or &quot;SSLG&quot; in short for all public educational institutions catering to Grades 7 to 12; while, elementary-based student governments catering to Grades 1 to 6 are called &quot;Supreme Elementary Learner Government&quot; or &quot;SELG&quot;. Meanwhile, private schools whether nonsectarian or sectarian institutions also have their respective student council; however, they vary from form-to-form from their name to the function of the student government itself. The SSLG is called formerly called as the &quot;Supreme Student Government&quot; or &quot;SSG&quot; until the issuance of OUOPS No. 2023-03 from the education department which revised some of the student council laws and policies, in addition to the adaptation of the current name known today - the SSLG.

Aside from the school-based SSLG&#x27;s, which is always present in all public schools under the Department of Education (Philippines); there is also a division-level Federation of SSLG&#x27;s (a division is typically composed of a component or an independent city or an entire province), a regional federation of SSLG&#x27;s (composed of all division-level SSLG&#x27;s that are in a particular region of the Philippines); and a national federation - called as the &quot;NFSSLG&quot; or the &quot;National Federation of Supreme Secondary Learner Governments&quot; (composed of all regional federation SSLG&#x27;s except the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao). Those who enter as an officer of a higher SSLG Federation level are typically Presidents who won in an election against their colleagues from a smaller subdivision (e.g. School-based Presidents of a Division compete each other to enter the Division-Federation and so forth...). SSLG Federations also have their counterpart, the SELG Federations - only for elementary student governments which follows the same process as the aforementioned.

=== Singapore ===
In Singapore many secondary schools have a student council, which provides a medium for communication between the students and the school administration, a form of student welfare, and an important event-organising body. Some secondary schools name their student council like &quot;Student Leader Board&quot; or &quot;Student Leader Committee&quot;, etc. They are usually nominated by peers and subsequently elected based on the decision of the teachers overseeing the student leader body.
In Junior Colleges, student councils serve a greater purpose than their younger counterparts. They are given more autonomy in their planning and execution of school events.

=== Spain ===
Most Spanish universities have student councils which are regulated by law. Some of the basic points are the 24% of student representation in the board. Each university council is elected by universal suffrage of the students.

These are organised by regional students councils such as CEUCAT in Catalonia. There is a national students council called CEUNE, which is the interlocutor between the Universities Ministry and the university students.

=== United Kingdom ===
Student Councils (sometimes Student Voice, School Council, Student Parliament, and Student Union) at secondary school level are usually bodies nominated by teachers in state schools (and public and private schools without a house system). There are some regional networks between the representative bodies.

Furthermore, in England, some Student Councils maintain quite a hierarchical structure: the Representatives at the bottom, followed by the Secretary, Treasurer, Vice-chairman and chairman. This latter position is arguably the most important as it is down to this one person to run and organise the council, ensure relevant topics are discussed and—when necessary—remove members.

In Wales, the School Councils (Wales) Regulations 2005 made the establishment of School Councils a statutory requirement on all maintained primary and secondary schools in the country. The regulations also require that Councils meet regularly, that members of the School Council are elected by fellow pupils by means of a secret ballot, and that the School Council can nominate up to two of their number to serve as associate members on the school&#x27;s Board of Governors.

In universities, the student council is the apex body of the students and members are elected in systematic votings. In many universities, it also functions as an umbrella parliament for students&#x27; unions from different institutes.

=== United States ===
Associated student body organizations in the United States function often similarly to others. In most educational systems the council is considered to be an elective/club of individuals working for unity upon their campuses. The club fundraises, supports students, and hosts events such as dances.

<text>Marilyn Brick is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. She served in the Manitoba legislature from 2003 to 2011, representing St. Norbert.

==Biography==
Brick was educated at the University of Manitoba, graduating from the university&#x27;s Bachelor of Physical Education program and receiving a Continuing Education Division Certificate in Human Resource Management. She has been involved in a number of community programs, serving as President of the Richmond Kings Community Centre and as a member of the Manitoba Parks and Recreation Association Board of Governors. Brick has also founded a day care advocacy group, received a Citation Award for volunteer service to the Red Cross, and served on the Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 500.

Prior to her election, Brick worked in the Community Services Department of the City of Winnipeg. She had previously held several other positions in the city, working in the field of Recreation Services and Marketing.

<text>Clostoken or Cloghastookeen is a small townland in the civil parish of Kilconickny, near the town of Loughrea in County Galway, Ireland. It takes its name from an old ruined castle. Today, the name is more commonly used to refer to the civil parish of Kilconickny. 

==Name==

According to &quot;O&#x27;Donovan&#x27;s Field Name Books&quot; (1862), the Irish language form of the name is Cloch stúincín, meaning &quot;stone of the little prominence&quot;. Other forms include Clostoken, Closetaken, Cloghstockin, Cloghastockin, Cloghstokin, Cloghastookeen and Clostaken.
Joyce (1910) writes &quot;Near Loughrea in Galway, is a townland called Cloghastookeen, the stone fortress of the little pinnacle, which received its name from a castle of the Burkes, the ruins of which still remain.
The townland gives its name to Clostoken &amp; Kilconieran parish.
There were three ecclesiastical parishes in the Middle Ages; Kilconickny (now Clostoken), Kilconieran and Lickerrig (now Carrabane).
The three are now united in the large parish of Clostoken &amp; Kilconieran.

==Location==

Cloghastookeen is in the Electoral Division of Kilconickny.
Bordering townlands are Carrowclogh to the south, Kilmurry to the east, Knockadaumore to the east, Saintclerans to the north and Srah to the west.
The area of the townland is .
O&#x27;Donovan writes; &quot;This is a small townland, all arable and used as pasture land. It contains no antiquities, nor anything remarkable. It does have extensive ruins of a castle.&quot;
This is Cloastoken Old Castle.

==People==

The 1826 Tithe Appointment Books list 10 households in Cloghastookeen townland: Coniff, Glenane, Glenane, Glenane, Kelly, Kelly, O&#x27;Bryen, O&#x27;Laughlin, Walsh and Walsh.
The Miller family of Cromwellian settlers inherited part of the Cloghastookeen estate through marriage with a Croasdaile heiress. 
In 1855 Croasdaile Bowen Miller was one of the principal lessors in the parish of Kilconickny.
Griffith&#x27;s Valuation, published between 1847 and 1864, gives the area of the townland as .
The land value at that time was £.100-14s.-2d.
Four households were listed: Darcy, Walsh, Walsh and Miller.
In the 1911 census there was just one household in the townland, Sherry, with 10 people aged 5 to 65.

<text>A photographic essay or photo-essay for short is a form of visual storytelling, a way to present a narrative through a series of images. A photo essay delivers a story using a series of photographs and brings the viewer along a narrative journey.

Examples of photo essays include:

* A web page or portion of a web site.
* A single montage or collage of photographic images, with text or other additions, intended to be viewed both as a whole and as individual photographs. Such a work may also fall in the category of mixed media.
* An art show which is staged at a particular time and location. Some such shows may also fall into other categories.
* In fashion publishing especially, a photo-editorial – an editorial-style article dominated by or entirely consisting of a series of thematic photographs.

Photographers known for their photo-essays include:
* W. Eugene Smith
* Ansel Adams
**Adams&#x27;s &quot;Born Free and Equal&quot; (1944) documented Japanese Americans held at the Manzanar War Relocation Center during World War II.
* Gordon Parks&#x27; &quot;A Harlem Family&quot; are acclaimed for showing a glimpse into the lives of the sick and impoverished.
* James Nachtwey
* William Klein
* Peter Funch&#x27;s much-reposted photo series, for which Funch photographed the same street corner for nine years.
* Henry Grossman — known for his photographs of celebrities such as John F. Kennedy and the Beatles, Grossman published numerous photo-essays of Broadway for &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

Many photo-essays moved from printed press to the web.

<text>Vijay Satyanand Pande is a Trinidadian–American scientist and venture capitalist. Pande is best known for orchestrating the distributed computing protein-folding research project known as Folding@home. His research is focused on distributed computing and computer-modelling of microbiology, and on improving computer simulations regarding drug-binding, protein design, and synthetic biomimetic polymers. He is currently a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

==Career==
Pande is an adjunct professor of structural biology at Stanford University. Previously, he was the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Chemistry and professor of structural biology and of computer science. He was also director of the biophysics program.

In 2015, Pande became the ninth general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. He is the founding investor of their Bio + Health Fund.

Pande serves on the boards of Apeel Sciences, Bayesian Health, BioAge Labs, Citizen, Devoted Health, Freenome, Insitro, Nautilus Biotechnology, Nobell, Omada Health, Q.bio, and Scribe Therapeutics, a CRISPR company co-founded by 2020 Nobel Laureate Jennifer Doudna. He has also been a founder and advisor to startups in Silicon Valley.

Pande has written for &quot;Time&quot;, STAT News, Fortune, and the New York Times, among others.

=== Globavir Biosciences, Inc. ===
In 2014, Pande co-founded Globavir Biosciences, an infectious disease startup addressing antibiotic resistance threats in developed countries as well as needs in viral infections around the world, including Ebola and dengue fever.

=== Pande Lab at Stanford University ===
Pande founded the Pande Lab at Stanford University. The lab brings together researchers from many departments, including chemistry, computer science, structural biology, physics, biophysics, and biochemistry.

=== Distributed computing ===
Pande is the founder of the Folding@home research project. The protein-folding computer simulations from the Folding@home project are said to be &quot;quantitatively&quot; comparable to real-world experimental results. The method for this yield has been called a &quot;holy grail&quot; in computational biology. Folding@home was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records in 2007 as the most powerful distributed computing network in the world.

Pande directed the now-defunct Genome@home project with the goal to understand the nature of genes and proteins by virtually designing new forms of them. Genome@home started to close as early as March 2004, after accumulating a large database of protein sequences.

Some of the programs and libraries involved are free software with GPL, LGPL, and BSD licenses, but the Folding@home client and core remain proprietary.

=== Stanford Bitcoin Group and Bitcoin Mafia ===
With colleague Balaji Srinivisan, Pande supervised the Stanford Bitcoin Group, a bitcoin research team born of hackathon activities in Pande and Srinvisan’s Stanford CS 184 class. The Stanford Bitcoin Group consisted of seven core members and included Ryan Breslow, a founder of Cognito, a developer at Coinbase and then Netflix, and a developer at Google.

== Early life and education ==
Pande graduated from Langley High School&#x27;s class of 1988 while growing up in McLean, Virginia. In 1992, Pande received his B.A. in physics from Princeton University. He received a PhD in physics from MIT in 1995.

While in high school, Pande won fourth place in the 1988 Westinghouse Science Talent Search for a computer simulation of a space-based ballistic missile defense.

After graduating from high school in 1988, Pande worked briefly at the video game development company Naughty Dog in the early 1990s while in his late teens, serving as a programmer and designer on their 1991 release &quot;Rings of Power&quot;. While Pande was attending MIT and Naughty Dog was based in Boston, he portrayed the secret boss character in the 3DO fighting game &quot;Way of the Warrior&quot;.

He is married, has two children and likes cats.

==Awards==
In 2002, he was named a Frederick E. Terman Fellow and an award recipient of &quot;MIT Technology Review&quot;&#x27;s TR100. The following year, he was awarded the Henry and Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar award. In 2004, he received a Technovator award from Global Indus Technovators in its Biotech/Med/Healthcare category. In 2006, Pande was awarded the Irving Sigal Young Investigator Award from the Protein Society. In 2008, he was named &quot;Netxplorateur of 2008&quot;. Also in 2008 he was given the Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award and became a Fellow of the American Physical Society. Pande received the 2012 Michael and Kate Bárány Award for developing computational models for proteins and RNA. In 2015, Pande received the DeLano Award for Computational Biosciences, as well as the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Distinguished Chair in Chemistry.

<text>Join the Army is the second studio album by American crossover thrash band Suicidal Tendencies. It was released in April 1987, and is one of the most well known albums for crossing over the genres of punk and thrash metal, known as crossover thrash, a genre that Suicidal Tendencies have been credited for creating. &quot;Join the Army&quot; is arguably one of Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; most popular efforts, although it only reached No. 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. This was their first album with guitarist Rocky George and drummer R.J. Herrera, and their last recording with bassist Louiche Mayorga (although he did co-write songs on their next album &quot;How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can&#x27;t Even Smile Today&quot;). This is also the last album to feature the band playing hardcore punk before an extended period with a more thrash metal focus. However, on some more recent albums, hardcore punk is again part of the mix.

==Musical style==
Mike Muir used vastly different vocal techniques and range compared to their debut album (sometimes sounding similar to Lemmy from Motörhead). Original guitarist Grant Estes had been replaced by Jon Nelson in 1984, who was then soon replaced by Rocky George, who influenced the change of the band&#x27;s sound into the thrash direction. Original drummer Amery Smith was replaced by R.J. Herrera, who used the particularly metal drum feature of double kick.

==Reception and legacy==

Reviews for &quot;Join the Army&quot; were mostly positive. AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia gave it three stars out of five and called it &quot;a transitional album in the transformation of the band&#x27;s sound from hardcore punk to thrash metal&quot;.

&quot;Join the Army&quot; was also the first Suicidal Tendencies album to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; it peaked at No. 100, and remained on the chart for thirteen weeks. &quot;Possessed to Skate&quot; preceded the album&#x27;s release as a single, which also had a music video created for it. The video featured skateboarding tricks, and as such is considered a classic visual period piece of skateboarding. The success of &quot;Join the Army&quot; garnered 
attention from major labels, including Epic Records, with whom Suicidal Tendencies would eventually sign in 1988.

&quot;War Inside My Head&quot; is featured in the game &quot;Guitar Hero: Metallica&quot;. &quot;Possessed to Skate&quot; is featured in the game &quot;Skate 2&quot;. &quot;Suicidal Maniac&quot; was covered by Hatebreed on their 2009 release &quot;For the Lions&quot;.

Over the years and with the involvement several line-ups, Suicidal Tendencies have recorded new versions of 10 of the 13 songs originally included in &quot;Join the Army&quot;, including two different new versions of two of those tracks: &quot;War Inside My Head&quot; and &quot;A Little Each Day&quot; (&quot;Still Cyco After All These Years&quot;); &quot;Join the Army&quot; and &quot;Go Skate! (Possessed to Skate &#x27;97)&quot; (&quot;Prime Cuts&quot;); &quot;Two Wrongs Don&#x27;t Make a Right&quot; (&quot;Year of the Cycos&quot;); &quot;Suicidal Maniac&quot;, &quot;Possessed to Skate&quot;, &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, &quot;I Feel Your Pain... And I Survive&quot;, &quot;Join the ST Army&quot;, &quot;No Name, No Words&quot;, and &quot;Born to Be Cyco&quot; (&quot;No Mercy Fool!/The Suicidal Family&quot;).

==Track listing==

* &quot;War Inside My Head&quot;, &quot;Human Guinea Pig&quot;, and &quot;You Got, I Want&quot; were originally written by previous guitarist Jon Nelson. He traded the rights for &quot;War Inside My Head&quot; for a Flying V guitar after he left the band.
* A different version of &quot;War Inside My Head&quot; was played live and existed as early as 1982, but with a different arrangement and lyrics. The song is sometimes labeled as &quot;War Inside Myself&quot; on certain bootleg releases but is an entirely different song that appeared on the 2nd Demo in 1982.
*&quot;Human Guinea Pig&quot; does not appear on vinyl or cassette versions of the album.

<text>Znak () was an association of lay Catholics in Poland, active between 1956 and 1976.

It was created as one of several smaller groups that split from the communist-controlled association PAX of Bolesław Piasecki in 1956. It was granted with several seats in the Polish Sejm and was intended as a link between the Catholic Church and the state. As such, it was allowed to cooperate with various Western European catholic movements, among them the German section of the International Catholic Peace Movement Pax Christi.

It was composed of the members of Klub Inteligencji Katolickiej (&quot;Club of Catholic Intelligentsia&quot;) and journalists of the newspaper &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot;. Among the most prominent members of Znak were:
* Tadeusz Mazowiecki
* Jerzy Zawieyski
* Stefan Kisielewski
* Stanisław Stomma 
* Wanda Pieniężna
* Janusz Zabłocki

During the March 1968 Events, an anti-Semitic and anti-intelligentsia campaign of Władysław Gomułka, Znak was the only political organisation in Sejm to protest. In 1976, the only member of Znak in the Sejm, Stanisław Stomma, abstained from voting and was one of only two Members of Parliament not to approve the amendment of Polish constitution underlining the leading role of the communist party and the &quot;eternal friendship&quot; with the Soviet Union. As a reprisal, Znak was disbanded.

A remainder of the group existed until 1980 when it was renamed to &quot;Polski Związek Katolicko-Społeczny&quot;, which like the Znak had representatives in the Sejm and continues today as a Catholic charity organisation that was notable for its opposition to martial law in Poland.

<doc id="969873" wikidata="Q1148864" url="?curid=969873" title="Cyrix Cx486SLC">
<text>The Cyrix Cx486SLC is a x86 microprocessor that was developed by Cyrix. It was one of Cyrix&#x27;s first CPU offerings, released after years of selling math coprocessors that competed with Intel&#x27;s units and offered better performance at a comparable or lower price. It was announced in March of 1992, and released 2 months later in May, with a price of $119. It was priced competitively against the Intel 486SX, causing Intel to lower the price of their chip from $286 to $119 in just days.

== Specifications ==
The 486SLC is based on the i386SX bus, and was intended as an entry-level chip to compete with the Intel 386SX and 486SX. SGS-Thomson and Texas Instruments manufactured the 486SLC for Cyrix. Texas Instruments also sold it under its own name as TX486SLC. Later, Texas Instruments also released their own version of the chip, the TI486SXLC which featured 8KB internal cache vs 1KB in the original Cyrix design. These chips went under the name Potomac, and Cyrix would receive full royalties for them. The similarly named IBM 486SLC, 486SLC2, 486SLC3 (16-bit external bus version of IBM 486DLC aka Blue Lightning) and IBM 386SLC are often confused with the Cyrix chips, but are not related and instead based on an Intel CPU core.

Introduced in May 1992, like the later and more famous Cyrix Cx5x86 it was a hybrid CPU, incorporating features of a new CPU (in this case the Intel 80486) while having a pin out similar to the existing 386SX, enabling existing board designs to be easily modified for the new chip. It ran at speeds of 20, 25, 33, and 40 MHz, although it had difficulty running reliably at 40 MHz using some operating systems. In December 1992 Cyrix also released the Cyrix Cx486SLC/e (25, 33 MHz) which offered power management, and a low voltage laptop version, the 3.3v Cyrix Cx486SLC/e-V (20, 25 MHz). In December 1993 Cyrix released a clock doubled version (25/50 MHz) cx486SLC2, as well as a clip-on upgrade for 386SX systems, the cx486SRx2 (16/33, 20/40 &amp; 25/50 MHz).

The 486SLC can be described as a 386SX with the 486 instruction set and 1K of onboard L1 cache added. Unfortunately it inherited the 386SX&#x27;s 24-bit address bus (16 MB max. DRAM), and 16-bit datapath which limited its memory bandwidth. Like the 386 and 486SX, it had no on-board x87 math coprocessor, but unlike the 486SX, it could make use of an Intel i287, 387SX or compatible x87 coprocessor. Due to the limitations of the 386SX&#x27;s bus and its smaller L1 cache, its performance could not compete with the 486SX when the latter was running on a full 32-bit bus.

The 486SLC was primarily used in very inexpensive low-end motherboards and PC clones. Because of its low power consumption, it also saw use in laptops. The 486SLC was also available as a 32-bit version based on the i386DX bus, see 486DLC.
== Versions ==
=== Cx486SLC/SLC2 ===
The base 486SLC, which had speeds of 20, 25, 33, and 40 MHz with 1 KB of cache and a 16-bit bus. A later version, the 486SLC2, ran at 50 MHz.
=== TI486SLC ===
TI&#x27;s rebranded version of the Cx486SLC.
=== TI486SXLC/SXLC2 ===
The TI486SXLC/SXLC was Texas Instrument&#x27;s version of the Cx486SLC. They had 8 KB of cache over the original 1 KB, a 32-bit internal data bus, and supported clock-doubling.
=== Cx486SRx2 ===
== Intel v. Cyrix lawsuit ==
Before even announcing the chip in March of 1992, Intel filed a lawsuit against Cyrix for patent infringement. Prior to this, Cyrix asked for a declaratory judgement that would prevent Intel from suing Cyrix. Texas Instruments joined the suit shortly after with an intervene, siding with Cyrix.

Cyrix used SGS-Thomson as a second manufacturer of the chip, as the company had license to use Intel&#x27;s patents. Intel however claimed the licence SGS-Thomson had was never intended to allow companies like Cyrix to circumvent Intel patents, which Intel stated was &quot;patent laundering&quot;.

The lawsuit, which concluded in 1994, stated:&quot;Cyrix is entitled to judgment in its favor on its affirmative defenses of patent exhaustion and implied license based on the use or resale of its claim 1 microprocessors purchased from TI and ST.&quot;

<text>At the [[1924 Winter Olympics]], in Chamonix, France, a [[military patrol]] competition was held. The Olympic results database lists the official medal winners for the event, as does the Official Report (1924), yet several sources have incorrectly counted this competition as a demonstration event only. The event was also demonstrated in 1928, 1936, and 1948, but those results are still considered unofficial. A full 36 years would pass before the modern version of the sport, biathlon, became an official Winter Olympic sport. The official website of the IOC now treats Men&#x27;s Military Patrol at the 1924 Games as a separate discipline, without mixing it with the sports of Skiing or Biathlon. However, the 1924 Official Report treats it as an event within the sport of skiing.

The competition was held on Tuesday, January 29, 1924. Each team had 4 people and the distance was 25 km. The targets were balloons at 150m. Six teams started the event, but only four finished with Italy and Poland withdrawing due to bad conditions.

<doc id="969897" wikidata="Q4719765" url="?curid=969897" title="Alexander Nowell">
<text>Alexander Nowell (13 February 1602), also known as Alexander Noel, was an Anglican priest and theologian. He served as Dean of St Paul&#x27;s during much of Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign, and is now remembered for his catechisms, written in Latin.

==Early life==
Alexander Nowell was the eldest son of John Nowell of Read Hall, Read, Lancashire, by his second wife Elizabeth Kay of Rochdale, and was the brother of Laurence Nowell, who became Dean of Lichfield. His sister Beatrice was the mother of John Hammond; Another brother, Robert Nowell, became Attorney of the Court of Wards.

Nowell was educated at Middleton, near Rochdale, Lancashire and at Brasenose College, Oxford where he is said to have shared rooms with John Foxe the martyrologist. He was elected fellow of Brasenose in 1526, spending some 13 years in Oxford.

==In London==
In 1543 Nowell was appointed master of Westminster School, and, in December 1551, prebendary of Westminster Abbey. During this period he became involved in a controversy with Thomas Dorman, over the views of the late John Redman, which ran on in different forms for many years.

Nowell was elected in September 1553 as Member of Parliament for West Looe in Cornwall in Queen Mary&#x27;s first parliament. In October of that year, however, a committee of the house reported that he could not sit in the House of Commons because as prebendary of Westminster he had a seat in Convocation. He was then also deprived of his prebend, in 1554.

==Marian exile==
Nowell was one of the Marian exiles, Protestants who left England during the Reign of Mary I and Philip II. He left England in 1555, aided by the merchant Francis Bowyer. He went first to Strassburg and then to Frankfurt, where he became involved in the doctrinal and liturgical dispute between the exiles. While trying to moderate the discussions, Nowell came to side with John Knox.

==Dean of St Paul&#x27;s==
Nowell returned to England when Elizabeth I came to the throne, becoming chaplain to Edmund Grindal in December 1560. He was given the archdeaconry of Middlesex at the start of 1561, a canonry at Canterbury, and in November 1561 became Dean of St Paul&#x27;s. In 1562 the Bishop of London collated him with the Parish of Great or Much Hadham in Hertfordshire, where the Bishops had a palace.

In the Convocation of 1563 Nowell played a prominent part. On its opening day, 12 January, he preached in Westminster Abbey the sermon for the opening of the concurrent Parliament. In it, he gave offence to the Queen, when he called on her to marry. It was said that she never spoke a friendly word to him again. On the following day, Matthew Parker nominated him as prolocutor of the Lower House of Convocation. Elected to the post, he was used to keeping the two Houses, the Upper consisting of bishops, in touch with each other.

Friction with the Queen is well attested. On one occasion she rebuked Nowell in the vestry for having given her a prayer book with pictures of saints and angels that smacked of the Church of Rome. On another, in March 1565, she interrupted his sermon, directed against a work &quot;A Treatyse of the Crosse &quot; (1564) of John Martiall, telling him to stick to his text and cease slighting the crucifix. In 1594 he was appointed Canon of the eleventh stall at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, a position he held until 1602.

==Death and legacy==
Nowell held the deanery of St Paul&#x27;s for 42 years, until his death on 13 February 1602; and was buried within his cathedral. With his brother Robert, a lawyer, he re-established the free school at Middleton; and made other benefactions for educational purposes at Brasenose College.

Sometime after his death, he was credited by Thomas Fuller (and his later revisers), with the accidental invention of bottled beer. &quot;Without offence it may be remembered, that leaving a bottle of ale, when fishing, in the grass, he found it some days after, no bottle, but a gun, such the sound at the opening thereof : and this is believed (casualty is mother of more inventions than industry) the original of bottled ale in England.&quot;

He was also a keen angler, and Izaak Walton says, &quot;this good man was observed to spend a tenth part of his time in angling; and also (for I have conversed with those which have conversed with him) to bestow a tenth part of his revenue, and usually all his fish, amongst the poor that inhabited near to those rivers in which it was caught; saying often, &#x27;that charity gave life to religion&#x27;&quot;.

He is a character in the drama &#x27;If You Know Not Me , You Know Nobody&#x27; by Thomas Heywood, where he plays the role of a conciliator in a land dispute between Sir Thomas Gresham and Sir Thomas Ramsey.

==Works==
Nowell is now remembered for his work on catechisms. His Latin &quot;Catechismus puerorum&quot;, in manuscript, gained the support of the Lower House in the Convocation of 1563. It was printed in 1570, as &quot;Catechismus, sive, Prima institutio disciplinaque pietatis Christianae&quot;, with Matthew Parker&#x27;s approval. It was officially required to be used in schools, in 1571, and Thomas Norton translated it into English, as &quot;A Catechism, or, First instruction of Christian religion&quot; (1570). Abridged versions appeared: the &quot;middle&quot; catechism (1572) and the &quot;shorter&quot; catechism (1573). A Welsh translation, &quot;Catecism eglwys loegr&quot; by Thomas Jones of Denbigh, appeared in 1809.

==Family==
Nowell was twice married, but left no children; his first wife was Jane Mery, widow of Thomas Bowyer, the uncle of Francis Bowyer, and his second Elizabeth Hast, twice widow. He was also the uncle of the theologian William Whitaker, who translated the &quot;middle&quot; catechism into Greek.

<doc id="969910" wikidata="Q5307140" url="?curid=969910" title="Drew Caldwell">
<text>Drew Caldwell (born April 10, 1960) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the constituency of Brandon East from 1999 until 2016, serving as a Cabinet Minister in the governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger. Caldwell is a member of the New Democratic Party.

==Early life and career==
Caldwell was born and raised in Brandon, Manitoba. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Brandon University (1982), a Bachelor of Education degree from Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston (1983), and undertook graduate studies in history at McGill University in Montreal. He returned to Brandon permanently on the passing of his father in 1989, working as a supply teacher and managing the Brandon Career Symposium. He was active with community organizations such as the Park Community Centre and was a founding director of the Brandon Folk Music and Art Festival and the Art Gallery of Southwestern Manitoba.

Caldwell was a member of the Brandon City Council from 1992 to 1999, representing the Rosser Ward (Ward Two). He was a founding director of the Brandon Regional Health Authority, and - on the provincial stage - an Executive Member of the Union of Manitoba Municipalities, the Manitoba Association of Urban Municipalities and the Association of Manitoba Municipalities between 1997 and 1999. He opposed residential property tax increases while on city council, and supported owners of single-family homes in calling for parts of the city to be re-zoned from high-density residential to low-density residential. In 1998, he chaired the Brandon Poverty Forum which led to the establishment of the Brandon Social Planning Council and a $50,000 civic reserve fund for social development.

Active in the Manitoba NDP since his teens, Caldwell was President of the party when the writ was dropped for the 1999 General Election.

==Member of the Legislative Assembly==
When longtime Brandon East MLA Len Evans announced his retirement in 1999, Caldwell defeated Ross Martin and Susan Ferron to win the riding&#x27;s NDP nomination. He was elected without difficulty in the general election that followed, as the NDP won a provincial majority government under Gary Doer.

===Minister of Education and Training===

Caldwell was respected for his political/administrative skills, and there was little surprise when he was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Education and Training on October 5, 1999. The position gave him oversight of the province&#x27;s public schools and post-secondary institutions. His position was renamed as Minister of Education, Training and Youth in 2001, and his responsibilities for post-secondary institutions were transferred to Diane McGifford, the Minister of Advanced Education and Training.

====Early initiatives====

Soon after his appointment, Caldwell implemented an NDP campaign pledge to replace standardized Grade Three language and mathematics exams with individual diagnostic tests administered by teachers. Many teachers complained about the extra workload, and opposition critic Joy Smith argued that the test system should be restored. Caldwell responded that individual assessments were better suited to students&#x27; needs.

Caldwell also removed the controversial Youth News Network from Manitoba schools. The network&#x27;s parent company, Athena Education Partners, had previously offered free technology to schools in return for requiring students to watch daily YNN broadcasts, which included commercials from private corporations. According to Todd Scarth of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, YNN televisions were equipped with two-way monitoring systems to ensure that students were watching and that the volume was not adjusted. Athena&#x27;s contracts also required schools to hire a half-day technician to maintain YNN equipment. Caldwell described YNN&#x27;s programming as &quot;clearly an unsatisfactory curriculum choice&quot; for children, and oversaw the program&#x27;s elimination once previously-signed contracts were concluded in August 2000. The network was also banned in other provinces, and went off the air in 2000.

====School funding====

When he assumed office, Caldwell indicated that school board funding increases would be pegged relative to provincial economic growth. In February 2000, he announced that his government would provide schools with a 2.8% funding increase over the previous academic year. The Winnipeg One division saw its funding increase by $4.1 million, primarily due to a large number of special needs students. Caldwell announced another 2.8% in 2001, and a 2.2% increase in 2002. The latter amount was smaller than in previous years, but higher than overall provincial growth.

Despite these increases, school trustees repeatedly warned the public that boards would be required to either raise taxes or cut back on services. Caldwell acknowledged that the funding increases did not address all divisional needs, and blamed low levels of funding during the previous decade of Progressive Conservative government. He also suggested that some trustees were overpaid, noting that St. Vital trustees had voted to give themselves stipends of $300 per day to attend amalgamation meetings.

====Amalgamations====

Shortly after assuming office, Caldwell told his department to review the Norrie Commission findings on school boards and prepare a report on amalgamations. He indicated that his intent was to save money on administration, and put more funds directly into the classrooms. Caldwell called for voluntary board mergers in 2000, saying that school divisions would need at least two thousand students to be viable and that more than half the provincial divisions were below that level.

The response from school boards was tepid, and Caldwell announced in late 2001 that he would reduce the number of provincial boards from 54 to 36. Three boards in Winnipeg were forced to merge. A bill enacting these changes was passed in July 2002, and the new school division boundaries were in place for the 2002 municipal elections. The most difficult change was in Transcona-Springfield, which was split and merged with two pre-existing districts.

During the amalgamation dispute, Caldwell introduced legislation requiring merged districts to submit their budgets to the minister for approval. He argued that this was necessary to prevent large property tax increases. He also agreed to pay $50 per student to divisions that he forced into amalgamation, to compensate for the difficulties of restructuring.

====Adult education====

Caldwell was forced to cut per-student funding for adult education in 2000, after an unexpected surge in enrollment from the previous year put his department $10 million over budget. He later argued that some adult education programs had been inadequately managed during the previous administration, and expressed concern about the quality of education that adult students were receiving. His ministry discovered questionable recruitment practices in the Morris-Macdonald School Division, where cash bonuses had been paid to administrators who brought in thousands of adult students from elsewhere in the province. Caldwell ordered his department to investigate the matter, which he described as &quot;clearly inappropriate&quot;.

An October 2001 report from provincial auditor Jon Singleton found that the Morris-Macdonald board had offered courses of dubious quality, and had overbilled the province by as much as four million dollars by claiming students who were not actually enrolled. Caldwell dissolved the board the following month, and authorized the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to launch a criminal investigation. The RCMP later found that there was insufficient evidence to warrant criminal charges. Caldwell said of the matter, &quot;The absolute abrogation of responsibility that took place among these officials is appalling. There may well have to be some systemic change with respect to school board financial responsibility.&quot; He introduced new legislation in May 2002.

A government-appointed overseer increased Morris-Macdonald school taxes by 28% in 2002, largely to recover funds that were lost by virtue of the previous controversy. Local residents responded by launching a legal challenge against the overseer and the government. Caldwell indicated that he was willing to cushion the tax burden by allowing new trustees a longer period of time to pay off the debt.

Jon Singleton later discovered that a second school board, the Agassiz Division, had received funding for non-existent adult students in 2001 with the Department of Education&#x27;s knowledge and approval. The Department had provided an additional $450,000 to the cash-strapped board as general revenue, and flowed it through the adult education program for administrative purposes. Caldwell acknowledged that his department had made a &quot;foolish mistake&quot; in allowing the transfer, but insisted that it was done to protect students from the consequences of a drastic budget cut. He added that the Agassiz and Morris-Macdonald situations were completely different, and rejected calls from the opposition for his resignation. The Deputy Attorney General investigated the matter and concluded that the transaction was inappropriate, but not fraudulent.

====Labour relations====

Following his appointment to cabinet, Caldwell indicated that he would reverse the previous government&#x27;s changes to the Public Schools Act relating to arbitration for teachers&#x27; salaries. The system in place when he assumed office stipulated that contract disputes must be settled according to the division&#x27;s ability to pay. Caldwell initially considered reforming the system by putting teachers&#x27; contracts under the Labour Relations Act, so as to allow a greater range of issues to be considered. He refused to introduce the option of strikes and lockouts, which neither side had requested. The Manitoba Teachers&#x27; Society generally supported the proposed changes, while the Manitoba Association of School Trustees opposed them.

Caldwell&#x27;s June 2000 legislation expanded the range of arbitrable issues, but did not put teacher contracts under the Labour Relations Act. The reforms did not initially allow teachers to take class size and class composition to arbitration, although the government later exercised a clause in the bill to permit this right.

====Property taxes====

When campaigning for election in 1999, Gary Doer pledged that his party would move to phase out the Education Support Levy on property taxes by its third year in office, unless such a move would jeopardize health or education services. An April 2001 report by the Association of Manitoba Municipalities subsequently proposed a significant education tax shift from property taxes to general revenue. Caldwell announced later in the year that his government would begin phasing out the levy for homeowners, and would attempt to remove it entirely in five years.

Caldwell also introduced a revised funding formula for Manitoba schools in early 2002, simplifying some aspects of a model that was often criticized for its byzantine complexity. Some argued that the changes did not go far enough.

====School curriculum====

In 2001, Caldwell introduced a program to allow greater freedom for high-school students and teachers in designing their curriculum. Under his proposals, students would be allowed to earn optional credits through non-traditional means, such as taking part in science projects or performing community service. Some argued that these changes would devalue the quality of Manitoba education, but Caldwell insisted that the new credit courses would be thoroughly vetted and would incorporate traditional subjects. The proposal was revised in 2002; credits for volunteer work were allowed, but extracurricular activity credits were dropped after opposition from educators.

====Universities====

Caldwell fulfilled an NDP pledge for a tuition freeze and a 10% student tuition rebate shortly after assuming office. Both policies won support from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

The Doer government&#x27;s first budget, in May 2000, included $60 million of new money for Manitoba&#x27;s community college system, and a 3.8% increase for university funding. Although senior educators acknowledged that Caldwell&#x27;s spending increases were a step in the right direction, many described the funds as insufficient. The University of Manitoba announced that it would need to introduce significant cuts in the wake of the budget, although Caldwell argued that university management practices were responsible for the institution&#x27;s shortfalls. Brandon University officials described the budget as their &quot;most optimistic&quot; in years.

In November 2000, the Doer government introduced $50 million over five years to repair the University of Manitoba&#x27;s crumbling infrastructure.

Caldwell ceded cabinet responsibility for universities to Diane McGifford in 2001. The &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; newspaper suggested that he had been &quot;carrying too much responsibility&quot; and &quot;accomplishing too little&quot; in his original ministerial duties, and noted that he was more familiar with the public education file.

====Other====

In 2001, Caldwell announced that Manitoba would open high schools in Beijing, Shanghai and Bangkok in an effort to attract overseas students to Manitoba&#x27;s post-secondary education system.

In the same year, members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals announced that they would distribute trading cards to children outside Manitoba schools as part of a national anti-milk campaign. The cards showed the unhealthy side effects which PETA members suggested were associated with milk, including an increased risk of cancer and heart disease. Caldwell refused to allow PETA members on school property, and announced that he would take &quot;appropriate legal steps&quot; if they &quot;entice[d] children into approaching [them] for materials&quot;.

Caldwell indicated in late April 2002 that his government would focus infrastructural funds on repairing existing schools, rather than constructing new ones.

====Other responsibilities====

Caldwell was appointed to a super-committee of cabinet, called the Community Economic Development Committee, in late March 2000. In August of the same year, he was appointed to the Manitoba Round Table for Sustainable Development by Conservation Minister Oscar Lathlin.

Diane McGifford took Caldwell&#x27;s seat on the Community Economic Development Committee in March 2001, as the position required the presence of a minister overseeing universities and community colleges.

===Minister of Family Services and Housing===
Following a cabinet shuffle on September 25, 2002, Caldwell was named Minister of Family Services and Housing with responsibility for Persons with Disabilities. The Family Services Ministry was being restructured at the time of Caldwell&#x27;s appointment, and he was given responsibility for overseeing the transformation.

====Family Services====

In November 2002, Caldwell announced that his government would establish a residential treatment centre to provide care and counselling to sexually-exploited children. He also announced a review of Winnipeg Child and Family Services&#x27;s temporary shelters after a series of complaints, and worked to ensure that play therapy services for children would be retained.

In February 2003, Caldwell received a report into the circumstances of a child who had been shaken to death seven years earlier while under the supervision of Winnipeg Child and Family Services. He responded by announcing an overhaul of the child welfare system, and indicated that Manitoba would set workload standards for social workers and supervisors.

Caldwell also announced his support for a national day-care program negotiated between the provinces and federal government in early 2003, and pledged that his government would create 788 new day-care spaces across the province in the following year.

In September 2003, Caldwell and Manitoba Métis Federation leader David Chartrand signed a mandate to create the Métis Child, Family and Community Services Agency, and to give the agency control over child welfare services for Métis residents. This step followed a recommendation by the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry ten years earlier, that First Nations in Canada be given authority for raising their children in the child welfare system.

====Housing====

Caldwell announced a $3.3 million housing announcement for Winnipeg in October 2002, in conjunction with Mayor Glen Murray and Member of Parliament Anita Neville. Soon after, he helped introduce a solar panel heating project to reduce downtown Winnipeg&#x27;s fuel consumption.

Caldwell acknowledged that the housing situation in Manitoba was difficult, and expressed hope that his government would be able to create up to 2,500 units of affordable housing in five years. In April 2003, he recommended tax credits for the construction of rental housing. He later helped launch an affordable-housing project in north-end Winnipeg with members of the municipal and federal governments.

===Government backbencher===
Caldwell was re-elected in the 2003 provincial election, winning an easy victory over his Progressive Conservative opponent. He was originally retained as Family Services and Housing Minister, but left cabinet on November 4, 2003. He had been suffering from respiratory difficulties for some time, and Doer indicated he requested to be removed due to health concerns. Others have argued Doer was dissatisfied with Caldwell and have suggested that the latter&#x27;s health concerns, while legitimate, provided cover for a dismissal.

Caldwell served as a government backbencher after leaving cabinet. He became a staunch advocate for the relocation of Assiniboine Community College to the former BMHC site on Brandon&#x27;s north hill, an initiative commenced during his tenure as Minister of Education. Caldwell also assumed leadership roles in local advocacy for development of the Western Manitoba Cancer Treatment Centre, provincial investment in flood protection for the City of Brandon, Brandon University, the Keystone Centre, the Provincial Exhibition of Manitoba and the hosting of the Memorial Cup. He also criticized some of his government&#x27;s decisions, challenging Health Minister Theresa Oswald over details of the decision to spray malathion to control mosquito populations. He was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election, as the Doer government was returned with a third consecutive majority. With the NDP loss of the Brandon West constituency, Caldwell was left as the only New Democratic government MLA in Western Manitoba. There was some speculation that Caldwell would be re-appointed to cabinet in the next shuffle, but this did not occur. Instead, in February 2008, he was appointed as Legislative Assistant to the Premier with special responsibility for western Manitoba. Caldwell was re-elected in the 2011 provincial election with an increased plurality, and remained the sole New Democratic government MLA in Western Manitoba.

===Minister for Municipal Government===

Caldwell returned to cabinet as Minister for Municipal Government in November 2014. His responsibilities included administration of the Building Manitoba/Building Canada Fund, the development of alternative energy policy, and municipal government relations with specific responsibility for the City of Winnipeg. Notable initiatives undertaken during this time included the Waverly Underpass. Caldwell also served on Treasury Board in his capacity as Minister.

===Federal politics===
Caldwell supported Jack Layton for the federal New Democratic Party leadership in 2002-03. He supported Tom Mulcair in the 2012 leadership race to succeed Mr. Layton.

<doc id="969915" wikidata="Q488609" url="?curid=969915" title="Cyrix Cx486DLC">
<text>The Cyrix Cx486DLC is an x86 desktop microprocessor developed by Cyrix. It was Cyrix&#x27;s second CPU offering, released years after selling math coprocessors that competed with Intel&#x27;s units and offered better performance at a comparable or lower price. It was released in June of 1992, with a price of $119 for computer manufacturers.

== Specifications ==
The 486DLC is a 486 desktop CPU from Cyrix, intended to compete with the Intel 486SX and DX. Texas Instruments, who manufactured the 486DLC for Cyrix, later released its own version of the chip, the TI486SXL, with 8 KB internal cache vs 1 KB of the original Cyrix design. The similarly named IBM 486DLC, 486DLC2, 486DLC3 (aka Blue Lightning) are often confused with the Cyrix chips, but are not related and are instead based on Intel&#x27;s i486 design.

Like the later and more famous Cyrix Cx5x86, it is a hybrid CPU, incorporating features of a new CPU (the Intel 80486) while plugging into its predecessor&#x27;s (386DX) PGA132 socket. It runs at speeds of 25, 33, and 40 MHz.

The 486DLC can be described as a 386DX with the 486 instruction set and 1 KB of on-board L1 cache added. Because it uses the 386DX bus (unlike its 16-bit cousin, the 486SLC), it is a fully 32-bit chip. Like the 386 and 486SX, it has no on-board math coprocessor, but unlike the 486SX, it can make use of an Intel 387DX or compatible numeric x87 coprocessor. Due to the smaller L1 cache, the 486DLC can not compete on a clock-for-clock basis with the 486SX, but a 33 MHz 486DLC can keep pace with a 25 MHz 486SX, cost less, and offers the ability to upgrade further with the addition of a math coprocessor.

While advertisements from smaller manufacturers touted the superiority of their 486DLC over name-brand computers sporting a 486SX, the only advantage the 486DLC offers over the 486SX is the ability to add a math coprocessor. The Intel 487 &quot;math coprocessor&quot; for 486SX users is a CPU replacement—a 486DX with a different pinout—and originally cost several hundred dollars more than a 387.

As prices on Intel&#x27;s 486 line fell, Cyrix found it more and more difficult for its 486SLC and DLC CPUs to compete and released a fully pin-compatible version of the 486SX and DX in 1993.

The 486DLC did not see widespread use among large OEMs, but it was widely known among the hardware enthusiast community that an AMD 386DX-40 or Cyrix 486DLC-33 could keep up with a 486SX-25 at a lower cost, so it gained a small following among budget-minded enthusiasts. It was also sometimes used as a replacement for a 386 CPU to give a small speed boost. However, the 486DLC was not designed to be a direct CPU replacement and could lead to stability problems in older boards it was not intended for. &quot;Cyrix-aware&quot; motherboards usually had a few extra cache control lines to maintain cache coherency, as well as CPU register control in the BIOS to enable/disable the on-board cache. Cyrix later released a clock-doubled &quot;direct replacement&quot; upgrade package for 386DX systems called the Cx486DRu2. This kit included a standard 486DLC with an extra &quot;dingus&quot; that sits between the CPU and socket and provides the control lines for cache coherency. These kits were quickly superseded by the Cx486DRx2 CPU, which integrates the cache coherency circuitry into the CPU itself. The Cx486DRx2 appeared on the market in 1994, by which time the 486 was already being displaced by the Pentium. Sales were poor due to the high price and the underwhelming performance compared to a true Intel 486DX2. It was often cheaper to purchase a new 486 motherboard than to invest in an upgrade CPU.

<doc id="969921" wikidata="Q672730" url="?curid=969921" title="Jasper Heywood">
<text>Jasper Heywood (1535 – 9 January 1598) was an English Jesuit priest. He is known as the English translator of three Latin plays of Seneca, the &quot;Troas&quot; (1559), the &quot;Thyestes&quot; (1560) and &quot;Hercules Furens&quot; (1561).

==Life==
He was son of John Heywood, and became a fellow of Merton College, Oxford, but was compelled to resign in 1558. In the same year he was elected a fellow of All Souls College, but, refusing to conform to the changes in religion at the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth I, he gave up his fellowship and went to Rome, where he was received into the Society of Jesus.

For seventeen years he was professor of moral theology and controversy in the Jesuit College at Dillingen, in present-day Bavaria. In 1581 he was sent to England as superior of the Jesuit mission, but his leniency in that position led to his recall.

On his way back to the Continent, a violent storm drove him back to the English coast. He was arrested on the charge of being a priest, but, although efforts were made to induce him to abjure his opinions, he remained firm. He was condemned to perpetual exile on pain of death, and died at Naples on 9 January 1598. His nephew was the poet and preacher John Donne.

==Works==
Heywood&#x27;s verse translations of Seneca were supplemented by other plays contributed by Alexander Neville, Thomas Nuce, John Studley and Thomas Newton. Newton collected these translations in one volume, &quot;Seneca, his tenne tragedies translated into Englysh&quot; (1581). The importance of this work in the development of English drama can hardly be overestimated.

He also wrote four poems published in 1576 in the Elizabethan collection known as &quot;The Paradise of Dainty Devices&quot;.

<text>is an adventure game developed by Softedge and published by Yano Electric. It was released for Japan in 1993, and then in North America, for the Macintosh in 1994 and then for the PC in 1995.

It is a game where the player, from a first-person perspective, explores ancient Kyoto city during 10th-11th century Japan. The game lacks a clear goal, but is instead nonlinear and emphasizes open exploration, giving players the freedom to explore the city and discover many pathways, buildings, situations, stories and secrets. The game deals with historical, horror, religious and educational themes, and features karma and reincarnation gameplay mechanics. Released on CD-ROM, the dialogues in the game are fully voiced in Japanese, with English subtitles in the localized North American version. The game was not a commercial success, but was critically acclaimed and attracted a cult following.

==Gameplay==
The game is controlled by clicking hotspots and text options when appropriate. The user also types in sentences, upon occasion. At the start, the player character is created by the player using a character creation system, with the player able to customize what the player character looks like. As the game begins, the player character is born and must take the clothes off a nearby corpse. The game does not have a clear goal, but is instead nonlinear and emphasizes open exploration, giving the player the freedom to explore Kyoto, with many pathways, buildings, situations, stories and secrets to discover throughout the city, including both realistic and supernatural elements. The progress through the city effects a journey through history, with a street map and online guide provided to ancient (and modern) Kyoto at various points through the game. It provides enough freedom to allow for the player to experiment with the game, such as using it as a resource for their own role-playing game campaign, for example.

The game uses karma and reincarnation gameplay mechanics, based on Buddhist concepts. During the game, the player will often die after being attacked by evil demons or robbers, and will then go to one of the realms of reincarnation, depending upon the player&#x27;s conduct in that life. In these Buddhist hells, the player character is tortured in various ways. Once the player escapes hell, they are reborn, as a new character with a new appearance. If the player&#x27;s with too much negative karma, they may be reincarnated as a dog rather than a human. After being reborn, the player must take the clothes from his or her last body to continue. As the player progresses through the city, new abilities and items are revealed that protect the player from death.

==Plot==
The game is set in the medieval city of Kyoto around the year 1000, during the Heian period of Japanese history. The game lacks an overall plot, but it instead presents fragmented narratives in a non-linear manner, as the player character encounters various non-player characters while wandering the city. These narratives are cross-referenced to an encyclopedia, providing background information as the narratives progress and as the player comes across various characters and locations, with various stories and related information appearing at distinct locations.

Many of the characters in the game are based on real-life characters from the city and their appearances in the game are often loosely based on tales from the &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot;. The game deals with religion and philosophy, particularly Buddhism and Buddhist philosophy, as well as myth and legend.

==Development==

The game was authored using Macromedia Director.

==Reception==
Upon release in North America, the game received wide critical acclaim. However, it was not a commercial success in North America, attracting only a devoted cult following, partly because of its limited production run making it difficult to find and partly because of its slow-paced gameplay.

===Critical reception===
In September 1994, a review by film critic Roger Ebert was published in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, where he stated the &quot;richness is almost overwhelming&quot;, noting &quot;the resources of this game are limitless&quot;, that &quot;no two players would have the same experience&quot; and that he had barely &quot;begun to scratch the surface&quot; of the city despite exploring for two weeks. He stated it was &quot;the most beguiling computer game I have encountered, a seamless blend of information, adventure, humor, and imagination&quot; with &quot;the gruesome side-by-side with the divine.&quot; He praised the &quot;hauntingly effective&quot; widescreen graphics, the &quot;vivid facial characteristics&quot; of the characters (describing them as &quot;a cross&quot; between &quot;medieval Japanese art&quot; and &quot;modern Japanimation&quot;), and the voices &quot;filled with personality&quot;. He concluded it to be &quot;a wonderful game&quot; where there &quot;is the sense, illusory but seductive, that one could wander this world indefinitely.&quot; Later in 2010, he mentioned it in a column on whether video games can be art. After previously arguing that video games are categorically not art, he stated, &quot;In my actual experience, I have played &quot;Cosmology of Kyoto&quot;, which I enormously enjoyed, and &quot;Myst&quot;, for which I lacked the patience.&quot; &quot;Cosmology of Kyoto&quot; is the only video game that Ebert is known to have reviewed and enjoyed. In October 1994, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published a review by David Coller, who described it as an &quot;adventure-cultural-historical game&quot; that is &quot;graphically violent at times,&quot; but a &quot;cerebral game&quot; that &quot;in no way resembles &quot;Doom&quot; or &quot;Rebel Assault&quot;&quot;, stating &quot;you have to throw away your Western ideas about game play&quot;. He stated he could not find an ending &quot;even after many hours of play&quot; but praised the graphics and soundscape as &quot;beautiful&quot; and concluded it to be &quot;truly unsettling.&quot; Stone Bridge Press founder Peter Goodman also praised the game, stating he had &quot;never gotten to the end of it&quot; but &quot;it sure is beautiful&quot;, which Coller agreed with.

In issue 218 (June 1995) of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, it was reviewed by game designer David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook in the &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column. He described it as &quot;a unique gaming experience&quot; that is part &quot;game, part history lesson, and part software toy,&quot; recommending it to players &quot;looking for an adventure game unlike any they&#x27;ve ever seen&quot; as &quot;&quot;Cosmology of Kyoto&quot; is unlike anything else out there&quot;, noting how it departed from other adventure games, such as its lack of a clear goal other than being killed &quot;over and over and over again&quot; and how &quot;you&#x27;re just an ordinary person&quot; with no special abilities. He described it as &quot;frustrating, flawed, and fascinating&quot;, criticizing the slow pace, &quot;limited&quot; interaction, and slow CD-ROM loading times, yet found it &quot;appealing&quot;, stating &quot;the wonder of the setting and its approach outweighs these irritations&quot; as there &quot;are too many fascinating things to discover, from haunted houses to backgammon-playing demons&quot; and the reincarnation mechanic gives the game &quot;a certain freedom&quot;, enough that the player &quot;could even use it as a resource for&quot; their &quot;own role-playing game&quot; campaign. According to Cook, &quot;Ultimately, &quot;Cosmology of Kyoto&quot; is best viewed as less a game and more a software toy, one of those things you plug in and fiddle with. Once you forget about winning and indulge your curiosity, the CD-ROM&#x27;s strength truly shines.&quot; At the AUUG Conference in September 1995, &quot;Cosmology of Kyoto&quot; was described as &quot;extremely interesting and groundbreaking&quot;, for &quot;many aspects&quot; such as the way it presents and cross-references its fragmented narratives in a non-linear way, the Buddhist themes, the way it draws from &quot;the art and literature of Kyoto at about 1000 AD, the simple elegance of the screen design, and the beauty of the water-colour images used throughout.&quot;

===Retrospective reception===
Retrospectively, the game has also been critically well received. In 2008, video game journalist Jenn Frank retroactively compared it to contemporary survival horror games. She noted &quot;Cosmology of Kyoto&quot; lacks a &quot;real plot or goal&quot; but considered an &quot;unfairness&quot; to be characteristic of horror with &quot;encounters with ghosts and demons&quot; that are &quot;often random, sudden, inescapable&quot;. She concluded it to be an &quot;extremely eerie&quot; and &quot;Memorably frightening game.&quot; In 2011, Ryan McSwain of Hardcore Gaming 101 states that it &quot;attempts to be many things&quot;, including &quot;a game, an educational tool, and a work of art&quot;, concluding that &quot;it manages to be all of these and more.&quot; After Ebert mentioned the game on his blog in 2010, Chris Person reviewed the game on Kotaku in 2012, where he described it as an &quot;edu-horror&quot; and &quot;one of the most disturbing&quot; games he had ever played, depicting themes such as poverty, sickness, suffering, and cruelty (such as a scene where a child is beheaded by a nobleman, and scenes depicting torture in hell), and praises the game for the way it expresses its Buddhist themes. Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro mentioned &quot;Cosmology of Kyoto&quot; as one of his favorite games, along with &quot;Gadget: Invention, Travel, &amp; Adventure&quot;, &quot;Asteroids&quot; and &quot;Galaga&quot;.

<text>The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra (founded in 1972) is a classical music chamber orchestra based in New York City. They have won several Grammy Awards, and are known for their collaborative leadership style in which the musicians, not a conductor, interpret the score.

== History ==
The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra was founded in 1972 by Julian Fifer and a group of young musicians. With 71 albums, including the Grammy Award-winning &quot;Shadow Dances: Stravinsky Miniatures&quot;, and 42 commissioned and premiered original works, Orpheus rotates musical leadership roles for each work.

Performing without a conductor, Orpheus presents an annual series at Carnegie Hall and tours extensively to major national and international venues.

Collaborators of Orpheus include Fazıl Say, Isaac Stern, Gidon Kremer, Itzhak Perlman, Gil Shaham, Yo-Yo Ma, Mischa Maisky, Emanuel Ax, Richard Goode, Alicia de Larrocha, Radu Lupu, Martha Argerich, Alfred Brendel, Horacio Gutierrez, Murray Perahia, Peter Serkin, Mitsuko Uchida, Tatiana Troyanos, Martin Fröst, Anne Akiko Meyers, Maureen Forrester, Frederica von Stade, Peter Schreier, Anne Sofie von Otter, Nobuyuki Tsujii, Dawn Upshaw, and Renée Fleming. Orpheus has premiered works by Elliott Carter, Jacob Druckman, Mario Davidovsky, Michael Gandolfi, William Bolcom, Osvaldo Golijov, Fred Lerdahl, Gunther Schuller, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, Susan Botti, David Rakowski, Bruce Adolphe, Peter Lieberson, Elizabeth Brown, Wayne Shorter, Brad Mehldau, and Shuying Li.

Individual members of Orpheus have received recognition for solo, chamber music, and orchestral performances. Of the 30 players who comprise the basic membership of Orpheus, many also hold teaching positions at conservatories and universities in the New York and New England areas, including Juilliard, Manhattan School of Music, New England Conservatory, Columbia, Yale, Mannes College of Music, Montclair State University, Stony Brook University and the Hartt School. Orpheus musicians also hold posts with other orchestras such as the New York Philharmonic, American Composer&#x27;s Orchestra, Met Opera Orchestra, New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, and New York City Ballet Orchestra. Orpheus members serve on the administrative staff as well as on the Board of Directors.

== Touring ==
Orpheus has embarked on many extensive tours of the United States, Europe, South America, and Asia, including Japan.

== Orpheus as a democratic workplace ==
In March 2007, Orpheus became one of the first winners of the Worldwide Award for the Most Democratic Workplaces sponsored by WorldBlu, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based organization specializing in organizational democracy.

==Notable works==

=== Recordings ===
The Orpheus has recorded over 70 albums. Their extensive catalog for Deutsche Grammophon includes Baroque masterworks of Handel, Corelli and Vivaldi, Haydn symphonies, Mozart symphonies and serenades, the complete Mozart wind concerti with Orpheus members as soloists, Romantic works by Dvořák, Grieg and Tchaikovsky and a number of twentieth-century classics by Bartók, Prokofiev, Fauré, Ravel, Schoenberg, and others. Recent releases include a recording of English and American folk songs with countertenor Andreas Scholl (Decca); &quot;Creation&quot;, a collection of the Impressionist music from 1920s Paris with saxophonist Branford Marsalis (Sony Classical); a series of recordings of Mozart&#x27;s greatest piano concerti with Richard Goode (Nonesuch); and a vigorous reading of &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; with Sarah Chang (EMI Classics). A collection of Mozart piano concerti with Jonathan Biss was released in 2008, also on EMI Classics, and in 2014 Orpheus released its first self-produced album containing Beethoven Symphonies Nos. 5 &amp; 7 recorded live at Carnegie Hall.

===Commissioning===
Within the past decade, Orpheus presented The New Brandenburgs program, engaging six composers to create six new works for the orchestra. Each composer was joined with one of Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos and was asked to compose a new piece inspired by the original. Following the completion of The New Brandenburgs, Orpheus launched its Project 440 initiative that commissioned four emerging composers chosen by a diverse group of advisors through a nationwide selection process. The four composers included Cynthia Wong, Clint Needham, Andrew Norman, and Alex Mincek.

<doc id="969930" wikidata="Q660944" url="?curid=969930" title="Boeing-Stearman Model 75">
<text>The Stearman (Boeing) Model 75 is an American biplane formerly used as a military trainer aircraft, of which at least 10,626 were built in the United States during the 1930s and 1940s. Stearman Aircraft became a subsidiary of Boeing in 1934. Widely known as the Stearman, Boeing Stearman, or Kaydet, it served as a primary trainer for the United States Army Air Forces, the United States Navy (as the NS and N2S), and with the Royal Canadian Air Force as the Kaydet throughout World War II. After the conflict was over, thousands of surplus aircraft were sold on the civilian market. In the immediate postwar years, they became popular as crop dusters and sports planes, and for aerobatic and wing walking use in air shows.

==Design and development==



In late 1933, Stearman engineers Mac Short, Harold W. Zipp, and J. Jack Clark took a 1931 Lloyd Stearman design, and added cantilever landing gear and adjustable elevator trim tabs, to produce the Model 70. Able to withstand +12g and -9g, the aircraft was powered by a 210-hp Lycoming R-680, first flew on 1 January 1934, before flight tests were conducted at Wright Field, Naval Air Station Anacostia, and Pensacola. The Navy then requested a similar model built to Navy specifications, including a 200-hp Wright J-5 engine. The resultant Model 73, was designated NS-1 by the Navy, of which 41 were ordered, including enough spares to build another 20 aircraft.

In the summer of 1934, Stearman engineers refined the Model 73 into the Model X75. The Army Air Corps evaluated the plane that autumn, powered by a 225-hp Wright R-760 or a 225-hp Lycoming R-680. In July 1935, the Army Air Corps ordered 26 with the Lycoming engine, designated the PT-13A, while the navy ordered an additional 20. In August 1936, the Army ordered an additional 50 PT-13As, followed by another 30 in October, and another 28 in December. Simultaneously, the company received orders for its primary trainer from the Argentinian navy, the Philippine Army Air Corps, and the Brazilian Air Force. In January 1937, the army ordered another 26 PT-13As.

On 6 June 1941, the U.S. government issued Approved Type Certificate No. 743 for the civilian version of the Model 75. Designated the Model A75L3 (PT-13) and Model A75N1 (PT-17), about 60 were sold to civilian flights schools such as Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology, and for export.

On 15 March 1941, the company delivered the 1000th trainer to the Army, and the 1001st trainer to the Navy. Then on 27 August 1941, the company delivered the 2000th trainer to the Army. On 27 July 1944, the company delivered its 10,000th primary trainer.

The Kaydet was a conventional biplane of rugged construction, with a large, fixed tailwheel undercarriage, and accommodation for the student and instructor in open cockpits in tandem. The radial engine was usually not cowled, although some Stearman operators choose to cowl the engine, most notably the Red Baron Stearman Squadron.

==Operational history==
===Post-war usage===
After World War II, thousands of surplus PT-17s were auctioned off to civilians and former military pilots. Many were modified for crop-dusting use, with a hopper for pesticide or fertilizer fitted in place of the front cockpit. Additional equipment included pumps, spray bars, and nozzles mounted below the lower wings. A popular approved modification to increase the maximum takeoff weight and climb performance involved fitting a larger Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior engine and a constant-speed propeller.

==Variants==
&quot;Data from:&quot; United States Navy aircraft since 1911, Boeing aircraft since 1916 8,584 Model 70s, 75s and 76s were built, with additional &quot;spares&quot; bringing the number up to the sometimes quoted 10,346.

===USAAC/USAAF designations===

<text>Stearman Aircraft Corporation was an aircraft manufacturer in Wichita, Kansas. Although the company designed a range of other aircraft, it is most known for producing the Model 75, which is commonly known simply as the &quot;Stearman&quot; or &quot;Boeing Stearman&quot;.

==History==
On 10 December 1926, Lloyd Stearman as president, Fred Hoyt as vice president, and George Lyle as secretary, chartered Stearman Aircraft, Inc. Aircraft fabrication took place in Venice, California, with final assembly and test flights taking place at Clover Field. 

Four C1 and C2 biplanes were built before production moved back to Wichita in 1927. On 1 October the company was renamed the Stearman Aircraft Company, after additional capital was raised by Walter P. Innes, Jr., and his business associates. The first aircraft constructed in the Wichita factory was a C2B, while adjacent to the factory was a 1390 foot runway. The C2M with mail pit, and a new model, the Stearman C3 followed. On 11 December, Stearman was named president, Mac Short vice president, Walter P. Innes, Jr., secretary, and Harry A. Dillon treasurer. On 6 September 1927, the company charter was filed with the State of Kansas, and primary shareholders included Stearman, Short, Dillon, and Innes, plus H.M. Steinbuschel and J.O. Davidson, with Davidson also serving on the board of directors. 

In June 1928, the C2B airframe designation was changed to C3B, with a larger baggage compartment and oil tank. The factory was producing 2.5 aircraft a week to meet demand. In January 1929, the first M-2 was delivered to Varney Air Lines.

In 1927, Stearman built one aircraft in Wichita, followed by 130 in 1928. At peak production in 1929, the company employed 250 people, and used a network of 10 distributors throughout the country. In late 1930, the company relocated to new facilities at the Wichita Municipal Airport. 

In July 1929, Lloyd Stearman, Walter Innes, Jr., and Harry Dillon met with the officials of United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, and agreed on a stock exchange, 375 shares of Stearman stock for 100 shares of United Aircraft and Transport. Stearman&#x27;s board of directors was reorganized with Frederick Rentschler as chairman, with William Boeing, Lloyd Stearman, Mac Short, Walter Innes, Jr., Julies Schaefer, and Harry Dillon as members. 

In December 1930, Innes took over the presidency of the company, and Lloyd Stearman was asked by Renstchler to focus on research, &quot;...investigating and developing new models and new ideas on management, production, sales, and service, as well as aircraft design.&quot; However, in July 1931, Stearman resigned.

The Northrop Aircraft Corporation was merged into Stearman in July 1931, and Northrop&#x27;s operations were moved from Burbank to Wichita.

By 1932, during the Great Depression, the number of employees at Stearman had dropped to 25. The situation improved when Boeing contracted Stearman to build several parts associated with the Boeing 247. In 1933, the company was also able to build the Model 80 and 81.

In September 1933, Julius Schaefer was elected president, Mac Short vice president and chief engineer, Clif Barron secretary, and D.L. Brown chairman of the board. The company also developed new training biplanes, the Model 70 and Model 73. The U.S. navy ordered 41 of the Model 73, and designated it the NS-1.

As a consequence of the Air Mail Act of 1934, United Aircraft and Transport Corporation was reorganized into the United Airlines Transport Corporation, United Aircraft, and Boeing Aircraft Company. Stearman became a division of Boeing. In November, Schaefer was elected president, Mac Short vice president, Clif Barron secretary and treasurer. By the summer of 1935, Stearman employed 200. 

In July 1935, Stearman demonstrated the Model X75, a refined Model 73, and subsequently received an order for 26 aircraft from the Army Air Corps, designated the PT-13A, and 20 for the Navy. In August 1936, the Army ordered another 50 PT-13As, followed by an additional 30 in October, and 28 in December. The company now employed 400. By the summer of 1937, the company employed about 500, and produced 15 aircraft a month.

In 1937, the company developed the Model X85 for the navy. First flown in May 1938, the navy took delivery as the XOSS-1 in June 1939. 

In the autumn of 1939, the company employed 600, which increased to 1000 after the Army Air Corps ordered an additional 235 PT-13Bs in September. By September 1940, the workforce totaled 1400 after receiving additional orders from the Army and Navy for hundreds more trainers. The company was then producing five aircraft per day. By October 1940, the workforce totaled 1522, and factory space had increased from 157,000 square feet in 1939 to 205,600 square feet. 

In December 1940, the company demonstrated the Model X90, its version of a monoplane trainer, to the Army and Navy. However, only one version, the XBT-17, was delivered to the Army in 1942.

In February 1941, the company employed 2800 workers, and manufacturing facilities had increased to 300,000 square feet by that summer. By June 1941, the number of workers exceeded 5000. On 15 March 1941, the company delivered the 1000th trainer to the Army, and the 1001st trainer to the Navy. On 27 August 1941, the company delivered the 2000th trainer to the Army.

Stearman operated as a Boeing division until September 1941, when it was redesignated the Wichita Division, Boeing Aircraft Company.

In April 1943, the company produced its 7000th trainer, and in July 1944, its 10,000th. A total of 10,346 primary trainers were built by the company for the U.S. military.

According to Edward H. Phillips, &quot;From 1927 to 1962 the Stearman Aircraft Company, and later the Stearman Division and the Wichita Division, built more than 14,500 aircraft. According to Boeing records, these included 247 original Stearman biplanes, 10,346 primary trainers (including equivalent spares), assemblies for 750 Waco CG-4 gliders, 1,769 B-29 heavy bombers (including spares), 12 single-engine, piston-powered L-15 liaison aircraft, 1,390 B-47 medium bombers, and 467 B-52 Stratofortress bombers.&quot; 

In 2005, Boeing sold the civil portion of the former Stearman operations to Onex, forming Spirit AeroSystems, although it retained the military operations.

<text>The common toad, European toad, or in Anglophone parts of Europe, simply the toad (Bufo bufo, from Latin &quot;bufo&quot; &quot;toad&quot;), is a toad found throughout most of Europe (with the exception of Ireland, Iceland, parts of Scandinavia, and some Mediterranean islands), in the western part of North Asia, and in a small portion of Northwest Africa. It is one of a group of closely related animals that are descended from a common ancestral line of toads and which form a species complex. The toad is an inconspicuous animal as it usually lies hidden during the day. It becomes active at dusk and spends the night hunting for the invertebrates on which it feeds. It moves with a slow, ungainly walk or short jumps, and has greyish-brown skin covered with wart-like lumps.

Although toads are usually solitary animals, in the breeding season, large numbers of toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings in the water and later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial for the rest of their lives.

The common toad seems to be in decline in part of its range, but overall is listed as being of &quot;least concern&quot; in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is threatened by habitat loss, especially by drainage of its breeding sites, and some toads get killed on the roads as they make their annual migrations. It has long been associated in popular culture and literature with witchcraft.

== Taxonomy ==

The common toad was first given the name &quot;Rana bufo&quot; by the Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus in the &quot;10th edition of Systema Naturae&quot; in 1758. In this work, he placed all the frogs and toads in the single genus &quot;Rana&quot;. It later became apparent that this genus should be divided, and in 1768, the Austrian naturalist Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti placed the common toad in the genus &quot;Bufo&quot;, naming it &quot;Bufo bufo&quot;. The toads in this genus are included in the family Bufonidae, the true toads.

Various subspecies of &quot;B. bufo&quot; have been recognized over the years. The Caucasian toad is found in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and was at one time classified as &quot;B. b. verrucosissima&quot;. It has a larger genome and differs from &quot;B. bufo&quot; morphologically and is now accepted as &quot;Bufo verrucosissimus&quot;. The spiny toad was classified as &quot;B. b. spinosus&quot;. It is found in France, the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb and grows to a larger size and has a spinier skin than its more northern counterparts with which it intergrades. It is now accepted as &quot;Bufo spinosus&quot;. The Gredos toad, &quot;B. b. gredosicola&quot;, is restricted to the Sierra de Gredos, a mountain range in central Spain. It has exceptionally large paratoid glands and its colour tends to be blotched rather than uniform. It is now considered to be a synonym of &quot;Bufo spinosus&quot;.

&quot;B. bufo&quot; is part of a species complex, a group of closely related species which cannot be clearly demarcated. Several modern species are believed to form an ancient group of related taxa from preglacial times. These are the spiny toad (&quot;B. spinosus&quot;), the Caucasian toad (&quot;B. verrucosissimus&quot;) and the Japanese common toad (&quot;B. japonicus&quot;). The European common toad (&quot;Bufo bufo&quot;) seems to have arisen more recently. It is believed that the range of the ancestral form extended into Asia but that isolation between the eastern and western species complexes occurred as a result of the development of the Central Asian Deserts during the Middle Miocene. The exact taxonomic relationships between these species remains unclear. A serological investigation into toad populations in Turkey undertaken in 2001 examined the blood serum proteins of &quot;Bufo verrucosissimus&quot; and &quot;Bufo spinosus&quot;. It found that the differences between the two were not significant and that therefore the former should be synonymized with the latter.

A study published in 2012 examined the phylogenetic relationships between the Eurasian and North African species in the &quot;Bufo bufo&quot; group and indicated a long evolutionary history for the group. Nine to thirteen million years ago, &quot;Bufo eichwaldi&quot;, a recently described species from south Azerbaijan and Iran, split from the main lineage. Further divisions occurred with &quot;Bufo spinosus&quot; splitting off about five million years ago when the Pyrenees were being uplifted, an event which isolated the populations in the Iberian Peninsula from those in the rest of Europe. The remaining European lineage split into &quot;Bufo bufo&quot; and &quot;Bufo verrucosissimus&quot; less than three million years ago during the Pleistocene. Very occasionally the common toad hybridizes with the natterjack toad (&quot;Bufo calamita&quot;) or the European green toad (&quot;Bufo viridis&quot;).

== Description ==

The common toad can reach about in length. Females are normally stouter than males and southern specimens tend to be larger than northern ones. The head is broad with a wide mouth below the terminal snout which has two small nostrils. There are no teeth. The bulbous, protruding eyes have yellow or copper coloured irises and horizontal slit-shaped pupils. Just behind the eyes are two bulging regions, the paratoid glands, which are positioned obliquely. They contain a noxious substance, bufotoxin, which is used to deter potential predators. The head joins the body without a noticeable neck and there is no external vocal sac. The body is broad and squat and positioned close to the ground. The fore limbs are short with the toes of the fore feet turning inwards. At breeding time, the male develops nuptial pads on the first three fingers. He uses these to grasp the female when mating. The hind legs are short relative to other frogs&#x27; legs and the hind feet have long, unwebbed toes. There is no tail. The skin is dry and covered with small wart-like lumps. The colour is a fairly uniform shade of brown, olive-brown or greyish-brown, sometimes partly blotched or banded with a darker shade. The common toad tends to be sexually dimorphic with the females being browner and the males greyer. The underside is a dirty white speckled with grey and black patches.

Other species with which the common toad could be confused include the natterjack toad (&quot;Bufo calamita&quot;) and the European green toad (&quot;Bufo viridis&quot;). The former is usually smaller and has a yellow band running down its back while the latter has a distinctive mottled pattern. The paratoid glands of both are parallel rather than slanting as in the common toad. The common frog (&quot;Rana temporaria&quot;) is also similar in appearance but it has a less rounded snout, damp smooth skin, and usually moves by leaping.

Common toads can live for many years and have survived for fifty years in captivity. In the wild, common toads are thought to live for about ten to twelve years. Their age can be determined by counting the number of annual growth rings in the bones of their phalanges.
== Distribution and habitat ==

After the common frog (&quot;Rana temporaria&quot;), the edible frog (&quot;Pelophylax esculentus&quot;) and the smooth newt (&quot;Lissotriton vulgaris&quot;), the common toad is the fourth most common amphibian in Europe. It is found throughout the continent with the exception of Iceland, the cold northern parts of Scandinavia, Ireland and a number of Mediterranean islands. These include Malta, Crete, Corsica, Sardinia and the Balearic Islands. Its easterly range extends to Irkutsk in Siberia and its southerly range includes parts of northwestern Africa in the northern mountain ranges of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. A closely related variant lives in eastern Asia including Japan. The common toad is found at altitudes of up to in the southern part of its range. It is largely found in forested areas with coniferous, deciduous and mixed woodland, especially in wet locations. It also inhabits open countryside, fields, copses, parks and gardens, and often occurs in dry areas well away from standing water.

== Behaviour and lifecycle==
The common toad usually moves by walking rather slowly or in short shuffling jumps involving all four legs. It spends the day concealed in a lair that it has hollowed out under foliage or beneath a root or a stone where its colouring makes it inconspicuous. It emerges at dusk and may travel some distance in the dark while hunting. It is most active in wet weather. By morning it has returned to its base and may occupy the same place for several months. It is voracious and eats woodlice, slugs, beetles, caterpillars, flies, ants, spiders, earthworms and even small mice. Small, fast moving prey may be caught by a flick of the tongue while larger items are grabbed with the jaws. Having no teeth, it swallows food whole in a series of gulps. It does not recognise its prey as such but will try to consume any small, dark coloured, moving object it encounters at night. A research study showed that it would snap at a moving piece of black paper as if it were prey but would disregard a larger moving piece. Toads seem to use visual cues for feeding and can see their prey at low light intensities where humans are unable to discern anything. Periodically, the common toad sheds its skin. This comes away in tattered pieces and is then consumed.

In 2007, researchers using a remotely operated underwater vehicle to survey Loch Ness, Scotland, observed a common toad moving along the bottom of the lake at a depth of . They were surprised to find that an air-breathing animal could survive in such a location.

The annual life cycle of the common toad is divided into three periods: the winter sleep, the time of mating and feeding period.

=== Predators and parasites ===
When attacked, the common toad adopts a characteristic stance, inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered. Its chief means of defence lies in the foul tasting secretion that is produced by its paratoid glands and other glands on its skin. This contains a toxin called bufagin and is enough to deter many predators although grass snakes seem to be unaffected by it. Other predators of adult toads include hedgehogs, rats, mink, and even domestic cats. Birds that feed on toads include herons, crows and birds of prey. Crows have been observed to puncture the skin with their beak and then peck out the toad&#x27;s liver, thus avoiding the toxin. The tadpoles also exude noxious substances which deter fish from eating them but not the great crested newt. Aquatic invertebrates that feed on toad tadpoles include dragonfly larvae, diving beetles and water boatmen. These usually avoid the noxious secretion by puncturing the tadpole&#x27;s skin and sucking out its juices.
A parasitic fly, &quot;Lucilia bufonivora&quot;, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad&#x27;s skin and when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad&#x27;s nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (&quot;Sphaerium corneum&quot;) is unusual in that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this is believed to be one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.

=== Reproduction ===
The common toad emerges from hibernation in spring and there is a mass migration towards the breeding sites. The toads converge on certain ponds that they favour while avoiding other stretches of water that seem eminently suitable. Adults use the same location year after year and over 80% of males marked as juveniles have been found to return to the pond at which they were spawned. They find their way to these by using a suite of orientation cues, including olfactory and magnetic cues, but also visual cues help guide their journeys. Toads experimentally moved elsewhere and fitted with tracking devices have been found to be able to locate their chosen breeding pond when the displacement exceeded three kilometres (two miles).
The males arrive first and remain in the location for several weeks while the females only stay long enough to mate and spawn. Rather than fighting for the right to mate with a female, male toads may settle disputes by means of the pitch of their voice. Croaking provides a reliable sign of body size and hence of prowess. Nevertheless, fights occur in some instances. In a study at one pond where males outnumbered females by four or five to one, it was found that 38% of the males won the right to mate by defeating rivals in combat or by displacing other males already mounted on females. Male toads generally outnumber female toads at breeding ponds. A Swedish study found that female mortality was higher than that of males and that 41% of females did not come to the breeding pond in the spring and missed a year before reproducing again.

The males mount the females&#x27; backs, grasping them with their fore limbs under the armpits in a grip that is known as amplexus. The males are enthusiastic, will try to grasp fish or inanimate objects and often mount the backs of other males. Sometimes several toads form a heap, each male trying to grasp the female at the base. It is a stressful period and mortality is high among breeding toads. A successful male stays in amplexus for several days and, as the female lays a long, double string of small black eggs, he fertilises them with his sperm. As the pair wander piggyback around the shallow edges of the pond, the gelatinous egg strings, which may contain 1,500 to 6,000 eggs and be in length, get tangled in plant stalks.

The strings of eggs absorb water and swell in size, and small tadpoles hatch out after 10 days. At first they cling to the remains of the strings and feed on the jelly. They later attach themselves to the underside of the leaves of water weed before becoming free swimming. The tadpoles at first look similar to those of the common frog (&quot;Rana temporaria&quot;) but they are a darker colour, being blackish above and dark grey below. They can be distinguished from the tadpoles of other species by the fact that the mouth is the same width as the space between the eyes, and this is twice as large as the distance between the nostrils. Over the course of a few weeks their legs develop and their tail gradually gets reabsorbed. By twelve weeks of age they are miniature toads measuring about long and ready to leave the pond.

=== Development and growth ===
The common toad reaches maturity at three to seven years old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode &quot;Rhabdias bufonis&quot;. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, there was no significant difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.


A comparison was made between the growth rate of newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates for males and females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.

=== Winter sleep ===
Common toads winter in various holes in the ground, sometimes in basements, often in droves with other amphibians. Rarely they spend the winter in flowing waters with the common frogs and green frogs.

===Sperm senescence===

The post-meiotic intra-testicular sperm of &quot;B. bufo&quot; undergoes senescence over time as measured by sperm motility. This type of sperm senescence does not occur at a genetically fixed rate, but rather is influenced by environmental conditions that include availability of mating partners and temperature.

== Conservation ==
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species considers the common toad as being of &quot;least concern&quot;. This is because it has a wide distribution and is, over most of its range, a common species. It is not particularly threatened by habitat loss because it is adaptable and is found in deciduous and coniferous forests, scrubland, meadows, parks and gardens. It prefers damp areas with dense foliage. The major threats it faces include loss of habitat locally, the drainage of wetlands where it breeds, agricultural activities, pollution, and mortality on roads. Chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease of amphibians, has been reported in common toads in Spain and the United Kingdom and may affect some populations.

There are parts of its range where the common toad seems to be in decline. In Spain, increased aridity and habitat loss have led to a diminution in numbers and it is regarded as &quot;near threatened&quot;. A population in the Sierra de Gredos mountain range is facing predation by otters and increased competition from the frog &quot;Pelophylax perezi&quot;. Both otter and frog seem to be extending their ranges to higher altitudes. The common toad cannot be legally sold or traded in the United Kingdom but there is a slow decline in toad numbers and it has therefore been declared a Biodiversity Action Plan priority species. In Russia, it is considered to be a &quot;Rare Species&quot; in the Bashkortostan Republic, the Tatarstan Republic, the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, and the Irkutsk Oblast, but during the 1990s, it became more abundant in Moscow Oblast.

It has been found that urban populations of common toad occupying small areas and isolated by development show a lower level of genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations. The researchers demonstrated this by genetic analysis and by noting the greater number of physical abnormalities among urban as against rural tadpoles when raised in a controlled environment. It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.

=== Roadkill ===
Many toads are killed by traffic while migrating to their breeding grounds. In Europe they have the highest rate of mortality from roadkill among amphibians. Many of the deaths take place on stretches of road where streams flow underneath showing that migration routes often follow water courses. In some places in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Northern Italy and Poland, special tunnels have been constructed so that toads can cross under roads in safety. In other places, local wildlife groups run &quot;toad patrols&quot;, carrying the amphibians across roads at busy crossing points in buckets. The toads start moving at dusk and for them to travel far, the temperature needs to remain above . On a warm wet night they may continue moving all night but if it cools down, they may stop earlier. An estimate was made of the significance of roadkill in toad populations in the Netherlands. The number of females killed in the spring migration on a quiet country road (ten vehicles per hour) was compared with the number of strings of eggs laid in nearby fens. A 30% mortality rate was found, with the rate for deaths among males likely to be of a similar order.

== Bufotoxin ==
The main substance found in the parotoid gland and skin of the common toad is called bufotoxin. It was first isolated by Heinrich Wieland and his colleagues in 1922, and they succeeded in identifying its structure about 20 years later. Meanwhile, other researchers succeeded in isolating the same compound (and its parent steroid, bufotalin) from the Japanese toad, &quot;Bufo japonicus&quot;. 

By 1986, researchers at Arizona State University had succeeded in synthesizing the toad toxin constituents bufotalin, bufalitoxin and bufotoxin. The chemical formula of bufotoxin is C40H60N4O10. Its physical effects resemble those of digoxin, which, in small doses, increases the strength with which the heart muscle contracts; synthesized from foxglove plants (&quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot;), digoxin is used in the treatment of congestive heart failure. The skin of the South American cane toad contains enough similar toxin to cause serious symptoms (or even death) in animals, including humans. Clinical effects include severe irritation and pain to eyes, mouth, nose and throat, cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms, paralysis and seizures, increased salivation, vomiting, hyperkalemia, cyanosis and hallucinations. There is no known anti-venom. Treatment consists of supporting respiratory and cardiovascular functions, prevention of absorption and electrocardiography to monitor the condition. Atropine, phenytoin, cholestyramine and lidocaine may prove useful in its management.

== Cultural significance ==
The toad has long been considered to be an animal of ill omen or a connection to a spirit world. This may have its origins in the fact that it is at home both on land and in the water. It may cause repugnance because of its drab, wart-like skin, its slow movements and the way it emerges from some dark hole. In Europe in the Middle Ages, the toad was associated with the Devil, for whom a coat-of-arms was invented emblazoned with three toads. It was known that the toad could poison people and, as the witch&#x27;s familiar, it was thought to possess magical powers. Even ordinary people made use of dried toads, their bile, faeces and blood. In some areas, the finding of a toad in a house was considered evidence that a witch was present. In the Basque Country, the familiars were believed to be toads wearing elegant robes. These were herded by children who were being trained as witches. Between 1610 and 1612, the Spanish inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Frías investigated witchcraft in the region and searched the houses of suspected witches for dressed toads. He found none. These witches were reputed to use undomesticated toads as ingredients in their liniments and brews.

An English folk tale tells how an old woman, a supposed witch, cursed her landlord and all his possessions when he demanded the unpaid rent for her cottage. Soon afterwards, a large toad fell on his wife and caused her to collapse. The toad was thrown into the fire but escaped with severe burns. Meanwhile, the old witch&#x27;s cottage had caught fire and she was badly burnt. By next day, both toad and witch had died, and it was found that the woman&#x27;s burns exactly mirrored those of the toad.

The saliva of the toad was considered poisonous and was known as &quot;sweltered venom&quot; and it was believed that it could spit or vomit poisonous fire. Toads were associated with devils and demons and in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, John Milton depicted Satan as a toad when he poured poison into Eve&#x27;s ear. The First Witch in Shakespeare&#x27;s Macbeth gave instructions on using a toad in the concoction of spells:


It was also believed that there was a jewel inside a toad&#x27;s head, a &quot;toadstone&quot;, that when worn as a necklace or ring would warn the wearer of attempts to poison them. Shakespeare mentioned this in &quot;As You Like It&quot;:

Mr. Toad is one of the main characters in the children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, by Kenneth Grahame. This has been dramatized by several authors including A. A. Milne who called his play &quot;Toad of Toad Hall&quot;. Mr. Toad is a conceited, anthropomorphic toad and in the book he composes a ditty in his own praise which starts like this:

George Orwell in his essay &quot;Some Thoughts on the Common Toad&quot; described the emergence of the common toad from hibernation as one of the most moving signs of spring.

The series depicts an interfaith marriage between an Irish Catholic teacher (Bridget Fitzgerald) from a wealthy family and a Jewish cab driver who aspires to be a playwright (Bernie Steinberg), whom she had met at a bus stop. With a primetime slot between &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; on Saturday nights, the situation comedy was No. 5 in the ratings among all shows for the 1972-73 television season and obtained a 24.2 rating, tying &quot;The NBC Sunday Mystery Movie.&quot; However, CBS executives canceled the show in response to negative reactions to the characters&#x27; marriage, the show thus being the highest-rated television program to be canceled after only one season.

Supporting cast members included Audra Lindley, David Doyle, Harold J. Stone, Ned Glass and Bibi Osterwald. Lindley and Doyle played Bridget&#x27;s wealthy parents, Walter and Amy Fitzgerald, and Stone and Osterwald played Bernie&#x27;s lower-class parents, Sam and Sophie Steinberg. The Steinbergs owned a delicatessen above which Bridget and Bernie lived. Glass played Bernie&#x27;s uncle, Moe Plotnik. Robert Sampson played Bridget&#x27;s brother, Catholic priest Father Michael Fitzgerald; he was more sympathetic than others to his sister&#x27;s marriage. Bill Elliott played Otis, Bernie&#x27;s best friend and fellow cab driver. Nancy Walker was cast as Bernie&#x27;s religious Jewish Aunt Ruthie and Nora Marlowe was cast as Bridget&#x27;s nun Aunt Agnes in the 1972 episode &quot;The Little White Lie That Grew and Grew&quot;.

== Controversy ==

The series was controversial because of the differing faiths of the married characters. Some Jewish groups charged that the series &quot;mocked the teachings of Judaism&quot;. Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, executive vice-president of the Rabbinical Assembly of America, called the show &quot;an insult to some of the most sacred values of both the Jewish and Catholic religions&quot;. Rabbi Meir Kahane wrote an essay on the series. Orthodox rabbis met with CBS officials several times. A Conservative rabbi organized a boycott by advertisers, and Reform rabbis met with CBS staff in secret to have the show canceled. Rabbi Abraham Gross, president of the Rabbinical Alliance of Orthodox Rabbis and Educators, described the show as a &quot;flagrant insult&quot; to Jews, protesting that intermarriage was strictly forbidden under Jewish law. Threats followed; Meredith Baxter said, &quot;We had bomb threats on the show. Some guys from the Jewish Defense League came to my house to say they wanted to talk with me about changing the show.&quot; Threatening phone calls made to the home of producer Ralph Riskin resulted in the arrest of Robert S. Manning, described as a member of the Jewish Defense League. Manning was later indicted on unrelated murder charges and fought extradition to the United States from Israel, where he fled.

==Home media==
On December 4, 2012, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the complete series as a manufacture-on-demand DVD set in Region 1, available in the U.S. exclusively through Amazon.com and WBShop.com.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Bridget Loves Bernie&quot; was referenced to in the &quot;MAD Magazine&quot; article &quot;M*A*S*Huga&quot; (its first satire of the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; TV series) which appeared in Issue # 166 (April 1974). The Surgeon General stated to &quot;Cockeye Piercer&quot; and &quot;Crapper John&quot; that they were put in-between &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot; only because religious groups objected to &quot;Bridget Loves Bernie&quot;, which was a reference to the fact that &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; was put in the time slot in between those two shows in the 1973-74 TV season after the cancellation of &quot;Bridget Loves Bernie&quot;.

<text>The War on Errorism is the ninth studio album by the American punk rock band NOFX. It was released on May 6, 2003, through Fat Wreck Chords.

The album was recorded in 2003 after they left Epitaph Records in 2001, following the release of 2000&#x27;s &quot;Pump Up the Valuum&quot;.

==Background==
In September 2002, after 13 weeks of continuous touring around the world, the band began writing material for their next album. On November 26, it was reported that NOFX left Epitaph Records, and were expecting to release their next album through Fat Wreck Chords, which was tentatively titled &quot;Our Second Best Album&quot;. On December 9, the album&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;The War on Errorism&quot;.

Other songs recorded during this time, but not released on the album, are: &quot;Jaw, Knee, Music&quot;, &quot;One Way Ticket to Fuckneckville&quot; (Keyboards version), &quot;Glass War&quot;, &quot;Idiot Son of an Asshole&quot;, &quot;13 Stitches&quot; (acoustic), &quot;Hardcore 84&quot;.

==Composition==
The album takes aim at U.S. President George W. Bush, criticizing him and his policies, while the cover features a cartoon version of the president as a clown. The back of the cover booklet and runout groove has a caption stating &quot;Somewhere in Texas there is a village without its idiot&quot;.

&quot;Mattersville&quot; was originally released on &quot;Fat Music Volume 6: Uncontrollable Fatulence&quot;. A few songs from &quot;The War on Errorism&quot; were included on the &quot;Regaining Unconsciousness&quot; EP, released earlier.

Canadian punk musician and NOFX fan Talli Osborne, who was born without arms and is missing some bones in her legs, is the subject of &quot;She&#x27;s Nubs&quot;.

==Release==
On March 19, 2003, &quot;Idiots Are Taking Over&quot; was posted on the label&#x27;s website, followed by the album&#x27;s artwork two days later. NOFX released the &quot;Regaining Unconsciousness&quot; EP on March 25, 2003. &quot;The War on Errorism&quot; was released on May 6, 2003, through Fat Wreck Chords. The album was released as an Enhanced CD, and features an introduction from Fat Mike and Eric Melvin, an 8-minute trailer for the movie , a music video for &quot;Franco Un-American&quot;, and a live video of the song &quot;Idiot Son of an Asshole.&quot; In May and June, the band toured Europe as part of the Deconstruction Tour. On June 5, the band appeared on &quot;54321&quot;. The band played a few US shows in March 2004, prior to touring the West Coast as part of the Punkvoter Tour. They then embarked on a tour of Europe in May 2004, with Swingin&#x27; Utters and the Epoxies. NOFX performed on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on August 10, 2004. The band was due to appear on the Warped Tour, until Mike and his wife were expecting a child in August 2004.

The song &quot;Franco Un-American&quot; was the first single, garnering some airplay on major radio stations in the United States. A music video was also made for the song.

==Reception==

In a review on AllMusic, reviewer Johnny Loftus wrote: &quot;Musically, NOFX fuses its political cynicism with criticism of punk rock itself and suggests that the best thing for all the kids and the bands might be to close ranks and start their own little hardcore community. &#x27;Irrationality of Rationality&#x27; and &#x27;Franco Un-American&#x27;—two of the album&#x27;s most melodic, catchy songs—are also two of &quot;War on Errorism&quot;″s most biting commentaries. The first personalizes the trickle-down effect of corporate decision-making over a lockstep hardcore rhythm; the second gets all-new wavy as Fat Mike reasons out his own world view, and somehow rhymes &quot;apathy&quot; with &quot;Noam Chomsky.

The album reached the #1 position on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Independent Albums chart, as well as #44 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200.

==Legacy==
The track, &quot;Idiots Are Taking Over&quot; was featured as the song on the DVD menu of &quot;The Sasquatch Gang&quot;.

In an episode of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, several lines from &quot;Re-Gaining Unconsciousness&quot; were read aloud, and &quot;The Separation of Church and Skate&quot; was a playable track on &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;.

Pop-punk band MxPx released a cover of &quot;Franco Un-American&quot; on July 2, 2019, with updated lyrics reflecting the contemporary American political climate. The cover artwork mimics that of &quot;The War on Errorism&quot;, with a caricature of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in place of George W. Bush.

<text>The M181 is a motorway that links the town of Scunthorpe, England, to the M180 motorway. A spur of the M180, the road is virtually straight through its entire length. It was opened in December 1978, at the same time as the section of M180 from junction 3 (A15) to the east side of the River Trent (the bridge was not opened until late 1979).

==Route==

It begins just outside Scunthorpe, at the junction of the A1077 and A18. There is an out-of-town retail park, known locally as Gallagher Retail Park, which offers a variety of food and retail outlets, and Glanford Park, the home of Scunthorpe United Football Club at this junction. At the other end, the road has a junction for the M180 east, while the main carriageway merges with the M180 west. It has no intermediate junctions. It is built to typical British motorway standards, being two lanes in each direction, plus a hard shoulder for its entire length.

In January 2019, as part of the Lincolnshire Lakes development, North Lincolnshire Council gave the green light for construction of a new roundabout junction along the M181 with the B1450 Burringham Road which would form the terminus of the motorway. Work began on this new junction in June 2020. Further plans have seen a new roundabout constructed at the southern end of the motorway at which point the M181 will lose its motorway status, with the northern section becoming the A1077 (temporarily A1077(M)) and the southern section becoming the M180 access slips to junction 3.

<text>Timba is a Cuban genre of music based on Cuban &quot;son&quot; with &quot;salsa&quot;, American 
Funk/R&amp;B and the strong influence of Afro-Cuban folkloric music. Timba rhythm sections differ from their salsa counterparts, because timba emphasizes the bass drum, which is not used in salsa bands. Timba and salsa use the same tempo range and they both use the standard conga marcha. Almost all timba bands have a trap drummer. Timbas also often break the basic tenets of arranging the music in-clave. Timba is considered to be a highly aggressive type of music, with rhythm and &quot;swing&quot; taking precedence over melody and lyricism. Associated with timba is a radically sexual and provocative dance style known as despelote (literally meaning chaos or frenzy). It is a dynamic evolution of salsa, full of improvisation and Afro Cuban heritage, based on son, Rumba and mambo, taking inspiration from Latin jazz, and is highly percussive with complex sections. Timba is more flexible than salsa and includes a more diverse range of styles. Timba incorporates heavy percussion and rhythms which originally came from the barrios of Cuba.

==Etymology==
Before it became the newest Cuban music and dance craze, &quot;timba&quot; was a word with several different uses yet no particular definition, mostly heard within the Afro-Cuban genre of rumba. A &quot;timbero&quot; was a complimentary term for a musician, and &quot;timba&quot; often referred to the collection of drums in a folklore ensemble. Since the 1990s, timba has referred to Cuba&#x27;s intense and slightly more aggressive music and dance form.

==History==

As opposed to salsa, whose roots are strictly from son and the Cuban &quot;conjunto&quot; bands of the 1940s and 1950s, timba represents a synthesis of many folkloric (rumba, guaguancó, batá drumming and the sacred songs of santería.), and popular sources (even taking inspiration from non Afro-Cuban musical genres such as rock, jazz, funk, and Puerto Rican folk). According to Vincenzo Perna, author of &quot;Timba: The Sound of the Cuban Crisis&quot;, timba needs to be spoken of because of its musical, cultural, social, and political reasons; its sheer popularity in Cuba, its novelty and originality as a musical style, the skill of its practitioners, its relationship with both local traditions and the culture of the black Diaspora, its meanings, and the way its style brings to light the tension points within society. In addition to timbales, timba drummers make use of the drum set, further distinguishing the sound from that of mainland salsa. The use of synthesised keyboard is also common. Timba songs tend to sound more innovative, experimental and frequently more virtuosic than salsa pieces; horn parts are usually fast, at times even bebop influenced, and stretch to the extreme ranges of all instruments. Bass and percussion patterns are similarly unconventional. Improvisation is commonplace.

===Precursors===

The main precursors of timba are three bands: Los Van Van, Irakere (both in the 1970s) and NG La Banda (1988), though many other bands (e.g. Son 14, Orquesta Original de Manzanillo, Ritmo Oriental, Orquesta Revé) were influential in setting new standards.

====Orquesta Revé====
Elio Revé Matos was a Cuban musician and songwriter, a noted percussionist, born 23 June 1930 in Guantánamo. In 1956, he formed &quot;Elio Revé y su Charangón&quot; aka &quot;Orquesta Revé&quot;. Revé&#x27;s Charanga included Trombones and Batá drum and he became known as the Father of Changüí for his contribution to that musical genre. In the 1970s, directed by timbalero Revé, Orquesta Revé saw innovations in timbales playing.

Elio Revé Sr. was an incomparable talent scout. He may also have been a difficult man to work for, if the number of musicians who have left his band is any indication! The incredible legacy of famous Revé spinoff bands began shortly after his group relocated from Guantanamo to Havana in 1956. In 1958, most of the members left to form Ritmo Oriental. In 1965, his young pianist Chucho Valdés left to pursue a jazz career, which resulted in the formation of Irakere. In 1968, bassist, Juan Formell, Pupy Pedroso and others left to form Los Van Van. In the late 70s, Armando Gola, German Velazco and Pepe Maza left to form Orquesta 440. Singer Félix Baloy left after 1982 and enjoyed a long career with Adalberto Álvarez and as a solo artist. Arranger Ignacio Herrera also left after 1982. We are not sure what happened to Herrera, but based on his stunning arrangements on the 1982 album, he certainly had the potential to create a brilliant spinoff band of his own. Another &quot;missing-in-action&quot; Revé alumnus who might well extended to this list was Tony García, the pianist and musical director of the early 1990s and the arranger of Revé famous &quot;Mi salsa tiene sandunga&quot; which became the theme song of Cuba television&#x27;s most important music show, Mi Salsa.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It was Herrera&#x27;s departure that led Revé to focus his talent scouting spotlight on another composer and arranger Juan Carlos Alfonso. Alfonso is also the brilliant pianist whose tumbaos will be studied in this section. After five years and four classic albums which elevated Revé to Van Van-like popularity and earned them the nickname La explosión del momento, Alfonso himself left the band in 1988 to form Dan Den... Suffice it to say that the history of Revé is like the corner of Hollywood and Vine if you study it carefully enough, you&#x27;ll encounter most of the important Cuban musicians of the last 50 years in the process.—Moore (2010: v. 4: 49)

Others associated with Revé included the singer Yumurí. Elio was the father of musician brothers, Oderquis Reve and Elio jr (&quot;Elito&quot;), the latter continuing a direct link to his father&#x27;s music with Elito Revé y su Charangón. Singer and writer, Emilio Frías “El Niño”, gained experience with the group before forming &quot;El Niño y La Verdad&quot; in June 2013.

====Son 14====

Grandes &quot;Èxitos EGREM CD 0325&quot; (Son 14). This CD is an excellent compilation of the best songs of Son 14 during the years in which Adalberto Álvarez led the band (1979–1983)

Adalberto Álvarez, born in Havana and raised in Camagüey, had already had some success writing songs for Rumbavana when Rodulfo Vaillant, one of the most recorded composers of the era, invited him come to Santiago as the musical director and pianist of a new group called Son 14. The group got off to a roaring start in 1979 with Adalberto&#x27;s first massive hit, &quot;A Bayamo en coche.&quot; Alvarez left after three classic albums (plus a fourth featuring Omara Portuondo singing songs from the other three) but Son 14 has stayed together, recording sporadically, under the leadership of Eduardo &quot;Tiburón&quot; Morales, the original singer of &quot;A Bayamo en coche.&quot;

Adalberto Álvarez was among the first to popularize the use of &quot;gospel&quot; chord progressions using major triads built on II, III and VI. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, more and more elements of the pop music harmonic palette became acceptable in Latin music and by the 1990s, anything that produced a hook became fair game, resulting in an explosion of brilliant songwriting while North American salsa continued to be constrained by the formulaic limitations of the genre.—Moore (2010: v. 4: 22)

====Orquesta Ritmo Oriental====

Ritmo Oriental, often known as &quot;La Ritmo&quot;, was one of the most popular bands in Cuba in the 1970s and 1980s. ... La Ritmo&#x27;s violin tumbaos were endlessly inventive and Humberto Perera, often the arranger as well as the bassist, created bass tumbaos which were both thematic and filled the holes created by the other tumbaos. Pianist Luis Adolfo Peoalver mostly stayed within the typical style of the 1970s and 80s, locking down the groove with the violin section and Lazaga&#x27;s machete-style güiro, while Perera, drummer Daniel Díaz, conguero Juan Claro Bravo and the band&#x27;s extraordinary arrangers soared to unprecedented creative heights.—Moore (2010: v. 3: 33)

====Original de Manzanillo====

Original de Manzanillo added guitar to the standard charanga instrumentation. Less adventurous than Ritmo Oriental and the other modern charangas, it was distinguished primarily by its singer and composer, Candido Fabré, an extraordinary performer who influenced almost every subsequent singer with his uncanny ability to improvise lyrics. Original de Manzanillo&#x27;s pianist and leader Wilfredo &quot;Pachy&quot; Naranjo is still with the group and his son, Pachy Jr., is the current pianist for Orquesta Revé and has recorded with many others, including Angel Bonne.—Moore (2010: v. 3: 33)

====Los Van Van====

In 1969, Formell left Revé to form his own band, Los Van Van, taking with him many of Revé&#x27;s musicians, including pianist Pupy Pedroso. His first new songs bore much in common with the music he created for Revé although he began calling it &quot;songo&quot; instead of &quot;changüí&quot;.—Moore (2010: v. 3: 16)

Los Van Van developed what came to be known as the &#x27;songo&#x27; genre, making countless innovations to traditional son, both in style and orchestration. In Latin music, genres are commonly attributed to rhythms (though of course not every rhythm is a genre), and whether or not timba is a genre of its own is debatable. Songo, however, can be considered to be a genre and is in all likelihood the only genre in the world played by only one orchestra, Los Van Van. The songo rhythm was created by percussionist José Luís Quintana (&quot;Changuito&quot;), at the behest of Van Van bandleader Juan Formell. Since the band&#x27;s creation in 1969, Los Van Van has been the most popular band in Cuba, and are themselves considered to be one of the major timba bands.

====Irakere====

Irakere is known largely as a Latin jazz band outside Cuba, yet much of their music can be considered to be popular dance music. Like Los Van Van, Irakere experimented with many different styles, mixing Afro-Cuban rhythms with son and jazz. While bandleader Chucho Valdés is revered as one of the great jazz musicians of Cuba, both jazz and timba prodigies came out of the orchestra, including flutist José Luis Cortés (&quot;El Tosco&quot;), who assembled a group of highly talented musicians to form NG La Banda in the mid-1980s. NG experimented with different styles, including Latin jazz, for several years, before recording what is considered by many to be the first timba album, &quot;En La Calle&quot;, in 1989.

===Special Period (early 1990s)===
During the Special Period of the early 1990s, timba became a significant form of expression for the cultural and social upheaval that occurred. The Special Period was a time of economic downfalls and hardships for the Cuban people. In the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Cuba&#x27;s main trading partner, the country experienced its worse crisis since the revolution. Cuba now opened its doors to tourism, and the influx of tourists to the island helped broaden the appeal of the music and dance of timba. The stand-off between Cuba and most of the rest of the world gave timba space to breathe new life into the city, causing the nightlife and party scene to grow. Timba&#x27;s danceable beat and energizing sound was popular among the tourists at a time when the music and dance scene was indirectly helping provide some support for Cuba&#x27;s struggling economy.

While timba developed at the beginning of a decade when Afro-Cuban conservatory graduates were turning to popular music catering to inner-city youth, its growth followed that of the music and tourist industries, as the state tried to address the economic challenges of the post-Soviet world. Timba lyrics generated considerable controversy due to their use of vulgar and witty street language, and also because they made veiled references to public concerns including prostitution, crime, and the effects of tourism on the island, which had only rarely been addressed by other musicians. This was not normal in Cuban texts before. There was also a reaffirmation of the Cuban identity. The difference of opinion between the old traditionalists going abroad for success and the young bloods stuck at home – and the difference in financial rewards – was bound to lead to friction. In the subsequent time, timba has largely crossed over from an accessible, mainstream medium to one that is directed at wealthy elites in high-end venues. This places timba in contrast with rap, which has come in some ways to fill the role of the music of the masses.

===NG La Banda===

Though NG La Banda had huge successes in the early 1990s, and is credited with being the first timba band, the band&#x27;s fortunes have been mixed, partly because they remain highly experimental.

NG La Banda, usually considered the first timba band, was among the first groups to standardize the use of gears and song-specific piano tumbaos, as well as being the first in a series of bands to experience &quot;mania&quot;-like popularity in Havana during the heady days of the 1990s.

In terms of its members, however, NG La Banda was far from new. They had already been playing under the name &quot;Nueva Generación&quot;, recording several eclectic jazz albums. Five members came directly from Irakere: the leader, José Luis &quot;El Tosco&quot; Cortés, and the entire horn section, known affectionately to fans as Los metales de terror for their flawless and aggressive execution of El Tosco&#x27;s virtuosic hornlines ... El Tosco [had a] stint in the 1970s with Los Van Van. His initial concept for NG La Banda was to combine the popular music appeal of Los Van Van with the jazz influences and stupendous musicianship of Irakere.

The rhythm section was no less virtuosic than the horns. Drummer Calixto Oviedo, Bassist Feliciano Arango, drummer Giraldo Piloto and conguero Wickly Nogueras went on to become legends on their respective instruments. Most important from our point of view was the pianist Rodulfo &quot;Peruchín&quot; Argudín.

The original singers were Tony Calla and Issac Delgado, from Ritmo Oriental and Pachito Alonso, respectively. Delgado left NG to form his own band in about 1991. Piloto joined him about a year later as drummer, composer and musical director. El Tosco replaced Issac with another great singer, Antonio Mena.—Moore (2010: v. 5: 14)

===La Charanga Habanera===

What came to be known as the &quot;timba explosion&quot; started not with NG La Banda, but with the debut album of La Charanga Habanera, &quot;Me Sube La Fiebre&quot;, in 1992. This album included all the elements of what is now known as timba, and the band dominated the scene until the break-up of the original band in 1998 (they have since reformed).

Charanga Habanera was ... catapulted to superstar status in the 1990s. Like NG La Banda, the charangueros had copious amounts of gear changes, song-specific tumbaos and attitude, but their musical style was drastically different and it kept changing and evolving with each album. Charanga Habanera&#x27;s albums can be bought in their original form, which is fortunate because they&#x27;re conceived as albums, with meticulous attention paid to artwork, track lists, and overall concept. Every note on these albums holds up under intense scrutiny. I&#x27;ve written extensive articles on each of the first five albums on www.timba.com and I&#x27;ve begun another, more technical batch of analyses of the same albums from the point of view of the rhythm section and its gear changes. Charanga Habanera&#x27;s timba.com section also includes extremely accurate transcriptions of every lyric, including guías, on each of these albums.

In terms of instrumentation, Charanga Habanera is about as far from being a charanga as it could possibly be, and there&#x27;s an interesting story behind the band&#x27;s misleading name. The group&#x27;s leader, David Calzado, who had played violin for Ritmo Oriental in the 1980s, landed a multi-year contract to play traditional charanga music each summer at a large Monte Carlo tourist hotel, hence the then-appropriate band name Charanga Habanera. Every weekend, the band would play the opening set for touring bands such as Earth, Wind and Fire, Stevie Wonder, James Brown and Kool &amp; The Gang, and the charangueros became huge fans of both the music and stage shows of North American R&amp;B. In the off-season, back in Cuba, there was very little work for their traditional music and the whole country was going wild for NG La Banda. In response, Calzado and musical director/pianist Juan Carlos Gonzalez changed everything about Charanga Habanera except the name. They added three trumpets and a sax, a bongosero, a kick drum, a synthesizer, elaborate costumes and stage shows, and a completely new kind of music which didn&#x27;t sound like NG La Banda or Earth, Wind and Fire, but which worked pure musical magic on all levels. The piano tumbaos and arrangements ... were nothing short of sublime.

Charanga Habanera underwent three distinct style periods in the 1993–1997 period, represented by the three albums pictured above. An earlier album, Love Fever (Me sube la fiebre), fits stylistically with Hey You Loca and even shares two important songs : Me sube la fiebre and Para el llanto. If you catch Charanga fever, there are three important classics on Love Fever that weren&#x27;t re-recorded on Hey You Loca: &quot;Extraños ateos&quot;, &quot;Pregón de chocolate&quot; and &quot;Te voy a liquidar.&quot;—Moore (2010: v. 5: 16)

Since then a large number of bands have sprung up in Cuba and internationally, many of the best known being headed or staffed by former members of the above-mentioned bands. Some important figures and bands include: Pachito Alonso y sus Kini Kini, Azúcar Negra, Bamboleo, Charanga Forever, Dan Den, Alain Pérez, Issac Delgado, Tirso Duarte, Klímax, Manolín &quot;El Médico de la salsa&quot;, Manolito y su Trabuco, Paulo FG, and Pupy y Los que Son, Son (directed by César &quot;Pupy&quot; Pedroso, former pianist of Los Van Van).

===Manolín &quot;El Médico de la salsa&quot;===

If the early 1990s popularity of NG La Banda and Charanga Habanera was unprecedented, the response to the arrival of the next superstar group bordered on the unbelievable: the Cuban equivalent of Beatlemania. The unlikely star was Manuel &quot;Manolín&quot; Gonzalez, an amateur songwriter whom NG&#x27;s El Tosco discovered at med school and famously dubbed &quot;El Médico de la Salsa&quot;. Manolín&#x27;s music was as different from Charanga Habanera as Charanga Habanera was from NG La Banda. His creative team included several arrangers, including the great Luis Bu, a brilliant pianist, Chaka Nápoles ... and an incredibly powerful and creative rhythm section. As influential as Manolín was from a strictly musical point of view, his charisma, popularity and unprecedented earning power had an even more seismic impact, causing a level of excitement among musicians that had not been seen since the 1950s, if ever. To borrow a phrase from Reggie Jackson, El Médico de la Salsa was &quot;the straw that stirs the drink.&quot;—Moore (2010: v. 5: 18)

===Paulito FG===

Paulo Fernández Gallo, aka Paulito FG, Pablo FG or Paulo FG, joined Issac Delgado and Manolìn as the three top singer-bandleaders of the 1990s. The other major bands of the era, from Los Van Van to Bamboleo, were led by musicians and featured a &quot;front line&quot; of two to four lead singers who took turns singing lead while the others sang coro.

Paulito&#x27;s vocal style is characterized by razor-sharp accuracy and an ability to reinvent the melodies of his compositions with each performance. Like a basketball point guard he was able to call gear changes spontaneously and only Issac Delgado&#x27;s band was able to vary their performances as much from night to night. Paulito&#x27;s band, the &quot;Elite&quot;, was indeed an elite force, with the best or one of the best players in Havana on nearly every instrument. Many of the members had stayed on from the Opus 13 days. Paulito wrote almost all of his material and had a brilliant chemistry with arranger Juan Ceruto and his all-star rhythm section, resulting in some of the most intricate and original arrangements of the 1990s. Aesthetically, Paulito&#x27;s music seems to share a kinship with Manolín&#x27;s but from our point of view a more useful comparison is with Delgado. Delgado&#x27;s and Paulito&#x27;s were arguably the greatest live timba bands from the point of view of being able to use gears and improvisation to make each performance of a song different from one concert to the next. Each group had wonderfully complex and flexible gear systems, and each had a string of brilliant pianists. Many of the top pianists played in both bands at different points. Paulito&#x27;s pianists were Emilio Morales, Sergio Noroña, Pepe Rivero, Yaniel &quot;El Majá&quot; Matos, Rolando Luna, and Roberto &quot;Cucurucho&quot; Carlos. Delgado&#x27;s were Tony Pérez, Melón Lewis, Pepe Rivero, Yaniel &quot;El Maja&quot; Matos, Roberto &quot;Cucurucho&quot; Carlos, Rolando Luna and Tony Rodríguez.—Moore (2010: v. 5: 20)

===Manolito y su Trabuco===

Manolito y su Trabuco&#x27;s front line has included some of the best singers of the era, including Rosendo &quot;El Gallo&quot; Díaz, Sixto &quot;El Indio&quot; Llorente (who sang many of the Orquesta Aliamén ... and Carlos Kalunga, who sang many of the recommended Klímax songs in the previous section. Manolito&#x27;s 1990s recordings also feature one of the best and most thoughtful synthesizer players, Osiris Martínez, who now plays with Los Que Son Son. Manolito has a great musical chemistry with the groupís other prolific composer, singer Ricardo Amaray. Many of Trabuco&#x27;s biggest hits result from Amaray&#x27;s unabashed R&amp;B influences being filtered through Simonet&#x27;s strong Cuban aesthetic and arranging genius.

Like Issac Delgado, Manolito made CDs that mixed the aggressive hardcore timba he played in concert with various other styles designed to appeal to foreign buyers cumbias targeting South American audiences for example. Manolito&#x27;s many timba masterpieces are spread across his 17-year discography a few on each album.—Moore (2010: v. 5: 22)

===Bamboleo===

Like Manolín, Bamboleo began life as one of El Tosco&#x27;s pet projects. Led by pianist Lázaro Valdés Jr., one of timba&#x27;s most original arrangers, they have an instantly recognizable sound, with R&amp;B and jazz fusion elements seamlessly integrated with aggressive timba, and a complex system of hand signals that allow bloques to be spontaneously built from smaller units. Only Issac Delgado and Paulito FG surpass Bamboleo in terms of using gear changes to vary live performances from night to night.–Moore (2010: v. 5: 23)

===Klímax===

Klímax leader Giraldo Piloto is one of the most important figures in all of Cuban music history. His father and namesake was half of the great songwriting team of Piloto y Vera and his uncle was the legendary percussionist Guillermo Barreto. Surpassing both famous relatives, Piloto won the timba.com readers poll for Best Timba Drummer and came in fourth for Best Songwriter. He left NG La Banda because it didnít afford him enough opportunity to write. As a freelancer he wrote three important songs for Charanga Habanera, including their breakthrough hit, &quot;Me sube la fiebre.&quot; After joining Issac, he continued to write prolifically.

When Piloto founded Klímax in 1995 his writing became even more melodically, harmonically and lyrically original, sometimes straying into controversial areas that resulted in songs being censored by the government and always pushing the envelope of musical creativity in wonderful and varied ways. Klímax is the most harmonically original and sophisticated popular music band in Cuban history.—Moore (2010: v. 5: 21)

===Bakuleye===

Bakuleye, known as a magic wand that awakens a deity living under the Earth, is another popular band in Cuba known for its timba. The band&#x27;s creator, Pedro Pablo Vargas, describes Bakuleye as the awakening of new ideas. The music of Bakuleye is a fusion of different musical rhythms such as Latin jazz, boleros, ballads, bachata, and especially salsa. As one of the most promising groups from Cuba, Bakuleye has received favorable press and television coverage.

===Outside Cuba===

Other than in Cuba, a few timba bands appeared in Miami, Florida, where a large concentration of Cuban-Americans reside. This became possible due to members of some timba bands moving to Miami, such as Isaac Delgado, Manolín &quot;El Médico de la Salsa&quot;, Dany Lozada (former singer and composer for Charanga Habanera), and Pepito Gómez (former singer in Pupy y Los que Son, Son) but eventually decided to relocate elsewhere (to Spain, Mexico, and New York).
Others include Carlos Manuel, El Pikete, Michel Calvo, Jorge Gomez and &quot;Tiempo Libre&quot; (who received Grammy nominations in 2005 for their album &quot;Arroz con Mango&quot; and in 2006 for their album &quot;Lo que esperabas&quot;), Los 10 de la Salsa, Chaka and his group &quot;El Tumbao&quot;, and Tomasito Cruz and his Cuban Timba All Stars.

In Peru, timba is also prominent with no fewer than 30 bands dedicated to promote Cuban music, the most well known of which are Mayimbe and Team Cuba. Others include: Mangu, Camagüey, A Conquistar, Explosión Habana, N&#x27;Samble, La Novel, D&#x27;Farándula, Bembe, Son de Timba, Los Trabucos, Yambú and Yare.
Also, Lima is hometown for Cuban musicians such as Dantes Cardosa and Michel Maza (former lead singer for Charanga Habanera) and Caroband.

==Stylistic aspects==

===Dance and culture===

===Harmony===

===Arranging===

===Rhythms===

Timba rhythm sections differ from their salsa counterparts in many integral ways from the instruments themselves, to the individual patterns of each instrument, to the way those patterns are combined into gears, to the way the group navigates between those gears. The areas where salsa and timba are most similar are the tempo range and the part of the largest bell, played by the bongosero in salsa and, depending on the band, by either the bongosero, timbalero or drummer in timba.

The bell played by the timbalero in salsa is sometimes played the same way by the timbalero or drummer in timba, but in timba bands where one person plays both bell patterns, a different pattern, or a much looser series of improvised patterns, is used.
The time-honored standard conga marcha used universally in salsa is also often used in timba, but many other variations are also used and some congueros actually compose specific marchas for each song. Many of these timba conga marchas are twice or even four times the length of the standard conga marcha (or tumbao).

Tomás Cruz developed several adaptions of folkloric rhythms when working in Paulito FG&#x27;s timba band of the 1990s. Cruz&#x27;s creations offered clever counterpoints to the bass and chorus. Many of his tumbaos span two or even four claves in duration, something very rarely done previously. He also made more use of muted tones in his tumbaos, all the while advancing the development of . The example on the right is one of Cruz&#x27;s &quot;inventos&quot; (&#x27;musical inventions&#x27;), a band adaptation of the Congolese-based Afro-Cuban folkloric rhythm &quot;makuta&quot;. He played the pattern on three congas on the Paulito song &quot;Llamada anónima.&quot; Listen: &quot;Llamada Anónima&quot; by Paulito F.G. 
A very dramatic difference between the two genres is that salsa bands don&#x27;t use the kick drum, an essential element in all timba bands. Almost all timba bands have a trap drummer and those with a timbalero (e.g., Charanga Habanera) add a kick drum which he or she plays from a standing position.

The role of the bassist is also very different. Salsa bassists have standardized bombo-ponche bass tumbaos. This is sometimes used in timba, but much more often a clave-aligned tumbao is used, and it is often specific to the song in question, while the bombo-ponche tumbaos of salsa, by definition, always use the same rhythm from song to song. Most importantly, timba bassists stop and start their tumbaos, one of the defining aspects of timba gears. In salsa, the bass tumbao is omnipresent.—Moore (2010: v. 5: 13).

===Clave schism===

A significant aspect of the rhythmic structure of timba is the tendency towards ignoring or intentionally breaking the basic tenets of arranging the music in-clave. This had led to a schism within the world of salsa and related Latin dance music.

Many salsa pianists are alarmed when they first study timba and encounter measures that either contradict the clave or fail to mark it decisively. It is an understandable concern, because when dealing with tumbaos whose rhythm patterns last only one clave, that rhythm either marks the clave or it doesn&#x27;t. However, when the rhythmic pattern lasts two or four claves, it gives the creative pianist the leeway to choose where, and how strongly, to mark the clave. If you mark the clave decisively every other measure, the listeners and dancers will learn to anticipate it.

As such, you can use clave polarity for artistic effect, creating tension with passages that leave the clave ambiguous or even contradict it, making the resolution to strong clave-alignment all the more satisfying when it comes&quot; (Moore 2010: 41).

===&quot;Gears&quot;===

When a band develops a specific combination of piano, bass and percussion parts, and returns to it multiple times in multiple songs, we call this a &quot;gear.&quot; It could be as simple as repeatedly using one groove for the cuerpos and another for the coros, or breaking down for the singer to talk to the crowd. Using this basic definition, we could say that all dance music has some sort of gear system, but the Cuban music of the 1990s took the concept to an unprecedented level of complexity and creativity. In fact, when answering the obligatory question &quot;what&#x27;s the difference between salsa and timba?&quot;, the most important part of the answer revolves around the subject of gears.

The Cuban bands of the 1990s came up with a much wider spectrum of gears than their predecessors, but more importantly, many of them devised visual, verbal and/or musical signals to enable them to apply the gear changes spontaneously in different ways for different performances of the same song, i.e., to improvise the form of the piece. For example, the singer or musical director might give a hand signal or cry out &quot;bomba!&quot;, after which the bassist would begin to slide his or her right hand down the low string of the bass in a distinctive pattern, with the percussionists simultaneously changing their patterns to a pre-determined combination that works with the bass to create the tembleque-inducing bomba groove. These &quot;gear changes&quot; can be written into arrangements or spontaneously invoked in live performance by hand or vocal signals.—Moore (2010: v. 5: 75)

====Breakdowns====
Breakdown gears set timba apart from other salsa. The following example is Calixto Oviedo&#x27;s funky drumset pattern for a type of high-energy breakdown known as &quot;presión&quot;. Watch: Calixto Oviedo play presión breakdown drumset pattern

===Compared to salsa===

Though quite similar to salsa on the surface of things due to origins from son heritage, timba has certain qualities of its own which distinguish it from salsa, similar to the way American R&amp;B is distinguished from soul. In general, timba is considered to be a highly aggressive type of music, with rhythm and &quot;swing&quot; taking precedence over melody and lyricism. Associated with timba is a radically sexual and provocative dance style known as despelote (literally meaning chaos or frenzy) that consists of rapid gyrations of the body and pelvis, thrusting and trembling motions, bending over and generating harmonic oscillations of the gluteous maximus. Those involved in the performance and popularization of timba crafted a culture of black, strong, masculine pride, and a narrative of male hypersexulaity to go with timba&#x27;s so-called &quot;masculine&quot; sound. In a socialist society where value and identity center on labor and political citizenship, black males were representing themselves not as forces of production but of pleasure. Timba is musically complex, highly danceable, and reflects the problems and contradictions of contemporary Cuban society because it expresses a repetitive beat that relates to the repetitive day-to-day life the Cubans endured during the early 1990s. It is a dynamic evolution of salsa, full of improvisation and Afro Cuban heritage, based on son, Rumba and mambo, taking inspiration from Latin jazz, and is highly percussive with complex sections. Very little &quot;traditional&quot; salsa existed (or exists) in Cuba, the most influential foreign &#x27;salsero&#x27; being Venezuelan Oscar D&#x27;León, who is one of the few salsa artists to have performed in Cuba. Timba musicians thus rightly claim a different musical heritage from salsa musicians.

At its most basic, timba is more flexible and innovative than salsa, and includes a more diverse range of styles, all of which could be defined as timba. The limits of what is timba and what is not are less rigid when compared to salsa, as innovation and improvisation are key concepts in Timba music. According to Juan Formell, director of Los Van Van, timba is not a form of traditional son, but something new. Timba incorporates heavy percussion and rhythms which originally came from the barrios of Cuba.

Timba incorporates many elements of Afro-Cuban culture and music. This includes various Afro Cuban rhythms (on all instruments), expressions or parts of lyrics in &#x27;Lucumí&#x27; (Cuban Yoruba, which were before used mostly in a religious context) and references to Afro-Cuban religion, the imperative for improvisation and interaction with audiences during concerts, story-telling in the lyrics, the quoting of melodies, rhythms and/or lyrics from other sources and sustained sections of coro-pregon (call and response) interaction in songs. Contrary to (early) salsa, timba makes no claim to social or political messages, partly because of the political circumstances in Cuba.

More specifically, timba differs from salsa in orchestration and arrangement. Some timba artists readily concede that they have occasionally taken inspiration from musical genres coming outside of Cuba. Thus, bands like La Charanga Habanera or Bamboleo often have horns or other instruments playing a few melodic notes from tunes by Earth, Wind and Fire, Kool and the Gang or other funk bands. In terms of instrumentation, the most important innovation has been the permanent incorporation of a drum kit and a synthesiser. Many timba bands have otherwise kept the traditional charanga ensemble of the 1940s, which includes double bass, conga, cowbell, clave, piano, violins, flute and in timba an expanded horn section that (in addition to the traditional trumpets and trombones) may include saxophones. However, many innovations were made in the style of playing and the arrangements, especially on the bass (sometimes taking inspiration from non Cuban genres of music), the piano (with elements of baroque music such as Bach), the horns (complex arrangements known as &quot;champolas&quot;), and the use of the clave (where 2-3 son clave is the standard in salsa music, timba often leans towards 2-3 rumba clave, 3:2 Son clave and 3:2 Rumba clave). Also different from salsa is the frequent shift from major to minor keys (and vice versa), the highly complex rhythmic arrangements (often based on santería or abakuá rhythms), the shifts in speed and the large number of orchestrated breaks, or &quot;bloques&quot;.
Also, owing to its many Afro Cuban origins (and, of course, to traditional Cuban music such as Son), Timba music is highly syncopated.

==Status==

Though timba is considered to be a form of popular music, the technical mastery of timba is only possible through highly trained musicians, who have solid theoretical backgrounds in classical music, jazz, traditional Cuban music, as well as other international genres. This is made possible through the high standards of government-run music schools in Cuba, as well as the strong competition between musicians.

Government policy favours artistic excellence and Cuban music is regarded as a source of revenue and a legitimate way to attract tourism. However, the island&#x27;s most popular dance bands have been virtually ignored by Latino radio in the US and some parts of Cuba, and are absent from the charts. However, pieces of Cuban sound are beginning to reach large audiences in the USA through musical recordings produced by popular musicians, such as Willy Chirino and Qbadisc, from New York City, Miami, and Puerto Rico who currently incorporate timba into their songs. New York and Puerto Rican musicians have further blended the double-hit bass drum in the breakdown in a more sophisticated way which does not exist in Cuba yet. Because of the available resources outside of Cuba, it is easier for musicians outside of the island to create music that has been heavily influenced by the Cubans. Meaning, it is easier for foreigners to imitate, create, and get their music out to the public more quickly because of the available technology.

Gonzalo Grau, La Timba Loca band leader, hopes timba will gain popularity in the States, but he realizes that only small crowds will come to shows at first. Because of the politics surrounding Cuba, the music has not had a chance to gain exposure in the States and has not become as commercialized as traditional salsa from other Latin countries. Nevertheless, many Cuban musicians seek to work abroad, and a significant number of musicians now work in exile, both in the United States and in Europe (and to a lesser extent in Latin America), leading to a new wave of cross-breeding between the timba and salsa. While timba has gone past its peak in recent years, all major groups are still actively recording and performing, and major labels—especially in Europe—have started taking an interest in timba.

Because timba is highly aggressive and a challenge to dance to some Cuban bands in search of a broader audience have intentionally made music that a majority of Latinos will find easy to dance to, mixing Latino staples such as salsa, merengue, and romantic ballads into the Cuban beat. By 1990, several bands had incorporated elements of funk and hip-hop into their arrangements, and expanded upon the instrumentation of the traditional conjunto with American drum set, saxophones and a two-keyboard format. Along with the Cuban congas and timbales, the drum set provided powerful funk and rock beats that added more punch to the rhythm section, and the bass players began to incorporate the playing techniques associated with funk, slapping, and pulling the strings in a percussive way. The combination of the trumpets and the saxes gave the horn section a more jazzed sound, and the harmony began to evolve on a more contemporary level.

Timba has start to become popular in the worldwide salsa scene today as commercial timba music selections are selectively accepted. However many salsa dancers consider it difficult to dance to, due to rapid rhythm and differential arrangements than traditional salsa and beats too strong to their ears, compounded by the strong Afro-Cubans rhythm heritage and the inability of many North American salsa dancers to listen to actual tempos. Nevertheless, it has found a niche among a growing number of fans and has been influential amongst Cuban-American and European salsa musicians. From the salsa dancer&#x27;s perspective, timba (due to its rhythmically complex nature) is very hard to dance unless traditional Cuban salsa (also known as casino) is mastered and may require many years of practice. In the same way that musicians amalgamate salsa with funk, pop, jazz, rock &amp; roll and even tango to create timba, dancing to timba reflects the rhythms/genre incorporated in the composition being danced to. Timba as a dance allows incorporation of moves seen in Afro-Cuban folklore, funk, pop, rock &amp; roll etc., and the creation of new moves under the framework of Cuban casino.

<text>Too Late the Hero is a 1970 American war film directed by Robert Aldrich and starring Michael Caine, Cliff Robertson, Ian Bannen and Harry Andrews.

==Plot==
In the 1942 Pacific theatre of World War II, Lieutenant Junior Grade Sam Lawson, USN, is a Japanese-language interpreter who — so far — has avoided combat. His commanding officer, Captain John G. Nolan, unexpectedly cancels his leave and informs Lawson that he is to be assigned to a British infantry commando unit in the New Hebrides Islands for a combat mission.

The British base is in the middle of a large open field, several hundred yards from the edge of the jungle; on the other side of the jungle is a Japanese observation and communications post. Shortly after Lawson&#x27;s arrival at the base, a patrol of British soldiers sprint out of the jungle and across the open field, pursued by the Japanese. The base commander, Col. Thompson, instructs his men to keep well back, out of enemy range; they watch as the patrol are cut down by Japanese rifle fire.

Lawson&#x27;s commando group is instructed to destroy the Japanese radio transmitter to prevent them from sounding the alarm about an American naval convoy which is scheduled to appear on the horizon in three days. The post&#x27;s radio operator transmits an &quot;all&#x27;s well&quot; signal every night at midnight; it will be Lawson&#x27;s job to transmit a fake signal (in Japanese) to buy the Allies another 24 hours.

The commando group is led by Captain Hornsby, an upper class officer with a history of foolhardiness. Other members of the squad are draftees from Singapore who lack enthusiasm for fighting: Pte. Tosh Hearne, a cynical Cockney who is also the squad&#x27;s medic; Pte. Jock Thornton, a lean Scot whom Lawson at first considers slightly cracked for skipping on patrol and singing the &quot;Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&quot;, Pte. Campbell, a wily Glaswegian; grey-haired Sergeant Johnstone; Signalman Scott the radio operator; Cpl. McLean and Privates Griffiths, Rogers, Currie and Riddle.

By the time the squad reaches the Japanese post, Riddle, Connolly, and Currie are dead from a botched ambush — which, Hearne mutters to Lawson, was entirely due to Hornsby&#x27;s incompetence. Positioned on both sides of the trail when firing on a Japanese patrol, the British apparently killed their fellow soldiers in friendly fire. When Johnstone is wounded in another encounter, Hornsby leaves him behind where he is shortly killed by Japanese.

After Scott drops and breaks the radio Lawson was to use, Hornsby decides to use the Japanese radio. Lawson refuses to take part in such a scheme, giving the excuse that Hornsby would be disobeying Thompson&#x27;s orders. Hornsby walks across the Japanese camp, entering the radio hut without being spotted by the tower guard. He knocks out the radio operator and motions to Lawson and Scott. Scott goes to the hut, but despite Hearne&#x27;s urgings, Lawson again refuses. The Japanese radio operator comes to and shoots Scott; in the ensuing fracas Hornsby is killed.

Lawson is now the ranking officer, with only Hearne, Campbell, Jock, Griffiths, and McLean left alive — and Jock has been wounded in the debacle. Japanese Major Yamaguchi is determined to stop them from reporting the existence of the secret Japanese airfield and planes they have discovered. Through loudspeakers in the trees, Yamaguchi exhorts the men to give themselves up. Lawson and Hearne agree that Yamaguchi is not to be trusted, but Campbell is in favour of surrender. While Lawson and Hearne are asleep, Campbell starts sneaking off, but Jock spots him and asks where he is going. Campbell strangles Jock, wakes Griffiths and McLean, and the three of them run off.

Yamaguchi uses the lives of Griffiths and McLean as bargaining chips, Campbell having been killed in gruesome fashion after the Japanese discover he&#x27;s taken personal items from a fellow officer the British patrol had killed. As Lawson and Hearne reach the edge of the open field adjacent to the British base, Yamaguchi announces that they have three minutes to surrender; Japanese soldiers have the field covered with rifles and machine guns. Hearne suggests they double back and kill Yamaguchi, leaving the Japanese without leadership.

After killing the Japanese major, Lawson and Hearne sprint out across the field in zig zag motion. Despite cover fire from the base, first one, then the other is hit. One of them rises and staggers to safety.

It is Hearne, who collapses in the field with yards to go. When Colonel Thompson asks who the other man was, Hearne replies, &quot;A hero. He killed fifteen Japs single-handed — thirty, if you like.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
Aldrich later said he first wrote the story in 1959 with Robert Sherman. That year, when he was making films in Europe, he said he was going to scout locations in Burma and wanted Laurence Olivier and Trevor Howard to play the leads.

In 1963, Aldrich was going to make a $14 million slate of eight feature films and one TV series for his production company, The Associates and Aldrich Company, using the success of &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot;, &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; and &quot;4 For Texas&quot; to raise finance. The film projects were &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; by Lukas Heller, &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot;, &quot;The Tsar&#x27;s Bride&quot; by Robert Sherman, &quot;Brouhaha&quot; by George Tabori, &quot;The Legend of Lylah Clare&quot;, &quot;Paper Eagle&quot;, &quot;There Really Was a Gold Mine&quot; (a sequel to &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;) and &quot;Genghis Khan&#x27;s Bicycle&quot;, with the TV series being &quot;The Man&quot; by Heller. Screenplays had also been completed on &quot;Now We Know&quot; by John O&#x27;Hara and Halstead Welles, &quot;Vengeance is Mine&quot;, &quot;Potluck for Pomeroy&quot; and &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot; by Robert Sherman.

Aldrich later said he did the original draft then had it rewritten by Lukas Heller, who &quot;made it a much better script&quot;. However, the film was not made until after Aldrich had a big success with &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;.

Robert Aldrich recalled that the production company ABC Films wanted another version of his &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, and that &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot;, a property that could use some of the same elements, had been languishing in studio drawers for over a decade. The idea of the film came from an unpublished novel called &quot;Don&#x27;t Die Mad&quot; by Robert Sherman, who had worked on several films with Aldrich.

Aldrich later reflected, &quot;When you&#x27;ve had a big, big success, people who should know better lose their perspective about your infallibility. Right away it&#x27;s &#x27;Let&#x27;s make another one!&#x27; Let&#x27;s go back and buy the first novel of some guy who, ten novels later, wrote a hit. That&#x27;s ludicrous. You may have better projects, but you can&#x27;t sell the better projects, you really can&#x27;t.&quot; Aldrich said the only other &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; he had in his drawer was &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot;. MGM wanted to make it but &quot;they wanted a budget of nine million seven to make it, which was too high&quot;. He ended up selling &quot;The Legend of Lylah Clare&quot; to MGM and setting up &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot; at ABC, where it was made for $6 million.

In October 1967, Aldrich announced he would make the film as part of a four-picture deal he had with Palomar ABC; the others being &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice?&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Mother of &#x27;em All&quot;. In November, Michael Caine signed to star.

In October 1968, Cliff Robertson signed to co-star. Aldrich said he wanted &quot;anyone but Cliff Robertson&quot; for the lead role, but he was overruled by the studio.

Denholm Elliott joined the cast shortly after Robertson.

===Historical accuracy===
The Japanese never were in the New Hebrides in World War II; the American forces arrived in May 1942.

The attitudes depicted in the World War II film, made during the Vietnam War era, reflected the 1960s, with one character talking about &quot;long haired conscientious objectors&quot;. The poster advertising the film showed a fallen soldier dressed in a 1960s American uniform and holding an M16 rifle.

===Shooting===
Filming started in February 1969.

The bulk of the film was made on Boracay Island in the Philippines, by the same crew and using many of the same sets as Jack Starrett&#x27;s &quot;The Losers&quot;. The opening and closing segments were filmed outside the Subic Bay Naval Base using sailors and American civilians as extras.

During filming, Robertson found out he won the Best Actor Oscar for &quot;Charly&quot;. He had not insisted contractually that he could return for the Oscar ceremony, so Frank Sinatra accepted it for him. &quot;There was no flap&quot;, he said later. &quot;If the absence was anybody&#x27;s fault it was my own.&quot; He complained a year later that it would have taken only two days out of the production schedule, and that he had offered to pay production costs but was refused as &quot;a matter of ego&quot;.

It was requested that Aldrich film two separate endings for the American and British audiences, one with Robertson surviving.

Filming finished by April 1969. Relations between Aldrich and Robertson deteriorated so much that Aldrich reportedly left the film early, leaving Oscar Rudolph to finish it. However, in June 1969, Aldrich attended a presentation at Aldrich&#x27;s studios in Los Angeles, where a plaque in Robertson&#x27;s name was unveiled.

Aldrich later said if Robertson&#x27;s character had been played &quot;as I wanted it&quot;, his character &quot;would have won, even though he is killed and Michael Caine lives&quot;.

Shortly after filming, Robertson optioned the rights to &quot;Death of a Legend&quot;, the story of Blanche Walker Jurika, executed for fighting the Japanese in World War II. He optioned them from Michael Parsons, who was in the cast. Parsons was arrested for possession of hashish in May 1969.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 62%, based on 13 retrospectively collected reviews with an average rating of 6/10.

Roger Greenspun of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Although committed to the notion that war is an inclusive system of betrayals, the film subverts that notion and settles instead for some fashionable ironies and remarkably conventional jungle war displays.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an okay World War II melodrama ... the net result is not very much at all, except for a pervading load of bland competence, under the overall supervision of auteur Aldrich.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film one star out of four and wrote, &quot;The essence of an action film is action, and that&#x27;s precisely what&#x27;s missing in Robert Aldrich&#x27;s &#x27;Too Late the Hero.&#x27; Oddly enough, Aldrich, who directed &#x27;The Dirty Dozen,&#x27; substitutes boredom in the form of an annoyingly long prolog, repititious scenes, and combat in a closed space.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a war movie at its most routine. Indeed, it&#x27;s depressing to consider how much effort and expense were expended with so little to show for it.&quot;

===Box office===
The film earned rentals of $615,000 in North America and $975,000 in other countries (it had admissions of 294,232 in France). The film was one of the most popular movies in 1971 at the British box office.

After all costs were deducted, the film had an overall loss of $6,765,000, making it one of the biggest money losers in the history of ABC Films.

Aldrich said in 1972 that because the film &quot;was less than successful, so now all our properties are scrutinized at a whole other level. It can get terribly sad, but it&#x27;s true that your opinion is only as good as your last picture.&quot;

Along with his other movies, &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; and &quot;The Grissom Gang&quot;, Aldrich &quot;never understood&quot; &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot;&#x27;s lack of success. He thought they were &quot;marvelous movies&quot;.

==Home media==
&quot;Too Late the Hero&quot; was released to DVD by MGM Home Video on May 25, 2004 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD.

==Novelizations==
Owing to a geographical separation of rights, &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot; is one of those films with the odd distinction of having been novelized twice for two different marketplaces. The more straight-ahead (and longer) adaptation was written by William Hughes (official byline of Hugh Williams, not to be confused with the actor) and published in the UK by Sphere Books. The US novelization, written entirely from Sam&#x27;s POV almost like a stream-of-consciousness tour de force, was written by Con Sellers for Pyramid Books.

<doc id="969975" wikidata="Q3039121" url="?curid=969975" title="Drapery">
<text>Drapery is a general word referring to cloths or textiles (Old French , from Late Latin ). It may refer to cloth used for decorative purposes – such as around windows – or to the trade of retailing cloth, originally mostly for clothing, formerly conducted by drapers.

== Drape ==
Drape (draping or fabric drape) is the property of different textile materials describing how they fold, fall, or hang over a three-dimensional body. Draping depends upon the fiber characteristics and the flexibility, looseness, and softness of the material. Draped garments follow the form of the human body beneath them.

== Art ==

In art history, drapery refers to any cloth or textile depicted, which is usually clothing. The schematic depiction of the folds and woven patterns of loose-hanging clothing on the human form, with ancient prototypes, was reimagined as an adjunct to the female form by Greek vase-painters and sculptors of the earliest fifth century and has remained a major source of stylistic formulas in sculpture and painting, even after the Renaissance adoption of tighter-fitting clothing styles. After the Renaissance, large cloths with no very obvious purpose are often used decoratively, especially in portraits in the grand manner; these are also known as draperies.

For the Greeks, as Kenneth Clark noted, clinging drapery followed the planes and contours of the bodily form, emphasizing its twist and stretch: &quot;floating drapery makes visible the line of movement through which it has just passed... Drapery, by suggesting lines of force, indicates for each action a past and a possible future.&quot; Clark contrasted the formalized draperies in the frieze at Olympia with the sculptural frieze figures of the Parthenon, where &quot;it has attained a freedom and an expressive power that have never been equalled except by Leonardo da Vinci&quot;. Undraped male figures, Clark observed, &quot;were kept in motion by their flying cloaks.&quot;

In 18th century England, many of the leading portrait painters with a large workshop engaged the services of drapery painters, who were specialists who painted the dress, costumes and other accessories worn by the sitters in portrait paintings. While the portraitist completed the face and hands, the drapery painter was responsible for the pose and costume. These specialists were not necessarily assistants in the workshop of the portrait painters but rather subcontractors. The Flemish painter Joseph van Aken was the leading drapery painter in 18th century England working for most portrait artists and as a consequence many of the works of English portrait artists of that period are often difficult to distinguish one from another.
== Interior design ==
In interior design, drapery refers almost exclusively to window treatments. It is often used as a focal point alongside the windows or as a way to help block sun/glare. There is general agreement that drapery in design is more substantial and weightier than other window treatments, such as curtain paneling. Drapes are also normally lined, whereas curtain panels normally are not. You can have drapery that is sheer, light filtering, room darkening or blackout; so they can be used in almost every room of the house if desired. Drapery is also considered a relatively permanent installation, adding an integral element to the room&#x27;s design by adding color or pattern to complement the rest of the architectural and soft elements.

<text>Gregory Dewar, (born January 9, 1956) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He is a former member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba.

Dewar was born in Selkirk, Manitoba, the grandson of former mayor Ben Massey. He was educated at the University of Winnipeg, and worked as a steelworker and as a small businessman prior to entering political life. Dewar served as treasurer of the Selkirk local of the Manitoba Metis Federation, and was a founding director of the Maurepas Village Housing Cooperative. He was also involved in the Selkirk Restitution and Reconciliation Committee, a program which assists young offenders.

Dewar was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1990, running as a New Democrat in the riding of Selkirk. He received 3735 votes, against 3467 for Progressive Conservative Russ Farrell (incumbent Liberal Gwen Charles was third with 3009). Dewar was re-elected by a wider margin in the 1995 election, and by a comfortable margin in 1999. The NDP formed government following the 1999 election, and Dewar was appointed Government Whip.

Dewar supported Lorne Nystrom&#x27;s bid to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party in 1995. In 2003, he supported Bill Blaikie.

Dewar was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 2003, receiving more than 60% of the vote in his riding.

He was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election and in the 2011 provincial election. Dewar was the legislative assistant to the Minister of Finance. He resumed the role of Government Whip following the 2011 election and held that position until 2014.

On November 3, 2014, Dewar was appointed as Minister of Finance after then-Minister Jennifer Howard, along with four other ministers, resigned from cabinet over concerns about Premier Selinger&#x27;s leadership.

<doc id="970007" wikidata="Q29482" url="?curid=970007" title="WordPad">
<text>WordPad is a word processor software designed by Microsoft that was included in versions of Windows from Windows 95 through Windows 11, version 23H2. Similarly to its predecessor Microsoft Write, it served as a basic word processor, positioned as more advanced than the Notepad text editor by supporting rich text editing, but with a subset of the functionality of Microsoft Word. Microsoft removed WordPad in Windows 11 24H2 and it has no successor. 

Earlier versions primarily supported a subset of the Rich Text Format (RTF, .rtf) and Microsoft Word 6.0 formats, although later versions are also capable of saving Office Open XML (OOXML, .docx) and OpenDocument Text (.odt) files.

==Features==

WordPad can format and print text, including font and bold, italic, colored, and centered text, and lacks functions such as a spell checker, thesaurus, and control of pagination. It does not support footnotes and endnotes. WordPad can read, render, and save many Rich Text Format (RTF) features that it cannot create, such as tables, strikeout, superscript, subscript, &quot;extra&quot; colors, text background colors, numbered lists, right and left indentation, quasi-hypertext and URL linking, and line-spacing greater than 1. It is simpler and faster than a richly-featured word processor, with low system resource use. Pasting into WordPad from an HTML document, such as a Web page or email, typically automatically converts most or all of it to RTF, depending partly on the Web browser from which the text is copied. WordPad is suited to taking notes; writing letters and stories; and use on various tablets, PCs, and smart phones. It is unsuitable for work that relies heavily on graphics and typesetting, such as most publishing-industry requirements for rendering final hard copy.

A character not on the keyboard can be entered into WordPad by typing its hexadecimal code point in Unicode followed by . Likewise, the code point of a character from another application can be determined by copying it into WordPad followed by .

WordPad does not support all the features defined in the RTF/Word 2007 specification. Earlier versions of WordPad also supported the &quot;Word for Windows 6.0&quot; format, which is forward compatible with the Microsoft Word format.

In Windows 95, 98, and 2000, WordPad uses Microsoft&#x27;s RichEdit control, versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, respectively. In Windows XP SP1 and later, and Windows 7, it uses RichEdit 4.1.

A similar word processor, also called WordPad and with simple functionality, is supplied by some vendors on a Windows CE pre-installation. Its icon resembles an early Microsoft Word icon.

==History==
WordPad was introduced in Windows 95, replacing Microsoft Write, included with all previous versions of Windows (version 3.11 and earlier). The source code to WordPad was also distributed by Microsoft as a Microsoft Foundation Class Library sample application with MFC 3.2 and later, shortly before the release of Windows 95. It is still available for download from the MSDN website.

The default font used in Windows 95 to Windows Vista was 10pt Arial; in Windows 7 it was changed to 11pt Calibri.

WordPad for Windows 2000/XP added full Unicode support, enabling WordPad to support multiple languages, but big endian UTF-16/UCS-2 is not supported. It can open Microsoft Word (versions 6.0–2003) files, although it opens newer versions of the .doc format with incorrect formatting. Also, unlike previous WordPad versions, it cannot save files in the .doc format (only .txt and .rtf). Files saved as Unicode text are encoded as UTF-16 LE. As a security measure Windows XP Service Pack 2 and later versions of Windows and its service packs reduced support for opening .WRI.

Windows 10 and later versions support voice typing. Windows XP Tablet PC Edition SP2 and Windows Vista include speech recognition, allowing dictation into WordPad. These and later Windows versions implement the RichEdit control, allowing WordPad to support extensible third-party services built using the &quot;Text Services Framework&quot; (TSF), such as grammar and spellcheck.

In Windows Vista support for reading Microsoft Word DOC files was removed because of the incorrect rendering and formatting problems, and because a Microsoft security bulletin reported a security vulnerability in opening Word files in WordPad. For viewing older (Word 97–2003), and Office Open XML, documents, Microsoft recommends free-of-charge Microsoft Word Viewer. Native Office Open XML and ODF 1.1 support was implemented in the Windows 7 version of WordPad.

In Windows 7 the program&#x27;s user interface was updated to use a ribbon, similar to those in Microsoft Office.

In January 2020, a Windows Insider build of Windows 10 tested an advertisement steering WordPad users to Office web apps.

=== Discontinuation ===
In September 2023, Microsoft announced that WordPad will be removed from &quot;a future release of Windows&quot;, recommending Notepad and Microsoft Word. In January 2024, WordPad was no longer auto-installed after a clean installation of the OS with the release of the Windows 11 Build 26020 Insider Preview’s Canary Channel. Furthermore, Microsoft stated that WordPad will be officially removed in future updates, and it will not be available for reinstallation. Microsoft recommended using Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf, while Windows Notepad is suggested for plain text documents like .txt.

<doc id="970009" wikidata="Q1248812" url="?curid=970009" title="Helen (play)">
<text>Helen (, &quot;Helénē&quot;) is a drama by Euripides about Helen, first produced in 412 BC for the Dionysia in a trilogy that also contained Euripides&#x27; lost &quot;Andromeda&quot;. The play has much in common with &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot;, which is believed to have been performed around the same time period.

==Historical frame==
&quot;Helen&quot; was written soon after the Sicilian Expedition, in which Athens had suffered a massive defeat. Concurrently, the sophists – a movement of teachers who incorporated philosophy and rhetoric into their occupation – were beginning to question traditional values and religious beliefs. Within the play&#x27;s framework, Euripides starkly condemns war, deeming it to be the root of all evil.

==Background==

About thirty years before this play, Herodotus argued in his &quot;Histories&quot; that Helen had never in fact arrived at Troy, but was in Egypt during the entire Trojan War. The Archaic lyric poet Stesichorus had made the same assertion in his &quot;Palinode&quot; (itself a correction to an earlier poem corroborating the traditional characterization that made Helen out to be a woman of ill repute). The play &quot;Helen&quot; tells a variant of this story, beginning under the premise that rather than running off to Troy with Paris, Helen was actually whisked away to Egypt by the gods. The Helen who escaped with Paris, betraying her husband and her country and initiating the ten-year conflict, was actually an eidolon, a phantom look-alike. After Paris was promised the most beautiful woman in the world by Aphrodite and he judged her fairer than her fellow goddesses Athena and Hera, Hera ordered Hermes to replace Helen, Paris&#x27; assumed prize, with a fake. Thus, the real Helen has been languishing in Egypt for years, while the Greeks and Trojans alike curse her for her supposed infidelity.

In Egypt, king Proteus, who had protected Helen, has died. His son Theoclymenus, the new king with a penchant for killing Greeks, intends to marry Helen, who after all these years remains loyal to her husband Menelaus.

==Plot==

Helen receives word from the exiled Greek Teucer that Menelaus never returned to Greece from Troy, and is presumed dead, putting her in the perilous position of being available for Theoclymenus to marry, and she consults the prophetess Theonoe, sister to Theoclymenus, to find out Menelaus&#x27; fate.

Her fears are allayed when a stranger arrives in Egypt and turns out to be Menelaus himself, and the long-separated couple recognize each other. At first, Menelaus does not believe that she is the real Helen, since he has hidden the Helen he won in Troy in a cave. However, the woman he was shipwrecked with was in reality, only a mere phantom of the real Helen. Before the Trojan war even began, a judgement took place, one that Paris was involved in. He gave the Goddess Aphrodite the award of the fairest since she bribed him with Helen as a bride. To take their revenge on Paris, the remaining goddesses, Athena and Hera, replaced the real Helen with a phantom. However, Menelaus did not know better. But luckily one of his sailors steps in to inform him that the false Helen has disappeared into thin air.

The couple still must figure out how to escape from Egypt, but the rumor that Menelaus has died is still in circulation. Thus, Helen tells Theoclymenus that the stranger who came ashore was a messenger there to tell her that her husband was truly dead. She informs the king that she may marry him as soon as she has performed a ritual burial at sea, thus freeing her symbolically from her first wedding vows. The king agrees to this, and Helen and Menelaus use this opportunity to escape on the boat given to them for the ceremony.

Theoclymenus is furious when he learns of the trick and nearly murders his sister Theonoe for not telling him that Menelaus is still alive. However, he is prevented by the miraculous intervention of the demi-gods Castor and Polydeuces, brothers of Helen and the sons of Zeus and Leda.

==Themes==

Virtue and Oaths: In &quot;Helen&quot;, Euripides emphasizes the importance of virtue and oaths. Awaiting the return of her husband Menelaus for 17 years — the ten of the Trojan War and another seven for the search — Helen remains faithful to Menelaus and the promises she has made him: Helen made two oaths, one to the Spartan river Eurotas and another on the head of Menelaus himself as sanctifying object. Menelaus also swears fidelity to Helen: so seriously do husband and wife take their vows that they agree to commit suicide and never marry another if their plans fail. Such importance to oath-keeping is consonant with general practice during the time period (Torrance, 2009). With these oaths, Helen and Menelaus declare their love for each other and their desire to live only with the other. These oaths prove their devotion and exemplify the importance of oaths. Given the play’s humor and Euripides’ general challenging of norms and values, it remains uncertain what our playwright’s own views are.

Identity and Reputation: Throughout all the different permutations of the story of Helen and the Trojan War, what makes the Trojan war distinctive is the fact that it is always caused, somehow, by Helen as the supreme embodiment of female beauty, whether she is or is not physically in Troy and whether she acts as an enthusiastic partner of Paris or as a reluctant victim of his unwanted rape. Euripides expands more on this idea by presenting his play largely from Helen’s point of view, revealing how she truly feels about being the symbolic villain of the Trojan War. Helen’s character in the play is deeply affected by the losses of the people who have died fighting to bring her back to her homeland and husband and expresses this guilt frequently: “The wrecked city of Ilium / is given up to the teeth of fire, / all through me and the deaths I caused, / all for my name of affliction” (lines 196-198). Despite this guilt, she also feels anger for being made into a symbol that people can project their hate on, even though they do not know her: “I have done nothing wrong and yet my reputation / is bad, and worse than a true evil is it to bear / the burden of faults that are not truly yours” (lines 270-272). Although she spends a lot of the beginning of the play feeling pity for the men who have died and herself as well, Euripides’ Helen is independent, confident, and intelligent. She displays her ability to think on her feet as she formulates a workable plan to return home and as she rejects her husband Menelaus’ cockamamy plans. Therefore, Euripides in his play portrays a living and breathing Helen filled with compassion and wit, not at all similar to the blameworthy person others believe her to be.

<text>Emily Erin Deschanel (; born October 11, 1976) is an American actress. She played Dr. Temperance &quot;Bones&quot; Brennan in the Fox crime procedural series &quot;Bones&quot; (2005–2017).

==Early life and education==
Emily Erin Deschanel was born in Los Angeles, California, to cinematographer and director Caleb Deschanel and actress Mary Jo Deschanel (née Weir). Her younger sister is actress and singer-songwriter Zooey Deschanel. Her paternal grandfather was French, from Oullins, Rhône; her roots also include Swiss, Dutch, English, Irish, and other French ancestry.

Deschanel attended Harvard-Westlake School and Crossroads School in Los Angeles.

==Career==

In 1994, Deschanel made her feature film debut in the romantic comedy-drama &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot;, on which her father worked as chief cinematographer. Her next notable role was as Pam Asbury in Stephen King&#x27;s horror miniseries &quot;Rose Red&quot; in 2002. Then she appeared in &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, &quot;The Alamo&quot;, and &quot;Glory Road&quot; and was named one of &quot;six actresses to watch&quot; by &quot;Interview Magazine&quot; in 2004.

In 2005, Deschanel was cast as Dr. Temperance Brennan on the Fox crime procedural comedy-drama &quot;Bones&quot;, based on the novels and the career of forensic anthropologist and author Kathy Reichs, created by Hart Hanson. The series ran for 12 seasons from September 13, 2005, to March 28, 2017. For her performance, she received a 2006 Satellite Award nomination and a 2007 Teen Choice Award nomination. Deschanel and co-star David Boreanaz served as co-producers at the start of the show&#x27;s third season, before becoming producers in the middle of the show&#x27;s fourth season. While &quot;Bones&quot; was still in production, Deschanel also played the Brennan character on a 2015 episode of &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; and a 2016 episode of &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;.

Deschanel, with Alyson Hannigan, Jaime King, Minka Kelly, and Katharine McPhee made a video slumber party featured on FunnyorDie.com to promote regular breast cancer screenings for the organization Stand Up 2 Cancer. In recent years, her passion for animal welfare has led her to providing the narration for &quot;My Child Is a Monkey&quot; and serving as an associate producer on the documentary film &quot;How I Became an Elephant&quot;. Deschanel ranked number 72 in The 2012 Hot 100 on AfterEllen.

Deschanel starred in the 2022 Netflix miniseries &quot;Devil in Ohio&quot;.

==Activism==
Deschanel is a vegan and a supporter of animal rights causes. She has said she went vegan after watching the film &quot;Diet for a New America&quot;. She can be seen in an &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; video at the book launch event of Karen Dawn&#x27;s &quot;Thanking the Monkey: Rethinking the Way We Treat Animals&quot;, discussing her belief that vegetarian and vegan diets help the environment, and a video on the homepage of the book&#x27;s website talking about the importance of animal rights. She collaborated with PETA on a video encouraging mothers to raise their children as vegans. In September 2014, she joined the board of directors at Farm Sanctuary.

==Personal life==
Deschanel was raised Roman Catholic but is no longer practicing and has expressed agnostic views, saying &quot;I am more of a spiritual person, if anything, and I am of the belief that we don&#x27;t know, and I&#x27;m not going to pretend that I do.&quot;

On September 25, 2010, Deschanel married &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; actor and writer David Hornsby in a small private ceremony in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. On September 21, 2011, Deschanel gave birth to their first son. On June 8, 2015, she gave birth to their second son.

In 2015, Deschanel filed suit against Fox alongside Boreanaz, Reichs and &quot;Bones&quot; executive producer Barry Josephson, claiming they were cheated out of their share of series profits. In February 2019, an arbitrator awarded them $179 million: $128 million in punitive damages, $32 million in compensatory damages, $10 million in prejudgment interest and more than $9 million in fees and costs. In May 2019, the Los Angeles Superior Court voided the punitive damages, with the plaintiffs&#x27; attorneys saying they would appeal. In September 2019, the parties came to an undisclosed settlement.

In January 2025, both Emily and Zooey Deschanel&#x27;s childhood homes were destroyed in Pacific Palisades due to the events of the January 2025 Southern California wildfires and the Palisades Fire.

<doc id="970013" wikidata="Q378800" url="?curid=970013" title="Jean Clouet">
<text>Jean (or Janet or Jehannot) Clouet (c. 1485 – 1540/1) was a painter, draughtsman and miniaturist from the Burgundian Netherlands whose known active work period took place in France. He was court painter to French king Francis I. Together with his son François Clouet he is counted among the leading 16th century portrait painters working in France. They are particularly known for their accomplished drawings, using black chalk and pure red chalk.

==Biography==
Little is known about the early life of Clouet. Art historians have generally assumed that he was a native of the Burgundian Netherlands, either in French speaking Valenciennes, County of Hainaut or Flemish speaking Brussels, Duchy of Brabant. He may have been the Jehan Cloet from Brussels mentioned in the accounts of the Duke of Burgundy. His father may have been Michel Clauwet or Clauet, a painter from Valenciennes who had settled in Brussels. In a document regarding the succession of his uncle, the painter Simon Marmion, dated 6 May 1499, Michel&#x27;s two minor children, Janet and Polet, are mentioned, but there is no evidence that this Janet Clauwet was indeed Jean Clouet. Born around 1485 and trained in Flanders, Clouet spent most of his career in France.
His connection with the Paris court of the French King Francis I is attested in the court accounts from 1516 until 1537. Originally he was appointed as painter and wardrobe valet at wages of 180 livres tournois. He was promoted to extraordinary valet in 1519 and finally to the new position of painter and gentleman in 1524. In 1522, on the death of the court painter Jean Bourdichon his wages were increased to 240 livres, equal to those received by the official portrait painter Jean Perréal. Perréal&#x27;s departure in 1527 made Clouet the highest paid ordinary painter, confirming his status as the almost exclusive creator of portraits for the royal family and the court. His title of master painter, likely received in Flanders, also allowed him to work for private patrons, such as the notary of the King Jacques Thiboust, whose portrait he painted in 1516, and his uncle by marriage Pierre Fichepain, who commissioned a &quot;Saint Jerome&quot; from him in 1522.

He lived in the 1520s in Tours, where he met and married his wife Jeanne Boucault, who was the daughter of a goldsmith. The couple had two children, François who would succeed him as a court painter, and Catherine. Catherine married Abel Foullon. Their son Benjamin Foullon (or Foulon) also became a portrait painter and miniaturist. The painter Simon Bélot worked in Jean&#x27;s workshop in Tours. At the end of the 1520s, the family moved to Paris, where they lived in the rue Sainte-Avoye. From 1540, Clouet, perhaps ill, was replaced in the king&#x27;s service by his son François. In July 1540, he was godfather to a child of Mathurin Régnier. He died shortly afterwards, in late 1540 or early 1541, and was buried in the Holy Innocents&#x27; Cemetery. An act in the Trésor des Chartes, the ancient archives of the French crown, states that Clouet&#x27;s son Jean would succeed his father as painter and valet from November 1541 and that Jean Clouet was born outside France and never became a naturalized Frenchman. The act also allows François to inherit his father&#x27;s estate, which otherwise under French law would have escheated to the French crown as Jean was a foreigner.
His brother Paul, known as Clouet de Navarre, was in the service of Marguerite d&#x27;Angoulême, sister of Francis I, and is referred to in a letter written by Marguerite about 1529.
==Work==
Jean Clouet was undoubtedly a very skillful portrait painter, although no work in existence has been proved to be his. About 10 to 15 portrait paintings are currently attributed to him and fewer miniatures, like two portrait of Francis I and two smaller ones by his workshop in the Louvre, that of un unknown man at Hampton Court, that of the Dauphin Francis, son of Francis I at Antwerp.He painted in 1530 a portrait of the mathematician Oronce Finé, at the age of 36. This portrait is now known only through a print.

Clouet is generally believed be the author of a very large number of the 130 portrait drawings now preserved at Musée Condé in Chantilly as well as other drawings at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.

=== Drawings and miniatures ===

Seven miniature portraits in the &quot;Manuscript of the Gallic War&quot; in the Bibliothèque Nationale (13,429) are attributed to Jean Clouet with very strong probability, and to these may be added an eighth in the collection of J. Pierpont Morgan, and representing Charles I de Cossé, Maréchal de Brissac, identical in its characteristics with the seven already known. There are other miniatures in the collection of Mr Morgan, which may be attributed to Jean Clouet with some strong degree of probability, inasmuch as they closely resemble the portrait drawings at Chantilly and in Paris which are taken to be his work.

The collection of drawings preserved in France, and attributed to this artist and his school, comprises portraits of all the important persons of the time of Francis I. In one album of drawings the portraits are annotated by the king himself, and his merry reflections, stinging taunts or biting satires, add very largely to a proper understanding of the life of his time and court. Definite evidence, however, is still lacking to establish the attribution of the best of these drawings and of certain oil paintings to Jean Clouet.

<text>Andrew James Swan (born August 9, 1968) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 2004 to 2019. He was first elected in a 2004 by-election, replacing MaryAnn Mihychuk, who resigned to run for Mayor of Winnipeg.

Swan graduated from the University of Manitoba faculty of law in 1990. After graduating, he practised law at the firm of Thompson Dorfman Sweatman, becoming a partner in 2000. His specialty was family law. Swan was appointed to the Residential Tenancies Commission in 2000, and is also a member of the Manitoba Running Association.

Swan first ran for the Manitoba legislature as a New Democrat in the 1990 provincial election, placing third in the west-end Winnipeg riding of Sturgeon Creek. Gerry McAlpine of the Progressive Conservatives won, while incumbent Liberal MLA Iva Yeo came second. Swan did not seek political office again until 2004.

On June 22, 2004, Swan was elected as a New Democrat for the riding of Minto, defeating his next closest competitor, Liberal Wayne Helgason, by 2,848 votes to 1,616. He was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election. He was appointed to Premier Gary Doer&#x27;s cabinet on February 4, 2008, as Minister of Competitiveness, Training and Trade, Minister charged with the administration of the Liquor Control Act, and Minister charged with the administration of The Manitoba Lotteries Corporation Act.

On September 2, 2009, after Doer resigned from the Assembly to become Ambassador to the United States, Swan resigned his cabinet position and announced his candidacy for the leadership of the NDP. His cabinet colleagues Steve Ashton and Greg Selinger also announced they would seek the leadership. Nancy Allan replaced Swan as interim Minister of Competitiveness, Training and Trade. The leadership convention took place on October 17, 2009. On September 28, Swan dropped out of the leadership race and endorsed Selinger. He regained his ministerial positions on October 5, 2009.

After winning the leadership race, Selinger appointed Swan as Minister of Justice and Attorney General on November 3. He was re-elected in 2011.

Swan resigned his cabinet position on November 3, 2014, along with Jennifer Howard, Theresa Oswald, Erin Selby and Stan Struthers, due to concerns about Premier Selinger&#x27;s leadership. He remained an NDP MLA after resignation. Despite a collapse in NDP support for the 2016 election, he retained his seat by a comfortable margin.

On January 20, 2019, Swan announced he would seek the federal NDP nomination in the riding of Winnipeg Centre in the 2019 Canadian federal election. He lost the nomination to community activist Leah Gazan, who went on to become the MP for Winnipeg Centre. He did not seek re-election in the snap 2019 Manitoba general election, at which the 2018 electoral redistribution, which eliminated Minto, took effect.

<doc id="970018" wikidata="Q3043052" url="?curid=970018" title="Star Ocean (video game)">
<text>is a 1996 action role-playing game developed by tri-Ace and published by Enix for the Super Famicom. The first game in the &quot;Star Ocean&quot; series, it was released only in Japan in July 1996, and was the first game developed by tri-Ace, consisting of staff that had previously left Wolf Team due to being unhappy with the development process for &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; with Namco in 1995. The game used a special compression chip in its cartridge to compress and store all of the game&#x27;s data due to possessing graphics that pushed the limits of the Super Famicom. Additionally, the game had voice acting for the game&#x27;s intro and voice clips that played during the game&#x27;s battle gameplay, a rarity for games on the system.

The story involves three friends who, while searching for the cure to a new disease, come into contact with a space-faring federation that is locked in a war with another galactic power. Using advanced technologies and time travel, the group attempts to uncover the cause of the war and to find a cure for their planet. The Super Famicom version was never released outside Japan due to Enix closing its American branch shortly before the game was finished, as well as Nintendo&#x27;s focus on supporting the then-upcoming Nintendo 64 video game console. The game was later remade by Tose for the PlayStation Portable under the title and released in English-speaking regions in North America, Europe, and Australia in October 2008. A remastered version titled was released for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 worldwide in December 2019. The game was the start of the entire &quot;Star Ocean&quot; series, featuring six main games, 3 spin-offs, a remake, a remaster, and a manga.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Star Ocean&quot; is a role-playing video game that is played from a top-down perspective. The player navigates a character throughout the game world, exploring towns and dungeons and interacting with non-player characters. Unlike the original game, the PlayStation Portable remake includes a world map for the player to navigate.

===Party===
In progressing through the game, the player is able to recruit up to eight additional characters to travel alongside the protagonist; some recruitments happen automatically, while others only happen depending on the previous actions and options taken by the player. Though only 8 characters can be recruited in a playthrough, ten characters are available to be recruited, and as a result not all characters can be recruited in one playthrough of the game. Certain characters cannot be recruited unless the player&#x27;s party is a specific size, or the player has made specific story decisions. In &quot;First Departure&quot;, players have the option of recruiting characters they did not previously have the option of adding to their party.

===Battle===

When players move their party in the game&#x27;s dungeons and paths, random battles occur. Combat is done in a 3D isometric point of view. Unlike games in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series, the battles are not turn based, but play out in real time. Players also do not directly control all of their characters&#x27; actions, but instead chose battle strategies beforehand for all but one of their characters who then move and attack their closest enemy automatically. Added to &quot;First Departure&quot; was a combo attack system where special attacks stack to become more powerful. Players can equip characters with four special abilities with &quot;ranged&quot; and &quot;distance&quot; slots, whereas the remake reduced that number to two. Up to four characters can participate in battles, but the player is only able to control one character at a time, leaving the others to be controlled by the computer&#x27;s artificial intelligence. The player can switch which character is being controlled in battle. All characters have a standard &quot;attack&quot; option, in which the character&#x27;s equipped item is used to attack whichever enemy the player has locked on to. Additionally, special techniques called Symbology can be used as well, which have the potential to deal more damage, but cost MP (Mental Points), of which each character has a finite amount. Special attacks are assigned before combat begins.

===Customization===
Special Points (abbreviated &quot;SP&quot; in game) are also rewarded from battles, and are used to customize the character&#x27;s abilities. For instance, allotting SP to the cooking ability grants or improves a given character&#x27;s ability to make consumable foods out of raw materials in order to heal characters from damage taken in battles. Item creation can allow for characters to be able to create weapons and equipment that are stronger than those available to be bought in stores and towns. Individual items have a 20 item limit.

===Affection system===
&quot;Star Ocean&quot; has a game mechanic called &quot;Private Actions&quot; that plays a role in character development. While entirely optional, they often reveal additional backstory of particular characters or have other varying effects on gameplay. Upon arriving in a town, the player can opt to have all the characters in the party to temporarily split up and go their separate ways within the limitations of the town. The player retains control of just Roddick (Ratix in the original Super Famicom game), and is able to look for the other characters. Upon finding other party members, various events may happen; sometimes only small talk results, other times, larger events happen, that may even require a choice to be made by the player. Depending on the results, this can cause characters to either gain or lose &quot;affinity&quot; toward other characters in the party. For example, if one character loves another, the affinity level will be high, but if the former is mistreated, it will lower their feelings for the latter. A character&#x27;s affinity towards one another can have effects on the rest of the game. Affinity also affect which character&#x27;s endings players see. While the game&#x27;s overarching plot always largely ends the same, various parts of the ending are changed, added, or left out, depending on characters&#x27; affinity at the end of the game.

==Synopsis==
===Plot===
The game takes place in S.D 346 (A.D 2432), and starts off in a small town of Kratus on the under-developed planet of Roak. There, a few of the local Fellpool (cat-like people) youth, Roddick, Millie, and Dorne, are part of the village&#x27;s local &quot;Defense Force&quot;, who defend the village from minor threats such as thieves and robbers. One day, however, a neighboring town, Coule, starts contracting a terrible disease that turns people into stone. The town healer, Millie&#x27;s father, contracts the disease while trying to get rid of it, leading the group to search Mt. Metorx for a herb that is rumored to cure any sickness. Dorne unintentionally contracts the disease as well after touching an infected pigeon.

When they reach the summit, they are confronted by Ronyx J. Kenny and Ilia Silvestri, two crew members of the Earth Federation (Terran Alliance in the PSP remake) starship &quot;Calnus&quot;. They inform them that the disease was sent to the planet by a foreign race called the Lezonians, whom the Earth Federation has been at war with. Roddick and Millie go with them on their spacecraft to help them find a cure. They learn that Fellpool blood could be used to process a special, invisible material which could give them a massive advantage in the war. Upon coming in contact with Lezonians, they reveal that they were being forced into war by a shadowy, powerful third party with a disgust for the Federation.

Before Dorne fully succumbs to the disease, they do tests on him to figure out a cure. They determined that the only possible way to fight it would be to make a vaccine that uses the original source of the disease. While the origin of the virus is tracked back to being on Roak itself, it is from Asmodeus, the King of the Demon World, who had been killed 300 years prior to the spread of the disease. Ronyx talks the group into using a Time Gate on the Planet Styx to go back 300 years into the past to track down Asmodeus back when he was still alive. While this works, Ilia trips while approaching the gate. As such, Ilia and Roddick have a delay from when they enter the time gate, and after the trip through time, they find themselves separated from Ronyx and Millie. The two groups work towards locating each other, and Asmodeus, in efforts to heal their family members and stop the war.

===Characters===
* Roddick Farrence is a 19-year-old Fellpool swordsman and the game&#x27;s protagonist.

She is voiced by Melissa Fahn in the English version, and Tomoe Hanba in the Japanese version.

==Development==
In 1994, video game developers Wolf Team signed a deal with publisher Namco to release the game that would be &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot;, which was later released in 1995 in Japan for the Super Famicom. The development cycle for this game, however, was plagued with creative disputes between the developers and publisher, leading to much of the development team leaving to form a new company, which would become tri-Ace, which explains some of the common themes between the games, such as the similar battle systems.

After &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; was completed, some of the game&#x27;s designers felt that the core skill and item systems were too &quot;generic&quot;, and for their next game they would make a much deeper gameplay experience. To deepen the story, the &quot;private action&quot; system was created to reveal more of the characters history, personality and relationships, but the score the game generated from various choices was hidden from players since there was no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; story path. In order to tell a &quot;bigger&quot; story, space was chosen as the setting.

Both &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; and &quot;Star Ocean&quot; stretched the power of the Super Famicom to its limits, with a total of 48 megabits of data. Additionally, &quot;Star Ocean&quot; was also one of two games that used a special S-DD1 chip to aid in compression of almost all graphics and map data, meaning that it effectively stored even more data than &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot;, though the compression led to a lower audio quality. The game also featured special technology called a &quot;Flexible Voice Driver&quot; that allowed for the compression of sound, allowing for voice clips for characters when in battles, another trait that was both very rare for a Super Famicom game, and shared with &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot;. Different voice clips would be played depending on the scenario; if the characters were confronted by weak enemies, they may say something more confident, where as if confronted by strong enemies, they may say something more fearful or frantic. Mode 7 graphics were generated using software, and appear when items pop out of treasure chests; the need for extra tiles, however, limited the graphical effects implementation. The game also featured surround sound. Planning for a sequel began as soon as development was completed on &quot;Star Ocean&quot;. Feedback about weak boss monsters later led to more challenging battles in &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot;.

The game was released on July 19, 1996. Despite appearing in North American video game magazine &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; in 1996, the Super Famicom version was never officially released anywhere outside Japan. Enix America ceased to publish games in North America by the end of 1995 due to poor sales, and Nintendo had already passed on publishing &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; a year prior, instead choosing to focus on the then-upcoming Nintendo 64 video game console. The game was later unofficially translated into English by DeJap Translations, who created a patch that made the game fully playable in English via emulation. The game would not be officially available in English until 12 years later, when the game was remade for the PlayStation Portable as &quot;Star Ocean: First Departure&quot; in 2008.

===&quot;First Departure&quot;===
&quot;Star Ocean: First Departure&quot; is an enhanced remake of the original &quot;Star Ocean&quot; for the PlayStation Portable, developed by Tose. The first details of the game were revealed at the &quot;Star Ocean Special Stage&quot; during the Square Enix Party 2007, alongside those of &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot;. Yoshinori Yamagishi, producer of the series, stated that he wanted the remakes to feel as though they&#x27;re completely new games.

The game was first released in Japan on December 27, 2007, then in North America and Europe in October 2008, marking the first time that the original &quot;Star Ocean&quot; was officially released outside Japan. The English localization was handled by Nanica, Inc., with voice-over production services provided by Epcar Entertainment, Inc. &quot;First Departure&quot; uses a slightly altered version of the engine used for &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot; with similar features, including prerendered backgrounds, 3D battle fields and hand drawn facial animations. Production I.G provided new artwork and animated cutscenes for the game. New playable characters have been added as well. New voice actors and extensive amounts of new, fully voiced dialogue were included, with even some non-player characters being voiced over as well. A limited edition called the &quot;Star Ocean: First Departure Eternal Edition&quot; was released exclusively in Japan alongside the standard version. It features alternate box art and was bundled with a &quot;Star Ocean&quot;-themed PSP-2000 handheld and carrying pouch.

An HD remaster of the PlayStation Portable version titled &quot;Star Ocean: First Departure R&quot; for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 was released in December 2019. The new release features re-balanced game difficulty and increased world map movement speed as well as the option to toggle between character portraits from the PSP version or re-drawn designs based on the Super Famicom version. The English release allows the player to choose between English voices or Japanese audio from either the PSP version or re-recorded dialogue from the original Super Famicom voice actors.

===Music===
The scores for &quot;Star Ocean&quot; and &quot;First Departure&quot; were composed and arranged by Motoi Sakuraba. Music from the game was included on the album &quot;Star Ocean Perfect Sound Collection&quot;, released on November 1, 1996 by Sony Records, which included arranged medleys of themes from the Super Famicom version by Sakuraba, Yoshiharu Gotanda, and Kazushi Satoh as well as voice tracks. An album containing music from the PSP version was released on January 30, 2008 by Sony Music and Square Enix which contained 68 tracks across two discs. Critics praised Sakuraba&#x27;s progressive rock style, and highlighted his musical experimentation throughout the original &quot;Star Ocean&quot; score and &quot;First Departure&quot;. Tracks added from &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot; received mixed reviews on the &quot;First Departure&quot; album, adding some familiar &quot;Star Ocean&quot; themes but also some lesser known songs to the mix. Several musical pieces were missing from the original album and were added to the remake&#x27;s release.

The &quot;First Departure&quot; remake features the theme song &quot;Heart&quot; performed by Japanese music group Asunaro, which accompanied the game&#x27;s opening animation as well as the end credits, and was included in that version&#x27;s official soundtrack in 2008. This theme was replaced for the &quot;First Departure R&quot; release with the song by Yauchi Keiko of Shadow of Laffandor.

==Reception==
The original Super Famicom release of &quot;Star Ocean&quot; sold approximately 235,000 copies in Japan, of which just over 175,000 copies were sold during 1996. In a 2009 retro review, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; praised the game&#x27;s technical aspects calling it &quot;one of the best-looking Super Nintendo games ever created&quot; and that the soundtrack &quot;never ceases to amaze&quot;.

&quot;Star Ocean: First Departure&quot; on the PlayStation Portable sold 115,280 copies in its debut week in Japan, with lifetime sales of approximately 204,996 copies in the region. It received a 31 out of 40 total score from Japanese magazine &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot;, based on individual scores of 8, 7, 8, and 8, earning it the publication&#x27;s Silver Award. While the editors thought the title&#x27;s animation and characters were well done and the story was &quot;charming&quot; they lamented that players could only save their progress at certain points such as the world map, which they also felt too large and had a limited field of view.

The English version of &quot;First Departure&quot; received mixed to average reviews, earning a 77% rating on GameRankings and a 74 out of 100 average from Metacritic. Many reviewers felt that despite the updated graphics and sound, the game still felt less refined than more modern role-playing games. &quot;IGN&quot; found the game to have a &quot;bland, awkwardly-told narrative&quot; with &quot;weak characters&quot;, but thought that it would appeal to fans of older games. &quot;GameSpot&quot; also stated that the title had &quot;limited appeal&quot; in addition to providing little challenge. Andrew Fitch of &quot;1UP.com&quot;, however, called &quot;First Departure&quot; an &quot;overlooked classic&quot; with &quot;ridiculously engrossing crafting minutiae&quot; and numerous character party combinations that increase its replay value. &quot;GameSpy&quot; called &quot;Star Ocean: First Departure&quot; one of the best games for PSP platform.

&quot;First Departure R&quot; for the PlayStation 4 earned a 73 out of 100 average from Metacritic. &quot;Dualshockers&quot; called it &quot;an underwhelming port of an excellent but often forgotten Square Enix JRPG&quot;, remarking that any improvements to the PSP version were &quot;mostly minor&quot; such as the re-balance to the game&#x27;s difficulty. The website remarked that the character designs featured in the animated cutscenes originally created for the PSP version do not match the remaster&#x27;s new artwork, adding that these scenes were rare, but they are emblematic of the fairly low-effort port that &quot;Star Ocean First Departure R&quot; is. &quot;PlayStation Universe&quot; called attention to the title&#x27;s &quot;simplistic gameplay&quot; and repetitive combat, but commended the animation of its character sprites and updated portrait art.

<doc id="970022" wikidata="Q3068024" url="?curid=970022" title="First Secretary of State">
<text>First Secretary of State is an office that is sometimes held by a minister of the Crown in the Government of the United Kingdom. The office indicates seniority, including over all other secretaries of state. The office is not always in use, so there have sometimes been extended gaps between successive holders. 

The office frequently serves the same political functions as that of Deputy Prime Minister, and while there have been occasions when the two titles have existed at the same time, Prime Ministers historically have tended to designate one or the other (or neither). The office is currently vacant. The most recent person to hold the title was Dominic Raab from 2019 to 2021, which ended when the title was swapped for Deputy Prime Minister instead in 2022.

== Constitutional position ==
Like the deputy prime minister, the first secretary enjoys no right of automatic succession to the office of Prime Minister. However, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to an intensive care unit on 6 April 2020, after contracting COVID-19, First Secretary Dominic Raab was asked &quot;to deputise for him where necessary.&quot;

The office temporarily enjoyed some greater constitutional footing between when it was incorporated as a corporation sole in 2002 and having all of its remaining functions transferred in 2008. During most of this time, John Prescott was First Secretary.

==History==
In 1962, R.A. Butler was the first person to be appointed to the office, in part to avoid earlier royal objections to the office of Deputy Prime Minister. The office gave Butler ministerial superiority over the rest of the Cabinet and indicated that he was second-in-command. Harold Wilson appointed three people to the office between 1964 and 1970, but it has been noted by Anthony Seldon et al. that the office may have caught on &quot;more as an ego-massager than for functional reasons.&quot;

Later, Michael Heseltine and John Prescott held the office alongside being Deputy Prime Minister. The two offices have only existed concurrently with different holders in David Cameron&#x27;s coalition government, wherein Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg was appointed Deputy Prime Minister while Conservative William Hague was First Secretary.

== Responsibilities ==
The office is currently listed on the gov.uk website as bringing no additional responsibilities. However, Lord Norton says that there are two benefits to a prime minister in appointing a first secretary: firstly, it leaves a senior minister free to perform correlation and co-ordination and to chair committees and, secondly, it enables the prime minister to send a signal as to the status of the holder. Stephen Thornton and Jonathan Kirkup have said that &quot;the Office of First Secretary of State is only as important as the person holding that office is perceived to be important&quot;, but in certain circumstances the office &quot;can assume acute importance and real power&quot; and it may yet become an office of substance.
