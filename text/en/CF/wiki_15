<text>Chris Tarrant (born 18 September 1980) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Collingwood Football Club and the Fremantle Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He announced at the end of the 2010 AFL season that he would return to Melbourne for personal reasons and would not extend his contract with Fremantle for the 2011 season. He returned to the Collingwood Football Club via a trade. He made his name as a key forward, but upon his move to Fremantle in 2007, Tarrant found a new position in the backline. Tarrant was noted for his spectacular high marking, athleticism and pace on a lead.

== Early life ==
Born in Derrimut, Victoria, Tarrant originally played for South Mildura in the Sunraysia Football League and moved to Bendigo in 1996 on an AFL scholarship.

In his younger days he was a top basketballer, making the Victorian State under-15 squad before concentrating on football.

His younger brother Robbie Tarrant played 194 games for and and retired in 2023.

== AFL career ==

=== Collingwood ===
Tarrant debuted in the AFL in 1998, playing 11 games for the year, half of the possible 22 games for Collingwood, who placed 14th out of 16th on the ladder for the year.

Despite an increase of just two more games for the 1999 season over the prior season, Tarrant more than tripled his disposal count (187) and kicked 5 times more goals (15) for the season.

By the 2000 season, Tarrant&#x27;s ascendency was clearly evident, playing 19 games and notching up 254 disposals and 28 goals for the season.

In what Tarrant himself claimed as his breakout year, he kicked 53 goals for the year to claim his first Collingwood Leading Goalkicker Award. His contender for the 2001 Mark of the Year was all but assured until Essendon&#x27;s Gary Moorcroft took what many consider to be the best mark of all time.

Tarrant&#x27;s 2002 season was the first season he played where Collingwood had more wins than losses (12–8).

His 2003 season was objectively his best for Collingwood, as he was an All-Australian forward, playing all 22 games plus three finals. He kicked a career-best 54 goals and topped Collingwood&#x27;s goalkicking for the third successive time and won the 2003 Mark of the Year for his high-flying mark against Geelong.

Despite being hampered by knee problems in 2005, Tarrant kicked 36 goals in 17 games to be Collingwood&#x27;s lead goalkicker for a fifth straight season.

In November 2005, Collingwood coach Mick Malthouse stated that Tarrant had gained strength in his legs after a successful recovery from post-season knee surgery. A big 2006 season was predicted from the enigmatic Tarrant, however this did not eventuate.

Honours bestowed upon Tarrant during his AFL career include All-Australian selection in 2003, Second place in the Collingwood Best &amp; Fairest award (Copeland Trophy) in 2003, Club Leading Goalkicker in 2001, 2002 (equal), 2003, 2004, 2005, and Mark Of The Year in 2003.

=== Fremantle ===

On 13 October 2006, the final day of trade week and after being linked with several clubs – primarily the two Western Australian clubs West Coast and Fremantle, Tarrant was traded to the Fremantle Football Club in a deal that saw Paul Medhurst and Draft Selection #8 head to Collingwood.

On being traded to the Dockers, Tarrant said that Subiaco Oval, both Fremantle and the West Coast Eagles&#x27; home ground, would suit his style of play. He also thought that playing alongside Matthew Pavlich, a similar styled player, would be difficult for opposition defences. He also looked forward to a chance to play in the same team as his former schoolmate Dean Solomon, who was also traded to Fremantle.

Tarrant was given the number 17 guernsey to wear. He was initially used to work up on the ground and had racked up multiple possessions playing in that role. He has also played as a second string forward in a forward line that depended much on Pavlich.

In 2009, coach Harvey moved Tarrant into defence following some poor form up forward. The move was successful, with Tarrant putting together a string of noteworthy defensive performances on opposition forwards as well as providing some penetrating rebound attack.

=== Return to Collingwood ===
On 11 October 2010, the final day of the trade period, Tarrant returned to Collingwood in a trade that saw him and pick 44 traded to Collingwood for picks 43 and 55. He was given the Number 2 guernsey and continued to play as a back and full-back as he had at Fremantle.

Tarrant announced his retirement on 21 August 2012, effective from the end of the 2012 season.

== Post-AFL career ==
Since his retirement, Tarrant has become a &quot;fly-in&quot; footballer, signing to play games with clubs around Australia to boost popularity for the clubs. Tarrant signed on to play one game for the North Launceston Bombers in 2013, kicking seven goals against eventual premiers South Launceston.

Tarrant also made one appearance for the Glenorchy Football Club in 2013 in the TSL.

Tarrant returned to the Bombers in 2014, signing a minimum five game contract, with the option of continuing for finals. He appeared in the qualifying final, kicking five goals to help the Bombers advance to the second semi. During the second semi final, he was reported for striking a Clarence player, but received a reprimand due to his good record. With the Bombers causing an upset, Tarrant lined up in the Tasmanian State League Grand Final.

==Off-field incidents==
In August 2006, Tarrant and Collingwood teammate Ben Johnson were involved in a fight at a Port Melbourne nightclub. Johnson was charged with recklessly causing injury and unlawful assault and accepted responsibility for the incident. Tarrant was not charged, but was fined $5,000 by Collingwood for breaking the players code of conduct.

In June 2007, Tarrant was accused of showing his backside to a female patron of a Darwin nightclub and punching the Federal ALP candidate for Division of Solomon, Damian Hale, after he confronted Tarrant about his behaviour. After the Fremantle Football Club took the unusual step of referring the matter to the AFL to investigate, they fined Tarrant $5,000 and suspended him for three matches, with two matches suspended until the end of 2008.

<text>Adriaan &quot;Aad&quot; van Wijngaarden (2 November 1916 – 7 February 1987) was a Dutch mathematician and computer scientist. Trained as a mechanical engineer, Van Wijngaarden emphasized and promoted the mathematical aspects of computing, first in numerical analysis, then in programming languages and finally in design principles of such languages.

== Biography ==
Van Wijngaarden&#x27;s university education was in mechanical engineering, for which he received a degree from Delft University of Technology in 1939. He then studied for a doctorate in hydrodynamics, but abandoned the field. He joined the Nationaal Luchtvaartlaboratorium in 1945 and went with a group to England the next year to learn about new technologies that had been developed there during World War II.

Van Wijngaarden was intrigued by the new idea of automatic computing. On 1 January 1947, he became the head of the Computing Department of the brand-new Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI), which was at the time known as the Mathematisch Centrum (MC), in Amsterdam. He then made further visits to England and the United States, gathering ideas for the construction of the first Dutch computer, the ARRA, an electromechanical device first demonstrated in 1952. In that same year, van Wijngaarden hired Edsger W. Dijkstra, and they worked on software for the ARRA.

in 1958, while visiting Edinburgh, Scotland, Van Wijngaarden was seriously injured in an automobile accident in which his wife was killed. After he recovered, he focused more on programming language research. The following year, he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1961, he became the director of the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam and remained in that post for the next twenty years.

He was one of the designers of the original ALGOL language, and later ALGOL 68, for which he developed a two-level type of formal grammar that became known as a Van Wijngaarden grammar.

In 1962, he became involved with developing international standards in programming and informatics, as a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, maintains, and supports the programming languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68.

== Van Wijngaarden Awards ==
The Van Wijngaarden Awards are named in his honor and are awarded every 5 years from the 60th anniversary of the Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica in 2006. The physical award consists of a bronze sculpture.

<text>Maow was a Canadian indie rock band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. A pop punk combo, the band was part of the &quot;cuddlecore&quot; scene led by cub.
Maow consisted of guitarist/singer Tobey Black, bassist/singer Corrina Beesley-Hammond and drummer/singer Neko Case, who had been with Cub.

==History==
The band came together in 1994, when Americans Case and Beesley-Hammond, who had been at art school together (at what is now Emily Carr University of Art and Design), joined with Black, also an American who was studying in Vancouver. Their original name was &#x27;Meow&#x27;; they changed it when a New York band of the same name objected. They played their first gig in the backyard of the &#x27;House of Rock&#x27;, where its residents, members of The Smugglers, held events such as the &#x27;Debut-B-Q&#x27;. When Maow performed, neighbours called the police. The police attended, and watched the concert.

In 1994, Maow entered &#x27;Shindig&#x27;, a band contest hosted by the University of British Columbia radio station CITR-FM, and became the first female band to win. (&quot;Discorder Magazine&quot; called it a &quot;travesty of musical justice&quot; because Maow was &quot;Really bad&quot;.) As a result of the win, the band was given recording time at Mushroom Studios; Beesley-Hammond recalled that Heart had just finished recording and their lipstick was still on the microphones. While recording, they found their musicianship rapidly improving.

Maow released a six-song EP, &quot;I Ruv Me Too!&quot; on the independent Texas record label Twist Like This, which was owned by Beesley-Hammond&#x27;s brother. Also in 1995, the band was signed to Vancouver&#x27;s Mint Records (which is co-owned by Beesley-Hammond&#x27;s now-husband, Kevin Beesley, guitarist for The Smugglers and the Beauticians).

In June 1996, they released their full-length album, &quot;The Unforgiving Sounds of Maow&quot;. The album had two cover songs and fourteen original tracks, the best known of which was &quot;Ms. Lefevre&quot;. Where they had previously not taken themselves seriously, with the release of the album, they took a more professional approach and started touring. They opened for The Phantom Surfers in San Francisco, they played the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto, and numerous Canadian venues in between. With outlandish costumes, a cheeky sense of humour and a tomboy attitude, their media attention increased and they were asked to go on a US tour with the punk rock band The Hanson Brothers. But when the bands arrived at the American border together, Maow misrepresented their reason for crossing into the US. Both bands were denied entry and their instruments were seized. The tour was cancelled, resulting in a significant loss of revenue for both bands, and for Virgin Records.

Maow toured across Canada with the Hanson Brothers but the three women found that touring was unhealthy and stressful. Beesley-Hammond went into footwear design. Case moved back to the US and went on to a solo career as an alternative country star and sometime vocalist with Canadian power pop ensemble The New Pornographers. In 2001, Black joined the indie rock band The Gay.

<doc id="943416" wikidata="Q2291202" url="?curid=943416" title="POWER5">
<text>The POWER5 is a microprocessor developed and fabricated by IBM. It is an improved version of the POWER4. The principal improvements are support for simultaneous multithreading (SMT) and an on-die memory controller. The POWER5 is a dual-core microprocessor, with each core supporting one physical thread and two logical threads, for a total of two physical threads and four logical threads.

== History ==

Technical details of the microprocessor were first presented at the 2003 Hot Chips conference. A more complete description was given at Microprocessor Forum 2003 on 14 October 2003. The POWER5 was not sold openly and was used exclusively by IBM and their partners. Systems using the microprocessor were introduced in 2004. The POWER5 competed in the high-end enterprise server market, mostly against the Intel Itanium 2 and to a lesser extent, the Sun Microsystems UltraSPARC IV and the Fujitsu SPARC64 V. It was superseded in 2005 by an improved iteration, the POWER5+.

== Description ==
The POWER5 is a further development of the POWER4. The addition of two-way multithreading required the duplication of the return stack, program counter, instruction buffer, group completion unit and store queue so that each thread may have its own. Most resources, such as the register files and execution units, are shared, although each thread sees its own set of registers. The POWER5 implements simultaneous multithreading (SMT), where two threads are executed simultaneously. The POWER5 can disable SMT to optimize for the current workload.

As many resources such as the register files are shared by two threads, they are increased in capacity in many cases to compensate for the loss of performance. The number of integer and floating-point registers is increased to 120 each, from 80 integer and 72 floating-point registers in the POWER4. The floating-point issue queue is also increased in capacity to 24 entries from 20. The capacity of the L2 unified cache was increased to 1.875 MB and the set-associativity to 10-way. The unified L3 cache was brought on-package instead of located externally in separate chips. Its capacity was increased to 36 MB. Like the POWER4, the cache is shared by the two cores. The cache is accessed via two unidirectional 128-bit buses operating at half the core frequency.

The on-die memory controller supports up to 64 GB of DDR and DDR2 memory. It uses high-frequency serial buses to communicate with external buffers that interface the dual inline memory modules (DIMMs) to the microprocessor.

The POWER5 contains 276 million transistors and has an area of 389 mm2. It is fabricated by IBM in a 0.13 μm silicon on insulator (SOI) complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process with eight layers of copper interconnect. The POWER5 die is packaged in either a dual chip module (DCM) or a multi-chip module (MCM). The DCM contains one POWER5 die and its associated L3 cache die. The MCM contains four POWER5 dies and four L3 cache dies, one for each POWER5 die, and measures 95 mm by 95 mm.

Several POWER5 processors in high-end systems can be coupled together to act as a single vector processor by a technology called ViVA (Virtual Vector Architecture).

== POWER5+ ==

The POWER5+ is an improved iteration of the POWER5 introduced on 4 October 2005. Improvements initially were lower power consumption, due to the newer process it was fabricated in. The POWER5+ chip uses a 90 nm fabrication process. This resulted in the die size decrease from 389 mm2 to 243 mm2.

Clock frequency was not increased at launch and remained between at 1.5 to 1.9 GHz. On 14 February 2006, new versions raised the clock frequency to 2.2 GHz and then to 2.3 GHz on 25 July 2006.

The POWER5+ was packaged in the same packages as previous POWER5 microprocessors, but was also available in a quad-chip module (QCM) containing two POWER5+ dies and two L3 cache dies, one for each POWER5+ die. These QCM chips ran at a clock frequency of between 1.5 and 1.8 GHz.

== Products ==
IBM uses the DCM and MCM POWER5 microprocessors in its System p and System i server families, in its DS8000 storage server, and as embedded microprocessors in its high-end Infoprint printers. DCM POWER5 microprocessors are used by IBM in its high-end IntelliStation POWER 285 workstation. Third-party users of POWER5 microprocessors are Groupe Bull, in its Escala servers, and Hitachi, in its SR11000 computers with up to 128 POWER5+ microprocessors, which have several installations featured in the 2007 TOP500 list of supercomputers. IBM uses the POWER5+ QCM in its System p5 510Q, 520Q, 550Q and 560Q servers.

<text>Julianne Phillips (born May 6, 1960) is an American former model and actress. She began her career as a model in the early 1980s before moving on to acting. She first attracted attention as the first wife of Bruce Springsteen and later for her role as Francesca &quot;Frankie&quot; Reed on the television drama series &quot;Sisters&quot; (1991–1996).

==Biography==
Phillips was born in Evanston, Illinois, the youngest of six children in a Roman Catholic family. She is the daughter of William Phillips, an insurance broker and executive, and his wife, Ann. She has five siblings: four older brothers and one older sister. Phillips&#x27;s family relocated to Oregon in her early years, settling in the affluent Portland suburb of Lake Oswego, where she was raised.

Phillips graduated from Lake Oswego High School and attended Brooks College in Long Beach, California.

===Early career===
After graduating from college, Phillips returned to Oregon and began appearing in local community theater productions. This led to her being signed by Elite Modeling Agency in 1982, who characterized her as a &quot;perfect-ten package,&quot; earning as much as $2,000 a day. After modeling in New York City, Phillips moved to Los Angeles, where she appeared in the .38 Special music video for the song &quot;If I&#x27;d Been the One.&quot; This led to Phillips&#x27; acting roles in 1984&#x27;s made-for-TV movies &quot;His Mistress&quot;, in which she co-starred with Robert Urich, and &quot;Summer Fantasy&quot;. She also appeared at the end of then-husband Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s music video &quot;Glory Days.&quot;

===Marriage and divorce===
Phillips garnered publicity as the girlfriend and, later, the first wife of musician Bruce Springsteen. The two met in October 1984 and were subsequently married in her native Lake Oswego shortly after midnight on Monday, May 13, 1985, surrounded by intense media Citing irreconcilable differences, she filed for divorce in August 1988, which was finalized the following Since the divorce, neither party has commented publicly on their relationship.

===Acting career===
Phillips continued her acting career during and after the marriage. She appeared in &quot;Odd Jobs&quot; (1986), &quot;Sweet Lies&quot; (1988), and &quot;Seven Hours to Judgment&quot; (1988), and starred opposite Chevy Chase in &quot;Fletch Lives&quot; and John Ritter in &quot;Skin Deep&quot; both in 1989.

Two years later, she accepted the role of Frankie Reed, the business-oriented character on &quot;Sisters&quot;; it became her best-known role. She left the show at the end of its fifth season in 1995, returning for its final episode in 1996.

<text>Core Image is a pixel-accurate, near-realtime, non-destructive image processing technology in Mac OS X. Implemented as part of the QuartzCore framework of Mac OS X 10.4 and later, Core Image provides a plugin-based architecture for applying filters and effects within the Quartz graphics rendering layer. The framework was later added to iOS in iOS 5.

== Overview ==
Core Image abstracts the pixel-level manipulation process required when applying a filter to an image, making it simple for applications to implement image transformation capabilities without extensive coding. In a simple implementation, Core Image applies a single &quot;Image Filter&quot; to the pixel data of a given source to produce the transformed image. Each Image Filter specifies a single transform or effect, either built into Core Image or loaded from a plugin called an &quot;Image Unit&quot;. Combined with preset or user-defined input parameters, the filter can be applied to the original pixel data without modifying it, thereby providing non-destructive image editing.

Like Photoshop, Core Image can apply multiple filters to the same image source. Instead of applying a series of filters individually, Core Image assembles a dynamic &quot;instruction pipeline&quot; so that only one calculation needs to be applied to the pixel data to achieve a cumulative effect. Applying the pixel operations associated with multiple filters can be achieved simultaneously and without a significant increase in processing time. Regardless of the number of filters, Core Image assembles the code for this instruction pipeline with a just-in-time compiler, which is executed by either the CPU or graphics card&#x27;s GPU, whichever can perform the calculation faster.

Filters are written in the &quot;Core Image Kernel Language&quot;, which shares a subset of commands with OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL). When a compatible GPU is available, the Core Image compiler writes the instruction pipeline using GLSL, handling buffers and states transparently. Although GPU rendering is preferred, the compiler can operate in a &quot;CPU fallback&quot; mode, generating commands suitable for the current CPU architecture instead. CPU fallback uses the vector processing capabilities of the current CPU or CPUs, and it is multi-processor aware. Thus, Core Image performance depends on the GLSL capabilities of the GPU or the processing power of the CPU. With a supported GPU, most effects can be rendered in realtime or near-realtime.

== History and implementation ==
Core Image was introduced with Mac OS X 10.4.
Early examples of its use can be found in the &quot;ripple effect&quot; in Dashboard, and Apple&#x27;s professional digital photography application, Aperture. Starting with Mac OS X 10.5, any application that implements Image Kit can utilize Core Image. Preview and iPhoto are common examples.

In 2011, Apple added Core Image to iOS in iOS 5.0.

The Xcode Tools include Core Image Fun House and Quartz Composer; both utilize Core Image.

The Core Image plugin architecture was inspired by that of Core Audio.

==Pixel accuracy==
All pixel processing provided by an Image Unit is performed in a pre-multiplied alpha (RGBA) color space, storing four color channels: red, green, blue, and transparency (alpha). Each color channel is represented by a 32-bit, floating point number. This provides exceptional color depth, far greater than can be perceived by the human eye, as each pixel is represented by a 128-bit vector (four 32-bit color channels). For color spaces of lower bit-depth, the floating-point calculation model employed by Core Image provides exceptional performance, which is useful when processing multiple images or video frames.

== Supported graphics processors ==
Any programmable GPU that supports the required OpenGL Shader (GLSL) commands is Core Image capable. Apple has used the following graphics cards to support Core Image GPU processing in Mac OS X 10.4 and Aperture, so the following list could be considered an example of minimum requirements:
* ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 (Mobility Radeon 9600 is also capable)
* ATI Radeon 9550, 9600, 9650, 9600 XT, 9600 Pro, 9700 Pro, 9800 XT, and 9800 Pro
* ATI Radeon X600 XT, X600 Pro, X800 XT, X850 XT, X1600, X1900 XT
* ATI Radeon HD 2400 XT, HD 2600 Pro, and HD 2600 XT
* NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 Ultra, FX Go 5200
* NVIDIA GeForce 6600, 6600 LE, 6800 Ultra DDL, and 6800 GT DDL
* NVIDIA GeForce 7300 GT, 7600 GT, and 7800 GT
* NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT &amp; 8800 GT
* NVIDIA GeForce 9400M &amp; 9600M GT
* NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 &amp; GT 130
* NVIDIA GeForce GTX 285
* NVIDIA Quadro FX 4500 &amp; FX 5600
* NVIDIA Quadro FX 4800
* NVIDIA Quadro 4000
* NVIDIA GeForce 320M
* NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M
* NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M
* NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M
* NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660M
* NVIDIA GeForce GTX 675M
* NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680MX
* NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M
* NVIDIA GeForce GT 755M
* NVIDIA GeForce GTX 775M
* NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780M
* Intel GMA 900, GMA 950, or GMA X3100
* Intel HD Graphics 3000(Sandy Bridge)
* Intel HD Graphics 4000(Ivy Bridge)
* Intel HD Graphics 5000(Haswell)
* Intel Iris 5100(Haswell)
* Intel Iris Pro 5200(Haswell)
* Intel HD Graphics 5300(Broadwell)
* Intel HD Graphics 6000(Broadwell)
* Intel Iris 6100(Broadwell)

Note that any GPU capable of handling Core Image instructions is also Quartz Extreme capable. The requirements for Core Image are greater than those of Quartz Extreme.

== Built-in filters ==

macOS includes many built-in filters, including the following ones. Mac OS X 10.4 introduced over 100 of them, and Mac OS X 10.5 added to the list.
* Blurs, like Median, Gaussian, Motion, and Noise
* Color Adjustments &amp; Effects, like Exposure, Gamma Adjust, and Sepia Tone
* Composition Operations, like Addition and Multiply Blends, or Hard Light
* Distortions, like Pinch, Circle Splash, and Vortex
* Generators, like Star Shine and Lenticular Halo
* Geometry Adjustments, such as Crop, Scale, Rotate, and Affine transformation
* Halftone, Tile, and Posterize filters
* Transitions, such as Dissolve and Ripple

==See also==
* Acorn (software)
* Aperture
* Core Image Fun House
* GEGL, a programming library used by GIMP
* impromptu
* LiveQuartz
* Pixelmator
* Quartz Composer
* Windows Imaging Component, a Windows component with similar API design but with fewer supported image operations.

<doc id="943427" wikidata="Q5326390" url="?curid=943427" title="Earl of Wicklow">
<text>Earl of Wicklow was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1793 for Alice Howard, Dowager Viscountess Wicklow. Born Alice Forward, she was the daughter of William Forward, Member of the Irish House of Commons for the County Donegal, and the widow of Ralph Howard, 1st Viscount Wicklow. The latter was the son of the Right Reverend Robert Howard, Lord Bishop of Elphin, and represented the County Wicklow in the Irish Parliament. In 1776 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Clonmore, of Clonmore in the County of Carlow, and in 1785 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Wicklow, also in the Peerage of Ireland. Both Lord and Lady Wicklow were succeeded by their eldest son, the second Earl. He sat in the House of Lords as one of the twenty-eight original Irish representative peer from 1800 to 1815. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl. In 1780 he had assumed by Royal licence his maternal grandfather&#x27;s surname of Forward. After succeeding in the earldom in 1815 he resumed the same year by Royal licence the surname of Howard after that of Forward.

On his death, the titles passed to his son, the fourth Earl. He was an Irish Representative Peer from 1821 to 1869 and served as Lord-Lieutenant of County Wicklow from 1831 to 1869. He was succeeded by his nephew, the fifth Earl. He was the eldest son from the second marriage of Reverend the Hon. Francis Howard, second son of the third Earl. He was an Irish Representative Peer from 1872 to 1881. When he died unmarried at an early age the titles passed to his younger brother, the sixth Earl. He sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer from 1888 to 1891. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the seventh Earl. He was an Irish Representative Peer from 1905 to 1946 and a Senator of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1928. When he died the titles passed to his son, the eighth Earl, who moved in literary and artistic circles and was a close friend of Evelyn Waugh. The 8th Earl, who married the former member of the Irish Senate Eleanor Butler in 1959, was childless and on his death in 1978, the titles passed to his first cousin, Cecil Aylmar Howard, a grandson of the sixth earl. The ninth earl died in 1983 without issue and the peerages became extinct.

The ancestral seat of the Earls of Wicklow was the palatial Shelton Abbey, near Arklow, County Wicklow, which remained in the family until 1951. Shortly thereafter financial difficulties forced the 8th Earl to sell the estate to the Irish State. Shelton Abbey is currently used as an open prison.

<doc id="943437" wikidata="Q142171" url="?curid=943437" title="São Tomé and Príncipe at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>São Tomé and Príncipe competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, which was held from 13 to 29 August 2004. The country&#x27;s participation at Athens marked its third appearance in the Summer Olympics since its debut in the 1996 Summer Olympics. 

Two track and field athletes, Yazaldes Nascimento and Fumilay Fonseca, were selected to represent the nation via wildcards, as the nation had no athletes that met either the &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; qualifying standards. Fonseca was selected as flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Fonseca was also notable for becoming the youngest ever athlete to represent São Tomé and Príncipe at the Summer Olympics, aged 16 years and 92 days. This is a record which still stands today.

Nascimento did not progress beyond the heats in the Men&#x27;s 100 meters, and Fonseca finished last in her event, the 20 kilometers walk. This therefore meant that São Tomé and Príncipe won no medals in this Summer Olympics.

==Background==
São Tomé and Príncipe participated in three Summer Olympic games between its debut in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. No São Tomé and Príncipe athlete had ever won a medal at the Summer Olympics before the 2004 Athens Games.

The São Tomé and Príncipe National Olympic Committee (NOC) selected two athletes via wildcards. Usually a NOC would be able to select up to three athletes per event providing that each athlete passed the &quot;A&quot; standard time for that event. If no athletes met the &quot;A&quot; standard, then the NOC would be able to select one athlete for the event, providing that they pass the &quot;B&quot; standard time for the event in question. However, since São Tomé and Príncipe had no athletes that met either standard for any event, they were allowed to select their best two athletes, one of each gender, to represent the nation at the Games. This was to ensure that every nation had a minimum of two representatives in the Summer Olympics. The two athletes that were selected to compete in the Athens games were Yazaldes Nascimento in the Men&#x27;s 100 meters and Fumilay Fonseca in the Women&#x27;s 20 kilometers walk. Fonseca was selected as flag bearer for the opening ceremony.

==Athletics==

Making his Summer Olympics debut, Yazaldes Nascimento qualified for the 2004 Athens Games as a wildcard, without competing in any notable sporting event. He competed on 21 August in Heat 1 against seven other athletes. He ran a time of 11.00 seconds, finishing last of the eight athletes competing. Singapore&#x27;s Poh Seng Song placed ahead of him with a time of 10.75 seconds, in a heat led by Namibia&#x27;s Frank Fredericks who posted a time of 10.12 seconds, 0.88 seconds quicker than Nascimento&#x27;s time. Out of 84 athletes, Nascimento ranked 67th and was 0.65 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the quarter-finals. Therefore, that was the end of his competition.
Competing at her first Summer Olympics, Fumilay Fonseca was notable for carrying the São Tomé and Príncipe flag at the opening ceremony and for becoming the youngest person to represent the nation aged 16 years and 92 days, a record that still stands today. She qualified for the 2004 Athens Games after being granted a wildcard place as she had not competed in any notable sporting event. She competed in the 20 kilometer walk on 23 August against 56 other athletes. She finished last of the 52 that finished with a time of 2 hours, 4 minutes and 54 seconds. Mauritius&#x27; Yolene Raffin ranked ahead of her with a time of 1 minute 49.28 seconds. By comparison, the woman who won the gold medal, Greece&#x27;s Athanasia Tsoumeleka, posted a time of 1 minute and 29.12 seconds, 35.42 seconds faster than Fonseca&#x27;s time.

<doc id="943452" wikidata="Q5913028" url="?curid=943452" title="Houghton on the Hill">
<text>Houghton on the Hill is a village and civil parish lying to the east of Leicester in the Harborough district, in Leicestershire, East Midlands in England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 1,524.

An entry for Houghton on the Hill is recorded in the Domesday Book.

In 2007, the village made national news headlines, and was dubbed &quot;the village of the scammed&quot; when a large number of fraudulent credit card charges in the Far East were linked to the JET filling station. In August 2008, Sri-Lankan born cashier, Nyal Rajput, was jailed for two years and nine months after admitting to the charge of obtaining property by deception. A total of £175,000 was stolen in the scam.

==Residents==
The population of Houghton was 1,548. (2011 census) Many of Houghton&#x27;s residents commute to Leicester, Uppingham (in Rutland) or other nearby towns. The village is the birthplace of the famed Australian landscape artist John Glover (1767-1849).
The Manor of Houghton was owned by Thompson Family for many years until it was sold to George Anthony Legh Keck in 1805. It later passed to the Lilford Family until 1913 when it was sold. Since 2019, three new housing estates have been built on the outskirts of the village increasing the population significantly.

==Services==
Services in Houghton on the Hill include:

*School
*Houghton on the Hill C of E Primary School
Houghton on the Hill C of E Primary School is situated in the lower part of the village. It was erected in 1856 and extensions were built in 1966, 1976, 1983 and 2019 It is a co-educational Church of England (controlled) Primary School and educates children from 4 to 11 years of age. The number of children enrolled at the school is now 180 (1 March 2010). The catchment area is made up of Houghton on the Hill and Ingarsby but most of the children come from other areas. It also has a very good year 4&amp;5 netball team.

*Churches
There are two churches in the village; the Anglican St Catharine&#x27;s church and a Methodist church, both situated on &quot;Main Street&quot;.

*Public Houses
The two pubs in the village are the &quot;Old Black Horse&quot;, on Main Street, and the &quot;Rose &amp; Crown&quot;, on &quot;Uppingham Road&quot;.

*Bus Service
The 747 bus service runs 2 hourly during daytime through Houghton-on-the-Hill to Leicester or Uppingham with an hourly service at peak times. There is no evening or Sunday service. The service is under threat of closure from June 2019. The Rural Rider service that passed through the village was withdrawn in May 2015. Most residents commute by car.

*Teams
There is also a football team (Houghton Rangers Football Club) who have a junior team set up as well as an adult team. They play on &quot;Weir Lane&quot; playing fields as well as a cricket team (Houghton Cricket Club) who play on Dixon&#x27;s field in the southern end of the village next to the School.

*Village hall
There is a village hall situated in the centre of the village with a bowling green attached. Houghton has a scout troop ranging from Beavers to Explorers (Formerly Venture Scouts). There is also a Tennis Club situated on the Weir Lane Playing facilities.

*Newsletters
The village has a monthly newsletter, the &quot;Houghton News&quot;, which features articles from various village groups, events listings, and reports from Parish Council meetings.

==Fun day==
Every summer since the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee in 2002, the village held its Summer Funday. This took place on a Saturday (1st weekend in July) and goes on all afternoon (starts with parade at 2:30). This event attracted all the villagers (young and old) who wished to participate from organising the events in the field and helping with the organising of the Fancy Dress competition to helping set up the stalls and gazebos on the main field at the back of the Pub.

The Fun Day began with a parade from Paresh&#x27;s former newsagent at 2:30 going down &quot;St Catharines Way&quot; past St Catharines Church, down &quot;Main Street&quot; and towards the field at the back of the Old Black Horse pub where the judging took place.

In 2007 the Fun Day was not able to be held in July due to the field being waterlogged, but the Day was rescheduled to 8 September 2007.

The &#x27;Fun Day&#x27; has recently been restarted by a village fundraising group and is now called the Houghton Scarecrow Festival. It was first held in 2014, raising money for local groups and societies in the village.

==Politics==
Houghton-on-the-Hill forms part of the Thurnby and Houghton ward of Harborough District Council, currently represented by three Liberal Democrats, including Liberal Democrat group leader on Harborough Council Simon Galton. Cllr Galton is also Houghton&#x27;s representative and ex-Liberal Democrat group leader on Leicestershire County Council, where the village forms part of the Launde division. Houghton is also a civil parish with a parish council made up of independent elected members.

The parish is in the Rutland and Stamford constituency. Houghton was, until 1997, part of the Harborough constituency at Westminster, represented by Edward Garnier. However, following boundary alterations that year, it was moved into the constituency of Rutland and Melton, whose MP since 2019 has been Alicia Kearns.

==Former railway==
There used to be a railway that ran through Ingarsby, approximately two miles north of Houghton. Its station was named &quot;Ingarsby for Houghton on the Hill&quot; owing to its use by commuters from the larger village. The railway line and station were closed in 1954, but both the station building and the station master&#x27;s house remain in Ingarsby, having been converted to residential properties. The most notable sign of the railway&#x27;s existence is a long unused rail tunnel. This is notable because one portal was demolished, leaving only one entry point and no exit.

<text>Kyrgyzstan competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s third appearance at the Olympics in the post-Soviet era.

The National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan sent the nation&#x27;s smallest delegation to the Games. A total of 29 athletes, 22 men and 7 women, competed only in 9 sports. Eight Kyrgyzstani athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including 43-year-old marathon runner Irina Bogachova, Greco-Roman wrestler Gennady Chkhaidze, who finished fifth for his native country Georgia in the men&#x27;s heavyweight division, and Asian Games silver medalist Evgeny Vakker in men&#x27;s road cycling. Freestyle swimmer Ruslan Ismailov, aged 14, set the nation&#x27;s Olympic milestone as the youngest ever athlete to compete at the Olympics. Weightlifter and 2000 Olympian Mital Sharipov was the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

For the second time in history, Kyrgyzstan failed to win a single Olympic medal in Athens.

<doc id="943456" wikidata="Q766215" url="?curid=943456" title="Vincent Ford">
<text>Vincent Ford (10 November 194028 December 2008), known as &quot;Tata&quot; or &quot;Tartar&quot;, was a Jamaican songwriter best known for receiving writing credit for &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;, the reggae song made famous by Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers, as well as three other Bob Marley songs. However, controversy persisted as to whether the compositions had actually been written by Marley himself, and had been credited to Ford to allow Marley to avoid contractual obligations, resulting in a legal battle that ended with the Marley estate being granted control of the songs.

== Biography ==
Vincent Ford was born on 10 November 1940. He used a wheelchair, having lost his legs due to diabetes. Despite his disability, he was still able to save another youth from drowning when he was a teenager. He ran a soup kitchen in Trenchtown.

Ford died at age 68 on 28 December 2008 in Kingston, Jamaica.

== Songwriting ==
Marley had signed a songwriting contract with producer Danny Sims at Cayman Music, and in 1972, Marley and the Wailers were signed by Chris Blackwell to Island Records. 

Ford was given writing credit for &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; on the 1974 album &quot;Natty Dread&quot;, as well the songs &quot;Crazy Baldhead&quot; (with Marley&#x27;s wife Rita), &quot;Positive Vibration&quot; and &quot;Roots Rock Reggae&quot; from the 1976 album &quot;Rastaman Vibration&quot;, along with &quot;Inna de Red&quot; and &quot;Jah Bless&quot; with Marley&#x27;s son, Stephen.

Marley had not wanted his new songs to be associated with Cayman and it had been speculated, including in his obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot;, that he had put them in the names of his close friends and family members as a means of avoiding the contractual restrictions and as a way to &quot;provide lasting help to family and close friends&quot;.

Marley&#x27;s widow was sued by his former manager Danny Sims in a claim for royalty and ownership rights to these songs. Sims claimed that Marley had actually written the songs but had assigned the credit to Ford to avoid meeting obligations under Marley&#x27;s contract with Sims. A 1987 court decision sided with the Marley estate, which assumed full control of the songs.

Marley historian Roger Steffens recounted that Marley had acknowledged in a 1975 Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation interview that he had written &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; while tuning a guitar in Tata&#x27;s yard.

While in Trenchtown in the late 1970s, Marley biographer Vivien Goldman asked Ford point-blank &quot;Was it you?&quot; who wrote the songs. Ford never responded to the question directly, answering &quot;Well, what do you think?&quot; Goldman described Ford as &quot;an unbroken link to a generation, many of whom are now gone&quot;, reminiscing that &quot;The last time I saw him he was going into a Marley family gig in Kingston, and he was just borne along on a wave of youth, all admiring him and understanding what he’d come to represent.&quot; Given the collaborative nature of reggae, Goldman described how &quot;That song may very well have been a conversation that they had sitting around one night. That&#x27;s the way Bob&#x27;s creativity worked. In the end it didn&#x27;t matter. The point is Bob wanted him to have the money.&quot;

<doc id="943457" wikidata="Q4345785" url="?curid=943457" title="Atomic sentence">
<text>In logic and analytic philosophy, an atomic sentence is a type of declarative sentence which is either true or false (may also be referred to as a proposition, statement or truthbearer) and which cannot be broken down into other simpler sentences. For example, &quot;The dog ran&quot; is an atomic sentence in natural language, whereas &quot;The dog ran and the cat hid&quot; is a molecular sentence in natural language.

From a logical analysis point of view, the truth or falsity of sentences in general is determined by only two things: the logical form of the sentence and the truth or falsity of its simple sentences. This is to say, for example, that the truth of the sentence &quot;John is Greek and John is happy&quot; is a function of the meaning of &quot;and&quot;, and the truth values of the atomic sentences &quot;John is Greek&quot; and &quot;John is happy&quot;. However, the truth or falsity of an atomic sentence is not a matter that is within the scope of logic itself, but rather whatever art or science the content of the atomic sentence happens to be talking about.

Logic has developed artificial languages, for example sentential calculus and predicate calculus, partly with the purpose of revealing the underlying logic of natural-language statements, the surface grammar of which may conceal the underlying logical structure. In these artificial languages an atomic sentence is a string of symbols which can represent an elementary sentence in a natural language, and it can be defined as follows. In a formal language, a well-formed formula (or wff) is a string of symbols constituted in accordance with the rules of syntax of the language. A term is a variable, an individual constant or an n-place function letter followed by n terms. An atomic formula is a wff consisting of either a sentential letter or an n-place predicate letter followed by n terms. A sentence is a wff in which any variables are bound. An atomic sentence is an atomic formula containing no variables. It follows that an atomic sentence contains no logical connectives, variables, or quantifiers. A sentence consisting of one or more sentences and a logical connective is a compound (or molecular) sentence.

== Examples ==
=== Assumptions ===
In the following examples:
* let &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot; be predicate letters; 
* let &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; be individual constants; 
* let &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; be variables.

=== Atomic sentences ===
These wffs are atomic sentences; they contain no free variables or conjunctions:

* &quot;F&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)
* &quot;G&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)
* &quot;H&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)

=== Atomic formulae ===
These wffs are atomic formulae, but are not sentences (atomic or otherwise) because they include free variables:
* &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)
* &quot;G&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;z&quot;)
* &quot;H&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;)

=== Compound sentences ===

These wffs are compound sentences. They are sentences, but are not atomic sentences because they are not atomic formulae:
* ∀&quot;x&quot; (&quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;))
* ∃&quot;z&quot; (&quot;G&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;z&quot;))
* ∃x&quot; ∀y&quot; ∃&quot;z&quot; (&quot;H&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;))
* ∀x&quot; ∃z&quot; (&quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ∧ &quot;G&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;z&quot;))
* ∃x&quot; ∀y&quot; ∃&quot;z&quot; (&quot;G&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) ∨ &quot;H&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;))

=== Compound formulae ===
These wffs are compound formulae. They are not atomic formulae but are built up from atomic formulae using logical connectives. They are also not sentences because they contain free variables:
* &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ∧ &quot;G&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;z&quot;)
* &quot;G&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) ∨ &quot;H&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;)

==Interpretations==
A sentence is either true or false under an interpretation which assigns values to the logical variables. We might for example make the following assignments:

Individual constants
* a: Socrates
* b: Plato
* c: Aristotle

Predicates
* Fα: α is sleeping
* Gαβ: α hates β
* Hαβγ: α made β hit γ

Sentential variables
* &quot;p&quot;: It is raining.

Under this interpretation the sentences discussed above would represent the following English statements:
* &quot;p&quot;: &quot;It is raining.&quot;
* &quot;F&quot;(&quot;a&quot;): &quot;Socrates is sleeping.&quot;
* &quot;H&quot;(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;): &quot;Plato made Socrates hit Aristotle.&quot;
* ∀&quot;x&quot; (&quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)): &quot;Everybody is sleeping.&quot;
* ∃&quot;z&quot; (&quot;G&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;z&quot;)): &quot;Socrates hates somebody.&quot;
* ∃x&quot; ∀y&quot; ∃&quot;z&quot; (&quot;H&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;)): &quot;Somebody made everybody hit somebody.&quot; (They may not have all hit the same person z, but they all did so &quot;because&quot; of the same person x.)
* ∀x&quot; ∃z&quot; (&quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ∧ &quot;G&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;z&quot;)): &quot;Everybody is sleeping and Socrates hates somebody.&quot;
* ∃x&quot; ∀y&quot; ∃&quot;z&quot; (&quot;G&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) ∨ &quot;H&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;)): &quot;Either Socrates hates somebody or somebody made everybody hit somebody.&quot;

==Translating sentences from a natural language into an artificial language==
Sentences in natural languages can be ambiguous, whereas the languages of the sentential logic and predicate logics are precise. Translation can reveal such ambiguities and express precisely the intended meaning.

For example, take the English sentence “Father Ted married Jack and Jill”. Does this mean Jack married Jill? In translating we might make the following assignments:
Individual Constants
* &quot;a&quot;: Father Ted
* &quot;b&quot;: Jack
* &quot;c&quot;: Jill
Predicates:
* &quot;M&quot;αβγ: α officiated at the marriage of β to γ
Using these assignments the sentence above could be translated as follows:
* &quot;M&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;): Father Ted officiated at the marriage of Jack and Jill.
* ∃x&quot; ∃y&quot; (&quot;M&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) ∧ &quot;M&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)): Father Ted officiated at the marriage of Jack to somebody and Father Ted officiated at the marriage of Jill to somebody.
* ∃x&quot; ∃y&quot; (&quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) ∧ &quot;M&quot;(&quot;y&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)): Somebody officiated at the marriage of Father Ted to Jack and somebody officiated at the marriage of Father Ted to Jill.
To establish which is the correct translation of “Father Ted married Jack and Jill”, it would be necessary to ask the speaker exactly what was meant.

==Philosophical significance==

Atomic sentences are of particular interest in philosophical logic and the theory of truth and, it has been argued, there are corresponding atomic facts.

An atomic sentence (or possibly the &quot;meaning&quot; of an atomic sentence) is called an elementary proposition by Ludwig Wittgenstein and an atomic proposition by Bertrand Russell:
* &quot;4.2 The sense of a proposition is its agreement and disagreement with possibilities of existence and non-existence of states of affairs. 4.21 The simplest kind of proposition, an elementary proposition, asserts the existence of a state of affairs.&quot; — Wittgenstein, &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;.
* &quot;A proposition (true or false) asserting an atomic fact is called an atomic proposition.&quot; — Russell, &quot;Introduction to &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;&quot;
* See also and especially regarding &quot;elementary proposition&quot; and &quot;atomic proposition&quot; as discussed by Russell and Wittgenstein

Note the distinction between an &quot;elementary/atomic proposition&quot; and an &quot;atomic fact&quot;.

No atomic sentence can be deduced from (is not entailed by) any other atomic sentence, no two atomic sentences are incompatible, and no sets of atomic sentences are self-contradictory. Wittgenstein made much of this in his &quot;Tractatus&quot;. If there are any atomic sentences then there must be &quot;atomic facts&quot; which correspond to those that are true, and the conjunction of all true atomic sentences would say all that was the case, i.e., &quot;the world&quot; since, according to Wittgenstein, &quot;The world is all that is the case&quot;. (TLP:1). Similarly the set of all sets of atomic sentences corresponds to the set of all possible worlds (all that could be the case).

The T-schema, which embodies the theory of truth proposed by Alfred Tarski, defines the truth of arbitrary sentences from the truth of atomic sentences.

The series tells the story of Prince Roger and his personal guard, the Bronze Battalion of the Empress&#x27;s Own, as they cross the hostile and alien world of Marduk where they have been marooned. 
Roger is the spoiled younger son of the Empress of the largest polity in the galaxy, the Earth-based &quot;Empire of Man&quot;. Roger, third in line to his mother&#x27;s throne, is described at the start of the series as an over-handsome, but essentially useless fop. Part of this description comes from a reputation he owes to the acts and status of his father, the Duke of New Madrid, who is estranged from the empress.

== Plot summary ==
Roger is reluctantly persuaded by his mother to travel to Leviathan, a focal planet producing &quot;grumbly oil&quot; (used in commercial products such as colognes), to represent the royal family at a local celebration. Due to sabotage during the voyage, Roger; one company of the Bronze Battalion of the Empress&#x27; Own, bodyguards to the Heir Tertius of the Empire; his valet; his tutor and chief of staff (a staff of one); and four shuttle craft pilots are forced to land on Marduk, a largely unexplored and quite obscure planet officially, and loosely, a planet in the Empire of Man. Marduk, an extremely humid and rainy planet over much of its surface, is home to a species of four-armed sentient amphibians referred to as Mardukans (or unofficially, scummies), as well as a large number of generally hostile lifeforms of a very active biota.

Roger and Bravo Company of the Bronze Barbarians (his Imperial Marine bodyguards) must travel across Marduk from their crash site, a salt flat, to the only spaceport on the planet, where they plan to obtain a starship and return to civilization. Because there are hostile forces in the system who seem to have the spaceport under control, they can&#x27;t merely send a distress signal. Along the way Roger and his group are forced to make alliances with a succession of local polities (of varied social types) ranging from hunter-gatherers to early gunpowder civilizations. The journey requires the Prince to shed his foppish tendencies and immature behaviors, earning the respect of the Marines who come to see their Prince in a new light. Sergeant Nimashet Despreaux becomes attracted to the Prince, particularly after his more capable and effective potential is revealed, and Roger in turn with her, leading to a romantic tensions in the midst of the long march.

Roger and the diminishing Company, supported by a growing group of Mardukan allies, eventually find their way to the spaceport and off the planet, but not before Roger learns that his siblings (and their families) have been killed and that the Empire (and some beyond) believes that Roger himself was responsible. In fact, Roger&#x27;s biological father, the Duke of New Madrid, and his ally, Prince Jackson Adoula, set up the sabotage of his ship, and have framed Roger for the crime, he being conveniently lost and certainly dead. They have also taken the Empress captive, using a combination of cybernetic tampering, torture, sexual slavery, and drugs to control the normally ironwilled Empress. The conspirators plan to put a second son of New Madrid (being matured in an incubator) and the Empress on the Throne.

Roger and the remaining 14 members of Bravo Company return to Earth, set themselves up as restaurateurs, make contact with former members of the Empress&#x27;s Own, and with considerable difficulty, successfully launch a counter-coup. With the Empress rescued, the fetus destroyed by one of the conspirators&#x27; followers, and New Madrid in custody, Roger must cope with his mother&#x27;s severely damaged condition, a half-destroyed navy, rebuilding the palace, restoring the line of succession, and with the very nearly inevitable threat of civil war thanks to the escape of Jackson Adoula. The fourth novel ends with the Empress abdicating the throne due to her condition, leaving Roger to reign as Emperor of the Throne of Man over an uncertain future.

== Future novels ==
Both John Ringo and David Weber have said that they plan on writing more &quot;Empire of Man&quot; novels, Ringo going so far as to reveal that, after &quot;We Few&quot;, three more books have been contracted for the series. Weber has yet to produce a formal outline for the subsequent novels, but has stated that he will not be continuing the Prince Roger storyline. Instead the novels will be prequels, focusing on Roger&#x27;s ancestor, Miranda McClintock.

Despite Weber&#x27;s earlier statements, several months later John Ringo spoke out about a possible new plan for continuing the series. If David Weber agreed, the next book to be published would take up right where the last book &quot;We Few&quot; left off. Since then three &quot;snippet&quot; chapters of an untitled &quot;Empire of Man 5&quot; novel have been posted, continuing the Prince Roger storyline.

<doc id="943473" wikidata="Q141836" url="?curid=943473" title="Maldives at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>The Maldives competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. The delegation&#x27;s participation in the Athens Olympics marked the Maldives&#x27; fifth appearance at the Summer Olympics since their debut at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Four athletes competed across two sports; Sultan Saeed and Shifana Ali in track and field, and Hassan Mubah and Aminath Rouya Hussain in swimming. None of the track or swimming athletes advanced past the first round in their events, and no Maldivian has won a medal in any events. Sultan Saeed bore the Maldives&#x27; flag during the parade of nations of the opening ceremony.

==Background==
The Maldives is an archipelagic country located in Southern Asia, situated in the Indian Ocean. Formerly a protectorate of the United Kingdom, it gained independence in 1965. The Maldives Olympic Committee was formed in 1985, and was recognized by the International Olympic Committee the same year. The Maldives have participated in every Summer Olympics since its debut in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. The highest number of Maldivians participating at any single Summer Games was seven at the 1988 Games and the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Spain. No Maldivian has ever won a medal at the Olympics.

The 2004 Summer Olympics were held from 13 to 29 August 2004. For the 2004 Summer Olympics, the Maldives sent a delegation of four athletes. The Maldivian team at the 2004 Games featured two track and field athletes and two swimmers. Sprinters Sultan Saeed and Shifana Ali were chosen to compete in the men&#x27;s 100 metres and women&#x27;s 400 metres respectively. Swimmers Hassan Mubah and Aminath Rouya Hussain participated in the men&#x27;s 50 metre freestyle and women&#x27;s 50 metre freestyle respectively. Hassan Mubah was the only returning athlete from the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Sprinter Sultan Saeed was the flagbearer for the Maldives during the parade of nations of the opening ceremony.

==Athletics==
Making his Summer Olympics debut, Sultan Saeed carried the Maldivian flag at the opening ceremony. He was the oldest person to represent the nation at the 2004 games at the age of 28. Saeed qualified for the 2004 Athens Games as a wildcard, without competing in any notable sporting event. He competed in the 100 metres on 21 August in Heat 3 against eight other athletes. He ran a time of 11.72 seconds, finishing last of the eight athletes competing. Comoros&#x27;s Hadhari Djaffar placed ahead of him with a time of 10.62 seconds, in a heat led by United States&#x27;s Justin Gatlin who posted a time of 10.07 seconds, 1.65 seconds quicker than Saeed&#x27;s time. Out of 84 athletes, Saeed ranked last out 80 athletes that started. He was 1.29 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the quarter-finals. Therefore, that was the end of his competition.

Competing at her first Summer Olympics, Shifana Ali qualified for the 2004 Athens Games after being granted a wildcard place as she had not competed in any notable sporting event. She competed in the 400 metres on 21 August against 42 other athletes. She finished 40th with a time of 1 minute and 0.92 seconds. China&#x27;s Bo Fanfang ranked ahead of her with a time of 56.01 seconds. By comparison, the woman who won the gold medal, The Bahamas&#x27; Tonique Williams-Darling, posted a time of 49.42 seconds, 11.5 seconds faster than Shifana&#x27;s time.

;Women
==Swimming==

Hassan Mubah represented the Maldives as a swimmer in the men&#x27;s 50 metre freestyle, and was the only male Maldivian athlete participating in swimming that year. This marked his second appearance at the Olympics after participating in the 2000 Summer Olympics. During the qualification round on 19 August, Mubah competed against seven other athletes. He finished the event in 27.71 seconds, ranking seventh in his heat behind Libya&#x27;s Khaled Ghezzawi (27.55 seconds), who placed sixth, and ahead of Uganda&#x27;s Edgar Luberenga (27.77 seconds) who placed eight. His heat was led by Mauritian swimmer Chris Hackel (25.33 seconds) and Cameroon&#x27;s Cole Shade Sule (26.16 seconds). Of the 86 participants in the qualification round, Mubah ranked 73rd. He did not advance to the later rounds.

Aminath Rouya Hussain represented the Maldives at the Athens Olympics as a swimmer participating in the women&#x27;s 50 meters freestyle. Rouya was 13 years old when she participated in the 50 meters freestyle. During the qualification round of the event, which took place on August 20, Rouya participated in the third heat against seven other athletes. She completed the event in 31.26 seconds, placing last in the event behind Jordan&#x27;s Samar Nassar (30.83 seconds). Of the 75 athletes, Rouya ranked 65th along with Tracy Ann Route from the Federated States of Micronesia. She did not advance to later rounds.

<doc id="943484" wikidata="Q4761359" url="?curid=943484" title="Andy Stochansky">
<text>Andy Stochansky is a musician and songwriter from Toronto, Canada, currently living in Los Angeles, United States.

== Early years ==
Born and raised in Toronto, Stochansky began tinkering with the family piano at the age of five. To stop him from making music with anything he could get his hands on, his parents bought him a toy drum kit. By the time he was in his 20s, he had become a touring studio musician for Ani DiFranco. With DiFranco, Stochansky played 150 shows a year for seven years, until he felt it was time to start expressing himself beyond the drums.

== Solo career ==
He switched instruments, taking up guitar and piano, and released his solo debut album, Radio Fusebox. Critics called it one of the best albums of the year. Radio Fusebox won the 2000 Canadian Juno Award for Best Album Design (Michael Wrycraft - Creative Director).
&quot;The press was so amazing but I wanted to switch gears and make more of a song record, something definitely different than Fusebox. I didn&#x27;t want to repeat myself . The day after my final Fusebox Tour show, I started writing something on the long drive home that would set me on a new course so I wrote &quot;Stutter&quot;.
He quickly had 25 new songs and wanted to let anyone hear them. He was approached by an independent promoter in California who wanted to know if he would play six shows in and around Los Angeles. On the second night of that tour, Stochansky was approached by 3 different record companies, all wanting to sign him. One of these was RCA Victor.
In the summer of 2001, 5 Star Motel was released. The album was produced by Ian Lefevre. Two songs, &quot;Wonderful (It&#x27;s Superman)&quot;, produced by Dennis Herring (Elvis Costello, Counting Crows, Modest Mouse), and &quot;Stutter,&quot; produced by Tom Rothrock ( Beck/Elliott Smith ) received considerable radio attention. Songs from this record would appear in TV shows and movie soundtracks. Stochansky kept writing: &quot;Anywhere, anytime I would have the guitar in my hands or steal away with headphones and mini keyboard I was truly addicted&quot;.
Stochansky chose Goo Goo Dolls frontman Johnny Rzeznik to produce his follow-up album, 100 Out of all the people I talked to to produce this, his absolute love of songwriting, had me sold. Although the album was completed and mastered, a restructuring of the RCA record company, along with the firing of the very people who signed him, put Stochansky out on his own and he decided to pitch the songs to be able to get traction while figuring his own live career. The first would-be single from 100, &quot;Shine,&quot; was covered by Australian artist Shannon Noll. The song was an immediate hit and holds the record for most weeks at Number One on the Australian Airplay Chart. A second single, &quot;House of Gold&quot;, received radio success for Stochansky himself when released in Canada on the Canadian independent label Linus. Noll would have another Top 10 single again the following year when he covered &quot;Loud&quot;, another song from 100.

Andy is now making his next full-length record and is hitting the road soon.( 2024 )

== Writing career ==
Stochansky was solely concentrating on writing / producing for and with other artists. He resides full-time in Los Angeles.

Just some of the writing highlights include:

*&quot;Pale&quot; and &quot;Wherever You Go&quot;, both co-written with Lola Lennox and produced by Annie Lennox, received considerable BBC radio airplay.

<doc id="943485" wikidata="Q5614346" url="?curid=943485" title="Guavaween">
<text>Guavaween was an annual Latin-flavored Halloween celebration which took place on the last Saturday of October in the historic neighborhood of Ybor City on Tampa, Florida. It was named after Tampa&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Big Guava&quot;.

Since its inception more than 30 years ago, Guavaween became one of the largest festivals in Ybor. The daylight hours were family-oriented and in the past had included such activities as a costume contest, scavenger hunt, safe trick-or-treat at Centro Ybor, food and amusement rides. Around dusk, the Mama Guava Stumble Parade, Guavaween&#x27;s most popular attraction, made its way down Seventh Avenue, the main street in Ybor. The parade, led by Mama Guava, featured floats and costumed individuals who threw candy and beads to the spectators.

==History==

===Historical roots===

In the 1880s, Spanish-born and New York-based Gavino Gutierrez came to the area to search for wild guava trees that might be cultivated commercially. He didn&#x27;t find usable trees, but he liked the small town of Tampa. After leaving the area, Gutierrez stopped by Key West to visit his friend, cigar manufacturer Vicente Martinez-Ybor. Ybor was looking for a place to relocate his prosperous business, and Gutierrez recommended Tampa. Ybor took his advice and eventually founded Ybor City, helping Tampa grow from a small village to a bustling city over the next few decades.

Referencing this local history in the 1970s, local newspaper columnist Steve Otto planted the idea that if New York City is the &quot;Big Apple&quot;, then Tampa must be the &quot;Big Guava&quot;. The nickname stuck.

===Early Guavaween===
According to a well known area artist and college professor of art, prior to Mama Guava and Guavaween, many (then) young artists were sharing loft spaces in an old closed cigar factory in the late 1970s and decided to throw a large Halloween party and charge all who attended $1.00. The party was a success. The artists continued the party in subsequent years, and the crowds grew as word spread. Somehow, from the artist&#x27;s original Halloween Parties, Guavaweens, well as the first Artists and Writers Ball, evolved. The first Artists and Writers Ball was given at the Cuban Club in their courtyard. The Tampa Tribune was the sponsor of that affair, which featured many bands and entertainers. It was a giant success as people from all walks of life joined, sharing tables, eating, drinking and dancing the night away.

The Artists and Writers Ball did not originally start from these Halloween Parties, but started as an underground alternative to Gasparilla. The Artists and Writers Group (Bud Lee, Peggy Lee, David Audet, Paul Wilborn, Beverly Coe and Bebe Williams) was the impetus behind The Artists and Writers Ball. It was traditionally held in early February around the time of Gasparilla.

=== The End of Guavaween ===
Guavaween in its heyday reached an estimated attendance of 120,000 people, but with that brought problems of property damage, arrests and medical emergencies. The following year, the area was enclosed by fencing to aid in crowd control. In 1992, the Artists and Writers Ball who had co-sponsored the event parted ways with the Ybor Chamber of Commerce, which was the other major sponsor. As the cost of the event increased and the funds decreased, it was decided in 1995 to begin to charge admission. The event continued to be strong, with artists such as Rihanna performing in 2005, just a few months after the American release of her first album in August. During these years, the activity continued to struggle with its image, with the attendees pushing the envelope on dress and behavior and the local chamber of commerce and the city council concerned about the image projected. At the same time the costs to host the activity continued to rise seeing the entry fee of $4 in 1994 increase to $17 in 2015. As prices increased efforts were made to decrease expenses. The first step was to remove motorized vehicles from the parade in 2009, which allowed them to eliminate the barriers between the attendees and the parade for an estimated savings of $4,000. 2009 brought with it other changes as well; it had an attendance of only 15,000 people. Using horses to draw the floats in 2009 simply did not prove effective and by 2012 the parade had been eliminated. In 2015, the death throes of Guavaween had started. The fencing came down and the entrance fee eliminated, resulting in the elimination of the ability of attendees to consume alcohol since the city ban on drinking in the streets returned. The activity lost more patrons with this move and a loss of income from ticket sales. The last attempt to revitalize the event was the hiring of an outside event firm to organize the event. They changed the activity from a street party attracting tens of thousands to a music festival. Part of the reasoning was that the roots of the event stemmed for the ideas of the Artists and Writers Ball. The event now changed from an outdoor activity to indoor music at selected locations throughout Ybor. Ticket prices now were $20 the day of the event and $85 for VIP tickets. It also morphed to a strictly adult event since all venues served alcohol, preventing anyone under 21 from attending, which hurt attendance even more since in the past many of the attendees were local college students and other young adults. At this point, attendance had dropped below 5,000.The contract signed with the event company was for 3 years, finishing in 2017. In 2018, the official Guavaween website was made available for purchase. The last Facebook update was in 2016.

==Events==
The celebration attracted over 100,000 people from all over the world and not only featured the stumble parade, costume contest and live national and local concerts, but had become a full day of fun for folks of all ages. Guavaween Family FunFest filled the streets between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. offering exciting activities for the young and old alike. Activities included a scavenger hunt, safe trick-or-treating, live music, food, rides, contests and the Children&#x27;s Costume Contest and Parade.

For twenty years, the ornately decorated Mama Guava led her loyal band of followers and revelers in the Mama Guava Stumble Parade. Mama Guava claimed stake to &quot;taking the &#x27;bore&#x27; out of Ybor.&quot; After 4:00 p.m., Mama Guava welcomed her adult revelers and the evening party got under way. Guavaween was a party that acted as the primary fundraiser for the Ybor City Chamber of Commerce. Guavaween served to preserve Tampa&#x27;s oldest city.

It was quite common for both adults and children to attend Guavaween in costume. Things tended to become more risqué during the evening hours. Parking could be extremely difficult in Ybor during Guavaween. Shuttle buses ran from Florida State Fairgrounds, Raymond James Stadium, Tampa Port Authority, and University of South Florida Sun Dome.

<doc id="943509" wikidata="Q3314812" url="?curid=943509" title="Westray Mine">
<text>The Westray Mine was a Canadian coal mine in Plymouth, Nova Scotia. Westray was owned and operated by Curragh Resources Incorporated (Curragh Inc.), which obtained both provincial and federal government money to open the mine, and supply the local electric power utility with coal.

The mine opened in September 1991, but closed eight months later when it was the site of an underground methane explosion on May 9, 1992, killing all 26 miners working underground at the time. The week-long attempts to rescue the miners were widely followed by national media until it was obvious there would be no survivors.

About a week later, the Nova Scotia government ordered a public inquiry to look into what caused one of Canada&#x27;s deadliest mining disasters, and published its findings in late 1997. The report stated that the mine was mismanaged, miners&#x27; safety was ignored, and poor oversight by government regulators led to the disaster. A criminal case against two mine managers went to trial in the mid-1990s, but ultimately was dropped by the crown in 1998, as it seemed unlikely that a conviction could be attained. Curragh Resources went bankrupt in 1993, partially due to the disaster.

One hundred and seventeen miners became unemployed almost immediately after the explosion; they were paid 12 weeks&#x27; severance six years after the mine&#x27;s closure, but only when the provincial government was pressured to intervene. The mine was dismantled and permanently sealed in November 1998.

==Background==
Following the closure of the last working mine in the 1970s, Pictou County&#x27;s hopes for a mining renaissance were revived with the announcement of a proposed mine in the region in the late 1980s. The timing was perfect, politically, since the region had elected a fledgling leader of the federal opposition, Brian Mulroney, in a 1983 by-election in Central Nova. Following the election of a federal Conservative-led government, Elmer MacKay became a Tory political heavyweight in the riding. Provincially, the area was also home to Conservative premier Donald Cameron. Money was made available to Toronto company Curragh Resources for establishing a mine.

A rail spur was built off the CN Rail main line at Stellarton which crossed the East River of Pictou to the mine site in Plymouth. The coal from the mine would be transferred by dedicated unit trains to feed the nearby Trenton Generating Station operated by Nova Scotia Power Company which was a provincial Crown corporation at the time; the actual rail cars would be constructed at the nearby TrentonWorks rail car plant which was struggling for orders. Subsequently, the 37 cars, CN 347000–347036, were built by National Steel Car at Hamilton, Ontario, during November and December 1991.

==Mine opens==
On September 11, 1991, the mine was opened to great local fanfare, but immediately problems began to surface, when multiple roof collapses occurred within the first few months. Two months prior to the opening, MLA Bernie Boudreau wrote to Nova Scotia labour minister Leroy Legere, asking why the mine was using potentially dangerous mining methods not approved for coal mining. The labour ministry gave Curragh Inc. a special permit to use these methods to tunnel until they reached the coal seam, but not actually mine coal.

Legere was not aware that the company continued to use these methods, three months after the mine opened. Accusations were made by mine workers of company cutbacks in safety training and equipment and of negligent and outright criminal behaviour toward safety inspections. Miners complained about working in deep coal dust. In November 1991, coal miner Carl Guptill made safety complaints to labour ministry inspectors, but they were not investigated, and he was fired in January 1992 for making his claims.

==The disaster==
On Saturday, May 9, 1992, methane gas and subsequent coal dust explosions at 5:18 a.m. ADT killed 26 miners. It was Canada&#x27;s worst mining disaster since 1958, when a bump at another Nova Scotia coal mine in Springhill claimed the lives of 75 miners.

In the wake of the explosion, Canadian and international media coverage descended upon the tiny hamlet of Plymouth and the nearby towns of New Glasgow, Stellarton, Westville and Trenton. Coverage gripped Canadians for several days as teams of drägerman searched the debris-strewn depths of the mine for survivors.

Over the next several days, media reported non-stop from a community centre located across the road from the mine, while rescue teams encountered extremely hazardous conditions underground. Westray officials did not cooperate well with the media, which affected the release of information.

The bodies of 15 miners were discovered and, afterward, the search and rescue was changed to a search and recovery operation. After underground conditions worsened, the decision was made to abandon recovery efforts, entombing the bodies of 11 miners in the depths of the mine.

The 117 miners who were not working on shift at the time had to wait almost six years before they were given 12 weeks&#x27; severance pay, plus accumulated interest. The miners were only paid after years of legal battles, when the Nova Scotia government ordered the severance to be paid in 1998.

===Cause of death===
The 15 miners whose bodies were recovered all died within one minute of the explosion&#x27;s ignition, according to autopsies and external medical examinations. The majority of the bodies were found to have very high concentrations of carbon monoxide; this would cause death in 20 seconds to one minute. At least three bodies showed injuries consistent with blunt force trauma, causing several injuries, each of which would have been fatal. All of the recovered bodies showed signs of burning, ranging from superficial charring to fourth degree burns. Of the recovered miners, 13 were identified visually.

According to dragermen, one body was located but could not be removed from the mine. This was due to the body being crushed and trapped within machinery which had been compacted by the explosion. The remaining 10 miners, whose bodies were never located, were believed to have been killed instantly. Their working areas suffered the most comprehensive destruction in the mine, with many large rockfalls. It is considered unlikely that any of these miners survived the explosion.

===Trial===
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) started their probe into the explosion, around the time the search and rescue was called off in May. On September 17, RCMP investigators re-entered the mine with a draeger team to gather evidence for criminal prosecution, and managed to enter the &quot;southwest main&quot; shaft where the remaining miners&#x27; bodies were located and the explosion&#x27;s suspected epicentre.

On October 5, 1992, Westray Coal and four of its managers were charged with 52 non-criminal counts of operating an unsafe mine under the Nova Scotia &quot;Occupational Health and Safety Act&quot; by the Nova Scotia Department of Labour. That December 34 charges were withdrawn by John Pearson, the province&#x27;s director of public prosecutions. On March 4, 1993, the remaining non-criminal charges were withdrawn by Pearson, who expressed concern that they might jeopardize future criminal charges. At the time, no criminal charges were laid by the RCMP.

Two of the mine&#x27;s managers, Gerald Phillips and Roger Parry, were charged with 26 counts of manslaughter and criminal negligence causing death. Throughout the trial, the Crown was reluctant to provide full disclosure in accordance with the Criminal Code. It was necessary for the trial judge, Mr. Justice Robert Anderson, to specifically order disclosure of:
On February 1, 1995, nearly three years after the incident, the Crown disclosed 17 new documents that had been in their possession for at least two years, and about which they had unilaterally made a decision that there would be no disclosure. The Crown brought a motion to remove Justice Anderson from the case, and ask for a mistrial, stemming from Anderson calling the province&#x27;s director of public prosecutions, Martin Herschorn, requesting lead Crown prosecutor Herman Felderhof be removed for incompetence. The motion was heard by Anderson, and he ruled that he did not show bias when he phoned Herschorn, thereby dismissing it on March 14.

On June 9, 1995, the charges were stayed by Justice Anderson on the grounds that prosecutors had deliberately failed to disclose key evidence to the defence. The stay was appealed to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, which ordered a new trial on November 30, 1995, stating that Justice Anderson showed bias, and committed errors in law when he stayed the trial. The order for a new trial was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada on March 20, 1997, which criticized the trial judge for having called the director of prosecutions during the trial to complain about the manner in which prosecutors were conducting the case.

Two years after the Supreme Court ordered a new trial, prosecutors decided not to further pursue the charges on June 29, 1999, because they determined there was not enough evidence to secure convictions. In April 2000, a government report on the case&#x27;s mishandling by the crown prosecutors was issued. This report recommended that special prosecutors&#x27; services should be set up to deal with cases involving major cases, and recommended that they also employ outside experts.

===Inquiry===
Six days after the explosion, the Nova Scotia provincial government launched a public inquiry into the Westray Mine and the safety issues resulting from the explosion. The commission was headed by Justice Kenneth Peter Richard of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The Inquiry was originally supposed to start hearings in mid-October, but lawyers representing senior Westray Coal employees successfully got it delayed on September 30 – on the basis that they thought the Inquiry was unconstitutional – because it would prevent their clients from receiving a fair trial, if they were ever charged. Nova Scotia Chief Justice Constance Glube ruled, on November 13, that the inquiry was unconstitutional, because she viewed it as a criminal investigation that would force deponents to incriminate themselves. Her decision was appealed, and a Nova Scotia Court of Appeals Tribunal ruled on January 19, 1993, that the inquiry was constitutional, but could only continue once all charges went through the court system, to preserve the employees&#x27; right to a fair trial.

When the inquiry resumed in 1995, Clifford Frame, the founder, principal shareholder, developer and chairman and CEO of Curragh Inc., the company whose subsidiary operated the mine, refused to take the stand and testify. Another powerful Curragh Inc. manager, Marvin Pelley, the former president of Westray, also refused to testify. The report was released on December 1, 1997, and recommended a sweeping overhaul of all provincial labour and mining laws and departments. Most of the report&#x27;s recommendations were implemented.

===Legislation===
As a result of the failure to successfully prosecute the mine&#x27;s owners and managers, the Canadian Labour Congress and some of its affiliates initiated an intense lobbying campaign in the mid-1990s to amend the Criminal Code of Canada in order to hold criminally liable managers and directors of corporations that failed to take steps to protect the lives of their employees. Using the tactic of having a private member&#x27;s bill introduced, typically by an MP from the New Democratic Party or the Bloc Québécois, this agenda was advanced. Each time that the House of Commons was prorogued, the private members bill would die on the order paper, and the process would start again in the next session of Parliament. On about the fifth attempt, in late 2003, the federal government enacted Bill C-45 (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Westray Bill&quot;) in direct response to the Westray Mine disaster.

The new law came into effect March 31, 2004. The bill provided a new regime outlining the framework of corporate liability in Canada. It also provided a new punishment scheme to allow the Courts not simply to fine corporations, but also to put them on probation to ensure that the offences were not repeated. However, some observers believed Bill C-45 was largely seen as an exercise of political posturing by the federal government, as it is doubtful that the new provisions would have had any effect on the legal implications of the disaster; due to the division of powers in the Canadian Constitution, the province is the only government that would be able to enact any real change.

Conversely, the United Steelworkers, the union that represented the miners and that spearheaded the lobbying effort, touted the law as an important new tool with which to hold accountable corporate leadership in on-the-job disasters. The key amendment to the Criminal Code reads as follows: &quot;217.1 Every one who undertakes, or has the authority, to direct how another person does work or performs a task is under a legal duty to take reasonable steps to prevent bodily harm to that person, or any other person, arising from that work or task.&quot;

===Memorial===

Today, a memorial sits in a park in nearby New Glasgow at the approximate location above ground where the remaining 11 miners are trapped. The memorial lands were protected by the Nova Scotia government and further mineral exploration is prohibited within the 250-acre site. The memorial&#x27;s central monument, engraved with the names and ages of the twenty-six men who lost their lives in the disaster states, &quot;Their light shall always shine.&quot;

==Razing of mine site==
The former mine site was mostly razed in 1998. When the two 15-storey blue concrete coal storage silos were demolished on November 27, 1998, the most visible reminder of the tragedy was erased. The damaged mine shaft had been permanently sealed following the decision to abort further recovery attempts in May 1992 and after investigations were completed.

==Related works==

The disaster was the subject of a 2001 National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;Westray&quot;, written and directed by Paul Cowan. The film included dramatic reenactments by three Westray widows – Harriet Munroe, Vicki Drolet and Bernadette Feltmate – as well as miners Wayne Cheverie, Fraser Agnew and Carl Guptill. The film won the award for best documentary at the 22nd Genie Awards.

An exhibit at the Nova Scotia Museum of Industry in nearby Stellarton explores the history of the mine and the disaster. Leo McKay Jr. wrote an acclaimed fictionalization about these events, in the novel &quot;Twenty Six&quot;. The band Weeping Tile recorded a song about the disaster, entitled Westray. Different arrangements of the song were featured on their 1994 album Eepee and their 1996 album &quot;Cold Snap&quot;. The song was written by band member Sarah Harmer.

<doc id="943511" wikidata="Q1723529" url="?curid=943511" title="1917 Canadian federal election">
<text>The 1917 Canadian federal election (sometimes referred to as the khaki election) was held on December 17, 1917, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 13th Parliament of Canada. Described by historian Michael Bliss as the &quot;most bitter election in Canadian history&quot;, it was fought mainly over the issue of conscription (see Conscription Crisis of 1917). The election resulted in Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden&#x27;s Unionist government elected with a strong majority and the largest percentage of the popular vote for any party in Canadian history.

The previous election had been held in 1911 and was won by Borden&#x27;s Conservatives. Normally, there is a constitutional requirement that Parliament last no longer than five years, which would have resulted in an election in 1916. However, citing the emergency of the Great War, the Parliament of Canada approved a one-year extension, which was implemented by the British Parliament. The Borden government hoped that the delay would allow the formation of a &quot;grand coalition&quot; government, encompassing all the parties, such as existed in Britain.

Sir Wilfrid Laurier, head of the Liberal Party of Canada, refused to join the coalition over the issue of conscription, which was strongly opposed in the Liberal heartland of Quebec. Laurier worried that agreeing to Borden&#x27;s coalition offer would cause that province to abandon the Liberals and perhaps even Canada. Borden proceeded to form a &quot;Unionist&quot; government, and the Liberal Party split over the issue. Many English Canadian Liberal MPs and provincial Liberal parties in English Canada supported the new Unionist government.

To ensure victory for conscription, Borden introduced two laws to skew the voting towards the government. The first, the &quot;Wartime Elections Act&quot;, disenfranchised conscientious objectors and Canadian citizens if they were born in enemy countries and had arrived after 1902. The law also gave female relatives of servicemen the vote. Thus, the 1917 election was the first federal election in which some women were allowed to vote. The other new law was the &quot;Military Voters Act&quot;, which allowed soldiers serving abroad to choose which riding their vote would be counted in or to allow the party for which they voted to select the riding in which the vote would be counted. That allowed government officials to guide the strongly pro-conscription soldiers into voting in those ridings where they would be more useful. Servicemen were given a ballot with the simple choice of &quot;Government&quot; or &quot;Opposition&quot;. It is calculated that the Unionist government took 14 seats from the Opposition due to its use of Army votes.

Soon after these measures were passed, Borden convinced a faction of Liberals (using the name Liberal-Unionists) along with Gideon Decker Robertson, who was described as a &quot;Labour&quot; Senator (but was unaffiliated with any Labour Party) to join with them, forming the Unionist government in October 1917. He then dissolved parliament to seek a mandate in the election, which pitted &quot;Government&quot; candidates, running as the Unionist Party, against the anti-conscription faction of the Liberal Party, which ran under the name Laurier Liberals. As well, Independent, Labour and Socialist candidates ran in many ridings across the country.

The divisive debate ended with the country divided on linguistic lines. The Liberals won 82 seats, 62 in Quebec, with many other seats won in provinces such as Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Ontario in ridings with significant French Canadian populations. The Unionists won 153 seats. The three Unionist won seats in Quebec were all in mainly English-speaking ridings. That led to the Francœur Motion in January 1918.

Out of 235 seats, 33 were won by acclamation—17 to the Laurier Liberals (all in Quebec) and 16 to the Unionists (all outside Quebec). Two of the Unionist acclamations were for the riding of Halifax, where the only candidates were two Unionists, and where, eleven days earlier, the tragic Halifax Explosion had taken place.

The election was conducted mostly using First past the post in single-member ridings but Ottawa, Queens, and Halifax each had two members and each of the voters there cast up to two votes as per Plurality block voting.

<text>Barbados competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This nation marked its ninth appearance at the Olympics, except the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the United States boycott.

The Barbados Olympic Association sent the nation&#x27;s smallest team to the Games since the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. A total of ten athletes, nine men and one woman, competed only in five different sports. Half of them had previously competed in Sydney, including track star and Olympic bronze medalist Obadele Thompson, and four-time Olympic skeet shooter Michael Maskell, who later became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Barbados left Athens without a single Olympic medal, although Thompson managed to achieve a seventh-place finish in the 100 metres as the nation&#x27;s highest result.

<doc id="943516" wikidata="Q4597455" url="?curid=943516" title="2000 Fort Worth tornado outbreak">
<text>During the evening hours of March 28, 2000, an intense F3 tornado struck Downtown Fort Worth, Texas, causing significant damage to numerous buildings and skyscrapers as well as two deaths. The tornado was part of a larger severe weather outbreak that caused widespread storms across Texas and Oklahoma in late-March, spurred primarily by the moist and unstable atmospheric environment over the South Central United States as a result of an eastward-moving upper-level low and shortwave trough. The tornado outbreak was well forecast by both computer forecast models and the National Weather Service, though the eventual focal point for the severe weather—North Texas—only came into focus on March 28 as the conditions favorable for tornadic development quickly took hold.

The F3 Fort Worth tornado initially began as a relatively weak tornado in River Oaks, gradually strengthening as it tracked southeastward and then eastward towards Fort Worth&#x27;s central business district. The twister damaged 266 homes across its long and wide path, out of which 28 were destroyed. Damage surveys indicated that much of the tornado&#x27;s destruction was due to structural deficiencies in many of the older subdivisions impacted by the tornado. Various high-rise and low-rise buildings in downtown Fort Worth sustained various degrees of structural damage including numerous broken windows. Nine other tornadoes also occurred across North Texas on March 28; although most were relatively inconsequential, another strong F3 tornado struck portions of Arlington, including Arlington Municipal Airport. Aside from the two deaths caused by the tornado, a third person was killed in north Fort Worth by a fall of baseball-sized hail.

==Meteorological synopsis==

Early on March 28, an upper-level low tracked eastward into the Southern United States along with its associated shortwave trough, sending the subtropical jet through Texas and bringing along with it strong west-northwesterly winds in the upper-levels of the troposphere. Concurrently, a cold front extended zonally tracked south across the Great Plains before eventually stalling near the Red River valley, providing an additional focus area for storm development. Favorable conditions for severe weather were expected ahead of the upper-level low over areas of North Texas; accordingly, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a moderate risk for severe weather for the region, citing an unstable atmosphere caused by steep lapse rates of 7.5-8.0 °C/km and high convective available potential energy values. The environment was expected to be conducive for the development of supercells as the warped subtropical jet produced strong wind shear over Texas.

Later that day, a low-level low-pressure area developed west of Wichita Falls at the intersection of a dry line extended southward across Central Texas and the stationary front extended eastward across the Red River valley. With the low-pressure system now in place, the air mass over the Red River valley became increasingly unstable, featuring surface temperatures near and high dew points caused by the northerly surge of moisture induced by the subtropical jet. The combination of high temperatures and a moist atmosphere resulted in a favorable environment for thunderstorm development. However, despite the heat, temperatures alone were insufficient in breaking the capping inversion–an area of warmer air aloft that prevents the relativity cooler air near the surface from rising. Instead, the approaching shortwave trough provided the impetus necessary to force convection to occur, allowing for the formation of showers and thunderstorms.

Initially, computer models indicated that the day&#x27;s storms would primarily feature strong winds and hail with a minimal risk for tornadoes, with severe weather occurring mainly north of the stalled front in Oklahoma. However, conditions improved further than expected, leading the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Fort Worth, Texas to intensify its verbiage in its public forecasting products as the day progressed and highlighting areas around the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex as potential risk areas for tornadoes. Thunderstorms began to develop earnestly along the dry line as the afternoon progressed, beginning with initial storm development northeast of Abilene. The strong southwesterly winds aloft from the curved subtropical jet over the region helped to ventilate the storms, allowing for their persistence and intensity. The SPC issued its first of two tornado watches for the event at 2:53 p.m. CST (20:53 UTC) for portions of southern Oklahoma and North-Central Texas. The most favorable environment for tornadoes was initially over the Red River but shifted southward to include the Dallas–Fort Worth area in the evening hours. As storms continued to develop along a line paralleling Interstate 35, some storms congealed into a mesoscale convective system near the Metroplex; this cluster of storms produced both F3 tornadoes in Fort Worth and Arlington. The complex of storms eventually evolved into a transient bow echo that continued to track eastward into Louisiana. Elsewhere, supercells continued to propagate eastward across North and South-Central Texas along the dry line, slowly weakening after sunset.

==Confirmed tornadoes==
===March 28 event===
===Fort Worth, Texas===

The thunderstorm that would eventually produce the infamous F3 tornado in Fort Worth developed from a cluster of storms that formed west of the city. At 4:38 p.m. CST (22:38 UTC), a severe thunderstorm warning was issued on the quickly organizing storm for Parker County. About an hour later, another severe thunderstorm warning was issued, this time for Tarrant County, as the storm continued to track eastward. Radar imagery showed that the supercell was rapidly organizing, developing a bounded weak echo region and hook echo—radar signatures that hint at a strong and potentially tornadic thunderstorm—in less than a half-hour. Radar also indicated that a broad mesocyclone had developed by around 6:00 p.m. CST (00:00 UTC), extending vertically through the entirety of the supercell. At around the same time, a wall cloud was spotted in association with the rotating thunderstorm while baseball-sized hail fell ahead of the rotation in northern Fort Worth along I-820. Winds from the downdraft of another small thunderstorm south of Fort Worth allowed the strengthening supercell to organize further. At 6:10 p.m. (00:10 UTC), a tornado warning was issued for Tarrant County, and accordingly emergency sirens were activated in the Fort Worth a minute later.

The tornado touched down at 6:18 p.m. CST (00:18 UTC) near Castleberry High School northwest of downtown Fort Worth. Initially, the tornado lacked a condensation funnel, and could only be visually identified as dust swirls near the ground beneath the rotating wall cloud aloft; the tornado maintained this appearance for the first five minutes of its lifespan, after which a condensation funnel eventually developed. The first signs of damage occurred in the River Oaks area along SH 183 where metal roof panels were stripped off of a vacant fast food restaurant. After crossing the highway, the tornado inflicted sporadic F0 damage to an older residential area, breaking tree branches and causing some damage to outbuildings; a few chimneys were toppled off of homes. At the time, the tornado&#x27;s damage path was only a few hundred feet wide. A roof of a home near Roberts Cut Off Road was partially removed, signifying the first instance of F1 damage. Several large and rotted trees were uprooted by the tornado&#x27;s strong winds as it moved through the area. The tornado then passed directly over Castleberry High School, causing significant damage to the school&#x27;s field house. Tornadic debris—including rooftop air conditioning units, gravel, and other detached construction—was thrown by the tornado at the school&#x27;s western façade, causing minor damage. Throughout River Oak, three homes sustained major damage while 51 others experienced minor damage.

The tornado crossed the Trinity River and dealt F1 or greater damage to over a hundred homes in the adjacent subdivision. Some roofs sustained partial roof loss and many large trees either lost limbs or were toppled. At the intersection of West Sixth Street and University Drive, the tornado abruptly turned east from its initial southeast heading, bringing it over the Linwood subdivision at around 6:22 p.m. CST (00:22 UTC). The homes in the neighborhood were mostly small, wood-framed structures on pier or beam foundations, making them highly vulnerable to the tornadic winds and resulting in widespread structural failure. A survey conducted by the Wind Damage and Engineering Program at Texas Tech University later concluded that many of the buildings that suffered total structural failure did so due to structural deficiencies rather than the strong winds associated with the tornado. The tornado then passed over a Montgomery Ward distribution center, causing roof damage to the complex and overturning numerous parked trucks; one person was killed while trying to reach shelter after a truck fell on them. Another person was killed after being struck by a collapsing brick wall. Together, these two fatalities represented the only deaths associated with the Fort Worth tornado and the overall tornado outbreak. Several nearby metal buildings were toppled before the tornado once again crossed the Trinity River, entering Fort Worth&#x27;s central business district. A tornado emergency, the second one ever issued, was declared for the city by the National Weather Service.

The tornado struck several skyscrapers as it moved across downtown Fort Worth over the course of approximately a minute between 6:25 p.m CST (00:25 UTC) and 6:26 p.m. CST (00:26 UTC). The first high-rise building impacted was the nine-story Cash America building, which was nearly destroyed by the tornado. All windows on the building&#x27;s northwestern and southwestern faces were blown out by the strong winds, and the travertine stone façade framing the building&#x27;s exterior crumbled. While a number of interior partition walls and suspended ceilings collapsed, the building&#x27;s steel frame remained intact. The tornado also peeled some of the brick masonry off the dome and five-story prayer tower of a nearby Baptist church. The tornado was at its peak strength when it struck the ten-story Mallick Tower, causing the building to lose most of its glass exterior. High-speed debris thrown up by the tornado broke windows in adjacent low-rise office and condominium buildings. Similar damage occurred to several other high-rises including the 35-story Bank One Tower, which lost 80 percent of its 3,000 windows; the Union Pacific Resources Building lost 1,300 of its 5,000 windows. The tornado eventually dissipated at 6:28 p.m. CST (00:28 UTC) near Interstate 35W after having spent 10 minutes on the ground over a path and wide path. Across Fort Worth, 212 homes were damaged, of which 28 were destroyed. Although the tornado dissipated just east of downtown Fort Worth, the parent supercell thunderstorm continued to cause damage, albeit minor and sporadic, to roofs, trees, fences, and billboards roughly near Interstate 30 and Brentwood Stair Road.

===Arlington, Texas===

After the Fort Worth tornado dissipated, another thunderstorm developed over Johnson County, tracking northeastward into Tarrant County and eventually merging with the supercell that had produced the earlier F3 tornado. The new development prompted the re-issuance of the tornado warning for Tarrant County at 6:40 p.m. CST (00:40 UTC). At 7:05 p.m. CST (01:05 UTC), the Arlington tornado touched down on South Cooper Street, causing initial damage to a restaurant; the tornado&#x27;s touchdown coincided with the appearance of a tornado vortex signature on radar imagery. Well-built homes within a residential area along Embercrest Drive sustained widespread damage, with some houses experiencing up to F3-rated damage; such damage occurred after garage doors failed, allowing tornadic winds to unroof homes and push out exterior walls. As a consequence, homes that faced the tornadic winds sustained more damage than homes whose attached garages were sheltered from the strong winds. After crossing Matlock Road, the tornado did additional damage to one- and two-story homes in another subdivision, producing F3 damage. Many homes suffered the collapse of brick masonry walls due to poor construction as they were not properly anchored to the homes&#x27; frames. The tornado then swept across northern portions of the Arlington Municipal Airport, dealing F2 damage before briefly paralleling Interstate 20. At 7:12 p.m. CST (01:12 UTC), the tornado crossed the interstate, overturning at least one 18-wheeler. The tornado continued to track northeast, causing F2 damage to a subdivision northeast of Grand Prairie Municipal Airport in Dallas County before dissipating at 7:20 p.m. CST (01:20 UTC).

<text>Magda Lupescu (born Elena Lupescu; 3/15 September 1899 – 29 June 1977), later officially known as Princess Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, was the mistress and later wife of King Carol II of Romania. 
==Early life and family==
Many of the facts relating to her early life are difficult to ascertain due partly to the circumstances of the time and place, partly to unintentional mistakes and typographical errors, and partly to outright fabrications and obfuscations by her friends and enemies, and by herself. 

Elena Lupescu was the daughter of Elise (or Eliza) Lupescu (née Falk) and Nicolae Lupescu, an apothecary. Her mother was an Austrian-born Jew who converted to the Roman Catholic Church prior to her marriage. Most sources agree that Nicolae Lupescu was born Jewish and adopted his name upon conversion to Orthodox Christianity, the established religion in Romania. There are three different versions as to his surname prior to conversion—it may have been Grünberg (variant spellings &quot;Grunsberg&quot;, &quot;Grümberg&quot;, etc.); or it may have been Wolff (variant spelling &quot;Wolf&quot;); or it may have been originally Grünberg and it was later changed to Wolff. The latter version is the most common, but the first is the most probable. Many of her close relatives also chose to change their surname to Lupu, which is Wolf[f] in Romanian. The Wolff family had only been living in Romania for a generation at the time of her birth. The origin of her nickname &quot;Magda&quot;, by which she was later known, is obscure. According to Elena Lupescu herself, it was originally a mistake of an Italian journalist; but according to an alternative version, &quot;Magda&quot; was, at the time, Bucharest slang for &quot;reformed prostitute&quot;.

She had a younger brother, Constantin Schloim Lupescu.

Lupescu was raised from birth as a Catholic. She was educated at the &quot;Diaconesele&quot;, a Bucharest boarding school run by Bavarian nuns of the Institute of Mary from Nymphenburg, and one of the best schools for girls in the country.

According to Arthur Quinlan, at some point during Lupescu&#x27;s childhood, her family moved to Sulina, a port on the Danube, where Nicolae Lupescu opened an apothecary. In 1912 they moved back to Iași, where her father started a novelty shop. Not much is known of her life during Romania&#x27;s participation in World War I (1916–1918).

On 17 February 1919, in Iași, Lupescu married Ion Tâmpeanu, an officer of the Romanian Royal Army. According to Quinlan, Elena did not adapt well to garrison life and had several affairs. The marriage ended in divorce, but it is not clear when; Quinlan places it in 1920. According to Easterman, she was still married to Tâmpeanu in 1923, when she first encountered Carol. After the divorce, Elena resumed her maiden name, Lupescu. 

===Speculations about origins===
Some (e.g., Easterman, p. 81–85), suggest something mysterious about Lupescu&#x27;s origins and early life, that she may have been of royal blood, an illegitimate daughter of King Carol I, and thus a cousin of Carol II. There are three main arguments: that Romanian law at the time barred Jews from owning apothecaries, and hence there was something unusual about Elena&#x27;s father owning one; that it was unusual for a girl of Lupescu&#x27;s parentage to be accepted at one of the best schools in Bucharest; and that it was highly unusual for a Romanian army officer to be allowed to marry someone of Jewish background. A family historian recently traced the family back to Munich, Germany in the 1600&#x27;s.

There is little merit to any of these arguments. As far as Romanian law of the time went, Nicolae Lupescu ceased being a Jew upon his conversion—there was nothing preventing him from owning an apothecary. But even before his conversion, the law could have been easily circumvented in a country as rife with corruption as Romania, especially in Iași, where Jews were close to half of the city&#x27;s population. Many of Lupescu&#x27;s Jewish relatives were highly educated, they were upper middle class to wealthy pharmacists and professionals. Most of them who lived in Iași emigrated to New York during the late 1880&#x27;s and 1890&#x27;s because of newly created anti-Semitic laws barring Jews from being certain professions. The majority of her family who remained in Romania had converted. 

As to Lupescu&#x27;s education, she was a German-speaking Catholic daughter of a Catholic mother, that is, the very student who would have been most readily admitted at a school run by German nuns. But even her being Jewish would not have necessarily constituted a major obstacle. For instance, between 1890 and 1916, Jews constituted, on average, 7% of the student body of the Lycée Gheorghe Lazăr of Bucharest, a boys&#x27; school described as &quot;the school of the Romanian élite&quot;.

Finally, her marriage to an army officer would not have been problematic, because neither she nor her parents were legally Jewish, and most Romanians would not have regarded her as such. That came later, during the Great Depression in Romania, when the character of Romanian anti-Semitism gradually changed and her parents&#x27; Jewish origins were stressed for political reasons.

==Royal mistress==
According to Paul-Philippe Hohenzollern, who cites Carol&#x27;s diaries, she first met Crown Prince Carol (later King Carol II of the Romanians) in March 1923, when she was still married to Tâmpeanu. Two years later, in February 1925, Carol and Lupescu began a serious relationship, which endured until his death in 1953.

Lupescu was described as a witty and outspoken woman, a tall redhead with milky-white skin and green eyes. Other sources are less flattering, describing her features as coarse and her conversation as vulgar. All sources agree that she walked with a peculiar swing of the hips, which, depending on one&#x27;s point of view, was either sexy or crude, and that she was, in almost every respect, the opposite of Crown Princess Helen, Carol&#x27;s spouse at the time.

Carol made no effort to hide the relationship, which was, rather than his marital infidelity or Elena Lupescu&#x27;s character or background, the cause of the ensuing scandal. The scandal was aggravated by Carol&#x27;s earlier behavior (during the war he had contracted a morganatic marriage to Ioana &quot;Zizi&quot; Lambrino, although Romania&#x27;s Constitution forbade Crown Princes to marry Romanian citizens), as well as by the enmity between Carol and the very powerful Brătianu clan. It was supporters of the latter who fostered the first anti-Semitic attacks against Elena Lupescu.

In December 1925, Carol, having represented the Romanian royal family at the funeral of Queen Alexandra, eventually ended up in Milan in company of Elena Lupescu, making the front page of almost every Italian newspaper.

As marriage between the monarch and Lupescu was unconstitutional and questionable on social grounds, Carol renounced his rights to the Romanian throne, as well as his membership in the royal family, adopting the name of &quot;Carol Caraiman&quot;. The renunciation was ratified by Parliament on 4 January 1926, and four-year-old Michael, Carol&#x27;s son with Crown Princess Helen, became heir apparent; Carol was banned from returning to Romania. Helen, by that time Queen Mother, divorced Carol in 1928.

King Ferdinand, Carol&#x27;s father, died in 1927; Michael succeeded to the throne and a regency headed by Prince Nicholas, Carol&#x27;s younger brother, came into being. The regency proved unstable, and the political instability increased when Ion I. C. Brătianu, head of the Brătianu clan and leader of the National-Liberal party, died unexpectedly. His younger brothers lacked both his strength of character and his political acumen, and their hold on power weakened. In late 1928, the Liberal government was replaced by a coalition headed by Iuliu Maniu; Carol&#x27;s return seemed now to be only a matter of time. Negotiations were carried out through various intermediaries, while Carol&#x27;s supporters, including Prince Nicholas and a number of Army officers, tried to pressure the government into speeding his return. Although no written evidence exists, it is likely that eventually Carol made two promises to Maniu: that he would join the regency, rather than lay claim to the throne, and that he would give up Elena Lupescu. He intended to keep neither.

Carol returned unopposed to Romania on 7 June 1930, and immediately mounted what was essentially a constitutional &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; . His renunciation was declared invalid by Parliament with an overwhelming majority, and he was proclaimed king in short order on 8 June. When he brought Lupescu back is not clear; it may have been as early as the end of June, or it may have been August, but she was definitely in Bucharest by October. From then on, she was, in all but name, Carol&#x27;s wife and his partner in his political enterprises.

During the reign of King Carol II (1930–1940), corruption and political intrigue in Romania rose to unprecedented heights. Carol and Magda weathered economic crisis, labor unrest, the rise of Fascism, assassination attempts and military plots, to become the master manipulators of Romanian politics. Those Carol could not bribe, he forced into retirement (Maniu) or imprisoned (Ion Antonescu); those he could not bend to his will, he suppressed ruthlessly (the Legion of the Archangel Michael, also known as the Iron Guard); and, in the process, the couple accumulated an impressive fortune.

Lupescu is sometimes described as the power behind the throne, especially by those close to the extreme right. Lupescu undoubtedly enjoyed a great deal of influence of the king, but Carol&#x27;s actions were entirely consistent with his behavior prior to meeting Elena Lupescu. Moreover, the speed with which, upon his return, when she was still abroad, he outmaneuvered any opposition to his plans is ample demonstration of his political abilities. Their relationship is perhaps best viewed as a partnership, with Elena the junior, but very influential, partner.

Lupescu did not enjoy official status and until 1938 did not accompany the king on state functions. However, she entertained at her Aleea Vulpache villa in downtown Bucharest the cream of Romanian high society: politicians, industrialists (Max Auschnitt, Nicolae Malaxa), press magnates (Pamfil Șeicaru), and blue-blooded aristocrats (Marthe Bibesco). It was even rumored at some point that the leader of the violently antisemitic Iron Guard, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, might have been hiding there from the police. This rumor was never confirmed; Codreanu was a rival of Carol&#x27;s and would have been a risky person for Lupescu to shelter. In 1938 Carol orchestrated Codreanu&#x27;s arrest and, soon after, ordered his assassination. 

In 1938, Carol put an end to parliamentary democracy and proclaimed himself a dictator. But international developments were beyond his control. By the summer of 1940, France had fallen and the Versailles system had collapsed, leaving Romania friendless and almost completely surrounded by enemies. In quick succession, without firing a shot in her own defense, Romania was forced to make painful territorial concessions to the USSR, to Hungary, and to Bulgaria. Whether any government could have survived such a catastrophe is doubtful; but to survive both it and Hitler&#x27;s personal enmity was impossible.

By early September, Carol was out of options. He was forced to abdicate in favor of his son Michael (6 September); General Antonescu assumed dictatorial powers with the support of the Army and most political parties. A few days later, Carol, Magda, their faithful aide, Ernest Urdăreanu, and as many belongings as they could pack in a hurry, left Romania aboard a special train. They crossed the border in a hail of bullets: the Legionnaires of Codreanu&#x27;s Iron Guard were trying to avenge their leader. [citation needed]

==In exile==
They travelled to Spain, then to Portugal, and eventually they settled in Mexico City. When Romania joined the war on Hitler&#x27;s side, Carol explored the possibility of setting up a Romanian government in exile; but his proposals were rebuffed by both the British and the Americans. In 1944, he contacted the Soviets with a similar purpose, but Stalin never answered and developments in Romania made Carol&#x27;s proposal moot.

Lupescu did not tolerate well Mexico City&#x27;s high altitude, so in 1944 they moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. But her health did not improve; by early 1947 her condition was diagnosed as pernicious anaemia. After 22 years together, Carol and Elena Lupescu were finally married in a hotel room in Rio de Janeiro, either on 3 June 1947 or on 5 July 1947; it was Carol&#x27;s third marriage, and Elena&#x27;s second. Henceforward, she would be known as Princess Elena of Romania.

Lupescu&#x27;s health improved, but they were advised to move to a more temperate climate. Carol and Elena finally settled in Estoril, on the Portuguese Riviera. There Carol died suddenly of a heart attack in 1953. His coffin, draped with the Romanian royal standard, was placed inside the royal pantheon of the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora in Lisbon. Elena survived him by 24 years, and her coffin was eventually placed next to his.

In 2003, the coffins of King Carol II and Princess Elena of Romania were brought back to the country of their birth at the request and expense of the government of Romania. They were interred in the Curtea de Argeș Monastery complex, the traditional burial ground of Romanian royalty; but, not being of royal blood, Elena was buried in the monastery&#x27;s cemetery, rather than in the Royal Chapel.

<doc id="943527" wikidata="Q278472" url="?curid=943527" title="Virtual directory">
<text>In computing, the term virtual directory has a couple of meanings. It may simply designate (for example in IIS) a folder which appears in a path but which is not actually a subfolder of the preceding folder in the path. However, this article will discuss the term in the context of directory services and identity management.

A virtual directory or virtual directory server (VDS) in this context is a software layer that delivers a single access point for identity management applications and service platforms. A virtual directory operates as a high-performance, lightweight abstraction layer that resides between client applications and disparate types of identity-data repositories, such as proprietary and standard directories, databases, web services, and applications.

A virtual directory receives queries and directs them to the appropriate data sources by abstracting and virtualizing data. The virtual directory integrates identity data from multiple heterogeneous data stores and presents it as though it were coming from one source. This ability to reach into disparate repositories makes virtual directory technology ideal for consolidating data stored in a distributed environment. 

, virtual directory servers most commonly use the LDAP protocol, but more sophisticated virtual directories can also support SQL as well as DSML and SPML.

Industry experts have heralded the importance of the virtual directory in modernizing the identity infrastructure. According to Dave Kearns of Network World, &quot;Virtualization is hot and a virtual directory is the building block, or foundation, you should be looking at for your next identity management project.&quot; In addition, Gartner analyst, Bob Blakley said that virtual directories are playing an increasingly vital role. In his report, “The Emerging Architecture of Identity Management,” Blakley wrote: “In the first phase, production of identities will be separated from consumption of identities through the introduction of a virtual directory interface.”

==Capabilities==
Virtual directories can have some or all of the following capabilities:
* Aggregate identity data across sources to create a single point of access.
* Create high-availability for authoritative data stores.
* Act as identity firewall by preventing denial-of-service attacks on the primary data stores through an additional virtual layer.
* Support a common searchable namespace for centralized authentication.
* Present a unified virtual view of user information stored across multiple systems.
* Delegate authentication to backend sources through source-specific security means.
* Virtualize data sources to support migration from legacy data stores without modifying the applications that rely on them.
* Enrich identities with attributes pulled from multiple data stores, based on a link between user entries. 

Some advanced identity virtualization platforms can also:
* Enable application-specific, customized views of identity data without violating internal or external regulations governing identity data. Reveal contextual relationships between objects through hierarchical directory structures.
* Develop advanced correlation across diverse sources using correlation rules. 
* Build a global user identity by correlating unique user accounts across various data stores, and enrich identities with attributes pulled from multiple data stores, based on a link between user entries. 
* Enable constant data refresh for real-time updates through a persistent cache.

==Advantages ==
Virtual directories:
* Enable faster deployment because users do not need to add and sync additional application-specific data sources 
* Leverage existing identity infrastructure and security investments to deploy new services 
* Deliver high availability of data sources 
* Provide application-specific views of identity data which can help avoid the need to develop a master enterprise schema
* Allow a single view of identity data without violating internal or external regulations governing identity data
* Act as identity firewalls by preventing denial-of-service attacks on the primary data-stores and providing further security on access to sensitive data
* Can reflect changes made to authoritative sources in real-time
* Leverages existing update processes of authoritative sources, so no separate (sometimes manual) process to update a central directory is needed
* Present a unified virtual view of user information from multiple systems so that it appears to reside in a single system
* Can secure all backend storage locations with a single security policy

==Disadvantages==
An original disadvantage is public perception of &quot;push &amp; pull technologies&quot; which is the general classification of &quot;virtual directories&quot; depending on the nature of their deployment. Virtual directories were initially designed and later deployed with &quot;push technologies&quot; in mind, which also contravened with privacy laws of the United States. This is no longer the case. There are, however, other disadvantages in the current technologies.

* The classical virtual directory based on proxy cannot modify underlying data structures or create new views based on the relationships of data from across multiple systems. So if an application requires a different structure, such as a flattened list of identities, or a deeper hierarchy for delegated administration, a virtual directory is limited. 
* Many virtual directories cannot correlate same-users across multiple diverse sources in the case of duplicate users
* Virtual directories without advanced caching technologies cannot scale to heterogeneous, high-volume environments.

==Sample terminology==

* Unify metadata: Extract schemas from the local data source, map them to a common format, and link the same identities from different data silos based on a unique identifier.
* Namespace joining: Create a single large directory by bringing multiple directories together at the namespace level. For instance, if one directory has the namespace &quot;ou=internal,dc=domain,dc=com&quot; and a second directory has the namespace &quot;ou=external,dc=domain,dc=com,&quot; then creating a virtual directory with both namespaces is an example of namespace joining.
* Identity joining: Enrich identities with attributes pulled from multiple data stores, based on a link between user entries. For instance if the user joeuser exists in a directory as &quot;cn=joeuser,ou=users&quot; and in a database with a username of &quot;joeuser&quot; then the &quot;joeuser&quot; identity can be constructed from both the directory and the database.
* Data remapping: The translation of data inside of the virtual directory. For instance, mapping “uid” to “samaccountname,” so a client application that only supports a standard LDAP-compliant data source is able to search an Active Directory namespace, as well.
* Query routing: Route requests based on certain criteria, such as “write operations going to a master, while read operations are forwarded to replicas.”
* Identity routing: Virtual directories may support the routing of requests based on certain criteria (such as write operations going to a master while read operations being forwarded to replicas).
* Authoritative source: A &quot;virtualized&quot; data repository, such as a directory or database, that the virtual directory can trust for user data.
* Server groups: Group one or more servers containing the same data and functionality. A typical implementation is the multi-master, multi-replica environment in which replicas process &quot;read&quot; requests and are in one server group, while masters process &quot;write&quot; requests and are in another, so that servers are grouped by their response to external stimuli, even though all share the same data.

==Use cases==
The following are sample use cases of virtual directories:
* Integrating multiple directory namespaces to create a central enterprise directory.
* Supporting infrastructure integrations after mergers and acquisitions. 
* Centralizing identity storage across the infrastructure, making identity information available to applications through various protocols (including LDAP, JDBC, and web services). 
* Creating a single access point for web access management (WAM) tools. 
* Enabling web single sign-on (SSO) across varied sources or domains.
* Supporting role-based, fine-grained authorization policies
* Enabling authentication across different security domains using each domain’s specific credential checking method.
* Improving secure access to information both inside and outside of the firewall.

<doc id="943546" wikidata="Q141916" url="?curid=943546" title="Aruba at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Aruba sent a delegation to compete at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece from 13 to 29 August 2004. The delegation&#x27;s participation in the Athens Olympics marked Aruba&#x27;s fifth appearance at the Summer Olympics since the Dutch colony&#x27;s debut at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Four athletes (three men and one woman) competed across three sports (Pierre de Windt in track and field, Davy Bisslik and Roshendra Vrolijk in swimming, and Isnardo Faro weightlifting). None of the track or swimming athletes advanced past the first round in their events, and as of Athens, no Arubans had medaled in any events. Roshendra Vrolijk bore Aruba&#x27;s flag at the ceremonies.

==Background==

Aruba is a small island colony of 100,000 people that is part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and has been under Dutch control since the 1630s. The island lies in the southern Caribbean Sea just to north of Venezuela, and is near to the Dutch colonies of Curaçao and Bonaire. The colony originally was part of an autonomous union with those two islands in what was known as the Netherlands Antilles, but Aruba seceded from that union in 1986. The Netherlands continues to regulate all its foreign affairs. While the first Dutch Antilean delegation to the Olympics was sent during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, the first uniquely Aruban delegation participated two years after the island&#x27;s secession from the Netherlands Antilles at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Between then and the 2004 Athens Olympics, Aruba had sent a delegation to all five Summer Olympic games. The most substantial Aruban delegation was in 1988, when it included eight athletes. This delegation included more women and encompassed more sports than any Aruban delegation since then (including the Athens Olympics).

At the Athens Olympics, four athletes (three men and one woman) participated across three sports in four distinct events. Swimmer Roshendra Vrolijk was Aruba&#x27;s flag bearer at the ceremonies.

==Athletics ==

Aruban athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard). 

Pierre &quot;Peppie&quot; de Windt participated on Aruba&#x27;s behalf as its only athlete in a track and field event. Born in the Solito neighborhood of Aruba&#x27;s capital city, Oranjestad, de Windt was 21 at the time he ran at the Olympics in Athens. The Aruban athlete had not previously participated in any Olympic games. The event&#x27;s first round took place during the 21st of August. de Windt took part in the fourth heat against eight other athletes, although Greece&#x27;s Hristoforos Hoidis did not start. In his heat, de Windt placed sixth with a time of 11.02 seconds. Paraguay&#x27;s Diego Ferreira ranked fifth ahead of de Windt, setting a national record in the process (10.50 seconds), while Laotian athlete Chamleunesouk Ao Oudomphonh ranked directly behind de Windt (11.30 seconds). The leaders of de Windt&#x27;s heat included first place finalist Shawn Crawford of the United States (10.02 seconds) and Barbados&#x27; Obadele Thompson, who placed second and set his season best (10.08 seconds). The Aruban sprinter did not advance to later rounds.

==Swimming ==
Davy Bisslik represented Aruba as a swimmer in the men&#x27;s 100 meters butterfly, and was the only male Aruban athlete participating in swimming that year. Born in Aruba, Bisslik participated in the athletic programs at The College of New Jersey, and attended the 2000 Sydney Olympics on Aruba&#x27;s behalf in the men&#x27;s 50 meters freestyle, where he ranked 62nd during the qualification round. Bisslik returned to the Olympics at age 22, although he entered in a different event entirely. During the qualification round on August 19, Bisslik competed against seven other athletes. He finished the event in 57.85 seconds, ranking last in his heat behind Guam&#x27;s Daniel O&#x27;Keeffe (57.39 seconds), who placed seventh, and Indonesia&#x27;s Andy Wibowo (56.86 seconds) who placed sixth. His heat was led by Czech swimmer Michal Rubáček (54.87 seconds) and Uzbekistan&#x27;s Oleg Lyashko (55.90 seconds). Of the 59 participants in the qualification round, Bisslik ranked 56th. He did not advance to later heats.

Roshendra Vrolijk represented Aruba at the Athens Olympics as a swimmer participating in the women&#x27;s 50 meters freestyle. Born in Aruba, Vrolijk was 15 years old when she participated in the 50 meters freestyle at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where she ranked 62nd in the qualification round. She returned to the Olympics as a 19-year-old. During the qualification round of the event, which took place on August 20, Vrolijk participated in the fourth heat against seven other athletes. She completed the event in 28.43 seconds, placing third in the event between Moldova&#x27;s Maria Tregubova (28.40 seconds) and Zambia&#x27;s Jakie Wellman (28.56 seconds). Of the 73 finishing athletes, Vrolijk ranked 49th. She did not advance to later rounds.

==Weightlifting ==

Isnardo &quot;Junior&quot; Faro participated in the 2004 Athens Olympics as Aruba&#x27;s only weightlifter. Born in Aruba in July 1978, Faro was 18 at the time he represented Aruba at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where he finished in 21st place of the men&#x27;s middleweight class. Although Faro did not attend the 2000 Sydney Olympics, he returned to the Olympics in 2004 as a 26-year-old in the men&#x27;s middle-heavyweight class. During the event, which took place on August 23, Faro participated alongside 24 other athletes. During the snatch phrase of the event, Faro was given three opportunities to score. During the first attempt, Faro successfully lifted 132.5 kilograms; on the next, 137 kilograms; and on the final, 140 kilograms. During the next phase, clean and jerk, Faro was given another three opportunities. On his first try, Faro attempted and failed to lift 167.5 kilograms. He succeeded in lifting this quantity on his next try. During his final attempt, Faro attempted and failed to lift 175 kilograms. Thus, as his scores were 140 and 167.5, the Aruban athlete&#x27;s final score was 307.5. 19 people of the 25 initial participants finished the event, and Isnardo Faro ranked 19th. He ranked behind 18th place finalist Furkat Saidov of Uzbekistan (320 points) and 17th place finalist Dario Lecman of Argentina (340 points). The gold medalist was Bulgaria&#x27;s Milen Dobrev (407.5 points).

<text>The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, commonly known as ANZ Bank, is a multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is Australia&#x27;s second-largest bank by assets and fourth-largest bank by market capitalisation.

Its current corporate entity was established on 1 October 1970, when the Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ) merged with the English, Scottish &amp; Australian Bank (ES&amp;A). It was the largest bank merger in Australian history at the time. The Australia and New Zealand Bank had in turn been founded in 1951 as a merger of the Bank of Australasia and the Union Bank of Australia, which were established in 1835 and 1837 respectively. ANZ is one of the Big Four Australian banks, along with the Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac.

Australian operations make up the largest part of ANZ&#x27;s business, with commercial and retail banking dominating. ANZ is also the largest bank in New Zealand, where the legal entity became known as ANZ National Bank in 2003 and changed to ANZ Bank New Zealand in 2012. From 2003 to 2012, it operated two brands in New Zealand, ANZ and the National Bank of New Zealand. The National Bank brand was retired in 2012, with a number of branches closing and others converting to ANZ branches. In addition to operations throughout Australia and New Zealand, ANZ also operates in 34 other countries.

ANZ together with its subsidiaries has a workforce of around 42,000 employees and serves more than 10 million customers worldwide.

==History==
===19th century===

The Bank of Australasia was founded in London in 1835. Its first branch was opened in Sydney on 14 December 1835. It combined with the Cornwall Bank, which was formed in Launceston, Van Diemens Land in 1828. In 1837, Union Bank of Australia was established in London by a group of people including banker George Fife Angas. The English, Scottish &amp; Australian Bank (ES&amp;A) was established in London in 1852, and opened its first Australian branch in Sydney in 1853. The ES&amp;A bank took over the Commercial Bank of Tasmania and the London Bank of Australia in 1921 and the Royal Bank of Australia in 1927.

===20th century===
In 1951, the Bank of Australasia merged with Union Bank of Australia to form the Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ Bank). In 1963, the first computer systems established in new data processing centre in Melbourne, Australia. In 1966, ANZ began operations in Honiara, Solomon Islands. In 1968, ANZ opened an office in New York, US. In 1969, ANZ established a representative office in Tokyo, Japan.

On 1 October 1970, ANZ merged with the English, Scottish &amp; Australian Bank to form the present organisation, Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group. That same year, the bank began operating in Vanuatu. In 1976, ANZ (PNG) was established. In 1977, ANZ transferred its incorporation from the UK to Australia. In 1979, ANZ acquired the Bank of Adelaide.

In 1980, the Singapore and New York representative offices upgraded to branch status. In 1984, ANZ purchased Grindlays Bank. In 1985, ANZ acquired Barclays&#x27; operations in Fiji and Vanuatu. That same year, the bank received a full commercial banking licence and opened a branch in Frankfurt, Germany, and announced ANZ Singapore. In 1988, ANZ opened branches in Rarotonga, Cook Islands and Paris, France. In 1989, ANZ purchased PostBank from New Zealand Government.

During the 1990s, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group acquired several banks. In 1990, this included National Mutual Royal Bank in March and the Town and Country Building Society in Western Australia in July. That same year, ANZ purchased Lloyd Bank&#x27;s operations in Papua New Guinea and the Bank of New Zealand&#x27;s operations in Fiji.

In 1993, ANZ established new headquarters in Melbourne, Australia. They also opened new branches in Hanoi, Vietnam, and Shanghai, China, and began a joint venture with PT Panin Bank in Indonesia. That year they also began operating in Tonga and sold their Canadian operations acquired via the purchase of Grindlays Bank in 1984 to HSBC Bank Canada.

Throughout the late 1990s, ANZ opened new branches in several locations, including Manila, Philippines, and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. In 1997, John McFarlane was appointed chief executive officer and the bank opened its Beijing branch. In 1999, ANZ formed a strategic alliance with E*Trade Australia for online share trading and purchased Amerika Samoa Bank.

===21st century===
In 2000, ANZ sold its Grindlays businesses in the Middle East and South Asia, and associated Grindlays Private Banking business to Standard Chartered. In 2001, ANZ opened branches in Timor Leste and began offering credit card services in Hong Kong. In 2002, ANZ formed a joint venture with ING Group for wealth management and life insurance business in Australia and New Zealand. The next year, ANZ acquired the National Bank of New Zealand.

In 2005, ANZ established the ANZ Royal Bank in Cambodia, a joint venture with the Cambodian-based Royal Group company. In 2006, ANZ announced a new world headquarters in the Melbourne Docklands and invested in the Bank of Tianjin, China. In 2007, ANZ acquired E*Trade Australia and Citizen Securities Bank in Guam. Also in 2007, Mike Smith, formerly of HSBC, became CEO after the retirement of John McFarlane in October and the company took over the naming rights sponsorship for Sydney&#x27;s Stadium Australia.

In August 2009, ANZ purchased the Royal Bank of Scotland&#x27;s (RBS) operations in six Asian countries for $550 million. In September the company announced it would buy out ING Group&#x27;s 51% stake of the joint venture, giving ANZ 100% control of ING Australia. In November, ANZ opened their new headquarters in Melbourne.

In 2010, ANZ acquired the RBS&#x27; interests in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia. That year ANZ also expanded its stake in the Bank of Tianjin. In November, ING Australia was renamed OnePath.

In 2012, ANZ announced the retirement of the National Bank brand in New Zealand. In 2013, ANZ became the first bank to reopen in the Christchurch CBD following the 2011 earthquakes.

In 2016, Shayne Elliott became CEO. In April ANZ partnered with Apple to bring Apple Pay to its customers. In 2017, ANZ acquired REALas property price predictor start-up.

In 2018, the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry heard that ANZ had failed to accurately verify the living expenses of home loan customers referred to the bank by mortgage brokers, believing that this was the responsibility of the brokers, in spite of a conflict of interest in doing so; and that, due to processing issues, it had charged nearly 500,000 home loan customers the incorrect interest rate for more than ten years, leading the bank to overcharge customers by approximately $90 million.

&quot;Bloomberg Intelligence&quot; estimated in May 2020 that ANZ&#x27;s surplus capital was A$3.4 billion (US$2.4 billion), with ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott telling &quot;Bloomberg&quot; that the bank was &quot;sitting on&quot; the excess while it considered market trends.

In February 2020, the Federal Court of Australia fined ANZ AUD10 million for charging customers fees between 2003 and 2015 that it was not entitled to, equating to profits of around AUD3.1 million. The regulator said around 69,000 customers had been affected. For the year ending September 2020, ANZ posted a yearly profit of A$3.58 billion (US$2.53 billion), a decline of 40% from the A$6 billion in 2019, with the bank attributing the drop to the COVID-19 pandemic and &quot;full year credit impairment charges&quot; of A$2.74 billion as a result.

After tensions between China and Australia resulted in China imposing trade curbs on imports from Australia in October 2020, the CEO of ANZ stated to CNBC that the company was also &quot;looking for opportunities&quot; in other Asian countries beyond China as well. It was reported in March 2021 that ANZ was planning to cut its workforce in China by half, and shift the positions elsewhere. In November 2021, Reuters reported that ANZ was being sued by a law firm in a class action lawsuit for unfair contract terms, after ANZ allegedly charged interest on customer purchases that had been repaid on time. The lawsuit focused on charges levied prior to January 2019, when an Australian law outlawing charging retrospective interest had been implemented. In December 2021, ANZ pled guilty in a case filed by the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission to breaching its obligations as a financial services and credit licensee provider, and not fully disbursing benefits to 500,000 customers. An A$25 million penalty was proposed.

ANZ said it was combining its digital division and its Australian retail business in February 2022. In March 2022, ANZ launched a digital bank called ANZ Plus. In April 2022, ANZ was involved in a joint venture with Scentre Group, Westpac, IBM and the Commonwealth Bank named Lygon, a blockchain startup. In July 2022, ANZ agreed to terms with Suncorp to purchase Suncorp Bank for $5 billion. However, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) blocked the deal in August 2023. On 20 February 2024, the Australian Competition Tribunal overturned the decision by the ACCC, paving the way for ANZ to acquire Suncorp Bank.

In 2023, ANZ announced a strategic investment in Australian property media and technology company View Media Group (VMG).

== Operations ==
=== Personal banking ===
Personal banking is one of the largest divisions within ANZ. It provides financial services including banking and lending products to the general public. ANZ serves around six million customers at its Australian branches.

ANZ was the first bank in Australia to offer Apple Pay to its customers.

=== Institutional banking ===
ANZ is the largest institutional bank in Australia. It provides financial services to institutional and corporate customers in Australia and the Asia-Pacific. As of 2019, ANZ has around 7,000 institutional and corporate customers, with a total lending of A$165 billion.

ANZ is committed to sustainable finance for institutional customers transitioning to a low-carbon economy. As of 2021, ANZ has concluded around A$22 billion worth of sustainable finance transactions. In June 2021, ANZ closed Australia&#x27;s first sustainability-linked bond (SLB) in the domestic debt market. In August 2021, ANZ launched sustainability-linked derivatives (SLD) in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan.

=== Asia-Pacific ===

ANZ is one of the leading Australian banks in the Asia-Pacific region. It has been aggressive in its expansion into the emerging markets of China, Vietnam and Indonesia. ANZ is also a leading bank in New Zealand as well as several Pacific Island Nations where it competes in many markets with fellow Australian bank Westpac. ANZ&#x27;s arm in New Zealand is operated through a subsidiary company, ANZ National Bank, from 2003 to 2012, when it changed by ANZ Bank New Zealand upon merging the ANZ and National Bank brands.

In March 2005, it formed a strategic alliance with Vietnam&#x27;s Sacombank involving an acquisition of 10% of Sacombank&#x27;s share capital. As part of the strategic alliance, ANZ will provide technical assistance in the areas of risk management and retail and small business banking.

ANZ has followed a similar strategy in China, where it acquired a 20% share in Tianjin City Commercial Bank in July 2006. It also negotiated a similar deal with Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank.

In August 2009, ANZ purchased RBS&#x27;s retail units in Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia and Hong Kong, as well as RBS&#x27;s banking businesses in Taiwan, the Philippines and Vietnam. It was purchased for the price of A$687 million. Because of the acquisition, ANZ became an atm5 member in Singapore.

As of September 2012, the company had a total of 1,337 branches worldwide.

In 2016, ANZ adopted a less aggressive approach to expansion in the Asia-Pacific region after low returns. At the end of October 2016, ANZ announced the sale of its entire Asian retail and wealth management operations to DBS Bank; ANZ also signalled a withdrawal from its &quot;Asian pivot&quot;.

In 2020, as tensions between the US and China escalated, CEO Shayne Elliot acknowledged that the conflict had “raised the risk profile” of the bank&#x27;s China investments, and said that the bank could further pull back from the country.

=== Offices ===
In September 2006, plans were unveiled for ANZ&#x27;s world headquarters to be located in Melbourne&#x27;s Docklands precinct. The complex features a vast low rise office building, shops, car and bicycle parking facilities. The complex enables 6,500 ANZ staff to work in one integrated area. The building, located at 833 Collins Street, is the largest office complex in Australia at net lettable area, with gross floor area, and an accredited Six-Green Star Building. Construction commenced in late 2006 and the building opened in late 2009. Designed by HASSELL and Lend Lease Design, the building faces the Yarra River. In 2006, it was expected that it would cost 478 million to build the new headquarters, however costed 750 million by the time it was complete in 2009. The building was one of the winners at the 2010 World Architecture Festival in the category &quot;Interiors and Fit Out of the Year&quot;.

In 2016 ANZ announced that it would sell its former Melbourne global headquarters, located at the junction of 100 Queen Street, and 380 Collins Street, Melbourne, called Verdon Chambers and more commonly known as the Gothic Bank. The former bank building was purpose built as the head office of the English, Scottish &amp; Australian Bank (a predecessor of the current ANZ Banking Group). The building was acquired in December 2016 by The GPT Group for 275.4 million.

The ANZ Bank Centre in Sydney includes ANZ as its major tenant. The office building was designed by Francis-Jones Morehen Thorp and was completed in April 2013.

== Marketing ==
===Advertising===

In 2005, an advertisement included two famous robots: &quot;Lost in Space&quot; robot, and a Dalek from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, although the Dalek was replaced in subsequent versions of the ad. In 2006, the company started a TV campaign with a series of ads featuring their new mascot – the Falcon, a bird trained to stop credit card thieves, illustrating the company&#x27;s measures in prevention of credit card fraud. In April 2024 this marketing strategy was relaunched.

In 2010, ANZ ran an ad campaign parodying common banking scenarios with a fictional character known as &#x27;Barbara who lives in Bank World&#x27;, a middle-aged, rude, sarcastic and unhelpful bank manager. The adverts have received acclaim for wit and humour, but also criticism for stereotyping bank managers. Barbara is portrayed by Australian comedian Genevieve Morris. In 2010, ANZ spent $195 million in Australia on advertising. In 2011, a series of ads were fronted by Simon Baker, the star of the American television show &quot;The Mentalist&quot;. According to a 2014 top 20 list of advertising spends, ANZ was in the top 20. In 2016, ANZ New Zealand had the highest spend of any bank. One third of ANZ&#x27;s spend on media is said to be digital.

===Sponsorship===
In 2014, ANZ renewed its sponsorship with the Australian Open for a further five years. In 2015, ANZ held a campaign in sync with the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.

==Symbols==
===Logos===
ANZ has had a number of different logos throughout its history. Its current logo was designed by M&amp;C Saatchi, and was introduced in 2009 to coincide with ANZ&#x27;s ambition to be a major regional bank in the Asia Pacific. The 2009 logo introduces a stylised three-petaled lotus which represents the trinity of Australia, New Zealand and Asia Pacific, the three core markets of ANZ. The central human shape represents its customers and its people.

===Coat of arms===
==Controversies==

===Manipulation of benchmark interest rates and other key metrics===

In 2016, ANZ and 10 of its traders were named as being the subject of legal proceedings for manipulation of the benchmark inter-bank interest rates in Australia; specifically the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) has made claims of unconscionable conduct and manipulation against ANZ. ANZ has attempted to deny the claims and says it will defend the claim in court. Formal filings of the originating process in these regards were made against ANZ on 4 March 2016. Since that time ASIC has compounded their claim against the ANZ. In a separate court appearance in November 2016 ANZ admitted to 10 instances of attempted cartel conduct regarding alleged manipulation of the Malaysian ringgit. The wider market rigging case has been reported as likely lasting into 2018.

===Agriculture and child labour===

ANZ has been the subject of claims that it has backed agriculture and timber companies that engage in so called &#x27;land grabs&#x27;. In 2014, ANZ faced allegations that it funded a Cambodian sugar plantation that has involved child labour, military-backed land grabs, forced evictions and food shortages. In February 2020, ANZ reached a compensation deal to around 1,000 Cambodian families in a land dispute related to a sugar company that ANZ funded, agreeing to pay &quot;the profit it earned from the loan to the affected communities&quot; of an undisclosed amount.

===Litigious approach===

ANZ has also been criticised in the Senate for its allegedly &quot;hard boiled&quot; approach to farmers exposed to the fallout from ANZ&#x27;s purchase of the Landmark loan book. One submission to the Senate inquiry into bank conduct mentioned one farmer self-immolating after alleged defaults occurring. Another former customer in the Senate inquiry was mentioned as being subjected to victimisation by receivers and police, including use of SWAT teams and being held at gun-point. In 2016 it was reported that ANZ was accused of racism in a high-profile court case involving the businessman Pankaj Oswal and his wife; specifically it was reported that an email contained comments stating that, &quot;We are dealing with Indians with no moral compass and an Indian woman [the wife of Mr. Oswal], as every bit as devious as PO (Pankaj Oswal),&quot; and &quot;This has been a very Indian characteristic transaction.&quot; The ANZ agreed to a settlement for an undisclosed amount in respect of the legal claim made by the Oswals.

===Culture===

ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott admitted in 2016 that &quot;culture&quot; will be one of the biggest challenges for ANZ. Media reports have included allegations of sexism, drug use and bravado culture. In 2016, ANZ was pursued in court over its suggesting on social media that criticism of the bank&#x27;s chief financial officer might have been sexist, which resulted in the broker at Bell Potter losing his job. Former ANZ director John Dahlsen in 2016 admitted that there are issues with bank culture and competition. In November 2016, there were further claims of sexist conduct and a separate lawsuit was filed against ANZ in the United States regarding staff at its New York office.

===Malaysian scandal===

In early 2016, ANZ was also mentioned in a scandal in Malaysia involving one of ANZ&#x27;s subsidiaries and the Malaysian leader. The incident has raised questions for ANZ. ANZ admitted in November 2016 that it had little ability to control its affiliate.

===Misleading file notes presented to Victorian Supreme Court===

In 2016, there was an incident reported involving the Financial Ombudsman Service (Australia), where the Financial Ombudsman Service presented misleading file notes to the Supreme Court of Victoria, in the discovery phase of a case involving ANZ, to the benefit of ANZ&#x27;s case. The ANZ has not commented on the scandal as yet.

===Out-sourcing of jobs===

ANZ has continued to out-source jobs in countries other than Australia and this has caused some controversy with some outlets. ANZ have been progressively increasing work output from offshore offices. ANZ&#x27;s Bangalore office has been operational since 1989, making it one of the first organisations to employ IT staff based in India. ANZ employs around 4,800 staff in Bangalore, India. 1500 IT positions, 2000 positions in Payments and Institutional Operations and International and High Value Services and 1300 positions in Operations Personal Banking have been shifted from Melbourne to India. In 2006, ANZ predicted that by 2010, over 2000 jobs would have been shifted from Australia to Bangalore. In 2012, ANZ transferred 360 permanent staff from Melbourne and Bangalore to Capgemini. All these staff worked in the Technology Testing and Environment Space. As ANZ CIO Anne announced earlier that ANZ want a Hybrid model of technology in order to achieve the 2017 Technology roadmap.

===Anti-competitive conduct===

Despite the ANZ taking advantage of block-chain technology the ANZ had blocked businesses making use of Bitcoin. The ANZ and others were investigated by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission and cleared of colluding with other banks on the issue of Bitcoin based business.

=== Alleged discrimination ===
In September 2020, ANZ was accused of discrimination by Australian cryptocurrency exchanger Allan Flynn before the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The dispute is the first human rights action brought by a Bitcoin trader against a bank alleging discrimination on the basis of Flynn&#x27;s &quot;profession, trade, occupation, or calling&quot; in violation of the Australian Capital Territory&#x27;s anti-discrimination legislation. Flynn alleges ANZ denied him banking services on the basis of his occupation as a cryptocurrency exchanger by closing his and his brother&#x27;s bank accounts and contacting another bank about his Bitcoin trading, allegedly causing the other bank to similarly deny him service. Interlocutory orders were made by the Tribunal in June 2021. The matter between Flynn and the bank was settled in October 2021 with ANZ admitting in a statement that had de-banked Flynn because he operated Bitcoin trading service, and that it could (subject to their defences) amount to discrimination, but that they believed doing so was necessary to mitigate exposure to regulatory risk. Flynn maintains, despite the settlement requiring him to withdraw the action, that ANZ&#x27;s actions were unlawful.

===Panama Papers===

ANZ was reported as appearing in 7,548 of the Mossack Fonseca documents in the Panama Papers, reflecting the bank&#x27;s extensive work in New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Samoa and Jersey.

===Criminal cartel charges===
On 1 June 2018, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced that criminal cartel charges are expected to be laid by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) against ANZ Bank, its Group Treasurer Rick Moscati, along with Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and a number of individuals. The charges concern a $2.5 billion ANZ capital raising that took place in August 2015. In July 2020 committal proceedings were completed in the case, which may last into 2022.

===Hayne Royal Commission===

The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry, also known as the Hayne Royal Commission, was a Royal Commission established on 14 December 2017 by the Australian Government to inquire into and report on misconduct in the banking, superannuation, and financial services industry. The establishment of the commission followed revelations in the media of a culture of greed within several Australian financial institutions. A subsequent parliamentary inquiry recommended a royal commission, noting the lack of regulatory intervention by the relevant government authorities, and later revelations that financial institutions were involved in money laundering for drug syndicates, turned a blind eye to terrorism financing, and ignored statutory reporting responsibilities and impropriety in foreign exchange trading.

ANZ was also implicated in the bank bill swap rate scandal and settled with ASIC prior to the commencement of legal proceedings.

===Defamation case===
In July 2020 Bogac Ozdemir, a former employee of ANZ, filed a civil action against the bank at a New York court. Ozdemir claims that statements made by the bank about him were defamatory, and is seeking damages of US$20 million.

=== Document Dumping ===
In 2023, confidential banking documents were found in a bin close to the ANZ branch in Armadale. The documents included names, addresses, and account numbers of customers with the branch.

<text>Pignon sur rue is a Quebec television program from 1995 to 1999, on Télé-Québec. Almost 30 years after its first broadcast, the reality show Pignon sur rue is back on Télé-Québec in fall of 2024 airing daily in a 4-day per week format. This time, it is produced by Trinome &amp; Filles company.

In modern terms, the show could be classified as reality television. This precursor of the genre is often cited by Québécois intellectuals as a more intelligent and respectable form, before the &quot;Loft Story&quot; and &quot;Occupation Double&quot; era.

Each season centered on a number of young people from Franco-Ontarian, Acadian and Quebec regions, living in one or more Montreal apartments. They did not know each other before the adventure, except on season four. Its original theme song was composed and performed by Gaspé chansonnier Kevin Parent.

<doc id="943568" wikidata="Q7896357" url="?curid=943568" title="University of St Andrews Union Debating Society">
<text>The University of St Andrews Union Debating Society is a student debating society at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. Tracing its origins back to 1794 and established under the current name in 1890, it is the oldest continuously operating debate society of its kind in the English-speaking world (predated only by the College Historical Society at Trinity College Dublin which ceased operations for a period beginning in 1794) and the oldest as a whole in the United Kingdom.

It also holds weekly public debates in the Lower Parliament Hall, which are free and open to all students - the only Scottish Debating Society to do this.

In 2015, the society became the first in Scotland to win the European Universities Debating Championship, a competition that they compete at every year.

The society&#x27;s motto remains &quot;pro amicitia et litteris&quot; meaning &quot;for friendship and learning&quot;.

==History==

===Founding===
The origins of the University of St Andrews Debating Society can be traced to the formation in 1794 of the university &quot;Literary Society&quot;. Despite being initially popular, the society began to suffer from a lack of funding beginning in the 19th century. To remedy this, Article 3 of the Literary Society&#x27;s 1832 constitution imposed a one shilling fee per semester and fines varying in severity for lateness, absence, or the use of &#x27;improper language&#x27;. At this stage of its history, the Literary Society operated under a strange mixture of egalitarianism and exclusiveness. Initially, there was no president of the Society and meetings were chaired by each member in rotation, taking place in St Salvator&#x27;s Quadrangle. During this period, the only leadership positions were that of Secretary and Treasurer and all decisions were taken collectively by the Society as a whole. However, membership was limited to twenty-five students all of whom were required until 1844 to attend or have attended the university&#x27;s classes in Logic or Moral Philosophy. Membership was by election only, and no &#x27;strangers&#x27; were permitted to attend debates. In 1846, &quot;The Classical Society&quot;, a rival debating society, was established and was soon vying with the Literary Society for the attention of the student body. In 1847, this new society began a new tradition of hosting an end of term feast called the Gaudeamas, which was later hosted jointly with the Literary Society beginning in 1866. However, it soon became apparent that there were simply not enough students at the university to justify the existence of two debating societies and consequently in 1890 the Classical Society and Literary Society merged to form the &quot;Union Debating Society&quot;.

===Development===
In 1892, the acquisition of James Crichton&#x27;s House by the fledgling Students&#x27; Union, which despite not being officially affiliated with the Society, allowed it to host debates in the Union Diner. This, and the fact that the Union Debating Society now had over seventy members (a third of the total student population), gave the Society renewed confidence and a greater importance than ever before in the lives of students.

In 1898 the Society decided to form Debates Board, in order to manage the running of the society, it consisted of an honorary president, two honorary vice-presidents, a secretary, a treasurer, a &quot;general committee&quot; of four members, a &#x27;College Echoes&#x27; Reporting Committee, and a Debates Committee of four members. In 1910 the constitution was amended to include the election of an official president of the Society was created, however as World War I began Society membership dropped and no president was elected between 1914 and 1919. Following the war, the Union Debating Society remained in decline, so to combat this the Society&#x27;s vice-president (Mr. D. Dick) proposed that its membership become a part of the subscription to the Students&#x27; Union, although these negotiations ultimately broke down. These discussions were reopened on 21 March 1925 by then President D. Kennedy who proposed in his farewell address that the Union Debating Society become a committee of the Students&#x27; Union. This move was supported by treasurer J. B. Torrance and the decision was ratified on 30 October 1925, following which the Union Debating Society was affiliated with the Students&#x27; Union, and all male matriculated students of the university would be members. The chair of the Union Debating Society would be elected as the Union Convenor of Debates, and debating would be done completely under the auspices of the Students&#x27; Union. The Debates Board ceased to exist, and the title of &#x27;President of the Union Debating Society&#x27; was kept purely as a courtesy title.

Despite this change, attendance at debates continued to drop, especially as more women attended the university and were disallowed from participating in the Society. In response, a new mixed-sex competitor for the Union Debating Society emerged, called the Parliamentary and Dialectic Society, taking over most of its primary functions. The Parliamentary and Dialectic Society prided itself on allowing female members to speak at debates, and restricting the input of male speakers on sensitive issues, which led to it losing the backing of the Students&#x27; Union in 1932. When asked by female members of the P and D if the Union Debating Society would now allow women to become members, then president Stephen W. Bonarjee told them to &#x27;go away and start your own society,&#x27; leading to the creation of the Women&#x27;s Debating Society in 1932.

In 1932 the society elected to re-create the Debates Board, in order to regain some independence from the Students&#x27; Union. It was to consist of the Convenor of Debates and two clerks to the house. Following this move, the board began to host Parliamentary and Inter-Varsity Debating Competitions, the first of which drew participants from Dublin, Aberdeen, Aberystwyth, Durham, and Liverpool.

In 1963, the Students&#x27; Union, which had up until that point been exclusively for male students voted to merge with the Women&#x27;s Student Union and when this occurred the Union Debating Society merged its membership with Women&#x27;s Debating Society.

In the 1970s, the move of the Students&#x27; Union from its original home to a new purpose built building provided the Union Debating Society with the opportunity to make a move of its own. The Convenor of Debates took the opportunity to move debates to the Union Theater, and then to Lower Parliament Hall in St Mary&#x27;s Quadrangle.

This physical move away from the Students&#x27; Union was accompanied by an organisational one. In 1979, the society decided to change the Debating Sub-Committee into the &#x27;Debating Board of Ten&#x27;. This new sub-committee comprised the convenor, chairman of ways and means, sergeant-at-arms, clerk to the house, treasurer, steward, two ordinary members, union president, and a further representative from the Union Committee. The president would continue to be elected as the convenor of debates, but the Board of Ten would be elected in an annual general meeting of the Union Debating Society.

===The Society today===
Today the Union Debating Society continues to fulfill its primary mission of holding regular debates in Lower Parliament Hall. 
These occur every Thursday on a weekly basis during term time. In recent years, turnout at the Society&#x27;s debates has been good drawing in speakers from across the UK and, occasionally, from abroad. These weekly debates are available for all to attend. The classic St Andrews Gown is traditionally worn by attendees, with the President of the society wearing the Debates President gown. These public debates are organised by the President and their Public Debates Sub-Committee.

The Union Debating Society also has a highly successful Inter-Varsity wing. Major successes include reaching the final of the European Universities Debating Championships in 2007 and winning a number of domestic competitions. The Union Debating Society has also had teams reach the semi-finals of the 2007, 2008, 2012 and 2013 World Universities Debating Championships, with several alumni reaching the finals in 2013, and has also performed well in the John Smith Memorial Mace. At the Vienna 2015 European Championships, Alex Don and Ruairidh MacIntosh placed first and second respectively on the speaker tab and were the first team from a Scottish institution to win the competition. 

More recent successes include St Andrews appearing in Scottish Mace Championship finals in 2022, 2023, and 2024 (Zaine Mansuralli and William Smith as well as Cara Shepherd and William Finlator in 2022; Parth Pandya and Cara Shepherd in 2023, and Parth Pandya and William Smith in 2024); Freddy Simmonet-Lefevre and Fraser Laing winning the Oxford IV Novice Final in 2021; and Cara Shepherd and William Smith winning the Durham IV 2022 and William Smith and Freddie Skerrett winning the Durham IV 2023. Internationally, Parth Pandya and Alastair Bowyer broke 25th out of 48 teams to the octo-finals of World Universities Debating Championship 2023 held in Madrid. The Union Debating Society regularly sends two teams to the European Universities Debating Championships and to the World Universities Debating Championships with team slots available for anyone in the University to trial for.

== Notable Controversies and Debates ==

* In 1842 the society, despite being under an Anglican government, voted in favor of Catholic Emancipation and the reintroduction of income tax.
* Beginning in 1874, the Society began to run a series of debates using the motion this house has no faith in His/Her Majesty&#x27;s government. The most recent debate of this kind ran on 19 January 2023.
* In November 1933, Liberal Party leader Archibald Sinclair spoke in a debate on the rise of Socialism.
* That same year, Otto Wagener, a Nazi, debated in support of the recent election of the Nationalist Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party.
* In 1950, under the presidency of Stewart T. Bates (1950-1951), the Society debated the motion this house believes the Communist Party has the only real solution for the Capitalist Crisis. The motion fell with only twelve votes in favor and three abstentions.
* In 1952 newly elected Union Debating Society President Derek Meteyard (1952-1953) was arrested for unlawful possession of a golf trolley.
* Meteyard also hosted a debate on 5 November 1951 debated by LJ Woodward and Professor H. J. Rose on the motion: this house believes it&#x27;s the same the whole world over, it&#x27;s the poor as &#x27;as the blame, the rich as &#x27;as the pleasure, and it&#x27;s all a bleeding shame. The house voted the motion down.
* Presidents Stewart Lamont (1966-1968) and Gillies Clark (1968-1969) hosted a series of anti-religious and anti-Catholic debates including: this house has no need of a god and this house abominates the Pope and his Church.
* Towards the end of Lamont&#x27;s term, he proposed the motion this house prefers the Pill to the Pope. During his speech Lamont produced a pill and demanded opposition produce the Pope. They could not and he won the debate.
* Lamont also hosted politically controversial debates, such as in 1966 the motion this house believes that Guy Fawkes was the only man who went to Parliament with the intention of carrying out his original proposal.
* In 1967 also under Lamont, the Union Debating Society hosted the debate this house would not let his daughter marry a black man. This was immediately met with criticism by the student paper of the time the &quot;Aien&quot; which accused the society of illiberalism, as well as having sexist and racist policies. The &quot;Aien&quot; also went onto publish a response by a group of Arab students who had attended the debate in which they declared they had not come to Scotland to marry white women.
* In 1969 under the presidency of Allan Ronaldson (1969-1970), the motion this house regrets having come to St Andrews was debated, but failed to pass with only five votes in favor and one abstention.
* In 1970 a debate later known as &#x27;the Balloon Debate&#x27; occurred. During this session, speakers had to assume the role of a character and argue why they should not be thrown out of a hot air balloon to stop it from sinking. One notable participant Michael Forsyth chose to play the role of Margaret Thatcher.
* Both before and after the merge with the Women&#x27;s Debate Society in 1963, the Union Debate Society hosted a series of controversial debates about the place and role of women. These motions included:
** In 1932: the house debated the motion this house deplores the prevalence of the sex motif in literature, following the ban of the book &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; and allowed women to speak.
** In 1946: the Society voted overwhelmingly in favor of the motion the house believes that a woman&#x27;s place is in the home.
** In 1954, the house voted in favor of the motion this house regrets the modern woman.
** In 1974: this house believes that a woman&#x27;s place is in the bed and this house believes that women should be barred from places of authority.
** In 1980: this house believes that a woman&#x27;s place is in a harem.
* The most notable of these debates took place in 1979 under the presidency of Chris Graffius (1979-1980) with the motion this house believes that rape is a female fantasy. 
** The motion was debated by Christopher Roffey, a Tory Club member, for the proposition and Nancy Ritchie, a Scottish Women&#x27;s Action Group member, for the opposition.
** The debate remained relatively calm until one woman, Sarah Norman, another Tory Club member, voiced her support for the proposition side, following which a group of roughly 20 Scottish Women&#x27;s Action Group members, including Nancy Ritchie, began to verbally harass Roffey who screamed in response &#x27;get out you stupid women.&#x27;
** Following that a hoax emergency call was placed and three fire engines, one ambulance, and six police officers stormed Lower Parliament Hall, with the SWAG women being blamed by Roffey in the student paper &quot;Aien&quot; for the disruption.
* Graffius&#x27;s successor, Celia Boddington (1980-1982) also hosted a series of failed controversial debates including:
** This house believes civilization ends north of Gretna Green.
** This house believes it is desirable that homosexuality should be cured.
** This house demands that the Kate Kennedy Club admit women.
* In one of Boddington&#x27;s debates the pastor Jack Glass debated the motion this house would ban the papal visit and claimed that the pope should excommunicate Irish Republican Army terrorists, that the Catholic church was responsible for the deaths of 5 million civilians, that the Virgin Mary was impure, and that Roman Catholicism is modern paganism.
* In another incident broadcast live by the BBC, the Union Debating Society under Boddington debated the motion this house believes that contraception is immoral in a Christian society, proposed by Joseph Devine, the Archbishop of Glasgow, and opposed by Michael Hare Duke, the bishop of Perth and St Andrews, getting into a fist fight over whether contraceptives prevent abortion.
* In 1982, Boddington invited Andrew Brons, leader of the National Front Party in South Africa, to speak on a motion condemning the 1976 Race Relations Act, despite calls from outside the union to disinvite him.
** The motion was opposed by Tory Club President Giles Bootheway who compared Brons&#x27;s attack on race relations to Jack the Ripper claiming that laws against murder violated his personal liberty.
** Following this incident, the Union Debating Society was banned from Inter-Varsity debates by York University and Manchester University which stated that the ban stemmed not from the one debate but from a historical pattern of poor behavior by the Society.
* In 1983, president Ben Stocks (1983-1984) organized the World Record Debate which was observed by Guinness Book of World Records officials.
** The debate was on the motion this house prefers the past to the present and the present to the future.
** Debaters spoke in 14 hours shifts with subs filling for rest and eating breaks and was in total 100 hours and holds the record for the World&#x27;s Longest Continuous Debate.
** The debate raised £5000 for the Society&#x27;s increasing competitive debate sector, funding Sarah Norman and Ben Stock&#x27;s trip to the 1983 World Universities Debating Championship at Princeton University at which they placed 3rd.
* In 1984, during the same voting session the house voted in favor of Gay Liberation and the upholding of Victorian morals.
* In 1985 during the presidency of Derek Browning (1985), the Union Debating Society hosted the debate this house believes feminism is a crutch for female inadequacy, with proposition speakers Eileen May and Claire Jenkins stating that women in the audience who thought they needed feminism wouldn&#x27;t burn their bras if they really needed support.
* In 1987, during a debate on the motion this house would not expect every man to do his duty, fourteen gowned members of the Kate Kennedy Club entered the debate chamber with lit torches prompting the fire department to be called. It was discovered that there was a flaw in the wiring of the alarm system and Lower Parliament Hall was never actually in danger of being burned down.
* The presidency of Andrew Burnett (1987) was marked by a series of scandals for the Union Debating Society:
** Burnett won the Society a sponsorship by the Norwich Group company which he then used with some of the money the Society received annually from the Student&#x27;s Union to charter a taxi to ferry him around St Andrews at all times of the day.
** The new student newspaper &#x27;The Chronicle&#x27; began publishing exposé reports of Burnett&#x27;s lavish spending, even calling for the Society to be disbanded after one night out cost the university £726.
** Burnett was so unpopular a coalition of anti-debaters stole the £1000 worth of historical silverware that was on loan to the Society from a local hotel forcing Burnett to repay the hotel or risk prosecution.
** Burnett paid for dinners for anyone coming to the Society&#x27;s debates that included two free bottles of wine and one free bottle of Port for each attendee.
** Burnett hosted a debate calling for the reunification of the University of St Andrews and the University of Dundee, with the rector of each university on one side the debate. 
** Another debate hosted by Burnett was on the motion this house believes that Catholicism promotes the spread of AIDs.
** Burnett set a motion during the internal Maidens competition on voluntary euthanasia and was reported on by the student newspaper the &#x27;Chronicle&#x27; as being an explicit attack on &#x27;homosexuals and AIDs victims.&#x27;
** Burnett also organized the Union Debating Society&#x27;s Ascot Ball, which had its own series of controversies including:
*** Burnett hired the pop group Mel and Kim to write the song Fun, Love, and Money as the ball&#x27;s theme song.
*** Burnett organized the gambling on horse races on the Old Course Country Club&#x27;s lawn.
*** Burnett gave away free several free bottles of Dom Perignon champagne to every guest.
*** Burnett hired a bucking bronco to give rides to guests.
** Due to the several thousand pounds the ball cost the Union, as well as Burnett&#x27;s other extravagant expenditures the Students&#x27; Union cut the funding of the Society by 75% and has never restored it to pre-Burnett rates.
* In 1990 during the end of year President&#x27;s Farewell Solatium, which had replaced the Gaudeamas Feast, president Graham Stewart (1990-1991) ended the night tied to a drainpipe in the quadrangle wearing nothing but a monocle.
==Organisation==

The Union Debating Society consists of the Board of Ten and then the Competitive Debates Subcommittee and the Public Debates Subcommittee. Together these compose the entire Debates Board and are composed solely of St Andrews students. All positions (save the Media, Treasurer and Equity Officers) are elected in the AGM held in Spring. All matriculated students are able to run for any of these positions and equally all are able to vote in the AGM.

The Board of Ten is led and chaired by the President and Convener and consists of: President and Convener; the Treasurer; the Chief Whip; the Chair of Ways and Means; the Clerk; the Steward to the House (Social Secretary); the Media Officers (2); the Diversity and Inclusion Officer; the Director of Student Development and Activities; and the Parent(s) of the House. The First Secretary to the House is appointed by the President and Convenor as their deputy. The Board of Ten is responsible for the overarching organisation of the Society and serves as the executive committee of the Union Debating Society. They meet weekly and minutes of these meetings are collected and kept with records dating back almost a century.

The Competitive Debates Subcommittee is chaired by the Chief Whip and consists of: the Chief Whip; the Competitions Secretary; the Training Officer; the Schools Competition Officer; the Schools Outreach Officer; the Competitive Equity Officer; and the Freshers&#x27; Representative. They are responsible for organising all inter-varsity competitive affairs including competition attendance, internal training sessions, and school outreach. They are responsible for organising the regular training sessions that take place on Wednesday afternoons as well as the advanced training sessions for international competitions. Equally, they organise which inter-varsity competitions are attended and who attends - with the aim to allow every student who shows an interest the ability to attend at least one IV competition a semester. The Schools Outreach program has seen considerable revision in recent years. The annual and prestigious St Andrews Schools Competition is run for any Scottish Schools to send teams to. In recent years, the Union Debating Society has aided First Chances set up regular debate training as part of their offering to underprivileged identified pupils in Fife. The Competitive Debates Subcommittee meet weekly, with the Chief Whip representing the Subcommittee at Board of Ten meetings.

The Public Debates Subcommittee is chaired by the Chair of Ways and Means and consists of: the Chair of Ways and Means; the Serjeant-at-Arms; and the Public Debates Secretary. They are responsible for the planning and organising of the wider society interaction with the St Andrews University student community. This consists of organising the weekly public debates - drawing in a wide-range of prominent external speakers - and organising all of the social affairs of the society. The Public Debates Subcommittee meet weekly, with the Chair of Ways and Means representing the Subcommittee at Board of Ten meetings.

==Traditions==
The Society has a number of traditions, many going back decades or even centuries. At the start of a debate the convenor welcomes those gathered to the current session of &#x27;the University of St Andrews Union Debating Society, the oldest and, some might say, the finest of its kind in the world&#x27; — this brings a resounding cheer of &#x27;hear hear&#x27;.

At debates students wear academic gowns including the scarlet gowns of the United College, the black of St Mary&#x27;s College, the black postgraduate gowns of St Leonard&#x27;s College, or an appropriate graduate gown.

On the basis that the Society has always claimed to have provided good value for money (unlike other student debating societies like the Oxford Union or Durham Union, both membership and attendance at debates are free to all students) when a monetary amount is mentioned in a speech, those attending the debate cry &quot;How much?&quot;; the sum is then repeated, to which the audience responds &quot;That&#x27;s cheap!&quot;.

The minutes are read at the beginning of each debate in a caricature style of some relevant figure, but inevitably someone would rather proceed to the main debate, and so raises a point of order, moving that the minutes be taken as read; another member rises in opposition to the motion. At this stage a vote is taken by &#x27;oral acclamation&#x27; — the announcement of which is met with a cry of &#x27;Oohh&#x27;, and after a vote the convenor generally believes to be closer than is apparent to the rest of the House (who nearly always believe that the &#x27;nays&#x27; have it, which would result in the minutes being read in full), the minutes are taken as read, and the convenor requested to &#x27;resign&#x27; on the basis of having effectively overruled the House.

The society&#x27;s motto is Pro Amicitia Et Litteris — &#x27;for friendship and learning&#x27;. The Gaudeamus used to be sung at the end of each debate, as the Board of Ten and speakers process out of the chamber but now they simply rise and leave at the command of the President.

The Society also owns a sword, affectionately known as Bessie, which is said to be used by the Sergeant at Arms to protect the authority of the speaker: in practice it symbolises the authority of the House, in the manner of a ceremonial mace.

<doc id="943574" wikidata="Q901323" url="?curid=943574" title="Scooby-Doo (character)">
<text>Scoobert &quot;Scooby&quot; Doo is the eponymous character and protagonist of the animated television franchise of the same name created in 1969 by the American animation company Hanna-Barbera. He is a male Great Dane and lifelong companion of amateur detective Shaggy Rogers, with whom he shares many personality traits. He features a mix of both canine and human behaviors (reminiscent of other talking animals in Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s series), and is treated by his friends more or less as an equal. Scooby often speaks in a rhotacized way, substituting the first letters of many words with the letter &#x27;r&#x27;. His catchphrase is &quot;Scooby-Dooby-Doo!&quot;

==History==
Writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears created the original &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; series, &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;, for Hanna-Barbera as a part of CBS&#x27;s 1969–1970 Saturday morning cartoon schedule. Originally titled &quot;Mysteries Five&quot;, the dog who later became Scooby was originally more of a sidekick character – a bongo-playing dog named &quot;Too Much&quot; whose breed varied between Great Dane and sheepdog between treatments.

By the time the series was pitched to the network as &quot;Who&#x27;s S-S-Scared?&quot; in early 1969, Too Much was solidified as a cowardly Great Dane. Both the dog and the series would be renamed &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; by Fred Silverman, CBS&#x27;s head of daytime programming, between its unsuccessful first pitch and the second pitch that earned the show a green light. Silverman stated that he came up with the name from the syllables &quot;doo-be-doo-be-doo&quot; in Frank Sinatra&#x27;s hit song &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;. Though a similar name was featured in the title of the single &quot;Feelin&#x27; So Good (S.K.O.O.B.Y.-D.O.O.)&quot; released just a few months earlier in 1968 by The Archies, a fictional band from the CBS series &quot;The Archie Show&quot; that was also overseen by Silverman. There was also a character in an unsold TV pilot &quot;Swingin&#x27; Together&quot;, broadcast in 1963 on CBS, named Skooby-doo.

Taking notes from a Hanna-Barbera colleague who was also a breeder of Great Danes, production designer Iwao Takamoto designed the Scooby-Doo character with a sloping chin, spots, a long tail, a sloped back, and bow legs – all traits in direct opposition to those of a prize-winning purebred Great Dane. In defining the personality of the dog, Ruby and Spears looked for inspiration to the characters played by Bob Hope in his horror-comedies – a coward who shows traits of bravery when his friends are in danger. Veteran Hanna-Barbera voice artist Don Messick was the original voice of Scooby and spent decades working on the character.

&quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; premiered on CBS on September 13, 1969, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time. It ran for two seasons, with a total of 25 episodes. Its final first-run episode aired on October 31, 1970.

==Personality==
In most incarnations of the series, Scooby is regarded as a unique Great Dane dog who is able to speak in broken English, and usually puts the letter &quot;R&quot; in front of words and noises made. Other incarnations, such as &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;, present him as a speech-impaired dog in the larger fictional universe as nobody in Coolsville seems bothered by his speaking ability. In recent years (most notably in &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;), Scooby is able to speak in complete sentences and has more dialogue, though partially retaining his speech impediment. He consistently shows about the same level of intelligence as his friends, while also being subject to the same knack for clumsiness and moments of being dimwitted as well.

Different iterations of the character have been developed and expanded in the various series featuring the characters, many of them contradicting, such as the original series and the recent live-action films where Shaggy and Scooby first meet as older teenagers for the first time. This contradicts the animated series &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;, where they know each other from almost infancy, though the films may be seen as having a different continuity altogether than the cartoon products. As an adult canine, Scooby is usually treated as a mix of a pet and a friend by his companions.

In all versions of the character, Scooby and Shaggy share several personality traits, mostly being cowardly and perpetually hungry. Yet their friends (Fred, Daphne, and Velma) encourage them to go after the costumed villains, usually with &quot;Scooby Snacks&quot;. The biscuit-like dog treat or cookie snack is usually shaped like a bone or, in later versions of the cartoons, Scooby&#x27;s dog tag. However, Scooby&#x27;s inherent loyalty and courage do often force him to take a more heroic stance even without any prodding. Scooby is also extremely ticklish, and this is seen in many of the television series and films.

Scooby has a speech impediment and tends to pronounce most words as if they begin with an &quot;R&quot;; however, most characters are able to understand him almost perfectly. In most iterations, he keeps his sentences relatively short, usually using charades for anything longer than three or four words. His catchphrase, usually howled at the end of every production, is &quot;Scooby-Dooby-Doo!&quot; or &quot;Rooby-Rooby-Roo&quot;. Scooby was voiced by Don Messick through &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; in 1994, after which point Messick quit smoking; quitting smoking changed his voice and prevented him from achieving the same raspy vocal effect (despite Messick&#x27;s efforts, he suffered a career-ending stroke in 1996 and died in 1997, before any further &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; productions were made). Messick is also known for providing the voice of the dogs Astro on &quot;The Jetsons&quot; and Muttley (who snickered). The characteristic speech impediments of Scooby and Astro are so similar that Astro&#x27;s signature phrase, &quot;Ruh-roh!&quot;, is popularly and improperly attributed to Scooby (as in &quot;Ruh-roh, Raggy!&quot;); of the two voices, Scooby&#x27;s had a deeper and throatier timbre than Astro&#x27;s.

According to Fred in &quot;Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes&quot;, the thought of having a dog with an Adam&#x27;s apple was a little strange, but they got used to it, so when he started talking, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. But despite his special gift of speech, he did have his shortcomings like his cowardice. But as Mystery Inc. bonded, he would form a special partnership with Shaggy, comparing themselves to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Shaggy says that things just clicked and whenever the gang needs bait for a villain, they would send Shaggy and Scooby in and he says there&#x27;s no one else he would rather work with. Fred claims that the only thing that scares Scooby more than monsters is a trip to the vet.

==Appearance and anatomy==
Scooby is brown from head to toe with several distinctive black spots on his upper body and does not seem to have a melanistic mask. He is generally a quadruped but displays bipedal &#x27;human&#x27; characteristics occasionally. Scooby also has opposable thumbs and can use his front paws like hands. He has a black nose and wears an off-yellow, diamond-shaped-tagged blue collar with an &quot;SD&quot; (his initials) and has four toes on each foot. Unlike other dogs, Scooby only has one pad on each of his paws, a trait that was added to make it easier to draw in the Scooby-Doo Annuals.

Scooby has a fully prehensile tail he can use to swing from or press buttons. Both his head and tail are malleable and useful as a communication aid or creating a distraction.

Creator Iwao Takamoto later explained that before he designed the character, he first spoke to a Great Dane breeder, who described to him the desirable characteristics of a pedigree dog. Takamoto then drew Scooby as the opposite of this. He said &quot;I decided to go the opposite [way] and gave him a hump back, bowed legs, small chin and such. Even his color is wrong.&quot;

According to the official magazine that accompanied the 2002 film, Scooby is seven years old.

==Voice actors==
Don Messick originated the character&#x27;s speech patterns and provided Scooby-Doo&#x27;s voice in every &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; production from 1969 until his retirement in 1996. Voice actor Hadley Kay voiced the character for a brief period in 1997, for two episodes of &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, and a few television commercials. Scott Innes (also the then-voice of Shaggy) voiced Scooby-Doo in the 1998-2001 direct-to-video films and continued to voice the character regularly for video games (such as &quot;Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights&quot;), toys and some commercials until 2008. Neil Fanning provided the voice of the computer-generated Scooby-Doo in the 2002 live-action film and its 2004 sequel. Frank Welker (also the voice of Fred since 1969) has voiced Scooby since 2002, taking over beginning with &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot; and other spin-offs including the live-action prequels &quot;Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster&quot;. Dave Coulier and Seth Green have both voiced the character in &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;.

==Reception==
Casey Kasem, the original voice actor for Shaggy Rogers, said that Scooby is &quot;the star of the show—the Shaquille O&#x27;Neal of the show.&quot; Kasem explained, &quot;People love animals more than they love people. Am I right or wrong? They give more love to their pets than they give to people. Scooby is vulnerable and lovable and not brave, and very much like the kids who watch. But like kids, he likes to think that he&#x27;s brave.&quot;

<text>Directory Access Protocol (DAP) is a computer networking standard promulgated by ITU-T and ISO in 1988 for accessing an X.500 directory service. DAP was intended to be used by client computer systems, but was not popular as there were few implementations of the full OSI protocol stack for desktop computers available to be run on the hardware and operating systems typical of that time. The basic operations of DAP: &quot;Bind&quot;, &quot;Read&quot;, &quot;List&quot;, &quot;Search&quot;, &quot;Compare&quot;, &quot;Modify&quot;, &quot;Add&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot; and &quot;ModifyRDN&quot;, were adapted for the Novell Directory Services (NDS) and the Internet Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).

DAP is specified in X.511.

<text>&quot;Lonely Among Us&quot; is the seventh episode of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, which originally aired on November 2, 1987, in broadcast syndication in the United States. It was written by D. C. Fontana, based on a story by Michael Halperin. It was the first episode of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; to be directed by Cliff Bole.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, as the ship is en route to an interplanetary conference with delegates from the Selay and Antican races on board, a non-corporeal alien entity takes possession of various &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew members, including Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart).

This episode marked the first appearance of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; recurring cast member Marc Alaimo in a &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, as well as the second appearance of Colm Meaney who would later play &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; character Miles O&#x27;Brien. The Antican and Selay make-up was created by Michael Westmore from designs by Andrew Probert. Following the airing of the episode, fans wrote in to complain about a scene referencing cannibalism. Reviews were mostly negative, with criticism directed at the writing in particular.

==Plot==
The &quot;Enterprise&quot; is en route to the planet &quot;Parliament&quot; with delegates from two warring planets in the Beta Renner system, the reptilian Selay and the canine Antican, when the ship encounters a strange energy cloud. Unseen by the crew, Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) is hit with a strange energy discharge as the ship passes the cloud, causing him to become violent. Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) sedates Worf and brings him to the sick bay, but is also infused with the energy as she examines his body. Crusher begins to act oddly to those around her and goes to the bridge, asking questions about the ship&#x27;s navigational functions. When she questions Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) at one of the science stations, the energy sparks between her and the console, leaving her confused as to why she is on the bridge.

The ship suddenly begins to malfunction and Captain Picard sends Assistant Engineer Singh (Kavi Raz) to investigate the cause. Singh is later found dead near a computer link, and Picard orders a murder investigation, considering the alien delegates to be prime suspects. Data investigates the murder in the manner of fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, and determines that the delegates were not responsible. Meanwhile, Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) uses hypnosis on both Worf and Crusher, finding that both recall being invaded by some entity during their blackouts. The ship suddenly drops again out of warp, and as Picard investigates the readouts at a bridge console, the strange energy transfers into him. The bridge crew becomes suspicious of Picard&#x27;s actions after noting that all &quot;Enterprise&quot; systems are back to normal and that Picard has ordered them to return to the cloud.

The senior officers attempt to plead with Picard to undergo a medical examination and to step down from command, but he refuses. When they return to the cloud, Picard announces that they had picked up an entity previously when they passed the cloud, and now Picard and the entity are one. Under its influence, Picard plans to transport his energy back into the cloud, and he shoots energy at the bridge crew when they try to stop him. The crew are unable to prevent Picard from beaming off the ship. The crew spend hours trying to locate Picard to no avail, so they are forced to accept he is beyond recovery and prepare to leave. However, Troi senses the Captain&#x27;s essence nearby, and Picard manages to signal the crew through the ship&#x27;s computers. Data is able to reverse the transport, reconstituting Picard without the entity. After determining that Picard is himself again, lacking the memories since he was taken over by the entity, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; continues on to Parliament.

==Production==
===Writing and casting===

The original story by Michael Halperin contained a different subplot involving a problem with the dilithium in the warp drive of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The diplomatic conference was added by D.C. Fontana when it was developed into a teleplay. Fontana had previously worked on &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, including the episode &quot;Journey to Babel&quot;. &quot;Lonely Among Us&quot; was subsequently compared to &quot;Journey to Babel&quot;, which Fontana denied, saying, &quot;I wrote &#x27;Journey to Babel&#x27; and I wrote this too, and I feel there is a difference. There&#x27;s a definite delineation and separation here, both in intent and content.&quot; Director Cliff Bole did not recall much of the episode later, but did not think much of the script, saying &quot;The subject matter affects the end product. There&#x27;s some better written shows, obviously.&quot; It was the first episode of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; to be directed by Bole, who had previously worked on shows such as &quot;V&quot; and &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;.

Colm Meaney made his second appearance in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; after he originally appeared in the pilot, &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, as a conn ensign on the bridge. In this episode he played a security ensign, as it was not until season two that he began to play the recurring character of Miles O&#x27;Brien, who would later become a series regular on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. Another &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; actor who made his first &quot;Trek&quot; appearance in this episode was Marc Alaimo, who played an Antican who was unnamed on screen, but referred to in the script as Badar N&#x27;D&#x27;D. Alaimo went on to play several other roles in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; including as the Cardassian Gul Macet in &quot;The Wounded&quot;, before being cast as Gul Dukat in &quot;DS9&quot;. John Durbin appeared as the Selay leader, and would also go on to appear as a Cardassian later in the series, as Gul Lemec in &quot;Chain of Command&quot;. Kavi Raz played Assistant Engineer Singh, although as he was unavailable for a re-shoot, in one scene he was replaced by a wig on a chair.

===Make-up and costuming===
The Selay and the Anticans were nicknamed the &quot;snakes and the dogs&quot; by the production staff. The designs were created by Andrew Probert, who had previously been responsible for the design of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. The makeup used on them was created by supervisor Michael Westmore, which involved full headpieces and hands for two Anticans and five Selays. Because of the limited space available, the Anticans were made internally in the Paramount makeup studio while the Selays were outsourced to a different studio to sculpt the head. Once completed, a mold was made of the Selay head and the unpainted pieces were cast in latex and sent to Westmore to complete. It was intended to cast them out of lightweight polyurethane, but the first batch of Selay heads came out very heavy.

Westmore had time to re-cast two of the heads from soft foam rubber, but as each took five hours to make, there was not enough time to re-make all five. The heavier versions of the Selay heads were worn by actors in the background of the scenes, although Westmore described them as being &quot;very uncomfortable&quot;. The Antican mask did not allow for any movement at all with the exception of the actors being able to poke their tongues through the mouth opening. Although this is the only major appearance of either the Anticans or the Selay, they continued to be used as background extras in other episodes of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. Westmore repainted the Selay masks prior to reusing them in order to give the scales more of a three-dimensional look.

This was the first appearance of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; era Starfleet dress uniforms. They were based on those used by the Royal Navy in the 18th century but would be slightly altered when they re-appeared during season two. One piece of a costume introduced in this episode which never returned was the surgical cap and eyepiece worn by Doctor Crusher.

==Reception==

&quot;Lonely Among Us&quot; originally aired in broadcast syndication on November 2, 1987. It received a 12.1 rating, meaning that it was seen by 12.1 percent of all households. This was an increase from the previous week&#x27;s &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; which received a rating of 10.5.

Following the broadcast, the producers received a significant amount of mail from fans criticising the apparent cannibalism on the part of the Anticans in this episode. Several reviewers rewatched the episode following the end of the series. Keith DeCandido reviewed &quot;Lonely Among Us&quot; for Tor.com in May 2011. He gave it a score of three out of ten and was uninterested in the episode, finding the alien delegation subplot to be &quot;mostly just silly&quot;, and the majority of the episode was a &quot;weak-beer mystery that&#x27;s mostly an excuse for Gates McFadden and Sir Patrick Stewart to act weird and for Brent Spiner to be a silly Sherlock&quot;. James Hunt thought that Spiner&#x27;s Sherlock impression was &quot;completely brilliant&quot;, in his review for &quot;Den of Geek&quot; in October 2012. He thought that the episode shared some similarities with the third season of &quot;The Original Series&quot;, saying, &quot;By which I mean it looks cheap and appears to have been written by a child, in yellow crayon.&quot;

Cast member Wil Wheaton rewatched the episode for AOL TV in November 2006. He criticized the writing of Fontana in this episode, saying that around this time she appeared on a panel at a convention about how to solve &quot;The Wesley Problem&quot;, but when rewatching the episode he thought that &quot;maybe instead of sitting on this panel and trashing me, D.C Fontana could have written intelligent dialogue for me and helped solve the &#x27;Wesley problem&#x27; herself. I don&#x27;t know, maybe she tried to do that and didn&#x27;t get a lot of support from the rest of the producers and writing staff, but even I know of Dr. Channing&#x27;s theory of not writing clichéd dialogue for kids in science fiction, and then blaming the actor who is forced to deliver it.&quot; Overall he criticized the &quot;very stiff&quot; dialogue throughout the episode, and called the set-up &quot;incredibly forced&quot;. He did highlight that Data acting out as Sherlock Holmes laid the foundation of future episodes which would expand on this.

Zack Handlen reviewed the episode for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in April 2010. He too thought that the alien delegation subplot was poorly executed in a comedic fashion, and said that this &quot;combined with the slow pace and a number of dialog scenes that can be charitably described as &#x27;character development&#x27; (or more accurately as &#x27;padding&#x27;), this is an unmemorable episode that shows a series still unsure of its greatest strengths.&quot; He gave the episode a grade of &quot;C−&quot;.

==Home media release==
The first home media release of &quot;Lonely Among Us&quot; was on VHS cassette, appearing on April 1, 1992 in the United States and Canada. The episode was later included on the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; season one DVD box set, released in March 2002. The episode was released as part of the season one Blu-ray set on July 24, 2012.

Episodes from &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; to &quot;Datalore&quot; were released in Japan on LaserDisc on June 10, 1995, as part of &quot;First Season Part.1&quot;. This included the first season episode &quot;Lonely Among Us&quot;, and the box set has a total runtime of 638 minutes across multiple 12-inch optical video discs.

<doc id="943590" wikidata="Q125870673" url="?curid=943590" title="Feint">
<text>Feint, a French term that entered English via the discipline of swordsmanship and fencing, is a maneuver designed to distract or mislead. A feint is achieved by giving the impression that a certain maneuver will take place, while in fact another, or even none, will. In military tactics and many types of combat, there are two types of feints: feint attacks and feint retreats.

==Attacks==
A feint attack is designed to draw defensive action towards the point under assault. It is usually used as a diversion to force the enemy to concentrate more manpower in a given area, to weaken the opposing force in another area. Unlike a related diversionary maneuver, the demonstration, a feint involves actual contact with the enemy.

==Retreats==
A feint retreat, or feigned retreat, is performed by briefly engaging the enemy, then retreating. It is intended to draw the enemy pursuit into a prepared ambush, or to cause disarray. For example, the Battle of Hastings was lost when Saxons pursued the Norman cavalry. That forfeited the advantage of height and the line was broken, providing the opportunity to fight in single handed combat on a neutral vantage point, a battle for which the Saxons were not ready. The Parthian shot is another example of a feint retreat in which mounted Parthian archers would retreat from a battle and, still riding, they would turn their bodies back to shoot at the pursuing enemy.

==Historic use==

===Arabia during Muhammad era===
Muhammad made extensive use of feints. One of the earliest examples was during the Invasion of Banu Lahyan. Muhammad set out in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal, or Jumada Al-Ula, in the 6 AH (July 627 AD) with 200 Muslim fighters and made a feint of heading for Syria and then soon changed route towards Batn Gharran, where 10 Muslims were killed in the Expedition of Al Raji. Bani Lahyan were on alert and got the news of his march. The tribe then immediately fled to the mountaintops nearby and thus remained out of his reach. On his way back, Muhammad despatched a group of ten horsemen to a place called Kura‘ Al-Ghamim, in the vicinity of the habitation of Quraish, in order to indirectly confirm his growing military power. All the skirmishes took 14 days, after which he left back for home.

Muhammad also ordered the Expedition of Abu Qatadah ibn Rab&#x27;i al-Ansari (Batn Edam) in December 629 to divert the attention from his intention of attacking Mecca. He dispatched eight men to attack a caravan passing through Edam.

===China during the end of the Han dynasty===
During the Battle of Fancheng general Xu Huang of Cao Wei was sent to oppose Guan Yu at Fancheng District. Knowing that most of his enemy&#x27;s soldiers were composed of new recruits without training, Xu Huang did not go into battle straight away but camped behind the enemy to impose a deterrent effect. Meanwhile, he instructed his subordinates Xu Shang (徐商) and Lü Jian (呂建) to oversee the digging of trenches around the nearby enemy stronghold of Yancheng (偃城) to deceive the enemy into thinking that it was trying to cut off supplies into Yancheng. The deception worked, with the position being abandoned, which yielded Xu Huang a foothold on the battlefield. By then, a total of twelve camps had been gathered under the flag of Xu Huang. With the strengthened army, Xu Huang finally unleashed an attack on Guan Yu&#x27;s camp. The enemy encirclement had five camps and so Xu Huang spread news that he was planning to attack the main camp. He secretly attacked the other four side camps instead. When Guan Yu saw that the four side camps had been destroyed, he personally led 5,000 horsemen to meet the attackers but was eventually outmatched. Many of his soldiers were forced into the nearby Han River and drowned. The siege on Fancheng was then lifted.

<doc id="943594" wikidata="Q4549343" url="?curid=943594" title="13 Engines">
<text>13 Engines was a Canadian alternative rock band active in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Overview==
Formed in 1985 as The Ikons, the band consisted of four York University students: vocalist and songwriter John Critchley, guitarist and songwriter Mike Robbins, bassist Jim Hughes and drummer Grant Ethier. They released a self-titled independent cassette in 1986 before changing their name to 13 Engines. This name was a reference to the automobile industry in Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, Michigan, which were the first markets to embrace the band.

They spent a lot of time in Michigan and recorded their first two albums there--&quot;Before Our Time&quot; in 1987 and &quot;Byram Lake Blues&quot; in 1989; both were released by the UK label Nocturnal Records. One song from &quot;Byram Lake Blues&quot;, &quot;Beached&quot;, became a college hit and, in 1990, the band was signed to SBK Records in the United States and EMI in Canada.

In 1991, 13 Engines released their major label debut, &quot;A Blur to Me Now&quot;, which was produced by David Briggs and John Hanlon. The band received airplay for the album&#x27;s singles &quot;King of Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;Big Surprise&quot;. SBK dropped them soon afterward, although it did release an EP called &quot;Ignition&quot; which was the top singles from the band&#x27;s next album.

That album was 1993&#x27;s &quot;Perpetual Motion Machine&quot;, which was produced by Critchley and released on Atlantic Records. This album was the band&#x27;s breakthrough in Canada, spawning the hit singles &quot;More&quot;, &quot;Bred in the Bone&quot; and &quot;Smoke &amp; Ashes&quot;, and led to a spot on The Tragically Hip&#x27;s Another Roadside Attraction tour. The band also played festivals and toured with Blind Melon, The Watchmen, Moist and The Tea Party.

They followed up in 1995 with &quot;Conquistador&quot;, which gave them another hit, &quot;Beneath My Hand&quot;. While the album is considered to be 13 Engines&#x27; finest work, it did not do well commercially.

In 1996, Nocturnal Records released the band&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Perfect Largeness: The Nocturnal Years&quot;.

In June 1997, the band performed during NXNE, performing songs from a finished album. However, the album was never released and the band broke up that year.
In 2017, the Canadian label Artoffact Records released some of the band&#x27;s singles on an EP called &quot;Brave New Waves Session&quot;.

==Post-breakup==
Following the break-up of 13 Engines, Critchley continued as a solo artist and, in 2000, recorded the album &quot;Crooked Mile&quot;. Critchley, Ethier and Hughes went on to careers as producers.

<doc id="943604" wikidata="Q313702" url="?curid=943604" title="Instant film">
<text>Instant film is a type of photographic film that was introduced by Polaroid Corporation to produce a visible image within minutes or seconds of the photograph&#x27;s exposure. The film contains the chemicals needed for developing and fixing the photograph, and the camera exposes and initiates the developing process after a photo has been taken.

In earlier Polaroid instant cameras the film is pulled through rollers, breaking open a pod containing a reagent that is spread between the exposed negative and receiving positive sheet. This film sandwich develops for some time after which the positive sheet is peeled away from the negative to reveal the developed photo. In 1972, Polaroid introduced &quot;integral film&quot;, which incorporated timing and receiving layers to automatically develop and fix the photo without any intervention from the photographer.

Instant film has been available in sizes from (similar to 135 film) up to size, with the most popular film sizes for consumer snapshots being approximately (the image itself is smaller as it is surrounded by a border). Early instant film was distributed on rolls, but later and current films are supplied in packs of 8 or 10 sheets, and single sheet films for use in large format cameras with a compatible back.

Though the quality of integral instant film is not as high as conventional film, peel apart black and white film (and to a lesser extent color film) approached the quality of traditional film types. Instant film was used where it was undesirable to have to wait for a roll of conventional film to be finished and processed, e.g., documenting evidence in law enforcement, in health care and scientific applications, and producing photographs for passports and other identity documents, or simply for snapshots to be seen immediately. Some photographers use instant film for test shots, to see how a subject or setup looks before using conventional film for the final exposure. Instant film is also used by artists to achieve effects that are impossible to accomplish with traditional photography, by manipulating the emulsion during the developing process, or separating the image emulsion from the film base. Instant film has been supplanted for most purposes by digital photography, which allows the result to be viewed immediately on a display screen or printed with dye sublimation, inkjet, or laser home or professional printers.

Instant film is notable for having had a wider range of film speeds available than other negative films of the same era, having been produced in ISO 40 to ISO 20,000 (Polaroid 612). Current instant film formats typically have an ISO between 100 and 1000.

Two companies currently manufacture instant film for Polaroid cameras: Polaroid (previously The Impossible Project) for older Polaroid cameras (600, SX-70, and 8×10) and its I-Type cameras, and Supersense that manufacture pack film for Polaroid cameras under the One Instant brand.

==How it works==
Instant positive film (which produces a print) uses diffusion transfer to move the dyes from the negative to the positive via a reagent. The process varies according to the film type.

===Roll/pack film===
In 1947 Edwin H. Land introduced the Polaroid-Land process. The first instant films produced sepia tone photos. A negative sheet is exposed inside the camera, then lined up with a positive sheet and squeezed through a set of rollers which spread a reagent between the two layers, creating a developing film &quot;sandwich&quot;. The negative develops quickly, after which some of the unexposed silver halide grains (and the latent image it contains) are solubilized by the reagent and transferred by diffusion from the negative to the positive. After a minute, depending on film type and ambient temperature, the negative is peeled away to reveal the picture which was transferred to the positive receiving sheet. True black and white films were released in 1950 after problems with chemistry stabilization were overcome. 

The reagent was contained in a pod, which would be pressed and eventually broken by the rollers that would then spread the reagent across the film. The reagent contained a solvent for silver halide such as sodium thiosulfate, for example.

With that being said, photographers and enthusiasts still practice with this limited, special and discontinued film, with both older Polaroid stocks or Fujifilm FP-100C or FP-3000B varieties. Multiple companies made film backs that would adapt camera to use this film with a specific detachable back.

===Subtractive color films===
Color film is much more complex due to multiple layers of emulsion and dye. The negative consists of three emulsion layers sensitive to the primary colors (red, green, and blue) each with a layer of developing dye beneath it of the complementary color (cyan, magenta, and yellow). Once light exposed the negative, the reagent is spread between the negative and positive and the developing dye layer migrates though diffusion to the positive surface where it forms the photo. Emulsion layers exposed to their respective color block the complementary dye below it, reproducing the original color. For example, a photo of a blue sky would expose the blue emulsion, blocking all the yellow dye beneath it and allowing the magenta and cyan dye layers to migrate to the positive to form blue.

===Integral film===
This process is similar to subtractive color instant film with added timing and receiving layers. Land&#x27;s solution was to incorporate an opacifier, which would darken when ejected from the camera, and then become clear to reveal the photograph. The film itself integrates all the layers to expose, develop, and fix the photo into a plastic envelope and frame commonly associated with a Polaroid photo. 

There are two kinds of integral instant photographic film: one where the side that is exposed to light, is opposite to that used to view the photograph, and another where the same side is used for exposing the photograph and viewing it, developed by Kodak. Again to develop the film a pod with a reagent on one side of the film is broken and the contents are spread within the integral film.

For films with the same view/expose side the reagent had white pigment, opacifying dyes, potassium hydroxide, and a thickener, which would be spread on top of a stack of (from top to bottom) cyan dye developer, red-sensitive silver halide emulsion, an interlayer, magenta dye developer, green-sensitive silver halide emulsion, an interlayer, a yellow dye developer, a blue-sensitive silver halide emulsion, and an anti-abrasive layer. This stack would be on top of an opaque polyester back. Above the reagent would be an image-receiving mordant layer, a timing layer, an acid layer and a clear polyester layer. The pigment would be white titania in a suspension, and the opacifying dyes would be opaque at high pH levels but mostly transparent at low pH levels. The developers would contain metals such as copper for cyan, and chromium for magenta and yellow. These would form metal-containing dyes, with better lightfastness. Eventually this type of film from Polaroid received a silver-ion catalyzed process for dye release for the magenta and yellow dye layers. 

Instant films with different view and expose sides had, as seen from the view side, from the front towards the back of the film, in layers: A backing layer, a clear polyester layer, a mordant to receive the image in the film, a titanium white light reflecting layer, a carbon black opaque layer, a releaser for the cyan dye, an emulsion sensitive to red for film reversal and a nucleating agent, an oxidized developer scavenger, a releaser for the magenta dye, an emulsion sensitive to green for film reversal and a nucleating agent, another oxidized developer scavenger, a releaser for the yellow dye, an with emulsion sensitive to blue for film reversal and a nucleating agent, a UV absorbing topcoat, a mixture of processing reagents such as potassium hydroxide, a film developer, carbon, a thickener, antifoggant and sulfite, two timing layers, an acid polymer, a clear polyester layer and a backing layer facing the expose side of the film.

The reagent is highly alkaline and when spread across the top of the stack, it solubilizes or dissolves and moves the chemicals in the stack, which starts the photographic developing process. The silver halide that is exposed to light undergoes redox reactions with developer, and leaves free, undeveloped silver halide with silver ions that can modify image-forming dyes. The solubility and thus diffusivity of the dyes changes locally according to the local levels of these silver ions and in turn controls the amounts of dye that can diffuse to the image-receiving layer, and in which places.

The dyes then diffuse through the stack and the reagent, driven by electrostatic and chemical gradients, and deposit into the image-receiving layer. The reagent is what allows the dyes to move up the stack via diffusion. Dye release frees dye molecules to move up the stack via diffusion into the image-receiving layer. 
===Additive color film===
Additive film (such as Polavision and Polachrome slide film) uses a color mask of microscopically thin transparent red, green, and blue lines (3000 lines per inch) and a black and white emulsion layer to reproduce color images in transparency film. The resulting dye developers (unexposed emulsion) block the colors not needed and project the color or combination of colors which form in the resulting image. Since the lines are so close to each other, the human eye easily blended the primary colors together to form the correct color, much like an LCD display or television. For instance, a photo of a yellow flower would expose the emulsion beneath the red and green masks and not the blue mask. The developing process removed the exposed emulsion (under the red and green masks) and diffused the unexposed dye developer (under the blue mask) to its receiving layer, blocking light from coming through. This resulted in the projected light shining through the red and green masks but not the blue mask, creating the color yellow. Because of the film density, film speeds were necessarily slow. High precision was required for the production of this film.

==Film brands==

===Polaroid===

Polaroid Corporation invented and produced the widest range of instant film. Roll film was distributed in two separate negative and positive rolls and developed inside the camera. It was introduced in 1948 and was manufactured until 1992. Sheet film was introduced in 1958 for 4x5&quot; film holder #500. Each sheet contains a reagent pod, negative and receiving positive, and was loaded separately and developed outside the film holder. In 1973 Polaroid introduced 8x10&quot; Instant film. Pack film was distributed in a film pack which contained both negative and positive sheets and was developed outside the camera. It was introduced in 1963. Integral film is also distributed in a film pack, but each film envelope contains all the chemical layers to expose, develop, and fix the photo. It was introduced in 1972.

Polavision was an instant motion picture film. Polavision was introduced by Polaroid in 1978, with an image format similar to Super 8 mm film, and based on an additive color process. Polavision required a specific camera and tabletop viewer, and was not a commercial success, but did lead to the development of an instant 35 mm color slide film. Polachrome was an easy to develop 35 mm film, available in color, monochrome and &#x27;blue&#x27; formats (the latter intended for making title cards). Each roll of film came with a cartridge containing developing chemicals which were pressed between the film and a developing strip by a hand-cranked machine called the AutoProcessor. The AutoProcessor was very cheap and did not require a darkroom; the results were somewhat variable, the resolution was not as good as conventional film due to the matrix of tiny red, green and blue filters required to make the monochrome emulsion work in color, and the sensitivity was low, even for slide film; in tungsten light, Polachrome CS is rated at ISO 40. It was introduced in 1983.

Polaroid integral film packs usually contain a flat &quot;Polapulse&quot; electrical battery, which powers systems in the camera, including exposure and focusing mechanisms, electronic flash, and a film ejection motor. The inclusion of the battery within the film pack ensures that a fresh battery is available with each new pack of film.

====Preservation====
Polaroids have the same storage standards under ISO 18920:2000 as any other photograph. Regular storage conditions should be less than 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) and between 50% and 30% relative humidity (RH). Cold storage (0 degrees Fahrenheit / -17 degrees Celsius optimum) is not helpful unless RH can be controlled and cold storage RH is generally drier than required. RH below 30% will create an environment that is too dry and may cause the photograph to curl. A Polaroid transfer removes the emulsion from the plastic backing and residual chemicals, offering an alternate form of preservation.

====End of and resumption of production====
In February 2008, Polaroid (by then under the control of Thomas J. Petters of Petters Group Worldwide) announced it would cease production of all instant film; the company shut down three factories and laid off 450 workers. In 2017, the Impossible Project acquired the rights to Polaroid&#x27;s formats and trademarks, and, renaming itself Polaroid B.V., resumed production of Polaroid film.

===Kodak===

Kodak manufactured the negative component of Polaroid&#x27;s instant film from 1963 to 1969, when Polaroid decided to manufacture its own. Kodak&#x27;s original plan was to create packfilm type instant products. There were many prototypes and test runs of the film with many private demonstrations to their board. Plans changed when Polaroid in 1972 released the integral type film with the introduction of the SX-70 system. Kodak decided to scrap the plans for packfilm release and focus on an integral type process. A few years later Kodak introduced its own instant film products in 1976, which was different from Polaroid&#x27;s in several ways:

Kodak instant film was exposed from the back without a mirror, the opposite of Polaroid&#x27;s film which was exposed from the front with a mirror to reverse the image. Kodak used a matte finish on the front, made possible by exposing the film through the back. The negative and empty pod could be removed by peeling it off of the back of the print. Unlike Polaroid&#x27;s integral film packs, Kodak&#x27;s did not contain a battery, and used conventional batteries. Kodak&#x27;s PR 10 film was found to have light fading stability issues.

Polaroid filed suit against Eastman Kodak in April 1976 for the infringement of ten patents held by Edwin Land and others on his development team relating to instant photography. In September 1985, the United States District Court of Massachusetts ruled that seven patents were valid and infringed, two were invalid but infringed, and one was valid but not infringed by Kodak. Kodak appealed but was denied and an injunction prohibiting production of their instant film and cameras was put into effect. Kodak&#x27;s appeal to the Supreme Court was denied a few months later, and in January 1986, Kodak announced it would no longer be producing their instant line of products. In 1991, Polaroid was awarded $925 million in damages from Kodak.

====Alternative Kodak instant film====
While Kodak instant films have been discontinued, Fuji&#x27;s instant film available in Japan since the 1980s is very similar to Kodak&#x27;s. The pictures are the same size, the cartridge is almost the same, with some easy plastic modifications; the Fuji Fotorama series film can be made to fit. It was closest to the Kodak with the ISO at 160, many of the camera&#x27;s brightness controls can be adjusted to work with the different ISO; However, the FI-10 series was discontinued in 2004. The faster ISO 800 instant films will work as well but would require the use of a filter either on the film cartridge or lens.

===Fujifilm===
In Japan, Fujifilm introduced their own line of instant photographic products in 1981 starting with the &quot;Fotorama&quot; line of cameras. The name Fotorama came from photograph and panorama, as the film was a wide format compared to the square Polaroid SX-70/600 films. These Integral films developed similar to Kodak&#x27;s with the back layer first. This presented a major problem for Fujifilm because of the ongoing litigation between Kodak and Polaroid. Polaroid also has a separate suit with Fujifilm and their instant film patents in Japan. When Kodak lost, Fujifilm was able to work with Polaroid to allow their cameras and films to remain in the market, provided that they have a technology sharing agreement. Polaroid was interested in branching out to magnetic media in the boom of the videotape era and had acquired a company called MagMedia Ltd. Fujifilm has a long history in magnetic media dating to the mid-1950s. This led to Polaroid having access to Fujifilm&#x27;s extensive electronic, video tape and floppy disc magnetic products. This allowed Fujifilm access to Polaroid&#x27;s film technology.

By the mid-1980s Fujifilm introduced the higher &quot;ISO System 800&quot; series, followed by the &quot;ACE&quot; series in the mid-1990s. Instant ACE is nearly identical to System 800, the only difference is the design of the plastic cartridge in the ACE do not contain the spring mechanism (the spring is in the camera). Most of these products were available only in the Japanese market, until the release of &quot;Instax&quot; series of cameras in 1998. Fujifilm originally wanted to release the Instax series worldwide including North America and Europe simultaneously, but decided to work with Polaroid on the &quot;mio camera&quot; based on the Instax mini 10 for the US market; while Canada did get the Instax Wide 100. Another product was Fujifilm&#x27;s Digital Instax Pivi film for their battery powered portable printer which was made available for those who wanted to print from their mobile phone via infrared, USB and Bluetooth.
Fujifilm makes pack film for their passport camera systems, and had been available outside Japan since the mid-1980s. No legal issues arose with Fuji&#x27;s peel apart instant films as Polaroid&#x27;s patents had expired. While very popular in Australia as a cheaper alternative to Polaroid, it was generally not too well known elsewhere due to Polaroid&#x27;s dominance in most countries. In 2000, Fuji decided to change the way they manufacture pack film, making the entire pack out of plastic instead of a metal and plastic combination. Fujifilm announced at PMA 2003 that pack film would be made available to the North American market.

With the discontinuation of Polaroid instant film in 2008, Fuji started to export more of their instant film products to overseas markets, starting with making an increased variety of pack films available. In November 2008 the Instax Wide format was available in the US with the Instax 200 camera. Instax mini series of cameras and films became available in the US during the second half of 2009, with the mini 7s, also an updated Instax 210 replaced the Instax 200. Fujifilm&#x27;s FP-100b45 was announced in Sept of 2009 for the US market. The FP-3000b45 arrived in the North American market in Jan 2011, after Fujifilm Japan stopped manufacturing FP-100b, but was discontinued in 2012. In late 2012 Fujifilm discontinued FP-3000B, followed by the discontinuation of FP-100C in spring 2016. In April 2017 Fujifilm announced the Instax SQUARE 1:1 format and compatible Instax SQ10 camera. Many major large format photographers use polaroids to examine what their film will develop into before shooting on film. 

Fujifilm instant films include:

===== Modifications and Adaptation =====
Since the stop of production of the packfilm, most photographers are using the existing stock available on the market. With analog photography being an increasing interest to more people, people have been adapting older cameras like the Polaroid Land cameras 110A, 110B or 120, as these cameras have manual control, allowing photographers to have complete exposure control. Instant option is an online shop that is dedicated to sure modification service as well as other polaroid or instant film camera related modifications. There are also a lot of interest in having this as a personal project, as to make a functional camera does not require an extreme amount of work; articles from The phoblographer.com shows the process of doing such modifications.

===The Impossible Project / Polaroid Originals===
A group called the Impossible Project acquired Polaroid&#x27;s old equipment and factory in Enschede, in the Netherlands. On their website they stated:

We aim to re-start production of analog instant film for vintage Polaroid cameras in 2010.

and

&quot;The Impossible mission is not to re-build Polaroid Integral film but (with the help of strategic partners) to develop a new product with new characteristics, consisting of new optimised components, produced with a streamlined modern setup. An innovative and fresh analog material, sold under a new brand name that perfectly will match the global re-positioning of Integral Films.&quot;
On March 22, 2010, it was announced they were successful in manufacturing instant film compatible with Polaroid SX-70/600 instant cameras. Two new products were announced — PX100 and PX600. Their PX100 Silver Shade instant film is a manipulable, monochromatic replacement of old Polaroid brand instant film compatible with SX-70 cameras while the PX600 Silver Shade instant film is compatible with 600 cameras. That formulation has since been supplanted by improved films.

The company, renamed Polaroid Originals in 2017, produces 600, SX-70, Spectra and 8×10 color and monochrome film packs with a variety of colored borders. It also produces I-Type film packs that differ from traditional 600 packs in their omission of the battery (thus lowering costs), for use in its Impossible I-1 camera (released in 2016), its Polaroid OneStep 2 camera (released in September 2017), and its Polaroid OneStep+ (released in September 2018).

===PLR IP Holdings, LLC===
Summit Global Group, using the Polaroid brand, produced an instant photography camera and film starting with the Polaroid PIC 300, based on Fujifilm&#x27;s Instax Mini 7.

* 300, ISO 800, color (a rebranded Fujifilm Instax Mini 7)

===New55 FILM===
A company called New55 Holdings, LLC, (&quot;New55 FILM&quot;) based in Ashland, Massachusetts, brought to market a black and white 4x5 positive-negative material that is exposed and processed in a Polaroid 545 holder. New55 PN provided a positive print and a 4x5 negative that could be scanned, contact printed, or enlarged. Winding up their proof-of-principle R&amp;D phase, New55 Holdings, LLC, ceased operations in December 2017, but under a new structure restarted production of New55 100 and 400 speed instant 4X5 film sold through Famous-Format&#x27;s online store .

== Toxicity ==
The liquid chemicals for the developing process contained in the more common instant photo sheets are caustic and can cause chemical burns. If these chemicals come into contact with skin, they should be washed off immediately.

<doc id="943617" wikidata="Q4044256" url="?curid=943617" title="Midnight Syndicate">
<text>Midnight Syndicate is an American musical duo that has been working primarily in the genre of neoclassical dark ambient music since 1997 and is based in Chardon, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland.

The band refers to their CDs as &quot;soundtracks for the imagination&quot; or &quot;soundtracks to imaginary films&quot;. Their songs are characterized by a blend of instrumental music and sound effects and are commonly used to provide atmosphere during the Halloween season, in haunted attractions, theme parks, and in the role-playing game industry.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1996–1998)===
Composer/filmmaker Edward Douglas formed Midnight Syndicate in 1996 shortly after releasing a micro-budget, direct-to-video horror film called &quot;The Dead Matter (1996)&quot; which he directed and scored and would later remake. Midnight Syndicate&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released the following year. A majority of music on the album was written, arranged, and performed by Edward Douglas. Contributors included Scott Angus, Mark Rakocy, Dennis Carleton, Jamie Barbour, Ray Portler, the rap act Dark Side, and Christopher Robichaud. Douglas coined the term &quot;cine-fusion&quot; to describe the album. &quot;Cine-fusion&quot; is described in the album&#x27;s liner notes as
:&quot;a blending of movie soundtrack music and pop music ... a compilation of soundtracks to movies that do not exist. The goal of the music is to stimulate the imaginations of listeners so that they are able to transport themselves to worlds or movies of their own creation.&quot;
Musically, the album contained an eclectic blend of styles including everything from dark instrumental music (of which three tracks appeared on future releases), rock, rock-a-billy, techno, rap, new-age, comedy music, jazz, and space. Movie-style sound effects were employed in some tracks. In March 1998, a multimedia show was produced by Douglas and his company, Entity Productions, to support the album. The show included a blending of original short films, live music, animation, and stage performers.

===Breakout (1998–2000)===
In 1998, Douglas teamed up with gothic fantasy artist Joseph Vargo, and the two decided to create an exclusively dark-themed instrumental Midnight Syndicate album, &quot;the result of Joseph Vargo&#x27;s desire to produce an album that people could play in the background of their Halloween parties.&quot; Vargo developed the storyline and concept of a musical journey through a haunted castle, with the music reflecting his gothic artwork, &quot;in addition to being integral to many of the creative decisions on the album.&quot; Composer Gavin Goszka, formerly a solo artist in a project called &quot;Lore,&quot; also joined Douglas and Vargo in the new Midnight Syndicate line-up. Together, they created &quot;Born of the Night&quot;, a groundbreaking album that appealed to fans of gothic music, the horror genre, and haunted attractions. Douglas and Goszka wrote and performed the music on the album while Vargo served as executive producer and creative director of the project, as well as writing and performing the vocals and narrations, and designing the cover art and packaging. The album and songs were also titled after several of Vargo&#x27;s most popular paintings. &quot;Born of the Night&quot; was independently released in September 1998 through Vargo&#x27;s Monolith Graphics and Douglas&#x27; Entity Productions, hitting the horror market just in time for the Halloween season. It was Midnight Syndicate&#x27;s first critically acclaimed gothic-horror soundtrack and proved to be an instant success, establishing Midnight Syndicate&#x27;s trademark sound.

In March 2000, &quot;Realm of Shadows&quot; followed suit with the same flavor of dark instrumental music and another gothic setting. Douglas and Goszka wrote all of the music for this album while Vargo wrote and performed the opening narration and theme story. Again, the songs were titled after Vargo&#x27;s artworks. Both albums were featured as official soundtracks for Universal Studios&#x27; &quot;Halloween Horror Nights&quot;, and used in several other major theme parks during Halloween, such as Busch Gardens, Cedar Point, Kennywood Park, and Thorpe Park&#x27;s &quot;Fright Nights&quot; event. The heavy metal band King Diamond also featured tracks from &quot;Born of the Night&quot; as opening music for their 2000 US tour. Afterwards, Vargo and Midnight Syndicate chose to work separately of one another on future projects.

===Rise (2001–2006)===
Midnight Syndicate&#x27;s third gothic horror soundtrack, &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot;, was released in 2001. This time Douglas and Goszka teamed up with two members who worked on the first &quot;Midnight Syndicate&quot; CD, Mark Rakocy (graphic design) and Christopher Robichaud (vocals). Set in a Victorian haunted mental institution called Haverghast Asylum, &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; was the first Midnight Syndicate disc to feature the fictitious Haverghast family, a theme the band would revisit on future discs such as &quot;The 13th Hour&quot; and &quot;Bloodlines&quot;. Gavin Goszka has since called &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; &quot;a personal favorite&quot; from the Midnight Syndicate library.

During the 2001 Halloween weekend, six of the band&#x27;s mp3 singles were in the Top 20 for all of MP3.com (#1, No. 2, No. 7, No. 10, No. 12, and No. 19) registering over 100,000 listens in three days. The title track from &quot;Born of the Night&quot; remained at No. 1 for over a week with two tracks from &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; maintaining their positions in the Top 40 as well.

In August 2002, the band released their fifth studio album &quot;Vampyre&quot;. The vampire-themed disc was the first Midnight Syndicate disc to feature a cover designed by fantasy artist Keith Parkinson.

By this time, the band&#x27;s popularity with role-playing gamers who used their discs as background for their sessions had grown to where they were exhibiting at gaming conventions. It was at one of these conventions that the band was approached by designers from Wizards of the Coast. The result was 2003&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Official Role-playing Soundtrack&quot;, the first officially licensed soundtrack to the classic roleplaying game of the same name. The album (whose fantasy themes were a departure from previous releases) was generally well received by music critics and the gaming community and helped the band build their following in Europe. Some of the tracks were later used in computer games &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate - Dark Alliance II&quot; and &quot;Shadowbane&quot; expansions &quot;Rise of Chaos&quot; and &quot;Throne of Oblivion&quot;.

In August 2005, the band returned to darker themes with their seventh CD entitled &quot;The 13th Hour.&quot; Featuring vocal effects by Lily Lane of the horror-rock band Lazy Lane and cover art by Keith Parkinson the disc is set in a haunted Victorian mansion and features tracks like: &quot;Fallen Grandeur&quot;, &quot;Grisly Reminder&quot;, and &quot;Family Secrets&quot;. The album would become one of their most popular titles, winning awards in the gaming industry, and inspiring a prequel-themed release, 2021&#x27;s &quot;Bloodlines&quot;.

&quot;Out of the Darkness (Retrospective: 1994–1999)&quot; was released in 2006 and featured re-recorded versions of tracks from &quot;Midnight Syndicate&quot;, &quot;Born of the Night&quot;, and &quot;Realm of Shadows&quot;, along with some of Edward Douglas’ early horror film scores including &quot;The Dead Matter (1995)&quot;. Fantasy artist Rob Alexander designed the cover. The track &quot;Into The Abyss&quot; was featured as the outtro on the Misfits 2013 live album, &quot;DEA.D ALIVE!&quot; In 2015, the album was included in Rue Morgue Magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Essential Horror Albums - Discs That Created, Evolved, or Defined Genre Music Through the Decades&quot;.

===&quot;The Rage&quot; and &quot;The Dead Matter&quot; (2007–2010)===
In early 2007, the band temporarily shifted from creating &quot;soundtracks to imaginary films&quot; to composing music for actual projects when they completed the score to Robert Kurtzman&#x27;s, &quot;The Rage&quot; and wrote music for Universal Orlando&#x27;s &quot;Halloween Horror Nights 17&#x27;s Carnival of Carnage.&quot; &quot;The Rage: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; was released in February 2008.

In September 2007, Douglas returned to filmmaking as director, co-producer, and composer of an updated remake of his 1995 horror film, &quot;The Dead Matter&quot;. The remake stars Andrew Divoff, Tom Savini, and Jason Carter, and was co-produced by Kurtzman. During this time, Gavin Goszka started a solo project called Parlormuse which featured Victorian era songs re-recorded in a modern folk rock style.

In August 2008, the band released &quot;The Dead Matter: Cemetery Gates&quot;, a CD of music inspired by the themes from the &quot;The Dead Matter&quot; movie. Midnight Syndicate&#x27;s first two music videos were made for the songs &quot;Dark Legacy&quot; and &quot;Lost&quot; from the disc. In the finale of the music video for &quot;Dark Legacy&quot;, Edward Douglas and Gavin Goszka are shown playing on stage at the historic Phantasy Theater in Cleveland, Ohio. It marked the first time they had played together live.

On July 30, 2010 &quot;The Dead Matter&quot; movie was released in DVD along with a Midnight Syndicate &quot;greatest hits-style&quot; compilation CD called &quot;Halloween Music Collection&quot; and an EP entitled &quot;The Dark Masquerade&quot; featuring gothic artist Destini Beard performing operatic vocals and lyrics to various Midnight Syndicate recordings. &quot;The Dead Matter: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; was also released in July 30. The CD featured the score by Edward Douglas, other music that appeared in the film, and several remixes of Midnight Syndicate tracks by other artists.

===The 2010s and &quot;Midnight Syndicate Live!&quot; (2010–2019)===
In August 2011, the band released its fourteenth studio album, entitled &quot;Carnival Arcane&quot;. The theme of the CD surrounds a fictional turn of the century traveling circus called The Lancaster Rigby Carnival. The CD was inspired by research into carnivals of that time period and Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;. In 2012, the album won the Best CD category in the 2012 Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards.

In August 2012 Destini Beard released the followup to her 2010 EP, &quot;The Dark Masquerade&quot;. The full-length CD once again featured Destini&#x27;s original vocals and lyrics blended with previously recorded Midnight Syndicate tracks. The disc featured a remix by Pat Berdysz of the Electro-industrial band Encoder and an original song written and performed entirely by Destini entitled, &quot;My Last Goodbye&quot;. The CD is set in a haunted Victorian hotel and features cover art by Destini&#x27;s father, fantasy artist, Ed Beard, Jr. In February 2013, the band&#x27;s song &quot;Into The Abyss&quot; from their &quot;Out of the Darkness&quot; CD was featured as an outtro on the Misfits live album, &quot;DEA.D Alive&quot;.

In 2013, the band scored the horror creature feature film, &quot;Axe Giant: The Revenge of Paul Bunyan&quot;. The film is a dark contemporary take on the legend of Paul Bunyan and premiered on the Syfy Channel in June 2013. In July 2013 the band released a new studio album entitled &quot;Monsters of Legend&quot;. Featuring images from &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Werewolf of London&quot; on the cover, the album was influenced by classic Universal Monsters, Hammer Films, Amicus Productions, and Euro Horror films from the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s as well as composers like James Bernard, Bernard Herrmann, and Max Steiner. The album won the Best CD category in the 2014 Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards.

In March 2014, the band announced plans for a series of live multimedia concerts entitled &quot;Midnight Syndicate Live! Legacy of Shadows&quot; that would run at the amusement park Cedar Point&#x27;s HalloWeekends event beginning in September 2014. They also announced that they would be teaming up with special effects artist, Robert Kurtzman who worked on &quot;The Dead Matter&quot; as well as director Gary Jones and &quot;Face Off&quot; contestants, Beki Ingram and David Greathouse. The show opened on September 12 to very positive reviews. The Akron Beacon Journal described it as &quot;Part concert, part movie, part theater, part just plain creepy,&quot; going on to call it &quot;top-notch and ambitious.&quot;
In September 2015, the band released, a &quot;Yuletide-inspired&quot; album entitled, &quot;Christmas: A Ghostly Gathering&quot;. Billed as &quot;the band’s unique twist on classic Christmas carols blended with new and original material,&quot; the album was seen as an effort to take the band&#x27;s Halloween-associated sound and apply it to a Christmas theme. In a November 2016 interview, Edward Douglas called it &quot;one of my favorite albums Midnight Syndicate has ever done.&quot;

In April 2016, the band announced that it was teaming up with tabletop game designers, Twilight Creations, to create a soundtrack for that company&#x27;s award-winning zombie apocalypse-themed board game &quot;Zombies!!!&quot;. The &quot;Zombies!!! Official Board Game Soundtrack&quot; was released in September of that year. The album was praised for its effectiveness for use with the game as well as its appropriateness for use as background music during the Halloween season.

In September 2017, the band returned to Cedar Point with a new production of their &quot;Midnight Syndicate Live!&quot; show. Staged inside the Jack Aldrich Theater, the show once again ran as a part of the amusement park&#x27;s HalloWeekends event. They followed it up in 2018 with a new show entitled &quot;Midnight Syndicate: Conspiracy of Shadows&quot; which WBLZ Media&#x27;s Daniel James called the band&#x27;s &quot;most ambitious project to date&quot; and &quot;one of the best stage shows in the country.&quot; In the band&#x27;s blog, Gavin Goszka mentioned that the 2018 show marked the conclusion of a loose trilogy that consisted of the band&#x27;s first three productions at Cedar Point.

In March 2019, the band announced that they would be returning to Cedar Point for a third consecutive year. Gavin stated that the new show would be &quot;taking things in a new direction,&quot; with Edward Douglas adding that he felt it was something that would appeal to fans of &quot;Twilight Zone.&quot;

===Recent projects (2020–present)===
In 2020, plans for a fourth consecutive &quot;Midnight Syndicate Live!&quot; show at Cedar Point were canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. In August, a limited-edition album, entitled &quot;Music of Halloween Horror Nights&quot; was made available at the Universal Studios Florida Halloween Horror Nights Tribute Store. The album featured songs created by Midnight Syndicate specifically for Halloween Horror Nights in addition to other tracks that had been used at the event and on the event&#x27;s websites since 1999. 500 hand-numbered copies were made available on red vinyl. &quot;Music of Halloween Horror Nights&quot; sold out in less than three hours.

Midnight Syndicate released its first live album in June 2021. Entitled &quot;Live Shadows&quot;, the album consisted of new material and newly arranged live versions of music from throughout the band&#x27;s career. Recorded at &quot;Midnight Syndicate Live!&quot; shows from 2014 through 2019, the album was released along with music videos that showcased the productions the group had performed at Cedar Point&#x27;s HalloWeekends to date.

In August 2021, Midnight Syndicate released its fourteenth studio album, &quot;Bloodlines&quot;, which debuted at #12 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Classical Crossover charts. Created as a prequel to 2005&#x27;s &quot;The 13th Hour&quot;, the album&#x27;s last track, &quot;Sands of Time&quot;, is meant to segue directly into the first track of &quot;The 13th Hour.&quot; &quot;Bloodlines&quot; expanded upon the backstory of the Haverghast family that was established on both the &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; and &quot;The 13th Hour&quot; albums.

In September 2021, Universal Studios Florida reissued 2020&#x27;s &quot;Music of Halloween Horror Nights&quot; album on limited-edition orange vinyl featuring new artwork and four additional tracks on the digital download version. Once again, the album sold out within days of its release. A third limited-edition vinyl pressing of &quot;Music of Halloween Horror Nights&quot; was released on October 5. This picture disc version featured the iconic Halloween Horror Nights character, Jack the Clown, on the cover and included a slightly different lineup of songs. Edward Douglas and Gavin Goszka commemorated this particular reissue with a signing at Universal Studios Florida which also included the albums&#x27; cover artists, Jose Pardo and Luis Orazi. That September also marked the return of the band to Cedar Point&#x27;s HalloWeekends event where they staged a remount of their 2018 &quot;Midnight Syndicate: Conspiracy of Shadows&quot; multimedia performances.

To celebrate their 25th Anniversary in 2022, the band relaunched its Legions of the Night fan community featuring a fan-generated &quot;best of&quot; compilation entitled &quot;Legions of the Night Volume 1&quot;. In August, Universal Orlando and Midnight Syndicate teamed up again to release another limited-edition vinyl album. The new album, entitled &quot;Legendary Truth: The Collective&quot;, featured packaging that referenced elements from the event&#x27;s past including: previous icons, Legions of Horror, and the in-park experience, &quot;Legendary Truth: The Collective&quot;. Additionally, in 2022, the band commemorated its 25-year association with Cedar Point&#x27;s HalloWeekends by producing and performing a new show entitled, &quot;Midnight Hour: 25 Years of HalloWeekends and Midnight Syndicate&quot;. A compilation album entitled, &quot;HalloWeekends: 25 Years of Terror Together&quot; was released and sold in the park. The new album featured songs that had been heavily used at the park over the previous 25 years as well as new music from the &quot;Midnight Hour&quot; show.

 In August 2023, the band released it&#x27;s fifteenth studio album, &quot;The Brimstone Club&quot;. The album&#x27;s &quot;shadowy theatre&quot; theme was inspired by the Parisian Cabaret de L&#x27;Enfer, a 19th-century hell-themed cabaret that band member Edward Douglas described as the first themed restaurant and forerunner to the modern day haunted attraction. The album debuted at #2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Classical Crossover charts on September 2, 2023. In support of the album, the band produced an outdoor live show with Cedar Point&#x27;s HalloWeekends entitled &quot;Echoes from the Brimstone Club&quot; which incorporated music from the album, cirque-type specialty acts, and pyrotechnics.

==Musicianship==
===Influences===
Douglas cites film composers Danny Elfman, James Horner, John Carpenter, Hans Zimmer, heavy metal acts King Diamond and Black Sabbath, radio dramas, and horror film scores as primary musical influences for Midnight Syndicate. He has cited Hammer Film Productions, the art of Joseph Vargo, Alchemy Gothic, and Keith Parkinson, the books of Stephen King, &quot;Tales From the Crypt&quot; comics, and Role-playing games as sources of inspiration. He has said that Joseph Vargo&#x27;s input was critical on the &quot;Born of the Night&quot; CD. In a 2010 interview, Goszka cited similar musical influences (Elfman, Carpenter, King Diamond, and Sabbath) as well as Dead Can Dance.

==Legacy==
===Impact on Halloween music and haunted attraction industry===
The group&#x27;s music is commonly used as atmosphere for Halloween-themed events, stores, and parties (including Hugh Hefner&#x27;s), as well as home decorating for trick-or-treating. Heather Adler credits them as helping to legitimize the genre of Halloween music (music for the Halloween holiday), elevating standards in the genre, and inspiring other musicians to create similar projects. On September 11, 2009, AOL Radio released a list of the Top 10 Best Halloween Music CDs as ranked by AOL/CBS Radio listeners. Three of the ten CDs were Midnight Syndicate discs (&quot;Born of the Night&quot; No. 8, &quot;Realm of Shadows&quot; No. 4, and &quot;Vampyre&quot; No. 3), ranking behind Danny Elfman&#x27;s &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; and John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; soundtrack. In 2015, Rue Morgue Magazine cited Midnight Syndicate&#x27;s continued influence in the haunted attraction industry as well their &quot;entrenchment&quot; in the celebration of the Halloween season among their reasons for including &quot;Out of the Darkness (Retrospective: 1994–1999)&quot; among their &quot;50 Essential Horror Albums - Discs That Created, Evolved, or Defined Genre Music Through the Decades&quot;.

Midnight Syndicate was the first company to produce soundtracks of quality specifically for the haunted attraction industry. In 2005, Leonard Pickel, editor of &quot;Haunted Attraction Magazine&quot; estimated that &quot;75-90% of the attractions in the industry had at least one Midnight Syndicate CD.&quot; Their music is also used by amusement parks such as Universal Orlando, Busch Gardens, Kings Island, Six Flags, Cedar Point, and Kennywood Park hold Halloween-themed events such as Thorpe Park Fright Nights, Halloween Horror Nights, HalloWeekends, Howl-O-Scream, and Fright Fest. In the liner notes to 2020&#x27;s, &quot;Music of Halloween Horror Nights&quot; album, Vice President of Entertainment, Art and Design at Universal Orlando, T.J. Mannarino said, &quot;It is difficult to overemphasize how much the music of Midnight Syndicate played in the historic success of Halloween Horror Nights.&quot; In 2020, Midnight Syndicate received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the haunted attraction website, City Blood.

===Impact on role-playing game industry===
Midnight Syndicate has a significant following in the role-playing game community. Their &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons CD&quot; broke previous sales records for gaming soundtracks in its first month. Their &quot;The 13th Hour&quot; CD won the Origins Award for Best Gaming Accessory presented by the Academy of Adventure Game Art &amp; Design, marking the first time a role-playing soundtrack or music CD had won the award. &quot;The 13th Hour&quot; also became the first music CD to win an award at the ENnies, a fan-based annual award show for role-playing game publishers and products. In 2007, Midnight Syndicate teamed up with Goodman Games to produce &quot;Cages of Delirium&quot; a Dungeon Crawl Classics adventure based on &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; which came packaged with the CD. The &quot;Cages of Delirium&quot; module was nominated for an ENnie Award as well as the band&#x27;s &quot;Carnival Arcane&quot; album in 2012, their &quot;Monsters of Legend&quot; album in 2014, and their &quot;Zombies!!! Official Board Game Soundtrack&quot; in 2016.

==Distribution==
When record labels and distributors rejected the band&#x27;s first two CDs, Douglas began building his own distribution network by selling CDs out of his van with Goszka and cold-calling hundreds of stores. Today Midnight Syndicate&#x27;s CDs are self-distributed to thousands of retailers worldwide through Entity Productions, Inc. and its partners, making them one of the largest distributors of Halloween-themed music. In addition to Dee Snider&#x27;s Halloween-themed music act, Van Helsing&#x27;s Curse, Entity Productions also distributed the 2010 version of &quot;The Dead Matter&quot; movie.

<doc id="943622" wikidata="Q411094" url="?curid=943622" title="Ibotenic acid">
<text>Ibotenic acid or (&quot;S&quot;)-2-amino-2-(3-hydroxyisoxazol-5-yl)acetic acid, also referred to as ibotenate, is a chemical compound and psychoactive drug which occurs naturally in &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; and related species of mushrooms typically found in the temperate and boreal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a prodrug of muscimol, broken down by the liver to that much more stable compound. It is a conformationally-restricted analogue of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and due to its structural similarity to this neurotransmitter, acts as a non-selective glutamate receptor agonist. Because of this, ibotenic acid can be a powerful neurotoxin in high doses, and is employed as a &quot;brain-lesioning agent&quot; through cranial injections in scientific research. The neurotoxic effects appear to be dose-related and risks are unclear through consumption of ibotenic-acid containing fungi, although thought to be negligible in small doses.

==Pharmacology==
Ibotenic acid acts as a potent agonist of the NMDA and group I (mGluR1 and mGluR5) and II (mGluR2 and mGluR3) metabotropic glutamate receptors. It is inactive at group III mGluRs. Ibotenic acid also acts as a weak agonist of the AMPA and kainate receptors. In addition, due to &quot;in vivo&quot; decarboxylation into muscimol, it acts indirectly as a potent GABAA and GABAA-ρ receptor agonist. Unlike muscimol—the principal psychoactive constituent of &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; that is understood to cause sedation and delirium—ibotenic acid&#x27;s psychoactive effects are not known independent of its serving as a prodrug to muscimol, although some researchers have speculated that it would act as a stimulant. 
==Biological properties==

===Mechanism of action===

Ibotenic acid is an agonist of glutamate receptors, specifically at both the N-methyl-D-aspartate, or NMDA, and trans-ACPD receptor sites in multiple systems in the central nervous system. Ibotenic neurotoxicity can be enhanced by glycine and blocked by dizocilpine. Dizocilpine acts as an uncompetitive antagonist at NMDA receptors.

Ibotenic acid toxicity comes from activation of the NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors are related to synaptic plasticity and work with metabotropic glutamate receptors to establish long term potentiation or LTP. The process of long term potentiation is believed to be related to the acquisition of information. The NMDA receptor functions properly by allowing Ca2+ ions to pass through after activation at the receptor site. 

The binding of ibotenic acid allows excess Ca2+ into the system which results in neuronal cell death. Ca2+ also activates CaM-KII or Ca2+/Calmodulin Kinase which phosphorylates multiple enzymes. The activated enzymes then begin producing reactive oxygen species which damages surrounding tissue. The excess Ca2+ results in the enhancement of the mitochondrial electron transport system which will further increase the number of reactive oxygen species.

===Biological effects===

Ibotenic acid typically affects both NMDA and APCD or metabolotropic quisqualate receptor sites in the central nervous system. Due to their targeting of these systems the symptoms associated with Ibotenic acid poisoning are often related to perception and control.

At least some ingested ibotenic acid is likely decarboxylated into muscimol so some of the effects of ingesting ibotenic acid are similar to muscimol&#x27;s effects. Symptoms associated with ibotenic acid are usually onset within 30–60 minutes and include a range of nervous system effects. The most common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness. However, after the first hour symptoms begin to include confusion, euphoria, visual and auditory distortions, sensations of floating, and retrograde amnesia.

Symptoms are slightly different for children, typically beginning after 30–180 minutes. Dominant symptoms in children include ataxia, obtundation, and lethargy. Seizures are occasionally reported, however, more commonly with children.

===Treatment===

Treatment of ibotenic acid toxicity centres around supportive care and treatment of symptoms; no antidote is available. Gastric decontamination with activated charcoal or gastric lavage can be of benefit if the patient presents early. The psychotropic effects and hallucinations ibotenic acid and its metabolite muscimol produce are best managed in a quiet environment with minimal stimulation. Benzodiazepines can be of benefit in agitated or panicked patients; they can also be used to control seizures if they occur. Benzodiazepines as a GABA-A PAM interacts with Muscimol as a GABA-A agonist and may cause a significantly increased risk of depressant effects. Airway management may be required if sedation is profound. Symptoms usually resolve within a few hours of ingestion but can last for days following significant exposures.

Monitoring for the presence of brain lesions may be required following a large or repeated exposure. Other measures may be required if the patient has been exposed to a mushroom such as &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; as other active compounds may be present.

==Use in research==

Ibotenic acid used for the lesioning of rat&#x27;s brains is kept frozen in a phosphate-buffered Saline Solution at a pH of 7.4, and can be kept for up to a year with no loss in toxicity. Injection of .05-.1 microliters of Ibotenic acid into the hippocampus at a rate of .1 microliter/min resulted in semi-selective lesioning. Hippocampal lesioning led to a considerable loss of cells in pyramidal cells (CA1-CA3) as well as granule cells in the dentate gyrus. Ibotenic acid lesioning also causes some damage to axons along the perforant pathway.

Typically, when lesioning is done with other chemicals the subject cannot relearn a task. However, due to Ibotenic acid&#x27;s reactivity with glutamate receptors such as the NMDA receptor, Ibotenic acid lesioning does allow the subject to relearn tasks. Ibotenic acid lesioning is thus preferred in studies where re-learning a task after lesioning is essential. Compared to other lesioning agents, Ibotenic acid is one of the most site-specific; however, less-damaging alternatives are presently sought.

== Biosynthesis ==
Ibotenic acid&#x27;s biosynthetic genes are organized in a physically linked biosynthetic gene cluster. The biosynthetic pathway is initiated by hydroxylation of glutamic acid by a dedicated Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase. The reaction yields &quot;threo&quot;-3-hydroxyglutamic acid, which is converted into ibotenic acid, likely by enzymes encoded in the biosynthetic gene cluster.

<text>Messier 9 or M9 (also designated NGC 6333) is a globular cluster in the constellation of Ophiuchus. It is positioned in the southern part of the constellation to the southwest of Eta Ophiuchi, and lies atop a dark cloud of dust designated Barnard 64. The cluster was discovered by French astronomer Charles Messier on June 3, 1764, who described it as a &quot;nebula without stars&quot;. In 1783, English astronomer William Herschel was able to use his reflector to resolve individual stars within the cluster. He estimated the cluster to be 7–8′ in diameter with stars densely packed near the center.

M9 has an apparent magnitude of 7.9, an angular size of 9.3′, and can be viewed with a small telescope. It is one of the nearer globular clusters to the center of the galaxy as is around 5,500 light-years from the Galactic Center. Its distance from Earth is 25,800 light-years.

The total luminosity of this cluster is around 120,000 times that of the Sun, the absolute magnitude being -8.04. The brightest individual stars in M9 are of apparent magnitude 13.5, making them visible in moderately sized telescopes. There have been 24 variable stars found in M9: 21 RR Lyrae variables, plus a long-period variable, Type II Cepheid, and an eclipsing binary. No blue stragglers or SX Phoenicis variables have been discovered. Based upon the periods of the RR Lyr variables, this cluster is classified as an Oosterhoff type II globular, which precludes an extra-galactic origin.

At about 80&#x27; ( degrees) to the northeast of M9 is the dimmer globular cluster NGC 6356, while about the same to the southeast is the globular NGC 6342.

<text>In mathematics, a sub-Riemannian manifold is a certain type of generalization of a Riemannian manifold. Roughly speaking, to measure distances in a sub-Riemannian manifold, you are allowed to go only along curves tangent to so-called &quot;horizontal subspaces&quot;.
Sub-Riemannian manifolds (and so, &quot;a fortiori&quot;, Riemannian manifolds) carry a natural intrinsic metric called the metric of Carnot–Carathéodory. The Hausdorff dimension of such metric spaces is always an integer and larger than its topological dimension (unless it is actually a Riemannian manifold).

Sub-Riemannian manifolds often occur in the study of constrained systems in classical mechanics, such as the motion of vehicles on a surface, the motion of robot arms, and the orbital dynamics of satellites. Geometric quantities such as the Berry phase may be understood in the language of sub-Riemannian geometry. The Heisenberg group, important to quantum mechanics, carries a natural sub-Riemannian structure.

==Definitions==

By a &quot;distribution&quot; on formula_1 we mean a subbundle of the tangent bundle of formula_1 (see also distribution).

Given a distribution formula_3 a vector field in formula_4 is called &quot;horizontal&quot;. A curve formula_5 on formula_1 is called horizontal if formula_7 for any 
formula_8.

A distribution on formula_4 is called &quot;completely non-integrable&quot; or &quot;bracket generating&quot; if for any formula_10 we have that any tangent vector can be presented as a linear combination of Lie brackets of horizontal fields, i.e. vectors of the form formula_11 where all vector fields formula_12 are horizontal. This requirement is also known as Hörmander&#x27;s condition.

A sub-Riemannian manifold is a triple formula_13, where formula_1 is a differentiable manifold, formula_15 is a completely non-integrable &quot;horizontal&quot; distribution and formula_16 is a smooth section of positive-definite quadratic forms on formula_15.

Any (connected) sub-Riemannian manifold carries a natural intrinsic metric, called the metric of Carnot–Carathéodory, defined as 
:formula_18
where infimum is taken along all &quot;horizontal curves&quot; formula_19 such that formula_20, formula_21.
Horizontal curves can be taken either Lipschitz continuous, Absolutely continuous or in the Sobolev space formula_22 producing the same metric in all cases.
The fact that the distance of two points is always finite (i.e. any two points are connected by an horizontal curve) is a consequence of Hörmander&#x27;s condition known as Chow–Rashevskii theorem.

==Examples==

A position of a car on the plane is determined by three parameters: two coordinates formula_23 and formula_24 for the location and an angle formula_25 which describes the orientation of the car. Therefore, the position of the car can be described by a point in a manifold 
:formula_26

One can ask, what is the minimal distance one should drive to get from one position to another? This defines a Carnot–Carathéodory metric on the manifold 
:formula_26

A closely related example of a sub-Riemannian metric can be constructed on a Heisenberg group: Take two elements formula_25 and formula_29 in the corresponding Lie algebra such that 
:formula_30

spans the entire algebra. The distribution formula_15 spanned by left shifts of formula_25 and formula_29 is &quot;completely non-integrable&quot;. Then choosing any smooth positive quadratic form on formula_15 gives a sub-Riemannian metric on the group.

==Properties==

For every sub-Riemannian manifold, there exists a Hamiltonian, called the sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian, constructed out of the metric for the manifold. Conversely, every such quadratic Hamiltonian induces a sub-Riemannian manifold.

Solutions of the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi equations for the sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian are called geodesics, and generalize Riemannian geodesics.

<text>Walter Hood Fitch (28 February 1817 – 14 January 1892) was a botanical illustrator, born in Glasgow, Scotland, who executed some 10,000 drawings for various publications. His work in colour lithograph, including 2700 illustrations for &quot;Curtis&#x27;s Botanical Magazine&quot;, produced up to 200 plates per year.

==Biography==

Fitch was involved in fabric printing from the age of 17 and took to botanical art after meeting William Jackson Hooker, Regius Professor of Botany, a competent botanical illustrator, and the editor of &quot;Curtis&#x27;s Botanical Magazine&quot;. Fitch&#x27;s first lithograph of &quot;Mimulus roseus&quot; appeared in the Botanical Magazine in 1834, and he soon became its sole artist. In 1841 W.J. Hooker became director of Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Fitch moved to London. After 1841 Fitch was the sole artist for all official and unofficial publications issued by Kew; his work was paid for by Hooker personally. It was not unusual for him to work on several different publications simultaneously; he could draw directly onto the lithographic stone to save time. These chromolithographs were based on botanical illustrations provided by Hooker and others, and produced some of his most spectacular results.

Fitch&#x27;s important works include his illustrations for William Hooker&#x27;s &quot;A century of orchidaceous plants&quot; (1849), and for James Bateman&#x27;s &quot;A Monograph of Odontoglossum&quot; (1864–74). He also created around 500 plates for Hooker&#x27;s &quot;Icones Plantarum&quot; (1836–76) and four lithographic plates for the monograph &quot;Victoria Regia&quot;. The latter work received critical acclaim in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, &quot;they are accurate, and they are beautiful&quot;.

Other works were for George Bentham&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of the British Flora&quot; (1858, later editions edited by Joseph Dalton Hooker). When J. D, Hooker returned from his travels in India, Fitch prepared lithographs from Hooker&#x27;s sketches for his &quot;Rhododendrons of Sikkim Himalaya&quot; (1849–51) and, from the drawings of Indian artists, for his &quot;Illustrations of Himalayan Plants&quot; (1855). He also produced the illustrations presented in the younger Hooker&#x27;s &quot;The Botany of the Antarctic Voyage&quot;, consisting of six volumes covering the flora of the Antarctic, New Zealand, Tasmania, and outlying islands collected on the Ross expedition of 1839 to 1843.

A dispute over pay with J. D. Hooker ended Fitch&#x27;s service to both the &quot;Botanical Magazine&quot; and Kew in 1877. He was much sought after and remained active as a botanical artist until 1888. Works during this period included Henry John Elwes&#x27;s &quot;Monograph of the Genus Lilium&quot; (1877–80). His renown as a botanical illustrator was such that his obituary in &quot;Nature&quot; stated &quot;... his reputation was so high and so world-wide that it is unnecessary to say much on this point.&quot;

The standard author abbreviation Fitch is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name. Fitch was made a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1857. He died 14 January 1892 and is buried in Richmond Old Cemetery together with his wife Hannah (died 13  March 1929).

The genus &quot;Fitchia&quot; is named for him.

His nephew, John Nugent Fitch (1840 – 1927), also produced illustrations for &quot;Curtis&#x27;s Botanical Magazine&quot;.

<text>Messier 10 or M10 (also designated NGC 6254) is a globular cluster of stars in the equatorial constellation of Ophiuchus. The object was discovered by the French astronomer Charles Messier on May 29, 1764, who cataloged it as number 10 in his catalogue and described it as a &quot;nebula without stars&quot;. In 1774, German astronomer Johann Elert Bode likewise called it a &quot;nebulous patch without stars; very pale&quot;. Using larger instrumentation, German-born astronomer William Herschel was able to resolve the cluster into its individual members. He described it as a &quot;beautiful cluster of extremely compressed stars&quot;. William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse thought he could distinguish a dark lane through part of the cluster. The first to estimate the distance to the cluster was Harlow Shapley, although his derivation of 33,000 light years was much further than the modern value.

The tidal radius of M10 is 19.3 arcminutes, which is about two-thirds of the apparent diameter of the Moon. Viewed through medium-sized telescopes it appears about half that size (8–9 arcminutes), as its bright core is only 35 light-years across. It has a core radius of 48 arcseconds and a half-mass radius of 147 arcseconds (2.5 arcminutes). M10 has a spatial diameter of 83 light-years and is estimated to be 14,300 light-years away from Earth. It figures a degree west of 30 Ophiuchi, a center-of-constellation orange star.

In terms of the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the metallicity, Messier 10 is &quot;moderately metal–poor&quot;. The abundance of iron, measured as [Fe/H] equals , is only 3.5% of the abundance found at the surface of the Sun. The cluster shows evidence of being enriched by the elements generated through the s-process in massive stars and Type II supernovae. It shows little evidence of enrichment by Type Ia supernovae.

Because binary stars are, on average, more massive than normal stars, the binaries tend to migrate toward the center of the cluster. The fraction of binary stars in the core region is about 14%. This proportion decreases with increasing radius to about 1.5% in the outlying regions of the cluster. Correspondingly, the core region contains a concentration of interaction-formed blue straggler stars, most of which formed 2–5 billion years ago. The density of stars in the core region is about 3.8 solar masses per cubic parsec. Four variable stars have been discovered in this cluster.

The cluster is currently located about from the Galactic Center. It completes an orbit around the Milky Way galaxy about every 140 million years, during which it crosses the plane of the galactic disk every 53 million years. Its rosette orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21.

<text>Isabelle Peak is a peak located on the Continental Divide on the border of Banff and Kootenay National Parks in the Canadian Rockies.

== Origin of the Name==
The mountain was named in 1913 by R.D. McCaw, who made a phototopographic survey along the route of the Banff-Windermere road. The survey was made for the British Columbia government. The name &quot;Isabelle&quot; given by McCaw to one of his photographic stations at the request of Mr. W.W. Bell, engineer in charge of construction of the Banff-Windermere Road at the time. Bell had asked McCaw to name a mountain after his wife Isabelle.

==Climbing==
The Interprovincial Boundary Commission made the first ascent of the peak in 1913. A moderate/difficult scramble to the summit can be made on the southern slopes.

==Climate==

Based on the Köppen climate classification, the mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

<doc id="943649" wikidata="Q1234599" url="?curid=943649" title="Liberty Alliance">
<text>The Liberty Alliance Project was an organization formed in September 2001 to establish standards, guidelines and best practices for identity management in computer systems. 
It grew to more than 150 organizations, including technology vendors, consumer-facing companies, educational organizations and governments. 
It released frameworks for federation, identity assurance, an Identity Governance Framework, and Identity Web Services.

By 2009, the Kantara Initiative took over the work of the Liberty Alliance.

==History==
The group was originally conceived and named by Jeff Veis, at Sun Microsystems based in Menlo Park, California. The initiative&#x27;s goal, which was personally promoted by Scott McNealy of Sun, was to unify technology, commercial and government organizations to create a standard for federated, identity-based Internet applications as an alternative to technology appearing in the marketplace controlled by a single entity such as Microsoft&#x27;s Passport.
Another Microsoft initiative, HailStorm, was renamed My Services but quietly shelved by April 2002. Sun positioned the group as independent, and Eric C. Dean of United Airlines became its president.

===Identity federation===

In July 2002, the alliance announced Liberty Identity Federation (ID-FF) 1.0.
At that time, several member companies announced upcoming availability of Liberty-enabled products.
Liberty Federation allowed consumers and users of Internet-based services and e-commerce applications to authenticate and sign-on to a network or domain once from any device and then visit or take part in services from multiple Websites. This federated approach did not require the user to re-authenticate and can support privacy controls established by the user.

The Liberty Alliance subsequently released two more versions of the Identity Federation Framework, and then in November 2003, Liberty contributed its final version of the specification, ID-FF 1.2, to OASIS. This contribution formed the basis for SAML 2.0. By 2007, industry analyst firm Gartner claimed that SAML had gained wide acceptance in the community.

===Identity web services===
Liberty Alliance, releasing the Liberty Identity Web Services Framework (ID-WSF) in April 2004 for deploying and managing identity-based web services. Applications included geolocation, contact book, calendar, mobile messaging and People Service, for managing social applications such as bookmarks, blogs, calendars, photo sharing and instant messaging in a secure and privacy-respecting federated social network. 
In a 2008 marketing report recommended considering it for federation.

===Certification ===
The alliance introduced a certification program in 2003, designed to test commercial and open source products against published standards to assure base levels of interoperability between products. In 2007, the US General Services Administration began requiring this certification for participating in the US E-Authentication Identity Federation.

===Openliberty.org===
In January 2007, the alliance announced a project for open-source software developers building identity-based applications. OpenLiberty.org was a portal where developers can collaborate and access tools and information to develop applications based on alliance standards.
In November 2008, OpenLiberty released an open source application programming interface called ArisID.

===Identity governance framework===
In February 2007 Oracle Corporation contributed the Identity Governance Framework to the alliance, which released the first version publicly in July 2007.
The Identity Governance Framework defined how identity related information is used, stored, and propagated using protocols such as LDAP, Security Assertion Markup Language, WS-Trust, and ID-WSF.

===Identity assurance framework===
The Liberty Alliance began work on its identity assurance framework in 2008. The Identity Assurance Framework (IAF) detailed four identity assurance levels designed to link trusted identity-enabled enterprise, social networking and Web applications together based on business rules and security risks associated with each level. The four levels of assurance were outlined by a 2006 document from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology.
The level of assurance provided is measured by the strength and rigor of the identity proofing process, the credential&#x27;s strength, and the management processes the service provider applies to it. 
These four assurance levels were adopted by UK, Canada, and USA government services.

===Concordia project===
In 2007 the Liberty Alliance helped to found the Project Concordia, an independent initiative for harmonization identity specifications. It was active through 2008.

===Privacy and policy===
The alliance wrote papers on business and policy aspects of identity management. It hosted meetings in 2007 and 2008 to promote itself.

===Membership===
Management board members included AOL, British Telecom, Computer Associates (CA), Fidelity Investments, Intel, Internet Society (ISOC), Novell, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), Vodafone, Oracle Corporation and Sun Microsystems.

<doc id="943652" wikidata="Q9220" url="?curid=943652" title="United States Grand Prix West">
<text>The United States Grand Prix West was a race held at Long Beach, California, as a Formula 5000 race in 1975 and a Formula One World Championship event from 1976 to 1983 held in the same location throughout those years. 

The name of the Grand Prix came from the fact that the race was held in the Western United States and also because the United States Grand Prix title was already on the calendar as a race at Watkins Glen for most of the event&#x27;s history. 

==History==

There had been an attempt to bring about a second American Formula One Grand Prix, specifically to Southern California in 1972, with the United States Grand Prix West at the ultra modern Ontario Motor Speedway after the success of the Questor Grand Prix in 1971, but this was unsuccessful.

With the east coast Watkins Glen track on the downslope after two fatalities in successive years and a politically charged 1975 event, the USGP West was created for the 1976 season on a tight circuit made up of city streets in Long Beach, California, located in the Los Angeles metropolitan area on the west coast. A Formula 5000 race was held there in 1975, and the US was just the second country (after Italy in 1957) to host two Championship F1 events in the same season. Southern California had seen a championship Formula One race before; the 1960 United States Grand Prix was held at the famed Riverside Raceway, which was just an hour&#x27;s drive from Long Beach. Like most street circuits used in Formula One and other disciplines of motor racing, Long Beach gained a reputation for being a grueling race that was very punishing on the car and driver; typical for a city street circuit the race was an intense test of brakes, suspensions, and transmissions. The circuit was an immediate success from its first race in 1976, and it became the U.S.&#x27;s answer to the Monaco Grand Prix—it was just as popular an event as the most important of Formula One Grand Prix races—and the typically sunny and excellent Southern California weather made for a very pleasant setting. The 1976 event was won by Swiss Clay Regazzoni in a Ferrari with his teammate Niki Lauda finishing 2nd and Patrick Depailler finishing 3rd while furiously charging through the field after an incident he had early in the race.

1977 saw a race-long battle between Lauda, South African Jody Scheckter in a Wolf and American Mario Andretti in a Lotus. After being stuck behind Scheckter for most of the race, Andretti outbraked the South African into Queen&#x27;s Hairpin and took a popular victory; Lauda also passed Scheckter and took 2nd; and the Wolf driver completed the podium with 3rd place.

In 1978 the start/finish line was moved to the long sweeping Shoreline Drive at the bottom of the circuit, rather than starting where the pits were on Ocean Boulevard. So the race distance was 79.5 laps, and the parade lap went from the pits to the start on Shoreline Drive rather than completing a whole lap. That race was won by Argentine Carlos Reutemann, and Australian Alan Jones finished a great 2nd place for the new Williams team, their first ever podium position.

1979 saw Queen&#x27;s Hairpin narrowed in order to create a more consistent track width for the start, and it got off to a confused start in which Reutemann was prevented from joining the start after trouble with his Lotus during the warm-up. The field was not stopped under orders, so Canadian pole-sitter Gilles Villeneuve continued and the field followed him back to the pits. Frenchman Jacques Laffite&#x27;s engine seized and he hopped into the spare car. Reutemann went out anyway half a lap behind the others; he retired with gearbox problems. The race saw a spirited drive from Frenchman Jean-Pierre Jarier in the Tyrrell. He climbed up to 2nd behind Villeneuve in a Ferrari, although he had to drop back to finish 6th. Villeneuve won from his teammate Scheckter.

In 1980 there was a number of incidents, including a messy pile-up at the Le Gasomet hairpin. Alfa Romeo driver Bruno Giacomelli spun entering that corner and came to a dead stop, with his Alfa&#x27;s nose mere feet away from the apex of the corner. In a rather impatient attempt to get out of this precarious situation he had put himself in, Giacomelli had put his Alfa in reverse, and as a result, a number of oncoming cars, all attempting to avoid Giacomelli, who had reversed onto the racing line, had to come to a dead stop in order to avoid hitting Giacomelli. This created an accordion-effect accident, which led to 4 other cars also crashing, including Jarier, who had crashed a lot heavier than any of the other drivers by hitting Italian Elio de Angelis&#x27;s Lotus with some force. But the worst accident was yet to come- Clay Regazzoni in an Ensign crashed appallingly when his brakes failed at 180 mph at the end of Shoreline Drive. While going off the course, the Swiss driver hit Ricardo Zunino&#x27;s crashed and stationary Brabham at full speed. He then hit the wall next to the track and went straight-on past Queen&#x27;s Hairpin and crashed into retaining tire barriers head-on, still moving extremely quickly. This devastating accident did not seem to be survivable. Regazzoni did survive, but with severe spinal injuries, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down; he never raced in F1 again but did race again in other forms of motorsports, albeit with hand controls rather than pedals. Brazilian Nelson Piquet dominated that race weekend, it was the first of his twenty-three F1 victories, with his countryman Emerson Fittipaldi taking 3rd.

1981 brought a slight change to the course, with one of the left handers at Pine Avenue being re-made from two corners to one corner. This race saw Italian Riccardo Patrese take pole position from the dominant Williams duo of Alan Jones and Reutemann; Patrese eventually dropped back with mechanical problems and Reutemann made a mistake at one of the turns on Pine Avenue so Jones slipped by to take the lead, which he held until the checkered flag.

For 1982, there were more changes to the circuit, which removed Queen&#x27;s Hairpin and most of Pine Avenue. A whole new section of road was used for the race; the Clos esses were changed and there was a chicane placed on Shoreline Drive. Thus, the race distance was shortened from 79.5 to 75.5 laps. This race saw Ferrari take a neutral stance on the FISA–FOCA war by mounting 2 differently sized wings on the back of their cars. As a symbol of where the conflict would go, these 2 wings exploited a loophole in the regulations; there was no rule saying how many wings could be on an F1 car at a championship event at that time. Niki Lauda won this race, his 3rd race since his temporary retirement and his first victory since 1978, from Finn Keke Rosberg in a Williams, and the Finn battled fiercely with Villeneuve in his more powerful turbo-charged Ferrari; Villeneuve finished 3rd but was disqualified because of the two wings mounted on the back of his car. The race itself was beset by a few organizational problems (even though the US GP West was known to be one of the best organized races of the year), including a crash truck dangerously putting itself on the racing line at the end of a blind corner and then driving in front of Lauda&#x27;s McLaren while it was carrying Nelson Piquet&#x27;s damaged Brabham, and track breakup over the newer parts of the course. American Mario Andretti made a one-off appearance for the Williams team; he crashed on the 20th lap.

The final event in 1983 brought more track modifications and the organizational issues eliminated. The elevated Ocean Boulevard and the steep runs up to and down from it were no longer used; and Seaside Way, a road (level with the rest of the circuit) that runs parallel to Ocean Boulevard was used instead. The revised circuit also included a number of tight turns built around the Convention Center and a slightly shortened Le Gasomet hairpin so that Ocean Boulevard could still be used by everyday traffic. The pits were moved down to Shoreline Drive. John Watson won from 22nd place on the grid, the farthest back from which a modern Grand Prix driver had ever come to win a race, taking advantage of the front runners retiring and an incident between Rosberg and Frenchman Patrick Tambay. Watson&#x27;s teammate Lauda finished 2nd after starting from 23rd on the grid.

After the 1983 event, the event was deemed too expensive to run. Rumors persisted during the whole 1983 weekend that race organizer Chris Pook, the main figure in the attempt to create a &quot;Monte Carlo of the United States&quot; in Long Beach, had decided that Formula One was too expensive and risky. Shipping the F1 equipment all the way over from Europe and Brazil and increased FOCA fees had made the race financially unfeasible, particularly in a country where the financial culture meant that short-term returns on business investments were paramount, and Long Beach had never been paired with any other nearby race in Mexico or elsewhere in the United States, so the costs could not be cut. Pook had been approached by CART and announced after the 1983 F1 race that he planned to run an IndyCar race at Long Beach in 1984 instead of F1. Despite tremendous success since the race&#x27;s inception in 1976, and the observable impact of the global exposure it brought to the city and to the Los Angeles area in general, the organizers believed that the less expensive and domestically more popular CART championship, having mostly American drivers such as Mario Andretti, Rick Mears, and Al Unser, would be a more promising investment. The IndyCar race proved to be a mainstay and is still being run. It is one of the most popular and well-attended races on that calendar.

Part of the interior of the circuit is the 13,600 seat Long Beach Convention Center which also doubled as the pit paddock for the Formula One teams when in Long Beach.

===Continued absence===
In 2013, there was some media speculation that Formula One could replace IndyCar at Long Beach in 2016, as IndyCar&#x27;s contract with the City of Long Beach was to expire in 2015 and Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone had expressed interest in having his series return to the highly populated Los Angeles metropolitan area. However, on April 1, 2014, the Long Beach City Council informed the race&#x27;s organizer that the IndyCar Series had been granted a three-year extension, through the 2018 season.

<text>The Wild Duck Cluster (also known as Messier 11, or NGC 6705) is an open cluster of stars in the constellation Scutum (the Shield). It was discovered by Gottfried Kirch in 1681. Charles Messier included it in his catalogue of diffuse objects in 1764. Its popular name derives from the brighter stars forming a triangle which could resemble a flying flock of ducks (or, from other angles, one swimming duck). The cluster is located just to the east of the Scutum Star Cloud midpoint.

The Wild Duck Cluster is one of the richest and most compact of the known open clusters. It is one of the most massive open clusters known, and it has been extensively studied. Its age has been estimated to about 316 million years. The core radius is while the tidal radius is . Estimates for the cluster&#x27;s mass range from to , depending on the method chosen. The brightest cluster member is visual magnitude 8, and it has 870 members of at least magnitude 16.5. It has an integrated absolute magnitude of –6.5, and a visual extinction of 1.3.

The cluster is metal-rich with an iron abundance of [Fe/H] = . Despite its youth, it shows an enhancement of alpha process elements. Possibly this is due to an enhancement of its birth molecular cloud by a nearby Type II supernova explosion. At least nine variable star members have been identified with high probability, plus 29 lower probability members. The former include two eclipsing binary star systems. The cluster is located from the Galactic Center, close to the galactic plane, and is not far from its birthplace.

<text>Messier 12 or M 12 (also designated NGC 6218) is a globular cluster in the constellation of Ophiuchus. It was discovered by the French astronomer Charles Messier on May 30, 1764, who described it as a &quot;nebula without stars&quot;. In dark conditions this cluster can be faintly seen with a pair of binoculars. Resolving the stellar components requires a telescope with an aperture of or greater. In a scope, the granular core shows a diameter of 3 (arcminutes) surrounded by a 10 halo of stars.

M12 is roughly 3° northwest from the cluster M10 and 5.6° east southeast from star Lambda Ophiuchi. It is also located near the 6th magnitude 12 Ophiuchi. The cluster is about from Earth and has a spatial diameter of about 75 light-years. The brightest stars of M12 are of 12th magnitude. M10 and M12 are only a few thousand light-years away from each other and each cluster would appear at about magnitude 4.5 from the other. With a Shapley-Sawyer rating of IX, it is rather loosely packed for a globular and was once thought to be a tightly concentrated open cluster. Thirteen variable stars have been recorded in this cluster. M12 is approaching us at a velocity of 16 km/s.

A study published in 2006 concluded that this cluster has an unusually low number of low-mass stars. The authors surmise that they were stripped from the cluster by passage through the relatively matter-rich plane of the Milky Way.

<doc id="943683" wikidata="Q2850415" url="?curid=943683" title="Ann Putnam">
<text>Ann Putnam (October 18, 1679 – 1716) was a primary accuser, at age 12, at the Salem Witch Trials of Massachusetts during the later portion of 17th-century Colonial America. Born 1679 in Salem Village, Essex County, Massachusetts Bay Colony, she was the eldest child of Thomas (1652–1699) and Ann (Née Carr) Putnam (1661–1699).

She was friends with some of the girls who claimed to be afflicted by witchcraft and, in March 1692, proclaimed to be afflicted herself, along with Elizabeth Hubbard, Mary Walcott, Mercy Lewis, Abigail Williams, and Mary Warren. Putnam is responsible for the accusations of 62 people, which, along with the accusations of others, resulted in the executions of twenty people, as well as the deaths of several others in prison.

She was a first cousin once removed of Generals Israel and Rufus Putnam.

==Early life==
Annie was born on October 18, 1679, to Thomas Putnam (of the Putnam family) and Ann (née Carr) Putnam, who had twelve children in total. Ann was the eldest. Fellow accuser Mercy Lewis was a servant in the Putnam household, and Mary Walcott was, perhaps, Annie&#x27;s best friend. These three girls would become the first afflicted girls outside of the Parris household.

The Putnam family lived on the southwest side of Hathorne Hill, approximately in the area of what is today Danielle Drive in Danvers, Massachusetts. (For many years, a house that stands back from Putnam Lane was misidentified as the Putnam House, but this house was likely built circa 1891. Images of this house are still routinely misidentified as Annie&#x27;s home). Shortly after the trials were over, the family built a new house in the general area of what is today Dayton and Maple Streets in Danvers where Annie spent the rest of her life.

==Salem witch trials==

Annie, age 12, was one of the &quot;afflicted girls&quot;, the primary accusers during the trials.

==Aftermath==
According to historian of the Salem Witch Trials Charles W. Upham, and implied by her own will, Annie was chronically ill in the years after the trials, and that led to her death at a young age.

When both her parents died in 1699, Putnam was left to raise her nine surviving siblings. She never married.

In consultation with the Reverend Joseph Green, Samuel Parris&#x27;s successor as minister of Salem&#x27;s church, Putnam composed a public confession for the part she had played in the witch trials. Rebecca Nurse&#x27;s son Samuel Nurse was conferred with, &quot;as the representative of those who had suffered from her testimony&quot;, and he deemed the confession &quot;to be satisfactory to him.&quot; Putnam wished to offer her confession and profess her religion at the same time. The date of the confession was made public, and on 25 August, 1706, at the Salem meeting-house, a large congregation from Salem and other places assembled. Green read Putnam&#x27;s confession while the congregation sat and Putnam stood in her place: 

After the reading, Putnam declared it was her confession, acknowledged her signature, and received Communion. Of her confession, Upham stated that &quot;she was undoubtedly sincere in her penitence, and was forgiven, we trust and believe; but she failed to see the depths of her iniquity, and of those who instigated and aided her, in her false accusations. The blame and the deed were wholly hers and theirs. Satan had no share in it.&quot;

==Death==
She died in 1716 and is buried with her parents in an unmarked grave in Danvers, Massachusetts. Her will entered probate on June 29, 1716, so she presumably died shortly before then. In it, she refers to eight surviving siblings. Her four brothers inherited the land she had inherited from her parents, and her personal estate was divided between her four sisters.

==In popular culture==

In Arthur Miller&#x27;s play &quot;The Crucible&quot;, her character&#x27;s name is Ruth, to avoid confusion with her mother, Ann Putnam (Sr.)

&quot;Conversion&quot; by Katherine Howe describes the mass hysteria of the fictional St. Joan&#x27;s Academy in Danvers, Massachusetts, interlaced with intercalary chapters from Annie&#x27;s perspective as she tells the town&#x27;s new reverend how the witch hunt began and escalated based on her testimony and the testimonies of the other girls. The novel explores the occurrence of modern-day hysteria through juxtaposition against the Salem Witch Trials.

In &quot;Burned: A Daughters of Salem Novel&quot;, a 2023 young adult novel by Kellie O&#x27;Neill, a minor character named &quot;Blaire Putnam&quot; is a descendant of Ann Putnam&#x27;s father, Thomas Putnam.

<doc id="943685" wikidata="Q5421696" url="?curid=943685" title="Expression-oriented programming language">
<text>An expression-oriented programming language is a programming language in which every (or nearly every) construction is an expression and thus yields a value. The typical exceptions are macro definitions, preprocessor commands, and declarations, which expression-oriented languages often treat as statements.

Lisp and ALGOL 68 are expression-oriented languages. Pascal is not an expression-oriented language.

All functional programming languages are expression-oriented.

==Criticism and prevention==
Critics, including language designers, blame expression-orientation for an entire class of programming mistakes wherein a programmer accidentally codes an assignment &quot;expression&quot;, which replaces a variable with an expression rather than testing it for equality with that expression.

The designers of Ada and Java prevent this type of mistake by restricting control expressions to those that evaluate strictly to the boolean data type.

The designers of Python implemented assignment as a statement rather than an expression, thus prohibiting assignment from nesting inside any other statement or expression. (Until version 3.8 added &#x27;assignment expressions&#x27;, with a different syntax.)

In some expression-oriented languages, expressions that merely cause side effects return void types.

==Examples==
*ALGOL 68
*BLISS
*Icon
*Lisp
*ML
*Perl
*Rebol
*Ruby
*Elixir
*Erlang
*Haskell
*Rust
*Scala
*Smalltalk

<doc id="943691" wikidata="Q6743400" url="?curid=943691" title="Malibu Grand Prix">
<text>Malibu Grand Prix (MGP) was an entertainment company that was popular during the 1970s and 1980s as a franchised miniature Indy car racing track. The typical complex included a 3000-4000 sq ft. arcade with a concession stand and a race track outside, covering around 10,000 to altogether. It was acquired by Warner Communications in 1976 which in turn sold it in late 1983 to a group of Canadian developers and a local entrepreneur whose background included Chuck E. Cheese’s. There were a total of 40 locations at the time of acquisition including 32 tracks and 8 family entertainment centers featuring miniature golf, batting cages, bumper boats and more. As part of the acquisition, Malibu acquired seven parks from Castle Entertainment which was in bankruptcy. These locations were located in North Hollywood, Sherman Oaks, and Redondo Beach, California; El Paso, Texas; Honolulu, Hawaii; and Ft. Lauderdale and Miami, Florida. A location in Tulsa, Oklahoma was acquired in late 1984 that included a small waterpark and a Malibu-like racing facility. The California partner sold out in 1986, and the Canadians sold the chain to Mountasia in 1995.

==Sites==
=== Norcross, Georgia ===
5400 Brook Hollow Pkwy, Norcross, GA 30071

===Albuquerque, New Mexico===
Located just south of I-25 and Jefferson, along the west side of the Pan American Freeway.

===North Hollywood, California===
One of the Castle Entertainment locations that was on the corner of Vanowen and Whitsett. This location had arcades, mini golf, batting cages, go kart racing. Prior to the go karts this was also home to massive water slides, and before that an outdoor trampoline park. This location was shut down after a massive fire in 1998 and now the site is occupied by senior living apartments.

===Sherman Oaks, California===
Sepulveda Blvd just north of the 101 freeway. Was acquired by Malibu Grand Prix in 1984 with its merger with Castle Entertainment that was in bankruptcy. The property was leased from the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks District, which assumed operations around 1987. Malibu had changed the name from Castle Park to Malibu Castle; the City returned the name to the original.

===Louisville, Kentucky===
Near the intersection of Interstate 264 and Poplar Level Road.

===Pasadena, California===
The Pasadena, California, site was located on the southwest corner of Foothill Blvd and Madre, just north of the 210 Freeway. While impossible to verify, locals who frequented this location recall top lap times in the 50.0 to 51.5 range.

===Tempe, Arizona===
The Tempe, Arizona, site on Hayden Road, south of McKellips Road closed in the mid-1990s. The land is now occupied by a FedEx distribution facility. This site was acquired by MGP from a private operator, Grand Prix of Phoenix in 1979. Therefore, it was the fastest Malibu track in the country with only 13 turns in a 1/2 mile. Track record was in the 47-second bracket. It was a favorite stop by many touring artists including Pink Floyd, Dire Straits, Aerosmith, Scorpions, Foreigner, and many more. Also professional drivers like Michael Andretti, Dan Gurney, Al Unser Jr.

===Tucson, Arizona===
The Tucson venue was located on 22nd Street, just east of Alvernon Way. It closed during the mid-1990s, replaced by a number of fast-food restaurants.

===Fountain Valley, California===
Near Warner and Magnolia the site was adjacent to a Boomer&#x27;s featuring miniature golf, batting cages and other entertainment. The site was closed in the 90&#x27;s, and Boomer&#x27;s was shut down in 2019.

===City of Industry, California===
Originally located on Castleton Street, right next to the Pomona freeway, it featured a large arcade with the latest coin-operated games, 2–3 full-sized pay-per-play pool tables, along with the infamous go cart track. Both -scale Indy-Style race cars and smaller go-carts were raced on the track. MGP also owned/operated the fun center next door simply known as &quot;Showboat&quot;. Showboat had its own arcade section, two 18-hole miniature golf courses, and a water park. Both places no longer exist; in their place is a SpeedZone (originally Malibu SpeedZone) and features the scaled race cars, go karts, and scaled dragsters.

===Tampa, Florida===
One of a few of the remaining facilities, the Malibu Grand Prix location in Tampa, Florida, became independent from the other locations, and the name was changed to Grand Prix Tampa. It includes two 18-hole miniature golf courses surrounded by ponds and obstacles, a game room, a snack bar, a 1/2-mile (800 m) race track with 3/4-scale Indy-style Formula race cars, a go-kart track for younger kids, and a recently added paintball field.

===Orlando, Florida===
Started as a Malibu Track and arcade, later a Castle Golf and Games was added next door. It was located directly off I-4 right behind the &quot;Hi Q&quot; hotel off International Dr on American Way. A Homewood suites hotel now sits on the property.

===Fort Lauderdale, Florida===
Malibu built a Malibu Grand Prix next to I 95 between Stirling Road and Griffin Road in 1979. The location was hard to get to and only lasted a few years. It was sold to Grand Pix Race o Rama which had a location nearby, but was displaced when I 595 was built in 1989. It was sold again and operated as Boomers with a huge wooden roller coaster. Boomers closed in 2017 when the land was bought and the park was leveled. Shopping is being built on the site as of this date. Some will read this and be confused as there was a water park called Atlantis The Water Kingdom at the Stirling road exit, and a Castle Park just north of Malibu, which was knocked down also so that I 595 could be built.

===Houston, Texas===
Houston, Texas, once had three Malibu Grand Prix locations. The Southwest Freeway location was shuttered in the early 1990s. This location was the site of the (locally) infamous Malibu Grand Prix murders. The murders were committed on July 1, 1983, during the course of a robbery. Four employees who had just closed up and were in the process of conducting post-closing housekeeping duties were killed. A recently terminated employee gained entry to the building under the pretext of picking up his last paycheck, and brought two accomplices with him. All were convicted (two received the death penalty, and one was sentenced to life imprisonment). The site was razed in the early 1990s and is now a location of a health clinic serving the Gulfton area.

The other location was off the Katy Freeway and the northwest corner of the West Loop 610 at Old Katy Road (the Old Katy location was the remaining Houston-area Malibu Grand Prix location until it was boarded up in early 2005). After closing, the site sat empty until it was used as storage for a materials company, storing slabs of stone and rock on the golf course. As of December 2012 the property, along with all buildings to either side, has been completely demolished and is now part of the West Loop/US290 managed lanes expansion (the service road runs through the former Malibu Grand Prix compound).

The third location (I-45 North) at Shephard.

===Oklahoma City, Oklahoma===
Malibu Grand Prix in Oklahoma City was originally operated as Family Fun Park which was constructed in 1979 and had several water slides. The site was leased to Malibu Grand Prix in 1985. Malibu Grand Prix featured an arcade with an indoor slot car track, a go-kart track, and mini golf course. Malibu Grand Prix closed around 1993. The site was then reopened in the mid-1990s as America&#x27;s Grand Prix. The America&#x27;s Grand Prix had an arcade and a new NASCAR themed go-kart track, the mini golf course and water slides were removed. America&#x27;s Grand Prix closed in the late 1990s and Frontier State Bank was built on the south half of the Grand Prix site in 2000. It was located on the east side of I-35 north of the SE 51st Street bridge.

===Columbus, Ohio===
Columbus, Ohio had a Malibu Grand Prix located on the north side of the city on Schrock Road, visible from Interstate 71. The Columbus location was primarily the Grand Prix track, and had a relatively small arcade in comparison to other locations. Operations ceased in late 2001, and the building is now a school. Some portions of the track can be seen in the school&#x27;s playground.

===Cincinnati (Sharonville), Ohio===
Cincinnati, Ohio, Malibu Grand Prix was located on Interstate 75 in Sharonville on Dowlin Drive and adjacent to Burbank&#x27;s Real Bar-B-Q. The location was open until the late 1990s, when it was left vacant and eventually demolished to make way for a Hilton Garden Inn. The track record is said to have been 48.600, set in 1991.

===Fresno, California===
Fresno, California was home to one of the first Malibu Grand Prix locations, near the intersection of Blackstone Ave and Herndon Ave. The facility stood from 1977 until 1997, at which time its 20-year lease on the property was up. The location was briefly renamed &quot;Fresno Grand Prix&quot; after being acquired by an independent investor, though the property owner eventually sold the parcel of land, which included one of the last drive-in movie theaters in California. The building and track were demolished to make way for an expansion of the River Park Shopping Center. The land once occupied by the track is now a Costco parking lot.

===Oakland, California===
There was also a Malibu Grand Prix in Oakland immediately south of the Coliseum from the 1970s through the mid-1990s. The facility was closed and demolished and the site is now an overflow parking lot for the Coliseum.

===Redwood City, California===
Opened in 1979, closed August 2013. Located at Highway 101 and Woodside Rd. Featured mini golf, batting cages, bumper boats, the &quot;Castle,&quot; and the Virage/Roadrunner karts. The main site is now an office building complex, but remnants of the golf course and race track remain covered under weeds and grass. It was considered one of the most popular of all MGPs. Saturday nights were known for particularly long lines.

===Pacheco, California===
This one did not last as long as most. Located on Pacheco Blvd in Pacheco just north of Pleasant Hill and Concord, it was built around 1976 or &#x27;77 and lasted until only the mid-1980&#x27;s It was sandwiched between the 680 southbound freeway, the river, and Pacheco Blvd, on a triangle-shaped property, and was very visible from the freeway, especially at night when the Grand Prix lights were on. Besides a large game room building where tickets were also purchased for the actual Grand Prix rides there were no other attractions. Since it didn&#x27;t last as long as the rest, it never fell into a state of disrepair; rather, it just suddenly disappeared and was gone. No business moved in right away but around 10 years later the property finally has tenants and now consists of a public storage business and an equipment rental business.

===Dayton, Ohio===
The Dayton, Ohio location was across from the Dayton Mall on State Route 741 close to Centerville. This Location featured a large arcade and the classic Malibu Style Indy Car Track behind the Arcade. Three levels of cars were used including Mini Virage for the kids, Virage full size cars, and Grand Virage Cars which had 2 seats. There was a painting on the outside windows that said &quot;Mortal Kombat II Now Here!&quot; which stayed there until the building was demolished to make way for a Sun Super Savings Center Appliance and Computer Store which soon went out of business as well. The building is still on site and is now the home of a Michaels craft store and a Golf Galaxy store.

===Mount Laurel, New Jersey===
Southern New Jersey had a Malibu Grand Prix located in Mount Laurel on Fellowship road. The location featured two 1/2-mile virage-style tracks, mid-sized arcade room, birthday party area and concession stand. The south track was typically in constant use during business hours, while the north track would open during busier times. Karts offered at this location included Mini Virage, Virage, Grand Virage (two-seater) and the Club Car, which was available only to those who in the 53.50 club (completed two consecutive laps on the south track in a regular virage car in 53.50 seconds or less. The club car was significantly faster than the other cars along and had better tires, suspension, engine and transmission. The Club Car was clocked in excess of 70 MPH on a 1/4-mile track in Atco, New Jersey. Operations ceased and the building remained unused for years. Upon subsequent demolition for an office park, the body of an unidentified person was located on the formers grounds. As of January 2007, the case remains open.

In 1999, a vehicle was spotted driving on the closed racetrack while smoke poured out from the front windows. Police arrived, but not before the hooligans got away.
On the site now is a Cooper health center.

===Denver, Colorado===
A Malibu Grand Prix with a track and arcade, was located north of Denver, Colorado at Interstate 25 exit 215 (58th Ave). The location is now a Furniture Row store. The last day of operation for the Denver location was after close of business on Monday, September 7, 1998 (Labor Day weekend). The location Area Manager at the time of closing was Robert D. Lujan. Lujan worked for Malibu Grand Prix from June 1984 through the closing date of the location.

===Lenexa, Kansas===
There was a Malibu Grand Prix in Lenexa, KS (Suburban Kansas City) that closed in the mid-1990s. The location was at the intersection of I-35 and 87th street. It consisted of a video game room, snackbar, and 1/2 mile traditional race track that featured Virage, Mini Virage, and Grand Virage (two-seater) race cars.

===Portland, Oregon===
A Malibu Grand Prix with track and arcade was located in Beaverton, Oregon, near the Washington Square Mall opened in the summer of 1979. Later with a new owner, in the 1990s, the location changed its name, becoming Malibu Raceway LLC. The facility included the racetrack, a video arcade and snackbar. A batting cage is also on the property owned and operated by a third party added well after the original launch of the race track and arcade. On April 4, 2013, The current owner, Kevin O&#x27;Connell, announced that Malibu Raceway LLC was ending all operations at the end of the month due to a leasing dispute. The current property was transformed into a used car lot (CarMax) and opened on September 24, 2014, while Malibu Raceway has relocated to the Mt. Hood Skibowl in Government Camp, OR.

===Miami, Florida===
Was the biggest of them all. Had two miniature golf courses, nine batting cage stalls, a castle building with over 120+ games, a go-kart track, kiddie kart track, mini train, bumper boats, formula 1 car track. It opened in 1982 and the land was sold in December 2000. The general manager at that time was Manuel Martinez. It was located at 7775 N.W. 7 ST. Miami, Fl 33126 nearby Mall of the Americas (currently Midway Crossings). Three large apartment buildings are in its place now. This location was previously a Castle Park which went in to bankruptcy in late 1983. Malibu Grand Prix acquired all the Castle Park locations in April 1984 and the locations were renamed to Malibu Castle Park.

===Northridge, California===
A Malibu Grand Prix track and arcade was located in the San Fernando Valley in the county of Los Angeles near the corner of Nordhoff and Corbin, across the street from the then Teledyne Company offices (now Lowes Home Improvement). The six-acre property opened in 1974 and was one of the first three site built in the chain of entertainment centers. It operated as a split function business. The arcade and food services was separate from the Virage and Road Runner garage/track operation. The Location Manager supervised the both functions.

The Shop Supervisor reported to the Location manager. The Shop Supervisor ensured the Virage vehicles were operational, 2 stroke pre-mix and 4 stroke fuel was order and offloaded to the underground tanks, the repair parts inventory was ordered and maintained, the Track and Signaling was safe and operational, and supervised shop personnel. Additionally, the Shop Supervisor supervised the rebuilding/restoration of the Virage cars that reached their targeted limit of operational hours. These cars were torn down and the frames sand blasted, powder coated and the cars reassembled.

The Virage cars had various engine types over the years. The air cooled Kawasaki 440 was used at Northridge from 1980 through 1982. It used an aluminum drive/driven arrangement utilizing a Goodyear belt.

During the 1980 through 1982 seasons, several Virage cars had sponsors. The black Armor All car was a crowd favorite but tended not to be the fastest on the track. For the Northridge location Virage cars, a track time of less than 55 seconds was considered very good.

The track was very popular in the late 1970s and was frequented by several child stars like Scott Baio, Adam Rich, and Kristy McNichol.

Corporate headquarters was located in Warner Center, Woodland Hills California until the company was restructured and sold.

After losing their lease when the site was sold to a Toyota dealership, this location closed in August 1994.

There was a Malibu Grand Prix located in Pasadena, Ca. The location in Pasadena CA was at the SW corner of Foothill Blvd and Sierra Madre Villa. Location is now an office building and parking lot.

There was a Malibu Castle in Redondo Beach at 2410 Marine Ave for 30 years. It closed in October 2005 and the land is now occupied by two hotels.

===Anaheim, California===
A Malibu Grand Prix track and arcade was located in Anaheim just north of Anaheim Stadium, the closest crossroads being East Katella Ave and the 57 Freeway. It had 2 tracks. This was the first Malibu Grand Prix location. It was located behind the original location of the big &quot;A&quot; of Anaheim Stadium (when it housed the scoreboard). A restaurant now occupies the parking area, backed by a large office building.

===San Diego, California===
A Malibu Grand Prix track and arcade was located in San Diego across the street from Naval Air Station Miramar (now MCAS Miramar) off of Miramar Blvd. It opened in the late 1970s and remained popular with locals for many years. Eventually, people in the area moved on to other things, the facility saw a significant decline in business, and soon fell into disrepair. The site was leveled and a multi business strip mall was built.

===Austin, Texas===
The Austin MGP was located on the East side of the 7400 block of IH-35 North, just north of Blackson Ave. and is now a Kia pre-owned car lot. As of this writing (Sept. 2010) you can still see remnants of the track on the Google Maps satellite image, but Google Street View shows the location as its current use.

===San Antonio, Texas===
It was built during the summer of 1978, and opened in October of that year. Located just north of the intersection of Loop 410 and IH-10, the property included the Malibu Grand Prix with arcade and track, and adjacent to it was &quot;The Castle&quot; which was the larger arcade plus a miniature golf course, bumper-boats and batting cages. It was billed as &quot;Malibu Golf and Games&quot; and it was quite a hike between the two even through they were on the same property. The sites greatest claim to fame was when the Canadian rock band &quot;Rush&quot; rented the track for recreation after their concert. Each band member purchased 150 tickets and raced far into the night. The track remained open until around 2002. Evidently sold and resold, the cars were worn out and in disrepair, the lap timer often didn&#x27;t work, and the quality of the time you spent there went down badly. Then there were slot car tracks where the arcade was and a new track was built on the other side of &quot;The Castle&quot; which was an oval/figure 8 type thing with multi-cart racing instead of hot lapping. That brought some life back to the place, but eventually the Malibu portion (building) was razed and the track remains to this today (September 2015). The last day of operation for the San Antonio location was after close of business on Monday, September 7, 2015 (Labor Day weekend), citing economic reasons for not renewing its lease. Located on what must be an extremely valuable tract of land with some of the highest visibility (traffic) in the city, it has done well to make it this far.

===Dallas, Texas===
MGP opened for business in the spring of 1980 at 11150 Malibu Drive in northwest Dallas, Texas, on a tract of land near the intersection of I-35E and Walnut Hill Lane, with a freestanding &quot;Castle&quot; featuring many video games, pinball machines, and four miniature golf courses in addition to the main MGP building, which also offered video games in addition to the race track with its &quot;Virage&quot; cars.

In spring 1998, the site was completely renovated and reopened as the then new SpeedZone, which remained open for nearly 22 years before closing its doors on February 18, 2020.

There was also an MGP location in the Hurst-Euless-Bedford portion of the Fort Worth metropolitan area.

===Hurst, Texas===
Also opened in 1980 on N.E. Loop 820, later bought by Putt Putt and converted. A more powerful than usual tan-colored Virage car called &quot;The Suburban Cowboy&quot;, number 80, was said to be very popular. Lines were often long at this location and there were many regulars.

===Memphis, Tennessee===
There was one in Memphis, Tennessee near I-40 and Sycamore View Road. This track was somewhat unique, featuring a sequence of double &quot;esses&quot; leading to a decreasing radius right-hander that ended with a 45-yard long &quot;straightaway&quot; to the timing/finish line.

===Tulsa, Oklahoma===
The site off West 51st between Union and 33rd West Avenue was built in 1984 and operated as an independent facility with 3 tracks, including the Grand Prix, kid-cart, and &quot;Daytona&quot; kart tracks. In 1985, the owners worked an operating deal with Malibu and the cars were all replaced with MGP Virages, RoadRunners on the kid-cart track, and higher-performance karts on the &quot;Daytona&quot; track. In late 1985, the franchiser had financial difficulties and MGP pulled all its corporate property (cars, games) from the facility, which promptly closed. The site has been largely paved over and has been used for a truck-driving school.

==Millennium Game Products==
Malibu Grand Prix formed a division named Millennium Game Products in the mid 80s to create arcade games of their own. Ultimately the only game they released was the Laserdisc game &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot;, of which the animation for the game by Toei Animation was completed in 1984 and it was officially released in 1987. The company had numerous other Laserdisc games planned, stating that they were negotiating with Lucasfilm and other major studios, though none of these came to fruition and the division was shut down shortly after &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot;&#x27;s release.

==Palace Entertainment buyout==
In 2002, Palace Entertainment purchased the three remaining Malibu Grand Prix locations. These locations are in Redwood City, California, Norcross, Georgia, and San Antonio, Texas. Palace operates additional locations in Los Angeles, California and Dallas, Texas. The Redwood City, CA location closed on August 18, 2013 and the San Antonio location closed on September 7, 2015.

<text>The Tampa Theatre is a historic U.S. theater and city landmark in Downtown Tampa, Florida. Designed as an atmospheric theatre-style movie palace by architect John Eberson, it opened on October 15, 1926. The theatre features a wide range of independent, foreign, and documentary films. It is Tampa&#x27;s only non-profit movie palace, and operating costs are supported by its members, donors, and corporate sponsors, as well as by ticket and concessions sales. It has often been used as a backdrop for movies, music videos, and local programming.

==History==

Tampa Theatre was the first commercial building in Tampa to offer air conditioning. The theatre&#x27;s interior resembles a romantic Mediterranean courtyard replete with old-world statuary, flowers, and gargoyles. On the ceiling is an artificial nighttime sky with stars on it.

By the 1960s and 70s, many American movie palaces were demolished because the land beneath them became more valuable than the theatre operation. 

In 1973, the theatre faced the same fate. But the citizens rallied and committees were formed. City leaders became involved, and soon a deal was reached to have the City rescue the Tampa Theatre by assuming its leases. The Arts Council of Hillsborough County agreed to program and manage the Tampa Theatre with films, concerts, and special events. By the time the Theatre reopened in early 1978, the Tampa Theatre had become something of a national model on how to save an endangered theater.

In 1992, restoration efforts were led by the Tampa Theatre Foundation after the building caught fire in 1991. The theatre presents and hosts over 600 events a year including a full schedule of the first run and classic films, concerts, special events, corporate events, tours, and educational programs.

Since its rescue in 1978, the theatre has welcomed over five million guests including over one million school children for school field trips and summer camps in the context of one of Tampa&#x27;s largest historic preservation projects.

It was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, is a Tampa City Landmark, and is a member of the League of Historic American Theatres.

The theatre has undergone many restoration projects as well as equipment upgrades. The most recent restoration project was the replacement of the marquee which includes the vertical blade sign and the canopy. The completion was marked by the Marquee Lighting Ceremony which took place on January 16, 2004.

The theatre operates The Mighty Wurlitzer Theatre Organ and the instrument is played before nightly films. The organ is played and maintained by a team of volunteer organists from the Central Florida Theatre Organ Society.

In the spring of 2013, during its 86th year of existence, efforts began to convert to digital picture and sound (with the exception of productions that are only available in the movie reel format) and screened a free showing of &quot;Samsara&quot; to celebrate the transition. The switch to digital occurred at a cost of $150,000.

In late 2017, the Theatre closed for six weeks to complete the first phase of its long-term restoration plan, a $6 million renovation that updated the electrical systems, re-seated the auditorium with seats designed to match the original look from 1926, added a new and expanded concessions stand and bar, installed a new emergency power system, and protected the building from storms by installing new storm rated windows and doors on the Florida Avenue side of the building. The seating capacity was reduced from 1,446 to 1,238 to improve comfort and legroom. A new carpet, designed to match the original 1926 design, was installed, as well as a new grand drape and valance for the proscenium arch 
also designed to match the original.

The lobby paint and plaster were restored to their original palette by crews from EverGreene Studios, in New York, including the replication of four tapestries to replace the faded and worn tapestries from 1926. The original tapestries were transferred to the Tampa Bay History Center for preservation.

==In popular culture==
The glam metal band Sleeze Beez filmed the music video for the song &quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot; at the theater.

<text>Air/Space America 88 was an aviation exposition and airshow held at San Diego, California&#x27;s Brown Field in late May of 1988. It was planned to be the western hemisphere&#x27;s answer to the Paris Air Show and would be held every even year when the PAS was in hiatus. It was a mammoth event that attracted exhibitors from all over the world, including an Air France Concorde registered F-BVFF and an Antonov An-124. Many aircraft manufacturers brought their latest creations like Boeing&#x27;s STOL YC-14. The U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds performed along with the usual aerobatic and demonstration flights. Founded by former US Congressman Robert Carlton &quot;Bob&quot; Wilson. Former Vice President of the United States, George HW Bush presided at the ribbon cutting ceremony. Congressman Wilson engaged Mr. Daniel S. Mitrovich to serve as Chief Protocol Officer for the visiting Soviets Air expedition with the worlds largest Aircraft the Antonov An-124 Russian aircraft. Mr. Mitrovich was the first American to fly on the worlds largest aircraft at the invitation of the soviet pilots.

Air/Space America 88 was a tremendous success as an air show but was a financial failure resulting in the cancellation of Air/Space America 90.

<doc id="943711" wikidata="Q3595848" url="?curid=943711" title="Kingdom of Valluvanad">
<text>Valluvanad was an independent chiefdom in present-day central Kerala that held power from the early 12th century to the end of the 18th century. Prior to that, and since the late 10th century, Valluvanad existed as an autonomous chiefdom within the kingdom of the Chera Perumals. The disintegration of the Chera Perumal kingdom in early 12th century led to the independence of the various autonomous chiefdoms of the kingdom, Valluvanad being one of them.

The earliest mention of the term &quot;Valluvanad&quot; as a political entity, from the 9th and early 10th century, are references to a region within the Ay kingdom in the south Kerala, then a vassal to the Pandya kingdom. It is possible that the new chiefdom in central Kerala (within the kingdom of the Chera Perumals) derives its origin from this eponymous subdivision in south Kerala. Valluvanad was ruled by a Samanthan Nair clan known as Vellodis, similar to the Eradis of neighbouring Eranad and Nedungadis of Nedunganad. The rulers of Valluvanad were known by the title &quot;Valluvakonathiri&quot;/&quot;Vellattiri&quot;.

The geographical bounds of Valluvanad are hard to assess from available sources, and did vary significantly in time. It has been generally described as the region between the knolls of Pandalur Hills (a hill that separates old Eranad Taluk from Valluvanad Taluk, located in Malappuram-Manjeri area) and the seashore of Ponnani. The country covered the Bharathapuzha river basin in the south to the Pandalur Hills in the north. On the west, it was bounded by the Arabian Sea at the port Ponnani and on the east by Attappadi Hills. In the 12th century, Valluvanad had parts of present-day Nilambur (Nilambur-Wandoor-Karuvarakundu-Tuvvur area), Eranad (Pandikkad-Manjeri-Malappuram areas), Tirur (Tirunavaya-Athavanad-Kottakkal-Valanchery areas), and Ponnani Taluks within it, with Ponnani port providing the main access to the sea. At that time a larger part of the basins of Chaliyar and Kadalundi River were ruled by &quot;Valluvakonathiri&quot;. In its maximal extend, its northern boundary was Thrikkulam at Tirurangadi in Tirurangadi Taluk and southern border was Edathara near Palakkad. A larger portion of what is presently called Eranad region was originally under the Kingdom of Valluvanad before the conquest of Zamorin of Calicut. In early medieval period, &quot;Valluvakonathiri&quot; conquered a larger portion of &quot;Nedunganad&quot; (Pattambi-Ottapalam-Shoranur-Cherpulassery area), which was under the rule of &quot;Nedungathirippad&quot;. However Nedunganad was annexed by the Zamorin of Calicut in 15th century CE. The Nedumpuram Palace near Thiruvalla belongs to Valluvanad Royal family.

The chiefdom was disestablished in 1793 with the British East India Company taking over its management directly, and the hereditary ruling family settling for a pension arrangement.

== Variations of the name ==

* Valluvanad - Valluvanadu - Valluvanatu - Valluvanat - Walluvanad - Walluvanatu.
* Swaroopam (Svarupam) - Arangottu (Aarangottu)
* Vellattiri - Vellatiri - Velatra - Velnatera

=== Official names ===

* Official name of the kingdom - the Kingdom of Vellattiri
* Official title of the Raja - Vallabha Raja (in the treaty with English)

=== Sanskrit name ===
* Vallabhakshoni

=== Hereditary title ===

* Rajasekhara (or Rayaran/Irayira Chekaran or Irayiravar)
** Rajasekhara and his son Vellan Kumaran (inscription)
**Irayaran Chattan, the utaiyavar of Valluvanatu, in Jewish Copper Plates (1000 CE)

== Headquarters ==
The headquarters of Valluvanad was Angadipuram, a suburb of present day Perinthalmanna, which is now famous for its Thirumandhamkunnu Temple. The guardian deity of the Valluvanad royal family was Thirumandhamkunnu Bhagavati at Thirumandhamkunnu Temple .

=== Family origin ===
The house/dynasty that had hereditary control over the region (in the north) was known as the &quot;Arangottu Swaroopam&quot;, possibly because the original home of the family was at Arangode (Arangottukara) along Bharathappuzha river near present-day Shoranur . Another possible location for the original home of the family is in the present Kuruva-Makkaraparamba area. There is an Arangottu Siva temple as well there. Kuruva was a part of Valluvanad kingdom while Arangottukara was a part of Nedunganad kingdom. Kuruva is situated near Mankada, where the Kovilakam of Valluvanad royal family known as &quot;Mankada Kovilakam&quot; exists. Kadampuzha, and Tirunavaya are also located near Kuruva.

==History==

=== An entity in south Kerala ===
The Huzur Office Copper Plates (865 CE) (also known as the Parthivapuram plates) mention Valluvanad as a region within the Ay kingdom. Eraniel in Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu is also stated as being within this region. The plates refer to Karunandadakan (having the title of &quot;Sree Vallabhan&quot;) and the establishment of the temple at Parthivasekharapuram (Shri Parthasarathy Temple at Parthivapuram in the Kanyakumari district).

Inscriptions at the Shiva temple at Thiruvotriyur (late 10th century) describing the life of Vellan Kumaran states that he is from a place called &quot;Nandikkarai Puttur&quot; (present-day Thirunandikkara), and is the son of the Valluvanad chieftain (&#x27;valabha rashtra natha&#x27;) Rajasekhara. Vellan Kumaran is described as a commander in the Chola army in the famous Battle of Takkolam (948-49 CE) and considered a close confidante of Chola prince Rajaditya.

=== A district in Central Kerala within the Chera Perumal kingdom ===
Valluvanad was one of the chiefdoms within the kingdom of the Chera Perumals (until the 12th century). The chieftain of Valluvanad, the nadu-udayavar, claimed authority through kinship and descent. The Hundred, the military organisation of the chiefdom, was the &quot;aru-nurruvar&quot; (the Six Hundred). The Vellattiri chieftain (the udayavar) initially exercised suzerain rights over a large portion of central Kerala. A 10th century Chera inscription from Irinjalakuda temple, declaring its protection by the Six Hundred of Valluvanad, shows either the southern extent of the border (or influence) of the chiefdom.

Some scholars state that the Valluvanad in northern Kerala, ruled by hereditary chieftains, was possibly organised in the beginning of the 10th century with a chieftain or general from Valluvanad in the south Kerala nominated as hereditary chieftain so that the name of Valluvanad was also transplanted there.

Rayiran Chathan, the chieftain (the udayavar) of Valluvanad, is mentioned as a witness in the Jewish copper plates of Cochin () issued by the Chera Perumal.

Other references to Valluvanad

* Irayira Chekaran of Valluvanad was involved in a temple resolution to take over the village of Taviranur and bring it under the village of Sukapuram (Edappal) (inscription).
* Irayiravar, the Valluvanad chief, is seen in three temple transaction-related inscriptions from Avattiputhur/Avittathur (near Kodungallur) - an example of the chief performing regulatory functions outside his chiefdom.
* When a market centre was established at Irinjalakkuda (namely &quot;Bhaskarapuram&quot;), the protection of the area was given to the &quot;aru-nurruvar&quot; of Valluvanad (inscription dated to the close of the 10th century). - an example of the Hundred Organisation performing regulatory functions outside the chiefdom.

=== Independent chiefdom ===

With the fall of the Chera Perumal kingdom around the 12th century, the various autonomous chiefdoms became independent. A Valluvanad ruler is mentioned as a witness in the Viraraghava Copper Plates from 1225.

The Brahmins of Sukapuram were supporters of Valluvanad.

=== Zamorin&#x27;s encroachments ===
After the fall of Chera Perumal kingdom in the 12th century, the right to preside over the Tirunavaya Mamankam festival (as the &#x27;Rakshapurusha&#x27;) passed on to the Vellattiri (according to local traditions). When the zamorin (the samoothiri) of Calicut became a major force in Kerala, they made inroads into Valluvanad and even usurped the right to preside over the Mamankam . The zamorin eventually extended his kingdom as east as Nilambur and as deep as Venkattakota (now called Kottakkal) .

Ever since, the Vellattiri used to send groups of suicide warriors (known as the Chavers) to kill the king of Calicut during the Mamankam and the Thaippuyam festivals and recover the long-lost right.

According to historians, &quot;... the caver of Valluvanatu died fighting to avenge the death or defeat of their master and died fighting regularly at Tirunavaya for a long period. It means that the caver died fighting at Tirunavaya even after many generations. Thus it takes the form of blood feud ...&quot;

Notes from historian K. V. Krishna Ayyar

* Brahmin Raja of Tirumanasseri ceded Ponnani to the zamorin as the price for his protection from Valluvanad and Perumpatappu (Cochin) .
*Tradition says that the zamorin, despair for success at Tirunavaya, sought divine help by propitiating the Tirumandhamkunnu Bhagavati .
*Malappuram, on the road between Calicut and Vellattiri&#x27;s headquarters, was entrusted by the zamorin a member of Varakkal Paranampi&#x27;s family (Malappuram Paranampi) . Nilambur was placed under Taccharakkavu Eralan, and Vallappanattukara under Tarakkal Eroma Menon (the commander of Chunganad) and Manjeri under the Karanappad .
*Kariyur Mussad (the Brahmin minister and general of Vellattiri) was captured and put to death at Pataparamba and his lands (the Tens Kalams and Pantalur) were occupied .

=== Mysore&#x27;s Invasion ===
The country marked as &quot;Valluvanad Proper&quot; in the Company records was the sole remaining territory under the control of the Valluvanad &quot;Raja&quot; (chieftain) at the time of the Mysorean invasion of Kerala. The chieftain and his family fled to Travancore.

* According to the ancient laws of Kerala, many Nair chiefs and Nairs were liable to follow the Valluvanad chieftain in battles. These chiefs were allowed hold their land without paying revenue or tribute to the chieftain. Mysore rulers destroyed this custom.
* Grants were made of the lands to the temples, and to the Brahmins, all which lands were by the sultans brought to account in the revenue (the lands were taken from the Brahmins)

At the time of the Mysore conquest the following amsams (of the 1887 Valluvanad and Ernad taluks, the Valluvanad Proper) remained to Vellattiri
*Angadipuram
*Perinthalmanna
*Melattur
*Keezhattur

=== Takeover by the English East India Company===

By the treaty of Seringapatam (1792), Tipu Sultan ceded half of his territories, including Malabar, to the English East India Company.
The Valluvanad Raja, back from exile in Travancore (where the family was since c. 1788), requested the holding of the territories he laid claim to (&quot;Millattoor, Angarypooram, Vanarcaddo, Kaapil&quot;; and &quot;the three districts of Congaad, Manoor and Edratura formerly belonging to Palgautcherry&quot;) as a manager for the company. This was granted as per the agreement, valid for one year, between the Raja (or through his representative Kariat Moosa) and company representatives William G. Farmer Esq. and Major Alexander Dow, concluded at Kozhikode on 30 July 1792.
The Raja undertook to pay a sum of Rs. 38,410.20 to the company within the year (later increased to Rs. 41,594.20). The agreement also mandated revenue collection from all minor landholders who, prior to Tipu&#x27;s rule, only contributed to war efforts. The agreement, in essence, sought to continue revenue collection as per the reforms Tipu had made. Appointment of ministers or other employees in government, or employees engaged in revenue collection, had to be with the consent of the company. The agreement also stipulated that only the company&#x27;s merchants had the right to procure pepper grown in Valluvanad. A detachment of sepoys would also be stationed at Angadipuram.

In May 1793 the Joint Commissioners dismissed the Raja and assumed direct management of the country. Inability to preserve the peace of the district (primarily owing to Mappila uprisings prevalent in the region) and shortfall in revenue collections were cited as the main reasons. Dispute over the management of the three districts formerly belonging to Palgautcherry (Palakkad) had led to the withdrawal of Raja&#x27;s authority of those districts even earlier.
A pension agreement was then settled on between the Raja and the company.

<text>Colonel Thomas Andrew Parker (born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk; June 26, 1909 January 21, 1997) was a Dutch-American talent manager and concert promoter, best known as the manager of Elvis Presley.

Parker was born in the Netherlands and entered the United States illegally when he was 20 years old. He adopted a new name and claimed to have been born in the United States. With a background working in carnivals, Parker moved into music promotion in 1938, working with one of the first popular crooners, Gene Austin, and country music singers Eddy Arnold, Hank Snow, and Tommy Sands. He also assisted Jimmie Davis&#x27;s campaign to become governor of Louisiana, for which he was awarded the honorary rank of &quot;colonel&quot; in the Louisiana State Guard.

Parker encountered Presley in 1955 and by 1956 had become his manager. With Parker&#x27;s help, Presley signed a recording contract with RCA Victor, which led to a commercial breakthrough in 1956 with his sixth single &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; and a career as one of the most commercially successful entertainers in the world. Parker received more than half of the income from the enterprise, an unprecedented figure for a music manager. He negotiated Presley&#x27;s lucrative merchandising deals and media appearances and is said to have influenced Presley&#x27;s personal life, including his decision to accept military service in 1958 and his marriage to Priscilla Beaulieu in 1967. Parker encouraged Presley to make musical films, and they became the focus of his career during his commercial decline in the 1960s until his 1968 comeback and return to touring. Parker&#x27;s influence waned in later years, but he continued in his management role until Presley died in 1977.

Parker managed the Presley estate for the rest of his life. Having previously sold the rights to Presley&#x27;s early recordings to RCA he struggled to secure a steady income, and his financial situation worsened after he sustained significant gambling losses. Parker&#x27;s final years were spent living in Las Vegas, in declining health, until his death in 1997.

==Early life==
Thomas Andrew Parker was born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk on June 26, 1909, in Breda, North Brabant, Netherlands. He was the fourth of 11 children of Maria Elisabeth (Marie) Ponsie and Adam van Kuijk. His Catholic father, a former military man of 12 years, was working as a deliveryman for catalogs when Parker was born. He died at the age of 59 when Parker was 16. 

After his father&#x27;s death, Parker moved to the port city of Rotterdam and lived with an aunt and uncle. His uncle was a skipper by profession who sailed from Breda to Rotterdam. At the age of 17, Parker expressed a desire to run away to the United States to &quot;make his fortune&quot;, and he entered the US illegally.

Biographies usually mention 1927 as the year of Parker&#x27;s first attempt to emigrate to the US, but according to the Holland-Amerika Lijn passenger list that became available online in 2023, he was sent back from New York to the Netherlands on March 20, 1926. He returned home to Rotterdam on the steamship SS &quot;Veendam&quot;. The address he was registered at was Spanjaardstraat 110, Rotterdam. The entry in the passenger list shows the voyage was paid for by the US government. (The passenger lists can be viewed online at the Rotterdam archives.) 

In May 1929, aged nearly 20, Parker returned to the US, this time to stay. Having had previous experience in the traveling entertainment industry, he found work with carnivals and traveled with a Chautauqua educational tent show. A few months later he enlisted in the United States Army, under a false identity to disguise his illegal entry into the country. His new name, Tom Parker, is said to have been taken from the officer who interviewed him during his enrollment. He completed basic training at Fort McPherson in Georgia.

Parker served two years in the 64th Coast Artillery at Fort Shafter, Hawaii, and shortly afterward reenlisted at Fort Barrancas, Florida. Although he had served honorably for a time, he went AWOL in Florida and was charged with desertion. He was punished with solitary confinement, from which he emerged with a psychosis that led him to spend two months in a mental hospital. His condition caused him to be discharged from the army.

Following his discharge, Parker worked at odd jobs, including short-term employments at food concessions and gaming carnivals. Between 1931 and 1938, he worked with Royal American Shows, and began building a list of contacts that would prove valuable in later years.

In 1935, he married 27-year-old Marie Francis Mott. They struggled to make ends meet during the Great Depression, working confidence tricks and traveling across the country in search of work. Parker later said that at times they had to live on as little as $1 a week (US$ in dollars).

==Career==
===Early talent management (1938–1954)===
Parker first became involved in the music industry in 1938 as a promoter, working with popular crooner Gene Austin whose career was at a low point, despite having sold 86 million records since 1924 and earned over $17 million. Austin had spent much of his fortune on extravagant living and his popularity had been eclipsed by other singers such as Bing Crosby. Parker found his career transition smooth, and he used his carnival experience to sell tickets and attract crowds to Austin&#x27;s concerts. While he was a successful promoter, Parker now wanted to move into management.

Austin offered Parker the opportunity to move to Nashville, Tennessee, where music was becoming big business, but Parker turned down the offer. He decided to stay with his family in Temple Terrace, Florida, perhaps to avoid having to submit paperwork that could expose his illegal status. Within a year, Parker had the opportunity to become a legal citizen of the United States when a new law allowed illegal aliens the chance to become US citizens, in return for a promise to fight for the country during World War II if required. Parker served in the peacetime army, but never subsequently applied to become a US citizen, possibly to prevent his previous army record from becoming public or to avoid having to fight.

He found employment as a field agent with a local animal shelter, the Hillsborough County Humane Society. The job offered him not only a secure wage, but also a rent-free apartment for him and his family in a remote part of West Tampa. With the society needing funds, Parker used his promotional experience to raise money and awareness. As part of the fundraising, Parker went to Tennessee to find acts to perform at his charity events, among them well-known artists such as Minnie Pearl and Eddy Arnold. He became involved in music promotion again, but for himself rather than the society. In 1945 Parker became Arnold&#x27;s full-time manager, signed a contract for 25% of his earnings and over the next few years helped him to secure hit songs, television appearances and live tours.

In 1948, Parker was awarded the honorary rank of colonel in the Louisiana State Militia by Jimmie Davis, the governor of Louisiana and a former country singer, in gratitude for Parker&#x27;s work on Davis&#x27;s election campaign. The rank was honorary, since Louisiana had no organized militia, but Parker used the title throughout his life, becoming known simply as &quot;the Colonel&quot;.

A young singer, Tommy Sands, caught his eye in 1952, and Parker immediately began promoting him. He arranged live appearances and became a father figure to the then 15-year-old. Parker had intended to mold Sands into the next Roy Rogers, but Sands was not interested. Parker sent demonstration recordings of Sands to record producer Steve Sholes at RCA Victor, who offered to find songs for him to record.

Eddy Arnold fired Parker in 1953 because of his growing involvement with singer Hank Snow, but Parker remained involved in Arnold&#x27;s live tours and demanded a buyout of $50,000 (US$ in dollars) to settle their contract. Parker and Snow eventually formed Hank Snow Enterprises and Jamboree Attractions, a successful promotional outfit for up-and-coming country singers.

===Meeting Elvis Presley===
In early 1955, Parker heard about Elvis Presley. Presley had a singing style different from the current trend, and Parker became interested in the future of this musical sound. At that time, Parker believed Presley to be black. At this time, Presley was singing in a trio called The Blue Moon Boys, with guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black. Moore became Presley&#x27;s first manager at the encouragement of Sun Records owner Sam Phillips, who was worried about unscrupulous promoters taking advantage of Presley. However, Moore and Black were excluded when Presley signed a recording contract with Phillips. Phillips told them to make a separate deal with Elvis. According to Moore, Presley agreed to take 50%, with Moore and Black splitting the other 50%. A one-year management contract with Presley gave Moore a 10% commission, which he never took. The contract, dated July 12, 1954, eight days after their first recording session, was signed by Presley and his parents. When the contract expired, the Memphis radio personality Bob Neal stepped in and made a deal with Phillips to become Presley&#x27;s manager. By this point, Moore and Black had no contractual ties to either Phillips or Presley. 

Neal began to struggle to accommodate his new client&#x27;s success, and in February 1955, following a meeting with Parker, Presley agreed to let Parker take some control of future bookings and promotions.
Parker and Neal worked together to promote Presley, using their own &quot;Hank Snow Tour&quot; to book him and tour him. Although Neal remained Presley&#x27;s official manager, Parker became increasingly involved in managing his career. By the summer of 1955 he had become Presley&#x27;s &quot;special advisor&quot;. As Presley was still a minor, his parents had to sign the contract with Parker on his behalf. Part of Parker&#x27;s role was to secure a new recording contract with a more prominent label. Presley had been at Sun Records since the beginning of his career, but Sam Phillips, the owner of Presley&#x27;s current label, was aware that to have any success in the future Presley would need the backing of a much larger brand. Despite this, Phillips was not keen to let him go quickly, advising Parker that he would require $40,000 (US$ in dollars) to secure the release of Presley&#x27;s contract, an utterly unheard-of sum at the time.

Parker immediately began to seek a new label for Presley. Both Mercury Records and Columbia Records showed interest. However, their initial offers were nowhere near the $40,000 requirement. RCA Victor, Hank Snow&#x27;s current label, also showed an interest, although it was somewhat wary of the cost of the contract. However, RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes was convinced that Presley&#x27;s style of music would be a massive hit if he signed with the right label, and he began talks with Parker. RCA made clear that it was unwilling to go above $25,000 for a practically unknown singer, but Parker persuaded them that Presley was no ordinary unknown singer. Around the same time, realizing the deal for Presley might fall through due to the cost of the contract, Parker attempted to sell Tommy Sands to RCA. He suggested to Sholes that Sands could record material similar to Presley&#x27;s style. Remembering his previous experience with Sands, Sholes dismissed Sands as a viable replacement for Presley. 

In November, Parker and Snow persuaded RCA to buy Presley out from Sun for $40,000, and on November 21, Presley&#x27;s contract was officially transferred from Sun Records to RCA Victor. Snow attended the signing, thinking Elvis had signed a management contract with Jamboree Attractions, which he owned with Parker. However, that was not the case since Elvis was still under contract with Bob Neal. The document signed on November 21 pertained to the record label transfer. In return for a more significant financial stake in the deal, Neal agreed not to renew his management contract with Presley after it expired in March 1956, allowing Parker the opportunity to claim the job for himself.

=== Signing Elvis (1956–1957) ===
On March 26, 1956, after Presley&#x27;s management contract with Neal expired, Presley signed a contract making Parker his exclusive representative. Later, when Hank Snow asked Parker about the status of their contract with Presley, Parker told him: &quot;You don&#x27;t have any contract with Elvis Presley. Elvis is signed exclusively to the Colonel.&quot;

With his first RCA Victor single, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, in 1956, Presley became a recording star, and Parker began bringing his new star to the national stage. He arranged for Presley to appear on popular television shows, such as &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot; and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show,&quot; securing fees that made Presley the highest-paid star on television. By the summer, Presley had become one of the most famous new faces of the year, causing excitement among the new teenage audience and outrage among some older audiences and religious groups. Presley said of Parker: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I would have ever been huge if it wasn&#x27;t for him. He&#x27;s a brilliant man.&quot;

Parker signed a deal with Beverly Hills film merchandiser Hank Saperstein for nearly $40,000 to turn Presley into a brand name. With over 78 different products for sale, from charm bracelets to record players, Presley merchandise brought in $22 million by the end of 1956. Parker, with his 25% share of profits, found ways to make money from his artist that other managers had never thought of, such as simultaneously selling &quot;I Love Elvis&quot; and &quot;I Hate Elvis&quot; buttons.

In April 1956, Parker made his first mistake with Presley&#x27;s career. He booked Presley for a four-week engagement in Las Vegas, misjudging the potential reactions of the slightly older, more reserved audiences that Las Vegas attracted. While Presley was a hit among the youth of America, older audiences found him an oddity. Some viewed him as a clown-like figure, wiggling his hips for screams, while others found him vulgar and more suitable for late-night gentleman&#x27;s clubs. After a cold reception during his first few shows, Parker cut Presley&#x27;s appearance to two weeks. Presley remembered the event as one of the worst moments of his career.

Despite this setback, Presley&#x27;s career continued to grow. Remembering that Presley had expressed interest in acting when they first met, Parker arranged a screen test with Paramount Pictures. The company was impressed with Presley&#x27;s acting ability, and they signed Presley to a seven-picture contract. Parker ensured that the agreement allowed Presley the freedom to make at least one film a year with another studio and also managed to set up an office, with staff, at Paramount. Presley&#x27;s acting career was initially intended to be a serious one. However, Parker persuaded Presley to sing in his movies after seeing the opportunity to cross-promote singles and albums with the films. This proved very lucrative, especially when the single for Presley&#x27;s first film, &quot;Love Me Tender,&quot; sold over one million copies in advance sales. By the end of 1956, Parker had made Presley one of the world&#x27;s most well-known and well-paid entertainers.

In 1957, Parker finally managed to give Tommy Sands his big break by arranging for him to audition for and star in an episode of &quot;Kraft Television Theater&quot; called &quot;&quot;The Singin&#x27; Idol&quot;.&quot; The episode&#x27;s storyline was loosely based on the life and career of Presley. NBC had originally wanted Presley for the role, but Parker had turned them down. In the drama, the role of Sands was portrayed as a &quot;twisted psychopath&quot;. Critics were very positive in their reviews of both the drama and Sands, leading to Capitol Records signing Sands within a week. Soon after, Sands&#x27; song &quot;Teen-Age Crush&quot; reached number 2 on the pop charts, eventually selling 800,000 copies. 

=== Elvis in the Army (1958–1960) ===
Regardless of Parker and Presley&#x27;s success, Parker was still struggling to believe that Presley&#x27;s career would last longer than a year or two. Parker had seen many acts come and go during his earlier years in management and felt that it would be foolish to believe that Presley, despite being Parker&#x27;s most successful act to date, would be any different. In January 1958, Presley received his draft notice from the United States Army. Presley was upset about the potential negative effect accepting the draft could have on his career, but Parker was secretly overjoyed.

Presley had been showing signs of rebellion against Parker, and Parker believed that a stint in the Army would cure him of this. Parker was looking ahead when he persuaded Presley to become a soldier. Presley had wanted to join Special Services, allowing him the opportunity to perform while at the same time getting a more leisurely ride than other soldiers. Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any particular treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music. If Presley could show the world that he was treated the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into Parker&#x27;s own service record. He also realized that it would be an excellent opportunity to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the army haircut that would see the shearing of Presley&#x27;s iconic hairstyle.

While Presley served in West Germany, Parker appeared to be in complete control, but he was worried about the outside influences that Presley might encounter there. Parker had declined to travel to Europe to visit Presley, denying that he spoke any language other than English. He sent Presley&#x27;s friends to keep him company, arranged for business associates to watch over him while working in Europe, and maintained regular contact with him. He was reportedly afraid that Presley would realize that other managers were prepared to sign contracts that did not require as much as 25% of his earnings.

Parker also worried about Presley losing his fame while he was away in the army, so Parker worked hard to keep Presley&#x27;s name known to the public. He realized that by keeping RCA Victor and the public hungry for more Presley material, he could negotiate a better contract when Presley returned from active service. He had arranged for Presley to record five singles before his induction, guaranteeing RCA Victor enough material to release over two years. RCA was eager for Presley to record in West Germany. Still, Parker insisted it would ruin his reputation as a regular soldier if he could go into a recording studio. Stories appeared in the press regularly about Presley, including that he would do a live CCTV broadcast when he returned and that he had signed a deal for a series of annual television spectaculars to be broadcast across the country. All of these stories were fabrications, but they kept Presley&#x27;s name in the public consciousness.

=== Elvis returns (1960–1965) ===
For Presley&#x27;s return in March 1960, Parker arranged for a train to take him from Washington, D.C., to Memphis, with stops so that fans could see their idol in person. If Parker was still worried about Presley&#x27;s having lost his fame, he was disabused of this notion when he witnessed the turnout along the route.

Frank Sinatra, who had declared Presley a rock and roll disgrace in the 1950s, had since become keen to have him appear on &quot;The Frank Sinatra Show&quot;. Parker, not one to forget harsh criticism, stated that the fee would be for two songs, a total of eight minutes on screen; Sinatra himself was receiving a lower sum for the whole show, but he agreed. The show, &quot;Welcome Home, Elvis&quot;, was Presley&#x27;s first national television appearance since &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in January 1957.

After the Sinatra special, Parker decided that Presley&#x27;s future lay in Hollywood. He envisioned Presley as an entertainment machine on becoming a film actor, pumping out three feature films and soundtracks a year until the decade&#x27;s end. He allowed him to perform three live shows in 1961, all charity events, two in Memphis and one in Hawaii. After that, Presley gave no live performances until 1968 and had minimal contact with his fans. Parker signed long-term contracts with the Hollywood film studios, possibly to guarantee work and income for both him and Presley. This was, in hindsight, a mistake on his part; if he had negotiated each deal separately based on the profits of the previous film, he could have received more money. Throughout the 1960s, Parker continually renegotiated Presley&#x27;s film contracts, often paying little attention to his client&#x27;s scripts or concerns. These deals were sometimes so harsh on the studios that it led producer Hal Wallis to state: &quot;I&#x27;d rather try and close a deal with the Devil.&quot;

Presley had to do no more than provide RCA Victor with three albums a year, and his film soundtracks did that for him. With no concert touring or public appearances to be made, Parker was able to keep costs to a minimum. For the first few years, Presley&#x27;s films were somewhat successful, his albums topped the charts, and any singles released were mainly hits. But as time went on, Presley became less significant as the Beatles began to dominate the music charts, and the worldwide phenomenon known as Beatlemania began. Presley&#x27;s films still made money, and his albums still sold well, but the profits were falling. This led Parker to insist that films be made cheaply, on a strict schedule, and with as little hassle as possible. 

=== Dead ends (1966–1967) ===
For the remainder of the 1960s, Presley starred in films that relied heavily on exotic locations and mundane songs, and he was tied into contracts that he could not escape. Parker did not appear to care if the films were good or bad, but only about the profits. When Presley complained to him that he wanted better scripts, Parker reminded him of his lavish lifestyle and that risking $1 million a year for doing practically no work was dangerous. Presley&#x27;s career stagnated while artists like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and The Beach Boys dominated the charts. Later, in a 1983 interview, Parker admitted that after 1966, the income from Presley films and soundtracks had dramatically declined. 

To make up for the lack of earnings, Parker arranged for Presley&#x27;s gold Cadillac to go on tour. Selling it to RCA for $24,000 ($ in dollars), it was used to promote Presley&#x27;s latest film, &quot;Frankie &amp; Johnny.&quot; The Cadillac tour proved somewhat more successful than the film itself. In Houston alone in one afternoon, 40,000 people paid to see it, with one woman offering to have sex with the tour manager if he would allow her to sit in it.

On January 2, 1967, Parker re-negotiated his managerial/agent contract with Presley, persuading him to increase Parker&#x27;s share from 25% to 50% on certain transactions. When critics questioned this arrangement and wondered if Parker was taking advantage of Presley, Presley quipped, &quot;I could have signed with East Coast Entertainment where they take 70%!&quot; Parker used the argument that Presley was his only client and he was thus earning only one fee. In 1966, with Presley showing signs of rebellion again, and his career on the decline, Parker decided it was time for a new approach: marriage. Presley had lived with Priscilla Beaulieu for the past four years, and Parker hoped that marriage would boost Presley&#x27;s career and possibly tame him. With Priscilla&#x27;s stepfather dropping heavy hints, Parker persuaded Presley that he ought to make an &quot;honest woman&quot; of her very soon. Parker decided that Las Vegas was the perfect place to have the wedding, and on May 1, 1967, the couple was married in a quiet ceremony that lasted only eight minutes and had a handful of guests. A breakfast reception was arranged after the media got photographs of the couple.

=== Live performance comeback (1968–1972) ===

It took the 1968 television special &quot;Elvis&quot;, which was sponsored by Singer sewing machines, and a subsequent series of recording sessions in Memphis, Tennessee, that included songs such as &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; and &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;, to restore Presley&#x27;s musical reputation. Steve Binder, the producer of the television special, put forward the idea of Presley singing his old hits. Binder also thought of the idea of Presley performing the staged section with his old band, Scotty Moore and D. J. Fontana; this had been inspired by a post-rehearsal informal jam in Presley&#x27;s dressing room. Presley did not usually stand up against Parker, but he knew that this TV show was his one chance at a proper comeback, and with Binder backing him, Presley told Parker he was doing it &quot;Binder&#x27;s way&quot;. Their instincts were proven right; the TV special proved to be an enormous hit, and the released album featuring performances from the special became a best-seller. After the special, Parker managed Presley&#x27;s return to live performance, including brief U.S. tours and many engagements in Las Vegas. Following the success of Presley&#x27;s Las Vegas return, Parker signed a contract with the International Hotel to guarantee Presley would play a month-long engagement for $125,000 a week ($ in dollars), an unheard-of sum at the time. During this part of Presley&#x27;s career, Parker and Presley agreed to a 50/50 &quot;partnership&quot;, which, with Parker controlling merchandising and other non-music related items, resulted in Parker earning more than his client.

After the success of Presley&#x27;s return to live performing in Las Vegas, Parker decided it was time for Presley to go on tour for first time in 13 years. The tours were so financially successful that they determined Presley&#x27;s workload for the remainder of his life and career. Parker&#x27;s main role during these tours was planning the logistics and ensuring tickets were sold. He usually flew ahead to the venues and took charge of preparing everything for Presley&#x27;s entourage ahead of their arrival. As a result, he and Presley rarely saw each other, and, as time progressed, it became even more difficult for Parker to get in contact with Presley. These live performances, along with being financially lucrative, also allowed Parker to fulfill Presley&#x27;s recording contract with RCA Victor. Between 1969 and 1972 alone, RCA released three albums of live material.

By 1972, Parker had managed to increase Presley&#x27;s weekly wage in Las Vegas to $150,000 ($ in dollars) and secured $50,000 a year ($ in dollars) for himself as a &quot;consultant to the hotel chain&quot;. Parker also decided that it was time for Presley to return to New York and arranged for him to perform at Madison Square Garden in June. Originally planned as three performances, demand was so high that Parker decided to add a fourth performance, making Presley the first performer to sell out the venue four consecutive times. These four shows alone grossed $730,000 ($ in dollars).

On July 8, 1972, inspired by the visit of President Richard Nixon to China a few months earlier, Parker announced that there would be a worldwide satellite broadcast from Hawaii to allow the whole world the chance to see a Presley concert, &quot;since we can&#x27;t play in every major city&quot;. Except for a few concerts in Canada in 1957, Presley never performed outside the United States. Parker held another press conference in Las Vegas on September 4, 1972, to confirm that the concert, now titled &quot;Aloha from Hawaii,&quot; would be broadcast on January 14, 1973. The press was told that an audience of one billion was expected to tune in to see the &quot;first entertainment special to be broadcast live around the world&quot;; although Parker had not taken into account the fact that many countries, including parts of Europe and America, would not see the concert live due to the time of the broadcast. Parker received a letter from &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; columnist Eddie Sherman two weeks after the Las Vegas press conference. Sherman had read in news accounts that there was to be no charge for admittance to the concerts, a donation to charity is required instead. He suggested to Parker that, as Presley had recorded and was still performing the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember You&quot; written by Kui Lee, the donations could go to the Kui Lee Cancer Fund that had been set up following the death of the songwriter in 1966. Seeing the chance to publicize Presley&#x27;s charitable nature once again, Parker eagerly agreed. The album was released simultaneously around the world and went to number 1 on the US charts in 1974, the first Presley album to do so since the &quot;Roustabout&quot; soundtrack.

=== 1973–1974 ===
In May 1973, in an attempt to deal with Presley&#x27;s growing dependence on prescription drugs, Parker and Presley&#x27;s father, Vernon, attempted to cut off his drug supply. They hired private detectives to find out where the drugs were coming from and successfully stopped any more from reaching Presley. However, Presley found other doctors to meet his demands. In later years, several of Presley&#x27;s inner circles would tell of how difficult it was to persuade Presley to quit the drugs. As well as being their employer and paying their wages, he was also their main source of drug access for themselves. Presley&#x27;s main doctor, George C. Nichopoulos, often replaced Presley&#x27;s medication with placebos in an attempt to wean him off the drugs. This trick would be successful for a short time, but when Presley discovered the trick, he found himself other doctors. Author Alanna Nash suggests the possibility that Parker didn&#x27;t intervene more because he may not have known how to handle the situation. In Nash&#x27;s book, &quot;The Colonel&quot;, she writes: &quot;In the days before the Betty Ford Clinic, the Colonel didn&#x27;t know where to take him for discreet, effective help and loathed risking the loss of work if the truth got out&quot;.

After the &quot;Aloha&quot; special, Parker made a deal that would later be used in court to prove that he had not acted in Presley&#x27;s best interests. He offered RCA Records the opportunity to buy Presley&#x27;s entire back catalog for $5.4 million. At the time, the catalog was not considered very important, and RCA initially calculated it at being worth much less; however, in later years, it would become one of the most valuable record catalogs in the music business. The sale of the back catalog to RCA meant that after his death, Presley&#x27;s estate would not receive any royalties for any Presley recordings made prior to 1973. However, Presley had asked Parker to raise funds to pay for his upcoming divorce settlement, as Priscilla filed for divorce in 1973.

During a closing night performance on September 3, 1973, following news that a Hilton staff member of whom Presley was fond had been fired, Presley attacked Hilton Hotels chairman Barron Hilton in a verbal rage on stage. Parker was furious, and he stormed into Presley&#x27;s dressing room after the show to confront him. After a heated argument between the two, Presley told Parker he was fired. Angered by this outburst, Parker declared: &quot;You can&#x27;t fire me. I quit!&quot;

Parker accepted that their working relationship was over and demanded that Presley pay him $2 million to end their contract, money that Parker claimed he was owed. After nearly two weeks of trading insults back and forth, Parker and Presley decided to continue to work together.

Although many around Presley were worried about his worsening drug dependency, Parker appeared to ignore the problem. Several members of Presley&#x27;s band later stated that Parker had no idea just how bad the situation was getting. However, other friends and members of Presley&#x27;s entourage have stood by the suggestion that Parker didn&#x27;t want to admit there was such a problem because he didn&#x27;t know how to deal with it, and he was also worried about any negative publicity it would create. According to Parker himself, he did privately attempt to talk to his client a number of times about the matter, but allegedly every time Parker casually told Presley to quit or at least tone it down with the pill popping and binge eating, Presley responded by telling Parker to stay out of his personal business.

From 1974 onward, Presley&#x27;s weight gain and prescription drug abuse became too much to be controlled. In Las Vegas, he was starting to appear drugged on stage, slurring his words and forgetting song lyrics.

=== 1975–1977 ===
In March 1975, during his engagement in Las Vegas, Presley, along with Parker, met with Barbra Streisand and Jon Peters. They discussed the possibility of Presley co-starring with Streisand in a remake of the film&quot; A Star Is Born.&quot; Seeing it as a chance to finally be taken seriously as an actor, Presley agreed to take the role if the contracts could be worked out. According to Presley&#x27;s friend, Jerry Schilling, Presley was excited about the opportunity to take on a new challenge. Streisand&#x27;s production company, First Artists, offered Presley a salary of $500,000 ($ in dollars) and 10% of the profits. Parker, who had always dealt with Presley&#x27;s film contracts and viewed the offer as a starting bid to earning more money, instead asked for a salary of $1 million ($ in dollars), 50% of the profits, plus another $100,000 ($ in dollars) for expenses and spoke of needing to arrange details of a soundtrack deal. First Artists, not used to such huge demands, didn&#x27;t put forward a counteroffer and decided instead to offer the role, along with the original salary offer, to Kris Kristofferson, who accepted. Parker later claimed that Presley had asked him to make the contract so demanding so that they would not offer him the part, although many of Presley&#x27;s friends have contradicted Parker&#x27;s statement because they had said Presley was furious at losing the role.

Later in 1975, the government of Saudi Arabia offered Parker $5 million for Presley to perform there. Parker turned the offer down, and Presley was overjoyed when they replied with another offer of $10 million. Yet, despite Presley&#x27;s eagerness to do the shows, Parker again turned them down. Promoters in South America also made offers, as much as $2.5 million, and all of them were turned down by Parker; &quot;Well, whenever I need $2.5 million, I&#x27;ll call you,&quot; he once said to them. Presley was beginning to consider new management, with Concerts West co-founder Tom Hulett being the clear favorite for the job. Hulett&#x27;s company had managed tours for Presley and had worked with artists such as Led Zeppelin. According to several people who knew Presley at the time, the talks with Hulett got so far along that it seemed almost inevitable that they would close the deal. The talks had included details about European tours, and buying out Presley&#x27;s contract would not have been a problem for Hulett and his company. Despite this, however, the deal never materialized. According to Presley&#x27;s biographer Peter Guralnick, Presley and Parker &quot;were really like, in a sense, a married couple, who started out with great love, loyalty, respect that lasted for a considerable period of time, and went through a number of stages until, towards the end of Presley&#x27;s life, they should have walked away. None of the rules of the relationship was operative any longer, yet neither had the courage to walk away, for a variety of reasons.&quot; In any case, Parker remained Presley&#x27;s manager without a break until Presley&#x27;s death in 1977.

By this time, Parker was aware that Presley needed a rest from touring and the chance to deal with his prescription drug addictions. He phoned Presley&#x27;s father once to suggest taking time off, but Vernon Presley told him they couldn&#x27;t afford to stop touring due to Presley&#x27;s constant and lavish spending. Vernon also threatened to find a new manager if Parker wouldn&#x27;t continue to tour Presley.

In July 1976, three of Presley&#x27;s personal bodyguards and members of the &quot;Memphis Mafia&quot;, Robert Gene &quot;Red&quot; West, his cousin Sonny West and David Hebler, were fired by Vernon Presley and decided to write a tell-all book about their life in his inner circle, &quot;.&quot; Worried about the impact such details might have on his career, Presley, through his father, asked Parker to stop the publication. Parker made several attempts but failed to do so. According to Presley&#x27;s friend Larry Geller, Parker secretly wanted the book to be published, hoping that it would help Presley realize the severity of his situation and persuade him to do something about it. The book was published one year later on July 12, 1977, about a month before Presley&#x27;s death.

For the remainder of Presley&#x27;s life, Parker saw little of him. The two had become almost strangers, and false reports in the media suggested that Presley&#x27;s contract was up for sale. Although Parker publicly denied these claims, he had been in talks with Peter Grant, the manager of Led Zeppelin, about the possibility of him overseeing a European tour for Presley. Despite the new rumors of Presley touring overseas, however, Parker never followed through with the deal.

=== 1977: Presley&#x27;s death ===
When Presley died on August 16, 1977, one day before he was due to go on tour, some accounts suggest Parker acted as if nothing had happened. Other accounts suggest he slumped in his chair at his office, muttered, &quot;Oh, dear God&quot;, and then quickly phoned Vernon Presley, where Parker advised Presley&#x27;s father that his son&#x27;s image needed to be protected. This would be more in keeping with Parker&#x27;s own interests.

Parker set out to protect his future income. When he was asked by a journalist what he would do now with Elvis Presley having died, Parker responded: &quot;Why, I&#x27;ll just go right on managing him!&quot; Almost immediately, before even visiting Graceland, Parker traveled to New York City to meet with merchandising associates and executives with RCA Records, instructing them to prepare for a huge demand in Elvis Presley products. Shortly afterward, he traveled to Memphis for Presley&#x27;s funeral. Mourners recall being surprised at his wearing a Hawaiian shirt and baseball cap, smoking his trademark cigar, and purposely avoiding the casket. At the funeral, he persuaded Presley&#x27;s father to sign over control of Presley&#x27;s career in death to him.

In September 1978, shortly after the first anniversary of Presley&#x27;s death, Parker arranged a fan festival, called Always Elvis, where he, Vernon, and Presley&#x27;s ex-wife Priscilla dedicated a bronze statue of him in the lobby of the Las Vegas Hilton.

=== 1978–1997: After Elvis ===
Following Presley&#x27;s death, Parker set up a licensing operation with Factors Etc. Inc, to control Presley merchandise and keep a steady income supporting his estate. It was later revealed that Presley owned 22% of the company, Parker owned 56%, and the final 22% was made up of various business associates. Due to an ill-advised agreement between Parker and Presley that gave RCA sole ownership of all his recording royalties prior to 1973, the estate was relying heavily on the income from Factors Etc. However, because Parker was still entitled to 50% of all Presley&#x27;s income, and after taxes were taken off, the overall amount going towards the upkeep of the estate was less than $1 million a year.

In January 1979, it was discovered that Presley had lost out on royalties for songs on which he had been listed as an author or composer because Parker had unwisely advised him not to sign up with ASCAP or its younger competitor, BMI. Experts in the field at the time estimated that this mistake had potentially cost Presley millions of dollars, and it had potentially cost Parker millions too. Parker had unknowingly backed himself into a financial corner.

By 1980, the cost of running the estate was estimated to be as much as $500,000 a year. Priscilla and the two other co trustees were prepared to let Parker continue to handle Presley&#x27;s business affairs, and petitioned the court to that end. However, Judge Joseph Evans, aware that Lisa Marie Presley was still a minor, appointed attorney Blanchard E. Tual to investigate Parker&#x27;s management. Tual, once appointed as Lisa Marie&#x27;s guardian &quot;ad litem&quot;, chose to investigate the entire period of Parker&#x27;s management of Presley; his preliminary finding was that Parker&#x27;s management deal of 50% was extortionate compared to the industry average of 15–20%. He also noted that Parker&#x27;s handling of Presley&#x27;s business affairs during his lifetime, including the decision to sell off past royalties to RCA for $5.4 million in 1973, was unethical and poorly handled. During a second, more detailed investigation, Tual discovered that all earnings were paid directly to the trust instead of Parker. By this time, with the IRS demanding almost $15 million in taxes, the estate was facing bankruptcy.

On August 14, 1981, Judge Evans ordered Elvis Presley Enterprises to sue Parker for mismanagement. Parker countersued. The case against Parker was settled out of court in 1983, with the estate paying him $2 million ($ in dollars) in exchange for all Presley audio recordings or visual images that he owned and the termination of his involvement in any Presley related earnings for five years.

Parker worked as a &quot;consultant&quot; for Hilton Hotels for a number of years after Presley&#x27;s death, with some believing he was working to pay off debts owed to the casino from his gambling during Presley&#x27;s performances there. Part of this role resulted in Parker keeping the same fourth-floor suite he occupied when Presley was alive. By 1984, with his gambling debts reportedly rising again, he was evicted. On the surface, however, relations between Parker and Hilton Hotels appeared to be as good as ever, with Parker helping the Hilton to organize another fan convention event in August 1987 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Presley&#x27;s death.

The disputes with the Presley estate did not terminate Parker&#x27;s association with Presley. Parker appeared at posthumous events honoring Presley, such as the 1993 issuing of a U.S. postage stamp with Presley&#x27;s likeness. He also became friendly with the estate again, attending special ceremonies and events in Memphis, invited by Priscilla. However, he did occasionally bother them by criticizing some decisions. In 1994, following the marriage of Lisa Marie Presley and Michael Jackson, Parker stated that Presley would probably not have approved. In 1993, during an event honoring Elvis Presley at the Hilton Hotel in Las Vegas, when a reporter questioned Parker&#x27;s interest in Presley&#x27;s enduring legend provoked Parker to remark: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I exploited Elvis as much as he&#x27;s being exploited today.&quot;

==Personal life==

As Presley&#x27;s fame grew, the public became interested in Parker as well. For some time, Parker lied about his childhood, claiming that he was born in Huntington, West Virginia in the early 1900s—attempting to pass off his Dutch accent as a Southern accent. He claimed he had run away from home at an early age to join a circus owned by an uncle, then served in the U.S. Army prior to his involvement as a music manager. The truth about his early years was revealed in 1960 when one of Parker&#x27;s sisters, Nel Dankers-van Kuijk, living in the Netherlands, recognized him in photographs standing next to Presley.

One of Parker&#x27;s brothers, Adam &quot;Ad&quot; van Kuijk, visited him once in Los Angeles in April 1961. Parker privately acknowledged his brother and even introduced him to Presley. During the week-long visit, Parker was informed by Adam that their mother had died three years earlier in 1958, never knowing what happened to her son. Adam van Kuijk died from emphysema in 1992, never seeing or visiting Parker again.

The claim of Parker&#x27;s Dutch heritage was publicly confirmed when Parker failed to avert a lawsuit brought against him in 1982 by asserting in open court that he was a Dutch citizen. The opposing counsel responded by presenting into evidence a copy of Parker&#x27;s U.S. Army enlistment form which stated, through a legal loophole, that because Parker signed his enlistment papers under his alias &quot;Thomas Andrew Parker&quot; and swore allegiance to the United States, that he had renounced his Dutch citizenship. In 1993, in one of Parker&#x27;s last media appearances, he was interviewed by Dutch TV director Jorrit van der Kooi. The two spoke in Dutch about the Netherlands and about Elvis Presley&#x27;s life and career, and Parker said he was not aware that another of his sisters, Adriana van Kuijk, had died in the Netherlands a few years earlier.

===Marriage===
In 1935, while traveling with a circus, Parker met and married a 27-year-old woman named Marie Francis Mott. Marie was one of six children, had been married twice before and had a son from her first marriage. Unbeknownst to Parker, she had a second son from her first marriage but had given him up for adoption at birth due to his disability, a club foot. Some suggested that Parker married Marie to disguise his illegal status in the United States; a marriage to a U.S. citizen with a child could help him bury his past in a &quot;ready-made family&quot;. There is no proof that anything other than romance led to their marriage.

Others had doubts about whether they were legally married. According to interviews given by Parker to the Associated Press many years later, he and Marie were married in Tampa, Florida during the winter of 1932, but the Florida Office of Vital Statistics has no record of such a marriage between a couple with those names at any time between 1927 and 1946. It is also recorded that Marie did not divorce her second husband until 1936, and her brother Bitsy recalled no ceremony of marriage between Parker and Marie. Author Alanna Nash has suggested that the couple may have simply placed their hands on a Bible and given themselves a &quot;carny wedding&quot;.

In the early days of their marriage, Marie and Parker worked together in the carnivals. As Parker&#x27;s management career began to take off, Marie became more of a housewife, although she would occasionally travel with him to various parts of the country. During the 1960s, after many years of ill health, Marie began to display signs of dementia. Parker began to distance himself emotionally from her, heartbroken by her slow mental deterioration from the woman he once knew. Marie died on November 25, 1986, of a chronic brain syndrome at age 78. In October 1990, Parker married Loanne Miller, his personal secretary since 1972. He continued living in Las Vegas, mostly avoiding contact with the press.

===Gambling===
Many Parker biographers, including Dirk Vellenga and Alanna Nash, have stated that Parker&#x27;s gambling habit began to get out of control in the mid-1960s. During the 1960s, with his wife&#x27;s health deteriorating and Presley&#x27;s career struggling, Parker found an escape in gambling at Las Vegas casinos. Fans and biographers alike believe that one of the main reasons Parker signed Presley to a Vegas hotel in 1969 for his live comeback was to help cover losses at their casino. He would often spend 12–14 hours at a time gambling in the casinos, betting large sums. It is believed that Parker lost at least $1 million a year from gambling. At the time of Presley&#x27;s death in 1977, it was suspected that Parker owed the Las Vegas Hilton over $30 million ($ in dollars) in gambling losses. After a lifetime that saw him earn in excess of $100 million, Parker&#x27;s estate was worth barely $1 million when he died.

&quot;Colonel Tom Parker rubbed my head in Vegas&quot;, Eddie Murphy stated in 1989. &quot;A couple times he set me up in the Elvis Presley suite on top of the Hilton, and I would go play Elvis for a week… One night we were at the crap table together and he rubbed my head for luck. I wanted to punch him in the face. But this guy is like eighty years old – too old to be taught the limits of racism… He probably doesn&#x27;t realize how horrible a thing that was to do.&quot;

Songwriter Mac Davis recounted a similar experience where Parker rubbed his head and declared &quot;You&#x27;re going to be a star. You tell everybody the Colonel touched your head.&quot; Later, Davis says &quot;He remembered me, and he said &#x27;I told you you were going to be a star.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Yeah, you rubbed my head.&#x27; He said &#x27;Did I really?&#x27; I said &#x27;Yeah&#x27;. He said &#x27;Well then there ain&#x27;t no doubt about it. You&#x27;re going to be a star.&#x27;&quot;

==Death==
Parker made his last public appearances in 1994. By that time, he was so stricken with diabetes, gout, and other health problems that he could barely leave his home.

On January 20, 1997, his wife heard a crash from the living room. When Parker failed to answer her calls, she went in to find him slumped in his armchair, having suffered a stroke. He died of complications from the stroke the following morning at a hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, at age 87, with his wife at his bedside. On his death certificate, in addition to his name, dates of birth and death, and the cause of death, it also lists his birth name as Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk, his place of birth as the Netherlands, and his citizenship (albeit incorrectly) as American.

His funeral was held a few days later at the Hilton Hotel and was attended by a handful of friends and former associates, including Eddy Arnold and Sam Phillips. Priscilla Presley attended the funeral to represent the Elvis Presley Estate and gave a eulogy that, to many in the room, summed up Parker: &quot;Elvis and the Colonel made history together, and the world is richer, better and far more interesting because of their collaboration. And now I need to locate my wallet, because I noticed there was no ticket booth on the way in here, but I&#x27;m sure that the Colonel must have arranged for some toll on the way out.&quot; She reiterated her positive opinion to Tom Hanks in 2022 when the actor prepared to play Parker for &quot;Elvis&quot; (2022). Hanks said, &quot;I was anticipating hearing horror stories about this venal, cheap crook. Just the opposite. Both Priscilla and Jerry said he was a lovely man&quot;. According to Priscilla, Elvis was happy to pay Parker 50% of his earnings to manage him.

==Portrayals and popular culture==

===Film===

Parker has been portrayed by:

* Tom Hanks in &quot;Elvis&quot;, the 2022 film about Presley, directed by Baz Luhrmann. He is shown to speak Polari, or “Palare” in this film, which is accurate since carnival workers spoke Palare.

===Literature===
* Vivek Tiwary&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Beatle&quot; (2013), a graphic novel biography of the Beatles manager Brian Epstein, depicts a meeting between Parker and Epstein that took place in the mid-1960s. In the scene, Parker is satirically portrayed as a gluttonous, satanic figure. The scene contrasts Parker&#x27;s management of Elvis with the freedom Epstein allows the Beatles. The scene also portrays Parker as antisemitic. Tiwary claimed in an interview that Parker did make those comments.

===Television===
* In the TV series &quot;Vinyl&quot;, Richie Finestra (portrayed by Bobby Cannavale), president of record label American Century, meets Elvis Presley (portrayed by Shawn Klush) in 1973, in Las Vegas. Richie attempts to convince Elvis to stop singing in Las Vegas and instead focus on making new, creative music, acting like a true king. The Colonel (portrayed by Gene Jones) gets furious when he finds out Richie was going behind his back and talking about papers with Elvis and has Elvis point a gun at him.
* In the TV series &quot;Green Acres&quot;, the character of Mr. Eustace Haney (portrayed by Pat Buttram) was inspired by Parker, whom Buttram encountered in the 1950s.

<text>The Caesars Palace Grand Prix was an annual car race held in Las Vegas, US from 1981 to 1984. In 1981 and 1982 the race was part of the Formula One World Championship and featured a 2.268 mile (3.650 km), 14 turn Grand Prix layout; in 1983 and 1984 it became a round of the CART Indy car series and featured a 5 turn 1.125 mile (1.811 km) distorted oval layout. Nissan/Datsun was a presenting sponsor of the races. The races were held on a temporary circuit in the parking lot of the Caesars Palace hotel.

== History ==

There had been Can-Am races at the Stardust International Raceway in the mid to late 1960s, but that circuit was bought by developers and then demolished in 1970. The first race was originally supposed to take place as the last race of the 1980 season on November 2, 4 weeks after the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen. But when Watkins Glen went off the schedule after 1980, the Caesars&#x27; Palace Grand Prix gained importance, and more effort was put forth by Bernie Ecclestone and others to make sure this Las Vegas race went ahead. The new race ended the year, whereas Long Beach, only away, started it. But the Las Vegas Caesars Palace circuit was not as popular among the drivers as Long Beach, primarily because of the flat, repetitive nature of the circuit, its parking-lot location, and Las Vegas itself. It has been described as one of the worst circuits Formula One has ever visited.

The track was laid out in the parking lot of the Caesars Palace hotel and was set up for a temporary circuit. Wide enough for overtaking, it provided ample run-off areas filled with sand and had a surface that was as smooth as glass. Its counter-clockwise direction, however, put a tremendous strain on the drivers&#x27; necks. When Nelson Piquet clinched his first World Championship by finishing fifth in 1981, it took him 15 minutes to recover from heat exhaustion after barely making it to the finish. The 1982 race, held in intense heat—another unpleasant feature of this race—was won by Michele Alboreto in a Tyrrell, but that was the end of Formula One racing in Las Vegas, since the races had drawn only tiny crowds (the venue has been described as &quot;an impossibly tight and unedifying circuit that failed to excite drivers or fans&quot;) and the 1981 race made a huge loss for the hotel.

Following the withdrawal of Formula One, the event was assumed by the CART Indy car series for 1983 and 1984. The circuit was modified with turns 1, 6, and 10 connected in a continuous straight, producing a flat distorted oval. The two races were contested over 178 laps, a distance of . For the 1984 running, the exit of the final corner was widened, increasing lap speeds by around 7 mph from the previous year. Following the 1984 race, the circuit disappeared from the calendar, with the location now covered with urban development (namely, the Forum Shops at Caesars and the Mirage).

The first Las Vegas Formula One race since 1982 was the Las Vegas Grand Prix, running on a circuit through city streets including Las Vegas Boulevard (the Strip), as part of the 2023 World Championship.

<doc id="943717" wikidata="Q5326225" url="?curid=943717" title="Earl of Carysfort">
<text>Earl of Carysfort was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1789 for John Proby, 2nd Baron Carysfort. The Proby family descended from Sir Peter Proby, Lord Mayor of London in 1622. His great-great-grandson John Proby represented Huntingdonshire and Stamford in the House of Commons. His son and namesake John Proby was a Whig politician and notably served as a (civilian) Lord of the Admiralty. In 1752 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Carysfort, of Carysfort in the County of Wicklow. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He was also a politician and was created Earl of Carysfort in the Peerage of Ireland in 1789. In 1801 he was further honoured when he was made Baron Carysfort, of the Hundred of Norman Cross in the County of Huntingdon, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him a seat in the British House of Lords. His eldest son and heir apparent, William Proby, Lord Proby, predeceased him.

Lord Carysfort was therefore succeeded by his second son, the second Earl. He was a general in the Army. He died unmarried and was succeeded in 1855 by his younger brother Granville Leveson Proby, the third Earl. He was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy and finally became an admiral on 9 July 1857. On his death on 3 November 1868, the titles passed to his second but eldest surviving son, the fourth Earl. He was a Liberal politician and had served as Comptroller of the Household from 1859 to 1866. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of County Wicklow from 1890 to 1909. He was also childless and on his death in 1909 all the titles became extinct.

Lady Elizabeth Emma Proby, daughter of the third Earl, married Lord Claud Hamilton, grandson of John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn. Their son Colonel Douglas Hamilton inherited parts of the Proby estates, including Elton Hall in Huntingdonshire, and assumed by Royal licence the surname of Proby in lieu of Hamilton in 1904. His son Richard George Proby was created a Baronet, of Elton Hall in the County of Huntingdon, in 1952 (see Proby Baronets).

Hugh Proby, the third son of the third Earl, was the founder of Kanyaka Station in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia.

The heir apparent to the earldom used the invented courtesy title of &quot;Lord Proby&quot;.

<doc id="943723" wikidata="Q17055243" url="?curid=943723" title="1978 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1978 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to elect the 39th New Zealand Parliament. It saw the governing National Party, led by Robert Muldoon, retain office, but the opposition Labour Party won the largest share of the vote. Reorganisation of the enrolment system caused major problems with the electoral rolls, which left a legacy of unreliable information about voting levels in this election.

==Background==
The National Party had won a resounding victory in the 1975 elections, taking fifty-five of the eighty-seven seats and ousting the Labour Party from government. Labour had been led by Bill Rowling, who had assumed the post of Prime Minister on the death in office of the popular Norman Kirk. Labour won the remaining thirty-two seats in that election, with no other parties gaining entry to Parliament.

Labour&#x27;s Rowling had been criticised by many for inadequately countering Muldoon&#x27;s confrontational style, and was widely perceived as &quot;weak&quot;. Following Labour&#x27;s defeat, there had been speculation about replacing Rowling as leader of the party, but Rowling retained his position. Gradually, as some people wearied of Muldoon&#x27;s style, Rowling&#x27;s more reserved manner was held up as an asset rather than a weakness, and Labour began to gain a certain amount of traction again. Economic troubles hurt the government, and its reputation had fallen. Muldoon remained a powerful opponent, however, and was regarded as a strong campaigner.

Not long before the 1978 election, a by-election in Rangitikei caused considerable comment when it introduced a third party to Parliament: Bruce Beetham, leader of the Social Credit Party. Although other parties dismissed Social Credit&#x27;s success as a fluke, Beetham predicted a great future for the party.

===MPs retiring in 1978===
Five National MPs and three Labour MPs intended to retire at the end of the 38th Parliament.

Sir Stanley Whitehead MP for Nelson had announced he would retire at the end of the term in 1978, due to ill-health, but he died on 9 January 1976 triggering a by-election instead.

==Electoral changes==

===Problems===
In 1975 several reforms had been made to the electoral system. These included combining the re-enrolment process with the taking of the 1976 census and replacing existing Justice Department registrars with electorate officers appointed from Post Office Staff. They would work in conjunction with Statistics Department and Electoral Office staff, and at the same time, a switch would be made from a manual to a computerised system.

A report completed in 1979 found that there had been poor liaison between the various departments involved, staff shortages and problems with the computer system. However, the main problem arose from the decision to combine re-enrolment with the 1976 census. Many voters had been confused by the need to re-enrol only a year after the previous election, and many had not bothered to fill out their forms. Census staff had not been given the authority to insist on the card being completed.

To avoid disenfranchising a significant portion of the electorate, the Chief Electoral Officer decided just to carry forward many old voter registrations in the hope that duplications and outdated enrolments would be purged later. However, not enough staff were provided to complete that in time, and by the time that the rolls closed, 35,000 forms remained unprocessed.

It has been estimated that as many as 460,000 enrolments may have been outdated or duplicates. Many voters (even candidates) found themselves enrolled in the wrong electorate or off the roll completely, and others were enrolled in multiple electorates or several times in the same electorate. That means that accurate figures for electoral turnout are impossible to determine, and other figures may not be reliable.

===Electoral redistribution===
The 1977 electoral redistribution was the most overtly political since the Representation Commission had been established by an amendment to the &quot;Representation Act&quot; in 1886, initiated by Muldoon&#x27;s National Government. That a large number of people failed to fill out an electoral re-registration card had little practical effect for the electoral redistribution for people on the general roll, but it transferred Māori to the general roll if the card was not handed in. Together with a northward shift of New Zealand&#x27;s population, that resulted in five new electorates having to be created in the upper part of the North Island.

The electoral redistribution was very disruptive, and 22 electorates were abolished (see list below), and 27 electorates were newly created or re-established. In the North Island, fifteen electorates were newly created (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , and ) and six electorates were re-created (, , , , , and ). In the South Island, two electorates were newly created ( and ) and four electorates were re-created (, , , and ). The changes came into effect for the 1978 election.

==The election==
The election was held on 25 November. There were 2,489,510 people officially registered to vote in the elections, making the election the first one in which there were more than two million registered voters. However, the electoral roll in 1978 was significantly out of date and contained numerous duplicate entries. The cause of this confusion was a major redistribution of electoral boundaries, which had been implemented the year before. The actual number of potential voters is estimated to have been about 2,100,000, and actual turnout is estimated to have been about 80% (as compared to the official turnout of only 68.70%), slightly lower than the turnout for the previous election.

==Summary of results==
The 1978 election saw the National Party win fifty-one seats in parliament, a majority of several seats. This allowed it to retain power. The Labour Party won forty seats. The Social Credit Party retained the Rangitikei seat, which it had won in a by-election shortly before the election. No other parties won seats, and there were no successful independent candidates.

While National won a majority of seats in parliament, it did not actually win a majority of the vote. Labour received the highest number of votes, winning slightly more than forty percent. National, by contrast, won slightly less than forty percent. Social Credit, despite winning only one seat, actually received around sixteen percent of the vote. The election night result had National with more seats, but many seats had small majorities and it was conceivable that if special votes overturned enough electorates Labour could form a government. Ultimately this did not eventuate however.

While the electorate was initially won by Malcolm Douglas (Labour), the result was overturned by the High Court and Winston Peters (National) became the MP for Hunua.

&quot;Flounder&quot; arrived at Milne Bay, New Guinea, from New London, Connecticut, on 6 March 1944, and 11 days later sailed on her first war patrol, bound for the Palau Islands. Many planes were sighted, limiting her action, and few contacts were made. She returned to Milne Bay to refit, then sailed to Manus for training, and from that base took departure 3 June on her second war patrol. In the Philippine Sea during the assault on the Mariana Islands, &quot;Flounder&quot; made a sound contact on 17 June which resulted in her sinking the 2,681-ton transport &quot;Nipponkai Maru&quot;. Escorts immediately began a persistent, vigorous, but ineffective counter-attack. On 24 June, as &quot;Flounder&quot; sailed on the surface, two enemy planes suddenly dived out of the cloud cover, and dropped bombs which landed close aboard, causing some minor damage. The submarine topped off her fuel tanks at Manus 6 July, and sailed on to Brisbane, Australia, to refit.

==Third, fourth and fifth war patrols==

&quot;Flounder&quot; cleared Brisbane on her third war patrol 1 August 1944, and after calling at Manus on 8 and 9 August, sailed on to serve as lifeguard during strikes on the Philippine Islands. Once more, during the portion of her patrol devoted to aggressive patrol, she found few contacts, and was able to make only one attack. The intended target, a small escort, dodged her torpedoes, and drove her deep with depth charges. &quot;Flounder&quot; took on provisions and fuel at Mios Woendi, New Guinea, from 28 August to 1 September, then completed her patrol in Davao Gulf, returning to Brisbane on 4 October.

On her fourth war patrol, for which she sailed on 27 October 1944, &quot;Flounder&quot; patrolled the Java Sea with two other submarines, north of Lombok Strait on November 10. &quot;Flounder&quot; sighted what was first thought to be a small sailboat. Closer inspection revealed the target to be the conning tower of a submarine, and &quot;Flounder&quot; went to battle stations submerged. She sent four torpedoes away, observing one hit and feeling another as the target submarine exploded and was enveloped by smoke and flame. Coming back to periscope depth a half-hour later, &quot;Flounder&quot; found nothing in sight. She had sunk one of the German submarines operating in the Far East, . &quot;U-537&quot; was one of 10 German U-boats lost in Asian or East African waters during the war.

An attack by &quot;Flounder&quot;″s group on a convoy off Palawan on 21 November 1944 sank the freighter &quot;Gyosan Maru&quot; (5,698 tons), but other contacts were few, and the sub returned to Fremantle to refit between 13 December and 7 January 1945. Underway for her fifth war patrol, &quot;Flounder&quot; had to return to Fremantle from 12 to 14 January to repair her fathometer, then sailed to lead a three-submarine coordinated attack group in the South China Sea. On 12 and 13 February, her group made a determined chase after a Japanese task force, but was unable to close these fast targets. A more obliging target came her way on 22 February, when she launched four torpedoes at a patrol boat. Two of these, however, ran erratically, and only &quot;Flounder&quot;″s skillful maneuvering saved her from being hit by her own torpedoes. More trouble arrived three days later, when in a freak accident, she and brushed each other beneath the surface. Only a slight leak developed, which was quickly brought under control.

==Sixth war patrol, end of war and fate==

&quot;Flounder&quot; prepared for her sixth war patrol at Subic Bay from 26 February 1945 to 16 March. Again with a wolfpack, she scouted targets south of Hainan, and on 29 March contacted a large convoy, which was attacked by aircraft before she and her sisters could launch their torpedoes. She closed her war patrol at Saipan on 22 April and headed home for a stateside overhaul. Returning to Pearl Harbor action-bound on the day hostilities ended, &quot;Flounder&quot; was ordered to the East Coast, and arrived at New York City on 18 September. After laying immobilized at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and New London, Connecticut, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve at New London on 12 February 1947.

The second and fourth of &quot;Flounder&quot;″s six war patrols were designated &quot;Successful&quot;, and she is credited with having sunk 2,681 tons of Japanese shipping as well as &quot;U-537&quot;. &quot;Flounder&quot; received two battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="943727" wikidata="Q143004" url="?curid=943727" title="Sierra Leone at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Sierra Leone competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s eighth appearance at the Summer Olympics since its debut in the 1968 Summer Olympics. The Sierra Leone delegation included two track and field athletes; Lamin Tucker and Hawanatu Bangura, both of whom were sprinters that were selected via winning an event in Freetown, as the nation had no athletes that met the &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; standards in any event. Bangura was selected as flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Neither of the two athletes progressed beyond the heats.

==Background==
Sierra Leone participated in eight Summer Olympic games between its debut in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, with the exception of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, and the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, the latter because of a boycott relating to the New Zealand national rugby union team touring South Africa. 

The Sierra Leone National Olympic Committee (NOC) selected two athletes via wildcards. Usually, an NOC would be able to enter up to 3 qualified athletes in each individual event as long as each athlete met the &quot;A&quot; standard, or 1 athlete per event if they met the &quot;B&quot; standard. However, since Sierra Leone had no athletes that met either standard, they were allowed to select two athletes, one of each gender, as wildcards. The Sierra Leone NOC decided to host an event in Freetown, where the fastest man and woman in the event would be selected to compete at the Athens Games. The two athletes that won and therefore were selected to compete in the Athens games were Lamin Tucker and Hawanatu Bangura. They competed in the track and field Men&#x27;s 100 meters and in the Women&#x27;s 100 meters respectively. Bangura was flag bearer for the opening ceremony. 

==Athletics==

Making his Summer Olympic debut, Lamin Tucker qualified for the Athens Games via winning an event in Freetown. He competed on 21 August in the Men&#x27;s 100 meters against eight other athletes in the seventh heat. He finished the race in 10.72 seconds, ranking sixth. He ranked ahead of American Samoa&#x27;s Kelsey Nakanelua (11.25 seconds) and behind Canada&#x27;s Pierre Browne (10.32 seconds), in a heat led by Jamaica&#x27;s Asafa Powell (10.06 seconds). Overall, Tucker placed 61st out of the 84 athletes that competed and was 0.38 seconds slower than the slowest athlete that progressed to the next round. Therefore, that was the end of his competition. 
Competing at her first Summer Olympics, Hawanatu Bangura was notable for holding the Sierra Leone flag at the opening ceremony and for becoming the youngest ever competitor to represent Sierra Leone at the Olympics aged 16, a record that still stands today. She qualified for the Athens Games via winning an event in Freetown. She competed on 20 August in 100 meters in the seventh heat against seven other athletes. She ran a time of 12.11 seconds, finishing seventh. Bangura ranked ahead of Iraq&#x27;s Alaa Jassim (12.70 seconds) and behind Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Mae Koime (12.00 seconds), in a heat led by France&#x27;s Christine Arron and Ghana&#x27;s Vida Anim (11.14 seconds). Overall, Bangura was 0.68 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the quarter-finals and therefore she did not advance.

<doc id="943739" wikidata="Q143285" url="?curid=943739" title="Chad at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Chad competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. The country&#x27;s participation at Athens marked its tenth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its debut at the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, Japan. The delegation included two track and field athletes; Djikoloum Mobele in the men&#x27;s 100 metres and Kaltouma Nadjina in the women&#x27;s 400 metres. Both athletes participated at the Games through wild card places since they did not meet the required standards to qualify. Nadjina progressed past the first round of her competition, but was eliminated in the semi-finals.

==Background==
Chad participated in ten Summer Olympics between its debut in the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, Japan, and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. The only occasions in that period which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. On both occasions, it was because they had joined with international boycotts of the events. The first boycott was because of the inclusion of the New Zealand team at the Games despite the breach of the international sports boycott of South Africa by the nation&#x27;s rugby union team shortly prior. In 1980, Chad joined with the United States led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War.

As of 2004, the highest number of Chadians participating at any one Games was six at both the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, and at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Nor had any Chadian ever won a medal at an Olympics.

The Chadian team for the 2004 Athens Games featured sprinter Kaltouma Nadjina in the women&#x27;s 400 metres, who had previously competed for the nation at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Nadjina had trained in the United States and Canada, under an International Olympic Committee scholarship. But after refusing to move from Canada to Senegal following the 2000 Games, she lost her funding, and lived in a spare room of her coach John Cannon&#x27;s house in Vancouver. Prior to the 2004 Games, she had considered switching her allegiance from Chad to Canada.

==Athletics==

Chad was represented by one male athlete at the 2004 Games in athletics – Djikoloum Mobele in the 100 metres. He qualified for the 2004 Games through the use of a wildcard, since his season best time of 11.38 seconds for the 100 metres fell outside of the &quot;B&quot; qualifying standard of 10.28 seconds. He had been due to compete in the seventh heat, taking place on 21 August, however Mobele did not start the race.

The country&#x27;s sole female athlete at the 2004 Games was Kaltouma Nadjina in the 400 metres. Her season best time of 50.80 seconds fell within the &quot;A&quot; qualifying time of 51.50 seconds. At her previous appearance at the Olympics, she reached the semi-finals of the 400 metres. Her first run of the Games took place in the second heat on 21 August. She placed third out of the seven athletes, with a time of 51.50 seconds, behind Monique Hennagan of the United States (51.02 seconds) and Bulgaria&#x27;s Mariyana Dimitrova (51.29 seconds). Nadkina&#x27;s third-place finish qualified her for the semi-finals. The following round took place on the following day, with Nadkina competing in the second of the three heats. She finished in fifth place with a time of 51.57 seconds, failing to qualify for the final. The heat was won by Bahamas&#x27; Tonique Williams-Darling, with a time 1.57 seconds ahead of Nadkina.

<doc id="943741" wikidata="Q5326222" url="?curid=943741" title="Earl of Carhampton">
<text>Earl of Carhampton was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1785 for Simon Luttrell, 1st Viscount Carhampton. He had already been created Baron Irnham, of Luttrellstown in the County of Dublin, in 1768 and Viscount Carhampton, of Castlehaven in the County of Cork, in 1781, also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was the son of Henry Luttrell. His daughter Anne Horton married Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn (brother of then King George III). Lord Carhampton was succeeded by his eldest son, the second earl. He was a general in the British Army and served as the commander-in-chief of Ireland from 1796 to 1798. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third earl. He was a captain in the Royal Navy and also sat as Member of Parliament for Stockbridge. He married as his first wife the Honourable Elizabeth Olmius (died 1796), daughter of John Olmius, 1st Baron Waltham, and assumed in 1787 by royal licence the additional surname of Olmius. Lord Carhampton had no sons and the titles became extinct on his death in 1829. Already the same year George IV offered to revive the earldom in favour of Sir Simeon Stuart, 5th Baronet, son of Sir Simeon Stuart, 4th Baronet, and his wife Lady Frances Maria, daughter of the third earl. However, the offer was declined.

Carhampton is a village about one mile from Dunster, Somerset, Irnham Manor in Lincolnshire was an ancient seat of the Luttrells (1200-1410).

<doc id="943745" wikidata="Q14706556" url="?curid=943745" title="Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge">
<text>The Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge is a wildlife refuge in Genesee and Orleans counties in western New York. The refuge is located between the cities of Buffalo and Rochester and is operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

The refuge headquarters and visitor center are located at 1101 Casey Road in Alabama, New York. The Orleans County portion of the refuge lies in the town of Shelby.

==Fauna==
Mammalian species that inhabit this refuge include white-tailed deer, species of squirrel, porcupine, muskrat, raccoon, coyote, skunk, beaver, species of chipmunk, river otter, two species of fox, bobcat, mink, opossum and woodchuck.

== History ==
The refuge was created in 1958 as the Oak Orchard National Wildlife Refuge, however the name was soon changed to avoid confusion with the similarly named Oak Orchard Wildlife Management Area, a state-owned conservation area adjacent to the federal refuge at its eastern boundary. Both areas, along with the Tonawanda Wildlife Management Area, located on the western side of the federal land, are used not only as stopping points for waterfowl and other migratory birds, but also to provide habitat for a variety of other animals. All three areas constitute the Alabama Swamp Complex. Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service while Oak Orchard and Tonawanda Wildlife Management Areas are managed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

== Facilities ==
The refuge encompasses several large pools (separated by dikes), swamps, meadows, fields, and woodlands. There are four overlooks and four trails that are open throughout the year. All areas of the refuge, except the nature trails, overlooks, and fishing areas, are closed from March 1 to October 1 to protect nesting birds and other wildlife. Each year at least one of the large pools is drained to allow restoration of the wetland. The refuge has been designated as an important bird area (IBA) because it is a key resting spot for birds when they are migrating.

=== Structure ===
The western half of the refuge is divided into four large wetlands: Cayuga Pool, Mohawk Pool, Oneida Pool, and Seneca Pool. The Feeder Road, an unpaved north-south road, separates the Seneca and Cayuga pools from the other two. Cayuga Pool off of Route 77 has an observation platform in the parking lot. Kanyoo Trail, located nearby to the east, has two loops ( long). Feeder Road ( one way) is open to pedestrians year round.

The eastern half of the refuge contains a scattering of smaller pools, many marshy areas, fields, and upland forests. The Swallow Hollow Trail (a loop) is located at the eastern edge of the refuge on Knowlesville Road and circles Swallow Hollow Marsh. The Onondaga Trail ( one way) is located off Sour Springs Road and passes along the north side of Onondaga Pool into a mature woods.

== Geography ==
The wetlands are watered by Oak Orchard Creek.

New York State Route 63 is a north-south highway passing through the center of the refuge.

== Public use ==
Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge allows hiking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, nature observation, and photography. Non-motorized boats may be used on Oak Orchard Creek between Knowlesville Road and NY-63. Bicycles are permitted only on public roads within the refuge. Hunting, fishing and trapping are allowed in-season with the proper permits.

Prohibited activities include camping, disturbing historical artifacts, swimming, fires, removing wildlife and plants, horseback riding and off-road vehicle use, and carrying firearms except during hunting season (with permit).

The Iroquois Job Corps is located within Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge at 11780 Tibbets Road in Medina.

<text>Earl Mount Cashell, of Cashell, County Tipperary, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1781 for Stephen Moore, 2nd Viscount Mount Cashell, who had previously represented Lismore in the Irish House of Commons.

He was the eldest surviving son of Stephen Moore, member of the Irish Parliament for County Tipperary, who had been created Baron Kilworth, of Moore Park in the County of Cork, in 1764 and Viscount Mount Cashell, of the City of Cashell, in 1766. These titles were also in the Peerage of Ireland. The first Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He sat in the House of Lords as an elected Irish representative peer from 1815 to 1822. His eldest son, the third Earl, was an Irish Representative Peer from 1826 to 1883. He was succeeded by his elder son, the fourth Earl, who in his turn was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. The titles became extinct on the death of the sixth Earl in 1915.

Richard Moore (1725–1761), eldest son of the first Viscount, represented Clonmel in the Irish Parliament. The Hon. William Moore (died 1810), younger son of the first Viscount, represented Clogher, Clonmel and St Johnstown in the Irish Parliament. The family seats were Moore Park, County Cork, Galgorm Castle, County Antrim, and Mount Cashel Lodge, County Dublin.

<doc id="943747" wikidata="Q142709" url="?curid=943747" title="Solomon Islands at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>The Solomon Islands sent a delegation to compete at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s sixth appearance at a Summer Olympic Games since their debut in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The Solomon Islands sent two athletes to these games, both in track and field: Francis Manioru and Jenny Keni. Manioru competed in the men&#x27;s 100 meters and Keni in the women&#x27;s event of the same distance. Neither advanced out of their event&#x27;s heats.

==Background==
The National Olympic Committee of Solomon Islands was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 31 December 1982. The Athens Games were their sixth straight appearance in the Summer Olympic Games since their debut in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The Solomon Islands have never won a medal in Olympic competition. The 2004 Summer Olympics were held from 13 to 29 August 2004; a total of 10,625 athletes participated, representing 201 National Olympic Committees. The Solomon Islands sent two athletes to Athens, both in track and field: Francis Manioru and Jenny Keni. Manioru was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony.

==Athletics==
Francis Manioru was 22 at the time of the Athens Olympics, and was making his Olympic debut. In the first round of the men&#x27;s 100 meters, he was drawn into heat nine. He finished the race in 11.05 seconds, seventh place out of nine in his heat. However, only the top three from a heat and the ten next fastest overall from all ten heats were allowed to advance, and he was eliminated, the slowest qualifying time being 10.43 seconds. The gold medal was won by Justin Gatlin of the United States in a time of 9.85 seconds, silver was won by Francis Obikwelu of Portugal in 9.86 seconds, and bronze by Maurice Greene, also of the United States, in 9.87 seconds. Four years later, Manioru would represent the Solomon Islands at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Jenny Keni was 21 years old at the time of these Games, and had previously represented the Solomon Islands at the 2000 Summer Olympics. In the preliminary heats of the women&#x27;s 100 meters, she was drawn into heat five. She finished the race in 12.76 seconds, eighth and last in her heat, only the top three from a heat and the next eight fastest overall from all eight heats could advance; the slowest qualifying time was 11.45 seconds, and Keni was eliminated. The gold medal was won by Yulia Nestsiarenka of Belarus in a time of 10.93 seconds; the silver was taken by Lauryn Williams of the United States, and bronze was won by Veronica Campbell-Brown of Jamaica.

<doc id="943754" wikidata="Q7935729" url="?curid=943754" title="Viscount Clermont">
<text>Viscount Clermont, of Clermont in the County of Louth, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1776 for William Fortescue, 1st Baron Clermont, with special remainder in default of male issue of his own to his brother James Fortescue and the heirs male of his body.

He was the son of Thomas Fortescue (1683–1769), an Irish Member of Parliament and a descendant of the prominent and widespread family of Fortescue of Whympston in the parish of Modbury in Devon, England, the earliest Fortescue seat in the British Isles. Of the many branches of the Fortescue family which remained in Devon, that seated at Filleigh inherited in 1721 the ancient title Baron Clinton in the Peerage of England and subsequently obtained new titles in the Peerage of Great Britain of Baron Fortescue (1746), Earl Clinton (1746), Viscount Ebrington (1789) and Earl Fortescue (1789).

William Henry Fortescue had already been made [[Baron Clermont]], of Clermont in the County of Louth, in the Peerage of Ireland in 1770, with normal remainder to heirs male, and in 1776 was again made Baron Clermont, of Clermont in the County of Louth, in the Peerage of Ireland, at the same time he was granted the viscountcy, but with special remainder to his brother James Fortescue. By that date it was apparent that he was unlikely to produce his own son and heir, hence the special remainder was granted. In 1777 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Clermont, in the County of Louth, in the Peerage of Ireland, with normal remainder to heirs male. Lord Clermont died without male issue in 1806 when the barony of 1770 and earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony of 1776 and viscountcy according to the special remainder by his nephew William Fortescue, the 2nd Viscount Clermont and 2nd Baron Clermont, the son of his aforementioned brother James Fortescue. The 2nd Viscount Clermont represented County Louth in both the Irish and British Parliaments and was an Irish representative peer. He died unmarried in 1829 when the barony and viscountcy became extinct.

The Clermont title was revived in 1852 when Thomas Fortescue was made Baron Clermont. He was a descendant of Chichester Fortescue, brother of William Fortescue, grandfather of the first Earl of Clermont.

==Nomenclature==
William Henry Fortescue (1722–1806), the first holder of an Irish title using the name &quot;Clermont&quot; (the title Lord Clermont was used in the Peerage of Scotland), was a francophile with connections in the royal court of France, and it is believed for that reason adopted a French-sounding title, meaning literally &quot;clear mountain&quot;, and a common place name in France. Sir Nathaniel Wraxall wrote on this subject as follows in his memoirs: 
The very title of &quot;Clermont&quot; which he assumed when raised to the peerage — and which might be esteemed fictitious, as no such place I believe existed in Ireland — assimilated him to the blood royal of France; a younger branch of the illustrious line of Condé having been denominated &quot;Comtes de Clermont&quot;. Probably he was not oblivious of this fact, in his selection of the title.
However, his biographer and kinsman Lord Clermont (d.1887), countered this suggestion and stated: 
I cannot suppose that Lord Clermont was influenced by any such motive. The name, common among French towns, probably struck him as well-sounding, and he changed the appellation of one of his seats in Ireland to it, calling Reynoldstown &quot;Clermont Park&quot; and afterwards took his title from his residence. The fact of the name of Fortescue being made up of two French words may have suggested the idea of giving a French name to his estate.

However the same author had stated previously that the Earl&#x27;s father, Thomas Fortescue, had purchased an estate near Dromiskin in Ireland, named Randalstown, which he renamed &quot;Clermont Park&quot;. Clermont Park is an estate within County Louth and is near to Lurgangreen, Mooretown and Blackrock and Dromiskin. The mansion house was burned down by armed men in February 1923 when owned by Col. Charles Davis Guinness, county representative of the Irish Unionist Alliance, in one of the many politically motivated arson attacks at that period. An Industrial estate known as &quot;Clermont Business Park&quot; now occupies the site. Only the gatehouse survives, next to St Paul&#x27;s Church, Haynestown. A Neolithic chambered cairn dating from about 4000–3500 BC, survives atop Black Mountain in the Cooley Mountains in County Louth, in which was situated Fortescue&#x27;s estate, known in native Irish as &quot;Carnán Mhaighréid Náir&quot;, also known as &quot;Black Mountain Chambered Cairn&quot; and &quot;Clermont Cairn&quot;.

==Barons Clermont (1770)==
*William Henry Fortescue, 1st Baron Clermont (1722–1806) (created Viscount Clermont in 1776)

===Viscounts Clermont (1776)===
*William Henry Fortescue, 1st Viscount Clermont (1722–1806) (created Earl of Clermont in 1777)

===Earls of Clermont (1777)===
*William Henry Fortescue, 1st Earl of Clermont (1722–1806)

===Viscounts Clermont (1776; reverted)===
*William Charles Fortescue, 2nd Viscount Clermont (1764–1829)

==Jacobite creation==
In 1701, Charles Middleton, previously 2nd Earl of Middleton, was awarded the Jacobite peerages of Earl of Monmouth and Viscount Clermont in the Peerage of England. The titles, such as they were, became extinct on the death of his son in 1747.

<doc id="943760" wikidata="Q5214119" url="?curid=943760" title="Dan O'Connor (actor)">
<text>Daniel O&#x27;Connor is an Australian television actor and singer.

He was one of the top 12 finalists in the 2004 series of Network Ten&#x27;s reality talent contest programme &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, aired on Network Ten nationwide in Australia, finishing eleventh. He then launched an acting career, appearing as Ned Parker on the soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;.

==&quot;Australian Idol&quot;==
O&#x27;Connor auditioned for &quot;Australian Idol&quot; in Sydney. He auditioned with the church classic, &quot;I Surrender All&quot; written by Judson W. Van DeVenter. All 3 judges were thrilled by an impressive performance. Despite Dicko&#x27;s dislike of religious songs, he gave O&#x27;Connor a &#x27;yes&#x27; along with Mark and Marcia sending him into the top 100. Later, Dicko advised O&#x27;Connor to change to songs that would influence the &quot;world&quot; to vote for him.

During O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Top 30 performance, he performed &quot;Amazing&quot; by Josh Kelley. The judges were impressed by a fine performance and so were the voting public as he was voted into the Final 12. Also put through to the Final 12 from his group of ten, were Casey Donovan and Ricki-Lee Coulter.

During his &quot;Australian Idol&quot; journey, O&#x27;Connor showed an ability to work the crowd and to dress for the occasion. However, he was told on numerous occasions by Dicko that he did not have a superstar voice. O&#x27;Connor was eliminated from &quot;Australian Idol&quot; on 13 September 2004, placing him in 11th position.

==Acting==
O&#x27;Connor has appeared in the mobile soap opera, &quot;Random Place&quot; where he played the character of Bo Edwards. The series was viewed via mobile phones and provided a fly-on-the-wall view of the lives of five twenty-somethings sharing a house near Bondi Beach. This was Australia&#x27;s first mobile soap opera, a format which originated in the Netherlands.

O&#x27;Connor then took on a regular role as Ned Parker in the soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. In his three years in the show, his character had several relationships, was mistakenly believed to be homosexual, discovered he had a son, and survived a fire. In one particular scene, he was pictured half-naked with a towel around his waist. &quot;I actually thought I had to be completely naked,&quot; he explained when he was told he had to drop the towel. &quot;Ever since that scene, I&#x27;ve had a lot of people who want me to take my shirt off!&quot;&#x27;.

He did a cameo in Ricki-Lee Coulter&#x27;s Can&#x27;t Touch It music video in 2007, as a bartender and her love interest. He has also appeared on &quot;Ready Steady Cook&quot;, &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot; and &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest&quot; quiz show among other things. Having left Neighbours, he appeared in CelebAir, but was evicted in the 7th week.
In Autumn 2011 he appeared in BBC One&#x27;s Death in Paradise Episode 2.

In December 2011 it was announced that O&#x27;Connor had joined the cast of British soap opera &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; as Ally Gorman. He left the show in late 2012. 

O&#x27;Connor went on to star in Mr &amp; Mrs Murder as Brody Bennett in 2013 followed by Winners &amp; Losers in the same year in the role of Nate Simpson. His most recent acting role was in the film &quot;The Green Door&quot; which was released in May 2020 portraying the character Greg.

<text>Jorge González von Marées (4 April 1900 – 14 March 1962), also known as &quot;El Jefe&quot; (Spanish: &quot;The chief&quot;, analogous to the Führer) was a Chilean political figure and author who served two terms as a member of the Chamber of Deputies and as mayor of Ñuñoa.

Born in Santiago to Sofía von Marées Sommer, a German noble mother and niece of Hans von Marées, and Marcial González Azócar, physician and founder of &quot;Clínica Alemana&quot;. He studied in Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera, an elite public school back then, later studying Law and Engineering, the latter incomplete, in Universidad de Chile, Chile&#x27;s most prestigious public university. He was ideologically influenced by Oswald Spengler. On 5 April 1932 he founded the National Socialist Movement of Chile to oppose democratism, americanism, and communism.

González von Marées organized a failed coup d&#x27;état attempt on 5 September 1938, in which 60 young &quot;nacista&quot; members were shot to death by carabineros, in what became known as the Seguro Obrero massacre. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, but subsequently pardoned by president Pedro Aguirre Cerda. After this, he became leader of the far-right Popular Socialist Vanguard until 1943, when the Chilean Nazi movement disbanded due to the country cutting off all relations with Germany in World War II.

<text>Saint Kitts and Nevis took part in the 2004 Summer Olympics, which were held in Athens, Greece, from August 13 to 29. The country&#x27;s participation at Athens marked its third appearance at the Summer Olympics. The delegation included two track and field athletes: Kim Collins in the men&#x27;s 100 meters, and Tiandra Ponteen in the women&#x27;s 400 meters.

== Background ==
Saint Kitts and Nevis made its Olympic debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States sending 10 athletes. The 2004 summer games marked the nation&#x27;s third olympic appearance. Kim Collins, who competed in the men&#x27;s 100 meters, had previously competed in both the 1996 and 2000 Summer Games.

The Saint Kitts and Nevis Olympic Committee was first formed on May 27, 1986. The committee gained recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1993 at a session of the IOC in Monte Carlo, Monaco.

==Athletics==
Saint Kitts and Nevis was represented by one male and one female athlete at the 2004 Summer Olympics in athletics: Kim Collins in the men&#x27;s 100 meter run and Tiandra Ponteen in the women&#x27;s 400 meters run. This marked the third Olympic appearance for Collins and the first Olympic appearance for Ponteen.

Kim Collins was the only male athlete competing for Saint Kitts and Nevis at the 2004 Summer Olympics and competed in the men&#x27;s 100 meters. Collins finished sixth out of the eighty-two athletes that competed in the event. The medals in the event went to athletes from the United States and Portugal.

Tiandra Ponteen was the only female athlete competing for Saint Kitts and Nevis at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and competed in the women&#x27;s 400 meters.

<doc id="943775" wikidata="Q2024638" url="?curid=943775" title="German submarine U-537">
<text>German submarine &quot;U-537&quot; was a Type IXC/40 U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II. Her keel was laid down on 10 April 1942 by Deutsche Werft in Hamburg. She was commissioned on 27 January 1943 with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Peter Schrewe in command. Schrewe commanded the boat for nearly two years, until her loss.

&quot;U-537&quot; conducted three patrols and holds the distinction of making the only armed German landing in North America during World War II, when her crew installed the automatic Weather Station Kurt in Martin Bay, Labrador on 22 October 1943. She was then sent to the Far East. On 10 November 1944 in the Java Sea east of Surabaya, &quot;U-537&quot; was sunk with all hands—58 officers and men—by torpedoes from .

==Design==
German Type IXC/40 submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXCs. &quot;U-537&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-537&quot; was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a SK C/30 as well as a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.

==Service history==

===First patrol===
&quot;U-537&quot; left Kiel on 18 September 1943 and sailed to Bergen, Norway, departing from there on her first patrol on 30 September. She sailed across the North Atlantic, and on 22 October she set up &quot;Wetter-Funkgerät Land-26&quot; (code-named &quot;Kurt&quot;) automatic weather station in Martin Bay, Labrador. The weather station was only discovered by accident by Canadian authorities in 1981.

While on anti-shipping patrol off Newfoundland on 31 October, the U-boat was attacked by a Canadian Hudson aircraft from No. 11 Squadron RCAF, which fired eight rockets, all missing. On 10 November a Canadian Catalina aircraft from No. 5 Squadron RCAF attacked her with four depth charges off Cape Race. The U-boat escaped unharmed, but the next day another Catalina of 5 Squadron attacked with four depth charges which slightly damaged the submarine. Surface ships then joined the hunt, but all failed to locate her, and &quot;U-537&quot; arrived safely at Lorient on 8 December.

===Second patrol===
&quot;U-537&quot; sailed from Lorient on 25 March 1944 and traveled around Africa, and then crossed the Indian Ocean to Batavia, which she reached on 2 August after a voyage of 131 days.

===Third patrol===
&quot;U-537&quot; left Batavia for Surabaya in Indonesia on 1 October 1944, and began her third and final patrol on 9 November. On 10 November, she was spotted and sunk with all hands — 58 officers and men — in the Java Sea, at position , by torpedoes from in one of the few instances of an American submarine attacking a German vessel in WWII. &quot;U-537&quot; was one of 10 German U-boats lost in Asian or East African waters during the war.

<doc id="943783" wikidata="Q3248502" url="?curid=943783" title="List of international ice hockey competitions featuring NHL players">
<text>The following is a list of international ice hockey competitions where National Hockey League (NHL) players have been able to participate. Most of these competitions were arranged by the NHL or its union, the NHLPA. There have been 14 full international tournaments where it was possible for all NHL players to participate since the 1976 Canada Cup, dubbed as the first real World Championship. There are 5 Canada Cups, 3 World Cups of Hockey, 5 Winter Olympics, 1 Four Nations Face-Off tournament and many players have played in the annual IIHF World Championships.

== National team competitions ==
===Summit Series===

The Summit Series was an eight-game challenge series between the Soviet National Team and a Canadian professional team.

In the 1972 Summit Series, the Canadian team was made up of NHL hockey players. No World Hockey Association players were included in the event. Two years later, Canadian WHA players competed in the 1974 Summit Series and were defeated by the Soviets. No active NHL players participated in the series; there were however, some former NHLers that played for the WHA-composed Canadian team in the series.

===Canada Cup===

The Canada Cup tournament was a major international invitational competition for NHL players before the advent of the World Cup of Hockey.
===World Cup===

In 1996, the World Cup of Hockey replaced the Canada Cup.

===Olympics===

Between 1998 and 2014, the NHL had a break in the season to allow its players to participate in the Olympics. In 2024, the NHL, along with the National Hockey League Players Association and the International Ice Hockey Federation, have agreed to allow players to participate in the 2026 and 2030 Olympic Games after missing out in 2018 and 2022.

===IIHF World Championships===
Since 1976, there has been no limit to how many NHL players countries can send to the IIHF World Championships, but the tournament is usually played during the NHL playoffs. Because of the NHL lockout in 2004–05, all NHL players were available to participate in the 2005 Championship. However, many players did not participate because they had not played for a full season, and were therefore not in &quot;game shape.&quot;

===4 Nations Face-Off tournament===

In 2025, the NHL hosted the 4 Nations Face-Off in lieu of a typical NHL All-Star event. A total of seven games were played from February 12–20, with games being hosted in Montreal at Bell Centre, and in Boston at TD Garden. The countries participating in the tournament were Canada, Finland, Sweden and United States, and each team&#x27;s roster was entirely composed of NHL players, similar to the World Cup of Hockey.
== Other competitions ==
===Super Series===

The Super Series were exhibition games between Soviet teams and NHL teams that took place on each NHL opponents&#x27; home ice in North America from 1976 to 1991. The Soviet teams were usually club teams from the Soviet hockey league. The exception was in 1983, when the Soviet National Team represented the Soviet Union. Soviet teams won 14 series, NHL teams won 2 series, and 2 series were tied.

In the following summary the winner of a series is in bold.

===Challenge Cup 1979===

===Rendez-vous &#x27;87===

In 1987, two matches were held between the USSR and NHL All Stars in Quebec City, Canada in place of the annual &quot;NHL All Star Game&quot;. Each team won one game and the series was declared a tie.
===Ninety Nine All Stars Tour===

During the 1994–95 NHL lockout the Ninety Nine All Stars Tour was created by Wayne Gretzky and some of his personal friends, who formed a team and toured Europe. Playing in five countries, they played eight games against mainly European competition.

===NHL Challenge===

Between 2000 and 2003, a select few NHL teams traveled to Europe to play exhibition games against top division teams in the Swedish and Finnish leagues.

===Victoria Cup===

The Victoria Cup was an ice hockey tournament organized by the IIHF and intended for teams of the Champions Hockey League and the NHL. The inaugural Cup was a single game playoff between the 2008 IIHF European Champions Cup winners Metallurg Magnitogorsk and the New York Rangers of the NHL. It was held in Bern, Switzerland on 1 October 2008. The Rangers won 4-3.

The 2009 edition of the tournament featured the ZSC Lions, the 2008–09 Champions Hockey League winners, and the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL. The ZSC Lions defeated the Blackhawks 2-1 in the Hallenstadion in Zurich, Switzerland.

===KHL vs NHL games===

Teams of the former Soviet league did not play against NHL teams after the Super Series ended until 2008, when the 2008 Victoria Cup took place in Bern. In 2010 NHL teams played their first games on Russian and Latvian ice since 1990.

== List of national teams by titles won ==
This is a list of national teams that have won one or more international titles in competitions that included NHL or WHA players. As not all NHL players are eligible for the IIHF World Championships, those titles are not included in this table. This table also excludes results from the Super Series, as these matches were widely regarded as exhibition games.
