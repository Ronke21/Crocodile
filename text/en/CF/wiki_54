<text>Space warfare is combat in which one or more belligerents are in outer space. The scope of space warfare includes &quot;ground-to-space warfare&quot;, such as attacking satellites from the Earth; &quot;space-to-space warfare&quot;, such as satellites attacking satellites; and &quot;space-to-ground warfare&quot;, such as satellites attacking Earth-based targets. Space warfare in fiction is thus sub-genre and theme of science fiction, where it is portrayed with a range of realism and plausibility. In the real world, international treaties are in place that attempt to regulate conflicts in space and limit the installation of space weapon systems, especially nuclear weapons.

On October 31, 2023, during a Yemeni missile strike on Israel, Israel&#x27;s Arrow 2 system intercepted a ballistic missile launched from Yemen by Houthi rebels; this successful interception occurred outside of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere thus making it the first recorded practical instance of space warfare during an active conflict. On April 14, 2024, Iran launched more than 120 ballistic missiles at Israel, making it the first large-scale incident in which a space weapon was used.

From 1985 to 2002, there was a United States Space Command, which in 2002 merged with the United States Strategic Command, leaving the United States Space Force (formerly Air Force Space Command until 2019) as the primary American military space force. The Russian Space Force, established on August 10, 1992, which became an independent section of the Russian Armed Forces on June 1, 2001, was replaced by the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces starting December 1, 2011, but was reestablished as a component of the Russian Aerospace Forces on August 1, 2015. In 2019, India conducted a test of the ASAT missile; this made out the fourth country with that capability. In April of the same year, the Indian Armed Forces established the Defence Space Agency.

== History ==
=== 1950s ===
During the early Cold War, a survivable reconnaissance asset was considered highly valuable. In a time before satellites, this meant building an aircraft that could fly higher or faster, or both, compared to any interceptor that would try to bring it down. Notably, the United States would introduce the U-2 spy plane in 1956. It was thought, at the time of its introduction, that the plane’s service ceiling of would render it immune to Soviet aircraft, missiles, and radar. That was the case until the 1960 U-2 incident, where a United States U-2 spy plane was shot down by the Soviet Air Defense Forces’ S-75 Dvina (SA-2 Guideline) surface-to-air missile while conducting photographic aerial reconnaissance deep inside Soviet territory.

Three years before the incident, in 1957, a modified R-7 rocket carried the world&#x27;s first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into an orbit hundreds of kilometers above sea level, notably beyond the reach of any existing weapons system. While Sputnik 1 held no military value, only transmitting radio signals back to Earth for three weeks, its launch sparked the beginning of the Space Race. This spurred the United States to hasten and re-emphasize its space programs, culminating in the Explorer program, which launched the first American satellite into orbit in 1958. In tandem with the effort to achieve superior spaceflight capability over the other, the United States and the Soviet Union began to develop space warfare capabilities.

=== 1960s ===
Early efforts to conduct space warfare were directed at space-to-space warfare, as ground-to-space systems were considered to be too slow and too isolated by Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and gravity to be effective at the time. The history of active space warfare development goes back to the 1960s when the Soviet Union began the Almaz project, a project designed to give them the ability to do on-orbit inspections of satellites and destroy them if needed. Similar planning in the United States took the form of the Blue Gemini project, which consisted of modified Gemini capsules that would be able to deploy weapons and perform surveillance.

One early test of electronic space warfare, the so-called Starfish Prime test, took place in 1962 when the United States exploded a ground-launched nuclear weapon in space to test the effects of an electromagnetic pulse. The result was a deactivation of many then-orbiting satellites, both American and Soviet. The deleterious and unfocused effects of the EMP test led to the banning of nuclear weapons in space in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967. (See high-altitude nuclear explosion.)

In the early 1960s, the U.S. military produced a film called &quot;Space and National Security&quot; which depicted space warfare.

=== 1970s–1990s ===

Through the 1970s, the Soviet Union continued their project and test-fired a cannon to test space station defense. This was considered too dangerous to do with a crew on board, however, so the test was conducted after the crew had returned to Earth.

A 1976 Soviet report suggested that the design of the Space Shuttle had been guided by a requirement to deliver a payload- such as a bomb- over Russia and return to land after a single orbit. This may have been a confusion based on requirements 3A and 3B for the shuttle&#x27;s design, which required the craft to be able to deploy or retrieve an object from a polar orbit in a single pass.

Both the Soviets and the United States developed anti-satellite weaponry designed to shoot down satellites. While early efforts paralleled other space-to-space warfare concepts, the United States was able in the 1980s to develop ground-to-space laser anti-satellite weapons. None of these systems are known to be active today; however, a less powerful civilian version of the ground-to-space laser system is commonly used in the astronomical technique of adaptive optics.

In 1984, the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) was proposed. It was nicknamed &quot;Star Wars&quot; after the popular science fiction franchise Star Wars.

In 1985, the United States demonstrated its conventional ASAT capabilities by launching an ASM-135 ASAT from an F-15 to shoot down the Solwind P78-1, an American research satellite, from its orbit.

=== Since 2000 ===
The People&#x27;s Republic of China successfully tested (see 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test) a ballistic missile-launched anti-satellite weapon on January 11, 2007. This resulted in harsh criticism from the United States of America, Britain, and Japan.

The U.S. developed an interceptor missile, the SM-3, testing it by hitting ballistic test targets while they were in space. On February 21, 2008, the U.S. used an SM-3 missile to destroy a spy satellite, USA-193, while it was 247 kilometers (133 nautical miles) above the Pacific Ocean.

Japan fields the U.S.-made SM-3 missile, and there have been plans to base the land-based version in Romania and Vietnam.

In March 2019, India shot down a satellite orbiting in a low Earth orbit using an ASAT missile during an operation code named Mission Shakti, thus making its way to the list of space warfare nations, establishing the Defense Space Agency the following month, followed by its first-ever simulated space warfare exercise on July 25 which would inform a joint military space doctrine.

In July 2019, Emmanuel Macron &quot;called for a space high command to protect&quot; France&#x27;s satellites. This was followed by a plan released by military officials. French Defense Minister, Florence Parly, announced a space weapons program that would move the country&#x27;s space surveillance strategy towards active protection of its assets in space, e.g., satellites. The projects outlined include: patrolling nano-satellites swarms, ground-based laser systems to blind spying satellites, and machine guns mounted on satellites.

Starlink, SpaceX&#x27;s large low Earth orbit satellite constellation, was extensively used for warfare following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine after the country&#x27;s previous satcom provider Viasat were cyberattacked in the first few days of the invasion. Starlink was used for defense and attacks on Russian positions, with Starlink terminals being namely strapped on strike drones and sea drones. SpaceX vowed and acted against the use of their Starlink service for active warfare, while Russia launched cyberattacks against Starlink and threatened of striking Starlink satellites directly in retaliation.

On October 31, 2023, as part of the Israel–Hamas War, Israel intercepted a Houthi ballistic missile with its Arrow 2 missile defense system. According to Israeli officials, the interception occurred above Earth&#x27;s atmosphere above the Negev Desert, making it the first instance of space combat in history.

On November 21, 2024, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia launched a new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile, striking Dnipro. Ukraine&#x27;s air force initially claimed an intercontinental ballistic missile (range greater than 5,500 km) was used, and Ukrainian media initially reported it was an RS-26 Rubezh ICBM with range 5,800 km. The US and Russia confirmed it was intermediate-range (3,000–5,500 km), but the Pentagon stated it was based on the RS-26 ICBM. It was fired from the Astrakhan region 700 km away. Analysts stated the missile used a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV), likely marking their first use in combat. The night attack was reported to see six sequential vertical flashes, each comprising a cluster of up to six individual projectiles. UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric called the use of the intermediate-range weapon &quot;concerning and worrying&quot;.

== Theoretical space weaponry ==

=== Ballistic warfare ===

In the late 1970s and through the 1980s, the Soviet Union and the United States theorized, designed and in some cases tested a variety of weaponry designed for warfare in outer space. Space warfare was seen primarily as an extension of nuclear warfare, and many theoretical systems were based around the destruction or defense of ground and sea-based missiles. Space-based missiles were not attempted due to the Outer Space Treaty, which banned the use, testing or storage of nuclear weapons outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. When the U.S. gained &quot;interest in utilizing space-based lasers for ballistic missile defense&quot;, two facts emerged. One being that the ballistic missiles are fragile and two, chemical lasers project missile killing energy (3,000 kilometers). This meant that lasers could be put into space to intercept a ballistic missile.

Systems proposed ranged from measures as simple as ground and space-based anti-missiles to railguns, space based lasers, orbital mines and similar weaponry. Deployment of these systems was seriously considered in the mid-1980s under the banner of the Strategic Defense Initiative announced by Ronald Reagan in 1983, using the term &quot;evil empire&quot; to describe the Soviets (hence the popular nickname &quot;Star Wars&quot;). If the Cold War had continued, many of these systems could potentially have seen deployment: the United States developed working railguns, and a laser that could destroy missiles at range, though the power requirements, range, and firing cycles of both were impractical. Weapons like the space-based laser was rejected, not just by the government, but by universities, moral thinkers, and religious people because it would have increased the waging of the arms race and questioned the United States&#x27; role in the Cold War.

=== Electronic warfare ===
With the end of the Cold War and continued development of satellite and electronics technology, attention was focused on space as a supporting theatre for conventional warfare. Currently, military operations in space primarily concern either the vast tactical advantages of satellite-based surveillance, communications, and positioning systems or mechanisms used to deprive an opponent of said tactical advantages.

Accordingly, most space-borne proposals which would traditionally be considered &quot;weapons&quot; (a communications or reconnaissance satellite may be useful in warfare but isn&#x27;t generally classified as a weapon) are designed to jam, sabotage, and outright destroy enemy satellites, and conversely to protect friendly satellites against such attacks. To this end, the US (and presumably other countries) is researching groups of small, highly mobile satellites called &quot;microsats&quot; (about the size of a refrigerator) and &quot;picosats&quot; (approximately 1 cubic foot (≈27 litres) in volume) nimble enough to maneuver around and interact with other orbiting objects to repair, sabotage, hijack, or simply collide with them. 

=== Kinetic bombardment ===
Another theorized use involves the extension of conventional weaponry into orbit for deployment against ground targets. Though international treaties ban the deployment of nuclear missiles outside the atmosphere, other categories of weapons are largely unregulated. Traditional ground-based weapons are generally not useful in orbital environments, and few if any would survive re-entry even if they were, but as early as the 1950s, the United States has toyed with kinetic bombardment, i.e. orbiting magazines of non-explosive projectiles to be dropped onto hardened targets from low Earth orbit.Kinetic weapons have always been widespread in conventional warfare—bullets, arrows, swords, clubs, etc.—but the energy a projectile would gain while falling from orbit would make such a weapon rival all but the most powerful explosives. A direct hit would presumably destroy all but the most hardened targets without the need for nuclear weapons.

Such a system would involve a &#x27;spotter&#x27; satellite, which would identify targets from orbit with high-power sensors, and a nearby &#x27;magazine&#x27; satellite to de-orbit a long, needle-like tungsten dart onto it with a small rocket motor or dropping a large rock from orbit (such as an asteroid, cf. Ivan&#x27;s hammer). This would be more useful against a larger but less hardened target (such as a city). Though a common device in science fiction, there is no publicly available evidence that any such systems have actually been deployed by any nation.

=== Directed-energy weapons ===
Weapon systems that fall under this category include lasers, linear particle accelerators or particle-beam based weaponry, microwaves and plasma-based weaponry. Particle beams involve the acceleration of charged or neutral particles in a stream towards a target at extremely high velocities, the impact of which creates a reaction causing immense damage. Most of these weapons are theoretical or impractical to implement currently, aside from lasers which have been used to blind satellites and are starting to be used in terrestrial warfare. That said, directed-energy weapons are more practical and more effective in a vacuum (i.e. space) than in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, as in the atmosphere the particles of air interfere with and disperse the directed energy. Nazi Germany had a project for such a weapon, considered a wunderwaffe, the sun gun, which would have been an orbital concave mirror able to concentrate the sun&#x27;s energy on a ground target.

In the context of space-based deployment, directed-energy weapons can be distinguished as either “high-powered” or “dazzler.” High-powered satellite-operated lasers are intended to deal irreversible damage to the sensitive parts, mainly optics, on satellites and have the advantage of being difficult to attribute to an actor. Though, it is difficult to confirm the success of an attack. Dazzlers are not intended to deal irreversible damage but rather disable a target satellite. It maintains the same advantages and disadvantages as the high-powered variant. Though such systems not yet functional, the US Defense Intelligence Agency notes that several actors, including the United States, PRC, Russia, and France, are actively pursuing these capabilities.

== Practical considerations ==

Space warfare is likely to be done at far larger distances and speeds than combat on Earth. The vast distances pose big challenges for targeting and tracking, as even light requires a few seconds to cover hundreds of thousands of kilometers. For example, if trying to fire on a target at the distance of the Moon from the Earth, one sees the position of the target slightly more than a second earlier. Thus even a laser would need ~1.28 seconds, meaning a laser-based weapon system would need to lead a target&#x27;s apparent position by 1.28×2 = 2.56 seconds. A projectile from a railgun recently tested by the US Navy would take over 18 hours to cross that distance, if it travels in a straight line at a constant velocity of 5.8 km/s along its entire trajectory.

Three factors make engaging targets in space very difficult. First, the vast distances mean that an error of even a fraction of a degree in the firing solution can mean a miss by thousands of kilometers. Second, spaceflight involves tremendous speeds by terrestrial standards—a geostationary satellite moves at 3.07 km/s, and objects in low Earth orbit move at ~8 km/s. Third, though distances are huge, targets remain relatively small. The International Space Station, currently the largest artificial object in Earth orbit, measures slightly over 100m at its largest span. Other satellites can be vastly smaller, e.g., Quickbird measures only 3.04m. External ballistics for stationary terrestrial targets is enormously complicated—some of the earliest analog computers were used to calculate firing solutions for naval artillery, as the problems were already beyond manual solutions in any reasonable time—and targeting objects in space is far harder. And, though not a problem for orbital kinetic weapons, any directed energy weapon would need huge amounts of electricity. So far the most practical batteries are lithium, and the most practical means of generating electricity in space is photovoltaic modules, which are currently only up to 30% efficient, and fuel cells, which have limited fuel. Current technology might not be practical for powering effective lasers, particle beams, and railguns in space. In the context of the Strategic Defense Initiative, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States worked on a project for expandable space-based x-ray lasers powered by a nuclear explosion, Project Excalibur, a project canceled in 1992 for lack of results. SDI projects included Zenith Star, using the Alpha chemical laser.

General William L. Shelton has said that in order to protect against attacks, Space Situational Awareness is much more important than additional hardening or armoring of satellites. The Air Force Space Command has indicated that their defensive focus will be on &quot;Disaggregated Space Architectures&quot;.

===Space debris===
Anti-satellite attacks, especially ones with kinetic kill vehicles, can form space debris which can stay in orbit for many years and could interfere with future space activity or in a worst case trigger Kessler syndrome. In January 2007 China did a satellite knock out whose detonation alone caused more than 40,000 new chunks of debris with a diameter &gt; 1 cm and a sudden increase in the total amount of debris in orbit. The PRC is reported to be developing &quot;soft-kill&quot; techniques such as jamming and vision kills that do not generate much debris.

== Possible warfare over space ==

Most of the world&#x27;s communications systems rely heavily on the presence of satellites in orbit around Earth. Protecting these assets might seriously motivate nations dependent upon them to consider deploying more space-based weaponry, especially in conflicts involving advanced countries with access to space.

Since 2017, the United States Air Force has run an annual military exercise called &quot;Space Flag&quot; at Peterson Space Force Base, which involves a red team simulating attacks on U.S. satellites.

Robert Zubrin, aerospace engineer and advocate for human exploration of Mars, stated that anti-satellite weapons capabilities of nations increases, space infrastructures must be able to defend itself using other satellites that can destroy such weapons. Or else, he states, satellite-based navigation, communications and reconnaissance capabilities would be severely limited and easily influenced by adversaries.

=== Direct Ascent ===
The modern incarnations of the ASM-135 ASAT program are the so-called direct-ascent anti-satellite weapons. These weapons are usually either ballistic or anti-ballistic interceptor missiles, which ascend directly from Earth to intercept their target and have been adapted to the anti-satellite role. To date, four countries have demonstrated their ability to launch these weapons, the USA, the PRC, India, and Russia, but so far none have conducted such an attack on another country’s satellites.

Direct-ascent ASATs leverage existing technologies and launch platforms to neutralize both space-based and ground-based targets. This option tends to be highly destructive and indiscriminate as any attack will produce space debris, which can indiscriminately affect other satellites in similar orbits. While this option comes with the benefit of leveraging existing technologies and a certain element of surprise, as an attack cannot be detected until a missile has exited its silo, there are significant downsides. Firstly, there is the cost disparity of using an ICBM or ABM to kill a small and inexpensive satellite. Additionally, these missiles are not designed to send payloads out to geocentric orbit, as such they can only affect targets in low earth orbit and only in a target area centered around the static location of the missile itself.

=== Co-Orbital ===
Co-orbital systems come with a few potential kill mechanisms: in guided kinetic vehicles, like the Multiple Kill Vehicle, or in the form of a satellite that can release a kinetic interceptor or a cloud of debris. The first co-orbital system, Istrebitel Sputnikov, was developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and reportedly utilized one of these mechanisms.

There are allegations that Russia continues to test co-orbital ASAT weapons as recently as 2020. In 2020 the U.S. State Department claimed that a Russian satellite, Cosmos-2519, exhibited behavior “inconsistent” with its intended mission. While in orbit, Kosmos-2519 deployed a smaller satellite, which Russian state media claimed: “conducted autonomous flight, a change in orbit, and a satellite inspection before returning to the base station”. Another incident back in 2019 involved two Russian satellites, Kosmos 2542 and 2543, one of which appeared to begin following a U.S. national security satellite. Such “inspector” satellites can be armed with lasers to provide non-destructive interference or deadly kinetic interceptors.

While these co-orbital systems provide more utility when compared to more direct and destructive options, their advantages are contingent on being maneuverable and inconspicuous. Given the increasing paranoia surrounding co-orbital anti-satellite, it is hard to believe that the major players in space will fail to notice the deployment of “research” satellites.

== Space warfare in science fiction==

Space warfare is a staple of science fiction, where it is shown with a wide range of realism and plausibility. Fictional space warfare includes anticipated future technology and tactics, and fantasy- or history-based scenarios in a scifi setting. Some portray a space military as like an air force; others depict a more naval framework. Still others suggest forces more like space marine: highly mobile forces doing interplanetary and interstellar war but most of the conflict happens in terrestrial environments. The main sub-genres of the Space warfare in science fiction thematic genre are space opera, Military and Space Western. Though sword and planet stories like Finisterre universe by C. J. Cherryh might be considered, they rarely feature such technologies. These three genres often intertwine and have themes that are common to all. Written Space Westerns are often based directly on existing established scifi space opera franchises with expanded universes like Star Wars and Star Trek, including &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;: the most popular space opera military miniature wargame which spawned successful spin-off media: novels, video-games and on-going live adaption based on books by Dan Abnett.

Both kinetic and directed energy weapons are often seen, along with various military space vessels. E. E. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Lensman&quot; is an early example, which also inspired the term space opera due to the grandiose scale of the stories. Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; series is a notable example in that it makes a conjecture as to what sort of tactics and training would be needed for war in outer space. Other scifi authors have also delved into the tactics of space combat, such as David Weber in his &quot;Honorverse&quot; series, and Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle in their &quot;Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot; series. A more recent example is Alastair Reynolds&#x27; Revelation Space universe, which explores combat at relativistic speed. Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is perhaps one of the best-known and earliest explorations of the &quot;space marine&quot; idea.

Space-based vehicular combat is portrayed in many movies and video games, most notably &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Stargate, &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;Descent&quot;, &quot;Gundam&quot;, &quot;Macross&quot;, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Games such as the &quot;Homeworld&quot; series have interesting concepts for space warfare, such as 3D battle formations, plasma-based projectors that get their energy from a ship&#x27;s propulsion system, and automated uncrewed space combat vehicles. Other series, such as &quot;Gundam&quot;, prominently show vehicular combat in and among many near future concepts, such as O&#x27;Neill cylinders.

Fictional galaxies with space warfare are far too many to list, but popular examples include &quot;Star Trek&quot; (in all of its forms), &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot;, &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;Mass Effect&quot;, &quot;Freespace&quot; and many comic book franchises. Video games often touch the subject; the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; franchise is a prototypical example. Few games try to simulate realistic distance and speed, though &quot;Independence War&quot; and &quot;&quot; both do, as does the board game &quot;Attack Vector: Tactical&quot;.

Many authors have either used a galaxy-spanning fictional empire as background or written about the growth and/or decline of such an empire. Said empire&#x27;s capital is often a core world, such as a planet relatively close to a galaxy&#x27;s supermassive black hole. Characterization can vary wildly from malevolent forces attacking sympathetic victims to apathetic bureaucracies to more reasonable entities focused on social progress, and anywhere in between. Scifi writers generally posit some form of faster-than-light drive in order to facilitate interstellar war. Writers such as Larry Niven have developed plausible interplanetary conflict based on human colonization of the asteroid belt and outer planets via technologies using currently known physics.

<text>The Salian Franks, or Salians, sometimes referred to using the Latin word , were a Frankish people who lived in what was is now the Netherlands in the fourth century. They are only mentioned under this name in historical records relating to this one period, when they came into conflict with Roman forces led by Julian the Apostate in 358 AD, during the period when Julian ruled in Gaul as Caesar, under his cousin the emperor Constantius II. They are generally believed to be ancestral to the Franks who became the rulers of much of present day northern France in the 5th century - at first under the leadership of Chlodio, and later under the leadership of the Merovingian dynasty. 

Roman sources describing the events of 358 AD indicate that the Salians were a Frankish people who had entered the empire from across the Rhine some time earlier, and settled with Roman acceptance in Batavia, which is a large island in the Rhine delta that lay on the northern boundary of the Roman Empire. They had subsequently been settling in the relatively unpopulated and infertile area of Texandria, south of the delta, which was still considered to be under direct Roman control. They were also one of the tribes of this region who were being paid off by the Roman government to allow the safe passage of grain shipments up the Rhine, along with another people, the Chamavi. Julian, seeking to end the payments, entered the region with military force. After defeating both peoples and taking hostages he proclaimed new agreements with them, authorizing the Salians to keep any lands they had settled without fighting, but forcing many of the Chamavi to return to their homeland. He also obliged both peoples to contribute soldiers to the Roman military. Consistent with this, Julian is known to have created several military units named after the Salians.

Until the 1950s it was also generally accepted that the Salians expanded their territories and became one of two large divisions among the Franks in the fifth century, with another large group, the Ribuarian Franks, living to their east. This is not directly attested in the historical records, but the reasoning was based on the names of two distinct legal codes for the Franks ruled by the Merovingians. The older one, the so-called Salic Law () was valid in what is now France, and its name might be related to the name of the earlier Salians, although this is no longer considered certain. The later one, the , in contrast, is associated with the region near Cologne in what is now Germany. In the 21st century, scholars no longer generally accept that the term &quot;Salic&quot; in Salic law referred to any tribe by the 5th century, and some historians argue that it never did. It is also no longer widely accepted that the two Frankish legal codes imply two distinct Frankish peoples.

==Name==
Many etymologies for the word have been proposed, but the origins of the name remain uncertain. One of the challenges that the name is so short, which means there are many similar sounding words. When considering the possible etymologies, scholars are also confronted with questions about whether the word is related to much later terms including Frankish Salic law, the Frankish legal concept of (the demesne lands of the lord of the manor), the regional name Salland north of the river delta in the Netherlands, or the name of the river IJssel which flows through Salland.

The proposal of Norbert Wagner and is that the name has a Germanic etymology, related to such modern words as German , meaning a companion or journeyman. It is argued by Wagner that these terms are furthermore related to , meaning house or hall, because companions share accommodation. For scholars who accept such proposals the Salians in 358 AD may simply have been calling themselves a group of confederates or friends, and the much later Salic law may have had a meaning equivalent to &quot;civil law&quot;. Less widely accepted, Springer has even argued that the term in 358 AD was misunderstood by Roman authors, and was actually a Germanic term for the Franks in general.

Other possible etymologies include these:
*Based on the report of Zosimus that the Salians moved into the Roman Empire from somewhere north of the Rhine, older scholarship proposed that the name may have derived from the name of the IJssel river, formerly called &quot;Hisla&quot; or &quot;Isola&quot; in the oldest medieval documents.
*In contrast, another old proposal was that the Salians became a people only once they settled together on the island of Batavia, and that their name is therefore based upon an otherwise unknown Germanic word for &quot;island&quot;, meaning they were &quot;island dwellers&quot;.
*A connection has been proposed to words for &quot;salt&quot;, which are similar in many languages, possibly because the early Salians lived near saltwater. An argument against this is that the Salians, and the regions where they might have lived, including Salland and the Ijssel, were not near saltwater during the Roman era.
*It has also been proposed that the name is related to an Indo-European word for jumping or leaping, such as the Latin verb , from which is derived the similar name of an order of leaping priests of Mars in Rome, called the Salii. There is however no explanation about why this would be their name.

==The campaign of Julian in 358 AD==
Only Zosimus, who wrote around 500 AD, gives information about the Salians before 357 AD. He describes them as a people detached or separated from the Franks (), who had been expelled from their own country by the Saxons and settled at some time prior to 357 AD on the large island of Batavia, between two branches of the Rhine. Although Batavia was within the boundaries once governed by the Romans, the Salians were governing it by 357 AD. He describes the Saxons who forced them there as the strongest of all the barbarians dwelling near that Rhine delta region. A more contemporary source, Ammianus Marcellinus, also associated the Salians with the Franks, calling them Franks &quot;whom custom calls the &quot;Salii&quot;&quot;.
The Romans had inconsistent and incomplete control of the Rhine delta since the crisis of the third century. The population and agricultural activity had decreased dramatically, and the Romans had given it up as an area for normal taxation and governance. Some modern scholars believe the Salians attacked by Julian to be descendants of the Frankish who Constantius Chlorus allowed to remain in Batavia around 293-294 AD, when the Romans reasserted themselves there after the revolt of Carausius. These were probably also descended from the Franks who were later allowed to settle in Texandria by the brother of Constantius II, his co-emperor Constans, already in 342 AD, after fighting there in 341 AD. Julian also associated the usurper Magnentius, who had killed Constans and ruled the region in 350-353 AD, with the Franks and Saxons of this region. At the Battle of Mursa Major in 351 AD in present day Croatia many Roman soldiers with Frankish and Saxon backgrounds died fighting in this Roman civil war. Like Magnentius himself one of his main commanders Silvanus, who defected to Constantius, had Frankish ancestry. He was given the task of rebuilding defences in Gaul, but killed as a rebel in 355 AD. In the same year Julian was given the rank of Ceasar, and assigned to rule Gaul under his cousin Constantius, and rebuild the Rhine defences against the Franks and Saxons who Magnentius had apparently coordinated with.

Julian&#x27;s campaign against the Salians was at least partly triggered by a Roman concern with bringing grain shipments from Britain safely up the Rhine, without being impeded by the Salians and other Rhine delta peoples. Libanius (Oration 18.83) an orator who corresponded with Julian and wrote his funeral oration, emphasizes the problems caused by barbarians on the Rhine blocking such grain shipments. Both Libanius and Zosimus (3.5) reported that Julian, wanting to supply inland areas where cultivation had been ruined by other conflicts, built a fleet on the Rhine and began shipping grain up the river to Roman cities. In his letter to the Athenians Julian however complained of the disgrace that despite quick construction of a large fleet, the praetorian prefect Florentius sent to Gaul by Constantius II in 357, &quot;promised to pay the barbarians a fee of two thousand pounds weight of silver in return for a passage&quot;. Julian decided that this payment to the barbarians should not be made, and instead he marched against these barbarian tribes - specifically the Salians and Chamavi. His account of the campaign itself is compressed. &quot;I received the submission of part of the Salian tribe, and drove out the Chamavi and took many cattle and women and children. And I so terrified them all, and made them tremble at my approach that I immediately received hostages from them and secured a safe passage for my food supplies.&quot;

Another turn of events which triggered this campaign was the entry of the Chamavi into the Roman region south of the Rhine. According to Zosimus the barbarians of the delta region were losing all hope because of Julian&#x27;s policies on the Rhine, and they were expecting the complete destruction of everyone who still lived there. Apparently in reaction to this, the Saxons sent a faction of a Saxon people called the &quot;Quadi&quot; (by which he apparently meant the Chamavi), into the land held by the Romans. According to Zosimus, these &quot;Quadi&quot; (Chamavi) used boats on the Rhine to get around Frankish tribes who effectively protected the Roman frontier, and into the Roman river delta, where they expelled the Salians from Batavia and established a base for themselves. Ammianus simply says that the Salians dared to start building homes within Roman territory in Texandria, and that the Chamavi attempted to do something similar. Zosimus, in contrast, describes the Salians as friends of Rome who were forced by the Chamavi into these Roman territories. He claims that Julian gave instructions to attack the &quot;Quadi&quot; (Chamavi) speedily, but not to kill Salians, or to prevent them from entering Roman territory, because they had not come as enemies, but had been forced there. &quot;As soon as the Salii heard of the kindness of Julian, some of them went with their king into the Roman territory, and others fled to the extremity of their country, but all humbly committed their lives and fortunes to Caesar&#x27;s gracious protection&quot;, he wrote. 

Ammianus and Zosimus agree that in the winter of 357/8 AD, a deputation of the Salians came to the Roman city of Tongeren. However Ammianus portrays them not as supplicants but as offering their terms: as long as they remained quiet they should be treated as if they were in their own lands, and no one should harass or attack them. Julian gave the envoys gifts, dismissed them, and then sent his general Severus along the Maas river in order to attack these Salians suddenly &quot;like a thunderstorm&quot; (&quot;tamquam fulminis turbo&quot;, a whirlwind of lightning). According to Ammianus it is only then that the Salians were in the position of begging for mercy rather than offering peace terms. Ammianus wrote that Julian, with &quot;victory already assured&quot;, now &quot;inclined toward mercy and accepted their surrender&quot;. He took property and children as part of the surrender. Libanius (18.75-76) does not name the tribes involved but also describes this first lightning strike along the river (περὶ τὸν ποταμὸν ἀστράψας), and, consistent with Ammianus and Zosimus, &quot;he struck an entire nation with such terror that they deemed it better to relocate and become part of his kingdom, considering life under his rule more desirable than their own. They requested land, and they received it. He skilfully used barbarians against barbarians, as they found it far better to pursue the enemy alongside him than to flee with them&quot;. According to Libanius, Julian realized that he also needed to cross the river, and because he had no boats he forced his cavalry and infantry to swim. The people there were attacked but came as supplicants to Julian before their houses were all burnt down.

Following the conquest of the Salians, they assisted Julian against the Chamavi, together with the specialized guerrilla forces of Charietto who, according to Zosimus (3.6), were brought into the conflict because the Chamavi did not dare direct engagement with the Romans, and chose instead to make stealthy attacks into the Roman lands. Charietto&#x27;s approach worked, and he captured the son of the Chamavi king alive, and this was later revealed to the Chamavi king in the final negotiations which Julian conducted via translator while standing on a boat in the river.

The Salians were then brought into Roman units defending the empire from other Frankish raiders. The &quot;Notitia dignitatum&quot;, listing Roman military units at the end of the 4th century mentions the &quot;Salii iuniores Gallicani&quot; based in Hispania, the &quot;Salii seniores&quot; based in Gaul. There is also record of a &quot;numerus Saliorum&quot;. The names of these units does not mean that they were made up of Salians, but the units were created by Julian. Zosimus (3.8) writing around 500 AD says that &quot;Caesar stationed the Salians, a portion of the Quadi, and some of those on the island of Batavia in military units, which even in our time still seem to be preserved ().

In panegyric literature the Salians were only mentioned twice, but in both cases they were used as a trope and no specific events were described:
*In a poem from 400, Claudian celebrates Stilicho&#x27;s pacification of the near the Rhine using names of famous Rhineland peoples from history: &quot;The Salian now tills his fields, the Sygambrian beats his straight sword into a curved sickle&quot;. The Sugambri were defeated by the Romans and disappeared from the historical record centuries earlier.
*In 456 AD in a panegyric praising his father-in-law Avitus by saying he was better than various famous barbarian warriors, Sidonius Apollonaris wrote that the &quot;Heruli were outpaced in running, the Hun in the use of javelins, the Frank in the art of swimming, the Sarmatian in wielding a shield, the Salian in swiftness of foot, and the Geloni in handling the sickle sword&quot;. The Geloni, for example, had not been mentioned in historical records for centuries.

==Possible continuation==

From the first half of the fifth century onwards, a group of Franks pushed south west through the boundary of the Roman inhabited Silva Carbonaria and expanded their territory to the Somme in northern France. These Franks, headed by a Frankish king named Chlodio. He conquered an area which included &quot;Turnacum&quot; (the modern Belgian city of Tournai) and &quot;Cameracum&quot; (the modern French city of Cambrai). According to Lanting &amp; van der Plicht (2010), this probably happened in the period 445–450. Chlodio is never referred to as Salian, only Frankish, and his origins remain unclear. He is said by Gregory of Tours (II.9) to have launched his attack on Tournai through the Carbonaria Silva in present day Belgium, from a nearby fort on the other side of the forest named &quot;Dispargum&quot;. 

In 451, Chlodio&#x27;s opponent Flavius Aëtius, &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Western Roman Empire, called upon his Germanic allies on Roman soil to help fight off an invasion by Attila&#x27;s Huns. Franks answered the call and fought in the battle of the Catalaunian Fields in a temporary alliance with Romans and Visigoths, which temporarily ended the Hunnic threat to Western Europe.

While their relationship to Chlodio is uncertain, Childeric I and his son Clovis I, who gained control over Roman Gaul were said to be related to him. Their dynasty, the Merovingians, were named after Childeric&#x27;s father Merovech, whose birth was associated with supernatural elements. The earliest known legal code was called the Salic law and it applied to the Romance speaking country between the Loire and the Silva Carbonaria, a region the Franks later called Neustria. Childeric and Clovis were described as Kings of the Franks, and rulers of the Roman province of Belgica Secunda. Clovis became the absolute ruler of a Germanic kingdom of mixed Galloroman-Germanic population in 486. He consolidated his rule with victories over the Gallo-Romans and all the other Frankish tribes and established his capital in Paris. After he had defeated the Visigoths and the Alemanni, his sons drove the Visigoths to Spain and subdued the Burgundians, Alemanni and Thuringians. After 250 years of this dynasty, marked by internecine struggles, a gradual decline occurred. The position in society of the Merovingians was taken over by Carolingians, who came from a northern area around the river Meuse in what is now Belgium and the southern Netherlands.

In Gaul, a fusion of Roman and Germanic societies was occurring. During the period of Merovingian rule, the Franks began to adopt Christianity following the baptism of Clovis I in 496, an event that inaugurated the alliance between the Frankish kingdom and the Roman Catholic Church. Unlike their Gothic, Burgundic and Lombardic counterparts, who adopted Arianism, the Salians adopted Catholic Christianity early on; giving them a relationship with the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and their subjects in conquered territories.

The division of the Frankish kingdom among Clovis’s four sons (511) was an event that would repeat in Frankish history over more than four centuries. By then, the Salic Law had established the exclusive right to succession of male descendants. This principle turned out to be an exercise in interpretation, rather than the simple implementation of a new model of succession. No trace of an established practice of territorial division can be discovered among Germanic peoples other than the Franks.

The later Merovingian kings responsible for the conquest of Gaul are thought to have had Salian ancestry, because they applied so-called Salian law (&quot;Lex Salica&quot;) in their Roman-populated territories between the Loire and Silva Carbonaria, although they also clearly had connections with the Rhineland or Ripuarian Franks. The &quot;Lex Ripuaria&quot; originated about 630 and has been described as a later development of the Frankish laws known from &quot;Lex Salica&quot;. On the other hand, following the interpretation of Springer the &quot;Lex Salica&quot; may simply have meant something like &quot;Common Law&quot;.

==Culture==

Apart from some isolated fragments, there is no record of the Salian Frankish language but it is presumed to be ancestral to the modern family of Low Franconian dialects, which are represented today by Dutch and Flemish dialects, and Afrikaans. There are some early runic scripts been found in the Netherlands which might represent an early Frankish language, one of which is the Rune inscription of Bergakker. This inscription has led to much discussion among linguists. It is assumed that the inscription dates from around 425-450.

Before the Merovingian takeover, the Salian tribes apparently constituted a loose confederacy that only occasionally banded together, for example to negotiate with Roman authority. Each tribe consisted of extended family groups centered on a particularly renowned or noble family. The importance of the family bond was made clear by the Salic Law, which ordained that an individual had no right to protection if not part of a family.

While the Goths or the Vandals had been at least partly converted to Christianity since the mid-4th century, polytheistic beliefs are thought to have flourished among the Salian Franks until the conversion of Clovis to Catholicism shortly before or after 500, after which paganism diminished gradually. On the other hand it is possible many Salians in Gaul were already Arian Christians, like contemporary Germanic kingdoms.

<doc id="956984" wikidata="Q316860" url="?curid=956984" title="Ripuarian Franks">
<text>The Rhinelandor Ripuarian Franks were the Franks who established themselves in and around the formally Roman city of Cologne, on the Rhine river in what is now Germany. They are also often referred to using the Latin plurals Ribuarii, or Ripuarii. (A single Ripuarian would be a .)

Until the 1950s the Ribuarii were seen as the easternmost of two distinct &quot;sub tribes&quot; of the Franks who ruled two large neighbouring regions in northern Gaul after the collapse of the Roman empire in the fifth century AD. According to this tradition, which continues to be influential, the Ribuarii ruled not just the Rhineland area near Cologne, but all or most of what would later become the Austrasian or Lotharingian region – stretching from present day southern Belgium to the Rhine in present day Germany and the Netherlands. Their western counterparts in this scenario are the , or &quot;Salian Franks&quot;, who took control of what is now northern France. This traditional vision of two very large tribes of Franks with large territories is based mainly on two 7th century Frankish legal codes, the and . These laws had different geographical jurisdictions, and it was believed that the boundary between them was in the Ardennes and Silva Carbonaria in what is now southern Belgium. 

Since the 1950s the term Ripuarian is no longer seen as having its origins as a tribal name, even if it eventually became the name for a specific population based in Cologne. There has also been ongoing scholarly debate about when and how the term Ripuarian was, if ever, applied to the much larger Austrasian region as opposed to the much smaller region around Cologne. The itself is now seen mainly as a law code of the Cologne Rhineland covering such neighbouring towns as Bonn, Zülpich, Jülich and Neuss.

==History of the term &quot;Ripuarii&quot;==
Before the there is a possible mention of the in the 6th-century Byzantine writer Jordanes. In his account of the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451 AD he referred to the among the units fighting as auxiliaries under the Roman Aetius, against Attila. They are listed together with forces with ethnic designations including Franks, Sarmatians, Armoricans, Burgundians, Saxons. Eugen Ewig has argued that these are not from Cologne, but rather a military unit mentioned in the , who based on the Rhône river in what is now southern France. Springer however argues against this interpretation, noting that at least three of the four units were naval units, the , the , and the .

The legal code itself is generally seen as having been made in the 7th century, although it has been argued for example by Springer that it may have been made as late as the early 8th century. It was probably made in the context of the establishment of an Austrasian sub-kingdom by the Merovingians in 623 or 633 AD, possibly as part of a reorganization of the border defence of this kingdom on the Rhine. The Ribuarian area was referred to in Latin using different terms, , , and and it included the areas around Cologne, Bonn, the Eifel, Zülpich, Jülich, and Neuss. It has been argued that the legal code reveals a deliberate process of &quot;ethnic engineering&quot;, aiming to create a Romano-Frankish mixed civilization. According to Springer only the younger manuscripts of the Ribuarian Law Book refer to it as , named after a people, instead of , named after a country.

Apart from the 7th-century legal code, the earliest narrative source definitely containing a form of the word for the people of Cologne is the &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot;, which was completed about 726/27 AD. The author uses the term to describe the land () around Cologne which were devastated in 612 AD by the Merovingian king Theuderic II, who defeated his brother Theudebert II at Zülpich and then pursued him to Cologne. After his victory there the author says that the king claimed that one of the &quot;Ribuarians&quot; () in Cologne shot at him. The word was therefore spelled with a &quot;b&quot; at this time and used both as an adjective and a noun, referring to the both the region of Cologne, and its inhabitants.

Since the 1950s it has been widely accepted that the plural or , referring to Franks from the Cologne region, did not originate as the name of any Germanic tribe who moved in the so-called Migration period before the 7th century. Instead the name seems to have been connected to the region they moved to. A traditional explanation for the first part of the word comes from Latin meaning a seashore or riverbank, which is believed to refer in this case to the river Rhine, which runs past Cologne. This explanation remains popular although there is ongoing debate among scholars, both about whether the name is purely derived from Latin, and about whether the name was really intended to refer to the Rhine riverbank. 

Latin formations such as , , and would all be possible Latin-derived words describing a person of the riverbank, but purely Latin explanations of the word are generally avoided among scholars because the second part of the name seems the same as the once found in several other Germanic tribal names such as the Ampsivarii, Chasuarii, and Angrivarii. This suffix is normally believed to come not originally from Latin, but from a Germanic suffix meaning inhabitants. A version of this suffix is for example found in Old English, in words like , meaning inhabitants of Rome.

The earliest spelling of the word uses a b instead of the p which would be expected in classical Latin, and later spellings show that the word was being pronounced by Germanic speakers with a w-like sound. Springer argued that this is evidence that the word came from Gallo-Romance, the Latin-derived language from which modern French derives, where such changes from p to b were normal in this period. According to this account, Germanic speakers in the Cologne area pronounced the b as a w-like voiced bilabial fricative β. Frank, in contrast, notes that the move from p to b could also be explained as a typical sound change which happened among Germanic speakers in this time, but accepts that the word could have had a Gallo-Romance origin.

Springer also questioned whether the word derived directly from the word from a river bank, noting that in various parts of the late Roman empire the word was used to refer to people with military or policing functions. Although the term is presumed to have derived originally from the word for a riverbank, because of the connection of these people to border regions, Springer and others note that well before the end of the Roman Empire it became a word for certain policing units, perhaps connected to toll collection, and the word was no longer always connected to rivers. Springer proposes therefore that the people of Cologne owed their special name to a unit of Roman border police who had been posted there before the Franks took over.

An example of the terms being used to refer to a larger area is known from the 9th century. The &quot;Annals of Xanten&quot; referred to King Lothar II (855-869) as king of the Ripuarians, or of Ripuaria ( and ). His short-lived kingdom was a new construction similar to Austrasia, is today normally known as Lotharingia. Similarly, in the 11th century, when the term was becoming more unusual, Wipo of Burgundy called the Lower Lotharingians and their duke .

==Kingdom of Cologne==
The Frankish kingdom of Cologne lost its independence almost as soon as it entered the historical record, being subsumed in the Frankish core province of Austrasia. Apart from Roman military lists and mention by Jordanes in &quot;Getica&quot; of some unknown Ripuarii who fought as auxiliaries of Flavius Aetius in the Battle of Chalons in 451, the first mention of the Cologne kingdom comes from Gregory of Tours, in &quot;Historia Francorum&quot;. He says that the Salian Frank Clovis, first king of all the Franks and first king to convert to Christianity, subjected the previously Franks from the Cologne region. 

Without naming the people as Ripuarian, but referring to Cologne and its vicinity, Gregory of Tours explains how they voluntarily gave up their sovereignty to Clovis. The region of Cologne was under the rule of Sigobert the Lame, an old campaigner who had fought side by side with Clovis in the wars against the Alamanni. He was called &quot;the lame&quot; because of a wound he had received at the Battle of Tolbiac, 496, the same year as Clovis&#x27; conversion to Catholicism. Clovis believed he had won by calling on the name of Christ and now had a mandate from God to Christianize all Neustria. This was a long process not free from resistance.

In 509 he sent a messenger to Chloderic to state that if his father, Sigobert, were to die, he, Clovis, would ally himself to Chloderic. Whatever Clovis may have meant, as Sigobert was sleeping at noon in his tent in the forest across the Rhine from Cologne after a walk, Chloderic&#x27;s hired assassins killed him. Chloderic sent to Clovis offering some of Sigobert&#x27;s treasury as enticement. Clovis sent messengers refusing the treasure but asked to see it. Complying with their request to sink his arms into it so that they could see how deep it was, Chloderic was dispatched by the blow of an axe, unable to defend himself.

Arriving in person Clovis assembled the citizens of Cologne, denied the murders, saying &quot;It is not for me to shed the blood of one of my fellow kings, for that is a crime …&quot; He advised them to place themselves under his protection, after which he was shouted into office by a voice vote and raised up on their shields in a ceremony of installation. Thus the independent kingdom of the Cologne Franks was voted out of existence by the people at a single assembly in 509.

==Language==

There are no direct attestations of the early Frankish language. Of some 1,400 Latin inscriptions in Roman Germania Inferior a little over 100 are from the rural lands of the Germanic Ubii, into whose lands the Ripuarii would move. The inscriptions are most frequent in the 3rd century. Most are from the major cities of Germania Inferior. The right bank of the Rhine, where the Ripuarii originated, does not have such a wealth of Latin inscriptions. The High German consonant shift occurred south of an east-west zone called the Benrath Line. The Rhine crosses it in the vicinity of Düsseldorf. The section of the Rhine including Cologne forms the so-called &quot;Rhenish Fan&quot;, where dialects are found which form intermediate stages between Dutch and High German.

==Ripuarian laws==

In the first half of the 7th century the Ripuarians received the Ripuarian law (Lex Ripuaria), a law code applying only to them, from the dominating Salian Franks. The Salians, following the custom of the Romans before them, were mainly re-authorizing laws already in use by the Ripuarians, so that the latter could retain their local constitution.

In addition to working as an attorney, Yates also played semiprofessional basketball in the 1930s. He gained his initial experience in government as an attorney for the state bank receiver (1935–1937), and an assistant state attorney general specializing in traction railroads for the Illinois Commerce Commission (1937–1940). During World War II, Yates served in the United States Navy for two years (1944–1946) as an attorney based in Washington, D.C.

In 1948, Yates was elected to Congress, and he served from 1949 to 1963. After an unsuccessful run against Everett Dirksen for the United States Senate in 1962, in 1964 Yates was again elected to the House. He served from 1965 to 1999, and did not run for reelection in 1998. He was a longtime member of the House Appropriations Committee, where he became known for staunch U.S. support of Israel, and federal funding for parks, historical conservation, and the arts. Yates was also an advocate for several liberal causes, including opposition to discrimination based on age. At the time he concluded his service, he was third oldest person to ever serve in the House (age 89) behind Charles Manly Stedman and Isaac R. Sherwood, and one of the longest-tenured members in the history of Congress (total House service of 48 years).

Yates died in Washington in 2000. He was buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Skokie, Illinois.

==Early life==
Yates was born in Chicago, Illinois, the youngest of six children of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants Louis and Ida Yates. He grew up in Chicago and was an office boy at &quot;Variety&quot; Chicago office during the 1920s. He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1931 with a Bachelor of Philosophy degree and received a Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago Law School in 1933. While in college, Yates joined the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. He also played basketball, and was selected for All Big Ten honors. In the mid-1930s, he played semiprofessional basketball and practiced law. Yates was an attorney for the Illinois state bank receiver from 1935 to 1937. From 1937 to 1940 he was an assistant state attorney general attached to the Illinois Commerce Commission as a traction attorney. He served in the United States Navy during World War II, assigned as an attorney for the Bureau of Ships in Washington, DC.

==Career in Congress==
From 1949 to 1963 and 1965 to 1999, Yates served in the House of Representatives as a Democrat. Although the boundaries of his district changed over the years, it was always anchored in the Chicago lakefront. From the 1970s onward, Chicago&#x27;s declining population resulted in the district spilling into the northern suburbs. By the time he retired, his district also included Evanston, Des Plaines, Glenview, Rosemont and Skokie.

Yates was one of the first congressmen to speak out against age discrimination, arguing in 1951 that mandatory retirement of workers was wrong and deprived older people of their &quot;right to lead a proud, productive and independent life.&quot;

During the late 1950s, after a series of lurid magazine articles and Hollywood films helped to sensationalize youth gangs and violence, Yates called for legislation to ban automatic-opening or switchblade knives, melodramatically proclaiming that &quot;Vicious fantasies of omnipotence, idolatry...barbaric and sadistic atrocities, and monstrous violations of accepted values spring from the cult of the weapon, and the switchblade knife is included in this. Minus switchblade knives and the distorted feeling of power they beget—power that is swaggering, reckless, and itching to express itself in violence—our delinquent adolescents would be shorn of one of their most potent means of incitement to crime.&quot; The ban on switchblade knives was eventually enacted into law as the Switchblade Knife Act of 1958. Rep. Yates and other congressmen supporting the Switchblade Knife Act believed that by stopping the importation and interstate sales of automatic knives (effectively halting sales of new switchblades), the law would reduce youth gang violence by blocking access to what had become a symbolic weapon. However, while switchblade imports, domestic production, and sales to lawful owners soon ended, later legislative research demonstrated that youth gang violence rates had in fact rapidly increased, as gang members began using firearms instead of knives.

Yates was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate in 1962 against Republican incumbent and Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen. He briefly served at the United Nations before returning to the House after the 1964 election. Fellow Democrat Edward Finnegan won Yates&#x27; old seat after his former district was merged with the 9th, but Chicago machine bosses persuaded him to accept a circuit judgeship in return for letting Yates take his old seat back. Yates served on the Appropriations Committee throughout his career and chaired the Interior Subcommittee from 1975 to 1995. On this committee he supported environmental programs and the National Endowment for the Arts.

Yates remained on good terms with both liberal reformers and machine politicians in Chicago throughout his career. He also served on the Foreign Operations subcommittee and was a strong advocate of American support for Israel. He worked hand-in-hand with his chief of staff, Mary Bain, to preserve federal funding for the arts and for Natural Heritage Preservation programs, and to establish the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

In 1993, he was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Clinton and in 1997 he received the Four Freedoms Award for Freedom of Speech In 1999, the Auditors Building in Washington, DC, was renamed the Sidney Yates Building in his honor.

He is the longest-serving member ever of the United States House of Representatives from the state of Illinois. He holds the record as the 10th longest-serving member in the history of the US Congress, and also has the longest tenure of all members whose time in Congress included a break in service.

==Death and burial==
Yates died in Washington, D.C., on October 5, 2000. He was buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Skokie, Illinois.

==Family==
Yates was married to Adeline Holleb (1914–2002) for 65 years. They were the parents of Stephen R. Yates (1940–2000), who served as an Illinois circuit court judge.

His brother Charles was a talent agent for Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Martha Raye.

<doc id="956994" wikidata="Q2190650" url="?curid=956994" title="The Skydivers">
<text>The Skydivers is a 1963 American crime film produced by Anthony Cardoza, and written and directed by Coleman Francis. It stars actors Kevin Casey, Eric Tomlin, Cardoza and Marcia Knight, with a performance by influential guitarist Jimmy Bryant.

After falling into obscurity for three decades, the film found second life in 1994, serving the basis for a &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; episode (during which TV&#x27;s Frank describes it as like &quot;&quot;&quot; without the lucid plot&quot;).

==Plot==
Harry and Beth Rowe run a small skydiving facility in an unnamed desert town. One day, a woman named Suzy Belmont comes around claiming to be looking for the Rowes&#x27; plane mechanic Frankie Bonner. Beth claims that Frankie was fired for being drunk on the job, but feels that Suzy didn&#x27;t come down just to see Frankie. As she walks away, Beth can&#x27;t help but feel that her husband is having an affair with this floozy. It turns out that Harry is, but is still keeping it a secret from his wife. One evening, they receive a letter from Harry&#x27;s friend, Joe Moss. Joe wants to visit and is looking for a job. Beth comments that Joe could easily fill Frankie&#x27;s position and Harry consents.

Soon after, Frankie returns to the skydiving school, but Harry catches him trying to sabotage a plane and accosts him. Frankie demands that Harry stay away from Suzy. Harry agrees but warns that he&#x27;ll break both of Frankie&#x27;s legs if he ever returns to the facility. Joe Moss eventually arrives and Harry and Beth greet him warmly. Joe is just in time to witness an eager young man, Pete, propose to do a dangerous skydiving stunt. Harry warns that the FAA could come down on them for that, but Pete is determined to prove he can do it. He starts out fine, but before he can pull his chute he panics and plummets to the ground. The FAA does get involved; it shuts down the Rowes&#x27; skydiving facility. Harry drives into town and has a beer at a local bar. He finds Suzy outside and fights off her advances before leaving her in the parking lot fuming.

Incensed at Harry, Suzy plots revenge by convincing love-struck Frankie to help her put acid in Harry&#x27;s parachute. An unsure Frankie gingerly agrees. Eventually, the facility reopens, and numerous people come out to see the skydivers. Trouble brews when Harry thinks Beth and Joe are having an affair; Harry even confronts Joe. Harry and Beth soon make up and Joe backs off. They plan a night jump and a pre-jump party. During the party Suzy and Frankie sneak into the hangar and pour acid on Harry&#x27;s parachute. The party is lively, but the evening ends in tragedy when Harry&#x27;s chute rips and he plummets to the ground to his death.

A witness reports seeing Suzy and Frankie running away from the preparations room. Joe gets into his car and soon catches up to them. However, some men from the FAA give chase in a plane and in a car. In spite of the lack of any direct evidence that they were responsible, and no legal proceedings, the two are immediately gunned down without warning by the authorities as they drive away from the facility.

In the aftermath, Joe takes his leave of Beth, who is giving up running the skydiving facility. As Joe drives away, Beth takes her own leave of the facility.

==Critical response==
A review of the film on DVD Talk described it as &quot;an incomprehensible soap opera of &#x27;he&#x27;s-cheating-on-her-but-she&#x27;s-cheating-on-him&#x27; back and forth nonsense, done with a cast of characters who are about as colorful as the film&#x27;s black-and-white photography,&quot; additionally noting that &quot;there&#x27;s also skydiving, probably included in the hopes that the stunts would make the movie in any way interesting to watch. No dice.&quot;

== Home media ==
* The &quot;MST3K&quot; version of the film (accompanied by the uncut version, included as a bonus feature) was released by Rhino Home Video as part of the &quot;Collection, Volume 1&quot; DVD set. It was soon re-released by Shout Factory on September 1, 2015.

<text>The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) is the governing body for high school sports in the U.S. state of California. CIF membership includes both public and private high schools. Unlike most other state organizations, it does not have single, statewide championships for all sports; instead, for some sports, the CIF&#x27;s 10 Sections each have their own championships.

Six schools near the state border are members of adjacent state&#x27;s associations. San Pasqual Valley High School is part of the Arizona Interscholastic Association. Coleville High School, Needles High School, North Tahoe High School, South Tahoe High School and Truckee High School are part of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association.

==History==
As early as 1891, schools around the San Francisco Bay Area began competing against each other in football organized by the Amateur Academic Athletic Association. Other boys sports were added starting in 1894, organized by the Academic Athletic League. While teams represented the schools by name, there was no affiliation with the school administration.

The CIF was founded in Los Angeles in 1914 by a group of area school principals. It was founded in order to standardize rules and team structures between schools; it was also intended to prevent abuses such as &quot;school shopping&quot; by athletes and teams fielding players over high school age. Other school principals voluntarily entered into the program, and by 1917, the organization was established statewide.

In 2005, CIF began requiring that all student athletes sign a pledge not to take any steroids or face suspension or expulsion. This action was the first of its kind from a statewide high school athletics association in the United States.

==Championships==
CIF holds state and regional championships in:
* badminton
* boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; basketball; California high school basketball championship
* boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; tennis
* boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; cross country
* football; List of California state high school football champions
* boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; golf
* boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; swimming and diving
* boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; soccer
* boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; track and field; the CIF California State Meet
* boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; tennis
* boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; volleyball
* boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; water polo
* boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; wrestling
CIF also hosts a State Cheerleading Championship in conjunction with the football championship.

Individual CIF sections also conduct championships in other sports, including:
* field hockey
* boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; lacrosse
* roller hockey

In sports where a school has separate boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; teams, girls are not allowed on boys&#x27; teams, and boys are not allowed on girls&#x27; teams. (In sports such as baseball that do not have girls&#x27; teams, girls are allowed to play; on the other hand, in sports such as softball that do not have boys&#x27; teams, in most cases boys are not allowed to play.)

==Participants==
In the 2016-17 season, the California Interscholastic Federation featured 800,364 participants, with 58% boys and 42% girls.

The sports with most boys are:
* American football: 97,079

* Volleyball: 44,526
* Basketball: 34,222
* Softball: 33,265
* Swimming: 29,722

*Model Coach Award, for coaches who are positive role models
*Scholar-Athlete of the Year, based on academic and athletic excellence, and character
*Spirit of Sport, based on sportsmanship, community service, and leadership

==Administration==

===Sections===

The state is broken up into ten administrative sections. These sections are:
Each section except for San Francisco and Oakland is further subdivided into leagues. The Northern Section is divided into three conferences which in turn are divided into leagues.

The Southern Section is the largest by both membership and geography, covering just under one-third of the state&#x27;s total area and almost half of the population base. The Southern section includes private schools in the LAUSD service area, whether inside or outside the city of Los Angeles, and the Central Coast and North Coast sections also include private schools in the cities of San Francisco and Oakland respectively. The three &quot;City Sections&quot; are operated by and were historically limited to the corresponding public school systems. With the advent of charter schools in California, all three City Sections include both traditional public schools and charter schools operating within the historic boundaries of the respective public school systems. The San Francisco Section now includes one private school as well.

The sections also serve as the qualifying entities for regional and state competitions, and may organize championships in sports not contested statewide, such as badminton, baseball, field hockey, gymnastics, lacrosse, skiing and snowboarding, soccer, softball, and water polo.

===Federated Council===
The organization&#x27;s supreme governing body is the Federated Council. This council consists of one representative from each section, a representative from the California Department of Education, representatives from all bodies recognized as Allied Organizations by the CIF, the Council President, the President-Elect, and the immediate past President. Each representative is elected to a term of two years. The Council meets three times per year.

===Allied organizations===
The following groups are considered Allied Organization by CIF:
* California Department of Education
* California School Boards Association (CSBA)
* National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS)
* Association of California School Administrators (ACSA)
* California State Athletic Directors Association (CSADA)
* California Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (CAHPERD)
* California Coaches Association
* Josephson Institute &quot;Character Counts!&quot;
* Positive Coaching Alliance
* Center for Sports Parenting

<doc id="957001" wikidata="Q719775" url="?curid=957001" title="Ring network">
<text>A ring network is a network topology in which each node connects to exactly two other nodes, forming a single continuous pathway for signals through each node – a ring. Data travels from node to node, with each node along the way handling every packet.

Rings can be unidirectional, with all traffic travelling either clockwise or anticlockwise around the ring, or bidirectional (as in SONET/SDH). Because a unidirectional ring topology provides only one pathway between any two nodes, unidirectional ring networks may be disrupted by the failure of a single link. A node failure or cable break might isolate every node attached to the ring. In response, some ring networks add a &quot;counter-rotating ring&quot; (C-Ring) to form a redundant topology: in the event of a break, data are wrapped back onto the complementary ring before reaching the end of the cable, maintaining a path to every node along the resulting C-Ring. Such &quot;dual ring&quot; networks include the ITU-T&#x27;s PSTN telephony systems network Signalling System No. 7 (SS7), Spatial Reuse Protocol, Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), Resilient Packet Ring, and Ethernet Ring Protection Switching. IEEE 802.5 networks – also known as IBM Token Ring networks – avoid the weakness of a ring topology altogether: they actually use a &quot;star&quot; topology at the &quot;physical&quot; layer and a media access unit (MAU) to &quot;imitate&quot; a ring at the &quot;datalink&quot; layer. Ring networks are used by ISPs to provide data backhaul services, connecting the ISP&#x27;s facilities such as central offices/headends together.

All Signalling System No. 7 (SS7), and some SONET/SDH rings have two sets of bidirectional links between nodes. This allows maintenance or failures at multiple points of the ring usually without loss of the primary traffic on the outer ring by switching the traffic onto the inner ring past the failure points.

==Advantages==
*Very orderly network where every device has access to the token and the opportunity to transmit
*Performs better than a bus topology under heavy network load
*Does not require a central node to manage the connectivity between the computers
*Due to the point-to-point line configuration of devices with a device on either side (each device is connected to its immediate neighbor), it is quite easy to install and reconfigure since adding or removing a device requires moving just two connections.
*Point-to-point line configuration makes it easy to identify and isolate faults.
*Ring Protection reconfiguration for line faults of bidirectional rings can be very fast, as switching happens at a high level, and thus the traffic does not require individual rerouting.
* Ring topology helps mitigate collisions in a network.

==Disadvantages==
*One malfunctioning workstation can create problems for the entire network. This can be solved by using a dual ring or a switch that closes off the break.
*Moving, adding and changing the devices can affect the network
*Communication delay is directly proportional to number of nodes in the network
*Bandwidth is shared on all links between devices
*More difficult to configure than a Star: node adjunction = Ring shutdown and reconfiguration

==Access protocols==
Rings can be used to carry circuits or packets or a combination of both. SDH rings carry circuits. Circuits are set up with out-of-band signalling protocols, whereas packets are usually carried via a Medium Access Control Protocol (MAC).

The purpose of media access control is to determine which station transmits when. As in any MAC protocol, the aims are to resolve contention and provide fairness. There are three main classes of media access protocol for ring networks: slotted, token and register insertion.

The slotted ring treats the latency of the ring network as a large shift register that permanently rotates. It is formatted into so-called slots of fixed size. A slot is either full or empty, as indicated by control flags in the head of the slot. A station that wishes to transmit waits for an empty slot and puts data in. Other stations can copy out the data and may free the slot, or it may circulate back to the source who frees it. An advantage of source-release, if the sender is banned from immediately re-using it, is that all other stations get the chance to use it first, hence avoiding bandwidth hogging. The pre-eminent example of the slotted ring is the Cambridge Ring.

==Misconceptions==
* &quot;Token Ring is an example of a ring topology.&quot; 802.5 (Token Ring) networks do not use a ring topology at layer 1. Token Ring networks are technologies developed by IBM typically used in local area networks. Token Ring (802.5) networks &quot;imitate&quot; a ring at layer 2 but use a physical star at layer 1.
* &quot;Rings prevent collisions.&quot; The term &quot;ring&quot; only refers to the layout of the cables. It is true that there are no collisions on an IBM Token Ring, but this is because of the layer 2 Media Access Control method, not the physical topology (which again is a star, not a ring.) Token passing, not rings, prevent collisions.
* &quot;Token passing happens on rings.&quot; Token passing is a way of managing access to the cable, implemented at the MAC sublayer of layer 2. Ring topology is the cable layout at layer one. It is possible to do token passing on a bus (802.4) a star (802.5) or a ring (FDDI). Token passing is not restricted to rings.

<text>Time Crisis 3 is a 2003 light-gun shooter video game developed by Namco and Nextech and published by Namco for arcades. It is the third installment of the &quot;Time Crisis&quot; series. Like its predecessor, &quot;Time Crisis II&quot;, it allows for two players to cooperate in a link play environment and has the &quot;Time Crisis&quot; signature pedal system for hiding and advancing and the first in the series to change or select weapons. It was later ported to the PlayStation 2.

== Gameplay==
&quot;Time Crisis 3&quot; incorporates a new type of weapons system allowing the player to switch between the standard 9-round handgun, a fully automatic machine gun that can hold 200 rounds, a shotgun with 50 shells and a 5-round grenade launcher with powerful splash damage. Only the handgun has unlimited ammunition, though players can shoot yellow-clad soldiers to gain ammunition for their other weapons. This feature was later used in the port of &quot;Crisis Zone&quot;, with some changes.

The game also refines the crisis flash system which life-threatening shots are brighter, making pedal-releasing advisories easier.

=== PlayStation 2 version ===

The PlayStation 2 version includes plot elements, features and weapons not found in its arcade counterpart. Alicia Winston is featured as a playable character, having been an unplayable supporting character in the arcade version of the game. Gameplay for Alicia is, for the most part, the same as the regular campaign, with occasional sections in which the player must use a sniper rifle to deal with enemy snipers. Players can access the Crisis Mission exercise menu through prolonged gameplay.

==Plot==
In 2003, 6 years after &quot;Time Crisis II&quot;, Astigos, the largest island in the Mediterranean nation of Lukano, is invaded by special forces from the neighboring Zagorian Federation. Led by dictator General Giorgio Zott, the invaders conquer 80% of Astigos in a matter of weeks despite international protests. Meanwhile, the surviving Lukano defenders organize themselves into the Lukano Liberation Force under Daniel Winston. Learning that the Zagorian forces have set up a base in the abandoned Astigos State Observatory, Daniel and his lieutenant Jake Hernandez lead a small force to infiltrate and destroy it. Once inside, however, they are captured by waiting Zagorian troops.

A week later, Daniel&#x27;s sister Alicia undertakes a solo mission to infiltrate a Zagorian bunker. Inside, she downloads intelligence that leads her to discover the Zagorians have acquired tactical ballistic missiles, which they intend to use to eliminate the rest of the LLF and potentially threaten neighboring nations. Alicia transmits the info to her contact at the V.S.S.E., who in turn gets the agency to dispatch agents Alan Dunaway and Wesley Lambert to destroy the missiles. Posing as fishermen, Alan and Wesley launch an attack on Marano Beach but are quickly cornered into a shipwreck by the Zagorian defenders. Their leader, Air Force Colonel Victor Zahn, attacks them in his heavily armed gunship. Alicia manages to steal a jeep and rescue the agents, then helps them to shoot down Zahn. The three make their way to Astigos Town Center, where they are separated in a surprise attack. Alan and Wesley fight their way through town and the forest to reach a supply train heading up to Zott&#x27;s compound. Meanwhile, Alicia is confronted by Jake, who is revealed to be the greedy traitor who sold out Daniel for the love of money. After running Jake out of town, Alicia links up with the agents at the trainyard.

Randy Garrett, the head of Zott&#x27;s &quot;Assassin Squad&quot;, leads them into an ambush, during which he destroys the bridge, causing the train to fall into the river. After finishing off Garrett and his men, Alan, Wesley and Alicia approach the base, where they once again split up to defeat the exterior defenders. Alan and Wesley are confronted by hired gunman Wild Dog — who was seemingly killed during the events involving the NeoDyne incident — with his new protégé, Wild Fang, who has greatly enhanced leg strength. In the ensuing battle, Fang is apparently killed, but Dog once again commits self-detonates via explosives to evade capture. Zott prepares to execute Daniel in revenge, but Alicia shoots the pistol out of his hand with a sniper rifle. Alan and Wesley chase Zott into the compound while Alicia liberates Daniel&#x27;s men from captivity. Arming themselves, the fighters arrive just in time to save the agents from Zott&#x27;s soldiers. At the same time, Alicia catches Jake trying to escape with a stolen nuclear warhead. She disables his ship, forcing him to detonate his cargo prematurely. Using her sniper skills, Alicia simultaneously destroys the detonator and kills Jake before sending the burning wreckage crashing into the sea.

Alan and Wesley confront Zott inside the main dome and shoot him dead, but not before he initiates the launch. Using rocket launchers, the two destroy the dome&#x27;s roof, causing it to cave in and destroy the missiles. Around the same time after Alicia rejoins her brother, the V.S.S.E. agents manage to escape the dome safely.

Their mission a success, Alan and Wesley return home, while the LLF ultimately defeats the Zagorians and forces them out of Lukano, freeing Astigos Island.

==Mobile phone spin-off==
A spin-off of &quot;Time Crisis 3&quot;, &quot;Time Crisis Mobile (3D)&quot;, was released on mobile phones and later re-ported in 2009 to the iPhone OS with the name &quot;Time Crisis Strike&quot;.

==Reception==

The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

<doc id="957012" wikidata="Q1316482" url="?curid=957012" title="WCW World War 3">
<text>World War 3 was an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The pay-per-view&#x27;s title also was the name of its signature match, a three-ring, sixty-man battle royal. The event took place every November from 1995 until 1998. Like the Royal Rumble, the World War 3 match was held at the event that shared its name. The first two World War 3 events were held at the Norfolk Scope and the last two were held at The Palace of Auburn Hills. In 1999, it was replaced by Mayhem.

WWE owns the rights of &quot;World War 3&quot; since the sale of WCW and its trademarks in 2001. In February 2021, all WCW pay-per-views were made available on the WWE Network.

==Rules==
The rules for a World War 3 match were similar to the rules for a traditional battle royal match:

*All sixty men were randomly assigned a specific ring before the match began.
*The match began with all sixty men, in three rings, when the bell rings. Each ring was assigned a number. From left-to-right on the TV screen ring #1 was on the left, ring #2 was the center ring and ring #3 was on the right.
**Originally, in order to be eliminated from the match a wrestler had to be thrown over the top rope and have both feet touch the floor. This rule was amended in 1997 to allow for eliminations if a person leaves the ring in any way. In 1998 the rule was amended again to allow the counting of pinfalls and submissions for eliminations.
*When 10 men remained in ring #1 or ring #3 they moved to ring #2 and the match continued.
**This rule was amended in 1997 so that the competitors had to move to the central ring once forty men had been eliminated.
*The last man standing in the ring was declared the winner.

The inaugural World War 3 match was contested for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which had been stripped from The Giant due to the outcome of his match with Hulk Hogan at Halloween Havoc in October 1995. In subsequent years the winner of the match became the #1 contender to the World Heavyweight Championship. Initially the winner got to pick which pay-per-view he would face the champion at, but this changed for the 1997 and 1998 matches to a set pay-per-view.

==Dates, venues, winners, and main events==

===Championship match for winner===
: – Championship victory
: – Championship match loss
==Offshoots==
On the July 1, 2022 episode of &quot;AEW Rampage&quot;, All Elite Wrestling held its first Royal Rampage match, which would include a battle royal involving more than one ring, in this case two rings, and 20 competitors, with the winner one contender for the AEW World Heavyweight Championship.

IR is also function to assess the impact of a company actions (e.g. acquisitions, change in dividend policy, introduction of new product) on the company&#x27;s position in the capital markets (e.g. stock price, competitive position, public perception).

The term describes the department of a company devoted to handling inquiries from shareholders and investors, as well as others who might be interested in a company&#x27;s stock or financial stability.

==Structure==
Typically investor relations is a department or person reporting to the chief financial officer (CFO) or treasurer. In some companies, investor relations is managed by the public relations or corporate communications departments, and can also be referred to as &quot;financial public relations&quot; or &quot;financial communications.&quot; In smaller companies, the IR function is often outsourced to independent investor relations firms. Investor relations is considered a specialty of public relations by the U.S. Department of Labor.

Many larger publicly traded companies now have dedicated IR officers (IROs), who oversee most aspects of shareholder meetings, press conferences, private meetings with investors, (known as &quot;one-on-one&quot; briefings), investor relations sections of company websites, and company annual reports. These reports are frequently self-published on the corporate website, though in the past, external services were more commonly used for mandatory disclosures. The investor relations function also often includes the transmission of information relating to intangible values such as the company&#x27;s policy on corporate governance or corporate social responsibility. Recently, the field has trended toward an increasingly popular movement for &quot;interactive data&quot;, and the management of company filings through streaming-data solutions such as XBRL or other forms of electronic disclosure have become prevalent topics of discussion amongst leading IROs worldwide.

The investor relations function must be aware of current and upcoming issues that an organization or issuer may face, particularly those that relate to fiduciary duty and organizational impact. In particular, it must be able to assess the various patterns of stock-trading that a public company may experience, often as the result of a public disclosure (or any research reports issued by financial analysts). The investor relations department must also work closely with the Corporate Secretary on legal and regulatory matters that affect shareholders.

While most IROs would report to the chief financial officer, they will also usually report to the chief executive officer (CEO) and board of directors and/or president of the corporation. This means that as well as being able to understand and communicate the company&#x27;s financial strategy, they are also able to communicate the broader strategic direction of the corporation and ensure that the image of the corporation is maintained in a cohesive fashion.

The president or CEO of the company or corporation would have direct responsibility in relating the company&#x27;s overall posture directly to the shareholders or the investors.

Due to the potential impact of legal liability claims awarded by courts, and the consequential impact on the company&#x27;s share price, IR often has a role in crisis management of, for example, corporate downsizing, changes in management or internal structure, product liability issues and industrial disasters.

The professional member organization for investor relations in the United States is the National Investor Relations Institute, or NIRI. In addition to numerous professional development seminars and meetings, NIRI offers a certification program, the Investor Relations Charter. In the United Kingdom, the recognized industry body is The Investor Relations Society, while in Canada, the professional association is called the Canadian Investor Relations Institute, or CIRI. Australia&#x27;s professional organization is known as the Australian Investor Relations Association (AIRA). Taiwan&#x27;s professional organization is known as the Taiwan Investor Relations Institute (TIRI). 

==The Sarbanes–Oxley Act==
The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 significantly increased the importance of investor relations in the financial markets. The act established new requirements for corporate governance and regulatory compliance, with an increased emphasis on accuracy in auditing and public disclosure. Notable provisions of the act which apply to investor relations include enhanced financial disclosures and accuracy of financial reports, real-time disclosures, off-balance-sheet transaction disclosures, pro forma financial disclosures, management assessment of internal controls, and corporate responsibility for financial reports. More specifically, Sarbanes–Oxley sections 301, 302, 404, and 802 have been of particular interest to companies improving corporate compliance. 

Similar to Sarbanes–Oxley are the Keeping the Promise for a Strong Economy Act (Budget Measures), 2002 in Canada, Financial Security Law of France in France, and J-SOX in Japan. The European MiFID Directive, although principally concerned with investor protection, also covers regulation and compliance for listed European companies.

<text>Charles Frederick &quot;Karch&quot; Kiraly ( ; born November 3, 1960) is an American volleyball player, coach, and broadcast announcer. He was a central part of the U.S National Team that won gold medals at the 1984 and 1988 Olympic Games. He went on to win the gold medal again at the 1996 Olympic Games, the first Olympic competition to feature beach volleyball. He is the only player (man or woman) to have won Olympic medals of any color in both the indoor and beach volleyball categories. He played college volleyball for the UCLA Bruins, where his teams won three national championships under head coach Al Scates. Kiraly is widely regarded as the greatest male volleyball player of all time.

Kiraly is currently the head coach of the United States women&#x27;s national volleyball team leading them to their first-ever gold medal in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and thereby completing the &quot;triple crown&quot; of coaching an Olympic gold medal-winning team as well as personally winning gold medals in both indoor and beach volleyball.

==Early life==
Kiraly grew up in Santa Barbara, California. He began playing volleyball at age six with encouragement from his father, Laszlo Kiraly, who had been a member of the Hungarian Junior National team prior to fleeing the country during the Hungarian national uprising of 1956. At age 11, Kiraly entered his first beach volleyball tournament paired with his father.&lt;f the boys&#x27; varsity volleyball team. His father played a key role in creating the boys&#x27; volleyball program at the school. The Dons of Santa Barbara made it to the championship game twice during Kiraly&#x27;s high school years, reaching the finals his sophomore year before losing in the championship match to San Clemente High School in 1976. In his senior year, Kiraly&#x27;s high school team went undefeated, winning CIF SS by defeating Laguna Beach High School in the title game in 1978, and Kiraly was voted Sectional Player of the Year. During his high school years, Kiraly was invited to join the Junior National Team, on which he competed for three years. Kiraly has credited his high school coach, Rick Olmstead, for teaching him the value of hard work and dedication.

While growing up, he had the Hungarian nickname Karcsi (pronounced Karch-ee), which corresponds to the Hungarian name Karoly for Charles. Later at UCLA he began to be called Karch.

==College career==
In 1978, Kiraly enrolled at UCLA, where he majored in biochemistry and also was a brother of the Epsilon Sigma Chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha. From his freshman year, he played outside hitter and setter on the Bruins&#x27; volleyball team, playing opposite junior Sinjin Smith in the Bruins&#x27; 6–2 offense. Under head coach Al Scates, Kiraly led UCLA to the NCAA Men&#x27;s Volleyball Championship in his freshman season in 1979. In his sophomore season, the Bruins made it to the finals again but lost to crosstown rivals USC. UCLA reclaimed the top spot in Kiraly&#x27;s junior season. Kiraly finished his college career with another title during his senior year. In his four years, the Bruins compiled a 123–5 match record, with titles in 1979, 1981, and 1982. They went undefeated in the 1979 and 1982 seasons. Kiraly earned All-American honors all four years, and was awarded NCAA Volleyball Tournament Most Outstanding Player in 1981 and 1982.

Kiraly earned a Bachelor of Science degree in biochemistry from UCLA, graduating cum laude in June 1983 with a 3.55 cumulative GPA.

Kiraly was inducted into the UCLA Hall of Fame in 1992, and his jersey was retired in 1993.

Growing up, Kiraly wanted to be a biochemist to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps, but that changed when he joined the US national team and led it to multiple gold medals. He was twice named the best player in the world by the international governing body. He was also named the best volleyball player of the 20th century along with Lorenzo Bernardi.

==United States national team==
Kiraly joined the national team in 1981. Playing outside hitter, he proved to be an extremely solid passer. Along with teammate Aldis Berzins, Kiraly was the foundation for the &quot;two-man&quot; serve reception system Doug Beal created in 1983. Along with covering half the court on serve receive and consistently delivering the ball to team setter Dusty Dvorak, Kiraly proved to be an excellent defender and a highly productive outside hitter. Kiraly led the U.S. National Team to the gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics, overcoming a pool play loss to Brazil to defeat Brazil in the finals. Kiraly was the youngest player on the gold medal team.

The US National team showed their place as the world&#x27;s best team by winning the 1985 FIVB World Cup, followed by the 1986 FIVB World Championship. In the 1988 Summer Olympics, the team won its second Olympic gold medal, this time defeating the USSR in the championship match. Kiraly was selected as a captain for the 1988 team at Seoul. FIVB named Kiraly the top player in the world in 1986 and 1988.

Following the 1988 Olympics, Kiraly retired from the national team. He and teammate Steve Timmons played professional volleyball for Il Messaggero Ravenna in Italy from 1990 to 1992. The team included Italians Fabio Vullo and Andrea Gardini, Roberto Masciarelli, and Stefano Margutti as team members. In two seasons the team won a series of titles, including the Italian Volleyball League (1991), the Italian Cup (1991), FIVB Volleyball Men&#x27;s Club World Championship (1991), CEV Champions League (1992), and the European Supercup (1992).

==Career in beach volleyball==
Kiraly had a long career on the professional beach circuit, and with 148 career tournaments won is the &#x27;winningest&#x27; player in the sport&#x27;s history. He won at least one tournament in 24 of the 28 seasons he played in a career that spanned four decades. He claimed titles with 13 partners, and in domestic events, he made it to the semifinals over 80% of the time. Kiraly competed into his mid-40s.

Kiraly played in his first beach tournament at age 11 as his father&#x27;s partner. Kiraly has said as an 11-year-old he was thrilled to discover in beach volleyball he could compete with grown men on even terms. He earned his A and AA ratings on the beach at the age of 15 and his AAA rating at 17. Kiraly&#x27;s first big beach breakthrough came at Hermosa Beach in 1978. As a 17-year-old who had just graduated from high school, he shocked Hermosa onlookers by gaining the finals before he and partner Marco Ortega lost to the day&#x27;s dominant team on the beach, Jim Menges and Greg Lee. In the early 1980s, Kiraly made a successful beach team pairing with UCLA teammate Sinjin Smith. The partnership split up as Kiraly came to focus on the U.S. National Team.

In 1992, Kiraly left his indoor career behind, returning to the U.S. to play beach volleyball full-time on the AVP tour. Kiraly chose Kent Steffes as his doubles partner. Steffes was a talented younger player who had left UCLA early to start playing on the professional beach tour. Kiraly and Steffes soon became the dominant pairing on the tour, supplanting former teammate and doubles partner Smith and his partner Randy Stoklos as the beach&#x27;s top team. In 1996 Kiraly returned to the Olympics, this time competing in beach volleyball with his partner, Steffes. Kiraly and Steffes won the gold medal, the first ever awarded for men&#x27;s beach volleyball.

Kiraly continued to win tournaments into his 40s, recording two AVP tournament victories with his partner Brent Doble in 2002 and 2003, and four more with Mike Lambert in 2004 and 2005. Kiraly&#x27;s last victory came in August 2005, when he and Lambert won at Huntington Beach. In 2006, Kiraly partnered with Larry Witt, and in 2007 partnered with Kevin Wong. His teams continued to make high placings. Over his career on the beach, Kiraly won over $3 million in prize money and earned considerably more in endorsements. Kiraly retired from the AVP tour after the 2007 season.

Ultimately Kiraly won 148 professional beach volleyball titles, 74 of them with Steffes. The next closest player in total wins is Sinjin Smith at 139. Following Smith is his longtime partner, Randy Stoklos, at 122. The next closest player is Kent Steffes at 110, followed by Emanuel Rego, with 78 wins.

==Broadcasting==
Kiraly has worked as a broadcaster for ESPN and provided color commentary for the AVP on NBC broadcasts. Kiraly worked as an analyst for NBC Sports during their coverage of the beach volleyball competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

==Coaching career==
Kiraly began coaching at St. Margaret&#x27;s Episcopal High School, where he coached his sons, Kristian and Kory.

Head coach Hugh McCutcheon of the US National Women&#x27;s Volleyball team hired Kiraly as an assistant, where he helped coach the team to a silver medal at the 2012 London Olympics.

In 2012, Kiraly was named head coach of the US National Women&#x27;s Volleyball team to try to compete in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In October 2014, Kiraly coached the Women&#x27;s National Team to the FIVB World Championship, defeating China in the Gold Medal final. In doing so, Kiraly became the fourth person to win a World Championship gold medal as a player and a coach.

During the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Kiraly coached the US women to a bronze medal, becoming the fourth player to win medals as player and coach.

The FIVB Volleyball Women&#x27;s Nations League 2021 championship was held in Italy and Karch coached the women&#x27;s indoor USA team to win the top prize of $1 million.

On August 8, 2021, during the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, Kiraly coached the US women to a gold medal, becoming the second person to win a gold medal as player and coach; the first was Lang Ping from China.

==Personal life==
Kiraly resides in Heber City, Utah, with his wife Janna, and two sons, Kristian and Kory. His father, Laszlo Kiraly, played for the Hungarian junior national volleyball team. Kiraly studied biochemistry in college, and considered pursuing a career in medicine after completing college.

Kiraly babysat Misty May-Treanor when she was a youngster.

On the same day Kiraly led the national team to their historic gold medal win at the 2020 Summer Olympics, he revealed that he was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2017 and had to have doctors remove part of his colon in order to fight the disease. Trying to keep the team in good working order, he did not want to make his team feel sad and decided not to share the news with them until he went into cancer remission in 2021.

==Publications==
Kiraly is the author of three books, &quot;Karch Kiraly&#x27;s Championship Volleyball&quot;, co-authored with Jon Hastings and published by Simon and Schuster in 1996, &quot;Beach Volleyball&quot;, co-authored with Byron Shewman and published by Human Kinetics in 1999, and &quot;Chasing Greatness&quot;, co-authored with Don Patterson and published by Total Sports LLC in 2023.

<doc id="957027" wikidata="Q146075" url="?curid=957027" title="Zanamivir">
<text>Zanamivir is a medication used to treat and prevent influenza caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses. It is a neuraminidase inhibitor and was developed by the Australian biotech firm Biota Holdings. It was licensed to Glaxo in 1990 and approved in the US in 1999, only for use as a treatment for influenza. In 2006, it was approved for prevention of influenza A and B. Zanamivir was the first neuraminidase inhibitor commercially developed. It is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline under the trade name Relenza as a powder for oral inhalation.

== Properties ==
Zanamivir room temperature solubility in water is 36 mg/mL, in DMSO is 66 mg/mL. It&#x27;s insoluble in ethanol.

==Medical uses==
Zanamivir is used for the treatment of infections caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses, but in otherwise-healthy individuals, benefits overall appear to be small. It decreases the risk of one contracting symptomatic, but not asymptomatic influenza. The combination of diagnostic uncertainty, the risk for virus strain resistance, possible side effects and financial cost outweigh the small benefits of zanamivir for the prophylaxis and treatment of healthy individuals.

===Treatment===
In otherwise-healthy individuals, benefits overall appear to be small. Zanamivir shortens the duration of symptoms of influenza-like illness (unconfirmed influenza or &#x27;the flu&#x27;) by less than a day. In children with asthma there was no clear effect on the time to first alleviation of symptoms. Whether it affects the risk of one&#x27;s need to be hospitalized or the risk of death is not clear. There is no proof that zanamivir reduced hospitalizations or pneumonia and other complications of influenza, such as bronchitis, middle ear infection, and sinusitis. Zanamivir did not reduce the risk of self reported investigator mediated pneumonia or radiologically confirmed pneumonia in adults. The effect on pneumonia in children was also not significant.

===Prevention===
Low to moderate evidence indicates it decreases the risk of one&#x27;s getting influenza by 1 to 12% in those exposed. Prophylaxis trials showed that zanamivir reduced the risk of symptomatic influenza in individuals and households, but there was no evidence of an effect on asymptomatic influenza or on other, influenza-like illnesses. Also there was no evidence of reduction of risk of person-to-person spread of the influenza virus.
The evidence for a benefit in preventing influenza is weak in children, with concerns of publication bias in the literature.

===Resistance===
As of 2009, no influenza had shown any signs of resistance in the US.
A meta-analysis from 2011 found that zanamivir resistance had been rarely reported. Antiviral resistance can emerge during or after treatment with antivirals in certain people (e.g., immunosuppressed). In 2013 genes expressing resistance to zanamivir (and oseltamivir) were found in Chinese patients infected with avian influenza A H7N9.

==Adverse effects==
Dosing is limited to the inhalation route. This restricts its usage, as treating asthmatics could induce bronchospasms. In 2006 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that breathing problems (bronchospasm), including deaths, were reported in some patients after the initial approval of Relenza. Most of these patients had asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Relenza therefore was not recommended for treatment or prophylaxis of seasonal influenza in individuals with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In 2009 the zanamivir package insert contains precautionary information regarding risk of bronchospasm in patients with respiratory disease.
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and FDA notified healthcare professionals of a report of the death of a patient with influenza having received zanamivir inhalation powder, which was solubilized and administered by mechanical ventilation.

In adults there was no increased risk of reported adverse events in trials. There was little evidence of the possible harms associated with the treatment of children with zanamivir.
Zanamivir has not been known to cause toxic effects and has low systemic exposure to the human body.

==Mechanism of action==
Zanamivir works by binding to the active site of the neuraminidase protein, rendering the influenza virus unable to escape its host cell and infect others. It is also an inhibitor of influenza virus replication &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;. In clinical trials, zanamivir was found to reduce the time-to-symptom resolution by 1.5 days if therapy was started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.

The bioavailability of zanamivir is 2%. After inhalation, zanamivir is concentrated in the lungs and oropharynx, where up to 15% of the dose is absorbed and excreted in urine.

== History ==

Zanamivir was first made in 1989 by scientists led by Peter Colman and Joseph Varghese at the Australian CSIRO, in collaboration with the Victorian College of Pharmacy and Monash University. Zanamivir was the first of the neuraminidase inhibitors. The discovery was initially funded by the Australian biotechnology company Biota and was part of Biota&#x27;s ongoing program to develop antiviral agents through rational drug design. Its strategy relied on the availability of the structure of influenza neuraminidase by X-ray crystallography. It was also known, as far back as 1974, that 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-&quot;N&quot;-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA), a sialic acid analogue, is an inhibitor of neuraminidase.

Computational chemistry techniques were used to probe the active site of the enzyme, in an attempt to design derivatives of DANA that would bind tightly to the amino acid residues of the catalytic site, so would be potent and specific inhibitors of the enzyme. The GRID software by Molecular Discovery was used to determine energetically favourable interactions between various functional groups and residues in the catalytic site canyon. This investigation showed a negatively charged zone occurs in the neuraminidase active site that aligns with the C4 hydroxyl group of DANA. This hydroxyl is, therefore, replaced with a positively charged amino group; the 4-amino DANA was shown to be 100 times better as an inhibitor than DANA, owing to the formation of a salt bridge with a conserved glutamic acid (119) in the active site. Glu 119 was also noticed to be at the bottom of a conserved pocket in the active site that is just big enough to accommodate the larger, but more basic guanidine functional group. Zanamivir, a transition-state analogue inhibitor of neuraminidase, was the result.

In 1999, the product was approved for marketing in the US and Europe for treatment of influenza A and B. The FDA advisory committee had recommended by a vote 13 to 4 that it should not be approved, because it lacked efficacy and was no more effective than placebo when the patients were on other drugs such as paracetamol. But the FDA leadership overruled the committee and criticised its reviewer, biostatistician Michael Elashoff. The review of oseltamivir, which was also in approval process at that time, was taken away from him, and reassigned to someone else. In 2006 zanamivir was approved in the US and Europe for prevention of influenza A and B.

<doc id="957034" wikidata="Q433669" url="?curid=957034" title="Helen Chenoweth-Hage">
<text>Helen Margaret Palmer Chenoweth-Hage (born Helen Margaret Palmer; January 27, 1938 – October 2, 2006) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Idaho, serving three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2001. She remains one of two women to ever represent Idaho in the United States Congress and the only one from the Republican Party.

==Early life and career==
She was born in Kansas. Her family moved west to Los Angeles when Helen was a year old, then north to southern Oregon when she was 12, to run a dairy farm near Grants Pass. A musician, horse enthusiast, and athlete, she attended Whitworth College in Spokane, Washington on music scholarship (double bass), where she met Nick Chenoweth while working in a cafeteria; she was a waitress and he was a cook. The two were married in 1958.

They had two children, Michael and Margaret (Meg), both born in Nick&#x27;s hometown of Orofino, Idaho. The Chenoweths ran a ski shop near the modest Bald Mountain ski area. Later, Helen developed and managed the Northside Medical Clinic, where she initiated a physician recruitment practice for under-served rural communities, while Nick attended the UI law school in Moscow.

The Chenoweths divorced in 1975 and Helen moved to Boise to become executive director of the Idaho Republican Party. Later she went on to serve as then-Congressman Steve Symms&#x27; District Director in 1977 through his re-election in 1978, then started her own business, Consulting Associates, and became a noteworthy lobbyist in Idaho&#x27;s capital city.

==Election and Congressional career==
In 1994, Chenoweth won the Republican nomination for Idaho&#x27;s 1st Congressional District over former Lieutenant Governor David H. Leroy and two other challengers. She pledged to serve no more than three terms in the U.S. House if elected. She defeated two-term Democratic incumbent Larry LaRocco by almost 11 points in the Republican wave that saw that party take control of the House for the first time in 40 years. During the campaign, Chenoweth attacked LaRocco for supporting the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; he was the only Idahoan in either chamber to back the bill. While Chenoweth&#x27;s victory was one of many instances of historically Republican districts reverting to form after electing Democrats, it was still surprising considering LaRocco&#x27;s 20-point victory margin in 1992.

With her victory in 1994, Chenoweth became the second woman (after Gracie Pfost) to represent Idaho in Congress and one of few members to be elected by her peers to chair a subcommittee (House Subcommittee on Forest and Forest Health) after only one term.

As one of the &quot;true believers&quot; in the Republican freshman class of 1995, Chenoweth was considered one of the most conservative members of the House. She staunchly opposed government regulation, and was a strong supporter of school prayer. One measure placed her as the most conservative woman to serve in Congress between 1937 and 2004. Much was made of her &quot;insistence&quot; on the title &quot;Congressman Chenoweth&quot; (as opposed to the more common &quot;Congresswoman&quot;).

During her tenure, she was referred to by her most outspoken critics as a &quot;poster-child for the militias,&quot; and in February 1995 she voiced the suspicion that armed federal agents were landing black helicopters on Idaho ranchers&#x27; property to enforce the Endangered Species Act, in line with a longstanding conspiracy theory. &quot;I have never seen them,&quot; Chenoweth said in an interview in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;But enough people in my district have become concerned that I can&#x27;t just ignore it. We do have some proof.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editorialized that during the campaign she gained national attention by &quot;holding &#x27;endangered salmon bakes&#x27; during fundraisers, serving canned salmon to ridicule the listing of Idaho salmon as an endangered species.&quot; She was quoted as saying in response, &quot;It&#x27;s the white, Anglo-Saxon male that&#x27;s endangered today.&quot;

Chenoweth faced a strong challenge in 1996 from Democratic activist Dan Williams, but was reelected in a close contest—most likely helped by Bob Dole easily carrying the district in the presidential election. Chenoweth defeated Williams again in 1998 by a wider margin. She later said that she regretted limiting herself to three terms and called the whole concept of term limits bad policy. She nonetheless honored her pledge and did not run for reelection to a fourth term in 2000. She was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Butch Otter, a fellow Republican. Since her retirement, no women have represented Idaho in either house of Congress.

Chenoweth remained a controversial and polarizing figure in Idaho politics throughout her career. While in Congress she articulated and defended a &quot;freedom&quot; philosophy that was simultaneously cherished by her supporters and derided by her opponents.

===Criticism of President Clinton===
In November 1997, Chenoweth was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998.

She was a critic of President Clinton during the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal and was one of the first to call for his resignation over the affair, although she admitted that she had carried on a six-year illicit romance with married rancher Vernon Ravenscroft when she worked for his natural-resources consulting firm during the 1980s. Chenoweth claimed that her case was different from the Clinton/Lewinsky case since she was a private citizen at the time, and because &quot;I&#x27;ve asked for God&#x27;s forgiveness, and I&#x27;ve received it.&quot;

On October 8, 1998, Chenoweth voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry against Bill Clinton. On December 19, 1998, Chenoweth voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the majority of votes needed to be adopted).

==Later life==
During her final term, Chenoweth married rancher and author Wayne Hage in Boise in 1999 and changed her name to Helen Chenoweth-Hage. After leaving Congress, she moved to Hage&#x27;s Nevada ranch, where the two continued to write and speak on private property rights issues. Wayne Hage died after being treated for cancer at age 68 on June 5, 2006.

After leaving Congress, Chenoweth-Hage continued to make headlines. In 2003 at the Boise Airport she was selected by the Transportation Security Administration for a hand search before they would permit her to board a plane for her Nevada home. Chenoweth-Hage requested to see a copy of the regulation granting United States Department of Homeland Security the authority to search her without cause. When the request was denied, she refused to submit to the search and elected to make the trip by rental car. &quot;Our borders are wide open and yet they&#x27;re shaking down a 66-year-old white grandmother they greeted by name,&quot; she said of the incident. &quot;It&#x27;s time the American people say no to this kind of invasion. It&#x27;s a question of personal privacy. There shouldn&#x27;t be that kind of search without reasonable cause.&quot;

===Death===
On October 2, 2006, Chenoweth-Hage was killed after being thrown from the passenger seat of a sport utility vehicle that overturned on an isolated highway in central Nevada, near Tonopah. She was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident. Her (step) daughter-in-law and grandson, who were also in the vehicle, suffered only minor injuries.

Chenoweth-Hage was memorialized at a service held in Meridian, Idaho, on October 9, 2006. She is buried alongside husband Wayne Hage at the Pine Creek Ranch Family Cemetery in Monitor Valley, Nevada. Her first husband, Nick Chenoweth, died in 2002 at age 66.

<doc id="957067" wikidata="Q470072" url="?curid=957067" title="King Zhou of Shang">
<text>King Zhou (; ) was the pejorative posthumous name given to Di Xin of Shang () or Shou, King of Shang (), the last king of the Shang dynasty of ancient China. He is also called Zhou Xin (). In Chinese, his name Zhòu () also refers to a horse crupper, the part of a saddle or harness that is most likely to be soiled by the horse. It is not to be confused with the name of the succeeding dynasty, which has a different character and pronunciation ().

In later times, the story of King Zhou became a cautionary tale on what could befall a kingdom if its ruler gave into corruption and moral depravity.

==Names==
Di Xin is the official title given by the Shang dynasty imperial house. Di Xin was born with the family name Zi, lineage name Yin, and the given name Shou. He was called Shou, King of Shang by the kingdom of Zhou when he was alive. After his death, he was given a derogatory posthumous name, King Zhou of Shang () by the succeeding Zhou dynasty, with Zhou () meaning &quot;horse crupper&quot;, implicating &quot;injustice and harm&quot;.

==Early reign==
In the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, Sima Qian wrote that Di Xin, in the early part of his reign, had abilities which surpassed those of the ordinary man, and was quick-witted and quick-tempered. According to legend, he was intelligent enough to win all of his arguments, and he was strong enough to hunt wild beasts with his bare hands. He was the younger brother of Zi Qi () and Zi Yan () (later rulers of Zhou&#x27;s vassal state Song) and father of Wu Geng. His father Di Yi had two brothers, Ji Zi and Bi Gan. Di Xin added to the territory of Shang by battling the tribes surrounding it, including the Dongyi to the east.

==Late reign==
A significant amount of information regarding Di Xin&#x27;s life had been falsified by following dynasties. Thus, many modern-day historians believe that he was, in fact, reasonable and intelligent, without several of the cruelties attributed to him. The following are accounts of him written in records published in the millennium following his death, during which many misconceptions surrounding him arose.
In his later years, Di Xin gave himself over to drinking, women, and abandoned morals, preferring these to the proper governance of the country, and ignored almost all affairs of state. According to Sima Qian, he even hosted festive orgies, where many people engaged in immoral things at the same time with his concubines and created songs with crude (erotic) lyrics and poor rhythm. In legends, he is depicted as having come under the influence of his wicked wife Daji, and committing all manner of evil and cruel deeds with her.

One of the most famous forms of entertainment Zhou enjoyed was the &quot;Lake of Wine and Forest of Meat&quot; built at the Deer Terrace Pavilion. A large pool, big enough for several canoes, was constructed with inner linings of polished oval-shaped stones from the seashores. This allowed for the entire pool to be filled with wine. A small island was constructed in the middle of the pool, where trees were planted, which had branches made of roasted meat skewers hanging over the pool. This allowed Zhou and his friends and concubines to drift on canoes in the pool. When they thirsted, they reached down into the pool with their hands and drank the wine. When they hungered, they reached up with their hands to eat the roasted meat. This was considered one of the most famous examples of decadence and corruption of a ruler in Chinese history.

According to the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, in order to please Daji, he created the &quot;Punishment of burning flesh with a hot iron ()&quot;. One large hollow bronze cylinder was stuffed with burning charcoal and allowed to burn until red-hot; then prisoners were made to hug the cylinder, which resulted in a painful and unsightly death.

Zhou and Daji were known to get highly aroused after watching such torture. Victims ranged from ordinary people and prisoners to high government officials, such as Mei Bo.

In order to fund Zhou&#x27;s heavy daily expenses, heavy taxes were implemented. The people suffered greatly, and lost all hope for the Shang dynasty. Zhou&#x27;s brother Wei Zi tried to persuade him to change, but was rebuked. His uncle Bi Gan similarly remonstrated with him, but Di Xin had his heart ripped out so he could see what the heart of a sage looked like. When his other uncle Ji Zi heard this, he went to remonstrate with the kingly nephew and, feigning madness, was imprisoned.

==Fall==
When the Zhou dynasty&#x27;s army, led by Jiang Ziya, defeated the Shang dynasty at the Battle of Muye in 1046 BC, Di Xin gathered all his treasures around himself in the Palace, and then set fire to his palace and committed suicide. After his death, Di Xin&#x27;s head was cut off and displayed on a white-flag pole by Ji Fa. Of Di Xin&#x27;s favorite consorts, Da Ji was executed and two more committed suicide, and their heads, likewise, were displayed on either small white flag poles or red flag poles.

The name &quot;Zhòu&quot; (紂; crupper) actually appeared after the death of King Zhou, a posthumous name. This name was meant to convey a negative value judgement, and his reign accumulated stories of increasingly egregious corruption. Centuries after his death, he had acquired the reputation of almost a paradigmatic wicked ruler.

==Mentions in literature and legend==
Zhou is mentioned in the Confucian Analects (19 &quot;子張&quot;); and also in the Three Character Classic. Zhou is also one of the main subjects of &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot; (&quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot;) and its various derivations in popular media. Thus, Di Xin, also known as Zhou, has served as a (negative) exemplar of Confucian principles (presented as the wicked ruler who justifies regime change according to the Mandate of Heaven), as well as becoming an icon of popular culture. This makes for a biographically interesting figure, but one challenging a clear distinction between history, legend, and philosophical point-making.

In &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot;, Zhou visited the Goddess Nüwa&#x27;s temple and offended the Goddess with his lustful comments towards her beauty. In response, Nüwa decided that the Shang dynasty should end and sent her three subordinates to become three beautiful women (including Daji) to bewitch Zhou. Under the influence of these women, Zhou becomes a ruthless king, losing the support of people and triggering his downfall. Until now, nobody knows most of his lifestyle from the reduced amount of artifacts found regarding to him.

In the novel, King Zhou has a wife named Queen Jiang, while Daji served as an imperial concubine. King Zhou had two sons, Yin Hong and Yin Jiao, with Queen Jiang. The character of Queen Jiang in the novel was based on the real historical figure and consort of King Zhou, Jiuhou Nü. Jiuhou Nü was the daughter of the leader of the Guifang, Jiuhou, and was presented to King Zhou through a political alliance.

According to the &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot;, Jiang Ziya recognized that King Zhou was a well-versed and well-trained individual who became an incapable ruler only because of having fallen victim to seduction. After his death, Jiang Ziya deified King Zhou as the Tianxi Xing ( &quot;Star of Heavenly Happiness&quot;). As the Tianxi Xing, he had the responsibility of managing the marriage affairs of humans.

==Archaeology and historiography==
Archaeologists believed that Tomb 1567 at the Yinxu site was constructed for King Zhou, but he was not buried there due to his suicide in Battle of Muye.

Following the downfall of the Shang dynasty, Di Xin and Jie of Xia (the last king of the Xia dynasty) were recorded as tyrants in most historical records by historians of later dynasties. However, some ancient historians and modern historians have cast doubts on this narrative due to archeological evidence contradicting historical records or inconsistencies found between older and later records. 

In the most common narrative, Di Xin killed his uncle Bi Gan by ripping his heart out. The Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project and other studies have pointed out inconsistencies. Bi Gan&#x27;s death due to remonstration is only recorded in the Spring and Autumn period, while the account of his heart being removed by Di Xin appeared much later in the fables of the Warring States period, indicating the extra details were likely added to reinforce Di Xin&#x27;s tyrannical image.

Di Xin is also known for his Lake of Wine and Forest of Meat at Deer Terrace Pavilion, used as evidence for historians of later dynasties to condemn the decadence and corruption of Di Xin. However, modern archaeological evidence at Deer Terrace Pavilion found a pool at the base of the structure purely for water storage and sanitation. The narrative of &quot;Pool of Wine&quot; was questioned as early as in the Han dynasty. Scholar Wang Chong, in his work &quot;Lunheng&quot;, suggested the accounts of &quot;wine pools and meat forests&quot; were unreliable. During the Southern Song dynasty, scholar Luo Mi wrote in the &quot;Lushi&quot; also considered the allegations against Di Xin to be largely unreliable and exaggerated after reviewing various documents.

With the continuous research on the Shang and Zhou dynasties, backed by the excavation of oracle bones, bronzeware, and other archaeological materials, the modern academic community increasingly questioned the tyrannical portrayal of Di Xin. The depiction of Di Xin during the Western Zhou period, though negative, did not contain substantive brutality. The earliest record written in the Zhou dynasty, &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, lists only six accusations against Di Xin, including listening to women, appointing fugitives to government/military positions, not performing proper rituals, excessive drinking, and believing in his destiny being in the heavens (&quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot;). The Da Yu ding during King Kang of Zhou period recorded that the primary reason for the downfall of the Shang dynasty was the Di Xin&#x27;s excessive drinking. The descriptions in later dynasties become more bloodthirsty and brutal, with increased details, even though the events took place in the distant past.

In excavation sites of the late Shang dynasty, grave goods made of metal and wood became more common while sacrificial goods for rituals were reduced, signifying a trend toward simpler burials. Prior to Di Xin&#x27;s rule, King Zu Jia of the Shang dynasty simplified and formulated the imperial rituals, increasing the use of grain and dance during rituals in place of human and animal sacrifice. There were barely any instances of human and animal sacrifices towards the end of the Shang dynasty when Di Xin reigns. After the Shang dynasty, the Zhou dynasty stopped simplifying the ritual procedures and instead increased the frequency of human sacrifices, a custom that continued to persist for several hundred years in the succeeding Zhou dynasty and its vassal states. The simplified rituals of Di Xin and the late Shang dynasty can be considered a progressive cultural change, while in the perspective of the later Zhou dynasty, it was disrespectful to the ancestors.

Women held many official positions during the Shang dynasty, such as jobs responsible for managing rituals, advising military affairs, managing court and guests, and they were highly respected by the Shang state, which was observed by numerous scholars like Chen Xi, Zhang Maorong, Wang Qiwei, Wang Hui, Wang Ruiying, Du Fangqin, He Min, Geng Chao, Xie Naihe. According to scholarly analysis, the overall status of women in the Shang dynasty was significantly higher than that of the following Zhou dynasty. During Zhou, women were increasingly excluded from military and political matters while the state emphasized domestic roles for them like silk production and weaving. The appointment of women in power during the Shang dynasty indicated a more progressive and gender-equal culture, while the Zhou state, following Confucian rituals, was more conservative.

Appointing fugitives to government positions was another justification for Zhou to overthrow Shang. This was intentionally done by Di Xin, who used this method to suppress the clans who held too much power in court. Di Xin believed in meritocracy and employed fugitives from other countries. Drinking was part of the Shang culture; thus, Di Xin&#x27;s drinking problem wasn&#x27;t uncommon during that period.

The concept of the &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot; is a subject of considerable debate. Some scholars, like Chao Fulin, argue that the Shang dynasty did not possess the later concept of the &#x27;Mandate of Heaven&#x27;, which dictates the rise and fall of dynasties. In the &#x27;Book of Shang,&#x27; the term &#x27;Mandate of Heaven&#x27; actually refers to &#x27;the command of the ancestors&#x27; (the spiritual power of the ancestors in heaven to bless or abandon one&#x27;s life).

Gu Xiagang and other Doubting Antiquity School historians noted the further into later periods, the more detailed and numerous the accusations of Di Xin became. During the Spring and Autumn period, intellectuals from various schools of thought traveled around China to present their political ideologies. In their allegorical stories, Di Xin, the deceased ruler of the fallen former dynasty, was portrayed as a negative exemplar to propagate the notion of &#x27;evil deserves retribution.&#x27; Compared to the original documents from the Western Zhou period, they ascribed numerous new accusations to King Zhou, such as the story of Lake of Wine and Forest of Meat and &quot;Punishment of burning flesh with a hot iron ()&quot;. Following the Han dynasty and onward, rulers continued to propagate the image of King Zhou of Shang as a negative figure. Over centuries of accumulated vilification, Di Xin (King Zhou) gradually became characterized as the epitome of a tyrant.

<text>Orang Asli are a heterogeneous indigenous population forming a national minority in Malaysia. They are the oldest inhabitants of Peninsular Malaysia.

As of 2017, the Orang Asli accounted for 0.7% of the population of Peninsular Malaysia. Although seldom mentioned in the country&#x27;s demographics, the Orang Asli are a distinct group, alongside the Malays, Chinese, Indians, and the indigenous East Malaysians of Sabah and Sarawak. Their special status is enshrined in law. Orang Asli settlements are scattered among the mostly Malay population of the country, often in mountainous areas or the jungles of the rainforest. 

While outsiders often perceive them as a single group, there are many distinctive groups and tribes, each with its own language, culture and customary land. Each group considers itself independent and different from the other communities. What mainly unites the Orang Asli is their distinctiveness from the three major ethnic groups of Peninsular Malaysia (ethnic Malays, Chinese, and Indian) and their historical sidelining in social, economic, and cultural matters. Like other indigenous peoples, Orang Asli strive to preserve their own distinctive culture and identity, which is linked by physical, economic, social, cultural, territorial, and spiritual ties to their immediate natural environment.

==Terminology==

Prior to the official use of the term &quot;Orang Asli&quot; beginning in the early 1960s, the common terms for the indigenous population of Peninsular Malaysia varied. Thomas John Newbold recorded that &quot;Malays&quot; of Rembau in present-day Negeri Sembilan had given their local forest-dwelling hunter-gathering population the contemporary name of &quot;orang benua&quot; () meaning &quot;people of the soil or country&quot;. Towards the end of British colonial rule on the Malay Peninsula, there were attempts to classify these disparate groups. Residents of the southern regions often called them &quot;Jakun&quot;, and those in the northern regions called them &quot;Sakai&quot;. Later on, all indigenous groups became known as &quot;Sakai&quot;, meaning &quot;Aborigines&quot;. The term &quot;aborigines&quot;, as an official name, appeared in the English version of the Constitution of British Malaya and the laws of the country. Past colonial rule by European and Islamic powers gave both the Malay word &quot;Sakai&quot; and the English term &quot;Aborigines&quot; pejorative connotations, hinting at the supposed backwardness and primitivism of these people. During the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s Communist rebels, seeking the support of the indigenous tribes, began referring to them as Orang Asal, meaning &quot;native people&quot;: the adjective &quot;asal&quot; itself from &quot;origin&quot;. The Communists won their support, and the government, seeking to do the same, began adopting the same terminology. Thus, the new, slightly modified term &quot;Orang Asli&quot;, carrying the same sense of &quot;original people&quot;, was born. The term was officially used in English, where it is identical in both the singular and the plural. Despite its origin as an exonym, the term was adopted by indigenous peoples themselves.

==Ethnogenesis==
The Orang Asli makes up one of 95 subgroups of indigenous people of Malaysia, the Orang Asal, each with their own distinct language and culture. The British colonial government classified the indigenous population of the Malay Peninsula on physiological and cultural-economic grounds upon which the Aboriginal Department (responsible for dealing with Orang Asli issues since the British Malaya government) developed their own classification of indigenous tribes based on their physical characteristics, linguistic kinship, cultural practices and geographical settlement. This divides Orang Asli into three main categories, with six ethnic subgroups each (totaling 18 ethnic subgroups). 
* Negrito (or Semang), generally located in the northern portion of the peninsula, were short dark-skinned nomadic hunter-gatherers with Asiatic facial features and tightly curly hair.
* Senoi (or Sakai), residing in the central region, were wavy-haired people taller than the Negrito, engaged in slash-and-burn agriculture, and periodically changed their place of residence.
* Proto-Malay (or Aboriginal Malay), living in the southern region, were settled farmers, lighter-skinned, of normal height, with straight hair. 

This division does not claim to be scientific and has many shortcomings. The boundaries between the groups are not fixed, and merge into each other, and the Orang Asli themselves use names associated with their specific area or by a local term meaning &#x27;human being&#x27;.

Semang are part of the earliest modern human migration that arrived Peninsular Malaysia 50 to 60 thousand years ago, while Senoi are part of Austroasiatic population that arrived Peninsular Malaysia 10 to 30 thousand⁸ year ago. Some earlier hypotheses pointed out the Semang and Senoi as descendants of the Hoabinhian people, Further research showed Semang shared genetic drift with ancient genomes from Hoabinhian ancestry, suggesting that they are genetically closer to the ancestors of Hoabinhian hunter-gatherers who occupied northern parts of Peninsular Malaysia during the late Pleistocene. Both groups speak Austroasiatic languages (also known as &quot;Mon-Khmer language&quot;). 

The Proto-Malays, who speak Austronesian languages, migrated to the area between 2000 and 1500 BCE during the Austronesian expansion. Along with the ethnic Malays, they originated from the seaborne migration of the Austronesian peoples, ultimately from Taiwan. It is believed that Proto-Malays were the first wave of Proto-Malayo-Polynesian speakers that settled Borneo and the western Sunda Islands initially, but didn&#x27;t penetrate Peninsula Malaysia due to preexisting populations of Austroasiatic speakers. Later Austronesian migrations from either western Borneo or Sumatra, settled the coastal areas of Peninsular Malaysia became the modern Malayic-speaking populations (&quot;Deutero-Malays&quot;). However, other authors have also concluded that there is no real distinction between Proto-Malays and Deutero-Malays, and both are descendants of a single migration event into Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia and southern Vietnam from western Borneo, This migration diverged into the modern speakers of the Malayic and Chamic branches of the Austronesian language family.

The Proto-Malays were originally considered ethnic Malay, but reclassified arbitrarily as part of Orang Asli by the British colonial authorities due to the similarity of their socio-economic and lifestyles with the Senoi and Semang. There are various degrees of admixture within all three groups. Only over time did indigenous peoples begin to identify themselves under the common name &quot;Orang Asli&quot; as a marker of collective identity as natives, distinct from the predominant ethnic groups more recently arrived to the peninsula. Orang Asli seldom associate themselves with the categories of &quot;Negrito&quot;, &quot;Senoi&quot; and &quot;Aboriginal Malays&quot;.

The Orang Asli Negrito share a common genetic origin with East Asian people, but each can be differentiated on a finer scale.

===Semang===
According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Malaysia&quot;, the Semang or Pangan are regarded as the earliest inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula. They live mainly in the northern regions of the country, and are considered to be mostly descended from the people of the Hoabinhian cultural period, with many of their burials found dating back 10,000 years ago.

They speak the Aslian languages branch of the Mon-Khmer language which is part of the Austroasiatic language family, as do their Senoi agriculturalist neighbours. Most of them belong to the North Aslian language group, and only the Lanoh language belongs to the Central Aslian languages group.

Negrito tribes:
As of 2010, the Semang number approximately 4,800. They mostly live in Perak (2,413 people, 48.2%), Kelantan (1,381 people, 27.6%) and Pahang (925 people, 18.5%). The remaining 5.7% of Semang are distributed throughout Malaysia.

===Senoi===
Senoi is the largest subdivision of the Orang Asli, accounting for about 54% of their population. This ethnic group includes six tribes: Temiar, Semai, Semaq Beri, Jah Hut, Mah Meri and Cheq Wong. They live mainly in the central and northern parts of the Malay Peninsula. Their villages are scattered in the states of Perak, Kelantan and Pahang, including on the slopes of the Titiwangsa Mountains.

Physically, the Senois in general differ from the indigenous tribals in terms of being taller in height, and having much lighter skin colour, and wavy hair. They were thought to have similar physical characteristics to the Mongoloid (now a discredited racial term) and even the Dravidians. Like the Semang, they also speak Aslian languages. Many Senoi are believed to be descendants of unions of Negritos with migrants from Indochina, probably Proto-Malays.

The term &quot;Senoi&quot; comes from the words sen-oi and seng-oi, which means &quot;people&quot; in Semai language and Temiar language, respectively.

The traditional economy of the Senoi people was based on jungle resources, where they would engage in hunting, fishing, foraging and logging. In contact with the Malay and Siamese states, the Senoi people were involved in trading and were the main suppliers of jungle produce in the region. Now most of them work in the agricultural sector and have their own farms to grow rubber, oil palm, or cocoa.

In the daily life of the Senoi people, the norms of customary laws are observed. Since the days of the colonial era, missionaries of world religions have been active among these jungle dwellers. Now some people among the tribes are adherents of Islam, Christianity, or Baháʼí Faith.

Senoi tribes:
===Aboriginal Malays===
Proto-Malays, or Aboriginal Malays, are the second largest group of Orang Asli, making up about 43%. This group consists of seven separate tribes: Jakun, Temuan, Temoq, Semelai, Kuala, Kanaq, and Seletar people. In the colonial period, they were all erroneously called Jakun people. They live mainly in the southern half of the peninsula, in the states of Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Pahang and Johor. Most of the settlements of the Aboriginal Malays are in the upper reaches of rivers and also along the coastal areas not pre-empted and taken over by the Malays.

Their customs, culture and languages are very similar to the Malaysian Malays. They are similar to the Malays in appearance, having a dark skin colour, straight hair and an epicanthic fold. Today, Aboriginal Malays are firmly settled people, mostly permanently employed in agriculture. Those who live on the river banks or on the coast are engaged in fishing. Many of them are also employed, and there are those who are engaged in entrepreneurial activities or work as professionals.

The group term covers tribes that are very distinct from each other. Temuan people, for example, have a long tradition of agriculture. The Orang Kuala and Orang Seletar, who live by the sea, are mainly engaged in the fishing and seafood industry. Semelai people and Temoq people differ from other groups in language.

The Aboriginal Malays are considered a race of people grouped within each smaller tribe of their own. These had long remained unaffected by foreign influences. The Aboriginal Malays are often distinguished from the Malaysian Malays because they are generally not Muslims. But the Orang Kuala converted to Islam before the independence of Malaysia. 

More significant is the differing origins of these sub-groups. In Indonesia and Malaysia, some believe there are two branches of the Austronesian peoples, identified as Proto-Malays and Deutero-Malays. According to this theory, the Proto-Malays inhabited the islands of the Sunda archipelago about 2,500 years ago. The migration of Deutero-Malays is attributed to later times, but more than 1,500 years ago. They mingled with the Proto-Malays who were already inhabiting the land, as well as with the Siamese, Javanese people, Sumatrans, Indian ethnic groups, Thai people, and Persian, Arab and Chinese merchants, resulting in the formation of the modern Malays of the Malay Peninsula. Although this theory has not been supported by scientific evidence, it is generally accepted in the attitude of the Malays toward the indigenous tribes.

Some of the Aboriginal Malay tribes, including the Orang Kanaq and Orang Kuala, are difficult to be regarded as indigenous to the Malay Peninsula, as they only migrated in the last few centuries, much later than the Malays. Most Orang Kuala still live on the eastern coast of Sumatra in Indonesia, where they are also known as the Duano people.

The languages of the Proto-Malays are archaic dialects of the Malay language. The only exceptions are the Semelai language and the Temoq language, which are part of the Aslian languages, as are the Senoi and Semang languages.

Aboriginal Malay tribes:
==Demography==
Malays make up just over 50% of Malaysia&#x27;s population, followed by Chinese (24%), Indians (7%) and the indigenous of Sabah and Sarawak (11%), while the remaining of Orang Asli is only 0.7%. Their population is approximately 148,000. The largest group are the Senois, constituting about 54% of the total Orang Asli population. The Proto-Malays form 43%, and the Semang forming 3%. Thailand is home to roughly 600 Orang Asli, divided between &quot;Mani people&quot; with Thai citizenship, and 300 others in the deep south. At the same time, the number of Orang Asli has been growing steadily for many years. Between 1947 and 1997, the average growth rate averaged at 4% per year. This is largely due to the overall improvement in the quality of life of indigenous people.

Population of the Orang Asli:


More than half of the Orang Asli live in the states of Pahang and Perak, followed by the indigenous peoples of Kelantan, Selangor, Johor, and Negeri Sembilan. In the states of Perlis and Penang, the Orang Asli are not considered indigenous. Their presence there indicates the mobility of the Orang Asli, as they come to the industrial areas of the country in search of employment opportunities.

Distribution of Orang Asli tribes by state: 


According to the 2006 census, the number of Orang Asli was 141,230. Of these, 36.9% lived in remote villages, 62.4% on the outskirts of Malay villages and 0.7% in cities and suburbs. Thus, the majority of the indigenous population are in rural areas. Some of them make regular trips between their native villages and the cities where they work. Orang Asli do not show much desire to permanently settle in cities because of the high cost of living for them. In addition, they feel out of place in urban communities due to differences in education and socio-economic status, as well as language and racial barriers.

The location of Orang Asli villages largely determines their accessibility and, consequently, the level of state aid they receive, as well as the participation of indigenous peoples in the economic life of the country and the level of their income. As a result, residents of villages located in different areas differ in living standards.

Orang Asli is the poorest community in Malaysia. The poverty rate among Orang Asli is 76.9%. According to the Department of Statistics of Malaysia in 2009, 50% of indigenous people in Peninsular Malaysia were below the poverty line, compared to 3.8% in the country as a whole. In addition to this high rate, the Statistics Department of Malaysia has classified 35.2% of the population as being &quot;very poor&quot;. The majority of Orang Asli live in rural areas, while a minority have moved into urban areas. In 1991, the literacy rate for the Orang Asli was 43% compared to the national rate of 86% at that time. They have an average life expectancy of 53 years (52 for male and 54 for female) against the national average of 73 years. The national infant mortality rate in Malaysia in 2010 was 8.9 children per 1,000 live births but among the Orang Asli the figure was at a maximum of 51.7 deaths per 1,000 births.

The Malaysian Government has undertaken various measures to eradicate the poverty level among the Orang Asli, many of them have been relocated from their nomadic and semi-nomadic dwelling to a permanent housing estate under the relocation program initiated by the government. These settlements are equipped with modern amenities including electricity, running water and school. They were also awarded plots of palm oil land to be cultivated and as a source of income. Other programmes initiated by the government includes various special scholarship for the Orang Asli children for their studies and entrepreneurship courses, training and monetary funds for Orang Asli adult. The Malaysian Government aims to increase the monthly household income for Orang Asli from RM 1,200.00 per-month in 2010 to RM 2,500.00 by year 2015.
Changes in the distribution of Orang Asli by religion (according to JAKOA and the Department of Statistics of Malaysia):


==Languages==

Linguistically the Orang Asli divide into two groups: from the Austroasiatic languages and the Austronesian languages family.

Northern groups (Senoi and Semang) speak languages that are grouped into a separate Aslian languages group, which form part of the Austroasiatic language family. On the basis of language, these peoples have historical ties with the indigenous peoples of Myanmar, Thailand and the larger Indochina. These are further divided into the Jahaic languages (North Aslian), Senoic languages, Semelaic languages (South Aslian), and Jah Hut language. The languages which fall under the Jahaic language sub-group are the Cheq Wong, Jahai, Bateq, Kensiu, Mintil, Kintaq, and Mendriq languages. The Lanoh language, Temiar language, and Semai language fall into the Senoic language sub-group. Languages that fall into the Semelaic sub-group include the Semelai language, Semoq Beri language, Temoq language, and Besisi language (language spoken by the Mah Meri people).

The second group that speaks Aboriginal Malay languages, except Semelai language and Temoq language, is very close to the standard Malay language, which form part of the Austronesian language family. These include the Jakun and Temuan languages among others. Semelai people and Temoq people speak Austroasiatic languages, with the latter are not distinguished in Malaysia as a separate people.

According to Geoffrey Benjamin, a leading specialist in the study of Aslian languages and project &quot;Ethnologue: Languages of the World (20th edition, 2017)&quot; classifies the 18 Orang Asli tribes of Peninsular Malaysia linguistically as the following:
*Austroasiatic languages

Although the study of Orang Asli began in the early 20th century, even by the 1960s there was very little professional research. Intensive early 1990s field research spawned a new wave of scholarly material and yet, these languages still remain only somewhat fully understood. There is a threat of extinction of certain Orang Asli languages. Almost all Orang Asli are now bilingual; in addition to their native language, they are also fluent Malay language, the national language of Malaysia. Malay is gradually displacing native languages, reducing their scope at the domestic level.

The role of lingua franca between Orang Asli speakers is usually played by the Semai language or Temiar language, which establishes a dominant presence. The state of the Northern Aslian languages also remains stable. Nomadic groups who speak them have little contact with the Malays, and although these populations are small, their languages are not threatened with extinction. Today, the Lanoh language belongs to the category of endangered languages, but among others, the Mah Meri language is in the greatest danger. The continuance of these languages can be found in radio broadcasts, which did not begin in Orang Asli until in 1959. &quot;Asyik.FM&quot; currently broadcasts daily in Radio Malaysia in Semai, Temyar, Teman and Jakun languages from 8 am to 11 pm. The channel is also available via the Internet.

In Malaysia, Orang Asli languages lack both natively-written literature and official status. However, some Baháʼí Faith and Christian missionaries, as well as JAKOA newsletters, produce printed materials in Aslian languages. Orang Asli value literacy, but they are unlikely to be able to support writing in their native language based on Malay or English. Private texts recorded by radio announcers is based on Malay and English writing and are amateur in nature. The authors face the problems of transcription and spelling, and the influence of the stamps characteristic of the standard Malay language is felt. A new phenomenon is an emergence of text messages in the Orang Asli language, which are distributed by their speakers, in particular, when using mobile phones. Unfortunately, due to fears of invasion of privacy, most of them are not made known to outsiders. Another development in the development of indigenous languages was the release of individual recordings of pop music in Aslian languages, which can be heard on &quot;Asyik FM&quot;.

In some states of Malaysia, attempts are being made to introduce Orang Asli languages into the educational process of primary school to bolster school attendance to benefit the overall Malaysian education system. Without sufficient studies and a standardisation of spelling these efforts have been unsuccessful.

==History==

===First settlers===

The earliest traces of modern humans in the Malay Peninsula, archaeologists date back to a period of about 75,000 years ago. Next, a number of evidence of ancient people living in the north of the peninsula were left about 40,000 years ago. The climate and geography of Southeast Asia at that time were vastly different from today. During the Ice age period, the sea level was much lower, the seabed between the islands of the Sunda archipelago was then land, and the Asian mainland extended to present-day Sumatra, Java, Bali, Kalimantan, Palawan, forming the so-called Sundaland.

Global warming about 10,000 years ago caused glacier melt and rising sea levels resulting in the formation of the Malayan peninsula by approximately 8,000 years ago. It is believed that the surviving prehistoric population were the ancestors of today&#x27;s Semang people. Recent genetic studies identify them as a relic group of people who are descendants of the first migrants who came from Africa between 44,000 and 63,000 years ago. This does not mean, however, that they have survived to this day in their original form. Over thousands of years, they have undergone local evolution. Thus, the Hoabinhian inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula were taller than the modern Semang people and did not belong to the Negrito race. Recent studies have also shown genetic differences between Semang people and other Negritos, such as the indigenous Andamanese peoples and those from the Philippine Islands. 

Evidence of early human occupation of the Peninsula includes prehistoric artefacts and cave paintings such as the Tambun rock art, which is estimated to be around 2,000 to 12,000 years old. About 6,000–6,500 years ago, climatic conditions stabilised. This period is marked by the appearance of the Neolithic on the Malay Peninsula, which is associated with the archaeological culture of Hòa Bình. New groups of people genetically related to the population of Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam arrived on the Malay Peninsula bringing new technologies, better tools, and ceramics. In the peninsula, slash-and-burn agriculture was commonly practiced. Traditionally, these migrants are associated with the ancestors of the Senoi people, but genetic studies suggest that the influx of new population was small, and migrants were mixed with locals.

According to Glottochronology data, speakers of Aslian languages appeared in the Malay Peninsula, dating from about 3,800 to 3,700 years ago. This is consistent with the peninsula ceramic tradition of Ban Kao from Central Thailand. During 2,800–2,400 years ago, the differentiation of the North Aslian language, Central Aslian languages and Southern Aslian languages began to develop.

===Early history===
Some groups of the Austronesian speakers began to arrive in the Malay Peninsula, probably from Kalimantan and Sumatra, in 1000 BCE. According to linguists, some of these early non-Malay arrivals are of Malayo-Polynesian peoples. These Proto-Malay tribes inhabited mostly small, geographically divided groups along the coast and along rivers, while the inner jungle areas remained entirely with the native population. Each group of Proto-Malays developed their local character, adapting to specific local conditions. The Southern Aslian speakers had the greatest contact with the newer population. It is believed that the ancestors of Jakun people and Temuan people who now speak Malay language, were native speakers of Aslian in the past.

The Orang Asli kept to themselves until the first traders from India arrived in the first millennium of the Common Era. Maritime trade routes brought traders from India, China, the Mon kingdoms located in modern-day Myanmar, and later from the Khmer Empire of Angkor, in search of local produce. Those living in the interior bartered inland products like resins, incense woods, and feathers for salt, cloth, and iron tools. From about 500 BCE, on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula and on either side of the Kra Isthmus, traders established their settlements, some of which later grew into large trading ports. At that time Kedah, in particular, was becoming an important center of international trade.

===Relations with Other Groups===

The development of the slave trade in the region was a powerful factor influencing the fate of the Orang Asli. The enslavement of Negrito tribes commenced as early as 724 CE, during the early contact of the Malay Srivijaya empire. Negrito pygmies from the southern jungles were enslaved, with some being exploited until modern times. Because Islam prohibited taking Muslims as slaves, slave hunters focused their capture on the Orang Asli explaining the Malay use &quot;sakai&quot; to mean &quot;slaves&quot; with its present derogatory connotation. In the early 16th century Aceh Sultanate, located in the north of the island of Sumatra, equipped special expeditions to capture slaves in the Malay Peninsula, and Malacca was at that time the largest center of the slave trade in the region. Raids on slaves in the villages of Orang Asli were common in the 18th and 19th centuries. During this time, Orang Asli groups suffered raids by the Minangkabau and Batak forces who perceived them to be of lower in status. Orang Asli settlements were sacked, with adult males being systematically executed while women and children were taken captive and sold into slavery. &quot;Hamba abdi&quot; (meaning, bondslaves) formed the labour force both in the cities and in the households of chiefs and sultans. They could be servants and concubines of a rich master, and slaves also did labour work in commercial ports.

However, the relationship between the Malays and Orang Asli was not always hostile, as many other groups enjoyed peaceful and cordial relation with their Malay neighbours. With the easement of mobility and contact between various groups of people, the walls that separated the myriad of historical Austroasiatic and Austronesian tribal communities who once dwelled across the peninsula were dismantled, being gradually drawn and integrated into the Malay society, identity, language, culture and belief system. These Malayised tribes and communities would later be part of the ancestors of present-day Malay people.

The new situation prompted many Orang Asli to migrate further inland to avoid contact with outsiders. These other smaller, closely related tribes; often located further inland compared to their coastal Malayised cousins, managed to be spared from the Malayisation process due to their secluded geographical location and nomadic and semi-nomadic lifestyle, hence preserving and developing their own endemic language, customs and pagan rituals. They were fragmented into small isolated tribal groups that occupied certain ecological niches, such as the river valley and had limited contact with neighbouring outsiders. Malay settlements were usually located on the coast or along rivers, as the Malays rarely crossed into the interior jungles. Nevertheless, some Orang Asli groups not completely isolated from their Malayalised brothers engaged in trade with the Malays. A minority of Orang Asli rejected assimilation including the indigenous tribes of the Malay Peninsula as well as the Orang Kanaq or the Orang Seletar who refused Islam.

===Colonial period===
The establishment of British colonial settlements in the peninsula brought further foreign influence into the lives of Orang Asli. The British colonial government began to recognise the Malays as &quot;natives&quot;, and the Orang Asli as &quot;aborigines&quot;, as the latter were subjects of the Malay rulers, marking the beginning of a policy of paternalism toward the Orang Asli. The British colonial administration formally banned all forms of slavery in the Malay Peninsula in 1884, but in practice, it continued to exist even in 1930. While the British authorities took little interest in the plight of Orang Asli, Christian missionaries began preaching to the Orang Asli. Anthropologists saw in the indigenous population of the peninsula an unploughed field for their study and an interesting subject for research.

During British rule, the ethnic character of the peninsula population changed significantly. The development of the colonial economy caused a significant influx of Chinese and Indian people. Chinese traders also appeared in the settlements of the Orang Asli. Due to the traditional antipathy to the Malays, the indigenous Orang Asli were more inclined to improve relations with the Chinese, who were perceived as reliable trading partners.

During the Japanese occupation of Malaya in the 1940s, most Orang Asli hid in the jungles bringing them into contact with the ethnic Chinese Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army also taking refuge in the jungle. With the end of World War II, the British returned to the Malay Peninsula. The Malayan Communist Party tried unsuccessfully to gain influence over the post-war government, and in 1948 the Communists returned to the jungle to launch an armed uprising triggering the Malayan Emergency which lasted from 1948 to 1960. Many secluded jungle Orang Asli villages became strategic locations frequented by the communist guerrillas of the Malayan National Liberation Army increasing cooperation between the two. The positive attitude of the Orang Asli towards the Chinese, in comparison with the Malays, was noticeable.

The British government understood the importance of the indigenous population in this situation and began to implement measures aimed at removing the Orang Asli from the influence of the Communists and encouraging them to support government forces. Strategically, the goal was to cut off the rebels from the bases and put an end to the uprising. Due to their perceived support for communist guerrillas, the first step was the implementation of a programme to forcibly relocate the Orang Asli from the areas of communist influence to the so-called &quot;new village&quot; system where they were sent to live in newly-constructed settlements controlled by the government under the Briggs Plan. Such a policy proved tragic for the indigenous population. Orang Asli crowds relocated hastily built resettlement camps. Hundreds of people detached from traditional lands have died in these overcrowded camps, mostly due to mental depression and infectious diseases.

Realising the absurdity and flaws of their actions, the British administration changed tactics. Two administrative initiatives were introduced to highlight the importance of the Orang Asli, as well as to protect their identity. First, the Department of Aborigines was established in 1950, which was to take over the implementation of state policy towards the Orang Asli. Secondly, the British abandoned the &quot;new villages&quot; and began to create so-called &quot;forts in the jungle&quot;, located within the traditional lands of indigenous communities. These reference points were provided with basic medical institutions, schools, and points of supply of basic consumer goods, designed for Orang Asli. Subsequently, the forts ceased their activities, and the Orang Asli began to create so-called exemplary settlements called Patterned Settlements. A number of Orang Asli communities have been relocated to these settlements, which are accessible to Aboriginal and Security Department officials and yet close to traditional indigenous ancestral lands. They promised to provide their residents with wooden houses on stilts, as well as modern amenities such as schools, hospitals and shops. They also had to grow commercial crops (rubber, palm oil) and practice animal husbandry in order to be able to participate in the monetary economy. This strategy was successful, and support for the rebels from the Orang Asli weakened.

Finally, an attempt was made to legislate to protect the indigenous population, the Aboriginal Peoples Ordinance resolution was enacted in 1954; which, with some modifications, still operates today. Thus, the circumstances of the State of Emergency had brought the Orang Asli out of isolation.

===Post-independence===
Malaysia declared independence in 1957. Shortly before the proclamation of independence, there were about 20,000 Muslims among the Orang Asli; after independence, most of them were recognised by the Malays. The rest continued to live in inland forest areas and adhere to their traditional way of life. They remained outside the country&#x27;s development until the late 1970s, forming a specific marginalized population. A 1961 government policy was created to develop and integrate Orang Asli communities into the wider Malaysian society. The Malaysian government retained the Department of Aborigines, but changed its name to the Malay, &quot;Jabatan Orang Asli&quot; (Department of Orang Asli, abbreviated JOA), later renaming it to &quot;Jabatan Hal Ehwal Orang Asli&quot; (Department of Orang Asli Affairs, abbreviated JHEOA), and finally since 2011, the &quot;Jabalan Kemajuan Orang Asli&quot; (Department of Orange Asli Development, abbreviated JAKOA). This procession of government bureaus existed to manage the Orang Asli communities, providing them with medical care, education, and economic development. The Aboriginal People Act 1954, which gave JHEOA broad powers to control the Orang Asli, also remained in force. State intervention in the life of the indigenous population during the years of independence intensified markedly and measures shifted from preservation of the Orang Asli to their full assimilation into Malay society. 

In the late 1960s, the Malayan Communist Party resumed its armed struggle and began the so-called Second Malayan Emergency (1968–1989). Again, the main rebel bases located in the inner jungle areas drew government attention to the Orang Asli as a likely ally of the rebels. A military decision was made to physically remove the Orang Asli from their traditional environment. In 1977 a new project for the resettlement of indigenous people was presented, and it was now called the Regroupment Schemes (&quot;Rancangan Pengumpulan Semula&quot;, RPS). Given the mistakes of the past, the process of &quot;regrouping&quot; also involved the implementation of development programmes, and the regrouping schemes themselves were created within the customary lands of the respective Orang Asli communities or close to them. In addition to the provision of medical and educational services, the participants in the schemes were provided with permanent land plots for housing construction and homesteading. They were also involved in one form or another in income-generating activities, mainly the cultivation of commercial crops such as rubber and oil palm. 

The 1980s were a turning point in the history of the Orang Asli. During this decade, the pace of economic development in Malaysia was the highest, as Malaysia began to experience a period of sustained growth characterised by modernisation, industrialisation, and land development, which resulted in seizure of Orang Asli land. Logging and the replacement of jungles with plantations have become widespread, further encroaching on traditional Orang Asli resources. 

Government policy towards integration took the form of Islamisation. The Malaysian government established an institution of Islamic missionary work, Dawah, which was to operate in indigenous communities. Special community development officials, &quot;Pegawai Pemaju Masyarakat&quot; were appointed, and public buildings, &quot;Balai Raya&quot; are equipped with Muslim prayer halls called &quot;Surau&quot; that were built in the villages of Orang Asli. JHEOA tried to provide converts to Islam with housing, water and electricity, and vehicles. They were paid for schooling, provided with scholarships for university studies, and created better opportunities in the field of health care, in terms of income and promotion in the civil service.

The policy of &quot;positive discrimination&quot; provoked a negative reaction in the Orang Asli communities. Many of them refused to convert to Islam, even in spite of the advantages afforded to them. Others, in response to the situation, out of poverty nominally converted to Islam, but made no effort to change their religious beliefs or behaviour.

Indigenous responses to the seizure of their customary lands and resources ranged from a repressed tacit perception of the situation and simple political lobbying of their interests to loud protests and demands for legal protection. In response to this encroachment, a landmark mobilisation in 1976 created the Peninsular Malaysia Orang Asli Association (&quot;Persatuan Orang Asli Semenanjung Malaysia&quot;, POASM). POASM became a focal point that integrated the grievances and needs of Orang Asli communities. The organisation&#x27;s popularity grew, and in 2011 it had about 10,000 members. In 1998, POASM became a collective member of the Malaysian Indigenous Network (&quot;Jaringan Orang Asal SeMalaysia&quot;, abbreviated JOAS), an informal association of indigenous organisations and movements in Sabah, Sarawak, and Peninsular Malaysia. Slowing in POASM advocacy led to the creation of Network of Orang Asli Peninsular Malaysia Villages (&quot;Jaringan Kampung Orang Asli Semenanjung Malaysia&quot;), an informal association of Orang Asli, advocating for the rights of the country&#x27;s indigenous peoples and representing the Orang Asli&#x27;s interests to the government and the general public. The Centre for Orang Asli Concerns (COAC), established in 1989, provides assistance in this regard. The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development brought more attention to traditional knowledge and rights of the indigenous peoples like the Orang Asli. The United Nations&#x27; declaration of 1994-2003 as the International Decade of the World&#x27;s Indigenous People also had a positive effect. Orang Asli are now known as &quot;Orang Kita&quot; (&quot;our people&quot;) following the introduction of the &quot;One Malaysia&quot; concept by then-Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak.

==Culture==

The way of life and management of certain groups of Orang Asli differs markedly. There are three main traditions that existed in the past, the nomadic hunter-gatherers Semangs, the settled population engaged in slash-and-burn agriculture Senois, and settled farmers who additionally collect jungle produce for sale Proto-Malays. Each of these traditions corresponds to a certain social structure of society.

About 40% of Orang Asli, including the Temiar people, Cheq Wong people, Jah Hut people, Semelai people, and Semaq Beri people, continue to live in or near jungles. Here they are engaged in slash-and-burn agriculture (growing Upland rice on the hills), as well as hunting and gathering. In addition, these communities sell foraged jungle resources (petai, durian, rattan, wild rubber) in exchange for money. Coastal communities (Orang Kuala, Orang Seletar and Mah Meri people) are mainly engaged in fishing and seafood harvesting. Others, including Temuan people, Jakun people and Semai people, are constantly engaged in agriculture, and now also have their own plantations for growing rubber, oil palm and cocoa. Very few Orang Asli, especially among Negrito groups (such as the Jahai people and Lanoh people), still lead a semi-nomadic lifestyle and prefer to enjoy the seasonal bounties of the jungle. Many Orang Asli also lives in cities where they work as hired workers.

Nomadic groups, such as the Jahai people and Batek people, live in families that occasionally gather together in temporary camps and then separate from each other again, but to reunite in a new camp and in a different composition. Some agricultural groups, such as the Temiar people, are organised into extended families and small groups linked by a common origin. They trace their descent from a common ancestor along both male and female lineages. The Semang and Senoi ethnic groups are politically and socially egalitarian, where everyone in the community is completely autonomous. If they have their leaders, they exercise only temporary situational power, which is based solely on the personal authority of a certain person. Such a leader has no real authority. At the same time, some southern groups, including the Semelai people, the Jakun people, and the Temuan people, had their own hereditary &quot;batin&quot; (meaning, village head) leaders in the past.

All Orang Asli consider their customary territories to be free for gathering by all members of the community. In some groups, individual families have exclusive rights to the agricultural land they cultivate, which they have cleared from the jungle on their own. However, when such a field is abandoned and overgrown with jungle, it returns to the common property of the whole community.

One remarkable feature of Orang Asli communities is that they prohibit any interpersonal violence, both within their groups and in relationships with outsiders. Their survival strategy has traditionally been to avoid contact with the country&#x27;s dominant populations, and they teach their children to refrain from all forms of violence.

The rules governing marriage differ from one tribe to another Orang Asli. In Semangs, social structures are adapted to the nomadic way of life of hunter-gatherers. They are forbidden to marry and have intimate relations with blood or related relatives through marriage. These rules of exogamy require one to look for a spouse among distant groups, thus creating a wide network of social ties. The tradition of Senoi is associated with the practice of slash-and-burn agriculture. Their local groups are more stable than those of the Semangs, therefore the prohibition of marriages between relatives is not so strict, as a result, family ties are concentrated within a certain river valley. The Malay tradition is associated with a sedentary lifestyle, so Malays and Aboriginal Malays prefer to marry within a village or locality, and marriages between cousins are allowed. This practice of local endogamy strengthens people&#x27;s commitment to their own economic system and keeps them from accepting other traditions. Such differences in views on the rules of marriage allowed for several thousand years to coexist side by side and not to intermarry with groups with very different economic complexities.

Traditional Orang Asli religions consist of complex systems of beliefs and worldviews that give these people the concept of the meaning of the world, the meaning of human life, and the moral code of conduct. Orang Asli is traditionally animists, where they believe in the presence of spirits in various objects. It allows the indigenous people to be in constant harmony with the natural environment. Most Orang Asli believes that the universe consists of three worlds, namely the celestial upper world, the terrestrial middle world, and the subterranean lower world. All three worlds are inhabited by various supernatural beings (spirits, ghosts, deities), which can be both helpful and harmful to humans. Some of these supernatural beings are individualised entities that have their own names and are associated with specific natural phenomena, such as thunderstorms, floods, or fruit ripening. Most Orang Asli believes in the &quot;God of Thunder&quot;, who will punish people by sending them a terrible storm.

Traditional Orang Asli rituals are designed to maintain a harmonious relationship between humans and supernatural beings. They offer sacrifices to the spirits, praise and gratitude, ask permission to kill animals during hunting, cut down trees, plant cultivated plants, and ask for abundant harvests of wild fruits. More complex rituals are performed by shamans, many of whom have their own spiritual guides in the spirit world. Most of these people believe that spells can cure diseases or ensure success in any field of activity, usually with the help of supernatural beings. During those ritual sessions, the shaman falls into a trance, and his soul goes to travel the worlds, looking for the lost souls of sick people, or meets with supernatural beings and asks them for help.

However, in the 21st century, many of them have also embraced monotheistic religions such as Islam and Christianity following some active state-sponsored dakwah by Muslims, and evangelism by Christian missionaries. Pahang Islamic Religious and Malay Customs Council (&quot;Majlis Ugama Islam Dan Adat Resam Melayu Pahang&quot;, MUIP) filed new Orang Asli Muslim converts from Pahang in 2015 alone. On June 4, 2007, an Orang Asli church was allegedly torn down by the state government in Gua Musang, Kelantan. In January 2008, a suit was filed against the Kelantan state authorities. The affected Orang Asli also sought a declaration under Article 11 of the Constitution of Malaysia that they have the right to practice the religion of their choice and to build their own prayer house. A major scandal involving the deaths of several escapee Orang Asli students led to a discussion over the role of religious indoctrination in schools and forced conversion of Orang Asli community to Islam by the state government.

The lifestyle of certain Orang Asli groups that were formed for many centuries, has resulted in the way of solving practical problems and opportunities that these people faced in specific natural and social conditions. Orang Asli communities demonstrate how social life can be reconciled without a hierarchical political system as an intermediary, but instead with gender equality, a combination of close cooperation and mutual assistance with personal autonomy.

Some of their methodology, which the Orang Asli themselves take for granted, seems to gain the attention of Westerners. Andy Hickson and his mother, Sue Jennings, after living in the Temiar community for more than a year, not only appreciated the nation&#x27;s social heritage but also began to apply it in their practice. Andy Hickson, who works as a consultant in the education system, began to use interactive methods of Temiar people in the fight against the phenomenon of intimidation of students. Therapist Sue Jennings applies aspects of the Temiar ritual traditions in her group therapy sessions.

==Status in society==

The Aboriginal Peoples Act is the only law that specifically applies to the Orang Asli. It defines and describes in detail the terms and concepts for recognising the status of Orang Asli communities. Legally, Orang Asli is defined as members of an indigenous ethnic group who are of such origin or who have been admitted into the community by adoption, or they are children from mixed marriages with the indigenous, provided that they speak the indigenous language and follow the way of life, customs and beliefs of the indigenous people. Preservation of the traditional way of life involves the reservation of land for the Orang Asli. Legislation of such matters concerning the Orang Asli is the National Land Code 1965, Land Conservation Act 1960, Protection of Wildlife Act 1972, National Parks Act 1980, and most importantly the Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954. The Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954 provides for the setting up and establishment of the Orang Asli Reserve Land. However, the Act also includes the power according to the Director-General of the JHEOA to order Orang Asli out of such reserved land at its discretion, and award compensation to affected people, also at its discretion. The state government may also revoke the reserve status of these lands at any time, and the Orang Asli will have to relocate, and even in the event of such relocation, the state government is not obliged to pay any compensation or allocate an alternative site to the affected Orang Asli victims. A landmark case on this matter is in the 2002 case of &quot;Sagong bin Tasi &amp; Ors v Kerajaan Negeri Selangor&quot;. The case was concerned with the state government using its powers conferred under the 1954 Act to evict Orang Asli from gazetted Orang Asli Reserve Land. The High Court ruled in favour of Sagong Tasi, who represented the Orang Asli, and this decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. Nevertheless, customary land disputes between Orang Asli and the state government still occurs from time to time. In 2016, the Kelantan state government was sued due to a dispute over land by Orang Asli.

The department has broad powers, including controlling the entry of outsiders into the areas of Orang Asli settlements, the appointment and dismissal of village heads (&quot;batins&quot;), the ban on planting any specific plants on Orang Asli lands, the issuance of permits for deforestation, jungle harvesting produce, hunting in traditional areas of Orang Asli, as well as determining the conditions under which Orang Asli can be hired. When appointing village elders, JAKOA focuses primarily on the candidate&#x27;s knowledge of the Malay language and his ability to follow instructions. The final decision in all matters concerning the Orang Asli are decided by the authorized state official, the General Director of JAKOA. The department is the de facto &quot;landowner&quot; of the Orang Asli territories, it also shapes the general decisions of the communities, and essentially effectively keeps the Orang Asli in the status of its &quot;children&quot;, acting as their state guardian infantilising them in ways not applied to the Malays or natives in Sabah and Sarawak.

While Malays have been considered a &quot;native people&quot; in Malaysia since colonial times, the Orang Asli, according to local notions, are communities of &quot;primitive&quot; people who never formed an &quot;effective statehood&quot; and were dependent on the Malay state with political status determined by the practice of Islam, knowledge of the Malay language, and compliance with the norms of Malay society preferring that the Orang Asli &quot;masuk Melayu&quot; which is &quot;to become a Malay.&quot;The Malaysian state government does not recognise the Orang Asli as a &quot;people&quot; at all in the sense as defined in United Nations documents. The Orang Asli&#x27;s &quot;nativeness&quot; is their attempt to defend a broader political autonomy. Recently, some Orang Asli groups, with the support of volunteer lawyers, have made some progress in asserting their constitutional rights to customary lands and resources in the courts. They demanded compensation in accordance with the principles of common law and the international rights of indigenous peoples.

In the early 1970s, the government began to introduce New Economic Policy (NEP), as part of which created a new class of people &quot;bumiputera&quot;, &quot;sons of the soil&quot;. The Orang Asli are classified as &quot;bumiputera&quot;s, a status signifying indigeneity to Malaysia which carries certain social, economic, and political rights, along with the Malays and the natives of Sabah and Sarawak. Based on their initial presence on this land, the &quot;bumiputera&quot; received economic and political advantages over other non-native groups. In addition to special economic &quot;rights&quot;, the &quot;bumiputera&quot; enjoy the support of the state government in terms of the development of their religion, culture, language, preferences in the field of education, and in holding positions in government and government agencies. However, this status is generally not mentioned in the constitution. In reality, &quot;bumiputera&quot; as a form of Malay supremacy policy is used as a political means for the furtherance of the political dominance of the Malay community in the country. The indigenous people of East Malaysia Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia are practically perceived as &quot;lower &quot;bumiputera&quot; &quot;pribumi&quot;s, and as for the Orang Asli in particular, the Federal Constitution does not even mention them under the label &quot;bumiputera&quot;&quot;. The status of a &quot;bumiputera&quot; has little or no benefit to most Orang Asli. They continue to be a dependent (ward) category of the population.

Malaysia&#x27;s fourth and seventh prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, made controversial remarks regarding the Orang Asli, saying that Orang Asli were not entitled more rights than Malays even though they were natives to the land, as posted on his blog comparing the Orang Asli in Malaysia to Native Americans in the United States, Māori in New Zealand, and Aboriginal Australians. He was criticised by spokespeople and advocates for the Orang Asli who said that the Orang Asli desired to be recognised as the true natives of Malaysia and that his statement would expose their land to businessmen and loggers.

Orang Asli have equal voting rights with other citizens of the country, participate in national and state elections. In addition, in order to involve them in the legislative process in parliament, since 1957, five senators from among the Orang Asli have been appointed. However, the Orang Asli have no real representation in state bodies. The situation is complicated by the fact that the organisation or person who has the right to represent the interests of a particular indigenous community is determined by the state government. Therefore, in their activities, such representatives do not reflect the thoughts, needs and aspirations of their community, and moreover, are they are not accountable to it. A clear example of the current situation is the case when in June 2001 one of the Orang Asli senators raised in the Malaysian &quot;Dewan Negara&quot; Senate the question of the inexpediency of spending funds that the state government directed to the introduction of the Semai language in school.

==Modernisation==

Since independence in 1957, the Malaysian government has begun to develop comprehensive Orang Asli community development programmes. The first stage, designed for the period 1954–1978, focused on security aspects and aimed to protect the Orang Asli from the influence of the communists. In the second phase, which began in the late 1970s, the government began to focus on the socio-economic development of the Orang Asli communities.

In 1980, the state began creating Orang Asli settlements under the so-called &quot;Rancangan Pengumpulan Semula&quot; (RPS), a &quot;regrouping scheme&quot;. There were established 17 RPS with 6 in the state of Perak, 7 in the state of Pahang, 3 in the state of Kelantan and 1 in the state of Johor; totaling of 3,015 families that lived in them. The RPS scheme targeted remote and scattered settlements and was to organise Orang Asli agricultural activities as their main source of livelihood. Programmes for the introduction of commercial crops, such as rubber trees, oil palm, coconut palm, and fruit trees, were implemented. These programmes were implemented mainly by two government agencies, namely the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority (RISDA) and the Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA Berhad). Each family received up to ten acres of land as part of large plantations and two more acres for housing and homesteading. JHEOA provided people with tools, seedlings, herbicides and fertilisers for farming.

Eventually, the RPS became a model for modernising the Orang Asli economy. In 1999 a restructuring of village project called &quot;Penyusunan Semula Kampung&quot; (PSK) was approved and implemented, which provides for the modernisation of basic infrastructure and public services in existing Orang Asli villages, whose residents began to receive the same incentives and benefits as the RPS participants. As of 2004, the project covered 217 Orang Asli villages. 545 Orang Asli villages (63%) were supplied with electricity, and 619 villages (71%) received water supply. A 2,910 km of rural roads was also built, and they provide access to 631 (73%) Orang Asli villages.

Recently, economic development has spread to inland areas. A special programme &quot;Program Bersepadu Daerah Terpencil&quot; (PROSDET) is focused on the development of settlements located in remote areas and inaccessible to any type of vehicle. A pilot project under this scheme is being implemented in the village of Pantos, located in the Kuala Lipis region, Pahang. The programme covers 200 families.

The Malaysian government seeks to eradicate poverty among its citizens, including the Orang Asli community. In order for them to compete in the labour market, the government considers it important to teach the Orang Asli the skills needed to do so. As part of its economic development programmes, JAKOA opens training courses in crop and livestock care, entrepreneurship courses, material assistance and equipment for indigenous people to start their own businesses such as grocery stores, restaurants, mechanic shops, Internet cafes, construction companies, fishing, potato, lime, aquaculture of tilapia, poultry, goats, and so forth, with funds allocated for the construction of premises for business space, where Orang Asli entrepreneurs could operate and sell their products. JAKOA organises trainings and develops training programmes for Orang Asli under the Training and Employment Programme known as &quot;Program Latihan Kemahiran &amp; Kerjaya&quot; (PLKK). In addition, Orang Asli community members are allowed to invest in shares in Amanah Saham Bumiputera, a fund management company owned by the government, reserved for the &quot;bumiputera&quot;s only.

==Socio-economic situation==

&quot;Jabatan Hal Ehwal Orang Asli&quot; (Department of Orang Asli Affairs, JHEOA), a government agency that was first set up in 1954 is entrusted to oversee the affairs of the Orang Asli under the Malaysian Ministry of Rural Development. Among its stated objectives are to eradicate poverty among the Orang Asli, improving their health, promoting education, and improving their general livelihood. There is a high incidence of poverty among the Orang Asli who belong to the poorest group of the Malaysian population. In 1997, 80% of all Orang Asli lived below the poverty line; extremely high compared to the national poverty rate of 8.5%. 50.9% of households, according to the United Nations Development Programme in 2007 lived in poverty, and 15.4% hardcore poverty living below the poverty line. These figures contrast sharply with the national figures of 7.5% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2010, according to the Department of Statistics Malaysia, 76.9% of the Orang Asli population remained below the poverty line, with 35.2% classified as living in hard-core poverty, compared to 1.4% nationally.

Other indicators also indicate a low quality of life in the Orang Asli. This is indicated, in particular, by the lack of basic amenities in many families such as plumbing, toilet, and often electricity. Thus, in 1997, according to the Department of Statistics of Malaysia, only 47.5% of Orang Asli households had some form of water supply, both indoors and outdoors, with 3.9% dependent only on other water sources such as rivers, streams and wells to meet their water needs. Toilets, as a basic convenience, were lacking in 43.7% of Orang Asli housing units, while for Peninsular Malaysia in general this figure was only three percent. 51.8% of Orang Asli households used kerosene lamps to light their homes.

Another indicator of low wealth is the lack of basic household items in many Orang Asli families; including refrigerators, radios, televisions, bicycles, motorcycles, cars, and so on, which may reflect the state of their well-being. According to the same Department of Statistics, in 1997 almost a quarter (22.2%) of all Orang Asli households did not have any of these household items. Only 35% of Orang Asli households in rural areas had motorcycles, which is an important mode of transportation.

The government sees the causes of poverty in the Orang Asli communities includes excessive dependence on jungle foraging, living in remote and inaccessible areas, low self-esteem and isolation from other communities, low level of education, low or no savings, lack of modern skills for employment, land encroachment and lack of land ownership, and excessive dependence on state aid.

Customary lands and resources have been the only source of livelihood for the Orang Asli for centuries. Most Orang Asli still maintains a close physical, cultural, and spiritual connection with the environment in traditional areas. Relocation to other areas as part of development programmes deprives them of this connection and forces them to adapt to new living conditions. The appropriation of traditional Orang Asli lands by the state and private individuals and companies, deforestation, the creation of rubber and oil palm plantations, and the development of tourism are destroying the foundations of the traditional indigenous economy. This forces many of these people to move to a sedentary lifestyle in villages or urban areas. The loss of customary lands becomes a trap for them, leading them into poverty.

During the years of independence in Malaysia, there has been a marked improvement in the provision of medical care for the Orang Asli and the availability of treatment and prevention facilities for them. However, there are still many problems. Health standards among Orang Asli communities remain low compared to other communities. More than others, they are exposed to various infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid fever and more. The problem of malnutrition is also urgent among Orang Asli, particularly among children. Access to information on the health status of residents of remote settlements and the availability of medical facilities there is generally limited.

Due to the lack of proper education, Orang Asli cannot be competitive in society at large leading them into dependence upon JAKOA.

Under the 1954 Aboriginal Peoples Act, the Malaysian government can &quot;degazette&quot; the land of the Orang Asli at any time, which has no obligation to give fair compensation. In 2013 the Malaysian state attempted to weaken this legislation, which would have cost the Orang Asli 645,000 hectares of their ancestral land. The Orang Asli are frequently targeted by the Malaysian state for conversion to Islam and assimilation by the bumiputra. In the state of Kelantan, Malay Muslim men were paid 10,000 ringgit, or about US$2,200 in 2022, to marry an Orang Asli woman.

<text>The Battle of Sadras was the first of five largely indecisive naval battles fought between a British fleet (under Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes) and a French fleet (under Admiral Pierre Suffren) off the east coast of India during the Anglo-French War. Fought on 17 February 1782 near present-day Kalpakkam, the battle was tactically indecisive, but the British fleet suffered the most damage. Under Suffren&#x27;s protection, French troop transports were able to land at Porto Novo, present-day Parangipettai.

==Background==
France had entered the American Revolutionary War in 1778, and Britain had declared war on the Dutch Republic in late 1780 after the Dutch refused to stop trading with the French and the Americans. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the Second Anglo-Mysore War in the process.

The French admiral Bailli de Suffren was dispatched for military assistance to French colonies in India, leading a fleet of five ships of the line, seven transports, and a corvette to escort transports from Brest in March 1781. Suffren was involved in a happenstance battle with a British fleet at Porto Praya in the Cape Verde Islands in April. In October, he left reinforcement troops at the Dutch-controlled Cape of Good Hope to assist with colonial defense. Suffren added some ships to his fleet and sailed on to the Île de France (present-day Mauritius), arriving at Port Louis in December.

After further additions at Port Louis, Suffren&#x27;s fleet sailed for India under the command of the elderly Navy Brigadier General Thomas d&#x27;Estienne d&#x27;Orves, accompanying transports carrying nearly 3,000 men under the command of the Comte du Chemin. D&#x27;Orves died in February 1782, shortly before the fleet arrived off the Indian coast, and Suffren once again took command.

Suffren first sailed for Madras, hoping to surprise the British stronghold there. Encountering Hughes&#x27;s fleet anchored in Madras on 15 February 1782, Suffren turned south. He intended to land troops at Porto Novo, march up the coast and recapture French and Dutch holdings on the way. Hughes raised anchor and sailed after Suffren.

==Battle==

Suffren was hampered with protecting his troop convoys from Hughes, whose goal he presumed was to prevent the troops from landing. Detaching one corvette to protect the convoy and detailing another to watch the British fleet, Suffren attempted to draw Hughes away. However, under cover of night Hughes managed to slip between Suffren&#x27;s squadron and the convoys. The signal was raised on the morning of 17 February, and Suffren gave chase to force battle.

When the fleets closed for action around 15:30, some of Suffren&#x27;s ships had not properly formed the line of battle. Only five of the French ships engaged at first. Of the remaining six, only two joined the action later, with the other four apparently violating Suffren&#x27;s orders and hanging back. Suffren, leading in &quot;Héros&quot;, exchanged a broadside with &quot;Exeter&quot; before targeting Hughes&#x27;s flagship &quot;Superb&quot;. The battle lasted for over three hours, with &quot;Exeter&quot; sustaining the most damage. She was nearly sunk, but two French ships were recalled (for reasons unknown) before they could inflict enough damage to cause her to sink. &quot;Superb&quot; also suffered significant damage. The battle came to end with the onset of night.

==Aftermath==
Suffren summoned his captains for council and chastised those who had chosen to stay out of the battle before following the troop convoy to Porto Novo. There the French army had landed, and Suffren met with the Mysorean ruler Hyder Ali to plan strategy. After making repairs, Suffren set off to find Hughes again. The French and Mysorean forces captured Cuddalore, just north of Porto Novo, on 4 April. Hughes sailed for Trincomalee, where he made repairs.

<text>is a Japanese word meaning &quot;ignore&quot;, &quot;take no notice of&quot; or &quot;treat with silent contempt&quot;. It is composed of two kanji: (&quot;moku&quot; &quot;silence&quot;) and (&quot;satsu&quot; &quot;killing&quot;). It is frequently cited to argue that problems encountered by Japanese in the sphere of international politics arise from misunderstandings or mistranslations of their language.

In 1945, &quot;mokusatsu&quot; was used in Japan&#x27;s initial rejection of the Potsdam Declaration, the Allied demand that Japan surrender unconditionally in World War II. To this day, the argument, or myth, that &quot;mokusatsu&quot; was misunderstood, and that the misunderstanding interrupted a negotiation for a peaceful end to the war, still resurfaces from time to time. The consensus of modern historians is that the Allies had understood the word correctly.

==Usage==
It was the adoption of this term by the government of Japan that first gave rise to the prominence of the word abroad. In 1945, &quot;mokusatsu&quot; was used in Japan&#x27;s initial rejection of the Potsdam Declaration, where the Allies demanded Japan to surrender unconditionally in World War II. This was understood to mean that Japan had rejected those terms, which contributed to President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s decision to carry out the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and implied that in spurning the terms, Japan had brought down on its own head the destruction of those two cities.

In 1950, an argument emerged claiming that &quot;mokusatsu&quot; had been misunderstood by the Allies due to a mistranslation that interpreted the word to signify &quot;ignore&quot; rather than &quot;withhold comment.&quot; The third edition of the authoritative Kenkyūsha Japanese-English dictionary (1954) responded by adding an innovative gloss to its former definitions by stating that it also bore the meaning of &#x27;remain in a wise and masterly inactivity&#x27;. However, the context around the word makes the intended meaning clear, and even if the new definition added in 1954 was used, it would not change the overall meaning of the statement. The innovative gloss about &#x27;wise ... inactivity&#x27; was removed in the Fourth Edition (1974).

==Context==
The Allies were aware that within the Japanese government an attempt to reach a negotiated termination of hostilities had been underway, especially via diplomatic contacts with Moscow, which was still neutral. On 12 July 1945 Tōgō Shigenori, the Japanese Foreign Minister, asked Naotake Sato to inform Moscow, on behalf of the Emperor, that Japan had no alternative but to see the war through to the end using an all-out war effort if England and the United States were to persist in demanding an unconditional surrender.

The Potsdam declaration presented one further occasion for mediation, but it was strongly opposed by the War Minister General Korechika Anami, with backing from the army and navy chiefs of staff, all demanding that the Declaration be rejected with a broadcast containing a point by point rebuttal. The Army also demanded that the public be kept unaware of the Declaration. In a compromise, Shigenori gained a Cabinet consensus to have the Declaration translated and released to the public, but in a censored version that deleted mentions of an imminent &quot;utter destruction of the Japanese homeland&quot;, &quot;stern justice&quot; for all war criminals, that disarmed soldiers would be allowed to return home to live constructive lives in peace, and comments about &quot;self-willed military cliques&quot;. The version given to the public was issued by the &#x27;tightly controlled press&#x27; through the Dōmei News Service.

In this form it appeared in the morning edition of the on 28 July 1945, to designate the attitude assumed by the government to the Potsdam Declaration. This newspaper and others clearly stated that the ultimatum, which had not only been transmitted to the Japanese government diplomatically via Swiss intermediaries but also to the Japanese public via radio and airdropped leaflets, was formally rejected by the Imperial Government. Later that day in a press conference, the Premier Suzuki Kantarō himself publicly used it to dismiss the Potsdam Declaration as a mere rehash () of earlier rejected Allied proposals, and therefore, being of no value.

The key part of the statement was translated into English by Dōmei Press as &quot;the Japanese government ignores this, and we are determined to continue our bitter fight to the end.&quot;

Three postwar translations of Suzuki&#x27;s statement in context exist:

and:

Suzuki apparently recognized that the Potsdam declaration flagged an intention to end a war which, in logistical terms, Japan was no longer capable of sustaining. However Article 6 stated that the militarists would be stripped of their authority and power forever, and the Japanese army was resolutely opposed to its own thorough dismantlement, and heavy pressure was brought to bear on the Prime Minister therefore to have him reject the declaration.

Suzuki&#x27;s stating that the declaration&#x27;s terms would be literally &quot;killed off by silent contempt&quot; () reflected this necessity of placating the extreme position of the army. Historian John Toland also argued decades later that Suzuki&#x27;s choice of the term was dictated more by the need to appease the military, which was hostile to the idea of &quot;unconditional surrender&quot;, than to signal anything to the Allies.

Although may not have been intended to communicate to the Allies a refusal to surrender, the Potsdam ultimatum nevertheless allowed for only one acceptable answer: unconditional surrender. Any other answer would, as the declaration warned, cause &quot;prompt and utter destruction&quot;. It was only after the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by atomic bombs, two assassination attempts on the then Prime Minister Suzuki Kantarō, an attempted military coup against the Emperor, and declaration of war by the Soviet Union that the Emperor himself broadcast acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration that resulted in Japan&#x27;s unconditional surrender, which ended the Pacific War.

==Postwar controversy==
Five years after the end of World War II, Kazuo Kawai, a lecturer in Far Eastern history at Stanford University, first raised the idea that an incorrect translation directly led to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Kawai based his argument on notes and diaries written at the time, notes taken while he covered the discussions underway in Japan&#x27;s Foreign Office regarding the Declaration. Kawai argued that both the choice of this term and the meaning given to it by Allied authorities led to a fatal &#x27;tragedy of errors&#x27; involving both Japanese bureaucratic bungling and a &#x27;deficiency in perception&#x27; by Japan&#x27;s enemies. Kawai&#x27;s point was then taken up by William J. Coughlin in a widely read article for &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; magazine three years later.

In some reconstructions that espouse this interpretation, it is stated that it was probably Hasegawa Saiji, a translator for Dōmei Press, who translated this as: &quot;The Japanese ignores this, and we are determined to continue our fight until the end&quot; and the foreign press picked this up, taking &quot;ignore&quot; to mean &quot;reject&quot;.

The NSA Technical Journal published an article endorsing this view, that the word&#x27;s meaning was ambiguous, in which readers are warned of the consequences of not making ambiguities clear when translating between languages. It concluded:

To this day, the argument, or myth, that &quot;mokusatsu&quot; was misunderstood, and that the misunderstanding interrupted a negotiation for a peaceful end to the war, still resurfaces from time to time.

The consensus of modern historians is that the Allies had understood the word correctly. Chalmers Johnson wrote in 1980:

<text>The MG 15 was a German 7.92 mm machine gun designed specifically as a hand-manipulated defensive gun for combat aircraft during the early 1930s. By 1941 it was replaced by other types and found new uses with ground troops.

== History ==
The MG 15 was developed from the MG 30, which was designed by Rheinmetall using the locking system invented by Louis Stange in the mid to late 1920s. Though it shares the MG 15 designation with the earlier gun built by Bergmann, the MG 15nA (for &quot;neuer Art&quot;, meaning new model having been modified from an earlier design) has nothing in common with the World War II gun except the model number. The World War I gun used a tipping lock system while the WWII aircraft gun uses a rotating bolt and lockring. The World War II MG 15 was used in nearly all Luftwaffe aircraft with a flexible-mount defensive position.

It was a modular design with various attachments that could be quickly attached or removed. The bolt mechanism acted as a traditional open-bolt machinegun design, in which the bolt will slam forward when empty, and require re-cocking either before or after a new magazine was fitted in order to be able to fire again. 

The MG 15 fires from an open bolt, meaning that the bolt stays back when the gun is ready to fire, and is thus unsuitable for &quot;through the propeller&quot; synchronized forward firing on a fuselage mount. Pulling the trigger releases the bolt and allows it to go forward, stripping a round from the magazine. The bolt continues pushing the round into the chamber and locks up when the lockring rotates and locks the bolt and barrel extension together. At this point the trip lever releases the firing pin and the gun fires. Recoil pushes the barrel, lock and bolt backwards until the lockring hits a cam that rotates it unlocking the bolt and barrel. Inertia carries the bolt backwards until the base of the fired case hits the ejector, flinging the empty out of the receiver. If the trigger is held down the cycle will continue. If the trigger is released the bolt will remain in the rearward position.

The &quot;saddle-drum&quot; magazine was so called because it straddled the gun, with two inversely symmetrical spiral drums that fitted on either side of the receiver. The 75 rounds of ammunition (not 150 as is often mistakenly claimed) was shared evenly by both drums and as the gun fired, converged under spring tension towards the centre and from thence passed downwards into the action. The MG 15, having a firing rate of over 1,000 rpm, could empty the magazine in 4.5 seconds or less, and typical practice was to provide at least 10 spare magazines for each gun on the aircraft. This still left the gunner with the problem of reloading in combat, offering a brief opportunity for enemy fighters to attack with impunity.

Starting in late 1940 the MG 15 was replaced by the belt-fed Mauser 7.92 mm MG 81, MG 81Z (twin-MG 81), MG 131 13 mm machine guns, or MG 151/20 20 mm cannons. As they became redundant in their original role, many MG 15s were modified for infantry use, and a carrying device was also issued that held three of the saddle-drums. (There are a number of pictures showing the guns, both aircraft and ground versions, with 25-round magazines from another machine-gun, the MG 13, however the magazines are not compatible with the MG 15.) The official total of conversions was about 17,648 by January 1, 1944, although the actual number may have been greater.

The license-produced MG 15 was used in the Japanese aircraft as the &quot;Type 98&quot; flexible-mounted machine gun and as the &quot;Type 1&quot; in the Imperial Japanese Navy. Type 98 machine guns were also used by the Communist forces during the Korean War.

<text>Son cubano is a genre of music and dance that originated in the highlands of eastern Cuba during the late 19th century. It is a syncretic genre that blends elements of Spanish and African origin. Among its fundamental Hispanic components are the vocal style, lyrical metre and the primacy of the tres, derived from the Spanish guitar. On the other hand, its characteristic clave rhythm, call and response structure and percussion section (bongo, maracas, etc.) are all rooted in traditions of Bantu origin.

Around 1909 the son reached Havana, where the first recordings were made in 1917. This marked the start of its expansion throughout the island, becoming Cuba&#x27;s most popular and influential genre. While early groups had between three and five members, during the 1920s the &quot;sexteto&quot; (sextet) became the genre&#x27;s primary format. By the 1930s, many bands had incorporated a trumpet, becoming &quot;septetos&quot;, and in the 1940s a larger type of ensemble featuring congas and piano became the norm: the conjunto. The son became one of the main ingredients in the jam sessions known as descargas that flourished during the 1950s.

The international presence of the son can be traced back to the 1930s when many bands toured Europe and North America, leading to ballroom adaptations of the genre such as the American rhumba. Similarly, radio broadcasts of son became popular in West Africa and the Congos, leading to the development of hybrid genres such as Congolese rumba. In the 1960s, New York&#x27;s music scene prompted the rapid success of salsa, a combination of son and other Latin American styles primarily recorded by Puerto Ricans. While salsa achieved international popularity during the second half of the 20th century, in Cuba son evolved into other styles such as songo and timba, the latter of which is sometimes known as &quot;Cuban salsa&quot;.

==Etymology and cognates==
In Spanish, the word &quot;son&quot;, from Latin &quot;sonus&quot;, denotes a pleasant sound, particularly a musical one. In eastern Cuba, the term began to be used to refer to the music of the highlands towards the late 19th century. To distinguish it from similar genres from other countries (such as son mexicano and son guatemalteco), the term &quot;son cubano&quot; is most commonly used. In Cuba, various qualifiers are used to distinguish the regional variants of the genre. These include &quot;son montuno&quot;, &quot;son oriental&quot;, &quot;son santiaguero&quot; and &quot;son habanero&quot;.

Son singers are generally known as &quot;soneros&quot;, and the verb &quot;sonear&quot; describes not only their singing but also their vocal improvisation. The adjective &quot;soneado&quot; refers to songs and styles which incorporate the tempo and syncopation of the son, or even its montunos. Generally, there is an explicit difference between styles that incorporate elements of the son partially or totally, as evidenced by the distinction between &quot;bolero soneado&quot; and &quot;bolero-son&quot;. The term &quot;sonora&quot; refers to conjuntos with smoother trumpet sections such as Sonora Matancera and Sonora Ponceña.

==History ==

===Origins===

Although the history of Cuban music dates back to the 16th century, the son is a relatively recent musical invention whose precursors emerged in the mid-to-late 19th century. Historically, most musicologists have supported the hypothesis that the direct ancestors (or earliest forms) of the son appeared in Cuba&#x27;s Oriente Province, particularly in mountainous regions such as Sierra Maestra. These early styles, which include changüí, nengón, kiribá and regina, were developed by peasants, many of which were of Bantu origin, in contrast to the Afro-Cubans of the western side of the island, which primarily descended from West African slaves (Yoruba, Ewe, etc.). These forms flourished in the context of rural parties such as &quot;guateques&quot;, where &quot;bungas&quot; were known to perform; these groups consisted of singers and guitarists playing variants such as the tiple, bandurria and bandola. Such early guitars are thought to have given rise to the tres some time around 1890 in Baracoa. The addition of a rhythm section composed of percussion instruments such as the bongó and the botija/marímbula gave rise to the first son groups proper. Nonetheless, it has become increasingly clear for musicologists that different versions of the son, i.e. styles that fall within the so-called son complex, appeared throughout the rural parts of the island by the end of the 1890s. Musicologist Marta Esquenazi Pérez divides the son complex into three regional variants: changüí in Guantánamo, sucu-sucu in Isla de la Juventud, and an array of styles which fall under the denomination of son montuno and were developed in places such as Bayamo, Manzanillo, Majagua and Pinar del Río. For this reason, some academics such as Radamés Giro and Jesús Gómez Cairo indicate that awareness of the son was widespread in the whole island, including Havana, before the actual expansion of the genre in the 1910s.

Musicologist Peter Manuel proposed an alternative hypothesis according to which a great deal of the son&#x27;s structure originated from the contradanza in Havana around the second half of the 19th century. The contradanza included many of the traits that are shown in the son, such as duets with melodies in parallel thirds, the presence of a suggested clave rhythm, implicit short vocal refrains borrowed from popular songs, distinctive syncopations, as well as the two-parts song form with an ostinato section.

====Apocryphal origins of the son====

Due to the very limited historiographical and ethnomusicological research devoted to the son (considered by Díaz Ayala the &quot;least studied&quot; Cuban genre), until the mid-20th century its origins were incorrectly traced back to the 16th century by many writers. This fallacy stemmed from the apocryphal origin story of a folk song known as &quot;Son de Má Teodora&quot;. Such story was first mentioned by Cuban historian Joaquín José García in 1845, who &quot;cited&quot; a chronicle supposedly written by Hernando de la Parra in the 16th century. Parra&#x27;s story was picked up, recycled and expanded by various authors throughout the second half of the 19th century, perpetuating the idea that such song was the first example of the son genre. Despite being given credence by some authors in the first half of the 20th century, including Fernando Ortiz, the &quot;Crónicas&quot; were repeatedly shown to be apocryphal in subsequent studies by Manuel Pérez Beato, José Juan Arrom, Max Henríquez Ureña and Alberto Muguercia.

===Early 20th century===

The emergence of son significantly increased the interaction of cultures derived from Africa and Spain. A large number of former black slaves, recently liberated after the abolition of slavery in 1886 went to live in the slums &quot;solares&quot; of low class neighborhoods in Havana, and numerous laborers also arrived from all over the country and some rural areas, looking to improve their living conditions. Many of them brought their Afro-Cuban rumba traditions, and others brought their rumbitas and montunos.

It was in Havana where the encounter of the rumba rural and the rumba urbana that had been developing separately during the second half of the 19th century took place. The guaracheros and rumberos who used to play with the tiple and the guiro finally met other rumberos who sang and danced accompanied by the wooden box (cajón) and the Cuban clave, and the result was the fusion of both styles in a new genre called son. Around 1910 the son most likely adopted the clave rhythm from the Havana-based rumba, which had been developed in the late 19th century in Havana and Matanzas.

After trovador Sindo Garay settled in Havana in 1906, many other trovadores followed him hoping to obtain a recording contract with one of the American Companies such as RCA Victor and Columbia Records. Those trovadores from different parts of the country met others who already lived in Havana such as María Teresa Vera and Rafael Zequeira. They brought their repertoires of canciones (Cuban songs) and boleros that also included rumbas, guarachas and rural rumbitas.
Famous trovador Chico Ibáñez said that he composed his first &quot;montuno&quot; called &quot;Pobre Evaristo&quot; (Poor Evaristo) in 1906: &quot;It was a tonada with three or four words that you put on, and after it, we placed a repeated phrase, the real montuno to be sung by everybody…&quot;. Ned Sublette states about another famous trovador and sonero: &quot;As a child, Miguel Matamoros played danzones and sones on his harmonica to entertain the workers at a local cigar factory. He said: &#x27;the sones that were composed at that time were nothing more than two or three words that were repeated all night long.

A partial list of trovadores that recorded rumbas, guarachas and sones in Havana at the beginning of the 20th century included: Sindo Garay, Manuel Corona, María Teresa Vera, Alberto Villalón, José Castillo, Juan Cruz, Juan de la Cruz, Nano León, Román Martínez, as well as the duos of Floro and Zorrilla, Pablito and Luna, Zalazar and Oriche, and also Adolfo Colombo, who was not a trovador but a soloist at Teatro Alhambra.

In the Havana neighborhoods, the son groups played in any possible format they could gather and most of them were semi-professional. One of those groups, The Apaches, was invited in 1916 to a party held by President Mario Menocal at the exclusive Vedado Tennis Club, and that same year some members of the group were reorganized in a quartet named Cuarteto Oriental. Those members were: Ricardo Martínez from Santiago de Cuba (conductor and tres), Gerardo Martínez (first voice and clave), Guillermo Castillo (botijuela), and Felipe Neri Cabrera (maracas). According to Jesús Blanco, quoted by Díaz Ayala, after a few months from its foundation the bongocero Joaquín Velazco joined the group.

In 1917, the Cuarteto Oriental recorded the first son documented on the catalog of Columbia Records which was entered as &quot;Pare motorista-son santiaguero&quot;. Unexpectedly, a fifth member of the quartet is mentioned, Carlos Godínez, who was a soldier in the standing army (&quot;Ejército Permanente&quot;). Subsequently, the RCA Victor contracted Godínez in 1918 to organize a group and record several songs. For that recording, the new group was called &quot;Sexteto Habanero Godínez&quot;, which included: Carlos Godínez (conductor and tresero), María Teresa Vera (first voice and clave), Manuel Corona (second voice and guitar), Sinsonte (third voice and maracas), Alfredo Boloña (bongo), and another unknown performer who was not included in the list.

===1920s===
In 1920, the Cuarteto Oriental became a sextet and was renamed as Sexteto Habanero. This group established the &quot;classical&quot; configuration of the son sextet composed of guitar, tres, bongos, claves, maracas and double bass. The sextet members were: Guillermo Castillo (conductor, guitar and second voice), Gerardo Martínez (first voice), Felipe Neri Cabrera (maracas and backing vocals), Ricardo Martínez (tres), Joaquín Velazco (bongos), and Antonio Bacallao (botija). Abelardo Barroso, one of the most famous soneros, joined the group in 1925.
Popularization began in earnest with the arrival of radio broadcasting in 1922, which came at the same time as Havana&#x27;s reputation as an attraction for Americans evading Prohibition laws. The city became a haven for the Mafia, gambling and prostitution in Cuba, and also became a second home for trendy and influential bands from New York City. The son experienced a period of transformation from 1925 to 1928, when it evolved from a marginal genre of music to perhaps the most popular type of music in Cuba.
A turning point that made this transformation possible occurred when then-president Machado publicly asked La Sonora Matancera to perform at his birthday party. In addition, the acceptance of son as a popular music genre in other countries contributed to more acceptance of son in mainstream Cuba. At that time many sextets were founded such as Boloña, Agabama, Botón de Rosa and the famous Sexteto Occidente conducted by María Teresa Vera.
A few years later, in the late 1920s, son sextets became septets and son&#x27;s popularity continued to grow with artists like Septeto Nacional and its leader Ignacio Piñeiro (&quot;Echale salsita&quot;, &quot;Donde estabas anoche&quot;). In 1928, Rita Montaner&#x27;s &quot;El Manicero&quot; became the first Cuban song to be a major hit in Paris and elsewhere in Europe. In 1930, Don Azpiazu&#x27;s Havana Casino Orchestra took the song to the United States, where it also became a big hit.

The instrumentation was expanded to include cornets or trumpets, forming the sextets and the septets of the 1920s. Later these conjuntos added piano, other percussion instruments, more trumpets, and even dance orchestra instruments in the style of jazz big bands.

===Trío Matamoros===

The presence of the Trío Matamoros in the history of Cuban son is so important that it deserves a separate section. Its development constitutes an example of the process that the trovadores usually followed until they became soneros. The Trío was founded by Miguel Matamoros (vocals and first guitar), who was born in Santiago de Cuba (Oriente) in 1894. There, he became involved with the traditional trova movement and in 1925 joined Siro Rodríguez (vocals and maracas) and Rafael Cueto (vocals and second guitar) to create the famous group.

They synthesized the style of the sextets and septets, adapting it to their ensemble. The different rhythmic layers of the son style were distributed between their three voices, guitars and maracas. Cueto plucked the strings of his guitar instead of strumming them as it was usual, providing the patterns of the guajeo in the treble range, and the syncopated rhythms of the tumbao on the bass strings. The counterpoint was completed by the first guitar, played by Matamoros. They also occasionally included other instruments such as the bongo, and later they decided to expand the trio format to create a son conjunto by adding a piano, more guitars, tres and other voices. This project was joined by such important figures as Lorenzo Hierrezuelo, Francisco Repilado (Compay Segundo) and Beny Moré.

In 1928, they travelled to New York with a recording contract by RCA Victor, and their first album caused such a great impact in the public that they soon became very famous at a national as well as an international level. The Trío Matamoros maintained great prominence until their official retirement in 1960.

===1930s===

By the late 1930s, the heyday of &quot;Classic son&quot; had largely ended. The sextetos and septetos that had enjoyed wide commercial popularity increasingly lost ground to jazz bands and amplified conjuntos. The very music that son had helped to create was now replacing son as the more popular and most requested music in Cuba. Original son conjuntos were faced with the options of either to disband and refocus on newer styles of Cuban music, or go back to their roots.

===1940s===
In the 1940s, Arsenio Rodríguez became the most influential player of son. He used improvised solos, toques, congas, extra trumpets, percussion and pianos, although all these elements had been used previously (&quot;Papauba&quot;, &quot;Para bailar son montuno&quot;). Beny Moré (known as &quot;El Bárbaro del Ritmo&quot;, &quot;The Master of Rhythm&quot;) further evolved the genre, adding guaracha, bolero and mambo influences. He was perhaps the greatest sonero (&quot;Castellano que bueno baila usted&quot;, &quot;Vertiente Camaguey&quot;); another important sonero was Roberto Faz.

By the late 1940s, son had lost its controversiality even among conservative Cubans which made it even less appealing to Cubans. A development that led to the decrease in popularity of the original son occurred in the 1940s. The son grew more sophisticated as it was adopted by conjuntos, which displaced sextetos and septetos. This led to big bands replacing the conjuntos, which managed to keep its flavor despite elaborate arrangements.

During the 1940s and 1950s, the tourism boom in Cuba and the popularity of jazz and American music in general fostered the development of big bands and combos on the island. These bands consisted of a relatively small horn section, piano, double bass, a full array of Cuban percussion instruments and a vocalist fronting the ensemble. Their polished sound and &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; – read &quot;commercial&quot; – repertoire captivated both Cuban and foreign audiences.

The commercialism of this new music movement led Cuban nightclub owners to recognize the revenue potential of hosting these types of bands to attract the growing flow of tourists. Additionally, as a result of the increasing popularity of big band music and in an effort to increase revenues, the recording industry focused on producing newer types of music and essentially removing son from their music repertoires. These developments were a big blow to the prospects of son and its popularity amongst even Cubans.

With the arrival of cha-cha-chá and mambo in the United States, son also became extremely popular. After the Cuban Revolution separated Cuba from the U.S., son, mambo and rumba, along with other forms of Afro-Cuban music contributed to the development of salsa music, initially in New York.

The mass popularization of son music led to an increased valorization of Afro-Cuban street culture and of the artists who created it. It also opened the door for other music genres with Afro-Cuban roots to become popular in Cuba and throughout the world.

===Current state of the son===

At present, the traditional-style son is seldom heard but has been assimilated into other genres and is present in them. Thus, other types of popular Cuban music and other Latin styles of music continue using the essential style of the son.

Another important contribution of the son was the introduction of the drum to mainstream music. The increase in popularity of the son unveiled the potential of music with Afro-Cuban rhythms. This led to the development and mass distribution of newer types of Latin music. Additionally, genres of the later 1940s such as mambo manifest many characteristics derived from son. Charanga orchestras, also developed dance music heavily influenced by son.

Perhaps the most significant contribution of son is its influence on present day Latin music. Son is specifically considered to be the foundation on which salsa was created.

Although the &quot;classic son&quot; continues to be a very important musical foundation for all kinds of Latin music, it is no longer a popular music genre in Cuba. Younger generations of Cubans prefer the faster, dance-oriented son-derivatives such as timba or salsa. Older generations continue to preserve the son as one of the music genres they listen to, specifically in Oriente, where they tend to maintain more traditional versions of the son compared to Havana.

The demise of the USSR (Cuba&#x27;s major economic mainstay) in 1991 forced Cuba to encourage tourism to attract sorely needed foreign currency. Along with tourism, music became one of Cuba&#x27;s major assets. The Buena Vista Social Club album and film as well as a stream of CDs triggered a worldwide Cuban music boom. In addition to the original Buena Vista Social Club album, there has been a stream of solo CDs by the members of the &quot;Club&quot;. These individuals were subsequently offered individual contracts, ensuring a continued flow of CDs that include many original Cuban son classics.

Thanks to the Buena Vista Social Club album, film, and follow-up solo albums there has been a revival of the traditional son and a rediscovery of older son performers who had often fallen by the wayside. Although most Cubans don’t see the value of the Buena Vista Social Club album and feel it doesn&#x27;t represent present-day Cuba, it has introduced the Cuban son to younger generations of people from around the world who had never heard of son. It has also introduced foreign audiences to an important part of Cuban music history.

==Instrumentation==
The basic son ensemble of early 20th-century Havana consisted of guitar, tres, claves, bongos, marímbula or botija, and maracas. The tres plays the typical Cuban ostinato figure known as guajeo. The rhythmic pattern of the following generic guajeo is used in many different songs. Note that the first measure consists of all offbeats. The figure can begin in the first measure, or the second measure, depending upon the structure of the song.

Later on, the double bass replaced the marímbula and bongos and a trumpet were added, giving rise to &quot;sextetos&quot; and &quot;septetos&quot;.

<text>Oseltamivir, sold under the brand name Tamiflu among others, is an antiviral medication used to treat and prevent influenza A and influenza B, viruses that cause the flu. Many medical organizations recommend it in people who have complications or are at high risk of complications within 48 hours of first symptoms of infection. They recommend it to prevent infection in those at high risk, but not the general population. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that clinicians use their discretion to treat those at lower risk who present within 48 hours of first symptoms of infection. It is taken by mouth, either as a pill or liquid.
Recommendations regarding oseltamivir are controversial as are criticisms of the recommendations. A 2014 Cochrane Review concluded that oseltamivir does not reduce hospitalizations, and that there is no evidence of reduction in complications of influenza. Two meta-analyses have concluded that benefits in those who are otherwise healthy do not outweigh its risks. They also found little evidence regarding whether treatment changes the risk of hospitalization or death in high risk populations. However, another meta-analysis found that oseltamivir was effective for prevention of influenza at the individual and household levels.
Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and trouble sleeping. Other side effects may include psychiatric symptoms and seizures. In the United States it is recommended for influenza infection during pregnancy. It has been taken by a small number of pregnant women without signs of problems. Dose adjustment may be needed in those with kidney problems.
Oseltamivir was approved for medical use in the US in 1999. It was the first neuraminidase inhibitor available by mouth. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines but was downgraded to &quot;complementary&quot; status in 2017. A generic version was approved in the US in 2016. In 2022, it was the 205th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

== Medical use ==

Oseltamivir is used for the prevention and treatment of influenza caused by influenza A and B viruses. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The WHO supports its use for severe illness due to confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection in critically ill people who have been hospitalized. Oseltamivir&#x27;s risk-benefit ratio is controversial. In 2017, it was moved from the core to the complementary list based on its lower cost-effectiveness. The Expert Committee did not recommend the deletion of oseltamivir from the EML and EMLc, recognizing that it is the only medicine included on the Model Lists for critically ill patients with influenza and for influenza pandemic preparedness. However, the Committee noted that, since the inclusion of oseltamivir on the Model List in 2009, new evidence in seasonal and pandemic influenza has lowered earlier estimates of the magnitude of effect of oseltamivir on relevant clinical outcomes. The Committee recommended that the listing of oseltamivir be amended, moving the medicine from the core to the Complementary List, and that its use be restricted to severe illness due to confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection in critically ill hospitalized patients. The Expert Committee noted that WHO guidelines for pharmacological management of pandemic and seasonal influenza would be updated in 2017: unless new information is provided to support the use of oseltamivir in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks, the next Expert Committee might consider oseltamivir for deletion.

===High-risk people===
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Public Health England and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend the use of oseltamivir for people who have complications or are at high risk for complications. This includes those who are hospitalized, young children, those over the age of 65, people with other significant health problems, those who are pregnant, and Indigenous peoples of the Americas among others. The Infectious Disease Society of America takes the same position as the CDC.

A systematic review of systematic reviews in &quot;PLoS One&quot; did not find evidence for benefits in people who are at risk, noting that &quot;the trials were not designed or powered to give results regarding serious complications, hospitalization and mortality&quot;, as did a 2014 Cochrane Review. The Cochrane Review further recommended: &quot;On the basis of the findings of this review, clinicians and healthcare policy-makers should urgently revise current recommendations for use of the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) for individuals with influenza.&quot; That is not utilizing NIs for prevention or treatment &quot;Based on these findings there appears to be no evidence for patients, clinicians or policy-makers to use these drugs to prevent serious outcomes, both in annual influenza and pandemic influenza outbreaks.&quot;

The CDC, ECDC, Public Health England, Infectious Disease Society of America, the AAP, and Roche (the originator) reject the conclusions of the Cochrane Review, arguing in part that the analysis inappropriately forms conclusions about outcomes in people who are seriously ill based on results obtained primarily in healthy populations, and that the analysis inappropriately included results from people not infected with influenza. The EMA did not change its labeling of the drug in response to the Cochrane study.

A 2014 review recommended that all people admitted to intensive care units during influenza outbreaks with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia receive oseltamivir until the absence of influenza infection is established by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.

A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis found oseltamivir effective at treating the symptoms of influenza, reducing the length of hospitalization, and reducing the risk of otitis media. The same review found that oseltamivir did not significantly increase the risk of adverse events. A 2016 systematic review found that oseltamivir slightly reduced the time it takes for the symptoms of influenza to be alleviated, and that it also increased the risk of &quot;nausea, vomiting, [and] psychiatric events in adults and vomiting in children.&quot; The decrease in duration of sickness was about 18 hours.

===Otherwise healthy people===
In those who are otherwise healthy the CDC states that antivirals may be considered within the first 48 hours. A German clinical practice guideline recommends against its use.

Two 2013 meta-analyses have concluded that benefits in those who are otherwise healthy do not outweigh its risks. When the analysis was restricted to people with confirmed infection, the same 2014 Cochrane Review (see above) found unclear evidence of change in the risk of complications such as pneumonia, while three other reviews found a decreased risk. Together, published studies suggest that oseltamivir reduces the duration of symptoms by 0.5–1.0 day. Any benefit of treatment must be balanced against side effects, which include psychiatric symptoms and increased rates of vomiting.

The 2014 Cochrane Collaboration review concluded that oseltamivir did not affect the need for hospitalizations, and that there is no proof of reduction of complications of influenza (such as pneumonia) because of a lack of diagnostic definitions, or reduction of the spread of the virus. There was also evidence that suggested that oseltamivir prevented some people from producing sufficient numbers of their own antibodies to fight infection. The authors recommended that guidance should be revised to take account of the evidence of small benefit and increased risk of harms.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the Public Health England (PHE), the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and Roche (the originator) rejected the recommendations of the 2014 Cochrane Review to urgently change treatment guidelines and drug labels.

=== Prevention ===
, the CDC does not recommend to use oseltamivir generally for prevention due to concerns that widespread use will encourage resistance development. They recommend that it be considered in those at high risk, who have been exposed to influenza within 48 hours and have not received or only recently been vaccinated. They recommended it during outbreaks in long term care facilities and in those who are significantly immunosuppressed.

, reviews concluded that when oseltamivir is used preventatively it decreases the risk of exposed people developing symptomatic disease. A systematic review of systematic reviews found low to moderate evidence that it decreases the risk of getting symptomatic influenza by 1 to 12% (a relative decrease of 64 to 92%). It recommended against its use in healthy, low-risk persons due to cost, the risk of resistance development, and side effects and concluded it might be useful for prevention in unvaccinated high risk persons.

== Side effects ==
According to the FDA, the two most common adverse drug reactions associated with oseltamivir therapy are nausea (10% vs 6% placebo) and vomiting (9% vs 3% placebo). In adults, oseltamivir increased the risk of nausea for which the number needed to harm was 28 and for vomiting was 22. So, for every 22 adult people on oseltamivir one experienced vomiting. In the treatment of children, oseltamivir also induced vomiting. The number needed to harm was 19. So, for every 19 children on oseltamivir one experienced vomiting. When used as a prophylactic there were more headaches, kidney, and psychiatric events. Oseltamivir&#x27;s effect on the heart is unclear: it may reduce cardiac symptoms, but may also induce serious arrhythmias.

Postmarketing reports include liver inflammation and elevated liver enzymes, rash, allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, abnormal heart rhythms, seizure, confusion, aggravation of diabetes, and haemorrhagic colitis and Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and body pain, followed by skin problems, were identified as the side effects most significantly reducing patient satisfaction on a drug review platform.

The US and EU package inserts for oseltamivir contain a warning of psychiatric effects observed in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency of these appears to be low and a causative role for oseltamivir has not been established. The 2014 Cochrane Review found a dose-response effect on psychiatric events. In trials of prevention in adults one person was harmed for every 94 treated. Neither of the two most cited published treatment trials of oseltamivir reported any drug-attributable serious adverse events. 

It is pregnancy category B in Australia, meaning that it has been taken by a small number of women without signs of problems and in animal studies it looks safe. Dose adjustment may be needed in those with kidney problems.

== Mechanism of action ==

Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, a competitive inhibitor of influenza&#x27;s neuraminidase enzyme. The neuraminidase enzyme binds to the sialic acid which is found on glycoproteins on the surface of human cells. Then it cleaves the sialic acid, which helps new virions to exit the cell. As Oseltamivir is an analogue of the sialic acid, the enzyme can bind to Oseltamivir instead, in which case the enzyme will not bind to sialic acid, so it will not cleave it and new virons will not exit the cell.

== Resistance ==

The vast majority of mutations conferring resistance are single amino acid residue substitutions (His274Tyr in N1) in the neuraminidase enzyme. A 2011 meta-analysis of 15 studies found a pooled incidence rate for oseltamivir resistance of 2.6%. Subgroup analyses detected higher rates among influenza A patients, especially the H1N1 subtype. It was found that a substantial number of patients might become oseltamivir-resistant as a result of oseltamivir use, and that oseltamivir resistance might be significantly associated with pneumonia. In severely immunocompromised patients there were reports of prolonged shedding of oseltamivir- (or zanamivir)-resistant virus, even after oseltamivir treatment was stopped.

=== H1N1 flu or &quot;swine flu&quot; ===
, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 314 samples of the prevalent 2009 pandemic H1N1 flu tested worldwide showed resistance to oseltamivir.

The CDC found sporadic oseltamivir-resistant 2009 H1N1 virus infections had been identified, including with rare episodes of limited transmission, but the public health impact had been limited. Those sporadic cases of resistance were found in immunosuppressed patients during oseltamivir treatment and persons who developed illness while receiving oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis.

During 2011, a new influenza A(H1N1)2009 variant with mildly reduced oseltamivir (and zanamivir) sensitivity was detected in more than 10% of community specimens in Singapore and more than 30% of samples from northern Australia.

While there is concern that antiviral resistance may develop in people with haematologic malignancies due to their inability to reduce viral loads and several surveillance studies found oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 after administration of oseltamivir in those people, , widespread transmission of oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 has not occurred.

During the 2007–08 flu season, the US CDC found 10.9% of H1N1 samples (n=1,020) to be resistant. In the 2008–09 season, the proportion of resistant H1N1 increased to 99.4%, while no other seasonal strains (H3N2, B) showed resistance.

=== Seasonal flu ===
From 2009 to 2014, oseltamivir resistance was very low in seasonal flu. In the 2010–11 flu season, 99.1% of H1N1, 99.8% of H3N, and 100% of Influenza B remained oseltamivir susceptible in the US. In January 2012, the US and European CDCs reported all seasonal flu samples tested since October 2011 to be oseltamivir susceptible. In the 2013–14 season only 1% of 2009 H1N1 viruses showed oseltamivir resistance. No other influenza viruses were resistant to oseltamivir.

=== H3N2 ===
Three studies have found resistance in 0%, 3.3%, and 18% of subjects. In the study with the 18% resistance rate, the subjects were children, many of whom had not been previously exposed to influenza virus and therefore had a weakened immune response; the results suggest that higher and earlier dosing may be necessary in such populations.

=== Influenza B ===

In 2007, Japanese investigators detected neuraminidase-resistant influenza B virus strains in individuals not treated with these drugs. The prevalence was 1.7%. According to the CDC, , transmission of oseltamivir-resistant influenza B virus strains—from persons treated with the drug—is rare.

=== H5N1 avian influenza &quot;bird flu&quot; ===
, H274Y and N294S mutations that confer resistance to oseltamivir have been identified in a few H5N1 isolates from infected patients treated with oseltamivir, and have emerged spontaneously in Egypt.

=== H7N9 avian influenza ===
, two of 14 adults infected with A(H7N9) and treated with oseltamivir developed oseltamivir-resistant virus with the Arg292Lys mutation.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Its oral bioavailability is over 80% and is extensively metabolised to its active form upon first-pass through the liver, via esterases. It does not interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. It has a volume of distribution of 23–26 litres. Its half-life is about 1–3 hours and its active carboxylate metabolite has a half-life of 6–10 hours. More than 90% of the oral dose is eliminated in the urine as the active metabolite.

== History ==
Oseltamivir was discovered by scientists at Gilead Sciences using shikimic acid as a starting point for synthesis; shikimic acid was originally available only as an extract of Chinese star anise; but by 2006, 30% of the supply was manufactured recombinantly in &quot;E. coli.&quot; Gilead exclusively licensed their relevant patents to Roche in 1996. The drug has not been patent-protected in Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and several other countries.

In 1999, the FDA approved oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza in adults based on two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. In June 2002, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved oseltamivir phosphate for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza. In 2003, a pooled analysis of ten randomised clinical trials concluded that oseltamivir reduced the risk of lower respiratory tract infections resulting in antibiotic use and hospital admissions in adults.

Oseltamivir (as Tamiflu) was widely used during the H5N1 avian influenza epidemic in Southeast Asia in 2005. In response to the epidemic, various governments – including those of the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, United States, and Australia – stockpiled quantities of oseltamivir in preparation for a possible pandemic and there were worldwide shortages of the drug, driven by the high demand for stockpiling. In November 2005, US President George W. Bush requested that Congress fund US$1 billion for the production and stockpile of oseltamivir, after Congress had already approved $1.8 billion for military use of the drug. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was a past chairman of Gilead Sciences, recused himself from all government decisions regarding the drug.

In 2006, a Cochrane Review (since withdrawn) raised controversy by concluding that oseltamivir should not be used during routine seasonal influenza because of its low effectiveness.

In December 2008, the Indian drug company Cipla won a case in India&#x27;s court system allowing it to manufacture a cheaper generic version of Tamiflu, called Antiflu. In May 2009, Cipla won approval from the World Health Organization (WHO) certifying that its drug Antiflu was as effective as Tamiflu, and Antiflu is included in the WHO list of prequalified medicinal products.

In 2009, a new A/H1N1 influenza virus was discovered to be spreading in North America. In June 2009, the WHO declared the A/H1N1 influenza a pandemic. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the CDC, the WHO, and the ECDC maintained their recommendation to use oseltamivir.

From 2010 to 2012, Cochrane requested Roche&#x27;s full clinical study reports of their trials, which they did not provide. In 2011, a freedom of information request to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided Cochrane with reports from 16 Roche oseltamivir trials. In 2012, the Cochrane team published an interim review based on those reports. In 2013, Roche released 74 full clinical study reports of oseltamivir trials after GSK released the data on zanamivir studies. In 2014, Cochrane published an updated review based solely on full clinical study reports and regulatory documents. In 2016, Roche&#x27;s oseltamivir patents began to expire.

== Veterinary use ==
There have been reports of oseltamivir reducing disease severity and hospitalization time in canine parvovirus infection. The drug may limit the ability of the virus to invade the crypt cells of the small intestine and decrease gastrointestinal bacterial colonization and toxin production.

==Research==
Oseltamivir has been deemed ineffective at treating COVID-19, consistent with the SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking influenza&#x27;s neuraminidase enzyme.

<doc id="957085" wikidata="Q1017100" url="?curid=957085" title="Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements">
<text>The Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements are a set of conditions sufficient for a computer architecture to support system virtualization efficiently. They were introduced by Gerald J. Popek and Robert P. Goldberg in their 1974 article &quot;Formal Requirements for Virtualizable Third Generation Architectures&quot;. Even though the requirements are derived under simplifying assumptions, they still represent a convenient way of determining whether a computer architecture supports efficient virtualization and provide guidelines for the design of virtualized computer architectures.

== VMM definition ==
System virtual machines are capable of virtualizing a full set of hardware resources, including a processor (or processors), memory and storage resources and peripheral devices. 
A virtual machine monitor (VMM, also called hypervisor) is the piece of software that provides the abstraction of a virtual machine. There are three properties of interest when analyzing the environment created by a VMM:

; Equivalence / Fidelity : A program running under the VMM should exhibit a behavior essentially identical to that demonstrated when running on an equivalent machine directly.
; Resource control / Safety : The VMM must be in complete control of the virtualized resources.
; Efficiency / Performance: A statistically dominant fraction of machine instructions must be executed without VMM intervention.

In the terminology of Popek and Goldberg, a VMM must present all three properties. In the terminology used in the reference book of Smith and Nair (2005), VMMs are typically assumed to satisfy the equivalence and resource control properties, and those additionally meeting the performance property are called &quot;efficient VMMs&quot;.

Popek and Goldberg describe the characteristics that the instruction set architecture (ISA) of the physical machine must possess in order to run VMMs which possess the above properties.
Their analysis derives such characteristics using a model of &quot;third generation architectures&quot; (e.g., IBM 360, Honeywell 6000, DEC PDP-10) that is nevertheless general enough to be extended to modern machines. This model includes a processor that operates in either system or user mode, and has access to linear, uniformly addressable memory. It is assumed that a subset of the instruction set is available only when in system mode and that memory is addressed relative to a relocation register. I/O and interrupts are not modelled.

== Virtualization theorems ==
To derive their virtualization theorems, which give sufficient (but not necessary) conditions for virtualization, Popek and Goldberg introduce a classification of some instructions of an ISA into 3 different groups:

; Privileged instructions : Those that trap if the processor is in user mode and do not trap if it is in system mode (supervisor mode). 
; Control sensitive instructions : Those that attempt to change the configuration of resources in the system.
; Behavior sensitive instructions : Those whose behavior or result depends on the configuration of resources (the content of the relocation register or the processor&#x27;s mode).

The main result of Popek and Goldberg&#x27;s analysis can then be expressed as follows.

Theorem 1. For any conventional third-generation computer, an &quot;effective&quot; VMM may be constructed if the set of sensitive instructions for that computer is a subset of the set of privileged instructions.

Intuitively, the theorem states that to build a VMM it is sufficient that all instructions that could affect the correct functioning of the VMM (sensitive instructions) always trap and pass control to the VMM. This guarantees the resource control property. Non-privileged instructions must instead be executed natively (i.e., efficiently). The holding of the equivalence property also follows.

This theorem also provides a simple technique for implementing a VMM, called &quot;trap-and-emulate virtualization&quot;, more recently called &quot;classic virtualization&quot;: because all sensitive instructions behave nicely, all the VMM has to do is trap and emulate every one of the sensitive instructions.

A related problem is that of deriving sufficient conditions for recursive virtualization, that is, the conditions under which a VMM that can run on a copy of itself can be built. Popek and Goldberg present the following (sufficient) conditions.

Theorem 2. A conventional third-generation computer is recursively virtualizable if:

# it is virtualizable and
# a VMM without any timing dependencies can be constructed for it.

Some architectures, like the non-hardware-assisted x86, do not meet these conditions, so they cannot be virtualized in the classic way. But architectures can still be fully virtualized (in the x86 case meaning at the CPU and MMU level) by using different techniques like binary translation, which replaces the sensitive instructions that do not generate traps, which are sometimes called critical instructions. This additional processing however makes the VMM less efficient in theory, but hardware traps have non-negligible performance cost as well. A well-tuned caching binary translation system may achieve comparable performance, and it does in the case of x86 binary translation relative to first generation x86 hardware assist, which merely made sensitive instructions trappable. Effectively this gives a theorem with different sufficiency conditions.

Theorem 3. A &quot;hybrid&quot; VMM may be constructed for any third generation machine in which the set of user sensitive instructions are a subset of the set of privileged instructions:

== Handling critical instructions ==
The conditions for ISA virtualization expressed in Theorem 1 may be relaxed at the expense of the efficiency property. VMMs for non-virtualizable ISAs (in the Popek and Goldberg&#x27;s sense) have routinely been built.

The virtualization of such architectures requires correct handling of &quot;critical instructions&quot;, i.e., sensitive but unprivileged instructions. One approach, known as &quot;patching&quot;, adopts techniques commonly used in dynamic recompilation: critical instructions are discovered at run-time and replaced with a trap into the VMM. Various mechanisms, such as the caching of emulation code or hardware assists, have been proposed to make the patching process more efficient. A different approach is that of paravirtualization, which requires guest operating systems to be modified (&quot;ported&quot;) before running in the virtual environment.

== Instruction sets of common architectures ==
This section presents some relevant architectures and how they relate to the virtualization requirements.

=== PDP-10 ===
The PDP-10 architecture has a few instructions which are sensitive (alter or query the processor&#x27;s mode) but not privileged. These instructions save or restore the condition codes containing USER or IOT bits:

* JSR: jump to subroutine
* JSP: jump and save program counter
* PUSHJ: push down and jump
* JRST: jump and restore

=== System/370 ===
All sensitive instructions in the System/370 are privileged: it satisfies the virtualization requirements.

=== Motorola MC68000 ===
The Motorola MC68000 has a single unprivileged sensitive instruction:

* MOVE from SR

This instruction is sensitive because it allows access to the entire status register, which includes not only the condition codes but also the user/supervisor bit, interrupt level, and trace control. In most later family members, starting with the MC68010, the MOVE from SR instruction was made privileged, and a new MOVE from CCR instruction was provided to allow access to the condition code register only.
=== IA-32 (x86) ===
The IA-32 instruction set of the Pentium processor contains 18 sensitive, unprivileged instructions. They can be categorized in two groups:

* Sensitive register instructions: read or change sensitive registers or memory locations such as a clock register or interrupt registers:
** SGDT, SIDT, SLDT
** SMSW
** PUSHF, POPF
*Protection system instructions: reference the storage protection system, memory or address relocation system:
** LAR, LSL, VERR, VERW
** POP
** PUSH
** CALL FAR, JMP FAR, INT n, RETF
** STR
** MOV (segment registers)

The introduction of the AMD-V and Intel VT-x instruction sets in 2005 allows x86 processors to meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements.

=== IA-64 ===
The effort needed to support virtualization on the IA-64 architecture is described in a 2000 article by Magenheimer and Christian.

=== SPARC ===
A &quot;hyperprivileged&quot; mode for the UltraSPARC architecture was specified in &quot;UltraSPARC Architecture 2005&quot;.&#x27; It defines a &quot;sun4v&quot; platform which is a super-set of the &quot;sun4u&quot; platform, but is still compliant to the SPARC v9 Level-1 specification.

=== PowerPC ===
All sensitive instructions in the PowerPC instruction set are privileged.

== Performance in practice ==
The efficiency requirement in Popek and Goldberg&#x27;s definition of a VMM concerns only the execution of non-privileged instructions, which must execute natively. This is what distinguishes a VMM from the more general class of hardware emulation software. Unfortunately, even on an architecture that meets Popek and Goldberg&#x27;s requirements, the performance of a virtual machine can differ significantly from the actual hardware. Early experiments performed on the System/370 (which meets the formal requirements of Theorem 1) showed that performance of a virtual machine could be as low as 21% of the native machine in some benchmarks. The cost of trapping and emulating privileged instructions in the VMM can be significant. This led the IBM engineers to introduce a number of hardware assists, which roughly doubled the performance of the System/370 virtual machines. Assists were added in several stages. In the end, there were over 100 assists on the late models System/370.

One of the main driving factors for the development of hardware assists for the System/370 was virtual memory itself. When the guest was an operating system that itself implemented virtual memory, even non-privileged instructions could experience longer execution times - a penalty imposed by the requirement to access translation tables not used in native execution (see shadow page tables).

<text>Anton Albert Enus is a South African-born Australian news presenter. He is currently co-host of &quot;SBS World News&quot; on Special Broadcasting Service (SBS).

==Career==
Enus presented &quot;SBS World News Australia&quot; late edition, which aired on weeknights at 9.30pm until December 2007. Due to the departure of both Mary Kostakidis and Stan Grant as co-hosts of &quot;SBS World News Australia&quot;, Enus was appointed co-host of the bulletin on 17 December 2007.

Enus has been a news presenter and journalist since 1999. He has been with &quot;SBS World News Tonight&quot; for the past five years, after a 15-year career in radio and television with South Africa&#x27;s national broadcaster, SABC. Enus&#x27; achievements include the CNN World Report award for best international report and the Bokmakierie Award for current affairs. Before leaving South Africa, Enus presented the country&#x27;s major evening national news bulletin for the SABC.

==Personal life==
Enus was a founding member of South Africa&#x27;s gay and lesbian sports movement in the early 1980s and was on the organising team that guided the country into the Gay Games for the first time in 1994. He has also served on committees aimed at reconciling Johannesburg&#x27;s multi-cultural gay and lesbian communities. Enus presented a special report about international LGBT issues during SBS&#x27;s coverage of the 2014 Sydney Mardi Gras.

Enus is a keen long-distance runner, having completed more than 4 standard or ultra-marathons. He has completed South Africa&#x27;s premier ultra-marathon, the Comrades (90 km), twice. He also enjoys squash, tennis, road running and hiking. In 1999, he migrated to Sydney with Roger Henning, his partner of 10 years, and they both became Australian citizens in July 2002.

In December 2016 he was diagnosed with early-stage bowel cancer and went public with the news in early 2017, which encouraged others to publicise the importance of using the testing kits provided by the government.

<text>Extended ML is a general-purpose, high-level, wide-spectrum programming language based on the languages ML and Standard ML, covering both program specification and implementation. It extends the syntax of ML to include axioms, which do not need to be executable but can rigorously specify the behavior of a program. With this addition, the language can be used for stepwise refinement, proceeding gradually from an initial formal specification to eventually yield an executable Standard ML program. Correctness of the final executable with respect to the original specification can then be established by proving the correctness of each of the refinement steps. Extended ML is used for research into and teaching of formal methods in program development and specification, and research into automatic program verification.

Extended ML is neither related to the programming language Extensible ML (other than being similarly derived from ML), nor to the specification language Extensible Markup Language (XML).

<text>The Seamless Robe of Jesus (also known as the Holy Robe, Holy Tunic, Holy Coat, Honorable Robe, and Chiton of the Lord) is the robe said to have been worn by Jesus during or shortly before his crucifixion. Competing traditions claim that the robe has been preserved to the present day. One tradition places it in the Cathedral of Trier, another places it in Argenteuil&#x27;s Basilique Saint-Denys, and several traditions claim that it is now in various Eastern Orthodox churches, notably Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta, Georgia.

==Bible passage==
According to the Gospel of John, the soldiers who crucified Jesus did not divide his tunic after crucifying him, but cast lots to determine who would keep it because it was woven in one piece, without seam. A distinction is made in the New Testament Greek between the
&quot;himatia&quot; (literally &quot;over-garments&quot;) and the seamless robe, which is &quot;chiton&quot;, (literally &quot;tunic&quot; or &quot;coat&quot;).

==Trier tradition==

According to legend, Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, discovered the seamless robe in the Holy Land in 327 or 328 along with several other relics, including the True Cross. According to different versions of the story, she either bequeathed it or sent it to the city of Trier, where Constantine had lived for some years before becoming emperor. The monk Altmann of Hautvillers wrote in the 9th century that Helena was born in that city, though this report is strongly disputed by most modern historians.
The history of the Trier robe is certain only from the 12th century, when Archbishop Johann I of Trier consecrated an altar which contained the seamless robe in early 1196. Although biographies of Johann I state that this was not the first time the robe was displayed, there are no historical dates or events presented which predate 1196. Sections of taffeta and silk have been added to the robe, and it was dipped in a rubber solution in the 19th century in an attempt to preserve it. The few remaining original sections are not suitable for carbon dating. The stigmatist Therese Neumann of Konnersreuth declared that the Trier robe was authentic.

The relic is normally kept folded in a reliquary and cannot be directly viewed by the faithful. In 1512, during an Imperial Diet, Emperor Maximilian I demanded to see the Holy Robe which was kept in the Cathedral. Archbishop Richard von Greiffenklau arranged the opening of the altar that had enshrined the tunic since the building of the Dome and exhibited it. The people of Trier heard about that and demanded to see the Holy Robe. Subsequently, pilgrimages took place first annually, then every seven years, in accordance with the Aachen pilgrimages. However, after 1545, pilgrimages were irregularly done due to warring in Europe. The pilgrimage occurrences are as follows: 1513, 1514, 1515, 1516, 1517, 1524, 1531, 1538, 1545, 1655, 1810, 1844, 1891, 1933, 1959, 1981, 1996, 2006, and 2012.

The 1844 exhibition of the relic, on the instructions of Wilhelm Arnoldi, Bishop of Trier, led to the formation of the German Catholics (&quot;Deutschkatholiken&quot;), a schismatic sect formed in December 1844 under the leadership of Johannes Ronge. The 1996 exhibition of the tunic was seen by over one million pilgrims and visitors. Since then, the Bishopric of Trier has conducted an annual ten-day religious festival called the &quot;Heilig-Rock-Tage&quot;.

==Argenteuil tradition==
According to the Argenteuil tradition, the Empress Irene made a gift of the seamless robe to Charlemagne in about 800. Charlemagne gave it to his daughter Theodrada, abbess of Argenteuil, where it was preserved in the church of the Benedictines. In 1793, the parish priest, fearing that the robe would be desecrated in the French Revolution, cut the robe into pieces and hid them in separate places. Only four of the pieces remain. They were moved to the present church of Argenteuil in 1895.

The earliest document referring to the robe at Argenteuil dates from 1156, written by Archbishop Hugh of Rouen. He described it as the garment of the child Jesus. A long-running dispute claims that the Argenteuil cloth is not the seamless robe worn by Jesus during the crucifixion, but the garments woven for him by the Virgin Mary and worn his entire life. Advocates of the theory that the Argenteuil cloth is the seamless robe claim that the Trier robe is Jesus&#x27;s mantle.

==Eastern traditions==

The Eastern Orthodox Church has also preserved a tradition regarding the clothing of Jesus which was divided among the soldiers after the crucifixion.

According to the tradition of the Georgian Orthodox Church, the chiton was acquired by a Jewish rabbi from Georgia named Elioz (Elias), who was present in Jerusalem at the time of the crucifixion and bought the robe from a soldier. He brought it with him when he returned to his native town of Mtskheta, Georgia, where it is preserved to this day beneath a crypt in the Patriarchal Svetitskhoveli Cathedral. The feast day in honor of the &quot;Chiton of the Lord&quot; is celebrated on 1 October.
A portion of the himation was also brought to Georgia, but it was placed in the treasury of the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, where it remained until the seventeenth century. Then the Persian Shah Abbas I, when he invaded Georgia, carried off the robe. At the insistence of the Russian ambassador and Tsar Michael Feodorovich, the Shah sent the robe as a gift to Patriarch Philaret (1619–1633) and Tsar Michael in 1625. The authenticity of the robe was attested by Nectarius, Archbishop of Vologda, by Patriarch Theophanes of Jerusalem and by Joannicius the Greek. Reports also circulated at that time of miraculous signs being worked through the relic.

Later, two portions of the robe were taken to Saint Petersburg: one in the cathedral at the Winter Palace, and the other in Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral. A portion of the Robe was also preserved at the Cathedral of the Dormition in Moscow, and small portions at Kyiv&#x27;s Sophia Cathedral, at the Ipatiev monastery near Kostroma and at certain other old temples.

The Russian Orthodox Church commemorates the Placing of the Honorable Robe of the Lord at Moscow on 10 July (25 July N.S.). At Moscow annually on that day, the robe is solemnly brought out of the chapel of the Apostles Peter and Paul at the Dormition cathedral, and it is placed on a stand for veneration by the faithful during the divine services. After the Divine Liturgy the robe is returned to its former place. Traditionally, on this day the propers chanted are of &quot;the Life-Creating Cross&quot;, since the day on which the relic was actually placed was the Sunday of the Cross, during Great Lent of 1625.

<doc id="957115" wikidata="Q3805138" url="?curid=957115" title="J. Thomas Looney">
<text>John Thomas Looney (luni) (14 August 1870 – 17 January 1944) was an English school teacher who is notable for having originated the Oxfordian theory, which claims that Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (1550–1604) was the true author of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

Looney came from a Methodist religious background, but later converted to the rationalistic Religion of Humanity, becoming a leader of its church in Tyneside. After the failure of the local church, Looney turned to the Shakespeare authorship question, publishing in 1920 his theory that de Vere was the author of most of the poems and plays published in Shakespeare&#x27;s name. He later argued that de Vere had also written works published under the names of other poets.

==Life==

Looney was born in South Shields to John Thomas and Annie Looney. His father had a shoe-making shop at 91 West Holborn in the centre of the town. Both his parents were Methodists. His family came from the Isle of Man and claimed descent from the Earls of Derby. He grew up in a strong evangelical environment, and determined to become a minister at the age of 16. 

While studying at the Chester Diocesan College, he lost his faith. He later embraced the theories of the positivist philosopher Auguste Comte, becoming a proponent of the Comtean &quot;Religion of Humanity&quot; and a leader in the short-lived Church of Humanity, an independent British branch of the religion, in which he pioneered outdoor preaching. The Church of Humanity gave special prominence to Shakespeare, naming a month after him in the Positivist calendar, and placing a bust of him in its place of worship.

Looney worked as a school teacher in Gateshead. He is listed in Ward&#x27;s Directory for 1899–1900 as a teacher living at 119 Rodsley Avenue, Gateshead. He later resided at 15 Laburnum Gardens, Low Fell.

After the failure of the Comtean church, Looney devoted himself to research into the authorship of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. He developed his theory during World War I, depositing his claim to priority in a sealed document at the British Museum in 1918. In 1920 he published his work, whose short title is &quot;Shakespeare Identified&quot;, through Cecil Palmer in London. Looney, who resisted his publisher&#x27;s suggestion that he use a pseudonym, argued that the real author of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays was Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who fitted Looney&#x27;s deductions that Shakespeare was, among much else, a nobleman of Lancastrian sympathies, with a fondness for Italy and a leaning towards Catholicism. Looney believed his argument followed the systematic methods prescribed by Positivism.

In 1922 he joined with George Greenwood to establish The Shakespeare Fellowship, the organisation which subsequently carried forward public discussion of the authorship question up to the 1940s. Looney acquired a number of followers and supporters, most notably Sigmund Freud, who read Looney&#x27;s book in 1923. Even at the end of his life, in 1939, Freud repeats his view in the final revision of &quot;An Outline of Psychoanalysis&quot;.

Two of his followers, Percy Allen and B. M. Ward, developed the Prince Tudor theory, which claimed that Oxford and Queen Elizabeth I were lovers and had a son together. Looney was strongly opposed to the theory, writing that it was &quot;extravagant &amp; improbable&quot; and &quot;likely to bring the whole cause into ridicule.&quot;

Looney was a member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne after 1911 and paid handsome tribute to the library; its unique system of operation, he said, &quot;ensured an ease and rapidity of work which would be impossible in any other institution in the country&quot;. Looney presented the &quot;Lit and Phil&quot; with his edition of Edward de Vere&#x27;s poems in December 1927.

He died at Swadlincote, near Burton-on-Trent, where he lodged after being forced to abandon his home in Gateshead because of the heavy German bombing of the area. He was survived by his daughters Evelyn and Gladys. Evelyn had a son who was given the middle name of De Vere.

==Theory==

Looney&#x27;s book begins by outlining many of the familiar anti-Stratfordian arguments about Shakespeare of Stratford&#x27;s supposedly poor education and unpoetic personality. He also criticises the methods adopted by many previous anti-Stratfordians, especially the Baconian tendency to search for ciphers. Looney considers it unlikely that an author who wished to conceal his identity would leave such messages. He then goes on to identify the influence of Frank Harris&#x27;s book &quot;The Man Shakespeare&quot;, which uses the plays to find evidence of Shakespeare&#x27;s beliefs and interests. 

Looney states that it is possible to use this method to identify the type of person who must have written the works. He considered that lower class characters were portrayed as buffoons and that the author had no sympathy for the middle-classes. He was, however, dedicated to old-fashioned feudal ideals of nobility and service. He also believed in a highly structured, dutiful and ordered society.

For Looney the plays expressed a distinct political vision that combined elements of feudalism and modern scepticism towards traditional religion. He also believed that events and characters in the plays must correspond to the life of the author. Studying the biographies of Elizabethan aristocrats, he became convinced that Edward de Vere&#x27;s career and personal experience could be mapped onto the action of the plays. Since de Vere died in 1604, many years before a number of Shakespeare&#x27;s works appeared, Looney argued that there is an abrupt change in publication history and in the style of plays apparently written after 1604. 

Unusually, Looney argued that &quot;The Tempest&quot; was not the work of Oxford/Shakespeare, but of another author. It had been mistakenly added to the canon. He argued that its style and the &quot;dreary negativism&quot; it promoted were inconsistent with Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;essentially positivist&quot; soul, and so could not have been written by Oxford. He also suggested that the evidence of other writers&#x27; hands in late plays such as &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot; implied that the author had died, leaving them unfinished. Such works were completed and published by others, as were the sonnets, the dedication page of which implied to Looney that the author was deceased.

Looney expanded his views in later publications, especially his 1921 edition of de Vere&#x27;s poetry. Looney suggested that de Vere was also responsible for some of the literary works published under the names of Arthur Golding, Anthony Munday and John Lyly.

==Reception and assessments==
Looney&#x27;s book started a whole new avenue of speculation and has many followers today. In general, alternative authorship theories are dismissed by all but a few English professors and Shakespeare scholars, who accept the historical attribution to Shakespeare of Stratford.

Early reviewers were less than kind. The reviewer for &quot;The Outlook&quot; dismissed the book after reading but a few chapters, writing that it appeared &quot;to have all the paraphernalia of scholarship but little of its critical spirit&quot; with &quot;sweeping suppositions&quot; based on little evidence.

In &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; review, A. W. Pollard praised the author for his honesty in admitting to his ignorance of Early Modern poetry and drama, to which he attributes Looney&#x27;s methods and conclusions. He calls the book &quot;a sad waste of print and paper&quot; and writes that Looney&#x27;s arguments for Oxford are much more strained and incredulous than those for Shakespeare, and also points out some glaring lapses of logic. About Looney&#x27;s declaration that &quot;The Tempest&quot; was not written by the same author as the rest of the Shakespearean canon, he writes:
Having begun, on the usual &quot;Baconian&quot; lines, by insisting that &quot;there was subterfuge in the manner of publishing the First Folio edition&quot;—which implies, if it implies anything, that the publishers were aware of the true authorship—he ends by maintaining that the play to which they assigned the place of honour was by someone else. To be suspicious about gnats and swallow camels seems the inevitable beginning and end of all these identifications of Shakespeare; but Mr. Looney exemplifies the process with a frankness all his own.

In a review of Looney&#x27;s &quot;Poems of Edward de Vere Seventeenth Earl of Oxford&quot; (1921) in the introduction to his edition of &quot;The Paradise of Dainty Devices&quot; (1927), Hyder Edwards Rollins says that Looney reveals little familiarity with poetical miscellanies or Elizabethan publishing conditions. He writes that &quot;The verbal parallels between Oxford&#x27;s Paradise poems and Shakespeare&#x27;s works which Mr. Looney painstakingly amasses are, on the whole, mere commonplaces, often straight-out proverbs, that could be vastly increased in bulk by a person familiar with Elizabethan poetry. They prove nothing except that Shakespeare and Oxford, like all other Elizabethans, indulged in the use of fashionable commonplaces and figures.&quot;

According to Steven May, who produced the standard edition of Edward de Vere&#x27;s poetry, &quot;[t]he motifs and stylistic traits that Looney and his followers have claimed through the years to be unique to the verse of both the Earl of Oxford and Shakespeare are in fact commonplaces of Elizabethan poetry employed by many other contemporary writers. The Oxfordians have failed to establish any meaningful connection between Oxford&#x27;s verse and Shakespeare&#x27;s. Stripped of this argument, the Earl is no more likely to have written Shakespeare&#x27;s works than any other Elizabethan poet.&quot;

By contrast, Oxfordians Warren Hope and Kim Holston, in recounting Looney&#x27;s methodology, say that &quot;[h]aving found someone who met all the conditions he had originally established, Looney devotes a chapter to a comparison of Oxford&#x27;s verse with the early work of Shakespeare, a tour de force of literary and historical analysis which in some ways anticipates the procedures of the &#x27;new criticism.&#x27;&quot;
David Chandler notes that Looney’s psychological method of discovering the true author was more congruent to the traditions of Romantic criticism as exemplified by Edward Dowden&#x27;s attempt to discover the personality of the author by gleaning clues from the works in his &quot;Shakspere&quot; (1875).
Oxfordianism, from the start, assumed something similar.… In the cultural situation of the early twentieth century, Looney is quite understandable. He took the case against the Stratford man, put forward by the Baconians and widely accepted, and combined its conclusions with the post-Dowden desire to read the plays as representing an intimate, credible, psycho-drama.
He goes on to say that Oxfordism&#x27;s principles—late expressions of the prevailing critical fashions of their times—were outdated by changing critical scholarship, and that Oxfordians must find some other way to relate to contemporary scholarship if they expect the theory to be taken seriously outside of Oxfordian circles.
 Oxfordianism&#x27;s premises were soon challenged by the emergence of &quot;impersonal&quot; and formalist criticisms. … Looney&#x27;s theoretical assumptions were … becoming obsolete in 1920, and the following half century saw a more and more determined turn away from biographical criticism …. [Oxfordians&#x27;] work, indeed, seems to have paid no attention to changes in the academic approach to Shakespeare (and other English literature) since 1920. … By contrast, a reiterated claim of Oxfordian literature has been that the case is already, unarguably, complete. … this is akin to the claims made for religious texts…. Reading Oxfordian scholarship one often encounters a slippery area in which it is unclear whether Oxford&#x27;s authorship of the plays is being argued for, or simply assumed.
... Looney&#x27;s conclusions cannot be proved true, and believing them requires some degree of &quot;faith.&quot; Put more simply, Looney made an argument, however much some might like to believe that he merely announced a discovery. … That argument needs to be updated, if it is to stimulate serious academic interest … The biographical approach to literature now needs to be theoretically justified before many of the claims for De Vere&#x27;s authorship of the plays are pressed further. Oxfordians have so far shown an unfortunate reluctance to question how much they work with post-&quot;Romantic&quot; assumptions about authorship. … they need to show that such ideas enjoyed a currency in the late sixteenth century before devoting much attention to the specific case for alleged relationship between De Vere and the Shakespearean corpus. If this is not possible … then at least a much broader case needs to be constructed for the autobiographical nature of dramatic writing at that time.

<doc id="957116" wikidata="Q320718" url="?curid=957116" title="Vladimir Stepanov (dancer)">
<text>Vladimir Ivanovich Stepanov (1866–1896), was a dancer at the Mariinsky Theater in Saint Petersburg. His book, &quot;The Alphabet of Movements of the Human Body&quot; (French: &quot;L&#x27;Alphabet des Mouvements du Corps Humain) was&quot; published in Paris in 1892. The book describes a notation that encodes dance movements using musical notes instead of pictographs or abstract symbols. Stepanov breaks complex movements down to elementary moves made by individual body parts, enciphering these basic moves as notes. This method of dance notation, improved by Alexander Gorsky, notated many ballets from choreographer Marius Petipa. Today, this method is preserved in the Harvard University Library Theatre Collection and is known as the Sergeyev Collection.

Stepanov wrote his book from an anatomical perspective. The movements were written in terms of joints of the body, along with flexion, extension, rotation, direction, and adduction. After taking an anatomy course, he continued his studies in Paris. Once it was adopted by the St. Petersburg school, Stepanov was given the title Instructor in Movement Analysis and Notation; however, he died at age 29. The system continued to develop following his death.

After Stepanov&#x27;s death, Alexander Gorsky printed &quot;Table of Signs&quot; in Stepanov notation. This publication was a slightly enhanced version of Stepanov&#x27;s original work. Many other variations of Stepanov notation were made following this, such as Conte notation and Nicholas notation.

== Stepanov notation ==
In his publication of Stepanov&#x27;s method, Alexander Gorsky stated: “Poses or Movement lasting two units of time we notate with signs called halves (½) as they are made up of two quarters. Poses or movements lasting four units are notated with two half notes connected by arches.” In Stepanov notation, downturns can be written in terms of numbers, putting the different numbers of turns in the same order and pattern the dancer executes them. For example, if the numbers 1, 2, and 3 were written in a straight line, then the dancer would similarly turn three times in a straight line. As another example, if the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are written in a circle, with 0 at the top and the numbers in increasing order clockwise around the circle, the dancer does 5 turns while walking in a clockwise circle. With Stepanov notation, arm movements are written as symbols similar in appearance to music notes with streaks around them. The streaks indicate how the dancer is supposed to move his/her arms and the notes indicate on which beat each arm movement is to occur. A space on the paper specifies the audience&#x27;s location.

=== Advantages ===

Stepanov’s system does not require the study of many symbols to understand it. This system makes it possible to show more than a single movement at a time. Overall, it has been claimed to be a good approach to describing body movement.

=== Disadvantages ===

Stepanov notation encounters difficulty in describing body direction as it utilizes a system of relative &quot;greater than&quot; and &quot;less than&quot; positions relative to the current facing of the dancer, requiring them to memorize the meanings of these terms in relation to every position in the dance. Some might also call the translation from some manuscripts for ballet steps crude due to the difficulty of translating an anatomical movement onto the paper.

<doc id="957128" wikidata="Q260037" url="?curid=957128" title="Alfred Gusenbauer">
<text>Alfred Gusenbauer (born 8 February 1960) is an Austrian politician who until 2008 spent his entire professional life as an employee of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) or as a parliamentary representative. He headed the SPÖ from 2000 to 2008, and served as Chancellor of Austria from January 2007 to December 2008. Since then, he has pursued a career as a consultant and lecturer, and as a member of supervisory boards of Austrian companies.

==Early life and education==
Gusenbauer was born in Sankt Pölten in the state of Lower Austria on 8 February 1960. He was educated at a high school in Wieselburg and studied political science, philosophy and jurisprudence at the University of Vienna, where he obtained a doctorate in political science in 1987. Gusenbauer was federal leader of the Socialist Youth Austria (SJÖ) from 1984 to 1990; vice-president of the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY) from 1985 to 1989 and vice-president of the Socialist International in 1989. He was then made a senior research fellow in the economic policy department of the Lower Austria section of the Chamber of Labour from 1990 to 1999.

==Chairman of the Social Democratic Party==
In 1991, Gusenbauer was elected SPÖ chairman in Ybbs an der Donau and a member of the Lower Austria party executive following the resignation of SPÖ chairman Viktor Klima. In the same year he was elected to the Bundesrat (the upper house of the Austrian Parliament) as a deputy for Lower Austria. He was a member of the Austrian delegation to the parliamentary meeting of the Council of Europe in 1991 and was chairman of the social committee of the Council of Europe from 1995 to 1998.

In the Bundesrat, Gusenbauer was chairman of the Committee for Development Co-operation from 1996 to 1999. In 2000, he was elected leader of the SPÖ Group in the Bundesrat and also as secretary-general of the SPÖ. Under his leadership in the 2002 elections the SPÖ improved its vote and gained four seats, but failed to defeat the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) government of Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel. Gusenbauer had campaigned on a platform of more social spending and certain tax cuts.

During 2006, the SPÖ was handicapped by its involvement in the &quot;BAWAG scandal&quot; in which directors of the BAWAG, an Austrian bank owned by the Austrian Trade Union Federation (Österreichischer Gewerkschaftsbund, ÖGB), were accused of corruption, embezzlement and illicit speculation. The scandal led in March to the resignation of ÖGB head Fritz Verzetnitsch. The SPÖ as a party was not involved in the fraud but Gusenbauer found it politically expedient to exclude ÖGB leaders from the lists of SPÖ candidates, drawing criticism from the ÖGB.

==Chancellor of Austria==
After the 2006 elections, the SPÖ was the largest single party but had no absolute majority of the parliamentary seats. A grand coalition between the ÖVP and the SPÖ was considered the most likely outcome. After prolonged negotiations, Gusenbauer became chancellor on 11 January 2007 at the head of an SPÖ-ÖVP coalition.

In July 2007, Gusenbauer led the Austrian delegation to the 119th session of the International Olympic Committee in Guatemala City to present the proposal for Salzburg as host of the 2014 Winter Olympics; the proposal eventually lost against Sochi, whose bid was presented by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

Gusenbauer immediately drew criticism because he abandoned central promises of the SPÖ election campaign, such as those to abolish university tuition fees (it was decided by the SPÖ instead that students should do community service for 60 hours, which resulted in student protests) and to reverse the country&#x27;s Eurofighter deal. This provoked public criticism even from SPÖ members. Infighting over Gusenbauer&#x27;s ability to lead his party never subsided from this point onwards. On 16 June 2008, Gusenbauer was replaced as SPÖ chief by his minister of transport Werner Faymann. However, he formally remained chancellor until after the 2008 snap elections that were called in early July 2008 when the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP), led by Wilhelm Molterer, left the governing coalition. His time in office was the shortest since World War II.

==Post-politics career==
Gusenbauer briefly returned to his old post in the Chamber of Labour but immediately took on paid and unpaid positions in the private and non-profit sectors.

In 2009, Faymann prevented Gusenbauer&#x27;s candidacy for the office of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy by agreeing to the nomination of Johannes Hahn from his centre-right junior coalition partner ÖVP as Austria&#x27;s Member of the European Commission.

===Corporate boards===
Gusenbauer was made a member of the supervisory board of Alpine Holding, an Austrian construction conglomerate, in July 2009 and resigned from this position effective 1 May 2010, when it was announced that Gusenbauer was to head the supervisory board of Strabag (Austria&#x27;s leading construction company) on 18 June 2010. At the same time he was to become chairman of the board of trustees of the private foundation established by Strabag&#x27;s chairman, Hans Peter Haselsteiner.

In an article about Western leaders working for authoritarian regimes, &quot;Associated Press&quot; reported that Gusenbauer works as a consultant to Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev. In September 2013, he became an advisor to Serbian deputy prime minister and leader of the Serbian Progressive Party Aleksandar Vucic. In 2018, reports surfaced claiming that Gusenbauer had met with members of Congress in Washington as part of a 2013 lobbying campaign orchestrated by Paul Manafort on behalf of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.

Other positions include: 
* Citigroup, member of the European Advisory Board
* CUDOS Capital AG, chairman of the supervisory board
* Equitas Capital, member of the board and chairman of European Funds (since 2009)
* Gabriel Resources, member of the board of directors (Member of the Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee)
* Haselsteiner Familien-Privatstiftung, chairman
* RHI AG, member of the supervisory board (since 2013)

==Controversy==
In 1984, Gusenbauer, then leader of Austria&#x27;s Young Socialists, caused controversy in Austria when he knelt and kissed the still-Communist tarmac at Moscow&#x27;s Domodedovo airport – in mockery of Pope John Paul II.

=== Paradise Papers ===

In November 2017, an investigation conducted by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists cited his name in the list of people and organisations named in the Paradise Papers.

=== Manafort indictment ===
The 16 February 2018 indictment of Paul Manafort unsealed on 23 February, as part of the Mueller special counsel investigation, alleges that foreign politicians hypothesized to be Gusenbauer and Romano Prodi took payments exceeding $2 million from Manafort to promote the case of his client, then-president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovich; both denied this and said their work was focused to get closer European Union–Ukraine relations.

<doc id="957130" wikidata="Q1234220" url="?curid=957130" title="Dramatis personae">
<text>Dramatis personae (Latin: &#x27;persons of the drama&#x27;) are the main characters in a dramatic work written in a list. Such lists are commonly employed in various forms of theatre, and also on screen. Typically, off-stage characters are not considered part of the dramatis personae. It is said to have been recorded in English since 1730, and is also evident in international use.

It is customary to give a cast list, which also has next to each character in a second column the name of the actor or actress playing the part; an alternative version lists the names of the actors who played the parts originally. In order not to give away vital parts of the plot some names may be altered, for example, mixed up with another name. Some minor characters may be listed just as the actors who perform the parts.

== Other uses ==
In a wider sense, the term can be applied to any situation in which people or characters play a role, or appear to do so—such as a metaphor, a drama, or a court case. It may also be facetiously applied in a situation where members of a group appear to play predictable roles, often for comic effect.

Literary critic Vladimir Propp in his book &quot;Morphology of the Folktale&quot; uses the term dramatis personae when referring to the character roles of fairy tales, from his analysis of the Russian tales of Alexander Afanasiev.

It is also sometimes used in anthropology to denote the roles people assume when performing a social ritual, as used by Clifford Geertz in his study of Balinese ritual.

==Literature==
Outside the theatre medium, some novels also have a dramatis personae at the beginning or end. This is most common in books with very large casts of characters, as well as children&#x27;s books and speculative fiction.

For example, the opening pages of Jon Krakauer&#x27;s &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; contain a dramatis personae.

Other examples include &quot;&quot; by Harry Turtledove, and &quot;The Horus Heresy&quot; by various authors. Tamsyn Muir&#x27;s &quot;Gideon the Ninth&quot; begins with a dramatis personae.

==Sociology and cultural studies==
The term is used to describe the multiple identifications one may adopt in an attempt to emphasize the expression of one&#x27;s own individualism. An individuality is never obtained, as this process of establishing dramatis personae creates a postmodern persona which &#x27;wears many hats&#x27;, each different hat worn for a different group or surroundings. A logic of identity and individuality is replaced by a more &#x27;superficial, tactile logic of identification where individuals become more mask-like personae with mutable selves.&#x27; This self can no longer be theorized or based solely on an individual&#x27;s job or productive function. The term was used by Karl Marx throughout , where the capitalist and worker are introduced as dramatis personae in human hinders.

<doc id="957136" wikidata="Q7967094" url="?curid=957136" title="Wand Records">
<text>Wand Records was an American independent record label, started by Florence Greenberg in 1961 as a subsidiary of Scepter Records. Artists on Wand Records included The Isley Brothers, The Kingsmen, Mel Wynn &amp; the Rhythm Aces, Chuck Jackson, and the Monzas.

In 1976, Greenberg retired from the business and sold her record labels to Springboard International. When Springboard went bankrupt, Gusto Records acquired the catalog. The Kingsmen acquired full ownership of their Wand catalog in court from Gusto for non-payment of royalties.

==Wand label artists==
Chuck Jackson was the first artist signed to Wand. His single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Cry&quot; (Wand 106) went to No. 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 5 on the R&amp;B chart in 1961. The Isley Brothers released their classic single &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; (Wand 124), which peaked at No. 17 on the Hot 100 and No. 2 on the R&amp;B chart in 1962. In 1963, the Kingsmen released &quot;Louie Louie&quot; (Wand 143), which reached No. 2 on the Hot 100. Maxine Brown had a number for singles released on the label, including &quot;Oh No Not My Baby&quot; (Wand 162) in 1964.

Some artists to have one-off releases include Benny Gordon with &quot;Gonna Give Her All The Love I Got&quot;, and a singer called Al Wilson. For some time there has been speculation and discussion among some Northern soul collectors and enthusiasts that the single &quot;Help Me&quot;, composed and produced by Johnny Northern and Ralph Bailey, arranged by Robert Banks, is not the same Al Wilson who recorded &quot;The Snake&quot;. It is believed by some that this may be a completely different singer who happened to have the same name.

<text>Fastball is an American rock band. It was formed in Austin, Texas, in 1992. The band originally called themselves Magneto U.S.A., and changed their name after signing with Hollywood Records.

In 1998, their album &quot;All the Pain Money Can Buy&quot; reached platinum sales within six months of its release, and stayed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for a year. Their songs &quot;The Way&quot; and &quot;Out of My Head&quot; reached #1 and #14 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Adult Alternative Songs chart, respectively. In addition, the group has been nominated for two Grammy Awards – Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for &quot;The Way&quot;, and Best Long Form Music Video for their promotional video &quot;The Way&quot;. They also received five The Austin Chronicle awards: 1998&#x27;s Album of the Year, Best Video, Best Single/EP, Band of the Year, and 1995&#x27;s Best Pop Band.

In late 2021, Fastball started a Patreon campaign supporting the release of new music, as well as demos of their songs and the stories behind them.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
In 1992, Tony Scalzo, Miles Zuniga, and Joey Shuffield formed Fastball in Austin, Texas. Zuniga and Shuffield first played together in a band called Big Car. After a stint with another group called Wild Seeds, Shuffield introduced Zuniga to Scalzo, who had played in a band called the Goods in Orange County, California. The trio decided to form their own band, and began playing around the Austin area.

When they first started out, the band tried out several names, such as Star 69, Magneto, Magneto USA, Ed Clark&#x27;s Business Bible, and Starchy, before finally deciding to adopt the name Fastball in 1995. Zuniga told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that it was named after the band&#x27;s favorite pornographic film, and said that &quot;It really has no meaning behind it.&quot;

=== &quot;Make Your Mama Proud&quot; ===
Fastball quickly built a strong following in the Austin area, and created a regional buzz. As a result, a local journalist spotted them, and suggested that Hollywood Records check them out. They did, and Fastball soon signed a recording contract. Scalzo and Zuniga took turns singing and writing the songs, while Shuffield backed them up on drums. In 1996, &quot;Make Your Mama Proud&quot; arrived in stores. The album didn&#x27;t sell very well, but it did win the &quot;Best Pop Band&quot; category at the Austin Music Awards (they tied with another local Austin band, The Wannabes). The following year, the members of Fastball were unsure of their future.

=== &quot;All the Pain Money Can Buy&quot; ===
The members of Fastball still had side jobs as late as January 1998. Tony Scalzo worked the graveyard shift at The Bagel Manufactory in Austin. He, Shuffield, and Zuniga would be on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; just four months later. Fastball&#x27;s second album, &quot;All the Pain Money Can Buy&quot;, was released on Hollywood Records. Within just six months, it had sold more than a million copies.

The single &quot;The Way&quot; stayed on top of Billboard&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks chart for seven weeks, and was a top-five hit on Billboard&#x27;s Top 40 Mainstream chart. Scalzo was inspired to write the song in 1997 after reading a news article about Lela and Raymond Howard, an elderly couple who had disappeared in Texas. Though Lela had Alzheimer&#x27;s and Raymond was recovering from brain surgery, the couple had been driving to a local festival. They were discovered two weeks later, dead, at the bottom of a ravine near Hot Springs, Arkansas, hundreds of miles off their intended route. Scalzo chose to imagine that they began reminiscing and decided to become ethereal beings on a permanent romantic trip, the answer to the song&#x27;s question, &quot;Where were they going without ever knowing the way?&quot;

Fastball followed up &quot;The Way&quot; with a second single, &quot;Fire Escape&quot;, and a third single, &quot;Out of My Head&quot;, which reached the top ten on Billboard&#x27;s Top 40 chart and was a top ten hit on the Adult Top 40 chart for 29 weeks. The album&#x27;s promotional tour featured Marcy Playground and Everclear, after which Fastball moved to the H.O.R.D.E. tour.

In 1999, Fastball received two Grammy Award nominations as a result of &quot;All the Pain Money Can Buy&quot;. One was for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, and the other was Best Long Form Video for &quot;The Way&quot;. They also received an MTV Award nomination for Best New Artist.

=== &quot;The Harsh Light of Day&quot; ===
The group headed back into the studio to record their third album, &quot;The Harsh Light of Day&quot;. Produced by Julian Raymond and Fastball, the album was released in September 2000.

The release included &quot;You&#x27;re an Ocean&quot;, which featured the piano stylings of Billy Preston (who previously collaborated with The Beatles). Singer-guitarist Brian Setzer also contributed to the album with Latin guitar on &quot;Love Is Expensive and Free.&quot; &quot;Instead of tailoring the music for short attention spans, we tried to make an album that holds up well to extensive listening... kind of cinematic, where you notice new themes entering the frame each time you see the film,&quot; Zuniga said in the band&#x27;s record company bio.

Although &quot;The Harsh Light of Day&quot; sold fewer than 85,000 copies (compared to &quot;All The Pain Money Can Buy&#x27;s&quot; 1,000,000+), the trio didn&#x27;t lose steam and chalked it up to lacking a musical category to fit into. &quot;You can&#x27;t write down what we do in a sentence&quot; Zuniga told Mac Randall at Launch.com. &quot;Marketing us is a problem. But in a way, that&#x27;s our saving grace also, because you can&#x27;t find an easy angle to summarize us and exploit us. We might sell more records if you could, but at the same time, it forces people that really want to be interested in us to pay a little more attention to what we&#x27;re doing.&quot;

In October 2000, Fastball began touring in support of &quot;The Harsh Light of Day&quot; in Amsterdam. Despite the slowed success, the members of the group didn&#x27;t regret any of their creative decisions, and their aim remained true. &quot;It makes me feel proud that we&#x27;re one of these song-oriented guitar bands&quot; Scalzo told Richard Skanse in &quot;Rolling Stone.&quot; &quot;I think there&#x27;s a couple of bands that are still putting out real good quality guitar rock songs, and I think we&#x27;re one of them.&quot;

=== &quot;Keep Your Wig On&quot; ===

In June 2004, Fastball released their fourth album, &quot;Keep Your Wig On&quot;, on a new record label, Rykodisc. &quot;Keep Your Wig On&quot; was home to singles &quot;Airstream&quot;, &quot;Drifting Away&quot;, and &quot;Lou-ee, Lou-ee&quot;, with the last being released as a single in Europe only.

In 2007, &quot;The Way&quot; was voted No.94 on VH1&#x27;s television special, The 100 Greatest Songs of the 90&#x27;s.

=== &quot;Little White Lies&quot; and solo projects===
On April 14, 2009, Fastball released its fifth album, &quot;Little White Lies&quot;. The album was co-produced by Zuniga and experienced producer CJ Eiriksson, with mixing by Bob Clearmountain.

Scalzo and Zuniga would work on separate solo projects in the following years, with Zuniga&#x27;s solo album, &quot;These Ghosts Have Bones&quot;, being released in September 2011 and Scalzo releasing &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; in February 2013. Both were successfully funded with the help of their respective Kickstarter campaigns.

In April 2013, a new single titled &quot;Love Comes in Waves&quot; was released to digital outlets. The video premiered on YouTube on July 23, 2013.

=== &quot;Step Into Light&quot; ===
On February 5, 2015, the band began recording a new album at The Bubble recording studio in Austin. In March, the band announced that &quot;Love Comes in Waves&quot; would be featured on the band&#x27;s forthcoming album &quot;Step Into Light&quot;, which was released on May 19. A video for a second song from the album, &quot;I Will Never Let You Down&quot;, was released in early March 2017.

In mid-September 2017, the band played a living room concert at the home of Los Angeles–based comic Chet Wild following a nearly year-long Twitter campaign (#FastballAtChets). The concert raised $12,500 via Indiegogo to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. Several attendees at the concert took part in the filming of the video for &quot;Best Friend&quot; earlier that day, directed by Nigel Dick.

=== &quot;The Help Machine&quot; ===
In 2018 and 2019, the band debuted new songs &quot;The Girl You Pretended to Be&quot;, &quot;Help Machine&quot; and &quot;All Gone Fuzzy,&quot; from &quot;The Help Machine&quot;, their seventh album, which was released on October 18, 2019.

=== &quot;The Deep End&quot; ===
Fastball digitally released their eighth album, &quot;The Deep End&quot;, on June 17, 2022.

<doc id="957160" wikidata="Q583998" url="?curid=957160" title="Will to power">
<text>The will to power () is a concept in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. The will to power describes what Nietzsche may have believed to be the main driving force in humans. However, the concept was never systematically defined in Nietzsche&#x27;s work, leaving its interpretation open to debate. Usage of the term by Nietzsche can be summarized as self-determination, the concept of actualizing one&#x27;s will onto one&#x27;s self or one&#x27;s surroundings, and coincides heavily with egoism.

== &quot;Kraft&quot; vs. &quot;Macht&quot; ==

Some of the misconceptions of the will to power, including Nazi appropriation of Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy, arise from overlooking Nietzsche&#x27;s distinction between &quot;Kraft&quot; (&quot;force&quot; or &quot;strength&quot;) and &quot;Macht&quot; (&quot;power&quot; or &quot;might&quot;). &quot;Kraft&quot; is primordial strength that may be exercised by anything possessing it, while &quot;Macht&quot; is, within Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy, closely tied to sublimation and &quot;self-overcoming&quot;, the conscious channeling of &quot;Kraft&quot; for creative purposes.

== Early influences ==

Nietzsche&#x27;s early thinking was influenced by that of Arthur Schopenhauer, whom he first discovered in 1865. Schopenhauer puts a central emphasis on will and in particular has a concept of the &quot;will to live&quot;. Writing a generation before Nietzsche, he explained that the universe and everything in it is driven by a primordial will to live, which results in a desire in all living creatures to avoid death and to procreate. For Schopenhauer, this will is the most fundamental aspect of reality – more fundamental even than being.

Another important influence was Roger Joseph Boscovich, whom Nietzsche discovered and learned about through his reading, in 1866, of Friedrich Albert Lange&#x27;s 1865 &quot;Geschichte des Materialismus&quot; (&quot;History of Materialism&quot;). As early as 1872, Nietzsche went on to study Boscovich&#x27;s book &quot;Theoria Philosophia Naturalis&quot; for himself. Nietzsche makes his only reference in his published works to Boscovich in &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, where he declares war on &quot;soul-atomism&quot;. Boscovich had rejected the idea of &quot;materialistic atomism&quot;, which Nietzsche calls &quot;one of the best refuted theories there is&quot;. The idea of centers of force would become central to Nietzsche&#x27;s later theories of &quot;will to power&quot;.

== Appearance of the concept in Nietzsche&#x27;s work ==

As the 1880s began, Nietzsche began to speak of the &quot;Desire for Power&quot; (&quot;Machtgelüst&quot;); this appeared in &quot;The Wanderer and his Shadow&quot; (1880) and &quot;Daybreak&quot; (1881). &quot;Machtgelüst&quot;, in these works, is the pleasure of the feeling of power and the hunger to overpower.

Wilhelm Roux published his &quot;The Struggle of Parts in the Organism&quot; (&quot;Der Kampf der Teile im Organismus&quot;) in 1881, and Nietzsche first read it that year. The book was a response to Darwinian theory, proposing an alternative mode of evolution. Roux was a disciple of and influenced by Ernst Haeckel, who believed the struggle to survive occurred at the cellular level. The various cells and tissues struggle for finite resources, so that only the strongest survive. Through this mechanism, the body grows stronger and better adapted. Rejecting natural selection, Roux&#x27;s model assumed a neo-Lamarckian or pangenetic model of inheritance.

Nietzsche began to expand on the concept of &quot;Machtgelüst&quot; in &quot;The Gay Science&quot; (1882), where in a section titled &quot;On the doctrine of the feeling of power&quot;, he connects the desire for cruelty with the pleasure in the feeling of power. Elsewhere in &quot;The Gay Science&quot; he notes that it is only &quot;in intellectual beings that pleasure, displeasure, and will are to be found&quot;, excluding the vast majority of organisms from the desire for power.

Léon Dumont (1837–77), whose 1875 book &quot;Théorie scientifique de la sensibilité, le plaisir et la peine&quot; Nietzsche read in 1883, seems to have exerted some influence on this concept. Dumont believed that pleasure is related to increases in force. In &quot;The Wanderer&quot; and &quot;Daybreak&quot;, Nietzsche had speculated that pleasures such as cruelty are pleasurable because of exercise of power. But Dumont provided a physiological basis for Nietzsche&#x27;s speculation. Dumont&#x27;s theory also would have seemed to confirm Nietzsche&#x27;s claim that pleasure and pain are reserved for intellectual beings, since, according to Dumont, pain and pleasure require a coming to consciousness and not just a sensing.

In 1883 Nietzsche coined the phrase &quot;Wille zur Macht&quot; in &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;. The concept, at this point, was no longer limited to only those intellectual beings that can actually experience the feeling of power; it now applied to all life. The phrase &quot;Wille zur Macht&quot; first appears in part 1, &quot;1001 Goals&quot; (1883), then in part 2, in two sections, &quot;Self-Overcoming&quot; and &quot;Redemption&quot; (later in 1883). &quot;Self-Overcoming&quot; describes it in most detail, saying it is an &quot;unexhausted procreative will of life&quot;. There is will to power where there is life and even the strongest living things will risk their lives for more power. This suggests that the will to power is stronger than the will to survive.

Schopenhauer&#x27;s will to live (&quot;Wille zum Leben&quot;) thus became a subsidiary to the will to power, which is the stronger will. Nietzsche thinks his notion of the will to power is far more useful than Schopenhauer&#x27;s will to live for explaining various events, especially human behavior—for example, Nietzsche uses the will to power to explain both ascetic life-denying impulses and strong life-affirming impulses as well as both master and slave morality. He also finds the will to power to offer much richer explanations than utilitarianism&#x27;s notion that all people really want to be happy, or the Platonist notion that people want to be unified with the Good.

Nietzsche read William Rolph’s &quot;Biologische Probleme&quot; around mid-1884, and it clearly interested him, for his copy is heavily annotated. He made many notes concerning Rolph. Rolph was another evolutionary anti-Darwinist like Roux, who wished to argue for evolution by a different mechanism than natural selection. Rolph argued that all life seeks primarily to expand itself. Organisms fulfill this need through assimilation, trying to make as much of what is found around them into part of themselves, for example by seeking to increase intake and nutriment. Life forms are naturally insatiable in this way.

Nietzsche&#x27;s next published work was &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; (1886), where the influence of Rolph seems apparent. Nietzsche writes,

&quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; has the most references to &quot;will to power&quot; in his published works, appearing in 11 aphorisms. The influence of Rolph and its connection to &quot;will to power&quot; also continues in book 5 of &quot;Gay Science&quot; (1887) where Nietzsche describes &quot;will to power&quot; as the instinct for &quot;expansion of power&quot; fundamental to all life.

Carl Nägeli&#x27;s 1884 book &quot;Mechanisch-physiologische Theorie der Abstammungslehre&quot;, which Nietzsche acquired around 1886 and subsequently read closely, also had considerable influence on his theory of will to power. Nietzsche wrote a letter to Franz Overbeck about it, noting that it has &quot;been sheepishly put aside by Darwinists&quot;. Nägeli believed in a &quot;perfection principle&quot;, which led to greater complexity. He called the seat of heritability the idioplasma, and argued, with a military metaphor, that a more complex, complicatedly ordered idioplasma would usually defeat a simpler rival. In other words, he is also arguing for internal evolution, similar to Roux, except emphasizing complexity as the main factor instead of strength.

Thus, Dumont&#x27;s pleasure in the expansion of power, Roux&#x27;s internal struggle, Nägeli&#x27;s drive towards complexity, and Rolph&#x27;s principle of insatiability and assimilation are fused together into the biological side of Nietzsche&#x27;s theory of will to power, which is developed in a number of places in his published writings. Having derived the &quot;will to power&quot; from three anti-Darwin evolutionists, as well as Dumont, it seems appropriate that he should use his &quot;will to power&quot; as an anti-Darwinian explanation of evolution. He expresses a number of times the idea that adaptation and the struggle to survive is a secondary drive in the evolution of animals, behind the desire to expand one&#x27;s power – the &quot;will to power&quot;.

Nonetheless, in his notebooks he continues to expand the theory of the will to power. Influenced by his earlier readings of Boscovich, he began to develop a physics of the will to power. The idea of matter as centers of force is translated into matter as centers of will to power. Nietzsche wanted to slough off the theory of matter, which he viewed as a relic of the metaphysics of substance.

These ideas of an all-inclusive physics or metaphysics built upon the will to power do not appear to arise anywhere in his published works or in any of the final books published posthumously, except in the above-mentioned aphorism from &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot;, where he references Boscovich (section 12). It does recur in his notebooks, but not all scholars treat these ideas as part of his thought.

== Will to power and eternal recurrence ==

Throughout the 1880s, in his notebooks, Nietzsche developed a theory of the &quot;eternal recurrence of the same&quot; and much speculation on the physical possibility of this idea and the mechanics of its actualization occur in his later notebooks. Here, the will to power as a potential physics is integrated with the postulated eternal recurrence. Taken literally as a theory for how things are, Nietzsche appears to imagine a physical universe of perpetual struggle and force that repeatedly completes its cycle and returns to the beginning.

Some scholars believe that Nietzsche used the concept of eternal recurrence metaphorically. But others, such as Paul Loeb, have argued that &quot;Nietzsche did indeed believe in the truth of cosmological eternal recurrence.&quot; By either interpretation the acceptance of eternal recurrence raises the question of whether it could justify a trans-valuation of one&#x27;s life, and be a necessary precursor to the overman in his/her perfect acceptance of all that is, for the love of life itself and amor fati.

== Interpretations ==
In contemporary Nietzschean scholarship, some interpreters have emphasized the will to power as a psychological principle because Nietzsche applies it most frequently to human behavior. However, in Nietzsche&#x27;s unpublished notes (later published by his sister as &quot;The Will to Power&quot;), Nietzsche sometimes seemed to view the will to power as a more (metaphysical) general force underlying &quot;all&quot; reality, not just human behavior—thus making it more directly analogous to Schopenhauer&#x27;s will to live. For example, Nietzsche claims the &quot;world is the will to power—and nothing besides!&quot;. Nevertheless, in relation to the entire body of Nietzsche&#x27;s published works, many scholars have insisted that Nietzsche&#x27;s principle of the will to power is less metaphysical and more pragmatic than Schopenhauer&#x27;s will to live: while Schopenhauer thought the will to live was what was most real in the universe, Nietzsche can be understood as claiming only that the will to power is a particularly useful principle for his purposes.

Some interpreters also upheld a biological interpretation of the &quot;Wille zur Macht&quot;, making it equivalent with some kind of social Darwinism. For example, the concept was appropriated by some Nazis such as Alfred Bäumler, who may have drawn influence from it or used it to justify their expansive quest for power.

This reading was criticized by Martin Heidegger in his 1930s courses on Nietzsche—suggesting that raw physical or political power was not what Nietzsche had in mind. This is reflected in the following passage from Nietzsche&#x27;s notebooks:

Opposed to a biological and voluntary conception of the &quot;Wille zur Macht&quot;, Heidegger also argued that the will to power must be considered in relation to the &quot;Übermensch&quot; and the &quot;thought of eternal recurrence&quot;—although this reading itself has been criticized by Mazzino Montinari as a &quot;macroscopic Nietzsche&quot;. Gilles Deleuze also emphasized the connection between the will to power and eternal return. Both Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze were careful to point out that the primary nature of will to power is unconscious. This means that the drive to power is always already at work unconsciously, perpetually advancing the will of the one over the other. This thus creates the state of things in the observable or conscious world still operating through the same tension. Derrida is careful not to confine the will to power to human behavior, the mind, metaphysics, nor physical reality individually. It is the underlying life principle inaugurating all aspects of life and behavior, a self-preserving force. A sense of entropy and the eternal return, which are related, is always indissociable from the will to power. The eternal return of all memory initiated by the will to power is an entropic force again inherent to all life.

Opposed to this interpretation, the &quot;will to power&quot; can be understood (or misunderstood) to mean a struggle against one&#x27;s surroundings that culminates in personal growth, self-overcoming, and self-perfection, and assert that the power held over others as a result of this is coincidental. Thus Nietzsche wrote:

It would be possible to claim that rather than an attempt to &#x27;dominate over others&#x27;, the &quot;will to power&quot; is better understood as the tenuous equilibrium in a system of forces&#x27; relations to each other. While a rock, for instance, does not have a conscious (or unconscious) &quot;will&quot;, it nevertheless acts as a site of resistance within the &quot;will to power&quot; dynamic. Moreover, rather than &#x27;dominating over others&#x27;, &quot;will to power&quot; is more accurately positioned in relation to the subject (a mere synecdoche, both fictitious and necessary, for there is &quot;no doer behind the deed,&quot; (see &quot;On the Genealogy of Morals&quot;) and is an idea behind the statement that words are &quot;seductions&quot; within the process of self-mastery and self-overcoming. The &quot;will to power&quot; is thus a &quot;cosmic&quot; inner force acting in and through both animate and inanimate objects. Not just instincts but also higher level behaviors (even in humans) were to be reduced to the &quot;will to power&quot;. This includes both such apparently harmful acts as physical violence, lying, and domination, on one hand, and such apparently non-harmful acts as gift-giving, love, and praise on the other—though its manifestations can be altered significantly, such as through art and aesthetic experience. In &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, he claims that philosophers&#x27; &quot;will to truth&quot; (i.e., their apparent desire to dispassionately seek objective, absolute truth) is actually nothing more than a manifestation of their will to power; this will can be life-affirming or a manifestation of nihilism, but it is the will to power all the same.

Other Nietzschean interpreters dispute the suggestion that Nietzsche&#x27;s concept of the will to power is merely and only a matter of narrow, harmless, humanistic self-perfection. They suggest that, for Nietzsche, power means self-perfection &quot;as well as&quot; outward, political, elitist, aristocratic domination. Nietzsche, in fact, explicitly and specifically defined the egalitarian state-idea as the embodiment of the will to power in decline:

Nietzsche thought that the drive is to manifest power rather than self-preservation. He thought it was most of the time incorrect that organisms live to prolong their life-time or extend the life of their species. Resistances are not painful annoyances but necessary for growth to occur. Suffering annoyances and being thwarted in ones attempt to accomplish a goal are necessary pre-conditions for our power. In &#x27;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&#x27; Nietzsche said &quot;And life confided the secret to me: behold, it said, I am that which must always overcome itself.&quot; Nietzsche thought it necessary to have the power to discharge ones strength and thus fulfil one&#x27;s purpose in the manifestation of will to power.

=== Individual psychology ===

Alfred Adler borrowed heavily from Nietzsche&#x27;s work to develop his second Viennese school of psychotherapy called individual psychology. Adler (1912) wrote in his important book &quot;Über den nervösen Charakter (The Neurotic Constitution)&quot;:

Adler&#x27;s adaptation of the will to power was and still is in contrast to Sigmund Freud&#x27;s pleasure principle or the &quot;will to pleasure&quot;, and to Viktor Frankl&#x27;s logotherapy or the &quot;will to meaning&quot;. Adler&#x27;s intent was to build a movement that would rival, even supplant, others in psychology by arguing for the holistic integrity of psychological well-being with that of social equality. His interpretation of Nietzsche&#x27;s will to power was concerned with the individual patient&#x27;s overcoming of the superiority-inferiority dynamic.

In &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot;, Frankl compared his third Viennese school of psychotherapy with Adler&#x27;s psychoanalytic interpretation of the will to power:

== In fiction and popular culture ==

The 1999 4x strategy game &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot; refers to the will to power by naming one of its available technologies by that name. A quote from &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; is given when the technology is discovered by the player.

The character of &quot;The Jackal&quot; in the 2008 Ubisoft game &quot;Far Cry 2&quot; quotes from &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; and the &quot;Will to Power&quot;.

The 2016 4x strategy game &quot;Stellaris&quot; also includes a technology with this name.

Bob Rosenberg, founder of freestyle music group Will to Power chose the name for the group as an homage to German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s theory of an individual&#x27;s fundamental &quot;will to power&quot;.

The first title in the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; trilogy is &quot;Xenosaga Episode I: Der Wille zur Macht&quot;.

On September 8, 2017, melodic death metal band Arch Enemy released an album entitled &quot;Will to Power&quot;.

The book makes an appearance in the 1933 Barbara Stanwyck movie &quot;Baby Face&quot;.

In &quot;Smallville&quot; (Season 1, Episode 17), the Lex Luthor character reveals that his father gave him a copy of the book for his tenth birthday.

In &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot; the dragon Paarthurnax tells the player character that the dragons were made to dominate: &quot;The will to power is in our blood.&quot; Only through meditation has he been able to overcome his dominating compulsion.

<text>Command ships serve as the flagships of the commander of a fleet. They provide communications, office space, and accommodations for a fleet commander and their staff, and serve to coordinate fleet activities.

An auxiliary command ship features the command and control components prevalent on landing ships (command) and also features the capability to land troops and equipment. These forces will be slightly less than those on a pure landing ship due to the nature of the ship as a command vessel and hence will also house the assault commander, the flotilla commander or someone of similar status (generally of NATO OF-7 or OF-8 rank—such as a major general or vice admiral).

Currently, the United States Navy operates two command ships, and , both of the purpose-built . Two command ships, and were converted from Landing Platform Docks (LPD); these ships were decommissioned in March 2005 and December 2006 and sunk as targets in support of a fleet training exercise on 11 April 2007 and as part of live-fire exercise &quot;Valiant Shield 2012&quot;, respectively.

The Soviet Union operated several space program command ships, , , , and the Soviet communications ship SSV-33 &quot;Ural&quot;. These ships greatly extended the tracking range when the orbits of cosmonauts and uncrewed missions were not within range of Soviet land-based tracking stations. Similar U.S. vessels were classified as Missile Range Instrumentation Ships (T-AGM).

<text>Bright Young Things is a 2003 British drama film written and directed by Stephen Fry. The screenplay, based on the 1930 novel &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; by Evelyn Waugh, provides satirical social commentary about the Bright Young People—young and carefree London aristocrats and bohemians—as well as society in general, in the interwar era.

==Plot==
The primary characters are earnest aspiring novelist Adam Fenwick-Symes and his fiancée, Nina Blount. When Adam&#x27;s novel &quot;Bright Young Things&quot;, commissioned by tabloid newspaper magnate Lord Monomark, is confiscated by HM customs officers at the port of Dover for being too racy, he finds himself in a precarious financial situation that may force him to postpone his marriage. In the lounge of the hotel where he lives, he wins £1,000 by performing a trick involving sleight of hand and a character called &quot;the Major&quot; offers to place the money on the decidedly ill-favoured Indian Runner in a forthcoming horse race. Anxious to wed Nina, Adam agrees, and the horse wins at odds of 33–1 but it takes him more than a decade to collect his winnings.

Adam and Nina are part of a young and decadent crowd, whose lives are dedicated to wild parties, alcohol, cocaine, and the latest gossip reported by columnist Simon Balcairn, known to his readers as Mr Chatterbox. Among them are eccentric Agatha Runcible, whose wild ways eventually lead her to being committed in a mental institution; Miles Maitland, who is forced to flee the country to avoid prosecution for homosexuality; Sneath, a paparazzo who chronicles the wicked ways of the young and reckless and Ginger Littlejohn, Nina&#x27;s former beau, who ingratiates himself back into her life, much to Adam&#x27;s dismay. The pastimes of the young, idle rich are disrupted with the onset of a new world war, which eventually overtakes their lives in often devastating ways.

==Production==
&quot;Bright Young Things&quot; marks the feature-film screenwriting and directorial debut of actor Stephen Fry, who cameos as a chauffeur. The assistant directors are Cordelia Hardy (first), Matthew Penry-Davy (second), Fiona Gosden (co-second) and Jonny Benson (third). Jo Crocker, Stephen Fry&#x27;s sister, worked on the film as his personal assistant .

The film proved to be the last for John Mills, who appears briefly in the non-speaking role of an elderly party guest enthralled by the effects of cocaine. The character of Lord Monomark is based on Lord Beaverbrook, who once employed Evelyn Waugh as a writer for his newspaper, the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; (which in the novel and film becomes the &quot;Daily Excess&quot;). Waugh&#x27;s original name for his character was &quot;Lord Ottercreek&quot;, before his lawyers intervened. Monomark, like Beaverbrook, a Canadian, is played by the Canadian Dan Aykroyd.

Exteriors were shot at locations in and around London, including the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich and Eltham Palace. Interiors were filmed in Pinewood Studios. The soundtrack features several standards of the era, including &quot;Nina&quot;, &quot;Twentieth Century Blues&quot;, &quot;Dance, Little Lady&quot; and &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over Now&quot; performed by Noël Coward, &quot;Mairzy Doats&quot; by The Merry Macs, and &quot;Hear My Song, Violetta&quot; by Victor Silvester and His Orchestra.

The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2003, and was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival before its Royal European Charity Premiere in London on 28 September 2003. It went into theatrical release in the UK on 3 October 2003, the same day it was shown at the Dinard Festival of British Cinema in France.

In the U.S., the film was shown at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, the Portland International Film Festival, the US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, the Cleveland International Film Festival, the Philadelphia International Film Festival, the Newport International Film Festival and the Provincetown International Film Festival before going into limited release on 20 August. It eventually grossed $931,755 in the U.S. and £869,053 in the UK.

==Critical reception==

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Mr. Fry revels in the chaos of the plot, and the profusion of arch one-liners and zany set pieces gives the picture a hectic, slightly out-of-control feel. Sometimes you lose track of who is who, and where the various characters are going—but then, so do they. Subplots and tangents wander into view and then fade away, and in the end it all comes together and makes sense, more or less…Period dramas set on the eve of World War II are a dime—or maybe a shilling—a dozen, but what distinguishes this one is its dash and vigor. It does not seem to have been made just for the sake of the costumes and the vintage cars. The camera, rather than composing the action into a presentable pageant, plunges in, capturing the madness of the era in a swirl of colors and jolting close-ups. And Mr. Fry&#x27;s headlong style helps rescue the movie from the deadly trap of antiquarianism&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said the film has &quot;a sweetness and tenderness&quot; and observed that Stephen Fry was &quot;the obvious choice to direct this material&quot;. He added, &quot;He has a feel for it; to spend a little time talking with him is to hear inherited echoes from characters just like those in the story. He supplies a roll-call of supporting actors who turn up just long enough to convince us entire movies could be made about their characters&quot;.

Carla Meyer of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called the film a &quot;witty, energetic adaptation&quot; but thought &quot;Fry, so deft with lighthearted moments, seems uncomfortable with Waugh&#x27;s moralizing, and more serious scenes fall flat&quot;. She added, &quot;&quot;Bright Young Things&quot; is like a party girl on her fourth martini. What had been fun and frothy turns irretrievably maudlin&quot;.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt Fry was &quot;clever&quot; for adapting Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;into a movie that would make Paris Hilton feel at home&quot;, although &quot;By the time [he] lets darkness encroach on these bright young things…the fizz is gone, and so is any reason to make us give a damn&quot;.

Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a slick, no-nonsense adaptation…an easy-to-digest slice of literate entertainment for upscale and older auds that lacks a significant emotional undertow to make it a truly involving—rather than simply voyeuristic—experience…Fry&#x27;s script fillets out even the few traces of a darker underside that creep through in the second half of Waugh&#x27;s original. Modern auds, accustomed to more emotional payback for the characters&#x27; earlier excesses, will come away empty-handed. There&#x27;s basically very little dramatic arc to the whole picture. Still, Fry and his tech team have put together a good-looking, smooth-running movie&quot;.

Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described it as &quot;a brilliant, giddy satiric romp with a discreetly moralistic viewpoint beneath its high-style wit&quot;, &quot;a ball to watch&quot;, and &quot;an incredibly entertaining film with a magnificent cast&quot;, and called Fry &quot;a splendid director capable of visual dazzle and superb ensemble work&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
Fenella Woolgar was nominated for the London Film Critics Circle Award for British Supporting Actress of the Year, the Empire Award for Best Newcomer and the British Independent Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer.

<doc id="957182" wikidata="Q2557447" url="?curid=957182" title="Welcome to the Beautiful South">
<text>Welcome to the Beautiful South is the debut album by the English band the Beautiful South. It was released in October 1989 by Go! Discs and the next year in the United States by Elektra Records. Three singles were released from the album, which became top 40 hits in the United Kingdom: &quot;Song for Whoever&quot; (No. 2), &quot;You Keep It All In&quot; (No. 8) and &quot;I&#x27;ll Sail This Ship Alone&quot; (No. 31).

The original album cover depicted two pictures by Jan Saudek, one of a woman with a gun in her mouth, and another with a man smoking. Woolworths refused to stock the album, in the words of the band, to &quot;prevent the hoards &quot;[sic]&quot; of impressionable young fans from blowing their heads off in a gun-gobbling frenzy, or taking up smoking&quot;; An alternative cover featuring a picture of a stuffed toy rabbit and a teddy bear was therefore made. A second alternative cover was also prepared for the Canadian edition of the album; this version omitted the picture of the woman, and featured only the smoking man.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; stated that &quot;Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway set killer-clever lyrics against clean, techno-free arrangements.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; noted the success of the first two singles, but opined that the rest of the album &quot;offers little advance on that same tuneful but ineffably twee indie-pop formula.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; included the album in their &quot;Top 100 Albums You&#x27;ve Never Heard&quot; list, in 2012.

<text>Scepter Records was an American record company founded in 1959 by Florence Greenberg.

==History==
Florence Greenberg founded Scepter Records from the $4,000 she received after she sold Tiara Records and the Shirelles to Decca Records. When the Shirelles didn&#x27;t produce any hits for Decca, they were given back to Greenberg, who promptly signed them.

By 1961, Greenberg had launched a subsidiary, Wand Records. Through the two labels, she launched the careers of not only the Shirelles, but Dionne Warwick, Chuck Jackson, The Kingsmen, B.J. Thomas, Joey Dee, Maxine Brown, The Esquires, Tommy Hunt, The Guess Who, Tammi Terrell, The Independents and B. T. Express, and gave The Isley Brothers their famous hit &quot;Twist and Shout&#x27;, which was later covered by The Beatles. Other Scepter/Wand subsidiary labels include: Bamboo, Bunky, Cap City, Captain, Citation, Garrison, Jet Stream, Lanie, Madtad, Marlu, Mosaic, Pepper, Realm, Roadshow, Rock&#x27;N, Sonday, Spokane, Stop, Tiffany, Toddlin&#x27; Town and Treat.

In 1965, Scepter moved its offices to 254 West 54th Street in Manhattan, New York City (a building now famous for housing the legendary Studio 54 disco). The building included warehouse space and its own recording studio. Though few albums of note were recorded at Scepter Studios, one was the influential experimental rock album &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;, much of which was recorded there in April 1966, by engineer John Licata under the supervision of Andy Warhol and Norman Dolph. 
The album was ranked number 13 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2003, re-positioned to number 23 on the 2020 updated list. In 2006, it was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Scepter was one of the earliest record labels to release 12-inch singles intended for the nascent disco market. During this revival of the label during the disco era in the 1970s, the label featured LTG Exchange, South Shore Commission, Ultra High Frequency, General Crook, Southside Movement, Armada Orchestra and Bobby Moore.

The label worked with several music industry notables of the period, Marvin Schlachter joined Scepter as a partner in 1960, he became overall vice president and later sold his interest in the label in 1969. Schlachter then ran several other major labels before opening up Prelude Records in 1977. Scepter&#x27;s main 1960s producer, Luther Dixon, was unparalleled in his field as a songwriter for years. It was also at Scepter that Burt Bacharach came into prominence as a writer and producer. Mel Cheren joined in 1970 as head of production, and together with the vice president for sales Ed Kushins launched West End Records in 1976. Cheren worked with Tom Moulton to create some of the first disco remixes on Scepter&#x27;s early 12 inch discs in 1975.

Greenberg decided to retire from the business in 1976, and sold her record labels to Springboard International. When Springboard went bankrupt, Gusto Records acquired the catalog. Dionne Warwick arranged to buy her own masters, and the Kingsmen won control of their masters via a highly publicized lawsuit.

In March 2011, the musical &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You!&quot;, which told the story of Greenberg and the development of Scepter Records, premiered on Broadway to lukewarm-to-poor reviews.

<text>David Crystal, (born 6 July 1941) is a British linguist who works on the linguistics of the English language.

Crystal studied English at University College London and has lectured at Bangor University and the University of Reading. He was awarded an OBE in 1995 and a Fellowship of the British Academy in 2000. Crystal is a proponent of Internet linguistics and has also been involved in Shakespeare productions, providing guidance on original pronunciation.

==Family==
Crystal was born in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, on 6 July 1941 after his mother had been evacuated there during The Blitz. Before he reached the age of one, his parents separated. He remained estranged from and ignorant of his father for most of his childhood, but later learnt (through work contacts and a half-brother) of the life and career of Samuel Crystal in London, and of his half-Jewish heritage. He grew up with his mother in Holyhead, North Wales, and Liverpool, England, where he attended St Mary&#x27;s College from 1951. Crystal is a practising Roman Catholic.

He currently lives in Holyhead with his wife, Hilary, a former speech therapist and now children&#x27;s author. He has four grown-up children. His son Ben Crystal is also an author, and has co-authored four books with his father.

==Career==
Crystal studied English at University College London between 1959 and 1962, and was a researcher under Randolph Quirk between 1962 and 1963, working on the Survey of English Usage. Since then he has lectured at Bangor University and the University of Reading and is an honorary professor of linguistics at Bangor. 
Retired from full-time academia, he works as a writer, editor and consultant, and contributes to television and radio broadcasts. His association with the BBC ranges from, formerly, a BBC Radio 4 series on language issues to, more recently, podcasts on the BBC World Service website for people learning English.

Crystal was appointed OBE in 1995 and became a Fellow of the British Academy in 2000. He is also a Founding Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales and is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Linguists. His many academic interests include English language learning and teaching, clinical linguistics, forensic linguistics, language death, &quot;ludic linguistics&quot; (Crystal&#x27;s neologism for the study of language play), style, English genre, Shakespeare, indexing, and lexicography. He is the Patron of the International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (IATEFL), honorary president of the Chartered Institute of Editing and Proofreading (CIEP), and Patron of the UK National Literacy Association. He is a consultant for &quot;Babel - The Language Magazine&quot;, for which he has also written articles.

== Work ==
Crystal has authored, co-authored, and edited over 120 books on a wide variety of subjects, specialising among other things in editing reference works, including (as author) the &quot;Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language&quot; (1987, 1997, 2010) and the &quot;Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language&quot; (1995, 2003, 2019), and (as editor) the &quot;Cambridge Biographical Dictionary&quot;, the &quot;Cambridge Factfinder&quot;, the &quot;Cambridge Encyclopedia&quot;, and the &quot;New Penguin Encyclopedia&quot; (2003). 

Crystal has also written plays and poetry. He has published several books for the general reader about linguistics and the English language, which use varied graphics and short essays to communicate technical material in an accessible manner. In his article &quot;What is Standard English&quot;, Crystal hypothesises that, globally, English will both split and converge, with local variants becoming less mutually comprehensible and therefore necessitating the rise of what he terms World Standard Spoken English (see also International English).

In his 2004 book &quot;The Stories of English&quot;, a general history of the English language, he describes the value he sees in linguistic diversity and the according of respect to varieties of English generally considered &quot;non-standard&quot;. In 2009 Routledge published his autobiographical memoir &quot;Just a Phrase I&#x27;m Going Through: My Life in Language&quot;, which was released simultaneously with a DVD of three of his lectures. His book &quot;Spell It Out: The Curious, Enthralling and Extraordinary Story of English Spelling&quot; (2013) explains why some English words are difficult to spell. His companion book, &quot;Making a Point: The Pernickety Story of English Punctuation&quot; came out in 2015 from Profile Books (UK) and St. Martin&#x27;s Press (US).

Crystal is a proponent of a new field of study, Internet linguistics, and has published &quot;Language and the Internet&quot; (2001) on the subject. Crystal&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; (2008) focused on text language and its impact on society. He was one of the book series editors of The Language Library.

From 2001 to 2006, Crystal served as the Chairman of Crystal Reference Systems Limited, a provider of reference content and Internet search and advertising technology. The company&#x27;s iSense and Sitescreen products are based upon the patented Global Data Model, a complex semantic network that Crystal devised in the early 1980s and was adapted for use on the Internet in the mid 1990s. These include semantic targeting technology (marketed as iSense by ad pepper media) and brand protection technology (marketed as SiteScreen by Emediate ApS). The iSense technology is the subject of patents in the United Kingdom and the United States. After the company&#x27;s acquisition by Ad Pepper Media N.V., he remained on the board as its R&amp;D director until 2009.

Crystal was influential in a campaign to save Holyhead&#x27;s convent from demolition, leading to the creation of the Ucheldre Centre.

==Involvement in Shakespeare productions==
As an expert on the evolution of the English language, he was involved in the production of Shakespeare at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe in 2004 and 2005 in the &quot;Original Pronunciation&quot; of the period in which he was writing, coaching the actors on the appropriate pronunciation for the period, and has since been the consultant for several other Shakespeare plays performed in OP, including &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Pericles&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, and &quot;Henry V&quot;.

<text>Susan O&#x27;Neill, (born 2 August 1973) is an Australian former competitive swimmer from Brisbane, Queensland, nicknamed &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;. She achieved eight Olympic Games medals during her swimming career.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Neill was born on 2 August 1973 in Mackay, Queensland, to Trish and John O&#x27;Neill. She has two siblings, a brother and a sister. Her family moved to Brisbane and she was educated at Lourdes Hill College (LHC) in Hawthorne. Whilst at LHC, O&#x27;Neill excelled in sport, setting school records in 50 m and 100 m butterfly, freestyle, and backstroke. She was also LHC cross country champion and set records for the 13 years 800 m in 1986 and for the 15 years 400 m in 1988 for athletics. All these records still stood as of 2011.

==Swimming career==

O&#x27;Neill won the 200m butterfly at the 1996 Summer Olympics and the 200m freestyle at the 2000 Summer Olympics. She has won 35 Australian titles, 8 Olympic medals including 2 gold, and 24 gold medals in major international competitions. Only Emma McKeon, Ian Thorpe and Leisel Jones have won more Olympic medals for Australia.

At her international debut at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, she won two medals (gold and silver), and continued to add to her medals cache at every international competition until her final Olympics. In front of a home crowd at the 2000 Olympic Games Trials she broke the 19-year standing world record of another &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, Mary T. Meagher, in the 200m butterfly, but was beaten in an upset at the 2000 Olympic Games by American Misty Hyman.

She trained under Bernie Wakefield until 1994, then Scott Volkers at the Commercial Swimming Club in Brisbane.

==Post swimming career==
O&#x27;Neill is an ambassador for the Fred Hollows Foundation.

She provided commentary at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. She was the Oceania athletes&#x27; representative on the International Olympic Committee from 2000 to 2005. When she resigned her membership she was replaced by Barbara Kendall.

On 10 March 2007 during the 12th FINA World Championship, O&#x27;Neill was honoured by the dedication of the temporary swimming pool in the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne named after her for the duration of the competition.

In 2015, O&#x27;Neill made regular appearances on &quot;Ash, Kip &amp; Luttsy&quot; for several years before officially joining the team in 2019, at which point the show was renamed &quot;Ash, Luttsy &amp; Susie&quot;. She continued as a co-host until November 2024. 

In 2025, O&#x27;Neill will remain with NOVA Entertainment, working on shows across the Nova Network as a guest presenter for both Breakfast and National shows next year.

On 14 February 2018, O&#x27;Neill released a single entitled &quot;My Heart Goes Boom&quot;.

<text>A transformation language is a computer language designed to transform some input text in a certain formal language into a modified output text that meets some specific goal.

Program transformation systems such as Stratego/XT, TXL, Tom, DMS, and ASF+SDF all have transformation languages as a major component. The transformation languages for these systems are driven by declarative descriptions of the structure of the input text (typically a grammar), allowing them to be applied to wide variety of formal languages and documents.

Macro languages are a kind of transformation languages to transform a meta language into specific higher programming language like Java, C++, Fortran or into lower-level Assembly language.

In the model-driven engineering technical space, there are model transformation languages (MTLs), that take as input models conforming to a given metamodel and produce as output models conforming to a different metamodel. An example of such a language is the QVT OMG standard.

There are also low-level languages such as the Lx family implemented by the bootstrapping method. The L0 language may be considered as assembler for transformation languages. There is also a high-level graphical language built on upon Lx called MOLA.

There are a number of XML transformation languages. These include Tritium, XSLT, XQuery, STX, FXT, XDuce, CDuce, HaXml, XMLambda, and FleXML.

<doc id="957203" wikidata="Q2746285" url="?curid=957203" title="Forty Thieves (New York gang)">
<text>The Forty Thieves — likely named after Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves — were formed in 1825 and alleged to be the first known and oldest New York City criminal street gang. The Thieves consisted primarily of Irish immigrants and Irish Americans who terrorized the Five Points neighborhood of 19th century Manhattan. Another criminal gang named the &quot;Forty Thieves&quot; which had no criminal ties to the New York gang was formed in London, England in 1828. 

From 1873-1950s, an all-female London criminal gang known as the &quot;Forty Elephants&quot; was also known to use the name the Forty Thieves. Later a criminal gang in Philadelphia called themselves the Forty Thieves. The Kerryonians, another early Irish gang formed in the same year as the Forty Thieves, have been alleged to be the second oldest organized criminal gang in New York City.

==Gang history== 
Originally based in New York&#x27;s Lower East Side, the Forty Thieves were formed in 1825 by Edward Coleman. Initially it was formed to rebel against their low social status but the members soon turned to crime to relieve their frustration. This gang emerged due to prejudice and class distinction. Such social conditions were evident in the Five Points area of New York in the 1820s. Canal Street, the Bowery, Broadway, and Mulberry Street bordered this area, which was a slum infested with mosquitoes and disease. 

The Forty Thieves met at a Centre Street grocery store owned by Rosanna Peers, a notorious fence of stolen goods who also sold illegal alcohol in an underground speakeasy. At Peers&#x27; grocery gang members would be given assignments and issued strict quotas on the gang&#x27;s share of illegal activities. The quota system proved a great motivator among veterans competing against younger members seeking to take older members&#x27; positions. However, in the long term the gang was unable to maintain internal discipline in early New York, and by 1850 the gang had dissolved with its members joining larger gangs or leaving on their own. 

From the violence to the high crime rates, Five Points desperately lacked the aid of government support. The Forty Thieves saw this as an economic opportunity, as they established relations with Tammany Hall. This corrupt bureaucracy provided community services in exchange for money and support from its residents to fund their corrupt agendas. The juvenile Little Forty Thieves, an apprentice street gang of the original Forty Thieves, would outlast their mentors, continuing to commit illegal activities throughout the 1850s before eventually joining the later street gangs following the American Civil War in 1865.

<doc id="957204" wikidata="Q337043" url="?curid=957204" title="Randolph Quirk">
<text>Charles Randolph Quirk, Baron Quirk (12 July 1920 – 20 December 2017) was a British linguist and life peer. He was the Quain Professor of English language and literature at University College London from 1968 to 1981. He sat as a crossbencher in the House of Lords.

==Life and career==

Quirk was born at his family&#x27;s farm, Lambfell, near Kirk Michael on the Isle of Man, where his family farmed, the son of Thomas and Amy Randolph Quirk. He attended Douglas High School for Boys on the island and then went to University College London (UCL) to read English (the department relocated to Aberystwyth due to the war) under A.H. Smith. His studies began in 1939 but were interrupted in 1940 by five years of service in Bomber Command of the RAF, where he rose to the rank of squadron leader.

Quirk became so deeply interested in explosives that he started an external degree in chemistry, but his English undergraduate studies were completed from 1945 to 1947 (with the department back in Bloomsbury) and was then invited to take up a research fellowship in Cambridge; however he took up a counter-offer of a junior lectureship at UCL, which he held until 1952. In this period he completed his MA on phonology and his PhD thesis on syntax, and in 1951 became a post-doctoral Commonwealth Fund fellow at Yale University and Michigan State University. Shortly after his return from the US in 1952, he moved to the University of Durham, becoming reader there in 1954, and professor in 1958. He returned to UCL as professor in 1960 and in 1968 succeeded Smith as Quain Professor, a post he held until 1981.

Quirk lectured and gave seminars at UCL in Old English (Anglo-Saxon) and the History of the English Language. These two disciplines were part of a ten-discipline set of final examinations in the undergraduate syllabus. At that time Old and Middle English, along with History of the English Language, were all compulsory subjects in that course. He also worked closely with A. C. Gimson and J. D. O&#x27;Connor of the Phonetics Department, sometimes sitting in as an examiner for Phonetics oral examinations.

In 1985, he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the University of Bath.

==Survey of English Usage==
In 1959, Quirk founded the Survey of English Usage, working with Valerie Adams, Derek Davy and David Crystal; they sampled written and spoken British English produced between 1955 and 1985. The corpus comprises 200 texts, each of 5,000 words. The spoken texts include dialogue and monologue, and the written texts material intended for both reading and reading aloud. 

The project was to be the foundation of &quot;A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language&quot;, a widely used reference grammar and the first of English in real use rather than structured by rules derived from Greek and Latin models. Quirk and his collaborators proposed a descriptive rather than prescriptive grammar, showing readers that different groups of English speakers choose different usages, and argued that what is correct is what communicates effectively. The work was groundbreaking; one proposed flaw is that the examples used were written by the scholars, not collected from texts, as preferred by one of the tutors at the Summer School, Edward Black. 

==Summer School of English==

One of Quirk&#x27;s favourite enterprises was the London University Summer School of English, where the above-mentioned colleagues and other budding scholars and friends of his came to teach for a month. It was considered the most eminent body of English teachers anywhere in the world. The resident students were foreign academics, teachers and students. He threw himself into the social life with gusto and enjoyed singing Victorian ballads in a Cockney accent over a &quot;couple of pints&quot;. When the School moved away from Queen Elizabeth College to New Cross, numbers fell rapidly. The next and last successful director was the phonetician J. D. O&#x27;Connor.

==Awards==
Quirk was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1976 New Year Honours, and was knighted in 1985. He had openly been a Labour supporter all his life, although he sat in the House of Lords as a cross-bench peer. He was President of the British Academy from 1985 to 1989 and became a life peer as Baron Quirk, of Bloomsbury in the London Borough of Camden on 12 July 1994. He sat on the boards of Pearson Education and the Linguaphone Institute.

==Personal life==
Until his death, in 2017, he resided in Germany and England. His second wife was the German linguist Gabriele Stein. She died on 6 March 2020.

<text>Tusshar Kapoor (born 20 November 1976) is an Indian actor and producer working in Hindi films.

==Early and personal life==
Tusshar Kapoor is the son of actors Jeetendra and Shobha Kapoor. His elder sister, Ekta Kapoor is a television and film producer. He attended the Bombay Scottish School where he was in the same class as Abhishek Bachchan. He then studied at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor for his BBA degree at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business.

Like his father, Tusshar Kapoor is a follower of Nichiren Buddhism. Kapoor is unmarried and opted for IVF to became a single parent to Laksshya Kapoor through surrogacy in June 2016.

== Career ==

Prior to making his debut as an actor, Kapoor worked with film director David Dhawan as an assistant. Following this, he trained as an actor with Roshan Taneja and Mahendra Verma, in their acting school, and in dance with Nimesh Bhatt.

He had a side role in Kareeb in 1998. He made his debut in 2001 under guidance of his Gujarat-based friend Dharmanshu Parmar alias Monty with the blockbuster &quot;Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai&quot;, a remake of the Telugu super hit &quot;Tholi Prema&quot;, along with Kareena Kapoor. He received the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut for his work in the film. He then starred as Rahul in a coming of age film &quot;Kyaa Dil Ne Kahaa&quot; alongside Esha Deol. 

Kapoor starred in two more Telugu remakes &quot;Jeena Sirf Merre Liye&quot; (2002), and &quot;Yeh Dil&quot; (2003), which fared poorly at the box office. He then appeared in Ram Gopal Varma&#x27;s production &quot;Gayab&quot; (2004) and received appreciation for his work though the film was declared below average at the box office. Starting in 2004, Kapoor starred in commercial hits such as &quot;Khakee&quot; (2004), &quot;Kyaa Kool Hai Hum&quot; (2005), &quot;Golmaal&quot; (2006), &quot;Shootout at Lokhandwala&quot; (2007) in which he essayed the role of gangster Dilip Buwa and received good reviews, &quot;Golmaal Returns&quot; (2008), &quot;Golmaal 3&quot; (2010), &quot;The Dirty Picture&quot; (2011), &quot;Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum&quot; (2012), the critically acclaimed &quot;Shor in the City&quot; (2012), and &quot;Shootout at Wadala&quot; (2013).

In 2012, Kapoor took part in the &quot;Fashion for a Cause&quot; event which raised money for homeless children. He has co-produced the film &quot;Chaar Din Ki Chandni&quot; (2012), in which he also starred. He also starred as the lead actor in adult comedies &quot;Kyaa Kool Hain Hum 3&quot; (2016) and &quot;Mastizaade&quot; (2016) both of which have done average business at the box office.

In 2017 Kapoor once again starred as Lucky in &quot;Golmaal Again&quot; and the comedy film was a blockbuster. In 2018 he was seen in a cameo in the superhit &quot;Simmba&quot;, in the song &quot;Aankh Marey&quot; a part of which he has also voiced. In 2019, he starred as Manav in the ALT Balaji&#x27;s web horror series &quot;Boo Sabki Phategi&quot; alongside Mallika Sherawat. In 2020 he produced &quot;Laxmii&quot; which starred Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani, Sharad Kelkar and Ashwini Kalsekar. The film is co-produced by his production house Tushar Entertainment. 

In 2021, he made his debut as an author with ‘Bachelor Dad’ published by Penguin. The book chronicles his journey as a single parent and addresses some issues facing single fathers. In 2022, Kapoor starred and produced crime-thriller film &quot;Maarrich&quot;. He played the role of Rajiv Dixit, a fearless cop who is on the hunt to find a murderer.

<doc id="957216" wikidata="Q7723152" url="?curid=957216" title="The City (1999 TV series)">
<text>The City is a Canadian television drama series, created by Pierre Sarrazin and Suzette Couture, which aired on CTV from 1999 to 2000.

Set in Toronto, the series starred Torri Higginson as Katharine Strachan Berg, a society wife who gave up her career in law after marrying wealthy real estate developer Jack Berg (John Ralston). When her son Strachan (Matt Lemche) is injured in a shooting in the debut episode, she becomes motivated to return to public life by running for a seat on Toronto City Council, thus drawing her into contact with a diverse ensemble of characters representing many different aspects of the big city beyond the confines of her privileged and affluent Rosedale life. In the show&#x27;s second season, she has been elected to a council seat, and must navigate the internal workings of Toronto City Hall to advocate for change while also dealing with the breakdown of her marriage.

The series was essentially a prime time soap opera, although Sarrazin rejected that label because of its association with unrealistic and melodramatic plots, and instead compared the show&#x27;s intentions to socially realistic antecedents such as &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;, &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; and the novels of Victor Hugo.

The shooting of Strachan in the pilot was based on the real Just Desserts shooting of 1994.

The series premiered in March 1999 with a 13-episode first season, and then returned in November 1999 with a 20-episode second season. It was not renewed for a third season.

==Awards==
The show received three Gemini Award nominations at the 14th Gemini Awards in 1999, for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series (Shawn Doyle, Michael Sarrazin) and Best Guest Actor in a Drama Series (Jan Rubeš). It won three awards at the 15th Gemini Awards in 2000, for Best Actress in a Drama Series (Higginson), Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (Shannon Lawson) and Best Guest Actor in a Drama Series (Geordie Johnson); it was also nominated, but did not win, for Best Guest Actress in a Drama Series (Sheila McCarthy) and Best Direction in a Drama Series (Jerry Ciccoritti).

<doc id="957217" wikidata="Q3281062" url="?curid=957217" title="Mal Meninga">
<text>Malcolm Norman Meninga (; born 8 July 1960) is an Australian professional rugby league coach and a former professional rugby league footballer. Meninga is widely regarded as one of the finest players in the game&#x27;s history. He enjoyed a long career in both Australia and England, playing mainly as a goal-kicking . After retiring, Meninga has enjoyed success as a coach, and is currently the head coach of Australian national team.

Meninga broke numerous rugby league records during his playing career. He retired with the most appearances in the history of the Australian national team, and became the top-point scorer ever in State of Origin football. He has since been honoured as a Member of the Order of Australia, has been inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame and has also been named in both Queensland&#x27;s and Australia&#x27;s teams of the century.

Meninga is the only player in history to be selected for four Kangaroo Tours. He toured with the Kangaroos in 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1994, appearing in every test match against Great Britain and France on all four tours. He is also the only player to captain two Kangaroo Tours, in 1990 and 1994. Additionally he is one of five players, along with Wally Lewis, Peter Sterling, Brett Kenny and Gene Miles, who were members of the undefeated 1982 and 1986 tours, known as &#x27;the Invincibles&#x27; and &#x27;the Unbeatables&#x27; respectively. .

As a coach, he began with the Canberra Raiders, before coaching Queensland to nine State of Origin titles between 2006 and 2015. He became coach of Australia in 2016 and led the Kangaroos to win the 2017 World Cup and the 2021 World Cup. Meninga was inducted as the 13th Immortal in 2018.

== Early life ==
Meninga, whose father is of South Sea Island heritage and mother is a white Australian, was born in Bundaberg, Queensland. His father, Norman Meninga, also played rugby league. He has a brother, Geoffrey Meninga.

As detailed on &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in 2016, Meninga&#x27;s great-grandfather Edward Meninga was from Tanna, Vanuatu. Meninga has often been misidentified as an Aboriginal Australian.

Meninga attended Maroochydore State High School, graduating with a Junior Certificate in 1975. He completed his Senior Certificate at the Queensland Police Academy, citing his love for TV police dramas as a key reason for joining the force, and served as an officer in the Queensland Police Service until 1985. It was during his time in the police force that Meninga met Wayne Bennett, who was serving as a constable at the time and would become one of Meninga&#x27;s key mentors. Mal was actually a senior constable and 2IC PE instructor under Sergeant Wayne Bennett at the Queensland Police Academy during the early 80s.

== Playing career ==
Meninga captained Australia for 23 Test matches between 1990 and 1994, and captained the Queensland State of Origin team for three years from 1992 to 1994. He remains the only player to captain two Kangaroo tours, in 1990 and 1994.

&quot;I&#x27;d watch in awe as Mal pulverised the opposing defensive line with his bone-crunching runs. From the safety of my spot six or seven metres away from the action, I felt grateful that I didn&#x27;t have to tackle him because his giant thighs were lethal weapons.&quot;
:Bill Harrigan

=== Brisbane ===

Meninga made his first grade début in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership at the age of 18 with Southern Suburbs. He was selected to play for Brisbane in the 1979 Amco Cup, kicking a goal in their 5–22 final loss to Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. Meninga also made his first appearance at centre for Queensland in 1979, and the following year helped his state to win the first interstate match under State of Origin selection rules against New South Wales at Lang Park, kicking seven goals from seven attempts. Meninga was one of the last players to use the toe-poke kicking style rather than the more accurate around-the-corner style that was starting to take hold. That Origin game was on 8 July 1980, Meninga&#x27;s 20th birthday. Later that year he played for Souths in the BRL grand final, scoring a try and kicking 3 goals as the Magpies went down to Northern Suburbs 17–15. Meninga finished the 1980 season as the BRL&#x27;s top points scorer, with 245 points . A year later however Meninga reached the 1981 Brisbane Rugby League season grand final with Souths, who defeated the Redcliffe Dolphins 13–9.

In 1982, he was named man-of-the-match in Game 1 of 1982 State of Origin series against New South Wales at Lang Park, and was later selected to make his test début for Australia in a test against New Zealand at the Sydney Cricket Ground, being the 540th player selected for Australia. Meninga had an unhappy game though, dislocating his elbow in the 28th minute after a crunching blindside tackle from Kiwi winger Dane O&#x27;Hara, while at the same time attempting to break a tackle from Kiwi fullback Gary Kemble. He soon recovered and played in the centres for Souths in their 17–3 loss to the Wynnum Manly Seagulls in the BRL Grand Final at Lang Park.

Post season he toured Europe with the undefeated 1982 Kangaroos, playing in all six tests on tour against Papua New Guinea, Great Britain and France. Meninga was the Kangaroos top point scorer on tour, scoring 166 from 10 tries (worth 3 points) and 68 goals, including a personal haul of 19 points (1 try, 8 goals) in the first Ashes series test against Great Britain at Boothferry Park in Hull. He then backed that up with 15 points (1 try, 6 goals) in the second test at Wigan&#x27;s Central Park, before adding a further 14 points (7 goals) to his Ashes tally in the third test at Headingley in Leeds. The 1982 Kangaroos, the first touring team to go through Great Britain and France undefeated, earned the Frank Stanton coached team the nickname &quot;The Invincibles&quot;. Mal&#x27;s size, strength, and at that stage of his career his speed (in the early 1980s he was once reportedly timed at 11.9 seconds over 100 metres ) saw him wreak havoc with the weaker English club side defences, as well as the Lions test side. According to BBC commentators Ray French and former Great Britain halfback Alex Murphy, the Lions players simply could not handle the &#x27;Man Mountain&#x27; Meninga. 

Meninga continued his good form in 1983, even though Souths missed the BRL Grand Final. He played in Queensland&#x27;s second straight Origin series win over NSW, while also starring for Australia in the two test series against New Zealand in mid-season.

In 1984, Meninga played a major role in an Oceania team&#x27;s 54–4 victory over an Anglo-French selection in an exhibition match Paris, before returning to Brisbane after the match to continue playing for Souths. After again playing a leading role for Queensland in their third straight Origin series win over NSW, Meninga missed the first Ashes test against the touring Great Britain side, but was recalled to the team for the second and third tests of the series which Australia again won 3–0. Meninga was the BRL&#x27;s top tryscorer and points scorer in the 1984 season, with 18 tries and 154 points.

Meninga continued his good form for Souths in 1985, playing in their 10–8 Grand Final win over Wynnum-Manly. 1985 also saw NSW win the Origin series for the first time, though Mal was selected for the mid-season Kangaroo Tour of New Zealand. Australia won the test series 2–1 against the Kiwis with Meninga in the centres for each test, but on a tour that had seen the NSW vs Qld rivalry come into play in an Australian team, New Zealand won the dead rubber 3rd test at Carlaw Park in Auckland 18–0.

=== St Helens ===
After his displays on the 1982 Kangaroo tour, Meninga was in high demand with English club sides. For the 1984–85 Rugby Football League season he signed to play for St. Helens, who had paid around £30,000 for his services to play in the Australian off-season and he helped the club to victory in the Premiership. He was bought by BBC commentator and former Saints forward Ray French while he was in Australia covering the 1984 Great Britain Lions tour.

St Helens&#x27; rivals Wigan were also after him and had papers ready for him to sign. French had accidentally left the St Helens contract in his hotel room so asked Wigan chairman Maurice Lindsay if he could borrow his; unbelievably, the normally astute Lindsay agreed and handed over the papers. French crossed out any reference to Wigan and changed it to &quot;St Helens&quot; instead, stealing the star from under their noses. Mal Meninga played at and scored 2-tries in St. Helens 28–16 victory over Wigan in the 1984 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1984–85 season at Central Park, Wigan on Sunday 28 October 1984. On 11 May 1985 Meninga added further silverware, scoring two memorable long-range tries as St Helens defeated Hull Kingston Rovers 36–16 in the Premiership Final. Meninga didn&#x27;t manage to serve a second spell at Knowsley Road, for a variety of reasons, not least being a succession of injuries (three broken arms suffered in 1987 and 1988 respectively) that also punctuated his career in Australia. Yet he remains a legendary figure in international rugby league, and his season at St Helens has been described as the most significant of any overseas import in Britain.

===Canberra===

In 1986, Meninga and teammate Gary Belcher left Southern Suburbs to play for the Canberra Raiders in the New South Wales Rugby League. Souths coach Wayne Bennett would join them at the club in 1987 as co-coach alongside Australian national coach Don Furner. Despite suffering a broken arm in a sickening collision with the goal posts in the Raider&#x27;s Round 10 match with Manly-Warringah at the Raiders then home ground Seiffert Oval and subsequently missing 10 weeks (including Queensland&#x27;s successful 1987 State of Origin series and the one-off test loss against New Zealand), Meninga returned to play in Canberra&#x27;s 18–8 loss to Manly in that year&#x27;s Grand Final at the SCG, the last ever Grand Final to be held at the ground. On an unseasonably warm day, Meninga&#x27;s lack of match fitness since his return told (he had only played 60 minutes of the Preliminary final win over Eastern Suburbs the week before) and he was finally replaced by Raiders reserve back Kevin Walters midway through the second half. He scored the Raiders first points in their maiden Grand Final appearance with a penalty goal early in the second half to reduce the deficit to 6–2 after eventual Clive Churchill Medal winner Cliff Lyons had scored for the Sea Eagles before half time allowing them to take a 6–0 lead into the break.

A second broken arm before the start of the 1988 NSWRL season saw Meninga missing until Round 15. After just 4 games back for the Raiders, Meninga played for Australia in their record 70–8 win over Papua New Guinea at Wagga Wagga in country NSW, scoring two tries. Unfortunately for Meninga, after one more game for Canberra he then broke his arm for a third time in Australia&#x27;s 22–10 over a Rest of the World team at the Sydney Football Stadium, putting him out for the rest of the 1988 NSWRL season. Meninga&#x27;s broken arms saw him play only 17 games for the Raiders in 1987 and 1988. His third also saw him miss a place in Australia&#x27;s 25–12 win over New Zealand in the World Cup final at Eden Park in Auckland at the end of the 1988 season.

After being given the Raiders&#x27; captaincy, Meninga led Canberra to their first premiership in 1989 after overcoming the Balmain Tigers 19–14 in extra time in the Grand Final, the Raiders becoming not only the first non-Sydney team to win the premiership, but also the first team to win after finishing the minor round in 4th place. In the post season Meninga travelled with the Raiders to England and captained the team in their 30–18 loss to a Martin Offiah inspired Widnes in the 1989 World Club Challenge at Old Trafford. Meninga successfully returned to top level representative football in 1989, playing for Queensland in their State of Origin series whitewash of NSW (though he did suffer an eye socket injury in the second game in Sydney which kept him out of the third), before being selected to the mid-season tour of New Zealand. After playing in the centres for the first two test wins over the Kiwis, Meninga was moved to the second-row for the third test in Auckland with great effect as he scored a try and kicked one goal to add to his 5 goals in the first test and 2 in the second.

At the end of the 1990 NSWRL season Meninga led the Raiders to another Grand final victory against the Penrith Panthers. He was also the year&#x27;s top try-scorer (crossing for five in the Round 5 match against Eastern Suburbs at the Raiders new home ground, Bruce Stadium) and top-point scorer, and was named as &quot;Rugby League Week&#x27;s&quot; player of the year. After gaining the test captaincy that year in the absence of an injured Wally Lewis (also because of a broken arm) for the one-off test against France in Parkes and the test against New Zealand in Wellington, Meninga was duly named captain of the 1990 Kangaroos. It was his third Kangaroo Tour after being a member of 1982&#x27;s &quot;Invincibles&quot;, as well as being a member of the undefeated 1986 Kangaroos who became known as &quot;The Unbeatables&quot;. Meninga would score the opening try of the Kangaroo Tour in the first game against his old club St Helens at Knowsley Road. After the Kangaroos&#x27; shock 19–12 loss in the first Ashes test against Great Britain at Wembley Stadium, Australia won the next two tests at Old Trafford and Elland Road to wrap up the series. In the second test at Old Trafford, Meninga scored one of the most famous tries in test history. With only a couple of minutes remaining and the scores locked at 10 all, his Raiders teammate Ricky Stuart raced through a gap in the tired Lions defence and sprinted 70 metres upfield. With Lions players converging, Meninga loomed in support and after legally shouldering Lions centre Carl Gibson out of the way, received the pass from Stuart and touched down for a dramatic 14–10 win that silenced most of the 46,615 strong crowd. Mal then went on to score another try in the third and deciding test as Australia won 14–0 and retained The Ashes they had held since 1974. As he also had scored a try at Wembley, Meninga joined legendary Australian winger Ken Irvine (1963), and unlikely try scorer, Queensland and Canberra Sam Backo (1988) as the only Australian&#x27;s to score a try in each test of an Ashes series. Also in 1990, Meninga&#x27;s deeds in leading the successful Kangaroo tour saw him named as Britain&#x27;s BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year, the first rugby league player to win it. 

Meninga&#x27;s good form continued in 1991, helping Queensland to win the Origin series (Wally Lewis retained the Qld captaincy) before leading Australia to a 2–1 series win over New Zealand in the mid-season tests. During the 44–12 third test win at Lang Park, Meninga broke Michael Cronin&#x27;s Kangaroos point scoring record. At the end of the 1991 season after the Raiders had lost 19–12 to Penrith in the Grand Final, Meninga captained the Australians for their tour of Papua New Guinea which included a 2–0 test series win over the Kumuls.

After Canberra&#x27;s salary cap problems at the end of 1991 which saw them lose a number of fringe players as well as some veterans (though most, including Meninga, agreed to actually take a pay cut in order to keep the side together), the Raiders missed the finals for the first time since 1986 when they finished 12th in 1992. 

Meninga&#x27;s form continued though, captaining Queensland in the 1992 State of Origin series (NSW won 2–1) as well as Australia&#x27;s successful Ashes defence against the touring Great Britain Lions. He was in great form in the first test at the Sydney Football Stadium, scoring 2 tries as Australia won 22–6. The Lions produced a shock in the second test in Melbourne with a big 33–10 win, but the Kangaroos, led by Meninga&#x27;s 12 points (1 try, 4 goals) won the deciding test at Lang Park 16–10. By starting in the 3rd test at Lang Park, Meninga played his 37th test, breaking the record of 36 held by Reg Gasnier since 1967. Gasnier was on hand to congratulate Meninga on his achievement. At the end of the 1992 season, Meninga captained Australia to their 10–6 win over Great Britain in the World Cup final in front of a record international test crowd of 73,631 at Wembley Stadium in London.

The Raiders came back strongly in 1993, with their international stars Meninga, Ricky Stuart, Laurie Daley, Bradley Clyde and Steve Walters, as well as try scoring Fijian Noa Nadruku (22 tries for the season) leading the way. Canberra finished third after the minor round, and were premiership favourites until their fateful Round 21 match with the hapless Parramatta Eels at Bruce Stadium. Halfback Ricky Stuart badly broke and dislocated his right ankle in the second half and despite a club record 68–0 win, without their halfback and chief play maker, the Raiders fell apart. They lost their last minor round game to Canterbury-Bankstown 32–8, before meekly going out in straight sets in the finals with losses to eventual Grand Finalists St George and premiers Brisbane. 1993 wasn&#x27;t all bad though. Although Queensland lost their second straight State of Origin series under Menginga&#x27;s captaincy, he did lead Australia to a Trans-Tasman Test series win over New Zealand in mid-season. Meninga though was forced to miss the first test at the Mount Smart Stadium in Auckland as he had been suspended for 2 weeks for the use of an elbow to Manly-Warringah&#x27;s Welsh import centre John Devereux in the Raiders Round 10 match with the Sea Eagles at Brookvale Oval. After the Australians got away with a lucky 14-All draw in the first test, Meninga returned to the team (which was captained by New South Wales captain Laurie Daley in Auckland) for the second test win at Palmerston North on an extremely wet and cold night, as well the third test win at Lang Park.

On Australia Day 1994, Meninga was made a Member of the Order of Australia &quot;for service to rugby league football&quot;. Later that year he played his last game for the Canberra Raiders in the 1994 Grand Final where he led his team to victory over Canterbury-Bankstown to their third premiership in six years. Fittingly, Mal scored the last try of the match after taking an intercept and outpacing Bulldogs centre Jarrod McCracken to score beside the posts (amazingly, despite being a noted goal kicker throughout his career, Meninga declined to take what would have been an easy shot at goal and left it to the team&#x27;s regular kicker David Furner).

During 1994, Meninga played his final test on Australian soil when he led the Kangaroos to a record 58–0 win over France in a one-off test at Sydney&#x27;s Parramatta Stadium in front of an almost packed house of 27,318. He scored a try and kicked 5 goals in his final test for Australia in Australia. Unfortunately for Meninga, in his last State of Origin series for Queensland as both captain and as a player, New South Wales, led by Raiders teammate Laurie Daley, won the series 2–1. The State of Origin series is the only trophy Mal Meninga would not win as a team captain. Meninga captained the Raiders to the Grand final for a record fifth time in 1994. At the end of the 1994 season, Meninga was selected for his record fourth Kangaroo Tour and his record second as captain when he went on the 1994 Kangaroo tour. Meninga became the only player selected to four Kangaroo tours and the only player to twice be named tour captain. Australia again lost the first test against Great Britain at Wembley Stadium, but changes made to the team by coach Bob Fulton saw the Kangaroos bounce back with a vengeance in the second test at Old Trafford with a 38–8 win. With the scores locked at 4–4 after two penalty goals each, Meninga intercepted a Bobbie Goulding pass only 20 metres from his own line and raced 70 metres downfield, with flying Lions winger Martin Offiah bearing down on him. Just as Offiah tackled him, Meninga gave a perfectly timed pass to winger Andrew Ettingshausen who scored the first of Australia&#x27;s seven tries that day. After a poor first test, the second saw a welcome return to form for Meninga. The Kangaroos then scored a hard-fought 23–4 win in the third test at Elland Road to once again retain The Ashes and keep alive their streak of not having lost a test series in England since the 1959–60 Kangaroo tour. On 4 December 1994, at the Stade de la Méditerranée in Béziers, France, Mal Meninga captained Australia to a record 74–0 victory over a very weak French team, scoring the final try of the game, and of his career. In a test career of 46 games for Australia, Mal Meninga scored a total of 278 points (21 tries, 99 goals). Australia won 40 and only lost 6 of the tests Meninga played and did not lose a test series during his time in the green and gold. He played in the centres on 40 occasions for Australia, with one game on the wing, two in the second-row, and three from the bench. On his four Kangaroo Tours as a player, Meninga holds the distinction in playing in every test for Australia on tour, playing all six tests in both 1982 and 1986, all five in 1990, and all four in 1994. Former teammate and coach of the London Broncos, Gary Grienke was hopeful of bringing Meninga to his club for a swansong season, but this did not eventuate.

== Coaching career ==

Following his retirement Mal Meninga openly supported the Super League concept during the Super League war of the mid-1990s. His popularity and playing record as a domestic and international captain were valuable in raising the profile of the rebel competition. In 1995 Meninga&#x27;s book &quot;Mal Meninga: My Life in Football&quot; was published. He was appointed head coach of his old club, the Canberra Raiders in Australia&#x27;s Super League season in 1997.

=== Canberra Raiders ===
Meninga was appointed coach of the Raiders in 1997, succeeding three-time winner Tim Sheens, but achieved only moderate success. In 2000, Meninga was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia&#x27;s international standing in rugby league. The following year, he received the Centenary Medal &quot;for service as a role model and inspiration as a rugby league footballer of the highest standard&quot;. After Canberra failed to make the finals of the 2001 NRL season, finishing fourth-last (11th out of 14 teams), Meninga was replaced by Matthew Elliott as Raiders coach.

In late 2002, Meninga expressed interest in the Queensland State of Origin team coaching job.

During the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup, Wales&#x27; assistant coach Scott Johnson got Meninga to assist with pre-match preparation by speaking to the players and presenting them with their jerseys.

Meninga left Canberra and returned to Queensland in 2005, opening several successful businesses, including a fruit and vegetable wholesale business in the Brisbane Markets, and several Strathfield Car Sound outlets. 

In late 2005, he was announced as the new Queensland State of Origin coach, to replace Michael Hagan.

=== Prime Minister&#x27;s XIII ===
From 2005 to 2012, Meninga served as coach of the Australian Prime Minister&#x27;s XIII. During his tenure, Meninga coached the PM&#x27;s XIII in 8 matches, winning 7 and drawing 1. He was succeeded as coach of the PM&#x27;s XIII by New South Wales coach Laurie Daley.

=== Queensland ===
Meninga made a successful début as the Maroons coach in the 2006 State of Origin series, guiding Queensland to a 2–1 series victory, its first outright series victory since 2001 (this despite the fact Queensland lost the first match). Also in 2006, he coached the Prime Minister&#x27;s XIII side to victory over the Papua New Guinea national rugby league team. Meninga attended the 2007 Challenge Cup Final, in which his old club St Helens was playing, at Wembley Stadium as a guest of honour. On 13 October 2006, Meninga was reappointed as coach of the Maroons for the 2007 State of Origin series and 2008 State of Origin series, both of which Queensland won, taking his record with the Maroons to three wins from three series. When Meninga was given a new contract after the 2008 series, he was quoted as saying: &quot;I want to win six [State of Origin series] in a row&quot;. In the 2009 series, Queensland won the first two games giving them a record fourth consecutive series win with captain Darren Lockyer saying Meninga now stands among the legends in State of Origin. In December 2009, Meninga was named coach of the year at the Queensland Sports Awards.

In 2010, Meninga coached Queensland to a fifth straight series win, and is now regarded as the greatest and most successful Origin coach in history. He also coached them to their first &quot;clean sweep&quot; since 2000.

In 2011, Meninga achieved his sixth straight series as coach of Queensland honoring a promise he made in 2008. The weekend after Queensland won its sixth straight series, Mal Meninga penned a column in Brisbane&#x27;s &quot;The Sunday Mail&quot; attacking the NSW media and match review panel, and labelling them &quot;rats and filth&quot; after he believed that they [the NSW media] had tried to sabotage his side&#x27;s attempts at winning their sixth successive series by charging Johnathan Thurston and David Taylor with on-field incidents (only the latter was suspended) and also attacking NSW coach Ricky Stuart over his decision not to reveal the Blues line-up up to one hour before kick-off (which is when the official team lists must be released prior to a match). He was set to face legal action from the NRL&#x27;s match review panel over his now controversial column, but after negotiations with them on 1 August 2011, the matter was resolved. Meninga still maintains what he has written. For the 2013 State of Origin series New South Wales appointed Laurie Daley to coach against Meninga. This was the third consecutive opponent of Meninga in State of Origin coaching to have been a teammate of the 1990 Winfield Cup Grand Final-winning Canberra side. In 2013, Meninga achieved his eighth consecutive series win with the Queensland State of Origin team.

Meninga&#x27;s record-breaking winning streak ended with the Blues&#x27; win in the 2014 State of Origin series. The Maroons, however, still scored more points than the Blues across all three matches.

In the 2015 State of Origin Series he coached Queensland to their ninth series win in ten years, with the decider played at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane on 8 July 2015 and Queensland recording both the largest score and biggest victory margin with a 52–6 victory.

===Australia===
On 2 December 2015, Meninga was appointed as the head coach of the Australian national rugby league team, succeeding Tim Sheens. This, however, meant that he had to resign from his post as Queensland Origin coach (following events during the 1985 Kangaroo Tour of New Zealand, the Australian Rugby League had decided that the Australian coach could not be a current State of Origin coach), thus ending the most successful Origin coaching stint in NRL history. Before his appointment Mal announced his ambitions that he wanted the International game to become the pinnacle of rugby league like it was in his playing days.

In late 2017, Meninga coached the Australian team to win the 2017 Rugby League World Cup.

In October 2022 he named his Australia squad for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.

Meninga coached Australia in their 2021 Rugby League World Cup final victory over Samoa.
== Political career ==
Meninga briefly campaigned as an Independent for the seat of Molonglo in the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly during the Territory&#x27;s 2001 general election, informally aligned with the socially conservative, pro-life grouping of Paul Osborne, MLA for Brindabella. On Monday 24 September 2001, after being asked why he was standing, he pulled out mid-sentence, stating, &quot;And the thing about that is, I guess, I was a public figure and I was put on the podium where I was just a person out there ... I&#x27;m buggered, I&#x27;m sorry, I have to resign.&quot; He later explained in 2017 that in the six weeks of preparation he had done leading up to the interview, he had never once been asked &quot;why should people vote for you?&quot;.

Subsequently, this incident led to the satirical Chaser team instituting the &#x27;Mal Award&#x27; for their election television shows, presented to politicians &quot;for the greatest act of political suicide during an election campaign&quot;. In an episode, which aired on 28 November 2007, Meninga satirised himself when he was brought in to present the award but &quot;gave up&quot; mid-speech. Additionally, his career has been described as the &#x27;shortest political career on record&#x27; with less than a minute between the beginning of the interview and his &#x27;resignation&#x27;. Something being &#x27;shorter than Mal Meninga&#x27;s political career&#x27; is sometimes used as an expression in Australian English for a very brief thing, especially in comparison to other political careers. A &#x27;Mal Meninga moment&#x27; is another phrase stemming from this event, referring to gaffes where a speaker is unable to answer an obvious question.

==Personal life==
Meninga has been married twice. His first marriage produced two children, Tamika and Josh. His second marriage, to Amanda, produced three children, two boys and a girl. Meninga also fathered an English daughter during the 1982 Kangaroo tour, meeting her for the first time in 1994.

Mal Meninga&#x27;s brother Bevan served 21 years in jail for the 1991 murder of Sunshine Coast teenager Cheree Richardson.

== Honours ==
Meninga is regarded as an official spokesperson for the South Sea Islander community.

The main grandstand at Canberra Stadium is named the &quot;Mal Meninga Stand&quot; in his honour. The Canberra Raiders&#x27; player of the year receives the Mal Meninga Medal in his honour since 2008 and a statue of him has been placed behind the Mal Meninga grandstand next to the one of Laurie Daley.

He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame in 2003.

In February 2008, Meninga was named in the list of Australia&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Players&quot; (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code&#x27;s centenary year in Australia. Meninga went on to be named as one of the centres, along with Reg Gasnier, in Australian rugby league&#x27;s &quot;Team of the Century&quot;. Announced on 17 April 2008, the team is the panels&#x27; majority choice for each of the thirteen starting positions and four interchange players.

In June 2008, he was chosen in the Queensland Rugby League&#x27;s Team of the Century at centre.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Mal Meninga was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for his role as a &quot;sports legend&quot;.

<text>No. 11/18 Group was a short-lived formation of Strike Command in the Royal Air Force. It was formed in 1996 as part of the post-Cold War reorganisation of the RAF. It absorbed the forces of No. 11 and No. 18 Groups, which were descended from the old Fighter Command and Coastal Command functional commands. It only lasted until 2000, when a further reorganisation of Strike Command saw its assets transferred to No. 1 and No. 3 Groups. The headquarters appears to have been based at RAF Bentley Priory, the last use of the underground command facilities there, as the successor groups were moved to RAF High Wycombe.

When 18 Group was amalgamated with No. 11 Group, the new 11/18 Group HQ applied for and was awarded a unique badge which showed the Fighter Command Portcullis and sword design on the original Coastal Command background of blue and white waves. However, they also wanted to keep the old motto from the 18 Group badge, which translated from the Latin to &quot;They shall not pass with impunity&quot; but could not do so as this was officially the motto of a different unit. So, with great ingenuity, they enlisted the help of a Latin scholar who changed the ending of one word so that the motto meant the same as before but was technically different, and 11/18 Group got what they wanted.

==Commanders==
During the few years of its existence, No. 11/18 Group only had two air officers commanding. They were:
* 1 April 1996: Air Vice-Marshal Clifford Rodney Spink
* July 1998: Air Vice-Marshal Brian Kevin Burridge

Later he found a career resurgence starring in the commercially successful mainstream films &quot;Don&quot; (2006), &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot; (2007), &quot;Housefull&quot; (2010), &quot;Raajneeti&quot; (2010) and &quot;Ra.One&quot; (2011). After another big career decline, he made his Telugu debut as an antagonist in &quot;Bhagavanth Kesari&quot; (2023).

Later, he graduated with a degree in economics with honours from Hindu College, Delhi. He went on to become a model. Actress Kim Sharma is Arjun Rampal&#x27;s first cousin.

== Acting career ==

=== 2001–05: Early lead roles ===
Rampal made his acting debut in Rajiv Rai&#x27;s &quot;Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat&quot; (2001) opposite Sunil Shetty, Aftab Shivdasani and Kirti Reddy. Rampal gave a show stealing performance and earned all the attention. He earned critical acclaim for his performance in the movie. Taran Adarsh of indiaFM wrote &quot;&quot;Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat&quot; is a showcase for Arjun Rampal to exhibit his talent. The guy looks dashing and emotes with utmost sincerity. He&#x27;s handled the emotional moments with maturity, which is so rare for a first-timer. A confident debut!&quot; This established Rampal as a leading actor in the Indian film industry. He was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut but swept the awards in the Best Male Debut category at the Star Screen and IIFA ceremonies.

His next release was Ashu Trikha&#x27;s &quot;Deewaanapan&quot;, in which Rampal was paired with Dia Mirza. He earned critical acclaim for his performance, but the film flopped at the box office. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM wrote: &quot;Arjun Rampal carries the film on his broad shoulders and comes up with a sincere performance that is consistent throughout. He is wonderful in action sequences and springs a pleasant surprise in the emotional moments by delivering the apposite expressions.&quot; Ashish Magotra of Rediff gave negative reviews on Rampal, writing: &quot;Among the actors, Arjun Rampal as the hero does pretty much what he has been known to do. He models. His acting capabilities leave a lot to be desired.&quot; His last release of the year was Ashok Mehta&#x27;s &quot;Moksha&quot;. It was actually his first film, but was released after &quot;Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat&quot;. Rampal was paired with famous actress Manisha Koirala in a lead role in &quot;Moksha&quot;. This film marked Rampal&#x27;s third consecutive flop at the box office, but Rampal earned critical acclaim. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM wrote: &quot;Arjun Rampal excels in a role that was difficult to portray. He takes giant strides as a performer and proves that he&#x27;s an actor with an amazing range.&quot; Priyanka Bhattacharya of Rediff considered the movie to be &quot;more a 70-mm portfolio for Arjun Rampal than a story.&quot;
Rampal&#x27;s first release of 2002 was Vipul Amrutlal Shah&#x27;s &quot;Aankhen&quot;, in which Rampal starred in an ensemble cast featuring Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Sushmita Sen, Paresh Rawal and Aditya Pancholi. He played the role of a blind person. The film was ranked above average at the box office and became the fourth-highest grossing Bollywood film of 2002. His next release was Kundan Shah&#x27;s &quot;Dil Hai Tumhaara&quot; opposite Rekha, Preity Zinta, Mahima Chaudhry and Jimmy Shergill. The film was a flop.

In 2003, Rampal played a lead role in Naresh Malhotra&#x27;s &quot;Dil Ka Rishta&quot; opposite Aishwarya Rai. Rampal earned critical acclaim for his performance. Ronjita Kulkarni of Rediff wrote: &quot;Arjun Rampal shakes off his wooden image and comes up with a good performance. He is subtle and convincing in the emotional scenes. He has certainly moved on from &quot;Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat&quot;.&quot; It was ranked the thirtieth film of the year on the basis of box office collections. Rampal&#x27;s next role was in Khalid Mohammed&#x27;s &quot;Tehzeeb&quot; opposite Urmila Matondkar. Rampal played a Muslim in the film. The film earned critical acclaim. Taran Adarsh praised his performance, quoting: &quot;the easy-going attitude his character reflects injects that certain sheen to the enterprise.&quot;

In 2004, Rampal collaborated with Rajiv Rai for the second time in his first action thriller &quot;Asambhav&quot;. Rampal starred opposite Priyanka Chopra and played the role of an Indian commando Captain Aadit Arya. The film was entirely shot in Switzerland. Released on 23 July, &quot;Asambhav&quot; was Rampal&#x27;s only release of the year. Shahid Khan of PlanetBollywood.com wrote: &quot;Arjun Rampal looks good and he suits the mould of the action hero very well.&quot;

Rampal&#x27;s first release of 2005 was Satish Kaushik&#x27;s &quot;Vaada&quot;, in which he played a lead role opposite Ameesha Patel and Zayed Khan. The film was a flop. Patcy N of Rediff praised Rampal, writing: &quot;Arjun Rampal has done a good job; his is a subdued performance, and the model-turned-actor looks great in most scenes.&quot; Rampal&#x27;s next release was Vikram Bhatt&#x27;s multi-starrer action film &quot;Elaan&quot;. The film managed to do well and became an average-grosser at the box office. Rampal earned critical acclaim for his performance in &quot;Elaan&quot;. Subhash K. Jha of IANS praised Rampal and wrote: &quot;Arjun is pretty much on his own. Once again playing a man with responsibilities he brings a controlled conviction to both his scenes with his screen daughter and his engrossing death scene.&quot; Merril Diniz of Rediff wrote: &quot;Arjun Rampal is almost believable as the rugged ex-cop. He has a deep baritone and svelte body language.&quot;

Rampal&#x27;s third release of the year was the mystery thriller &quot;Yakeen&quot;, in which Rampal was paired in a lead role with Priyanka Chopra for the second time. He received acclaim for improving his emotional acting. Taran Adarsh praised his performance, quoting: &quot;Cast in complex role, Arjun Rampal delivers his best performance so far. The role would&#x27;ve lost its bearings had it been entrusted to an inferior actor, but Arjun sinks his teeth into it and emerges trumps. The actor portrays the gamut of emotions with aplomb and delivers a flawless performance. He is truly efficient in sequences when he starts suspecting his wife&#x27;s fidelity in the first half. The shower sequence as also the intermission point display Arjun&#x27;s range as an actor.&quot; Rampal&#x27;s last release of the year was Apoorva Lakhia&#x27;s &quot;Ek Ajnabee&quot; opposite Amitabh Harivansh Rai Bachchan and Perizaad Zorabian. This film featured Rampal in his first negative role as Shekhar Verma, the bodyguard of a child, but is actually a corrupted person. Subhash K Jha praised Rampal&#x27;s performance and wrote, &quot;The narrative has some nice supporting performances, particularly Arjun Rampal who&#x27;s gone both over and under the skin of his bar-owner ex-army man&#x27;s role. Not only does Rampal look right, he feels right.&quot;

His first release of 2006 was the love triangle based &quot;Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai&quot; opposite Bobby Deol and Ameesha Patel. This film was a delayed release. Satyajit of SmasHits quoted &quot;Arjun Rampal has also been promising and it shows in his performance. The media might have labeled him &quot;wooden actor&quot; but he has shown great improvisation in emotional scenes.&quot; Taran Adarsh wrote: &quot;Arjun is awkward at places in initial portions, but gets into the rhythm subsequently. The emotional sequences in the second half clearly indicate that he&#x27;s come a long way.&quot; His next appearance was the multi-starrer anthology &quot;Darna Zaroori Hai&quot;. Rampal starred in the story &quot;Spirits Do Come&quot; opposite Bipasha Basu and Makrand Deshpande, directed by Prawal Raman. Despite a cast of stars, the film flopped at the box office.

=== 2006–07: Producer and breakthrough ===
Rampal reprised the supporting role of Jasjit in &quot;Don – The Chase Begins Again&quot;, a remake of the 1978 movie &quot;Don&quot;. The role had been played by Pran in the original &quot;Don&quot;. &quot;Don – The Chase Begins Again&quot; starred Shah Rukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra and the movie became Rampal&#x27;s first hit. The film proved to be a breakthrough movie for Rampal, although Khan earned the most attention. Taran Adarsh praised his performance, quoting: &quot;Despite the shortcomings, he makes a sincere attempt.&quot;

Rampal established his own production company Chasing Ganesha Films with his wife Mehr Jesia. The first movie under that banner &quot;I See You&quot; was Rampal&#x27;s last release of 2006. He played a lead role opposite newcomer Vipasha Agarwal. The movie was shot entirely in London, England. Like his past movies, &quot;I See You&quot; was also a failure at the box office and received poor reviews. However, Rampal earned critical acclaim for his work. Taran Adarsh wrote: &quot;&quot;I See You&quot; rests on Arjun&#x27;s shoulders. Arjun is efficient in a role that doesn&#x27;t really demand histrionics. He has proved his credentials in the past and his performance in this film is at par with his earlier works. He works best in the dramatic portions.&quot;

In 2007, Rampal starred in an antagonist role in &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot; opposite Shah Rukh Khan and the debuting Deepika Padukone. The film emerged as the year&#x27;s highest-grossing film in India and the overseas market, and became India&#x27;s highest grossing production ever up to that point with a worldwide gross of over 1.48 billion. It was Rampal&#x27;s biggest hit in his career and earned him critical acclaim for his villainous role. Sukanya Verma of Rediff wrote: &quot;Rampal&#x27;s persona exudes too much warmth to pass off as a cold-blooded antagonist.&quot; Rampal won the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Negative Role for his villainous performance in &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot; and got nominations at the IIFA, Star Screen and Apsara ceremonies.

=== 2008–11: Critical acclaim ===

Following the success of &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot;, Rampal started to rise as a successful actor. In 2008, Rampal gave a performance in &quot;Rock On!!&quot; as Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Mascarenhas, the lead guitarist of a band, a poor idealist who never learned that self-promotion is more important than music in a remixed world. Rampal learned guitar to prepare for his role. His performance was widely acclaimed, earning him the prestigious National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor at the 56th National Film Awards, Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award at the 54th Filmfare Awards, IIFA Award for Best Supporting Actor at the 10th IIFA Awards and Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor. This brought wider success and acclaim to Rampal. Noted critic Nikhat Kazmi of &quot;The Times of India&quot; praised Rampal&#x27;s performance and wrote: &quot;If you actually had to choose, then the vote would go for Arjun Rampal who displays a newfound maturity and looks absolutely groovy with his windblown hair and his guitar-strumming stance.&quot; Martin D&#x27;Souza of Bollywood Trade News Network praised Rampal, writing: &quot;Arjun Rampal is slowly coming into his own. After playing a character with a negative shade in &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot;, he returns with another powerful performance as Joe Mascarenhas, the lead guitarist of the band. Vibrant at first, and then subdued he walks the act with a rock star gait.&quot;

Later that year, he starred in Rituparno Ghosh&#x27;s English-language arthouse film &quot;The Last Lear&quot;, alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Preity Zinta. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was received well at a number of other film festivals. Upon its theatrical release in India, Rampal got favourable reviews for his performance. He gave a show-stealing performance. Taran Adarsh wrote: &quot;Arjun is evolving into a fine actor. After &quot;Rock On!!&quot;, this is another performance that would fetch Arjun laurels.&quot; Martin D&#x27;Souza considered it to be Rampal&#x27;s best performance to date. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN praised Rampal&#x27;s performance, writing: &quot;Arjun Rampal shines as the guilt-ridden filmmaker, too ashamed to even apologise for his selfishness.&quot;

Rampal&#x27;s only release of 2009 was Deepak Tijori&#x27;s &quot;Fox&quot;, in which he starred opposite Sunny Deol, Sagarika Ghatge and Udita Goswami. The film mainly received negative reviews and flopped at the box office, but Rampal earned critical acclaim. Taran Adarsh praised Rampal&#x27;s performance as perfect.

2010 would go on to become the most successful year of Rampal&#x27;s career with three back to back hits. The first was Sajid Khan&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Housefull&quot;, in which he starred in a supporting role. The film received negative reviews, but became a huge hit at the box office. Rampal&#x27;s next release was Prakash Jha&#x27;s multi-starrer &quot;Raajneeti&quot;. Rampal received critical acclaim for his supporting role of Prithvi in the movie. Taran Adarsh wrote: &quot;Arjun is a revelation and what a terrific performance he pitches in. He&#x27;s like an untamed lion.&quot; His performance earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award. He won the award in the Best Supporting Actor at the IIFA, Apsara and Zee Cine categories. His last release of the year was Siddharth Malhotra and Karan Johar&#x27;s &quot;We Are Family&quot;, in which he played a lead role opposite Kajol and Kareena Kapoor. It was an average grosser and Rampal&#x27;s first successful movie that featured him in a lead role. Taran Adarsh wrote: &quot;Arjun continues to surprise. &quot;Rock On!!&quot;, &quot;Housefull&quot;, &quot;Raajneeti&quot; and now &quot;We Are Family&quot; indicates the growth of this actor. He handles the emotional moments well, too.&quot;

In 2011, Rampal played the titular negative role in Anubhav Sinha&#x27;s science fiction movie &quot;Ra.One&quot;. The movie became a successful film in India and overseas and received mixed reviews. Rampal&#x27;s new bald look earned him a lot of appreciation and popularity within the audiences. Majority of the fans considered his &quot;Ra. One&quot; look to be better than that of the protagonist &quot;G.One&quot;. He earned critical acclaim for his villainous performance. Martin D&#x27;Souza praised Rampal&#x27;s performance and considered him to be the saviour of the film that was being flawless in the second half. He wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s only after the interval that the plot meanders a bit, loses it sting and almost falls apart like a pixelised image, before Arjun lights up the screen.&quot; Arthur J Pais of Rediff.com wrote: &quot;The best person to gain from the film directed by Anubhav Sinha with more inane and crude sexual jokes than in any recent Hindi film, is Arjun Rampal. His body language and brooding face creates a quietly menacing villain.&quot; Raja Sen wrote: &quot;Arjun Rampal is the best thing in the biggest budget Indian feature of all time.&quot; Aseem Chhabra considered Rampal to be the &quot;most interesting element of the film.&quot;

=== 2012–2018: Experimental roles and career setbacks ===
Rampal had three releases in 2012: Madhur Bhandarkar&#x27;s &quot;Heroine&quot;, Prakash Jha&#x27;s &quot;Chakravyuh&quot; and the comedy movie &quot;Ajab Gazabb Love&quot;, with all three failing at the box office. However, Rampal earned critical acclaim for his performances. In &quot;Heroine&quot;, Rampal played the role of Aryan Khanna, a well-known actor, starring opposite Kareena Kapoor. The movie failed to become a success at the box office with an earning of net at the weekend. It was declared below average by Box Office India.

In &quot;Chakravyuh&quot;, Rampal played the role of a police officer, SP Adil Khan, starring opposite Abhay Deol, Esha Gupta, Manoj Bajpai, Om Puri and Anjali Patil. The film grossed in the first week. However, Rampal earned critical acclaim for his performance as a police officer. Rohit Vats of CNN-IBN wrote: &quot;Arjun Rampal&#x27;s image and dialogue delivery mar his chances, but it is one of his better performances, in fact he has given Abhay Deol a run for his money in double shots.&quot;

In &quot;Ajab Gazabb Love&quot;, Rampal played the double role of twin brothers Karan and Arjun, based on the popular duo of Karan Arjun from the hit 1995 film of the same name. Though the film flopped at the box office, Rampal earned critical acclaim for his double role performance. Madhureeta Mukherjee of &quot;The Times of India&quot; wrote: &quot;Arjun Rampal&#x27;s comic-timing is a revelation. His double-act entertains and adds energy to this comedy.&quot;

His first release of 2013 was Sudhir Mishra&#x27;s &quot;Inkaar&quot;, opposite Chitrangada Singh. Though the film flopped at the box office, Rampal earned positive reviews for his performance by critics and audiences. Taran Adarsh praised Rampal&#x27;s performance, quoting: &quot;Arjun Rampal displays remarkable understanding of the character. Post &quot;Chakravyuh&quot;, which released a few months ago, this is yet another power-packed performance that makes you realize that this supermodel has transformed into a super actor.&quot;

His next film was Nikhil Advani&#x27;s action movie &quot;D-Day&quot;, co-starring Rishi Kapoor, Irrfan Khan, Shruti Haasan and Huma Qureshi. He portrayed Rudra Pratap Singh, a RAW agent. To prepare for his role, Rampal met real RAW agents. He earned critical acclaim for his performance. Mohar Basu of Koimoi wrote: &quot;Arjun Rampal has evolved for the better as an actor. His infallible personality and his portrayal that has hints of both anguish and strength is what makes him stand out despite the presence of more powerful actors. He acted like a dream and that is commendable, to say the least.&quot; Rummana Ahmed of Yahoo! Movies wrote: &quot;As a former army officer and now an undercover agent, Arjun is intense and sharp, his body language apt and his performance precise.&quot; Shubha Shetty of &quot;Mid-Day&quot; wrote: &quot;It is Arjun Rampal as Rudra who amazes with a performance that is undoubtedly his best till date. Rampal, apart from looking as gorgeous as he does, comfortably displays a range of emotions with surprising deft.&quot; Mansha Rastogi of Now Running. com wrote: &quot;Arjun Rampal has excelled himself by leaps and bound and makes a commendable effort of an ex-army man turned RAW Agent delightfully.&quot; Rajeev Masand wrote: &quot;Arjun Rampal does some of his best work here as the rebellious agent simmering with pent-up anger.&quot; Sarit Ray of &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Arjun Rampal (agent Rudra Pratap Singh) brings to the role what he brings to every film – good looks and a standard brooding expression.&quot;

His last release of the year was Prakash Jha&#x27;s &quot;Satyagraha&quot; (2013). Rampal was featured in an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Ajay Devgan, Kareena Kapoor, Manoj Bajpayee and Amrita Rao. Rampal played the role of Arjun Singh, a social activist who joined a campaign to free his former college principal.

His next film &quot;Roy&quot; was initially scheduled to release in 2014 but it was delayed and ultimately released in 2015. He portrayed the main protagonist of the romantic thriller alongside Jacqueline Fernandez and Ranbir Kapoor. This was a critical and commercial failure. Critic Sarita A. Tanwar described it as a &quot;boring, exhausting and pretentious&quot; film.

In 2016, Rampal starred in the sequel to &quot;Rock On!!&quot;, &quot;Rock On!! 2&quot; alongside Farhan Akhtar, Shraddha Kapoor, Purab Kohli, in which he reprised the role of Joe Mascarenhas. It was a flop at box-office owing primarily to demonetisation but the camaraderie between the actors was appreciated in the film. His next release was &quot;Kahaani 2&quot;, in which he portrayed the role of a sub-inspector on the hunt of missing protagonist (portrayed by Vidya Balan). The film was an average grosser but his performance was appreciated.

His next venture was a biopic on gangster-turned-politician Arun Gawli called &quot;Daddy&quot; (2017) in which he portrayed Gawli and also produced the film. He reduced 10 kg weight and missed workout for nearly two years to portray the character. His role was critically praised and Rajeev Masand of &quot;News18&quot; wrote &quot;It&#x27;s a shrewd performance, relying almost entirely on body language over histrionics, and the actor doesn&#x27;t disappoint.&quot; He followed with the leading role in J. P. Dutta&#x27;s multi-starrer war film &quot;Paltan&quot; (2018), based on the real Nathu La and Cho La clashes between Indian and Chinese armies in 1967.

<text>Robert Forman Horton (18 September 1855 – 30 March 1934) was an English clergyman and writer. He was minister of Lyndhurst Road Congregational Church, Hampstead, a position he held for 50 years.

==Early life and education==

Horton born in London and was educated at Shrewsbury School and New College, Oxford, where he was awarded a First in classics. He was president of the Oxford Union in 1877. He became a fellow of his college in 1879 and lectured on history for four years. He was the first non-Anglican to have a teaching position at the Oxford University since the Reformation.

==Church role==
In 1880 Horton accepted an invitation to become minister of the Lyndhurst Road Congregational Church, Hampstead, and subsequently took a very prominent part in church and denominational work. This included establishing a mission hall for the Hampstead church in Kentish Town, known as Lyndhurst Hall.

Horton delivered the Lyman Beecher lectures at Yale University in 1893. In 1898 he was chairman of the London Congregational Union, and in 1903 he was chair of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. In 1909 he took a prominent part in the 75th anniversary celebration of Hartford Theological Seminary.

His numerous publications spanned theological, critical, historical, biographical and devotional subjects.

==Animal welfare==

Horton opposed blood sports and was an early vice-president of the League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports.

== Personal life ==

Author Mary Beaumont was lifelong friends with Horton. Beaumont and her husband lived with Horton from 1902 until Beaumont&#x27;s death in 1910. Horton married Violet Basden in 1918. Their daughter was born in 1928. Horton died in 1934, aged 78. There were 1500 mourners at his funeral held at Lyndhurst Road Congregational Church.

<doc id="957233" wikidata="Q155635" url="?curid=957233" title="Mil Mi-8">
<text>The Mil Mi-8 (, NATO reporting name: Hip) is a medium twin-turbine helicopter, originally designed by the Soviet Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) in the 1960s and introduced into the Soviet Air Force in 1968. Russian production of the aircraft model still continues as of 2024. In addition to its most common role as a transport helicopter, the Mi-8 is also used as an airborne command post, armed gunship, and reconnaissance platform.

The Mi-8 is the world&#x27;s most-produced helicopter, with over 17,000 units used by over 50 countries. As of 2015, when combined with the related Mil Mi-17, the two helicopters are the third most common operational military aircraft in the world.

==Design and development==

Mikhail Mil originally approached the Soviet government with a proposal to design an all-new two-engined turbine helicopter in 1959 after the success of the Mil Mi-4 and the emergence and effectiveness of turbines used in the Mil Mi-6. After design and development, the Mi-8 was subsequently introduced into the Soviet Air Force in 1967.

The Soviet military originally argued against a new helicopter, as they were content with the current Mil Mi-4. To counter this, Mikhail Mil proposed that the new helicopter was more of an update to new turbine engines rather than an entirely new helicopter, which persuaded the council of ministers to proceed with production. Due to the position of the engine, this enabled Mikhail Mil to justify redesigning the entire front half of the aircraft around the single engine.

The prototype, which was named V-8, was designed in 1958 and based on the Mil Mi-4 with a larger cabin. Powered by an AI-24 2,010 kW (2,700 shp) Soloviev turboshaft engine, the single engined V-8 prototype had its maiden flight in June 1961 and was first shown on Soviet Aviation Day parade (Tushino Air Parade) in July 1961.

During an official visit to the United States in September 1959, Nikita Khrushchev took a flight in the S-58 presidential helicopter for the first time and was reportedly extremely impressed. On Khrushchev&#x27;s return, he ordered the creation of a similar helicopter, which was to be ready for the return visit by the American president, to save face. A luxury version of the Mi-4 was quickly created and Khrushchev took an inspection flight, during which Mikhail Mil proposed that his helicopter in development was more suitable. However, it would be necessary to have a second engine for reliability.

This gave Mikhail Mil the power under the orders of Khrushchev to build the original two-engined helicopter, which for the first time in Soviet history would need purpose-built turbine engines, rather than those adapted from fixed wing aircraft (as in the Mil Mi-6 and the first prototype V-8) and an entirely new main rotor gear box that would be designed in-house for the first time. In May 1960, the order was given for Mikhail Mil to create his twin engine helicopter. The Sergei Isotov Design Bureau accepted the task of creating the engines.

The second prototype (still equipped with the one turbine engine as the Isotov engines were still under development) flew in September 1961.

Two months after the engines were completed by Isotov, the third prototype designated V-8A equipped with two 1,120 kW (1,500 shp) Isotov TV2 engines, made its first flight piloted by Nikolai Ilyushin on 2 August 1962, marking the first flight of any Soviet helicopter to fly with purpose built gas turbine engines. The aircraft completed its factory based testing in February 1963.

The fourth prototype was designed as a VIP transport, with the rotor changed from four blades to five blades in 1963 to reduce vibration, the cockpit doors replaced by blister perspex slides and a sliding door added to the cabin.

The fifth and final prototype was a mass production prototype for the passenger market. In November 1964, all joint testing had been completed and the Soviet government began mass production. Production started in the Kazan Production Plant, with the first aircraft completed by the end of 1965.
The Soviet military originally showed little interest in the Mi-8 until the Bell UH-1&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War became widely publicised as a great asset to the United States, allowing troops to move swiftly in and out of a battlefield and throughout the country. It was only then that the Soviet military rushed a troop-carrying variant of the Mil Mi-8 into production. By 1967, it had been introduced into the Soviet Air Force as the Mi-8.

There are numerous variants, including the Mi-8T, which, in addition to carrying 24 troops, is armed with rockets and anti-tank guided missiles. The Mil Mi-17 export version is employed by around 20 countries; its equivalent in Russian service in the &quot;Mi-8M&quot; series. The only visible differences between the Mi-8 and Mi-17 are A) the position of the tail rotor (Mi-8 right side, Mi-17 left side), B) the shape of the exhausts (Mi-8 circular, Mi-17 oval), and C) Dust shields in front of engine air intakes for the Mi-17. Also Mi-17 has some improved armour plating for its crew. The naval Mil Mi-14 version is also derived from the Mi-8.

The Mi-8 is constantly improving and the newest version still remains in production in 2024. However the second generation of the Mi-8 was changed to a tractor-tail rotor configuration as this configuration has increased yaw authority from the upwards advancing tail rotor blades into the downwash. The increase of the airspeed flowing over the rotor blades increases overall tail rotor effectiveness and yaw authority, whereas with the &#x27;Pusher&#x27; tail rotor configuration the advancing rotor blade moves downwards. This decreases the airspeed across the rotor blade, reducing its overall effective yaw authority. 

==Operational history==
===Finland===

The Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Border Guard began using Mi-8s in the 1970s, with the Finnish Air Force receiving its first, serialed HS-2, on 28 May 1973, and the second, HS-1, on 31 May 1973. Six Mi-8Ts were obtained at first, followed by further two Mi-8Ts and two Mi-8Ps. Three of the helicopters were handed over to the Border Guard Wing. One of these was lost after sinking through ice during a landing in April 1982. It was soon replaced by a new Mi-8.

After their Border Guard service, the helicopters were transferred to the civil register, but shortly thereafter to the Finnish Air Force. In 1997 it was decided that all helicopters, including the remaining five Mi-8Ts and two Mi-8Ps, should be transferred to the Army Wing at Utti. All Mi-8s have now been retired. One Mi-8 is on display at the Finnish Aviation Museum in Vantaa, and one is at the Päijänne Tavastia Aviation Museum in Asikkala, near Lahti. The two final Mi-8Ts were given to Hungary in August 2011 with all the remaining spare parts.

=== Georgia ===
The Georgian air force started operating Mi-8 and Mi-17 helicopters from 1991 onwards. During the War in Abkhazia (1992–1993) Mi-8 helicopters were used by both sides. Several were shot down, the first being a Georgian civilian Mi-8T which was destroyed in Sukhumi by an RPG-7. On 14 December 1992, a Russian Air Force Mi-8T was shot down by a SA-14 missile near Lata.

On another occasions Abkhaz Mi-8MTVs were shot down by Georgian forces, by SA-14 in one case and by RPG-18 in a second case, both during 1993. In the final case, Georgian Mi-8MTV carrying civilian refugees was shot down, killing 25 people. Georgian Air Force and Police currently operate about 20 Mi-8T/MTVs.

===Iraq===
Mi-8s were employed by the former Iraqi Army Aviation and Iraqi Air Force under Saddam Hussein. In the Iran–Iraq War of the 1980s, there were air-to-air combat between Iraqi and Iranian Army Aviation helicopters, including between Iranian Bell AH-1J Cobras and Iraqi Mi-8s.

===South Sudan===
On 21 December 2012, a Nizhnevartovskavia owned Mi-8 working for the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) was shot down and crashed near Likuangole in the South Sudanese state of Jonglei during the South Sudan internal conflict. All four Russian crewmembers on board were killed, and after some initial confusion, a UN spokesman said that the South Sudanese army confirmed on 22 December that it mistakenly fired at the helicopter.

On 26 August 2014, a UTair Aviation owned Mi-8 working for the United Nations crashed as it approached a landing airstrip near Bentiu. Three of the Russian crew members died and one was injured. Rebel commander Peter Gadet claimed that his forces brought it down using a rocket-propelled grenade.

===Soviet Union===
The Mi-8 family of helicopters became the main Soviet (and later Russian) helicopter, covering a large range of roles in both peace time and war time. Large fleets of Mi-8 and its derivatives were employed by both military and civil operators.

Large numbers of Mi-8 family helicopters were used during the Soviet–Afghan War during the 1980s. Its rugged construction allowed easier in-theater operations and maintenance. A large number of Mi-8s were lost with several shot down by enemy fire, with the Mi-8 and its derivatives being the main aircraft model lost by the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.

Between April and May 1986, Mi-8s were used in large numbers to drop radiation-absorbing materials into the No. 4 reactor of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant after the Chernobyl disaster, and the fire was extinguished by the combined effort of helicopters dropping over 5000 metric tons of sand, lead, clay, and neutron-absorbing boron onto the burning reactor and injecting liquid nitrogen into it. Most of the helicopters were severely irradiated and abandoned in a giant junkyard, the so-called &quot;machines cemetery&quot; near Chernobyl, with several disappearing from the site in later years. During the initial operation, one crashed near the power plant after hitting a construction crane cable with all the crew of four being killed in the crash. It is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core.

===Ukraine===

On 16 August 2013, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that one of its Mi-8MSB had set a world altitude record of at the Kirovske military airfield on 15 August.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces used Mi-8MSB along with Mi-24s in operations against separatists in Eastern Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War. On 29 May 2014, a Ukrainian National Guard Mi-8 was brought down by Russian separatist forces in Donbas using a MANPADS near Slavyansk with 12 personnel, including an Army general, killed and one seriously injured. On 24 June 2014, a Ukrainian National Guard Mi-8 was shot down by separatist forces again using a MANPADS near Slavyansk with nine personnel killed. Ukrainian forces used Mi-8 helicopters to resupply forces during the Siege of Mariupol at Azovstal iron and steel works and bring in additional reinforcements for the Azov Regiment. Some 16 Mi-8s were used a number of times, two of which were shot down. Russia claimed on 5 April that it shot down two Ukrainian Mi-8s that it said were being used to evacuate commanders of the Azov Regiment. In late August 2023, it was reported that a Russian defector named Maksym Kuzminov handed over a Mi-8AMTSh to the Ukrainian forces in coordination with Ukrainian Intelligence agents.

On 16 October 2023, Ukrainian Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi said that the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade had shot down a Mi-8 without supplying the location. According to the Oryx database 21 Mi-8 helicopters have been shot down by Ukraine thus far during the war.

On 31 July 2024, a Russian Mi-8 helicopter was shot down by over occupied Donetsk, by Ukrainian FPV drones. The first time a helicopter in combat was destroyed by a drone. The Mi-8 was believed to have been attacked on the ground either during landing or take off.

On 31 December 2024, a Russian Mi-8 was shot down by a MAGURA V5 sea drone armed with R-73 Sea Dragon missiles near Cape Tarkhankut, Crimea, while a second helicopter was damaged but managed to return to base, according to the Main Directorate of Intelligence.

===United States===

During the initial stages of Operation Enduring Freedom, Mi-17s and Mi-8s were extensively used by the CIA and US Special Forces to assist the Northern Alliance in their fight against the Taliban.

A number of Mi-8s and Mi-17s are used by US government agencies as of 2022.

===Yugoslavia===

The Yugoslav Air Force took delivery of 24 Mi-8T (Hip C) transport helicopters between May 1968 and May 1969 to equip two squadrons of the newly formed 119th transport regiment from Niš military airport, each squadron with 12 helicopters. Subsequently, from 1973 to the early 1980s, Yugoslavia purchased more Mi-8T helicopters to re-equip two squadrons of 111th regiment from Pleso military airport near Zagreb and the 790th squadron from Divulje military airport near Split, which was under the command of the Yugoslav Navy. In total, the Yugoslav Air Force received 92 Mi-8Ts, designated by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army as the &quot;HT-40&quot;, while local modification of several helicopters into electronic warfare variants produced the &quot;HT-40E&quot;. Some 40 helicopters were equipped for firefighting operations.

The Yugoslav Mi-8s&#x27; first combat operations were transport of Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army troops and federal police forces to border crossings in Slovenia on 27 June 1991 during the Ten-Day War. The members of Slovenian Territorial Defence fired Strela 2 MANPAD, and shot one helicopter down, killing all crew and passengers.

During combat in the winter of 1991 in the Croatian war and in the spring of 1992 in the Bosnian War, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army used the Mi-8 fleet for the evacuation of injured personnel, transport of cargo and search and rescue for the crews of aircraft forced down. As most flights were made behind the front, the Croatian forces were able to down just one helicopter, which was hit by small arms fire near Slavonski Brod on 4 October 1991.

After Bosnian Serbs declared their state in the spring of 1992, some former Yugoslav Air Force Mi-8s continued service with the Republika Srpska armed forces. The inventory of the 82nd mixed helicopter squadron, of the 92nd aviation brigade of the Army of Republika Srpska comprised 12 Mi-8T helicopters, which continued in service until Operation Koridor. During that period, the Republika Srpska Air Force lost three Mi-8 helicopters to enemy fire. Three helicopters painted in a blue and white colour scheme flew in the first part of 56th helicopter squadron of the Krajina Milicija, using Udbina military airport in Lika as their main base. The Republika Srpska Air Force continued to operate nine helicopters, albeit suffering problems with maintenance and spare parts, until it was formally disbanded in 2006.

On the other side, Mi-8 helicopters were also used as main air transport. The Croatian National Guard obtained its first on 23 September 1991, near Petrinja, when a Yugoslav Air Force Mi-8 made an emergency landing after being damaged by small-arms fire. A further 6 Mi-8T and 18 Mi-8MTV-1 helicopters were bought from ex-Warsaw Pact countries during the war, with 16 being used in active service, and remaining were used as source for spare parts. The remaining Mi-8Ts were retired from service in the Croatian Air Force after the war, while the Mi-8MTVs continued their service in 20th Transport Helicopter Squadron and 28th Transport Helicopter Squadron. The latter has been re-equipped with new Mi-171Sh helicopters bought from Russia.

The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina secretly obtained Mi-8T, Mi-8MTV and Mi-17 helicopters from various sources. Two helicopters were shot down by Serb air defenses, one around Žepa, while one Mi-17 was shot down by 2K12 Kub M, killing the Bosnian Foreign Affairs Minister Irfan Ljubijankić, a few other politicians, and the helicopter&#x27;s Ukrainian crew. A few Croatian Mi-8MTVs secretly supported Croatian Defence Council operations in Herceg Bosna. After the war, the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina operated the remaining five Mi-8MTVs and one Mi-8T in the Air Force and Air Defense Brigade of Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The North Macedonian Air Force bought two Mi-8MT helicopters in 2001 from Ukraine. They fly in the Transport Helicopter Squadron (ex 301. Transport Helicopter Squadron). One crashed, killing all 8 passengers and 3 crew members in an accident in January 2008.

During the Kosovo War of 1998 and 1999, the Federal Yugoslav Air Force used Mi-8s for transport of personnel and material to forces in otherwise-inaccessible mountain areas. Evacuation of injured personnel also occurred during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, flying at low altitude to avoid detection by NATO aircraft. In 1999, Yugoslav Mi-8s shot down at least one US Army Hunter UAV with the door gunner&#x27;s 7.62 mm machine gun. Two Mi-17V helicopters secretly operated by the Special Operations Unit post-1997 were also active during the Kosovar conflict. After the unit disbanded in 2003, the helicopters were transferred to Serbia and Montenegro&#x27;s air force.

As of mid-2020, the Serbian Air Force, the successor of the Federal Yugoslav Air Force, operates a small amount of Mi-8T which are now being replaced by Mi-17 helicopters. There are 13 Mi-17 in the Serbian air force currently. They are in the 138th Mixed-Transport-Aviation Squadron of 204th Air Base and 119th Combined-Arms Helicopter Squadron (ex 199th regiment) of 98th Air Base.

===Others===
* Canada – After Canada committed combat forces to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan, they realized their mobility depended on borrowed helicopter airlift. In 2007, the Minister of National Defence Peter MacKay announced the lease of 6 to 8 Mi-8s, particularly Kazan Helicopters Mi-17-V5s, until the introduction of 6 interim CH-47Ds in 2008 and later delivery of 15 new-build CH-47Fs in 2013 by the RCAF.
* Poland – On 4 December 2003, a Polish Mi-8 crashed near Piaseczno while carrying Prime Minister Leszek Miller, ten other passengers and four crewmen. There were no fatalities. The cause of the accident was the icing of the engines. The pilot was accused of causing the crash, but he was found not guilty.
* Syria – During the Yom Kippur War of October 1973, Syria landed special forces troops behind Israel Defense Forces lines on the Golan Heights at Mt. Hermon, Tel Fares, Vaset, Nafach and Ein Zivan – A Dalve.
* Yemen—On 19 November 2023, Houthi rebels utilized a captured Mi-17 helicopter to conduct an air assault boarding and seizure of the Japanese owned cargo ship Galaxy Leader.
* Vietnam- On 22 November 1992 a Vietnamese Mi-8 was sent from Hanoi carrying rescue workers for Flight 474, but it crashed near Ô Kha mountain on the same day. All seven people aboard were killed

<text>Lake Chambers Speed (born January 17, 1948) is an American retired stock car racing driver. He formerly competed in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, scoring one career win in 402 starts.

==Background==
Lake was named after the best friend of his father, Bob Lake. Lake&#x27;s father, Leland S. Speed, took office as the Mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, in 1948, the same year that Lake was born. He started his racing career at the age of thirteen racing karts, much to the displeasure of his family. Over the years, Speed won the International Karting Federation (IKF) National Championship six times and in 1978 he won the prestigious Karting World Championship over, among others, future three-time Formula One champion Ayrton Senna. Speed had been the only American to win the Karting World Championship until 2015 when 14 year-old Logan Sargeant of Florida won the KFJ World Karting Championship.

==NASCAR career==
===1980–1984===
In 1980 after considering racing in other series such as Formula One, CART, and IMSA, and getting advice from current Charlotte Motor Speedway promoter, Humpy Wheeler, Speed chose to go NASCAR racing. According to Speed, &quot;It was the highest mountain to climb.&quot; Speed&#x27;s relative unfamiliarity with the NASCAR scene led him to buy his first car from someone in Chicago. Speed started 19 races in his rookie year scoring an eighth at Darlington Speedway in his third career start. Speed also scored finishes of seventh at the spring Talladega Superspeedway race, eighth at Talladega&#x27;s fall event, seventh at Charlotte&#x27;s fall event and eighth at the season ending race at Ontario Motor Speedway. Speed finished 22nd in overall points and second to Jody Ridley in the rookie of the year standings.

In 1981, Speed again ran his own operation starting 27 of the 31 races on the schedule. Lake was unable to qualify for the 1981 Daytona 500, but did manage to win the 30-lap consolation race, leading the race from start to finish. He scored a ninth-place finish in both races at Rockingham and at Bristol. He followed that up with a seventh in Martinsville Speedway&#x27;s spring event, an eighth at the now-defunct Texas World Speedway and a sixth in the late summer Talladega event. Speed&#x27;s final top ten would come at Bristol in August where he finished seventh. The final points tally came up with Speed finishing 18th in points. One special footnote for Speed during the &#x27;81 season was that he enabled future NASCAR pace car driver Elmo Langley to start his 536th and final NASCAR race at Dover in the Mason-Dixon 500. Langley started 29th and finished 29th completing only six laps before a driveshaft failure.

1982 was Speed&#x27;s first full year of competition on the Winston Cup circuit. This time, Speed was driving for the first time for another car owner, Roger Hamby. The beginning of the season was a struggle with Speed not obtaining a top ten finish until the 11th race, at Dover International Speedway. In July at Daytona, Speed scored his second top ten finish with a ninth. Speed continued to struggle as the season wrapped up managing to finish sixth in the Southern 500 at Darlington and eighth at the fall event at the North Wilkesboro Speedway. Speed finished 20th in points.

1983 was a year of major change for Speed. He was now driving for an established owner in Hoss Ellington, however on a limited schedule. The team showed promise early in the season scoring a fourth at Rockingham and a sixth at Darlington. It was at Talladega where Speed&#x27;s life took a major change. Towards the race&#x27;s end, Speed was leading the field with a chance to win his first Cup race. He was beaten at the end by Richard Petty and Benny Parsons. After the race, Speed decided to change his life and become a devout Christian. The week after Talladega, Speed scored another top ten with a sixth in the World 600 at Charlotte. Speed&#x27;s final top ten of the season was the August Michigan International Speedway race with an eighth-place finish. Speed finished 27th in the points standings.

1984 was much the same. Starting 19 of the series&#x27; 30 races, Speed showed some early season strength with a third at Rockingham, a ninth at Atlanta and a sixth at Charlotte. At the first Pocono Raceway race, Speed qualified second and finished tenth following that up with a fifth at Michigan. Speed finished eighth in the late summer Talladega race and had a near win in the Southern 500 starting second and leading 28 laps before he crashed out. Speed&#x27;s final top ten was at Atlanta with a seventh-place finish and 26th in points.

Speed also started six races in the NASCAR Busch Series between 1983 and 1984. He only made one start in 1983, at Charlotte in the Miller Time 300, where he finished sixth. In 1984, Speed lost by two feet to Darrell Waltrip in the season opening Goody&#x27;s 300 at Daytona, and scored another top five in the Mello Yello 300 at Charlotte. Speed&#x27;s worst qualifying effort was a 13th place start in the season opener. Speed&#x27;s starts were fifth at Darlington, seventh at Charlotte, third at Darlington and ninth at Charlotte.

===1985–1989===
1985 was Speed&#x27;s breakout season in NASCAR. Running a full schedule under the RahMoc Racing banner, Speed started off the season with a second-place finish to Bill Elliott in the Daytona 500. CBS&#x27;s pit reporter Mike Joy conducted an interview with Speed after the race, during which the emotional driver repeatedly thanked God for the successful showing. He followed that up with a tenth at Richmond International Raceway and a fourth at Rockingham, taking the points lead early in the season. After an engine problem at Atlanta, Speed scored a string of strong runs: seventh at Bristol, ninth at Darlington, ninth at North Wilkesboro, eighth at Martinsville and tenth at Talladega. Speed then finished sixth in the World 600. The stretch run of the season took its toll on the team and Speed&#x27;s position in the points fell; however, he continued to post strong runs, finishing seventh at Talladega, tenth at Bristol, tenth at Dover and seventh and ninth-place finishes at Atlanta and Riverside International Raceway to round out the season. Overall, it was Speed&#x27;s best year in terms of points, notching a tenth-place finish.

Speed started off the 1986 season with a tenth in the Daytona 500 and a tenth at Rockingham but after the fourth race of the season, he was ousted from the ride. Speed started one more race that season, filling in for the ailing Rick Wilson in his Morgan-McClure Motorsports ride at Charlotte finishing fourteenth. Shortly thereafter, Speed began working again at starting his own race team.

1987 was a building year in many ways. With sponsorship from Wynn&#x27;s Car Care products, Kmart and Delco Battery, Speed built an entirely new race team with himself as the owner, and veteran crew chief Darrell Bryant helping him to build the operation. The purple and white Oldsmobile donned the number 83, in honor of the year Lake became a born-again Christian. In his thirteen starts Speed finished ninth in the first Talladega race and followed that up with a third-place finish in the World 600. Speed&#x27;s other two top ten finishes were at the same tracks, seventh place at both Talladega and Charlotte.

The team&#x27;s strong 1987 performances continued in 1988. With strong support from the Hoosier tire company, Speed ran strong in the Daytona 500 before dropping out due to an engine failure. The next race, at Richmond, Speed ran up front leading sixty-seven laps but finished sixth. The following race, at Rockingham, Speed again showed power, leading fifty-one laps and finishing second to Neil Bonnett. Speed&#x27;s first win came March 27 at Darlington in the TranSouth 500. After starting the race eighth, Speed methodically moved his way to the front before eventually taking the lead and running away from the field. Leading 178 of the 367 laps, Speed beat Alan Kulwicki by half a straightaway to secure his first and only NASCAR Winston Cup win. One of the factors in Speed&#x27;s victory was that he was the only driver who tested the Hoosier tires at Darlington. Where most of his competitors thought that the Hoosiers would blister, Lake and his team believed that they would not.
At Dover, Speed finished fourth, following that up with finishes of ninth at Daytona and fifth at Michigan. In the Volunteer 500, Speed led sixty-six laps and looked like a strong contender for the race win before blowing a right front tire and hitting the wall, effectively ending his day. Speed&#x27;s last top ten came at the 1988 Delaware 500 with a ninth-place effort. The season ended with Speed seventeenth place in the final points rundown.

Speed had strong finishes in 1989 with a Bull&#x27;s Eye Barbecue Sauce sponsorship Speed said was &quot;worth peanuts.&quot; At Rockingham Lake took eighth and a few weeks later he finished tenth Darlington. Speed finished fifth in the inaugural event at Sears Point (now Sonoma) Raceway and a seventh a few races later at Michigan. However, in the July race at Pocono, Speed was injured in a two-car wreck that also injured driver Greg Sacks. Although Sacks&#x27; car overturned, Speed was injured more severely, and missed several races. This crash was featured in a 1990 video titled &quot;Champions of the Checkered Flag&quot;. While Lake recovered from his injuries, he had several drivers drive in his place including Joe Ruttman at Talladega, Michigan and Bristol; Eddie Bierschwale at Watkins Glen; and Rodney Combs at Darlington. Lake returned to action in the Miller High Life 400 at Richmond to finish 14th. At the final race of the &#x27;89 season at Atlanta, Lake was able to conclude a personally disappointing year with a 10th-place run.

===1990–1994===
In 1990, Speed started only six races with Prestone sponsorship, finishing two of them. The best finish of Lake&#x27;s abbreviated 1990 season came at Talladega&#x27;s Die Hard 500 with an eleventh-place effort. Speed also fielded cars for short track ace Tommy Ellis and Phil Parsons in two races. Ellis started the Delaware 500 at Dover in 31st and finished 32nd after an engine failure. In the National 500 at Charlotte, Parsons drove Speed&#x27;s car with Baja Boats sponsorship to an 18th-place run. 1991 was an improvement in terms of races started. Speed replaced Dick Trickle in Cale Yarborough&#x27;s car but struggled with mechanical failures throughout his stint with the team. In twenty starts, Speed&#x27;s best finish was an eleventh at Bristol in August. In 1992, Speed got back to his own team starting just nine races with Purex as his sponsor. The team suffered several mechanical failures and Speed only managed to have a best finish of eighteenth in the final two races of the season at Phoenix and Atlanta.

After driving his own car during a handful of races in the 1993 season&#x27;s first half, Speed was called to drive for Robert Yates Racing, filling in following Davey Allison&#x27;s death. Speed qualified fourth at Watkins Glen International. He followed that up with a second place start at Michigan and a seventh-place finish. The next race at Bristol, Speed was running a strong race before contact late with Rick Mast ruined his chances at a top ten finish. After Bristol, Speed was replaced by Ernie Irvan, but less than a week later, on September 3, it was announced that Speed would drive the #15 Ford owned by Bud Moore for 1994, replacing Geoff Bodine, who would depart from Moore&#x27;s Ford to drive his own team which he purchased following Alan Kulwicki&#x27;s death. However, two races later at Dover, Speed replaced Bodine in Moore&#x27;s #15, as Ford allowed Bodine to take over Kulwicki&#x27;s former #7 for the last seven races of 1993, in preparation for his first full season as an owner-driver. Speed&#x27;s best finish for Moore at the end of the &#x27;93 season was an eleventh at Charlotte.

Speed remained with Moore for the 1994 season starting off with finishes of sixth at Atlanta, fifth at Darlington and third at Bristol, moving up to fifth place in the points. Two races later, Speed finished seventh at Talladega. It was during this time that Speed was inducted into the karting hall of fame. Speed would have to wait until the July Daytona race to get another top ten finish, a tenth. Speed and the team ran good through the summer stretch, often starting near the rear of the field but moving to the front. Unfortunately, Speed did not manage a top ten finish until Dover where he finished ninth. In the final four races, Speed had three great runs. A fifth at Charlotte, a tenth at Rockingham and a fourth at Atlanta where he led twenty laps. It wasn&#x27;t enough for Speed to finish in the top ten in points. He finished eleventh behind Bill Elliott.

===1995–1998===
Speed moved over to Melling Racing team for the 1995 season and resurrected the organization. The normally red and white Melling car now was emblazoned with Spam sponsorship and blue and yellow colors. Speed had two top ten runs, at Charlotte in the Coca-Cola 600 and at Darlington in the Southern 500 to finish twenty-third in the points rundown. However, the 1995 season provided Speed with what is perhaps his most famous moment. After the Miller Genuine Draft 400, Michael Waltrip blocked Speed&#x27;s car in the pits. Waltrip, angry with Speed for blocking him on the track, pulled down Speed&#x27;s window net and began throwing punches at Speed, who was wearing his helmet. The incident was broadcast in front of a live television audience on the CBS network and resulted in a $10,000 fine for Waltrip.

During the 1996 season, Speed earned his first career NASCAR pole, albeit in a non-points event, the Winston Open. At the Miller 400 at Michigan, the normally blue and yellow Spam Ford was graced in red, white and gold in honor of 50 years of Melling&#x27;s parts company being in operation. Speed and the Melling Racing team notched an eighth place finish at Pocono in the Miller 500. Speed stunned everyone in qualifying for the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis with a third-place effort. During the race, Speed made a daring three-wide pass to take the lead. The finishing order saw Speed finish 13th after leading two laps. At the second race in Michigan, the GM Goodwrench Dealer 400, Speed led seven laps and looked poised to possibly capture his second NASCAR Winston Cup victory before getting caught up in a wreck started by Sterling Marlin. Though Speed qualified poorly for the Southern 500, he quickly moved his way through the field. Just as he neared running in the top ten, a right front tire cut and Lake had to pit under the green flag, losing two laps. However, the strength of the car would prove itself as Speed worked his way back to finish 10th, the final top ten finish of his career.

After the University of Nebraska backed out of their sponsorship, Speed and Melling ran a limited 1997 season. Speed qualified for all 25 races he attempted. Lake and the team raced to a solid 12th-place finish in the Pontiac Excitement 400 at Richmond, then followed that up with a sixth-place qualifying effort at Atlanta. During the midpoint of the season, the No. 9 car was filmed for the TV movie &quot;Steel Chariots&quot;. In the Miller 400 at Michigan, Speed earned his and the team&#x27;s best finish of the season, an 11th. A few races later, Speed finished 12th in the Brickyard 400. At Richmond in the Exide NASCAR Select Batteries 400, Speed seemed to have one of the stronger cars, leading three laps through a series of green flag pit stops. However, during the stop, the crew bolted the left side tires on the right side and the right side tires on the left, forcing Speed to make multiple pit stops and dropping him out of a chance of having a good finish. A few races later, Lake had a 14th-place run at Martinsville in the Hanes 500. The Melling team was able to get sponsorship for the last four races of the season from Advantage Camo, their best finish being 17th at Rockingham&#x27;s AC Delco 400. Speed finished 35th in the points standings.

1998 was Speed&#x27;s final Winston Cup season. Having secured sponsorship from the Cartoon Network, Speed&#x27;s best finish of the season was in the Daytona 500 where he tangled with John Andretti with two laps to go bringing out the yellow flag that effectively won the race for Dale Earnhardt. The 1998 season proved to be a challenge for Lake and the Melling Racing team. It appeared as if the team was struggling with the new Ford Taurus bodies, and that translated to some poor results. At Sears Point Raceway, Speed appeared to have a chance to turn his season around. He was strong during the first practice session with the second fastest speed behind Jeff Gordon. In the second practice session, Speed ran over debris thrown on the track by a car that had gotten off course, cut a tire and slammed into one of the tire barriers breaking his sternum. Speed missed the event and was replaced by Butch Gilliland, but he returned to the next race at New Hampshire. However Speed was caught up in a wreck not of his own making and aggravated his injury. After the race, Speed felt it best for the team to find another driver. Speed stepped aside and was replaced by Jerry Nadeau. With Speed&#x27;s age being against him and a push for younger drivers, he effectively retired from NASCAR racing. Though Speed only made 16 starts during the 1998 season, he still finished 43rd in the points standings.

== After retirement ==

In 2006, the International Kart Federation established the Lake Speed Achievement of Excellence karting award in honor of the 1978 World Karting Champion. The award was presented for the first time at the IKF 2-Cycle Sprint Grand Nationals August 3–6 at Fontana, California. The inaugural recipient was Matt Johnson of Las Vegas, Nevada. Nick Johnston of Northridge, California was awarded the honor in 2007. The award went to Taylor Miinch in 2008 and Mike Botelho Jr. in 2009. And youngest winner of the award went to Ryan Schartau of Chino, California in 2013. The recipient of the award could be a driver, team, kart shop or any combination thereof, and the winner is determined primarily on sportsmanship, driving achievement and professionalism during the race event.

On occasion, Speed still drives karts, and has four wins in Historic Stock Car Racing Association events on Daytona&#x27;s 3.56-mile road course in 2002 and 2003 driving one of his old 83 Purex-sponsored Ford vehicles.

Speed currently races in the World Karting Association&#x27;s National Road Racing Series schedule, in the Spec 125 TaG 1 and 2 classes. On July 30, 2010 Speed was inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame. Since 2016, he has been an avid follower of the RHPK kart series. In November 2023, he went to Virginia International Raceway and raced his 1993 stock car at the age of 75.

<text>Samuel Dana Horton (January 16, 1844 – February 23, 1895), American writer on bimetallism, was born in Pomeroy, Ohio.

He graduated at Harvard in 1864, and at the Harvard Law School in 1868, studied Roman law in Berlin in 1869, and in 1871 was admitted to the Ohio bar. He practised law in Cincinnati, and then in Pomeroy until 1885, when he gave up law for the advancement of bimetallism.

His attention had been turned to monetary questions by the greenback campaign of 1873 in Ohio, in which, as in former campaigns, he had spoken, particularly effectively in German, for the Republican party. He was secretary of the American delegation to the Monetary Conference which met in Paris in 1878, and edited the report of the delegation.

To the conference of 1881 he was a delegate, and thereafter he spent much of his time in Europe, whither he was sent by President Harrison in 1889 as special commissioner to promote the international restoration of silver. He died in Washington, DC.

Horton&#x27;s principal works were &quot;The Silver Pound&quot; (1887) and &quot;Silver in Europe&quot; (1890), a volume of essays.

In 1877 he married Blanche Harriott Lydiard (1850–1898). They had one son Lydiard Horton (1879–1945).

<text>William Horsley (18 November 177412 June 1858) was an English composer, organist and teacher.

==Career==
In 1790, Horsley became the pupil of the pianist and composer Theodore Smith (c. 1740-1810), who taught him sufficiently well to obtain the position of organist at Ely Chapel, Holborn, in 1794. He resigned this post in 1798 to become the organist at the Asylum for Female Orphans as well as the assistant to John Wall Callcott, with whom he had long been on terms of personal and artistic intimacy, and whose eldest daughter, Elizabeth Hutchins Callcott, he married. Callcott encouraged his interest in vocal music. In 1802 he became his friend&#x27;s successor upon the latter&#x27;s resignation. Besides holding this appointment he became the organist of Belgrave Chapel, Halkin Street, in 1812 and of the Charter House in 1838.

Horsley spent time studying in Germany, where he met Moritz Hauptmann and Robert Schumann, and he first met Felix Mendelssohn on his visit to London in 1829 and remained friends with him. Horsley was one of the founders of the Philharmonic Society of London, which became the Royal Philharmonic Society.

==Music==
His compositions were numerous, and include amongst other instrumental pieces three symphonies for full orchestra (now lost). There are five surviving piano sonatas, composed between 1812–17, of which Nicholas Temperley and Leanne Langley particularly highlight No. 2 of 1814. More important are his glees, of which he published five books (1801–1807) besides contributing many detached glees and part songs to various collections. His glees include &quot;By Celia&#x27;s Arbour,&quot; &quot;O, Nightingale,&quot; and &quot;Now the storm begins to lower&quot;.. His ballads, particularly &quot;Gentle Lyre&quot; and &quot;The Sailor’s Adieu&quot; enjoyed popularity in his lifetime. Two of his hymn tunes, ‘Belgrave’ (1819) and ‘Horsley’ (1844), the latter (usually set to There is a green hill far away), are still in use today.

==Family==
The Horsley family were friendly with Mendelssohn and, according to L T C Rolt, were the first to hear his music for &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, played by him on the piano at their home at No 1 High Row (now 128 Church Street) in Kensington. In 1833, while on a visit to London, Mendelssohn &quot;enjoyed flirting with two of Horsley&#x27;s daughters, Fanny and Sophie&quot;. Their letters from that period are full of references to him, and were published in 1934. Fanny was an artist who died young, Sophie an accomplished pianist. Horsley&#x27;s eldest daughter Mary Elizabeth (born 1813) married the engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. His son Charles Edward also enjoyed a certain reputation as a musician. Another son John Callcott was a painter, who is reputed to have designed the first Christmas card in 1843.

<text>Dave Barham (June 13, 1913 – March 25, 1991) was an American business entrepreneur who founded the fast-food chain, Hot Dog on a Stick. Barham is also credited with being the originator of the stick in the corn dog.

==Early years==
Born in Bell City, Missouri, Barham lived his youth on a farm. He traveled frequently to nearby mid-western cities such as St. Louis and Chicago. In these two large cities, he was exposed to big city atmosphere. Barham&#x27;s favorite snacks were the corn dogs. He figured out that, while other foods such as hamburgers and ice creams had chain restaurants, corn dogs did not.

==Hot Dog on a Stick==
He set on an enterprise to create a hot dog restaurant. Soon after, the first Hot Dog on a Stick was opened in 1946 by Muscle Beach in Santa Monica, California.

The first restaurant ever in a mall was a Hot Dog on a Stick franchise in Murray, Utah. Barham was able to convince the mall owner in 1972 to rent him the space for the restaurant.

The restaurant flourished and had franchises across the United States. By the 1980s, Barham was a common guest speakers at businessmen meetings.

The restaurant chain he created is now arguably more famous for their lemonades. Employees wear bright red and yellow uniforms, and can sometimes be spotted mashing lemons by hand to make the restaurant&#x27;s lemonade.

Barham died in 1991 from cancer and left the Hot Dog on a Stick franchise to his employees, making it the nation&#x27;s only 100 percent employee owned and operated fast food restaurant chain.

<text>John Callcott Horsley (29 January 1817 – 18 October 1903) was a British academic painter of genre and historical scenes, illustrator, and designer of the first Christmas card. He was a member of the artist&#x27;s colony in Cranbrook.

==Childhood and education==
Horsley was born in London, the son of William Horsley, the musician, and grand-nephew of Sir Augustus Callcott. His sister Mary Elizabeth Horsley wed the famous British engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1836. Horsley was mentored by William Mulready and Augustus Wall Callcot who sent him at age thirteen to study at Dr Henry Sass&#x27;s academy where he met D.G Rossetti, J. Millais and W.P. Frith; in his biography Horsley recalls Dr Sass as being vain and untalented. Following preparatory school Horsley studied painting at the Royal Academy schools where he met Thomas Webster. In 1836 he exhibited &quot;The Pride of the Village&quot; (Vernon Gallery) at the Royal Academy.

==Family life==
Horsley married Elvira Walter in 1846 with whom he had three sons: Edward (1848), Frank (1849), and Harry (1850). Elvira died of consumption in 1852 followed by the deaths of Edward and Harry in 1854 and Frank in 1857 due to scarlet fever.

Horsley remarried, to Rosamund Haden, who came from a family of distinguished surgeons—her father Charles Haden had a practice in Sloan Street and her brother Francis Seymour Haden was a surgeon and etcher, who founded the Royal Society of Painters, Etchers and Engravers in 1880. Rosamund gave birth to Walter Charles (1855–1934), Hugh (1856), Victor (1857-1916), Emma (1858), Fanny (1859-1949), Gerald (1862) and Rosamund Brunel (1864-1949). Gerald grew up to be an architect, Walter an artist also studying at the RA Schools. Sir Victor Horsley became famous as a surgeon and neuropathologist, and a prominent supporter of the cause of experimental research. Fanny (Frances) became Lady Whitelegge. Hugh and Emma died of scarlet fever.

After his wedding to Rosamund in 1854 Horsley and his new wife toured the Midlands for five months to establish contacts with wealthy industrialists for portrait commissions. Horsley moved into &#x27;Willesley&#x27;, his house in Cranbrook in 1861, joining the Cranbrook Colony; while maintaining a home in London. The architect Richard Shaw adds &quot;...tall chimneys and cosy &#x27;inglenooks.&#x27;&quot; in the Jacobean style to &#x27;Willesley&#x27;.

==Career==

Horsley&#x27;s paintings were largely of historical subjects set in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, influenced by the Dutch masters Pieter de Hooch and Vermeer. Examples are &quot;Malvolio&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Allegro and il Penseroso&quot; (painted for the Prince Consort), &quot;Le Jour des Morts&quot; and &quot;A Scene from Don Quixote&quot;.

As a young artist Horsley was patronised by the collector John Sheepshanks, who bought two of Horsley&#x27;s paintings: &quot;The Rival Performers&quot; (1839) and &quot;Youth and Age&quot; (1839), both of which are now part of the V&amp;A collection. Callcott Horsley exhibited a second painting entitled &#x27;Youth and Age&#x27; at the Royal Academy in 1851.

In 1843 his cartoon (preliminary drawing) of &quot;St Augustine Preaching&quot; won a prize in the competition to provide interior decorations for Palace of Westminster. This led to his being selected in 1844 as one of the six painters commissioned to execute frescoes there. He painted &quot;Religion&quot; (1847) in the House of Lords, and &quot;Satan touched by Ithuriel&#x27;s Spear while whispering evil dreams to Eve &quot; (1848). He also produced three of the four full-page plates illustrating the Main Sacraments for the 1845 illuminated &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; designed by Owen Jones. In 1864 he became a Royal Academician (RA). Horsley had much to do with organizing the winter exhibitions of &quot;Old Masters&quot; at Burlington House after 1870.

Horsley was rector and treasurer of the Royal Academy from 1875 to 1890 and 1882 to 1897 respectively. He earned the nickname &#x27;Clothes-Horsley&#x27; for his opposition to the use of nude life models. When, during the 1880s, the example of the French Salon began to affect the Academy exhibitors, and paintings of the nude became the fashion, he protested against the innovation, and his attitude caused &quot;Punch&quot; to give him the sobriquet of &quot;Mr J. C(lothes) Horsley&quot; (a pun on clothes horse).

He resigned from the academy in 1897, and became a &quot;retired Academician&quot;.
In 1843 Horsley designed the first ever Christmas card, commissioned by Henry Cole. It caused some controversy because it depicted a small child drinking wine. He also designed the Horsley envelope, a pre-paid envelope that was the precursor to the postage stamp.

In 1856 Horsley was photographed at &quot;The Photographed Institute&quot; by Robert Howlett, as part of a series of portraits of &quot;fine artists&quot;. The picture was among a group exhibited at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857.

Horsley was a member of the London-based Etching Club contributing illustrations to editions of &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; (Oliver Goldsmith) and &quot;Songs of Shakespeare&quot;. He also illustrated a number of other books including &quot;Little Princes&quot; by Eliza Slater (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1890).

<text>Gloydius is a genus of pit vipers endemic to Asia, also known as Asian moccasins or Asian ground pit vipers. Named after American herpetologist Howard K. Gloyd, this genus is very similar to the North American genus &quot;Agkistrodon&quot;. 24 species are currently recognized.

==Geographic range==
Species of &quot;Gloydius&quot; are found in Russia, east of the Ural Mountains through Siberia, Iran, Himalayas from Pakistan, India, Nepal, China, Korea, Japan and the Ryukyu Islands.

==Species==

(*) Not including the nominate subspecies.&lt;br&gt;
(T) Type species.

In the above list, a taxon author in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a different genus.

==Taxonomy==
Due to the strong morphological similarity, these snakes were classified in the genus &quot;Agkistrodon&quot; until very recently. However, by 1999 cladistic studies clearly showed that &quot;Agkistrodon&quot; did not form a clade (indeed, it was not even paraphyletic) and was thus split into several genera.

A new species, &quot;G. tsushimaensis&quot;, was described by Isogawa, Moriya &amp; Mitsui (1994). It is referred to as the Tsushima island pitviper and is found only on Tsushima Island, Japan.

<text>Sir Augustus Wall Callcott (20 February 177925 November 1844) was an English landscape painter.

==Life and work==
Callcott was born at Kensington Gravel Pits, a village on the western edge of London, in the area now known as Notting Hill Gate. His first study was music and he sang for several years in the choir of Westminster Abbey. But at the age of twenty he had determined to give up music, became a student of the Royal Academy, and began his artistic career as a painter of portraits under the tuition of John Hoppner. The first picture he exhibited was a portrait of &quot;Miss Roberts&quot;, and its success at the Royal Academy in 1799 is said to have led to his final choice of painting as a profession.

His preference for landscape, including river and coast scenery, soon showed itself, and after 1804 he exhibited nothing but landscapes for many years. The skill of his execution, the elegance of his design, and the charming tone of his works caused his reputation to rise steadily. In 1806 he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, and in 1810 a full Academician. The care which he bestowed upon his pictures restricted their number. From 1805 to 1810 he exhibited about four pictures a year, in 1811 ten pictures, and in 1812, six. From that year to 1822 he exhibited only seven works in all, but among these were some of his best and largest, such as &quot;The Entrance to the Pool of London&quot; (1816), &quot;The Mouth of the Tyne&quot; (1818), and &quot;A Dead Calm on the Medway&quot; (1820). Another important picture was &quot;Rochester&quot; (1824).

Though his subjects down to this time were generally taken from the scenery of his own country, he had visited France and the Netherlands and had painted some Dutch and Flemish scenes before 1827, the year he married and went to Italy for the first time. His wife, Maria Graham, the widow of Captain Graham, R.N., had already attained considerable literary reputation. On their return from Italy they took up their residence at Kensington Gravel Pits, where he lived until his death, enjoying great popularity. In 1830 he began to exhibit Italian compositions, and after this year the subjects of his pictures were generally foreign. Though to the last his works were marked by charm of composition and sweetness of execution, those produced before 1827 are now held in most esteem.

On the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837, Callcott received the honour of knighthood. In that year he departed from his usual class of subjects, and exhibited a picture of &quot;Raffaelle and the Fornarina&quot;, with life-size figures, 
finished with great care, which was engraved by Lumb Stocks for the Art Union of London in 1843. This and &quot;Milton dictating to his Daughters&quot;, exhibited in 1840, were the most important of his figure paintings, of which rare class of his work the South Kensington Museum (Sheepshanks Collection) (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) contains two specimens, &quot;Anne Page and Slender&quot; and &quot;Falstaff and Simple&quot;. The museum also possesses several landscapes in oil and sketches in watercolour, etc.

The figures in his landscapes were often important parts of the composition, and were always gracefully designed 
and happily placed, as, for instance, in &quot;Dutch Peasants returning from Market&quot;.

In 1843 Callcott succeeded William Seguier as Surveyor of the Queen&#x27;s Pictures. He died on 25 November 1844 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.

There are qualities in Callcott&#x27;s work which gained the admiration of J. M. W. Turner and Thomas Stothard in his day. He was generous in his patronage of younger artists.

==Family==

His wife, Maria, was a writer on art and travel. His brother, John Wall Callcott, was a noted composer.

<text>Maria Graham, Lady Callcott (née Dundas; 19 July 1785 – 21 November 1842), was a British writer of travel books and children&#x27;s books, and also an accomplished illustrator.

==Early life==
She was born near Cockermouth in Cumberland as Maria Dundas. Educated in Richmond, she spent time in the vacation with her uncle Sir David Dundas, who hosted many scientists and academics, which inspired her as a writer. She did not see much of her father during her childhood and teenage years, as he was one of the many naval officers that the Scottish Dundas clan has raised through the years. George Dundas (1756–1814) (not to be confused with the much more famous naval officer George Heneage Lawrence Dundas) was made post-captain in 1795 and saw plenty of action as commander of HMS &quot;Juno&quot;, a fifth-rate 32-gun frigate, between 1798 and 1802. In 1803 he was given the command of , a 74-gun third-rate that had been Nelson&#x27;s flagship during the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801, and took her down to Jamaica to patrol the Caribbean waters until 1806.

In 1808 his sea-fighting years were over, and he took an appointment as head of the naval works at the British East India Company&#x27;s dockyard in Bombay. When he went out to India he brought his now 23-year-old daughter along. During the long trip Maria Dundas fell in love with a young Scottish naval officer aboard, Thomas Graham, third son to Robert Graham, the last Laird of Fintry. They married in India on 9 December 1809. In 1811, the young couple returned to England, where Graham published her first book, &quot;Journal of a Residence in India&quot;, followed soon afterwards by &quot;Letters on India&quot;. A few years later her father was appointed commissioner of the naval dockyard in Cape Town, where he died in 1814, aged 58, having been promoted rear-admiral just two months earlier.

==Widow in Chile==
As all other naval officers&#x27; wives, Graham spent several years ashore, seldom seeing her husband. Most of these years she lived in London. But while other officers&#x27; wives spent their time with domestic chores, she worked as a translator and book editor. In 1819 she lived in Italy for a time, which resulted in the book &quot;Three Months Passed in the Mountains East of Rome, during the Year 1819&quot;. Being very interested in the arts, she also wrote a book about the French baroque painter Nicolas Poussin, &quot;Memoirs of the Life of Nicholas Poussin&quot; (French first names were usually Anglicised in those days), in 1820.

In 1821, Graham was invited to accompany her husband aboard , a 36-gun frigate under his command. The destination was Chile, and the purpose was to protect British mercantile interests in the area. In April 1822, shortly after the ship had rounded Cape Horn, her husband died of a fever, so HMS &quot;Doris&quot; arrived in Valparaiso without a captain, but rather a captain&#x27;s widow. All the naval officers stationed in Valparaiso – British, Chilean and American – tried to help Maria (one American captain even offered to sail her back to Britain), but she was determined to manage on her own. She rented a small cottage, turned her back on the English colony (&quot;I say nothing of the English here, because I do not know them except as very civil vulgar people, with one or two exceptions&quot;, she later wrote), and lived among the Chileans for a whole year. Later in 1822, she experienced the Valparaíso earthquake; one of the worst in Chile&#x27;s history, and recorded its effects in detail. In her journal she recorded that after the earthquake &quot;...the whole shore is more exposed and the rocks are about four feet higher out of the water than before.&quot; This idea that the land could be lifted proved controversial, but correct. An extract of Maria&#x27;s letter to Henry Warburton giving an account of the earthquake was published in 1824 in the Transactions of the Geological Society of London. This was the first paper published in this journal by a woman.

==Tutor to the princess==
In 1823, she began her journey back to Britain. She made a stop in Brazil and was introduced to the newly appointed Brazilian emperor and his family. The year before, the Brazilians had declared independence from Portugal and had asked the resident Portuguese crown prince to become their emperor. It was agreed that Graham should become the tutor of the young Princess Maria da Gloria, so when she reached London, she just handed over the manuscripts of her two new books to her publisher (&quot;Journal of a Residence in Chile during the Year 1822. And a Voyage from Chile to Brazil in 1823&quot; and &quot;Journal of a Voyage to Brazil, and Residence There, During Part of the Years 1821, 1822, 1823&quot;, illustrated by herself), collected suitable educational material, and returned to Brazil in 1824. She stayed in the royal palace only until October of that year, when she was asked to leave due to courtiers&#x27; suspicion of her motives and methods (courtiers seem to have feared, with some justice, that she intended to Anglicize the princess). During her few months with the royal family, she developed a close friendship with the empress, Maria Leopoldina of Austria, who passionately shared her interests in the natural sciences. After leaving the palace, Graham experienced further difficulties in arranging for her transport home; unwillingly, she remained in Brazil until 1825, when she finally managed to arrange a passport and passage to England. Her treatment by palace courtiers left her with ambivalent feelings about Brazil and its government; she later recorded her version of events in her unpublished manuscript &quot;Memoir of the Life of Don Pedro&quot;.

In March 1826, King John VI of Portugal died. His son Pedro inherited the throne, but preferred to remain Emperor of Brazil and thus abdicated the Portuguese throne in favour of his six-year-old daughter within two months.

==Book about HMS &quot;Blonde&quot;&#x27;s famous journey==
After her return from Brazil in 1825, her publisher John Murray asked her to write a book about the famous and recently completed voyage of HMS &quot;Blonde&quot; to the Sandwich Islands (as Hawaii was then known). King Kamehameha II and Queen Kamamalu of Hawaii had been on a visit to London in 1824 when they both died of the measles, against which they had no immunity. HMS &quot;Blonde&quot; was commissioned by the British Government to return their bodies to the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i, with George Anson Byron in command, a cousin of poet Byron. The resulting book &quot;Voyage of the H.M.S. Blonde to the Sandwich Islands, In The Years 1824–1825&quot; contained a history of the royal couple&#x27;s unfortunate visit to London, a résumé of the discovery of the Hawaiian Islands and visits by British explorers, as well as the story about &quot;Blonde&quot;&#x27;s journey. Her book remains a primary source for the voyage and includes an account of the funeral ceremony for the monarchs of the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i. Graham wrote it with the help of official papers and journals kept by the ship&#x27;s chaplain R. Rowland Bloxam; there is also a short section based on the records of naturalist Andrew Bloxam.

==Second marriage==
When she arrived in London, Graham had taken rooms in Kensington Gravel Pits, just south of Notting Hill Gate, which was something of an artists&#x27; enclave, where Royal Academy painter Augustus Wall Callcott and his musician brother John Wall Callcott lived, among with painters like John Linnell, David Wilkie and William Mulready, and musicians including William Crotch (the first principal of the Royal Academy of Music) and William Horsley (John Callcott&#x27;s son-in-law). In addition, this close-knit group was frequently visited by artists like John Varley, Edwin Landseer, John Constable and J. M. W. Turner.

Graham&#x27;s lodgings very quickly became a focal point for London&#x27;s intellectuals, such as the Scottish poet Thomas Campbell, Graham&#x27;s book publisher John Murray and the historian Francis Palgrave, but her keen interest and knowledge of painting (she was a skilled illustrator of her own books, and had written the book about Poussin) made it inevitable that she would quickly become part of the artists&#x27; enclave, as well.

Graham and Callcott married on his 48th birthday, 20 February 1827. In May of that year, the Callcotts embarked upon a year-long honeymoon to Italy, Germany and Austria, where they studied the art and architecture of those countries exhaustively and met many of the leading art critics, writers and connoisseurs of the time.

==Disability==

In 1831, Maria Callcott ruptured a blood vessel and became physically disabled. 

She could no longer travel, but she could continue to entertain her friends, and could continue her writing.

In 1828, immediately after returning from their honeymoon, she had published &quot;A Short History of Spain&quot;, and in 1835 the writings during her long convalescence resulted in the publication of two books; &quot;Description of the chapel of the Annunziata dell’Arena; or Giotto’s Chapel in Padua&quot;, and her first and most famous book for children, &quot;Little Arthur’s History of England&quot;, which has been reprinted numerous times since then (already in 1851 the 16th edition was published, and it was last reprinted in 1981). &quot;Little Arthur&quot; was followed in 1836 by a French version; &quot;Histoire de France du petit Louis&quot;.

==Geological debate==
In the mid-1830s her description of the earthquake in Chile of 1822 started a heated debate in the Geological Society, where she was caught in the middle of a fight between two rivalling schools of thought regarding earthquakes and their role in mountain building. Besides describing the earthquake in her &quot;Journal of a Residence in Chile&quot;, she had also written about it in more detail in a letter to Henry Warburton, who was one of the Geological Society&#x27;s founding fathers. As this was one of the first detailed eyewitness accounts by &quot;a learned person&quot; of an earthquake, he found it interesting enough to publish in &quot;Transactions of the Geological Society of London&quot; in 1823.

One of her observations had been that of large areas of land rising from the sea, and in 1830 that observation was included in the groundbreaking work &quot;The Principles of Geology&quot; by the geologist Charles Lyell, as evidence in support of his theory that mountains were formed by volcanoes and earthquakes. Four years later the president of the Society, George Bellas Greenough, decided to attack Lyell&#x27;s theories. But instead of attacking Lyell directly, he did it by publicly ridiculing Maria Callcott&#x27;s observations.

Maria Callcott, however, was not someone who accepted ridicule. Her husband and her brother offered to duel Greenough, but she said, according to her nephew John Callcott Horsley, &quot;Be quiet, both of you, I am quite capable of fighting my own battles, and intend to do it&quot;. She went on to publish a crushing reply to Greenough, and was shortly thereafter backed by none other than Charles Darwin, who had observed the same land rising during Chile&#x27;s earthquake in 1835, aboard the &quot;Beagle&quot;.

In 1837 Augustus Callcott was knighted and his wife became known as Lady Callcott. Shortly afterwards her health began to deteriorate, and in 1842 she died aged 57. She continued to write until the very end, and her last book was &quot;A Scripture Herbal&quot;, an illustrated collection of tidbits and anecdotes about plants and trees mentioned in the Bible, which was published the same year she died.

Augustus Callcott died two years later, at the age of 65, having been made Surveyor of the Queen&#x27;s Pictures in 1843.

==Honoured in 2008==

In recognition of her services to Chile, as being one of the first persons to write about the young nation in the English language, the Chilean government paid for the restoration of Maria and Augustus Callcott&#x27;s joint grave in Kensal Green Cemetery in London in 2008.

The restoration was finalised with a commemorative plaque, unveiled by the Chilean ambassador to the United Kingdom, Rafael Moreno, at a ceremony on 4 September 2008. The plaque names Maria Callcott &quot;a friend of the nation of Chile&quot;.

<doc id="957268" wikidata="Q1972596" url="?curid=957268" title="Ali Taziev">
<text>Ali Musaevich Taziev (, ), also known as Akhmed Yevloev (; ), Magomet Yevloyev, and Emir Magas; born 19 August 1974) is the former leader of both the Ingushetia-based Ingush Jamaat and as the military wing of the Caucasus Emirate. On 30 September 2006, Taziev was appointed to the post of commander of the Caucasian Front by the orders of Dokka Umarov. In July 2007, one year after Shamil Basayev’s death, Taziev became his official successor as the most high-ranking military commander in the rebel forces. He is believed to be personally responsible for the death of several local high-ranking security officials.

== Biography ==
Taziev is an ethnic Ingush who was raised in Grozny, Chechnya. He participated in the First Chechen War. After the conclusion of the First Chechen War he returned to Ingushetia and entered the police. There he was promoted to the Ingush Interior Ministry Police forces, where he attained the rank of captain. At the start of the Second Chechen War, he returned to Chechnya and became a sub-commander under Shamil Basayev before Basayev assigned him to use his family and clan ties to begin raising armed groups in Ingushetia. In this position, he was among the commanders of the 2004 Nazran raid in which simultaneous nationwide raids on police stations killed over 70 security personnel in the capital Nazran; according to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), during the attack Taziev personally killed the acting Ingush Interior Minister Abubakar Kostoyev.

Taziev was listed by Russia as one of the dead terrorists of the 2004 Beslan hostage crisis, the person who led the negotiations on behalf of the hostage takers under the name Ali Taziyev and whose body was identified after he was killed during the storming of the school. Those reports were proved incorrect two years later, when Taziev was declared wanted by Russia for the assassination of the Ingush deputy Interior Minister Dzhabrail Kostoyev in May 2006. Although the negotiator of the siege known as Ali had similar features as Taziev, his facial profile was much different. According to FSB information, Ali Taziyev was an Ingush Interior Ministry policeman who disappeared without a trace in 1998 and was declared legally dead in 2000, but instead might have joined forces of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (ChRI).

After the death of Ilyas Gorchkhanov during the 2005 Nalchik raid, Taziev was the next in line to assume leadership of the Ingush Jamaat. In 2006, he was incorrectly reported as being killed by the FSB operation that allegedly killed Shamil Basayev. A month after Basayev&#x27;s death Taziev was appointed military leader of the Caucasian Front by the President of Ichkeria Dokka Umarov; at the same time Yevloyev still held leadership of the Ingush Jamaat. On July 19, 2007, Taziev was named the Military Amir of the ChRI Armed Forces by Umarov; his deputies were announced to be first deputy Muhannad, second deputy Tarkhan Gaziev and third deputy Aslambek Vadalov. On October 31, 2007, Umarov proclaimed the Caucasus Emirate and it is assumed he is now the Military Amir of the Caucasus Emirate, of which the Caucasian Front is still its military branch.

Ingush authorities say Ali Taziev has been more effective in recruiting new rebels than any other previous commander in Ingushetia. Russian sources have also repeatedly blamed him for some of the most deadly attacks on security forces in Ingushetia and neighbouring regions, including the raids of Nazran and Nalchik, in which he worked closely with Shamil Basayev, Dokka Umarov, Ilyas Gorchkhanov and Anzor Astemirov. In addition, he has been assigned responsibility for the June 2009 bombing attack against Ingush President Yunus-Bek Yevkourov which badly wounded the president. It is widely believed that Ali Taziev&#x27;s tactical successes on the battlefield are fruits of his time spent as an Ingush Interior Ministry Policeman, from 1996 to 1998 before he disappeared with his partner, and the wife of a local politician they were tasked with protecting. The woman was released in Grozny, Chechnya in February 2000 unharmed, Taziev&#x27;s partner turned up dead and Taziev joined the North Caucasus Insurgency.

==Capture and trial==

On 9 June 2010, the Russian authorities announced that Taziev had been captured after voluntarily giving himself up to Ingush police. 3 years after the announcement of his capture, Taziev&#x27;s trial began on 13 May 2013 in front of a Russian court in Rostov-na-Donu. On 21 June 2013, the head of Ingushetia, Yunus-bek Yevkurov, appeared at the trial as a victim and a witness. Russian media showed footage of Taziev and Yevkurov debating with each other, with Taziev refusing to ask for forgiveness for anything he is accused of, saying instead that he would only ask for pardon from God. In October 2013, he was sentenced to life imprisonment on terrorism charges.

<doc id="957272" wikidata="Q240013" url="?curid=957272" title="Xing Huina">
<text>Xing Huina (; born February 25, 1984, in Hanting, Weifang, Shandong) is a former Chinese track and field athlete. She is widely recognised as the most successful Asian female runner of all time, after winning the Athens olympic gold medal in 2004. In a relatively short elite career that effectively ended before the age of 25, her most significant achievement was to win a shock gold in the 2004 Olympic Games in the women&#x27;s 10,000 m at the age of just 20. Narrowly missing the podium twice in the 2005 World Championships in the following year, the lifetime ban for her coach Wang Dexian for doping his athletes in 2006, and recurrent injuries, derailed her following years. A move to marathon running failed to revitalise her career, and Xing effectively retired in 2009.

==Early life==
Xing was born to family of farmers in Hanting, Weifang, Shandong. Standing 1.66 m tall and weighing 50 kg (110 lb), she began training at Weifang City Sport School, coached by Chi Yuzhai. She joined the Shandong Sport Technology Institute in 1999, coached by Yin Yanqin.

==Career==
She was selected into national team in 2002 after running 4:10.43 in 1500 m and 14:56.15 in 5000 m in 2001 Chinese National Games. In national team, she was coached by Wang Dexian. In 2002, she won bronze medal in 10,000 m in Busan Asian Games with 31:42.36. She was the first Asian athlete to be crowned the Olympic champion in this competition.

In 2003, she came in 7th and broke the World Junior Record (30:31.55) in the memorable race of 10,000m at Saint-Denis World Championships. The record was broken by Linet Masai of Kenya at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.

Xing won the gold medal in the 10,000 m race in the track and field competition at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece with 30:24.36. She overtook Ethiopian Ejagayehu Dibaba in the final straight to break the monopoly of Ethiopians, becoming the first Asian to ever have won an Olympic gold medal in women&#x27;s 10,000 metres. 

In the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki, she placed 5th in women&#x27;s 5000 m (14:43.64) and 4th in women&#x27;s 10,000 m (30:27.18). Both races were won by Ethiopian runners. 

She decided not to compete at the 2009 National Games of China in 2009 due to a persistent leg injury. The combination of the injury and her long period away from competition raised speculation that her professional career was finished at the age of 26.

==Personal bests==
*1500 m: 4:09.01 (2003)
*5000 m: 14:43.64 (2005)
*10,000 m: 30:24.36 (2004)

Her unofficial 1500 m personal best is 4:03.00, which was set at the 2005 National Games of China. However, the result was nullified because her opponent, Liu Qing filed a complaint of being deliberately blocked by Xing when Liu tried overtaking Xing.

In the 2000s, Tandon ventured into arthouse cinema with roles in the 2001 films &quot;Daman&quot; and &quot;Aks&quot;, both of which garnered her critical acclaim, winning the National Film Award for Best Actress for the former and a Filmfare Special Performance Award for the latter. Post her marriage with film distributor Anil Thadani, Tandon took a break from films. She intermittently appeared on television with shows like the Sahara One drama &quot;Sahib Biwi Gulam&quot; (2004), the dance reality show &quot;Chak De Bachche&quot; (2008) and talk shows &quot;Isi Ka Naam Zindagi&quot; (2012) and &quot;Simply Baatien with Raveena&quot; (2014).

Tandon is also an environmentalist and has worked with PETA since 2002. Tandon has four children, two adopted and two with her husband.

==Early life and background==
Tandon was born on 26 October 1972 in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) to filmmaker Ravi Tandon and Veena Tandon. Tandon is a niece of character actor Mac Mohan and thus a cousin of Manjari Makijany, his daughter. She has a brother Rajiv Tandon, who was married to actress Rakhee Tandon. She is also a cousin of actress Kiran Rathod.

Tandon received her education at Jamnabai Narsee School in Juhu and attended Mithibai College in Mumbai. Tandon started her career as a model, but during her internship at Genesis PR, she got her first film offer.

 In an interview with &quot;Rediff&quot; Tandon stated,I never thought I would become an actress. I was an intern at Genesis PR, helping [ad-man] Prahlad Kakkar, when friends and people around me started complimenting my looks. But [photographer-director] Shantanu Sheorey gave me the first break. He called and said he wanted to shoot with me. That was the time when models were becoming actors. I refused film offers. Prahlad kept saying millions of people are waiting for this chance and you keep refusing it. So I thought there is nothing to lose. Then Patthar Ke Phool happened.

==Acting career==
=== 1991–1999: Leading lady ===
Tandon debuted with the film &quot;Patthar Ke Phool&quot; (1991) which was a hit.

In 1994, Tandon had success by appearing in ten features: out of which most of them were successful, and four of the films were amongst the highest grossing productions of the year, namely: &quot;Mohra&quot;, &quot;Dilwale&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Laadla&quot;. She was nicknamed &quot;Mast Mast Girl&quot; after her performance in song &quot;Tu cheez badi hai mast mast&quot; in film &quot;Mohra&quot;.

In 1995, Tandon starred with Shah Rukh Khan for the first time in &quot;Zamaana Deewana&quot;; the film failed to do well. Her career was back on track with hit films such as &quot;Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi&quot; (1996) and &quot;Ziddi&quot; (1997) opposite &quot;Sunny Deol&quot;, become the blockbuster hit of that year and &quot;Salaakhen&quot; (1998).

In 1998, Tandon reinforced her status as a leading lady by appearing in two critically and commercially successful productions: &quot;Dulhe Raja&quot; and &quot;Bade Miyan Chote Miyan&quot;, and both of them proved to be one of the highest-grossing films of the year. Her last release of that year, &quot;Bade Miyan Chote Miyan&quot;, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda turned out to be the second biggest hit of the year. Tandon was offered the second lead in &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; which went on to be the biggest hit of 1998, but she turned it down. Her other releases of that year were &quot;Gharwali Baharwali&quot;, &quot;Vinashak: The Destroyer&quot;, &quot;Pardesi Babu&quot; and &quot;Aunty No. 1&quot;, some of which were moderate critical and commercial successes.

In 1999, Tandon starred opposite Upendra in his self-titled Kannada psychological thriller film, &quot;Upendra&quot;, a box office success. She also starred in &quot;Anari No.1&quot;, which was a critical and commercial success.

=== 2000–2006: Female-led films ===
In the 2000s, Tandon ventured into art house productions, to learn a realistic way of acting, and rejected several mainstream film offers. Tandon worked in films such as &quot;Bulandi&quot; (2000) and &quot;Aks&quot; (2001), which won her critical acclaim. She won several awards as well as the Filmfare Special Performance Award for her performance in Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra&#x27;s &quot;Aks&quot;.

Her years in the industry paid off when she won the coveted National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in Kalpana Lajmi&#x27;s &quot;Daman: A Victim of Marital Violence&quot; (2001), where she played a battered wife to an abusive husband. She surprised critics and audiences with her performance in the film and received appreciation for her work. Critic Taran Adarsh said: &quot;Raveena Tandon lends credibility to the role of a battered wife and walks away with the honours. The pathos she conveys through her expressions makes you realise that she&#x27;s a performer of substance&quot;.

Since then, she has starred in a number of critically acclaimed films, such as &quot;Satta&quot; (2003) and &quot;Dobara&quot; (2004), but has not had much box office success. Her role as a middle-class woman thrust into the world of politics in the former was praised. Critic Taran Adarsh wrote: &quot;Raveena Tandon delivers a bravura performance. The actress takes giant strides as a performer, giving the right touches to her character. Here&#x27;s a performance that&#x27;s bound to be noticed&quot;. Her role as a schizophrenic in &quot;Dobara&quot; was also praised with one critic saying: &quot;Raveena is in sync with her character, playing her part with elaan&quot;. Tandon also worked in the Sahara One television series &quot;Sahib Biwi Gulam&quot;, based on the 1953 Bengali novel &quot;Saheb Bibi Golam&quot; by Bimal Mitra.

Her only release in 2006 was &quot;Sandwich&quot; which opened to poor reviews and reception. After doing several films, she took a break from actively appearing in films.

=== 2010s: Sporadic work in film and television ===
In 2014, she judged season 1 of &quot;CEO&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; on CNBC TV18 with Mahesh Bhatt and Raj Nayak. In 2015, she made a comeback to Bollywood in longtime friend Anurag Kashyap&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;Bombay Velvet&quot;. Playing a sultry jazz singer, her brief performance was highly praised by critics.

In 2017, she was seen in the thriller movie &quot;Maatr&quot; in which she plays a mother who seeks revenge for her daughter&#x27;s rape. Her performance was lauded and she gained critical acclaim for her performance. Her next release of the year was Onir&#x27;s &quot;Shab&quot;, where she plays a socialite.

=== 2020s: Intermittent work ===
In 2021, Tandon made her OTT debut with the Netflix crime thriller web series &quot;Aranyak&quot;, and received positive reviews for her performance. In 2022, Tandon appeared in a pivotal role in &quot;K.G.F: Chapter 2&quot; which became third highest-grossing Indian film of all time.

In September 2005, Tandon resigned from her post citing personal reasons.

In November 2005, Tandon sued the websites, &quot;Shaadi.com&quot; and &quot;Shaaditimes.com&quot;, claiming that they were using unauthorised images of her to promote the site. She also sued the owner of Satyanet Solutions, as they claimed that Tandon and her husband had met through the website.

In November 2002, Tandon sang to support People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. She has posed in many advertisement campaigns joining the likes of John Abraham, Shilpa Shetty and Amisha Patel. On the issue of cows being slaughtered for their skin, she said &quot;Their abuse at the hands of corrupt skin and meat traders must be stopped&quot;.

In 2023, Tandon became the first person from the entertainment industry, chosen to be a delegate at W20, the Women&#x27;s empowerment engagement wing at G20 New Delhi summit.
