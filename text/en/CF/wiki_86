<text>John August Antonelli (April 12, 1930 – February 28, 2020) was an American professional baseball player, a left-handed starting pitcher who played for the Boston / Milwaukee Braves, New York / San Francisco Giants, and Cleveland Indians between and . Noted at the outset of his pro career as the recipient of the biggest bonus in baseball history when he signed with the Braves for $52,000 in 1948, he later became a six-time National League (NL) All-Star, a two-time 20-game-winner, and an important member of the 1954 World Series champion Giants&#x27; pitching staff. He batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed . He was the first person born in the 1930s to make his MLB debut.

Born in Rochester, New York, his hometown for most of his life, Antonelli was a sought-after pitcher for Jefferson High School. Signed by the Braves in 1948, he spent the next three seasons on their roster, never pitching more than 96 innings in a single season, before serving in the United States Army for two years during the Korean War. After one more year with the Braves in 1953, he was traded to the Giants before the 1954 season. The Giants had to give up popular outfielder Bobby Thomson in the deal, but Antonelli won 21 games, leading the National League in earned run average (ERA) (2.30) and winning percentage (.750) as the Giants won the NL pennant. In the World Series against the Indians, he outpitched Hall of Famer Early Wynn in Game 2 and got the save in Game 4 as New York swept the series.

Arm troubles bothered Antonelli in 1955, but he won 20 games for a sixth-place team in 1956, the first of four straight years he would be selected to the NL All-Star Team. After the Giants moved to San Francisco to begin the 1958 season, Antonelli won 16 games and 19 games his first two years with the ballclub. He led the NL in shutouts again in 1959 and set a career-high with 282 innings pitched, but fans started booing him after he complained about the wind conditions at Seals Stadium. In 1960, he was moved to the bullpen, accruing 11 saves before pitching one final season with the Giants and Indians in 1961. He was slated to be one of the original New York Mets in 1962, but he retired instead, opting to return to Rochester and focus on his Firestone business, which he would run for 40 years.

==Early life==
A native and lifelong resident of Rochester, New York, Antonelli was the son of Josephine (née Messore) and Gus Antonelli. Gus was a railroad track layer who had emigrated from Italy and found work with the New York Central Railroad. Johnny attended Thomas Jefferson High School in Rochester, where he excelled at baseball, basketball, and football. Initially a first baseman for the school&#x27;s baseball team, he was moved to the pitcher position by coach Charley O&#x27;Brien for his sophomore year. Antonelli&#x27;s success on the mound attracted the attention of several major league scouts; Hall of Famer Carl Hubbell found Antonelli one of the most balanced pitchers he had ever seen. Gus was eager to promote his son, renting out Silver Stadium in Johnny&#x27;s senior year so that scouts could come see him throw. In addition to scouts from 9 of the 16 Major League Baseball (MLB) teams in existence in 1948, 7,000 fans showed up for the exhibition as well. Boston Braves scout Jeff Jones was so impressed, he got team president Lou Perini to come see the high school pitcher throw. Antonelli signed with the Braves on June 29, 1948, for $52,000, the largest signing bonus in baseball history at the time. Baseball rules of the time mandated that &quot;bonus babies&quot; (players making more than $4,000) be kept on major league rosters for at least two full seasons before they could be sent to the minors. Thus, Antonelli went from high school to the MLB Braves, a veteran team challenging for Boston&#x27;s first National League pennant since 1914. He never would pitch in the minor leagues.

==Braves&#x27; &quot;bonus baby&quot;==
On July 4, 1948, Antonelli made his major league debut in the first game of a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Phillies, entering in relief to pitch the eighth inning and allowing one run in a 7–2 loss. While the Braves went on to win the 1948 NL championship, Antonelli was used largely as a batting practice pitcher. He appeared in only four games, all relief assignments in low-leverage situations. His large bonus dwarfed the salaries of veteran Braves like ace starting pitcher Johnny Sain, causing some resentment among his teammates. When the Braves voted to divide their World Series share from their loss to the Cleveland Indians, they voted not to award Antonelli any of their winnings. It took the intervention of Commissioner Happy Chandler for Antonelli to be given a loser&#x27;s share, equalling $571.31.

His second season with the Braves, 1949, brought no pennants to Boston, but it saw Antonelli gain more experience. He made his first major league start in the first game of a doubleheader against the New York Giants on May 1, allowing two runs (one earned) in eight innings and earning his first major league win in a 4–2 triumph. On June 12, also in the second game of a doubleheader, he pitched a shutout against the Chicago Cubs. He had a 3–2 win–loss record through June 19, but after losing five decisions in a row through August 3, Antonelli worked exclusively out of the bullpen for the remainder of the season. He worked in 22 games (ten starts), notching his first three career complete games and his first shutout. Antonelli won three games, lost seven, posted a 3.56 earned run average (ERA), and struck out 48 hitters in 96 innings pitched.
Before the 1950 season, Vince Johnson of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; wrote that Antonelli was &quot;the $75,000 bonus baby who hasn&#x27;t been worth $7,500.&quot; Antonelli made only six starts throughout the season, pitching out of the bullpen in his other 14 appearances. Through July 23, his ERA was 8.44, but it sunk to 5.93 when he threw a shutout against the Cincinnati Reds in the second game of a doubleheader on July 30. In the second game of a doubleheader against the Reds on September 17, he allowed one run in a complete game, 3–1 victory. Antonelli had a 2–3 record in 1950, with a 5.93 ERA, 33 strikeouts, 22 walks, and 81 hits allowed in innings pitched. It would be three years before he pitched in the major leagues, as he spent 1951 and 1952 serving in the United States Army during the Korean War. Stationed at Fort Myer, Virginia, he posted a 42–2 record while pitching for their baseball team. During his military service, he played with future teammate and Hall of Famer Willie Mays.

His two years of service over, Antonelli rejoined the Braves—now based in Milwaukee—for 1953, where he was finally a regular member of the Braves&#x27; starting rotation. On May 8, he pitched a four-hit shutout in a 2–0 win over the Chicago Cubs. He threw another shutout on June 7, allowing five hits in a 6–0 victory over the Phillies. Complete-game, one-run performances July 7 and 12 left him with an 8–4 record and a 2.86 ERA at the All-Star break, though he was not selected to the National League (NL) All-Star team. He suffered from pneumonia in the second half of the season, however, and his record was just 4–8 the rest of the year, though his ERA was 3.67. In 31 games (26 starts), he posted a 12–12 record with 71 walks, and 167 hits allowed in innings. Despite the pneumonia, Antonelli finished fifth in the NL in ERA (3.18) and seventh in the NL in strikeouts (131). With Chet Nichols Jr. returning from Korean War service in 1954, however, Braves ace Warren Spahn suggested the team trade Antonelli, as they would have had three left-handed starting pitchers otherwise, which Spahn thought would be too many.

==Giants&#x27; All-Star pitcher==
===New York (1954–57)===
In February 1954, Antonelli was dealt to the New York Giants as a major piece in a six-player trade for veteran outfielder Bobby Thomson, one of the most popular Giants since his &quot;Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot; pennant-winning home run of 1951. Mays&#x27; biographer James S. Hirsch wrote that the trade was difficult for the Giants, particularly owner Horace Stoneham, who tried to be loyal to long-time members of the organization; however, the Giants needed pitching reinforcement in order to compete. &quot;It was the best break of my career,&quot; Antonelli said of the transaction. Facing Milwaukee on June 9, he threw a seven-hit shutout, outpitching Spahn in the Giants&#x27; 4–0 triumph. On the strength of an eight-decision winning streak, he was selected to the All-Star team for the first time. He threw a three hit shutout against the Phillies on July 5; Antonelli had also allowed three hits in a shutout victory over them on April 25. Pitching on three days&#x27; rest on July 20, on a day when it was over at Crosley Field in Cincinnati, Antonelli showed what sportswriter John Drebinger called &quot;an extraordinary display of stamina,&quot; pitching all 13 innings of a 2–1 victory over the Cincinnati Redlegs. He won 11 straight decisions from May 25 through August 1. With fellow starters Sal Maglie and Rubén Gómez, Antonelli made starting pitching the Giants&#x27; strength. In 1954, Antonelli went 21–7, led the league in ERA (2.30) and shutouts (six), and pitched the Giants to the pennant. He and fellow Giant Hoyt Wilhelm led the NL in winning percentage, with a .750 mark. Antonelli, Maglie, and Gomez combined to win 52 games, complete 37 starts, and help the Giants pitchers post an ERA of 3.09, the lowest in the National League. Hirsch wrote that Antonelli was &quot;[t]he Giants&#x27; best pitcher that year,&quot; and Antonelli won &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Pitcher of the Year Award, as well as finishing third in NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting (the Cy Young Award had not been introduced yet). Against the Cleveland Indians in the 1954 World Series, Antonelli started Game 2, pitching in and out of trouble all day but allowing one run and outpitching Hall of Famer Early Wynn to earn the victory in the Giants&#x27; 3–1 triumph. &quot;The Good Lord was on my side that game,&quot; he later said in an interview. &quot;I don’t think I had my best stuff that day.&quot; In Game 4, he entered with one out and a runner on first in the eighth inning, then retired five of the six hitters he faced, earning a save in the 7–4 victory as the Giants pulled off a four-game sweep.
Although the post-1954 Giants, like the 1949–50 Braves, fell back in the standings, Antonelli had more years of success ahead of him. The Giants were only going to pay him $9,000 (his 1954 salary) in 1955, but teammate Alvin Dark advised him to ask for double or more. Antonelli took his advice and got $28,000. On May 1, he pitched a 16-inning complete game, allowing one run in a 2–1 triumph over Cincinnati. He had a 4–4 record through May 18 but went 3–8 over his next 14 games, posting a 5.61 ERA in that timespan. Starting July 24, he went 7–4 to finish the season, posting a 2.51 ERA. He threw a shutout against the Cardinals on August 2, striking out nine in a 3–0 victory. 
In the first game of a doubleheader against Cincinnati on August 30, he threw another shutout, allowing five hits in a 5–0 victory over Cincinnati. Against the Philadelphia Phillies on September 3, he was removed from the game by Durocher when the Phillies got two runners to reach in the fifth with one out and the Giants leading 3–2. Pitching coach Freddie Fitzsimmons went to the mound to inform Antonelli he had been removed, and the irate Giants hurler refused to turn the ball over to Fitzsimmons. He stomped around on the mound, walked halfway to second base, then talked to Fitzsimmons for about two minutes before finally heading to the Giants dugout. Durocher said that when he met Antonelli in the dugout, the pitcher cussed and threatened to take the train home to New York; as a result, Durocher suspended Antonelli indefinitely without pay, pending an apology. The suspension was short-lived; back in action four days later, Antonelli threw a complete game, holding the Cardinals to two runs (one earned) and hitting a three-run home run against Larry Jackson as the Giants won 8–2. Antonelli pitched the whole season in 1955 and had a 3.33 ERA but only went 14–16. His 16 losses tied him with Harvey Haddix and teammate Jim Hearn for second in the NL (behind Sam Jones&#x27;s 20), but his 143 strikeouts tied Don Newcombe for the fourth-highest total in the league. Mays remembered that Antonelli was bothered by &quot;arm problems&quot; that year. Offensively, Antonelli set career highs in home runs (4) and RBI (15).

Despite his 1955 performance, Antonelli saw his salary cut from $28,000 to $21,000 in 1956; the Giants said he needed to win 20 games to get it raised to its previous level. Pitching for a sixth-place team in 1956, Antonelli only managed to win nine games through August 7, against 12 losses. However, he won 11 of his final 12 starts to finish with 20 wins exactly. Mays said he was the only Giants starter who could get outs that year. In the first game of a doubleheader on May 20, he struck out seven in a five-hit shutout of the Cardinals. On June 19, he again had a five-hit seven-strikeout shutout, this one coming against the Cubs. At midseason, he and Mays were the Giants&#x27; only selections to the NL All-Star team. On August 15, he struck out 11 and allowed just two hits in a 1–0 shutout victory over the Dodgers. He only struck out three hitters but gave up just three hits on September 12 in a shutout of the Redlegs. In his last start of the season, Antonelli threw his fifth shutout of the year, a four-hitter in a 2–0 victory over the Phillies. With a 20–13 record, Antonelli ranked among the NL leaders in wins (tied for second with Spahn behind Newcombe&#x27;s 27), ERA (2.86, third, behind Lew Burdette&#x27;s 2.70 and Spahn&#x27;s 2.78), strikeouts (145, sixth), and shutouts (five, tied with Newcome for second behind Burdette&#x27;s six). He finished 14th in NL MVP voting, and Giant fans from Section Five of the Polo Grounds made him a three-foot tall trophy for being the team MVP; years later, the trophy was one of the few mementos from his career Antonelli displayed at his house.

On April 30, 1957, Antonelli struck out nine in a 4–0 shutout of the Braves. Through May 28, Antonelli was 3–6 with a 4.66 ERA. After he gave up four runs without recording an out against Philadelphia that day, he worked exclusively in relief for two weeks. By June 18, his ERA was 4.95. Demonstrating improvement before the All-Star break, he was selected to the NL All-Star Team by Walt Alston, who managed the Giants&#x27; archrivals, the Dodgers. Against the Cardinals on July 11, he threw another shutout in a 1–0 victory. He improved his record to 11–11 with a win on August 3 but went 1–7 for the rest of the season. Late in 1957, Bill Rigney held him out of the rotation for a few days to ensure that Antonelli could start the Giants&#x27; final game at the Polo Grounds before moving to San Francisco. However, Antonelli took the loss in that game on September 29, allowing four runs in two innings as the Pirates won 9–1. In 40 games (30 starts), he had a 12–18 record, a 3.77 ERA, and 114 strikeouts in innings pitched. His 18 losses tied with Bob Friend for second in the league, behind Robin Roberts&#x27;s 22.

===San Francisco (1958–60)===
On May 5, 1958, with the Giants trailing the Pirates 11–4 in the ninth inning, Antonelli pinch-hit for Pete Burnside and had an RBI double against Vern Law, eventually scoring himself as the Giants rallied, though San Francisco still lost 11–10. Entering a tie game in the ninth inning on June 8, he threw six shutout innings as the Giants defeated the Phillies 5–4 in 14 innings. For the third year in a row, he was a part of the NL All-Star team. On July 6, he threw shutout innings, earning the win in a 1–0 triumph over the Pirates. He worked 10 innings on August 19, striking out eight in a 4–3 victory over the Redlegs. On September 28, he came within one out of a complete game, allowing three runs (two earned) in a 4–3 victory over St. Louis. In 41 games (13 starts), he had a 16–13 record. On the one hand, he led the NL in home runs allowed (31) and failed to throw a shutout for the first time since 1948. However, he was still among the league leaders in wins (sixth), ERA (3.28, sixth), and strikeouts (143, tied with Johnny Podres for third behind Jones&#x27;s 225 and Spahn&#x27;s 150).

On May 11, 1959, Antonelli pitched 11 innings against the Dodgers, allowing just one earned run but getting a no decision in a 13-inning, 2–1 defeat. Against the Cubs on May 31, he struck out a season-high 11 batters in a 6–3 victory. He threw back-to-back shutouts against the Phillies and Cubs in victories on June 28 and July 3. MLB held two All-Star Games in 1959, and Antonelli was selected to both of them. Although he only pitched one-third of an inning, he was the winning pitcher in relief in the first All-Star Game on July 7, when the NL rallied from a 4–3 deficit in the eighth inning to prevail over the American League, 5–4, at Forbes Field. He pitched two other shutouts against the Phillies on July 16 and August 21, the first coming in a 1–0 victory where Antonelli gave up just three hits. After giving up two home runs to the Dodgers on July 20, he was critical of Seals Stadium, where the Giants were playing while Candlestick Park was constructed. &quot;A pitcher should be paid double for working here,&quot; he said. &quot;Worst ballpark in America. Every time you stand up there, you’ve got to beat the hitter and a 30-mile-per-hour wind.&quot; This impaired his relation with the San Francisco fans, several of whom took to booing him during games, though Antonelli denied criticizing the city itself. Still, he went 19–10 in 38 starts for the Giants, and tying for the NL shutout lead (four) with six other pitchers. Antonelli also ranked among the league leaders in wins (fourth, behind Jones&#x27;s, Spahn&#x27;s, and Burdette&#x27;s 21), ERA (3.10, seventh), strikeouts (165, fourth, behind Don Drysdale&#x27;s 242, Jones&#x27;s 209, and Sandy Koufax&#x27;s 173), and innings pitched (282, his career high, and the third-highest total in the league behind Spahn&#x27;s 292 and Burdette&#x27;s ). He batted .158 but had 10 RBI, as a hitter.

The move to Candlestick Park in 1960 did not help Antonelli, who had trouble winning. His first two games of the season came in relief, his first start not coming until the Giants&#x27; 18th game of the year on May 5. On May 15, he threw a shutout in a 2–0 victory over the Dodgers. Antonelli lost four games in a row from May 27 through June 11, however, and spent most of the rest of the season in the bullpen, only making two more starts all season. Robert H. Boyle of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote of him in July, &quot;Yes, what with three wins and five losses, yesterday&#x27;s hero is now in the bullpen.&quot; Used often at the end of games, Antonelli converted 11 saves in 14 tries, tying with Turk Farrell for fifth in the NL in that category. In 41 games (10 starts), he had a 6–7 record, a 3.77 ERA, 57 strikeouts, and 106 hits allowed in innings. He walked 47 hitters, but ten of those were intentional. On December 3, he was traded to the Indians (his 1954 World Series foe) with Willie Kirkland for Harvey Kuenn.

==Indians and Braves, retirement==
The Indians made Antonelli their fourth starter to begin the 1961 season. After a no-decision in his first start of 1961, he lost his next four attempts, with his ERA ballooning to 6.04, before he was moved to the bullpen. On July 4, his contract was sold to his original organization, the Braves. He worked in nine games for Milwaukee, all in relief, and won his only decision, but his ERA (7.59) was higher than it had been in Cleveland (6.56). His final major league appearance came on September 4, when he allowed a run in two innings in a 6–2 loss to the Cubs. In 20 games (seven starts) between Cleveland and Milwaukee, Antonelli had a 1–4 record, a 6.75 ERA, 31 strikeouts, 21 walks, and 84 hits allowed in innings pitched. On October 11, his contract was sold again, this time to the expansion New York Mets, a deal that would have returned Antonelli to the ballpark (the Polo Grounds) and the city where he had experienced his greatest MLB success. But instead of pitching for the Mets, he decided to retire in February 1962. Antonelli said he was &quot;tired of traveling&quot; and wanted to be home with his family. &quot;I guess Johnny Antonelli is doing all right selling those black doughnuts in Rochester,&quot; Mets manager Casey Stengel said, in reference to Antonelli&#x27;s Firestone business.

==Career statistics, pitching style==
In 12 MLB seasons, Antonelli worked in 377 regular-season games, with 268 starts. He fashioned a 126–110 record, with 102 complete games, 25 shutouts and 21 saves. In 1,992 innings pitched, he allowed 1,870 hits and 687 walks, striking out 1,162. His career earned run average was 3.34. In two World Series games in 1954, he compiled a 1–0 record, allowing one run (on a home run to Cleveland&#x27;s Al Smith leading off Game 2) on eight hits and seven bases on balls in 10 innings pitched, with 12 strikeouts, for an earned run average of 0.84
. In All-Star play, he pitched in three of the six midsummer games he was selected to (in 1954, 1956 and 1959) and compiled an ERA of 4.26 in 6 innings pitched, winning the first All-Star Game of 1959.

As a hitter, Antonelli posted a .178 batting average (121-for-679) with 56 runs, 15 home runs, 59 RBI and 26 bases on balls. From 1956 through the end of his career, he served as a pinch hitter or pinch runner in at least one game each season.

Antonelli relied on a fastball and curveball when he was pitching, but he also threw some off-speed pitches occasionally. He credited the Polo Grounds for some of his success upon coming to New York. &quot;The Polo Grounds was a friendly ballpark for me. I was able to keep batters from pulling the ball. I made them hit the ball straight away, and I had Willie Mays to track it down.&quot;

==Personal life==
While he was pitching for the Braves, Antonelli married Rosemarie Carbone, whom he had met in Boston. The couple had four children: Lisa, Donna, Regina, and John Jr. After Rosemarie died in 2002, Antonelli remarried to Gail Harms in 2006.

On November 5, 1954, Antonelli&#x27;s hometown of Rochester declared a &quot;Johnny Antonelli Day,&quot; throwing a parade in the pitcher&#x27;s honor and presenting him with a new Buick as well as a key to the city. Antonelli, who had lived in Lexington, Massachusetts, during his time with the Braves, announced plans to move back to Rochester &quot;in the very near future.&quot; He was good to his word, opening up a chain of Firestone Tire stores in the city. &quot;I started the business with my World Series money,&quot; he told the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; in 2014. His first location opened in 1955 at the intersection of Keeler Street and North Clinton Avenue. Over time, the business expanded to 28 locations in Monroe County as well as other parts of New York state, as Antonelli was the exclusive Firestone dealer for the area. While the Rochester Red Wings still played at Silver Stadium, the tire company sponsored an annual &quot;Johnny Antonelli Night,&quot; giving away tires and televisions. Antonelli&#x27;s stores also sponsored &quot;Captain Friendly,&quot; a program in which store managers would drive around Rochester looking for people with car trouble, then help them free of charge. Antonelli ran the businesses until 1994, retiring over frustrations with Bridgestone, which had purchased Firestone in the meantime. &quot;We were just spinning our wheels,&quot; he said. By 2012, he lived in Pittsford, a Rochester suburb. He once served as a board member for the Red Wings, and he was a member of the Oak Hill Country Club, as golf was a hobby of his. Antonelli died of cancer on February 28, 2020, at the age of 89.

==History==

===Ancient era===
The first humans in Ansan were in the New Stone Age, and many shell middens and prehistoric remains were found at Oido, Sihwaho, Chojidong and Daebudo. In the Seonbu-dong and Wolpi-dong area, over 10 stone dolmen tombs could be found. Also in 1995, Old Stone Age relics were found while constructing the Seohaean Expressway. Most dolmens in Ansan are north dolmen, but the dolmen in Seonbu-dong are table-shaped and another table-shaped tomb was found in Hakon-dong, Gwangmyeong. There are many ancient relics found in the city.

===Three Kingdoms and Goryeo eras===
Not much evidence or antiquities survive from the Proto-Three Kingdoms and Samhan periods are in Ansan and nearby areas. The Mahan confederacy in Chen Shou in Records of the Three Kingdoms preserves writings about the chiefdom state. Ansan was in communion with Baekje but very little has been saved.

In the Later Three Kingdoms era, the Ansan area was owned by Taebong (also known as Hugoguryeo, &quot;Later Goguryeo&quot;) in Silla Hyogong&#x27;s 4th year (AD 900). After then, Gung Ye, who was the ruler of Taebong, was overthrown by Wang Geon, and the Ansan area was turned over to Goryeo, founded by Wang Geon. First, the Gung Ye Ganggu-gun was changed to Ansan-gun but the state of the military was preserved.

===Joseon era===
Ansan belonged to Gyeonggijwa-do (left Gyeonggi Province) in the Joseon period. Taejo&#x27;s 5th year (AD 1396), Ansan-eoso (meaning Ansan fishery) that is now under the direct control of a detached building of Saongwon (the Department of foods and meals in the Joseon dynasty) was set up. After Gyeonggijwa-do and Gyeonggiwo-do (right Gyeonggi province) were unified in Teajong&#x27;s 2nd year (AD 1402), Ansan was still called Ansan. Under Teajong&#x27;s 13th (1413), the whole country was detached into eight provinces.

===Modern era===
Until 1914, Ansan City and the southern part of today&#x27;s Siheung consisted of Ansan County. In 1914, Ansan County was annexed to Siheung County. This region produced high-quality salt from ancient times and valuable marine products. Ansan was then a fishing village.
In 1986, several towns of Hwaseong county became incorporated, representing the beginning of Ansan as a city. With currently over 700,000 residents, Ansan now has two distinct and separate districts: Danwon, which has 12 dongs as of 2009, and Sangnok, with 13.

Large portions of Ansan, over 100 sq miles, are reclaimed wetlands, part of the Saemangeum land reclamation project known as Ansan Reed Marshy Park.

Located at the south of the city (but within its jurisdiction) are islands of Daebudo and Pungdo. On land, the city boundaries is marked by the town of Gunpo to the east of Ansan, Anyang to north-east, Siheung to the north and Hwaseong to the south.

==Economy==
Because Ansan is a planned city built behind the Ansan Smart Hub following the government&#x27;s industrial planning, the proportion of agriculture in the Ansan economy is very low. Meanwhile, as the government promoted a manufacturing industry plan in the Ansan area before Ansan was built, many people work in the manufacturing industry. There are two national industrial complexes, Banwol and Sihwa, as well as the local Banwol plating industrial complex.

==Cultural institutions and heritage==
In the past, Ansan had fewer attractions and a poor reputation due to its industrial and fishing roots, but the east side of the city has recently experienced several beautification projects. The canal systems which bisect the city have bicycling and walking paths, and are covered with roses, tulips, and cherry blossoms in spring. A community bicycle system sponsored by the city is also available for park access and riding. Nowadays, Ansan has many museums and galleries, such as the Ansan Culture and Arts Center, Seongho Memorial Hall, Danwon Sculpture Park, and Hwarang Public Garden. Ansan has run city bus tours for cultural heritage sightseeing since 2008.

<text>A news ticker (sometimes called a crawler, crawl, slide, zipper, ticker tape, or chyron) is a horizontal or vertical (depending on a language&#x27;s writing system) text-based display either in the form of a graphic that typically resides in the lower third of the screen space on a television station or network (usually during news programming) or as a long, thin scoreboard-style display seen around the facades of some offices or public buildings dedicated to presenting headlines or minor pieces of news. It is an evolution of the ticker tape, a continuous paper print-out of stock quotes from a printing telegraph which was mainly used in stock exchanges before the advance of technology in the 1960s.

News tickers have been used in Europe in countries such as United Kingdom, Germany and Ireland for some years; they are also used in several Asian countries and Australia. In the United States, tickers were long used on a special event basis by broadcast television stations to disseminate weather warnings, school closings, and election results. Sports telecasts occasionally used a ticker to update other contests in progress before the expansion of cable news networks and the internet for news content. In addition, some ticker displays are used to relay continuous stock quotes (usually with a delay of as much as 15 minutes) during trading hours of major stock market exchanges.

Most tickers are traditionally displayed in the form of scrolling text running from right to left across the screen or building display (or in the opposite direction for right-to-left writing systems such as Arabic script and Hebrew), allowing for headlines of varying degrees of detail; some used by television broadcasters, however, display stories in a static manner (allowing for the seamless switching of each story individually programmed for display) or utilize a &quot;flipping&quot; effect (in which each individual headline is shown for a few seconds before transitioning to the next, instead of scrolling across the screen, usually resulting in a relatively quicker run through of all of the information programmed into the ticker). Since the growth in usage of the World Wide Web, some news tickers have syndicated news stories posted largely on websites of broadcasters or by other independent news agencies.

==Current uses==

===Television===
The presentation of headlines or other information in a news ticker has become a common element of many different news networks. The use of the ticker has differed on a number of channels:

* News networks and local newscasts commonly use a setup in which news headlines are scrolled across an area near the bottom of the screen, though some variations have formed, such as showing one headline at a time with a scrolling or &quot;flipper&quot; effect.
* Financial news channels use two or more tickers displaying stock prices and business headlines.
* Networks with a focus on sports often use a slightly different system, where scores and statuses of ongoing and finished games are displayed one by one, along with minor sports highlights, statistics and sports news headlines. They are typically divided into categories devoted to specific leagues and events (with college basketball and football usually focusing on the top 25 ranked teams on the AP Poll, occasionally supplemented by sections for specific conferences).
* Some programs, including news-based programs emphasizing viewer interactivity, or special events, may also use tickers to display messages and reactions from viewers and others that relate to the program. These comments are often sourced from social networking services such as Facebook and Twitter, typically curating comments from a specific page or hashtag.

Due to their current prevalence, they have been occasionally been made targets of pranks and vandalism. In one such example, News 14 Carolina allowed viewers to submit relevant information such as school closings or traffic delays via telephone or the Internet that would be incorporated into the ticker; the system was exploited in February 2004 to display humorous and crude messages, including the infamous &quot;All your base are belong to us&quot;. Occasionally messages intended for training accidentally end up being put on the live ticker as happened on BBC News in 2022 when &quot;Weather rain everywhere&quot; and &quot;Manchester United are rubbish&quot; appeared on the live news ticker. 

Some businesses and organizations have utilized tickers intended for relaying weather-related closings as a surreptitious source for free guerrilla marketing, proclaiming they were open rather than closed and giving their phone number if possible, allowing them to &#x27;advertise&#x27; on a television station all day for free. Since then, many stations have required pre-registration of businesses or organizations with an authorized representative and a signed affidavit on company letterhead affirming their authenticity, along with filtering out unfamiliar businesses and organizations, before being able to display their closing announcements. Stations also confirm all closings involving school districts with authorized officials to prevent situations in which students either show up to canceled classes in dangerous conditions, or do not attend school due to an erroneous, prank-submitted, or false listing.

===On personal computers===
Various applications have been developed over time to install news tickers on personal computer desktops using RSS feeds from news organizations, which are displayed in a fashion similar to those used by television channels but enable the user to access to underlying news stories, a feature not offered by traditional television channels. The Bloomberg Terminal and other stock market-tracking programs and devices also utilize tickers.

A ticker may also be used as an unobtrusive method by businesses in order to deliver important information to their staff. The ticker can be set to reappear, stay on screen, or be put into a retractable mode (where a small tab is left visible on-screen).

In the United Kingdom, broadcasters have stopped using this technology as other forms of communications have become available and increased in popularity. BBC News and Sky News discontinued their respective desktop tickers in March 2011 and 2012 to focus on other products, such as smartphone applications, to deliver updated information on breaking news and sport stories.

===News tickers on buildings===

Since the advent of the telegraph, newspapers commonly used their buildings to share the latest headlines. At first simple chalkboard signs were used for bulletins, but limelight illumination, electric lights, magic lantern projections, and other novel techniques were later employed. The method of using electric lights to spell out moving letters was invented by Frank C. Reilly (August 20, 1888 – April 10, 1947) and patented in 1923. Reilly called his invention the Motograph News Bulletin.


In 1928, &quot;The New York Times&quot; installed a Motograph News Bulletin to display news headlines on the sides of Times Tower. The display was long, high, and employed over 14,800 light bulbs. Popularly known as the &quot;Zipper&quot;, the sign remained in use until the building was sold in 1961. The sign was darkened during World War II to comply with wartime lighting restrictions. The Motograph operated until 1994 and was replaced by an electronic version in 1995, which was in turn removed in 2018 due to the replacement of all individual screens on the front of One Times Square with a -tall LED billboard in 2018.

Ticker displays appear today on the exterior of the News Corp Building, which houses the headquarters for Fox News Channel/News Corp in the west extension of Manhattan&#x27;s Rockefeller Center, as well as one that displays delayed stock market data that is located in Times Square. NASDAQ itself features a large display screen on the facade of the NASDAQ MarketSite building in Times Square.

The Reuters buildings at Canary Wharf and in Toronto have news and stock tickers; the latter type features market data for the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and London Stock Exchange, while the Toronto building&#x27;s ticker also includes quotes from the Toronto Stock Exchange.

A red-LED ticker was added to the perimeter of 10 Rockefeller Center in 1994, as the building was being renovated to accommodate the studios for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;. Placed at the juncture of the first and second floors, the ticker is visible to spectators in Rockefeller Plaza and passersby on West 49th Street and updates continuously, even at times when &quot;Today&quot; is not being produced and broadcast. As of 2015, the ticker strip is only a small part of a large two-floor LCD video display that is placed within the window of the studio showing promotional information.

The Martin Place Headquarters of Seven News, the news division of Australian television broadcaster Seven Network, also incorporates a ticker that wraps around the building.

==In popular culture==
The use of news tickers has also been parodied on a number of films and television programs, including a 2003 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington&quot;), as well as a sketch featured on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Some programs and films such as &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; sometimes place jokes within their parody news crawls. The Onion News Network uses a parody ticker to offer jokes in its online newscasts. The Australian comedy news series &quot;CNNNN&quot; went a step further: although it featured a joke news ticker throughout the show, one episode featured a news ticker that summarized the initial news ticker, as well as one for the sight impaired, which covered the whole screen.

The music video for the Chamillionaire rap single &quot;Hip Hop Police&quot; incorporated a parodical news ticker announcing the arrests of famous musicians.

<doc id="967681" wikidata="Q561800" url="?curid=967681" title="Murat Zyazikov">
<text>Murat Magometovich Zyazikov () (born September 10, 1957) is a Russian politician who was the second president of the southern Russian republic of Ingushetia. He was born in what is now Kyrgyzstan. Zyazikov was a controversial politician in Ingushetia.

==Political career==
In the 1980s, Zyazikov was a member of the KGB and later the FSB. In the 1990s, he became part of Ingushetia&#x27;s security council and on May 23, 2002, he was elected president of the republic in the controversial circumstances. Zyazikov is considered a close ally with current Russian president and former Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, especially because of his province&#x27;s proximity to Chechnya.

On April 6, 2004, Zyazikov was lightly wounded when a car bomb was rammed into his motorcade (he sat in an armored Mercedes W140) on the main road near the city of Nazran. Zyazikov blamed Chechen rebels for that attack and a June 2004 raid in Ingushetia that killed more than 90 people.

On February 27, 2006, Zyazikov&#x27;s father-in-law (and a member of provincial legislature) Magomet Chakhkiyev was kidnapped in Nazran after his car was shot at and crashed. On March 30, 2006, the kidnappers made their demands: they wanted Zyazikov and Ingushetia prosecutor general Makhmud-Ali Kalimatov to resign in exchange for Chakhkiyev&#x27;s release. He was released by the police on May 1, 2006, apparently without any payments to the kidnappers. The kidnappers have not been arrested.

On March 23, 2007, his 72-year-old uncle, Uruskhan Zyazikov, was kidnapped in Barsuki, Ingushetia by four armed men. A reward of 2,000,000 rubles (approximately $77,200) for information leading to his return was announced on March 29, 2007. No demands were made by the kidnappers at that point. On June 29, 2007, Zyazikov announced at a press conference that his uncle was still alive. He didn&#x27;t offer any more information about the kidnapping. The Interior Minister of Ingushetia, Beslan Khamkhoyev, resigned and was replaced by Musa Medov a day before the press conference, apparently as a fallout from the kidnapping. The uncle was released by the kidnappers unharmed on October 11, 2007.

Zyazikov has been accused by the government&#x27;s critics of corruption and inability to deal with political unrest which has plagued the Ingush republic. The opposition attribute the growing violence to popular anger fueled by alleged abductions, beatings, unlawful arrests and killings of suspects by the federal forces and local police and allied paramilitaries. Amid the increasing tensions, Zyazikov fired his government in March 2008, and called for further social and economic reforms.

==Personal life==
Zyazikov is married to Luiza Magometovna Chakhiyeva (), an ophthalmologist and they have three sons.

==Dismissal==
On October 30, 2008, Murat Zyazikov was dismissed from his post by the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, As reported by an Interfax news agency.

==Current activities==
As of 31 October 2008, Zyazikov is one of the few advisors to Dmitry Medvedev. Zyazikov is also the president of FC Angusht Nazran. He was appointed Ambassador of Russia to Cyprus on 12 September 2022.

==Controversy==
On August 31, 2008, after using the same aeroplane as Zyazikov, journalist Magomet Yevloyev was arrested at the airport. Yevloyev was shot in the temple and killed while in Nazran police custody. Weeks before his killing, Magomet reportedly knew his life was in danger and had planned on seeking political asylum in a European Union country. Local police claimed that Yevloyev was shot after he had attempted to grab an assault rifle from one of the police officers in the car. Human rights groups have rejected this account of Yevloyev&#x27;s death, and the US State Department has called for an investigation of the killing and that those responsible be &quot;held to account for what happened&quot;.

<text>Bucheon (; ) is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. Bucheon is located away from Seoul, of which it is a satellite city. It is located between Incheon and Seoul.

Bucheon is the second most densely populated city in South Korea after Seoul, and as a result, administrative districts were abolished in July 2016 in favor of providing greater public service in community centers.

Major manufacturing operations are located in the northern areas of the city, while the areas in the south where Seoul Subway Line 7 and Seoul Subway Line 1 pass are dense commercial and residential areas.

== History ==
In 1914, the outer areas of Incheon (including Gwangyo-dong, old Incheon&#x27;s city center) and Bupyeong County were joined under the name &quot;Bucheon&quot;. In 1931, Gyenam township (&quot;myeon&quot;, 계남면) was renamed Sosa township (&quot;myeon&quot;, 소사면). In 1936, the westernmost part of Bucheon, then part of old Incheon, was incorporated in Incheon and in 1940 some other part of old Incheon belonging to Bucheon Country was incorporated in Incheon again while part of old Bupyeong was annexed to Incheon at the same time. In 1941, Sosa township promoted to &quot;eup&quot; (town) status.

On January 1, 1963, when the great expansion of Seoul was implemented, several districts were combined to Yeongdeungpo District of Seoul as below.

In 1988, two districts were established. Bucheon was divided into Nam-gu (&quot;south&quot;, ) and Jung-gu (&quot;central&quot;, ) along the Seoul-Incheon trainline. Present day Sosa-gu was formerly called Nam-gu.

In 1993, Bucheon&#x27;s Jung-gu was separated into two further districts, forming Wonmi () and Ojeong () Districts.

The three districts were abolished in July 2016 as Bucheon decided to become a unified city without any administrative districts. However, on January 1, 2024, the Bucheon municipal government decided to return the three districts, along with the creation of 37 new administrative districts (or dongs).

== Statistics ==
== Arts and education ==
Bucheon promotes itself as the cultural centre of the Seoul Metropolitan Area. The Bucheon Philharmonic Orchestra is located there, an annual international film festival is held in July called the Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival or BiFan, and an annual international bboy competition called Bucheon Bboy International Championship (BBIC) held by Jinjo Crew since 2016.

Bucheon&#x27;s institutions of higher education include: Bucheon College, Yuhan College, Catholic University of Korea Bucheon campus, and Seoul Theological University.

The city was designated &quot;City of Literature&quot; and has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network since 2017.

== Festival ==

* Bucheon Aiins World festival - The miniature theme park Aiins World is hosting the World Nightview Fantasy Lighting Festival. There are famous buildings like the Eiffel Tower in France. The festival runs from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. all year long, and is closed on rainy days. The last admission is at 10 p.m.
* Bucheon B-Boy International Championship (BBIC) - An international B-Boy competition held by world-famous B-Boy group Jinjo Crew.

== Climate ==
Bucheon has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm.
== Transportation ==

Bucheon has an extensive bus network of local and area buses that connect the city to Seoul, Incheon and other surrounding cities. Bucheon Bus Terminal has buses connecting to different cities and provinces throughout the country. The Seoul Subway System Line 1 and Line 7 runs through Bucheon. There are currently five stations in Seoul Subway Line Line 1 within Bucheon, including Bucheon station and Songnae station, and seven stations in the Line 7, including Kkachiul, Bucheon Stadium, Chunui, Sinjung-dong, Bucheon City Hall, and Sang-dong, which continues through Incheon ending at Bupyeong station.

Two more subway lines were recently added. The Sosa-Wonsi Line opened in 2018, connecting Bucheon&#x27;s Sosa station of the Line 1 with Ansan&#x27;s Choji station of Seoul Subway Line 4. The Daegok-Sosa Line opened in 2022, connecting with the Sosa-Wonsi Line as a single line. It will provide subway service in the northern area of Bucheon and connect the city to Gimpo International Airport station where transfers to Seoul Subway Line 5, Seoul Subway Line 9, AREX and Gimpo Goldline will be available. The line terminates at Daegok station in Goyang, which offers a transfer to Seoul Subway Line 3 and Gyeongui-Jungang Line.

In addition, the city is getting a completely new subway line in the future which will connect Bucheon&#x27;s northern Wonjeong area to Hongik University station.

== Religion ==
There are a number of churches in Bucheon, including a Full Gospel Church near Lotte Department Store and the English-language &quot;Bucheon Onnuri English Ministry&quot; (BOEM) in Sang Dong. There is also a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints located a short ways north of Bucheon station. Evangelism and mission is a key expression of Christianity in the Bucheon churches.

== Geography ==

Ilsan New Town vaguely comes to mind, but in reality, the eastern boundary is Bukhansan, the western boundary is the Han River, and the city area itself is large and has various geographical features. However, Bukhansan is a region protruding to the east, and the eastern end of the border with Seoul is actually a hilly area connecting Mt. Aengbong and Mt. Bongsan. Across the Han River to the west is the city of Gimpo.

At the time of the expansion of Seoul, the eastern area was given to Seoul, but Bukhansan was guided, so if you look closely at the administrative divisions on the map, it looks like a kitchen knife or a stake. Bukhansan Mountain is clearly visible from the vicinity of Jichuk, and surprisingly, if you drive along the freeway from the middle floor of an apartment building in Ilsan New Town [10] or even from the side of Isanpo, you can see Bukhansan Mountain in the distance. You can roughly estimate the weather on that day by whether you can see it well or not.

=== Climate ===
Goyang has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;) with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers.
== Sports ==

The ice hockey team High1, based in Chuncheon, played some of its home Asia League Ice Hockey matches at the Goyang Ice Rink, before they withdrew from the league in 2019.

Former football teams in Goyang include Goyang KB Kookmin Bank FC and Goyang Zaicro FC. Currently, there is the K4 League team Goyang Citizen FC.

The Korean Basketball League team Goyang Sono Skygunners is also based in the city.

<doc id="967690" wikidata="Q2082182" url="?curid=967690" title="Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)">
<text>The Addis Ababa Agreement, also known as the Addis Ababa Accord, was a set of compromises within a 1972 treaty that ended the First Sudanese Civil War (1955–1972) fighting in Sudan. The Addis Ababa accords were incorporated in the Constitution of Sudan.

==Preliminaries and Negotiations==
Direct Negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the Southern Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM) in Addis Ababa were preceded in 1971 by a series of discussions through the intermediation of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) and World Council of Churches (WCC). In Addis Ababa, in 1972, Abel Alier led the delegation representing the Government of Sudan. Ezboni Mondiri led the delegation of the SSLM. The negotiations were moderated by Burgess Carr, who was then the Secretary General of the All Africa Conference of Churches.

==Results==
The Agreement had the goal to address and appease concerns of the southern Sudan liberation and secession movement, as the First Sudanese Civil War grew costly in lives and resources to the northern Sudanese government and southern population. The Addis Ababa Agreement&#x27;s establishment of the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region gave a degree of autonomy to the south. It meant southern Sudan would no longer be divided into the three separate regions Al-Istiwāʾiyyah (Equatoria), Baḥr al-Ghazāl, and Aʿālī al-Nīl (Upper Nile). The region would run itself through a separate legislative and executive body. The soldiers of the Anya Nya would be integrated into the Sudanese army and police force. The Addis Ababa Agreement gave Nimeri popularity and prestige both within Sudan and outside of the country.

A decade of relative peace followed, though the Addis Ababa Agreement failed to dispel the tensions that had originally caused civil war. The Addis Ababa Agreement proved to be only temporary respite. Resource infringements and marginalisation by the north led to increased unrest in the south starting in the late 1970s.

==Termination==
In 1983 President Gaafar Nimeiry declared all Sudan an Islamic state under Sharia law, including the non-Islamic majority southern region. The Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was abolished on 5 June 1983, ending the Addis Ababa Agreement. This initiated the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005).

<doc id="967692" wikidata="Q42075" url="?curid=967692" title="Gunpo">
<text>Gunpo (; ), formerly romanized as Kunp&#x27;o, is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. It is south of Seoul and in the Seoul National Capital Area. It borders Anyang to the north, Uiwang to the east, and Ansan to the south and west, and is connected to its neighbors and to Seoul by lines 1 and 4 of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway. Gunpo is also home to three stops on the Gyeongbu Line, a national railway that links it to the rest of the country. Although 73.2% of the city is greenspace, owing largely to Surisan and various smaller mountains, Gunpo is home to over 286,000 residents in several urban areas. The city&#x27;s downtown core is Sanbon New Town, a commercial hub which centers on a pedestrian &quot;street of culture&quot; that Gunpo has designated as one of its eight scenic locations.

Gunpo was promoted from town to city in 1989 due to the rapid urban and industrial growth of Seoul, and large-scale housing projects were immediately begun. Hansei University, a Christian institute of post-secondary learning, is in the city, as are forty-four other public schools and a number of private academies. With eighty-three percent of its citizens holding public library memberships, Gunpo touts itself as a book-reading city, and it also promotes itself as being environmentally friendly and in harmony with nature. Its residents include 2010 Olympic figure skating gold medalist Yuna Kim, who grew up in Gunpo after moving there at the age of six. Sightseeing locations around the city include the Banwol reservoir and the Royal Azaleas Hill, and Surisan is a hiking destination.

==History==
===Early history===
During the Three Kingdoms era of the Korean Peninsula, the land that is now Gunpo was under the control of the Goguryeo dynasty, and it fell within Yulmok-gun (county) as of 475 CE. The area became Yuljin-gun under Unified Silla in the year 757, and in 940 it was renamed Gwaju-gun by the ruling Goryeo dynasty. The year 1413 saw the Joseon dynasty dub the area Gwacheon-hyeon.

In May 1895, the area containing present-day Gunpo became known as Nam-myeon, a division of Gwacheon-gun, but on 1 March 1914, a revision deemed that Nam-myeon now fell within Siheung-gun. Throughout the remainder of Japan&#x27;s annexation of Korea and the first several decades of South Korea, no changes were made to the designation of Nam-myeon or to its administrative districts, but a presidential decree had the area promoted on 1 May 1979, to Gunpo-eup (town), which yet remained within Siheung-gun.

Gunpo Station, a railway stop on South Korea&#x27;s nation-spanning Gyeongbu Line, was first opened in 1905, and it was joined by nearby Geumjeong Station in 1988. Geumjeong&#x27;s opening also saw Seoul Subway Lines 1 and 4 expand into the town—both Geumjeong and Gunpo Stations serve as metro stops on Seoul Subway Line 1, and Geumjeong is also a transfer station to Line 4.

===Promotion to city===

In 1989, the rapid industrial growth and urbanization of Seoul prompted the construction of five new cities in the Seoul Capital Area: Gunpo, Anyang, Seongnam, Bucheon, and Goyang. The move was based on a national law which was intended to promote efficient regional management in the face of an increasing demand for administration. Siheung-gun was thus disbanded, and Gunpo-eup was promoted to Gunpo-si (city). Five legal dongs (neighbourhoods) fell under Gunpo&#x27;s jurisdiction, although some were further sub-divided into numerous administrative dongs—for example, Sanbon-dong was split into Sanbon 1-dong and Sanbon 2-dong. At 20.70 km2, Gunpo maintained the smallest area of any city in South Korea.

A large-scale housing complex zone was established in February 1989 when Gunpo City designated the entirety of Sanbon-dong, Geumjeong-dong, and Dang-dong as an anticipated residential land district. In December 1992, Gunpo City Hall relocated from Dang-dong to Geumjong-dong, and Sanbon Station, on Seoul Subway Line 4, was also opened in 1992.

By 1994, there were ten administrative dongs in Gunpo but only five legal dongs. However, on 24 December of that year, four ris (villages) from neighbouring Banwol-myeon and Hwaseong-gun were incorporated into Gunpo due to the partial adjustment of administrative districts, and Gunpo&#x27;s area grew to 36.38 km2. The city currently has nine legal dongs, or eleven administrative ones. The acquisition of Daeyami-ri from Banwol-myeon brought Daeyami station, on Seoul Subway Line 4, into Gunpo&#x27;s city limits.

The development of Sanbon New Town was completed in 1995, and the area grew to become Gunpo&#x27;s central hub. Sanbon&#x27;s layout was devised by Kim Jinae, a famed Korean architect who also designed Seoul&#x27;s Insa-dong and who was named one of &quot;Time&quot; 100 leaders of the 21st century. In the year 2000, the new Revised Romanization of Korean formally changed the city&#x27;s romanized name from Kunp&#x27;o to Gunpo. 2003 brought the opening of Surisan Station between Daeyami and Sanbon, and in 2010, Dangjeong Station was opened on both Line 1 and the Gyeongbu Line, bringing the total number of metro stations in the city to six.

==Geography==
Gunpo is located in South Korea&#x27;s Gyeonggi Province, south of Seoul in the Seoul National Capital Area. It is nestled in between three other cities, bordering Anyang to the north, Uiwang to the east, and Ansan to the south and the west. At 36.38 km2, Gunpo makes up 0.36% of the province&#x27;s total area. As of 1 January 2004, 17.8% of the city was residential area, 1.8% commercial, 7.2% industrial, and 73.2% greenspace.
Gunpo is divided into nine legal dongs (neighborhoods). Four of those dongs—Sanbon-dong, Geumjeong-dong, Dang-dong, and Dangjeong-dong—are heavily urbanized residential, commercial, and industrial areas. Located in the northern end of Gunpo, they are serviced by Seoul Subway Lines 1 and 4. In the south of the city, Bugok-dong, Daeya-dong, and Domagyo-dong are largely rural, although Bugok-dong has seen recent urban development and Domagyo-dong has been earmarked for a development project of its own. Daeya-dong also contains a small urban area, which is serviced by Daeyami station. On Gunpo&#x27;s west side, Dundae-dong and Sokdal-dong contain large parts of the Surisan mountain and are mostly mountainous, with farmland comprising the majority of their valley areas. Surisan also extends into western Sanbon-dong.

Gunpo can alternatively be split into its eleven administrative dongs. Under this system, Sanbon 1-dong, Sanbon 2-dong, Gwangjeong-dong, Gungnae-dong, and Suri-dong replace the legal neighborhood of Sanbon-dong, while Geumjong-dong, Ogeum-dong, and Jaegung-dong fall within the borders of the legal Geumjeong-dong. The administrative neighborhoods of Gunpo 1-dong and Gunpo-2 dong replace the legal Dang-, Dangjeong-, and Bugok-dongs, while the administrative Daeya-dong covers the entirety of four legal dongs: Daeya-, Dundae-, Sokdal-, and Domagyo-dongs.

Gunpo falls at 126 degrees east longitude and thirty-seven degrees north latitude. A short distance from the Yellow Sea, it takes on certain features of an oceanic climate. Gunpo receives 1,284 mm of precipitation annually and has average January and August temperatures of −3.2 and 26 °C, respectively.

===Climate===
Gunpo has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm.
==Culture and sightseeing==
===Local culture===
Represented by the slogan &quot;With book,&quot; Gunpo promotes itself as a book-reading city. In the first quarter of 2014, seven of the city&#x27;s public libraries cooperated to report that 237,902 of Gunpo&#x27;s 286,485 citizens (approximately eighty-three percent) held library memberships. Bookcases stocked with children&#x27;s storybooks can be found throughout the city&#x27;s urban areas. Kim Yoon Joo, Gunpo&#x27;s mayor, has expressed his desire to promote the city for its reading culture and for its azaleas. Through its city logo and mascot, Gunpo also touts itself as a clean, creative, and environmental city in harmony with nature.

The central hub of Gunpo is Sanbon New Town, located near the base of Surisan. Immediately adjacent to Sanbon Station, the pedestrian &quot;street of culture&quot;—also known as Rodeo Street—is a bustling commercial district full of restaurants, bars, clothing boutiques, noraebangs, and other typical fixtures of a Korean city. Sanbon is home to a large population of foreign English teachers, many of whom are employed by Gunpo City Hall. Known to Koreans and expats alike until its 2015 closure was the &quot;Pirate bar,&quot; where beer was served in an ice glass that could be thrown at a target in an attempt to win a prize. Jon Ewart cried when the bar closed.

In the middle of Rodeo Street is a large fountain, nearby which a stage is often erected to host small concerts and other performances on weekends and during festivals. Beyond Rodeo Street, a larger downtown area stretches from Sanbon Station to Geumjeong Station and includes such locations as Sanbon Market and the Cherevil apartment towers. It is bordered to the east by the Anyangcheon (Anyang stream), a tributary of the Han River. In 2005, a city-funded water purification project resulted in several species of fish and birds returning to the stream.

===Tourism===

The night scene of Sanbon&#x27;s Rodeo Street has been designated by Gunpo as one of its eight famous scenic spots. Also among the eight are Taeeulbong Peak, a 489-meter peak of Surisan; and Surisa Temple, a traditional Jogye Buddhist temple also located on Surisan. Destroyed several times throughout its history, Surisa was most recently rebuilt in 1955, and was designated as Korea&#x27;s eighty-sixth traditional temple in 1988. Bambawi, also known as the chestnut rock, is a low-ridged mountain close to Sanbon New Town and another of the scenic locations.

Gunpo is home to two small lakes: the Galchi reservoir, located a short walk from Daeyami station, and the Banwol reservoir, accessible on foot from Ansan&#x27;s Banwol Station. The sunset over the latter is another of Gunpo&#x27;s eight famous scenic locations. Rounding out the list are the Dang Forest of the Deokgogae hill, near Daeyami, which won the grand prize at Korea&#x27;s third National Beautiful Forest Contest; the cherry blossom path of Gunpo, which decorates an area near Geumjeong Station every spring; and the Royal Azaleas Hill, which annually blooms with 90,000 purple azaleas not long after cherry blossom season.

Other sightseeing locations in Gunpo include the Nuri Astronomical observatory, located in Daeya-dong&#x27;s public library, several Buddhist temples, and the Anyang Benest Club, a private eighteen-hole golf course in Bugok-dong open only to members of the Anyang Country Club. Hiking Surisan is also a common activity among Gunpo&#x27;s residents. A number of festivals are held in the city throughout the year, including a Citizen&#x27;s Day Festival and a Royal Azaleas Festival. In 2014, Sanbon&#x27;s Rodeo Street hosted a Multicultural Food Festival in May and the Korean Reading Festival in September.

==Education==
Gunpo is home to forty-five public schools: twenty-five elementary, twelve middle, seven high, and one university. The latter is Hansei University, a Christian college that offers both undergraduate and graduate programs in various fields of study, including a Korean language institute for foreign students both in Korea and abroad. Founded in 1953 as the Full Gospel Theological College, the school later changed its name and was accredited as a university in 1993.

==Transportation==
The Gyeongbu Line, a major South Korean railway line, runs through Gunpo, making stops at Geumjeong, Gunpo, and Dangjeong stations, all three of which are also stops on Seoul Subway Line 1. Dangjeong Station services Hansei University and its surrounding downtown. Citizens of Bugok-dong&#x27;s primary residential and commercial area can easily access Uiwang station—one stop south of Dangjeong, the station falls within Uiwang&#x27;s city limits but straddles the Gunpo/Uiwang border. It is similarly a stop on both Seoul Subway Line 1 and the Gyeongbu Line.

Geumjeong Station is also a transfer station to Seoul Subway Line 4. Southwest of it on Line 4 is Sanbon station, which provides access to Sanbon New Town, as well as Surisan and Daeyami stations. On Line 4, a passenger can ride southwest into Ansan and Siheung before transferring to a train for Incheon, or northeast into Anyang, Gwacheon, and Seoul. Line 1 runs north into Anyang, Seoul, and several cities north of Seoul, or south into Uiwang, Suwon, and beyond.

Two major highways run east–west through Gunpo: the Seouloegwaksunhwan Expressway in the north, and the Yeongdong Expressway in the south. A number of local buses run frequently in Gunpo, some of which provide rapid service to other cities or to the Incheon International Airport. Buses and the Seoul Subway can both be ridden using Korea&#x27;s T-money metro card. Although there is no inter-city passenger bus terminal in Gunpo, both the Ansan Bus Terminal and the Anyang Bus Terminal are a short distance away. Bugok-dong does house a cargo bus terminal, but local residents banded together in 2003 to oppose its expansion, complaining of the traffic congestion and the air and noise pollution that it produced.

==Notable people==
Gunpo&#x27;s most famous resident is Yuna Kim, a 2010 Olympic champion and 2014 Olympic silver medalist in Ladies&#x27; singles figure skating. Born in Bucheon in 1990, Kim moved to Gunpo when she was six years old and later attended Suri High School. Widely regarded by Koreans as a hero and a national treasure, Kim was also cited as a hero by many of the younger figure skaters at the 2014 Winter Olympics and was named the 2010 sportswoman of the year by the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation.

Kim&#x27;s agency, All That Sports, formally asked Gunpo to halt the development of a &quot;Kim Yuna Street&quot; in 2011, and in 2012 distanced the skater from a controversial statue of her that the city was attempting to erect without her knowledge. The agency stated that she reserved a special place in her heart for Gunpo, &quot;a place where Kim grew up and nurtured her dream of becoming a figure skater,&quot; but it regretted allegations of corruption that had been leveled by a civic group at the statue&#x27;s design company.

Gunpo is also the birthplace of Kim Jisoo, a member of the K-Pop girl group Blackpink.

==Technology==
Intertek, a leading Total Quality Assurance provider to industries worldwide, officially opened its new office in Gunpo, South Korea on 18 May 2016. Mr. Kim Yoon-joo, Mayor of Gunpo, together with some 150 guests from Korea companies, attended the grand opening ceremony, marking an important milestone for Intertek Korea.

The new Intertek office in Gunpo spans five operational floors at the Intertek Building, offering a new, state-of-the-art 10-m electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) chamber with additional chambers for safety and EMC testing of electrical and wireless products. These new facilities strengthen Intertek&#x27;s leading position as a quality assurance provider in Korea delivering the full range of testing capabilities for both EU and US markets, covering safety, energy efficiency, chemical, EMC, and radio frequency testing.

<doc id="967697" wikidata="Q42064" url="?curid=967697" title="Gwacheon">
<text>Gwacheon (; ) is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. It lies close to Seoul in the heart of the Seoul National Capital Area, and also lies just east of Anyang. Seoul Subway Line 4 passes through the city.

Various attractions usually associated with Seoul, including Seoul Grand Park, National Museum of Contemporary Art, Seoul Land, Gwacheon National Science Museum, and Seoul Race Park are actually located in Gwacheon or its immediate jurisdiction. It is also home to a major administrative center of the Korean government.

==History==

===Early history===
In 475 CE, the land that would one day become Gwacheon was a part of Yulmok-gun, a county of the Korean Peninsula&#x27;s Goguryeo dynasty. Later, in 757, Unified Silla dubbed the area Yuljin-gun, a county of Hansan-ju, and the Goryeo dynasty renamed it Gwaju in 940. From 990 to 994, Gwaju was also known as &quot;Bulim&quot; and &quot;Buan&quot;. The year 1018 saw Goryeo christen the area Gwaju-hyeon, but the Joseon dynasty changed its name to Gwacheon-hyeon in 1413. Gwacheon-hyeon was a part of Gwangju-mok, Gyeonggi Province. Much larger than today&#x27;s Gwacheon-si, Gwacheon-hyeon included such territory as modern-day Gunpo.

May 26, 1895 saw Gwacheon-hyeon become Gwacheon-gun, and on March 1, 1914, Gwacheon- and Ansan-gun were annexed to nearby Siheung-gun. The area containing present-day Gwacheon was deemed Gwacheon-myeon, a division of Siheung-gun. Gwacheon-myeon was a large farming village just south of Seoul, as it had been for centuries, and its population had topped 6,000 by 1960.

In the 1970s, the South Korean government was considering moving its capital south, to a location farther from the border with North Korea as Seoul lies within the artillery range from any North Korean attacks. A complete relocation of the capital proved financially impossible, but a compromise was reached in 1975: move key government agencies several kilometers south of Seoul&#x27;s downtown, beyond the range of nearly all of North Korea&#x27;s artillery capability. Gwacheon-myeon, south of both Seoul and the protective Gwanaksan mountain range, was chosen as the site of this new administrative city in 1978, and a groundbreaking ceremony in Gwacheon was held in 1979.

===Administrative city===
Several government ministries were moved from Seoul to Gwacheon throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and residential districts were constructed to house the employees and their families. The nine million square meter Seoul Grand Park was opened in Gwacheon in 1984 as the new location of Seoul Zoo. Over the next four years, two amusement parks, a botanical garden, and the National Museum of Contemporary Art were also built on the property. On January 1, 1986, Gwacheon was officially elevated to Gwacheon-si (city), and three years later, Siheung-gun was completely disbanded when five other cities in the Seoul National Capital Area were created by the national government.

When Seoul won the right to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, it placed the Korean Racing Association in charge of constructing an Olympic Equestrian Park. 280 acres of land in Gwacheon were thus secured by the KRA, and construction began in 1984. Seoul Equestrian Park hosted several Olympic events in 1988, and after the conclusion of the games, the park was renamed Seoul Racecourse Park and converted into a horse racing facility. Gwacheon accordingly replaced Seoul&#x27;s Ttukseom area as the city&#x27;s horse racing hub, and the first race at the new location occurred on September 1, 1989.

Five stations on Seoul Metropolitan Subway&#x27;s Line 4 opened in Gwacheon on April 1, 1994. The line runs southwest through the city from Seoul into Anyang and includes Seonbawi Station, Seoul Racecourse Park Station, Seoul Grand Park Station, Gwacheon Station, and Government Complex Gwacheon Station.

In 2012, government offices in Gwacheon began relocating to Sejong City, a new administrative capital created by the Korean government in the middle of the country, around 150 kilometers south of Seoul. The move had adverse effects on Gwacheon&#x27;s local economy, with business such as restaurants and cafes losing considerable portions of their customer base. Fifty-four shops shut down at the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013, while others could no longer turn a profit and were forced to lay off employees. The national government hoped to counter the city&#x27;s economic crisis by moving fourteen new government agencies to Gwacheon.

==Characteristics==
Gwacheon intended to have a large importance on governmental construction. There is No.2 government building. So it keeps the position of planned city concerning politics in South Korea.
It has been serving as a second center of governmental complex which consists of city hall, welfare management offices, health care department, and many other sub departments of politics.

Seoul Grand Park and Gwanaksan occupy a large portion of the city. The presence of mountains and forests accentuate the status of Gwacheon as a destination for Korean nature lovers. In addition, the Seoul Race Park is also located in the city. Gwacheon has few historically preserved sites as well. Gwacheon Hyanggyo (Korean Confucianism institution built in 1389), YeonJudae (YeonJu Temple which is located at the end of cliff), three stepped pagoda of YeonJuAhm, and Portrait of HyoRyung Janggun (general HyoRyung) are listed as treasure of Gyeonggi-do (Gyeonggi Province) and map of Joseon (Old Korean Kingdom) located in History Ministry inside the governmental complex is listed as one of Korean national treasure. In history of Korea, Gwacheon has not only been known for its landscape but also as important center of education and religious practices by Kings.

The first foreign-language high school established in Gyeonggi-do, Gwacheon Foreign Language High School is located in Jongang-dong. Gwacheon has the Science and Technology Center and one of the biggest public libraries of Gyeonggi-do.

==Climate==
Gwacheon has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm.
==Notable people==
Gwacheon&#x27;s notable former residents include:

* Jin, a singer and member of K-pop group BTS
* Dennis Hwang, a graphic artist who spent much of his childhood in Gwacheon
* Lee Hoe-taek (Hui), a singer and member of K-pop group Pentagon born in Gwacheon
* Lee Soo-hyuk, a model and actor born in Gwacheon.
* Anton Hur, a writer and translator whose hometown is Gwacheon.

==Home stay==
Gwacheon operates a home stay program for foreigners. The city sponsors this program and residents of the city host foreigners living in Korea who want to spend a night in a traditional Korean home. The program helps foreigners understand Korean culture and lifestyle.

<text>Gwangmyeong (; ) is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. It borders Seoul to the east, north and northeast, Anyang to the southeast, Siheung to the southwest, and Bucheon to the northwest. It is home to one of the world&#x27;s largest IKEA stores at 59,000 square meters (640,000 square feet), along with a large Costco store and a Lotte Premium Outlet.

== History ==
Gwangmyeong area was part of the old (or original) Siheung County as with Yeongdeungpo, Guro, and Geumcheon areas. It belonged to West (, seo-myeon) and South townships () of original Siheung County. In 1914, the two townships were merged into West township of &quot;expanded&quot; Siheung County.

In 1963, the northern part of Gwangmyeong (at that time, the northern part of West Township in Siheung County) area was merged into an expanded Seoul (i.e. districts for urban planning in Seoul. ) as with Gwacheon (at that time Gwacheon was a township in Siheung County) and Sindo township of Goyang County (now parts of the city Goyang, which borders Seoul). The neighbourhood of Gwangmyeong (Gwangmyeong-dong) and Cheolsan (Cheolsan-dong) were developed as a residence zone next to Seoul and it was provisionally planned to be administratively merged with Seoul. In 1974, Gwangmyeong-ri and Cheolsan-ri became a part of the county branch of Gwangmyeong ( gwang-myeong-chul-jang-so) and in 1979 southern part of Gwangmyeong area became Soha town ( so-ha-eub). In 1981, the annexation to Seoul foundered as Seoul&#x27;s unexpected rapid growth greatly concerned government officials. Consequently, the county branch of Gwangmyeong and Soha town merged and formed a new city of Gwangmyeong, instead of being annexed to Guro District, Seoul.

In the 1980s and the early 1990s, many apartment complexes were built in Cheolsan-dong and Haan-dong. The population increased up to 300,000. In 1995, the Seoul-Gwangmyeong boundary was readjusted, in which a tiny part of Cheolsan-dong was merged into the newly created Geumcheon District, Seoul. In 2004, Gwangmyeong Station was open, and in 2010, apartment complexes in Soha-dong were built up.

== Districts ==

There are 18 administrative districts (&quot;dong&quot; in Korean language) in Gwangmyeong. Specifically, these are: Gwangmyeong Dong (from 1-7; Gwangmyeong 6-dong is also known as Okgil dong), Cheolsan Dong (4 dongs), Ha-an Dong (4 dongs), Soha Dong (2 dongs; The southern part of Soha 2-dong is also known as Iljik dong), and Hak-on dong (Gahak-dong and No-onsa dong). In 1995, a tiny section of Gwangmyeong was ceded to Seoul&#x27;s newly created Geumcheon District.

== Disputes on municipal annexation to Seoul ==

Due to its history of being part of the urban planning districts of Seoul until December 1982, the living sphere of Gwangmyeong is similar to Seoul&#x27;s Yeongdeungpo ( seo-ul yeong-deung-po saeng-hwal-kwon) rather than &#x27;Western Gyeonggi&#x27;s living sphere&#x27; ( gyeong-gi seo-bu-saeng-hwal-kwon) such as Bucheon and Anyang. The sewage system is linked to Seoul, though the nearest sewage treatment plant is located on the boundary between Gwangmyeong and Anyang, and the city heavily relies on Seoul&#x27;s telephone and transport systems (local dial code. The phone area code for Gwangmyeong is Seoul&#x27;s 02 and many Seoul buses and taxis are in business in that city); advertisements of firms in Yeongdeungpo area can be easily seen in the city. Gwangmyeong not belonging to Seoul, Gwangmyeong residents have to go to a district court office and a reserve soldier&#x27;s drill camp (of the 51st Infantry Division, Capital Corps) in &#x27;farther&#x27; Ansan other than a district court in nearby Sinjeong-dong and a reserve soldier&#x27;s drill camp (of the 52nd Infantry Division, CDC) in Anyang.

Proponents of the incorporation in Seoul argue that by annexing the city into capital Seoul, in which Gwangmyeong City of Gyeonggi Province becomes Gwangmyeong District of Seoul, the discord between a life zone and administrative districts, in terms of metropolitan governance, can be resolved. They also insist that by the annexation, residents in Gwangmyeong can benefit from metropolitan services and governance of Seoul Metropolitan City, especially in public transport. Congressman and former mayor of Gwangmyeong Baek Jae-hyeon presented a special bill for &quot;municipal annexation to Seoul for Gwangmyeong&quot; on the floor in September 2009, though his attempt turned out in vain at last. Opponents insist that the annexation would tarnish municipal autonomy in Gwangmyeong and it would also worsen balanced development of non-capital areas on the national level. The central government once proposed that Gwangmyeong be merged with Bucheon other than being annexed to Seoul.

== Education ==
There are nine high schools, ten middle schools, and 21 elementary schools in Gwangmyeong. Prior to 2013, middle school students who wished to go to high school had to take the entrance exam. Gwangmyeong-buk High School and Jinseong High School are traditionally well known for higher standards of students&#x27; academic ability.

== Residential areas ==
Since Gwangmyeong is a commuter town bordering Seoul, it&#x27;s mostly a residential area. The northwestern part of Gwangmyeong, namely Gwangmyeong-dong, is mostly composed of low-storeyed detached houses, while the eastern part, namely Cheolsan-dong and Haan-dong, consists of high-storeyed apartment complexes. Throughout the late 2000s, old public low-storeyed apartment complexes (저층 주공아파트 jeo-cheng ju-gong-ah-pa-teu) in Cheolsan-dong were rebuilt into private high-storeyed apartment complexes (고층 민간아파트 go-cheng min-gan-ah-pa-teu). In 2010, some parts of Soha-dong was developed to newly built public apartment complexes.

A large Korean-style traditional market, Gwangmyeong Market, is located in the Gwangmyeong crossroads with Gwangmyeongsageori Station. Modern shopping malls are in Cheolsan Station, Haan crossroads, and Soha-dong (E-mart and Costco). Gwangmyeong residents can also use shopping malls (Lotte Mart and Homeplus) in nearby Guro District and Geumcheon District. Clothes outlets are located in nearby Gasan-dong in Seoul.

<text>Conrad Phillip Kottak (born October 6, 1942, in Atlanta, Georgia) is an American anthropologist. Kottak is currently a professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Michigan, where he has been teaching since 1968. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University, and he did extensive research in Brazil and Madagascar, visiting societies there and writing books about them.

He then wrote several textbooks, including &quot;Window on Humanity: A Concise Introduction to Anthropology&quot;; &quot;Madagascar: Society and History&quot;, and &quot;Anthropology: The Exploration of Human Diversity&quot; and &quot;Cultural Anthropology&quot;, which are often used by colleges and high schools in the United States. He believes that various American legends and stories, such as &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and the Thanksgiving story are growing into a type of mythology which someday might be comparable to Greek, Roman, or other stories which today are considered to be myths.

Kottak has received several honors for his work. Among these awards is an excellence in teaching award by the College of Literature, Sciences, and the Arts of the University of Michigan in 1992, and the American Anthropological Association (AAA)/Mayfield Award for Excellence in the Undergraduate Teaching of Anthropology in 1999. He was elected to the membership of the National Academy of Sciences in 2008. According to the Open Syllabus Project, Kottak is the most frequently cited author on college syllabi for anthropology courses.

<text>The long-toed skink (Oligosoma longipes) is a species of skink of the family Scincidae, endemic to New Zealand. It was first described by Geoff Patterson in 1997. It is only known from a few sites in the South Island of New Zealand and little is known of its habits. It seems to prefer dry, rocky habitats, usually eroding stream terraces or scree slopes. It is diurnal and heliothermic. Maximum snout-vent length is about 70 mm.

==Conservation status==
As of 2012 the Department of Conservation (DOC) classified the long-toed skink as Nationally Vulnerable under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

<doc id="967721" wikidata="Q1518770" url="?curid=967721" title="Summer School (1987 film)">
<text>Summer School is a 1987 American comedy film directed by Carl Reiner and starring Mark Harmon as a high school gym teacher who is forced to teach a remedial English class during the summer. The film co-stars Kirstie Alley and Courtney Thorne-Smith. It was distributed by Paramount Pictures and produced by George Shapiro and Howard West. The original music score was composed by Danny Elfman.

==Plot==
At a Los Angeles area beach city high school, on the last day of school before summer vacation, physical education teacher Freddy Shoop is preparing for a vacation to Hawaii with his girlfriend, Kim. Vice principal Phil Gills hands out paper slips informing several underachievers that they must attend summer school for remedial English. Among the students are easily distracted Pam House; &quot;nocturnal&quot; Larry Kazamias, a male stripper; football jock Kevin Winchester; pregnant Rhonda Altobello; geeky Alan Eakian; dyslexic Denise Green; intimidating Jerome Watkins; and two horror film-obsessed underachievers, Dave Frazier and Francis Gremp, a.k.a. &quot;Chainsaw&quot;.

The teacher scheduled to lead the class, Mr. Dearadorian, unexpectedly wins the lottery and immediately quits, so Gills seeks an emergency replacement among the teachers still on school grounds. Each manages to evade him, quickly figuring out what he wants them to do, until he finally corners Shoop, blackmailing him into taking the job or lose tenure. Kim insists to go by herself to Hawaii despite Shoop&#x27;s pleas for her to stay.

On his first day, Shoop meets Robin Bishop, who is teaching American History next door. He falls for her, but she is already dating Gills. His first day is a disaster. Most of the students slack around, and Jerome goes to the bathroom and doesn&#x27;t return. A beautiful Italian transfer student, Anna-Maria, is transferred to the class in order for her to work on her English, much to the delight of Dave and Chainsaw. After some students inexplicably leave and the remaining ones attempt to leave class as well, Shoop admits he has no idea how to teach them. Rather than studying, he and the students spend their first few days having fun going to the beach, a theme park, and a petting zoo until Alan&#x27;s grandmother finds out when he gets an allergy and tells Gills.

Gills threatens to fire Shoop unless his students pass the end-of-term test. With Alan&#x27;s suggestion, Shoop negotiates with each teen to grant them a favor if they study. The kids agree, so he gives Denise driving lessons, accompanies Rhonda to Lamaze classes, gives Kevin football lessons, allows Dave and Chainsaw to throw a party in his house and gives them rides to school, gives Larry a bed in the classroom, lets Chainsaw arrange a screening of &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; in class and allows Pam to move in with him. Seeing he is still floundering as a teacher, Robin tells Shoop to make learning fun. He begins to grow closer to the kids. They study to pass their English basic skills exam, worried that Gills will fire him unless all his students pass.

Shoop is arrested, covering for Chainsaw and Dave after they are found in possession of alcohol. He desperately calls Robin and she and Gills bail him out of jail. Gills then inadvertently exposes his true self to Robin when he reiterates his dislike of Shoop and his students and she overhears, causing her to storm off. Larry loses his stripper job when he is found out by his aunt and his mother, who go to the club where he works.

The students make more demands on Shoop after he tells them they need to take a test so he throws an English book against the chalkboard and, after listing his sacrifices to grant their favors, quits his job in anger. His students start feeling guilty, and scare off Shoop&#x27;s dull replacement with a scene reminiscent of &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;. Finding Shoop moping on the beach whilst eating ice cream, they ask him to return, and he accepts.

Shoop and his students then begin preparing for the test in earnest, and even Jerome, who had &quot;gone to the bathroom&quot; weeks before, returns. The exam goes smoothly, despite Rhonda going into labor during the test; she later puts the child up for adoption. Gills tells Shoop the average of grades was below passing, 
indicating failure, so he is ready to fire him. However, the students&#x27; parents come to defend him. Due to each of the students&#x27; marked improvement, Principal Kelban grants Shoop tenure for his positive efforts despite Gills&#x27; objections.

Shoop returns to the beach with his dog and Robin. He asks her to a dinner date for the last time, and she accepts at last, kissing him in the sunset.

==Soundtrack==
The &quot;Summer School&quot; soundtrack, on Chrysalis, consists of 1980s rock and dance songs with performers including Paul Engemann, Blondie, E. G. Daily, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Vinnie Vincent, Billy Burnette, and Elisa Fiorillo.

Some songs that appear in the film, including James Brown&#x27;s, &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot; and Eddie Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Party All the Time&quot;, do not appear on the soundtrack. The movie is also notable for containing the only completely unreleased Danny Elfman film score to date.

Daily&#x27;s &quot;Mind over Matter&quot; was released as a single off the soundtrack. It became a top 10 dance hit in the US and hit #96 in the UK in 1988. The song was originally recorded by Debbie Harry, but label disputes caused her recording to go unreleased and Daily was chosen to sing it instead. The song was produced at PWL by Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman.

==Reception==
 Metacritic gave the film a score of 27 based on 9 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film ½ out of four stars, calling it &quot;listless, leisurely and unspirited&quot;.

The film grossed $35.7 million in the United States, becoming the 32nd highest-grossing film of 1987.

==Home media==
A bare-bones DVD edition of &quot;Summer School&quot; was released by Paramount Home Entertainment in 2004. This was followed by a special edition DVD, known as the &quot;Life&#x27;s a Beach Edition&quot;, which was released on May 22, 2007.

Shout Factory released a Blu-ray, including the 2007 bonus features and adding a discussion with Richard Steven Horvitz, on Feb 8, 2022.

==Remake==
Along with the special edition DVD release commemorating the twentieth anniversary of &quot;Summer School&quot;, many of the original cast were present for a reunion party. During an audience Q&amp;A, Dean Cameron suggested that he would be open to a sequel or possibly even a remake of the original. When asked who he would cast as Chainsaw, he suggested Shia LaBeouf or Zach Braff.

In early 2012, Adam Sandler&#x27;s production company Happy Madison Productions signed on for a remake.

<doc id="967725" wikidata="Q457832" url="?curid=967725" title="Stoner film">
<text>Stoner film is a subgenre of comedy film based on marijuana themes, where recreational use often drives the plot, sometimes representing cannabis culture more broadly or intended for that audience. 

== Genre ==

The midnight movie scene in theaters of the 1970s revived the hectoring anti-drug propaganda film &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; (1936) as an ironic counterculture comedy. The broad popularity of &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; led to a new audience for extreme anti-drug films bordering on self-parody, including &quot;Assassin of Youth&quot; (1937), &quot;Marihuana&quot; (1936), and &quot;She Shoulda Said No!&quot; a.k.a. &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Weed&quot; (1949). 

The duo Cheech &amp; Chong established the archetypal &quot;stoner&quot; comedy throughout the 1970s, taking their antics to the big screen for &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; in 1978, establishing the contemporary stoner film genre.

&quot;High Times&quot; magazine, founded in 1974, began sponsoring the first Stony Awards in 2000, celebrating stoner films and television, recognizing a broad scope of noteworthy cannabis media.

The enduring influence of &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; led to a musical comedy remake in 2005.

== Common elements ==
Many stoner movies have certain elements and themes in common. The template involves protagonists who have marijuana, are attempting to find marijuana, or have some other task to complete. The protagonists are often two friends in a variation of the buddy film.

Stoner films often involve evading authority figures who disapprove of the protagonists&#x27; marijuana usage, usually out of a greater lack of acceptance of their lifestyle of leisure and innocence. Authority figures are often law-enforcement agents, who are portrayed as comically inept, as well as parents, co-workers, friends, and security guards. Most serious moments in stoner films are intended ironically, often to parody overwrought counterparts in mainstream cinema. The comic story arcs often approach or fall over the line into slapstick.

<text>Horseshoe Bend National Military Park is a 2,040-acre, U.S. national military park managed by the National Park Service that is the site of the penultimate battle of the Creek War on March 27, 1814.

The military park is located in Tallapoosa County, Alabama. Although New Site is the closest municipality, the park uses a mailing address based in Daviston.

General Andrew Jackson&#x27;s Tennessee militia, aided by the 39th U.S. Infantry Regiment and Cherokee and Lower Creek allies, won a decisive victory against the Upper Creek Red Stick Nation during the Battle of Horseshoe Bend at this site on the Tallapoosa River. Jackson&#x27;s decisive victory at Horseshoe Bend broke the power of the Creek Nation.

Over 800 Upper Creeks died defending their homeland. This was the largest loss of life for Native Americans in a single battle in the history of United States.

On August 9, 1814, the Creeks signed the Treaty of Fort Jackson, which ceded 23 million acres (93,000 km2) of land in Alabama and Georgia to the United States government.

<text>Pyeongtaek (; ) is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. Located in the southwestern part of the province, Pyeongtaek was founded as a union of two districts in 1940. It was elevated to city status in 1986 and is home to a South Korean naval base and a large concentration of United States troops.

==Military base==
The South Korean and United States governments came to an agreement to enlarge Camp Humphreys—a U.S. Army installation outside Anjeong-ri, a community in Pyeongtaek—and move the majority of US forces stationed in and north of Seoul to the Camp Humphreys area. Invoking eminent domain, the government obtained the surrounding land for the base expansion. This would result in the community&#x27;s third displacement from their own land since the Japanese occupation during World War II.

The move originally included the headquarters of the ROK/US Combined Forces Command, which has operational control of South Korean, U.S., and U.N. combined forces during wartime. In March 2007, ROK Minister of Defense Kim Jang-soo and U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates agreed to dissolve the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command on April 17, 2012. This would allow ROK forces to have wartime control of its military during a military confrontation with the North. The ROK/US agreement allows USFK to move to one centralized location away from the congestion of Seoul and its surrounding areas. This relocation agreement results in returning two-thirds of the land currently used by the United States Military back to the South Korean government. By 2008, the U.S. military was to have consolidated 41 installations down to 10 due to the relocation agreement. USFK&#x27;s only jail facility in South Korea is at Camp Humphreys.
Osan Air Base is in Songtan, a district in Pyeongtaek.

===South African War Memorial===
The Korean War Monument of the South African Air Force was opened on 29 September 1975 by the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Korea in memory of the 37 South African Air Force members who served during the Korean War.

==Education==

* Hankwang High School
* Pyeongtaek University ().
* Pyeongtaek International Christian School ().

==Climate==
Pyeongtaek has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm. 

With its low average elevation, Pyeongtaek has the warmest January average temperature in Gyeonggi Province at -4.5°C, and the hottest average temperature in August at 26.4°C. The annual average precipitation is 1,100 mm, with an average of 283.4 mm in July and 207.3 mm in August, the lowest in the province. This is due to the relatively low occurrence of orographic rainfall compared to other regions.

Youth Planning Training&quot; program in which teenagers plan and prepare schedules for their chosen countries by forming teams on their own and then go abroad for research training; then there is the &quot;Siheung Dream Tree, To the world! Overseas Visit Experience&quot; program in which children receive prior education through various subjects such as culture and art, history and embark on field trips.

Lastly, Siheung has a &#x27;sister school&#x27; project, aiming to expand international exchange activities by supporting a partnership project between a school in Siheung and a foreign school.

<text>Uijeongbu (; ) is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea.

==History==
==Overview==
Uijeongbu is located north of the South Korean capital Seoul; it lies inside a defile, with mountains on two sides, and commands a natural choke point across the main traditional invasion route from the North into Seoul. As such it has a continued military significance and it contains U.S. and South Korean military bases, positioned for the defense of the South Korean capital. The U.S. Second Infantry Division has established a headquarters post in Uijeongbu, with the main troops being deployed from Dongducheon. U.S. military bases in Uijeongbu have since closed.

Despite being known for its military presence, the area has boomed into a satellite community of Seoul with shops, cinemas, restaurants and bars, internet cafes, and DVD bangs. In addition to U.S. personnel, it is popular with the English hagwon (a for-profit private institute, academy or cram school). There are several mountains such as Mt. Dobong (Dobongsan), Mt. Surak and Mt. Soyo. The mountains are popular recreational areas for hiking and are frequented by residents living in the Seoul Metropolitan area.

This city is also famous for its budae-jjigae (lit. &quot;army base stew&quot;), made with hot dogs and SPAM. In the late 20th century, many wanted the dish to be referred as &quot;Uijeongbu jjigae&quot; to remove the military or war-time connotations it had associated with it. However, not many restaurants followed this guideline. Some restaurants have begun calling their product &quot;Uijeongbu budae jjigae.&quot; The city also contains what locals refer to as &quot;buddaejjigae street&quot;, a street where there is a high concentration of army base stew restaurants.

==Transport==

A VAL driverless metro system, U Line, is an elevated line, long, covering 15 stations. It had its grand opening on 26 June 2012 with normal passenger operations on 1 July 2012.

Uijeongbu is also served by the Seoul Metropolitan Subway&#x27;s Line 1 and Line 7. The six stations within the city boundaries are Nogyang, Ganeung, Uijeongbu, Hoeryong, Mangwolsa, and Jangam. It takes around 40 minutes to reach Uijeongbu from central Seoul by subway.

Extensive bus routes cover north-eastern Gyeonggi Province. There are three basic kinds: &quot;ilban bus&quot;, normal bus; &quot;jwaseok bus&quot;, larger and slightly more expensive; and &quot;maeul bus&quot;, &quot;village bus&quot;, a smaller bus with fewer seats. An intercity bus station is available for longer distances. Airport &quot;limousine buses&quot; run frequently to both Incheon and Gimpo airports.

==Education==
The South Korean educational system, regarded as one of the most difficult in the world, officially incorporates Primary or Elementary, Middle, Secondary, Vocational and Tertiary levels. Anything below primary school is not required. Uijeongbu is home to several educational establishments, most of which are available to both South Korean citizens and foreign nationals. Some schools, however, are only accessible to the families and other affiliates of the US Army. The schools in Uijeongbu range from the standard Korean high school, such as Gyeonggi High School, to the Americanized, International Christian School which lies in the northern part of the city, close to Nogyang Station.
Earlier forms of education, such as kindergarten, are not compulsory in South Korea and young children traditionally remain with the family as long as possible, but many are still available. One such establishment is the privately run kindergarten, Yebbeun Kindergarten or Pretty Kindergarten () which is located near Saemal Station.
From the age of six, school children in Uijeongbu, like most of South Korea, begin attending elementary school. There are several elementary schools throughout Uijeongbu, such as Yonghyun primary school (), or , and Vocational Elementary school, so a wide variety is provided. 
The next stage of schooling begins around the age of thirteen and is a part of middle school education. Uijeongbu has a few middle schools, such as Solmoe Middle School (), located in the southeastern part of the city, right off Route 43. The high school or secondary level of education is widely available in Uijeongbu as well. With high schools like the aforementioned Gyeonggi High School, or Uijeongbu High School which is known for its unusual graduation &quot;dress up&quot; ritual. There is an apparent lack of vocational high schools or those that focus on specialized curricula, such as fishery or economics.
However, there are several higher education options at the tertiary level available in Uijeongbu. One such school is the Shinhan University, which has an extensive array of choices for majors ranging from culinary to nursing. Uijeongbu is also the site of Kyungmin College, which prepares teachers.

<doc id="967736" wikidata="Q5631923" url="?curid=967736" title="HMS Colossus (1882)">
<text>The fourth HMS &quot;Colossus&quot; was a &quot;Colossus&quot; class second-class British battleship, launched in 1882 and commissioned in 1886. She had a displacement of 9,520 tons, and an armament of 4 × 12-inch breechloaders, 5 × 6-inch guns and had a respectable speed of 15.5 knots.

She was one of the first, if not the first, modern battleship. She had several features which would be standard for all gun warships up to the Second World War including all steel construction, a main battery of breech loading major caliber guns (ie. 10 inches or greater) mounted in turrets and was propelled only by steam engines instead of a combination of steam and sails - as was common in the mid-19th century.

==Design==
The design for the &quot;Colossus&quot; class was based on the earlier of turret ships, but with numerous improvements. They were larger, slightly faster, and had improved handling characteristics and significantly more powerful armament. Instead of older muzzle-loading guns, &quot;Colossus&quot; reintroduced breech-loading guns to Royal Navy service, along with a secondary battery, a feature not included in older ironclads. The new ship also incorporated compound armour instead of the traditional wrought iron armour used in earlier vessels. In addition, the ship&#x27;s hull was constructed with steel, not iron.

&quot;Colossus&quot; was long between perpendiculars and had a beam of and a draught of . She displaced . The ship had a long, raised fore and sterncastle connected by a hurricane deck. The superstructure consisted of a small conning tower atop the forecastle. She had a crew of 396 officers and ratings. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder marine steam engines powered by ten coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which were vented through a single large funnel located amidships. Her engines provided a top speed of at . When steaming at full speed, the ship had a cruising range of .

The ship was armed with a main battery of four BL breech-loading guns in twin-gun turrets, which were placed &quot;en echelon&quot; amidships, fore and aft of the funnel. &quot;Colossus&quot; also carried a secondary battery of five BL breech-loading guns. These were carried in individual pivot mounts, one on either side of the forward superstructure, another pair abreast the aft superstructure, and the final gun on the upper deck at the stern. She also carried four QF 6-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she was equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes.

&quot;Colossus&quot;″s armoured citadel was thick on the sides and reduced to on its rounded bulkheads, where it was intended to deflect incoming projectiles. It was long, slightly more than a third of the ship&#x27;s length, and covered the ship&#x27;s ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. She carried a protective deck that was thick and sloped downward at the sides. Above and below the deck, coal storage spaces were arranged to provide additional defence against gunfire. The main battery turrets had 14 to 16 in of armour plate, and the conning tower had 14 in sides.

==Service history==
&quot;Colossus&quot; was laid down at the Portsmouth Royal Dockyard on 6 June 1879. She was launched on 21 March 1882 and was completed, apart from her armament, in 1883, allowing her to conduct sea trials later that year and into 1884. These included speed tests in January 1884 and extensive shooting tests in July 1885. Delays with the delivery of her guns prevented her from being completed for active service until 31 October 1886. At that time, she joined the new armoured cruiser for a training cruise that included a stop in Vigo, Spain. During the voyage, &quot;Colossus&quot; rolled severely in bad weather and took on water through the gun ports in her turrets, while &quot;Imperieuse&quot; was not similarly affected. She was then assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, serving there until 1893. At that time, she was reduced to a coastguard ship, based in Holyhead. &quot;Colossus&quot; participated in the fleet manoeuvres in August 1894, serving as part of the &quot;Blue&quot; fleet commanded by Rear Admiral Edward Seymour. She was assigned to Group 1 of the fleet, which also included her sister ship , the recently completed pre-dreadnought battleship , and the ironclads , , and , and the protected cruiser . The exercises lasted around 36 hours before the results were decided in favour of &quot;Blue&quot; fleet. During the manoeuvres, &quot;Colossus&quot; was judged to have been disabled by coastal artillery at Belfast.

In August 1895, &quot;Colossus&quot; was again reactivated to take part in the annual fleet manoeuvres as part of the Reserve Fleet. At that time, the capital ships assigned to the fleet included &quot;Edinburg&quot;, &quot;Alexandra&quot;, &quot;Benbow&quot;, and the ironclad . The ships were mobilised at Torbay in early August, went to sea on the 8th, and carried out various training exercises, including shooting practice and tactical manoeuvres, before returning to port on 20 August. During the 1896 fleet manoeuvres, &quot;Colossus&quot;, &quot;Edinburgh&quot;, &quot;Alexandra&quot;, and &quot;Benbow&quot; were joined by the old ironclad in Fleet C, one of four organized for the exercises. Fleet C operated in concert with Fleet D, again commanded by Seymour. He was given the objective to combine his fleets and either defeat the strong A and B fleets in detail or to reach the fortified port of Lough Swilly. The ships went to sea on 24 July and by the morning of 30 July, Seymour had succeeded in uniting his fleets but failed to bring Fleet A to battle, and therefore took his ships to Lough Swilly.

Captain Samuel Arthur Johnson was in command from March 1897 to March 1900, and at that point, she was still serving as a coastguard ship at Holyhead. During this period, on 26 June 1897, &quot;Colossus&quot; was present for the fleet review held for Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. The ship once again participated in the fleet manoeuvres in 1897; that year, the Reserve Fleet was divided into two divisions for its own exercises apart from the active Channel Fleet. &quot;Colossus&quot; was assigned to the 1st Division, along with &quot;Alexandra&quot;, &quot;Benbow&quot;, , , and . The exercises lasted from 7 to 11 July. The Royal Navy did not hold large scale manoeuvres in 1898. &quot;Colossus&quot; participated in the 1899 fleet exercises, which lasted from 29 July to 5 August, and saw the ships of the Reserve Fleet attempt to protect a convoy from attacks by a faster but numerically inferior Channel Fleet. Neither fleet encountered each other during the exercises, as visibility was limited by heavy fog. Captain James Goodrich succeeded in command from March 1900. She was paid off in November 1901 and placed in the reserve, her captain and crew transferred to which took over as guardship at Holyhead. Commander Rowland Nugent was appointed in command of the ship on 25 February 1902, and from August she had a refit at the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company. The ship returned to service in 1904 as a tender to the training establishment . She served in this capacity for only a short time, and was sold to shipbreakers in 1908.

<doc id="967738" wikidata="Q42134" url="?curid=967738" title="Uiwang">
<text>Uiwang (; ) is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. It is one of many satellite cities that ring Seoul, making up the Seoul Capital Area. Its largest immediate urban neighbor is Anyang. The low peaks of the Gwangju Mountains (including Moraksan) shape the local landscape.

Rail transportation is important in Uiwang, which is home to the Korean Railroad Museum and Korea National Railroad College. Seoul Subway Line 1 passes through the city, as does the Gyeongbu Line. In addition, a terminal of Hanjin container shipping is located here.

==Geography==
Uiwang lies just south of Seoul. It is bounded to the east by Baegunsan (), Barasan (), the lower slopes of Cheonggyesan (), and Maebongsan (); to the south by the city of Suwon, to the west by Ansan, Gunpo, and Anyang; and to the north by Gwacheon.

There are two noteworthy reservoirs in the city: Baegun Lake () at the foot of Baegunsan, and Wangsong Lake (), by the border with Suwon. Baegun Lake has a number of foreign restaurants, while Wangsong Lake, accessible from Uiwang Station, has a recreational draisine, the Korean Railroad Museum, and Uiwang&#x27;s Nature Education Park. The source of the Anyangcheon - a tributary of the Han River - is in Uiwang, as is the source of the Haguicheon, itself a tributary of the Anyangcheon. Most of Uiwang is thus drained northwards. However, the Hwanggujicheon&#x27;s source is also in Uiwang, and this flows south, eventually emptying into the Yellow Sea at Asan Bay.

==History==

* 1 April 1914: Gwangju-gun&#x27;s Uigok-myeon () and Wangnyun-myeon () were combined and transferred to Suwon-gun, which renamed it Uiwang-myeon ().
* 1 October 1936: Ilhyeong-myeon () was incorporated into Uiwang-myeon.
* 14 August 1949: The district was transferred to Hwaseong-gun, and was renamed Ilwang-myeon ().
* 1 January 1963: Ilhyeong-myeon was transferred to Suwon City, while the remainder became Uiwang-myeon, now in Siheung-gun..
* 1 December 1980: Uiwang-myeon became Uiwang-eup.
* 15 February 1983: Woram-ri () and Chopyeong-ri (), formerly in Hwaseong-gun&#x27;s Banwol-myeon (), were transferred to Uiwang-eup.
* 1 March 1983: Naeson-ri (), Poil-ri (), Cheonggye-ri (), and Hagui-ri () were put under the jurisdiction of Uiwang-eup&#x27;s Eastern Branch Office.
* 1 January 1989: Uiwang separated from Siheung-gun, forming its own city.
* 20 February 2007: The Chinese characters used in the name of Uiwang were changed from to .

In recent times, Uiwang has developed considerably thanks to the expansion of Anyang. Several districts are also directly connected with Gunpo and Suwon.

==Administrative districts==
There are six administrative districts:
==Climate==
Uiwang has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm.

===Rail===
The Gyeongbu Line passes through Uiwang, with Seoul Subway Line 1 stopping at Uiwang Station. Cargo trains also deliver to Obong Station.

===Road===
The Seoul Ring Expressway, Yeongdong Expressway, National Road 1, and the Gwacheon-Bongdam Highway (309) pass through Uiwang.

==Education==
===Higher education===
Uiwang is home to the Uiwang Campus of the Korea National University of Transportation, and Kaywon University of Art and Design.

===Further education===
There are five high schools in the city: Gyeonggi Foreign Language High School, Uiwang High School, Baegun High School, Useong High School, and Morak High School.

===Secondary education===
Uiwang houses seven middle schools: Baegun Middle School, Gocheon Middle School, Uiwang Middle School, Uiwang Bugok Middle School, Galmoe Middle School, Morak Middle School, and Deokjang Middle School.

===Primary education===
There are twelve elementary schools in Uiwang: Uiwang Elementary School, Gocheon Elementary School, Galmoe Elementary School, Uiwang Bugok Elementary School, Wanggok Elementary School, Uiwang Deokseong Elementary School, Deokjang Elementary School, Ojeon Elementary School, Baegun Elementary School, Naeson Elementary School, Morak Elementary School, and Naedong Elementary School.

==Government==
City Hall, the central library, seniors&#x27; social center, health center, and youth centers are all located in Gocheon-dong.

Korea Correctional Service operates the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang.

==Industry==
There are many large corporations, such as Haitai confectionaries, Cheil Industries, Hyundai Rotem, and various trade and logistics companies in Uiwang.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Uiwang is twinned with:
* North Little Rock, Arkansas, United States (2000)
* Kimitsu, Chiba, Japan (2002)

<text>Yangju (; ) is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. Yangju is located south of Dongducheon and north of Uijeongbu, not far from Seoul.

In the past, it was one region with Uijeongbu-si, Guri-si, Namyangju-si, Dongducheon-si, and some parts of Seoul, so the county office was located in Uijeongbu, which was the largest town in Yangju at the time and the center of all of Yangju, including the current Guri and Namyangju. Even after the separation of Uijeongbu-si in 1963, the county office remained in Uijeongbu city, and it was not until 2000 that it ended its life as Uijeongbu and moved to its current location near the site of the Yangju Mok government office, and when it was promoted to Yangju-si in 2003, it was given the title of city hall.

== History ==
* 1395 - Renamed to Yangju.
* January 1, 1963 - Uijeongbu is separated and becomes a city.
* April 1, 1980 - Namyangju is separated and becomes a city.
* July 1, 1981 - Dongducheon is separated and becomes a city.

== Attractions==
Yangju is home to the Jangheun Art Gallery, which features six exhibition halls and includes subsidiary facilities such as outdoor performances and outdoor sculptures. Yangju also has an astronomical observatory and planetarium that is open to the public. The city also used to have a walking Dae Jang Geum Theme Park featuring the film locations and constructed sets for the MBC Korean drama &quot;Daejanggeum&quot;, but this was closed permanently in late 2011 due to persistent vandalism.

Yangju also hosts the yearly Yangju Snow Festival. The city has a few mountains, including Gamaksan and Bulgoksan, which can be hiked. Part of Bukhansan is located within Yangju.

==Town==
It is divided into Okjeong New City and Hoecheon New City.

Okjeong City consists of Okjeong Village, Yuljeong Village, Hoeam Village, Wow Village, Cheonbosan Village, and Dokbawigol.

===Okjeong new city===
In the beginning, the correct name was Okjeong-gu, Yangjin City, but the LH removed the name Yangjin-city to reflect the opinions of residents, and Okjeong-gu was called Okjeong-si, and Hoecheon-si was called Hoecheon New Town. It is being sold under the name of the city of Okshin City.
It claims to be a pleasant new town with a green area ratio of 26.88% where a high-tech city and clean nature harmonize.
Okjeong and Hoecheon With a population of 160,000, the target population of 41,481 households is 106,000. As of March 2021, 17 complexes have been completed / moved in, and the resident population has exceeded 50,000 (as of February 10, 2021).

Currently 8 complexes remain.

===Okjeong Lake Park===
Okjeong Lake Park is a lake park that has been completed since the development of Yangshuo City in 2007. There are facilities such as a fountain facility, an outdoor stage, and a lake observatory.

==Climate==
Yangju has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;) with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers.
==Transportation==
There are three subway stations covered by the Seoul Metropolitan Subway, and it takes about 70 minutes from the center of Seoul
to the first station located in Yangju.
Also, there are numerous public bus services running between Seoul, Uijeongbu, and up to Yeoncheon, where the border with North Korea
is crossed by the Demilitarized Military Zone.

<text>A baseball is the ball used in the sport of baseball. It consists of a rubber or cork center wrapped in yarn and covered with white natural horsehide or cowhide, or a synthetic composite leather. A regulation baseball is in circumference i.e. in diameter, with a weight of .

The leather cover is commonly formed from two saddle-shaped pieces stitched together, typically with red-dyed thread. There are 108 stitches on a regulation baseball. That stitching plays a significant role in the trajectory of a thrown baseball due to the drag caused by the interaction between the stitching and the air. Controlling the orientation of the stitches and the speed of the ball&#x27;s rotation allows a pitcher to affect the behavior of the pitched ball in specific ways. Commonly employed pitches include the curveball, the slider, the two-seam fastball, the four-seam fastball, the sinker, the cutter and the changeup.

==History==
In the early, mid-1800s days of baseball, there was a great variety in the size, shape, weight, and manufacturing of baseballs. Early baseballs were made with a rubber core from old, melted shoes, wrapped in yarn and leather. Fish eyes were also used as cores in some places. Pitchers usually made their own balls, which were used throughout the game, softening and coming unraveled as the game went on. One of the more popular earlier ball designs was the &quot;lemon peel ball,&quot; named after its distinct four lines of stitching design. Lemon peel balls were darker, smaller, and weighed less than other baseballs, prompting them to travel further and bounce higher, causing very high-scoring games.

In the mid-1850s, teams in and around New York met in an attempt to standardize the baseball. They decided to regulate the weight of baseballs at 5–6 oz, and with a circumference of 8–11 inches. There were still many variations of baseballs since they were completely handmade. Balls with more rubber and a tighter winding went further and faster (known as &quot;live balls&quot;), and balls with less rubber and a looser winding (known as &quot;dead balls&quot;) did not travel as far or fast. This is generally true for all baseballs. Teams often used this knowledge to their advantage, as players from the team usually manufactured their own baseballs to use in games.

There is no agreement on who invented the commonplace figure-8 stitching on baseballs. Some historians say it was invented by Ellis Drake, a shoemaker&#x27;s son, to make the cover stronger and more durable. Others say it was invented by Colonel William A. Cutler and sold to William Harwood in 1858. Harwood built the nation&#x27;s first baseball factory in Natick, Massachusetts, and was the first to popularize and mass-produce baseballs with the figure-8 design.

In 1876, the National League (NL) was created, and standard rules and regulations were put in place. A.G. Spalding, a well-known baseball pitcher who made his own balls, convinced the NL to adopt his ball as the official baseball for the NL. It remained that way for a century.

In 1910, the cork-core ball was introduced. They outlasted rubber core baseballs; and for the first few years they were used, balls were hit further and faster than rubber core balls. Pitchers adapted with the use of the spitball, which is now illegal, and an emphasis on changing the ball.

In 1920, a couple of important changes were made to baseballs. They began to be made using machine winders and a higher grade of yarn from Australia. Offensive statistics rose immediately, and players and fans alike believed the new balls helped batters hit the ball further.

In 1925, Milton Reach patented his &quot;cushion cork&quot; center. It was a cork core surrounded by black rubber, then another layer of red rubber.

In 1934, The National League and American League came to a compromise and standardized the baseball. They agreed on a cushion cork center; two wrappings of yarn; a special rubber cement coating; two more wrappings of yarn; and, finally, a horsehide cover.

Baseballs have gone through only a few small changes since the compromise. During World War II, the United States banned the use of rubber for non war-related goods, including for baseballs. So in , instead of using rubber, baseballs were made with rubber-like shells of &quot;balata&quot; (also used in golf balls), which is obtained from a particular type of tropical tree. Hitting declined significantly that year.

The introduction of synthetic rubber in resulted in baseballs returning to normal. Offense would return to normal after the change back to the regular ball and return of players from active duty.

In , due to a shortage of the material, horsehide was replaced by the more abundant cowhide as the cover material.

In , MLB ended its relationship with Spalding for manufacturing their baseballs and switched to Rawlings, which still provides the balls to MLB today.

A significant increase in the number of home runs since the start of the 2016 baseball season caused MLB officials to establish a committee that would examine the manufacturing process. In December 2019, MLB officials said that a lower stitching seam profile had most likely led to the increase in home runs, but also pledged to consider studying the issue. On February 5, 2021, MLB issued a memo that said that Rawlings had altered their manufacturing process to reduce the bounce in the balls and that after extensive testing, &quot;... we are comfortable that these baseballs meet all of our performance specifications.&quot; The same memo also noted that more teams had applied for permission to use humidors to store their baseballs. As of 2020 only the Arizona Diamondbacks, Boston Red Sox, Colorado Rockies, and Seattle Mariners, were using the devices.

==Overview==

Cushioned wood cores were patented in the late 19th century by sports equipment manufacturer Spalding, the company founded by former baseball star A.G. Spalding. In recent years, various synthetic materials have been used to create baseballs; however, they are generally considered lower quality, stitched with two red thick thread, and are not used in the major leagues. Using different types of materials affects the performance of the baseball. Generally a tighter-wound baseball will leave the bat faster, and fly further. Since the baseballs used today are wound tighter than in previous years, notably the dead-ball era that prevailed through 1920, people often say the ball is &quot;juiced&quot;. The height of the seams also affects how well a pitcher can pitch.

Baseballs used in MLB and the top minor leagues (AAA) are made to the same specifications, but labelled separately. Balls used in the lower minor leagues (up to AA) use slightly different specifications intended to make those balls somewhat more durable, although MLB pitchers on rehab assignments in the minors are usually supplied with major league-grade balls. Generally, in Little League through college leagues, the seams are markedly higher than balls used in professional leagues.

In 1901, the Spalding and Reach companies manufactured the official baseballs for the National and American Leagues, respectively, at a listed unit price of $1.25 each, which would be equal to $ today. By comparison, the same source lists top-quality baseball bats at a mere $0.75. Due to the high relative cost of ball production, club owners in the early 20th century were reluctant to spend much money on new balls if not necessary. It was not unusual for a single baseball to last an entire game, nor for a baseball to be reused for the next game especially if it was still in relatively good condition as would likely be the case for a ball introduced late in the game. Balls hit into the stands were retrieved by team employees in order to be put back in play, as is still done today in some other sports. Over the course of a game, a typical ball would become discolored due to dirt, and often tobacco juice and other materials applied by players; damage would also occur, causing slight rips and seam bursts. This would lower the offense during the games giving pitchers an advantage. However, after the 1920 death of batter Ray Chapman after being hit in the head by a pitch, perhaps due to his difficulty in seeing the ball during twilight, an effort was made to replace dirty or worn baseballs. However, even though scores of new balls are used nowadays in every game, some rules intended solely to reduce the frequency (and associated expense) of replacing balls during a game remain in force - the Pine Tar Incident in the 1980s was one famous incident triggered by a capricious enforcement of an obscure one.

Today, MLB teams are required to have a minimum of 156 baseballs ready for use in each game. When combined with baseballs needed for practice, etc. each MLB team uses tens of thousands of balls every season. However, modern professional-grade baseballs purchased in bulk only cost about seven dollars each (as of ) and thus make up a negligible portion of a modern MLB team&#x27;s operating budget. Recreational-grade baseballs can be purchased by the public for an even lower unit price.

Once discarded by the umpire, game-used baseballs not hit into the stands are collected by batboys. Many baseballs involved in historical plays are displayed at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Other baseballs associated with noteworthy in-game events are often authenticated and sold as memorabilia. Most such sales today are conducted on MLB&#x27;s official website. The total proceeds from such sales represent a significant portion of the total purchase cost of baseballs since even balls used for relatively minor accomplishments can each fetch hundreds or thousands of dollars.

In 1909, sports magnate and former player Alfred J. Reach patented the ivory centered &quot;ivory nut&quot; in Panama and suggested it might be even better in a baseball than cork. However, Philadelphia Athletics president Benjamin F. Shibe, who had invented and patented the cork centered ball, commented, &quot;I look for the leagues to adopt an &#x27;ivory nut&#x27; baseball just as soon as they adopt a ferro-concrete bat and a base studded with steel spikes.&quot; Both leagues adopted Shibe&#x27;s cork-centered ball in 1910.

The official major league ball is made by Rawlings, which produces the stitched balls in Costa Rica. Attempts to automate the manufacturing process were never entirely successful, leading to the continued use of hand-made balls. The raw materials are imported from the United States, assembled into baseballs and shipped back.

Throughout the 20th Century, Major League Baseball used two technically identical but differently marked balls. The American League had &quot;Official American League&quot; and the American League&#x27;s president&#x27;s signature in blue ink, while National League baseballs had &quot;Official National League&quot; and the National League president&#x27;s signature in black ink. Bob Feller stated that when he was a rookie in the 1930s, National League baseball laces were black, intertwined with red; American League baseball laces were blue and red. In 2000, Major League Baseball reorganized its structure to eliminate the position of league presidents, and switched to one ball specification for both leagues. Under the current rules, a major league baseball weighs between , and is in circumference ( in diameter). There are 108 double stitches on a baseball, or 216 individual stitches.

While the decision whether to discard a baseball is formally at the discretion of the home plate umpire, today baseballs are expected to be immediately replaced after even minor scratches, discoloration and undesirable texture that can occur during the game. Balls used for pre-game warm-ups are often given to fans. Because baseballs are almost always replaced after each half-inning it is increasingly customary for players to give balls used to end half-innings to fans in the front rows, either by handing the ball to a fan (especially a child) in the front row or by gently tossing it into the stands, especially if the player holding it is a home team player close to the stands as for example is often the case for an outfielder catching a fly ball. MLB has long recognized any ball that comes into the possession of a spectator by any lawful means after entering the stands as immediately becoming the property of that spectator, although balls hit out of the park for momentous occasions (record setting, or for personal reasons) are often requested to be returned by the fan who catches or otherwise retrieves it, or donated freely by the fan. Usually, the player will give the fan an autographed bat and/or other autographed items in exchange for the special ball.

Without proper preparation, an official professional-grade baseball is very dangerous to throw because it is so slick and hard. By rule, balls used in the professional game must be rubbed with a mud known as &quot;rubbing mud&quot;, which is typically applied either by the umpires or someone working under their supervision before each game, and is intended to help the pitcher&#x27;s grip. Because the mud discolors the ball, many fans prefer to purchase non-game-used balls for purposes such as collecting autographs, etc. In contrast, recreational-grade baseballs are designed so as not to require any special preparation before being used.

Three common forms of baseball exist: the standard leather-covered ball used in ubiquitously in the sport; a rubber version used in Japan for children&#x27;s baseball; and a softer yet &quot;practice&quot; ball mainly used indoors:

* Baseball or Hard baseball – Ordinary baseball which is used in Major League Baseball, in Japan is used in high school baseball and above for (hardball) baseball, referred to as hardball or baseball
* Rubber baseball aka &quot;Nanshiki&quot; – Used for rubberball baseball usually played prior to high school in Japan; sometimes referred to as Japanese rubber baseball
* Soft (compression) baseball – Used for batting practice and fielding training or softball baseball which can be safely played indoors, usually made from polyurethane (PU) material

==Famous baseballs==
Fans catching baseballs tied to MLB milestones has been a part of the game since fences became a part of it, increasingly being kept (and increasingly valuable) over time:
* The ball that Mark McGwire hit for his 70th home run of the 1998 baseball season, then setting a new record, was sold by a fan to Todd McFarlane for US$3.2 million at auction.
* Larry Ellison, not to be confused with the software entrepreneur of the same name, famously retrieved both Barry Bonds&#x27; 660th and 661st home runs.
* Barry Bonds&#x27; 73rd home run of the 2001 season. It was the last home run of his historic, record breaking season where he broke Mark McGwire&#x27;s single season home run record. Ownership of the ball generated controversy and litigation resulted between the two people who claimed to have caught it. The story was made into a documentary, &quot;Up for Grabs&quot;. It was sold in auction to Todd McFarlane for $450,000.
* Barry Bonds&#x27; record-breaking 756th home run, beating Hank Aaron&#x27;s record, caught by a New York Mets fan in 2007. It was later sold at an online auction for more than $750,000 to Marc Eckō, a New York fashion designer.
* Derek Jeter&#x27;s 3,000th hit, a home run, was caught by a New York Yankees fan who gave the ball back to the Yankees and was rewarded with about $70,000 worth of gifts and memorabilia.
* Roger Maris&#x27; 61st single-season home run was caught barehanded by a truck driver. The ball was sold at the price of $5,000.
Other famous baseballs:
* Babe Ruth&#x27;s home run in the 1933 MLB All-Star Game sold for over $800,000. It was also signed by him.
* Hank Aaron&#x27;s 755th home run ball sold for $650,000 at auction in 1999. The ball was kept in a safe deposit box for 23 years after groundskeeper Richard Arndt was fired from the Milwaukee Brewers for not returning the ball, even though he had attempted to the previous day.
* A baseball signed by both Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe (who were married for less than a year) in 1961 during spring training in Florida sold for $191,200 at auction.
* The ball that rolled between Bill Buckner&#x27;s legs (and cost Boston extra innings) during the 1986 World Series sold for $418,250 at auction.
* Steve Bartman interfered with a play while attempting to catch a foul ball, causing the Chicago Cubs not to get an out in &quot;The Inning&quot; during the 2003 NLCS. The loose ball was snatched up by a Chicago lawyer and sold at an auction in December 2003. Grant DePorter purchased it for $113,824.16 on behalf of Harry Caray&#x27;s Restaurant Group. On February 26, 2004, it was publicly exploded in a procedure designed by Cubs fan and Academy Award winning special effects expert Michael Lantieri. In , the remains of the ball were used by the restaurant in a pasta sauce. While no part of the ball itself was in the sauce, the ball was boiled in water, beer, vodka, and herbs and the steam captured, condensed, and added to the final concoction.

<text>Yeoju (; ) is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. Yeoju was a county but was raised to the status of a city in September 2013. Together with the neighboring city of Icheon, it is known as a major center of contemporary South Korean ceramics, and hosts the World Ceramic Exposition every year. Other local products of note include rice, sweet potatoes, and yellow melons. Yeoju is the birthplace of Korea&#x27;s last queen, Empress Myeongseong.

Yeoju&#x27;s institution of higher learning includes Yeoju Institute of Technology. The Jungbu Naeryuk Expressway passes through the city.

A city located in the easternmost part of the southeastern part of Gyeonggi Province. It is bordered by Wonju, Gangwon-do to the east, Icheon to the southwest, Gwangju to the west, Yangpyeong-gun to the north, and Chungju and Eumseong-gun of North Chungcheong Province to the south. On September 23, 2013, Yeoju-gun was promoted to Yeoju, and it is currently the most recently promoted city in the country.

==History==
===Early history===
There have been human settlements in the Yeoju area since Paleolithic times. At the Heunam-ri archaeological site, just southeast of the city proper, fragments of herringbone patterned earthenware pottery, axe heads, and other artifacts have been discovered. Further excavations from research teams and accidental findings from construction in the area have continued to reveal the continued human presence through the Neolithic era up to the beginnings of recorded history.

After becoming Yeoju-gun in 1895 and staying in Wonju in 1924, Seomyeon was incorporated into Yeoju-gun. In 1941, Yeoju-myeon was promoted to Yeoju-eup, and Gaegun-myeon was incorporated into Yangpyeong-gun in 1963.

===Three Kingdoms period and Goryeo dynasty===
Due to its location on the Namhan River. Yeoju was a geographically strategic point for the rulers of the Silla kingdom. During the reign of King Pasa 5th ruler of Shilla from 80 to 112 AD, the mountain fortress of Pasaseong-ji was constructed just downriver from Yeoju on Pasa Mountain. The fortress continued to be used in later dynasties, until its importance faded due to the usage of Namhansanseong became more prevalent. The majority of the 1,800 meter long wall still stands today and can be accessed by hiking trails.

Yeoju is also home to Silleuksa, the only riverside Buddhist temple in Korea. Silleuksa was founded in 580 by the monk Wonhyo, one of the leading minds in Korean Buddhist tradition. It is home to a collection of 7 relics as well as a brick-constructed pagoda, one of only several in the country.

The ruins of Godal-Saji temple are all that remain of a temple complex that was originally constructed in 764 AD by King Gyeongdeok, 35th king of Unified Silla. During the early years of the Goryeo dynasty, the complex was frequented and supported by the ruling family but was later burned down during the Joseon dynasty. Currently there is little left but a few stone stupas and dragon-headed turtles scattered among the foundations. The intricate carvings in these structures, however, are a lasting example of the workmanship of early Goryeo artisans 

===Joseon dynasty===
Yeoju continued to be an influence during the Joseon dynasty due to being a major agricultural producer of staple foods such as rice. Throughout the dynasty various laws were passed to increase the agricultural output and improve the quality of the rice which led to Yeoju, as well as its nearby neighbor Icheon becoming central to the industry. Some principal families became influential in Joseon politics, such as the Yeoheung Min clan and the Yeoheung Yi clan.

The tomb of Sejong the Great, the most influential king in Korean history, was moved to Yeoju from its former location in Seoul in 1469. The tomb continues to be one of the largest tourist attractions for the area.

In 1851, towards the end of the Joseon dynasty, Empress Myeongseong, the last empress of Korea, was born in Yeoju. Her birthplace, Gamgodang, was mostly destroyed during the Japanese occupation, but after the liberation of the country was restored in order to honor her resistance of Japanese rule.

Because Yeoju had been the birthplace of Empress Myeongseong, Yeoju and the surrounding countryside hosted activity by the Righteous Army in the years leading up to the Japanese occupation. Along with the presence of Righteous Army guerrilla fighters in the area, some local farmers offered their support of the resistance by providing rice and other foodstuffs.

==Climate==
Yeoju has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;) with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers.
==Special Products==
Yeoju Rice - Yeoju, which has been considered a clean area since ancient times, is a famous rice producing area known for its delicious rice that was presented to the king.

*Spicy Fish Stew - Among the 100-ri Namhangang River that runs through Yeoju, the Yeoju River is deep, so freshwater fish such as carp and squid raised here are delicious. Among them, carp has been presented to the king since ancient times. There are many spicy fish stew restaurants around the Namhangang River, such as on the riverside road behind Yeoju County Office, in the Sinreuksa tourist area, Heungcheon-myeon, Geumsa-myeon, and Gangcheon-myeon.

*Yeoju Sweet Potato - It is called Yeoju Sweet Potato because it tastes like honey chestnuts. It is recognized as the best quality as a healthy and diet food.

*Yeoju Golden Melon - The golden melon, which has a unique fragrance and soft texture, is a representative specialty of Yeoju that has been famous for a long time.

*Yeoju Peanuts - Yeoju peanuts, grown as an organic natural food, are synonymous with the best-selling domestic peanuts in the country due to their superior taste and quality.

In August 2015, over 100 civilians were evacuated from the area after North and South Korea exchanged artillery fire.

==Administrative districts==

The city is divided into two &quot;eup&quot; (towns) and eight &quot;myeon&quot; (townships):

<doc id="967761" wikidata="Q1676074" url="?curid=967761" title="Straylight Run">
<text>Straylight Run is an indie rock band based in Baldwin, Nassau County, New York. The band released two albums, &quot;Straylight Run&quot; and &quot;The Needles the Space&quot;, as well as three EPs, &quot;Prepare to Be Wrong&quot;, &quot;About Time&quot;, and &quot;Un Mas Dos&quot;. In 2010, the band announced that they would be going on indefinite hiatus, but might reunite in the future. Two of the members, John Nolan and Shaun Cooper, previously played in Taking Back Sunday and have since rejoined the band.

== History ==
When he was still a member of Taking Back Sunday, John Nolan wrote several songs that he didn&#x27;t feel would go well with the band. After their departure, John and Shaun Cooper recorded several demos with Taking Back Sunday drummer Mark O&#x27;Connell. The band began to take its present form when drummer Will Noon was invited to join after his former band, Breaking Pangaea, broke up. Breaking Pangaea&#x27;s former lead singer was Fred Mascherino, who later took Nolan&#x27;s place in Taking Back Sunday. Shortly thereafter, John&#x27;s sister, Michelle DaRosa, joined Straylight Run. The band&#x27;s name was taken from the final section of William Gibson&#x27;s cyberpunk science-fiction novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;.

The band gained popularity after posting six demo songs for free download on their official site. The group embarked on a brief headlining tour in the Northeast in September 2003 with support from Christiansen and JamisonParker. In October, the band went on their first full US tour, co-headlining the trek with the New Amsterdams. Following this, the band toured with the Format in November, and supported Coheed and Cambria in December. The band spent most of the month working on new material and making plans to record their debut. In January 2004, the band supported Brand New on their tour of the UK.

===&quot;Straylight Run&quot; (2004)===
Due to John&#x27;s and Shaun&#x27;s involvement in their previous band, they were bound by contract to release an album under Victory Records. They began to record their first album in April 2004 and released their self-titled debut album &quot;Straylight Run&quot; on October 12, 2004, after a one-month postponement. The album sold over 11,000 copies in the first week, and made the Billboard Top 100 Albums list. The album featured Nate Ruess, former lead singer of The Format and the indie-pop group fun. on the song &quot;It&#x27;s For the Best&quot;. In late 2005, the band toured with Simple Plan.

===&quot;Prepare to Be Wrong EP&quot; (2005)===
On October 4, 2005, the band released their second record in the form of the &quot;Prepare to Be Wrong EP&quot;. The CD comprised two old demos (&quot;A Slow Descent&quot; from the band&#x27;s original demo, and &quot;It Never Gets Easier&quot; a demo from the sessions for their first CD &quot;Straylight Run&quot;, although it was then known as &quot;Costello&quot;), a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;With God on Our Side&quot; and 3 new songs. The CD ended their contract with Victory Records. Plans for a live DVD were in the works but were shelved.

===&quot;The Needles the Space&quot; (2007)===
On June 19, 2007, the band released their second album, &quot;The Needles the Space&quot;, under Universal Records.

On December 8, 2007, the band was dropped from Universal Records.

The band toured in support of Bayside in February and early March, 2008. The band toured in support of The Used on the inaugural Get a Life Tour from March 31 through May 11, 2008.

On June 3, 2008, Michelle DaRosa announced that she would be leaving Straylight Run to pursue a solo career. In her MySpace message, she left the door open to rejoining the band at some future time. In late 2008, DaRosa formed the band Destry which also featured Sam Means of the indie rock group The Format, as well as Shaun Cooper from Straylight Run.

===&quot;Un Mas Dos&quot; EP and indefinite hiatus (2008-present)===
On June 10, 2008, the band entered the studio for pre-production on their next CD, an EP entitled &quot;Un Mas Dos&quot;. The band made the three song EP available in streaming format through MySpace and other means, and began selling digital download cards at its tour beginning September 9, 2008. On September 16, 2008, the band released the album in digital and vinyl format.

The band went on two tours in late 2008. In January 2009, the band&#x27;s cover of the Nirvana track &quot;Drain You&quot; was made available for download. The group played at the Soundwave Festivals in Australia in February and March 2009, as well as two shows with Minus the Bear. The band then planned to do further recording, towards another EP. In May and June, the band went on tour with Lovedrug and Good Old War. Ahead of the release of &quot;About Time&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Count Me Out&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Through with the Past&quot; were posted on Myspace.

In February 2010, Straylight Run announced they were going on an indefinite hiatus due to financial complications. John Nolan stated that he would continue his solo act, and was not against the idea of returning to Straylight Run. Shaun Cooper wrote a blog saying that he was retiring from touring, thanking Straylight Run and also thanking Taking Back Sunday and saying he is really proud of the work and success they have accomplished. On March 31, 2010, it was confirmed that John Nolan and Shaun Cooper had returned to Taking Back Sunday.

On June 4, 2011, Nolan and Cooper teamed up with Taking Back Sunday drummer Mark O&#x27;Connell to play a show at Rogue Live Studios in Hicksville, NY, with their set featuring six Straylight Run songs. Nolan pointed out before the last song of the set, &quot;Existentialism on Prom Night,&quot; that O&#x27;Connell was a member of Straylight Run for a brief time at its inception, before choosing to remain with Taking Back Sunday.

Will Noon frequently toured and performed as drummer for the band fun before their hiatus in 2015. He performed with them at the 2013 Grammy Awards Ceremony as well as their performance on Saturday Night Live

On December 8, 2021, the band performed their first live show since 2009, at Mulcahy&#x27;s in Wantagh, New York.

<text>James Dudley Fooshe (1844–1940), known as J. D. Fooshe, was a soldier, author, farmer, philosopher, Methodist churchman and one of the last surviving Confederate veterans in Richmond Co., Georgia. He was a prolific writer of articles that dealt with reminiscences of the American Civil War and his philosophy of religion, social conduct and political economy.

==Early life==
He was born March 29, 1844, in Abbeville District (now Greenwood County, South Carolina). He grew up near the Coronaca community, where Methodism made rapid strides during the 19th century. His parents were John Wright Fooshe (December 26, 1815 - December 25, 1888) and Martha Richardson (March 4, 1820 - May 26, 1883), descendants of up-country South Carolinians. He married, December 31, 1866, Mary Ann “Mollie” Fuller (December 17, 1848 - March 20, 1918) daughter of Jones Fuller (December 17, 1848 - October 6, 1868) and Narcissa Harris (November 11, 1807 - September 19, 1860) who bore him twelve children.

==Noted Confederate Veteran==
He joined Company A, James Battalion of South Carolina in the army of the Confederate States of America and served throughout the Civil War; being wounded during the first Maryland invasion and taken prisoner by the Union army. Shortly paroled, he was furloughed to recover from his wounds and returned to service only to be wounded again at the Battle of the Wilderness. He again recovered and returned to service, this time, in the Quartermaster Corps as secretary to Dr. Simon Baruch, father of Bernard Baruch, the noted presidential advisor.

==Progressive Citizen==
He was born into the Methodist Church, saw it divided into North and South, and heartily approved the merger that made Methodists one church again. On the argument for reuniting the church, he stated: &quot;I fought for the Confederacy and lived to see it become greater under the flag of the United States. I want to see our churches exercise the same forbearance that we who once fought with bullets instead of doctrines, have exercised.&quot;

He was a champion of a reunified nation and the up building of a better United States. His words shadowed the differences of a divided nation and called for the advancement of one nation standing together in all things.

==Life in Georgia==
Taking up residence in Richmond County, Georgia at the age of 60, he took a sand hills plantation and turned it into one of the garden spots of the county. He became a noted authority on bee culture and promoter of diversification in agriculture. At age 70 he planted a peach orchard and lived long enough to replant it twice.

He was in the limelight of the fight for prohibition and public education. He believed in good roads, education for all who would take it, and the homely virtues of thrift which the hard days after the Civil War had impressed upon him. He practically abandoned the growing of cotton while cotton was still “King” and became an enthusiastic champion of terracing, heavy fertilizing and grafting fruit trees for which he became noted for the high grade of his farm products, especially peaches.

He was critical of newfangled ways of approaching social and economic problems, but never critical of material progress. The slaughter in 1934 of millions of pigs to relieve overproduction was labeled by him &quot;a crime in the sight of God.&quot; A similar outburst of wrath greeted the plowing up of cotton, while many of the measures of relief were seen by him as a &quot;sure way to make a nation of loafers instead of workers.&quot; At age 90, he tired of his hand writing and learned to use a typewriter. To those who smiled at the idea, he retorted: &quot;When a man quits doing something new, he is already dead.&quot;

The same philosophy led him to replant his peach orchards for a third time at age 93. He had just begun to gather fruit from the last orchard when he died on January 11, 1940, at Gracewood just outside Augusta, GA, at age 95. He was buried at Magnolia Cemetery in Augusta.
Quotation: &quot;When a fellow gets as old as I am, he appreciates more than anything else the solitude of home and the quiet friendship of those he sees often.&quot;

<text>Rip Curl is an Australian designer, manufacturer, and retailer of surfing sportswear (also known as &quot;boardwear&quot;) and accompanying products, and a major athletic sponsor. Rip Curl has become one of the largest surfing companies in Australia, Europe, South America, North America and South Africa. Globally, Rip Curl is considered a successful member of the &quot;Big Three&quot;, of the surf industry alongside Quiksilver and Billabong.

Rip Curl is now present in several areas of board sports, including skateboarding / surfskating, freestyle skiing, snowboarding and wakeboarding. Some events in these other disciplines include the &quot;Rip Curl SurfSkate Festival&quot;, &quot;Rip Curl Wake, Skate and Music Festival&quot;, &quot;Rip Curl City Slam&quot; (skateboarding) and the &quot;Rip Curl World Heli Challenge&quot; (freestyle skiing and snowboarding).

==History==

The company was founded in 1969 by Doug Warbrick and Brian Singer in Torquay, Victoria, Australia, and initially produced surfboards. In 1970, they decided to begin production of wetsuits, with an emphasis on transforming diving technology into a wetsuit suitable for surfing. Alan Green (co-founder of Quiksilver) was a Rip Curl employee in 1969 and developed the first Quiksilver boardshorts at the Rip Curl Factory in April 1970.

In 2019 Tim Baker authored, The Rip Curl Story, a book documenting the company&#x27;s history. The Rip Curl Story celebrates 50 years of surfing and the wanderlust of the Rip Curl founders Doug &#x27;Claw&#x27; Warbrick and Brian Singer. It is pegged as both a business primer and an adventure story.

In mid-2012, Singer and Warbrick engaged the services of Bank of America Merrill Lynch to sell the brand, but the plan was abandoned in March 2013. In October 2019, Rip Curl was sold to outdoor specialist company Kathmandu.

On 16 August 2021, Rip Curl appointed Brooke Farris as the chief executive officer.

==The Search==

Rip Curl is responsible for a campaign called The Search. Surf films by legendary filmmaker Sonny Miller were created as part of the Search campaign: &quot;The Search&quot; (1992), &quot;The Search II&quot; (1993), &quot;Beyond the Boundaries: The Search III&quot; (1994), &quot;Feral Kingdom&quot; (1995), &quot;Tripping the Planet&quot; (1996) and &quot;Searching for Tom Curren&quot; (1996), which was awarded Video of the Year by &quot;Surfer&quot; magazine in 1997. In 2015 Rip Curl relaunched The Search.

==Awards==
Rip Curl is known for manufacturing technical products and innovation in the surf industry. Rip Curl&#x27;s &quot;FlashBomb Wetsuit&quot; won three consecutive SIMA (Surf Industry Manufacturers Association) awards for &quot;Wetsuit of the Year&quot; in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

The Rip Curl Group took home six wins at the 2017 SBIA Awards in Australia.

<doc id="967813" wikidata="Q493073" url="?curid=967813" title="NGC 2403">
<text>NGC 2403 (also known as [[Caldwell catalogue|Caldwell]] 7) is an intermediate spiral galaxy in the constellation Camelopardalis. It is an outlying member of the M81 Group, and is approximately 8 million light-years distant. It bears a similarity to M33, containing numerous star-forming H II regions, but being a little bit larger at approximately 90,000 light-years in diameter compared to the 61,100 light-year diameter of M33.
The northern spiral arm connects it to the star forming region NGC 2404. NGC 2403 can be observed using 10×50 binoculars. NGC 2404 is 940 light-years in diameter, making it one of the largest known H II regions. This H II region represents striking similarity with NGC 604 in M33, both in size and location in galaxy.

== Supernovae and Supernovae Imposters ==
There have been four reported astronomical transients in the galaxy:

* SN 1954J was first noticed by Gustav Tammann and Allan Sandage as a &quot;bright blue irregular variable&quot; star, which they named V12. They noted it underwent a major outburst on 2/3 November 1954, which attained a magnitude of 16 at its brightest. In 1972, Fritz Zwicky classified this event as a type V supernova. It was later determined to be a supernova imposter: a highly luminous, very massive eruptive star, surrounded by a dusty nebula, similar to the 1843 Great Eruption of η Carinae in the Milky Way.
* SN 2002 kg was discovered by LOTOSS (Lick Observatory and Tenagra Observatory Supernova Searches) on 26 October 2002 and initially classified as a type IIn, or possibly the outburst of a luminous blue variable. On 24 August 2021, it was reclassified as a Gap transient.
* SN 2004dj (type II-P, mag. 11.2) was discovered by Kōichi Itagaki on 31 July 2004. At the time of its discovery, it was the nearest and brightest supernova observed in the 21st century.
* AT2016ccd, initially designated as SNhunt225, is a luminous blue variable, first discovered by Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) and Stan Howerton in December 2013. Outbursts from this star have been observed as recently as November 2021.

== History ==
The galaxy was discovered by William Herschel in 1788. Edwin Hubble detected Cepheid variables in NGC 2403 using the Hale Telescope, making it the first galaxy beyond the Local Group within which a Cepheid was discovered. By 1963, 59 variables had been found in NGC 2403, of which 17 were eventually confirmed as Cepheids, with periods between 20 and 87 days. As late as 1950 Hubble was using a distance of just under 2 million light years for the galaxy&#x27;s distance, but by 1968 the analysis of the Cepheids increased this by almost a factor of five, to within 0.2 magnitudes of the current value.

== Companions ==
NGC 2403 has two known companions. One is the relatively massive dwarf galaxy DDO 44. It is currently being disrupted by NGC 2403, as evidenced by a tidal stream extending on both sides of DDO 44. DDO 44 is approaching NGC 2403 at a distance much closer than typical for dwarf galaxy interactions. It currently has a V-band absolute magnitude of −12.9, but its progenitor was even more luminous.

The other known companion is officially named MADCASH J074238+652501-dw, although it is nicknamed MADCASH-1. The name refers to the MADCASH (Magellanic Analog Dwarf Companions and Stellar Halos) project. MADCASH-1 is similar to typical dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group; it is quite faint, with an absolute V-band magnitude of −7.81, and has only an ancient, metal-poor population of red giant stars.

== Luminous blue variables in NGC 2403 ==
NGC 2403 has four known luminous blue variables. AT 2016ccd, NGC 2403 V14, NGC 2403 V37, and NGC 2403 V12.

Not much is known about AT 2016ccd, besides that it is a luminous blue variable. AT 2016ccd has a magnitude of 18-19.95, so it is quite dim. NGC 2403 V14 is more well known then AT 2016ccd. NGC 2403 V14 has a size of 1,260.2 solar radii, it has a mass of 24 solar masses and has a temperature of 7,041 K. NGC 2403 V14 has a magnitude of 12.9. NGC 2403 V37 is not well known, it is believed to be a luminous blue variable with a magnitude of 12.9. NGC 2403 V12 is an unknown luminous blue variable with a magnitude of 6.5.

<text>The tine test is a multiple-puncture tuberculin skin test used to aid in the medical diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). The tine test is similar to the Heaf test, although the Mantoux test is usually used instead. There are various forms of the tine tests which usually fall into two categories: the old tine test (OT) and the purified protein derivative (PPD) tine test. Common brand names of the test include Aplisol, Aplitest, Tuberculin PPD TINE TEST, and Tubersol.

==Procedure==
This test uses a small &quot;button&quot; that has four to six short needles coated with TB antigens (tuberculin), either an old tuberculin or a PPD-tuberculin. The needles are pressed into the skin (usually on the inner side of the forearm), forcing the antigens into the skin. The test is then read 48 to 72 hours later by measuring the size of the largest papule or induration. Indications are usually classified as positive, negative, or doubtful.

Because it is not possible to control precisely the amount of tuberculin used in the tine test, a positive test should be verified using the Mantoux test.

==PPD==
Tuberculin is a glycerol extract of the tubercle bacillus. Purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin is a precipitate of non-species-specific molecules obtained from filtrates of sterilized, concentrated cultures. It was first described by Robert Koch in 1890 and then Giovanni Petragnani. A batch of PPD created in 1939 serves as the US and international standard, called PPD-S. PPD-S concentration is not standardized for multiple-puncture techniques, and should be designed for the specific multiple-puncture system.

==Comparison to Mantoux test==
The American Thoracic Society or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) do not recommend the tine test, since the amount of tuberculin that enters the skin cannot be measured. For this reason, the tine test is often considered to be less reliable.

Contrary to this, however, studies have shown that the tine test can give results that correlate well to the Mantoux test. If a minor reaction is considered doubtful, the OT test is less accurate and may fail to detect TB, producing a false negative. If all doubtful indications are instead classified as positive, there is no significant difference between the OT test, the PPD tine test, or the Mantoux test.

Furthermore, the tine test is faster and easier to administer than the Mantoux test and has been recommended for screening children.

<doc id="967830" wikidata="Q335267" url="?curid=967830" title="Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood">
<text>Vice Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood (26 September 1748 – 7 March 1810) was an admiral of the Royal Navy. Collingwood was born in Newcastle upon Tyne and later lived in Morpeth, Northumberland. He entered the Royal Navy at a young age, eventually rising from midshipman to lieutenant in the American Revolutionary War, where he saw action at the Battle of Bunker Hill during which he led a naval brigade. In the 1780s and 1790s Collingwood would participate in the French Revolutionary Wars, during which time he captained several ships and reached the rank of Post Captain. He took part in several key naval battles of the time, including the Glorious First of June and the Battle of Cape St Vincent.

In 1799, he was promoted to rear-admiral and later vice-admiral, where he undertook a variety of command roles during the Napoleonic Wars, including serving as second in command of the British Fleet under Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar. Following Nelson&#x27;s death, Collingwood became commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. He remained in post despite worsening health for several years and after finally being allowed to resign, he would die a day later at sea on the journey back to England. Collingwood was a respected admiral during the days of sail and notable as a friend and partner with Lord Nelson in several of the British victories of the Napoleonic Wars as well as Nelson&#x27;s successor in several Royal Navy commands.

==Early years==
Sources vary as to the exact date but Collingwood was born on either 24 or 26 September 1748 in Newcastle upon Tyne in a house (since demolished) on a street of medieval origin named &#x27;the Side&#x27;. He had 10 siblings, although only 6 survived into adulthood, including his two brothers Wilfred and John (Wilfred would also serve as a naval officer). The Collingwood family were an old small landowning family from the border region between England and Scotland. Collingwood&#x27;s great-grandfather was executed by hanging in Liverpool for supporting the House of Stuart in battle during the Jacobite rising of 1715. His grandfather and father were therefore deprived of their estate in Eslington Park, Northumbria. His father, also Cuthbert, had instead become a local merchant and small business owner (though would later be declared bankrupt) and his mother, Milcah came from near Appleby-in-Westmorland. At age 11, he began studying at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle receiving instruction in Latin. The school was well known for flogging as a form of discipline, even for younger students, and it was said that this punishment led to Collingwood&#x27;s dislike of the practice and was why he used flogging sparingly on his ships later when he was a captain. However, Collingwood did not stay at school long and expressed an interest to go to sea so that at the age of 12, he went to sea as a volunteer and apprentice on board the sixth-rate under the command of his cousin Captain Richard Braithwaite (or Brathwaite), who took charge of his nautical education. He received instruction in sailing, mathematics (including trigonometry), navigation (including celestial navigation) and in how to use a sextant. Collingwood would spend several years of apprentice service under Braithwaite, including when Braithwaite changed ship to HMS Gibraltar and saw sea service in home waters, the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.

In 1766, in his 18th year, Collingwood was officially rated as midshipman. In 1767, he was transferred to the sixth-rate assigned to the Mediterranean fleet. He served on the ship for several years, becoming Master&#x27;s Mate (a position responsible for navigation) while preparing for his lieutenancy examinations. In 1772, Collingwood spent a short period attached to , a guardship at Portsmouth commanded by Captain Robert Roddam. In 1773, he was sent to Sheerness in Kent with a party of 18 seaman and joined . The ship joined a convoy of merchant ships and headed for the Americas via Madeira. The ship patrolled waters around the Leeward Islands, the Windward Islands and Jamaica. On 1 June 1773, Collingwood was discharged from the Portland and sent to serve on . The Amelia sailed to Florida and then Newfoundland before returning to England in August 1773.

With the discontent forming in the Americas that would result in the ensuing American Revolutionary War, Collingwood sailed to Boston in 1774 with Admiral Samuel Graves on board . He would remain on the ship as it was stationed in Boston Harbour for some 18 months on station. However, as American revolutionary forces encircled the town, Collingwood fought in the British naval brigade ashore at the Battle of Bunker Hill on 17 June 1775. Collingwood was in command of the boats that landed the second wave of troops of William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe. Following the battle, he was commissioned as acting lieutenant. To have his promotion confirmed by the Admiralty, Collingwood required to return to England and so transferred to as fourth lieutenant, as the ship sailed to Nova Scotia before proceeding onto England in February 1776. He stayed in London during this time and his rank of lieutenant was officially confirmed in the Spring of 1776.

In April 1776, he joined the 14-gun HMS Hornet as first lieutenant, where he was required to form a press-gang before the ship sailed to the West Indies. Collingwood remained onboard as the ship arrived in Jamaica with a remit to protect shipping against American privateers and prevent smuggling. Collingwood believed that the ship&#x27;s Captain, Commander Haswell was a &quot;rotten officer&quot; who lacked the courage to engage enemy shipping and they disagreed onboard, leading to Haswell following up with court-martial proceedings for &quot;disobedience and neglect of orders&quot; against Collingwood in September 1777. However, the court martial at Port Royal, Jamaica acquitted Collingwood of the charges. Shortly after his court-martial in 1777, Collingwood met Horatio Nelson when they both served on the frigate . The two officers would become good friends. After Nelson had left the Lowestoffe, Collingwood was given the post of second lieutenant on on station in the West Indies.

==Minor command==

On 20 June 1779, Collingwood succeeded Nelson as commander of the brig , his first full command. On 22 March 1780 he again succeeded Nelson, this time as post-captain of , a small frigate. Nelson had been the leader of a failed expedition to cross Central America from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean by navigating boats along the San Juan River, Lake Nicaragua and Lake Leon. Nelson was debilitated by disease and had to recover before being promoted to a larger vessel, and Collingwood succeeded him in command of &quot;Hinchinbrook&quot; and brought the remainder of the expedition back to Jamaica. By 1781, he had been appointed to command another small frigate . On 22 July 1781, under Collingwood, Pelican captured the French 16-gun ship Le Cerf on 22 July. While navigating off Morant Cays, Jamaica, the ship was destroyed by a hurricane and the crew shipwrecked. Collingwood led his crew ashore in rafts (made from broken rigging and planks) where they remained for ten days until rescued. The subsequent court-martial, mandatory for any Captain who loses his ship, declared him not at fault for the loss of the ship, given the tremendous extent of the hurricane that had caused much damage across the region. Collingwood remained without ship on half-pay in the East Indies before returning to England in early 1782. After a brief time in London, Collingwood was appointed to command to the third-rate 64-gun ship of the line .

By 1783, Collingwood had been transferred to command the fourth-rate 44-gun which sailed in September 1783 to take up post in the West Indies. The ship was stationed at English Bay and then in Barbados. Collingwood renewed his friendship with Captain Horatio Nelson while in the region. In 1784 he and Nelson were together ashore in Antigua for several weeks where they both became attracted to the unobtainable American-born Mary Moutray, wo was married to Royal Commissioner of the island. During frequent evenings together with Mary, Collingwood and Nelson both sketched each other and Collingwood kept the sketch. Collingwood remained in the West Indies until the end of 1786, again, together with Nelson and this time his brother, Commander Wilfred Collingwood, with their mission being to prevent American ships from trading with the West Indies under the Navigation Acts. During this time, Collingwood and Nelson in their ships seized several US merchantman as prizes in consequence of trading illegally.

In July 1786, Collingwood returned to England where his ship&#x27;s company were paid off. Collingwood was given an extended leave and as a relatively junior post-captain in a time of increased levels of peace, he was not given a ship for several years. Despite frequent attempts to secure a ship in London, Collingwood returned north to Newcastle for months at a time to spend time with his extended family, during which he learned that his brother, Captain Wilfried Collingwood had died at sea. As a result of the developing Nootka Crisis by June 1790, Collingwood had been given command of the 32-gun frigate . The frigate sailed again to the West Indies under Admiral Cornish. Shortly before the ship sailed, Collingwood began correspondence with Sarah Blackett, daughter of acquaintance John Erasmus Blackett, merchant and mayor of Newcastle whom he met through his friend and superior Admiral Roddam. In 1791, the results of war having lessened, Collingood returned to England on the Mermaid arriving at Portsmouth in April 1791. Collingwood was put on half-pay ashore and remained without command again until 1793. However, once Collingwood had been paid off, he returned to Newcastle where on 18 June 1791, at Newcastle Cathedral he married Sarah, the Cathedral being some 50 yards from where he was born. Her dowry was £6250 and in 1792, the Collingwoods used it to rent a house on Oldgate Street in Morpeth. In May 1792, they had a daughter, Sarah. His second daughter, Mary, would be born in the summer of 1793, after he had returned to sea.

==Major command==

Following the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars, in 1793, he was appointed captain of , the flagship of Rear Admiral George Bowyer in the Channel Fleet. Collingwood joined the ship in Plymouth, where it was fitted out and crewed (with manning being difficult) before heading to station at Spithead. After sometime on station in the Prince, it was found the ship had poor sailing qualities so Collingwood and Bowyer transferred to . The Barfleur would sail with the rest of the fleet under overall command of Admiral Howe in an effort to engage a large portion of the French Fleet and prevent a merchant convoy reaching France. This resulted in the battle of June 1794 that became known as the Glorious First of June. The Barfleur came under fire during the battle, during which time Bowyer lost his leg in action and Collingwood directed sailing of the ship from the quarterdeck during the main action. Because he was not mentioned specifically in Howe&#x27;s report to the admiralty, whether by error or intention, Collingwood was disappointed not to receive a Naval Gold Medal for the action unlike the other Captains present. He would later receive the medal some years later with an apology. However, on returning to England he was one of a select group of captains who were invited to dine with King George III.

In late 1794, he was given command of the third-rate . Collingwood was onboard for the fitting out but delays in obtaining sufficient crew resulted in his ship being kept in port. He returned home briefly to see his family but after only a few days was recalled to Plymouth to command the third-rate , a ship which he would command for the next four years. After leaving England, the ship sailed for the Mediterranean Sea, protecting a merchant convoy to Corsica before joining British forces in blockade off Italy at Livorno (Leghorn), where Collingwood would again meet and serve with his friend Horatio Nelson. Collingwood and his ship would winter off Corsica until spring 1796, during which time the ship had a minor collision in the darkness with . HMS Excellent served as part of the fleet under Admiral Jervis, stationed off Saint Florent. As the Spanish joined the French in war, the fleet sailed west to Gibraltar at the end of 1796. The fleet took up station off Lisbon in January 1797 with the aim being to bring the French and Spanish fleets to battle.

===Battle of Cape St Vincent===

In February 1797, on board Excellent he participated in the victory of the Battle of Cape St Vincent. As the British fleet began to pass in parallel to the enemy fleet, Jervis ordered his ships to tack in succession and engage. Nelson saw an opportunity to engage the Spanish fleet directly and left the line of the fleet, heading straight for the Spanish van. Collingwood, who was at the rear of the line, saw Nelson&#x27;s action and ordered his ship to follow and engage directly. Jervis later approved of their actions following victory. Collingwood and his ship directly engaged the far larger 112-gun Salvador del Mundo and after several rapid and accurate broadsides from Excellent, the Spanish ship struck her colours (though she would later attempt to fight again before being finally captured). The two ships had been &quot;so close that a man might jump from one to another&quot;. The Excellent sailed on, engaging the 74-gun San Ysidore and causing her to surrender also. The Excellent then moved to support Nelson and his ship which was being engaged by two Spanish ships at once. Together both Spanish ships were also defeated. During the engagement, a double-headed shot narrowly missed Collingwood&#x27;s head, hitting the base of the mast near where he stood. He took it home as a souvenir for his father-in-law. Collingwood&#x27;s actions established his good reputation in the fleet for his conduct and gallantry during the battle. He received a Gold Medal for his conduct as well as the one owed to him for the Glorious First of June. He had originally declined the medal as he argued to receive such a distinction now would be to acknowledge the propriety of the injustice of not receiving the earlier medal. Lord Spencer, the First Lord of the Admiralty who wrote &quot;the former medal would have been transmitted to you some months ago if a proper and safe conveyance had been found for it&quot;. Nelson&#x27;s and Collingwood&#x27;s decision to leave the line of battle and engage the enemy directly were seen as decisive in the British victory that followed.

===Promotion to rear-admiral===

After the battle, Collingwood and his ship would take up station blockading Cadiz and he was promoted to the rank of Commodore. He is said to have written that the time on blockade was dreary. In late 1798, he returned to Portsmouth with his ship to repair. By February 1799, he had returned home to Morpeth to spend time with his family. While at home, he learned that he was to be raised to the rank of rear-admiral (of the White 14 February 1799). In June 1799, Collingwood returned to sea, hoisting his flag in the 74-gun , joined the Channel Fleet and sailed to the Mediterranean where the principal naval forces of France and Spain were assembled. Several enemy ships were captured and Collingwood&#x27;s share of the prize money amounted to some £4,000. In 1800, he had transferred his flag from Triumph to , which he had sailed on a few years earlier as captain. Collingwood continued to be actively over the next several years in blockading the enemy until the Peace of Amiens allowed him to return home. However, he was able to briefly spend time with his family in Plymouth who had travelled to join him where the Barfleur repaired and took supplies. At this time, he also purchased the freehold of the house, later known as Collingwood House that they had rented in Morpeth and had purchased a pet dog, Bounce, who joined him on his ship. When not at sea he resided at in the town of Morpeth which lies some 15 miles north of Newcastle upon Tyne and Chirton Hall in Chirton, now a western suburb of North Shields. Of his time in Morpeth, he is known to have remarked, &quot;whenever I think how I am to be happy again, my thoughts carry me back to Morpeth.&quot; He was elevated to rear-admiral of the Red on 1 January 1801. He remained on service until May 1802 when he was allowed to sign off his ship and return home for leave.

With the resumption of hostilities with France in the spring of 1803 he left home to the Admiralty and then a ship, never to return home again. Nearly two years were spent off Brest in anticipation for Napoleon&#x27;s planned invasion of the United Kingdom. Together, with his pet dog Bounce, Collingwood joined the frigate HMS Diamond and raised his flag. In August 1803, Collingwood was able to transfer his flag to the larger 74-gun . which then joined other ships and blockaded the French fleet off Brest in late 1803. The Venerable returned to Plymouth for repairs and to take food and supplies over Christmas.

===Promotion to vice-admiral===
After discovering that great repairs were needed to the Venerable, in February 1804, he transferred his flag to resuming blockade with the fleet off France. He briefly moved his flag to the 98-gun but returned after only a few months to the Culloden again. In April 1804, Collingwood was promoted to vice-admiral (of the Blue 23 April 1804). In August 1804, he transferred to the relatively new 98-gun second-rate which would be his ship until shortly before the Battle of Trafalgar. The ship spent time on blockade before supplying and repairing at Cawsand Bay, Cornwall over winter.

When the French fleet sailed from Toulon, Admiral Collingwood was appointed to command a squadron, with orders to pursue them. The combined fleets of France and Spain, after sailing to the West Indies, returned to Cadiz. On their way they encountered Collingwood&#x27;s small squadron off Cadiz in August 1805. He had only three ships with him; but he succeeded in avoiding them despite being chased by 16 ships of the line. Before half of the enemy&#x27;s force had entered the harbour he resumed the blockade off Cadiz by shortening sail and standing towards the combined fleet for battle. Using false signals to disguise the small size of his squadron, the combined fleet believed Collingwood&#x27;s force part of a much larger fleet and did not engage, returning to harbour. His action was seen as a tactical victory that would be one of several factors that led to the events of the Battle of Trafalgar. He was soon joined by several other ships, increasing the blockade and then by Nelson who took command of the squadron on 28 September, hoping to lure the combined fleet out into a major engagement.

==Battle of Trafalgar==
In mid-September, at Nelson&#x27;s order, Collingwood transferred his flag to the 100-gun and was appointed second-in-command. The Royal Sovereign had just been given a new layer of copper on its hull and was therefore the fastest of the large ships at Trafalgar. On 9 October, Nelson sent Collingwood his plan of attack (the &#x27;Nelson Touch&#x27;) and this was subsequently relayed to the Captains in the fleet. On the morning of 20 October, the combined French and Spanish fleet sailed from Cadiz in October 1805. The Battle of Trafalgar immediately followed on 21 October as Villeneuve, the French admiral, drew up his fleet in the form of a crescent. The British fleet bore down in two separate lines, the one led by Nelson in HMS &quot;Victory&quot;, and the other by Collingwood in . On seeing the famous signal from Nelson &quot;England expects that every man will do his duty&quot;, he is said to have remarked &quot;I wish Nelson would make no more signals; we all understand what we have to do.&quot; However, it was said that Collingwood ordered it to be announced to the ship&#x27;s company, by whom it was received with the greatest enthusiasm.

&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; raced ahead of the other ships as she was the swiftest ship because of her new copper hull. Having drawn considerably ahead of the rest of the fleet, she was the first engaged and was targeted by six enemy ships. &quot;See&quot;, said Nelson, pointing to &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; as she penetrated the centre of the enemy&#x27;s line, &quot;see how that noble fellow Collingwood carries his ship into action!&quot; Probably it was at the same moment that Collingwood, as if in response to the observation of his great commander, remarked to his captain, &quot;What would Nelson give to be here?&quot; &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; closed with the Spanish admiral&#x27;s ship and fired her broadsides with such rapidity and precision at &quot;Santa Ana&quot; that the Spanish ship was on the verge of sinking almost before another British ship had fired a gun. This was seen as a feat that owed much to Collingwood&#x27;s frequent drilling of his gunnery crew: he believed that if a ship could release 3 well aimed broadsides in five minutes, &quot;no enemy could resist them&quot;. Several other vessels came to &quot;Santa Ana&quot;″s assistance and hemmed in &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; on all sides; the latter, after being severely damaged, was relieved by the arrival of the rest of the British squadron, but was left unable to manoeuvre as the ship had been dismasted. Not long afterwards &quot;Santa Ana&quot; struck her colours. Collingwood was wounded in the battle by a splinter that gashed his leg. However, he was wearing silk stockings, as he advised other officers to also wear, allowing for the surgeon to better treat leg wounds. During the intense firing, one officer reported that he ate an apple while discussing the progress of the fight. Collingwood had been fortunate, as he was one of only three officers left alive on the quarterdeck.

On the death of Nelson, Collingwood assumed command of the fleet and his position as acting commander-in-chief, transferring his flag to the frigate HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot; because of the damage to the Sovereign. He is said to have shed tears on learning of the death of his friend Lord Nelson. He gave the order the Sovereign to be towed away from action while she was still afloat. Anticipating that a storm was forming, Nelson had intended that the fleet should anchor after the battle. However, on taking command Collingwood chose not to issue such an order for several reasons, disagreeing with Nelson&#x27;s earlier command. Many of the British ships and prizes were so damaged that they were unable to anchor, and Collingwood concentrated efforts on taking only those damaged vessels likely to survive the storm in tow. In the ensuing gale, many of the prizes were wrecked on the rocky shore and others were destroyed to prevent their recapture, though no British ship was lost. Collingwood wrote his official dispatch to the Admiralty as two letters on 22 and 24 October, informing Britain of victory in battle but the loss of Nelson.

After the Battle, Collingwood was concerned with getting the worse ships away for repairs while maintaining the blockade off Cadiz and other ports. On 9 November 1805, Collingwood was raised to the peerage as Baron Collingwood, of Caldburne and Hethpool in the County of Northumberland. However, the barony was enacted to pass only along the male line and so he later wrote numerous times to the government asking it be amended so his daughters could inherit which did not occur. He also received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament and was awarded a pension of £2,000 per annum. The Patriotic Fund awarded him a £500 commerative silver vase. Together with all Trafalgar captains and admirals, he also received a Naval Gold Medal, his third, after those for the Glorious First of June and Cape St Vincent. Only Nelson and Sir Edward Berry share the distinction of three gold medals for service during the wars against France.

==Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet==
In the Spring of 1806, Collingwood was formally appointed as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet. He was also elevated to Vice-Admiral of the Red. In 1806, while at sea, he organised the sale of his house at Morpeth after fully inheriting an estate called Chirton from his wealthy third cousin, Edward Collingwood. The Chirton estate was held in trust and included the estate house, a coal mine, cottages and other buildings. However, Collingwood would not spend any significant time at the property, as he remained on post in the Mediterranean. In October 1806, he transferred his flag to and in April 1806 he transferred his flag to .

From Trafalgar until his death, no great naval action was fought in the Mediterranean Sea as a result of the British blockade and manoeuvrings of ships to prevent an enemy fleet from forming. Collingwood&#x27;s time as Commander-in-Chief would involve maintaining the blockade of French and Spanish ships around the coasts of the Mediterranean. This included preventing French squadrons from sailing from the ports of Toulon and Cartagena. Although several small French squadrons would attempt to run the blockade and one successfully landed troops in the Caribbean two months after Trafalgar, the majority were either intercepted or forced to return to port by superior firepower. Collingwood was occupied in important political and diplomatic transactions in the Mediterranean, in which he displayed tact and judgement. His influence in the Navy was significant at this time, with his role as head of some 30,000 men in ships and ports. On several occasions, he wrote several dispatches and letters to the Admiralty and government urging for more ships to maintain blockades.

He made visits and carried out diplomatic discussions with States and authorities including Morocco, Naples and the Ottoman Empire. In February 1807, he dispatched ships under his second-in-command Sr John Duckworth and a squadron to the Dardanelles. The squadron had some minor engagements with the Turkish but eventually withdrew to prevent ships being damaged by bombardment from ashore. Collingwood later visited the Dardanelles himself in August 1807 to negotiate with the Pasha and Sultan under a flag of truce. As a result, the Ottoman empire agreed to remain neutral in the Mediterranean. In late 1807 and early 1808, he wintered with his ship at Syracuse in Sicily. In March 1808, French forces attempted to break out at sail to Italy but were prevented by the assembly of a fleet of ships under Collingwood. Collingwood also first wrote of his worsening health, with poor bowels and a complaint about lack of exercise having spent several years at sea.
In 1808, Collingwood sent ships to support British forces and Spanish partisans during the Peninsular War, including preventing the supply by sea of French forces in Spain. In late 1808 and early 1809, his ship, Ocean undertook repairs and was stationed at Malta. While in Malta, Collingwood was given the additional honorary appointment of Major-General of Marines. The appointment included some £1,400 as a stipend but carried no duties. In March 1809, Ocean was sent back to England and Collingwood transferred his flag to what would be his last vessel, . Collingwood stationed himself off Port Mahon and Menorca, organising the continuing blockade of French ports, before joining the blockade of Toulon in the summer of 1809. The blockade intercepted a convoy, capturing some 13 ships and destroying two line ships in a minor action. It would be the last offensive action of his career.

===Death===
Collingwood&#x27;s own health continued to decline at sea and his pet dog, Bounce, also died from drowning in late 1809. He requested to be relieved of his command of the fleet so that he might return home, however the government urgently required an admiral with the experience and skill of Collingwood to remain, on the grounds that his country could not dispense with his services in the face of the still potent threat that the French and their allies could pose. Over-wintering off Menorca, his health began to decline alarmingly by November 1809 and by February 1810 could barely walk. He was forced to again request the Admiralty to allow him to return home, which was finally granted in February 1810. He surrendered command of the Mediterranean on 3 March 1810, temporarily to Rear-admiral George Martin before it passed officially to Sir Charles Cotton.

After finally being given permission to return home, Collingwood died as a result of cancer on board , off Port Mahon as he sailed for England, on 7 March 1810. The Ville de Paris returned his body to England, where it was then taken by barge up the River Thames to London. His body lay in State for several days at Greenwich Hospital before he was laid to rest beside Nelson in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

On his death, Collingwood&#x27;s estate was valued at £160,000. This was a considerable sum for the period and especially for a naval officer from a less than affluent background. His will left £40,000 each to both his daughters as specific legacies. As Collingwood died without male issue, his barony became extinct at his death.

===Evaluation===

Collingwood&#x27;s merits as a naval officer were in many respects of the first order. His political judgement was remarkable and he was consulted on questions of general policy, of regulation, and even of trade. He was opposed to impressment and to flogging and was considered so kind and generous that he was called &quot;father&quot; by the common sailors. Nelson and Collingwood enjoyed a close friendship, from their first acquaintance in early life until Nelson&#x27;s death at Trafalgar; and they are both entombed in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Collingwood had a reputation for financial prudence and careful investment, including being careful with the spending of naval funds.

Thackeray held that there was no better example of a virtuous Christian Knight than Collingwood: Another true knight of those days was Cuthbert Collingwood; and I think, since heaven made gentlemen, there is no record of a better one than that. Of brighter deeds, I grant you, we may read performed by others; but where of a nobler, kinder, more beautiful life of duty, of a gentler, truer heart? Beyond dazzle of success and blaze of genius, I fancy shining a hundred and a hundred times higher, the sublime purity of Collingwood&#x27;s gentle glory. His heroism stirs British hearts when we recall it. His love, and goodness, and piety make one thrill with happy emotion. As one reads of him and his great comrade going into the victory with which their names are immortally connected, how the old English word comes up, and that old English feeling of what I should like to call Christian honour!
With the aim of growing trees for Britain&#x27;s future, Collingwood was known for dropping acorns as he walked around the countryside. Dudley Pope relates an aspect of Collingwood at the beginning of chapter three of his &quot;Life in Nelson&#x27;s Navy&quot;: Captain Cuthbert Collingwood, later to become an admiral and Nelson&#x27;s second in command at Trafalgar, had his home at Morpeth, in Northumberland, and when he was there on half pay or on leave he loved to walk over the hills with his dog Bounce. He always started off with a handful of acorns in his pockets, and as he walked he would press an acorn into the soil whenever he saw a good place for an oak tree to grow. Some of the oaks he planted are probably still growing more than a century and a half later ready to be cut to build ships of the line at a time when nuclear submarines are patrolling the seas, because Collingwood&#x27;s purpose was to make sure that the Navy would never want for oaks to build the fighting ships upon which the country&#x27;s safety depended. Collingwood once wrote to his wife that he&#x27;d rather his body be added to Britain&#x27;s sea defences rather than given the pomp of a ceremonial burial.

Sailor Robert Hay who served with Collingwood wrote that: &quot;He and his dog Bounce were known to every member of the crew. How attentive he was to the health and comfort and happiness of his crew! A man who could not be happy under him, could have been happy nowhere; a look of displeasure from him was as bad as a dozen at the gangway from another man&quot;. and that: &quot;a better seaman, a better friend to seamen - a more zealous defender of the country&#x27;s rights and honour, never trod the quarterdeck.&quot;

===Memorials===
Collingwood has been memorialised in name with a Royal navy shore establishment, several towns and some 27 streets, schools and public houses. Dedicated to his name, the Maritime Warfare School of the Royal Navy is commissioned as , home to training for warfare, weapon engineering and communications disciplines. The town of Collingwood, Ontario, on Georgian Bay in Canada, the suburb of Collingwood in the Australian city of Melbourne, the town of Collingwood, New Zealand and the Collingwood Channel (an entrance of Howe Sound near Vancouver, British Columbia), are named in his honour. One of the four houses at Collingwood&#x27;s old school the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, is named after him. One of the five houses of British public school Churcher&#x27;s College is named after him, as is one of the eleven houses at The Royal Hospital School. One of the three secondary Schools within Excelsior Academy in Newcastle was named after Collingwood in 2013. A battalion of the Royal Naval Division (1914 to 1919) was named after Collingwood. It took part in the Antwerp Campaign (October 1914) and at Gallipoli. The Collingwood Battalion received so many casualties at the 3rd battle of Krithia, Gallipoli, on 4 June 1915 that it never reformed. From 1978 until 1992, British Rail locomotive 50005 was named &quot;Collingwood&quot;. In November 2005, English, Welsh &amp; Scottish named locomotive 90020 &quot;Collingwood&quot; at Newcastle station. The Collingwood Society, is a members society dedicated to his memory.

A large monument, the Collingwood Monument, stands in his honour and overlooks the River Tyne at Tynemouth. His Grade II listed statue was sculpted by John Graham Lough and stands atop a pedestal designed by John Dobson. The four cannon on the walls flanking the steps at its base came from his flagship, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;. There is also a carved memorial to him at Newcastle Cathedral.

Collingwood&#x27;s former temporary residence in Es Castell close to Mahon, Menorca is now a hotel and home to a collection of heirlooms relating to his time on the island.

March 2010 saw the 200th anniversary of Collingwood&#x27;s death and a number of major events were organised by &#x27;Collingwood 2010&#x27; on Tyneside, in Morpeth and the island of Menorca.

===Literature===

Letitia Elizabeth Landon celebrates the Admiral in her poetical illustration &quot;Admiral Lord Collingwood&quot; in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833. This is to an engraving of a variation on the painting by Henry Howard, apparently by his son Frank Howard.

Collingwood is fictionalized as &quot;Admiral Sir John Thornton&quot; in Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s &quot;The Ionian Mission.&quot; He appears under his own name in &quot;Hornblower and the Atropos&quot;, when Hornblower&#x27;s ship joins the Mediterranean fleet a few months after Trafalgar.

<doc id="967834" wikidata="Q7827277" url="?curid=967834" title="Tort law in Australia">
<text>The system of tort law in Australia is broadly similar to that in other common law countries. However, some divergences in approach have occurred as its independent legal system has developed.

Some of these differences include Australia-specific nuances involving: (1) what torts are recognised, (2) the steps to establish liability, and (3) calculations for awards of damages.

These differences have emerged due to both legislative reform, as well as common law developments.

==Overview==

Throughout Australia&#x27;s early history, its tort jurisprudence largely complied with UK precedent. In more recent years, its jurisprudence has diverged from the UK and other common law countries.

Developments in Australian Tort law are most powerfully driven by the High Court of Australia. In doing so, the High court frequently refers to other apex courts around the world for comparative law purposes. It has said that it is &#x27;inevitable and desirable that the courts of this country will continue to obtain assistance and guidance from the learning and reasoning of other great common law courts&#x27;.

Over the years, differences of application have emerged in Australia&#x27;s tests for causation, duty of care, calculation of damages, amongst other areas. These have been documented by academics. Specific differences include the &#x27;salient features&#x27; framework used to determine a duty of care for negligence, and the lack of an intent element for the tort of trespass.

To the extent tort law is defined by Australia&#x27;s nationally uniform common law, its tort regime is also nationally unified.&quot;&quot; However, due to the fact that Australian State parliaments are able to modify law within their own jurisdictions through statute; in practice each State has its own quirks. There have been attempts on occasion to unify tort law between the States to some extent.

== Statutory reform ==
Parliaments have occasionally decided it necessary to modify the law of torts to address public concerns. A prominent historical example of this is the 1897 Workmen&#x27;s Compensation legislation, which was enacted in response a perceived failure of the common law to address risks of harm to workers during industrialisation.

Other major reforms affecting tortious liability has included the &quot;Trade Practices Act 1974&quot; and the state Fair Trading Acts.

From the early 1980s legislative intervention attempted to reduce the high volume of litigation involving motor vehicle and industrial accidents. Parallel to the rise of Thatcherism in the United Kingdom, in all Australian states common law torts were significantly modified. Speedy &quot;no fault&quot; compensation was made available to workers and victims of motor vehicle accidents in Tasmania, Victoria and the Northern Territory.

===The decline of HIH Insurance, the Ipp Review and beyond===
Since 2002 there has been an acceleration of legislative change, driven by a perceived crisis in the price and availability of insurance, which was largely blamed on the law of negligence. The issue became charged politically, reinforced by the direct liability of government and its role as a re-insurer of last resort. New South Wales, the most litigious state, had commenced legislative change prior to 2002. Following the collapse of HIH Insurance and the related escalation in insurance premiums in public liability and medical negligence, the NSW proposals were adopted more widely throughout Australia.

==Elements of various torts==

=== Tort of Invasion of privacy ===

There is currently no freestanding tort for the invasion of privacy in Australian law. In &quot;ABC v Lenah Games Meats&quot; in 2001, the High Court left open the possibility of the tort being recognised in future. The court has also held that &quot;Victoria Park Racing v Taylor&quot; did not inhibit the development of privacy law in Australia.

Puisne decisions entertaining the possibility of the tort have occurred in at least two states. One noteworthy decision was a District Court of Queensland award of damages for the invasion of privacy by Judge Skoien. Another was a decision of Justice Gillard of the Supreme Court of Victoria in &quot;Giller v Procopets&quot;, in which the Court held the law had &#x27;not developed to the point where the law in Australia recognises an action for breach of privacy&#x27; Both cases were settled out of court and, as a result, did not proceed to appeal; and so have no value as legal precedent.

The Australian Law Reform Commission has recommended the Commonwealth create a private right to sue for a serious invasion of privacy. The body has argued that by describing the action as a tort, courts will be encouraged to draw upon established principles of tort law (which it hopes would promote a measure of certainty and consistency to the law). It also considers the enactment of such a cause of action would bring Australia into line with recent common law developments concerning serious invasions of privacy in common law jurisdictions.

===Defamation===

Australia&#x27;s defamation law emerged from English common law, but has since evolved in application though statute and judicial decisions. To the extent Australia&#x27;s system retains commonalities with English law, UK jurisprudence retains value as providing guidance to Australian courts.

One key tension in Australia is a need for defamation law to strike an appropriate balance between the protection of an individual&#x27;s reputation and values relating to free speech; as well as constitutional protections of political communication. Many of the complexities that arise from defamation proceedings are said to derive from judicial attempts to maintain that balance. The decision of &quot;Lange v ABC&quot; is an example of a case where Australia&#x27;s constitutional free speech protections were assessed in the context of a defamation proceeding.

===Wrongful life===
A wrongful life claim is one in which a child plaintiff brings an action against a doctor who negligently diagnosed the plaintiff&#x27;s mother. Usually, the doctor failed to diagnose rubella during the first trimester, for which there is no cure and which will inevitably cause profound disabilities in the unborn child. Had the mother been correctly diagnosed, she would have exercised her legal right to abortion.

In May 2006, the majority of the High Court rejected wrongful life, refusing to accept that life can be considered a compensable harm. This means that children who are born disabled as a result of a doctor&#x27;s (admitted) negligence cannot claim damages. Parents are able to pursue &#x27;wrongful birth&#x27; claims if the child (disabled or not) is the outcome of a negligently performed sterilisation procedure. However, since the &quot;Civil Liability Act&quot;, they cannot recover the costs of raising the child in New South Wales.

== Litigation ==
Tort law occupies much of the time of the various Magistrates, Local, District and County Courts and a substantial proportion of the time of the Supreme Courts of each of the states and territories. In addition, there are numerous specialist tribunals dealing with workers&#x27; compensation and other cases. Road accident victims are far more likely to make claims and receive tort compensation than any other group This predominance is due not so much to the law of torts, but the fact that liability insurance is compulsory by statute in all Australian states.

<text>Ellen Henrietta Swallow Richards ( Swallow; December 3, 1842 – March 30, 1911) was an American industrial and safety engineer, environmental chemist, and university faculty member in the United States during the 19th century. Her pioneering work in sanitary engineering, and experimental research in domestic science, laid a foundation for the new science of home economics. She was the founder of the home economics movement characterized by the application of science to the home, and the first to apply chemistry to the study of nutrition.

Richards graduated from Westford Academy (second oldest secondary school in Massachusetts) in 1862. She was the first woman admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She graduated in 1873 and later became its first female instructor. Richards was the first woman in America accepted to any school of science and technology, and the first American woman to obtain a degree in chemistry, which she earned from Vassar College in 1870.

Richards was a pragmatic feminist, as well as a founding ecofeminist, who believed that women&#x27;s work within the home was a vital aspect of the economy. At the same time, however, she did not directly challenge the prevailing cult of domesticity that valorized women&#x27;s place and work in the home.

== Biography ==

=== Early childhood ===

Richards was born in Dunstable, Massachusetts. She was the only child of Peter Swallow (b. June 27, 1813, Dunstable; d. March 1871, Littleton, Massachusetts) and Fanny Gould Taylor (b. April 9, 1817, New Ipswich, New Hampshire), both of whom came from established families of modest means and were believers in the value of education.

=== Early life and education ===
Swallow was home-schooled in her early years. In 1859, the family moved to Westford and she attended Westford Academy. Studies at the academy included mathematics, composition, and Latin, similar to other New England academies of the time. Swallow&#x27;s Latin proficiency allowed her to study French and German, a rare language north of New York. Because of her language skills she was much in demand as a tutor, and the income earned from this made it possible for Swallow to further her studies.

In March 1862, she left the academy. Two months later, in May, she developed the measles, which set her back physically and interrupted her preparations to begin teaching.
In the spring of 1863, the family moved to Littleton, Massachusetts, where Mr. Swallow had just purchased a larger store and expanded his business. In June 1864, Swallow, now twenty-one, took a teaching position.

She did not teach again in 1865, but spent that year tending the family store and taking care of her ill mother. During the winter of 1865–66, Swallow studied and attended lectures in Worcester.

=== College education ===
In September 1868, Swallow entered Vassar College, classified as a special student. Somewhat over a year later, she was admitted to the senior class, graduating in 1870 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. She then earned a Master of Art&#x27;s degree with a thesis on the chemical analysis of iron ore. The strongest personal influences during her college years were Maria Mitchell, the astronomer, and Professor Charles S. Farrar (1826-1908), who was at the head of the Department of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.

In 1870, she wrote to Merrick and Gray, commercial chemists in Boston, asking if they would take her on as an apprentice. They replied that they were not in a position to take pupils and that her best course was to try to enter the Institute of Technology of Boston as a student.
On December 10, 1870, after some discussion and a vote, the Faculty of the Institute of Technology recommended to the MIT Corporation the admission of Swallow as a special student in chemistry. Swallow thus became the first woman admitted to Massachusetts Institute of Technology, although the corporation made it clear that &quot;her admission did not establish a precedent for the general admission of females,&quot; according to the records of the corporation&#x27;s meeting on December 14, 1870.
In 1873, Swallow received a Bachelor of Science degree from MIT for her thesis, &quot;Notes on Some Sulpharsenites and Sulphantimonites from Colorado&quot;. She continued her studies at MIT and would have been awarded its first advanced degree, but MIT balked at granting this distinction to a woman and did not award its first advanced degree, a Master of Science in chemistry, until 1886.

Richards served on the board of trustees of Vassar College for many years and was granted an honorary doctor of science degree in 1910.

=== Marriage and home ===

On June 4, 1875, Swallow married Robert Hallowell Richards (1844–1945), chairman of the Mine Engineering Department at MIT, with whom she had worked in the mineralogy laboratory. They took up residence in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. With her husband&#x27;s support she remained associated with MIT, volunteering her services and contributing $1,000 annually to the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Laboratory,&quot; a program in which her students were mostly schoolteachers, whose training had lacked laboratory work, and who wanted to perform chemical experiments and learn mineralogy.

== Career ==
Her first post-college career was as an unpaid chemistry lecturer at MIT from 1873 to 1878.
From 1884 until her death, Swallow now Richards was an instructor at the newly founded laboratory of sanitary chemistry at the Lawrence Experiment Station, the first in the United States, headed by her former professor William R. Nichols.

In 1884, she was appointed as an instructor in sanitary chemistry at a newly formed MIT laboratory for the study of sanitation.

Mrs. Richards was a consulting chemist for the Massachusetts State Board of Health from 1872 to 1875, and the Commonwealth&#x27;s official water analyst from 1887 until 1897. She also served as nutrition expert for the US Department of Agriculture.

== Scientific experiments ==

=== Air and water quality ===

In the 1880s, her interests turned toward issues of sanitation, in particular air and water quality. At the request of the Massachusetts State Board of Health she performed a series of water tests on 40,000 samples of local waters which served as drinking water for their immediate populations. These led to the so-called &quot;Richards&#x27; Normal Chlorine Map&quot; which was predictive of inland water pollution in the state of Massachusetts. This map plotted the chloride concentrations in waters of the state. It illustrated the natural distribution of chlorides from the ocean. (Her survey long preceded the practice of road de-icing with chlorine derivative salts.) Her map plotted greater than 6.5 parts per million (ppm) of chloride near the coast, with Cape Cod concentrations well in excess of 10 ppm and with a near-steady decreasing gradient to less than 1 ppm about the Berkshire Hills in the extreme western end of the state. Thereby waters with chloride concentrations that deviated from the plot could be suspected of human pollution. As a result, Massachusetts established the first water-quality standards in America, and the first modern sewage treatment plant was created in Lowell, Massachusetts.

=== Mineralogy ===
Richards&#x27; master&#x27;s thesis at Vassar was an analysis of the amount of vanadium in iron ore.
She performed numerous experiments in mineralogy, including the discovery of an insoluble residue of the rare mineral samarskite. This was later determined by other scientists to yield samarium and gadolinium. In 1879 she was recognized by the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers as their first female member.

=== Home sanitation ===
Richards applied her scientific knowledge to the home. Since women were responsible for the home and family nutrition at the time, Richards felt that all women should be educated in the sciences. She wrote books about science for use in the home, such as &quot;The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning&quot;, published in 1882. Her book &quot;Food Materials and Their Adulterations&quot;(1885) led to the passing of the first Pure Food and Drug Act in Massachusetts.

She used her own home as a kind of experimental laboratory for healthier living through science. Concerned with air quality in her home, she moved from coal heating and cooking oil to gas. She and her husband installed fans to pull air from the home to the outside to create a cleaner air environment within the home. She also determined the water quality of the property&#x27;s well through chemical testing, and to ensure that wastewater was not contaminating the drinking water.

=== Euthenics ===

Richards derived the term euthenics from the Greek verb Eutheneo, Εὐθηνέω (eu, well; the, root of tithemi, to cause). To be in a flourishing state, to abound in, to prosper.—&quot;Demosthenes&quot;. To be strong or vigorous.—&quot;Herodotus&quot;. To be vigorous in body.—&quot;Aristotle&quot;. And from the Greek Euthenia, Εὐθηνία. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.—&quot;Herodotus&quot;. The opposite of Euthenia is Penia - Πενία (&quot;deficiency&quot; or &quot;poverty&quot;) the personification of poverty and need.

In her book &quot;Euthenics: the science of controllable environment&quot; (1910), she defined the term as the betterment of living conditions, through conscious endeavor, for the purpose of securing efficient human beings.

Vigorous debate about its exact meaning, confusion with the term eugenics, followed by the Great Depression and two world wars, were among the many factors which led to the movement never really getting the funding, nor the attention needed to put together a lasting, vastly multidisciplinary curriculum as defined by Richards. Instead, different disciplines such as Child Study became one such curriculum.

Martin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that: Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists.

Richards was the first writer to use the term euthenics, in &quot;The Cost of Shelter&quot; (1905), with the meaning &quot;the science of better living&quot;.

=== Laboratory work ===
After her first experience as water analyst under Professor Nichols, Richards began a large, private practice in sanitary chemistry, including testing water, air and food, and the testing of wallpapers and fabrics for arsenic. In 1878 and 1879 she examined a large number of staple groceries for the state. The results of her investigation were published in the first annual report of the Board of Health, Lunacy and Charity, which had succeeded the earlier Board of Health.

She also served as a consultant to the Manufacturers Mutual Fire Insurance Company and in 1900 wrote the textbook &quot;Air, Water, and Food from a Sanitary Standpoint&quot;, with A. G. Woodman. Her interest in the environment led her to introduce the word ecology into English around 1892. The word had been coined by German biologist Ernst Haeckel to describe the &quot;household of nature&quot;.

Richards&#x27; interests also included applying scientific principles to domestic situations, such as nutrition, clothing, physical fitness, sanitation, and efficient home management, creating the field of home economics. &quot;Perhaps the fact that I am not a radical and that I do not scorn womanly duties but claim it as a privilege to clean up and sort of supervise the room and sew things is winning me stronger allies than anything else,&quot; she wrote to her parents. She published &quot;The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning: A Manual for House-keepers&quot; in 1881, designed and demonstrated model kitchens, devised curricula, and organized conferences.

== Women&#x27;s education ==

=== Woman&#x27;s Laboratory assistant instructor ===
Mrs. Richards appeared before the Woman&#x27;s Education Association of Boston on November 11, 1875, and in an address, which made a deep impression, set forth the needs of women. She expressed the belief that the governing board of the Institute of Technology would provide space for a woman&#x27;s laboratory if the Association would supply the necessary money for instruments, apparatus, and books. She said that scholarships would be indispensable.

The Woman&#x27;s Education Association appointed a committee to enter into discussions with the Institute of Technology, which led to the creation of the MIT Woman&#x27;s Laboratory in November 1876. The Institute provided a small building, planned for a gymnasium, as the location of the Laboratory. Mrs. Richards became an unpaid assistant instructor in 1879 in chemical analysis, industrial chemistry, mineralogy, and applied biology under Professor John M. Ordway. The Woman&#x27;s Education Association agreed to raise money to buy equipment for the laboratory.

A new building, erected by the institute in 1883, reserved space for all laboratory students&#x27; use, women as well as men. The original Woman&#x27;s Laboratory was closed and the building demolished.

In 1884, Mrs. Richards was appointed Instructor in Sanitary Chemistry in the Institute of Technology itself, a position which she filled until the time of her death. In addition to her faculty duties and instructional work, she was also the &quot;untitled&quot; Dean of Women.

=== American correspondence school instructor ===
In January 1876, Mrs. Richards began a long association with the first American correspondence school, the Society to Encourage Studies at Home, as an instructor, and developed its science department.

In 1886, a new section promoted by Richards, Sanitary Science, was established by the Society. This was at a time when household conveniences employing water, gas, or electricity were becoming more common, but housekeepers seldom understood the dangers or difficulties inherent in using these new appliances. She saw that instruction was needed and the Society began to provide information on how to organize a house on truly scientific principles.

=== American Association of University Women ===
Richards, Emily Fairbanks Talbot, and Marion Talbot (Boston University class of 1880) became the &quot;founding mothers&quot; of what was to become the American Association of University Women (AAUW) when they invited fifteen other women college graduates to a meeting at Marion Talbot&#x27;s home in Boston, on November 28, 1881. The group envisioned an organization in which women college graduates would band together to open the doors of higher education to other women and to find wider opportunities for their training. The Association of Collegiate Alumnae (ACA), AAUW&#x27;s predecessor organization, was officially founded on January 14, 1882.

=== Teachers&#x27; School of Science ===
Lucretia Crocker, along with women&#x27;s clubs and other help in the Boston area, created a &quot;Teachers&#x27; School of Science&quot; in Back Bay at the New Museum of the Boston society. Along with Mrs. Richards, Crocker created a mineralogy course for teachers. Scientists in the Boston area offered their teaching services for the school, allowing teachers to easily take such courses.

=== New England Kitchen of Boston ===
On January 1, 1890, Richards collaborated with Mary Hinman Abel (1850–1938) to found the New England Kitchen of Boston, at 142 Pleasant Street. Using volunteers of modest circumstances, they experimented with ways to prepare the most inexpensive, tasty and nutritious food.

Years later, Mrs. Richards, herself, wrote in her preface to part one of &quot;The Rumford kitchen leaflets: No. 17, The Story of the New England Kitchen; Part II; A study in social economics&quot;, by Mary Abel:
The story of the New England Kitchen ... is remarkable for two things: the new and valuable information which has been acquired, as the result of the daily work of the Kitchen, and the short time which has sufficed to put the enterprise on a business basis.

It is well to emphasize the causes of this success, that the lessons in social science and practical philanthropy be not lost. A large part of the credit is due ... to Mrs. Abel&#x27;s hard work[.] [S]tarting the New England Kitchen ... was ... an experiment to determine the successful conditions of preparing, by scientific methods, from the cheaper food materials, nutritious and palatable dishes, which should find a ready demand at paying prices.

Mrs. Abel would doubtless give as the principal secret of her success, that she had everything necessary for the experiments, without giving a thought to the cost. ... In the New England Kitchen, the selection of the apparatus and material and the employment of labor have been without restriction. Without this freedom to carry on the experiments as seemed wise and prudent, the results detailed in the accompanying report could not have been attained.

The philanthropy of the scheme rests in the experimental stage of the development of the New England Kitchen. Whether the business can in the future take care of itself to the profit of those who conduct it remains to be seen ; but, in any event, kitchens of this kind cannot fail to be of great advantage to multitudes in moderate circumstances, who have hitherto been unable to buy good, nutritious, and tasteful cooked food.
=== Rumford Kitchen ===

In 1893, when Richards was in charge of the Rumford Kitchen at the World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago, she accepted the added work and responsibility of arranging an exhibition of the work of Studies at Home.

The opening statement of the &quot;Guide to the Rumford Kitchen: An Exhibit made by the State of Massachusetts in connection with the Bureau of Hygiene and Sanitation&quot; (World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893) by General Francis A. Walker explains:

The exhibit known as the Rumford Kitchen is the outgrowth of the work, in the application of the principles of chemistry to the science of cooking, which has for three years been carried on as an educational agency by Mrs. Robert H. Richards and Mrs. Dr. John J. Abel, with pecuniary assistance from certain public-spirited citizens of Boston.

The Massachusetts Board of World&#x27;s Fair Managers, ... believing that such practical demonstration of the usefulness of domestic science could not fail to be of advantage to multitudes of visitors to the Columbian Exposition, have invited the ladies named to open the Rumford Kitchen as a part of the exhibit of Massachusetts in connection with the Bureau of Hygiene and Sanitation.

In order to reduce, in some degree, the expenses of this exhibit, the food cooked in the Rumford Kitchen will be sold under a concession from the administration of the Exposition ; but it should be understood that this is not a money-making exhibit; that nothing is cooked for the sake of being sold; and that the enterprise is to be regarded as absolutely a scientific and educational one.

The purpose of the exhibit in the Rumford Kitchen is two-fold: First, to commemorate the services to the cause of domestic science rendered by Count Rumford one hundred years ago[;] ... second, to serve as an incentive to further work in the same direction, as he expressed it,&quot; to provoke men to investigation,&quot; &quot;to cause doubt, that first step toward knowledge.&quot;

The first commercially available &quot;modern&quot; kitchen ranges began to appear about 1800, they were the invention of an American named Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count von Rumford.

=== American Public School Lunch Program ===
A first, major program was started in some Boston high schools in 1894 to provide nutritional meals at low prices to children who would not normally have them. Due in large part to Ellen Richards and Edward Atkinson, the New England Kitchen ran the program as a &#x27;private enterprise&#x27; that paid for itself many times over. The lunches never became effective instruments for teaching the New Nutrition the founders had envisaged. But, because the program provided nutritious meals children would otherwise not have, it became the main justification for similar lunch programs in other cities.&quot;

In 1946, President Harry S. Truman signed into law the National School Lunch Program to provide low-cost or free school lunch meals to qualified students through subsidies to schools. The program was established as a way to prop up food prices by absorbing farm surpluses, while at the same time providing food to school age children. It was named after Richard Russell, Jr.

=== Lake Placid Conference ===
Early in September 1899, trustees of the Lake Placid Club (in the Adirondacks) thought it was the right time to bring together those most interested in home science, or household economics and sent out many invitations for the Lake Placid Conference scheduled to take place September 19–25, 1899. Melvil Dewey, one of the club&#x27;s trustees, personally invited Richards to attend. She gave a lecture on standards of living and was elected chairman of the conference.

=== American Home Economics Association ===
In 1908, Richards was chosen as the first president of the newly formed American Home Economics Association, which was renamed the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences in 1994. She also founded and funded the Association&#x27;s periodical, the &quot;Journal of Home Economics&quot;, which began publication in 1909. It was renamed the &quot;Journal of Family and Consumer Sciences&quot; in 1994 when the Association changed its name.

Her books and writings on this topic include &quot;Food Materials and their Adulterations&quot; (1886); &quot;Conservation by Sanitation&quot;; &quot;The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning&quot;; &quot;The Cost of Living&quot; (1899); &quot;Air, Water, and Food&quot; (1900); &quot;The Cost of Food&quot;; &quot;The Cost of Shelter&quot;; &quot;The Art of Right Living&quot;; &quot;The Cost of Cleanness&quot;; &quot;Sanitation in Daily Life&quot; (1907); and &quot;Euthenics, the Science of Controllable Environment&quot; (1910). Some of these went through several editions.

== Death ==
Richards died on March 30, 1911, at her home in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, after suffering with angina. She is buried in the family cemetery in Gardiner, Maine.

<doc id="967863" wikidata="Q5031026" url="?curid=967863" title="Canal Street, New Orleans">
<text>Canal Street () is a major thoroughfare in the city of New Orleans. Forming the upriver boundary of the city&#x27;s oldest neighborhood, the French Quarter or &quot;Vieux Carré&quot;, it served historically as the dividing line between the colonial-era (18th-century) city and the newer American Sector, today&#x27;s Central Business District.

Up until the early 1800s, it was primarily Creoles who lived in the Vieux Carré. After the Louisiana Purchase (1803), a large influx of other cultures began to find their way into the city via the Mississippi River. A number of Americans from Kentucky and the Midwest moved into the city and settled uptown. Along the division between these two cultures, a canal was planned. The canal was never built but the street which took its place received the name. Furthermore, the median of the street became known as the neutral ground, acknowledging the cultural divide. To this day, all medians of New Orleans streets are called neutral grounds.

One end of Canal Street terminates at the Mississippi River. Often called &quot;the foot of Canal Street&quot;, at the riverfront the Canal Street Ferry offers a connection to the Algiers Point neighborhood, an older, 18th-century portion of the larger Algiers section of New Orleans. Canal Street&#x27;s other terminus is in Mid-City at a collection of cemeteries. Slightly offset from the Mid-City end is the beginning of Canal Boulevard, which extends to the shore of Lake Pontchartrain via the Lakeview neighborhood. Throughout its length, Canal, which runs east and west, serves as a dividing line for cross streets running north and south; although the New Orleans layout follows the Mississippi River.

The street has three lanes of traffic in both directions, with a pair of streetcar tracks in the center. Canal Street&#x27;s downtown segment serves as the hub of the city&#x27;s public transit system or RTA, with numerous streetcar and bus route terminals. (Of note, it is the home of the Canal Streetcar Line, operated by the RTA.)

Canal Street has been called &quot;America&#x27;s widest main street.&quot; Canal Street is often said to be the widest roadway in America to have been called a street, instead of the avenue or boulevard titles more typically appended to wide urban thoroughfares.

==Shopping==

For more than a century, Canal Street was the main shopping district of Greater New Orleans. Local or regional department stores Maison Blanche, D. H. Holmes, Godchaux&#x27;s, Gus Mayer, Labiche&#x27;s, Kreeger&#x27;s, and Krauss anchored numerous well-known specialty retailers, such as Rubenstein Men&#x27;s Store, Adler&#x27;s Jewelry, Koslow&#x27;s, Rapp&#x27;s, and Werlein&#x27;s Music, as well as bookstores, drugstores, Kress, Woolworth&#x27;s, and others. The department stores began as sellers of fabric, notions, and accessories, with extensive floor space and glass windows. As elevators and escalators allowed for multi-floor department stores, the stores were enlarged and made more elegant by incorporating adjoining buildings.

Although Canal Street began to lose its primacy as a regional shopping destination in the late 1960s, it retained a robust mix of department stores and specialty shopping into the mid-1980s — somewhat later than main-street shopping districts in other U.S. cities — and it received a boost in 1983 with the completion of Canal Place&#x27;s retail component. However, national trends disfavoring downtown retail finally caught up with Canal Street — with a key assist from the regional economic depression of the mid-80s (the Oil Bust).

One Canal Place has three lower levels which are occupied by The Shops at Canal Place. The mall contains a Saks Fifth Avenue, the Theatres at Canal Place, a food court, and approximately 45 high-end retailers including Anthropologie, Brooks Brothers, Michael Kors, and Morton&#x27;s the Steakhouse. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, a fire inflicted heavy damage to the Saks Fifth Avenue store. The mall reopened in February 2006, and a completely-remodeled Saks reopened in November.

One Canal Place Office Tower is a Class A commercial office building managed by Corporate Realty. It is adjacent to the Westin New Orleans Hotel. The office space is made up of more than and includes a parking garage and health club facilities.

==Entertainment==
New Orleans has historically been a center for opera, theater, and concerts. In 1871 the Varieties Theater opened on Canal Street between Dauphine and Burgundy streets. The building was renovated and renamed the Grand Opera House in 1881, which could be used as both a theater and ballroom. Theaters and movie houses were clustered around the intersection with Rampart Street, with the neon marquees of the Saenger, Loews State, Orpheum, and Joy casting multi-colored light nightly onto surrounding sidewalks.
It is said that the world&#x27;s first movie theater (that is, the first business devoted specifically to showing films for profit) was &quot;Vitascope Hall&quot;, established on Canal Street in 1896. By the 1910s there were several movie theaters on Canal, including the Alamo, the Plaza, and the Dreamworld. In 1912 the Trianon, the first &quot;movie palace&quot; in the city opened. The Tudor followed in 1914 and the Globe in 1918. By the 1950s they had become low-grade theaters, and in the 1960s they were closed.

Although most of the grand movie theaters have closed over the years, several cinemas on Canal Street operate today.

==Hotels==
In the 1830s, several hotels on Canal Street near the river were in operation, including the Union Hotel and the Planters Hotel. Although most of the grand 19th-century hotels were located in the French Quarter, the Perry House was on Canal Street. By the 1920s a growth was seen in the number of hotels on Canal Street. These included the LaSalle Hotel, the Hotel New Orleans, and the Jung Hotel with its rooftop ballroom. As convention industry began to grow in the 1960s, the Governor House Motor Hotel and the International Hotel were built. Almost a whole block was taken up by the Marriott Hotel which opened in 1972 as the tallest hotel in the city.
Canal Street began to accommodate large convention hotels, such as the Sheraton New Orleans and the JW Marriott. The emergence of new hotels has since slowed, but continued operation of many on Canal Street indicate the sustained importance of the street in both business and entertainment. (See Redevelopment section below, for additional Canal Street hotels.)

Two of Canal Street&#x27;s former department stores are now hotels. D. H. Holmes has become the Hyatt Centric French Quarter Hotel, and the former Maison Blanche store is now the New Orleans Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Both are on the French Quarter side of Canal.

At least two other high-rise hotels are just off Canal Street, the Roosevelt in the Central Business District (CBD) and the Monteleone in the French Quarter. In the 19th century, the St. Charles Hotel on St. Charles Avenue was another icon of the CBD.

==Redevelopment==

Both business and government leaders in New Orleans have taken steps over the past 50 years to encourage development and corporate centered business in the city. These began with the construction of the Superdome using public money, choosing not to build an expressway along the Mississippi River in the French Quarter and allowing the riverfront to be developed for tourism, and the under used wharves made available by the New Orleans public port authority for non-maritime use in the 1960s. These decisions opened the door for changes in land use, encouraging business, especially that of the tourism industry, for the city. 
The downtown New Orleans segment of Canal Street has been undergoing redevelopment along the lines called for in the Downtown Development District&#x27;s &quot;Canal Street Vision and Development Strategy&quot; (2004). In recent years the street has welcomed the addition of numerous new anchor enterprises, including the Ritz-Carlton New Orleans, luxury apartments at 1201 Canal, the New Orleans Bio-Innovation Center, the rehabilitated Joy Theater, the Saint Hotel, the Audubon Nature Institute&#x27;s Audubon Insectarium, and the Astor Crowne Plaza. In October 2011, the New Orleans City Council granted final approval for the construction of 1031 Canal, a 190-foot (58 m) multi-use high-rise at the northeast intersection of Canal and North Rampart Streets. The building, under construction as a Hard Rock Hotel, was the site of a partial building and crane collapse on October 12, 2019.

After exiting downtown, Canal Street runs for its remaining length through the Mid-City neighborhood, part of which is now designated as BioDistrict New Orleans, a state-chartered economic development district created to encourage growth in the region&#x27;s biomedical sector. Construction of two new teaching hospitals, the University Medical Center and a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs regional facility, involving the expenditure of approximately $2 billion, is now underway in the BioDistrict.

<text>The Federal Power Commission (FPC) was an independent commission of the United States government, originally organized on June 23, 1930, with five members nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The FPC was originally created in 1920 by the Federal Water Power Act, which provided for the licensing by the FPC of hydroelectric projects on the land or navigable water owned by the federal government. The FPC has since been replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The FPC also regulated interstate electric utilities and the natural gas industry.

In June 1939, President Roosevelt appointed Leland Olds to the FPC, who served as chairman from January 1940 until 1949. Under Olds’ leadership, the FPC successfully pressured electric utilities to extend power into neglected rural areas and to lower electricity rates to increase use. However his reappointment in 1949 failed in the Senate due to concerns about his suspected previous sympathy to communism.

James G. Watt was another prominent FPC commissioner, who conducted prayer meetings prior to the FPC sessions.

== Office of Chairman ==
From its founding in 1920 until its first reform in 1930, the FPC did not have its own commissioners; rather, it was chaired ex officio by the Secretaries of War, Interior, and Agriculture. The first &quot;Chairman&quot; in that sense was Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker. Before 1930, five Secretaries of War, five Secretaries of the Interior, and five Secretaries of Agriculture held title at the FPC.

Following the 1930 reforms, FPC had its own commissioners, with the following commissioners holding the title of Chairman of the Federal 
Power Commission:

<text>The Federal Power Act is a law appearing in Chapter 12 of Title 16 of the United States Code, entitled &quot;Federal Regulation and Development of Power&quot;. Enacted as the Federal Water Power Act on June 10, 1920, and amended many times since, its original purpose was to more effectively coordinate the development of hydroelectric projects in the United States. Representative John J. Esch (R-Wisconsin) was the sponsor. 

== Background ==
Prior to this time and despite federal control of navigable waters and the necessary congressional approval to construct such facilities, Congress had left the regulation of hydroelectric power to the individual states. The first federal legislation broadly dealing with hydroelectric development regarded its competition with navigation usage; with the passage of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 Congress made it illegal to dam navigable streams without a license (or permit) from them. Until 1903, these congressional permits were given away on a &#x27;first come first served&#x27; perpetual basis and controlled by the individual states. This would lead to a long debate between competing private and public development interests, and culminate in the act&#x27;s passage in 1920.

== Overview ==
The act created the Federal Power Commission (FPC) (now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) as the licensing authority for these plants. The FPC regulated the interstate activities of the electric power and natural gas industries, and coordinated national hydroelectric power activities. The Commission&#x27;s mandate called for it to maintain reasonable, nondiscriminatory and just rates to the consumer. It was ensured that 37.5% of the income derived from hydroelectric power leases given out under the Water Power Act of 1920 went to the state in which the dam was built.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates under Parts II and III of the Federal Power Act.

In 1935, the law was renamed the Federal Power Act, and the FPC&#x27;s regulatory jurisdiction was expanded to include all interstate electricity transmission and wholesale power sales (a/k/a &quot;sales for resale&quot;). The Energy Policy Act of 2005 further amended the Federal Power Act to extend FERC&#x27;s jurisdiction to certain power plant sales as well as the reliability of electric service.

Other amendments to the law include the following:
* Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) (1978)
* Energy Security Act (1980)
* Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986
* Energy Policy Act of 1992
* America&#x27;s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018

<text>Stuart Townsend (born 15 December 1972) is an Irish actor. He portrayed Lestat de Lioncourt in the film adaptation of Anne Rice&#x27;s &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; (2002), and Dorian Gray in Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (2003). In 2007, he directed the film &quot;Battle in Seattle&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Townsend was born in Howth, County Dublin, the son of Lorna Hogan, an Irish model, and Peter Townsend, an English professional golfer. His younger brother, Dylan, is also an actor.

Stuart attended the Gaiety School of Acting, Dublin, and made his non-professional stage debut in its 1993 production of Colin Teevan&#x27;s &quot;Tear Up The Black Sail&quot;. The following year he made his professional stage debut in &quot;True Lines&quot;, directed by John Crowley, which opened in Kilkenny, before moving to the Dublin Theatre Festival and on to the Bush Theatre in London. His early film roles were in Irish short films, including &quot;Godsuit&quot; and &quot;Summertime&quot;, before landing a role in the feature length film, &quot;Trojan Eddie&quot;, a 1996 Anglo-Irish co-production. In 1997 he starred in the British film, &quot;Shooting Fish&quot;.

With his portrayal of a seducer in the title role of &quot;About Adam&quot;, Townsend gained exposure in the United States. He briefly returned to the London stage in 2000, in the Tennessee Williams play &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;, starring as Val Xavier, alongside Helen Mirren as Lady Torrance, before landing roles in several major films. He appeared in &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; as the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt, and in &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; as Dorian Gray. Townsend was hired to play the part of Aragorn in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, but was replaced by Viggo Mortensen the day before principal photography began. According to Townsend:
In 2005, he starred alongside Gabrielle Union in &quot;Night Stalker&quot;, the remake of the 1974 ABC TV series &quot;&quot;. He portrayed Carl Kolchak, an investigative reporter looking into his wife&#x27;s murder. &quot;Night Stalker&quot; was abruptly cancelled by ABC after six episodes due to bad viewing figures, with some critics reportedly saying he was too young compared to Darren McGavin in the original series. The same year, Townsend had a guest starring role on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; as Karen Walker&#x27;s pansexual pastry chef who seduces her, Will Truman, and then her maid, Rosario. He also made an uncredited cameo in &quot;Æon Flux&quot; (2005). Townsend starred alongside Ryan Reynolds in &quot;Chaos Theory&quot; (2007). The same year, he made his directorial debut with &quot;Battle in Seattle&quot;, a portrayal of the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 which was protested by environmentalists, indigenous rights organizations, labor unions and anti-globalisation protesters. The film&#x27;s cast included Charlize Theron, Ray Liotta and Woody Harrelson, but enjoyed only limited release and no blockbuster support.

Townsend was set to play Fandral in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Thor&quot;, but was replaced in January 2010, due to unspecified creative differences. He appeared in the ABC thriller, &quot;Betrayal&quot;, the second season of &quot;Salem&quot;, and a 2017 episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. In 2021, Townsend starred in the films &quot;The Martini Shot&quot; and &quot;Grace and Grit&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Townsend&#x27;s father, Peter, was a golfer who played in the 1969 and 1971 Ryder Cups. He has a brother, Dylan, and sister, Chloe, from his father&#x27;s first marriage to Lorna Townsend, who died in 1994 of a brain haemorrhage. Townsend has two half-siblings, Hugo and Ella, from his father&#x27;s second marriage, to Swedish-born Sofia.

Stuart dated actress Charlize Theron after meeting her on the set of 2002&#x27;s &quot;Trapped&quot;. The couple lived together in Los Angeles and Ireland. They said they considered themselves married without an actual marriage, with Townsend stating, &quot;We didn&#x27;t have a ceremony. I don&#x27;t need a certificate or the state or the church to say otherwise. So no, there&#x27;s no big official story on a wedding, but we are married... I consider her my wife and she considers me her husband.&quot; Theron split from Townsend when they came back on day two of a planned ten-day holiday in Mexico in January 2010.

In May 2015, Townsend&#x27;s brother said that Stuart had settled down in Costa Rica, where he had bought some land and was living with a woman from that country, who was expecting their second child at that time. In 2019, Townsend was living in Santa Monica with his wife and two children, and was arrested after a domestic dispute.

<text>Asan (; ) is a city in South Chungcheong Province, South Korea. It borders the Seoul Capital Area to the north. Asan has a population of approximately 300,000.

Asan is known for its many hot springs and is a city of spas.

Asan has grown into the neighboring village, Onyang-dong, which is also known for its hot springs.

==Climate==
Asan has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm.
==Transportation==
The city of Asan shares a station for the KTX high speed trains with the directly adjacent city of Cheonan, which is thus named Cheonan-Asan Station. It takes about 30 minutes to travel from Asan to Seoul by the KTX train. It can be reached within 2 hours from Incheon International Airport by car. Seoul Metropolitan Subway extended one of its lines to service Asan on 15 December 2008. Two major highways, the Seoul-Busan and West Coast expressways, also pass through Asan.

==Economy==
It is the largest manufacturing base in Chungnam. Samsung Electronics&#x27; semiconductor division Onyang Campus, Samsung Display&#x27;s Asan Campus (formerly Tangjeong Campus) and Corning Precision Materials are located in Tangjeong, and in Inju-myeon, Hyundai&#x27;s Asan Plant and the surrounding Inju Industrial Complex are active in automotive manufacturing.

Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor, as well as Hyundai Mobis, KCC, and Hanwha Group. In addition to the large factories, Asan is also home to many medium-sized companies, including Sindorico, HL Mando, Yusung Corporation, Nongshim, and Dongseong Pharmaceuticals.

Agriculture is present, but its share has been declining over the years, and unlike its neighbours Cheonan, Seosan, Gongju, it does not have a standout speciality. Rice is the most prolific speciality, with sweet potatoes, potatoes, soybeans, wheat, barley, corn, Chinese cabbage, cucumbers, tomatoes, tomatoes, green onions, pears, grapes, and apples, and radishes, carrots, ginseng, and leaf tobacco are also grown, but not as much as the previous ones.

The livestock industry is active due to the development of hilly terrain suitable for livestock farming, and as in other regions, there is a trend of increasing scale and professionalisation, with fewer small-scale livestock farmers but more animals.

In terms of fisheries, fishing and salt-making used to take place along the coast of Asan Bay, but after the construction of the Asan Bay Sea Wall and the Sapgyo Creek Sea Wall, fishing gradually declined and salt-making disappeared. Today, inland fishing is mainly based on Asan Lake, and eel farming is carried out in Sinchang-myeon and Seonjang-myeon.

==Companies with factories in Asan==
Companies like Hyundai Motor, Samsung LCD, and Samsung Electronic have factories in Asan. A total of 14 industrial complexes are currently occupied by auto parts, electronic parts and other factories.

The Port of Pyeongtaek, closest to the east China coast among Korean ports, is nearby.

== Places of interest in Asan ==
Blue Crystal Village: The Mediterranean village is located in Tangjeong-myeon. This place, which was first a vineyard, was created as a new village with the construction of an industrial complex. The white walls and blue roofs of Santorini, Greece, are intact, and create exotic landscapes based on the architectural style of European architecture.

==Education==
Asan is the home of five universities.
* Hoseo University
* Asan Information and Technology Polytechnic College
* Seonam University
* Soonchunhyang University
* Sun Moon University

Domestic secondary schools:
* Onyang High School

International schools:

==Sport==

Asan is home of Asan Woori Bank Woori Won, a women&#x27;s basketball team competing in the Women&#x27;s Korean Basketball League. In 2016, the club was relocated from Chuncheon to Asan. K League 2 football club Asan Mugunghwa FC was based in the city from 2017 to 2019 before disbanding after the 2019 season. After the disbandment of Asan Mugunghwa, Chungnam Asan FC became the city&#x27;s professional football club and plays in the K League 2.

==Modern history==
* In 1983, an alteration of townships (ri) and towns (myeon) was made.
* In 1986, Onyang eup (town) of Asan was separated and the independent city of Onyang was created.

<text>Boryeong (; ), commonly known as Daecheon, is a city in South Chungcheong Province, South Korea. Boryeong is known around Korea for its beaches, particularly Daecheon Beach, and the annual Boryeong Mud Festival around July. The city&#x27;s beach-mud is widely touted for its cosmetic properties. As elsewhere along the southwest coast of the Korean peninsula, there are numerous small islands, many of which are connected by ferry to Daecheon Port.

Boryeong gained its present boundaries in 1995, with the merger of Boryeong-gun and Daecheon City. Previously, the two entities had been united under the name Boryeong County (Boryeong-gun) since the Joseon Dynasty and had been separated in 1986.

==History==
It is believed to have been Manro-guk during the Mahan Dynasty, and became Sinchon County in Baekje, and Seonseong County in Silla during the reign of King Gyeongdeok. During the Goryeo Dynasty, it was renamed Boryeong County, the name it still uses today.

Originally, there were three towns, Boryeong, Ocheon, and Nampo, but on 1 April 1914, it was merged into Boryeong-gun as part of the Japanese administrative reorganisation. In that year, the county government office was moved from Shinseong-ri (now Boryeong-ri) in Jupo-myeon to Daecheon-myeon.

== Toponymy ==

The city is commonly known as either Boryeong or Daecheon. The name &quot;Boryeong&quot; is older.

== Location, description ==

Boryeong is on the coast of the Yellow Sea, 171 km south of Seoul.

Its administrative district includes 12 administrative divisions: 
Cheonbuk-myeon, 
Cheongso-myeon, 
Ocheon-myeon, 
Jupo-myeon, 
Cheongra-myeon, 
Jugyo-myeon, 
Daecheon-myeon, 
Seonju-myeon, 
Nampo-myeon, 
Misan-myeon, 
Ungcheon-eup and 
Jusan-myeon.

Its territory includes a large portion of sea and numerous islands, among which the largest is Wonsando; other islands are Sapsido, Nokdo, Oeyeondo, Janggodo, Godaedo, Hodo,
and many islets.

As Seohae is a coastal area with a developed Ria coast, there are areas that have been reclaimed from the sea. If you look at Nampo-myeon, Jugyo-myeon, and Cheongcheong-myeon, there is a large farmland along the sea, which was created by reclamation.

It also includes several mountains: Seongjusan Mountain, Oseosan Mountain, Amisan Mountain and Okmasan Mountain.

==Tourism==
As it is relatively close to the capital, Daecheon Beach attracts huge crowds during the summer season. Since 1998, the Boryeong Mud Festival has been held every year in mid-July.

== Transport ==

Boryeong is located on the Janghang Line railroad, which connects it to Seoul via the Gyeongbu Line. &lt;br&gt;
Daecheon Station was opened on December 21, 2007, replacing the old station (now closed) in downtown Boryeong. It can be reached by foot, by bus or by expressway. The Janghang Line is the only railway line serving Daecheon station. The main stations served by this line are Yongsan (Seoul), Cheonan, and Iksan. Millions of people use this line to get to Daecheon every year.

The Seohaean Expressway 15 runs from Seoul through Boryeong and further south to Mokpo (102 km).

== Climate ==
== Notable sites ==
=== Daecheon Beach ===

Daecheon Beach is about 3 km away from Boryeong (up to 12 km, depending on the original or destination point). It is linked to Boryeong by a public bus line.

=== Daecheun Port ===

Daecheun Port shelters Republic of Korea Navy&#x27;s 3rd Fleet since 2013, including a patrol class corvette (1,270 t, 88.3 m length, 10 m width, 25.2 m height).

See also &quot;Incheon&quot;-class frigate and &quot;Daegu&quot;-class frigate.

=== Wosando island ===

Wosando, or Wonsan Island, formerly known as Koman Island, is the second biggest island in Chungnam Province (behind Anmyeondo in Taean County). It is accessed by a 30-minutes boat journey from Daecheon Port, landing at Jeodu. It is also connected to mainland Taean-gun by the Wonsan-Anmyeon Grand Bridge (National Highway 77) to the north, and by a 7-km long undersea tunnel to the south - the longest submarine tunnel in Korea.

The largest village is Seonchon, a 10-minutes walk away from Jeodu.
Wonsando beach has long been known for its fine quartz sand, gentle gradient, clean seawater, suitable water temperature and gentle tide due to its south-facing position. Fishing in the rocky part of the beach can bring greenlings (ray-finned fishes), arenomya (clams) and black porgy (a species of wrasse); various shellfishes can be found in the sand, and the rocks shelter &quot;Macrophthalmus&quot; (&quot;Mareotis&quot;) &quot;laevis&quot; (a species of crab). As of 2024, heavy tourist development is planned for the island.

Wonsando has 3 main specialties: the salted sand lance, the Wonsando laver and the small green onion. The mass-produced salted sand lance, well-known in Boryeong, is an anchovy with a size range between 15 cm and 25 cm, salted solely with sun-dried salt then preserved at room temperature for one year.

=== Hodo Island ===

Hodo, or Ho Island, 24 km offshore from Daecheon port, is a small and quiet island with 60 households mainly gathered in a village located on its north-east coast. It boasts a 1.5 km long, bow-shaped beach of fine sand. A good place to eat abalone, turban shell or sea urchin, the island has so far avoided tourist developments.

Hodo Island was severely affected by the 2007 oil spill in Taean area to the north. Hundreds of volunteers worked to clean the area and prevent the oil from spreading in the sea with the tides. Many of the volunteers came from the public schools as a result of a direct appeal by the South Korean government relayed through the provincial school districts.

=== Seongjusan National Forest ===

The Seongjusan National Forest (or Seongjusan Recreational Forest), east of Boryeong, is in the Charyeongsan Mountains. It is linked to the town by a bus line and can be reached by driving to the entrance of Mt. Seongjusan (&quot;san&quot; means &quot;mountain&quot; in Korean). Seongjusan&#x27;s altitude is 677 m. A hiking trail leads from the visitor&#x27;s parking area to the top and around. The water is pure and unspoiled as there are no large domesticated animals living above the flow of the water; the wooden spoon provided is used by all visitors.

=== Temples ===

There are a few Korean temples in this region, notably Seodoksa, Muryangsa, and Goransa (&quot;-sa&quot; being the Korean word for temple). &lt;br&gt;
Goransa is in an unlikely location at the bottom of a steep hill near the Han River, in the part of the province that is famous for having been the center of the Baekje Dynasty. Goransa is reached via the city of Buyeo, by car or bus. &lt;br&gt;
Muryangsa can also be reached by car or bus. &lt;br&gt;
Seodoksa can be reached by car, bus, or train.

=== Dinosaur footprint fossils ===

Dinosaur footprint fossils are found near Yeongseong Beach, on the small island of Hakseong-ri, in Cheonbuk-myeon, some 25 km north of Boryeong.

=== Other sites ===

Other notable sites are Seongjusaji temple, Ocheon Chungcheong Suyeongseong fortress, Boryeong fortress and gate, Nampo Gwanamun (gate), Oeyeondo evergreen forest, Mugunghwa Arboretum, Boryeong Museum, Cheongso station and Galmaemot catholic shrine.

=== Festivals ===

Besides the now internationally famous Boryeong Mud Festival, the area holds several other festivals:
* Cheonbuk Oyster Festival, mid December in Jangeun-ri (in Cheonbuk-myeon), about 26 km north of Boryeong
* Muchangpo Mystic Sea Road Festival, held in mid-August when the sea parts over 1.5 km between Muchangpo Beach and Seokdaedo Island at the full moon and at the end of the month, at Muchangpo Beach (in Gwandang-ri, 12 km south of Daecheon port)
* Muchangpo Shrimp &amp; Gizzard Shad Festival, held mid-September – early October in Muchangpo port (just north of Muchangpo Beach), at the time of year when the dotted gizzard shad (&quot;Konosirus punctatus&quot;) is at its fattest and most savory
* Muchangpo Jukkumi and Dodari Festival, held mid-March – early April at Muchangpo port, with a focus on jukkumi (Webfoot octopus)
* Seongjusan Autumn Leaves Festival in Meokbanggyegok-gil (Meokbanggyegok one-way street), Seongju-myeon; with drawing contest, pumbaa&#x27;s performance, youth trot song festival, prize lottery and fireworks
* Jusan Spring Flower Festival in April in Jusanbeokkot-ro (&quot;ro&quot; meaning a 2 to 7-lane street), Jusan-myeon, about 20 km south of Boryeong
* Daecheon Winter Sea Love Festival in December at Daecheon Beach, with lights &amp; Korean paper lanterns at night, fireworks...

== Economy ==
=== Mines ===
Up to the 1980s, the economy was dominated by the local mines - mainly coal but also tremolite, a highly carcinogenic element exploited for several decades since 1930 (tremolite asbestos), and other elements.

The economy slumped after the closure of the local mines around 1990. That same decade saw the first promotion of the mud from the mud flats or &quot;getbol&quot; as a medium for the development of tourism, in the hope of boosting the local economy. This started in 1994 with the creation of Daecheon Natural Mud Massage House, Boryeong&#x27;s first tourist business; 1998 saw the first Mud Festival, which was more successful than expected and has since reached international notoriety.

There is a coal mining museum near the Seongjusan National Forest, east of Boryeong. It opened in 2016.

One former mining gallery on the slopes of Seongjusan Mountain, several hundreds of meter long, has been turned into a cooling tunnel called the Boryeong Spring Cool Tunnel &amp; Rest Area. It remains at a steady temperature of around 12 °C even in summer. This is one of the former mining galleries where mushrooms are grown, and button mushrooms cultivated there are cooked on-site for dining on the spot. &lt;br&gt;
Another former mining gallery was to be transformed into an underground water-themed amusement park, but drainage problems and subsequent concerns about potential flooding led to localizing the park in Okmasan forest instead. It should open for the summer season of year 2025. But one of the abandoned tunnels will become a cold wind bath.

There are still in Boryeong 24 non-metallic mineral mining and quarrying companies, extracting stones, construction sand and gravel, or miscellaneous non-metallic minerals except fuels.

=== Agriculture ===

Western mushrooms and other mushrooms are raised in some closed mines, including the Boryeong Spring Cool Tunnel &amp; Rest Area mentioned above. Grape from the Nampo area is noted for its sweet taste. Various edible greens are produced around Misan (some 20 km south-east of Boryeong), including seasoned &quot;aster&quot;. Painted maple from the forest on Seongjusan Mountain provide their sap. Sungdong-ri in Jusan is known for its strawberries, Chungso for its chestnut trees, Jupo for its sun-dried salt.

=== Seafood ===

The economy is diverse. Seafood is still sold at the public market in Boryeong despite the rapid westernization that is occurring. Most of the produce vendors are elderly citizens. Consequently, the old and the new have collided in Boryeong, making it an example of &quot;Dynamic Korea&quot;, the governments phrase to describe Korea in the 21st century. Most of the fresh produce and seafood vendors do not have shops; they set up stalls on the sidewalks in front of other businesses. Thursdays are public market days.

=== Offshore wind farm ===

Boryeong offshore wind farm is planned,
with Komipo (Korea Midland Power) as owner and Hanwha E &amp; C as developer. The planned cost is 200 billion won for an expected production of 1.0 GW, a planned economic impact of 1 trillion won over five years and the planned creation of more than 7,500 jobs.
As of September 2023, the project is opposed by local fishermen on the grounds that it will hinder the fishing industry. The Ministry of National Defense has also expressed disapproval, stating that it will affect military radio waves, missile firing drills and radars that guard the sea. These oppositions have so far delayed the project.

As of 2024, other offshore wind farms are also planned on the west coast of South Korea: Taean (1.96 GW, for 14.9 trillion won), Boryeong 1.0 GW (6 trillion won), Boryeong Nokdo 320 MW (2 trillion won), Incheon 2.5 GW, and Jeonbuk 2.5 GW. These planned wind farms would reach a production of 8.28 GW, for a total cost of over 50 trillion won. &lt;br&gt;

<text>Cheonan (; ) is the largest and most densely populated city of South Chungcheong Province, South Korea, and the third largest city in the Hoseo region after Daejeon and Cheongju. Cheonan borders Gyeonggi Province (Pyeongtaek and Anseong) in the north, North Chungcheong Province (Jincheon County and Cheongju) to the east and southeast, Sejong to the south and Asan and Gongju to the west and southwest.

Cheonan has been called &quot;the core city of [the] nation&quot; due to its location south of the national capital, Seoul, in the northeast corner of South Chungcheong, serving as a transportation hub to the Seoul Capital Area and surrounding regions. Cheonan is connected to various freeways and railways including the National Highways 1 and 21, the Expressways 1-Gyeongbu and 25-Honam, and the city&#x27;s Korail station serves the Gyeongbu Line and the Janghang Line, with services of the KTX. Cheonan is one of the furthest places from Seoul connected to the Seoul Subway Line 1.

==History==

Cheonan has always been a major transportation hub of Korea because of its proximity to Seoul and its location near a gap in the eastern mountain range () that allows passage through to the major southeast centers of Daegu and Busan. Cheonan&#x27;s Samgeori (meaning &quot;3-way intersection&quot;) park has been noted as a strategic point of transportation and a place where culture has spread for a long time. It is the place where Samnamdaero, which starts in Seoul, parts, leading one branch of the road through to the south-eastern Yeongnam region (which includes Gimcheon, Daegu, Gyeongju and Dongnae), and leading the other through Gongju and Nonsan to the Honam region (which includes Jeonju, Gwangju, Suncheon, and Yeosu).

Due to its strategic location, Cheonan has also been an important postal center where early communications from the south converged before heading to Seoul, or where messages from the capital diverged into the southern regions. More formal and structured mail services later emerged with the construction of the city&#x27;s first postal outlets, and the entire history of mail service in Cheonan (and in South Korea in general since 1883) is now on display in the country&#x27;s largest postal museum in Yang-ji-mal in eastern Cheonan.

Cheonan was a relatively small town for much of the early half of the 20th century. As a transportation center, it was the site of an early engagement in the Korean War, the Battle of Cheonan. Then, in 1963 three municipal districts in the area that were growing in size were merged and promoted to the category of si, meaning city, by order of Law No 1176. Thus the City of Cheonan was born, comprising the populations of Cheonan-gun, Cheonan-eup and Hwanseong-myeon. Over the next two decades, the city grew in size by incorporating neighboring populations, including that of Byeongcheon-myeon in 1973. In 1975 the city renamed 10 branch offices to 10 dongs, representing the major administrative regions of the city. The city continued to expand, absorbing neighboring ri, myeon, and eup, including Pungse-myeon and Guryong-ri in the early 80s. Throughout this time, new neighborhoods to the southwest that were collectively known as Cheonan-gun, such as Ssangbong-dong, also grew in population, and in 1995 Cheonan-gun and Cheonan-si were merged into one large Cheonan-si. Larger dong that comprised the city were subsequently separated into smaller factions, such as Ssangbong-dong into Bongmyong-dong and Ssangyong, which itself was later separated into Ssangyong 1(il)-dong and Ssangyong 2(i)-dong (and then again into Ssangyong 2(i)-dong and Ssangyong 3-dong in 2003). In 2002 a city ordinance promoted the northern fringe village of Jiksan-myeon and the southern fringe village of Mokcheon-myeon into Jiksan-eup and Mokcheon-eup. This extended the boundaries of the city to a span of approximately 16 kilometers from north (at Jiksan) to south (at Mokcheon), and about 12 kilometers from Sunmoon University in the west to Mount Taejo on the eastern fringe. Including all of its administrative regions (see below), the city now covers a total area of 636.25 km2.

==Geography==
The city is flanked to the east by the Charyeong Mountains, and spills out over plains and rolling hills to the west. Some of the mountains in the city&#x27;s vicinity include Malloesan (611m), Seonggeosan (579m), Taejosan (422m), Heukseongsan (519m), Gwangdeoksan (699m), and Manggyeongsan (600m). The city itself is generally flat, with only a few areas, such as Anseon-dong, that are built up on hilly terrain.

To the west is the city of Asan, to the north are the cities of Anseong and Pyeongtaek in Gyeonggi Province, to the south is the county of Sejong and the city of Gongju, and to the east of the city are the counties of Jincheon and Cheongwon in North Chungcheong Province.

Cheonan is growing as a gateway to Chungcheongnam-do and a city behind the Seoul metropolitan area, located 83.6 kilometers south of Seoul on the highway. Gyeongbu Line connects north and south, and Janghang Line connects to the southwest. Land routes connect to Seoul, Daejeon, Sejong, Gongju, Asan, Jincheon, Pyeongtaek, and Anseong.

===Climate===
Cheonan has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm. The climate is similar to that of neighboring Seoul, Suwon, or Daejeon, and is considered temperate Eastern margin with periods of monsoon. Cheonan experiences a four-season weather cycle, with moderately high summer temperatures and moderately low temperatures and snowfall in winter.
The average temperature in the city is 12.5 °C, with a recorded high of 34.2 °C and a low of -13.4 °C.

==Cultural Infrastructure==
===Museums===

The Independence Hall of Korea is a visual history of the struggle for independence in Korea. Opened on August 15, 1987 and made possible by private donations, it is a meant both as a reminder of Korea&#x27;s colonial past and as a means of building nationalist spirit. The hall stands on of landscaped grounds. As well as the exhibits, visitors can see the Grand Hall of the Nation, the Monument to the Nation, and the Unification Bell.

Cheonan&#x27;s Postal Museum displays postal artifacts and material dating back to 1884, when the first postal services began. The entire history of the Korean postal service is on display, complete with photographs and letter carrying paraphernalia. The museum was not constructed here, but rather moved from Seoul in February 2004 to its current home in the Ministry of Information and Communication Officials Training Institute in Cheonan.

===Temples===
Gagwonsa Buddhist temple is located on Mt. Taejosan. Located on the temple grounds is a large bronze sitting Buddha, which is 15m high, 30m in circumference, and weighs over 60 tonnes. The Buddha sits with the peak of Mt. Taejosan directly behind it, and faces west out over the city and valley. Worshippers and tourists alike climb the steep stairs from the base of the mountain.

Mt. Taejosan is also home to the smaller Seong-bul-sa temple.

In the southwest of the city, near the city&#x27;s border with neighboring Asan, sits Hyeonchung-sa Temple, a large complex that houses a main temple and an elaborate garden. The temple was built by Confucian scholars and is a shrine to Admiral Yi Sun-sin (his grave is located on the grounds). The temple and grounds also house a number of National Treasures.

===Parks===
Samgeori park has been a strategic point of transportation and a place where culture has spread for a long time. The Samnamdaero, which starts in Seoul, parts here. One branch of the road leads to the Yeongnam region. The other branch leads to the Honam region.

Haneulgeori is a resting area for the animal residents of Cheonan Samgeori Park, and it provides scenery for visitors with its willow trees and small pond.

Taejosan Park is located at Mt. Taejosan. The park covers an area of over 327,000 square meters. Visitors there may find a sculpture park, six camp sites, a grass field, tennis courts, and an outdoor performance area. There are many facilities for youths and families, and residents use the area for rest and relaxation. For hikers and day-walkers, there is also a very extensive trail network. The park also encompasses the Joabulsang Bronze Buddha statue and the Gagwonsa Buddhist Temple.

===Galleries===
Arario Gallery, reopened in 2002, is an addition to a revitalized Shinbu-dong area, which has become the central business district of Cheonan. The gallery itself showcases contemporary art from Korean and international artists. Organic works, including those painted with raw materials or organic substances (like fruit and vegetables) are the norm. The gallery&#x27;s stated mission is to provide a special place for people of all ages and background to easily view and learn about art. There is also an installation of Damien Hirst&#x27;s &quot;Hymn&quot; in a glass box constructed as a part of the building.

===Sports===
The city is home to association football club Cheonan FC]] of the National League. They play at the Cheonan Football Center. There are basketball courts, especially in the Ssangyong-dong area, as well as public tennis courts, and plenty of driving ranges for golf enthusiasts.

Cheonan is also home to a 26,000 capacity stadium called the Cheonan Baekseok Stadium. It hosted the South Korea national football team vs. Mali in October 2013.

Cheonan is home to volleyball club Cheonan Hyundai Capital Skywalkers. Cheonan Yu-gwansun Stadium is their home ground. Now Cheonan is called &quot;Volleyball metropolitan city&quot; because of their popularity.

===Food===
Cheonan is known for small walnut-shaped and flavored cakes, or &quot;hodugwaja&quot;, which are produced in the area. It is common when leaving from or passing through Cheonan Station by train to see many merchants selling hodugwaja.

Cheonan is also known for several agricultural products including melons, grapes and ya pears.

===Festivals===
Cheonan&#x27;s most well-known festival is Heungtaryeong Festival (). 흥 means pleasure and joy in the Korean language, and usually refers to Korean music.

The dancing festival is the essence of the events from B-boy to traditional dances from India, Africa, Australia, Ukraine. Many teams also participate in the festival from 17 other nations such as China and Japan.

The festival started in 2003 and it received the position of &quot;prepared&quot; and &quot;promising&quot; in 2006 and 2007, respectively. As of 26 December 2007, the festival was promoted to the degree of &quot;excellent festival&quot; or &quot;우수축제.&quot;

To mark the historic March 1 Independence Movement, characterized in Cheonan by Yu Gwansun, each year a re-enactment of independence protests is staged at Aunae Marketplace. The popular movement began with the lighting of 24 beacons at Mt. Maebongsan and other mountains on March 31, 1919. The following day, 3,000 people gathered at Aunae Marketplace and protested for independence. Japanese security forces arrived and 19 people were shot dead on the spot, including Yu Gwansun&#x27;s parents, with dozens more injured. These days people gather peacefully together in remembrance. Then a torch parade, symbolizing the lit beacons, slowly creeps from Aunae Market place through Byeongcheon and on to the Yu Gwansun Memorial.

On the eighth day of the fourth month of the Lunar Calendar each year, Buddhists celebrate the first coming of Buddha. In Cheonan, local temples decorate their buildings and grounds with illuminated paper lanterns, and much of the city centre is closed to traffic for a parade followed by musical acts and a traditional drumming show. Koreans often dress in their Hanboks, a traditional Korean costume, and spend the day with friends and family wandering through the pedestrian-friendly streets and lanes on the city core.

==Transportation==
The city is very well-connected to Seoul by road but also by train through two train stations. The first is Cheonan Station and the second, (served by the KTX high speed railway) is Cheonan-Asan Station. Different areas in Cheonan are also served by Seoul Subway Line 1.

==Economy==
The local economy is fuelled to a great extent by tech sector companies in the area. Large national corporations such as Samsung, LG Group, Corning Inc., and several technology companies all have operations in Cheonan. The large number of universities also contributes to an influx of spending, as students from around Korea flock here for eight months of the year.

==Administrative districts and divisions==
Cheonan is divided into 2 &quot;gu&quot;, and 16 administrative &quot;dong&quot; (subdivided into 30 distinct legal &quot;dong&quot;), 4 &quot;eup&quot; and 8 &quot;myeon&quot;.

The divisions of Dongnam District (Southeast) and Seobuk District (Northwest) are shown here:

==Population diversity==
Even with scores of Korean students graduating from the many tech programs at local universities, the demand for tech sector employees is still very high, and much of that demand is filled by foreign employees. The city is now home to a large foreign population, which has tripled over the past 5 years. There are more than 9,000 foreigners residing in the Cheonan area.

In addition, Cheonan is the site of the prison exclusively intended for foreign prisoners, with more than 1,000 foreign inmates.

<text>Nonsan (; ) is a city in South Chungcheong Province, South Korea. It is located at . The origin of Nonsan&#x27;s geographical names is said to have come from the small garden &quot; Nolmoe, &quot; which rises in the middle of farming fields, where rice paddies and mountain are said to reflect geographical features. The city belongs to the Daejeon Metropolitan Area.

==History==
Nonsan has a significant history. During the Samhan period, Nonsan is believed to have been part of Mahan territory. In the Baekje period, the district belonged to Hwangdeungyasan-gun. The crucial battle in which Silla defeated Baekje is thought to have taken place in the general area of Nonsan. Later, in the Silla period, Nonsan was divided into two different towns: Deogeun and Hwangsan.

The train station was built in 1911, in the same year as the rail line through the Nonsan plain was completed.

The modern city of Nonsan was established in 1914, by the merger of the four counties of Yeonsan-gun, Eunjin-gun, Noseong-gun and Seoksung-gun.

During the Korean War, a POW camp was set up by the U.S. and South Korean forces. On June 18, 1953, at the Nonsan camp as well as at POW camps at Busan, 
Masan, and Kwangju, thousands of POWs swarmed out of the camps and melted into the local population in order to avoid being repatriated to North Korea.

==Transportation==
Nonsan is served by the national railroad system and city, regional and national bus lines. An expressway connects the city to Daejeon and other cities. Many streets have bike paths, sharing pavement with sidewalks. The stream running through the city proper is not navigable, but downstream it joins the Geum River, and an outlying subdivision of the city serves as a significant fishing port.

Chungcheong Metropolitan Railroad is proposed, in the third phase, to set Ganggyeong Station for the starting point and connect the city with Gyeryong, Daejeon, and Cheongju.

==Economics and industry==
Nonsan is an agricultural city, with rice being the most important crop. Other important crops include strawberries, ginseng, napa cabbage,
watermelons, and Korean pears.
According to &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot;, the farmers are growing new varieties of strawberry produced in Japan without the producer&#x27;s permission, while the &quot;JoongAng Daily&quot; says &quot;Strawberries grown in Nonsan are of various types: seolhyang, maehyang, geumhyang, janghi (akihime) and yukbo (red pearl). The first three were developed in Nonsan while the latter two are from Japan. Janghi is the most commonly grown in Korea. However, seolhyang is the sweetest&quot;. Sesil [pronounced &quot;say -shill&quot;] company is the world&#x27;s third leading producer of insects for natural pest control. The prominent yogurt company, Yakult, has its headquarters in Nonsan. Agro-Fisheries Trade Corp. is a regional supplier of food products.

The greater Nonsan area includes the ROK Army training center ().

<doc id="967892" wikidata="Q42105" url="?curid=967892" title="Seosan">
<text>Seosan (; ) is a city in South Chungcheong Province, South Korea, with a population of roughly 175,000 according to the 2017 census. Located at the northwestern end of South Chungcheong Province, it is bounded by Dangjin, Naepo New Town, Yesan-gun and Hongseong-gun on the east, Taean-gun and the Yellow Sea on the west, south of Seoul, northwest of Daejeon and northwest of Naepo New Town. Seosan is the hub of transportation on the west coast where the Seohaean Expressway, Daejeon-Dangjin Expressway, and National Highways No. 29, 32, 38, and 45 intersect.

== Culture and tourism ==
Although Seosan itself is fairly quiet and attracts relatively few tourists, there are a number of minor attractions in the rural areas outside of Seosan, most of which can be accessed within twenty minutes by car, or in an hour by bicycle. Many of these historic sites are well-known only among the locals and often have few visitors, which can make them appealing to those wishing to escape the crowded palaces and temples of Korea&#x27;s major cities. For an exhaustive list of tourist attractions in the Seosan-Haemi area, detailed English-language maps are available at the Seosan Intercity Bus Terminal.

=== Haemieupseong Fortress (해미읍성) ===
Located in Haemi-eup, approximately from Seosan (15 minutes by car or local bus; 45 minutes by bike), Haemieupseong Fortress is among the best-preserved examples of Korea&#x27;s Joseon-era fortress architecture, and unlike most Joseon-era fortifications, it was built on a flat plain rather than on a hill or mountain. Haemieupseong Fortress was completed in 1491 (the 22nd year of King Seongjong&#x27;s reign) and surrounded the entirety of Haemi-eup at the time of its completion. The fortress was used as a military command post controlling the Chuncheong-do region and provided defense against Japanese pirates along Korea&#x27;s western coast. As the town of Haemi expanded in the early 20th century, much of the fortress was torn down to allow additional urban development, but a major restoration work was undertaken in 1973. Today, the South Gate of Haemieupseong Fortress is original, along with certain parts of the walls, while the other gates are reconstructions. Along with Yeosutgol, Haemieupseong Fortress is considered to be a Holy Ground among Korean Catholics due to the Byeongin Persecutions of 1866, during which many Catholics living in the Chuncheong area were killed at the fortress.

=== Yeosutgol Holy Ground (해미순교성지) ===
Approximately 200 meters from Haemieupseong Fortress is the Yeosutgol Holy Ground, where Korean Catholics were buried alive, drowned and otherwise killed en masse during the Byeongin Persecutions. Although most of the site&#x27;s remains were washed away by flooding, some of them were rediscovered in 1935. The site now contains a large memorial hall devoted to those who were martyred for their faith and is now a major Catholic pilgrimage site.

=== Yeonghyeon-ri Rock-carved Buddha Triad (용현리 마애여래삼존상) ===
During the Three Kingdoms period (~ 57 BCE – 668 CE), the Seosan-Haemi area was under the control of Baekje, and although there are very few ruins from this period in the Seosan-Haemi area, the Yeonghyeon-ri Rock-carved Buddha triad is a phenomenal exception. Carved in either the late 6th or early 7th century CE, the carving consists of a Buddha standing on a lotus leaf, flanked by two Bodhisattva. Although this carving has been designated a National Treasure of Korea, it receives relatively few visitors due to its isolation. The carving is best viewed in the morning, when the entirety of the triad is illuminated by the rising sun, and is accessible by local buses from Seosan and Unsan-ri, or by a half-hour drive or ninety-minute bike ride directly from Seosan. 
=== Bowonsa (보원사지) ===
Built during the Unified Silla period (668 – 935 CE), this small temple contains an iconic Baekje-style Pagoda, as well as a number of monuments which were added when the temple was expanded during the Goryeo period (918 – 1392 CE) and is considered to be a National Treasure of Korea. Bowonsa is about 500 meters from the Yeonghyeon-ri Rock-carved Buddha Triad and is a quiet place for relaxation and meditation. 
=== Gaesimsa (개심사) ===
Built in 1484 (the 15th year of King Seongjong&#x27;s reign), Gaesimsa is one of only a handful of wooden buildings in Korea which date past the 17th century. The temple houses an Amitabha Buddha statue carved in the 14th century, as well as a hanging mural painted in the 15th century, both of which have won Gaesimsa the title of National Treasure of Korea. At the temple&#x27;s rear is a mountain path which links to the Aramegil Hiking Trails, and can be used to reach Bowonsa and Yeonghyeon-ri on foot within a 90–120-minute hike. 

==Climate==
As with most of South Korea, Seosan has a humid subtropical climate/humid continental climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;/&quot;Dfa&quot;). In spring, mild temperatures are accompanied by strong winds bearing dust from the Chinese mainland. This unpleasant dust is named Hwangsa () or Asian Dust and prompts many Seosanites to wear face masks when walking or cycling. Seosan and the surrounding area are quite beautiful in Spring, however, particularly in the mountains and in Seosan&#x27;s Lake Park. In summer, the monsoon season lasts about three weeks in June or July and is characterized by very strong winds and heavy rainfall, although the severity of both of these phenomena has been decreasing in recent years. Seosan may be affected by mild typhoons during the summer season, as was the case in 2010, when Seosan was damaged by typhoon &#x27;Kompasu&#x27;. Fall typically begins in mid-September and temperatures begin to drop rapidly by November. Snow generally appears in late November or early December, and continues until late February or early March. With the exception of occasional snow storms, snowfall is generally very mild and rarely causes inconveniences for local traffic. The average temperature in Seosan is 11.8 degrees Celsius.
== Education ==
Hanseo University (), a private university established in 1992, has 8,500 students and 50 departments that are staffed by 250 full-time faculty members. It is located about south-east of Haemi-eup and can be reached in 15 minutes by a local bus from Haemi. The university provides courses in Chiropractic, a wide range of liberal arts, design, and engineering disciplines, and hosts aviation and flight-training schools.

== Cityscape ==
==Transportation==
Seosan is served by Express and Intercity buses. Under optimal conditions, Express buses can reach Seoul&#x27;s Gangnam Terminal in approximately 90 minutes, but can take up to 2.5 hours in the event of heavy traffic. Express buses to Seoul&#x27;s Gangnam Terminal depart every half-hour, while intercity buses to other locations depart every hour.

Seosan does not have a railway station; the nearest station is Hongseong Station, on the Janghang Line, approximately south of Seosan.

A number of local buses serve the Seosan-Haemi area, with a fare between 960 and 1450 won.

==Sport==
Seosan Baseball Stadium, the second team stadium of the Hanwha Eagles, has been built in Seosan Techno Valley, allowing the people of Seosan to enjoy professional baseball. The distance from Daejeon to Seosan is 1 hour and 30 minutes, but it is a welcome addition for the second team players who have been training without a second team stadium.

Previously, there was a national league football club, Seosan Citizens, founded in 2002, but it was disbanded in the 2008 budget and replaced by Seosan FC, an amateur football club founded in 1981.

<text>Marvin Eugene Throneberry (September 2, 1933 – June 23, 1994) was an American Major League Baseball player. Affectionately known as &quot;Marvelous Marv&quot;, he was the starting first baseman for the 1962 New York Mets, a team which set the modern record for most losses in a season with 120 until that record was broken by the Chicago White Sox with 121 in 2024. Throneberry became a well-known figure after appearing in numerous Miller Lite beer commercials in the 1970s and 1980s.

==Early years==
The left-handed batting and throwing native of Fisherville, Tennessee was a two-time all-city baseball player at South Side High School in Memphis. After turning down an offer to play alongside his older brother, Faye, with the Boston Red Sox, he signed as an amateur free agent with the New York Yankees in May . During his playing days, he was listed as tall and .

==Minor league slugger==
Throneberry played the outfield early in his minor league career, and shifted to first base in with the Kansas City Blues. He was one of the most feared minor league sluggers of the 1950s, and led the Blues with 21 home runs. The following season, he led the Triple-A American Association with 36 home runs and 117 runs batted in as a member of the Denver Bears. That September, he received a call up to the Casey Stengel led New York Yankees. Throneberry made his major league debut as a pinch runner for Eddie Robinson on September 25, at Fenway Park. He remained in the game at first, and hit a sacrifice fly that scored Andy Carey in his first major league plate appearance. In his first official at bat in the seventh inning, Throneberry hit a bases loaded double that scored two more, and later came around to score himself on a Bob Cerv single. All told, Throneberry went 2-for-2, with a double, run scored and three RBIs. His brother struck out three times for the Red Sox in the same game.

He returned to the Denver Bears in , and once again led the American Association with 42 home runs and 145 RBIs. The following season, he clubbed 40 home runs, and drove in 124, tying an American Association record for leading the league in home runs and RBIs for three consecutive seasons.

==New York Yankees==
Throneberry made it back to the majors for good in . He collected his first hit of the season, a double off the Baltimore Orioles&#x27; Ken Lehman in his tenth at bat. Seeing most of his action as a pinch hitter or late inning defensive replacement at first, an injury to Bill Skowron on May 11 landed Throneberry in the starting line up through the rest of May. He hit his first major league home run off the Chicago White Sox&#x27;s Bill Fischer on May 20. For the season, Throneberry batted .227 with seven home runs and 19 RBIs in 60 games. He reached the post season for the only time in his career as a rookie, and was struck out by Lew Burdette in his only at bat of the World Series.

Though he saw more playing time in , he was batting just .184 with three home runs and ten RBIs when Skrowron&#x27;s season was ended by a fractured wrist. Throneberry responded by batting .286 with five home runs and twelve RBIs the rest of the way. After the season, he was part of the blockbuster trade that sent 1956 World Series hero Don Larsen, Hank Bauer and Norm Siebern to the Kansas City Athletics for power-hitting outfielder Roger Maris, Joe DeMaestri and Kent Hadley.

==Kansas City A&#x27;s==
Throneberry began the season as a pinch-hitter, with Siebern, an outfielder with the Yankees and, like Throneberry, a left-handed hitter, starting at first base through the first five weeks of the campaign. Throneberry made only two starts in the field through May 23 and his batting average was a poor .176 with no extra-base hits. But on May 24 at Municipal Stadium, he was inserted into the lineup at first base (Siebern moved to left field) and Throneberry went three for four, with a homer, double and triple, driving in three runs and leading the Athletics to a 6–2 victory over the Red Sox. Starting assignments in late May and early June yielded three more homers. Finally, on June 21, Athletics manager Bob Elliott moved Siebern to left field on a semi-permanent basis and installed Throneberry at first base. Facing almost exclusively right-handed pitching (he had 28 at bats against southpaws all year), Throneberry batted .250 with eleven home runs and 41 RBIs in , making 55 starts at first base. At home at Kansas City&#x27;s Municipal Stadium, Throneberry batted .303 with 26 RBIs. On the road, his batting average fell to .205. Midway through the season, he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for left fielder Gene Stephens.

==Baltimore Orioles==
With an All-Star MVP candidate who batted left-handed in Jim Gentile at first base, the Orioles used Throneberry mostly as a pinch hitter or in right field. On June 13, his ninth inning pinch hit single drove in Dick Hall for the walk off victory over the Washington Senators. On June 27, he went 3-for-4 with two home runs and three RBIs against his former teammates in Kansas City to lead the O&#x27;s to a 5–3 victory. Seventeen games into the season, the Orioles traded him to the expansion New York Mets for a player to be named later and cash. The Mets sent catcher Hobie Landrith, their first selection in the 1961 Major League Baseball expansion draft, to the Orioles to complete the deal.

==New York Mets==
Reunited with Manager Casey Stengel, Throneberry got his first chance as a regular. On May, in his first game as a Met, Throneberry went 1-for-4, and scored a run in the ninth in an 8–5 loss to the Milwaukee Braves. He would not see home plate again until June 9, when he went 3-for-4 with a run scored and his first RBI as a Met in an 11–6 victory over the Chicago Cubs.

The 1962 Mets may not have won many games, but these &quot;Lovable losers&quot; won the hearts of sports fans, and no one exemplified that more than Throneberry. Many humorous stories surfaced about Throneberry, who facetiously came to be known as &quot;Marvelous Marv.&quot; While it is likely that many of these stories are exaggerated or false, they helped turn Throneberry into almost legendary status among Mets fans. The fact of his initials spelling &quot;MET&quot; accentuated all anecdotes. Throneberry maintained a sense of humor about his play and became a favorite with fans and the media (after the season, he received the Ben Epstein Memorial &quot;Good Guy&quot; Award). At one point he had a fan club which numbered around 5,000 members. They wore shirts with the word &quot;VRAM&quot; (Marv backwards) and took up chanting &quot;Cranberry, Strawberry, we love Throneberry.&quot;

In one famous story, on June 17, Throneberry hit a triple against the Cubs, but was called out after Ernie Banks took a relay throw and stepped on second base. &quot;Didn&#x27;t touch the bag, you know, Dusty,&quot; Banks told umpire Dusty Boggess. According to the legend, Throneberry was called out at second and Stengel came out to argue the call, but he was told by the umpire &quot;Don&#x27;t bother arguing, Casey, he missed first base, too.&quot; (In another version of the story, Stengel was told this by his first-base coach.) Stengel, after a pause, supposedly replied, &quot;Well, I know he touched third base because he&#x27;s standing on it!&quot; The next batter, Charlie Neal, hit a home run, prompting Stengel to come out of the dugout following him and pointing at all four bases. Throneberry&#x27;s mistake proved costly, as the Cubs won the game 8–7.

In the second game of a June 22 doubleheader with fellow expansion club, the Houston Colt .45s, Throneberry committed three of six Mets errors. On August 2, Throneberry had his second career two-home-run game in a 9–4 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies.

His 16 home runs and 49 RBIs in 1962 were both career highs; however, he also committed 17 errors at first base. His fielding percentage of .981 would not be equaled by a major-league regular first baseman until César Cedeño fielded .981 in 1979 for the Houston Astros.

During the off-season, the Mets acquired Tim Harkness from the Los Angeles Dodgers. Harkness assumed the starting first base job, with Throneberry relegated to pinch hitting duty. After going just 2-for-15 through May 5, he was demoted to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. While clubbing 16 home runs for Buffalo, he batted just .176. He batted .083 in eight games in before being released.

==Career statistics==

Throneberry hit 201 minor league home runs with a .269 batting average. With the exception of one rough year defensively, Throneberry was no worse than average with his career fielding percentage and range factor (8.01) as a first baseman.

==Miller Lite commercials==
&quot;Marvelous Marv&quot; later became one of the original spokesmen for Miller Lite beer in the mid-1970s, poking fun at himself in a series of TV commercials. Throneberry&#x27;s most famous line: &quot;If I do for Lite what I did for baseball, I&#x27;m afraid their sales will go down.&quot; In another popular ad, after other celebrities are shown, Throneberry is shown at the end, saying: &quot;I still don&#x27;t know why they asked me to do this commercial.&quot;

Columnist Jimmy Breslin quipped, &quot;Having Marv Throneberry play for your team is like having Willie Sutton work for your bank.&quot;

==Personal life==
Throneberry died of cancer on June 23, in Fisherville, Tennessee, at age 60. He and his wife, Dixie had five children, ten grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. One of his grandchildren is filmmaker Craig Brewer. In , Throneberry was inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>Albert Paul Shenar (February 12, 1936 − October 11, 1989) was an American actor and theater director best known for his portrayals of Jenner in Don Bluth&#x27;s &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; (1982) and Alejandro Sosa in &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983).

A veteran Broadway and Shakespearean actor, he was one of the twenty-seven founding members of the American Conservatory Theater.

==Early life==
Shenar was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the second of four boys (one older brother John, two younger brothers Michael and Marc), born from Mary Rosella (née Puhek) and Eugene Joseph Shenar. He was of Polish and Slovene descent.

==Career==
Shenar became involved in theater at an early age, working in Milwaukee playhouse productions. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Air Force. Following his military career he began acting again. Shenar gained attention playing larger-than-life entertainment legends in late 1970s television films—Orson Welles in &quot;The Night That Panicked America&quot; and Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., in &quot;Ziegfeld: The Man and His Women&quot;. He portrayed the character John Carrington in Part II of the miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;.

A founding member, actor, director and teacher of the American Conservatory Theater (ACT) in San Francisco, he played more than forty roles there, including &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and Brother Julian in &quot;Tiny Alice&quot;. In 1982, he portrayed Jenner, the main antagonist of Don Bluth&#x27;s &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;; his performance in the film impressed Bluth so much that he wanted Shenar to also portray &quot;Space Ace&quot;″s main antagonist, Commander Borf, but was unable to do so due to budget issues and the role ultimately went to Bluth himself.

In 1983, Shenar also portrayed Alejandro Sosa in Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Scarface&quot; and later portrayed Paulo Rocca in &quot;Raw Deal&quot;.

Shenar continued to act during the late 1980s. He did a stage version of &quot;Macbeth&quot; in Los Angeles and appeared in films like &quot;Best Seller&quot; (1987), &quot;The Bedroom Window&quot; (1987), &quot;The Big Blue&quot; (1988), plus the TV film &quot;Rage of Angels: The Story Continues&quot;.

==Personal life==
Shenar was gay, and was romantically involved with the British actor Jeremy Brett during the 1970s; they were in a relationship that reportedly lasted from 1973 to 1978. After the couple separated, they remained close friends until Shenar&#x27;s death in 1989.

==Death==
In 1983, Shenar was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. He died from AIDS on October 11, 1989, at age 53. His remains were cremated and given to his executor, Thomas Wiley.

<text>Geumsan County () is a county in South Chungcheong Province (Before 1963, Geumsan was in Jeollabuk-do), South Korea. It borders Muju County, North Jeolla Province (Jeollabuk-do), which is famous for its ski resort nearby.

==History==
Administrative district name, Geumsan-gun, have nowadays was originate from the union of old Geumsan-gun and Jinsan-gun on March 1, 1914. The old Geumsan-gun was in Baekje Age called Jinnae-gun or &quot;Jinnaeeul-gun&quot;, and after Silla unified Three Kingdoms of Korea, its name was changed to &quot;Jinye-gun&quot; during the reign of King Gyeongdeok. In 1305 (Goryeo King Chungnyeol 31st year) it was promoted to Geumju-gun, including 5 hyeons, &quot;Buri-hyeon&quot;, &quot;Cheonggeo-hyeon&quot;, &quot;Mupung-hyeon&quot;, &quot;Jindong-hyeon&quot;, with Geumju governor to govern it. (Goryeosa 57th volume) In 1413 (Joseon Dynasty Taejong 13th year), (Geumju-gun) had its name changed to Geumsan-gun until the end of Joseon Age.

The old Jinsan-gun was in Baekjae Age called Jindong-hyeon. When Silla unified 3 nations, it became a subject hyeon of Hwangsan-gun.

It was changed to Okgyeo-bu in early Goryeo Age, and then became a part of Geumju-gun in 1305 (Goryeo King Chungnyeol 31st year).

In 1390, it had become a subject hyeon of Gosan-hyeon. During the Joseon dynasty, in 1393 (Taejo 2nd year), after burying the umbilical cord of Taejo in Maninsan Mountain, it was promoted to Jinju-gun and was governed by Jinju governor. In 1413 (Joseon Taejong 13th year) its name was again changed to Jinsan-gun. On August 4, 1896, as 13 dos were executed according to Royal Order 36th, Geumsan-gun and Jinsan-gun, which were a part of Gongju-bu, South Chungcheong Province, were incorporated into North Jeolla Province. As mentioned above, on March 1 of 1914(under Zenrahoku-dō), Jinsan-gun was united into the current Geumsan-gun. It first consisted of 10 myeons: Geumsanmyeon, Geumseong-myeon, Jewon-myeon, Buri-myeon, Gunbuk-myeon, Namil-myeon, Nami-myeon, Jinsan-myeon, Boksu-myeon, and Chubu-myeon. However, on November 1 of 1940, according to Ordinance 221st, Geumsan-myeon was promoted to Geumsan-eub, thus making one eub and nine myeons.

Later on January 1 of 1963, following the administrative district reorganization according to the law about the change of district boundaries (Law 1172nd) of Seoul-si, do, gun, gu, Geumsan-gun was incorporated into Chungcheongnam-do from Jeollabuk-do.

Geumsan-gun is famous for ginseng since late Goryeo Dynasty and nowaday it also has one of the biggest market of ginseng and medicinal herbs in Korea. Even though it doesn&#x27;t produce as much ginseng as it did in the old days, it still produces more than 80% of ginseng distributed across South Korea.

==Climate==
Geumsan has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm.
==Tourism==
There is Daedunsan Provincial Park. Seodae Mountain (904 metres above sea level), the highest mountain in Chungcheongnam-do, is also located here. There is also the Chilbak Gun, a tomb of 700 soldiers, including Cho Heon, a medical officer, and Yeongyu, a captain, who were martyred during the Imjin War (Battle of Geumsan). If you like fishing, you can kill two birds with one stone by fishing for bass in the Hwalim Forest and preserving the ecosystem.

Famous temples include Taegosa Temple and Jewellery Temple, which were built during the Silla Dynasty.

The World Insam Festival is held from September to October every year.

*Boseoksa
==Economy==

Geumsam is home to one of Hankook&#x27;s production facilities. It is said to be the largest tyre production plant in the world.

<doc id="967902" wikidata="Q3110346" url="?curid=967902" title="Magician (Feist novel)">
<text>Magician is a fantasy novel by American writer Raymond E. Feist. It is the first book of the Riftwar Saga and of the wider Riftwar Cycle. &quot;Magician&quot; was originally published in 1982. The book is set in a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;–style fantasy world called Midkemia, originally invented by Feist and his friends during college. The story follows the early life of friends Pug and Tomas as their world is overtaken by war against alien invaders who appear via portals.

==Background==
&quot;Magician&quot; is Feist&#x27;s first published novel, written in the years after he graduated from University of California, San Diego. At university he was a fan of role-playing games and regularly played with his friends. The name and broad idea for Midkemia came from a group of friends who invented the world and some of the core mechanics, such as the magic system. Prior to starting work on Magician, Feist had written some short and &quot;light-hearted&quot; stories about the world they had created.

Feist graduated in 1977 and began work in the healthcare industry. At this time, he had the idea for a novel involving a boy magician and began to write. At some point, Feist lost his job; however, his friends bankrolled the effort to complete Magician. The book was finished by 1979 and published in 1982 by Doubleday books. &#x27;
&quot;Magician&quot; was separated into two volumes for the United States market and published as: Magician: Apprentice and Magician: Master. It was republished in 1992 in a 10th Anniversary edition entitled &quot;The Author&#x27;s Preferred Edition&quot; containing scenes that had been cut from the original. Feist wanted to re-issue the low circulation original hardcover and his publisher, Lou Aronica, said &quot;he would only do it with new material&quot; so Feist restored some scenes he felt were important while expanding or rewriting other material.

As well as being based on the world invented with his friends at university, &quot;Magician&quot; has a number of other influences. The book contains a number of common fantasy tropes but also draws from other ideas; writing in &quot;Foundation&quot;, Hannu Hiilos draws parallels to the work of James Fenimore Cooper and the story of Robin Hood. Feist acknowledged that the Tekumel setting from M. A. R. Barker&#x27;s &quot;Empire of the Petal Throne&quot; was the source for much of the world of Kelewan. The original D&amp;D campaign which he based his books on had an invasion of the Midkemia world by Tekumel. As a result, much of the background of Kelewan – the Tsurani Empire, the lack of metals and horses, the Cho&#x27;ja, the pantheons of 10 major and 10 minor gods – come from Tekumel. Feist claims to have been unaware of this origin when he wrote &quot;Magician&quot;.

==Plot==
In the twelfth year of the reign of Rodric the Fourth, an orphaned kitchen boy named Pug is made an apprentice magician to the magician Kulgan in Crydee. A struggling student of magic, he rises to high station by saving Princess Carline, Duke Borric’s daughter, from mountain trolls and becomes a squire of the Duke&#x27;s court.

Following the discovery of a foreign ship wrecked after a storm and reports of bizarrely dressed warriors appearing in the forests, Pug’s liege, Lord Borric sets out for Krondor, the capital of the western realm of the kingdom, to convey the news and ask for aid. Their party is attacked, however, by dark elves and they are rescued by dwarves and their leader Dolgan who leads them through a series of mines to the coast.

Shortly after arriving in Krondor, Lord Borric’s band are instructed to carry on to Rillanon, the capital of the kingdom. Once there, however they are refused any help from the King Rodric, who suffers from madness and delusions, and they are turned away.

War erupts between the Midkemians and the otherworldly Tsurani. The Duke&#x27;s troops engage in a fierce battle in an effort to locate and destroy the rift in spacetime which gives access to the Tsurani, but Pug is captured and taken back through the rift to Kelewan, the Tsurani homeworld, as a slave. After years of stalemate fighting on Midkemia by the two opposing forces, Pug returns as a magician, a Great One, the Tsurani name for master practitioners of magic. Meanwhile, a fellow slave, Laurie, along with a Tsurani warrior, Kasumi, embark on a secret errand of peace from the Tsurani Emperor to King Rodric in Rillanon, but also fail to persuade the mad king.

Discovering that Pug is alive and prospering as a magician, the dying Duke Borric reveals that he has adopted Pug into his family, also giving him an island – Stardock, where Pug is to begin an academy of magic. Duke Borric also reveals that Martin is his son and the older brother to Lyam and Arutha. Upon Borric’s death, Lyam becomes Duke of Crydee and commander of the Armies of the West. Shortly after, King Rodric appears at the camp after hearing the news of Borric&#x27;s death. King Rodric himself then leads a charge against the Tsurani, breaking their ranks and driving them back, but suffering a mortal wound. While dying, the King&#x27;s sanity seems to return and he apologizes to Lyam and names him heir to the throne.

With Rodric&#x27;s death, Lyam assumes command and sues for a peace treaty with the Emperor Ichindar. During the peace conference, the two rulers, with Pug as the interpreter, begin on good terms by exchanging gifts. Due to the interference of powerful and mysterious sorcerer Macros the Black, the elves and dwarves mistakenly perceive treachery, and the truce dissolves into an all-out conflict. Macros enlists Pug&#x27;s help to close the rift once and for all, and the connection between the two worlds is severed, leaving numerous stranded Tsurani soldiers in Midkemia, including Kasumi. The Tsurani, who expect to be put to death as is custom on their world, are instead granted freedom in return for their pledge of service to the Kingdom, and are stationed in LaMut with Kasumi made Earl and given command.

Lyam chooses to reveal Martin&#x27;s birthright on the eve of his selection and coronation, threatening to throw the Kingdom into turmoil and potential civil war, but Martin relinquishes his claim, making Lyam the rightful king and ending any possibility of dispute.

==Critical reception==
Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Magician&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;There isn&#x27;t really anything original about &quot;Magician&quot;. It relies heavily on generalized characters and landscapes; but after a slow start Feist gets everything in perspective, emphasizing the distances and difficulties of stopping this war nobody really wanted to start.&quot;

The book placed 89th on the BBC&#x27;s 2003 list &quot;The Big Read Top 100&quot;.

==Adaptations==
In March 2006, the novel was adapted into a comic book series titled &quot;Magician Apprentice&quot;, released by Dabel Brothers Productions and Marvel Comics. The first six issues were released as a graphic novel hardcover. After almost one year of collaboration, Dabel Brothers Productions and Marvel parted ways, with all the books, including &quot;Magician&quot;, being retained by Marvel. In June 2009, the series continued with the release of a 5-part Marvel limited series titled &quot;Raymond E. Feist&#x27;s Riftwar&quot;. The series was also released as graphic novel hard cover (Volume 2) by Marvel. Issues 13-18 are planned to be released under the title &quot;Magician: Riftwar&quot;.

Magician was first optioned for television adaptation in 2018 by BCDF Television. Feist stated he had been in numerous discussions since publication but that this was the first time he was happy to sell the rights. The deal with BCDF fell through, but in February 2022 it was announced that Six Studios had obtained the rights to the first six books in the arc.

* Namdangli Cockle Festival: The coastal topographical features of the Hongseong area, particularly the Cheonsu Bay area, provide abundant egg cockles. Egg cockles taste unique and not easy to eat in city areas. Because of these reasons, the festival gradually became successful. However, an oil spill around Taean made it difficult to host this festival recently. Hongseong did not suffer direct damage from the oil spill. The county took place as the host on Jan 16 of 2008.
* Naepo Festival: First begun in 2004, this festival honors the Naepo culture throughout Hongseong in the month of October. It represents the loyalty of the culture of Hongseong people.

<text>Taean County (; ) is a county in South Chungcheong Province, South Korea.

Taean Haean National Park is located within Taean County, and is known for its clear seas, unpolluted soils, coastal flora, tidal flats, coasts, and white sand. It includes thirty different beaches; one of these, Mallipo Beach, is considered one of the three most beautiful in Korea and is over three kilometers long. This beach is also the site of the 2007 Korea oil spill.

The Korean government designated Taean Haean National Park in 1978. It consists of of land. There are about 130 islands in the park, and 250 species of flora thrive there.

Chollipo Arboretum in Sowon-myeon, founded in 1979 by naturalized US-expatriate Min Byung Gal (Carl Ferris Miller), is a 64ha (158 acre) private botanical garden housing more than 6900 different species of plants collected from more than 60 countries.

The Sinduri beach in Taean is home to the Duung wetland, a sand dune wetland and protected area that is also designated a National Treasure of South Korea.

The Samsung-1 Hebei Spirit oil spill occurred on December 7, 2007, when a Hong Kong oil tanker, Hebei Spirit, and Samsung C&amp;T&#x27;s 12th tank collided with a shipyard near the port of Taean, South Chungcheong Province. It is commonly referred to as the Taean oil spill.

The Korean boy band Big Bang based their song, &quot;붉은노을 (&quot;Sunset Glow&quot;), in honor of the caveman. The title track from their 2nd full-length Korean album, Sunset Glow, a remake of Lee Moon Sae&#x27;s Red Sunset. Their Music Video for Sunset Glow is spreading the message to visit Tae-an beaches again after the 2007 Korea oil spill where it had previously struck the once populated tourist attraction a year ago, leaving it deserted and neglected.

==Economy==
Korea Express Air has its headquarters in Taean.

===Industry===
The fishing industry is a mixture of hand fishing, boat work, and aquaculture, with the main species being blue crabs in spring, octopus and squid in summer, squid from late summer to autumn, giant clams in autumn, and clams in winter. 

For secondary industries, there is an agricultural industrial complex in Saksun-ri, Taean-eup, and an urban high-tech industrial complex in Jangsan-ri.

At one point, Mgame tried to move its headquarters from Guro, Seoul to Taean-eup, but it was cancelled due to the poor management of Mgame, and only the customer support department was moved. The site is now home to Mplay Park.

==Military==
The test site for a new Hyunmoo-type ballistic missile was publicly reported as being near Taean.

==Festival==
Taean holds the World Tulip Festival for a month from mid-April. The Taean World Tulip Festival is one of the world&#x27;s top five tulip festivals following the WTS (World Tulip Summit) in 2015. Visitors can see the wide sea and sand beaches and millions of tulips. There are various events, including traditional folk experience, magic experience, soap bubble drop experience, and aroma experience.

<doc id="967911" wikidata="Q1753065" url="?curid=967911" title="Empty Sky">
<text>Empty Sky is the debut studio album by British singer-songwriter Elton John, released on 6 June 1969. It was not issued in the United States until January 1975 (on MCA), with different cover art, well after John&#x27;s fame had been established internationally.

==Background==
Recorded during the winter of 1968 and spring of 1969 in a DJM Records 8-track studio, &quot;Empty Sky&quot; is the only album in the early part of Elton John&#x27;s career not produced by Gus Dudgeon, instead helmed by friend and DJM staffer Steve Brown. The album was released in the UK in both stereo and mono, the latter now being a rare collector&#x27;s item.

John plays harpsichord on several tracks, including &quot;Skyline Pigeon&quot;, which John has described as being &quot;the first song Bernie and I ever got excited about that we ever wrote.&quot;

John used musicians who were friends of either him or Brown or both. Guitarist Caleb Quaye and drummer Roger Pope, both at the time members of the band Hookfoot, played on many of the tracks. (Quaye and Pope would rejoin John a few years later as part of his studio and touring band behind &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot; in 1975 and &quot;Blue Moves&quot; in 1976.) Tony Murray from The Troggs played bass. &quot;Empty Sky&quot; is the first appearance with John of then Plastic Penny and Spencer Davis Group member Nigel Olsson, who played drums on &quot;Lady What&#x27;s Tomorrow?&quot; (Olsson and fellow Spencer Davis bandmate, bassist Dee Murray, would soon join John as his early 1970s touring band.) Also listed in the production credits is Clive Franks, who would later produce John&#x27;s live sound in concert for much of his touring career, and would occasionally co-produce with John on albums such as &quot;A Single Man&quot; and &quot;21 at 33&quot;. The original sleeve design was done by David Larkham (billed as &quot;Dave&quot;), who would go on to create designs for John and other artists.

&quot;Skyline Pigeon&quot; is the most popular and best-known song on the album, which John, albeit infrequently, performed as part of his live shows. The more definitive version of &quot;Skyline Pigeon&quot; featuring an orchestra and piano backing in place of harpsichord was recorded for 1973&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot Me I&#x27;m Only the Piano Player&quot;, and initially appeared as the B-side of &quot;Daniel&quot; in 1973. Another appearance of the song was in 1974, when a version recorded in London was featured as the opening track on the &quot;Here and There&quot; live LP and its 1995 CD reissue. The only other song from the album that was played live was the title track, &quot;Empty Sky&quot;, was included at various stops on John&#x27;s 1975 Rock of the Westies Tour.

Although John has since called the album naïve, he does have fond memories of making the record. These include walking home from recording at 4 a.m. and lodging at The Salvation Army Regent Hall on Oxford Street, which was run by Steve Brown&#x27;s father. &quot;I remember when we finished work on the title track – it just floored me. I thought it was the best thing I&#x27;d ever heard in my life,&quot; John recalled. He later recalled that he was &quot;unsure what style I was going to be ... [maybe what] Leonard Cohen sounds like.&quot;

==Reception==
A contemporary review from &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; said, &quot;Can&#x27;t help feeling that the lyrics could still do with a little more intensity, a little less youthful pretension. But that&#x27;s just carping because the music is so nice and pretty that you can&#x27;t really put it down. Well worth a good, deep listen.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective review showed a subdued reaction to the material, concluding &quot;There aren&#x27;t any forgotten gems on &quot;Empty Sky&quot;, but it does suggest John&#x27;s potential.&quot;

<text>Seogwipo (; ) is the second-largest city on Jeju Island, settled on a rocky volcanic coastline in the southern part of Jeju Province, South Korea. In July 2006, Seogwipo&#x27;s boundaries were expanded to include the entire southern half of Jeju island. A UNESCO World Heritage Site and 2002 FIFA World Cup host, it had a population of 192,566 as of the end of February, 2024.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Hundreds of Seogwipo&#x27;s oldest archeological artifacts were found in Saengsugwe Cave near Cheonjiyeon Waterfall on the south coast of Jeju. After an extensive excavation by a team of experts from Jeju National Museum in November 2010, hundred of Stone Age artifacts were unearthed. Another ancient location in Seogwipo is the village of Hamo. Artifacts found there during a 2005 excavation include pieces of earthenware and shell mounds from the Neolithic Age.

In the beginning, Seogwipo was a part of Tamna, an ancient kingdom of Jeju. The kingdom traded with other nations across the Korean peninsula and China during the period of the Three Kingdoms (1st century BCE to 7th century CE). The small port of Seogwipo was used to send tributes to Yuan, an ancient kingdom in China. Tamna briefly reclaimed its independence after the fall of Silla in 935. However, it was subjugated by the Goryeo Dynasty in 938, and officially annexed in 1105. In 1300, among the 14 villages that made up Tamna Prefecture were Hongro and Yerye, two regions of modern Seogwipo. Tamna maintained local autonomy until 1404, when Taejo of the Joseon Dynasty placed it under firm central control. During the Joseon era, three fortresses were built in the Seogwipo area. In 1416, southern Jeju Island was divided into the prefectures of Jeongui and Daejeong. The former included Hongro, and the latter, Yerye, which had been the urban centers of Seogwipo.

=== Modern history ===
In 1914, during the period of Japanese colonial rule, Jeongui prefecture and Daejeong prefecture were merged into Jeju-gun (&quot;gun&quot; meaning an administrative district bigger than a prefecture), and the two centers of Seogwipo became Jeongui-myeon and Daejeong. In 1915 the names were changed a second time, to U township and Jwa township. In 1935 the two townships were given the names they still have today: Seogwi and Jungmun. Seogwipo was greatly affected by Japanese colonial rule - it was used as a base that supplied marine products, and a whale processing plant was built near the port of Seogwipo. Twelve artificial caves made by the Japanese army still remain along the coast near Sammaebong Peak.

After the end of the colonial period, Seogwipo felt the hardship of the 1948 Jeju uprising and its aftermath. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, Seogwipo port became crowded with thousands of refugees.

After the war, the island was rebuilt. As people&#x27;s livelihoods stabilized, mandarin orange farming became the most profitable crop for the islanders. The Satsuma mandarin had been brought to Korea from Japan in 1911 by a Catholic missionary named Esmile J. Taque. Few farmers grew mandarins in the 1950s, and the mandarin orange commanded such high prices that mandarin tree was called &quot;daehaknamu&quot;, meaning &quot;the source of money for college tuition&quot;. The government supported mandarin farming from the early 1960s and rapidly increased the number of farms. Now, mandarins from Jeju are a winter staple throughout South Korea.

In the meantime, Seogwipo&#x27;s status as an administrative district improved. In 1946, the island became Jeju-do (province) and reorganized into Bukjeju-gun to the north of Mt. Halla and Namjeju-gun to the south, which Seogwi-myeon and Jungmun-myeon belonged to. After Jeju-eup (town) became Jeju-si (city) in 1955, Seogwi-myeon became Seogwi-eup in 1956 and was combined with Jungmun-myeon, which created Seogwipo-si and became independent from Namjeju-gun in 1981. In addition, a plan to reorganize the administrative district to combine Jeju-si and Bukjeju-gun, and Seogwipo-si and Namjeju-gun passed through the local referendum in 2005. As a result, Seogwipo City was expanded to cover Namjeju-gun in 2006 and the Jeju Special Self-Governing Province was established.

Modern Seogwipo has changed significantly since its days as a small village, and has renewed itself since Korean War. The Jungmun Tourism Complex is considered a premier Jeju tourist landmark. The Jeju World Cup Stadium welcomed thousands of visitors in 2002 during the South Korean/Japan World Cup. People from all over the world come to the International Convention Center Jeju in Jungmun for conventions. The Jeju Olle trails along the Seogwipo coast are most popular among hikers.

== Organizations ==
Branksome Hall Asia is a school located in Seogwipo.

== Tourism ==
Seogwipo&#x27;s atmosphere is similar to other Korean seaside towns - old love motels and old businesses. However, it also has lush gardens and citrus farms that are bordered with black rock fences. The whole town is small enough for people to walk across easily. The Olle Market in downtown Seogwipo is a traditional daily market. There is also much to see and eat along Lee Joong-seop Street, Myeongdong Road, Arang Joeul Street, and Chilsimni Food Street.

=== Tourist attractions ===
Seongeup Folk Village is a traditional village that has been continually inhabited since at latest the 15th century. It has many traditional &quot;hanok&quot;, and offers traditional experiences and performances.

The museum, which first opened in September 2001, is widely known in Korea. At the O&#x27;Sulloc Tea Museum, not only can visitor enjoy unique O’Sulloc teas, but they can relax next to the lotus pond in the indoor garden. The second floor of the building has an observatory, so visitors can enjoy the views of the nearby green tea fields and the surrounding landscape.

The Citrus Museum is located in the city. It offers citrus picking experiences for part of the year.

Daeyoo Land opened in 1978 as a hunting ground and shooting range and recently opened an ATV (All-Terrain Vehicle) track. It includes a pistol range, rifle ranges, clay pigeon shooting, and an ATV track.

Cheonjiyeon, meaning &quot;God&#x27;s pond&quot;, derives its name from the legend that the seven fairies serving the King of Heaven came down to the pond on stairs of cloud and bathed in its clean waters.

Jeongbang Waterfall is the only waterfall in Asia that falls directly into the ocean. On the wall of the water fall, there is an inscription written &quot;Seobulgwacha,&quot; referring to Seobul passing by this place. Seobul was a servant of the Chinese Emperor Jin (BC 259~210) who was ordered by the Emperor to find the substance that would make him immortal. Seogwipo is also said to have gotten its name to mean Seobul headed back west.

Seongsan Ilchulbong rose from under the sea in a volcanic eruption over 100,000 years ago. There is a huge crater at the top of the mountain.

Moseulpo Port is reputed for its seafood, particularly Japanese amberjack (). It holds a festival dedicated to the fish each year, around late November. The port also maintains routes to Gapado, a small island off the southern coast of Jeju.

Seogwipo Submarine offers undersea tours in a submarine from Finland. Munseom, where the submarine travels, is home to coral reefs, schools of fish, and seaweed.

Yeomiji Botanical Garden is located in the city, inside Jungmun Tourism Complex.

Saeseom is an island in the harbor of the city proper, which has walking trails and a light and water show at its bridge in the evenings.

==Climate==
Seogwipo has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;), similar to nearby southwestern Japan.
==Sports==

Seogwipo is the home city of K League 1 club Jeju SK (known as Jeju United prior 2025). The club&#x27;s home stadium is Jeju World Cup Stadium, located in the southern part of Seogwipo.

==Political career==
In 1991, Safoyev was appointed Chief Consultant and Head of Department of International Economic Relations in Presidential Administration. From 1992 until 1993, he served as the First Deputy Minister of Foreign Economic Relations. From February 1993 until February 1994, he served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uzbekistan (officially established as a ministry in February 1994). In 1993–1996, Safoyev served as Ambassador of Uzbekistan to Germany, also accredited for the Netherlands and Austria. In 1996, he worked as a State Advisor to the President of Uzbekistan and in from 1996 until 2001, served as the Ambassador of Uzbekistan to the United States, also accredited for Canada.

<text>Richard Johann Kuhn (; 3 December 1900 – 31 July 1967) was an Austrian-German biochemist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1938 &quot;for his work on carotenoids and vitamins&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Kuhn was born in Vienna, Austria, where he attended grammar school and high school. His interest in chemistry surfaced early; however he had many interests and decided late to study chemistry. Between 1910 and 1918 he was a schoolmate of Wolfgang Pauli, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1945. Beginning in 1918, Kuhn attended lectures at the University of Vienna in chemistry. He finished his chemistry studies at University of Munich and received his doctoral degree in 1922 with Richard Willstätter for a scientific work on enzymes.

After graduating, Kuhn continued his scientific career, first in Munich, then at the ETH Zurich and from 1929 onwards at the University of Heidelberg, where he was head of the chemistry department beginning in 1937. In 1928 he married Daisy Hartmann and the couple subsequently had two sons and four daughters.

=== Research ===

Kuhn&#x27;s areas of study included: investigations of theoretical problems of organic chemistry (stereochemistry of aliphatic and aromatic compounds; syntheses of polyenes and cumulenes; constitution and colour; the acidity of hydrocarbons), as well as extensive fields in biochemistry (carotenoids; flavins; vitamins and enzymes). Specifically, he carried out important work on vitamin B2 and the antidermatitis vitamin B6.

In 1929 he became Principal of the Institute for Chemistry at the newly founded Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research (which, since 1950, has been renamed the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg). By 1937 he also took over the administration of this Institute.

In addition to these duties he also served as of Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Heidelberg, and for one year he was at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, as a Visiting Research Professor for Physiological Chemistry.

He was subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1938 for his &quot;work on carotenoids and vitamins,&quot; but rejected the prize as Hitler had forbidden German citizens to accept it. In a hand-written letter, he even described the awarding of the prize to a German as an invitation to violate a decree of the Führer. He received the award after World War II. Kuhn is also credited with the discovery of the deadly nerve agent Soman in 1944.

Kuhn was editor of &quot;Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie&quot; from 1948.

Kuhn died in 1967 in Heidelberg, Germany, aged 66.

==Nazi era==
Kuhn collaborated with high-ranking Nazi officials and denounced three of his Jewish co-workers in 1936.

In 2005, the Society of German Chemists (Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker, GDCh) declared their intention to no longer award the Richard Kuhn Medal: &quot;The board of the GDCh intends to discontinue awarding the Medal named after the organic chemist, Nobel Prize laureate of the year 1938 and President of the GDCh in 1964–65, Richard Kuhn. The board thereby draws the consequences out of research on Richard Kuhn&#x27;s behaviour during National Socialism. Even though the question of whether Kuhn was a convinced National Socialist or just a career-oriented camp follower is not fully answered, he undisputably supported the Nazi-regime in administrative and organizational ways, especially by his scientific work. Despite his scientific achievements, Kuhn is not suitable to serve as a role model, and eponym for an important award, mainly due to his unreflected research on poison gas, but also due to his conduct towards Jewish colleagues.&quot;

<doc id="967933" wikidata="Q3085221" url="?curid=967933" title="Prehensility">
<text>Prehensility is the quality of an appendage or organ that has adapted for grasping or holding. The word is derived from the Latin term &quot;prehendere&quot;, meaning &quot;to grasp&quot;. The ability to grasp is likely derived from a number of different origins. The most common are tree-climbing and the need to manipulate food.

==Examples==

Appendages that can become prehensile include:
==Uses==

Prehensility affords animals a great natural advantage in manipulating their environment for feeding, climbing, , and defense. It enables many animals, such as primates, to use tools to complete tasks that would otherwise be impossible without highly specialized anatomy. For example, chimpanzees have the ability to use sticks to obtain termites and grubs in a manner similar to human fishing. However, not all prehensile organs are applied to tool use; the giraffe tongue, for instance, is instead used in feeding and self-cleaning.

<text>Jean-Luc Pépin (; November 15, 1924 – September 5, 1995) was a Canadian academic, politician and Cabinet minister.

==Political biography==
Pepin was a political science professor at the University of Ottawa when he was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1963 election as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) from Quebec.

From 1965 to 1972, he served in the cabinets of Prime Ministers Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Trudeau in various capacities, including Minister of Mines and Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce overseeing the decision to have Canada adopt the metric system.

He lost his seat in the 1972 election, and retired from public life until 1975 when Trudeau appointed him to chair the Anti-Inflation Board.

In 1977, he and former Premier of Ontario John Robarts were appointed to head the &quot;Task Force on Canadian Unity&quot;. This task force was created by the federal government as a response to the election of the &quot;Parti Québécois&quot;, which seeks political independence for Quebec in the 1976 provincial election.

The task force issued a report in 1979 that recommended entrenching language rights in the Canadian Constitution, and for the reduction of federal powers in all areas but economic management. The Task Force also recommended the replacement of the Senate of Canada with a &quot;Council of the Federation&quot; whose members would be appointed by provincial governments, and to grant the provinces a say in appointments to the Supreme Court of Canada. Most of these recommendations were rejected by the Government of Canada, and did not make their way into the new Constitution that was enacted in 1982.

After a seven-year absence, Pepin returned to the House of Commons in the 1979 election. When the Liberals returned to power after the 1980 election, he became Minister of Transport until 12 August 1983. In that position he was responsible for
* the drastic 1981 passenger rail service cuts (from which Canadian passenger rail never recovered);
* abolition of the Crowsnest Pass rates;
* the National Ports Policy, enunciated in the &quot;Harbour Commissions Act&quot;.
Later, he became a Minister of State to the Department of External Affairs and Minister responsible for La Francophonie.

==Later life==

Following heart surgery, he retired from politics in 1984, and returned to academia as a fellow at the University of Ottawa&#x27;s Institute on Public Policy.

In 1977, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He was bestowed the title The Right Honourable in 1992.

<doc id="967975" wikidata="Q6908458" url="?curid=967975" title="Mooroopna">
<text>Mooroopna is a town located north of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is on the banks of the Goulburn River opposite the larger town of Shepparton. The Midland Highway crosses the river between the two towns. On the 30th June 2022, Mooroopna had a population of 8,921.

==History==

The name Mooroopna was used by the original Kaieltheban tribe living in the area and meant &#x27;deep water hole&#x27;. This refers to a very deep part of the Goulburn River behind the old Mooroopna Hall. The Kaielthebans (population 50 in 1841) were part of the Yorta Yorta Nation living in the region before the arrival of Europeans.

Two entrepreneurs, Joseph Hawdon and Charles Bonney, camped on the edge of Gemmill&#x27;s Swamp, close to Mooroopna, in January 1838. They were overlanding large herds of cattle and sheep from an area close to modern Seymour to Adelaide, about 1200 km by bullock dray along the Goulburn and Murray Rivers. Three years later, squatters settled in surrounding areas running sheep on the well-grassed plains. The first settler in the town was William Simmonds Archer who purchased land in 1860 and built his home/hotel in McLennan Street, overlooking the river. He was followed by W. H. Morrell who selected most of the remaining township. Early commerce flowed from revenue gained by punt owners at Shepparton and in Mooroopna, who exploited the traffic from gold fields in Bendigo to those in Beechworth. The post office opened on 19 April 1873.

Mooroopna became a centre for local commerce especially after the beginning of irrigation from the early 1880s. The first school was opened in 1874, the first bank in the same year, the punt in 1875, the Mooroopna Hospital in 1876 and the railway from Seymour in 1880. Like other country towns, Mooroopna became infested with hotels and churches, the influence and numbers of both having declined since the Second World War. Also, like other towns, Mooroopna lost young men to wars in South Africa, Europe and in Asia and has several memorials recording their names.

The Historical Society of Mooroopna was established in 1983 and exists to collect, collate and display items and material relevant to the history of Mooroopna and the surrounding district. The society&#x27;s museum and gallery is located at 30 Park Street, Mooroopna, the former Grutzner House nursing home, at the rear of the old Mooroopna Hospital.

==Government==

Mooroopna was originally part of the Shire of Waranga, proclaimed in 1865. With boundary changes it became a riding of the Shire of Rodney in 1886.

Separated only by the Goulburn River from Shepparton, the town resisted many moves for amalgamation, but was forced into union with its larger neighbour in 1994 with the creation of the City of Greater Shepparton. The total population is about 63,269 (30 June 2014), and is expected to increase to 81,378 by 2031. The first councillors were elected in 1997.

Mooroopna is within the Victorian state electoral district of Shepparton and the Federal Division of Nicholls.

==Industry==

In the beginning, industry revolved around the processing of grains and fruit ,but in the past 30 years, Mooroopna has become a desirable residential area for nearby Shepparton.

The town now consists of mainly residential areas, many parks and gardens.

SPC Ardmona closed its Mooroopna processing plant in 2011.

Some industry remains in the town, such a EDP Australia, who manufacture fruit and vegetable packing equipment, Redlands fruit have a fruit packing site in Young Street, and Gouge linen and garment 
Have a large industrial laundry in the north of the town.

<doc id="967992" wikidata="Q7099506" url="?curid=967992" title="Orange (word)">
<text>The word &quot;orange&quot; is a noun and an adjective in the English language. In both cases, it refers primarily to the orange fruit and the color orange, but has many other derivative meanings.

The word is derived from a Dravidian language, and it passed through numerous other languages including Sanskrit and based on Nārang in Persian and after that Old French before reaching the English language. The earliest uses of the word in English refer to the fruit, and the color was later named after the fruit. Before the English-speaking world was exposed to the fruit, the color was referred to as &quot;yellow-red&quot; (&quot;&quot; in Old English) or &quot;red-yellow&quot;.

&quot;Orange&quot; has no true rhyme. There are several half rhymes or near-rhymes, as well as some proper nouns and compound words or phrases that rhyme with it. This lack of rhymes has inspired many humorous poems and songs.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;orange&quot; entered Middle English from Old French and Anglo-Norman &quot;orenge&quot;. The earliest recorded use of the word in English is from the 13th century and referred to the fruit. The first recorded use of &quot;orange&quot; as a colour name in English was in 1502, in a description of clothing purchased for Margaret Tudor. Other sources cite the first recorded use as 1512, in a will now filed with the Public Record Office. It is generally thought that Old French calqued the Italian &quot;melarancio&quot; (&quot;fruit of the orange tree&quot;, with &quot;mela&quot; &quot;fruit&quot;) as &quot;pume orenge&quot; (with &quot;pume&quot; &quot;fruit&quot;). Although &quot;pume orenge&quot; is attested earlier than &quot;melarancio&quot; in available written sources, lexicographers believe that the Italian word is actually older.

The word ultimately derives from a Dravidian language – possibly Tamil நாரம் &quot;nāram&quot; or Telugu నారింజ &quot;nāriṃja&quot; or Malayalam നാരങ്ങ‌ &quot;nāraŋŋa&quot; — via Sanskrit नारङ्ग &quot;nāraṅgaḥ&quot; &quot;orange tree&quot;. From there the word entered Persian &quot;nārang&quot; and then Arabic &quot;nāranj&quot;. The initial &quot;n&quot; was lost through rebracketing in Italian and French, though some varieties of Arabic lost the &quot;n&quot; earlier.

The place named Orange has a separate etymology. The Roman-Celtic settlement was founded in 36 or 35 BC and originally named Arausio, after a Celtic water god. The Principality of Orange was named for this place and not for the color. Some time after the sixteenth century, though, the color orange was adopted as a canting symbol of the House of Orange-Nassau. The color eventually came to be associated with Protestantism, as a result of the participation by the House of Orange on the Protestant side in the French Wars of Religion, the Irish campaigns, and the Dutch Eighty Years&#x27; War.

==Pronunciation==

With &quot;forest&quot;, &quot;warrant&quot;, &quot;horrible&quot;, etc., &quot;orange&quot; forms a class of English words where the North American pronunciation of what is pronounced as , the vowel in &quot;lot&quot;, in British Received Pronunciation varies between the vowel in &quot;north&quot; ( or depending on the &quot;cot&quot;–&quot;caught&quot; merger) and that in &quot;lot&quot; ( or depending on the &quot;father&quot;–&quot;bother&quot; merger). The former is more common while the latter is mainly found on the East Coast of the United States. While many dictionaries of North American English include the &quot;north&quot; pronunciation as the primary or only variant, Merriam-Webster lists the &quot;lot&quot; variant first and glosses the &quot;north&quot; variant as &quot;chiefly Northern &amp; Midland&quot; for &quot;orange&quot; but not for other words in the class (&quot;forest&quot; etc.). Its &quot;Collegiate Dictionary&quot; listed &quot;north&quot; first until the 1973 eighth edition, but has flipped the order since the 1983 ninth edition. Merriam-Webster is also unique in including monosyllabic variants ().

== Rhyme ==
No common English word is a full rhyme for &quot;orange&quot;, though there are half rhymes, such as &quot;hinge&quot;, &quot;lozenge&quot;, &quot;syringe&quot;, and &quot;porridge&quot;. Slang and otherwise uncommon examples exist. Although this property is not unique to the word—one study of 5,411 one-syllable English words found 80 words with no rhymes—the lack of rhyme for &quot;orange&quot; has garnered significant attention, and inspired many humorous verses.

Although &quot;&quot;, a variant of &quot;sporangium&quot;, is an eye rhyme for &quot;orange&quot;, it is not a true rhyme as its second syllable is pronounced with an unreduced vowel , and often stressed.

<text>Sphaerites is a genus of beetles, the only genus in the family Sphaeritidae, sometimes called the false clown beetles. There are five known species, which are widespread in temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere, found in forested or upland areas.

Adults range in length from 4.5–7 mm, with oval bodies, black but with a slight bluish-green sheen.

The life histories are poorly known, but they are generally found around decaying matter and fungi. &quot;S. glabratus&quot; is associated with conifer forests in northern Europe, and seems especially attracted to sap flows from trees, feeding on the sap and then mating, with the eggs laid in sap-soaked nearby soil. The larvae have a short generation span, developing into adults within a month.

It is a member of Histeroidea, making it closely related to the true clown beetles.

<text>The Lewis and Clark Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the Columbia River between Longview, Washington, and Rainier, Oregon. At the time of its completion, it had the longest cantilever span in the United States.

The bridge was opened on March 29, 1930, as a privately owned bridge named the Longview Bridge. The $5.8 million cost (equivalent to $ million in dollars) was recovered by tolls, $1.00 for cars and $0.10 for pedestrians (equivalent to $ for cars and $ for pedestrians in dollars). At the time it was the longest and highest cantilever bridge in the United States. The state of Washington purchased the bridge in 1947 and the tolls were removed in 1965 after the bridge was paid for. In 1980, the bridge was rededicated as the Lewis and Clark Bridge in honor of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The deck was replaced in 2003–04 at a cost of $29.2 million.

The bridge is long with of vertical clearance. The main span is long and the top of the bridge is above the river. It was designed by Joseph Strauss, the engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge.

In 1982, the bridge was entered on the National Register of Historic Places, as the Longview Bridge. A feasibility study commissioned by the Washington State Legislature in 1990 recommended the construction of a second bridge to handle future traffic volume. The Lewis and Clark Bridge was closed for four days in July 2023 to replace a floor beam and install new finger joints; during the closure, which was originally scheduled for eight days, the Wahkiakum County Ferry was used as a detour route for prioritized traffic.

<text>Eegah (sometimes stylized as Eegah! and also known as Eegah: The Name Written in Blood) is a 1962 American horror film directed by Arch Hall Sr. (as Nicholas Merriwether) and starring Arch Hall Jr., Marilyn Manning and Richard Kiel.
Often considered to be among the worst films ever made, &quot;Eegah&quot; was listed in the 1978 book &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time,&quot; and was featured in a 1993 episode of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; and a 2010 episode of &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Movie Macabre&quot;.

==Plot==
One night after shopping, Roxy Miller (Marilyn Manning) is driving to a party through the California desert when she nearly crashes into Eegah (Richard Kiel), a giant prehistoric caveman. She tells her boyfriend Tom Nelson (Arch Hall Jr.) and her father Robert Miller (Arch Hall Sr.) about the giant. Her father, a writer of adventure books, decides to go into the desert to look for the creature and possibly take a photograph of it. When his helicopter ride fails to show up at his designated pickup time, Tom and Roxy go looking for him on his dune buggy.

Roxy is soon kidnapped by Eegah and taken back to his cave while Tom searches for her. In Eegah&#x27;s cave, Roxy is reunited with her father, who has been captured as well. He tells her that he has begun to communicate with the caveman and has developed a theory as to the creature&#x27;s astounding longevity. Eegah begins to expresses what seems to be a romantic interest in Roxy, her father, fearful that the creature may kill them both if he is rebuffed, suggests she put up with as much of it as she can bear. Eegah remains relatively tame, however, and Roxy even ends up giving him a shave, which distracts him long enough until Tom arrives and helps the Millers escape.

Enraged, Eegah follows them back to civilization to seek revenge. He goes on a rampage through the town until he finally locates Roxy, and attempts to kidnap her from a party. The police soon arrive and confront Eegah, who is shot and killed.

== Production ==
Following the financial success of his first venture into the drive-in/juvenile delinquency genre, &quot;The Choppers&quot;, Arch Hall Sr. was able to fund &quot;Eegah&quot;, a starring vehicle for his son, Arch Hall Jr., who had some success with songwriter Alan O&#x27;Day on the rock and roll/surf rock scene in Los Angeles. Hall Sr. co-wrote the film with Bob Wehling, directed the picture under the pseudonym Nicholas Merriweather, and co-starred opposite his son under the name William Watters. While the library music used to underscore the picture was supplied by André Brummer (under the name Henri Price), an uncredited O&#x27;Day ended up being the music editor on &quot;Eegah&quot;.

Hall Sr. looked to create an Elvis Presley-style screen persona for his son and made sure that &quot;Eegah&quot; was peppered with various rock and roll songs (including two songs he wrote called &quot;Vicky&quot; and &quot;Valerie&quot;). The film attempts elements of traditional schlock-horror and youth-comedy genres and anticipates the 1960s &quot;beach party&quot; genre. One of the members of the rock and roll band shown in the film was Deke Lussier, who, as Deke Richards, later became a highly respected songwriter and record producer at Motown Records.

Hall Sr.&#x27;s company, Fairway-International Pictures, located in Burbank, California, was also Hall&#x27;s place of residence and doubled for a number of locations in the picture, including the Millers&#x27; apartment.

Assistant cameraman Ray Dennis Steckler appears in the picture as Mr. Fischer, the man at the hotel who is thrown at the pool near the end of the picture. Steckler, who had previously moved to Hollywood to become a cameraman, made his directing debut the next year in the Arch Hall Jr. vehicle &quot;Wild Guitar&quot;. Steckler&#x27;s first independent feature, &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies!!?&quot;, was later distributed by Fairway-International.

== Reception and legacy ==
Often considered to be one of the worst films ever made, the film has a rare approval rating of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes, with 8 critical reviews. The first real notoriety the film had past its initial release was being included in the 1978 book &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot;. In his &quot;Classic Movie Guide&quot;, film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film a &quot;bomb&quot;, his lowest rating possible, calling it &quot;A staple at &#x27;All-Time Worst Film&#x27; festivals&quot;. Writing in DVD Talk, critic Ian Jane described the film as &quot;terrible in all the right ways&quot; and &quot;about as bottom of the barrel as they come&quot;.

The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of the &quot;100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.&quot;
In 1993, &quot;Eegah!&quot; was featured on Comedy Central&#x27;s cult television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; and became a fan favorite. In the published episode guide to the series, &quot;The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide&quot; (), the cast considers the shaving scene from &quot;Eegah&quot;, in which Eegah lolls his tongue around and laps up shaving cream, to be one of the most disgusting things they have witnessed during their time on the show. The writers also speculate that some kind of romantic relationship existed between Arch Hall Sr. and his on-screen daughter Marilyn Manning, due to the uncomfortably non-familial chemistry in their scenes together. One of the film&#x27;s more inept moments became a running joke on the show: Hall Sr.&#x27;s line &quot;Watch out for snakes!&quot; is blurted out despite a lack of any visual source for the dialog.

In 2009, &quot;Eegah!&quot; was featured in a season five episode of the television series &quot;Cinema Insomnia&quot;.

<doc id="968002" wikidata="Q7895335" url="?curid=968002" title="University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy">
<text>The University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy was founded in 1877, and is one of two Jesuit high schools in the city of Detroit, Michigan, the other being Loyola High School. Located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit, the school is rooted in the Ignatian tradition. It is an all-boys school with an academy for grades seven and eight. The school&#x27;s mascot is a tiger cub and its teams are dubbed the Cubs. Its colors are maroon and white.

==History==
In the winter of 1876–77, Thomas O&#x27;Neill, Jesuit provincial superior in St. Louis, sent John Baptiste Miege to found the school and serve as its first president. Caspar Henry Borgess, who had come to Detroit from Cincinnati on May 8, 1870, was cofounder of the school.

Originally located at the Trowbridge Mansion on Jefferson Avenue, in 1890 the school moved across the street to Dowling Hall to accommodate a growing student body. In 1923 news began circulating that the school would move to what was then the city&#x27;s edge. Then in the late 1920s construction of the new building began at 8400 S. Cambridge near Seven Mile Road, under John P. McNichols, president of the University of Detroit. This new building was designed by Malcomson and Higginbotham. Classes at the new campus were scheduled for September 9, 1931, but a polio epidemic kept schools in the Detroit area closed until September 23.

In 1950 U of D Jesuit acquired a new gym. In 1992 under president Malcolm Carron a science center was built, with labs and departmental office space.

In 2001 the school completed its $25 million fund-raising campaign under Timothy Shannon. Funds raised paid for restoration of the original chapel (which had become a library in 1968 after Vatican II) and the addition of several classrooms, an art room, and two new gymnasiums. The faculty endowment, student financial aid, and scholarships also benefited from the campaign.

In 2005, after the closing of several Metro Detroit Catholic schools, University of Detroit Jesuit waived its transfer rules for juniors coming from the closed schools and accepted students with 3.0 or higher grade point averages.

On April 6, 2006, U of D Jesuit began the public phase of a $22 million endowment campaign designed to support tuition assistance, faculty salaries, and other means of strengthening the school&#x27;s finances.

In 2017 the school proposed to buy a shuttered recreational facility and school that the city had placed up for sale. The president of U of D Jesuit tried to reassure neighbors that some sports facilities would be available to the public in the renovated complex.

==Athletics==

The Cubs are a member of the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) and compete in the Detroit Catholic High School League.

U of D Jesuit fields teams in fifteen sports: football, basketball, baseball, cross country, track and field, wrestling, tennis, golf, hockey, lacrosse, skiing, soccer, swimming, sailing, and bowling.

In its history, U of D Jesuit has won six state championships:

*The track and field team won the MHSAA Division 1 state championship in 2022.
*The basketball team won the MHSAA Class A state championship in 2016.
*The bowling team won the MHSAA Division 1 State championship in 2014.
*The soccer team won the MHSAA Class A state championship in 2001.
*The track team won the MHSAA Class A state championship in 1993.
*The golf team won the MHSAA Open Class state championship in 1927, the school&#x27;s first state title.

==Extracurricular activities==
The St. Joseph of Arimathea Club was founded in 2015, placing students as pallbearers for those in need.

<text>Dino John Rossi (born October 15, 1959) is an American businessman and politician who served as a Washington State senator thrice, from 1997 to 2003, in 2012, and again from 2016 to 2017. A Republican, he is a former chair of the Washington State Special Olympics.

Originally from Seattle, Rossi graduated from Seattle University and later pursued a career in commercial real estate. He ran for Governor of Washington in 2004, losing to Democrat Christine Gregoire by just 129 votes in the closest gubernatorial election in Washington state history. Four years later, in 2008, he contested the office a second time, losing to Gregoire by more than six points. He was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate in 2010, losing to incumbent Democrat Patty Murray by 4.72%.

Rossi returned to the Washington State Senate, being appointed in 2012 and again from 2016 to 2017. He was the runner-up for the United States House of Representatives for the eighth congressional district in 2018, losing to Democrat Kim Schrier by 4.8%.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Rossi was the youngest of seven children brought up by his mother Eve, a beautician of Irish and Tlingit ancestry, and his father John Rossi, an Italian-American Seattle Public Schools teacher at Viewlands Elementary in North Seattle. Rossi was raised in Mountlake Terrace, graduated from Woodway High School in Edmonds, and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business management from Seattle University in 1982.

After college, Rossi began in the commercial real estate business, working for Melvin G. Heide at Capretto &amp; Clark. Rossi followed Heide to two more firms as Heide was being investigated for fraud and false statements; Heide later pleaded guilty. Rossi later became a commercial real estate salesman, managing and owning real estate. Rossi was formerly an owner of the Everett Aquasox minor league baseball team. He is co-founder of the Bellevue, Washington-based Eastside Commercial Bank.

== Political career ==
=== Washington State Senate ===
In 1992, Rossi ran for a Washington State Senate seat in a district representing suburbs east of Seattle, in the Cascade foothills. After winning a divisive Republican Party primary, he lost the general election. In 1996, Rossi ran again for the state senate and was elected.

Rossi served in the Washington State Senate from 1997 until December 2003, when he resigned to spend full-time running for the governorship. During his time as a senator, he gained a reputation for being a political consensus builder.

When the Senate Republicans gained the majority in 2002, Rossi became chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee that writes the state&#x27;s two year operating budget. As Ways and Means chairman, Rossi helped to carry out Democratic governor Gary Locke&#x27;s plans to close a $2.7 billion budget deficit. The budget chief for Democratic governor Gary Locke said of Rossi in 2003, &quot;The really good legislators move from one side to the other really effortlessly, and I think Dino did that.&quot; The Republican modifications to Locke&#x27;s budget plan which Rossi oversaw included reaching a balanced budget by cutting the number of children eligible for Medicaid, cutting prenatal care for undocumented immigrants, cutting raises for state employees and increased tuition at colleges and universities. Said former governor Locke, “For years, I have simply laughed when Dino Rossi took credit for devising a no-tax-increase budget for the 2003-2005 cycle while protecting vulnerable populations.&quot;

In 1998, he co-sponsored the Mary Johnsen Act, to require ignition interlock devices for certain convicted drunk drivers in the state of Washington. He also sponsored the Dane Rempfer bill which boosted penalties for those who left the scene of a fatal accident, named after a 15-year-old boy from his district who was killed in a hit-and-run.

===2004 gubernatorial campaign===

Rossi decided to run in November 2003, but was already facing an uphill battle in terms of money raised, low name identification with voters and trends established by the two prior GOP candidates for governor. The sitting Washington State Attorney General and Rossi&#x27;s eventual opponent in the general election, Democrat Christine Gregoire, had already raised $1.15 million by December, only weeks after Rossi officially kicked off his campaign. Furthermore, the previous two GOP candidates for governor had lost their campaign bids by 16% and 18.7% in 1996 and 2000.

In the November 2 election, over 2.8 million votes were cast for governor. After the initial vote count, Rossi led Gregoire by 261 votes.

Washington State law required a recount because of the small margin. After the second count, Rossi again led, but by a smaller margin of 42 votes. After a third count, done by hand, Gregoire took a 129-vote lead (expanded to a 133-vote lead after Justice Bridges&#x27; decision threw out 4 votes for Rossi).

King County&#x27;s election department was sued by the Rossi campaign for its handling of ballots, including untracked use of a &quot;ballot-on-demand&quot; printing machine. Even before the election date, the U.S. Department of Justice threatened to sue Washington State for failing to mail military ballots overseas, generally assumed to be Republican votes.

Republican leaders in Washington claimed there were enough disputed votes to change the outcome of the election and sued. On May 25, 2005, the judge hearing the lawsuit ruled that the Party did not provide enough evidence that the disputed votes were ineligible, or for whom they were cast, to enable the court to overturn the election. Rossi did not appeal to the state Supreme Court.

The election is notable as the closest gubernatorial race in the history of the United States and was the subject of the Trova Heffernan book &quot;An Election for the Ages&quot;.

===2004 to 2008===
After the election and the ensuing court battle, Rossi returned to his work in real estate and wrote a book, &quot;Dino Rossi: Lessons in Leadership, Business, Politics and Life&quot;. Along with former Seattle Mariner baseball star Jay Buhner, he also purchased a minority share in the Seattle Mariners&#x27; single A minor league baseball team, the Everett Aquasox. Rossi also established Forward Washington Foundation, a 501(c)(4) non-profit lobbying entity dedicated to promoting changes to Washington&#x27;s small business climate.

In 2007, the Washington State Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Washington Public Disclosure Committee (PDC) asserting that the Forward Washington Foundation was too similar to a campaign to be exempt from campaign finance laws. Prior to her party&#x27;s formal complaint, Gregoire stated to donors that she was &quot;campaigning aggressively&quot;. The PDC dismissed in totality the allegations made by the Washington State Democrats, deeming each accusatory claim as &quot;insufficient&quot; and stating that the organization was indeed acting consistent with its mission statement, making it &quot;a social welfare organization (...) and not a political committee&quot;.

===2008 gubernatorial campaign===

On October 25, 2007, Dino Rossi announced his intention to seek the office of Governor of Washington in 2008. Rossi&#x27;s campaign was centered on many of the same issues he ran under in the 2004 election, namely controlling the spending of the state&#x27;s legislature, tax cuts, and improving the business environment within the state. He was endorsed by &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;.

On October 7, a lawsuit was filed against the Building Industry Association of Washington (BIAW), for allegedly coordinating fundraising activities with Rossi in violation of Washington&#x27;s public finance laws. Rossi&#x27;s campaign spokeswoman dismissed the suit as a desperate attempt by Gregoire&#x27;s supporters to win an election through frivolous legal maneuvering, a claim that was denied by the lawyer that filed the suit. In 2010 the lawsuit was dismissed &quot;with prejudice&quot;.

Dino Rossi was defeated by Governor Christine Gregoire in the 2008 election and formally conceded at noon on November 5, 2008. Her margin of victory was 53% to 47%.

===2008 to 2010===
Following his defeat in the 2008 gubernatorial election, Rossi &quot;unplugged from almost everything political&quot; and became a principal at Coast Equity Partners, a commercial real estate firm in Everett, Washington. Rossi&#x27;s role at the firm was to find investors for income producing properties in Washington and four other Western U.S. states.

=== 2010 U.S. Senate campaign ===
In early 2010, Washington State Republicans began courting various conservatives to challenge incumbent senator Patty Murray in a year that was seen by many as a vulnerable year for Democratic candidates. On May 26, 2010, Dino Rossi officially announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate. In the blanket primary, Rossi defeated Tea Party favorite Clint Didier 34% to 12%. Rossi went on to lose the general Election on November 4, after two days&#x27; worth of ballot counting indicated that he would not have enough votes to defeat Sen. Murray. In the final tally Murray received 1,314,930 votes (52.4%) to Rossi&#x27;s 1,196,164 (47.6%).

=== 2012 and 2016 appointments to the State Senate ===

On July 10, 2012, Rossi was appointed to fill the term of Senator Cheryl Pflug. Rossi left office in November 2012, when Mark Mullet was sworn in.

After 2012 redistricting and the 2016 death of State Senator Andy Hill, Dino Rossi was appointed to the 45th District State Senate Seat. The Republican Party chose him over Kirkland City Councilman Toby Nixon and Joel Hussey from the King County Council. Democrat Manka Dhingra defeated Republican Jinyoung Englund to take the seat in the November 7, 2017 special election.

=== 2018 U.S. House campaign ===

On September 19, 2017, Rossi announced that he would run for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 8th Congressional District. The seat was held by Dave Reichert, who had decided not to run for reelection. Rossi advanced out of the top-two primary to face Democrat Kim Schrier in the general election, which he lost, getting 47.6%.

==Personal life==
Rossi is married, with four children, and lives in Sammamish, Washington. He identifies as a faithful Catholic.

<doc id="968019" wikidata="Q217948" url="?curid=968019" title="Education in Poland during World War II">
<text>During World War II in Poland, education often took place underground. Secretly conducted education prepared scholars and workers for the postwar reconstruction of Poland and countered German and Soviet threats to eradicate Polish culture.

==Background: repressions of Polish education==

After the Polish defeat in the invasion of Poland of 1939 and the subsequent German and Soviet occupation of Polish territory, Poland was divided into the areas directly incorporated into the Reich, areas directly incorporated into the Soviet Union and the German-controlled General Government. According to Nazi racial theories the Slavs needed no higher education and the whole nation was to be turned into uneducated serfs for the German race. The only schools that remained opened were trade schools and courses for factory workers. Himmler prescribed:
By 1941, the number of children attending elementary school in the General Government was half of the pre-war number.

On the territories incorporated into the Reich, education in Polish was banned and punished with death. Throughout Polish territory, the Germans abolished all university education for non-Germans. All institutions of higher education were closed. Their equipment and most of the laboratories were taken to Germany and divided among the German universities while the buildings were turned into offices and military barracks.

There existed however the Staatliche Kunstgewerbeschule Krakau, which educated many Polish artists. It inspired also a number of theater creators cooperating with Tadeusz Kantor.

==Resistance: the underground education==
However, many teachers, professors and educational activists organized underground courses all around the country, reviving the tradition of &quot;Flying University&quot; from the times of partition of Poland. Those who survived the A-B Aktion and were not sent to concentration camps actively lectured to small groups in private apartments. The attendants were constantly risking deportation and death.

Most of the underground education was organized by the Secret Teaching Organization (&quot;Tajna Organizacja Nauczycielska&quot;, &quot;TON&quot;), which took care of the underground primary and secondary level education. Norman Davies notes that the Organization undertook the education of a million children. By 1942, about 1,500,000 students took part in underground primary education; in 1944, the clandestine secondary school system covered 100,000 people and the secret university level courses about 10,000.

The net of underground university faculties spread rapidly and by 1944 there were more than 300 lecturers and 3,500 students at various courses at the Warsaw University alone. Underground Law and Social Sciences faculties, as well as Humanities, Medical, Theological, Mathematical and Biology faculties were kept alive at Stefan Batory University in Wilno (now Vilnius) from 1939 until 1944 with lectures, seminars and exams.

The main universities included the University of Lwów, Warsaw University, Stefan Batory University in Wilno and Jagiellonian University in Kraków. A new University of Western Lands (&quot;Uniwersytet Ziem Zachodnich&quot;) was created in Warsaw, with branches in Kielce, Jędrzejów, Częstochowa and Milanówek. The latter university was composed mostly of the professors of Adam Mickiewicz University of Poznań and included 17 different units, among them the faculty of medicine and surgery.

Almost 10,000 students received master&#x27;s degrees at the secret universities and several hundred others received doctorates. Secret printing houses that sprang up across Poland shortly after the war started, provided the facilities of secret learning with handbooks and scripts.

The professors organized a net of secret high schools, trade schools and special courses on forbidden subjects, such as the Polish language, history and geography. A special case were the secret talmudic schools organized in ghettos. Until 1944 there were more than a million secret high school students in Poland. At least 18,000 students passed their final school exams and received their certificates. This led to a bizarre situation in which students of formally non-existent high schools entered formally non-existent universities. Most of these certificates were issued on pre-war forms with the dates forged to indicate either 1938 or 1939. These were later accepted by post-war Polish universities.

There was also a net of secret military colleges in most major cities. Until 1944, most of Armia Krajowa regiments had their military schools for Non-commissioned officers (NCOs) while the regional headquarters organized officer courses and special training. The Szare Szeregi (the underground Polish Scouting Association) opened its own NCO school in Warsaw nicknamed Agricola.

Religious education and training also took place. Prominently, the Roman Catholic Church operated underground seminaries for the education of priests. One well-known seminary was run by the Archbishop of Kraków, Cardinal Sapieha and trained future Cardinal and Pope, John Paul II (Karol Wojtyla).
