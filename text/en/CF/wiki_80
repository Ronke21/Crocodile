<text>The BMW M3 is a high-performance version of the BMW 3 Series, developed by BMW&#x27;s in-house motorsport division, BMW M GmbH. M3 models have been produced for every generation of 3 Series since the E30 M3 was introduced in 1986.

The initial model was available in a coupé body style, with a convertible body style made available soon after. M3 saloons were offered initially during the E36 (1994–1999) and E90 (2008–2012) generations. Since 2014, the coupé and convertible models have been rebranded as the 4 Series range, making the high-performance variant the M4. Variants of the 3 Series since then have seen the M3 produced as a saloon, until 2020, when the M3 was produced as an estate (Touring) for the first time, alongside the saloon variant.


== E30 generation (1986–1991) ==
The first BMW M3 was based on the E30 3 Series and was intended to be a homologation special to satisfy the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft and Group A Touring rules, which required a total of 5,000 cars to be built. It was presented to the public at the 1985 Frankfurt Motor Show, and began production from March 1986 to June 1991. The E30 M3 was mainly produced in the coupé body style, but limited volumes of convertibles were also produced.

The front splitter, the rear apron, sill panels, as well as changes to the body in the area of the rear window (C-pillar) and the bootlid improved the aerodynamics. For aerodynamic reasons, the rear window was flattened and the tailgate was made of light, glass-reinforced plastic raised by approximately 40 mm for better air flow. The changes over the rear of the car resulted in lower lift forces and better straight-line stability. In addition, the windscreen was glued in – not, as with the other E30 models, framed with a window rubber and piping. As a result, the M3 achieved a relatively low instead of as in the standard 3 Series. The only exterior body panels the regular 3 Series and the M3 shared were the bonnet, roof panel, and sunroof.

The brake calipers, discs and master cylinder were unique to the M3 model.

The transmission was a &quot;Getrag 265&quot; 5-speed manual. European models were outfitted with a dogleg version with close ratios and a 1:1 ratio for fifth gear. North American models used a traditional shift pattern and had wider gear spacing with an overdriven fifth gear. A clutch-type limited-slip differential was standard equipment.

In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; named the E30 M3 number six on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1980s. In 2007, &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot; included the E30 M3 in their &quot;5 greatest drivers cars of all time&quot; under their 25 Greatest Cars of All Time.


=== Engine ===

The E30 M3 used the BMW S14 four-cylinder engine, a high-revving DOHC design with a head closely based on that of the BMW S38 six-cylinder engine and the block from the BMW M10 four-cylinder engine with a 7,250 rpm redline. In countries where the M3 was sold with a catalytic converter, the initial versions were rated at and had a top speed of . In countries where a catalytic converter was not fitted, the engine was rated at .

=== Suspension &amp; Brakes ===
Differences from the standard E30 models included:
* 5-stud wheel hubs
* 225/45R16 Pirelli P700-Z tyres
* offset control arm bushings in the front suspension, for increased caster angle
* front aluminium control arms introduced in 1989
* revised front strut tubes with bolt on kingpins and swaybar mounted to strut tube, similar to the E28 5 Series
* front wheel bearings and brake caliper bolt spacing from the E28 5 Series
* 280mm x 25mm vented front &amp; 282mm x 12mm solid rear discs
* brake calipers similar to the E28 5 series

=== Special Editions ===

==== Evolution 1 ====
In 1987 an &quot;Evolution&quot; model (also called &quot;EVO1&quot;) was released. Although not designated by BMW as an Evolution model, these had a revised cylinder head (designated by an &quot;E&quot; stamp) to improve performance. Power was unchanged from the standard M3. Visually, these were unchanged from the standard E30 M3. In total, 505 were built between March and May 1987. To celebrate the M3’s victory at the 1987 Tour de Corse (round five of that year&#x27;s World Rally Championship), BMW France commissioned a batch of 50 Evolution 1 special editions.

==== Evolution 2 ====
To keep the M3 competitive for the 1988 season, the Evolution 2 was released. 501 examples were built between March and May 1988, it featured a revised camshaft, pistons and an increased compression ratio from 10.5:1 to 11.0:1. There was also a more efficient air intake and a lightened flywheel. Visually the Evolution 2 featured a BMW Motorsport tricolour camshaft and intake plenum cover. Power increased to at 6750 rpm and at 4750 rpm. For the Evolution 2, BMW installed a slightly reduced final drive ratio to provide a higher top speed (3.15:1 instead of 3.25:1).

Visual changes included a deeper front air dam with brake cooling ducts instead of fog lights, while the boot lid featured a rear spoiler complete with a new trailing flap. These assemblies were all made lighter than on previous iterations of the M3. More weight was saved thanks to the installation of thinner side and rear glass.

==== Sport Evolution ====
For 1990, a more powerful and lighter &quot;Sport Evolution&quot; model (sometimes referred to as &quot;EVO3&quot;) with a limited production run of 600 units, was produced with an upgraded engine rated at at 7,000 rpm and at 4,750 rpm. The top speed was increased to . Sport Evolution models have enlarged front bumper openings and an adjustable multi-position front splitter and rear wing. Brake cooling ducts were installed in place of front foglights.

==== Ravaglia and Cecotto editions ====
In April 1989, the Ravaglia and Cecotto limited editions were released, both named after &quot;Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft&quot; (DTM) racing drivers. Power was increased to with a catalytic converter. Cecotto Edition production consisted of 480 cars, plus 80 cars for the Swiss market de-tuned to to meet Swiss emissions limits. The production run for the Ravaglia Edition consisted of 25 cars.

=== M3 Pickup prototype ===
In 1986, BMW produced an &quot;M3 Pickup&quot; prototype pickup truck, based on the convertible model. The M3 Pickup used the narrower body of regular E30 models and was originally powered by the 2.0-litre version of the S14 engine from the Italian-specification M3. It was used by BMW M as a transporter for roughly 26 years before it was officially retired in 2012.

=== Production volumes ===
Total production of the E30 M3 was 17,970 cars.

=== Motorsport ===

The M3 E30 competed in many forms of motorsport and was highly successful in touring car racing. In full race trim, the 1988 M3&#x27;s naturally aspirated engine was rated at approximately . The E30 M3 won the 24 Hours Nürburgring five times (1989, 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1994) and the Spa 24 Hours four times (1987, 1988, 1990 and 1992), often competing against cars with significantly larger or turbocharged engines.

To keep the car competitive in racing following year-to-year homologation rules changes, homologation specials were produced and sold in limited volumes. These include the Evo 1, Evo 2, and Sport Evolution, with upgrades including weight reduction, improved aerodynamics, taller front wheel arches (to allow 18-inch wheels to be used in DTM racing), bigger brake ducts and more power output from the engine. With the introduction of the 2.5L evolution engine into racing in 1990, power increased to approximately .

The M3 also competed as a rally car, with Prodrive-prepared examples contesting several national championships and selected rounds of the World Rally Championship between 1987 and 1989. By the latter year, the cars, based on the regular M3, were equipped with six-speed gearboxes and were rated at . The M3 was not very competitive with the four-wheel drive cars on loose surfaces, but it was a very effective car on asphalt. Its most notable success was a victory on the Tour de Corse in 1987, driven by Bernard Béguin.

==== Championships ====
* World Touring Car Championship; 1 title (1987)
* European Touring Car Championship; 2 titles (1987 and 1988)
* British Touring Car Championship; 2 titles (1988 and 1991)
* Italia Superturismo Championship; 4 titles (1987, 1989, 1990 and 1991)
* Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft; 2 titles (1987 and 1989)
* Australian Touring Car Championship; 1 title (1987)
* Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship; 1 title (1993)
* Australian Manufacturers&#x27; Championship; 2 titles (1987 and 1988 – both shared)
* AMSCAR Series; 2 titles (1987, 1991)
* Irish Tarmac Rally Championship; 1 title (1990)
*Japanese Touring Car Championship; 7 titles in JTC-2 (1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993)

== E36 generation (1992–1999) ==
The M3 model of the E36 3 Series was released in November 1992 and was initially available as a coupé only, with a convertible version added in 1994. A saloon version was also added in December 1994, to fill in the gap caused by the lack of the M5 saloon model between the end of E34 M5 production in 1995 and the launch of the E39 M5 in 1998.

In September 1995, a facelift version of the coupé was introduced. Changes included the engine displacement increasing to , the manual transmission upgrading from a 5-speed to a 6-speed, different wheels and clear indicator lenses. The facelift changes were applied to the saloon model in November 1995 and the convertible model in February 1996. The kerb weight of the 1996 M3 coupe in European specification is .

The facelift also saw the introduction of a 6-speed &quot;SMG&quot; automated manual transmission, the first time an automated transmission was available on an M3 outside the United States. The SMG transmission was praised for its fast shift times and operation in performance situations, but criticized for behavior in everyday driving situations.

In 1996, BMW M hand-built an E36 M3 Compact prototype as an M-car which would appeal to younger customers. It included various performance and styling features of the E36 M3, including the 3.2-litre S50 engine. The M3 Compact was reviewed in the German magazine &quot;&quot;, but never reached production.

=== Engine ===
The E36 M3 is powered by the BMW S50 straight-six engine. It was the first M3 to use a six-cylinder engine, which has since been used in the majority of M3 models (albeit in turbocharged form since 2014).

In most countries, the initial version generated at 7,000 rpm and at 3,600 rpm. North American models (except for the limited edition Canadian &quot;M3 Euro-Spec&quot; model) used the less powerful BMW S50B30US engine instead.

The facelift models in late 1995 were upgraded to a version of the BMW S50 engine, generating at 7,400 rpm and at 3,250 rpm. North American models used the less powerful BMW S52 engine instead.
=== Special editions ===

==== M3 GT (Europe) ====

In 1994, BMW produced the limited-edition M3 GT as a racing homologation special for Europe, in order to compete in the FIA-GT class II, IMSA GT and international long-distance races. A total of 356 cars were produced, all in left-hand drive for mainland Europe. The UK received a special GT trim limited to 50 cars with only the cosmetic upgrades of the homologation special.

The engine was the European-specification S50B30, which was upgraded with larger camshafts and a higher compression ratio, resulting in peak power of at 7,100rpm.

All M3 GTs only came in one single colour, &quot;British Racing Green&quot;. Other changes include a deeper and adjustable front splitter, higher rear double wing, aluminum doors, wheels measuring 17 x 7.5 inches at the front and 17 x 8.5 inches at the rear, stiffer front suspension, a cross-brace and a strut brace. The M3 GT is approximately lighter than the regular M3 and has a derestricted top speed of .

====M3 Evolution Imola Individual====
The M3 Evolution Imola Individual is a limited-edition variant of the M3 (50 for the United Kingdom). The engine and performance characteristics of the car were unchanged from the 1996 European M3, and a special exterior and interior colour combination was chosen by BMW UK: &quot;Imola Red&quot; (405) paint with Nappa leather seats in Imola Red and Amaretta suede bolsters in anthracite. It also included side airbags, the M3 GT Class II rear spoiler, front class II corner splitter extensions, electric seats, and double-spoke polished alloy wheels.

Prior to the release of the Imola Individual there was a pre-production model made which was used as the basis of the special edition. It featured the Class II front splitter and rear spoiler, special order Imola Red paint, special order Nappa leather and Anthracite Amaretta suede interior, SMG gearbox, GSM phone kit, headlamp washers and double-spoke polished alloy wheels.

==== M3 Lightweight (US Only) ====
Following the introduction of the E36 M3, racing teams in the United States began pressuring BMW for a homologation version in order to compete in sports-car racing. As a result, the &#x27;M3 Lightweight&#x27; was introduced in 1995. The cars came without a radio (although the speakers were installed and the car pre-wired for the radio), air conditioning, leather seats, tool kit or a sunroof. The doors have aluminium skins. There is no under bonnet insulation blanket, and the boot only has carpet on the floor. The under body insulation is thinner and there is special carpeting to lower weight. Overall the changes resulted in a weight less than a regular M3. The wheels are 17 inches in diameter, with a width of 7.5 inches at the front and 8.5 inches at the rear. The tyres fitted were 235/40ZR17.

Powertrain changes included the removal of the top speed limiter and a shorter differential ratio (3.23 compared to 3.15). Suspension upgrades consisted of shorter springs from the European-specification M3. Before being sold, the M3 Lightweights were sent to Prototype Technology Group Racing in Virginia for final preparation, which included the front and rear Motorsport flag decals, and &quot;trunk kit&quot;. In the boot there was a dual-pickup oil pump (from the European-specification M3), front strut bar, lower cross-brace, spacer blocks to raise the rear wing, and an adjustable front splitter. Each owner was given a 1-page legal document to sign acknowledging that any installation of boot items voided the new car warranty.

All M3 Lightweight cars were produced in the &quot;Alpine White&quot; exterior colour, with the Motorsports flag decals on the left front and right rear corners of the car. There is a fixed wing on the bootlid, some carbon fibre interior trim, and the badges on the side moulding and dash read &quot;BMW Motorsport International&quot;.

Although BMW promised to build approximately 100 cars, BMW never released the production numbers of M3 Lightweights built. However, it is estimated that approximately 125 were built.

==== Canadian Edition ====
Prior to the release of the North American specification M3, BMW Canada sold 45 of the European specification M3s. At the time, BMW North America was opposed to importing the E36 M3 (due to its high price and the poor sales of the previous M3). The Canadian Edition M3 was imported using a loophole that allows low volumes of Norwegian-certified cars to be sold in Canada. Despite a high price of nearly $60,000 CAD, all 45 cars were sold in 3 days. 42 of the M3s arrived in Canada via boat in January 1994, with the final 3 cars shipping sometime in the following few months. As with other European specification M3s, these 45 cars had the version of the S50 engine, oil temperature gauge and glass headlights, as well as Canadian-required equipment such as a third brake light and daytime running lights. Each of the Canadian Edition cars has an individually-numbered plaque on the inside of the glovebox which reads &quot;S50 B30 Limited Production Canadian Edition&quot; as well as a special owners manual pouch with a similar plaque. The cars were numbered at random, with no correlation to VIN numbers, options or production date.

When the North American specification M3 was released in 1995, it was initially not available in Canada. Sales of the North American M3 in Canada began in 1997.

==== M3-R (Australia) ====
In order to race in the Australian Super Production series, fifteen M3-Rs were sold by BMW Australia in 1994. With a power output of , the M3-R is the most powerful production E36 M3. Four of the cars were used for the race series, while the remaining eleven were sold to the general public. Buyers were required to possess a CAMS motorsport licence in order to purchase an M3-R.

The cars were delivered to the workshop of the Frank Gardner racing team for final preparation. A bolt-in FIA-approved roll cage was a factory option. Suspension upgrades consisted of new springs, adjustable struts and rear perches. Engine upgrades consisted of AC Schnitzer camshafts, dual pickup sump, an oil restrictor in the head and a cold air snorkel into the air filter box replacing the left hand foglight.

Other changes included four piston front brake calipers, a shorter (3.25:1) differential ratio, the driveshaft from the M5, a twin-plate clutch, a non-functional rear seat, no air conditioning, a deeper front splitter and a larger rear spoiler. The cars were individually numbered with a plaque fitted to the centre console near the handbrake.

==== M3 GTR (Germany) ====
The E36 M3 GTR is the road-going version of the competition machine built to compete in the 1993 ADAC German GT Cup Touring Car series. In 1993, a single road-going example was made. It featured a widebody kit, stripped interior, seam-welded body, upgraded suspension, and a stroked (from 2,990 to 3,018 cc) engine.

=== Production ===
Production of the E36 M3 began in September 1992 and was discontinued in August 1999.

The majority of cars were produced at the BMW Regensburg factory in Germany; however, a small number of low compression right-hand drive cars were assembled at BMW&#x27;s plant in Rosslyn, South Africa. In total, 46,525 coupés, 12,114 convertibles and 12,603 saloon were produced. The saloon ceased production in December 1997, the coupé in late 1998, and the convertible in December 1999.

===North American models===
Despite being released in other countries in 1992, the E36 M3 was not sold in the United States until 1995. A key difference between the &quot;European specification&quot; M3 (sold in the rest of the world) and the US M3 is the less powerful S50B30US engine used in the US M3, which was rated at and . Other notable differences included an optional 5-speed ZF 5HP torque-converter automatic transmission, suspension changes, and single piece brake discs (instead of floating discs). The changes were made in order to reduce the price of the M3, as the US dealers believed the European specification M3 would be too expensive to sell well.

In November 1996, the engine was upgraded to the BMW S52, with the same power outputs of , but with torque increased to . The manual gearbox remained a 5-speed, despite the European versions being upgraded to a 6-speed version.

US sales figures include a total of 18,961 coupés, 7,760 saloon and 6,211 convertibles.

=== Motorsport ===

The introduction of the E36 M3 coincided with BMW&#x27;s withdrawal from the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM), resulting in BMW focussing instead on the 318i and 320i models in the Super Tourenwagen Cup. Nonetheless, the E36 M3 competed in many motorsport events. In 1993, the E36 M3 GTR won the German ADAC GT Cup, driven by Johnny Cecotto. The M3 GT competed in the European FIA GT Championship.

In the United States, the Prototype Technology Group (PTG) Racing in Virginia ran the E36 M3 in the IMSA GT Championship. In the 1996 IMSA GT Championship, the M3 won 4 races in the GTS-2 class and BMW won the manufacturer&#x27;s championship. In the 1997 IMSA GT Championship, the M3 won 8 races in the GTS-3 class, with BMW winning the manufacturer&#x27;s championship again and Bill Auberlen winning the driver&#x27;s championship. In the 1998 IMSA GT Championship, the M3 won 5 races and BMW won the manufacturer&#x27;s championship in the GT3 class. The same year, the M3 won 4 races in the GT2 class. The M3 also competed in the 2000 American Le Mans Series, taking one win in the GT class.

In Australia, the M3-R competed in the Australian GT Production Car Championship.

== E46 generation (2000–2006) ==
The M3 version of the E46 3 Series was produced in coupé and convertible body styles. The E46 M3 is powered by the S54 straight-six engine and has a acceleration time of 5.2 seconds for the coupé, with either the manual or SMG-II transmission. The skidpad cornering results are 0.89g for the coupé and 0.81g for the convertible. The top speed is electronically limited to . The kerb weight is .

The available transmissions were a Getrag 420G 6-speed manual transmission or an SMG-II 6-speed automated manual transmission, which was based on the Getrag 420G. The SMG-II used an electrohydraulically actuated clutch, and gear shifts could be selected via the shift lever or paddles mounted on the steering wheel. The SMG-II was praised for its fast shift times and racetrack performance, but some people found its shifts to be delayed and lurching in stop-start traffic.

Total production of the E46 M3 was 56,133 coupés and 29,633 convertibles. The cars were assembled at the BMW Regensburg factory in Germany, and production was from September 2000 until August 2006, for a total of 85,766 cars.

An M3 Touring station wagon prototype was built to evaluate the feasibility of building an M3 model on the existing platform of the E46 station wagon (especially the integration of the M3&#x27;s wider rear wheel arches onto the wagon body). The prototype did not reach production.

=== Engine ===

The S54 engine is the final evolution of the BMW S50 naturally aspirated straight-six engine. The S54 is rated at at 7,900 rpm, at 4,900 rpm, and has a redline of 8,000 rpm. As with most M engines, the S54 has individual throttle bodies for each cylinder, with electronic throttle control (drive-by-wire) operation of the throttles being a new feature for the S54.

=== Development and launch ===
Concept design of the M3 began in 1997. The head of exterior design was Ulf Weidhase and the head of interior design was Martina Bachmann.

The M3 was previewed at the 1999 International Motor Show Germany as a concept, resembling the final production version very closely. The final production version was first introduced in March 2000 at the Geneva Motor Show, with the new 3.2L S54 M-tuned inline-6 engine.

=== Special editions ===

==== CSL ====
The BMW M3 CSL (, meaning &#x27;Coupé Sport Lightweight&#x27;) is a limited edition version of the M3 that was produced in 2004, with production totaling to 1,383 cars. It was available in two colours: &quot;Silver Grey Metallic&quot; and &quot;Black Sapphire Metallic&quot;.

As its name suggests, an emphasis was put on reducing weight. The CSL has a curb weight of , lighter than the regular M3. Structural weight reduction measures include the use of glass-reinforced plastics in various structural points in the car, a roof constructed from carbon fibre reinforced plastic (reducing kerb weight by and, more importantly, lowering the centre of gravity), body panels constructed from carbon fibre and thinner glass for the rear window.

The boot floor cover was made of lightweight fibre-board (not cardboard as infamously described on the Top Gear television show). The CSL discarded a large proportion of the M3&#x27;s sound insulation, electric seats, navigation system, air conditioning, and stereo (the latter two were able to be re-added as no-cost options). The interior includes fibreglass front racing bucket seats, a fibreglass backing for the rear seats, and carbon fibre for the centre console, door panels, door trim, and head-liner. The steering wheel has just a single button which activates the M track mode, instead of the buttons for cruise control, stereo, and phone controls on the regular M3. The CSL retained the 50:50 weight distribution of the regular M3.

The wheels were increased in size to 19 inches. BMW took the unusual approach of supplying the CSL with semi-slick tyres (Michelin Pilot Sport Cup). These tyres provided high grip levels once warmed up on a racetrack, but poor performance on wet roads and when below their operating temperature. A warning label was included in the CSL to inform drivers about driving in cold or wet conditions. The brakes were upgraded with larger floating discs at the front and larger pistons at the rear.

The suspension system was revised with stiffer springs, upgraded shock absorbers and a quicker ratio for the steering rack (14.5:1 vs 15.4:1 on the regular M3). The electronic stability control was retuned and an &quot;M track mode&quot; was added, allowing higher thresholds before the system intervened.

The engine used in the CSL had increased output over the regular S54 by and over the European M3. This is due to the use of sharper profile camshafts, a bigger air intake with carbon fibre manifold, a refinement of the exhaust manifold, and slightly different exhaust valves. The top speed was electronically limited as standard, but buyers with a current motorsport licence could order the CSL with the speed limiter removed. The sole transmission available was the 6-speed SMG II automated transmission, with revised software resulting in shift times of 80 milliseconds.

The aerodynamics were also revised, including a carbon fibre front splitter that improved downforce at high speeds by 50%, and a carbon fibre rear diffuser. The front bumper had a distinct hole that is used to draw cool air into the newly designed air intake. The bootlid was redesigned to incorporate a raised lip, unlike the regular M3 where one is simply added onto a flat boot.

==== Prototype CSL ====
In 2002, BMW M revealed a special V8 prototype engine (full model code &quot;S62B40&quot;) for the M3 CSL which was previously fitted to the E39 M5 and the E52 Z8. The S62 was BMW&#x27;s first V8 engine to have double-VANOS (variable valve timing on the intake and exhaust camshafts). However, this prototype S62 engine produces at 6,600 rpm and at 3,800 rpm. The last difference results in a displacement of , compared with the of the S62 engine found in the M5 and Z8 vehicles.

==== Competition Package / CS ====
In 2005, a special edition was introduced which used several parts from the CSL. This model was called the M3 Competition Package (ZCP) in the United States and mainland Europe, and the M3 CS in the United Kingdom. Compared to the regular M3, the Competition Package includes:
* 19-inch BBS alloy wheels: 19in×8in at the front and 19in×9.5in at the rear.
* Stiffer springs (which were carried over to the regular M3 from 12/04).
* Faster ratio steering rack of 14.5:1 (compared with the regular M3&#x27;s ratio of 15.4:1) as with the CSL
* Steering wheel from the CSL
* M-track mode for the electronic stability control, as with the CSL.
* The CSL&#x27;s larger front brake discs (but with the regular M3 front calipers) and rear brake calipers with larger pistons.
* Alcantara steering wheel and handbrake covers.

The engine, gearbox, and other drivetrain components are the same as the standard M3.

==== GTR Straßenversion (Street Version) ====
In order to homologate the M3 GTR for racing, a road version was developed during calendar year 2001 and shown for the first time at the season ending ALMS Petit Le Mans race. BMW produced 10 development units of which 3 were production ready display cars. For homologation purposes, the M3 GTR needed to be offered for sale to the general public and by Petit Le Mans 2001, the car was ready. The M3 GTR was to be priced at , When ALMS changed the homologation rules at the end of the 2001 season, the road version project was stopped. All 7 development prototypes were recycled but the three production ready display cars exist to this day and all still owned by BMW AG. One of the Road M3 GTRs was displayed by BMW of North America LLC at &quot;Legends of the Autobahn&quot; in 2015 along with the newly restored ALMS race version of the car. The road cars were built alongside bodies-in-white of the GTR race cars in the special vehicles department of BMW&#x27;s Regensburg Plant.

As with the race car, the GTR road car was powered by the 4.0-litre P60 V8 engine. The engine retained the race cars&#x27; dry sump oil system and was slightly detuned from at 7,000 rpm. Top speed was . The transmission was a six-speed manual and the differential was the same variable locking unit as used in the race car.

The dry weight was . Weight reduction measures included a carbon fibre front bumper, rear bumper and rear wing.

The M3 GTR gained a cult following in the gaming community after it appeared in the 2005 video game &quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot;. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;, who collaborated on the first &quot;Need for Speed&quot; video game, described the game&#x27;s custom M3 GTR as being &quot;so iconic that fans still recreate the livery in real life.&quot; Once searched about the M3 GTR, nearly 85% of the results will relate the car to &quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot;. It also makes an appearance in &quot;Real Racing 3&quot;, with a special livery of the Need for Speed games and its own exclusive series as well.

In November 2024, BMW vinyl-wrapped the 2001 ALMS GT-winning #42 M3 GTR driven by Jörg Müller with the livery from &quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot; as a museum piece, and it was available for show in the BMW Welt Show at Munich from December 2024-January 2025.

=== North American models ===
The North American models used the same S54 engine as in other countries (unlike the previous generation, which used lower performance engines in the United States). Due to minor differences in specification, the United States models were rated at and , resulting in an official 0– acceleration time of 4.8 seconds for the coupé version (with either the manual and SMG transmission). As in other countries, top speed was electronically limited to .

The CSL model was not sold in the North American market.

=== Motorsport ===
In the United States, the E46 M3 competed in the 2000 American Le Mans Series GT category and finished third in the championship. The straight-six engine was viewed as uncompetitive compared to the Porsche 996 GT3, therefore BMW began to develop a new M3 racing car based around a more powerful engine. The resulting E46 GTR racing car was introduced in February 2001 and was powered by a version of the P60 V8 engine. With a more powerful engine than the straight-six powered M3 versions (which were outpaced by the competition), the GTR won the 2001 American Le Mans Series GT category, driven by Jörg Müller.

The eligibility of the GTR was the subject of controversy, with some rival teams believing that the GTR was an in-house prototype vehicle rather than a production model available for purchase by the general public. The ALMS homologation rules for 2001 required the M3 GTR road car to be sold on at least two continents within twelve months of the rules being issued, which BMW claimed to fulfill by stating that 10 GTR road cars were available for sale. The ALMS rules were altered for 2002, now requiring that 100 cars and 1,000 engines must be built for a car to qualify without penalties. The GTR road car was never intended for production on this scale, so BMW withdrew the GTR from competition at this point.

In 2003, the M3 GTR returned to competition at the 24 Hours Nürburgring, with two cars run by Schnitzer Motorsport. The GTR won the 24 Hours Nürburgring in 2004 and 2005, and competed in the 24 Hours Spa.

== E90/E92/E93 generation (2007–2013) ==
The M3 model of the E90/E92/E93 3 Series range was powered by the BMW S65 V8 engine and was produced in saloon, convertible and coupé body styles. The E9x is the first and only standard production M3 powered by a V8 engine as its successor would revert to using a straight 6 engine. In the standard M3, the S65 engine rated at at 8,400 rpm and at 3,900 rpm.

Initially, the M3 was produced with a 6-speed manual transmission. In April 2008, the E90/E92/E93 M3 became the first BMW to be available with a dual-clutch transmission when the 7-speed Getrag &quot;M-DCT&quot; transmission was introduced as an option.

The official acceleration times for the coupé and saloon are 4.6 seconds with the DCT transmission (4.8 seconds with the manual transmission) and 5.1 seconds for the convertible.

The E90 and E92 versions received many positive reviews, including &quot;the greatest all-around car in the world&quot;, &quot;the finest car on the market, period&quot; and &quot;the best, most complete car in the world&quot;.

=== Development and production ===

Total production of the E9x M3 was 40,092 coupés, 16,219 convertibles and 9,674 saloon. Production of saloon models finished in 2011, with coupés remaining in production until July 5, 2013.

=== Body styles ===
The first body style to be introduced was the coupé, which was previewed at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show and introduced in production form at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show on 12 September. The coupé version uses a carbon fibre roof to reduce weight and lower the centre of gravity. In 2010, the coupé and convertible versions received a minor facelift, which included revised LED tail-lights and minor interior trim pieces but it did not get the updated headlights from the regular series.

The E93 convertible version was introduced shortly after the coupé and uses a power retractable hardtop. The leather seats in the convertible version are treated with a coating to reflect sunlight, in order to reduce their tendency to become uncomfortably hot with the top down.

A saloon version was introduced in 2008 and was the second (along with the E36) M3 by generation to be produced in a 4-door body style. The saloon has the same drivetrain and similar external styling as the coupé, however the lack of a carbon fibre roof contributes to a weight increase of compared to an identically equipped coupé.

The official kerb weights for the 2008 European-specification models (with manual transmission) are for the coupé, for the saloon and for the convertible.

=== M Performance Parts ===
M Performance Parts were made for the sixth generation M3. These include black kidney grilles, M rims, an M Performance exhaust that reduces the weight by , carbon fibre mirrors, spoilers and splitter, a handbrake, steel pedals, a sport steering wheel, black side trim and alcantara leather steering wheel button trim, M stripes decal.

=== Special editions ===

==== Competition Package (ZCP) ====
The &quot;Competition Package&quot; (sometimes known as ZCP) version was released in 2010. The changes related to the suspension and electronic stability control and consisted of:
* Ride height lowered by 
* Revised tuning of the adjustable dampers (Electronic Damping Control)
* An &quot;M&quot; mode for the electronic stability control
* 19-inch wheels (Styling 359)

==== GTS ====
BMW announced the M3 GTS in November 2009 and began production in 2010. The GTS was designed as a &quot;road-legal clubsport-oriented model&quot; and produced only in the coupé body style. Changes over the regular M3 include an upgraded engine, reduced curb weight, revised suspension, upgraded brakes and adjustable aerodynamics.

The GTS uses an engine enlarged to which has a power output of . The sole transmission option was the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (M-DCT) and the official acceleration time for the GTS is 4.4 seconds.

The car weighs less than the regular M3, due to a lighter centre console and door panels, polycarbonate side and rear windows, a lack of rear seats and the removal of acoustic insulation.

Suspension changes include adjustable camber angle and ride height, a rigidly mounted rear axle and revised dampers. The front brakes were upgraded to 6-piston callipers with larger discs, and the rear brakes were upgraded to 4-piston callipers with larger discs. Aerodynamics are adjustable via the front apron and the angle of the rear wing. Production was limited to 135 cars, which sold out quickly.
==== CRT ====

The M3 CRT (Carbon Racing Technology) was a special edition of the M3 saloon that was produced in 2011. The CRT was powered by the same 4.4 litre version of the S65 engine as the GTS, however it retained a higher level of luxury features compared to the track-focused GTS. The CRT used a carbon fibre bonnet and front seats to reduce weight, resulting in a kerb weight approximately lower than an equivalently specified version of the regular M3 saloon.

Production was limited to 67 cars, all numbered with a plaque on the dashboard. The official acceleration time was 4.4 seconds.

==== DTM Champion Edition ====
BMW Motorsport returned to the DTM in 2012, and 54 &quot;DTM Champion Edition&quot; cars were built to commemorate the BMW M3 winning the championship. The unique features of the DTM Champion Edition consisted of visual changes to associate the car with the DTM race car, such as the &quot;Frozen Black&quot; paint colour, stripes over the roof and bootlid, carbon flaps, a gurney flap and matte black wheels. Interior changes included carbon fibre for some interior trim items, an &quot;M Power&quot; logo embroidered on the handbrake grip and a numbered plaque with Spengler&#x27;s signature and the text &quot;DTM champion 2012&quot; above the glove box. All cars were produced with the dual-clutch transmission.

==== Lime Rock Park Edition (US) ====

In the United States, the M3 Lime Rock Park Edition was produced for the 2013 model year. A total of 200 cars were sold, all coupés painted in the &quot;Fire Orange&quot; colour. Performance changes included a carbon fibre front splitter and rear spoiler, a ride height lowered by , higher thresholds for the electronic stability control and a lightweight exhaust system. BMW claims the same engine power output as the regular M3, however, when marketing the lightweight Inconel-titanium BMW Motorsports Exhaust to stock M3 vehicles, BMW claims that the system adds about .

The interior of the Lime Rock Park Edition includes a plaque reading &quot;One of 200&quot;.

==== Frozen Edition ====
Due to the GTS version not being available in South Africa, BMW developed the BMW M3 Frozen Edition in 2009. The engine was upgraded to generate , due to an AC Schnitzer intake manifold and changes to the engine management system.

Twenty-five Frozen Edition cars were produced, all with exterior colours of either &quot;Frozen Black&quot; or &quot;Frozen Grey&quot;.

==== Competition Edition Frozen Silver ====
In 2012, BMW announced this edition with 40 to be built for US and 100 for Europe.

Built to commemorate the 40th anniversary of BMW&#x27;s M Division, each model came with &quot;Frozen Silver Metallic&quot; exterior paint. According to BMW, the colour is a special matte paint that adds a metallic lustre to the vehicle. The interior has black leather and palladium silver accessories.

=== M3 Pickup Prototype ===
The M3 Pickup is a one-off custom variant of the M3 which was based on the E93 M3 convertible and publicly announced on April Fool&#x27;s Day in 2011. It was used as a workshop transport vehicle for BMW M GmbH, replacing their E30 M3 pickup version after 26 years of use. The vehicle was assembled by M GmbH&#x27;s employees, as well as interns and engineering students.

=== Motorsport ===
The E92 M3 saw BMW return to the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) after a break of 20 years. In its debut season in 2012, the M3 won the drivers championship, the manufacturers championship and five out of ten races for the season.

In endurance racing, the BMW Motorsport/Schnitzer Motorsport M3 GT2 won the 2010 24 Hours of Nürburgring, driven by Jörg Müller, Augusto Farfus, Pedro Lamy, and Uwe Alzen. The M3 also qualified second at the 2010 24 Hours of Spa and led the race until being forced to retire in the final hour due to suspension failure. The M3 won the GT2 category in the ILMC 2010 1000 km of Zhuhai in China.

A GT4 version of the M3 was introduced in 2009 and competed in various races, including finishing third in the GT4 SP10 class at the 2009 24 Hours Nürburgring, and winning its class at the ADAC Westfalenfahrt race at the Nürburgring in April 2009. In July 2009, BMW Motorsport released an M3 GT4 model for sale to private teams and drivers; this included the GT2 body kit. The official kerb weight was and changes to the were claimed to be minimal. For the 2010 24 Hours Nürburgring, the &quot;Balance of Performance&quot; required the M3 to not exceed a power output of and to have a minimum weight of .

In the United States, Rahal Letterman Racing entered two factory-backed E92 M3s in the 2009 American Le Mans Series season, competing in the GT2 category. In 2011, the BMW achieved a 1–2 finish in the 12 Hours of Sebring. In the 2011 American Le Mans Series GT class, BMW Team RLL swept all categories, winning the GT manufacturer, team and driver championships. In 2012, the M3 won the GT class at the 12 Hours of Sebring. The #79 M3 GT2 that competed at Le Mans became the 17th BMW Art Car after it was decorated by Jeff Koons. The M3 GT2 was succeeded by the BMW Z4 GTE in 2013.
== F80 generation (2014–2018) ==
The M3 version of the F30 3 Series was designated the F80 and was produced from 2014 to 2018. The F80 M3 was powered by the BMW S55 twin-turbocharged straight-six engine, therefore being the first turbocharged M3 model. Despite the smaller displacement than the V8 engine used by the previous generation of M3, the switch from naturally aspirated engines to turbocharging resulted in peak power being increased from , and peak torque being increased from .

The official acceleration times are 3.9 seconds with the M-DCT transmission and 4.1 seconds with the manual transmission. Top speed is limited to but an optional M Driver&#x27;s package raises this to . The kerb weight is .

The F80 M3 was unveiled, alongside the F82 M4 (its coupé counterpart), at the 2014 North American International Auto Show. The two-door M3 had been renamed BMW M4 – in line with the new BMW 4 Series range.

<text>Esmat Bagherpour Baboli ( ; 22 February 1925 – 1 September 2004), better known as Delkash ( ), was an Iranian diva singer and occasional actress with a rare and unique voice.

==Biography==
Delkash was born in Babol, and was the daughter of a cotton trader who had nine other children. She came to Tehran to study (where she stayed until her death in 2004), but she was discovered soon and was introduced to the music masters of the time, Ruhollah Khaleghi and Abdolali Vaziri. She was named &quot;Delkash&quot; by Khaleghi.

Delkash started public singing in 1943 and was employed in Radio Iran in 1945, only five years after the establishment of the program. There, she worked with the composer Mehdi Khaledi for seven years, until 1952. The best of her songs were written by Rahim Moeini Kermanshahi, Iranian lyricist, and Ali Tajvidi, Iranian composer, from 1954 until 1969. Besides Persian, Delkash sang several songs, such as Kija and Banu, in her native Mazandarani language.

She also worked as a songwriter under the pen name of Niloofar (Persian: نیلوفر) and played in a few Iranian movies, including &quot;Sharmsaar&quot;, &quot;Maadar&quot;, &quot;Farda Roushan Ast&quot;, &quot;Afsoungar&quot;, and &quot;Dasiseh&quot;. She worked with singer and electric guitar musician Vigen Derderian &quot;Sultan of Jazz&quot;. Their duet &quot;Delam Mikhast&quot; can be heard on YouTube. Delkash died in September 2004, at the age of 79, in Tehran and was buried in Emamzadeh Taher, a popular graveyard for the artists located in Karaj.

<doc id="965778" wikidata="Q1689237" url="?curid=965778" title="Jim Walsh (Irish politician)">
<text>Jim Walsh (born 5 May 1947) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician and member of Seanad Éireann from 1997 to 2016.

==Early and personal life==
Walsh is a native of New Ross, County Wexford. Walsh attended New Ross Christian Brothers School. He is married to Marie Furlong, they have one son and two daughters. Outside of his Seanad duties, he works as a businessman and company director. He is a member of the Chartered Institute of Transport, a Senator of Junior Chamber International and is a former president of the Irish Road Hauliers&#x27; Association.

==Political career==
He was elected in 1974 to New Ross Town Council, serving as Mayor for nine terms and a member of Wexford County Council from 1979 to 2004, serving as Mayor from 1992 to 1993. Walsh was National Chairman of the Irish Local Authority Members Association from 1997 to 2002.

In 1997, he was first elected to Seanad Éireann by the Agricultural Panel. From 1997 to 2002, he served as government spokesman on Environment and Local Government in the Seanad. In subsequent terms he served as government spokesperson on Justice, Equality, and Law Reform between 2002 and 2007, and Communications, Energy, and Natural resources from 2007 to 2011. He is the Fianna Fáil Seanad spokesman on Foreign Affairs and Trade and a member of the Foreign Affairs and Trade Committee.

He is a board member of Parliamentarians for Global Action, a New York-based non-governmental organization dealing with peace, democracy, human rights and the rules of law. He is also a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) as well as being a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and a participant in the International Catholic Legislator&#x27;s Network since its inauguration.

Walsh has fulfilled a number of international speaking invitations in recent years. In 2011 he was invited to address a conference in Colombo, Sri Lanka on the Northern Ireland peace process. At the invitation of the Pontifical Council for the Family he read a paper on the topic of &quot;The Family&quot; at the World Meeting of Families in Milan, May 2012. At the PGA Conference in Bogota, Colombia, December 2013 he addressed the subject of &quot;Disarmament and Decommissioning—The Northern Ireland Experience and its Relevance for Colombia&quot;.

===Tribunals===
In April 2008, Walsh claimed &quot;that Chairmen of some of the tribunals used their position in order to act more or less as shop stewards for the wealthy legal profession&quot;. He later withdrew the comment, acknowledging that he may have caused offence.

===Civil partnership legislation===
On 24 April 2008, Walsh put forward a party motion to counter the proposed same-sex Civil Partnership Bill. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported that around 30 unidentified Fianna Fáil backbenchers had signed the motion. One anonymous Senator was quoted as claiming that the motion &quot;would have considerable support from the more conservative sections of the parliamentary party&quot;. The Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, responded by insisting that the registration of same-sex couples would not interfere with the constitutional status of marriage. Cowen noted that the Bill had been drawn up in close consultation with the Attorney General and had been included in the programme for government.

The motion was referred to the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party&#x27;s justice committee on 1 July 2008. Despite the challenge to the Bill, a Fianna Fáil spokesperson was quoted as saying that there was &quot;broad support&quot; within the party for the legislation, while the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern reaffirmed the constitutional compatibility of the proposed law.

Walsh has repeatedly called for a &quot;freedom of conscience&quot; amendment to the legislation which would bypass equality legislation, allowing people a religious exemption in providing goods and services to gay couples.

In the 2014 &quot;Pantigate&quot; controversy in which the national broadcaster RTÉ paid a purported €85,000 to conservative commentators, Walsh argued that some proponents of same-sex marriage were &quot;dangerous and vicious&quot;.

On 31 March 2015, he said in the Seanad that he could not support same-sex marriage and that the money spent on the marriage equality referendum would be better spent on testing the gay community for HIV.

===Views===
In November 2009, Walsh claimed that women working outside the home is a major cause of depression in young people, and also expressed annoyance that &quot;David Norris could describe gay people as &#x27;fairies&#x27; – while he could not&quot;.

On 7 July 2010, he resigned the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party whip, along with Labhrás Ó Murchú and John Hanafin, in protest at the Civil Partnership bill. He rejoined the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party on 23 November 2010.

On 16 July 2013, Walsh opposed the &quot;Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill&quot;, and during the Seanad debate quoted an anti-abortion pamphlet&#x27;s description of dilation and evacuation, which the bill&#x27;s supporters criticised as inappropriate.

In December 2015, in an abortion-related debate, Walsh told Senator Ivana Bacik that she should seek &quot;treatment for hemorrhoids&quot;.

In January 2016, he was re-admitted to the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party. He did not contest the 2016 Seanad election.

===Wikipedia editing===
In September 2015, Walsh admitted editing his own Wikipedia entry, claiming it had been edited by &quot;a person from the gay lobby groups&quot;. He said that he had removed &quot;certain erroneous comments&quot; but did not say which edits he made or what was erroneous. T.J. McIntyre, a law lecturer at University College Dublin drew attention to edits made from an IP address belonging to the Oireachtas. Edits made from that address included removal of controversial comments made by the former senator about gay people and the Marriage Equality referendum.

<doc id="965784" wikidata="Q6195324" url="?curid=965784" title="Jim Greenwood (rugby union)">
<text>James Thomson Greenwood (2 December 1928 – 13 September 2010) was a Scottish rugby union player and coach. He won twenty caps for and four for the British Lions as a number eight and flanker.

As a coach and coach educator, he was an advocate of &#x27;total rugby&#x27;. He is considered one of the most innovative and visionary thinkers in the game. In 2014 he was posthumously inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==
Greenwood was born in Fife and educated at Dunfermline High School and Edinburgh University, where he read English.

He played club rugby for Dunfermline RFC and the North and Midlands team. He also played for Harlequins, the RAF and Eastern Counties during his national service in the RAF. After touring with the British Lions, he played for Perthshire Academicals.

His first international was in 1952 against , but he was dropped shortly afterwards. However, he played well in the District matches and trials of 1954, leading to his re-selection for the national team. He became Scottish captain, but after losing 15–0 to , lost that position to Angus Cameron, while keeping his place on the team. In the next season, he became captain once more, and led the side for three more years.

He played mostly at No 8, but also at flanker, a position at which he was capped four times by the British Lions against during the Lions’ 1955 tour. Greenwood played 16 matches on the tour, and scored tries in the first and fourth tests of the series, which the Lions drew 2-2 with South Africa. In a newspaper report at the time, he was described as &quot;&quot;without equal among his contemporaries for a combination of skill, perception and deadly physical pace.&quot;

He played 18 games for the Barbarians between 1955 and 1958, the last being on 28 May 1958 at the RFUEA Ground, Nairobi, versus East Africa; a ground that he had previously visited whilst on tour with the Lions, though on that occasion he had not been selected to play. He also played for the combined Ireland/Scotland team against England/Wales in the 1959 Twickenham Jubilee match.

Greenwood was in contention for a place on the next Lions tour (in 1959), but suffered an injury (variously described as a broken collarbone or dislocated shoulder) playing against Ireland that season. Although he bravely played on, switching from number eight to flanker to accommodate his injury, he was forced to retire, aged 31.

Allan Massie wrote of him that:

:&quot;He was not a devastating tackler like Douglas Elliot or Ron Glasgow, though he was a very safe one. His first quality was his mobility; he was an example to young back-row players in the way he kept close to the ball and in his anticipation of the run of play. It brought him one notable Test try in South Africa when he gathered a cross-kick to surge over the line. He was one of the last forwards to be a notably good dribbler of the ball.&quot;

==Coaching career==
Greenwood was a teacher by profession, and taught at Glenalmond College, Cheltenham College and at Tiffin School in Kingston upon Thames.

He moved to Loughborough Colleges (now Loughborough University) in 1968, teaching English, Comparative Studies and coaching rugby. At Loughborough he influenced generations of rugby players, coaches and students including Clive Woodward, Andy Robinson, Fran Cotton, and Liza Burgess. Greenwood was an advocate of fifteen man &#x27;total rugby&#x27;, the whole team playing as a unit, and capable of both back and forward play. He was considered one of rugby&#x27;s leading thinkers, and has often been described as a coaching guru.

In the 1970s Greenwood ran rugby coaching courses at Loughborough&#x27;s Summer Schools, attended by coaches from across the UK and from countries such as Spain and Portugal. He later toured the world coaching and advising, helping to establish coaching structures in Argentina, Japan, the US and Canada. He spent two years at the University of Tsukuba in Japan, and earned the nickname &#x27;Mr Rugby&#x27; in New Zealand. He also coached the England women&#x27;s team, although he never coached a Scotland team.

He published three books – &quot;Improve Your Rugby&quot; (1967), &quot;Total Rugby&quot; (1978) and &quot;Think Rugby&quot; (1986). &quot;Total Rugby&quot; and &quot;Think Rugby&quot; are considered seminal books on rugby coaching, and have been updated and reprinted numerous times due to demand, as recently as 2015.

Greenwood described his views on the game:

:&quot;The rugby I’m concerned with as a coach is rugby at its most exciting – the 15-man handling game, in which every player is encouraged to show what we can do as an attacker, defender and supporting players, and in which the overall style of play gives him a chance to do so.&quot;

:&quot;I was a teacher rather than a coach. I tried to get people thinking. I wanted each player to be his own coach, to encourage the player to expand their awareness, to find truth wherever it lay. All coaching is one-to-one: there&#x27;s a place for the motivational speech, but it&#x27;s far more effective to talk to people individually.&quot;

Clive Woodward wrote of Greenwood:

:&quot;Basically, I went to Loughborough for one reason, to play my best rugby, and for one man, Jim Greenwood. If I was going to play for England, it made sense to go where the best coach was… Jim’s book, Total Rugby, is the only rugby coaching book I’ve ever read. It was way ahead of its time, and has since become a closely studied classic, especially in New Zealand… No man has done more in our time to single-handedly transform the modern game of rugby than Jim Greenwood.&quot;&quot;

He retired to the village of Crossmichael near Castle Douglas in Kirkcudbrightshire although he remained in demand as a consultant. He died aged 81 in 2010.

==Honours==
In 1998 Greenwood was one of the inaugural inductees into the National Coaching Foundation&#x27;s Hall of Fame, and won the prestigious Geoffrey Dyson Award for his outstanding contribution.

In 2014 he was posthumously inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame.

<text>Lamar &quot;Ditney&quot; Smith (1892 – August 13, 1955) was an American civil rights figure, African-American farmer, World War I veteran and an organizer of voter registration for African-Americans. In 1955, he was shot dead in broad daylight around 10 a.m. at close range on the lawn of the Lincoln County courthouse in Brookhaven, Mississippi.

==Details==
Lamar Smith, a 63-year-old farmer and World War I veteran, was a voting rights activist and a member of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership (RCNL). On August 2, he voted in the primary and helped get others out to vote. There was a run-off primary scheduled for August 23. On August 13, Smith was at the courthouse helping other African-American voters to fill out absentee ballots so they could vote in the runoff without exposing themselves to violence at the polls. He was shot to death in front of the courthouse in Brookhaven, Lincoln County, at around 10 a.m.

Contemporary reports say there were at least 30 white witnesses, including the local sheriff, who saw a white man covered with blood leaving the scene. In spite of a public effort by prosecutor E. C. Barlow to obtain testimony, no witnesses would come forward. The three men who had been arrested went free. Smith apparently had attended meetings of RCNL, probably the largest civil rights organization in the state. He was also a personal friend of RCNL president T. R. M. Howard of Mound Bayou.

In 2005, filmmaker Keith Beauchamp created a documentary, &quot;Murder in Black and White&quot; of Smith&#x27;s murder. In 2009, Beachamp and the FBI attempted to interview witnesses in Brookhaven. In 2018, Smith&#x27;s murder once again received national attention when it was discovered that the murderer was related to the husband of Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, who made campaign comments, which she claimed were jokes, about public hangings, and cast voter suppression in a positive light.

==Background==
Smith&#x27;s murder was one of several racially motivated attacks in Mississippi in 1955. The other incidents included the murder of George W. Lee, a civil rights leader in Belzoni (May), the killing of Emmett Till, a black teenager visiting from Chicago (August), and the shooting of Gus Courts (December), a civil rights associate of Lee in Belzoni. The Smith case was cited in the NAACP&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;M is for Mississippi and Murder&quot;.

==Lack of action==
Three white men, Noah Smith, Mack Smith and Charles Falvey, were arrested in connection with Smith&#x27;s murder. On September 13, 1955, an all-white Brookhaven grand jury composed of twenty men failed to return any indictments. The district attorney reported that the sheriff, Carnie E. Smith, refused to make an immediate arrest &quot;although he knew everything I know&quot;. The district attorney further reported that the sheriff told him he saw Noah Smith, one of the accused, &quot;leave the scene with blood all over him. It was his duty to take that man into custody regardless of who he was, but he did not do it.&quot; Noting that all three of the accused were deceased, the US Department of Justice Civil Rights Division closed the civil rights case in 2016.

<text>Francis Dana (June 13, 1743 – April 25, 1811) was an American Founding Father, lawyer, jurist, and statesman from Massachusetts. He served as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1777–1778 and 1784. A signer of the Articles of Confederation, he was secretary to the diplomatic mission that negotiated the end of the American Revolution, and was appointed Minister to Russia. He later served as a member of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and served as the chief justice for 15 years.

Dana&#x27;s wife Elizabeth was a daughter of Ann Remington and William Ellery, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. He was also the father-in-law of Washington Allston, a noted painter and poet.

==Biography==

Francis was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, the son of lawyer Richard Dana. He was educated at Harvard where he graduated in 1762, then read law and was admitted to the bar, after which he built a successful legal practice in Boston.

Being an opponent of the British colonial policy, he became a leader of the Sons of Liberty and was first elected to Massachusetts&#x27; provincial (revolutionary) Congress in 1774. In 1775 the Continental Congress dispatched him to England in an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the differences leading to the Revolutionary War. He returned the following year, convinced that a friendly settlement of the dispute was impossible, and was elected a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1777, where he signed the Articles of Confederation in 1778. As a member of the latter body, he became chairman in January 1778 of the committee appointed to visit General George Washington at Valley Forge and confer with him concerning the reorganization of the Continental Army. This committee spent about three months in camp and assisted Washington in preparing the plan of reorganization which Congress in the main adopted. In this year, he was also a member of a committee to consider Lord North&#x27;s offer of conciliation, which he vigorously opposed.

Dana left the Congress to accompany John Adams to Paris as a secretary to the diplomatic delegation. In 1780, he was named as American minister to the Russian Empire, and while he never gained official recognition from Catherine the Great, he remained in Saint Petersburg until 1783. After his return, he was again elected to the national Congress in 1784. In 1785, Dana was appointed to the Supreme Court of Massachusetts and served there until 1806 as the chief justice after 1791. An earnest advocate of the adoption of the Federal constitution, he was a member of the state convention which ratified it in 1788 and was one of the most influential advisers of the leaders of the Federalist Party, specifically its Essex Junto.

In 1792, Dana became a stockholder in a company that was formed to build a bridge to Cambridgeport over the Charles River. This became the West Boston Bridge, later the site of the Longfellow Bridge that exists today. The bridge was opened in November 1793. 

Dana generally retired from public life in 1806. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780 and actively supported the growth of Harvard University. His son, Richard Henry Dana Sr., was an important poet and literary critic as well as a lawyer. His grandson, Richard Henry Dana Jr., was a noted lawyer and author who served as U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts and wrote the classic &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; (1840).

== Death and legacy ==
Dana died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on April 25, 1811, and is buried in Cambridge&#x27;s Old Burying Ground. The former town of Dana, Massachusetts, was named for him. The Belchertown subdivision Dana Hill is, in turn, named for the former town. Six streets in Cambridge, MA are named for Dana or his relatives: Remington St, Kinnaird St, Ellery St, Allston St, Trowbridge St, and Dana St.

<doc id="965798" wikidata="Q6114706" url="?curid=965798" title="Jack Quinn (politician)">
<text>John Francis Quinn Jr. (born April 13, 1951) is a retired American politician and academic administrator from the state of New York. He was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005, and went on to serve as president of Erie Community College (ECC) from 2008 to 2017. 

A native of the Buffalo area, Quinn taught in Orchard Park, New York; worked at a steel plant; and before his election to Congress in 1992, was involved in local politics, sitting on the Hamburg Town Council, as well as serving as the town&#x27;s supervisor. While in Congress, he was considered a moderately conservative Republican, and was active in numerous committees, subcommittees, and caucuses as chair or member. Prior to becoming a congressional representative,as well as being the town&#x27;s supervisor. After leaving Congress and prior to taking the top leadership post at ECC, Quinn was also president of a lobbying firm in Washington, D.C.

==Background==
Quinn was born in Buffalo, New York on April 13, 1951. His father, Jack Quinn Sr., was a locomotive engineer with the South Buffalo Railway, and also worked at the Erie County Public Library. Quinn&#x27;s mother is Norma; and he has four brothers, Kevin, Jeffrey, Thomas, and Michael.

==Education==
Quinn graduated from Siena College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1973 and the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1978 with a Master&#x27;s degree in Education. Quinn also holds a school superintendent credential that he earned at the State University of New York at Fredonia.

==Pre-congressional career==

Quinn was a middle school English teacher in the Orchard Park Central School District for 10 years, where he coached track and field, basketball, and football. Prior to entering the teaching field, Quinn briefly worked at the Bethlehem Steel Plant in Lackawanna, New York. He served on the Hamburg, New York Town Council from 1982 to 1984, followed by a stint as town supervisor until 1993.

==Congressional career==

After the retirement of Congressman Henry Nowak, Quinn was elected to the House of Representatives in 1992 representing most of Buffalo and suburban Erie County in the 30th District. On paper, the district was heavily Democratic, and had been made even more Democratic after redistricting in 1992. However, Quinn defeated Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski in an upset. He was re-elected five more times by surprisingly wide margins in what was by far the most Democratic district in the nation to be represented by a Republican.

Quinn survived in this district in large part due to the close ties he developed with organized labor, something not common with most Republicans. Quinn worked to develop those ties even while voting against several programs and initiatives early in his career, a few of which included Amtrak subsidies, Social Security, and the Low Income Home Energy Assistant Program. Despite such votes and initially being an unknown, Quinn was successful in Buffalo, much as Jack Kemp was twenty years earlier. Quinn was also viewed as being honorable, and he did not have any character issues.

Despite a close relationship with Bill Clinton, whom he considers his friend, he voted for three of the articles of impeachment against him. There have been several suggestions that the House leadership pressured him into doing so, though Quinn, himself, denied this in a 1999 article in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. Quinn stated that his position in regard to impeaching Clinton was “a vote of conscience” that was “a personal decision and personally painful”, though he initially stated that the situation did not merit impeachment. It has been reported that Clinton&#x27;s 1999 visit to Buffalo after his State of the Union Address was in response to Quinn&#x27;s votes.

During the 2002 redistricting process, one map had Quinn drawn into a district with a longtime friend, Democrat John LaFalce. Ultimately, his district was preserved and renumbered as the 27th District. It covered nearly all of his former territory and added Chautauqua County. This came after New York lost a district in the 2000 census. On paper, the new 27th was slightly more Republican than the old 30th. However, had it existed in 2000, Al Gore would have carried it with 53 percent of the vote, one of his best showings for a district represented by a Republican.

On April 26, 2004, Quinn announced he would not seek re-election. After leaving Congress, Quinn reported that he had a 70% approval rating while in his position.

===Duties===
During his tenure in Congress, Quinn was a chair and/or active member of several committees, subcommittees, and caucuses.

Quinn was a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where he served as chairman of the Railroads Subcommittee. On the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Quinn was a member of the Transportation Subcommittees on Aviation, Surface Transportation, Mass Transit, and Water and Environment.

Quinn chaired both the Executive Committee of the Congressional Steel Caucusand the Benefits Subcommittee. He further chaired the Republican Working Group on Labor. Quinn was also a member of the Veteran&#x27;s Affairs Committee, and its related Subcommittee on Hospitals and Health Care. He served on the Joint Economic Committee as a member.

Further serving as a leader of Congressional committees, Quinn co-chaired both the Northern Border Caucus and the Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition.

Quinn was also a member of the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus; the Congressional Fire Services Caucus; and the Friends of Ireland Congressional Committee.

To aid his constituents, Quinn opened and closed more than 10,000 working cases during his time in Congress. This type of commitment to completing federal casework has been described as “legendary”.

===Political views===
Quinn&#x27;s political affiliation is Republican Conservative to Republican Moderate-Conservative. His political views placed him as a centrist between Democrats and Republicans on most issues on which he voted in Congress in 2004. Much later in his congressional career, his voting record was typically in the middle, falling between Democratic and Republican views.

In his first year in Congress, &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; reported that Quinn&#x27;s voting record was 84–85% Republican in support of the party line. During his first year, while there were issues that he voted in favor of, there were also those that he voted against, including a $16 million community development stimulus package for Buffalo. &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; reported that Quinn&#x27;s consistency in voting along Republican party lines was reflected in 87% of his votes by 2001.

A portion of Quinn&#x27;s voting record has been tracked, online, regarding issues such as abortion, education, energy and the environment, gay marriage, healthcare, homeland security, immigration, social security, stem cell research, taxes, the economy, the second amendment (the right to keep and bear arms), and both the War in Afghanistan and the War in Iraq.

Regarding abortion, Quinn has stated that he is opposed to allowing women to have them. In 1994, Democrat Ellen T. Kennedy criticized Quinn for voting against a bill that would make it a crime to block abortion clinic access. Kennedy noted that Quinn&#x27;s 1993 approval rating from a group that supports abortion rights, the National Abortion Reproductive Rights Action League, was 5%.

Particular stances regarding certain issues that Quinn holds include being against both gay marriage and the legalization of marijuana. He is a proponent of Alaska/offshore oil drilling, Bush tax cuts, capital punishment, labor, life, and social security privatization. Quinn also supported campaign finance reform.

In 1998 at Canisius College in Buffalo, Quinn hosted fellow Congress Member John Lewis, a Democrat and African-American from Georgia who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in the civil rights movement. The talk in which the two congressional leaders participated was regarding race relations and how they can be improved. The event was attending largely by African-Americans, and was suggested to be an attempt at increasing bloc voter support for Quinn among the Black community in Buffalo.

It has been suggested that Quinn would have been better to be a Democrat in Buffalo, though as a Republican, he appeared to garner more Republican support in Congress than a Democrat would have. In reality, Quinn has been asked if he would become Democrat, and has not directly answered that question. At that time he was asked in 1996, he stated that there were more important issues at hand, such as balancing the budget, than to which political party one was affiliated.

===Support of selected, specific issues===

Quinn was a supporter of Amtrak, working to maintain its prominence in the country&#x27;s infrastructure, and improve the safety of passengers. Quinn has described himself as an “unabashed Amtrak supporter.”

Quinn worked to achieve the passage of the Railroad Retirement Survivors Act that became law in 2001.

Quinn was a proponent for rejuvenating both Buffalo&#x27;s waterfront and inner harbor, as well as the Erie Canal Corridor.

Interested in maintaining the strength of teaching hospitals in New York State, Quinn introduced bipartisan legislation known as The Quinn–Lowey Hospital Emergency Assistance Act (H.R. 2266), co-sponsored by Congress Member Nita Lowey, that aimed to preserve Medicare payments to hospitals. The budget crisis of 1997 contributed to the reduction of funding to hospitals, and the bill aimed to maintain government funding payments to hospitals at their prior levels.

===Honors===
Quinn received numerous awards during his work in Congress. Quinn received the AMVETS Silver Helmet Award for working on behalf of veterans; and the Legislative Leadership Award from the National Coalition of Homeless Veterans.

Quinn also received the Government Service Award from the Buffalo American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO) Council for his support of working women and men; and the Spirit of Enterprise Award from the United States Chamber of Commerce.

From the National Association of Railroad Passengers, Quinn received the Golden Spike Award. In recognition of Quinn&#x27;s support for railway safety, he was given Operation Lifesaver &#x27;s Congressional Appreciation Award.

From his alma mater, Siena College, Quinn received the Joseph A. Buff Distinguished Alumni Award for Career Achievement, and the Bernadine of Siena Medal for service.

Quinn was also named one of the Top 50 &quot;Most Effective&quot; Lawmakers in Washington by &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot;.

Further awards that Quinn has won include the Public Service Award from Niagara Frontier Parks and Recreation Society; the Good Citizen Medal of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution; the Humanitarian Award from the Erie County Office for the Disabled; and the Distinguished Graduate Award from the National Catholic Elementary Schools Association.

Quinn was honored with the Friend of the Farm Bureau Award. Quinn received this national recognition award for having demonstrated an active and strong record that is consistent with the American farmer&#x27;s needs.

===Reflections of others===
Congressional colleagues saluted Quinn on his work upon his retirement. Congress Members Sue Kelly, Thomas M. Reynolds, and Edolphus Towns made statements in Congress, honoring him for his accomplishments.



==Post-congressional career==

After leaving Congress, Quinn joined the Washington, D.C. lobbying firm, Cassidy &amp; Associates as President.

===As President of Erie Community College===

Quinn was appointed President of Erie Community College in 2008. There were 59 candidates who were nationally-considered for the post; and the consensus by the ECC Board of Trustees was to appoint Quinn.

As the top leader of ECC, Quinn has presided over rising enrollments at the College during a time of decreasing or flat budgetary support from Erie County and the State of New York. ECC obtains approximately 19% of its financial support from Erie County. Quinn understands the need for proper funding for ECC.

Quinn also has the advantage of having lived &quot;the ECC experience&quot; – as he termed it – within his own family. Quinn&#x27;s wife, Mary Beth, attended ECC, taking courses for her nursing degree in their earlier years when the couple was also raising their family.

==Community involvement==
In 2008, Quinn was the dinner chair of the American Ireland Fund gala. The American Ireland Fund raises monies to support community development, peace, reconciliation, arts, culture, and education in Ireland.

Quinn has also been either a member or chair of many civic organizations. He has chaired the Hamburg Industrial Development Agency. Additionally, he is or has been a member of the BryhLin Foundation; the Greater Buffalo Chapter of the American Red Cross; Hamburg Kiwanis Club; the Knights of Columbus; and the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce. He has also been a member of the United Way of Western New York; the Greater Buffalo Chamber of Commerce; and the Southtowns Sewage Treatment Agency. Further, he served on the boards of St. Francis High School in Athol Springs, New York; and the New York State Advisory Council of the American Red Cross.

==2020 Presidential Election==
On August 24, 2020, Quinn was one of 24 former Republican lawmakers to endorse Democratic nominee Joe Biden on the opening day of the Republican National Convention.

==Family and personal life==
Quinn is married to his wife, Mary Beth, and has two adult children, Jack III and Kara Elizabeth. Quinn&#x27;s son, Jack Quinn III, is a former member of the New York State Assembly, the youngest ever to serve in New York State.

<text>Amory Houghton Jr. (August 7, 1926 – March 4, 2020) was an American Republican politician from the U.S. state of New York. He served as a member of the United States House of Representatives and was a member of one of upstate New York&#x27;s most prominent business and political families, the Houghtons.

==Early life==
The son of Amory Houghton and Laura DeKay Richardson, and the grandson of Alanson B. Houghton, Amory Houghton Jr. was born in Corning, New York. He attended St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire and was a member of the class of 1945. Houghton later served as a member of the school&#x27;s board of trustees.

==Military service==
In 1944, Houghton enlisted in the United States Marine Corps for World War II. Assigned to USS &quot;Macon&quot; (CA-132) and Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, he took part with his unit in activities associated with the Battle of the Caribbean. Houghton attained the rank of private first class, and was discharged in 1946.

==Business career==
He graduated from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1950 and received his Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard in 1952.

Houghton spent his business career with his family&#x27;s company, Corning Glass Works (now Corning Incorporated), a company founded in 1851 by his great-great-grandfather, Amory Houghton (1812-1882). He joined the company in 1951, and worked as an accountant, process engineer, manufacturing foreman, and sales manager. He joined the board of directors in 1955, became a vice president in 1957, and was appointed president in 1961. From 1964 to 1983, Houghton served as Corning&#x27;s chairman and chief executive officer.

In addition to Corning Glass, his other business interests included membership on the board of directors of IBM, First National City Bank (later Citigroup), Procter &amp; Gamble, Genentech, and B. F. Goodrich.

==U.S. Congress==
In 1986, Houghton was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Republican. Houghton reportedly was among the richest members of the House, with a wealth of $475 million.

===Voting record===
Houghton had a moderate voting record and was founder of the Republican Main Street Partnership, which he formed to encourage a more moderate stance to public issues. He was frequently called upon to serve as a broker between Democratic and Republican members on critical issues since he was a champion for improving civility between political parties. While he voted with Republicans on most issues relating to the budget, he also voted with the Democratic Party on issues of environmental protection, civil rights and funding for the arts and education.

===Committee memberships===
He served on the International Relations and Ways and Means Committees.

===Issues===

He was one of four Republicans to vote against all the impeachment articles against President Clinton in 1998.

In 2001, Houghton was one of only three Republicans to vote against permanently repealing the estate tax.
On October 10, 2002, he was among the six House Republicans who voted against the resolution authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

Houghton was one of only three Republicans to vote against an initial version of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, the second of the two major Bush tax cuts. However, he voted for the final version of the bill.

===Reputation===
Throughout his career Houghton was one of Upstate New York&#x27;s most well known and respected members of Congress; he was usually re-elected with more than 65 percent of the vote. He clashed occasionally with the increasingly Southern, socially conservative orientation of the party. For example, Houghton was one of the most vocal pro-choice Republicans in Congress.

===Later life and death===
On April 7, 2004, Houghton announced his intention not to seek a tenth term in Congress. On January 3, 2005, Houghton&#x27;s term expired and he was succeeded by John R. &quot;Randy&quot; Kuhl. He was a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One. In 2016 and 2018, he spoke out against the presidency of Donald Trump and stated that he would support efforts to remove him from office.

Corning Inc. announced on March 5, 2020, that Houghton had died the previous day.

==Personal life==
In 1950, Houghton married Ruth Frances West of Waccabuc, New York. Their children include Amory, Robert, Sarah, and Quincy. After their 1988 divorce, in 1989 Houghton married Priscilla B. Dewey (1924–2012).

Amos was a Christian who attended Christ Episcopal Church in Corning, New York, where he taught Sunday School throughout the 1950s. He also served as a trustee of Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which later merged into Episcopal Divinity School.

<doc id="965800" wikidata="Q971318" url="?curid=965800" title="Joe Crowley">
<text>Joseph Crowley (born March 16, 1962) is a former American politician who served as U.S. Representative from New York&#x27;s 14th congressional district from 1999 to 2019. He was defeated by Democratic primary challenger Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in what was viewed as one of the biggest upsets of the 2018 midterm elections.

During his tenure, Crowley served as Chair of the House Democratic Caucus from 2017 to 2019, as well as the local chairman of the Queens County Democratic Party from 2006 to 2019. He previously served in the New York State Assembly from 1987 to 1998. After leaving Congress, he joined the Washington, D.C. lobbying and law firm Squire Patton Boggs. He left that firm in 2022 and joined the rival law firm Dentons.

==Early life and education==
Crowley was born in Woodside, Queens, New York City, to Joseph F. Crowley Sr., an Irish American, and Eileen Crowley, who emigrated from County Armagh, Northern Ireland. Crowley Sr. served in the United States Army during the Korean War, later becoming a lawyer and a New York City Police Department detective. Crowley Jr. is the second of four siblings. Crowley Jr.&#x27;s paternal uncle Walter H. Crowley was a New York City councilman, and is the namesake of Crowley Playground in Elmhurst, Queens.

Crowley attended private Roman Catholic schools in the city, graduating from Power Memorial Academy in Manhattan in 1981. He graduated from Queens College in 1985 with a degree in political science and communications. Crowley was inducted into the Power Memorial Academy Hall of Fame in 2011.

== Career ==

===New York Assembly===
He was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1987 to 1998, sitting in the 187th, 188th, 189th, 190th, 191st and 192nd New York State Legislatures. Because of his Irish roots, he quickly became involved in Irish-American politics throughout New York.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
Democratic Congressman Thomas J. Manton announced his retirement from Congress in 1998, having already filed for and circulated petitions for reelection. He withdrew on the last day it was legally possible to do so and arranged for Crowley, his chosen successor, to replace him on the ballot. Crowley was not aware of this until Manton phoned him to tell him his name would be on the general election ballot.

Prior to redistricting for the 2012 election, Crowley represented the 7th District, which encompassed portions of Queens and the Bronx. It included neighborhoods such as Woodside, Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst, and College Point, in Queens as well as the neighborhoods of Castle Hill, Co-op City, Parkchester, Throgs Neck, Morris Park, Pelham Parkway, Pelham Bay, Country Club, and City Island in the eastern Bronx.

After 2013, Crowley represented New York&#x27;s 14th congressional district, which includes the eastern Bronx and part of north-central Queens. The Queens portion includes the neighborhoods of Sunnyside, Astoria, College Point, East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, Corona and Woodside. The Bronx portion of the district includes the neighborhoods of Morris Park, Parkchester, Pelham Bay, and Throgs Neck as well as City Island.

On June 26, 2018, Crowley was defeated in the Democratic primary by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

=== Tenure ===
Crowley served as Democratic Caucus Chairman of the United States House of Representatives, the fourth highest leadership position in the House Democratic Caucus.

Crowley&#x27;s cousin, New York City firefighter John Michael Moran, was killed as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Crowley authored a bill that provided the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor to all emergency workers who died as a result of the terrorist acts. He also created the Urban Area Security Initiative, which directs money to prevent terrorism toward regions that are seen as the most threatened.

Crowley, who has spent much time in India, created a Bangladesh caucus and was formerly the chair of the India Caucus.
On October 10, 2002, Crowley was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

Crowley joined Bronx Representative José E. Serrano in 2008 in proposing legislation to help clean up PCB-contaminated schools.

In April 2011, Crowley received media attention for an angry &quot;speech&quot; he gave without actually speaking. Crowley ripped pieces of paper with words to deliver his message.

Crowley was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1998. The seat was considered open after incumbent Thomas J. Manton retired.

In 2017, Crowley was the commencement speaker at and received an honorary degree from Touro Law Center.

In the June 26, 2018, Democratic primary for New York&#x27;s 14th congressional district, Crowley was defeated by challenger Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who received 57% of the vote, in what was seen as a massive upset. Crowley remained on the general election ballot under the Working Families Party line. Ocasio-Cortez called on Crowley to take his name off the ballot, but he responded that he could not unless he moved, died, was convicted of a felony, or filed to run for another office in November as a paper candidate (which he claimed would be a form of electoral fraud). Ocasio-Cortez defeated Crowley and Republican Anthony Pappas in the November 6 general election, with Crowley receiving 7% of the vote.

In February 2019, Crowley resigned as Chair of the Queens Democratic Party and signed on to the lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs. June Bunch was selected to serve as Chair on an interim basis. Crowley also became honorary co-chair of the Pass USMCA Coalition, an umbrella organization working to pass USMCA, the Trump administration&#x27;s replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement.

In May 2019, Crowley joined the board of Northern Swan Holdings Inc., an investment firm focused on hemp and marijuana cultivation in Colombia, along with former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle.

==Political positions==

=== Abortion ===
Since 2005, Crowley consistently received ratings of 0% from the National Right to Life Committee and 100% from the NARAL. In 2011, he opposed a bill that would have banned taxpayer funding for abortions, and in the 2010 election, he was endorsed by Planned Parenthood. In 2018, Crowley received a voting record of 100% from Planned Parenthood.

=== Health care ===
Since 2007, he received a rating of 100% from the American Public Health Association, the American Nurses Association, and the National Breast Cancer Coalition.

Crowley fought against the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM), both abroad and in the United States. In 2010, he introduced the Girls Protection Act of 2010, which would criminalize the transport of a girl under the age of 18 years old to undergo FGM.

In 2015, he proposed a bill with Representative Sheila Jackson Lee encouraging the collection of data on the prevalence of FGM, and to create a plan to better prevent the practice, which is illegal in the United States.

Crowley was a consistent supporter of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (known as &quot;Obamacare&quot;, or &quot;ACA&quot;). On March 22, 2010, he said: &quot;I... support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a historic measure that will put families first when it comes to accessing health care coverage.&quot; He opposed repealing the act, and voted against a repeal on January 19, 2011. Also in 2011, he held an event to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the bill&#x27;s passage.

In 2017, Crowley signed on to H.R. 676, the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act. This bill was introduced by former Michigan Congressman John Conyers in January 2017.

=== Immigration ===
Crowley has been a heavy critic of President Trump&#x27;s plan to build a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border and his decision to end DACA and Temporary Protected Status protection for qualifying immigrants in 2017. In 2017, Crowley introduced a bill that would grant green cards to undocumented workers who helped to recover and clean up New York City after the terrorist attacks on September 11.

=== Economy and budget ===

Crowley holds the view &quot;that reducing barriers to investment, creating opportunities for small businesses, and providing equitable working conditions for all Americans can and should be part of our national economic policy&quot;. He supported federal spending as a way to increase economic growth. In 2008, he endorsed the Financial Asset Purchase Authority and Tax Law Amendments, which established the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) and allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to buy assets from troubled financial institutions.

Crowley advocated tax increases on the highest tax brackets, tax cuts for the middle class, and reduced defense spending. When serving on the Ways and Means Committee, he stated: &quot;I really don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s justifiable or sensible to give a tax cut to the wealthiest among us, but at the same time increase taxes on U.S. soldiers.&quot; He also applauded the 2009 Budget for ending the Alternative Minimum Tax, and ensuring tax cuts for 23 million middle-class Americans. In 2011, he opposed a bill that appropriated funds to the defense budget.

In 2017, Crowley opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying its only goal was to give more tax cuts to America&#x27;s top 1% than the working class. In December 2017, Crowley said in a floor speech: &quot;It&#x27;s a scam, and the American people know it. Is this a bill that helps people who are living paycheck to paycheck? Hell, no.&quot;

=== Other positions ===

Crowley proposed legislation to improve conditions for renters in his district. In September 2017, he introduced the Rent Relief Act, which would give refundable tax credits to renters.

Crowley had a 2016 score of 95% from the League of Conservation Voters.

Crowley&#x27;s Irish roots influenced his policy decisions in Congress as a member of the Friends of Ireland Caucus. He worked on peace efforts for the conflict in Northern Ireland and securing refuge for those affected by it. Crowley spoke out against President Trump&#x27;s effort to eliminate the position of United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Trump eventually reversed this decision.

<doc id="965802" wikidata="Q2309105" url="?curid=965802" title="Boss of Me">
<text>&quot;Boss of Me&quot; is a song by alternative rock band They Might Be Giants. The song is famously used as the opening theme song for the television show &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, and was released as the single from the soundtrack to the show. In 2002, &quot;Boss of Me&quot; won the band their first Grammy Award, in the category of Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. The song was one of the band&#x27;s most commercially successful singles and is one of their best-known songs. The song was originally written with the chorus &quot;Who&#x27;s gonna guess the dead guy in the envelope&quot; for a contest presented by the Preston and Steve show during their Y-100 days.

==Release==
&quot;Boss of Me&quot; was released commercially in the United Kingdom, Australia and mainland Europe. Mainland Europe was given a separate release from the British release, which had different cover artwork and a different track listing. The single was marketed as the single from the soundtrack album, &quot;Music from Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, but the B-sides to all releases were tracks from They Might Be Giants albums, as opposed to being other tracks from the soundtrack album. &quot;Reprehensible&quot; comes from the band&#x27;s 1999 internet-only album, &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot;. &quot;Mr. Xcitement&quot; went on to be included on their album &quot;Mink Car&quot;, released two months after the single. &quot;Boss of Me&quot; charted in three countries, reaching number 21 in the UK, number 89 in the Netherlands, and saw the band&#x27;s first appearance on the Australian Singles Chart, reaching number 29. It also reached the Top 50 on two US radio airplay charts, Alternative (number 48) and Pop (number 50).

== Music video ==

The &quot;Boss of Me&quot; music video was directed by Ted Crittenden. It is based on &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, and contains the characters and set from the show. It begins with Dewey going through a dumpster that says &quot;TMBG Toys&quot;. He climbs out of the dumpster and rides his bike home while dragging the box full of toys. The band is performing inside the box. The box goes into Dewey&#x27;s backyard where Malcolm is raking leaves, their father, Hal, is cooking on a barbecue, and Reese is using hedge clippers on a tree. Dewey opens the box, revealing toy versions of TMBG. But whenever there&#x27;s a close-up in the box, it is the real band in miniature. A Hawaiian hula dancer toy joins TMBG as Dewey sways back and forth with her. Malcolm and Reese begin shooting the toys with paintball guns until one of them accidentally shoots Hal. Though not shown, it&#x27;s presumed to have been Reese who shot him as he is later seen using a weed whacker. The John Flansburgh toy is lying in the grass with his arm detached. Reese spots him and, while using the weed whacker, launches him onto the grill where Hal accidentally eats him, much to Dewey&#x27;s shock. Later, the John Linnell toy is placed in a model airplane that is launched across the street before curving back and landing on the driveway. As Hal drives up, he picks up the airplane to examine it. The plane explodes because it still had a lit fuse. Hal then angrily gathers the TMBG toys into the box and drives back to the dumpster where he promptly tosses it back in.

==Cover versions==
The ska-punk band Less Than Jake covered the short televised version of the song for their album &quot;TV/EP&quot;.

<doc id="965808" wikidata="Q2348190" url="?curid=965808" title="Pollyanna">
<text>Pollyanna is a 1913 novel by American author Eleanor H. Porter, considered a classic of children&#x27;s literature. The book&#x27;s success led to Porter soon writing a sequel, Pollyanna Grows Up (1915). Eleven more &quot;Pollyanna&quot; sequels, known as &quot;Glad Books&quot;, were later published, most of them written by Elizabeth Borton or Harriet Lummis Smith. Further sequels followed, including &quot;Pollyanna Plays the Game&quot; by Colleen L. Reece, published in 1997. Due to the book&#x27;s fame, &quot;Pollyanna&quot; has become a byword for someone who, like the title character, has an unfailingly optimistic outlook; a subconscious bias towards the positive is often described as the Pollyanna principle. Despite the current common use of the term to mean &quot;excessively cheerful&quot;, Pollyanna and her father played the glad game as a method of coping with the real difficulties and sorrows that, along with luck and joy, shape every life.

&quot;Pollyanna&quot; has been adapted for film several times. Some of the best known are the 1920 version starring Mary Pickford, and Disney&#x27;s 1960 version starring child actress Hayley Mills, who won a special Oscar for the role.

==Plot==
The title character is Pollyanna Whittier, an eleven-year-old orphan who goes to live in the fictional town of Beldingsville, Vermont, with her wealthy but stern and cold spinster Aunt Polly Harrington, who does not want to take in Pollyanna but feels it is her duty to her late sister Jennifer. Pollyanna&#x27;s philosophy of life centers on what she calls &quot;The Glad Game&quot;, an optimistic and positive attitude she learned from her father. The game consists of finding something to be glad about in every situation, no matter how bleak it may be. It originated in an incident one Christmas when Pollyanna, who was hoping for a doll in the missionary barrel, found only a pair of crutches inside. Making the game up on the spot, Pollyanna&#x27;s father taught her to look at the good side of things—in this case, to be glad about the crutches because she did not need to use them.

With this philosophy, and her own sunny personality and sincere, sympathetic soul, Pollyanna brings so much gladness to her aunt&#x27;s dispirited New England town that she transforms it into a pleasant place to live. The Glad Game shields her from her aunt&#x27;s stern attitude: when Aunt Polly puts her in a stuffy attic room without carpets or pictures, she exults at the beautiful view from the high window; when she tries to &quot;punish&quot; her niece for being late to dinner by sentencing her to a meal of bread and milk in the kitchen with the servant Nancy, Pollyanna thanks her rapturously because she likes bread and milk, and she likes Nancy.

Soon Pollyanna teaches some of Beldingsville&#x27;s most troubled inhabitants to &quot;play the game&quot; as well, from Mrs. Snow, a querulous invalid, to Mr. Pendleton, a miserly bachelor who lives all alone in a cluttered mansion. Aunt Polly, too—finding herself helpless before Pollyanna&#x27;s buoyant refusal to be downcast—gradually begins to thaw, although she resists the Glad Game longer than anyone else.

Eventually, however, even Pollyanna&#x27;s robust optimism is put to the test when she is struck by a car and loses the use of her legs. At first, she does not realize the seriousness of her situation, but her spirits plummet when she is told what happened to her. After that, she lies in bed, unable to find anything to be glad about. Then the townspeople begin calling at Aunt Polly&#x27;s house, eager to let Pollyanna know how much her encouragement has improved their lives; and Pollyanna decides she can still be glad that she at least had her legs. The novel ends with Aunt Polly marrying her former lover Dr. Chilton and Pollyanna being sent to a hospital, where she learns to walk again and is able to appreciate the use of her legs far more as a result of being temporarily disabled and unable to walk well.

==Characters==
Pollyanna Whittier - The title character, who moves from the West to New England.

Timothy Durgan - his son.

Mr. John Pendleton - an angry, unsociable old miser, and former suitor of Pollyanna&#x27;s mother.

Revd. Paul Ford - the town clergyman.

==Influence==
As a result of the novel&#x27;s success, the adjective &quot;Pollyannaish&quot; and the noun &quot;Pollyannaism&quot; became popular terms for a personality type characterised by irrepressible optimism evident in the face of even the most adverse or discouraging of circumstances. It is sometimes used pejoratively, referring to someone whose optimism is excessive to the point of naïveté or refusing to accept the facts of an unfortunate situation. This pejorative use can be heard in the introduction of the 1930 George and Ira Gershwin song &quot;But Not For Me&quot;: &quot;I never want to hear from any cheerful pollyannas/who tell me fate supplies a mate/that&#x27;s all bananas&quot; (performed by Judy Garland in the 1943 movie &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;).

The word &quot;pollyanna&quot; may also be used colloquially to denote a holiday gift exchange more typically known as Secret Santa, especially in Philadelphia and the surrounding areas.

At the height of her popularity, Pollyanna was known as &quot;The Glad Girl&quot;, and Parker Brothers even created &quot;The Glad Game&quot;, a board game. &quot;The Glad Game&quot;, a type of Parcheesi, was made and sold from 1915 to 1967 in various versions, similar to the popular UK board game &quot;Ludo&quot;. The board game was later licensed by Parker Brothers but has been discontinued for many years. A Broadway adaptation was mounted in 1916 titled &quot;Pollyanna Whittier, The Glad Girl&quot;. Helen Hayes was the star.

Author Jerome (Jerry) Griswold analysed Pollyanna together with juvenile &#x27;heroes&#x27; in several well-known children&#x27;s books, e.g., &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot; (both also portrayed by Pickford on film) and &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; from the era known as the Golden Age of Children&#x27;s Books (approximately the American Civil War to World War I). With reference to the &quot;Theory of the Three Lives of the Child Hero&quot;, he posits that, in &quot;Pollyanna&quot;, clear oedipal tensions exist, albeit in disguised or projected forms, in the relationships between the child, her Aunt and the principal male adult characters, which are only resolved by the Aunt marrying Dr. Chilton at the end of the story. He calls &quot;Pollyanna&quot; &#x27;a complex novel replete with disguises&#x27; and sees Pollyanna, not as a naïve child but, rather, as a gifted individual with the ability to direct her extreme optimism and good-naturedness (for the good) towards the manipulating of the negative, worldly, cynical or disillusioned emotions of the adults that inhabit her life.

&quot;Glad Clubs&quot; appear to have been popular for a while; however, it is questionable if they were ever more than a publicity gimmick. Glad Clubs may have been simply a means to popularize &quot;The Glad Game&quot; as a method for coping with the vicissitudes of life such as loss, disappointment, and distress. Nevertheless, at least one &quot;glad club&quot; existed as recently as 2008, in Denver, Colorado.

In 2002 the citizens of Littleton, New Hampshire unveiled a bronze statue in honor of Eleanor H. Porter, author of the Pollyanna books and one of the town&#x27;s most famous residents. The statue depicts a smiling Pollyanna, arms flung wide in greeting. Littleton also hosts a festival known as &quot;The Official Pollyanna Glad Day&quot; every summer.

The celebrated American science fiction writer Ray Bradbury described himself as &quot;Janus, the two-faced god who is half Pollyanna and half Cassandra, warning of the future and perhaps living too much in the past—a combination of both&quot;.

In a 1973 State of the Union message to Congress Richard M. Nixon wrote, &quot;I believe there is always a sensible middle ground between the Cassandras and the Pollyannas. We must take our stand upon that ground.&quot;

The video game series &quot;Mother&quot; (marketed in the U.S. as &quot;EarthBound&quot;) has consistently featured variations of a certain song, which in its first incarnation was called &quot;Pollyanna&quot;. The title is a reference to the novel, and a lyrical version released on the game&#x27;s official arranged soundtrack CD is told from the perspective of a woman who would gladly be &quot;called Pollyanna&quot;, or otherwise be considered foolish in her unyielding optimism.

==Adaptations==

===1915 play===

In 1915, Catherine Chisholm Cushing published &quot;Pollyanna: The Glad Girl&quot;, a four-act comedy which was produced with great success in Philadelphia starring Patricia Collinge as Pollyanna. A critic at the time wrote that: &quot;Mrs. Cushing has slashed and sliced and revised and twisted the story of Pollyanna and her infectious gladness until it has become swift-moving, intensely dramatic and very real.&quot; In 1918 and 1919 the play toured the U.S. and Canada with 19-year-old Viola Harper (née Harpman) in the title role.

===1920 film===

The 1920 American silent melodrama/comedy film &quot;Pollyanna&quot; starred Mary Pickford and was directed by Paul Powell. It was Pickford&#x27;s first motion picture for United Artists. It became a major success and would be regarded as one of Pickford&#x27;s most defining pictures. The film grossed $1.1 million (approximately $ today).

===1960 film===

A Walt Disney film, &quot;Pollyanna&quot;, was released in 1960, starring English actress Hayley Mills in the title role (which made her a Hollywood star and led to a Disney contract). It was directed by David Swift. The film was a major hit for the Disney Studios. It also marked the last film appearance of Hollywood actor Adolphe Menjou, who played the reclusive Mr. Pendergast.

===1971 film===
The Turkish musical drama comedy film &quot;Hayat Sevince Güzel&quot; (literally: &quot;Loving makes life beautiful&quot;), is loosely based on &quot;Pollyanna&quot;. The film stars Turkish actress Zeynep Degirmencioglu.

===1973 serial===
The BBC produced a six-part TV serial in 1973 starring Colyton Grammar School pupil Elizabeth Archard as Pollyanna and Elaine Stritch as Aunt Polly. This ran in the Sunday tea-time slot, which often featured reasonably faithful adaptations of classic novels aimed at a family audience, although in this instance it followed the Disney film (and not the original novel) by having Pollyanna injured in a fall from a tree.

===1982 TV movie===
&quot;The Adventures of Pollyanna&quot; aired on The Magical World of Disney, starring Patsy Kensit as Pollyanna and Shirley Jones as Aunt Polly.

===1986 TV series===
Nippon Animation of Japan released &quot;Ai Shoujo Pollyanna Monogatari&quot; (&quot;The Story of Pollyanna, Girl of Love&quot;), a fifty-one episode anime television series that made up the 1986 installment of the studio&#x27;s &quot;World Masterpiece Theater&quot;, and had famous singer Mitsuko Horie playing the role of Pollyanna.

===1989 film===
&quot;Polly&quot; is a 1989 American made-for-television musical film featuring an African-American cast. It was directed and choreographed by Debbie Allen, starring Keshia Knight Pulliam, Phylicia Rashad and featured the final performance of Butterfly McQueen. &quot;Polly&quot; was originally broadcast on NBC on November 12, 1989. It also had a sequel, Polly: Coming Home in 1990.

===2003 film===
A 2003 Carlton Television TV film version of &quot;Pollyanna&quot; starring Amanda Burton as Aunt Polly and Georgina Terry uses the original characterizations and storylines, but takes place in an English village rather than Vermont (only the scenery and accents show this—the town is still called Beldingsville). Like the book, it ends with Aunt Polly and Dr. Chilton married and Pollyanna walking, but the scene is the actual wedding with Pollyanna back for a visit rather than a letter as in the book.

===2018 telenovela===

A 2018 Brazilian telenovela version of &quot;Pollyanna&quot; called &quot;As Aventuras de Poliana&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of Poliana&quot;) premiered on SBT on May 16. The telenovela stars Sophia Valverde as Poliana. It is directed by Reynaldo Boury.

<text>Siu Hong () is an MTR station located beside Siu Hong Court, Tuen Mun, New Territories, Hong Kong. It is built on the Tuen Mun Nullah immediately east of Siu Hong Court. The station is on the between and stations. 

Elevated public transport interchanges are provided at both the south and north ends of the station. Two access ramps link the public transport interchanges to Castle Peak Road and Tsing Lun Road for access to feeder services such as buses, minibuses, and taxis.

==History==
Construction started in July 1999 with the award of civil contract CC-212 for the West Rail line station to HK ACE JV at a contract sum of HK$1,386 million. The topping-out was marked on 26 February 2002 by KCR chairman Michael Tien and transport legislator Miriam Lau. It was opened to the public on 20 December 2003 with the commencement of West Rail service.

The elevated station is located above the Tuen Mun Nullah. To support the station, 352 columns were built in the river bed, impacting the water flow. As a result, the river was widened by about 17 metres along the length of the station to maintain its drainage capacity.

On 27 June 2021, the officially merged with the (which was already extended into the &quot;Tuen Ma line Phase 1&quot; at the time) in East Kowloon to form the new , as part of the Sha Tin to Central Link project. Hence, Siu Hong was included in the project and is now an intermediate station on the Tuen Ma line.

==Station layout==

Platforms 1 and 2 share the same island platform.

The first train to Tuen Mun departs at 6:26 a.m., while the last train departs at 12:40 a.m. the day after. The first train to Hung Hom departs at 5:47 a.m., while the last train departs at 12:17 a.m. the day after.

<text>Raymond Eugene Green (born October 17, 1947) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for , serving for 13 terms. He is a member of the Democratic Party. His district included most of eastern Houston, including portions of the suburbs.

In November 2017, Green announced that he would retire from Congress at the end of his current term, and not run for re-election in 2018.

==Early life, education, and early career==

Green was born in Houston and he graduated from the University of Houston, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration in 1971 and a Juris Doctor degree in 1977. He held positions as a business manager and a private attorney prior to his election to Congress.

==Texas legislature==
Green was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1972. He was elected to the Texas Senate in 1985.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
Green was first elected to the U.S. House in 1992. Although the 29th was (then as now) drawn as a majority-Hispanic district, Green finished second in the five-way Democratic primary, behind city councilman Ben Reyes. Green defeated Reyes in the runoff by only 180 votes, all but assuring him of election in this heavily Democratic district. Green was reelected 12 times, never facing substantive electoral opposition. He ran unopposed in 1998, 2002 and 2004.

On November 13, 2017, Green announced his retirement. He later endorsed State Senator Sylvia Garcia, who now represented his old state senate district (and who finished third in the 1992 Democratic primary) as his successor. Garcia went on to win the primary, and easily won the general election.

Green left office in January 2019 after representing portions of eastern Houston for 46 years, having never lost an election.

===Tenure===
In the 115th Congress, Green was the only non-Hispanic white Democrat representing a significant portion of Houston, and one of only three in the entire Texas delegation (the others being Lloyd Doggett and Beto O&#x27;Rourke).

From 1996 until his retirement in 2019, Green was a member of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. In 2011, he became Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy. He also served on the Subcommittee on Energy and Power and the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

===Legislative issues===
Since being elected to the House of Representatives, Green had been working on education, labor, energy, domestic manufacturing, health issues, NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center, and Social Security and veterans benefits. He has worked to improve access to quality health care, support initiatives to improve our economy and increased job training, and maintain financial aid for students.

Green voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution in 2002, and gave a speech on the house floor linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks in 2001. Despite the Democratic leadership&#x27;s general disapproval of the war, Green voted against measures aimed at placing a timetable on military withdrawal.

In September 2004, he proposed the Every Vote Counts Amendment, which would have abolished the U.S. electoral college in United States presidential elections.

Green proposed legislation addressing domestic and global electronic waste (e-waste) concerns. H.R. 2284, The Responsible Electronics Recycling Act of 2011, was introduced in the 112th Congress to prohibit the exportation of some electronics whose improper disposal may create environmental, health, or national security risks.

Green also served on the Energy and Commerce Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Health during drafting of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 and helped write and amend the legislation. Afterward, he worked for increased access to affordable and quality health care.

<doc id="965817" wikidata="Q13420328" url="?curid=965817" title="Center tap">
<text>In electronics, a center tap (CT) is a contact made to a point halfway along a winding of a transformer or inductor, or along the element of a resistor or a potentiometer.

Taps are sometimes used on inductors for the coupling of signals, and may not necessarily be at the half-way point, but rather, closer to one end. A common application of this is in the Hartley oscillator. Inductors with taps also permit the transformation of the amplitude of alternating current (AC) voltages for the purpose of power conversion, in which case, they are referred to as autotransformers, since there is only one winding. An example of an autotransformer is an automobile ignition coil.

Potentiometer tapping provides one or more connections along the device&#x27;s element, along with the usual connections at each of the two ends of the element, and the slider connection. Potentiometer taps allow for circuit functions that would otherwise not be available with the usual construction of just the two end connections and one slider connection.

==Volts center tapped==
Volts center tapped (VCT) describes the voltage output of a center tapped transformer. For example, a 24 VCT transformer will measure 24 VAC across the outer two taps (winding as a whole), and 12 VAC from each outer tap to the center-tap (half winding). These two 12 VAC supplies are 180 degrees out of phase with each other, measured with respect to the tap, thus making it easy to derive positive and negative 12 volt DC power supplies from them.

==Applications and history==
*In vacuum tube audio amplifiers, center-tapped transformers were sometimes used as the phase inverter to drive the two output tubes of a push-pull stage. The technique is nearly as old as electronic amplification and is well documented, for example, in &quot;The Radiotron Designer&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, Third Edition of 1940. This technique was carried over into transistor designs also, part of the reason for which was that capacitors were large, expensive and unreliable. However, since that era, capacitors have become vastly smaller, cheaper and more reliable, whereas transformers are still relatively expensive. Furthermore, as designers acquired more experience with transistors, they stopped trying to treat them like tubes. Coupling a class A intermediate amplification stage to a class AB power stage using a transformer doesn&#x27;t make sense anymore even in small systems powered from a single-voltage supply. Modern higher-end equipment is based on dual-supply designs which eliminates coupling. It is possible for an amplifier, from the input all the way to the loudspeaker, to be DC coupled without any capacitance or inductance. Nevertheless, this use is still relevant in the 21st century because tubes and tube amplifiers continue to be produced for niche markets.
*In analog telecommunications systems center-tapped transformers can be used to provide a DC path around an AC coupled amplifier for signalling purposes.
*Three wire power distribution can be used, e. g. with 240 VCT to provide two 120 VAC circuits in US/Canada.
*Low-frequency mains transformers often have center taps. Historically, rectifier costs were high, so DC power supplies with a center-tapped transformer and two diodes justified extra cost of copper windings and iron laminations, using only half of the secondary coil per half-cycle. Consumer products like cassette recorders often used 18 VCT transformers to obtain 9 VDC until the 1980s. With four diodes, both halves can be used, which leads to efficient designs for symmetrical voltages with the center tap as common ground. E. g. in arcade machines like Atari Asteroids (1979), a 36 VCT transformer is used in four-diode configuration to produce +/- 15 VDC (after regulation), while the same power supply provides 10.3 VDC unregulated from a two-diode configuration. In the late 1970s, it became a better business case and simpler assembly to use bridge rectifiers.
*In switch-mode power supplies, center-tapped transformers are often used, sometimes with single diodes or a dual diode half-bridge to optimize their dynamic electromagnetic behavior at the expense of the extra windings. 
*Phantom power can be supplied to a condenser microphone using center tap transformers. One method, called &quot;direct center tap&quot; uses two center tap transformers, one at the microphone body and one at the microphone preamp. Filtered DC voltage is connected to the microphone preamp center tap, and the microphone body center tap is grounded through the cable shield. The second method uses the same center tap transformer topology at the microphone body, but at the microphone preamp, a matched pair of resistors spanning the signal lines in series creates an &quot;artificial center tap&quot;.

<text>Regulae ad directionem ingenii, or Rules for the Direction of the Mind is an unfinished treatise regarding the proper method for scientific and philosophical thinking by René Descartes. Descartes started writing the work in 1628, and it was eventually published in 1701 after Descartes&#x27; death. This treatise outlined the basis for his later work on complex problems of mathematics, geometry, science, and philosophy. The work is estimated to have been written over approximately 10 years, and as such Descartes shifted in his utilization and definition of these rules. &quot;Rules for the Direction of the Mind&quot; is described as a precursor and &#x27;scrapbook&#x27; for his other workings and methods. 

36 rules were planned in total. Rules 1-12 deal with the definition of science, the principal operations of the scientific method (intuition, deduction, and enumeration), and what Descartes terms &quot;simple propositions&quot;, which &quot;occur to us spontaneously&quot; and which are objects of certain and evident cognition or intuition. Rules 13–24 deal with what Descartes terms &quot;perfectly understood problems&quot;, or problems in which all of the conditions relevant to the solution of the problem are known, and which arise principally in arithmetic and geometry. Rules 25–36 deal with &quot;imperfectly understood problems&quot;, or problems in which one or more conditions relevant to the solution of the problem are not known, but must be found. These problems arise for the most part in natural philosophy and metaphysics. However, the work ends prematurely at rule 21.

<text>Lisa Williamson (born 1964), known as Sister Souljah, is an American author, activist, rapper, and film producer.

She gained significant attention in 1992, when Bill Clinton, running as the presumptive Democratic Party nominee for President of the United States, criticized her remarks about race in the United States. The incident was the basis for the phrase &quot;Sister Souljah moment&quot;, referring generally to a politician&#x27;s calculated public repudiation of an extreme person, statement, group, or position associated with the politician&#x27;s own party.

==Early life and education==
Sister Souljah was born in the Bronx, New York. She recounts in her memoir &quot;No Disrespect&quot; that she was born into poverty and raised on welfare for some years. At the age of 10, she moved with her family to the suburb of Englewood, New Jersey, a suburb with a strong African-American presence. Englewood is also home to other famous black artists such as George Benson, Eddie Murphy, and Regina Belle. There she attended Dwight Morrow High School.

Souljah disliked what American students were being taught in school systems across the country. She felt that the school systems intentionally left out the African origins of civilization. In addition, she criticized the absence of a comprehensive curriculum of African-American history, which she felt that all students, black and white, needed to learn and understand in order to be properly educated. She felt that she was being taught very little of her history, since the junior high school and high school left out black history, art, and culture. She commented: &quot;I supplemented my education in the white American school system by reading African history, which was intentionally left out of the curriculum of American students.&quot; From 1978 to 1981 she attended Dwight Morrow High School, which had a relatively even distribution of black, Latino, and Jewish student enrollment and a majority-black administration during the time of her studies. She was a legislative intern in the House of Representatives. Souljah was also the recipient of several honors during her teenage years. She won the American Legion&#x27;s Constitutional Oratory Contest, for which she received a scholarship to attend Cornell University&#x27;s Advanced Summer Program.

In her college years she traveled widely, visiting Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Finland, and Russia. Her education was reinforced with first-hand experiences as she worked in a medical center in Mtepa Tepa, a village located in Zimbabwe, and assisted refugee children from Mozambique. She also traveled to South Africa and Zambia. She graduated from Rutgers University with a dual major in American History and African Studies. She became a well-known and outspoken voice on campus and wrote for the school newspaper. One of her noted campus initiatives was spearheading a campaign to bring Jesse Jackson to Rutgers to speak against the university&#x27;s controversial investments in apartheid South Africa at the time, when disinvestment from South Africa was a heated political issue. Sister Souljah was part of the Rutgers Coalition for Divestment, which successfully prompted the Rutgers University administration to divest US$3.6 million in its financial holding companies doing business in that country. Sister Souljah and students across the state of New Jersey also organized a successful campaign to get the state of New Jersey to divest more than US$1 billion of its financial holdings in apartheid-era South Africa.

In 1985, during her senior year at Rutgers University, she was offered a job by Reverend Benjamin Chavis of the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice. She spent the next three years developing, organizing, and financing programs such as African Survival Camp, a six-week summer sleepaway camp in Enfield, North Carolina. She also became the organizer of the National African Youth-Student Alliance and outspoken voice against racially motivated violence in cases such as the racist murder at Howard Beach, the racially motivated murder of Yusuf Hawkins, and more.

==Career==
===Recording artist===
Souljah appeared on several tracks as a featured guest with the hip-hop group Public Enemy, and she became a full member of the group when Professor Griff was forced to leave after making anti-Semitic remarks. In 1992, she released her only album, &quot;360 Degrees of Power&quot;.

===Statement about riots===
During an interview on the 1992 Los Angeles riots conducted May 13, 1992, she was quoted in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as saying, &quot;If black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?&quot;

The quotation was later reproduced in the media, and she was widely criticized. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton publicly criticized that statement and Jesse Jackson for allowing her to be on his Rainbow Coalition. The incident resulted in the phrase &quot;Sister Souljah moment&quot; being coined to describe a politician&#x27;s public repudiation of extremist views that are perceived to have some association with the politician&#x27;s own faction or party.

===Author===
In 1994, Sister Souljah published a memoir titled &quot;No Disrespect&quot;.

In 1999, she made her debut as a novelist with &quot;The Coldest Winter Ever&quot;. Souljah said that she was the pioneer for starting &quot;a renaissance, or what Chuck D of Public Enemy would call a revolution, of reading.&quot; , Souljah was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller List three times. &quot;The Coldest Winter Ever&quot; was widely acclaimed for making the second wave of the genre known as street literature more popular. About this, Souljah said: A sequel of the novel, &quot;Life After Death,&quot; was published in March 2021.

&quot;&quot;, originally scheduled for October 14, 2008, was published on November 4, 2008. It tells the backstory of Midnight, a character first introduced in &quot;The Coldest Winter Ever&quot;. It entered &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list at No. 7 its first week of publication. The sequel to &quot;Midnight&quot;, , was released on April 12, 2011. A third &quot;Midnight&quot; novel, &quot;A Moment of Silence&quot;, was published on November 10, 2015. , it had sold over 2 million copies. This novel follows the main character, Midnight, as he attempts to reclaim his innocence and his identity while in prison.

Another spinoff, &quot;A Deeper Love Inside: The Porsche Santiaga Story&quot;, originally scheduled for October 23, 2012, was published January 29, 2013.

All of Souljah&#x27;s novels deal with universal themes of faith, love, and integrity. Most of her novels have become popular among the prison population, with her books being available in many prison libraries. Due to this, she has worked in tandem with Black and Nobel, a Web site that ships books, magazines, and DVDs to prisons nationwide. Her work has also been referenced multiple times in popular culture, including on the Netflix series &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;.

She also contributes occasional pieces for &quot;Essence Magazine&quot;, and has written for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

===Community activist===
As a community activist, Souljah organized a number of service programs. In 1985, during her senior year at Rutgers University, she developed and financed the African Youth Survival Camp for children of homeless families, a six-week summer sleep-away camp in Enfield, North Carolina. This program ran for more than three years. She has been a motivating force behind a number of hip-hop artists&#x27; efforts to give back to the community, organizing major youth events, programs and summer camps with musicians such as Lauryn Hill, Doug E. Fresh, and Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs.

Souljah was heavily involved with rallies against racial discrimination, police brutality and the lack of proper education for urban and underrepresented youths. She went on to hold several concerts and protests in New York City, which were supported by many prominent rappers.

Souljah was the executive director of Daddy&#x27;s House Social Programs Inc. for seven years. It is a non-profit corporation for urban youth, financed by Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs and Bad Boy Entertainment. Daddy&#x27;s House educates and prepares people ages ten to sixteen to be in control of their academic, cultural and financial lives. The students progressing through the program earn support to travel throughout the world.

==Personal life==
Sister Souljah is married to Mike Rich. They have a son.

<text>Nam Cheong is a MTR interchange station located at ground level beneath West Kowloon Highway, in Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong opposite the Fu Cheong Estate. It is served by the Tung Chung and Tuen Ma lines and provides cross-platform interchange between platform 1 (Tuen Ma line towards Tuen Mun) and platform 4 (Tung Chung line towards Hong Kong). The livery of Nam Cheong station is pale yellow green. Platform screen doors are fitted in this station. 

Nam Cheong station was originally the western terminus of the West Rail line before the opening of Kowloon Southern Link on 16 August 2009. The passes between the tracks of the Tung Chung line without stopping at this station. A public transport interchange, located to the east of the station, allows for transfers to other modes of public transport. Architecture firm Aedas designed Nam Cheong station.

== History ==
Nam Cheong station was called Yen Chow Street station (after Yen Chow Street, a major thoroughfare in the area) in its planning stage. The station was subsequently renamed &quot;Nam Cheong&quot; after Nam Cheong Estate, a nearby public housing estate, which in turn is named after Nam Cheong Street (another thoroughfare).

Works for Nam Cheong station started on 5 October 2000; the station was built by a joint venture between Balfour Beatty and Zen Pacific. The station was opened for public use on 16 December 2003, coinciding with the pre-opening charity trial run day of the KCR West Rail (later West Rail line), and the part of the station started operation. On 20 December, the KCR West Rail officially commenced operation, and Nam Cheong became the southern terminus of the rail line.

Upon its completion, the station was a shared-use integrated station between MTR and KCR, and the first integrated one between the two systems. The station concourse was divided into two parts (managed by the two rail operators respectively). Special transfer turnstiles were located between the two parts, enabling passengers paying with Octopus card to interchange between the two systems by tapping their card just once.

The operations of MTR and KCR merged on 2 December 2007, and the management of the station unified under MTRCL. Following the network-wide fare zone merger of the former MTR and KCR networks on 28 September 2008, the transfer turnstiles along with the barriers separating the two fare zones were removed, and cross-platform interchange is now provided between platform 1 (Tuen Ma line towards ) and platform 4 (Tung Chung line towards ) and platform 2 (Tuen Ma line towards Wu Kai Sha and platform 3 (Tung Chung line towards ); several passageways were opened between the two platforms. One of the wider passages is aligned with the fifth and sixth carriages of the Hong Kong-bound trains on the Tung Chung line platform.

The Kowloon Southern Link extension of West Rail line opened on 16 August 2009, and the once called West Rail line was extended to on that day. Nam Cheong lost its status as the western terminus of West Rail line, and became an intermediate station for both Tung Chung and West Rail lines.

On 27 June 2021, the officially merged with the (which was already extended into the &quot;Tuen Ma line Phase 1&quot; at the time) in East Kowloon to form the new , as part of the Shatin to Central link project. Hence, Nam Cheong was included in the project and is now an intermediate station on the Tuen Ma line.

== Station layout ==






All four platforms are located at ground level. The platforms are curved because they were built around the existing tracks. However, the gaps are not very large.

Before the merging of fare systems on 28 September 2008, Octopus card users transferring between the West Rail line and Tung Chung line had to use the transfer gates separating fare areas the MTR and KCR systems. Once the card was placed on a reader, the first section of journey fare would be deducted and passengers could walk over to the other fare area. Passengers who accidentally walked to the wrong area by mistake had to exit the station through the exit gates (not the transfer gates) within 15 minutes, or an extra fare was charged.

<text>Jacob Fidelis Ackermann (23 April 1765 – 28 October 1815) was a German professor of anatomy and surgery.

Ackermann was born in Rüdesheim am Rhein. He began his studies at Würzburg and earned his doctorate in Mainz in 1787. After extensive research travel he was promoted to private lecturer for forensic medicine in 1789. He acquired the regular professorship in botanics and later in anatomy when Samuel Thomas von Sömmering resigned his office.

In 1798 the university was dissolved. Ackermann became president and first professor of a newly founded special school of medicine. In 1804 he accepted a call as professor of anatomy and chirurgy at Jena, succeeding Justus Christian Loder. In the following year, he became professor of anatomy and physiology at Heidelberg.

In Heidelberg, Ackermann made himself a name as founder and developer of different institutes such as the &quot;Anatomical Theatre&quot; and the polyclinic.

At the end of the summer semester of 1815, Ackermann traveled to his small manor in the surroundings of Rüdesheim, as was his wont. There he fell ill with nephritis and died soon after.

Ackermann was described by his contemporaries as a very literate person, but also as a very corpulent one. Although he weighed 300 pounds (136 kg), he was said to be able to hop long distances on one leg while whistling cheerfully.

Apart from his publications, the city of Heidelberg conserves a special rarity from the hands of Jacob Ackermann: the dissected skeleton of rogue chieftain &quot;Schinderhannes&quot;, well known through the novels of Carl Zuckmayer.

<text>Ellington is a small village in the civil parish of Ellington and Linton, on the coast of Northumberland, England. Ellington is from Ashington, from Morpeth and north of Newcastle upon Tyne.

Ellington was the site of the last remaining operational deep coal mine in North East England. Ellington Colliery closed on 26 January 2005. It was the last deep mine in the UK to extract coal from under the sea.

The name of the village is thought to derive from the Saxon meaning descendants of Ella.

Today, Ellington is made up almost exclusively of private housing. It has one school, village shops, and one public house, the Plough Inn.

== History ==
Throughout recorded history, the lands of Ellington have had many owners. The manor of Ellington was thought to belong to Adam de Periton in 1240 and later to pass by marriage to the ancient families of Vescy and Welles. The Widdrington family were known to acquire possessions in Ellington as early as the 13th century. In 1715, Lord Widdrington relinquished the manor of Ellington, along with the manors of Woodhorn, Cresswell and Newbiggin. Other lands and interests in Ellington belonging to other landowners were sold in 1750 to Adam Askew of Newcastle upon Tyne. By the early years of the 19th century, the greater part of the village was owned by the Baker-Cresswells. This situation remained until the sale of their estate in 1924 (the family, now based at nearby Bamburgh, is still - 2006 -influential in the area).

Ellington is well known as being a colliery village but was a thriving community long before the opening of the Colliery, having a school, two public houses and several businesses by the mid-19th century.

The Colliery, which was originally owned by the Ashington Coal Company, began production in 1911. By the time the collieries were nationalised in 1947 there were 1,381 men employed. By 1986 the number had grown to around 2,170 men producing approximately 45,000 tonnes of coal per week. Pit ponies were used in the colliery until 1994.

The Colliery changed the face of the one time rural village, with the building of three rows of colliery houses and more shops and businesses. In 1912 a co-operative store was built on land that had once been part of the Cresswell estate, bringing more prosperity to the village. This was eventually superseded by a larger store built in the neighbouring village of Lynemouth.

The colliery was used as the fictional &#x27;Everington&#x27; mine in the Stephen Daldry film &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;.

Hagg Farm, which lies to the north of the village, was bought in 1924 for £8,500 by the Wood family who had been the tenants for over 300 years. The farm consisted of a house, four cottages and of land.

On 16 June 1992 the parish was renamed from &quot;Ellington&quot; to &quot;Ellington and Linton&quot;.

== Education ==
There has been a school in Ellington since 1837; it now offers education for children aged 3 to 11. The original school building of 1837 is now the village library.

To serve the ever-growing population a new school was built in 1976; it soon proved to be too small and remodelling and extension work took place in 1986. At that time the nursery accommodation was added, which facilitated the later provision of the Early Years Unit.

The school crest was designed by a pupil and features a drawing of the colliery, the beach, Alcan smelter and the school.

<text>Gen is a Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) application development environment marketed by Broadcom Inc. Gen was previously known as CA Gen, IEF (Information Engineering Facility), Composer by IEF, Composer, COOL:Gen, Advantage:Gen and AllFusion Gen.

The toolset originally supported the information technology engineering methodology developed by Clive Finkelstein, James Martin and others in the early 1980s. Early versions supported IBM&#x27;s DB2 database, 3270 &#x27;block mode&#x27; screens and generated COBOL code.

In the intervening years the toolset has been expanded to support additional development techniques such as component-based development; creation of client/server and web applications and generation of C, Java and C#. In addition, other platforms are now supported such as many variants of Unix-like Operating Systems (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Linux) as well as Windows.

Its range of supported database technologies have widened to include ORACLE, Microsoft SQL Server, ODBC, JDBC as well as the original DB2.

The toolset is fully integrated - objects identified during analysis carry forward into design without redefinition. All information is stored in a repository (central encyclopedia). The encyclopedia allows for large team development - controlling access so that multiple developers may not change the same object simultaneously.

==Overview==
It was initially produced by Texas Instruments, with input from James Martin and his consultancy firm James Martin Associates, and was based on the Information Engineering Methodology (IEM). The first version was launched in 1987.

IEF (Information Engineering Facility) became popular among large government departments and public utilities. It initially supported a CICS/COBOL/DB2 target environment. However, it now supports a wider range of relational databases and operating systems. IEF was intended to shield the developer from the complexities of building complete multi-tier cross-platform applications.

In 1995, Texas Instruments decided to change their marketing focus for the product. Part of this change included a new name - &quot;Composer&quot;.

By 1996, IEF had become a popular tool. However, it was criticized by some IT professionals for being too restrictive, as well as for having a high per-workstation cost ($15K USD). But it is claimed that IEF reduces development time and costs by removing complexity and allowing rapid development of large scale enterprise transaction processing systems.

In 1997, Composer had another change of branding, Texas Instruments sold the Texas Instruments Software division, including the Composer rights, to Sterling Software. Sterling software changed the well known name &quot;Information Engineering Facility&quot; to &quot;COOL:Gen&quot;. COOL was an acronym for &quot;Common Object Oriented Language&quot; - despite the fact that there was little object orientation in the product.

In 2000, Sterling Software was acquired by Computer Associates (now CA). CA has rebranded the product three times to date and the product is still used widely today. Under CA, recent releases of the tool added support for the CA-Datacom DBMS, the Linux operating system, C# code generation and ASP.NET web clients. The current version is known as CA Gen - version 8 being released in May 2010, with support for customised web services, and more of the toolset being based around the Eclipse framework.

As of 2020, CA Gen is owned and marketed by Broadcom Inc., which rebranded the product to Gen to avoid confusion with the former owner of the product.

There are a variety of &quot;add-on&quot; tools available for Gen, including Project Phoenix from Jumar - a collection of software tools and services focused on the modernisation and re-platforming of existing/legacy Gen applications to new environments, GuardIEn - a Configuration Management and Developer Productivity Suite, QAT Wizard, an interview style wizard that takes advantage of the meta model in Gen, products for multi-platform application reporting and XML/SOAP enabling of Gen applications., and developer productivity tools such as Access Gen, APMConnect, QA Console and Upgrade Console from Response Systems 

Version 8.6 of CA Gen came to market in June 2016.

Version 8.6.3 of CA Gen was released in 2021. Following this release, Broadcom have switched to a continuous delivery model with new features to be delivered as patches.

<doc id="965843" wikidata="Q735732" url="?curid=965843" title="Storz">
<text>Storz is a type of hose coupling invented by in 1882 and patented in Switzerland in 1890, and patented in the U.S. in 1893 that connects using interlocking hooks and flanges. It was first specified in standard FEN 301-316, and has been used by German fire brigades since 1933. (See German delivery hose article.) Amongst other uses, it has been widely employed on fire hoses in firefighting applications. It is the standard coupling on fire hoses in Portugal, Denmark, Slovenia, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Czechia, Israel, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Greece. It is also one of the standard couplings on fire hoses in Australia and the United States.

The Storz coupling system is also widely used for filling of bulk wood pellet storage systems in Europe (Storz-A or size), although in France and Belgium the equivalent Guillemin coupling is more commonly employed.

Storz connectors are usually made of brass or aluminium. They can be manufactured by casting for general hose connection and low pressure applications, but for firefighting, it is better to use forgings to guarantee the safety and durability of the coupling.

It is sometimes referred to as a sexless coupling, because rather than having a male and a female end connected by screw threads, either identical end can be joined to any other end of the same diameter. This is also called hermaphroditic or two-way connection. To couple a Storz connection, the two opposing couplings are pressed together such that the hooks of each one are inserted into the slots in the flange of the other. Then they are rotated in opposite directions until they are tight, or latches engage. This creates a watertight connection between the internal packing gaskets. To uncouple them, the latches are released and the connectors are turned in the opposite directions from coupling, and then separated when the hooks and slots are aligned. Special wrenches are designed for assisting with use of Storz connectors.

The main benefit to using Storz couplings is speed of hose connection, as a hose can be locked with a quarter-turn. By comparison, locking hoses using threaded couplings often takes several turns. Because of this, Storz couplings are widely viewed as a safer alternative to using threaded couplings. A secondary benefit over threaded couplings is that the connecting faces and hooks are less prone to damage if the coupling is dropped onto, or dragged over, a hard surface.

Storz couplers are available commercially in the following non-DIN-specified sizes:
DIN standards define the following pressure couplings:
DIN standards define the following suction couplings:
DIN standards define the following fixed couplings (for securing fittings to hoses):
DIN standards define the following threaded adapters:
DIN standards define the following caps:
DIN standards define the following swivel reducers:
==United States usage==

Storz rapidly became a standard for fire hydrants throughout much of Europe, but it took nearly one hundred years before the main larger &quot;steamer ports&quot; on fire hydrants started to be converted to the Storz coupling in the United States. U.S. fire engines typically carry LDH (large diameter hose) with Storz couplings on both ends for connections between fire hydrants and pumps. However, if a hydrant usually has threaded couplings, an adapter is required to use with Storz. All major U.S. hydrant manufacturers now offer Storz couplings as original equipment on their hydrants, to connect with the Storz couplings used by firefighters. Hydrants may also be retro-fitted from thread to Storz to aid interoperability between firefighting organizations.

The 100 mm (4-inch) and 125 mm (5-inch) Storz couplers have been specified in NFPA 1963, Standard for Fire Hose Connections, since the 1993 edition.

U.S. cities that have fire hydrants with 125 mm Storz connectors include Raleigh, NC and the City of Corvallis, OR (adapter on 4-inch threaded outlet).

The 150 mm (6-inch) size is occasionally used for PVC suction hose, in place of the industry-standard 6 NH threads.

<text>Pierre Garand (; born 26 June 1972), known by his stage name Garou (; a diminutive of his last name), is a Canadian singer and actor from Sherbrooke, Québec. He sings in French and English.

He is known for his work in the musical &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot; (playing Quasimodo in both the original French and English casts) and the No. 1 hits &quot;Belle&quot;, &quot;Seul&quot;, &quot;Sous le vent&quot;, and &quot;La Rivière de notre enfance&quot;.

==Life and career==
Pierre Garand began playing guitar at the age of three, at the encouragement of his father. He went on to serve in the military and started a band in 1992 called the Untouchables. In 1997, he was discovered by Luc Plamondon while singing American blues tunes in a Sherbrooke bar. He was drafted by Plamondon to play the role of Quasimodo in his musical &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;, which made him a star in France and launched his singing career. He went on to play the role for three years.

His first studio album, &quot;Seul&quot;, became the best-selling French record of 2001 and remains one of the best-selling French albums of all time, achieving two million sales in Europe and going three times Platinum in Canada.

He continued his string of hits with a live album and released a second studio record, &quot;Reviens&quot;, in 2003. Sales for his third album, &quot;Garou&quot;, remained strong, and he issued the English crossover record &quot;Piece of My Soul&quot; in 2008. It debuted at No. 2 in Canada and No. 3 in France. Despite this success, the album became his first in France not to reach Platinum status, although it became his best-selling record in North America in seven years. His next album, &quot;Gentleman cambrioleur&quot;, featured cover songs in French and English and became his first record to miss the top five in France, where it modestly peaked at No. 35, staying on the charts for 17 weeks. He released &quot;Version intégrale&quot; in 2010, which became another top 40 hit in France and Canada.

Garou performed the Jean-Pierre Ferland song &quot;Un peu plus haut, un peu plus loin&quot; at the 2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Vancouver. He has also performed at the charity event Les Enfoirés for the past 19 years.{

In 2011, he was cast in the lead role of Zark in the Cirque du Soleil musical &quot;Zarkana&quot;, in New York.

Since 2010, Garou has released five further studio albums: &quot;Rhythm and Blues&quot; (2012), &quot;Au milieu de ma vie&quot; (2013), &quot;It&#x27;s Magic!&quot; (2014), &quot;Soul City&quot; (2019), and &quot;Garou joue Dassin&quot; (2022).

==Collaborations==
Garou has collaborated with a number of musicians and composers, including with Luc Plamondon in &quot;Notre-dame de Paris&quot;. The single &quot;Belle&quot; was lifted from the musical and stayed atop the French charts for a record-breaking 18 weeks. It remained the most successful song in French history until 2009. In 2000, he had a successful duet with Celine Dion; &quot;Sous le vent&quot; became his third No. 1 single in France. In 2004, he worked with Michel Sardou for his fourth and final No. 1 single, &quot;La Rivière de notre enfance&quot;. The following year, he appeared with 15-year-old singer Marilou on her song &quot;Tu es comme ça&quot;. 2008&#x27;s &quot;Piece of My Soul&quot;, his first English album, includes a songwriting credit by Rob Thomas on the track &quot;Stand Up&quot;.

==Personal life==
Garou has a daughter, born in 2001, with an ex-girlfriend. He has also dated former Yemeni singer and entertainer Arwa Jassem, known as Lahlouba. From 2007 to June 2010, he dated French singer Lorie.

<doc id="965848" wikidata="Q2756002" url="?curid=965848" title="Port Sunlight">
<text>Port Sunlight is a model village in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside, England. It is located between Lower Bebington and New Ferry, on the Wirral Peninsula. Port Sunlight was built by Lever Brothers to accommodate workers in its soap factory (now part of Unilever); work commenced in 1888. The name is derived from Lever Brothers&#x27; most popular brand of cleaning agent, Sunlight.

Port Sunlight contains 900 Grade II listed buildings, and was declared a conservation area in 1978. Port Sunlight has been informally suggested for World Heritage Site (WHS) status to protect it from development and to preserve the unique character for future generations; however, it is not yet on the current UK &quot;tentative list&quot; for future consideration as a WHS. In the 2001 Census, its population was 1,450.

==History==
In 1887, Lever Brothers began looking for a new site on which to expand its soap-making business, which was at that time based in Warrington. The company bought of flat unused marshy land in Cheshire, south of the River Mersey. It was large enough to allow space for expansion, and had a prime location between the river and a railway line. The site became Port Sunlight, where William Lever built his works and a model village to house his employees. William Lever (who was created a baronet in December 1911, and was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as the 1st Baron Leverhulme in June 1917, and was further advanced to being the 1st Viscount Leverhulme in December 1922) personally supervised planning the village, and employed nearly thirty different architects. Between 1899 and 1914, 800 houses were built to house a population of 3,500. The garden village had allotments and public buildings including the Lady Lever Art Gallery, a cottage hospital, schools, a concert hall, open air swimming pool, church, and a temperance hotel. Lever introduced welfare schemes, and provided for the education and entertainment of his workforce, encouraging recreation and organisations which promoted art, literature, science or music.

The aims of Lord Leverhulme, as he became, were &quot;to socialise and Christianise business relations and get back to that close family brotherhood that existed in the good old days of hand labour.&quot; He claimed that Port Sunlight was an exercise in profit sharing, but rather than share profits directly, he invested them in the village. He said, &quot;It would not do you much good if you send it down your throats in the form of bottles of whisky, bags of sweets, or fat geese at Christmas. On the other hand, if you leave the money with me, I shall use it to provide for you everything that makes life pleasant – nice houses, comfortable homes, and healthy recreation.&quot;

The historical significance of Port Sunlight lies in its combination of model industrial housing, providing materially decent conditions for working people, with the architectural and landscape values of the garden suburb, influenced by the ideas of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement. Each block of houses was designed by a different architect. The backs of any of the houses cannot be seen, and each house is unique. In terms of architectural features, there is half-timbering, carved woodwork and masonry, pargetting (ornamental plaster work) moulded and twisted chimneys and leaded glazed patterns. Some houses were built in Flemish style, with bricks imported from Belgium.

==Geography==
Port Sunlight is on the eastern side of the Wirral Peninsula, at the western side of the River Mersey. The area is approximately south-south-east of the Irish Sea at New Brighton and about east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at Gayton. The area is between above sea level.

==Community==

One of the great buildings in Port Sunlight is the Lady Lever Art Gallery. A keen art collector, Lever travelled all over the world and liked to show the villagers the art he collected. Opened in 1922 by Princess Beatrice, the art gallery shows Lever&#x27;s collection and modern-day artwork. The collection includes a range of furniture, paintings, sculptures and ceramics.

Other notable buildings include the Lyceum, the Gladstone Theatre (which hosts local amateur dramatic productions), Hesketh Hall (which housed the local branch of the Royal British Legion until 2013, when it was converted into 13 flats) and the &quot;Bridge Inn&quot; public house.

The village contains Christ Church, a United Reformed Church, and opposite is a small primary school. Church Drive Primary School is open to people living outside the village and residents. There is a war memorial by Goscombe John in the village centre in memory of soldiers that died in World War I. Port Sunlight has a water feature. The open air swimming pool is now a garden centre and cafe.

Hulme Hall was built as a women&#x27;s dining hall, but is now in use as a local community centre and hosts events.

The Cottage Hospital, opened in 1907, was closed for many years but refurbished and reopened in 2008 as the Leverhulme Hotel.

Until the 1980s, all residents were employees of Unilever and their families. During this decade the houses were first sold privately. The former village school is now a working men&#x27;s club.

The Port Sunlight River Park, on the banks of the River Mersey between Cammell Laird Shipyard and Bromborough Dock, opened to the public in 2014. The park is opposite Otterspool promenade and offers a view of Liverpool&#x27;s waterfront, including the Anglican Cathedral and the Royal Albert Dock. It is an open, natural space that has been created on the former landfill site at Bromborough Dock. The site has been taken over by The Land Trust, &#x27;a charity that is committed to the long term, sustainable management of open space for community benefit&#x27;. Walkways allow the public to appreciate the wildflowers and other wildlife; there is also a wetland area.

==Transport==
The area is served by both Bebington and Port Sunlight railway stations, on the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail network. There are regular train services to Chester, Ellesmere Port and to Liverpool via Birkenhead.

==Cultural references==
Port Sunlight was widely celebrated. In 1912, it became the subject of a hit West End musical comedy, &quot;The Sunshine Girl&quot;, at the Gaiety Theatre, London. It starred Phyllis Dare, one of the most popular pin-ups of the Edwardian era, and was written by Paul Alfred Rubens. The show introduced the tango dance to British audiences. In 1919, Lever Brothers made a 40-minute-long sponsored film, &quot;Port Sunlight&quot;, to promote the town and factory.

The Sunlight Cottages in Glasgow are rare surviving relics from the series of Great Exhibitions held in Kelvingrove Park in 1888, 1901 and 1911. These rambling, asymmetrical cottages were constructed in 1901 as replicas of two of the Port Sunlight houses. Designed in an idealised Elizabethan half-timbered style by Exhibition architect James Miller, the houses are picturesquely sited high above the Kelvin. Donated to the city of Glasgow by Lord Leverhulme after the close of the Exhibition, the cottages have been used as park workers&#x27; housing ever since.

Port Sunlight was also used as a filming location for the British television series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; numerous times.

==Notable people==

Hulme Hall was the venue for drummer Ringo Starr&#x27;s official debut as a member of The Beatles on 18 August 1962. It is also the site of the band&#x27;s first ever broadcast interview. The interview was with local disc jockey Monty Lister and recorded for Radio Clatterbridge on 27 October 1962.

Fiona Bruce, host (2008 to present) of the long-running British television show &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, grew up in Port Sunlight. In her introduction to an episode of the programme (Series 35 Episode 2) set in the village, she stood in front of her childhood home and explained that her father was a managing director of a division of Unilever.

<doc id="965857" wikidata="Q7815091" url="?curid=965857" title="Tom Brown (British Army soldier)">
<text>Sir Thomas Brown (1705–1746) was born in Kirkleatham, in present-day Redcar and Cleveland, in the north-east region of England. He was a hero of the Battle of Dettingen (27 June 1743), in Bavaria during the War of the Austrian Succession; the last time that a British monarch, in this case King George II, personally led his own country&#x27;s troops into battle.

==Biography==
Little is known of his early life, save for him being a shoemaker&#x27;s apprentice in Yarm, before joining the Army.

Once enlisted, Brown fought as a private soldier in King&#x27;s Own Regiment Dragoons (Bland&#x27;s Dragoons). During this battle, he had two horses killed under him. In the thick of the action, Brown witnessed the regiment&#x27;s standard falling to the ground and was captured by the French. Brown attempted to dismount his horse to recover the standard, but was struck by a blow from a sabre and lost two fingers from his left hand. His horse bolted in fright to the rear of the enemy lines, where Brown subsequently caught sight of his standard in the hands of a French trooper. Brown reclaimed the standard after killing the enemy soldier, remounted a horse, secured his regiments&#x27; standard by wedging its flagstaff between himself and the saddle, and returned to his own by galloping through the massed ranks of the enemy. During this return, Brown was further wounded by the French, receiving eight sabre cuts in his face, neck and head, and lost most of his nose as a result. Brown diced with death; two musket bullets hit his back, and three passed through his headgear. Returning to his own company a hero, he was applauded with &#x27;three loud Huzzas&#x27; in recognition of his valiant bravery.

After his army service, Brown retired from the 3rd Hussars, whereupon he was rewarded by King George II with a gold-topped walking stick, a replica nose made of silver to replace his he lost in battle, and a King&#x27;s pension of 30 crowns (£30) a year. Brown moved to Yarm and opened an inn bearing his own name, where he lived out the remainder of his life.

Brown died in Yarm in , and is buried there in the churchyard of St Mary Magdalene&#x27;s Church (OS grid ref: NZ416129). His grave can still be seen and is now marked with a Portland stone replica of a Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) headstone, presented by the Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars in 1968.

==Honours==
The Battle of Dettingen is notable for two things: it was the last time a British monarch personally led his troops into battle, and the last time a serving soldier was knighted on the battlefield. Tom Brown was knighted as a Knight Banneret by the King at the end of the battle for his actions, as noted in &quot;The London Magazine, and Monthly Chronologer&quot; as &quot;the Trooper who retook the Standard from the French&quot;.

This is believed to be the last time a sovereign conferred the title Knight Bannerets to troops on the field of battle. It is recorded that the King created sixteen Knights Bannerets on the battlefield in a diary entry by Miss Gertrude Savile, which states &quot;This honour had been laid aside since James I, when Baronets were instituted&quot;.

==Legacy==
Brown&#x27;s inn once contained an oil-painted sign which depicted him as the hero of the Battle of Dettingen. This sign is now lost, but a replica is located in Yarm Town Hall.

<text>Lactobacillus acidophilus (Neo-Latin &#x27;acid-loving milk-bacillus&#x27;) is a rod-shaped, Gram-positive, homofermentative, anaerobic microbe first isolated from infant feces in the year 1900. The species is commonly found in humans, specifically the gastrointestinal tract and oral cavity as well as some speciality fermented foods such as fermented milk or yogurt, though it is not the most common species for this. The species most readily grows at low pH levels (below 5.0), and has an optimum growth temperature of 37 °C. Certain strains of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; show strong probiotic effects, and are commercially used in dairy production. The genome of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; has been sequenced.

&quot;L. acidophilus&quot; has antagonistic effects on the growth of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium,&quot; and &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;. Out of the four organisms, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is the most affected. Along with &quot;S. aureus&quot;, the other Gram-positive bacteria, &quot;C. perfringens,&quot; was affected more by &quot;L. acidophilus,&quot; than the two other bacteria that are Gram-negative. &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; is found to also reduce oral plaque formation by &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;.

== History ==
&quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus&quot; was first isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract in 1900 by Ernst Moro with the original name &quot;Bacillus acidophilus.&quot; Over time, there have been many changes to the methods for characterizing taxonomy of organisms, leading to the genus distinction of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; in 1929. Complication around finding the original strain arose when multiple strains of a single isolate were given a variety of names. Most studies on &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; was focused on one particular strain, &quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus&quot; NCFM. With the large amount of information discovered about &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; NCFM, the US Food and Drug Administration has adjudged the microbe to be an approved ingredient in beverages, dairy products, and other probiotic foods.

== Biological and biochemical features ==
=== Morphology ===
&quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus&quot; is an immobile rod-shaped (bacillus), gram-positive organism that ranges in size from 2-10 μm in size. &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; has one phospholipid bilayer membrane with a large cell wall consisting of peptidoglycan exterior to the membrane. The cell wall of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; is interwoven with teichoic acids and surface proteins, with anionic and neutral polysaccharides as well as an S-layer lining the exterior of the cell. The S-layer proteins of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; have been shown to adhere to epithelial cells as well as mucus and other extracellular proteins. The S-layer is made of two structural domains. The C-terminal domain is responsible for cell wall anchoring, while the N-terminal domain is responsible for interacting with the cell environment, as well as S-layer self assembly. In the &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; species, the N-terminal region shows high amino acid variability along with low sequence homology (31-72%). However, the C-terminus shows low amino acid variability and high amino acid sequence homology (77-99%).&quot;L. acidophilus&quot; does not have any extracellular means of motion like a flagellum or pilli, and therefore is an immobile microbe.
=== Metabolism ===

&quot;L. acidophilus&quot; is a homofermentative anaerobic microorganism, meaning it only produces lactic acid as an end product of fermentation; and that it can only ferment hexoses (not pentoses) by way of the EMP pathway (glycolysis). &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; has a slower growth time in milk than when in a host due to limited available nutrients. Because of its use as a probiotic in milk, a study done by the American &quot;Journal of Dairy Science&quot; examined the nutrient requirements of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; in an effort to increase its low growth rate. The study found that glucose and the amino acids cysteine, glutamic acid, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tyrosine, valine, and arginine are essential nutrients to the growth of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot;, with glycine, calcium-pantothenate, and Mn2+ acting as stimulatory nutrients. The study helps to explain the low growth rate of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; in milk, as some of the amino acids necessary to &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; growth are lacking in milk. Adding amino acids with high rates of consumption to fermented milk is a possible solution to the problem.

=== Genomics ===
The specialization of prokaryotic genomes is distinguishable when recognizing how the prokaryote replicates its DNA during replication. In &quot;L. acidophilus,&quot; replication begins at an origin called oriC and moves bi-directionally in the form of replication forks. The DNA is synthesized continuously on the leading strand and in discontinuous Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand with help from the DNA polymerase III enzyme. An RNA primer is needed to initiate the DNA synthesis on the leading and lagging strands. DNA polymerase III follows the RNA primer with the synthesis of DNA in the 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; direction. &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; consists of a small genome with a low guanine-cytosine content, approximately 30%. A study comparing 46 genomes of varying strains of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; found the genome size ranged from 1.95 Mb to 2.09 Mb, with an average size of 1.98 Mb. The average number of coding sequences in the genome was 1780, with the strains isolated from fermented foods and commercial probiotics having more coding sequences on average than those isolated from humans. &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; has an open state pan-genome (all of the genes within a species), meaning that the pan-genome size increased as the number of genomes sequenced increased. The core-genome (the genes shared by all individuals of a species) consist of around 1117 genes in the case of &quot;L. acidophilus.&quot; Genetic analysis also revealed that all &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; strains contained at least 15 families of glycosyl hydrolases, which are the key enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism. Each of the 15 GH families were involved in metabolizing common carbohydrates, such as glucose, galactose, fructose, sucrose, starch, and maltose. Genes encoding antibiotic resistance by means of antibiotic efflux, antibiotic target alteration, and antibiotic target protection were present in all &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; strains, providing protection against 18 different classes of antibiotic across all strains. Fluoroquinolone, glycopeptide, lincosamide, macrolide and tetracycline were the five classes of antibiotic to which &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; displayed the highest level of tolerance, with more than 300 genes relevant to these classes.

== Environment ==

&quot;L. acidophilus&quot; grows naturally in the oral and intestinal cavities of mammals. Nearly all Lactobacillus species have special mechanisms for heat resistance which involves enhancing the activity of chaperones. Chaperones are highly conserved stress proteins that allow for enhanced resistance to elevated temperatures, ribosome stability, temperature sensing, and control of ribosomal function at high temperatures. This ability to function at high temperatures is extremely important to cell yield during the fermentation process, and genetic testing on &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; in order to increase its temperature tolerance is currently being done. When being considered as a probiotic, it is important for &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; to have traits suitable for life in the gastrointestinal tract. Tolerance of low pH and high toxicity levels are often required. These traits vary and are strain specific. Mechanisms by which these tolerances are expressed include differences in cell wall structure, along with other changes is protein expression. Changes in salt concentration have been shown to affect &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; viability, but only after exposure to higher salt concentrations. In another experiment highlighted by the American Dairy Science Association, viable cell counts only showed a significant reduction after exposure to NaCl concentrations of 7.5% or higher. Cells were also observed to distinctly elongate when grown in conditions of 10% NaCl concentration or higher. &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; is also very well suited for living in a dairy medium, as fermented milk is the ideal method of delivery for introducing &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; into a gut microbiome. The viability of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; cells encapsulated by spray drying technology stored at refrigerated condition (4 °C) is higher than the viability of cells stored at room temperature (25 °C).

=== Quorum sensing ===
Quorum sensing among cells is the process among which cell signaling can lead to coordinated activities which can ultimately help bacteria control gene expression in a consecutive sequence. This is accomplished via detection of small autoinducers which are secreted in response to increasing cell-population density. In &quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus,&quot; which can be found in the gastrointestinal tract, quorum sensing is important for bacterial interaction when considering biofilm formation and toxin secretion. In &quot;L. acidophilus&quot;, along with many other bacteria, the &quot;luxS&quot;-mediated quorum sensing is involved in the regulation of behavior. In monoculture, the production of &quot;luxS&quot; increased during the exponential growth phase and started to plateau as it progressed to the stationary phase. Up-regulation of &quot;luxS&quot; can occur when &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; is placed in co-cultivation with another &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species.

=== Vaginal microbiota ===
&quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus&quot; is relatively rare in the vaginal microbiome; it is more common in the gut. Other species in the genus are more common, including &quot;Lactobacillus crispatus&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus gasseri&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus jensenii&quot;, and &quot;Lactobacillus iners&quot;.
In experiments, &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; seemed to decrease &quot;Candida albicans&quot;’ ability to adhere to vaginal epithelial cells; however, &quot;L. acidophilus&quot;’ use in preventing yeast infections is unclear because this species of &quot;Lactobacilli&quot; has also been found not to have a very strong ability to adhere to (and thereby colonize) the vaginal cells.

== Therapeutic uses ==

Research has shown that the presence of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; can produce a variety of probiotic effects in humans, such as acting as a barrier against pathogens, assisting in lactose digestion, enhancing immune response, and reducing cholesterol level. &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; must exist in concentrations of 10^5 - 10^6 c.f.u (colony-forming units) per mL in order for these effects to be seen. A study conducted at the Wake Forest School of Medicine examined the effects of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; on the structure and composition of the gut microbiome of mice with respect to the age of the mice. The research established the importance of the interactions between microbes within a gut microbial environment on the overall health of the organism, and the data showed that mice supplemented with &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; had reduced proteobacteria levels, and increased levels of other probiotic bacteria when compared to other mice of similar age. Another study conducted at Maranatha Christian University studied the impact of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; cell free supernatants (a liquid medium containing the metabolites produced by microbial growth) on the growth pattern of &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot;, the microbe associated with Typhoid fever. The study showed that the presence of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; metabolites significantly inhibited the growth curves displayed by &quot;S. typhi&quot;, supporting the idea that &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; presence has a positive impact on the species makeup of a gut microbial community, providing the organism with intestinal health benefits. The innate immune system of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; also produces antimicrobial peptides. The group of short peptides found there have shown antimicrobial properties such as their strength against viruses and other cell types, including cancer cells. There is also some evidence supporting the use of a symbiotic gel (containing &quot;L. acidophilus&quot;) in treating gastrointestinal symptoms in patients who had received a hemodialysis treatment. This gel also reduced the occurrence of vomit, heartburn, and stomachaches. Further study concerning this subject is needed to draw firm conclusions.

=== Dairy industry usage ===

As stated in a journal from the American Dairy Science Association, &quot;&quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus&quot; is a commercial strain and probiotic that is widely used in the dairy industry to obtain high-quality fermentation products.&quot; Increased levels of beneficial bacteria, and decreased levels of pathogenic bacteria within the intestine due to the consumption of fermented milk containing strains of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; has a range of probiotic effects. Reduced serum cholesterol levels, stimulated immune response, and improved lactic acid digestion are all probiotic effects associated with intestinal &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; presence&quot;. L. acidophilus&quot; was also effective in reducing &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot; levels in saliva, as well as decreasing risk factors associated with the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The strain of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; that has been most widely researched, and is most widely used as a probiotic and is referred to as NCFM.

The most common species of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; for use in the production of yoghurt is &quot;Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.&quot;

===Side effects===

Although probiotics are generally safe, when they are used by oral administration there is a small risk of passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the blood stream (bacteremia), which can cause adverse health consequences. Some people, such as those with a compromised immune system, short bowel syndrome, central venous catheters, cardiac valve disease and premature infants, may be at higher risk for adverse events.

<doc id="965862" wikidata="Q1531303" url="?curid=965862" title="Mitsubishi Starion">
<text>The Mitsubishi Starion is a two-door, turbocharged four-cylinder rear-wheel drive four-seat fastback sports car manufactured and marketed by Mitsubishi from 1982 until 1989 — with badge engineered variants marketed in North America as the Conquest, under the Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth brands.

The Starion was one of the first modern Japanese turbocharged performance automobiles with electronic fuel injection.

==Overview==
Mitsubishi began marketing the Starion in 1982, during a period in which a number of Japanese grand tourer (GT) sports cars were available, including the Nissan Z cars, Mazda RX-7, Toyota Supra and to a lesser extent, the Honda Prelude, Isuzu Piazza and Subaru XT.

The Starion was marketed in the US as the Mitsubishi Starion and badge engineered variants of it were marketed as the Dodge, Plymouth and Chrysler Conquest. In the UK it was sold as the Colt Starion.

It was manufactured in two body configurations, a narrowbody and widebody; the narrower style complied with Japanese exterior dimension regulations taxing larger vehicles and engine displacement exceeding two liters. Only the narrowbody was offered through the 1985.5 model year.

The introduction of the widebody also split the car into two ranges: a non-intercooled lower-horsepower car using the narrow body style and a high-performance intercooled widebody. In most markets, widebody cars were given the label of Starion ESI-R or Conquest TSi. Markets that never received the widebody had the ESI-R label, these cars had similar performance as the widebodies. Widebody cars were offered in 1986–1989 model years in the US.

The Starion was featured in the 1984 movie &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot;.

==Name==
Mitsubishi says &quot;Starion&quot; is a contraction of &quot;Star of Arion&quot; — and refers to both a star and the mythical horse, Arion. 
The cover of the original Japanese Starion sales brochure, published by Mitsubishi (May 1982) carried the text: &quot;the name STARION — derived from the combination of star and Arion, Hercules&#x27; horse in Greek mythology, symbolizes a sense of the universe, and of power and high performance.&quot;

Several sources attribute the name to struggles by Japanese engineers to pronounce the word stallion. An early Japanese television commercial for the Starion closed with a logo of a stallion&#x27;s head with the word &quot;Starion&quot; below it. One translation of the voiceover says the name refers to a star and the mythical horse, Arion. The Mitsubishi Colt and Mitsubishi Eclipse featured equine names, with the Eclipse named after the champion racehorse.

==Design==


The Starion uses a traditional front-mounted engine with rear-wheel drive layout. Many came with a limited slip differential and anti-lock brakes (single channel, rear wheels only) as standard features. The entire chassis was derived from the previous high-performance variant of the Mitsubishi Sapporo or Mitsubishi Galant Lambda sports coupé, with a MacPherson strut suspension and sway bars that were fitted to the front and rear. Rack and pinion steering was not offered, instead gearbox steering was standard on all models.

Engine capacity differed between markets. American customers received the larger SOHC Astron G54B 2.6 L engine. Most markets received the SOHC 2.0 L Sirius G63B engine, subsequently featured in DOHC form in later Mitsubishi sport compacts such as the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. Both the 2.0 L and the 2.6 L produced roughly the same horsepower, the larger 2.6 L did have a slight torque advantage and the 2.0L had a higher redline. Reporters of the time considered the 2.0l to be peaky and exciting, while the American market 2.6l had plenty of torque, but was less rewarding. Both engines featured computer-controlled fuel injection and turbocharging. After 1987, European Starion models were also fitted with the 2.6 L engine, as was the GSR-VR for Japan. The move to the 2.6 L in all markets was spurred by emissions restrictions around the world tightening to meet the American standards for lead in fuels. Reviews during the change were negative as many felt the car was slower, for most of these markets this was the case as the engine change also coincided with a move to the heavier body style.

From 1984 until 1987 in Japan a 12-valve (two intake, one exhaust) SOHC intercooled version of the 2.0 L G63B was made available in the top-spec GSR-V (and some GSR-VR) trim grade Starions. This setup was known as the Dual Action Super Head (or DASH for short) due to its ability to activate the third intake valve above a certain RPM, thereby increasing top end response, flow and overall engine performance. Redline was increased to 7000 rpm on these models.

Horsepower for the turbocharged models ranged between depending upon which turbocharger was fitted, the presence of an intercooler, and whether the 8-valve or 12-valve head was used.

A naturally aspirated version known as the GX was offered in the Japanese market, with production ending in 1983. The Starion GX was offered without power windows, air conditioning, independent rear suspension, fuel injection or power-assisted steering.

Seating was a 2+2 with rear seats unsuitable for large adults. The front seats were adjustable for lumbar, angle, knee support, position and featured variable-angle side-braces.

Front seat belts were located in the doors for the driver and front passenger. 1987 and later American models featured electrically operated seat belts. Newer models also featured power windows that remained powered up to 30 seconds after the engine was turned off. In Japan, some of the early cars built still featured fender-mounted mirrors in the traditional Japanese style.

A five-speed manual transmission was standard in most models, however, an automatic transmission was sold as an option in some markets.

Later upgrades to the model included an intercooler, five-lug wheels replacing the four-bolt wheels it had shared with the rear wheel drive Mitsubishi Galant Lambda, rear power train changes from four- to six-bolt axles, various fuel management upgrades and upgrades to the transmission.

For the 1989 and 1989 model years, an optional handling package was added. Mitsubishi referred to it as the &quot;Sports Handling Package&quot;, option code SH. Chrysler referred to it as the &quot;Performance Handling Package&quot;, option code AGA. Both variants are commonly referred to as SHP. The SHP package included adjustable front and rear struts,1 inch wider wheels (from 16 x 7 to 16 x 8 front and 16 x 8 to 16 x 9 rear), and wider tires (225/50 and 245/45). The package can be retrofitted to earlier pre-widebody cars but includes converting to 5-lug hubs from the 4-lug hubs.

The drag coefficient was around 0.32, superior to the Mazda RX-7 and the Nissan 300ZX upon its release.

Notable aftermarket upgrades include multi-port injection (MPI) consisting of standalone engine management (programmable computers) to control individual fuel injectors, one per cylinder versus the stock PCI-ECM two injector system. Two injector systems, primary (idle injector) and secondary (boost injector) non-sequential firing (1983–1986) and sequential firing (1987–1989).

2.0 L G63B engine, apart from GSR-VR which has 2.6 L G54B.

The Japanese domestic market had a large range of Starions to choose from.
* GX - 1982–1983 - live rear axle, non-turbo engine
* GSR-I, GSR-II, GSR-III, GSR-X - 1982–1984 - turbocharged, the earliest models were non-intercooled (). Intercooler versions had 
* GSR-II, GSR-III, GSR-X - 1984–1987 - mid-life refresh, can be distinguished from the earlier Starions by large fog lights in the front bumper

* GSR-VR - 1987–1989 - widebody, equipped with the 2.6 L Astron engine (). A small number of widebodies (approx. 73) were produced with the Sirius DASH as a limited edition model known as 2000GSR-VR

The Roman numeral after &#x27;GSR&#x27; denotes the vehicle specification. Some examples can be found below:

* GSR-I - base model
* GSR-II - power steering and electric windows, optional digital dash cluster and trip computer
* GSR-III - improved audio system, trip computer system, digital dash cluster, and air conditioning.

* JA - 1982–1984
* JB - 1984–1985
* JD - 1985–1987

===North America===

It was marketed in North America by Mitsubishi as the Starion from 1983 until 1989. It was also sold as a captive import by Chrysler as the Conquest, under both the Dodge and Plymouth names from 1984 until 1986 and only under the Chrysler name from 1987 until 1989. For model year 1987, Mitsubishi introduced a passive restraint system for front occupants which featured automatic shoulder belts. The safety feature remained through the final 1989 model year.

The Conquest used the 2.6 L G54B engine with TD05-12A MHI (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) turbocharger. The TD05-12A (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) turbocharger was also fitted to the earlier, non-intercooled narrow-body models, producing .

* EX II - narrowbody with intercooler
* EX - luxury version
* Turbo - base model

With the exception of Australia, many models were available as either narrow-body or wide-body shell styles.

==Motorsports==
The Starion was a prominent competitor in motorsports up to International level during the 1980s and performed well on the circuit in Group A and Group N races of the era. Andy McLennan driving a Simmons Drums sponsored Starion was very successful, picking up many race wins and a Monroe championship, this against the semi works car of Colin Blower. In the Netherlands, John Hugenholtz won the over 2L class in the Dutch Championship, with the Colin Blower-prepared Mitsubishi Dealers car. In the United States, the Starion became best known for successes in endurance racing at several SCCA sanctioned events, and in Japan at the Japanese Touring Car Championship. Starions from Dave Wolin&#x27;s Team Mitsubishi, with turbocharged 2.6 L G54B engines built by noted Lotus engine guru Dave Vegher, captured the prestigious &quot;Longest Day of Nelson Ledges&quot; 24-hour endurance race four years running from 1984 through 1987. Team Mitsubishi Starions also won the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) U.S. Endurance Championships three of those four years, competing against the fully factory-backed (Wolin&#x27;s team was only partially sponsored by Mitsubishi) efforts from Chrysler, Audi, Nissan and Mazda. Although not commonly seen in modern motorsports, a number are still raced on both circuit and in special stage rally events, usually by privateers.

===Starion 4WD===

The Starion was not very successful off-road, but found victory in Group A World Rally Championships and Asia Pacific Rally Championships during 1987 and 1988. An all wheel drive version of the Starion was also produced for Group B specifications (one of the few Japanese automobile manufacturers to enter this class), but after an encouraging start as a prototype, it was not homologated before the FIA banned Group B cars for safety reasons. The Starion was converted to all wheel drive by adding a strengthened transfer case from a Pajero behind the transmission. This configuration allowed the engine to be situated well back in the chassis, for improved front/rear weight distribution compared to the Audi Quattro, whose configuration required the engine to be far forward in the car. Although the wheelbase did not change, the use of regular headlights rather than the production model&#x27;s pop-up headlights allowed the nose to be six inches shorter, as well as saving several pounds in weight. Further weight was saved by the use of carbon fiber for the driveshafts, sumpguard, and lower arms of the suspension, and fiberglass for the hood (bonnet), tailgate, door skins, fenders, bumpers and spoilers, resulting in a final weight of less than , lighter than the Audi Quattro. The car was developed with a turbocharged and intercooled version of Mitsubishi&#x27;s 2.0 L fuel injected engine, but the final goal was to use a turbocharged and intercooled version of the Sirius Dash engine that Mitsubishi announced at the 1983 Tokyo Motor Show, which switched electronically at 2500 rpm from one inlet valve per cylinder to two. The car was campaigned for Mitsubishi by Team Ralliart in Essex, Great Britain, under rally veteran Andrew Cowan and engineer Alan Wilkinson, who had developed the Audi Quattro for Audi Sport UK.

<doc id="965874" wikidata="Q2319815" url="?curid=965874" title="Nomex">
<text>Nomex is a trademarked term for an inherently flame-resistant fabric with meta-aramid chemistry widely used for industrial applications and fire protection equipment. It was developed in the early 1960s by DuPont and first marketed in 1967. 

The fabric is often combined with Kevlar to increase its resistance for breakage or tear. 

== Properties ==
Nomex and related aramid polymers are related to nylon, but have aromatic backbones, and hence are more rigid and more durable. Nomex is an example of a &quot;meta&quot; variant of the aramids (Kevlar is a &quot;para&quot; aramid). Unlike Kevlar, Nomex strands cannot align during filament polymerization and have less strength: its ultimate tensile strength is . However, it has excellent thermal, chemical, and radiation resistance for a polymer material. It can withstand temperatures of up to .

== Production ==
Nomex is produced by condensation reaction from the monomers &quot;m&quot;-phenylenediamine and isophthaloyl chloride.

It is sold in both fiber and sheet forms and is used as a fabric where resistance from heat and flame is required. Nomex sheet is actually a calendered paper and made in a similar fashion. Nomex Type 410 paper was the first Nomex paper developed and one of the higher volume grades made, mostly for electrical insulation purposes.

Wilfred Sweeny (1926–2011), the DuPont scientist responsible for discoveries leading to Nomex, earned a DuPont Lavoisier Medal in 2002 partly for this work.

== Applications ==
Nomex Paper is used in electrical laminates such as circuit boards and transformer cores as well as fireproof honeycomb structures where it is saturated with a phenolic resin. Honeycomb structures such as these, as well as mylar-Nomex laminates, are used extensively in aircraft construction. Firefighting, military aviation, and vehicle racing industries use Nomex to create clothing and equipment that can withstand intense heat.

A Nomex hood is a common piece of racing and firefighting equipment. It is placed on the head on top of a firefighter&#x27;s face mask. The hood protects the portions of the head not covered by the helmet and face mask from the intense heat of the fire.

Wildland firefighters wear Nomex shirts and trousers as part of their personal protective equipment during wildfire suppression activities.
Racing car drivers wear driving suits constructed of Nomex and or other fire retardant materials, along with Nomex gloves, long underwear, balaclavas, socks, helmet lining and shoes, to protect them in the event of a fire.

Military pilots and aircrew wear flight suits made of over 92 percent Nomex to protect them from cockpit fires (previously issued flight suits were treated in borax solution prior to the introduction). It is also worn as sailors&#x27; anti-flash gear. Troops riding in ground vehicles often wear Nomex for fire protection. Kevlar thread is often used to hold the fabric together at seams.

Military tank drivers also typically use Nomex hoods as protection against fire.

In the U.S. space program, Nomex has been used for the Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment on the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (in conjunction with Kevlar and Gore-Tex) and ACES pressure suit, both for fire and extreme environment (water immersion to near vacuum) protection, and as thermal blankets on the payload bay doors, fuselage, and upper wing surfaces of the Space Shuttle Orbiter. It has also been used for the airbags for the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover missions , the Galileo atmospheric probe, the Cassini-Huygens Titan probe, as an external covering on the AERCam Sprint, and is planned to be incorporated into NASA&#x27;s upcoming Crew Exploration Vehicle.

Nomex has been used as an acoustic material in Troy, NY, at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute&#x27;s Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) main concert hall. A ceiling canopy of Nomex reflects high and mid frequency sound, providing reverberation, while letting lower frequency sound partially pass through the canopy. According to RPI President Shirley Ann Jackson, EMPAC is the first venue in the world to use Nomex as an architectural material for acoustic reasons.

Nomex (like Kevlar) is also used in the production of loudspeaker drivers.

Honeycomb-structured Nomex paper is used as a spacer between layers of lead in the ATLAS Liquid Argon Calorimeter, and as a laminate core for hull and deck construction in custom boats such as Stiletto Catamarans like the Stiletto 27.

Nomex is used in industrial applications as a filter in exhaust filtration systems, typically a baghouse, that deal with hot gas emissions found in asphalt plants, cement plants, steel smelting facilities, and non-ferrous metal production facilities.

Nomex is used in some classical guitar tops in order to create a &#x27;composite&#x27; soundboard. When Nomex is laminated between 2 spruce or cedar &#x27;skins&#x27;, a rigid and lightweight plate is produced, which can improve the efficiency of the soundboard. While the &#x27;laminated&#x27; technique was created by Matthias Dammann, the use of Nomex within was first employed by luthier Gernot Wagner.

== History ==
The deaths in fiery crashes of race car drivers Fireball Roberts at Charlotte, and Eddie Sachs and Dave MacDonald at Indianapolis in 1964, led to the use of flame-resistant fabrics such as Nomex. In early 1966 &quot;Competition Press and Autoweek&quot; reported: &quot;During the past season, experimental driving suits were worn by Walt Hansgen, Masten Gregory, Marvin Panch and Group 44&#x27;s Bob Tullius; these four representing a fairly good cross section in the sport. The goal was to get use-test information on the comfort and laundering characteristics of Nomex. The Chrysler-Plymouth team at the recent Motor Trend 500 at Riverside also wore these suits.&quot;

==Etymology==

The word &quot;Mannargudi&quot; is derived from the Tamil word &quot;Mannar&quot; referring to Vishnu and &quot;gudi&quot; referring to a place, meaning the &quot;Place of Vishnu&quot;. The town was also called &quot;Mannarkovil&quot; or &quot;Rajamannarkoil&quot; after the Rajagopalaswamy temple. The town is locally referred as &quot;Mannai&quot;. Hindus refer the place as &quot;Dakshina Dwarka&quot;, meaning Southern Dwarka. The town was known during the period of Nayaks for the tall compound wall around the Rajagopalaswamy temple, leading to the adage &quot;Mannargudi Mathil Azhagu&quot;, (meaning &quot;the walls of Mannargudi are beautiful&quot;). The town is also called &quot;Koil mattrum Madil Nagaram&quot; referring to the compound wall around the temple.

==History==

Mannargudi was founded as an &quot;agraharam&quot; village during 7th century. After that Rajadhiraja Chaturvedimangalam by the Medieval Chola king Rajadhiraja Chola (1018–1054 CE), who constructed the Jayam Kondanathar temple and the Rajathirajeswara temple. The Rajagopalaswami temple is believed to have been constructed by Kulothunga Chola I (1070–1125 CE), with bricks and mortar, indicated by various stone inscriptions found at the site. The town started to grow around the temple. Successive kings of the Chola empire, Rajaraja Chola III (1216–56 CE) and Rajendra Chola III (1246–79 CE), and Thanjavur Nayak king Achyuta Deva Raya (1529–1542 CE) expanded the temple. The temple contains inscriptions of the Hoysala kings and information about grants by Vijayanagara kings, and many records of the later Nayaks and Marathas. A fort was constructed under the rule of the Hoysala kings, and Hindu temples were built under the leadership of both Hoysala and Pandya rulers.

Mannargudi was conquered by the Delhi Sultanate in 1311 CE. Following brief occupations by the Madurai Sultanate and the Hoysalas, it became a part of the Vijayanagar Empire. After the decline of Vijayanagar Empire, Mannargudi was ruled by the Thanjavur Nayaks. The Thanjavur Nayaks made the temple as their dynastic and primary shrine and made significant additions. The current temple structure, hall of thousand pillars, main &quot;gopuram&quot; (temple gateway tower) and the big compound wall around the temple were built by the king Vijaya Raghava Nayak (1532–1575 CE). &quot;Raghunathabhyudayam&quot;, a doctrine by Nayaks explains the donation of an armour studded with precious stones to the main deity of the temple by the king. It is believed Vijaya Raghava Nayak erected the large tower in front of the temple so that he could view the Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple. He was also called &quot;Mannarudasan&quot; as he carried out extensive renovations of the Rajagopalaswami temple complex and is credited by some to have reclaimed the land from the surrounding forest.

The Thanjavur Marathas gained control during the later part of 18th century until its annexation by the British East India Company in 1799. It was constituted as a municipality during 1866 and was a part of the erstwhile Tanjore district. The town was the headquarters and the only town in Mannargudi taluk. The town emerged as one of the chief centres of inland trade in the district during the British rule. Rice, betel leaves, groundnut, oil, metal articles and clothes were the major exports. A Methodist mission was established in the town during the third decade of the 19th century. During 1944, Chinese copper coins were unearthed from Thaliketti village in the region, dated to Sui period (585 CE) to the end of Song period (1275 CE). The coins indicate a possible Buddhist influence in the region. Mannargudi continued to be part of Tanjore district until India&#x27;s independence in 1947 and Thanjavur district until 1991 and subsequently a part of the newly formed Tiruvarur district.

<doc id="965902" wikidata="Q746547" url="?curid=965902" title="Road to Ruin (Ramones album)">
<text>Road to Ruin is the fourth studio album by the American punk rock band Ramones, released on September 22, 1978, through Sire Records as LP record, 8 track cartridge &amp; audio cassette. It was the first Ramones album to feature new drummer Marky Ramone, who replaced Tommy Ramone. Tommy left the band due to low sales of previous albums as well as stress he experienced while touring; however, he stayed with the band to produce the album (credited as T. Erdelyi) with Ed Stasium. The artwork&#x27;s concept was designed by Ramones fan Gus MacDonald and later modified by John Holmstrom to include Marky instead of Tommy.

The album incorporated musical elements that were less prominent in punk rock, such as heavy metal-influenced guitar solos and 1960s-style ballads. The songs on &quot;Road to Ruin&quot; are considered by some as an attempt to get the band more airplay. The album did not sell as well as the band had hoped, peaking at number 103 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, more than 50 places behind its predecessor, &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;. However, &quot;Road to Ruin&quot; lives on decades later as a fan favorite. &quot;I Wanna Be Sedated&quot;, which had a successful music video produced almost a decade after its release, has since become one of the band&#x27;s most well-known tracks, as well as their second most-streamed track on Spotify after &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;. The album has had multiple re-releases with new work from producer Ed Stasium.

==Conception==
After the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; saw poor album sales, drummer Tommy Ramone left his performing position to focus primarily on producing for the band. After Tommy suggested they search for a new drummer, they began looking in New York City based clubs. While at CBGBs, Ramones bassist Dee Dee Ramone approached Marc Bell (Marky Ramone) – who was his friend and had previously been the drummer in Richard Hell and the Voidoids – asking him if he was interested in joining the Ramones. A month after this encounter, manager Danny Fields formally asked Marky to audition for the band. Around twenty others auditioned to be the drummer, though Johnny, Joey and Dee Dee wanted to hire Marky after his performances of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot; and &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot;. Marky stayed close to Tommy&#x27;s straightforward technique, with a bit more technical sophistication.

Three weeks after Marky joined the band, the Ramones began recording &quot;Road to Ruin&quot; in Midtown Manhattan at Mediasound Studios, the premises of a former Episcopalian Church. Album engineer Ed Stasium explained the recording process: &quot;After Tommy left the band, we went straight into working on the &quot;Road to Ruin&quot; album with Marky Ramone. We rehearsed with Marky, just getting it down. Then we went into the studio, recorded, and mixed the record at Media Sound. We spent a lot of money, and the entire summer, on &quot;Road to Ruin&quot;.&quot; Music critic John Young of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album&#x27;s production &quot;clean and simple&quot;, but pointed out that the track &quot;Bad Brain&quot; contained &quot;funny noises&quot; suggested by the producers in between drum beats, which prevents the song from having the humorous asperity that was intended.

The artwork&#x27;s concept was originated by Ramones fan Gus MacDonald, who illustrated the members performing with a lobster claw coming out of an amplifier and a snake around their feet. Following the drawing&#x27;s completion, MacDonald sent it to the band and they decided to make it their &quot;Road to Ruin&quot; album cover. This sketch did, however, include original drummer Tommy, so the drawing had to be modified to depict Marky instead. This alteration was undertaken by artist John Holmstrom, a &quot;Punk&quot; magazine associate and designer.

==Lyrics and composition==
The album introduced some characteristics that were new to Ramones records, such as guitar solos, acoustic rhythm guitars, and ballads. These attributes were debated by the band&#x27;s fans as well as critics, who questioned whether these changes sought to expand their musical fashion or the band was simply selling out and abandoning their punk-rock edge. Though &quot;Bad Brain&quot;, &quot;I Wanted Everything&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Against It&quot; each serves as basic punk songs to intensify the behavior of the audience, the most popular tracks on the album are the pieces which part from their initial style. &quot;Bad Brain&quot; would inspire the name of the pioneering hardcore band.

Tommy Ramone said of the album&#x27;s content:

The album opens with the midtempo piece &quot;I Just Want to Have Something to Do&quot;, which contains lyrics pertaining to ambivalence and anomie. In the song, Joey manages to rhyme &quot;Second Avenue&quot; with &quot;chicken vindaloo&quot;. The next track, &quot;I Wanted Everything&quot;, is compared to Merle Haggard&#x27;s song &quot;If We Make It Through December&quot;, being called its &quot;punk counterpart&quot; by &quot;Rock: A Canadian Perspective&quot; author Larry Starr. &quot;Questioningly&quot; is a ballad focusing on failing relationships and heartbreak. &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Close&quot; uses elements that can also be heard in country music, such as twang.

&quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot; suggests that the band will continue making records, while &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; is a cover. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Charles Young noted that the song could have easily been a joke, but was not since Joey &quot;really puts his guts into these antiquated but beautiful lyrics and pulls it off.&quot; &quot;I Wanna Be Sedated&quot; was written by Joey while in the hospital where he was treated for burns on his face and in his throat. The injury was the result of an exploding kettle full of boiling water which served to treat sinuses. The album concludes with &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way Back&quot;, which was written by Dee Dee and depicts his childhood in Germany.

==Release==
With the band&#x27;s slight change in musical style, material included on the album was intended to gain a sense of mainstream acceptance, though the band members felt that this was not achieved. Tommy relates: &quot;&quot;Road to Ruin&quot; was a flop Stateside, even though it had been a very deliberate attempt to secure American radioplay.&quot; The album&#x27;s lack of commercial success showed for a negative impact on the members&#x27; morale, and this exasperation would continue into the band&#x27;s future records and tours. On the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;Road to Ruin&quot; peaked at number 103, while on the UK Albums Chart it reached 32. The album also debuted at 25 on the Swedish Sverigetopplistan chart. The drive to sell more albums in the United States failed, which is evident when comparing the charting positions to &quot;Road to Ruin&quot;″s predecessor &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;, which peaked at 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Reception==
Initially, &quot;Road to Ruin&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Roy Trakin of the &quot;New York Rocker&quot; called the album &quot;uneven&quot; and &quot;sometimes lazy&quot;, and preferred Tommy&#x27;s drumming style over Marky&#x27;s, writing: &quot;...his light, distinctive, jazz-influenced drumming is sorely missed on &quot;Road to Ruin&quot; as Marky is of the heads-down basher school.&quot; Jon Savage of &quot;Sounds&quot; felt that the Ramones&#x27; music had become formulaic and accused the band of &quot;calculated negativity&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Charles M. Young found the album to be neither as humorous nor as innovative as the Ramones&#x27; debut, but noted that the band was not at all &quot;losing its grip&quot;. He observed that the band had modified their style because &quot;dumb&quot; people did not understand the music, while &quot;smart&quot; people did. Young cited &quot;I Wanna Be Sedated&quot; as the album&#x27;s &quot;killer cut&quot;, comparing it to &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;, &quot;Loudmouth&quot;, and &quot;Cretin Hop&quot;. In a highly positive review, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau wrote that the band was constantly &quot;topping itself&quot;, and implied that each track on the album was very listenable except &quot;Bad Brain&quot;, the theme of which he called &quot;repetitious&quot;.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said of &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Close&quot; that &quot;the production values emphasize clear guitar lines&quot; and &quot;Joey&#x27;s lead vocals are effective and reminiscent of early British rockers.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; called it &quot;a fine pop outing&quot; and said that &quot;The vocals are familiar but the mid-&#x27;60s English rock beat and instrumentation have a smoother and finer edge.&quot;

Critical acclaim for &quot;Road to Ruin&quot; did not fully transpire until decades after its release. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine found that the album does not reach the quality of the Ramones&#x27; previous albums, taking issue with its &quot;undistinguished&quot; songs, but the music nonetheless &quot;sounds good&quot; despite lacking in &quot;exuberant energy or abundant hooks&quot;. In a later retrospective review for AllMusic, Tim Sendra was more enthusiastic, writing that the more elaborate arrangements &quot;worked well with the more diverse songs the band brought to the album&quot;.

The album is popular among the band&#x27;s work today, often considered a fan favorite. In 2014 the album was voted their third best in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; top 10 article.

The hardcore punk band Bad Brains took their name from the song &quot;Bad Brain&quot;. The title of Supergrass&#x27; 2005 album &quot;Road to Rouen&quot; is a reference to &quot;Road to Ruin&quot;.

<doc id="965906" wikidata="Q1986262" url="?curid=965906" title="Du Pont family">
<text>The du Pont family () or Du Pont family is a prominent American family descended from Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours (1739–1817), a French minor aristocrat. It has been one of the richest families in the United States since the mid-19th century, when it founded its fortune in the gunpowder business. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it expanded its wealth through the chemical industry and the automotive industry, with substantial interests in the DuPont company, General Motors, and various other corporations.

Several former du Pont family estates are open to the public as museums, gardens or parks, such as Winterthur, Nemours, Eleutherian Mills, Longwood Gardens, Gibraltar, Mt. Cuba, and Goodstay. The family&#x27;s interest in horticulture was brought to the United States by their immigrant progenitors from France and reinforced in later generations by avid gardeners who married into the family. As early as 1924, the du Ponts were recognized by Charles Sprague Sargent, the famed plantsman and director of Harvard&#x27;s Arnold Arboretum, as &quot;a family which has made the neighborhood of Wilmington, Delaware one of the chief centers of horticulture in the United States.&quot;

The family&#x27;s first American estate, Eleutherian Mills, located at Hagley Museum and Library, was preserved and restored by Louise E. du Pont Crowninshield. She also helped to establish the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1949. In recent years, the family has continued to be known for its association with political and business ventures, as well as philanthropic causes.

Two family members were the subjects of well-publicized criminal cases. John Eleuthère du Pont was convicted of murdering wrestling coach Dave Schultz.

As of 2016, the family fortune was estimated at $14.3 billion, spread across more than 3,500 living relatives.

==History==

Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours was the son of a Parisian watchmaker and a member of a Burgundian Huguenot family. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was a descendant of a minor noble family. In 1800, he and his sons, Victor Marie du Pont and Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, migrated from France to the United States. He used the resources of their Huguenot heritage to found one of the most prominent of American families, and one of its most successful corporations, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, initially established by Éleuthère Irénée as a gunpowder manufacturer.

In 1802, Éleuthère Irénée du Pont established a gunpowder mill on the banks of the Brandywine River near Wilmington, Delaware. The location, named Eleutherian Mills, provided all the necessities to operate the mill: a water flow sufficient to power it, available timber (mainly willow trees) that could be turned into charcoal fine enough to use for gunpowder, and close proximity to the Delaware River to allow for shipments of sulfur and saltpeter, the other ingredients used in the manufacture of gunpowder. There were also nearby stone quarries to provide needed building materials.

Over time, the Du Pont company grew into the largest black powder manufacturing firm in the world. The family remained in control of the company up to the 1960s, and family trusts still own a substantial amount of the company&#x27;s stock. This and other companies run by the du Pont family employed up to 10 percent of Delaware&#x27;s population at its peak. In the 19th century, the Du Pont family maintained their family wealth by carefully arranged marriages between cousins which, at the time, was the norm for many families.

The family played a large part in politics during the 18th and 19th centuries and assisted in negotiations for the Treaty of Paris and the Louisiana Purchase. Both T. Coleman and Henry A. du Pont served as U.S. senators. Pierre S. du Pont, IV served as Governor of Delaware.

The family has played an important role in historic preservation and land conservation, including helping to found the National Trust for Historic Preservation, preserving President James Madison&#x27;s home Montpelier, and establishing numerous museums such as Winterthur and the Delaware Museum of Natural History. The Brandywine Conservancy, founded by family member George Alexis Weymouth, owns around of land in Pennsylvania and Delaware, and owns permanent conservation easements on an additional . In 2013, Lammot du Pont Copeland&#x27;s Mt. Cuba Center contributed over $20 million to purchase land for donation to the federal government, to form the First State National Historical Park.

Beginning with William du Pont, Jr. and his sister, Marion duPont Scott, many members of the Du Pont family have been involved in the breeding and racing of Thoroughbred racehorses, as well as establishing racehorse venues and training tracks, including Delaware Park and Fair Hill, Maryland. While most Du Ponts are members of the Episcopal Church, Éleuthère Irénée du Pont was a Huguenot.

==Spelling of the name==
The stylings &quot;du Pont&quot; and &quot;Du Pont&quot; are most prevalent for the family name in published, copy-edited writings. In many publications, the styling is &quot;du Pont&quot; when quoting an individual&#x27;s full name and &quot;Du Pont&quot; when speaking of the family as a whole. Some individual Du Ponts have chosen to style it differently, such as Samuel Francis Du Pont. The name of the chemical company founded by the family is today styled solid as &quot;DuPont&quot; in the short form. The long form is styled as E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. The stylings &quot;Du Pont&quot; and &quot;DuPont&quot; for the company&#x27;s short name coexisted in the 20th century, but the latter is now consistently used in the company&#x27;s branding. 

The solid styling &quot;duPont&quot; is less common. The Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children uses it, as does the duPont Registry. William S. Dutton&#x27;s mid-20th-century history of the family business uses &quot;Du Pont&quot; both for the family mentioned generally and for the company&#x27;s short name, but &quot;du Pont&quot; in an individual&#x27;s full name, for example, &quot;Éleuthère Irénée du Pont&quot;, &quot;Henry du Pont&quot;, &quot;Alfred Victor du Pont&quot;, &quot;Lammot du Pont&quot;. For example, &quot;when he [Lammot du Pont] went to General Henry du Pont with the proposal that the Du Ponts manufacture dynamite, he was answered by a blunt and unqualified &#x27;No!&#x27;&quot;) 

The first page of Dutton&#x27;s monograph contains the following footnote about the surname&#x27;s styling. The mention of &quot;Samuel Dupont&quot; here refers to the 18th-century Parisian watchmaker, not to his 19th-century descendant: &quot;Samuel Dupont used this form of the family name [i.e., Dupont], but beginning in 1763 his son signed himself &#x27;Du Pont.&#x27; Later, he added &#x27;de Nemours&#x27; to his name to prevent confusion with two other Duponts in the French Chamber of Deputies. Du Pont, in English, is pronounced with the accent on the second syllable. In French, neither syllable is accented.&quot; 

French orthographic tradition for the styling of &quot;de&quot;, or its inflected forms, as a surname particle, in either nobiliary or non-nobiliary form, is discussed at &quot;Nobiliary particle § France&quot;. In non-nobiliary form, the prevalent French styling of the name is &quot;&quot;. Thus the choice by Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours to begin styling himself so during the monarchical era, hints at social ambition. Today the influence of French orthography and prerevolutionary class structure on how English orthography styles surnames today, is outweighed by how families and individuals so named, style themselves.

<text>A neume (; sometimes spelled neum) is the basic element of Western and some Eastern systems of musical notation prior to the invention of five-line staff notation.

The earliest neumes were inflective marks that indicated the general shape but not necessarily the exact notes or rhythms to be sung. Later developments included the use of heightened neumes that showed the relative pitches between neumes, and the creation of a four-line musical staff that identified particular pitches. Neumes do not generally indicate rhythm, but additional symbols were sometimes juxtaposed with neumes to indicate changes in articulation, duration, or tempo. Neumatic notation was later used in medieval music to indicate certain patterns of rhythm called rhythmic modes, and eventually evolved into modern musical notation. Neumatic notation remains standard in modern editions of plainchant.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;neume&quot; entered the English language in the Middle English forms , , in the 15th century, from the Middle French , in turn from either medieval Latin or , the former either from ancient Greek (&#x27;breath&#x27;) or (&quot;sign&quot;), or else directly from Greek as a corruption or an adaptation of the former.

==Early history==
Although chant was probably sung since the earliest days of the church, for centuries it was transmitted only orally.

The earliest known systems involving neumes are of Aramaic origin and were used to notate inflections in the quasi-emmelic (melodic) recitation of the Christian holy scriptures. As such they resemble functionally a similar system used for the notation of recitation of the Qur&#x27;an, the holy book of Islam. This early system was called &quot;ekphonetic notation&quot;, from the Greek ἐκφώνησις &quot;ekphonesis&quot; meaning quasi-melodic recitation of text.

Around the 9th century neumes began to become shorthand mnemonic aids for the proper melodic recitation of chant. A prevalent view is that neumatic notation was first developed in the Eastern Roman Empire. This seems plausible given the well-documented peak of musical composition and cultural activity in major cities of the empire (now regions of southern Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Israel) at that time. The corpus of extant Byzantine music in manuscript and printed form is far larger than that of the Gregorian chant, due in part to the fact that neumes fell into disuse in the west after the rise of modern staff notation and with it the new techniques of polyphonic music, while the Eastern tradition of Greek orthodox church music and the reformed neume notation remains alive today.

Slavic neume notations (&quot;Znamenny Chant&quot;) are on the whole even more difficult to decipher and transcribe than Byzantine or Gregorian neume notations.

==Western plainchant==
The earliest Western notation for chant appears in the 9th century. These early staffless neumes, called &quot;cheironomic&quot; or , appeared as freeform wavy lines above the text. Various scholars see these as deriving from cheironomic hand-gestures, from the ekphonetic notation of Byzantine chant, or from punctuation or accent marks. A single neume could represent a single pitch, or a series of pitches all sung on the same syllable. Cheironomic neumes indicated changes in pitch and duration within each syllable, but did not attempt to specify the pitches of individual notes, the intervals between pitches within a neume, or the relative starting pitches of different syllables&#x27; neumes.

There is evidence that the earliest Western musical notation, in the form of neumes (without staff-lines), was created at Metz around 800, as a result of Charlemagne&#x27;s desire for Frankish church musicians to retain the performance nuances used by the Roman singers.

Presumably these were intended only as mnemonics for melodies learned by ear. The earliest extant manuscripts (9th–10th centuries) of such neumes include:
* the abbey of St. Gall, in modern-day Switzerland
* Messine neumes (from the monastery of Metz in northeast France)
* Aquitanian neumes (southern France, also used in Spain)
* Laon, Chartres, Montpellier
In the early 11th century, Beneventan neumes (from the churches of Benevento in southern Italy) were written at varying distances from the text to indicate the overall shape of the melody; such neumes are called &quot;heightened&quot; or &quot;diastematic&quot; neumes, which showed the relative pitches between neumes. A few manuscripts from the same period use &quot;digraphic&quot; notation in which note names are included below the neumes. Shortly after this, one to four staff lines—an innovation traditionally ascribed to Guido d&#x27;Arezzo—clarified the exact relationship between pitches. One line was marked as representing a particular pitch, usually C or F. These neumes resembled the same thin, scripty style of the chironomic notation. By the 11th century, chironomic neumes had evolved into &quot;square notation&quot;; in Germany, a variant called Gothic neumes continued to be used until the 16th century. This variant is also known as &quot;Hufnagel notation&quot;, as the used neumes resemble the nails (Hufnägel) one uses to attach horseshoes.
By the 13th century, the neumes of Gregorian chant were usually written in &quot;square notation&quot; on a staff with four lines and three spaces and a clef marker, as in the 14th–15th century shown here. In square notation, small groups of ascending notes on a syllable are shown as stacked squares, read from bottom to top, while descending notes are written with diamonds read from left to right. In melismatic chants, in which a syllable may be sung to a large number of notes, a series of smaller such groups of neumes are written in succession, read from left to right. A special symbol called the , placed at the end of a system, showed which pitch came next at the start of the following system. Special neumes such as the , , and liquescent neumes, indicate particular vocal treatments for these notes. This system of square notation is standard in modern chantbooks.

==Solesmes notation==
Various manuscripts and printed editions of Gregorian chant, using varying styles of square-note neumes, circulated throughout the Catholic Church for centuries. Some editions added rhythmic patterns, or meter, to the chants. In the 19th century the monks of the Benedictine abbey of Solesmes, particularly Dom Joseph Pothier (1835–1923) and Dom André Mocquereau (1849–1930) collected facsimiles of the earliest manuscripts and published them in a series of 12 publications called . They also assembled definitive versions of many of the chants, and developed a standardized form of the square-note notation that was adopted by the Catholic Church and is still in use in publications such as the (although there are also published editions of this book in modern notation).

As a general rule, the notes of a single neume are never sung to more than one syllable; all three pitches of a three-note neume, for example, must all be sung on the same syllable. (This is not universally accepted; Richard Crocker has argued that in the special case of the early Aquitanian polyphony of the St. Martial school, neumes must have been &quot;broken&quot; between syllables to facilitate the coordination of parts.) However, a single syllable may be sung to so many notes that several neumes in succession are used to notate it. The single-note neumes indicate that only a single note corresponds to that syllable. Chants that primarily use single-note neumes are called &quot;syllabic&quot;; chants with typically one multi-note neume per syllable are called &quot;neumatic&quot;, and those with many neumes per syllable are called &quot;melismatic&quot;.

==Rhythmic interpretation==
The Solesmes monks also determined, based on their research, performance practice for Gregorian chant. Because of the ambiguity of medieval musical notation, the question of rhythm in Gregorian chant is contested by scholars. Some neumes, such as the &quot;pressus&quot;, do indicate the lengthening of notes. Common modern practice, following the Solesmes interpretation, is to perform Gregorian chant with no beat or regular metric accent, in which time is free, allowing the text to determine the accent and the melodic contour to determine phrasing. By the 13th century, with the widespread use of square notation, it is believed that most chant was sung with each note getting approximately an equal value, although Jerome of Moravia cites exceptions in which certain notes, such as the final notes of a chant, are lengthened.

The Solesmes school, represented by Dom Pothier and Dom Mocquereau, supports a rhythm of equal values per note, allowing for lengthening and shortening of note values for musical purposes. A second school of thought, including Wagner, Jammers, and Lipphardt, supports different rhythmic realizations of chant by imposing musical meter on the chant in various ways. Musicologist Gustave Reese said that the second group, called &quot;mensuralists&quot;, &quot;have an impressive amount of historical evidence on their side&quot; (&quot;Music in the Middle Ages&quot;, p. 146), but the equal-note Solesmes interpretation has permeated the musical world, apparently due to its ease of learning and resonance with modern musical taste.

==Illustrations==
Examples of neumes may be seen here: &quot;Basic &amp; Liquescent Aquitanian Neumes&quot; (archive from 10 June 2006, accessed 12 September 2014), , .

===Clefs===
Neumes are written on a four-line staff on the lines and spaces, unlike modern music notation, which uses five lines. Chant does not rely on any absolute pitch or key; the clefs are only to establish the half and whole steps of the hexachord: &quot;ut&quot;, &quot;re&quot;, &quot;mi&quot;, &quot;fa&quot;, &quot;sol&quot;, &quot;la&quot;. The clef bracketing a line indicates the location &quot;ut&quot; in the case of the C clef, or &quot;fa&quot; in the case of the F clef as shown:

===Single notes===
The virga and punctum are sung identically. Scholars disagree on whether the bipunctum indicates a note twice as long, or whether the same note should be re-articulated. When this latter interpretation is favoured, it may be called a &quot;repercussive neume&quot;.

===Two notes===
When two notes are one above the other, as in the podatus, the lower note is always sung first.

===Three notes===
The fact that the first two notes of the porrectus are connected as a diagonal rather than as individual notes seems to be a scribe&#x27;s shortcut.

===Compound neumes===
Several neumes in a row can be juxtaposed for a single syllable, but the following usages have specific names. These are only a few examples.

===Other basic markings===

===Interpretive marks===
The interpretation of these markings is the subject of great dispute among scholars.

Other interpretations of the quilisma:
* Shake or trill—William Mahrt of Stanford University supports this interpretation. This interpretation is also put into practice by the Washington Cappella Antiqua, under the direction of Patrick Jacobson.
* Quarter-tone or accidental. The support for this interpretation lies in some early digraphic manuscripts that combine chironomic neumes with letter-names. In places where other manuscripts have quilismas these digraphs often have a strange symbol in place of a letter, suggesting to some scholars the use of a pitch outside the solmization system represented by the letter names.

There are other uncommon neume shapes thought to indicate special types of vocal performance, though their precise meaning is a matter of debate:
*The trigon. The orthodox Solesme interpretation of this obscure three-note neume is a unison plus a third below, but there are other possibilities. It appears to have originated at St. Gall, though it is also widespread in French chant sources from the 10th and 11th centuries. It has been proposed that it may have a microtonal meaning, but there is &quot;an admitted lack of conclusiveness in the arguments in favor of notes smaller than a semitone.&quot;
* The distropha and tristropha are groups of two and three apostrophes, usually of the same pitch. They probably differed from normal repeated notes (virgae or puncta) in the way they were sung. Although there is some doubt on the matter, most modern writers accept Aurelian of Réôme&#x27;s description of a staccato reiteration.
* The oriscus is a single-note neume, usually found added as an auxiliary note to another neume. The name may derive from either the Greek &quot;horos&quot; (limit) or &quot;ōriskos&quot; (little hill). Its intended manner of performance is not clear. Although a microtonal interpretation has been suggested, there is possible contradicting evidence in the Dijon tonary, Montpellier H. 159.
* The pressus is a compound neume, usually involving an initial neume followed by an oriscus and a punctum. The initial neume may be a virga (in which case the virga + oriscus may be together called a &quot;virga strata&quot;), in which case the pressus indicates three notes; if the initial neume is a pes, then the compound indicates a four-note group. Just as with the oriscus itself, the interpretation is unsure. When chant came to be notated on a staff, the oriscus was normally represented as having the same pitch as the immediately preceding note.
There are also &quot;litterae significativae&quot; in many manuscripts, usually interpreted to indicate variations in tempo, e.g. c = &quot;celeriter&quot; (fast), t = &quot;tenete&quot; (hold) (an early form of the tenuto), a = &quot;auge&quot; (lengthen, as in a tie). The Solesmes editions omit all such letters.

==Other functions==
Neumes were used for notating other kinds of melody than plainchant, including troubadour and trouvère melodies, monophonic versus and conductus, and the individual lines of polyphonic songs. In some traditions, such as the Notre Dame school of polyphony, certain patterns of neumes were used to represent particular rhythmic patterns called rhythmic modes.

==Other types==
* Ekphonetic neumes annotating the melodic recitation of (Christian) holy scriptures.
* Neumes of Byzantine music – in several stages, old Byzantine, middle Byzantine, late Byzantine and post-Byzantine, and neo-Byzantine (reformed).
* Neumes of Slavic chant (Slavic neumes or &quot;Znamenny Chant&quot;).
* Mozarabic or Hispanic neumes (Spain), also called Visigothic script. These neumes have not been deciphered, but the Mozarabic liturgy varies somewhat from the Roman rite.
* Catalan notation.
* Daseian notation – an early form of Western music notation used in 9th and 10th-century music theory treatises.
* Buddhist chant uses a type of neume.

==Digital notation==
Because notation software usually focuses on modern European music notation, software that allows the user to use neumes is rare.
* Gregorio is a software especially written for that purpose. With its own GABC-Syntax and together with LuaTeX it provides high quality output of square notation neumes and also St. Gall neumes.
* Finale can be enhanced with Medieval 2, a third-party package devoted to early music and especially neumes.
* Lilypond is able to produce output using neumes.
* Some open fonts for neumes are available, which can be used by common office software or scorewriters.

<text>Pagham is a coastal village, Anglican parish and civil parish in the Arun district of West Sussex, England, with a population of around 6,100. It lies about two miles to the west of Bognor Regis.

==Demography==
Pagham is part of the electoral ward called Pagham and Rose Green. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 7,538.

The village can be divided into three contiguous neighbourhoods (merging seamlessly as one clustered village):
*Pagham Beach, coastal area, developed in the early 20th century,
*Pagham, the original 13th-century village
*Nyetimber, originally a separate village but has now been subsumed as part of a Local Authority rationalisation and the growth of the area.

==History==
Pagham was a significant settlement at the time of the Domesday survey of 1086 with 154 households.

In 1861 the parish, which is in the Diocese of Chichester, extended to , with a population of 988.

==Landmarks==

The Site of Special Scientific Interest known as Pagham Harbour is to the southwest; almost one quarter of the area falls within the parish. The harbour and surrounding land is of national importance for both flora and fauna. The shingle spit is of geological interest.

A Phoenix breakwater, a concrete caisson that was intended to be part of a World War II Mulberry Harbour, is visible in the bay at low tides.

==Buildings and facilities==
Many of the original Pagham Beach dwellings are bungalows constructed from old railway carriages - most of these have been later rebuilt using sturdier construction methods.

The parish church of St Thomas à Becket is a Grade I listed building; it contains three 1911 windows by the leading painter and designer Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne, which were restored in 2011.
Pagham is home to ale and beer pubs &#x27;The Lamb&#x27;, &#x27;The Lion&#x27; and &#x27;The Bear&#x27; as well as the &#x27;Inglenook Hotel&#x27;.

==Sport and leisure==

Pagham has a Non-League football club Pagham F.C. who play at Nyetimber Lane. The village has a cricket team, who play at the cricket ground at Nyetimber Lane. Sussex County Cricket Club played two first-class matches there in the 1970s.

Pagham is the home of the Pagham Pram Race which is the oldest pram race in the world. The race is run on Boxing day every year at 11am whatever the weather. Thousands of people line the streets of Pagham to watch the wacky contestants navigate the 3 mile course, drinking 3 pints of beer en route. All the money raised by the Pram Race is distributed to local good causes. The most successful fancy dress racer is Colin Cooper, who has won 3 best fancy dress awards alongside his teammates.

==Notable people==
James Byden, Joe Biden&#x27;s paternal fourth great-grandfather was christened at the church of St Thomas à Becket in Pagham, on November 15, 1767. He was the son of Richard Byden, Biden&#x27;s paternal fifth great-grandfather, and his wife Susan. The parish register notes that they were from Wymering where Richard appears to have been buried in 1808.

The motor racing drivers John Watson and Derek Bell lived in Pagham. Watson won five Formula One Grand Prix. Bell won the Le Mans 24 hour race five times.

<text>Charles Mayberry Kimbrough (May 23, 1936 – January 11, 2023) was an American actor. He was best known for his role as the straight-faced anchorman Jim Dial on &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. In 1990, his performance in the role earned him a nomination for an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series&quot;.

== Biography ==
Born in St. Paul, Minnesota, Kimbrough had extensive stage experience. He studied theater and drama at Indiana University Bloomington, and graduated in 1958. He earned a Masters of Fine Arts degree at Yale University&#x27;s School of Drama. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Kimbrough and his first wife Mary Jane Wilson were part of the resident company of the Milwaukee Repertory Theatre where they appeared in such plays as Georges Feydeau&#x27;s &quot;Cat Among the Pigeons&quot; and Jules Feiffer&#x27;s &quot;The White House Murder Case&quot;. In 1971, he was nominated for a Tony for best featured actor in a musical as Harry in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Company&quot;. In 1984, he performed in the original Broadway cast of Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;. He starred in the original Off-Broadway production of A.R. Gurney&#x27;s comedy &quot;Sylvia&quot; in 1995.

Around 1976 to 1977, he appeared in a Chef Boyardee Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs commercial.

In 1988, Kimbrough was cast as Jim Dial, a veteran network news anchor with the integrity and experience of an Edward R. Murrow or Walter Cronkite, on the CBS sitcom &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. The series ran for 247 episodes over ten seasons, winning 17 Emmy Awards and three Golden Globes. Kimbrough was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1990.

In 1996, he voiced Victor, a gargoyle, in Disney&#x27;s animated feature &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, a role he reprised in its direct-to-video sequel, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame II&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot;.

Kimbrough was part of the cast of the Roundabout Theater Company&#x27;s 2012 Broadway revival of Mary Chase&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;Harvey&quot; playing William R. Chumley, M.D., with Jim Parsons in the lead as Elwood P. Dowd. The show ran from June 14 to August 5, 2012, at New York&#x27;s Studio 54 Theatre.

Kimbrough later reprised his role as Jim Dial in the 2018 revival of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
In 2002, Kimbrough married actress and fellow &quot;Company&quot; castmate Beth Howland, known for her television work as Vera Louise Gorman-Novak on the sitcom &quot;Alice&quot;. Howland died of lung cancer in December 2015 at the age of 74. Her death was not reported to the media until May 24, 2016.

Kimbrough&#x27;s son, John, founded, sang and played guitar for the St. Paul-based alternative rock band Walt Mink.

Kimbrough died in Culver City, California, on January 11, 2023, at the age of 86.

<doc id="965924" wikidata="Q1334343" url="?curid=965924" title="Roller (agricultural tool)">
<text>The roller is an agricultural tool used for flattening land or breaking up large clumps of soil, especially after ploughing or disc harrowing. Typically, rollers are pulled by tractors or, prior to mechanisation, a team of animals such as horses or oxen. As well as for agricultural purposes, rollers are used on cricket pitches and residential lawn areas.

Flatter land makes subsequent weed control and harvesting easier, and rolling can help to reduce moisture loss from cultivated soil. On lawns, rolling levels the land for mowing and compacts the soil surface.

Rollers may be weighted in different ways. For many uses a heavy roller is used. These may consist of one or more cylinders made of thick steel, a thinner steel cylinder filled with concrete, or a cylinder filled with water. A water-filled roller has the advantage that the water may be drained out for lighter use or for transport. In frost-prone areas a water filled roller must be drained for winter storage to avoid breakage due to the expansion for water as it turns to ice.

==Designs==


===One-piece versus segmented===
On tilled soil a one-piece roller has the disadvantage that when turning corners the outer end of the roller has to rotate much faster than the inner end, forcing one or both ends to skid. A one-piece roller turned on soft ground will skid up a heap of soil at the outer radius, leaving heaps, which is counter-productive. Rollers are often made in two or three sections to reduce this problem, and the Cambridge roller overcomes it altogether by mounting many small segments onto one axle so that they can each rotate at local ground-speed.

===Smooth versus ridged===
The surface of rollers may be smooth, or it may be textured to help break up soil or to groove the final surface to reduce scouring from rain. Each segment of a Cambridge roller has a rib around its edge for this purpose. The name cultipacker is often used for such ridged types, especially in the United States.

==Uses==
===Farming use===
Rollers are a secondary tillage tool used for flattening land or breaking up large clumps of soil, especially after ploughing or disc harrowing. Rollers are typically pulled by tractors today. Before mechanised agriculture, a team of working animals such as horses or oxen provided the power. Animal power is still used today in some contexts, such as on Amish farms in the United States and in regions of Asia where draft oxen are still widely used.

Rollers prepare optimal seedbeds by making them as flat as is practical and moderately firmed. Flatness is important at planting because it is the only practical way to control average seed planting depth without laborious hand planting of each seed; it is not practical to follow an instruction of (for example) 1-cm planting depth if the contour of the seedbed varies by 2 cm or more between adjacent spots. This is why breaking up of even small clods/lumps, and well-leveled spreading of soil, is important at planting time.

Flatter land also makes subsequent weed control and harvesting easier. For example, in mechanical weed control, controlling cultivator tooth depth is practical only with a decently flat soil contour, and in combining, controlling combine head height is practical only with a decently flat soil contour.

Rolling is also believed to help reduce moisture loss from cultivated soil.

====Ganging and trailing====
Rollers may be ganged to increase the width of each pass/swath. Rollers may be trailed after other equipment such as ploughs, disc harrows, or mowers.

===Cricket pitch use===
In cricket, rollers are used to make the pitch flat and less dangerous for batsmen.

Several size rollers have been used in the history of cricket, from light rollers that were used in the days of uncovered pitches and at some stages during the 1950s to make batting less easy, to the modern “heavy roller” universally used in top-class cricket today. Regulations permit a pitch only to be rolled at the commencement of each innings or day’s play, but this has still had a massive influence on the game by eliminating the shooters that were ubiquitous on all but light soils before heavy rollers were used. Heavy rollers have sometimes been criticised for making batting too easy and for reducing the rate at which pitches dry out after rain in the cool English climate.

=== Lawn use ===

Lawn rollers are designed to even out or firm up the lawn surface, especially in climates where heaving causes the lawn to be lumpy. Heaving may result when the ground freezes and thaws many times over winter. Where this occurs, gardeners are advised to give the lawn a light rolling with a lawn roller in the spring. Clay or wet soils should not be rolled as they become compacted.

<text>Meredith Leigh Monroe (born December 30, 1969) is an American actress best known for portraying Andie McPhee on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; from 1998 to 2003, her recurring role as Haley Hotchner on &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; and Carolyn Standall on &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Monroe was born on December 30, 1969, in Houston, Texas. Her parents divorced when she was two, and she was subsequently raised in Hinsdale, Illinois. She studied at Hinsdale Central High School and after graduating moved to New York to pursue a modeling career. In 1995, she appeared in a number of TV commercials and magazine advertisements for L&#x27;Oreal hair-care, Disney Resort, Huffy bicycles, Ford cars, and Mattel toys.

In 1996, Monroe made the transition into acting when she was cast as Tracy Dalken in ABC series &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;, which led to a small recurring role on &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; as Rachel, a pregnant teenager. This led to her being cast as a series regular on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; in the role of Andie. She was a series regular in seasons 2 and 3, appeared in several episodes at the beginning and end of season 4, and was a special guest star in the series finale in season 6 (though her scenes were cut from the televised episode, appearing only on the DVD extended-cut release).

She is also known for her role in &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; as Haley Hotchner, Aaron Hotchner&#x27;s wife. Monroe left the series after her character was murdered by a recurring villain, The Boston Reaper (C. Thomas Howell), in the 100th episode. In 2018, she joined the cast of &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot; in season two as Carolyn, the mother of Alex Standall.

<doc id="965929" wikidata="Q2379628" url="?curid=965929" title="Communication with submarines">
<text>Communication with submarines is a field within military communications that presents technical challenges and requires specialized technology. Because radio waves do not travel well through good electrical conductors like salt water, submerged submarines are cut off from radio communication with their command authorities at ordinary radio frequencies. Submarines can surface and raise an antenna above the sea level, or float a tethered buoy carrying an antenna, then use ordinary radio transmissions; however, this makes them vulnerable to detection by anti-submarine warfare forces. 

Early submarines during World War II mostly travelled on the surface because of their limited underwater speed and endurance, and dived mainly to evade immediate threats or for stealthy approach to their targets. During the Cold War, however, nuclear-powered submarines were developed that could stay submerged for months. 

In the event of a nuclear war, submerged ballistic missile submarines have to be ordered quickly to launch their missiles. Transmitting messages to these submarines is an active area of research. Very low frequency (VLF) radio waves can penetrate seawater just over one hundred feet (30 metres), and many navies use powerful shore VLF transmitters for submarine communications. A few nations have built transmitters which use extremely low frequency (ELF) radio waves, which can penetrate seawater to reach submarines at operating depths, but these require huge antennas. Other techniques that have been used include sonar and blue lasers.

== Acoustic transmission ==

Sound travels far in water, and underwater loudspeakers and hydrophones can cover quite a gap. Apparently, both the American (SOSUS) and the Russian navies have placed sonic communication equipment in the seabed of areas frequently travelled by their submarines and connected it by underwater communications cables to their land stations. If a submarine hides near such a device, it can stay in contact with its headquarters. An underwater telephone sometimes called Gertrude is also used to communicate with submersibles.

== Very low frequency ==
VLF radio waves (3–30 kHz) can penetrate seawater to a few tens of metres and a submarine at shallow depth can use them to communicate. A deeper vessel can use a buoy equipped with an antenna on a long cable. The buoy rises to a few metres below the surface, and may be small enough to remain undetected by enemy sonar and radar. However these depth requirements restrict submarines to short reception periods, and antisubmarine warfare technology may be capable of detecting the sub or antenna buoy at these shallow depths. 

Natural background noise increases as frequency decreases, so a lot of radiated power is required to overcome it. Worse, small antennas (relative to a wavelength) are inherently inefficient. This implies high transmitter powers and very large antennas covering square kilometres. This precludes submarines from transmitting VLF, but a relatively simple antenna (usually a long trailing wire) will suffice for reception. Hence, VLF is always one-way, from land to boat. If two-way communication is needed, the boat must ascend nearer to the surface and raise an antenna mast to communicate on higher frequencies, usually HF and above.

Because of the narrow bandwidths available, voice transmission is impossible; only slow data is supported. VLF data transmission rates are around 300 bits/sec, so data compression is essential.

Only a few countries operate VLF facilities for communicating with their submarines: Norway, France, United States, Russia, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Pakistan, and India.

== Extremely low frequency ==
Electromagnetic waves in the ELF and SLF frequency ranges (3–300 Hz) can penetrate seawater to depths of hundreds of metres, allowing signals to be sent to submarines at their operating depths. Building an ELF transmitter is a formidable challenge, as they have to work at incredibly long wavelengths: The U.S. Navy&#x27;s Project ELF system, which was a variant of a larger system proposed under codename Project Sanguine, operated at 76 hertz, and the Soviet/Russian system (called ZEVS) at 82 Hertz. The latter corresponds to a wavelength of 3,656.0 kilometres. That is more than a quarter of the Earth&#x27;s diameter. The usual half-wavelength dipole antenna cannot be feasibly constructed, as that would require a long antenna.

Instead, someone who wishes to construct such a facility has to find an area with very &quot;low&quot; ground conductivity (a requirement opposite to usual radio transmitter sites), bury two huge electrodes in the ground at different sites, and then feed lines to them from a station in the middle, in the form of wires on poles. Although other separations are possible, the distance used by the ZEVS transmitter located near Murmansk is . As the ground conductivity is poor, the current between the electrodes will penetrate deep into the Earth, essentially using a large part of the globe as an antenna. The antenna length in Republic, Michigan, was approximately . The antenna is very inefficient. To drive it, a dedicated power plant seems to be required, although the power emitted as radiation is only a few watts. Its transmission can be received virtually anywhere. A station in Antarctica at 78° S 167° W detected transmission when the Soviet Navy put their ZEVS antenna into operation.

Owing to the technical difficulty of building an ELF transmitter, the U.S., China, Russia, and India are the only nations known to have constructed ELF communication facilities:
* Until it was dismantled in late September 2004, the American &quot;Seafarer&quot;, later called &quot;Project ELF&quot; system (76 Hz), consisted of two antennas, located at Clam Lake, Wisconsin (since 1977), and at Republic, Michigan, in the Upper Peninsula (since 1980).
* The Russian antenna (&quot;ZEVS&quot;, 82 Hz) is installed at the Kola Peninsula, near Murmansk. It was noticed by the West in the early 1990s.
* The Indian Navy has an operational VLF communication facility at the INS Kattabomman naval base, to communicate with its Arihant class and Akula class submarines. Beginning in 2012, this facility was being upgraded to also transmit ELF communications.
* China on the other hand has recently constructed the world&#x27;s largest ELF facility – roughly the size of New York City – in order to communicate with its submarine forces without them having to surface.

=== ELF transmissions ===
The coding used for U.S. military ELF transmissions employed a Reed–Solomon error correction code using 64 symbols, each represented by a very long pseudo-random sequence. The entire transmission was then encrypted. The advantages of such a technique are that by correlating multiple transmissions, a message could be completed even with very low signal-to-noise ratios, and because only a very few pseudo-random sequences represented actual message characters, there was a very high probability that if a message was successfully received, it was a valid message (anti-spoofing).

The communication link is one-way. No submarine could have its own ELF transmitter on board, due to the sheer size of such a device. Attempts to design a transmitter which can be immersed in the sea or flown on an aircraft were soon abandoned.

Owing to the limited bandwidth, information can only be transmitted very slowly, on the order of a few characters per minute (see Shannon’s coding theorem). Thus it was only ever used by the US Navy to give instructions to establish another form of communication and it is reasonable to assume that the actual messages were mostly generic instructions or requests to establish a different form of two-way communication with the relevant authority.

== Standard radio technology ==
A surfaced submarine, or a submarine floating a tethered antenna buoy on the surface, can use ordinary radio communications. From the surface, submarines may use naval frequencies in the HF, VHF, and UHF bands, and transmit information via both voice and teleprinter modulation techniques. Where available, dedicated military communications satellite systems using line-of-sight frequencies are preferred for long distance communications, as HF are more likely to betray the location of the submarine. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s system is called &quot;Submarine Satellite Information Exchange Sub-System&quot; (SSIXS), a component of the &quot;Navy Ultra High Frequency Satellite Communications System&quot; (UHF SATCOM).

== Combining acoustic and radio transmissions ==
A recent technology developed by a team at MIT combines acoustic signals and radar to enable submerged submarines to communicate with airplanes. An underwater transmitter uses an acoustic speaker pointed upward to the surface. The transmitter sends multichannel sound signals, which travel as pressure waves. When these waves hit the surface, they cause tiny vibrations. Above the water, a radar, in the 300 GHz range, continuously bounces a radio signal off the water surface. When the surface vibrates slightly due to the sound signal, the radar can detect the vibrations, completing the signal&#x27;s journey from the underwater speaker to an in-air receiver. The technology is called TARF (Translational Acoustic-RF) communication since it uses a translation between acoustic and RF signals. While promising, this technology is still in its infancy and has only been successfully tested in relatively controlled environments with small, up to approximately 200 mm, surface ripples, while larger waves prevented successful data communication.

== Underwater modems ==

In April 2017, NATO&#x27;s Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation announced the approval of JANUS, a standardised protocol to transmit digital information underwater using acoustic sound (as modems with acoustic couplers did in order to make use of analogue telephone lines). Documented in STANAG 4748, it uses 900 Hz to 60 kHz frequencies at distances of up to . It is available for use with military and civilian, NATO and non-NATO devices; it was named after the Roman god of gateways, openings, etc.

== Blue lasers ==
In 2009, a US military report stated that &quot;Practical laser-based systems for deep depths were unavailable because lasers operating at the right colour with enough power efficiency to be used in satellites did not exist. DARPA is striving towards a blue laser efficient enough to make submarine laser communications at depth and speed a near-term reality. A recently demonstrated laser will be matched with a special optical filter to form the core of a communications system with a signal-to-noise ratio thousands of times better than other proposed laser systems. If DARPA can demonstrate such a system under realistic conditions, it would dramatically change how submarines can communicate and operate, thereby greatly enhancing mission effectiveness, for example, in anti-submarine warfare.&quot;

<doc id="965935" wikidata="Q223786" url="?curid=965935" title="January Jones">
<text>January Kristen Jones (born January 5, 1978) is an American actress. She is best known for playing Betty Draper in &quot;Mad Men&quot; (2007–2015), for which she was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She also portrayed Melissa Chartres in &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot; (2015–2018) and has starred in films such as &quot;American Wedding&quot; (2003), &quot;We Are Marshall&quot; (2006), &quot;The Boat That Rocked&quot; (2009), &quot;Unknown&quot; (2011), &quot;Seeking Justice&quot; (2011), and &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; (2011).

==Early life==
January Kristen Jones was born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, on January 5, 1978, the daughter of store manager Karen Cox and exercise physiologist Marvin Jones. She was named after January Wayne, a character in the 1973 Jacqueline Susann novel &quot;Once Is Not Enough&quot;. The names of her two sisters also start with the letter J, Jina and Jacey. In 1979, her family moved to Hecla, South Dakota, but moved back to Sioux Falls in 1996, where she graduated from Roosevelt High School.

==Career==
===Modeling===
Jones began her modeling career in New York at the age of 18, after a modeling scout expressed interest while she was in high school. She noted that modelling was not her passion and she never took it seriously. Her first agency claimed she owed them money when she decided to move to Los Angeles. Jones has modeled for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Versace, Clearasil and Kérastase. She has been on the covers of numerous international fashion magazines, including &quot;Interview&quot;, &quot;Allure&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;W&quot; in the United States; &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Tatler&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot; and &quot;Red&quot; in the United Kingdom; &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in Germany; &quot;Grazia&quot; in Italy; and &quot;Tu Style&quot; and &quot;GQ&quot; in Italy.

===Acting===

<doc id="965936" wikidata="Q7699980" url="?curid=965936" title="Tennesseans for Fair Taxation">
<text>Tennesseans for Fair Taxation (TFT) is a Tennessee political advocacy group advocating tax reform, particularly at the state level.

As a grassroots group of generally low and moderate income families, Tennesseans for Fair Taxation is allied with state public employee and schoolteacher groups, along with faith-based organizations and good government groups, in establishing a progressive, broad-based state income tax as part of a larger tax modernization package that would also repeal the food tax and reduce the sales tax. This group notes that Tennessee is shown by almost all objective measures to have one of the lowest per capita level of taxes of the fifty U.S. states but that the tax share is disproportionately placed upon poorer people. This is because the majority of state tax revenues in Tennessee are derived from a sales tax, which applies to food, clothing, furniture, car parts, and other necessities, but not private school tuition, real estate investments, attorney fees, or stocks and bonds (except for interest earned and dividends, which are taxed at 6 percent under the Hall income tax, Tennessee being the only state with this provision). In Tennessee, food for human consumption is taxed at 5.5% (This was lowered from 6 to 5.5% in January 2008) and most other items of commerce at 7%, with local jurisdictions empowered to add as much as another 2.75% to this, making the overall sales tax rate in many jurisdictions, including the major urban areas, 8.25% on food and 9.75% on other items.

==Argument==
The argument advanced by TFT is a twofold one. The first point is that Tennessee governmental services are as a whole inadequate, in large part due to an inadequate tax base and the heavy dependence on one revenue source. Because of the shift to a service-based economy, exacerbated by the growth of internet sales, the sales tax has been eroded over many years. The second is that the poor pay a share of tax that is out of proportion to their income, in that most poor people consume the entire amount of their income and are hence taxed upon all of it, whereas most wealthier people invest some or much of their income, or spend it on non-taxable items like private school tuition and accounting services, and hence are not taxed on it by the state. Therefore, the argument goes, the poor are disproportionately taxed by the existing Tennessee system.
A further point made is that due to the size and shape of Tennessee, and the location of its major population centers, half of the population of the state lives within 20 miles of at least one other state and that all of the population lives no more than 65 miles from at least one other state, and that all of the surrounding states have a lower overall sales tax rate than Tennessee, meaning that many Tennesseans tend to make many purchases, especially major ones, in surrounding states, with Tennessee receiving no revenue from such transactions whatever, in essence making Tennesseans major taxpayers in surrounding states.

TFT also made the point that even many affluent Tennesseans could benefit from the fact that state income taxes are deductible from for purposes of computing liability for federal income tax, whereas sales taxes (), were not. The Congress changed this in October 2004. However, since those who the sales tax impacts the most are the least likely to itemize, this recent change has little effect.

==Counter argument==
The counter-argument is made by groups such as Tennessee Tax Revolt First, that the &quot;overall&quot; burden of taxation imposed by all levels of government, including the federal government, shows that poorer Tennesseans, like poorer Americans in general, pay a lower share of their income in taxes overall than wealthy ones. They add that the portion of food purchased by persons using food stamps, which covers at least part of their groceries, is automatically tax-exempt. Further, they argue true &quot;fairness&quot; is epitomized by the sales tax, which is the only tax which directly affects persons who work in the so-called underground economy which is driven by cash. Hence it represents the only tax paid by undocumented aliens, drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes. Of course, people can also avoid the sales tax buy buying things under the table with cash. They further point out that Tennessee does impose a flat income tax of 6% on dividends and some interest, called the Hall income tax. This income tax was paid almost entirely by more affluent Tennesseans, since the first $1,250 of such income, and all such income from bank interest payments, is exempt. The Hall Tax was repealed on January 1, 2021.

==Goals==
TFT hopes to overcome the general resistance to a state income tax by showing that somewhere between two-thirds and four-fifths of all Tennessee residents would pay less tax by switching to an income-tax centered system of taxation. Their current literature suggests that the food tax could be completely repealed, the overall sales tax rate could be lowered to 5.75%, and more revenue still be generated by the state with the implementation of a modest income tax. Opponents argue that there would be no guarantee that the sales tax rates, once lowered, would not soon be raised again.

In addition to its long-term work to modernize Tennessee&#x27;s tax system, TFT has also worked on other initiatives that fit within its mission. Most recently, TFT has worked to close corporate tax loopholes by enacting combined reporting for business excise tax purposes. The business excise tax in Tennessee is a tax on business profits levied at 6.5% of net earnings. Tennessee currently uses separate reporting, which means each company files a separate tax return, even if that company is just a subsidiary of a larger parent company. This makes Tennessee vulnerable to a host of tax avoidance schemes such as Delaware Holding Companies and Captive REITs. Under combined reporting rules, as is used in 22 states currently, the parent company and all its related subsidiaries file a single, unified tax return, rendering the shifting of profits between affiliates meaningless, and thereby shutting down a host of tax loopholes at once.

<doc id="965937" wikidata="Q3403459" url="?curid=965937" title="Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment">
<text>The Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment (PWRR), also known as the Tigers, is the senior English line infantry regiment of the British Army, second in the line infantry order of precedence to the Royal Regiment of Scotland and part of the Queen&#x27;s Division.

==History==
The Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment was formed on 9 September 1992 by the amalgamation of the Queen&#x27;s Regiment and the Royal Hampshire Regiment and holds the earliest battle honour in the British Army (Tangier 1662–80). Through its ancestry via the Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment (West Surrey) (2nd Regiment of Foot), the PWRR is the most senior English line infantry regiment. The current regiment was named in honour of Diana, Princess of Wales.

Upon its creation, the Princess of Wales and the Queen of Denmark were Allied Colonels-in-Chief of the PWRR. When the Princess divorced the Prince of Wales, she resigned as Colonel-in-chief and the Queen of Denmark was appointed its Colonel-in-Chief.

The 1st Battalion served a seven-month tour of Iraq in 2004 with a second tour following in 2006, and finally a tour in 2009 where the battalion was split between Afghanistan and Iraq (last combat operation in Iraq). Many of the operations carried out by the battalion during the first tour were named after stations on the London Underground. Elements of 1 PWRR helped train the Iraqi National Army and oversaw the withdrawal of UK Forces from Basra. 1st Battalion was deployed to Afghanistan again in August 2011 to form the nucleus of the Police Mentoring Advisory Group (PMAG) with individual companies detached to other battlegroups around Helmand province. During this time in Afghanistan, 1st Battalion would also achieve the most recent case in history of a successful bayonet charge, when Corporal Sean Jones lead a successful charge during an ambush in the village of Kakaran, for which he was award the military cross. The 1st Battalion under Army 2020 will move from Paderborn, Germany to be stationed at Bulford Camp.

The regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion were based in Shackleton Barracks, Northern Ireland, the last resident battalion deployed in this role under Operation Banner. After two years at Alexander Barracks in Dhekelia in Cyprus, they moved to Woolwich Garrison, London, to take up a public duties role in August 2010, a role they performed for three years. 2nd Battalion deployed to Cyprus again in 2014. It remains one of the infantry units rotating between the UK and British Forces Cyprus. In August 2017, the battalion returned to the UK, based at Kendrew Barracks in Cottesmore, where they reconfigured two companies into a Light Mechanised Infantry force.

<text>Bromham is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Bedford in Bedfordshire, England, situated around west of Bedford town centre.

==Name==
Bromham (Bruneham in Domesday) is probably the enclosed meadow on which the broom or the dyers&#x27; weed grew (at present no such flora can be found at that location).

Another theory as to the origin of the village&#x27;s name is Bruna&#x27;s homestead and was first recorded as Bruneham in the Domesday Book of 1086. Other variants including Bruham (1164–1302), Braham (1227), Bramham (1228), Brumham (1262–87), Brunham (1276–91), Brumbham (1276), Brynham (1276), Broham (1278), Bronham (1338), Broam (1360), Brounham (1361) and Burnham (1361). The modern spelling is first recorded in 1227.

==History==
The land formed part of the Barony of Bedford held by the Beauchamps. After the Battle of Evesham, in which John de Beauchamp fell fighting on the side of the barons, the manor was held for a time by Prince Edward, but afterward divided among the Beauchamp female heirs. Bromham afterward passed successively into the hands of the Mowbrays, the Latimers, the Nevilles, the Passelowes, the Wildes and the Dyves. Early in the 18th century, the manor was bought by Sir Thomas Trevor, who was afterward created Lord Trevor, and whose mother was a daughter of John Hampden, the patriot. Three of his sons succeeded to the title. One of them – the third Lord Trevor – married Sir Richard Steele&#x27;s (Dick Steele) daughter; and another – the fourth Lord Trevor – inherited the Great Hampden Estate in Bucks, through his grandmother, and was created Viscount Hampden. The Trevors became connected through marriage with the Rice family (the Dynevor Rices) and at the death of the late Miss Rice Trevor the estate passed to the Wingfields.

== Social ==
Bromham plays host to several social events through the year, Bromfest, The Duck Race and many other well organised events.

==Notable features==
It has a number of notable features including a flour watermill (Bromham Mill, now open to the public), the Church of St Owen, and a medieval bridge over the River Great Ouse that, until 1986, carried the main A428 road over the river on 26 arches.

The watermill is referred to in the Domesday Book of 1086 and the Vikings navigated the Great Ouse a long time ago. The mill was extensively restored in 1980 by Warwickshire millwrights Gormley and Goodman to the extent that it was able to grind wheat for flour again for the first time that year since it ceased work in 1939. Alterations to the weir below the mill&#x27;s leat shortly afterwards caused a reduction to the height of the head-race, resulting in poorer performance from the mill&#x27;s impulse water-wheel.

==Location==
The parish is for the greater part enclosed in a bend in the Great Ouse, and it touches the parishes of Oakley, Biddenham, Kempston, Stagsden, Stevington and at its western point, Turvey. It is to the west of Bedford.

<text>PEN International (known as International PEN until 2010) is a worldwide association of writers, founded in London in 1921 to promote friendship and intellectual co-operation among writers everywhere. The association has autonomous International PEN centres in more than 100 countries.

Other goals included: to emphasise the role of literature in the development of mutual understanding and world culture; to fight for freedom of expression; and to act as a powerful voice on behalf of writers harassed, imprisoned and sometimes killed for their views.

==History==
The first PEN Club was founded at the Florence Restaurant in London on October 5, 1921, by Catherine Amy Dawson Scott, with John Galsworthy as its first president. Its first members included Joseph Conrad, Elizabeth Craig, George Bernard Shaw, and H. G. Wells.

PEN originally stood for &quot;Poets, Essayists, Novelists&quot;, but now stands for &quot;Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, Novelists&quot; and includes writers of any form of literature, such as journalists and historians.

The club established these aims:
#To promote intellectual co-operation and understanding among writers;
#To create a world community of writers that would emphasize the central role of literature in the development of world culture; and,
#To defend literature against the many threats to its survival which the modern world poses.

The president of PEN International is Burhan Sönmez. Past presidents since Galsworthy have included E. M. Forster, Alberto Moravia, Heinrich Böll, Arthur Miller, Mario Vargas Llosa, Homero Aridjis, Jiří Gruša, John Ralston Saul and Jennifer Clement.

==Structure and status==
PEN International has its headquarters in London and is composed of autonomous PEN Centres in more than 100 countries around the world, each of which is open to writers, journalists, translators, historians and others actively engaged in any branch of literature.

It is a non-governmental organization in formal consultative relations with UNESCO and Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.

==Charter==
PEN summarises its Charter, based on resolutions passed at its International Congresses:
==Writers in Prison Committee==

PEN International Writers in Prison Committee works on behalf of persecuted writers worldwide. Established in 1960 in response to increasing attempts to silence voices of dissent by imprisoning writers, the Writers in Prison Committee monitors the cases of as many as 900 writers annually who have been imprisoned, tortured, threatened, attacked, made to disappear, and killed for the peaceful practice of their profession. It publishes a bi-annual Case List documenting free expression violations against writers around the world.

The committee also coordinates the PEN International membership&#x27;s campaigns that aim towards an end to these attacks and to the suppression of freedom of expression worldwide.

PEN International Writers in Prison Committee is a founding member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX), a global network of 90 non-governmental organisations that monitors censorship worldwide and defends journalists, writers, internet users and others who are persecuted for exercising their right to freedom of expression.

It is also a member of IFEX&#x27;s Tunisia Monitoring Group (TMG), a coalition of twenty-one free expression organisations that began lobbying the Tunisian government to improve its human rights record in 2005. Since the Arab Spring events that led to the collapse of the Tunisian government, TMG has worked to ensure constitutional guarantees of free expression and human rights within the country.

On 15 January 2016, PEN International joined human rights organisations and the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, along with seven other organisations, to protest against the 2013 imprisonment and 2015 sentencing of musicians Mehdi Rajabian and Yousef Emadi, and filmmaker Hossein Rajabian, and called on the head of the judiciary and other Iranian authorities to drop the charges against them.

Ma Thida is the Chair of this committee.

==PEN affiliated awards==

The various PEN affiliations offer many literary awards across a broad spectrum.

==Memorials==
A grove of trees beside Lake Burley Griffin forms the PEN International memorial in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. The dedication reads: &quot;The spirit dies in all of us who keep silent in the face of tyranny.&quot; The memorial was officially opened on 17 November 1997.

A cast-iron sculpture entitled &quot;Witness&quot;, commissioned by English PEN to mark their 90th anniversary and created by Antony Gormley, stands outside the British Library in London. It depicts an empty chair, and is inspired by the symbol used for 30 years by English PEN to represent imprisoned writers around the world. It was unveiled on 13 December 2011.

<text>Elaine Stritch (February 2, 1925 – July 17, 2014) was an American actress, singer, and comedienne, known for her work on Broadway and later, television. She made her professional stage debut in 1944 and appeared in numerous stage plays, musicals, feature films and television series. Stritch was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1995.

Stritch made her Broadway debut in the 1946 comedy &quot;Loco&quot; and went on to receive four Tony Award nominations: for the William Inge play &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (1956); the Noël Coward musical &quot;Sail Away&quot; (1962); the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Company&quot; (1970), which included her performance of the song &quot;The Ladies Who Lunch&quot;; and for the revival of the Edward Albee play &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; (1996). Her one-woman show &quot;Elaine Stritch at Liberty&quot; won the 2002 Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event.

Stritch relocated to London in the 1970s and starred in several West End productions, including Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Small Craft Warnings&quot; (1973) and Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Gingerbread Lady&quot; (1974). She also starred with Donald Sinden in the ITV sitcom &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot; (1975–79), which earned her a 1979 BAFTA TV Award nomination. She won an Emmy Award in 1993 for her guest role on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and another for the 2004 television documentary of her one-woman show &quot;Elaine Stritch at Liberty&quot;. From 2007 to 2012, she had a recurring role as Colleen Donaghy on the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot;, a role that won her a third Emmy in 2007.

==Early life==
Stritch was born on February 2, 1925, in Detroit, Michigan, the youngest daughter of Mildred (née Jobe), a homemaker, and George Joseph Stritch, an executive with B.F. Goodrich. She had two older sisters, Georgene and Sally. Her Catholic family was well-off. Her father was of Irish descent, while her mother had Welsh ancestry. Cardinal Samuel Stritch, Archbishop of Chicago from 1940 to 1958, was one of her cousins. She trained at the Dramatic Workshop of The New School for Social Research in New York City under Erwin Piscator, alongside Marlon Brando, Bea Arthur, and Harry Belafonte.

==Career==
===Early stage career===
Stritch made her stage debut in 1944. Her later Broadway debut was in &quot;Loco&quot; in 1946, directed by Jed Harris, followed soon after by &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; (as a replacement), and then &quot;Angel in the Wings&quot; (1947), a revue in which she performed comedy sketches and the song &quot;Civilization&quot;.

Stritch understudied Ethel Merman for &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, and, at the same time, appeared in the 1952 revival of &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, singing &quot;Zip&quot;. Stritch later starred in the national tour of &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, and appeared in a supporting role in the original Broadway production of William Inge&#x27;s play &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. In 1958 she originated the leading role of Maggie Harris in the musical &quot;Goldilocks&quot;.

She starred in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Sail Away&quot; on Broadway in 1961. Stritch started in the show in a &quot;relatively minor role and was only promoted over the title and given virtually all the best songs when it was reckoned that the leading lady...although excellent, was rather too operatic for a musical comedy&quot;. During out-of-town tryouts in Boston, Coward was &quot;unsure about the dramatic talents&quot; of one of the leads, opera singer Jean Fenn.

Joe Layton suggested &quot;What would happen if...we just eliminated [Fenn&#x27;s] role and gave everything to Stritch? The show was very old-fashioned, and the thing that was working was Elaine Stritch. Every time she went on stage [she] was a sensation.&quot; The reconstructed &#x27;Sail Away&#x27; opened on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre on October 3, 1961&quot;, with Stritch giving what Howard Taubman of The New York Times said &quot;must be the performance of her career.&quot;

In 1966, she played Ruth Sherwood in the musical &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; at New York&#x27;s City Center, and appeared in an Off Broadway revival of &quot;Private Lives&quot; in 1968.
She was the original performer cast in the role of Joanne in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Company&quot; (1970) on Broadway. After over a decade of successful runs in shows in New York, Stritch moved in 1972 to London, where she starred in the West End production of &quot;Company&quot;. On tour and in stock, Stritch appeared in such musicals as &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;I Married an Angel&quot;, and in &quot;Mame&quot; as both Vera Charles (opposite Janet Blair) and Mame Dennis.

===Television===
Stritch&#x27;s earliest television appearances were in &quot;The Growing Paynes&quot; (1949) and the &quot;Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot; (1953–55). She also appeared on episodes of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1954. She was the first and original Trixie Norton in a &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketch with Jackie Gleason, Art Carney and Pert Kelton. The character was originally a burlesque dancer, but the role was rewritten and recast after just one episode with the more wholesome looking Joyce Randolph playing the character as a housewife.

Stritch&#x27;s other television credits included a number of dramatic programs in the 1950s and 1960s, including &quot;Studio One&quot;. In the 1960 television season, Stritch appeared in the role of writer Ruth Sherwood in the CBS sitcom &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;, opposite Shirley Bonne as her younger sister, Eileen Sherwood, an aspiring actress. The sisters, natives of Ohio, live in a brownstone apartment in Greenwich Village. The one-season series aired opposite &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; on ABC and &quot;Perry Como&#x27;s Kraft Music Hall&quot; on NBC.

In 1975, Stritch starred in the British LWT comedy series &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot; opposite Donald Sinden. She played Dorothy McNab, an American writer living in London who was known for her lurid and sensationalist thriller novels. Sinden played Robert, her English butler, who disapproved of practically everything Dorothy did and the series derived its comedy from the inevitable culture clash between Robert&#x27;s very British stiff-upper-lip attitude and Dorothy&#x27;s devil-may-care New York view of life. &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot; was exceptionally well received in Britain and ran for four series until 1979. In 1979, both Stritch and Sinden were nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot;, in the category &quot;Best Light Entertainment Performance&quot;, losing out to Ronnie Barker. 

In 1980, Stritch starred in another series for LWT, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect&quot; (the British version of &quot;Maude&quot;—not to be confused with the 1980 American series of the same name, which aired in the UK as &quot;Hart of the Yard&quot;) playing Bill Hooper alongside Richard Griffiths as her husband Sam. Unsatisfied with the Anglicised scripts, Stritch herself adapted the original American scripts for all but one of the fourteen episodes (Griffiths handled the remaining one).
Other British television appearances by Stritch included Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;. Although she appeared several times in different roles, perhaps her most memorable appearance was in the story &quot;William and Mary&quot;, in which she played the wife of a man who has cheated death by having his brain preserved. She appeared on BBC 1&#x27;s children&#x27;s series, &quot;Jackanory&quot;, reading, among other stories, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; by Roald Dahl.

After returning to the United States, she appeared on &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; as vinegary nanny Mrs. DeGroot, then was cast as a regular on the short-lived &quot;The Ellen Burstyn Show&quot; in 1986. She appeared as the stern schoolteacher Mrs. McGee on three episodes of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1989–90). She had a recurring role in &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (1992, 1997) as Lanie Stieglitz. Other roles included Judge Grace Lema on &quot;Oz&quot; (1998); and Martha Albright (mother of Jane Curtin&#x27;s character) on two episodes of &quot;3rd Rock From the Sun&quot; (1997, 2001), alongside her Broadway co-star George Grizzard, who played George Albright. On April 26, 2007, she began guest appearances on the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; as Colleen, the fearsome mother of Alec Baldwin&#x27;s lead character, Jack Donaghy.

Stritch was reportedly considered for the role of Dorothy Zbornak on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; but, as she related in her show &quot;Elaine Stritch at Liberty&quot;, she &quot;blew her audition&quot;. The role was cast with Beatrice Arthur. She was seen on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1993), replacing fellow stage legend Eileen Heckart as Wilma Bern. In 1996, she appeared on an episode of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; as a woman who believes host David Letterman is her pool boy.

===Film roles===
Stritch appeared in more films in her later years than the early part of her career. In an interview in 1988, it was noted that &quot;Making movies is challenging to Stritch since she considers herself a novice.&quot; She said: &quot;I&#x27;m fascinated with it. And I want to do more of them.&quot; She was asked why she waited so long to make movies since she apparently enjoys it so much. &quot;You do a movie for, like, three months and then you&#x27;re finished. You do a part in a play and it&#x27;s like going into a roomful of audiences for a year.&quot;

Early in her career, she appeared in &quot;Three Violent People&quot; (1956) starring Charlton Heston, as the hotel proprietor pal of Anne Baxter, and then co-starred opposite Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones in the David O. Selznick remake of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1957) as Hudson&#x27;s nurse. In &quot;The Perfect Furlough&quot;, she co-starred opposite Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh. She had a showy role as the lesbian proprietor of a bar in the cult film &quot;Who Killed Teddy Bear?&quot; (1965), which starred Sal Mineo. She played a &quot;tough-as-nails&quot; nurse in the remake of &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; (1975) and was praised for her performance in &quot;Providence&quot; (1977).

When she returned to the United States in the mid-1980s from London, Woody Allen cast her as the former movie star mother in his drama &quot;September&quot; (1987). &quot;People&quot; magazine called her performance &quot;acclaimed&quot; and wrote &quot;Though the movie has received mixed reviews, Stritch&#x27;s roaring presence, like Godzilla in a stalled elevator, can&#x27;t be ignored.&quot; Allen later cast her in his comedy &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; (2000) in which she played a &quot;snobby socialite&quot;. Rex Reed wrote of her performance: &quot;Elaine Stritch can still stop you in your tracks with a meaningless, drop-dead one-liner (which is all she gets here).&quot;

She joined the ensemble of &quot;&quot; (1988) as an apartment manager who helps widowed Jack Gilford get over his wife&#x27;s death. Among her co-stars were former &quot;Goldilocks&quot; co-star Don Ameche and Gwen Verdon. She appeared in &quot;Out to Sea&quot; (1997) as Dyan Cannon&#x27;s wise-cracking mother and &quot;danced up a storm&quot; with the other characters. She played Winona Ryder&#x27;s loving grandmother in the film &quot;Autumn in New York&quot; (2000).

Stritch had a rare co-starring role in the comedy &quot;Screwed&quot; (2000), playing Miss Crock, who becomes the intended victim of a kidnapping by her disgruntled butler (Norm Macdonald). She appeared in the comedy &quot;Monster in Law&quot; (2005) starring Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda, playing Fonda&#x27;s mother-in-law.

===BBC Radio===
In 1982, Stritch appeared on an edition of the long-running BBC Radio comedy series &quot;Just a Minute&quot; alongside Kenneth Williams, Clement Freud and Barry Cryer. The show was described by long-time chairman Nicholas Parsons as being among the most memorable because of the way Stritch stretched the show&#x27;s rules. She described Kenneth Williams as capable of making &quot;one word into a three-act play&quot;. 

===Later stage work===
After her husband, John Bay, died from brain cancer in 1982, Stritch returned to America, and after a further lull in her career and struggles with alcoholism, Stritch began performing again. She appeared in a one-night only concert of &quot;Company&quot; in 1993 and as Parthy in a Broadway revival of the musical &quot;Show Boat&quot; in 1994.

In 1996 she played Claire in a revival of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot;, with &quot;Variety&quot; writing: &quot;Equally marvelous is Stritch, with a meatier role than her recent foray as Parthy in &quot;&#x27;Show Boat&quot;.&#x27; To watch her succumb to the vast amounts of alcohol Claire ingests, folding and refolding her legs, slipping – no, oozing – onto the floor, her face crumpling like a paper bag, is to witness a different but equally winning kind of thespian expertise. It&#x27;s a master class up there.&quot;

====&quot;Elaine Stritch at Liberty&quot;====

Her one-woman show &quot;Elaine Stritch at Liberty&quot;, a summation of her life and career, premiered at New York&#x27;s Public Theater, running from November 7 to December 30, 2001. It then ran on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre from February 21 to May 27, 2002, and then, also in 2002, at London&#x27;s Old Vic Theatre. 
&quot;Newsweek&quot; noted:

====&quot;A Little Night Music&quot;====
Stritch appeared in the Broadway revival of the Sondheim-Wheeler musical &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; from July 2010 to January 2011, succeeding Angela Lansbury in the role of Madame Armfeldt, the mother who remembers her life as a courtesan in the song &quot;Liaisons&quot;. The AP reviewer of the musical (with the two new leads) wrote &quot;Devotees of Stritch, who earned her Sondheim stripes singing, memorably, &#x27;The Ladies Who Lunch&#x27; in &quot;Company&quot; 40 years ago, will revel in how the actress, who earned a huge ovation before her first line at a recent preview, brings her famously salty, acerbic style to the role of Madame Armfeldt.&quot;

The theatre critic for &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; wrote:

===Cabaret===
Stritch performed a cabaret act in New York City at the Cafe Carlyle in the Carlyle Hotel, where she was a resident from 2005 until she left New York in 2013. Her first show at the Carlyle was titled &quot;At Home at the Carlyle&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer wrote:

Between musical numbers, Stritch told stories from the world of stage and screen, tales from her everyday life and personal glimpses of her private tragedies and triumphs. She performed at the Cafe Carlyle in early 2010 and in fall 2011 in &quot;At Home at the Carlyle: Elaine Stritch Singin&#x27; Sondheim...One Song at a Time&quot;.

==Personal life==
Stritch was married to the actor John Bay from 1973 until his death in 1982. He was part of the family that owns the Bay&#x27;s English Muffins company, and Stritch sent English muffins as gifts to friends. Said John Kenley: &quot;Every Christmas, she still sends me English muffins.&quot; When she was based in London, Stritch and her husband lived at the Savoy Hotel.

She was good friends with gossip columnist Liz Smith, with whom she shared a birthday (February 2).

In March 2013, Stritch announced she was leaving New York and relocating to Birmingham, Michigan, close to where she grew up.

Stritch was candid about her alcoholism. She took her first drink at 14 and began using it as a crutch before performances to vanquish her stage fright and insecurities. Her drinking worsened after Bay&#x27;s death, and she sought help after experiencing problems with the effects of alcoholism, including the onset of diabetes. &quot;Elaine Stritch at Liberty&quot; discusses the topic at length.

==Death==
Stritch died in her sleep at age 89 at her home in Birmingham, Michigan, on July 17, 2014. She suffered from diabetes and had stomach cancer. At the time of her death, three months after having had surgery for the disease, cancer was not cited as a cause of her death. She is buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Skokie, Illinois.

== Awards and honors ==

The Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event was awarded to the producers of &quot;Elaine Stritch at Liberty&quot;. However, Stritch enthusiastically accepted the award at the 56th Tony Awards, later complaining that her acceptance speech was cut off by the strains of the orchestra, which left her feeling angry.

The Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Special for the HBO special of &quot;Elaine Stritch at Liberty&quot;, was awarded to its producers.

Stritch was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1995.

==In popular culture==
Stritch&#x27;s voice and vocal delivery are spoofed in the &quot;Forbidden Broadway&quot; songs &quot;The Ladies Who Screech&quot; and &quot;Stritch&quot;, parodies of &quot;The Ladies Who Lunch&quot; and &quot;Zip&quot;, songs she performed in the musicals &quot;Company&quot; and &quot;Pal Joey&quot;.

In 2009, a parody by Bats Langley entitled &quot;How the Stritch Stole Christmas&quot; (loosely based on &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;) appeared on YouTube.

On &quot;The Big Gay Sketch Show&quot; in 2007, she was spoofed (portrayed by Nicol Paone) as a Wal-Mart greeter who is still a theater gal at heart. In a later episode, Stritch is spoofed as an airport security guard, who&#x27;s still &quot;on&quot; and isn&#x27;t able to tone down her over-the-top antics. In yet another episode, &quot;Stritch&quot; is promoting her self-titled perfume &quot;Stritchy&quot; in dramatic fashion when she is confronted by the real-life Elaine Stritch, who makes a cameo appearance.

Starting in 2024, her cover version of &quot;Are You Havin&#x27; Any Fun?&quot; was the soundtrack of a series of US TV commercials for the Volkswagen ID. Buzz.

<text>Stratford Place is a small road in London, off Oxford Street, opposite Bond Street underground station. The road is a cul-de-sac.

==Stratford House==

Stratford House was built as the London town house of the Stratford family between 1770 and 1776 for Edward Stratford, 2nd Earl of Aldborough, who paid £4,000 for the site. The central range was designed by Robert Adam. It had previously been the location of the Lord Mayor of London&#x27;s Banqueting House, built in 1565. There have been several people of note who stayed there including the sons of the Tzar of Russia, and Clementine Hozier was born there, and the house until 1832 was owned by the Wingfield Stratford branch of the family who inherited it through Edward&#x27;s will. It belonged briefly to Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, a son of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. The house was little altered until 1894, when its then owner, Mr Murray Guthrie, added a second storey to the east and west wings and a colonnade in front. In 1903, a new owner, the Liberal politician Sir Edward Colebrook, later Lord Colebrooke, reconstructed the Library to an Adam design. In 1908, Lord Derby bought a lease and began more alterations, removing the colonnade and adding a third storey to both wings. He took out the original bifurcated staircase (replacing it with a less elegant single one), demolished the stables and built a Banqueting Hall with a grand ballroom above.

In 1960 the house was purchased by the Oriental Club and converted to its present state. The ballroom was turned into two floors of new bedrooms, further lifts were added, and the banqueting hall was divided into a dining room and other rooms. The house now has a main drawing room, as well as others, a members&#x27; bar, a library and an ante-room, a billiards room, an internet suite and business room, and two (non)smoking rooms, as well as a dining room and 32 bedrooms.

Stratford House is a Grade I listed building.

<doc id="965966" wikidata="Q2633149" url="?curid=965966" title="Trial of the Sixteen">
<text>The Trial of the Sixteen () was a staged trial of 16 leaders of the Polish Underground State held by the Soviet authorities in Moscow in 1945. All captives were kidnapped by the NKVD secret service and falsely accused of various forms of &#x27;illegal activity&#x27; against the Red Army.

==History==
The Government Delegate, together with most members of the Council of National Unity and the Commander-in-chief of the Armia Krajowa, were invited by Soviet general Ivan Serov (with agreement of Joseph Stalin) to a conference on their eventual entry to the Soviet-backed Provisional Government. Some historical accounts say approaches were made in February, with others saying March 1945. The Polish politicians were presented with a warrant of safety, but were instead arrested in Pruszków and brutally beaten by the NKVD on 27 and 28 March. Leopold Okulicki, Jan Stanisław Jankowski and Kazimierz Pużak were arrested on the 27th with 12 others the following day. Alexander Zwierzyński had been arrested earlier. They were brought to Moscow for interrogation in the Lubyanka.
After several months of brutal interrogation and torture they were presented with trumped-up accusations of:
#Collaboration with Nazi Germany
#Carrying-out intelligence gathering and sabotage at the rear of the Red Army
#State terrorism
#Planning a military alliance with Nazi Germany
#Owning a radio transmitter, printing machines, and weapons
#Propaganda against the Soviet Union
#Membership in underground organizations.

The trial took place between 18 and 21 June 1945 with foreign press and observers from the United Kingdom and United States present. The date was chosen carefully to be at the same time as a conference on the creation of the Soviet-backed Polish puppet government was organized. The verdict was issued on 21 June, with most of the defendants coerced into pleading guilty by the NKVD. General Okulicki&#x27;s witnesses for the defense were declared unreachable &quot;owing to bad atmospheric conditions&quot;, and no evidence was offered during the trial. Of the sixteen defendants, twelve were sentenced to prison terms ranging from four months to ten years, while charges against the four others were dropped by the prosecution.

Immediately after the arrest of all the leaders, the Polish government in exile sent a protest note to Washington and London demanding their release. At first the Soviets declared that the whole case was a bluff by the &quot;Fascist Polish government&quot;. When they finally admitted that the leaders had been arrested (on 5 May), the American envoy of Harry S. Truman, Harry Lloyd Hopkins, was told by Joseph Stalin that &quot;there is no point in linking the case of the Trial of the Sixteen with the support for the Soviet-backed government of Poland because the sentences will not be high.&quot; Both British and American governments shared this view.
==People involved==
# Lt. General Vasili Ulrikh, notable for playing a major role in the Great Purge trials, served as the main judge and issued the following sentences:
#Commander in Chief of the Armia Krajowa, Leopold Okulicki (&quot;Niedźwiadek&quot;) – 10 years in prison, may have been murdered on Christmas Eve of 1946 but may have died due to complications caused by hunger strike.
#Deputy Prime Minister of Poland and the Government Delegate, Jan Stanisław Jankowski – 8 years in prison, never released, died in a Soviet prison on 13 March 1953, two weeks before the end of his sentence; probably murdered.
#Minister of Internal Affairs, Adam Bień – 5 years
#Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, Stanislaw Jasiukowicz – 5 years
#Head of the Council of National Unity and PPS-WRN socialist party – Kazimierz Pużak – 1.5 years, released in November 1945 and returned to Poland. Refused to emigrate, Pużak was again arrested by the Urząd Bezpieczeństwa in 1947 and sentenced to 10 years in prison; died 30 April 1950
#Deputy head of the Council of National Unity and head of the Labor Party, Aleksander Zwierzyński – 8 months
#Member of the Council of National Unity, Kazimierz Bagiński – 1 year, later released and forced to emigrate to the United States
#Member of the Council of National Unity, Head of &quot;Zjednoczenie Demokratyczne&quot;, Eugeniusz Czarnowski – 6 months
#Member of the Council of National Unity, Head of the Labor Party, Józef Chaciński – 4 months
#Member of the Council of National Unity, Stanisław Mierzwa – 4 months
#Member of the Council of National Unity, Zbigniew Stypułkowski – 4 months, later released and forced to emigrate to the United Kingdom
#Member of the Council of National Unity, Franciszek Urbański – 4 months
#Member of the Council of National Unity, Stanisław Michałowski – acquitted of all the charges
#Member of the Council of National Unity, Kazimierz Kobylański – acquitted of all the charges
#Member of the Council of National Unity, interpreter for the group, Józef Stemler – acquitted of all the charges
#Deputy Government Delegate – Antoni Pajdak was sentenced to 5 years in prison in a secret trial in November; he was not released until 1955.

==Aftermath==
In his book, &quot;Europe at War&quot;, Norman Davies described it as &quot;obscene&quot;, that there was no official protest abroad. As a result of the trial, the Polish Secret State was deprived of most of its leaders. Its structures were soon rebuilt, but were never able to fully recover. On 6 July 1945 the United Kingdom and the United States withdrew support for the legitimate Polish government in exile, and all its agendas in Poland. Soviet and Polish Communist repressions aimed at former members of the Polish Secret State and the Armia Krajowa lasted well into the 1960s, corporal Józef Franczak being killed in a shootout with paramilitary-police in 1963.

<text>Hilarie Ros Burton (born July 1, 1982), also known as Hilarie Burton Morgan, is an American actress. A former host of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, she portrayed Peyton Sawyer on The WB/The CW drama &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; for six seasons (2003–2009). Post &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, Burton starred in &quot;Our Very Own&quot;, &quot;Solstice&quot;, and &quot;The List&quot;. She has also had supporting or recurring roles in television series, including her role as Sara Ellis on &quot;White Collar&quot; (2010–2013), Dr. Lauren Boswell on the ABC medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (2013), Molly Dawes on the ABC drama series &quot;Forever&quot; (2014), and Karen Palmer on the Fox television series &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; (2016). Burton was a co-host on the &quot;Drama Queens&quot; podcast along with her former &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; co-stars, Sophia Bush and Bethany Joy Lenz until the summer of 2024.

==Early life==
Burton was born on July 1, 1982, in Sterling, Virginia, United States. Her father, James William &quot;Bill&quot; Burton (born 1947), is a veteran of the U.S. Army, and her mother, Lisa Kay (; born 1960), is a real estate agent originally from Minnesota. Burton&#x27;s parents married in 1981. Burton is the eldest of four children, with three brothers. In 2000, she graduated from Park View High School, where she was student council treasurer her sophomore year, vice-president her junior year, and captain of the cheerleading squad, student council president, and homecoming queen her senior year. Burton attended New York University from Fordham University, graduating in 2004.

==Career==
===Media personality===
Burton&#x27;s first big break came when working as a VJ for MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live (TRL)&quot;. She was supposed to be a guest commentator for one segment, but producers decided to offer her a permanent job. Burton went on to present at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards and MTV&#x27;s &quot;Iced Out New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;. Burton went on to portray herself on The WB (now The CW)&#x27;s drama series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; in 2002, which marked her television debut.

In October 2017, when news of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases broke, Burton retweeted a 2003 video clip from &quot;TRL Uncensored&quot; in which Ben Affleck squeezed her breast on air. This was in response to a fan tweet that quipped, &quot;[Affleck] also grabbed Hilarie Burton-Morgan&#x27;s breasts on TRL once. Everyone forgot though.&quot; Burton replied, &quot;I didn&#x27;t forget [about it] ... I was a kid.&quot; Affleck, who&#x27;d just publicly criticized Weinstein, subsequently responded on Twitter to apologize to Burton. When asked about the incident a month later on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, Affleck said, &quot;I don&#x27;t remember it, but I absolutely apologize for it. I certainly don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s lying or making it up.&#x27;&quot;

In 2021, Burton started a podcast with &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; co-stars Sophia Bush and Bethany Joy Lenz titled &quot;Drama Queens&quot;.

===Acting and producing===

Burton was cast in The WB drama series &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; as Peyton Sawyer, an independent visual and musical artist and cheerleader, in April 2003. The series premiered on September 23, 2003, and went on to be the network&#x27;s top rated program of the year. The role was considered Burton&#x27;s breakout role and is her best known to date. For her role in the series, Burton was featured on the cover of &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;American Cheerleader Magazine&quot; and &quot;People&quot;. Her performance received critical praise and she earned three Teen Choice Award nominations. In May 2009, The CW announced Burton would not be returning for the show&#x27;s seventh season based on her own decision not to return, contrary to rumors she left owing to salary issues.

One Tree Hill heightened Burton&#x27;s public profile. In May 2007 she was ranked #77 in &quot;Maxim&quot;″s &quot;Hot 100 List of 2007&quot;. She also appeared on the cover of the November 2006 edition of &quot;Maxim&quot; with &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; co-stars Sophia Bush and Danneel Harris. In previous years, Burton ranked #2 on &quot;Femme Fatales&quot;″ &quot;The 50 Sexiest Women of 2005&quot;, and #12 on Much Music&#x27;s &quot;20 Hottest Women of 2003&quot;.

While still a &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; cast member, Burton made her feature film debut opposite Allison Janney and Cheryl Hines in the 2005 well-reviewed drama &quot;Our Very Own&quot; which centered on five small-town teenagers who dream of a better life. Burton and her co-stars received the &quot;Outstanding Ensemble Acting&quot; award at the prestigious Sarasota Film Festival. Burton appeared in the 2007 Lifetime drama &quot;Normal Adolescent Behavior&quot; which followed a group of friends who are in a six-way polyfidelitous relationship. That same year, Burton co-starred in the supernatural horror film &quot;Solstice&quot; opposite Amanda Seyfried and Elisabeth Harnois. Burton also created her own production company, Southern Gothic Production (SoGoPro) in 2007, along with Nick Gray, Kelly Tenney, James Burton, and Meg Mortimer.

In 2008, Burton appeared in both the Fox Searchlight Pictures drama &quot;The Secret Life of Bees&quot;, as the deceased mother of Dakota Fanning&#x27;s character, and the limited release thriller &quot;The List&quot;. Burton was next cast in the film &quot;Bloodworth&quot; opposite Hilary Duff and Val Kilmer, an adaptation of the novel &quot;Provinces of Night&quot; by William Gay. The film premiered after her exit from One Tree Hill, at the 2010 Santa Barbara International Film Festival, but made little money in limited release. Burton won a recurring arc in the USA Network crime drama series &quot;White Collar&quot; in 2010 as Sara Ellis, an insurance investigator in the second season. She was upgraded to a series regular in 2011 for the third season, but switched back to the recurring cast in the fourth season. 2012 saw Burton guest-starring on the ABC police comedy-drama &quot;Castle&quot; (season 4, episode 13) as a reality television star who is accused of murder. Next came a recurring role in the ABC medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; for the final three episodes of the 2013 ninth season, as Dr. Lauren Boswell. That fall, Burton had a recurring role on the short-lived CBS drama &quot;Hostages&quot;. Burton reunited with &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; co-star Tyler Hilton for a recurring role on CBS sci-fi drama &quot;Extant&quot; in 2015. Burton appeared as the DEA agent love interest of main character Martin Riggs on &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; from the seventh episode of the first season in 2016 through the third episode of the second season in 2017.

In November 2017, Burton spoke out in light of charges that &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; creator Mark Schwahn had sexually harassed some of the female crew, alleging that she had also been sexually assaulted by Schwahn.

Burton guest-starred in the tenth season of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; as Negan&#x27;s wife Lucille, appearing alongside her real-life husband Jeffrey Dean Morgan who plays Negan.

Since 2021, Burton has been a co-host on the &quot;Drama Queens&quot; podcast along with her former &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; co-stars, Sophia Bush and Bethany Joy Lenz.

===Writing===
On May 5, 2020, Burton published her first non-fiction book, &quot;The Rural Diaries: Love, Livestock, and Big Life Lessons Down on Mischief Farm&quot;.

She published her memoir, &quot;Grimoire Girl: A Memoir of Magic and Mischief&quot;, on April 25, 2023.

==Personal life==

During her time on &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, Burton resided in Wilmington, North Carolina, where the show was filmed.

Burton began dating Jeffrey Dean Morgan in 2009, after being introduced by Jensen and Danneel Ackles. Their first child, a son, was born in March 2010, and their second child, a daughter, was born in February 2018. Having lived in Los Angeles, Burton and Morgan moved to the Hudson Valley following their son&#x27;s birth. In 2014, the couple purchased Samuel&#x27;s Sweet Shop in Rhinebeck with Paul and Julie Rudd and producer Andy Ostroy. In 2018, Burton and Morgan purchased a , which they named Mischief Farm. The couple married on October 5, 2019, in a ceremony officiated by Jensen Ackles.

Burton has been candid on social media about the couple&#x27;s struggle to conceive, stating that it took five years to successfully carry a second baby to term. Subsequently, she has spoken out publicly in support of abortion rights after the Supreme Court decision on &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; that overturned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, stating:This is my child. My beloved. My daughter. It is no secret I struggled with infertility. Losing multiple pregnancies before her was traumatic. But female bodies are all different and unpredictable. Having an abortion after my fetus died allowed for my uterus to heal in a way that made it healthy enough to carry future pregnancies. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you use the term D&amp;C. The official word on the hospital paperwork is abortion. That&#x27;s what it was.

Even though the show &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; was filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina, Burton has family there as well. Throughout the years she has been an advocate for the Wilmington community and the most recent example of that is her work in promoting and raising money for the film Wilmington on Fire, about the Wilmington massacre.

<text>East Portlemouth is a village and civil parish in the South Hams district, in the county of Devon, England, situated at the southern end of the Kingsbridge Estuary, on the south Devon Coast. The population of this parish taken at the 2011 census was 162. The village is sited on a hill giving views to the north to Kingsbridge and on a clear day as far as Dartmoor. There is a small ferry that runs to Salcombe in the opposite side of the estuary, and a beach that is popular with holidaymakers.

The place-name &#x27;Portlemouth&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Porlamuta&quot;. This is thought to derive from the Old English &quot;Portwellan-mutha&quot;, meaning &#x27;mouth of the port well&#x27;, that is to say &#x27;mouth of the harbour stream&#x27;, the village being at the mouth of a river.

The village is popular with celebrities as a second-home base, where home owners include Steve Rider, Kate Bush and Michael Parkinson.

<doc id="965981" wikidata="Q1483957" url="?curid=965981" title="Fūjin">
<text>or , sometimes also known as Ryobu, is the Japanese god of the wind and one of the eldest Shinto and Buddhism gods. He is portrayed as a terrifying wizardly demon, resembling a red-haired, green-skinned humanoid wearing a tiger or leopard skin loincloth/kilt, carrying a large bag of winds (風袋; Kazebuko/Fūtai) on his shoulders. In Japanese art, the deity is often depicted together with Raijin, the god of lightning, thunder and storms.

==Myths==

=== Birth ===
According to &quot;Kojiki&quot;, Fūjin and his brother Raijin were born from Izanami after she died.

When Izanagi went down to Yomi to retrieve his wife, he saw her as a decaying corpse covered with demons. Izanagi rejected her, making Izanami furious, leading her and a few monsters to chase after Izanagi. Izanagi then blocked the entrance to Yomi. However, a few demons and oni escaped the underworld through a crack in the boulder, including Fūjin and his brother Raijin.

==Depiction==

The iconography of Fūjin seems to have its origin in the cultural exchanges along the Silk Road. Starting with the Hellenistic period when Greece occupied parts of Central Asia and India, the Greek wind god Boreas became the god Wardo/Oado in Bactrian Greco-Buddhist art, then a wind deity in China (as seen frescoes of the Tarim Basin; usually named Feng Bo/Feng Po - &quot;Uncle Wind&quot; - among various other names), and finally the Japanese Wind God Fūjin. The wind god kept its symbol, the windbag, and its disheveled appearance throughout this evolution.

* Rudra, the Vedic wind or storm God
* Vayu, Hindu god of wind

# &quot;The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins. ...

<text>The Kingsbridge Estuary (also, erroneously, known as the &#x27;Salcombe Estuary&#x27;) in the South Hams area of Devon, England runs from Kingsbridge in the north to its mouth at the English Channel near Salcombe and lies between Bolt Head and Sharpitor to the west and Portlemouth Down to the east. The estuary is some in length, with numerous side channels. Several of its creeks have independent names, including Blanksmill, Frogmore, Southpool, Batson and Bowcombe Creek (the most northerly portion of the estuary).

It covers an area of of which are inter-tidal. At high water the length of coast within the ria is . Although there are no major water courses entering the estuary, its total catchment area is .

The estuary is an extreme example of a ria or drowned river valley caused by rising sea levels rather than a true estuary. Prior to the sea level rise at the end of the last glacial period, it was the valley of a river. Its size is disproportionate to the size of the small streams which flow into it.

In February 1987 the estuary was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is a Local Nature Reserve and lies within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

<doc id="965988" wikidata="Q4103652" url="?curid=965988" title="Barbarians at the Gate (film)">
<text>Barbarians at the Gate is a 1993 American biographical comedy-drama television film directed by Glenn Jordan and written by Larry Gelbart, based on the 1989 book of the same name by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar. The film stars James Garner, Jonathan Pryce, and Peter Riegert. It tells the true story of F. Ross Johnson, who was the president and CEO of RJR Nabisco.

&quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. The film earned nine nominations at the Primetime Emmy Awards (winning for Outstanding Made for Television Movie). It also won Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television and Best Actor in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television for Garner at the Golden Globe Awards.

==Plot==
Self-made multimillionaire F. Ross Johnson, CEO of RJR Nabisco, decides to take the tobacco and food conglomerate company private in 1988 after receiving advanced news of the likely market failure of the company&#x27;s smokeless cigarette called Premier, the development of which had been intended to finally boost the company&#x27;s stock price.

The free-spending Johnson&#x27;s bid for the company is opposed by two of the pioneers of the leveraged buyout, Henry Kravis and his cousin. Kravis feels betrayed when, after Johnson initially discusses doing the LBO with Kravis, he takes the potentially enormous deal to another firm, the Shearson Lehman Hutton division of American Express.

Other bidders emerge, including Ted Forstmann and his company, Forstmann Little, after Kravis and Johnson are unable to reconcile their differences. The bidding goes to unprecedented heights, and when executive Charles Hugel becomes aware of how much Johnson stands to profit in a transaction that will put thousands of Nabisco employees out of work, he quips, &quot;Now I know what the &#x27;F&#x27; in F. Ross Johnson stands for.&quot; The greed is so evident, Kravis&#x27;s final bid is declared the winner, even though Johnson&#x27;s was higher.

The title of the book and movie comes from a statement by Forstmann in which he calls Kravis&#x27; money &quot;phoney junk bond crap&quot; and how he and his brother are &quot;real people with real money,&quot; and that to stop raiders like Kravis: &quot;We need to push the barbarians back from the city gates.&quot;

<doc id="965991" wikidata="Q451455" url="?curid=965991" title="Vagit Alekperov">
<text>Vagit Yusufovich Alekperov (, ; born 1 September 1950) is an Azerbaijani oligarch. He was the President of the oil company Lukoil from 1993 until 2022. As of September 2024, according to Forbes billionaires list by Forbes magazine, Alekperov has an estimated net worth of , making him the 3rd wealthiest person in Russia and the fifty-ninth in the world. Alekperov previously owned a 36.8% stake in football club Spartak Moscow. Fellow former Spartak owner Leonid Fedun is Alekperov&#x27;s close associate. Alekperov also owned superyacht builder Heesen Yachts until 2022.

As part of the international governmental responses to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have imposed sanctions against Alekperov.

==Biography==
Alekperov was born on 1 September 1950, in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, one of the earliest centers of the international petroleum industry. His father, who died when Vagit was a boy, worked in the oilfields all his life and inspired Alekperov to follow in his footsteps. Alekperov&#x27;s father was an Azerbaijani Muslim and his mother, Russian Orthodox. Alekperov is religious, but does not define himself as either Muslim or Orthodox.

In 1974, Alekperov graduated from the Azerbaijan Oil and Chemistry Institute with a Master of Science in Engineering.

=== Western Siberia ===
Alekperov moved to Western Siberia in 1979 and worked at &quot;Surgutneftegaz&quot; between 1979 and 1985, earning his reputation as an industry expert. He was ascending positions and by 1985 became first deputy general director of Bashneft production company. In 1987, he became general director of the newly created production company &quot;Kogalymneftegaz&quot;.

=== Moscow ===
In 1990, Alekperov was appointed deputy minister of the Oil and Gas Industry of the Soviet Union and became the youngest deputy energy minister in Soviet history. At that time, Alekperov promoted the establishment of vertically integrated state-owned energy companies, which would bring together the wide range of organizations in the energy sector that were, at the time, reporting to different Soviet bureaucratic institutions.

Just at this time Western oil companies began to actively look for partners in Russia. During a visit to British Petroleum facilities in the United Kingdom in 1990 Alekperov personally headed the Russian delegation at the negotiations. Rondo Fehlberg, an executive at BP, told NY Times that Alekperov took control of the agenda during that 1990 trip, sternly asking the BP executives to explain how a modern oil company should be set up.

=== LUKoil ===
In April 1993, Langepas-Uray-Kogalymneft became the joint-stock company LUKOIL, and Alekperov became its president and chairman of the board. By 2002 Alekperov owned 10.4% of the company.

In 2000, Alekperov resigned as head of the board of directors of Lukoil, but retained his position as president of the company. In May 2008, Alekperov bought 11.13 million shares (1.3%) in Lukoil, thereby increasing his stake to 20.4% and becoming the company&#x27;s largest shareholder.

&quot;LUKoil&quot; was the first Russian company to acquire an American company. In November 2000, &quot;LUKoil&quot; acquired Getty Petroleum Marketing and its 1,300 gas stations in the United States Like many other Russian oligarchs, Alekperov has also moved into banking and media. In May 2006 Alekperov was one of the two main owners of IFD Kapital Group.

During at least three meetings in Turkey and London in 2014 and 2015, executives associated with Alekperov&#x27;s firm Lukoil allegedly questioned persons at the Alexander Nix associated firms SCL Group, which is closely associated with Aleksandr Kogan, and Cambridge Analytica, which is closely associated with Steve Bannon, who supported Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 campaign for President of the United States, and Robert Mercer, who supported Ted Cruz&#x27;s campaign for President of the United States, about how United States election data about American voters could be used to target them according to Christopher Wylie.

In 2018, Alekperov first said in an interview that he was looking for a successor to his position, a staff reshuffle, he said, could take place at the company in 2023.

Alekperov is on the 2017 list of Russian &quot;oligarchs&quot; named in the CAATSA unclassified report to the U.S. Congress.

=== International sanctions ===
In April 2022, following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, Alekperov was sanctioned by Australia and the United Kingdom. On 21 April, Lukoil issued a statement saying that Alekperov had stepped down and resigned from the board of directors after 29 years.

In May 2022, Canada also imposed sanctions on Alekperov. In October 2022, New Zealand sanctioned Alekperov.

==Personal life==
Alekperov is married to Larisa Victorovna Alekperova and has a son Yusuf born in 1990. In 2023 he founded the WellTech company, which is engaged in the repair of LUKOIL wells.

Alekperov&#x27;s hobby is numismatics. The exact composition of his collection is unknown, but according to some reports, it is one of the three largest private collections in Russia. According to Forbes, Alekperov&#x27;s private Museum of Numismatics has more than 700 coins on display, which is about a quarter of the entire collection. It consists mainly of gold coins, from antiquity to modern Russia, some silver coins, as well as a few platinum coins of the Russian Empire.

== Philanthropy ==
In 2007 Alekperov founded The Foundation &quot;Our Future&quot; to promote social entrepreneurship in Russia.

Alekperov has repeatedly stated publicly and has confirmed that, according to his will, his stake in Lukoil (over 20% of the company) will be transferred to a specially created charitable foundation.

In 2020 coronavirus pandemic, Lukoil has donated more than RUB 652 million in 22 Russian regions and almost $900 000 dollars in its operation countries abroad. Alekperov also donated RUB 50 million of personal finances to fight coronavirus in the Republic of Komi.

== Awards and honorary titles ==

Alekperov was the first Russian citizen who received the Woodrow Wilson Award. He was honored in 2005 for achievements in corporate citizenship.

On 31 August 2020, ahead of Vagit Alekperov&#x27;s 70th jubilee, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev awarded him with the &quot;Dostlug&quot; Order for his special services rendered to the development of mutual relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation.

On 4 May 2022, Alekperov received the Order &quot;For Merit to the Fatherland&quot; of the first degree for &quot;great contribution to the development of the fuel and energy complex and many years of diligent work&quot;.

Vagit Alekperov is also a full member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences.

<text>Big Top Pee-wee is a 1988 American comedy film directed by Randal Kleiser. A standalone sequel to &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; (1985), the film stars Paul Reubens reprising his role as Pee-wee Herman, with Susan Tyrrell, Kris Kristofferson, Penelope Ann Miller and Valeria Golino in supporting roles. The original music score is composed by Danny Elfman, who could not re-use themes from his &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; score, due to contractual restrictions. The film was released on July 22, 1988, and grossed $15 million against a $20 million budget. Another standalone sequel, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Holiday&quot;, was released in 2016.

==Plot==
Pee-wee Herman lives an idyllic life on a farm with his assistant Vance, a talking pig. There he grows vegetables, dreams of being a famous singer, has a daily lunch with his fiancée, school teacher Winnie Johnson, and conducts agronomical experiments in a secure greenhouse. One day after lunch with Winnie, he walks into Mr. Ryan&#x27;s general store to order a sandwich; however, his quirky personality is barely tolerated by the townsfolk. The local sheriff arrives at the store and warns of a large storm approaching town. Pee-wee rushes home and puts his farm animals into shelter.

After the storm ends, Pee-wee emerges from his storm shelter to discover that an entire traveling circus has been blown into his backyard. He befriends the ringmaster Mace Montana and falls for trapeze artist Gina Piccolapupula, the circus&#x27;s star attraction. Winnie catches Pee-wee just as he shares his first kiss with Gina, and both women shun him for two-timing them. Pee-wee calls off his engagement to Winnie and convinces Gina that he truly loves her, whereupon she warms up to him again and they begin a romantic relationship. Winnie forgives Pee-wee after finding that she would much rather date all four of Gina&#x27;s brothers at once.

Pee-wee attempts to join the circus, but cannot perform any circus acts. Gina tells Pee-wee about her deceased father, Papa Piccolapupula, a famous aerialist who died attempting something called the &quot;Spiral of Death.&quot; She suggests that Pee-wee should try walking the tightrope in his honor.

The curmudgeonly town elders, meanwhile, hate the circus and want it gone. Mace attempts to placate them by inventing a new show saluting the American Farm. The sheriff will have none of it, though, and threatens to arrest Pee-wee on various trumped-up charges if the circus does not leave immediately. Mace capitulates and sadly tells the circus performers to begin packing up.

Pee-wee recalls one of his agronomical experiments, a serum that, when applied to one of his other experiments, a hot-dog tree, made the hot dogs reverse their growth and shrink to the size of cocktail weiners. He feigns repentance to the town elders and feeds them the serum-laced cocktail weiners, causing them to become children and lose their adult memories. With no obstacle remaining, the circus performs their new American Farm show for the townspeople (including the former elders), and Pee-wee walks the tightrope.

==Cast==
==Production==
Following the success of the 1985 Warner Bros. film &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, Paul Reubens signed a development deal with Paramount Pictures to write, produce, and/or direct additional projects for the character of Pee-wee Herman. &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot; was the first project in the deal to go into production.

The Paramount production was directed by Randal Kleiser and written by Paul Reubens and George McGrath. Reubens also co-produced the film with Debra Hill. Filming locations included Disney&#x27;s Golden Oak Ranch in Newhall, California, and the auditorium at Hart High School in Santa Clarita. &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot; was Kleiser&#x27;s first movie for Paramount since 1978&#x27;s &quot;Grease&quot;.

During a 1988 television special, Herman acknowledged the long hours of circus training undertaken by the film&#x27;s actors and that they spent a year and a half working on the movie. He also humorously compared himself as an actor to James Cagney and Spencer Tracy and ended by saying that &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot; was &quot;at least as good as &quot;Police Academy&quot;.&quot;

==Release and reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 36% rating based on 22 reviews, with the site&#x27;s critical consensus stating: &quot;Its endearingly oddball lead character gives it his all, but &quot;Big Top Pee-Wee&quot; simply lacks the whimsical magic of its predecessor.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 42 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews.

Roger Ebert gave the film two stars in his print review for &quot;The Chicago Sun Times&quot;, writing the film was &quot;not as magical&quot; as the first film in the series. Ebert and colleague Gene Siskel both gave the film a &quot;thumbs down&quot; on their television program &quot;At the Movies&quot;. In a comparison to previous appearances of the &quot;Pee-wee&quot; character, Ebert claimed that what had made &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; and &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; great was &quot;the characters in those have absolutely no connection with reality whatsoever, and that is why they were so enduring and enjoyable&quot;. Caryn James of The New York Times criticized the film for making Pee-wee &quot;slightly less eccentric&quot; and said the &quot;new, lukewarm, compromised Pee-wee is remarkably unfunny.&quot; The negative reviews reflected the film&#x27;s performance at the box office, where it grossed $15,122,324, suffering from competition with &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Coming to America&quot;, and the re-issue of &quot;Bambi&quot;, among other summer releases. In 2010, Paul Reubens said that Paramount terminated his development deal and evicted him from his office on their lot the day after the movie&#x27;s disappointing opening weekend.

The film was followed by another standalone sequel, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Holiday&quot; (2016).

<text>The following were the Government Delegates for Poland (&quot;Delegat Rządu na Kraj&quot;) during World War II:
* Cyryl Ratajski (&quot;Wartski&quot;)— November 1939 (officially, from December 1940) – August 1942; died October 19, 1943.
* Jan Piekałkiewicz (&quot;Juliański&quot;)—until February 19, 1943; arrested by the Gestapo, and killed in the Pawiak prison on June 19, 1943.
* Jan Stanisław Jankowski (&quot;Sobol&quot;)—until February 1945; arrested by the NKVD on February 28, 1945, tried in the Trial of the Sixteen, and killed in a Soviet prison on February 13, 1953.
* Stefan Korboński (&quot;Zieliński&quot;)—until June 1945. Emigrated, and died on April 23, 1989.
* Jerzy Braun-from June 1945; arrested in 1948; emigrated in 1965 to Italy.

The above Delegates were officially administering the General Government from an office in Warsaw, but eventually they ended administering the entire occupied Poland, as posts for Delegates for territories annexed to Germany and territories annexed to the Soviet Union were not able to develop properly.
* Adolf Bniński was the Delegate for the territories annexed by Germany; he held this position from December 1940 till his arrest in July 1941
* Leon Mikołajczyk was Bniński&#x27;s successor; after his arrest, in February 1942 the Delegate Office in Poznań lost its status as an independent office and became administered by the Warsaw office 
* Władysław Zych was the acting Delegate for the Soviet occupied territories (he was never officially confirmed in this position by the Polish government in exile)

<doc id="965994" wikidata="Q4034744" url="?curid=965994" title="BR Standard Class 9F">
<text>The British Railways Standard Class 9F is a class of steam locomotive designed for British Railways by Robert Riddles. The Class 9F was the last in a series of standardised locomotive classes designed for British Railways during the 1950s, and was intended for use on fast, heavy freight trains over long distances. It was one of the most powerful steam locomotive types ever built for British Railways, and successfully performed its intended duties. The 9F class was given the nickname of &#x27;Spaceship&#x27;, due to its size and shape.

At various times during the 1950s, the 9Fs worked passenger trains with great success, indicating the versatility of the design, sometimes considered to represent the ultimate in British steam development. Several experimental variants were constructed in an effort to reduce costs and maintenance, although these met with varying degrees of success. They were capable of reaching speeds of up to 90 miles per hour (145 km/h).

The total number built was 251, production being shared between Swindon (53) and Crewe Works (198). The last of the class, 92220 &quot;Evening Star&quot;, was the final steam locomotive to be built by British Railways, in 1960. Withdrawals of the class began in 1964, with the final locomotives being withdrawn from service in 1968, the final year of steam traction on British Railways. Nine examples have survived into the preservation era in varying states of repair, including &quot;Evening Star&quot;.

They were generally thought of as very successful locomotives, O. S. Nock stating &quot;The &#x27;9F&#x27; was unquestionably the most distinctive and original of all the British standard steam locomotives, and with little doubt the most successful. They were remarkable in their astonishing capacity for speed as well as their work in heavy freight haulage.&quot;

==Concept and Construction==
===Background===
The British Transport Commission had proposed that the existing steam locomotive fleet be replaced by both diesel and electric traction. However the board of British Railways, which wanted the railways to be completely electrified, ignored the BTC and ordered a new fleet of &#x27;standard&#x27; steam locomotive designs as a stopgap ahead of electrification. Freight was well catered for in terms of locomotive availability after nationalisation in 1948, with a number of heavy freight locomotives built to aid the war effort forming part of British Railways&#x27; inheritance. This consisted of 666 LMS 8F Class and numerous Robert Riddles designed WD Austerity 2-8-0s and WD Austerity 2-10-0s.

It was the Eastern Region&#x27;s Motive Power officer, L.P. Parker, who made the case for a new design of powerful freight locomotive, able to shift heavy loads at fast speeds in round trips between distant destinations within the eight-hour shift of the footplate crew. Riddles took up the challenge, initially designing a locomotive, but settled upon the 2-10-0 wheel arrangement for the increased traction and lower axle load that five coupled axles can provide. The resultant design became one of the most successful, but shortest-lived, locomotive classes ever built in Britain.

===Design features===
The 9F was designed at both Derby and Brighton Works in 1951 to operate freight trains of up to 900 tons (914 tonnes) at 35 mph (56 km/h) with maximum fuel efficiency. The original proposal was for a boiler from the BR Standard Class 7 &quot;Britannia&quot; , adapting it to a wheel arrangement but Riddles eventually settled upon a 2-10-0 type because it had been used successfully on some of his previous Austerity locomotives. Distributing the adhesive weight over five axles gave a maximum axle load of only 15 tons, 10 cwt. The driving wheels were in diameter. However, in order to clear the rear coupled wheels, the grate had to be set higher, thus reducing firebox volume. There were many problems associated with locomotives of such a long wheelbase, but these were solved by the design team through a series of compromises. The centre driving wheels had no flanges, and those on the second and fourth coupled wheels were reduced in depth. This enabled the locomotive to round curves of only radius. As on all other BR standard steam locomotives, the leading wheels were in diameter.

===Construction history===
Introduced in January 1954, the class comprised 251 locomotives, of which 53 were constructed at Swindon Works, and 198 at Crewe Works. The locomotives were numbered 92000-92250. The last member of the class was constructed at Swindon in 1960, the 999th &quot;BR Standard&quot; to be constructed, and the last steam locomotive to be built by British Railways. To mark the occasion, a competition was run within the Western Region of British Railways to choose an apt name, and the locomotive was given the name and number of 92220 &quot;Evening Star&quot;. Many of the class lasted only a few years in service before withdrawal when steam traction ended on the mainline in Britain. Withdrawals of the class from everyday service began in May 1964, and had been completed by June 1968.

==Variations==
The 9F was used as a proving ground for a variety of technical innovations intended to provide improvements in efficiency, power or cost.

===Franco-Crosti boiler===

Ten locomotives (numbers 92020-92029) were built in 1955 with the Franco-Crosti boiler which incorporated a combustion gas feed water preheater that recuperated low-grade residual heat. In the 9F version, this took the form of a single cylindrical water drum running along the underside of the main boiler barrel. The standard chimney on top of the smokebox was only used during lighting up. In normal working the gases went through firetubes inside the preheater drum that led to a second smokebox situated beneath the boiler from which there emerged a chimney on the right-hand side, just forward of the firebox. In the event, the experiment did not deliver the hoped-for benefits, and efficiency was not increased sufficiently to justify the cost and complexity. Moreover, conditions were unpleasant on the footplate in a cross-wind, this in spite of the later provision of a small deflector plate forward of the chimney. These problems led to the subsequent removal of the preheater drum, although the locomotives did retain the original main smokebox with its distinctive look.

===Westinghouse Pump Variation===
The ten 9F locomotives (92060-92066 and 92097–92099) allocated to Tyne Dock on the NER were fitted with Westinghouse Pumps to drive the pneumatic doors on the 56 ton ore hopper wagons which operated on the heavily inclined Consett line to the Consett Iron Company. These additional pumps allowed automatic discharging of the ore train, consisting of nine hoppers, in under a minute at Consett.

===Mechanical stoker and blastpipe variation===
Locomotive numbers 92165–92167 were built with a mechanical stoker, which was a helical screw that conveyed coal from the tender to the firebox, where it would be directed to the required part of the grate by high-pressure steam jets controlled by the fireman. The stoker made higher steaming rates possible, and it was hoped that mechanical stoking might enable the burning of low-grade coal. It was relatively inefficient, and the locomotives used in this trial were rebuilt to the normal configuration. Simply supplying more low grade coal than a fireman could do by hand did not provide efficient burning. Trials found that the maximum coal delivery rate of the mechanical stoker was slightly faster than firing by hand, and it could maintain that maximum for hours at a time when a fireman would tire. However, that was of little practical benefit in actual service, because even a long-distance freight train would frequently stop to allow faster trains to pass or would be held at signals. For the short periods when maximum firing rate was needed, a skilled fireman was more than sufficient. The success of mechanical stokers on North American railroads was mainly because the locomotives were significantly larger (with a commensurately greater demand for coal) and many routes required hours of supplying coal at a rate beyond the physical limit of a single fireman.

Number 92250 was equipped with a Giesl ejector, which divided the exhaust steam between seven nozzles arranged in a row on the locomotive&#x27;s longitudinal axis, and directed into a narrow fan-shaped ejector that more intimately mixed it with the smokebox gases than is the case of an ordinary chimney. That offered the same level of draught for a reduced level of exhaust back-pressure or, alternatively, increased draught with no performance loss elsewhere. Again, claims were made about the potential benefits, and 92250 retained the variant chimney until withdrawal, although no benefit was noticeable.

The only modification which did deliver any noticeable benefit was the fitting of 92178 with a double blastpipe and chimney during its construction. Following delivery in September 1957, it was subjected to extensive testing, both in the Rugby Locomotive Testing Station and on service trains. After the completion of the tests in February 1958, it was decided to fit all 9Fs built subsequently with double blastpipes and chimneys — they were numbers 92183 onwards, as well as 92165–7. The modification was also installed on 92000/1/2/5 and 92006. That allowed the engines to steam slightly more freely and thus generate higher power ranges.

==Operational details==

The 9F turned out to be the best of the Standard classes, and one of the finest steam locomotives ever designed in Britain in terms of its capacity to haul heavy loads over long distances. It was highly effective at its designed purpose, hauling heavy, fast freight trains, and was used all over the British railway network. This was exemplified when in September 1982, preserved engine 92203 &quot;Black Prince&quot; set the record for the heaviest train ever hauled by a steam locomotive in Britain, when it started a 2,178-ton train at a Foster Yeoman quarry in Somerset, UK.

The 9F also proved its worth as a passenger locomotive, adept at fast running despite its small driving wheels, and for a time was a frequent sight on the Somerset and Dorset Railway, where its power and high proportion of adhesive weight were well suited to coping with the 1 in 50 ruling gradient on the Bath extension. On one occasion, a 9F was set to haul an express passenger train, in place of the normal LNER pacific, from Grantham to King&#x27;s Cross. An enthusiast aboard the train timed the run and noted that twice the speed exceeded 90 mph. The driver was afterwards told that he was only supposed to keep time, &quot;not break the bloody sound barrier!&quot;. He replied that the engine had no speedometer, and that it ran so smoothly at high speeds that he just let it run as fast as felt safe. Nor was this the only instance of 9Fs reaching high speeds. However, concerns that the high rotational speeds involved in fast running could cause excessive wear and tear to the plain-bearing running gear prompted the British Railways management to stop using 9Fs on express passenger trains.

In 1960, 9Fs from the Western Region&#x27;s Cardiff Canton shed (code 86C) were also regularly made ready as &#x27;standby&#x27; locomotives - in case of failure of the more usual Britannias - on the region&#x27;s flagship Paddington-Cardiff/Swansea passenger express trains, the &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Capitals United Express&quot;. Locomotives used on these duties included No. 92220 &quot;Evening Star&quot;, the only 9F to be given a name and to be painted in the express passenger livery of lined Brunswick green. On 8 September 1962 No. 92220 also hauled the last &quot;Pines Express&quot; to use the Somerset and Dorset route.

Like other primarily goods locomotives, British Railways&#x27; fleet of 9Fs also saw extensive passenger service in hauling Saturday &#x27;Holiday Specials&#x27;, especially in the North East and Western regions.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 19 November 1958, locomotive No. 92187 was hauling a freight train which overran signals and was in a rear-end collision with another at , Hertfordshire. A third freight train, hauled by Ex-LNER Class V2 2-6-2 No. 60885, ran into the wreckage.
*On 7 April 1964, locomotive No. 92161 was hauling a freight train that was derailed at Howe &amp; Co&#x27;s Signalbox, Cumberland due to a combination of defects on a wagon, excessive speed and minor track defects.

==Livery and numbering==

The class were painted British Railways Freight Black without lining. The British Railways crest was located on the tender side. Given the British Railways power classification 9F, the locomotives were numbered in the 92xxx series, between 92000 and 92250. Because of its status as the last steam locomotive constructed at Swindon, No. 92220 was named &quot;Evening Star&quot; and turned out in British Railways Brunswick Green livery, which was usually reserved for express passenger locomotives. Several locomotives allocated to the Western Region, including no. 92220, bore a blue spot on the cab side below the number, to denote the axle loading under the former GWR&#x27;s system of weight classification.

==Preservation==

Nine Standard Class 9F 2-10-0 tender locomotives survived withdrawal from mainline service into preservation: &quot;Evening Star&quot; became part of the National Collection; eight others were bought directly from BR or from Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, South Wales. Only six members of the class have been restored to running order. 92240 was the first of the class to steam in preservation after restoration work in 1990. Engines from both builders have survived with three Crewe-built engines and six Swindon-built engines. The majority of the class have double chimneys but 92134 is the sole survivor fitted with a single chimney.
† In most cases, names are not historically accurate; i.e. they have all been applied in preservation except 92220 which, being the last steam locomotive to be built for BR, was named &quot;Evening Star&quot; during its unveiling in 1960. Some locomotives may also have names, but marked names indicate that the locomotive is not presently wearing them.

Of the nine surviving members of the class, two have run on the main line: nos. 92203 &quot;Black Prince&quot; &amp; 92220 &quot;Evening Star&quot;. Due to the engines&#x27; flangeless centre driving wheels, there is a concern that the raised check rails on modern pointwork might cause a derailment, so the class (alongside other 2-10-0 locomotives) is currently prohibited from operating on the main line – including the Esk Valley Line from Battersby to Whitby, used by the North Yorkshire Moors Railway on their Grosmont to Whitby trains alongside the regular passenger services on the route.

==Models==
===OO scale===
The erstwhile Kitmaster company produced an unpowered polystyrene injection moulded model kit for scale. In late 1962, the Kitmaster brand was sold by its parent company (Rosebud Dolls) to Airfix, which transferred the moulding tools to their own factory; the 9F class was among the re-introduced former Kitmaster range. In time, the moulding tools passed on to Dapol, which also produced the kit. During the 1960s a cast white metal chassis kit in the Simplas range to motorise the model was made available by Wilro Models of Hackney, London.

In late 1971, Tri-ang Hornby introduced a 00 scale Ready to Run model of this locomotive; it continued to be produced after the rebranding as Hornby Railways.

===N scale===
In the 1980s Minitrix produced two ready-to-run British N gauge models of the class, including a model of 92220 &quot;Evening Star&quot;. 

In 2008, Dapol introduced a British N gauge model of locomotive 92100. The following year, Dapol were commissioned to produce a British N gauge ready-to-run model of 92203 by TMC.

==In fiction==
Murdoch from &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; is based on a BR Standard Class 9F locomotive.

<doc id="965995" wikidata="Q363691" url="?curid=965995" title="Ian Richardson">
<text>Ian William Richardson (7 April 19349 February 2007) was a Scottish actor. He was best known for his portrayal of machiavellian Conservative politician Francis Urquhart in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;House of Cards&quot; (1990–1995) television trilogy, as well as the pivotal spy Bill Haydon in &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (1979). His other notable screen work included a portrayal of Sherlock Holmes in two films (&quot;The Sign of Four&quot; and &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;), as well as significant roles in &quot;Brazil&quot;, &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;, and &quot;Dark City&quot;.

Richardson was also a leading stage actor, well known for his Shakespearean works as well as his portrayal of Jean-Paul Marat in the Broadway production of &quot;Marat/Sade&quot;.

==Early life==
Richardson was born in Edinburgh, the only son and eldest of three children of John Richardson (1909–1990), a manager at the McVitie &amp; Price factory (where he and his wife met, and, according to his son, where John invented the Jaffa cake), and Margaret (&quot;Peggy&quot;) Pollock (1910–1988), née Drummond. He was educated in the city, at Balgreen Primary School, Tynecastle High School and George Heriot&#x27;s School. He first appeared on stage at the age of 14, in an amateur production of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. The director encouraged his talent but warned that he would need to lose his Scottish accent to progress as an actor. His mother arranged elocution lessons, and he became a stage manager with the semi-professional Edinburgh People&#x27;s Theatre.

After National Service in the Army (part of which he spent as an announcer and drama director with the British Forces Broadcasting Service) he obtained a place at the College of Dramatic Arts in Glasgow. After a period at the Old Rep (also known as the Birmingham Repertory Theatre), he appeared with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), of which he was a founding member, from 1960 to 1975.

==Stage work==
Although he later gained his highest profile in film and television work such as &quot;House of Cards&quot; (1990), Richardson was primarily a classical stage actor. His first engagement after training was with Birmingham Repertory Theatre, where his performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot; led to an offer of a place with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He was a versatile member of the company for more than 15 years, playing villainy, comedy and tragedy to equal effect. He was The Herald in Peter Brook&#x27;s production of &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; in London in 1964; in the New York City transfer he took the lead role of Jean-Paul Marat (and so became the first actor to appear nude on the Broadway stage), a performance he repeated for the 1967 film &quot;Marat/Sade&quot;.

In 1972, he appeared in the musical &quot;Trelawney&quot;, with which the Bristol Old Vic reopened after its refurbishment. It proved a great success, transferring to London, first to the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre and later to the Prince of Wales Theatre. Richardson played the hero, Tom Wrench, a small-part player who wants to write about &quot;real people&quot;. He had a song, &quot;Walking On&quot;, lamenting his lack of scope in the company, in which he explains that as a &quot;walking gentleman&quot; he will be forever &quot;walking on&quot;, whilst Rose Trelawney will go on to be a star.

While at the RSC, Richardson played leading roles in many productions for director John Barton. These included the title role in &quot;Coriolanus&quot; (1967), Cassius in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1968), Angelo in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; (1970) and Iachimo in &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. Work for other directors at Stratford included the title role in &quot;Pericles&quot; (1969), directed by Terry Hands; the title role in &quot;Richard III&quot; (1975), directed by Barry Kyle; and Berowne in David Jones&#x27; production of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; (1973). Richardson cited the role of Berowne as one of his all-time favorite parts. Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; (alternating the parts of the king and Bolingbroke with Richard Pasco) in 1974, and repeated in New York and London in the following year, was hugely celebrated.

A significant Shakespearean cameo role was a brief performance as Hamlet in the gravedigger scene as part of episode six, &quot;Protest and Communication&quot;, of Kenneth Clark&#x27;s &quot;Civilisation&quot; television series in 1969. This was performed at Kirby Hall in Northamptonshire with Patrick Stewart as Horatio and Ronald Lacey as the gravedigger.

On leaving the RSC, he played Professor Henry Higgins in the 20th anniversary Broadway revival of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1976) and received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical and a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. He also appeared on Broadway as onstage narrator in the original production of Edward Albee&#x27;s play &quot;Lolita&quot; (1981), an adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s book that was not critically well received.

In 1995, he played &quot;The Miser&quot; at Chichester, and in 1997 he played &quot;The Magistrate&quot;, also at Chichester, which transferred to the Savoy Theatre.

In 2002, Richardson joined Derek Jacobi, Donald Sinden and Diana Rigg in an international tour of &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot;, and this was repeated the following year with Dame Janet Suzman in the female roles. A Canadian tour substituted Alan Howard for Jacobi and Vanessa Redgrave for Suzman. He also appeared in &quot;The Creeper&quot; by Pauline Macaulay at the Playhouse Theatre in London, and on tour. His last stage appearance was in 2006 as Sir Epicure Mammon in &quot;The Alchemist&quot; at the National Theatre in London.

==Films and television==

===Early career===
In 1963, he played Le Beau in Michael Elliott&#x27;s television production of &quot;As You Like It&quot;, playing alongside Vanessa Redgrave. In 1964, he played Antipholus of Ephesus in &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; as part of the &quot;Festival&quot; television series. In 1966, he played Jean-Paul Marat in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Peter Weiss&#x27; &quot;Marat/Sade&quot;, directed by Peter Brook. In 1967, he played The Constable in &quot;A Man Takes a Drink&quot; as part of a television series entitled &quot;The Revenue Men&quot;. He played Bertram in John Barton&#x27;s television version of &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; in 1968, as well as playing Oberon in the Peter Hall film of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. He took part in the television production of John Mortimer&#x27;s &quot;A Voyage Round My Father&quot; in &quot;Plays of Today&quot; in 1969 as well as appeared in the television adaptation of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (1969).

He played one musical role on film, the Priest in &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, the 1972 screen version of the Broadway musical. Also in 1972, he played Anthony Beavis in the television series &quot;Eyeless in Gaza&quot;.
He also appeared in BBC radio plays, notably in &#x27;The House on the Strand&#x27; by Daphne du Maurier, in 1973.

In 1974, he played King Richard II/Bolingbroke in &quot;Richard II&quot;, part of the &quot;Camera Three&quot; television series. In 1978, he played Robespierre in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play of the Month&quot; production of &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot;. In 1979, he played Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery in the TV miniseries &quot;Ike&quot;.

His first major role was his appearance as Bill Haydon (&quot;Tailor&quot;) in the BBC adaptation of &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (1979). He again played the part of Field Marshal Montgomery in &quot;Churchill and the Generals&quot; in 1979, a BBC television videotaped play concerning the relationship between Winston Churchill and generals of the Allied forces between 1940 and 1945.

In the 1980s, he became well known as Major Neuheim in the award-winning &quot;Private Schulz&quot; and as Sir Godber Evans in Channel 4&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot;. Richardson also performed the role of Sherlock Holmes for two of six planned television movies, &quot;The Sign of Four&quot; and &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, in 1983, which were both critically acclaimed. He appeared in &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985) and played Jawaharlal Nehru in the television serial, &quot;Lord Mountbatten: The Last Viceroy&quot; (1986). He portrayed Anthony Blunt, the Soviet spy and Surveyor of The King&#x27;s Pictures in the BBC film &quot;Blunt: the Fourth Man&quot; (1986) opposite Anthony Hopkins as Guy Burgess. In 1988, he played Edward Spencer, the eccentric and oblivious English landowner in 1920s Ireland in &quot;Troubles&quot;, from J. G. Farrell&#x27;s award-winning novel. In 1987, he played a variation on this role, when he portrayed the Bishop of Motopo in the non-musical television film &quot;Monsignor Quixote&quot;, based on Graham Greene&#x27;s modernised take on &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. He played Sir Nigel Irvine in John Mackenzie&#x27;s adaptation of Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot; (1987).

Richardson also appeared in commercials for Grey Poupon Dijon mustard in the United States in his role as Prime Minister Francis Urquhart, opposite Paul Eddington as Prime Minister Jim Hacker.

===Later career===
Richardson&#x27;s most acclaimed television role was as Machiavellian politician Francis Urquhart in the BBC adaptation of Michael Dobbs&#x27;s &quot;House of Cards&quot; trilogy. He won the BAFTA Best Television Actor Award for his portrayal in the first series, &quot;House of Cards&quot; (1990), and was nominated for both of the sequels &quot;To Play the King&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Final Cut&quot; (1995).

In 1989, he also starred in a TV production of &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; with Emma Thompson and Gordon Jackson. He received another BAFTA nomination for his role as Falkland Islands governor Sir Rex Hunt in the film &quot;An Ungentlemanly Act&quot; (1992), and played corrupt politician Michael Spearpoint, British Director of the European Economic Community, in the satirical series &quot;The Gravy Train&quot; and &quot;The Gravy Train Goes East&quot;. He narrated the BBC docudrama &quot;A Royal Scandal&quot; (1996).

Other roles in this period include Polonius in &quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; (1990), Sir Mason Harwood in &quot;Year of the Comet&quot; (1992), the French ambassador in &quot;M. Butterfly&quot; (1993), Martin Landau&#x27;s butler in &quot;B*A*P*S&quot; (1997), a malevolent alien in &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998), The Kralahome in &quot;The King and I&quot; (1999), Cruella de Vil&#x27;s Barrister, Mr. Torte QC, in the live-action film &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot; (2000), and a corrupt aristocrat in &quot;From Hell&quot; (2001).

In 1999, Richardson became known to a young audience as the main character Stephen Tyler in both series of the family drama &quot;The Magician&#x27;s House&quot; (1999–2000). Following this he played Lord Groan in the major BBC production &quot;Gormenghast&quot; (2000), and later that year he starred in the BBC production &quot;Murder Rooms: The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2000–2001) (screened in PBS&#x27;s &quot;Mystery!&quot; series in the US), playing Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s mentor, Dr. Joseph Bell, a role he welcomed as an opportunity to play a character from his native Edinburgh. He once more returned to fantasy in the recurring role of the villainous Canon Black in the short-lived BBC cult series &quot;Strange&quot; (2003).

In 2005, he took on the role of the Lord Chancellor in the television drama &quot;Bleak House&quot;. He also played the Judge in the family-based film, &quot;The Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby&quot; (2005). Additionally, in that year, he appeared in ITV&#x27;s main Christmas drama &quot;The Booze Cruise 2&quot;, playing Marcus Foster, a slimy upper class businessman forced to spend time with &quot;the lower classes&quot;. He returned to this role for a sequel the following Easter.

In June 2006, he was made an honorary Doctor of the University of Stirling. The honour was conferred on him by the university&#x27;s Chancellor, fellow actor Dame Diana Rigg.

In December 2006, Richardson starred in Sky One&#x27;s two-part adaptation of the Terry Pratchett novel &quot;Hogfather&quot; (1997). He voiced the main character of the novel, Death, who steps in to take over the role of the Father Christmas-like Hogfather. The DVD of that miniseries, released shortly after his death, opens with a dedication to his memory.

His final film appearance was as Judge Langlois in &quot;Becoming Jane&quot; (2007), released shortly after his death.

During the last 15 years of his life he appeared five times on television acting opposite his son Miles Richardson, though this was usually with one or the other in a minor role.

==Death==
Richardson died in his sleep of a heart attack on the morning of 9 February 2007, aged 72. He was survived by his wife, Maroussia Frank, an actress, and two sons, one of whom, Miles, is an actor. Richardson&#x27;s body was cremated. His ashes were placed in the foundation of the auditorium of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford during renovations in 2008.

==Tributes==
Helen Mirren dedicated her 2006 Best Actress BAFTA award for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in the film &quot;The Queen&quot; to Richardson. In her acceptance speech she said that without his support early in her career, she might not have been so successful, before breaking down and leaving the stage. Other tributes and reminiscences by Richardson&#x27;s colleagues are offered in a memoir by Sharon Mail, &quot;We Could Possibly Comment: Ian Richardson Remembered&quot; (2009).

==Honours==
Richardson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1989 New Year Honours.

<text>The France national rugby league team represents France in international rugby league matches. They are referred to as &quot;les Chanticleers&quot; or less commonly as &quot;les Tricolores&quot;. The team is run under the auspices of the Fédération Française de Rugby à XIII.

The French rugby league team first played in 1934 on a tour of England. They have taken part in all World Cups, 16 in total, with the first being held in 1954 in France. They have never won the title but finished runners-up in both 1954 and 1968. These are often considered the glory years of French rugby league as from the 1950s to the 1970s the team were strong and regularly beat Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain. Since those days, &quot;les Chanticleers&quot; have not done as well with their nadir occurring at the 1995 World Cup when they failed to win a single match.

In 2006, the Perpignan based team Catalans Dragons entered Super League, and have since produced a number of top-class French players. Recent successes of the French national team include reaching the quarter-finals of the 2000 and 2013 Rugby League World Cups, and participating in the 2009 Rugby League Four Nations. At the most recent World Cup in 2022, France failed to qualify for the quarter-finals after being eliminated at the group stage.

Currently, France are ranked eighth in the world. In Europe alone they are ranked second, ahead of Lebanon, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy, but behind their main rival, England.

== History ==

===1930s===

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1933, England and Australia played in Paris – the first game of rugby league football in France. The match was one-sided, with Australia winning 63-13 in front of a crowd of about 5,000, but the seed was sown. French rugby union players, disgruntled that France had been suspended from the Five Nations Championship, formed the &quot;Ligue Francaise de Rugby à XIII&quot; on 6 April 1934. Jean Galia, a former rugby union international and champion boxer, led France on a six-match tour of England in 1934 and they recorded their first win in Kingston upon Hull. The national team&#x27;s first game was in Paris on 15 April 1934, losing 21-32 to England in front of a crowd of 20,000. By 1939, the French League had 225 clubs and the national side won the 1938–39 European Rugby League Championship where they became the first French team in any sport to beat England at home.

===1940s===

The game of rugby league suffered in France during the Second World War, as administrators had rugby league banned. Some players and officials of the sport were punished (not reinstated in the French rugby union), whilst the total assets of the rugby league and its clubs were handed over to the union. After the war the French game was re-established and the French became one of rugby league&#x27;s major powers, competing in the Rugby League World Cup and in major international series against Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand, despite continuing persecution (including remaining unable to call itself rugby until 1989, being called &quot;jeu à XIII&quot; (the game [played] in 13), which was an expression coined by Jean Gallia). In 1949, they became the first French sporting team to win at Wembley Stadium.

===1950s===

In 1951 France embarked on their first ever tour of Australasia, coached by Robert Samatan and led by the legendary chain-smoking fullback, Puig Aubert. Their flamboyant style of unorthodox attacking rugby attracted huge crowds. When the two nations met for the first Test, the match became the first &quot;all ticket&quot; international to be staged at the Sydney Cricket Ground, and attracted a crowd of over 60,000. On Saturday 30 June 1951, Australia secured a hard-fought second Test victory over France in Brisbane by 23 points to 11. The third Test took place at Sydney Cricket Ground three weeks later before a crowd of 67,009. Late tries from Duncan Hall and Brian Davies could not prevent the Kangaroos from suffering an embarrassing 35-14 defeat. France played 28 matches during the three-month tour, winning 21 matches, drawing twice and losing just five times.

In November 1951, France met &quot;Other Nationalities&quot; in an International Championship match at the Boulevard, Hull which became known as the &quot;Battle of the Boulevard&quot;. Other Nationalities won 17-14 but the match centred on the behaviour of Edouard Ponsinet, who was involved in most of the violence that happened at the game. The Other Nationalities were down to eleven players at one stage, with Arthur Clues being the most serious casualty, hospitalised with head injuries. Eventually Ponsinet was sent off, ten minutes from time after breaking the nose of Jeff Burke. Despite this defeat France went on to retain the title with home victories over England and Wales.

In the 1954 World Cup, which was the first of either rugby code and was instigated by France, Les Tricolores defeated both Australia and New Zealand, and drew with Great Britain to reach the final. This was the closest they went to getting their hands on the World Cup, going down narrowly, 16-12, to Great Britain in the final in Parc des Princes. France donated the original World Cup trophy, but they have never won it.

France repeated the success of their 1951 tour in 1955, with even bigger attendances greeting the team. Puig Aubert had broken his arm just prior to the touring party leaving and did not tour. Despite this, France played splendidly to win the second test in Brisbane (in a spectacular game 29-28 before 45,000 fans at the Brisbane Cricket Ground) and the third test at the SCG. The 1951 and 1955 French sides that toured Australia are still regarded as two of the strongest sides ever to tour that country.

In the 1957 World Cup, held in Australia, the winner was decided by finishing top of the table with no final being played. France finished last, winning one match against New Zealand. History was made when the returning French and British squads visited South Africa and played a series of exhibition matches in Benoni, Durban and East London, all of which were won by the British.

=== 1960s ===
In the 1960 Rugby League World Cup France failed to win a match, and finished last for the second consecutive time.

On Sunday 8 December 1963, France defeated the Australians in the first Test of a three Test series during the Kangaroo tour of Europe. The match was held in Bordeaux.

France regained strength as the decade went on - defeating Australia quite comprehensively in the 1967-1968 series played in France, winning two games and drawing one.

The French reached the final of the 1968 Rugby League World Cup, the last time they have achieved that feat. They beat both Great Britain and New Zealand to qualify, but lost to Australia in Sydney, and so finished runners-up again.

===1970s===

France managed one victory in the 1970 Rugby League World Cup, a narrow win over Australia, who went on to win the Cup in the final. In 1972 France hosted the sixth World Cup and again only got the one win, in the opening match against New Zealand. The trend of underperforming in the World Cup continued for the French in the expanded 1975 tournament in which they got a lone win over Wales and a draw against New Zealand. Two years later in the 1977 World Cup they did not win a single match. But then on the 1978 Kangaroo tour, France beat Australia 13-10 and 11-10. This was Australia&#x27;s last defeat in an international series or competition until the 2005 Tri-Nations.

===1980s===

Rugby league in France went through a riotous period at the beginning of the 1980s. The turbulent period was steadied by the influence of French Rugby League guru Jean-François Bouchet, however poor results followed. From 1985 to 1987 the team were beaten by New Zealand in Perpignan, drew with Great Britain in Avignon and were thrashed 52-0 in Carcassonne by Australia. Away from home they suffered a large defeat against Great Britain in Leeds. The team reached a low point when they were forced to forfeit away World Cup games against Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea in the 1985-88 edition because of lack of funds. Their only World Cup win was against Papua New Guinea in front of 3,500 people in Carcassonne.

===1990s===

In 1990, a Great Britain team including Shaun Edwards, Garry Schofield, Martin Offiah and Denis Betts were embarrassed by a 25-18 loss, France&#x27;s first victory on English soil for 23 years and their last win over Great Britain/England. The team then met Papua New Guinea on Sunday 30 June 1991 in Rabaul, where they were beaten 28-24. On Sunday 7 July 1991, the two sides met again for a World Cup encounter at Danny Leahy Oval, Goroka. The heat and humidity caused France all kinds of problems, but Les Tricolores squeezed home 20-18.

On Sunday 27 October 1991, the first ever Test match involving the Soviet Union took place at the Stade Georges Lyvet, Villeurbanne, near Lyon, France. The Bears were beaten 26-6 by France. The Papua New Guinea national team wound up their 1991 tour of Europe with a World Cup rated Test match against France, which was played on Sunday 24 November at the Stade Albert Domec, Carcassonne. France defeated their visitors 28-14. In the 1995 World Cup France had to play the Samoans three days after taking a physical pounding from the Welsh in Cardiff.

John Kear was briefly in charge of Les Tricolores in 1997.

France took on Italy at the Parc des Sports, Avignon in November 1999. France needed a draw to win the Mediterranean Cup. The Italians, registered a memorable 14-10 victory, which handed the cup to the Lebanon.

===2000s===

France traveled to Pretoria for a match against South Africa on Saturday 3 November 2001. The French were too good for a young and inexperienced South African side. They scored four tries in each half, and won 44-6 after leading 24-0 at half-time.

In 2002, France lost to Lebanon 36–6 in front of 9,713 spectators at Tripoli in the Mediterranean Cup final.
In 2004 the French returned to form with a narrow 20-24 loss to New Zealand and a losing but creditable performance against Australia. In 2005, Les Tricolores played Australia again in Perpignan, suffering a 12-44 defeat. Unlike their last match against Australia, this game was played under normal rules and is considered a regular test match. This was their best performance in an official test match against Australia since 1990.

 Papua New Guinea toured France in the winter of 2007, with France winning both matches. After the tour, a match in Paris was scheduled against New Zealand, who were on their way home from a 3-0 test series defeat by Great Britain. A last minute try secured a 22-14 New Zealand win in front of a decent crowd despite Paris rail strikes. France participated in the 2008 World Cup after being granted automatic qualification. They were drawn in Group B with Scotland and Fiji. Winning only one game and losing two, France finished the tournament in last place.

France participated in the first 2009 Four Nations tournament against England, New Zealand and Australia. The following year, the tournament was held in Australia and New Zealand, with France&#x27;s place being taken by a Pacific qualifier.

===2010s===
With the Four Nations returning to Europe in 2011, France needed to qualify by winning the 2010 European Cup, but failed to do so, with Wales qualifying instead. In 2011 the English team, rather than playing their annual test against France, instead arranged the inaugural 2011 International Origin match.

France participated in the 2013 Rugby League World Cup and hosted some games. They reached the quarter-finals where they were knocked out by England.

In 2014, France played in the 2014 European Cup. They came second in the tournament on points difference, by only 3 points, finishing behind Scotland therefore failing to qualify for the 2016 Four Nations.

In May 2015, France were set to take on South Africa However, the Africans had to withdraw due to the concerns of national contingencies. Therefore, France announced they&#x27;d play Serbia in Saint-Esteve on the 22 May. The French, who were labelled as France &#x27;A&#x27; due to not being a full-strength side, went on to hammer the Serbs by 68 points to 8.

In October 2015, France played in the 2015 European Cup. During the tournament in November, after already confirming before the tournament&#x27;s details were announced, France took on England in Leigh. The match was a warm-up game for England before their end-of-year test-series against New Zealand. The French were hammered by a record 80-point margin.

In August 2016 Richard Agar, who began coaching France at the 2013 World Cup, left the national team. It is believed he left because new Fédération Française de Rugby à XIII president Marc Palanques wants a Frenchman to coach the national team. Aurelien Cologni, who had a temporary spell from 2011-2012, became the new coach.

At the 2017 Rugby League World Cup, France were placed in a strong group, pitted against the likes of England, Lebanon and defending champions Australia. France got off to the worst possible start, suffering a shock loss to Lebanon 29-18 in Canberra. The following two games did not get any better for the French as they were thumped 52-6 by Australia and then suffered another big defeat to their old foes England 36-6 in Perth. They thus failed to move beyond the group stage and were eliminated from the World Cup.

=== 2020s ===

As the winner of the 2018 Rugby League European Championship, France Qualified for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup, their 16th appearance in the competition. In the lead-up to the tournament, France hosted Tonga for a warm-up match, losing 12–48. The match heralded the introduction of the Tas Baitieri Trophy that both teams will contest each time they meet in future matches. It is named after former Australian player Tas Baitieri who became coach of the French national team in the 1980s.
France won its opening game in the 2021 Rugby League World Cup 34–12 against Greece. Unfortunately, they lost their next two games (going down to England 18–42 and then eventual finalists Samoa 4–62). As a result, France did not finish in the top two of their group and therefore failed to proceed to the quarter-finals of the tournament.

==Identity==
===Jersey===
Traditionally, France wears a blue jersey usually complemented by a red and white chevron on the chest, white shorts and red socks, with the team being nicknamed &quot;Les Tricolores&quot;. The uniforms feature the Gallic rooster embroidered on the chest, much like their union counterpart. 
The use of the rooster as badge influenced Eastern Suburbs RLFC, which had uniforms similar to France, to use the rooster as symbol since 1967, being known as Sydney Roosters. Sometimes, France also wears a white jersey in case a colour clash arises.

<text>Vladimir Olegovich Potanin (; born 3 January 1961) is a Russian oligarch. He acquired his wealth notably through the controversial loans-for-shares program in Russia in the early to mid-1990s.

As of 2025, he is one of the wealthiest in Russia and the 72th richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$26.8 billion, according to the &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot;. In the 2025 &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked him with an estimated net worth of US$23.7 billion. As per Forbes list of The Richest People In The World, dated 8 MARCH 2024, Vladimir Potanin ranked #85 with a net worth of $23.7 Billion. 

His long-term business partner was Russian-Israeli oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov until they decided to split in 2007. Subsequently, they put their mutual assets in a holding company, Folletina Trading, until their asset division was agreed upon.

In January 2018, Potanin appeared on the US Treasury&#x27;s &quot;Putin list&quot; of 210 individuals closely associated with Russian president Vladimir Putin. In June 2022, the UK has imposed sanction on Potanin for being one of the major oligarchs in &quot;President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Potanin was born in Moscow, in the former USSR, into a high-ranking Russian communist family. In 1978, he attended the faculty of the International economic relations at Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO), which groomed students for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Upon graduating MGIMO in 1983, he followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and went to work for the all-union foreign trade organization (FTO) Soyuzpromexportfortvort, which was an arm of the Ministry of Foreign Trade.

== Career ==
=== Beginnings (1991–1998) ===
During perestroika, Potanin quit the State&#x27;s structures of Foreign trade and in 1991 created the private association Interros using his knowledge gathered at Ministry of Foreign trade and his previous professional network. In 1993, Potanin became president of the newly formed United Export Import Bank (ONEKSIMbank) () (akas: Uneximbank; Onexim Bank; Oneksimbank). Oneksimbank is the financial twin of MFK and was also known as the ONEKSIMbank-MFK banking group which was also close to Andrey Vavilov.

Potanin was a close supporter of Anatoly Chubais who introduced Potanin to Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

In 1995, Potanin was instrumental in the creation of the &quot;loans for shares&quot; auctions that became a pillar of Russia&#x27;s post-Soviet economic reform. The auctions allowed the selling-off of Russian firms&#x27; assets at below market prices and are regarded as the founding moment of Russia&#x27;s oligarchy. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the auctions plan was regarded in 1999 &quot;almost universally as an act of colossal criminality.&quot;

From 14 August 1996 until 17 March 1997, he worked as First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.

In 1997, Boris Jordan introduced George Soros to Potanin which led to the Soros Group supported by Potanin, Anatoly Chubais, and Alfred Koch to have the controlling stake in the Russian communications monopoly over the Berezovsky-Gusinsky group. One year later Soros admitted that his large investment in Svyazinvest was a mistake.

Since August 1998, Potanin has held the positions of both president and chairman of the board of directors of the Interros Company.

On November 25, 1998, Potanin recommended Boris Jordan to be Chairman of Sidanko which Jordan held until February 1999 when he stepped down.

=== Norilsk Nickel ===
Potanin and his long-term business partner Mikhail Prokhorov acquired Norilsk Nickel (or Nornickel) in the early 1990s under the &quot;loans for shares&quot; scheme, owning between them 54% of the firm. Potanin owned as of 2018 a 34% stake in the company. They streamlined operations and turned Norilsk Nickel into a modern corporation.

==== Dispute with Mikhail Prokhorov ====
In 2007, Potanin split with Prokhorov, citing Prokhorov&#x27;s brief detention by French police over soliciting prostitution as the reason and announced the intent to acquire Prokhorov&#x27;s Norilsk Nickel assets for a reported $1 billion. Prokhorov offered to sell his 25% stake for $15 billion. However, Potanin refused the deal and it never came to pass.

According to a report published by investigative platform Meduza in 2016, Prokhorov turned to Valentin Yumashev, former Russian president Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s chief of staff, to appeal to president Vladimir Putin. Reportedly, Putin &quot;phoned Potanin in Prokhorov&#x27;s presence and chewed him out, saying, &#x27;It&#x27;s dishonest to cheat on partners.&#x27;&quot; Prokhorov ultimately decided to sell his 25% Norilsk stake to RUSAL&#x27;s Oleg Deripaska instead.

In March 2009, he sued Prokhorov for $29 million over a property disagreement in Moscow.

==== Ownership dispute with Oleg Deripaska ====
In 2008, Deripaska reached an agreement with Prokhorov for the acquisition of his Norilsk Nickel stake, against Potanin&#x27;s wishes. In return, Prokhorov acquired 14% of RUSAL.

This sparked an ownership conflict between Deripaska and Potanin that was halted in 2012, when Roman Abramovich stepped in as a peacemaker by acquiring 6.5% of Norilsk and thereby maintaining the balance of power between Deripaska and Potanin. The truce also barred the parties to sell or acquire new stakes. The deal made Potanin CEO of the company, as he owned roughly 30% of Norilsk, about 2% more than Deripaska.

In February 2018, Potanin offered to buy 4% of Abramovich&#x27;s stake. A provisional acquisition agreement was reached in March for Potanin to buy a 2% stake in Norilsk from Abramovich. The purchase was not yet officially approved as of March 2018, pending a court ruling in May that will decide whether the acquisition would breach the 2012 stakeholder agreement. If the purchase is approved, Potanin would own 32.9% of Norilsk against Deripaska&#x27;s 27.8%. In April, Deripaska called off the deal citing sanctions as the reason.

On 28 June 2018 the court ruled against the sale of Abramovich assets to Potanin. It was unknown at the time whether Deripaska would exercise a contingent right to purchase shares.

==== Environmental pollution ====
Throughout Potanin&#x27;s tenure as CEO, Norilsk Nickel has been consistently criticized for its environmental record. The company was named as one of the biggest polluters in the Russian Arctic, and the city of Norilsk was named among the most polluted places on Earth. According to a 2013 report, Norilsk Nickel&#x27;s operations &quot;discharge some 500 tons of copper and nickel oxides per year and release another 2 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere annually&quot;, accounting for a life expectancy of local residents 10 years below the Russian national average. According to reports from journalists who visited the city, Norilsk is surrounded by &quot;1.2 million acres of dead forest&quot;, or that &quot;nature in a radius almost the size of Germany is dead from severe air pollution&quot;, depending on the source.

As a result, pressure has been mounting on Potanin from Putin to clean up Norilsk Nickel&#x27;s operations. In 2010, Putin stated that solving ecological problems in the Norilsk area must be one of the company&#x27;s leadership&#x27;s main tasks.

In September 2016, the local Daldykan river ran red after a suspected break of a Norilsk Nickel slurry pipe released industrial waste into the water. Norilsk Nickel was subsequently fined an undisclosed amount by the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources (Rosprirodnadzor).

During a meeting with Putin in January 2017, Potanin promised to solve environmental problems by 2023 through the modernization of capacities. Briefing Putin on Norilsk Nickel&#x27;s development and performance, Potanin promised to invest $17 billion over a seven-year period on measures to modernize the company&#x27;s facilities and reduce pollution from its operations. Potanin said that the company planned to reduce its emissions by 75% as part of its long-term development programme through 2023. In the Norilsk area, emissions were reduced by 30–35% in 2017 alone, according to company data. However, another $2 billion environmental clean-up project is supposedly still outstanding.

In May 2020, a major oil spill occurred at a power plant owned by Norilsk Nickel, flooding rivers with up to 21,000 cubic metres of diesel oil, in what has been described as the second-largest oil spill in modern Russian history.

==== Moving copper plant to China ====
In the spring of 2024, representatives of Norilsk Nickel, headed by Potanin, announced the upcoming transfer of copper production from Russia to China. This plan was motivated both by the need to circumvent Western sanctions when exporting copper to foreign markets, and by China&#x27;s significantly less stringent environmental standards than those in Russia. According to Potanin&#x27;s representatives, further modernization of the existing outdated production to comply with Russian environmental standards turned out to be completely unprofitable for Norilsk Nickel, and the company preferred to carry out new construction in a country with less expensive environmental requirements.

=== Other investments ===
Potanin also owned a stake in Petrovax Pharm, a pharmaceutical company during norties.

==== Rosa Khutor ski resort ====
Potanin was inspired to develop the Rosa Khutor ski resort in the Mzymta valley near Sochi after skiing with Putin in Austria in 2003. He invested more than $2 billion into the resort after Sochi was picked for the 2014 Olympic Winter Games in 2007.

He allegedly urged Putin to approve expansion in the area to create a &quot;Russian Courchevel&quot;, despite oppositional pressure from environmental groups who claimed it would further damage the region.

Following Potanin&#x27;s complaint about a cost overrun of at least $530 million during the construction of hotels and chalets in Sochi and the Rosa Khutor ski resort (as required by the International Olympic Committee), Potanin sought compensation from the Russian government for the extra costs incurred.

It was later shown that construction of the Rosa Khutor resort had resulted in a vast patch of forest being cut down, although Potanin had announced that construction would require &quot;little excavation and zero logging&quot;. This was strongly criticized by environmental conservation groups, such as Environmental Watch on North Caucasus.

Between 2005 and 2010, Potanin invested $500,000 in starting a leopard breeding initiative in the Mzymta valley. In 2015, he asked president Putin to allow for permits to double the size of the ski resort, an expansion that will threaten the leopard program he contributed to.

==== Iran ====
Potanin became the first major Russian investor to acquire assets in Iran after the sanctions against the country over its missile program were lifted in 2016. Through his investment fund New Winter Capital Partners (NWCP), he bought shares of the Swedish Pomegranate (firm), which is a shareholder in a number of Iranian internet companies, such as Digikala, the country&#x27;s largest online retailer. The investment in Digikala was estimated to be $300 million.

====Cryptocurrency====

Potanin is a member of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP), a lobby group that sent Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev a proposal for alternative cryptocurrency regulations in October 2018.

==== Vneshekonombank ====
In May 2015, Potanin was named a co-defendant in a case in which state-owned Vnesheconombank (VEB) was looking for damages for losses from the liquidation of Roskhlebprodukt, in which he indirectly owned a stake. In total, VEB sought $68 million in damages from Potanin and others.

====Rosbank====
In April 2022 owing to the International sanctions during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, French banker Societe Generale had stranded Rosbank assets and was seeking a quick exit from Russia. Interros bought the distressed assets. The French banker had paid an estimated $4.3 billion to Interros over the period between 2006 and 2014 to amass nearly all the shares in the Russian bank and its subsidiaries. As a result of this transaction the French banker wrote off its balance sheet $3.3 billion. Four months later Potanin announced his intention to transfer 50% of Rosbank&#x27;s shares to his own charitable foundation. Another 7.5% of the shares were sold to a subsidiary of Rosbank – the investment company Rusfinance.

====Tinkoff Bank====
In April 2022 Oleg Tinkov sold his shares in Tinkoff Bank to Potanin-controlled Interros. According to Tinkov, he was offered a price of about 3% of the real value of his shares, but was forced to accept the offer as officials of the Putin administration threatened to nationalize the bank after he publicly criticized the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

== Awards ==

In March 2003, he took charge of the National Council on Corporate Governance (NSKU), whose main goal is to improve the legislative regulations in Russia and to introduce professional and ethical standards of corporate governance in Russian companies. The goal is to boost the reputation and investment appeal of the Russian businesses.

In April 2003, Potanin was elected chairman of the board of trustees of the State Hermitage, the most renowned Russian art museum.

He was a member of the Civic Chamber of Russia until 2014.

In 2016, Potanin&#x27;s charitable organization, the Vladimir Potanin Foundation, donated works of art to be displayed at the Centre Pompidou&#x27;s exhibition of Russian and Soviet art along with another 40 donors including Vladimir Semenikhin, the Tsukanov Family Foundation and others. For his efforts, Potanin was awarded the French Legion of Honour later that year.

Potanin was a member of the board of trustees of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York. In March 2022, shortly after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, he stepped down as a trustee following outrage directed at Russian oligarchs closely associated with Putin.

=== Sanctions ===
He was sanctioned by the UK government in 2022 in relation to the Russo-Ukrainian War. 

On 6 April 2022, the Trudeau government added Potanin to its sanctions list over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On 15 December 2022, the US Treasury joined others by adding Potanin to its sanction list.

== Investigations ==

===Byte Grid===
The FBI announced in July 2018 that ByteGrid, a data solutions provider contracted to store Maryland State Board of Elections data, was owned by a private equity firm in which Potanin is an investor. A retroactive investigative report issued by the US Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center found no indication that the MDSBE corporate network had been compromised. The contract has since been transferred to Intelishift as a precaution.

===Charles McGonigal===
In August 2023, former FBI special agent Charles McGonigal pleaded guilty in connection to a scheme to place Potanin on a U.S. sanctions list on behalf of sanctioned Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska.

== Personal life ==
Potanin&#x27;s first marriage was to Natalia Potanina, with whom he has three children. They married in 1983 and divorced after 31 years of marriage. In 2014, Potanin married for a second time, to Ekaterina, with whom he has two children.

These three luxury motor yachts built by Oceanco were built for him:
* The Barbara, built in 2016.
* The Nirvana, built in 2012.
* The Anastasia, built in 2008.

Potanin is the only Russian to have signed The Giving Pledge, with a promise to donate at least half of his wealth to charity.

On December 24, 2021 he played a friendly chess match with grandmaster Ian Nepomniachtchi. The game ended with victory for the professional in the 38th move, though not with checkmate – Potanin conceded as a result of Nepomniachtchi’s superior position. Chess experts rate Potanin’s ability highly.

=== Divorce proceedings with Natalia Potanina ===
In 2016, Natalia Potanina filed a $15 billion lawsuit claiming profits of Norilsk Nickel as well as Interros International, in what would have been the world&#x27;s largest divorce settlement. A Moscow district court rejected her claim in July 2017, arguing that the lawsuit&#x27;s limitation period had expired.

The claim was preceded by a smaller claim of $7 billion in 2015, after Potanin had offered a divorce settlement including a monthly allowance of $250,000 as well as real estate in Moscow, London and New York. The claim was struck down in 2016. Natalia argued that Russian law demands that wealth accumulated during a marriage is split evenly between the divorcees.

<text>Richard Darryl Zanuck (; December 13, 1934 – July 13, 2012) was an American film producer. His 1989 film &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Picture. He was also instrumental in launching the career of director Steven Spielberg, who described Zanuck as a &quot;director&#x27;s producer&quot; and &quot;one of the most honorable and loyal men of our profession.&quot;

==Early life and career==
Richard Darryl Zanuck was born in Los Angeles to actress Virginia Fox and Darryl F. Zanuck, then head of production for 20th Century Fox. He was the youngest of three children. He had two elder sisters, Darrylin (1931–2015) and Susan (1933–1980). While studying at Stanford University, he began his career in the film industry working for the 20th Century Fox story department. In 1959, Zanuck had his first shot at producing with the film &quot;Compulsion&quot;. In the 1960s, Zanuck became the president of 20th Century Fox. One year of his tenure was chronicled by John Gregory Dunne in &quot;The Studio&quot;. After failures like 1967&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;, he was dismissed by his father and joined Warner Bros. as Executive Vice President.

In 1972, Zanuck joined with David Brown to form an independent production company called the Zanuck/Brown Company at Universal Pictures. Their first big hit was &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in April 1974. The two men produced a pair of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s early films, &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot; (1974) and &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975). They subsequently produced such box office hits as &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985) and &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; (1989) before dissolving their partnership in 1988. They were jointly awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1990. He worked with Tim Burton six times, producing Burton&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (2001), &quot;Big Fish&quot; (2003), &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2005), &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; (2007), &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010), and &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (2012). He and Burton connected immediately, and Zanuck was Burton&#x27;s producer of choice. In a May 2012 interview, Zanuck told &quot;Variety&quot;: &quot;A producer should contribute from the very beginning until the very end, in all aspects. I&#x27;m there at the set every day, on every shot. Not that the director, particularly Tim [Burton], needs me, but just in case.&quot;

==Personal life==
Zanuck married three times. On January 14, 1958, he married Lili Charlene Gentle (b. March 4, 1940), an actress from Birmingham, Alabama, and a second cousin of actress Tallulah Bankhead. The marriage, which produced two daughters, Virginia Lorraine Zanuck (born 1959) and Janet Beverly Zanuck (born 1960), was dissolved in 1968.

On October 26, 1969, Zanuck and his protégé, actress Linda Harrison, together with his friend, producer Sy Bartlett, and Harrison&#x27;s sister Kay, flew to Las Vegas, where Zanuck married Harrison on a balcony of the Sands Hotel. The marriage became difficult after Harrison failed to garner the role of the wife in Zanuck&#x27;s production of &quot;Jaws&quot;.

In mid-1977, as a result of his second wife&#x27;s entanglement with a 65-year-old &quot;guru&quot;, Vincentii Turriziani of the Risen Christ Foundation, and the alleged guru&#x27;s claims and demands for money from Zanuck, he filed for divorce and was awarded custody of his two sons, Harrison Richard Zanuck (born 1971) and Dean Francis Zanuck (born 1972).

In a 1985 interview, Zanuck said that career problems contributed to his two failed marriages. &quot;Both girls were actresses, and neither one was well established,&quot; he said. As head of 20th Century Fox, &quot;It was tough to try to be fair to the project and also try to help them in their careers. If I didn&#x27;t give them the role, then I had to explain why they weren&#x27;t right for it. It wasn&#x27;t the major problem in the marriages, but it was an underlying source of discomfort.&quot;

On September 23, 1978, Zanuck married his third wife, Lili Fini (born 1954), a former World Bank employee and Carnation Co. office manager, who helped him raise his sons from his second marriage, and would co-produce some of his most memorable films, including &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985), &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; (1989), and &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; (2002). When the Zanucks won the Best Picture Oscar in 1989 for &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;, Lili Fini Zanuck was only the second woman in history to have earned an Oscar for Best Picture. In 1998, she directed an episode of the HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, titled &quot;We Have Cleared the Tower&quot;, and in 2000, Richard and Lili Fini Zanuck co-produced the 72nd Academy Awards ceremony.

==Death==
Zanuck died on July 13, 2012, of a heart attack at his home in Los Angeles, California. He was 77 years old. The Beverly Park home he had lived in until his death was sold for $20.1 million in July 2012. On February 25, 2014, 20th Century Fox opened the Richard D. Zanuck Production Building at its Los Angeles studios. &quot;Richard was a true giant of our industry for over five decades&quot;, Fox chairman and CEO Jim Gianopulos said at the dedication ceremony. &quot;He was family, and an integral part of our legacy. We couldn&#x27;t find a building worthy of him, so we built one.&quot; The ceremony was attended by Zanuck&#x27;s widow, Lili Fini Zanuck, his sons, and four of his nine grandchildren.

==Filmography==
He was a producer in all films unless otherwise noted.

<text>Asia Times (), formerly known as Asia Times Online, is a Hong Kongbased English language news media publishing group, covering politics, economics, business, and culture from an Asian perspective. &quot;Asia Times&quot; publishes in English and simplified Chinese.

== History ==
The Hong Kong website is self-described successor to Bangkok-based print newspaper &quot;Asia Times&quot; that was launched in 1995 and closed in mid-1997, using the domain asiatimes.com.

&quot;Asia Times Online&quot; was created early in 1999, at atimes.com, describing itself as a successor in &quot;publication policy and editorial outlook&quot; to the print newspaper &quot;Asia Times&quot;, owned by Sondhi Limthongkul, a Thai media mogul and leader of the People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy, who later sold his business.

The new publishing company is Asia Times Holdings Limited, incorporated and registered in Hong Kong. Many reporters from the &quot;Asia Times&quot; print edition continued their careers as journalists, and a group of those contributors created &quot;Asia Times Online&quot; as a successor to the &quot;Asia Times&quot;. The word &quot;Online&quot; is no longer part of the website news portal.

In 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;Asia Times Online&quot; as &quot;one of the most prominent of the [English-language] regional publications&quot; covering Asia.

The site was relaunched with a new logo and design in October 2016 with Uwe Parpart as editor. Other executives include Cecil Ho, former chief financial officer of ReOrient Group Limited.

The site was again relaunched in February 2019 with a refreshed web design, multiple languages and a domain name change to asiatimes.com. According to its &quot;About&quot; page, &quot;Asia Times&quot; has &quot;two main newsrooms and social media hubs ... in Bangkok and Hong Kong ... supported by bureaus in Seoul, Beijing, Singapore, and New York.&quot;

<text>David Brown (July 28, 1916 February 1, 2010) was an American film and theatre producer and writer who was best known for producing the 1975 film &quot;Jaws&quot; based on the best-selling novel by Peter Benchley.

==Early life==
He was born in New York City, the son of Lillian (&quot;née&quot; Baren) and Col. Edward Fisher Brown, and was the elder brother of Carolyn Brown, who married French aristocrat Emmanuel de Crussol d&#x27;Uzès, Duke of Uzès, then who remarried to Geoffrey Carpenter Doyle, a grandson of New York City architect James Edwin Ruthven Carpenter Jr.

Brown was a graduate of Stanford University and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.

==Early career==
He began his professional career as a journalist, contributing to magazines including &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, before becoming an editor himself. He was a managing editor of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; before his wife, Helen Gurley Brown, joined the magazine.

==Production career==

===Film===
In 1951, the producer Darryl F. Zanuck hired Brown to head the story department at Zanuck&#x27;s studio, 20th Century-Fox. Brown eventually rose to become executive vice president of creative operations. He and Richard D. Zanuck, Darryl&#x27;s son, left Fox in 1971 for Warner Bros., but the following year they set out to form their own production company.

The caper film &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973) starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford was a Zanuck/Brown &quot;presentation&quot;. In 1974, the company produced, along with Universal Pictures, &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot;, Steven Spielberg&#x27;s directorial debut, for a motion picture. Thereafter, the pair were credited as producers or executive producers of more than a dozen films, including the courtroom drama &quot;The Verdict&quot; (1982), directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Paul Newman; the science-fiction &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985), directed by Ron Howard; and the comedy drama &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; (1989), directed by Bruce Beresford and starring Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman. &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; won four Academy Awards, including the Best Picture award.

Without Zanuck, Brown went on to produce films including the drama &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; (1999) and the romance &quot;Chocolat&quot; (2000).

He and partner Zanuck were jointly awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1990 for their achievements in producing films including the horror thriller &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), directed by Steven Spielberg.

===Theater===
Brown produced various Broadway musicals, including &quot;Sweet Smell of Success: The Musical&quot; (2002), &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; (2005), and the off-Broadway Jerry Herman musical revue &quot;Showtune&quot; (2003).

He bought the film and stage rights to the drama play &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, written by playwright Aaron Sorkin. The play opened November 1989 and ran for 500 performances. The film of the same name (1992) stars Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson.

==Personal life==

David Brown was married and divorced twice. Helen Gurley Brown would be his third wife.
From 1959, for fifty-one years, until his death, Brown was the husband of Helen Gurley Brown, editor of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine for 32 years, and author of &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot;.

Brown had one son, Bruce, from a prior marriage, who predeceased him, and a half brother, Edward Fisher Brown Jr.

He was known equally for his mannerliness, fine wardrobe, distinctive mustache and for championing writers. He had strong connections with publishers and agents.

Brown wrote &quot;Brown&#x27;s Guide to the Good Life: Tears, Fears and Boredom&quot; (2005), which gives advice on life. He also wrote &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot; (1990), an anecdotal autobiography.

===Death===
He died, age 93, at his home in Manhattan from kidney failure on February 1, 2010. His widow, Helen, died on August 13, 2012, age 90. Mr. and Mrs. Brown were laid to rest in late November 2012 in adjacent graves at Sisco Cemetery in Arkansas. Helen&#x27;s maternal family cemetery is located just south of the village of Osage in Carroll County, Arkansas.

==Filmography==
He was a producer in all films unless otherwise noted.

<text>Johann Christian Gottlieb Ackermann (17 February 1756 – 9 March 1801) was a German medical doctor.

==Biography==
He was born at Zeulenroda, in Upper Saxony, on 17 February 1756. His parents were the physician Johann Samuel Ackermann (1705-1762) and Eva Rosine Oberreuther (1722-1776), the daughter of the tanning master Paul Steinmüller.

Johann attended the University of Jena at only fifteen years old and was taught there by Ernst Gottfried Baldinger. The two relocated to Göttingen where he studied, apart from medicine, the classical sciences, as a student of Christian Gottlob Heyne. Ackermann was promoted in 1775 to private lecturer at the medical faculty of Halle, where he lived for two years. Afterwards, he returned to Zeulenroda to practice medicine and physics. In 1786, he followed a call to Altdorf, where he was appointed professor of chemistry. In 1794, he accepted a position as chair of applied medicine and - at the same time - a position as head of the local hospital for the poor. He died at the age of 45 from tuberculosis.

The main focus of Ackermann&#x27;s scientific works lies in his historical studies of the medical sciences during the Middle Ages. He collected several rare medical writings and translated foreign publications into German.
He wrote &quot;Institutiones Historiae Medicinae&quot; (Nuremberg, 1792) and &quot;Institutiones Therapiae Generalis&quot; (Nuremberg and Altdorf, 1784-1795).

<doc id="966029" wikidata="Q144723" url="?curid=966029" title="Papaveraceae">
<text>The Papaveraceae, informally known as the poppy family, are an economically important family of about 42 genera and approximately 775 known species of flowering plants in the order Ranunculales. The family is cosmopolitan, occurring in temperate and subtropical climates (mostly in the northern hemisphere) like Eastern Asia as well as California in North America. It is almost unknown in the tropics. Most are herbaceous plants, but a few are shrubs and small trees. The family currently includes two groups that have been considered to be separate families: Fumariaceae and Pteridophyllaceae. &quot;Papaver&quot; is the classical name for poppy in Latin.

== Description ==
Papaveraceae are known for diverse and colorful flowers with distinctive sepals. The plants may be annual, biennial, or perennial. Usually herbaceous, a few species form shrubs or evergreen trees. All parts contain a well-developed system of latex ducts called &quot;laticifers&quot;, that produce milky latex, a watery white, yellow or red juice. 

The leaves are alternate or sometimes whorled and have petioles and no stipules. They are usually lobed or pinnatifid (i.e. consisting of several not entirely separate leaflets), or much divided.

The plants are hermaphroditic and pollinated mostly by insects (entomophilous), but nectaries are lacking. A few are wind pollinated (anemophilous). There is a distinct calyx and corolla, except in &quot;Macleaya&quot; where the corolla is lacking. The flowers are medium-sized or large. The terminal flowers are solitary in many species. In others the terminal inflorescence is cymose or racemose. The flowers are odourless and regular.

There are many stamens, mostly 16 to 60, arranged in two separate whorls, the outer one with stamens alternating with petals, the inner one opposite, or numerous in the subfamily Papaveroideae. The gynoecium consists of a compound pistil with 2 to 100 carpels. The ovary is superior and unilocular. The ovary is either stemless (sessile) or on a short stem (stipitate). The sepals of the plant typically number half of the petals for example two sepals accompany 4 petals or 3 sepals accompany 6 petals. The pistils and stamens are hidden inside the petals. 

The non-fleshy fruit is usually a capsule, breaking open at maturity to release the seeds through pores (poricidal), through the partitions between the cells (septicidal), or by means of valves (valvular). The numerous seeds are small. Their nutritive tissue (endosperm) is oily and farinose. The fruit of &quot;Platystemon&quot; is a schizocarp.

The basic chromosome number, &quot;x&quot;, is 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, up to &quot;12n&quot; = 84 (dodecaploidy) in species of &quot;Papaver&quot;, &quot;Argemone&quot; and &quot;Meconopsis&quot;.

The Papaveraceae family includes many plants that produce alkaloids, including opium poppy (&quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;). Opium is derived from the latex of the opium poppy seed pods and has been used for centuries due to its psychoactive properties. The main alkaloids found in opium, such as morphine, and codeine have huge impact on pharmaceuticals and a big importance on many countries that produce it on a large-scale including Afghanistan. Afghanistan has an economic dependence on opium cultivation making it hard to stop large scale production of these flowers ultimately increasing illegal production. Researchers are understanding how alkaloids are made in poppy plants to develop poppy plants with specific alkaloid levels. There is high genetic variability among poppy cultivars and environmental factors like wounding and methyl jasmonate treatment induce higher alkaloid production. Challenges still remain in understanding what effects alkaloid production for pharmaceutical purposes, highlighting importance of research in this field.

== Taxonomy ==
The APG III system (2009; unchanged from the APG II system of 2003 and the APG system of 1998) places the family in the order Ranunculales, in the clade eudicots. The Papaveraceae differ from the rest of the Ranunculales in some important characteristics but they share others such as the presence of isoquinoline-derived alkaloids. Based on molecular and morphological data, the family forms a clade with the families Lardizabalaceae, Circaeasteraceae, Menispermaceae, Berberidaceae and Ranunculaceae.

=== Genera ===
The broad circumscription of Papaveraceae in the APG III system includes three taxa that have previously been separated into different families: the Papaveraceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, the Fumariaceae and the Pteridophyllaceae. Thus the Cronquist system of 1981 recognised the Fumariaceae as a separate family, despite their close phylogenetic relationship to the Papaveraceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;. The three former families may be treated as subfamilies. One morphological and molecular study concluded that the former family Pteridophyllaceae has a basal position with a subsequent division into two terminal clades each containing one of the subfamilies Fumarioideae and Papaveroideae, which are clearly monophyletic. A more recent study includes the former Pteridophyllaceae in the Fumarioideae, dividing the Papaveraceae into only two subfamilies.

The internal division of the Fumarioideae shown below follows Lidén (1993), with the exception of the placement of &quot;Pteridophyllum&quot;. The subtribes are given by the Germplasm Resources Information Network. The division of the Papaveroideae follows Hoot et al. (1997). In the latter study, the tribe Eschscholzieae would be the basal clade and sister group to the rest of the subfamily, which is divided into a different terminal clade (Chelidonieae) and into its sister group, formed by the Papavereae and Platystemoneae, whose separation is not based on the data presented by these authors. For discussions of subfamilies, see Carolan et al. (2006) and Blattner &amp; Kadereit (1999).

== Ecology ==

Pollination is entomophile (basically by flies and wasps and bees, less often by beetles), except in &quot;Bocconia&quot; and &quot;Macleaya&quot;. In Papaveroideae, the reward is pollen as there is no nectar. The visual attractant is the petals that are usually brightly coloured and often have basal guides, sometimes the attractant can also be the androecium as the petals do not last long. Some species, mostly those from the arctic and alpine regions, reinforce their attraction with floral fragrance (for example, &quot;Papaver alpinum&quot; smells of cloves), which in the case of &quot;Romneya&quot; drugs the insects. The anthers and stigmas mature at the same time, but &quot;Bocconia&quot; is clearly protogynous, the stigmas emerge from the calyx that encloses them. Autopollination is common and in some cases (for example, &quot;Roemeria hybrida&quot;) it occurs before the bud opens (cleistogamy). The presence of an aril suggests dispersion of seeds by ants (myrmecochory), once they have been expelled by the fruit. In the case of &quot;Bocconia&quot; the seeds remain attached to the replums after the capsule&#x27;s valves have fallen leaving their brilliant red or orange arils exposed, which attract birds to feed on them, facilitating their dispersal (ornithochory). Seeds that lack an aril appear to be dispersed by the wind (anemochory) for capsules that open, in the other cases they are freed when the fruit decomposes. Many Fumarioideae species have explosive fruits (ballistic), while &quot;Rupicapnos&quot; and &quot;Sarcocapnos&quot; species are chasmophytes, growing on rocks, and their fruit&#x27;s peduncles and pedicels are geotropic and they lengthen so that the seeds bury into the base of the plant.

The Papaveroideae typically grow in cooler and wooded areas, forming part of the undergrowth. They have adapted to arctic and alpine habitats and to arid, Mediterranean areas, many species are ruderal and segetal (growing in cornfields). &quot;Pteridophyllum&quot; grows in the undergrowth of woods of needle-leaved trees between . The Fumarioideae are basically found in open, rocky, alpine landscapes or vertical or overhanging cracks, while some species are ruderal or segetal.

== Phytochemistry ==

Alkaloids: The isoquinolinic alkaloids present in the family are well known. They are derived from berberine, tetrahydroberberine, protopine and benzophenanthridine in Papaveroideae, and from spirobenzylisoquinoline and cularine in Fumarioideae, as well as from other groups that give them pharmacological properties: derivatives of aporphine, morphinan, pavine, isopavine, narceine and rhoeadine.

Others: Other characteristic substances contained within these species include: meconic acid and chelidonic acid, as well as cyanogenic glycoside compounds derived from tyrosine: dhurrin and triglochinin; in the Fumarioideae while the Chelidonieae contain the free amino acid δ-acetylornithine.

Flavonoids: Iridoids and proanthocyanidins absent. Flavonols, kaempferol and/or quercetin present.

Many of these plants are poisonous. The Mexican prickly poppy is poisonous if taken internally and may cause oedema and glaucoma. Even if an animal, such as a goat, should persist in grazing on this plant, not only will the animal suffer but so will those who drink its milk, because the poisons are passed along in the milk.

==Fossil record==
The fossils of the late Cretaceous poppy &quot;Palaeoaster inquirenda&quot; from the Western Interior of North America occurs from 74.5 million year old deposits in the Fruitland Formation in New Mexico to 64.5 million year old deposits in the Hell Creek Formation in North Dakota. Dehiscent fruit fossils of &quot;Palaeoaster&quot; have been found at the excavation site for the well known &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; specimen BHI 3033. The seed capsule of &quot;Palaeoaster&quot; has some similarities to that of the extant poppy genus &quot;Romneya&quot;.

&quot;Papaverites&quot;, a fossil fruit from the Eocene of Germany, may be associated with Papaveraceae. Chesters et al. (1967) mentions &quot;Papaver pictum&quot; from the Oligocene of England.

== Cultivation ==

The family is well known for its striking flowers, with many species grown as ornamental plants, including California poppy (&quot;Eschscholtzia californica&quot;, the California state flower), the stunning blue Himalayan poppies (&quot;Meconopsis&quot;), several species of &quot;Papaver&quot;, and the wildflower bloodroot. Only two species are of economic importance for the production of opium and its derivatives for pharmaceutical use: &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; is cultivated legally in order to obtain morphine and other opiates, and &quot;Papaver bracteatum&quot;, for thebaine. &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; is also the source of the poppy seeds used in cooking and baking, and poppy seed oil. The illegal cultivation of poppies in Asia for the production of opium and heroin is virtually equal to the legal production in the rest of the world. Some Funarioideae have a limited use in gardening, with &quot;Lamprocapnos spectabilis&quot; (&quot;bleeding heart&quot;), and &quot;Pseudofumaria lutea&quot; (&quot;yellow corydalis&quot;) commonly used. Chinese traditional medicine used the boiled and dried tubers of &quot;Corydalis yanhusuo&quot; (&quot;yanhusuo&quot;).

==Symbolism==

The opium poppy and corn poppy are symbols, respectively, of sleep and death. In Great Britain, Canada, the United States, and Australia the corn poppy is worn in remembrance of World War I.

<text>Alexander Pavlovich Smolensky (; 6 July 1954 – 13 October 2024) was a Russian business oligarch.

== Biography ==
Alexander Smolensky began his business activities on the black market of the so-called &quot;shadow economy&quot;. His private ventures included trading foreign currency, moonlighting on a second job in a bakery with a counterfeit permit as well as typesetting and printing Bibles using government presses and ink. He was arrested by the KGB in 1981 and charged with economic crimes. Subsequently, he was sentenced to two years of hard labour although he only served one day.

Alexander Smolensky is considered the first private banker of Russia. Alexander Smolensky was the founder and president of one of the largest private banks in Russia - Bank Stolichny. In 1992, he set up the country&#x27;s first debit card processing system. In 1998 he merged his agribusiness assets in Agroprombank (acquired in 1996), which was renamed SBS-Agro and gave the businessman a tremendous influence at the Kremlin. SBS-Agro collapsed in the 1998 Russian financial crisis wiping out its investors&#x27; savings. When asked what he owed his investors he replied: &quot;dead donkey ears&quot;. He also declared that his banking activities had not gone bankrupt, but solely split into several structures spread throughout the country and managed by an advanced computer system. In 1999 Russian prosecutors issued a warrant for his arrest including charges of embezzlement and money laundering. This warrant, however, was later dropped.

Smolensky&#x27;s net worth in 2003 was estimated to be 230 million USD. By 2003 he renamed his group OVK Bank, turned it over to his son Nikolay, who sold it to Vladimir Potanin two months later. In 2004 his son Nikolay Smolensky purchased the sportscar maker TVR. (The company went bankrupt in 2007.)

In the period from 2006 to 2011, the former oligarch became interested in literary work and published seven books in the political thriller genre. The opuses were based on real stories from the life of the Russian elite.

After 2011, Smolensky disappeared from the public eye.

In 2019 a company associated with Smolensky sold the last four office complexes in Moscow, including the famous Alexander House, the former headquarters of Vladimir Putin. The deal was valued at over €60 million.

Smolensky died on 13 October 2024, at the age of 70.

<doc id="966042" wikidata="Q16001549" url="?curid=966042" title="MBTA accessibility">
<text>The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) system is mostly but not fully accessible. Like most American mass transit systems, much of the MBTA subway and commuter rail were built before wheelchair access became a requirement under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The MBTA has renovated most stations to be compliant with the ADA, and all stations built since 1990 are accessible. The MBTA also has a paratransit program, The Ride, which provides accessible vehicles to transport passengers who cannot use the fixed-route system.

Much of the MBTA subway system is accessible: all Orange and Red Line stations, and all but one Blue Line station, are accessible. Most of the underground portion of the Green Line is accessible, though only some surface stops are; all but one stop on the Mattapan Line are accessible. About three-quarters of the MBTA Commuter Rail system is accessible, including the North Station and South Station terminals. All buses (including the Silver Line) and all MBTA boat services are accessible.

==Subway==

All stations on the Orange Line, Blue Line, and Red Line rapid transit lines of the MBTA subway system have high level platforms level with train floors, and all are accessible except for Bowdoin station on the Blue Line.

Most subway stations (except , , and ) and major surface stops on the light rail Green Line have -high platforms. These allow accessible boarding from the newer low-floor Type 8 and Type 9 vehicles, which have a built-in retractable bridge plate. Some stations have portable lifts or wooden wayside ramps for use with high-floor Type 7 vehicles; however, this boarding method is largely disused. The Mattapan Line runs older, high floor PCC streetcars. Wooden ramps with bridge plates are at all stations except for Valley Road, which is inaccessible because of a steep incline from street level.

All subway transfer stations, and all stations that serve as major bus terminals, are accessible. Most have direct accessible transfers using elevators and short ramps, with some exceptions:
*Transfers between the Red Line and the southbound Orange Line at Downtown Crossing station require use of the Winter Street Concourse and the Park Street elevator, while transfers between the southbound Red Line and northbound Orange Line require leaving fare control. A three-phase project to add additional elevators will allow direct transfers.
*Harvard station has longer ramps connecting the Red Line platforms and busways to the lobby, allowing transfers without elevators. (Surface elevators connect to the lobby and the upper busway.)
*A long ramp connects the lower busway at Sullivan Square station with the upper busway and the Orange Line lobby.

==Commuter rail==
, 108 out of 141 MBTA Commuter Rail stations (77%) are accessible. Six lines are entirely accessible: the Greenbush Line, Plymouth/Kingston Line, Middleborough/Lakeville Line, Fairmount Line, Providence/Stoughton Line, and Needham Line, while the other lines have a mix of accessible and non-accessible stations. All stations built or rebuilt since about 1987 are accessible; many older stations have been retrofitted and several other stations are currently being rebuilt for accessibility. Most of the non-accessible stations are located on the Fitchburg Line, Framingham/Worcester Line, and Franklin/Foxboro Line.

Of those stations that are accessible, some only have a short elevated platform that serves one or two cars. These &quot;mini-high platforms&quot; are usually located at the end of the station away from Boston, allowing them to be served by the car nearest the locomotive. They represent most accessible stations on the Franklin/Foxboro Line, Needham Line, Framingham/Worcester Line, Fitchburg Line, Lowell Line, Haverhill Line, and Newburyport/Rockport Line, as well as several stations on the Providence/Stoughton Line and Fairmount Line. Stations served only by the CapeFLYER service also have mini-high platforms.

Some commuter rail stations, mostly newer stations and those in larger cities, have full-length high-level platforms that allow for accessible boarding on all cars. (The standard MBTA high-level side platform is 12 feet wide and 800 feet long, capable of fully handling a 9-car train. Some stations, including and , have Amtrak-style 1050-foot 12-car platforms.) The MBTA builds full-length high-level platforms at most new stations, and ultimately plans to build full-length high-level platforms at most stations except those requiring clearance for freight trains. Full-length platforms allow automatic power doors to be used, which allows passengers to board at all doors and thus speeding boarding times. High-level platforms are in place at all stations on the Greenbush Line, Kingston/Plymouth Line, and the Middleborough/Lakeville Line.

The non-accessible station at Natick Center is being renovated with high-level platforms.

==Blind and visually impaired==

According to MBTA policies, &quot;Customers who use service animals are welcome in all MBTA vehicles, stations, and facilities during all hours of operation. Customers must be in control of their service animal at all times. Animals are not permitted in seats.&quot;

Some train stations have yellow detectable warning strips with truncated domes running in a two-foot (60 cm) band along the edge of the platforms. Most Red, Orange, and Blue Line stations have these tactile strips; however, many less-used Green Line surface stops and commuter rail stations lack them.

Buses and trains are supposed to have either recorded announcements or driver announcements of station stops, but these announcements are sometimes muffled, inaudible, or omitted by automated systems. In the event that automated systems are not functioning properly, the vehicle driver or conductor is to announce stops over the public address system.

==Hearing impaired==
The MBTA has a TTY number for &quot;T&quot; information: (617) 222–5146. Many stations have TTY pay phones; the MBTA web site has a list.

The MBTA says it has reviewed its web site, http://www.mbta.com, using &quot;the United States Section 508 guidelines and WCAG double AA guidelines, ... and made all required accommodations to help ensure that the site is accessible by users who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers or other input mechanisms.&quot;

==History==

In 1975, the Massachusetts Architectural Access Board enacted its first regulations requiring accessibility of public facilities. All subsequent new rapid transit stations have been accessible. The first station to be renovated for accessibility was the Red Line level of in 1979. In the mid-1980s, the MBTA spent $80 million to extend the platforms of seven Red Line and three Orange Line stations to allow the use of six-car trains and add elevators. All new commuter rail stations have been accessible since the mid-1980s, with many existing stations renovated as well.

The pace of renovations increased after the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. Only 26 of the 80 key stations were accessible by 1990; $1.6 billion in renovations raised this to 69 in 2004. Green Line service was not accessible until around 2001, when key surface stops were retrofitted with raised platforms for use with new Type 8 LRVs. In 2006, the MBTA settled a class-action lawsuit, &quot;Joanne Daniels-Finegold, et al. v. MBTA&quot;, under which the agency agreed to add redundant elevators to a number of rapid transit stations and make other accessibility improvements.
