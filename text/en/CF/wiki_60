<text>Harley Jarvis Earl (November 22, 1893 – April 10, 1969) was an American automotive designer and business executive. He was the initial designated head of design at General Motors, later becoming vice president, the first top executive ever appointed in design of a major corporation in American history. He was an industrial designer and a pioneer of transportation design. A coachbuilder by trade, Earl pioneered the use of freeform sketching and hand sculpted clay models as automotive design techniques. He subsequently introduced the &quot;concept car&quot; as both a tool for the design process and a clever marketing device.

Earl&#x27;s Buick Y-Job was the first concept car. He started &quot;Project Opel&quot;, which eventually became the Chevrolet Corvette, and he authorized the introduction of the tailfin to automotive styling. During World War II, he was an active contributor to the Allies&#x27; research and development program in advancing the effectiveness of camouflage.

==Early life==
Harley Jarvis Earl was born in Hollywood, California. His father, J.W. Earl, began work as a coachbuilder in 1889. The senior Earl eventually changed his practice from horse-drawn vehicles to custom bodies and customized parts and accessories for automobiles, founding Earl Automobile Works in 1908.

Earl began studies at Stanford University, but left prematurely to work with, and learn from, his father at Earl Automotive Works. By this time, the shop was building custom bodies for Hollywood movie stars, including Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle and Tom Mix.

==General Motors==
Earl Automotive Works was bought by Cadillac dealer Don Lee, who kept Harley Earl as director of its custom body shop.

Lawrence P. Fisher, general manager of the Cadillac division who was one of the brothers who started Fisher Body, was visiting Cadillac dealers and distributors around the country, including Lee. Fisher met Earl at Lee&#x27;s dealership and observed him at work. Fisher, whose automotive career began with coachbuilder Fisher Body, was impressed with Earl&#x27;s designs and methods, including the use of modeling clay to develop the forms of his designs.

Fisher commissioned Earl to design the 1927 LaSalle for Cadillac&#x27;s companion marque. The success of the LaSalle convinced General Motors president Alfred P. Sloan to create the “Art and Colour Section” of General Motors, and to name Earl as its first director.

Prior to the establishment of the &quot;Art and Colour Section&quot;, American automobile manufacturers did not assign any great importance to the appearance of automobile bodies. Volume manufacturers built bodies designed by engineers, guided only by functionality and cost. Many luxury-car manufacturers, including GM, did not make bodies at all, opting instead to ship chassis assemblies to a coachbuilder of the buyer&#x27;s choice.

The executives at General Motors at the time, including engineers, division heads, and sales executives, viewed Earl&#x27;s conceptual ideas as flamboyant and unfounded. Earl struggled to legitimize his design approach against the tradition- and production-oriented executives. As head of the newly formed &quot;Art and Colour Section&quot; in 1927, he was initially referred to as one of the &quot;pretty picture boys&quot;, and his design studio as being the &quot;Beauty Parlor&quot;.

In 1937, the &quot;Art and Colour Section&quot; was renamed the Styling Section. Sloan eventually promoted Earl to vice president, making him, to the best of Sloan&#x27;s knowledge, the first styling person to be a VP at a large corporation. After the early 1930s, Earl seldom drew sketches or did design work himself, usually functioning as an overlord who supervised GM stylists, although he would retain ultimate authority over the styling department until his retirement in 1958.

Harley Earl and Sloan implemented &quot;Dynamic Obsolescence&quot; (essentially synonymous with planned obsolescence) and the &quot;Annual Model Change&quot;, tying model identity to a specific year, to further position design as a driver for the company&#x27;s product success. At the same time, Earl was careful to not depart too radically from the previous year&#x27;s styling to maintain a semblance of continuity. This practice also ensured that used GM cars had the highest resale values of any American automotive make. Earl also avoided extreme or radical styling choices that would become dated quickly and alienate conservative-minded customers. These ideas are largely taken for granted today, but were unusual at the time.

===Buick Y-Job===

In 1939, the Styling Division, under Earl&#x27;s instruction, styled and built the Buick Y-Job, the motor industry&#x27;s first concept car. While many one-off custom automobiles had been made before, the Y-job was the first car built by a mass manufacturer for the sole purpose of determining the public&#x27;s reaction to new design ideas. After being shown to the public, the Y-job became Earl&#x27;s daily driver. It was succeeded by the 1951 General Motors Le Sabre concept car.

===Camouflage research===
In 1942, during World War II, Earl established a camouflage research and training division at General Motors, one consequence of which was a 22-page document called &quot;Camouflage Manual for General Motors Camouflage&quot;. A decade before, two former World War I camouflage artists, Harold Ledyard Towle (a U.S. Army camoufleur) and McClelland Barclay (who created the Fisher Body ads, and contributed to U.S. Navy camouflage during both World Wars) had worked as designers at General Motors. Among Earl&#x27;s apprentices was English designer David Jones, who worked at its British division at Vauxhall Motors and served in the camouflage section of the Royal Engineers during World War II.

===Tailfins===

Harley Earl authorized the Frank Hershey design for the 1948 Cadillac, which incorporated the first automotive tailfin. Many of the new 1948-49 cars such as Hudson, Nash, and Lincoln adopted fastback or ponton &quot;bathtub&quot; styling. Although Earl considered this for Cadillac, he ultimately decided against it and went for a more sweeping aircraft-inspired look. This decision would prove a wise one as bathtub styling, a concept rooted in late 1930s-early 1940s design trends, quickly became dated. The styling of the 1948 Cadillac would prove far more predictive of 1950s trends and secured GM&#x27;s place at the cutting edge of automotive design. 

Inspiration for the fins came from the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, but it extended beyond the war, during the age when space rockets captured the popular imagination in the 1950s and 1960s. The style caught on throughout Detroit and eventually led to competition between Harley Earl and his counterpart at Chrysler, Virgil Exner, over the size and complexity of tailfins, culminating with those on the 1959 Cadillac models.

===Chevrolet Corvette===

Influenced by the English and European sports cars being raced on road racing circuits after World War II, Earl decided that General Motors needed to make a sports car. Design work on &quot;Project Opel&quot; began as a secret project. He first offered the project to Chevrolet general manager Ed Cole. Cole accepted the project without hesitation, and the car was offered to the public in 1953 as the Chevrolet Corvette.

===Succession===
Earl retired in 1958 upon reaching the then-mandatory retirement age of 65. His final project was overseeing the design of 1960–62 models. He was succeeded as vice-president with responsibility for the Design and Styling Department by Bill Mitchell, under whose leadership GM design became less ornamental.

Before Earl retired, General Motors became the largest corporation in the world, and design was acknowledged as the leading sales factor within the automotive industry.

==Death and legacy==
Harley Earl suffered a stroke and died in West Palm Beach, Florida, on April 10, 1969. He was 75 years old.

He is remembered as the first styling chief in the United States automobile industry, the originator of clay modeling of automotive designs, the wraparound windshield, the hardtop sedan, factory two-tone paint, and tailfins. He said in 1954, &quot;My primary purpose for twenty-eight years has been to lengthen and lower the American automobile, at times in reality and always at least in appearance.&quot; The extremely low and long American cars of the 1960s and 1970s show the extent to which Earl influenced an entire industry and culture.

He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1986.

One of his concept car designs, the turbine-powered Firebird I, is reproduced in miniature on the &quot;Harley J. Earl Trophy&quot;, which goes to the winner of the season-opening Daytona 500 NASCAR race.

Harley Earl was used in a brief advertising campaign for Buick, particularly during its reconstruction period between 2001 and 2002. Actor John Diehl, portraying Earl (or his ghost) was used to symbolize the importance of design in Buick&#x27;s cars, or as the advertisements put it, the &quot;Spirit of American Style&quot;. A fedora was often used as an Earl icon in these advertisements. 

In a December 1999 special section in the Detroit Free Press, Earl was ranked the third most significant Michigan artist of the 20th century, behind Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder.

<doc id="959172" wikidata="Q313062" url="?curid=959172" title="Joseph Babinski">
<text>Joseph Jules François Félix Babinski (; 17 November 1857 – 29 October 1932) was a French-Polish professor of neurology. He is best known for his 1896 description of the Babinski sign, a pathological plantar reflex indicative of corticospinal tract damage.

==Life==
Born in Paris, Babinski was the son of a Polish military officer, Aleksander Babiński (1824–1889), and his wife Henryka Wareńska Babińska (1819–1897), who in 1848 fled Warsaw for Paris because of a Tsarist reign of terror instigated to stall Polish attempts at achieving independence and breaking the union between Congress Poland and the Russian Empire.

Babinski received his medical degree from the University of Paris in 1884. Professor Charcot at Paris&#x27;s &quot;Salpêtrière&quot; Hospital became his mentor. Charcot&#x27;s 1893 death left Babinski without support, and he subsequently never participated in qualifying academic competitions. Free of teaching duties, while working at the &quot;Hôpital de la Pitié&quot; he was left with ample time to devote himself to clinical neurology. He was a masterful clinician, minimally dependent on neuropathological examinations and laboratory tests. 
Babinski also took an interest in the pathogenesis of hysteria and was the first to present acceptable differential-diagnostic criteria for separating hysteria from organic diseases, and coined the concept of &quot;pithiatism&quot;. In 1914, Babinski introduced the important concept of ‘anosognosia’ to name a disorder characterized by denial of illness or lack of awareness of disability.

In 1896, at a meeting of the &quot;Société de Biologie&quot;, Babiński, in a 26-line presentation, delivered the first report on the &quot;phenomène des orteils&quot;, i.e., that while the normal reflex of the sole of the foot is a plantar reflex of the toes, an injury to the pyramidal tract will show an isolated dorsal flexion of the great toe—&quot;Babinski&#x27;s sign.&quot;

During World War I, Babinski had charge of many traumatic neurology cases at the Pitié Hospitals. He was professor of neurology at the University of Paris. Babinski wrote over 200 papers on nervous disorders. With Jules Froment he published &quot;Hysteropithiatisme en Neurologie de Guerre&quot; (1917), which was translated into English in 1918 by J. D. Rolleston as &quot;Hysteria or Pithiatism, and Reflex Nervous Disorders in the Neurology of War&quot;. Babiński published some of his works in Polish.

Babinski lived in the Boulevard Haussmann, Paris, with his elder brother, Henri Babinski, a distinguished engineer and famous food writer who, as &quot;Ali Bab&quot;, published a classic cookbook.

With Pierre Palau, Babinski, under the pseudonym &quot;Olaf,&quot; wrote a disturbing play, &quot;Les détraquées&quot;, which premiered at the Deux-Masques theater in 1921. The play involves the murder of a young pupil at a girls&#x27; school by the school&#x27;s principal and her accomplice, a dance teacher. André Breton discusses the work in &quot;Nadja.&quot;

Babinski died in the same year as two great Polish neurologists, Edward Flatau and Samuel Goldflam. In his last three years he had suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He was buried in the in the family tomb, alongside his brother, who had died a year before.

==Recognition==
Babinski lived to see his achievements in French neurology internationally acclaimed. He was honored by Poland in 1925 as honorary professor of the Wilno University, by the American Neurological Society, and by other foreign societies. He was also a patron of the three large neuro-psychiatric hospitals in Poland (Kraków, Wrocław, Łódź).

<text>Sayyid Khalid bin Barghash Al-Busa&#x27;id (; 1874–19 March 1927) was the sixth Sultan of Zanzibar. The last sovereign Sultan of Zanzibar, he reigned for roughly three days, after which he was deposed by the United Kingdom in the 38-minute Anglo-Zanzibar War.

==Biography==
Sayyid Khalid bin Barghash Al-Busa&#x27;id was born in 1874 in Zanzibar, the second son of Barghash bin Said (), the second Sultan of Zanzibar.

===First disputed accession of the Sultan of Zanzibar===

He was 16 years old when, on 13 February 1890 the reigning Sultan Sayyid Khalifa bin Said Al-Busa&#x27;id (), the successor to Bargash bin Said, died after a short reign of 2 years. He was succeeded by Sayyid Ali bin Said Al-Busa&#x27;id (). Soon after, in July 1890, with the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty () between the German Empire and the United Kingdom, Germany agreed to &quot;recognize the British protectorate over ... the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba&quot; and the Sultan was forced to accede to the new power on the island. During his reign, a civil list had been drawn up reducing his income, and various departments, including the police force, had been created by the then British Consul Gerald Portal, each department under a European.

When Khalid bin Barghash was 19 years old, Rennell Rodd arrived in Zanzibar, in the New Year of 1893, to replace Gerald Portal. Immediately, the succession of the ailing Sultan was discussed and three candidates emerged. &quot;There was Khaled, son of Barghash, a rather truculent youth of eighteen: there was Hamed Bin Thwain, the son of a brother of Barghash now dead, a man of about forty, of reputed high character and a student of Arab literature: and finally there was Mahmoud, an elder cousin of the reigning Sultan.&quot; Khalid bin Barghash, despite his very strong claims to the throne as the son of Bargash, in Rennell Rodd&#x27;s view &quot;was, however, for other reasons undesirable.&quot;

During Rennell Rodd&#x27;s last visit to the Sultan, when he presented Cecil Rhodes at his court in March 1893, it was obvious to him that the Sultan had not long to live. Accordingly, he made preparations for daily and nightly signals to be exchanged with HMS &quot;Philomel&quot; and HMS &quot;Blanche&quot; where marines were to be at the ready with machine guns. On the night of March 5th 1893, Sayyid Ali bin Said Al-Busa&#x27;id died as anticipated. Khalid entered the palace let in by his aunt, the Sultan&#x27;s sister, Bi. Zemzem binti Sa&#x27;id bin Sultan, who was fond of Khalid. However, Rennell Rodd immediately ordered the landings of 200 marines armed with machine guns, while the police force under Lieutenant Hatch was stationed around the palace and town. Refused permission to enter the palace, an ultimatum was issued with the threat that the doors of the palace would be blown open within five minutes if entry was barred. After entry was forced into the palace, Khalid was rebuked and marched off to his house under arrest, and the Sayyid Hamad bin Thuwaini Al-Busa&#x27;id () was installed as the new Sultan, after he had accepted the conditions &quot;which had been carefully thought out and prepared in advance&quot; by Rennell Rodd.

===Second disputed accession of the Sultan of Zanzibar===

The events of 1893 were in some measure repeated in 1896 but on a much larger scale. Khalid briefly ruled Zanzibar (25–27 August 1896), seizing power after the sudden death of his cousin Hamad bin Thuwaini, who many suspect was poisoned by Khalid. Great Britain refused to recognise his claim to the throne, citing a treaty from 1866 which stated that a new sultan could only accede to the throne with British assent, resulting in the Anglo-Zanzibar War, the briefest war in history. During the &quot;war&quot;, Royal Navy vessels shelled Khalid&#x27;s palace for 38 minutes before a surrender was received. This time, the casualties sustained were 500 or so men in Khalid&#x27;s retinue, martial law was imposed, and several Omani sheikhs suspected of complicity were apprehended and deported to Machakos. Khalid fled his palace through a back door to take refuge in the German consulate.

Basil Cave, the British Consul, who had been Vice-Consul when Rennell Rodd had removed Khalid from succession three years earlier, informed the Foreign Secretary, Marquess of Salisbury, in September, that he &quot;remains in the house all the doors of which are guarded, from the inside, by about ten armed sailors or marines from a German man-of-war in harbour. The Consulate is being carefully and constantly watched by men in the service of Sir Lloyd Mathews&quot;.

In October 1896, Albrecht von Rechenberg, the German Consul in Zanzibar, wrote to Cave saying, &quot;Monsieur le Gerant, J&#x27;ai l&#x27;honneur de vous informer que mon Gouvemement m&#x27;a ordonne d&#x27;envoyer Chalid bin Bargash á Dar-es-Salaam. Le transport sera effectue sans que Chalid touche le sol de Zanzibar&quot;. (&#x27;To the Principal Officer: I beg to inform you that my Government has requested me to send Chalid bin Bargash to Dar es Salaam. The transportation will be carried out without Chalid setting foot on the soil of Zanzibar&#x27;).

===First exile===

Events transpired as Rechenberg had outlined, and Khalid was conveyed by SMS &quot;Seeadler&quot;, a ship anchored outside the Imperial Consulate, safely to Dar es Salaam without Khalid stepping on Zanzibari soil. In German East Africa, he received political asylum. 
In the following years in Dar es Salaam, he enjoyed the rank and privileges customarily conferred on royal persons in exile, and was present on many occasions of importance to the government, such as the state visit of Bernard Dernberg, the newly appointed German Colonial Secretary.

According to one source, &quot;Huko Dar es Salaam Sayyid Khalid aliwekwa katika nyumba ya fakhari na vilevile aliachiwa kupandisha bendera nyekundu ya usultani wa Zanzibar.&quot; (&quot;Over in Dar-es-Salaam Sayyid Khalid was set up in a grand house and at the same time was permitted to fly the red flag of the Sultanate of Zanzibar&quot;).

===Second exile===

During the First World War, he was captured by British forces, arguably in Dar es Salaam in 1917, but possibly elsewhere, and was exiled to Saint Helena, the island where Napoleon had been previously exiled, and later to the Seychelles. After many entreaties asking for his return to East Africa, Winston Churchill, as Secretary of State to the Colonies, wrote to the Administrator of Seychelles (22 March 1922): &quot;It has been arranged that Seyyid Khaled bin Bargash and his dependents should in future be allowed to reside at Mombasa.&quot; Khalid died in Mombasa on Saturday, 19 March 1927, five years after his return there.

Throughout his exile in the Seychelles he was denied access to his extensive property around Mombasa and the revenues from it.

==Legacy==

He had at least five sons and one daughter. Permission was eventually granted to them to return to Zanzibar, but their only property remaining was in Dar es Salaam. One of the sons, Majid () was mentioned as having helped Frederick Johnson compile his &quot;Standard Swahili–English Dictionary&quot;.

Yundi Li (; born 7 October 1982), also known mononymously as Yundi (stylized as YUNDI), is a Chinese classical concert pianist. Yundi is especially known for his interpretation of Chopin, Liszt and Prokofiev. He is considered one of the greatest contemporary interpreters of Chopin.

Yundi rose to fame for being the youngest pianist, at the age of eighteen, to win first prize at the International Chopin Piano Competition in 2000. In 2015, he also served as the competition’s youngest-ever juror. In recognition to his contribution to Chopin pieces, the Polish government awarded Yundi with the world&#x27;s first Chopin passport (&quot;Chopinowskie paszporty&quot;). Yundi is also the first Chinese recipient of both Silver (2010) and Gold (2019) Medal for Merit to Culture - Gloria Artis  issued by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage of Polish government, in regards to his contribution to both music and Polish culture.

Yundi has promoted Chinese national music worldwide, as well as the development of classical music in China, both by his influence and philanthropy.

==Early life and education==
Yundi Li was born in Chongqing, Sichuan, China on 7 October 1982. Both his father, Li Chuan (), and his mother, Zhang Xiaolu (), worked for the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. Although his family was not musically inclined, he began a formal music education at a very young age. At age three, he was so enchanted by an accordion performance at a shopping mall that he refused to leave. His parents subsequently bought him an accordion; he studied with Tan Jianmin, a local music teacher, he learned the instrument so quickly that he won the top prize at the Chongiqing Children&#x27;s Accordion Competition in March 1987.

Yundi began studying piano with Wu Yong at the age of seven. Two years later, Wu introduced him to Dan Zhaoyi, a well-known piano teacher, with whom he would study for nine years. In 1994, Yundi enrolled at the to join Dan, who had recently taken up a position there, with whom he studied for the next six years. Yundi attracted interest from renowned schools of music, including the Eastman School of Music and Juilliard School, and was invited to study at the latter by Jerome Lowenthal. Later, he studied under Arie Vardi at the Hochschule für Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover in Hannover, Germany, from 2001 to 2006.

== Career ==
===Signing with Deutsche Grammophon===
Yundi has gained international recognition since his victory in 2000 XIV International Chopin Piano Competition, as he became the first competitor to be awarded the First Prize in 15 years since Stanislav Bunin won it in 1985, as well as the youngest and first Chinese first-prize winner. Since then, he has collaborated with leading orchestras worldwide, including the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, the Leipzig Gewandhausorchester, Mahler Chamber Orchestra and Philharmonia Orchestra.

In 2001, Yundi became the first Chinese pianist signed by Deutsche Grammophon (DG) for which he exclusively recorded until November 2008. On the DG label he released his first album &quot;Yundi Li: Chopin&quot; released on its label. The CD was first released in Japan and warmly welcomed. In their review of the album, the &quot;Gramophone magazine&quot; stated that &quot;[…] his unequivocal triumph is faithfully mirrored on his DG début album in performance after performance. Everything is naturally and enviably proportioned (a rare but necessary attribute in the everelusive Chopin)‚ everything fuelled alike by a style and poise way beyond his teenage years […]”

Yundi made his Carnegie Hall debut to great acclaim in June 2003, performing in a concert celebrating the 150th Anniversary of Steinway &amp; Sons. Bernard Holland of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that: &quot;Yundi Li, a young but seasoned competition gladiator, played Chopin and Liszt with a promising mix of elegance and impetuosity.&quot; His United States orchestral debut took place the next month, when he played Chopin&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 with the Philadelphia Orchestra.
He was also honoured at a special reception at the home of the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, where he performed for various officials of the US State Department.

Deutsche Grammophon released Yundi&#x27;s second recording, of Liszt, in August 2003, which was named among the &quot;Best Classical CD&#x27;s of the Year&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. This album also won the German Echo Klassik Solo Recording of the Year &quot;Solistische Einspielung des Jahres&quot;, the Chinese Gold Record Award, and nominated Edison Award&#x27;s Instrumental Soloist (&quot;Instrumentale Solorecitals&quot;). Of this recording, Harris Goldsmith of &quot;Musical America&quot; wrote that it &quot;[...] includes perhaps the finest account of the B-minor Sonata I have ever heard— [it] is, if anything, light years ahead in patrician elegance: exquisite artistry from one of the greatest talents to surface in years—nay, decades.&quot; His third recording &quot;Chopin: Scherzi/Impromptus&quot;, comprising Chopin&#x27;s four scherzi and three impromptus, was released in late 2004. Anthony Tommasini of the &quot;New York Times&quot; praised this recording for Yundi&#x27;s &quot;white-hot virtuosity&quot; and &quot;uncanny clarity&quot;. Also in 20014, he gave a recital in the Musikverein, Vienna, performing works by Mozart, Scarlatti, Schumann, and Liszt.

Yundi completed his North American debut recital tour in April 2004 which included sold-out performances in Boston, Vancouver, San Francisco and New York. He made his New York recital debut at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on April 24, 2004, performing Chopin scherzos and the Liszt sonata among other pieces. Reviewing this recital, Allan Kozinn of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. Li deals in a more poetic, deeply considered pianism, delivered without extraneous gestures and body language. One thing Mr. Li showed was that thoughtful interpretation can be every bit as virtuosic and exciting as the showier variety.&quot; In May of the same year, Yundi had concerts in Warsaw National Museum, representing cultural exchange between China and Poland.

In 2005, Yundi became the first Chinese pianist to appear on the cover of Wall Street Journal and the &quot;Aera&quot; magazine. He obtained Hong Kong residency in November 2006 and was among the first group of successful applicants under the recently announced Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.

In 2007, Yundi became the first Chinese pianist to record live with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and Seiji Ozawa. Deutsche Grammophon released Prokofiev&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 and Ravel&#x27;s Piano Concerto in G Major, which garnered positive reviews; it was named Editor’s Choice by Gramophone magazine, and praised by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of the best classical CDs of the year. Bryce Morrison of &quot;Gramophone&quot; reviewed the album: &quot;[...] Indeed, his performance of the Prokofiev, in its prodigious, unflagging power and brilliance, far surpasses any other in the catalogue&quot;.

Yundi is the subject of a 2008 feature-length documentary, &quot;The Young Romantic: A Portrait of Yundi&quot;, directed by Barbara Willis Sweete. This documentary &quot;captures the poetic intensity of this young virtuoso as he works with the great Maestro Seiji Ozawa to prepare for his debut with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra&quot; In 2008, he became the first Chinese pianist to have a wax sculpture by Madame Tussauds. Also in 2008, he appeared as a &quot;Pennington Great Performers&quot; series artist with the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra.

===Signing with EMI Classics===
In January 2010, Yundi signed an exclusive recording contract with EMI Classics with plans to record Chopin&#x27;s complete works for solo piano.

In March 2010, Yundi was invited by the Fryderyk Chopin Institute to perform at The Memory Recital of Chopin&#x27;s Birth 200th Anniversary Concert, in celebration of Fryderyk Chopin&#x27;s 200th Birthday at Chopin Year.

Yundi performed a solo recital at the Royal Festival Hall in London on March 16, 2010. He played a repertoire of Chopin pieces in a sold-out concert.

===Signing with Deutsche Grammophon again ===
In May 2012, Yundi officially signed with Universal Music Group and collaborated with Deutsche Grammophon once again. Deutsche Grammophon released his recording of Beethoven Sonatas in late 2012. This recording was chosen as one of Classic FM&#x27;s &quot;Album of the Year 2013&quot; and attained Platinum status in China. Yundi then released recordings of Schumann Fantasie, &quot;The Art of Yundi&quot;, Chopin prelude, and Chopin ballades, berceuse and mazurkas.

Yundi launched his &quot;Piano Dream&quot; national tour in his hometown Chongqing on August 19, 2013, and brought his music to 30 cities in the next 80 days. Most of those cities were second or third-tier. In response to questions from the media and the public, Yundi remarked that it was not degrading for him to perform in second and third-tier cities and he didn&#x27;t mind the less ideal conditions of some concert halls; he simply wanted to provide more people with an opportunity to appreciate the beauty of classical music.

On 1 March 2014, Yundi performed a piano recital at the Poland&#x27;s National Philharmonic, celebrating the 204th anniversary of Chopin’s birth. Anna Komorowska, then First Lady of Poland, listened to the concert.

In July 2015 and as featured guest soloist, Yundi embarked on a nine-concert tour with the National Youth Orchestra of the United States led by conductor Charles Dutoit. Comprising mainly the orchestra’s debut performances in Asia, the tour started at Purchase College’s Performing Arts Center and ended in Hong Kong. Carnegie Hall was the second stop. The other six concerts were given in mainland China.

On 30 October of the same year, while performing Chopin&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in Korea, Yundi suffered a memory lapse. He subsequently performed the piece smoothly again with conductor David Robertson and the orchestra. Later, Yundi apologised for his mistake on his weibo, and explained it happened because of travel fatigue.
Critics stated the overall performance as “The famed Chinese pianist&#x27;s slip up steals the show, but his Chopin is still stellar”, commented the mistake as “that’s the nature of live music, and perfection is boring” and considered the remedy “[…]But it gave me even greater admiration, on many levels, for everyone involved[…]In the temple to the arts, I was witnessing a moment of pure civility, decency and camaraderie, and was given a reminder that the gods are, in fact, human, and all the more heroic for that.”

In 2016, Yundi went on a Chopin world tour, which includes Germany, Russia and the United States. In March, he performed an all-Chopin program in Carnegie Hall, with an encore Ren Guang’s &quot;Colorful Clouds Chasing the Moon&quot;. Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim of the New York Times commented &quot;[…]he showed off a graduated array of colors and moods, including moments of understated simplicity and tenderness light-years removed from his high-decibel image.[…]&quot;. On April 21 of the same year, he performed in the National Concert Hall of Dublin.

In May 2017, Yundi attended the opening ceremony of the Yundi Art Museum, located in the Chongqing Huangjueping Piano Museum. It displays several pianos from different stages of Yundi&#x27;s career, including his first piano, as well as a collection of his awards, albums and photographs, and a high-tech experience pavilion.

From August 29 to September 5 in 2017, Yundi led the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra on a five-city concert tour in China, performing Chopin&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 and No. 2 as both the pianist and the conductor. It was Yundi&#x27;s first time picking up the baton. This tour was the first of a series of events commemorating the 100th anniversary of Poland&#x27;s regained independence.

In November 2017, Yundi went on tour playing Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 23 in A major, K 488 with Staatskapelle Dresden in Germany and China. On November 3, Yundi performed at a live concert at Beijing National Aquatics Center celebrating the 2017 League of Legends World Championship.

In 2018, Yundi had a successful debut in Australia and New Zealand. In a series of sold-out concerts, Yundi performed with local orchestras Chopin&#x27;s Piano Concertos Nos. 1 and 2 both as a soloist and a conductor.

===Signing with Warner Classics===
In December 2019, Yundi signed with Warner Classics. He soon released a new album on its label, Chopin’s Piano Concertos Nos. 1 &amp; 2, in January 2020. In this recording, he not only played the piano, but also conducted the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra from the piano bench. This album was chosen by Donald Vroon of the American Record Guide as one of the &quot;Best of 2020&quot;. The International Piano Magazine reviewed this recording, &quot;This is aristocratic Chopin, unfailing in its clarity, elegance and unforced eloquence. Nothing is over-played, everything is expressed. Yundi Li ranks among the finest, his reading of the F minor Concerto’s central love song hauntingly inward looking. The Warsaw Philharmonic offer stout support, and sound and balance are exemplary.&quot;

=== 2023-present: YUNDI Plays Mozart The Sonata Project 1 Comeback Tour===
Yundi embarked on his comeback tour, 2023 Australia Coming Back Tour: YUNDI Plays Mozart The Sonata Project 1 in 2023, two years after he was blacklisted in China for alleged solicitation of prostitutes. At his performance in Adelaide, Yundi performed Chopin’s Nocturne In E Flat Major as an encore. Yundi’s coming back tour was regarded as excellent and successful.

In the midst of 2024 March-to-May, Yundi embarked on a European Tour of YUNDI Plays Mozart The Sonata Project 1, visiting cities historically connected with Mozart, which includes Vienna, Paris, Munich, Frankfurt, Cologne, and Berlin. In align with the tour, he released his latest album, &quot;&quot;. From September to October of the same year, Yundi went on an Asian tour, including Japan and Singapore.

The album “” has received rave reviews from famed music authors Bryce Morrison and Norman Lebrecht, to name a few. Morrison writes: “&quot;His approach is a convincing challenge to a more conventional restraint, a restless Sturm und Drang precursor of Romanticism.&quot;” And Lebrecht applauded the album: “&quot;This is the most refreshing and innovative Mozart pianism I have heard in years.&quot;” 

In January 2025, Yundi continued his Japan tour with four concerts added in response to the audiences’ warm reception of his performance in the country between September and October 2024. 
 In the same month, he embarked on a United States and Canada tour, performing in Vancouver, Toronto, New York and San Francisco, while the projected concert in Los Angeles was postponed due to the wildfire. After nine years, Yundi performed in a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall in New York. He expressed that on the day of the performance, New York experienced heavy snowfall, yet many music fans travelled by train and plane to attend the concert, which filled him with immense warmth.

On February 8 of the same year, Yundi held a solo concert at the National Theater and Concert Hall in Taipei, marking his fourth visit to Taiwan. For this occasion, he specially prepared an encore piece as a gift for his music fans in Taipei.

==Repertoire, technique and performance style==
Regarded as one of the finest interpreters of Chopin, Yundi is also known for his interpretations Liszt and Prokofiev. His other repertoires, such as Mozart, Beethoven, Ravel and Schumann, have also received acclaim.

===Chopin===

Yundi&#x27;s versions of Chopin are referred &quot;artistically serious, poetic, romantic, light-touch, harmonious, and uplifting&quot;, as well as &quot;authentic and impeccable&quot;. The Telegraph praised his performance as &quot;beautifully polished and unfailingly elegant&quot;, while BBC Music Magazine noted that his “technically precise considered&quot; approach to the music was heightened with &quot;virtuosic flair&quot;.

Yundi&#x27;s technique in Chopin&#x27;s pieces is described as &quot;He has all that’s needed in poetry and sensitivity. His touch is perfect—never heavy, as Biret can be—and yet there is joy, zest, technical aplomb, healthy drama, and unerring tempos and rhythms.&quot; and &quot;Every passage is woven so smoothly and naturally that not even a grain of sound is felt, and this, combined with Chopin&#x27;s pale romanticism, heightens the listener&#x27;s sense of immersion.&quot;

===Liszt===
Yundi&#x27;s interpretations of Liszt are described &quot;dazzling, daredevil renderings, sheer, heart-stopping beauty&quot;. His versions are believed to have &quot;a smooth playing, with its flowing, impassioned rhythms, and full, rich tone, is a complete and dynamic interpretation of the score, without loss of style or form&quot;.

===Beethoven===
Jed Distler of Gramophone reviewed Yundi&#x27;s ‘Moonlight’ Sonata &quot;There’s more swing and edge to the Allegretto than I gave him credit for, while the unflappable security behind the finale’s sheen and sparkle does not preclude nervous energy. Yundi’s Moonlight may not be the deepest in the catalogue but it wears well over repeated hearings and will not steer collectors wrong.&quot;

===Mozart and Ravel===
Yundi&#x27;s Mozart interpretations are described &quot;very graceful, extremely delicate and charming, refined and aristocratic&quot;. His versions of Ravel are regarded &quot;a tart, exuberant and (in the Adagio assai) dreamy account of the Ravel concerto.&quot;

===Schumann and Prokofiev===
Yundi&#x27;s interpretations of Schumann are &quot;tempered by good taste and that rare ability to hit upon just the right tempos&quot; and &quot;brought a wider range of dynamics and dramatic characterization to the music&quot;.
Yundi &quot;excels in Prokofiev’s volatile, technically daunting Piano Concerto No. 2.&quot; and &quot;plays with expansive lyricism, surging power and, when called for, incisive attack.&quot;

==Achievements==
===Competitions===
Yundi has received top awards at various competitions. He won the Children&#x27;s Piano Competition in Beijing in 1994. In 1995, he was awarded third place at the Stravinsky International Youth Competition. In 1996, he won the third prize in the tenth Hong Kong - Asia Piano Open Competition. In 1998, he was awarded the third place at the 1998 Missouri Southern International Piano Competition (Junior Division).

Additionally, Yundi has promoted the development of classical music in China. Since 2008, Yundi is sponsored by Rolex, only under the condition that they subsidise music teaching in rural China.
Yundi is the role model to millions of young musicians in his home country, and has inspired many to learn piano. He has also given masterclasses at the Royal College of Music, University of Cambridge and Tsinghua University.

Yundi has promoted Chinese traditional music worldwide. He recorded traditional Chinese folk melodies but also world-premiere songs, aiming to promote Chinese keyboard music.

== Discography ==

Yundi’s discography contains 16 studio albums. He has also made five contributions to compilation albums with Deutsche Grammophon not under his name and featured in three video items, his 2005 and 2010 concert, as well as his documentary &quot;The Young Romantic: A Portrait of Yundi&quot;.

Yundi signed an exclusive contract with Deutsche Grammophon in 2001 and released his first album &quot;Chopin&quot; in early 2002, which contains the works of Chopin. In 2003, the year of Yundi&#x27;s Carnegie Hall debut, Deutsche Grammophon released his second album &quot;Liszt&quot;, an all-Liszt CD. It was given the title &quot;Best CD of the Year&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which also referred to his 2008 release of &quot;Prokofiev&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 and Ravel&#x27;s Piano Concerto in G major&quot; as one of the best classical CDs of the year. Yundi continued to record for Deutsche Grammophon until October 2008, releasing a total of 6 studio albums with the label.

In 2010, Yundi began to record with EMI Classics, with whom he signed an exclusive recording contract to record Chopin’s complete solo piano works. His first EMI release, &quot;Chopin: Nocturnes&quot;, was released in March 2010. He subsequently released &quot;Live In Beijing&quot; and &quot;Red Piano&quot;, releasing a total of 3 studio albums with the label.

In May 2012, Yundi officially signed with Universal Music Group and cooperated with Deutsche Grammophon once again. He then released recordings of &quot;Beethoven&quot;, &quot;The art of YUNDI&quot;, &quot;Emperor Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Chopin Preludes&quot; and &quot;Chopin Ballades Berceuse Mazurkas&quot;, a total of five studio albums.

In December 2019, Yundi signed with Warner Classics. He soon released a new album on its label, &quot;Chopin’s Piano Concertos Nos. 1 &amp; 2&quot;, in January 2020. In this recording, he not only played the piano, but also conducted the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra from the piano bench. Yundi released his latest album &quot;&quot; on 5 April 2024, with Warner Classics.

Yundi has achieved considerable commercial and critical success. His albums have ranked on &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, including the Top Classical Albums.

==Personal life==
Yundi owns a cat named Musigny. His hobbies are listening to Verdi accompanied by good red wine, and drinking tea while listening to jazz. His role-model is Chopin.

===Foodie===

Yundi enjoys cuisine across the globe, as he believes that music styles of places can be found from food. He particularly likes crabs. He is also good at cooking, especially Sichuan cuisine twice-cooked pork.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 2001, Yundi donated a portion of the sales revenue of his first CD “Yundi Li: Chopin” to United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund, aiming to benefit children living in China’s economically disadvantaged areas.

Soon after the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake, Yundi cancelled his European concerts to perform in a fundraising concert in Beijing, along with several other famous musicians of Sichuan origin. Funds raised at the concert were donated to helping rebuild schools in Wenchuan County and providing mental healing services for children affected by the earthquake. On November 29, 2008, right before the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, Yundi headlined a charity concert held in the Bird’s Nest Stadium to support people disabled by the earthquake.

On January 11, 2011, before a charity piano recital in Beijing, Yundi told reporters that &quot;Charity is just like music which comes from deep inside my heart. I can express my love for society and my country through my fingers, just like Chopin did.&quot; This recital was for the individuals and companies that had contributed to the efforts of the Red Cross Society of China in 2010. During the recital, Yundi was honored as the Music Ambassador of the Chinese Red Cross Foundation.

Joining forces with I DO Fund of China Charity Federation in 2016, Yundi helped build the first music classroom and library for Puma Jiangtang Elementary School, the school with the highest altitude (5373 meters) in Tibet. The music classroom was named after Yundi. At the opening ceremony on September 1, also the first day of the new school year, Yundi taught the Tibetan children to play the piano hoping to help them open the door to music exploration.

=== Arrest for allegedly hiring a sex worker===
On 21 October 2021, after a tip-off by public informants referred to as the Chaoyang masses, Yundi was detained by Beijing police for allegedly hiring a prostitute. Under Chinese law, Yundi could be detained for up to 15 days and fined up to 5000 yuan ($782) for illegally soliciting a sex worker. The Chinese Musicians&#x27; Association subsequently declared that it would revoke Yundi&#x27;s membership. Jerome A. Cohen, a New York University law professor specializing in the Chinese law, called the &quot;lack of transparency&quot; about his case &quot;concerning&quot;, noting that prostitution is a &quot;time-honored Communist Party claim against political opponents&quot;. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, there has thus far been no evidence that indicates the detention is politically motivated.

On 16 March 2022, the United States Department of Justice released a document that includes a detail suggesting &quot;the derogatory information regarding the Pianist may have been manufactured&quot;. Multiple news sources reported that &quot;the Pianist&quot; is an apparent reference to Yundi.

<doc id="959184" wikidata="Q478743" url="?curid=959184" title="Academic Ranking of World Universities">
<text>The Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), also known as the Shanghai Ranking, is one of the annual publications of world university rankings. The league table was originally compiled and issued by Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2003, making it the first global university ranking with multifarious indicators.

Since 2009, ARWU has been published and copyrighted annually by Shanghai Ranking Consultancy, an organization focusing on higher education that is not legally subordinated to any universities or government agencies. In 2011, a board of international advisory consisting of scholars and policy researchers was established to provide suggestions. The publication currently includes global league tables for institutions as a whole and for a selection of individual subjects, alongside independent regional &quot;Greater China Ranking&quot; and &quot;Macedonian HEIs Ranking&quot;.

ARWU is regarded as one of the three most influential and widely observed university rankings, alongside &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; and &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;. It has received positive feedback for its objectivity and methodology, but draws wide criticism as it fails to adjust for the size of the institution, and thus larger institutions tend to rank above smaller ones.

== Global rankings ==
=== Overall ===
==== Methodology ====
==== Reception ====
EU Research Headlines reported the ARWU&#x27;s work on 31 December 2003: &quot;The universities were carefully evaluated using several indicators of research performance.&quot; A survey on higher education published by &quot;The Economist&quot; in 2005 commented ARWU as &quot;the most widely used annual ranking of the world&#x27;s research universities.&quot; In 2010, &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; called ARWU &quot;the best-known and most influential global ranking of universities&quot; and Philip G. Altbach named ARWU&#x27;s &#x27;consistency, clarity of purpose, and transparency&#x27; as significant strengths. University of Oxford Chancellor Chris Patten has said &quot;the methodology looks fairly solid ... it looks like a pretty good stab at a fair comparison.&quot; While ARWU has originated in China, the ranking have been praised for being unbiased towards Asian institutions, especially Chinese institutions.

==== Criticism ====
The ranking has been criticised for &quot;relying too much on award factors&quot; thus undermining the importance of quality of instruction and humanities. A 2007 paper published in the journal &quot;Scientometrics&quot; found that the results from the Shanghai rankings could not be reproduced from raw data using the method described by Liu and Cheng. A 2013 paper in the same journal finally showed how the Shanghai ranking results could be reproduced. In a report from April 2009, J-C. Billaut, D. Bouyssou and Ph. Vincke analyse how the ARWU works, using their insights as specialists of Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). Their main conclusions are that the criteria used are not relevant; that the aggregation methodology has a number of major problems; and that insufficient attention has been paid to fundamental choices of criteria.

The ARWU researchers themselves, N.C. Liu and Y. Cheng, think that the quality of universities cannot be precisely measured by mere numbers and any ranking must be controversial. They suggest that university and college rankings should be used with caution and their methodologies must be understood clearly before reporting or using the results. ARWU has been criticised by the European Commission as well as some EU member states for &quot;favour[ing] Anglo-Saxon higher education institutions&quot;. For instance, ARWU is repeatedly criticised in France, where it triggers an annual controversy, focusing on its ill-adapted character to the French academic system and the unreasonable weight given to research often performed decades ago. It is also criticised in France for its use as a motivation for merging universities into larger ones.

Several methods for ranking universities were analyzed. Many scholars proposed developing new methodologies for global university rankings, expressing concerns about bias against universities in the Arab region within current ranking systems. They emphasized the need to adjust the weighting of indicators to account for overlooked institutional differences.

Indeed, a further criticism has been that the metrics used are not independent of university size, e.g. number of publications or award winners will mechanically add as universities are grouped, independently of research (or teaching) quality; thus a merger between two equally-ranked institutions will significantly increase the merged institutions&#x27; score and give it a higher ranking, without any change in quality.

=== Subjects ===
There are two categories in ARWU&#x27;s disciplinary rankings: broad subject fields and specific subjects. The methodology is similar to that adopted in the overall table, including award factors, paper citation, and the number of highly cited scholars.

== Regional rankings ==
Considering the development of specific areas, two independent regional league tables with different methodologies were launched – Ranking of Top Universities in Greater China and Best Chinese Universities Ranking.

Best Chinese Universities Ranking was first released in 2015. Ranking of Top Universities in Greater China was first released in 2011.

<doc id="959186" wikidata="Q157100" url="?curid=959186" title="Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy">
<text>Margaret of Austria (; ; ; ; 10 January 1480 – 1 December 1530) was Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1507 to 1515 and again from 1519 until her death in 1530. She was the first of many female regents in the Netherlands. She was variously the Princess of Asturias, Duchess of Savoy, and was born an Archduchess of Austria.

Her life until her mid-twenties was dominated by her importance in political marriages, and the early death of many of her close family. She was engaged for three marriage alliances, and completed two, but both husbands died within a few years: six months in 1497 in the case of John, Prince of Asturias, and three years with Philibert II, Duke of Savoy, from 1501. Her mother had died when she was two, and her only brother in 1506. 

Thereafter she made a success, according to most historians, of the highly important role of regent or governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, for firstly her father Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, then her nephew Charles V, who were both forced to spend most of their time in Germany and other parts of the growing Habsburg empire. 

She spent most of her life in the Netherlands. Her usual name comes from being a member of the Austrian Habsburg family; she hardly went there, and probably neither spoke nor read German, unlike French and Castilian. The German texts in her extensive library were in French translations.

==Childhood and life in France==
Margaret was born on 10 January 1480 in Brussels and baptised in what is now the cathedral there, named after her step-grandmother, Margaret of York. She was the second child and only daughter of Maximilian of Austria (future Holy Roman Emperor) and Mary of Burgundy, co-sovereigns of the Low Countries. In 1482, her mother died and her four-year-old brother Philip the Handsome succeeded her as sovereign of the Low Countries, with her father as his regent.
The same year her mother died, King Louis XI of France signed the Treaty of Arras, whereby her father promised to give her hand in marriage to Louis&#x27;s son, the Dauphin Charles. The engagement took place in 1483, and on the death of his father he became Charles VIII of France later in the year, at the age of 13. With Franche-Comté and Artois as her dowry, Margaret was transferred to the guardianship of Louis XI, until he died in August. She was to be raised as a fille de France and prepared for her future role as Queen of France in the household of the Queen Mother Charlotte of Savoy, mostly at the Château d&#x27;Amboise; but Queen Charlotte also died in December 1483.

Now under the supervision of Charles&#x27;s sister, Anne de Beaujeu, regent of France, and her governess Madame de Segré, Margaret received a fine education alongside several noble children, amongst whom was Louise of Savoy, four years older, who was later to become her sister-in-law.

Although their union was political, the young Margaret developed a genuine affection for Charles. However, he renounced the treaty in the autumn of 1491 and forcibly married Margaret&#x27;s former stepmother Anne, Duchess of Brittany, for political reasons. The French court had ceased treating Margaret as their future queen but she could not return to her ex-stepmother&#x27;s (Anne of Brittany) court until June 1493 after the Treaty of Senlis had been signed in May that year. She was hurt by Charles&#x27;s actions and was left with a feeling of enduring resentment towards the House of Valois, even after Charles&#x27;s death in 1498.

When she met her father in Maastricht as a young teenager, she had not seen him since she left for France at the age of two, but they got on well, unlike his difficult relationship with Philip.

==Marriages==
===Princess of Asturias===
To achieve an alliance with Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, Maximilian started negotiating the marriage of their only son and heir, John, Prince of Asturias, to Margaret, as well as the marriage of their daughter Juana to Philip. Margaret left the Netherlands for Spain late in 1496. Her engagement to the Prince of Asturias seemed doomed when the ship carrying her to Spain hit a storm in the Bay of Biscay. In haste, she wrote her own epitaph should she not reach Spain: 

She had had a proxy marriage back in Mechelen, including symbolically lying on a bed next to Francisco de Rojas y Escobar, acting as Spanish ambassador. However, Margaret survived the storm, and in February 1497 her entire fleet was still waiting in Southampton in England for the weather to clear up. Margaret actually married Prince John on 3 April 1497 in Burgos Cathedral. Tragically, John died of a fever after only six months, on 4 October. Margaret was left pregnant but gave birth to a premature stillborn daughter on 2 April 1498. Margaret stayed in Spain until September 1499 before returning home. In the meantime it was suggested that she should teach her teenage sister-in-law Catherine of Aragon French.

When she was on her way back, her nephew, the future Emperor Charles V was born. Her brother, Philip, sent an express messenger to his sister, &quot;begging her to hasten back so that she could hold the child in her hands at the font during the baptism.&quot; When she arrived, she pressured Philip to name the baby Maximilian, after their father, but Philip chose to name him Charles, after their maternal grandfather Charles the Bold. She was Charles&#x27;s godmother, and was later to play the main part in raising him after his father&#x27;s early death.

By this time, the unexpected deaths of Isabella of Aragon, Queen of Portugal, elder sister of John, Prince of Asturias, in 1498, and her infant son Miguel in 1500, left Joanna and eventually Charles the heirs to the thrones of Castille and Aragon, while he also inherited the Netherlands and the Habsburg claim to the Holy Roman Empire.

===Duchess of Savoy===
In 1501, Margaret married Philibert II, Duke of Savoy (1480–1504), whose realm played a decisive role in the rivalry between France and the Habsburgs in Italy on account of its strategic position in the Western Alps. Though the same age as Margaret, this was his second marriage. They had a very stable relationship for those 3 years, mostly living not in Savoy proper, but in Bresse, then Savoyard territory on the eastern borders of Burgundy (today in France). 

When Margaret came to Savoy, the government was in the hands of René, Philibert&#x27;s bastard brother. Margaret fought hard to strip away his powers and possessions, even involving Maximilian (as Holy Roman Emperor, he was overlord of Savoy) to nullify the letters that gave René legitimacy. René, being declared a traitor, took refuge in France and was welcomed by his half-sister Louise of Savoy, mother of Francis I. She then took hold of the government, while her husband focused on private hobbies like hunting (which she did share with him). She summoned councils, appointed officers, and when her brother Philip visited, she discussed and approved his plan regarding a continued rapprochement with France.
In September 1504 Philibert died of pleurisy. Grief-stricken, Margaret threw herself out of a window, but was saved. After being persuaded to bury her husband, she had his heart embalmed so she could keep it with her forever. Her court historian and poet Jean Lemaire de Belges gave her the title &quot;Dame de deuil&quot; (Lady of Mourning). She remained in Savoy for two years as a widow, beginning the lengthy construction of the lavishly-designed Royal Monastery of Brou in Bresse (now eastern France) to house the tombs of Philibert, his mother Margaret of Bourbon (1438–1483) and eventually herself. She returned to the Netherlands after the sudden death of her brother Philip the Handsome in September 1506, at her father&#x27;s request.

In 1505 Maximilian and Philip had tried to arrange a match with Henry VII of England, 48 years old at the time, but Margaret refused. A portrait, probably five years old, was sent to England.

Queen Isabella died in late 1504, and Philip and Juana went to Castile to claim the crown. After Philip&#x27;s death, Charles was the new sovereign of the Low Countries, but he was only six years old, and his mother Juana could not act as regent because her unstable mental state. Her Castilian subjects would also not allow their ruler to live outside the kingdom. Preoccupied with German affairs, her father, Emperor Maximilian I, named Margaret governor of the Low Countries and guardian of Charles in 1507, along with her nieces Eleanor, Isabella and Mary (then all children, who would later marry foreign monarchs). Only her nephew Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor (as he became some fifty years later), was brought up in Spain in the charge of his grandfather Ferdinand II of Aragon, and when adult was sent to govern Austria. Margaret became the only woman elected as its ruler by the representative assembly of Franche-Comté, with her title confirmed in 1509.

Some report that Margaret was considered a foreigner because of her childhood at the French court. According to Blockmans and others though, Margaret, Philip as well as Charles V were considered indigenous; only Maximilian was always a foreigner. The Governess served as an intermediary between her father and her nephew&#x27;s subjects in the Netherlands from her newly built palace at Mechelen. During a remarkably successful career, she broke new ground for women rulers.

In 1520, Charles made Margaret his governor-general in gratitude for her services. She was the only regent he ever re-appointed indefinitely from 1519 until her death in on 1 December 1530. 

Tupu Ylä-Anttila opines that Margaret acted as de facto queen consort in a political sense, first to her father and then Charles V, &quot;absent rulers&quot; who needed a representative dynastic presence that also complemented their characteristics. Her queenly virtues helped her to play the role of diplomat and peace-maker, as well as guardian and educator of future rulers, whom Maximilian called &quot;our children&quot; or &quot;our common children&quot; in letters to Margaret. This was a model that developed as part of the solution for the emerging Habsburg composite monarchy and would continue to serve later generations. As an older relative and former guardian, she had more power with Charles than with her father Maximilian, who treated her cordially but occasionally acted in a threatening manner.

The authors of &quot;The Promised Lands: The Low Countries Under Burgundian Rule, 1369–1530&quot; credit Margaret with keeping the provinces together as well as fulfilling the demands for peace from the Netherlandish Estates. Despite Louis XII&#x27;s attempts to regain control of certain territories and to interfere in Guelders, Friesland and Liege, cooperation between the regent, the Privy Council and the Estates General maintained the integrity of the Burgundian inheritance.

===Foreign policy===
Margaret soon found herself at war with France over the question of Charles&#x27;s requirement to pay homage to the French king for the County of Flanders (which was outside the Empire; and while a long-standing portion of the inherited Burgundian titles &amp; provinces, legally still within France). In response, she persuaded Emperor Maximilian to end the war with King Louis XII. On November 1508, she journeyed to Cambrai to assist in the formation of the League of Cambrai, which ended (for a time) the possibility of a French invasion of the Low Countries, redirecting French attention to Northern Italy.

The Estates preferred to maintain peace with France and Guelders. But Charles of Egmont, the de facto lord of Guelders, continued to cause trouble. In 1511, she made an alliance with England and besieged Venlo, but Charles of Egmont invaded Holland so the siege had to be lifted. When she asked her father (who had fought Guelders even without the Low Countries&#x27;s help during the time of Philip, and then helped Philip to achieve his 1505 victory over Guelders) to come to help, he suggested to her that the Estates in the Low Countries should defend themselves, forcing her to sign the 1513 treaty with Charles, recognizing him as Duke of Guelders and Count of Zutphen. In 1514, he marched into Arnhem – a clear breach of the treaty. The Habsburg Netherlands would only be able to incorporate Guelders and Zutphen under Charles V.

According to James D. Tracy, Maximilian and Margaret were reasonable in demanding more stern measures against Guelders, but their critics in the Estates General (that had continuously voted against providing funds for wars against Guelders) and among the nobles naively thought that Charles of Egmont could be controlled by maintaining the peaceful relationship with the King of France, his patron. After Charles&#x27;s brief personal rule (1514–1517), Margaret returned to witness Guelders&#x27;s most stunning military success in decades, together with a horrible trail of destruction their Black Band mercenaries left through Friesland and Holland. Many of Charles V&#x27;s Netherlands subjects, including leading Humanists like Erasmus and Hadrianus Barlandus unreasonably mistrusted their government, suspecting that princes (Maximilian, in particular) were concocting clever schemes just to expand the Habsburg dominion and extracting money (in fact, Maximilian also did hope to employ the wealth of the Low Countries to finance his projects elsewhere – he hardly succeeded though). The inaction of the experienced commander Rudolf von Anhalt during the sacking of the town of Tienen in Brabant, in particular, made Barlandus suspect a sinister motive (in reality, von Anhalt was ordered by Margaret to avoid direct engagement until he had more troops).

By 1512, she told her father that the Netherlands existed on peace and trade, and thus she would declare neutrality while using foreign armies and funds to wage wars. She played the key role in bringing together the participants of Holy League: the pope, the Swiss, Henry VIII, Ferdinand II of Aragon and her father Maximilian (he joined the League only as Emperor, as not as guardian of his grandson Charles and thus, the Low Countries&#x27; neutrality was maintained). The league targeted France. The treaty also would not prevent the more adventurous Netherlands seigneurs from serving under Maximilian and Henry when they attacked the French later.

Following this strategy, in 1513, at the head of Henry VIII&#x27;s army, Maximilian gained a victory against the French at the Battle of the Spurs, at little cost to himself or his daughter (in fact according to Margaret, the Low Countries got a profit of one million of gold from supplying the English army). For the sake of his grandson Charles&#x27;s Burgundian lands, he ordered Thérouanne&#x27;s walls to be demolished (the stronghold had often served as a backdoor for French interference in the Low Countries).
After Maximillian I&#x27;s death in 1519, Margaret and young Charles (then 18) began to negotiate the latter&#x27;s election as Holy Roman Emperor despite the opposition of the papacy and France. The Governess instead supported her younger nephew Archduke Ferdinand. However, Charles refused to withdraw. Using a combination of diplomacy and bribery, Margaret played a crucial role in the election of Charles as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, defeating the candidacy of King Francis I of France, who from this day forward became Charles&#x27; great rival in the struggle for pre-eminence in Europe.
As Emperor, Charles V inherited the long-running disputes with the Kings of France over possession of the Duchy of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples. Though Charles preferred the Netherlands to many of his possessions, his many kingdoms (and many wars) required him to travel throughout Europe. His great victory at Pavia over Francis I in 1525 in which he took the French King prisoner and then freed him in exchange for his sons as hostages, led once more to French invasion of the Low Countries. Francis reneged on promises to renounce overlordship of Artois, Flanders and the Franche-Cômté, much less return the much-desired Burgundian core territory, the Duchy itself centered at Dijon, as soon as he was safely back in France.

Once again, Margaret proved a remarkably capable ruler of the Netherlands, holding off the forces of the League of Cognac – i.e. the French (1526–29) and then negotiating the &quot;Paix de Dames/ Ladies Peace&quot;. Journeying to Cambrai again, Margaret reunited with Louise of Savoy, her sister-in-law and mother of Francis I. They negotiated the end of a war that France could no longer sustain; the Habsburgs lost Burgundy proper forever, but France gave up its claims to legal overlordship of Flanders, Artois and the &quot;Free&quot; County of Burgundy (Franche-Comté).

===Economy===

Margaret had an aptitude for business, and maintained the prosperity of the Netherlands. She negotiated the restoration of the 1496 trade agreement known as the Intercursus Magnus with England, which was favorable to Flemish textile interests and brought huge profits. Because of the trade, industry and wealth of the regions and cities she oversaw, the Low Countries was an important source of income for the Imperial treasury.

In 1524, she signed a trade agreement with Frederick I of Denmark (the condition was that Holland would not support Christian II) that ensured the regular supply of grain into the Netherlands. Christian later managed to get the support from Charles V thanks to the efforts of his secretary Cornelis de Schepper, but Margaret refused to follow even Charles&#x27;s order and insisted on placing the economical interests of the Netherlands above dynastic interests (Christian was the husband of Isabella of Austria, thus brother-in-law to Charles sister of Charles and nephew-in-law to Margaret).

Margaret provided funds and war supplies for her nephew&#x27;s troops, especially against King Francis I of France and the German Protestants. In following years, Habsburg forces consolidated their hold over Tournai, Friesland, Utrecht, and Overijssel, which became part of the Habsburg Netherlands.

===Internal conflict===
Although the Low Countries was not previously centralized, Margaret&#x27;s reign was a period of relative peace for the Netherlands. The exception was the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, especially in the north. The first martyrs, Jan van Essen and Hendrik Vos, were burnt at the stake in Brussels in 1523.

==Court==
Margaret ended up raising her nephew and nieces in her palace in Mechelen, known as the &quot;Court of Savoy&quot;. She was visited by the great humanists of her time, including Erasmus, Adrian of Utrecht (later Pope Adrian VI), and Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa. Agrippa dedicated his arguably feminist work &quot;Declamation on the Nobility and Preeminence of the Female Sex&quot; to her. The Governor was so impressed with diplomat Sir Thomas Boleyn&#x27;s charm that she offered his daughter Anne Boleyn (future Queen consort of England) a temporary place in her household; she was there from the spring of 1513 to the late summer of 1514, when she moved to Paris. Margaret reported to her father that she was &quot;so presentable and so pleasant, considering her youthful age, that I am more beholden to you for sending her to me, than you to me.&quot;

Once she was declared Governor of the Netherlands, Margaret purchased the Hof van Savoye, located in the Korte Maagdenstraat (Short Virgins Street) in Mechelen, which was to be her main residence. She found the existing palace too small and started an ambitious expansion campaign in 1507. From 1517 to 1530, the architect Rombout II Keldermans furthered the project along the Keizerstraat (Emperor Street) and modified what became the rear wing, which faces the Palace of Margaret of York.

==Patronage of the arts==
Margaret owned or controlled a very significant art collection, which she expanded considerably; the ownership of works inherited by her or Charles V from their Burgundian ancestors is not always clear. Most of this was left to Charles and her niece and successor as governor, Mary of Hungary, and in 1558 inherited by Philip II of Spain, to become part of the Spanish Royal collection, with some eventually going to the Habsburg imperial collections in Vienna. Many of the Flemish paintings of before 1530 in the Prado in Madrid passed through the collection. The smaller collection in her palace in Mechelen is unusually well understood through surviving inventories, made in 1499, 1516 and 1523–24. The last of these locates the room, and sometimes the exact position, of works, and includes frank opinions on the quality of the more important that suggest Margaret herself made them.

The 1523–24 inventory records a total of 385 paintings, sculptures, tapestries and embroideries (not counting prints and drawings), 132 exotic natural objects and artefacts such as Aztec feather work and carved coral. These, one of the earliest collections of objects from the New World, came via Hernán Cortés, who presented Charles V with treasures received from the Aztec King Moctezuma in 1519. Several of these treasures were sent to Mechelen as a gift from her nephew in 1523. Clocks, board games and &quot;curiosities&quot; made up 47 items, and there were 380 items in her library, including manuscripts, printed books and charts such as genealogies. Then there was a good quantity of metal items such as dining &quot;plate&quot;, much of it silver-gilt.
The collection was carefully laid out as a &quot;proto-museum&quot;, and it appears Margaret often gave notable visitors guided tours herself. There was a large number of portraits of Margaret&#x27;s Burgundian ancestors, her Habsburg contemporaries, and her two husbands and their relatives. There were also seven portraits of members of the Tudor dynasty, and Louis XII of France and his daughter Claude of France, as well as portraits of some of her officials. Most of all these were probably gifts from the sitters, just as Margaret gave copies of her own portraits.

Much the most famous painting in her collection was the &quot;Arnolfini Portrait&quot;, a 1434 oil on panel painting by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck, now in the National Gallery, London. It is a full-length double portrait, believed to depict the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, presumably in their residence at the Flemish city of Bruges. It was the first item in the 1516 inventory, described as &quot;a large picture which is called Hernoul le Fin with his wife in a chamber, which was given to Madame by Don Diego, whose arms are on the cover of the said picture; done by the painter Johannes.&quot; A note in the margin says &quot;It is necessary to put on a lock to close it: which Madame has ordered to be done.&quot; The identification of the sitter rests entirely on this and a similar note in the later inventory of 1523-24 (where Arnolfini is now &quot;Arnoult Fin&quot;). This was inherited by Mary of Hungary, and then Philip II of Spain, remaining in the Spanish royal collection until looted in the Napoleonic Wars by the French, and then apparently re-looted from them by the British.

Although she lived during the less distinguished end of the period of Early Netherlandish painting, she had several painters at her court, including the Master of the Legend of the Magdalen and Pieter van Coninxloo, mainly portrait painters (it is possible they were the same person). Seven versions survive of her portrait in widow&#x27;s costume (the &quot;deuil blanc&quot; or &quot;white mourning&quot; veils) by Bernaert van Orley of about 1515-1520; the prime version is believed to be that at Brou, while others would have been sent as gifts to her relations, other rulers and perhaps friends. Van Orley, arguably the leading Brussels painter of the day, became her court artist in 1518. The workshop version of the portrait in the British Royal Collection (loaned to the National Portrait Gallery, London) is &quot;probably&quot; the same as that recorded in a 1543 inventory of Henry VIII.

The German sculptor Conrad Meit worked for her for many years, and was greatly involved in her main architectural project, the monastery at Brou. He carved the effigies on her tomb, and several other portraits of her, including intimate small busts in pearwood. 

===Library===
Like other women in the royal houses of France, Spain and Burgundy Margaret possessed a very rich library for the period, in her case including a group of illuminated manuscripts that are supreme masterpieces in several styles. She was an important patron of the Ghent–Bruges school of manuscript painters, at the peak of their achievement in the first years of the 16th century, and inherited or was given key works from earlier periods. She inherited most of the books of her step-grandmother Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy, and others from her mother, including the Hours of Mary of Burgundy (now National Library of Austria). She returned from her period in Savoy with the famous Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry, which had belonged to (and was added to by) Charles I, Duke of Savoy (d. 1490), father of Philibert&#x27;s first wife. 

Already in 1499 an inventory recorded six books of hours, a missal, and a breviary. She also collected poetry, historical and ethical treatises, which included the works of Christine de Pizan. 

She was given the incomplete Sforza Hours (now British Library) by Bona of Savoy, widowed Duchess of Milan, who had commissioned it around 1490; Margaret had her court artist Gerard Horenbout complete it, probably in 1517–20, several years after she received it in Savoy. It is thought very likely that the Spinola Hours (Getty Museum) was commissioned by her in the 1510s.

In his travel journal of 1517–1518, the Italian canon Antonio de Beatis described Margaret&#x27;s &quot;highly decorated library for women. The books are all written in French and bound in velvet with silver-gilt clasps&quot;.

She possessed several &quot;chansonniers&quot; that contained works by Josquin des Prez, Johannes Ockeghem, Jacob Obrecht and Pierre de la Rue, who was her favourite composer. Margaret ordered several splendid music manuscripts from Pierre Alamire to send as gifts to her relatives and political relations.

===Portraits===
==Death and burial==
On 15 November 1530, Margaret stepped on a piece of broken glass. She initially thought little of the injury but gangrene set in and the leg had to be amputated. She decided to arrange all her affairs first, designating Charles V as her sole heir and writing him a letter in which she asked him to maintain peace with France and England. On the night of 30 November, the doctors came to operate on her. They gave her a dose of opium to lessen the pain, but it was reportedly so strong that she would not wake up again. She died between midnight and one o&#x27;clock.

She was succeeded as governor by Charles&#x27;s sister Mary of Hungary (or of Austria), then 25, another widow who was recalled after her husband Louis II of Hungary was killed in the Battle of Mohacs against the Turks in 1526.
Margaret was buried alongside her second husband at Bourg-en-Bresse, in the mausoleum of the Royal Monastery of Brou that she previously commissioned. Her very elaborate tomb was by Conrat Meit, her court sculptor for many years. It has two reclining effigies, the upper in formal regalia as Duchess of Savoy, and the lower as if asleep, with her hair down.

There is a standing bronze statue of Margaret of Austria in the group around the cenotaph of her father Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck, which also has a relief panel of her return from France after the French marriage proposal collapsed. Clive Holland remarks that it must have required courage to place the scene next to depictions of the father&#x27;s triumphs, as at the time the rejection was a bitter experience for them both. There is a statue of 1849 of Margaret next to St. Rumbold&#x27;s Cathedral in Mechelen, Belgium.

==Heraldry==
==Depiction in media==
Margaret of Austria is portrayed by Spanish actress Úrsula Corberó in the TV show &quot;Isabel&quot;.

A wildly inaccurate fictionalized version of Margaret can be found in the play &quot;The Unhappy Penitent&quot; by Catharine Trotter, where she appears as the character &#x27;Margarite&#x27;. In the play, Margarite is in love with René II, Duke of Lorraine, although there is no indication that the two ever met. Also, the Duke of Brittany is in love with Margarite, but he died in 1488, when the historical Margaret was eight. He was the father of Anne of Brittany, later Margaret&#x27;s replacement, who came to France to marry Charles VIII; her father&#x27;s death without a male heir is what spurred the various betrothals of Anne.

In &quot;The White Princess&quot; series she is portrayed by Zazie Hayhurst.

==Biography==
Hamud was proclaimed Sultan of Zanzibar on 20 July 1902, following the death of his father, the seventh Sultan, two days earlier. There was a regency until he attained majority. 

He served only a few years as sultan because of illness. On 9 December 1911 he abdicated in favour of his brother-in-law Khalifa bin Harub Al-Busaid.

<text>Rongerik Atoll or Rongdrik Atoll (Marshallese: , ) is an unpopulated coral atoll of 17 islands in the Pacific Ocean, and is located in the Ralik Chain of the Marshall Islands, approximately east of Bikini Atoll. Its total land area is only , but it encloses a lagoon of .

In 1946, Rongerik was briefly inhabited by Bikini Islanders who, working with United States Navy moved here temporarily, when Bikini was used for conducting nuclear tests. However, the islanders could not get enough food to support the population, so after two years they had to relocate again, choosing Kili Island.

Politically it was annexed by the German Empire in 1885, then seized by the Japanese in WW1, then the United States took it during WW2. After WW2, it was part of a United Nations trust territory, eventually it became part of the Marshall Islands, an island nation founded in 1986, but with a compact of association with the United States.

==History==

Rongerik Atoll was claimed by the German Empire along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1885. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan, although the island was uninhabited. The island became part of the vast US Naval Base Marshall Islands. Following the end of World War II, it came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986.

It is most famous as the temporary location from March 7, 1946, through March 14, 1948, of the Bikini Atoll&#x27;s indigenous population while the United States government conducted the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests. After months of food shortages and malnutrition, they were moved first to Kwajalein and finally to Kili Island. On March 1, 1954, Rongerik was exposed to radioactive fallout as a result of the detonation of Operation Castle&#x27;s Bravo.

According to Spanish researcher Emilio Pastor in a paper submitted to his government in 1948, a number of small islands in Micronesia (Kapingamarangi or &quot;Pescadores&quot;, Mapia or &quot;Güedes&quot;, Kiritimati or &quot;Matador&quot;, Rongerik or &quot;Coroa&quot; and others) continue legally under Spanish sovereignty. This is because the text of the German–Spanish Treaty of 1899 which transferred sovereignty of certain Spanish possessions in the Pacific to Germany, namely the Northern Mariana Islands (except Guam) and the Caroline Islands (including Palau), failed to include these smaller islands. Although the Spanish government studied the case in 1949 and accepted this interpretation, it has not asserted its claim to the islands.

<text>Moses Austin (October 4, 1761 – June 10, 1821) was an American businessman and pioneer who played a large part in the development of the lead industry in the early United States, especially in southwest Virginia and Missouri. He was the father of Stephen F. Austin, one of the earliest American settlers of Texas, which was at the time part of Mexico.

After receiving a land grant from the Spanish Crown in 1820, Moses Austin planned to be the first to establish an American settlement in Spanish Texas, but he died before his dream was realized. On his deathbed, he pleaded with his son to fulfill his dream to colonize Texas. Stephen led the large group of settlers from Missouri who colonized the northern reaches of then-sovereign Mexico in 1825, and in time, the settlers demanded autonomy and later won independence from Mexico under President Antonio López de Santa Anna, thereby establishing the Republic of Texas.

==Biography==
Moses Austin was born October 4, 1761, to Elias Austin and Eunice Phelps Austin in Durham, Connecticut. He is a descendant of Richard Austin on his paternal side. 

In 1784, he moved to Philadelphia to enter the dry goods business with his brother, Stephen. He then moved to Richmond, Virginia, to open a second dry goods store. In 1785, he married into the affluent iron mining family of Mary Brown, who then became known as Mary Brown Austin. The Austins&#x27; second child was born in 1793 and named Stephen Fuller Austin in honor of his father&#x27;s brother and his mother&#x27;s great uncle. Their daughter Emily Austin followed in 1795. A second son, James Elijah Brown Austin, was born in 1803.

Austin sought to start his own mining business in southwestern Virginia, and in 1789 he traveled there to look at a lead mine. Moses saw potential in the site and by 1791 his family had joined him in what is now Wythe County. Moses and his brother Stephen and several other partners and individuals industrialized the area. Several smelters, furnaces, commissaries, blacksmith shops, liveries, and mills were established. The tiny village around the mines became known as &quot;Austinville&quot;, and Moses came to be known as the &quot;Lead King&quot;.

The Austin brothers soon incurred debts, causing the collapse of the company. After the Virginia lead business failed, Moses skipped out to avoid imprisonment and the consequences of debt, which was then customary for debtors in the U.S. under traditional English law (now being developed for U.S. federal and state codes), and looked toward the rich lead deposits in Missouri, then a part of upper Spanish Louisiana. In December 1797, Austin and a companion traveled to investigate the Spanish mines. Stephen remained behind to salvage the Virginia business, creating a rift between the two brothers that would last for much of the rest of their lives. The state of Virginia seized much of the property Moses owned and broke up the various operations, which were later purchased from the state at great discounts by Thomas Jackson and his partners — they would later build the Jackson Ferry Shot Tower, one of the few extant shot towers in United States, at this location. 

In 1798, the Spanish colonial government granted to Moses one league of land (4,428 acres) to undertake lead mining operations. In return he swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown and stated he would settle some families in Missouri. Travelling to Missouri, Austin worked with Francois Valle to identify his claims and to learn the practices of lead mining in Missouri. Valle and other French colonizers had long used enslaved African Americans and enslaved Native Americans to mine, and Austin immediately took to these practices. In 1798, the year of his arrival in Missouri, he purchased at least one enslaved man. Moses greatly expanded the use of enslaved men and women in running mining operations in Missouri. Enslaved African American men were used for the hard, difficult labor of digging the lead ore and processing it. Enslaved boys were forced to man the carts that carried ore from the pits to the smelters. Enslaved women and girls were used to prepare food for the enslaved men who worked the mines, pits, and smelting operations. 

In 1803, Missouri came under the jurisdiction of the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Austin became founder and principal stockholder in the Bank of St. Louis, but the bank failed in the Panic of 1819, causing him to lose his entire fortune. He again sought help from Spain. In 1820, Austin traveled to the Presidio San Antonio de Béxar in Spanish Texas and presented a plan to colonize Texas with Anglo-Americans to Governor Antonio María Martínez. In 1821, the governor asked Austin&#x27;s friend, Erasmo Seguín, to give him the news that he had been awarded a land grant and permission to settle three hundred families in Texas. On Austin&#x27;s return trip, he became ill, and he died in June 1821, shortly after arriving back in Missouri. His son Stephen F. Austin carried out his colonization plan several years later, and led the three hundred families to what became the first Anglo-American settlement in Texas.

In 1885, the legality of Austin&#x27;s Spanish property claims were settled posthumously by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Bryan v. Kennett&quot;.

==Family==
Moses Austin had many relatives who helped settle Texas, including Stephen F. Austin and Emily Austin Perry (daughter), Moses Austin Bryan (grandson), and others. Moses Austin should be distinguished from his grandson Moses Austin Bryan. James Bryan was his first son-in-law; James F. Perry was his second son-in-law. The Missouri State Archives reflect that Moses Austin lived in a mansion called Durham Hall, named for his birth town of Durham, Connecticut.

==Settlement in Texas==
===Motivation to settle===

Moses Austin attempted various economic ventures before his plans to settle in Texas came to fruition. Austin failed to successfully maintain the St. Louis Bank and his financial situation suffered from unfavorable shipment deals. Austin&#x27;s desperation reached a climax in 1820 when a Missouri sheriff threatened to break down his door to collect past debts. Austin&#x27;s son, Stephen F. Austin, also continued to seek employment in Mississippi and Arkansas to help his poor financial situation. In November 1820, Austin learned that the United States passed the Adams–Onís Treaty with Spain, which situated present-day Texas in New Spain&#x27;s territory. Moses Austin hoped the Spanish government would permit free trade with the United States so he left for Texas to try and begin a new economic venture. Mary Brown Austin, Moses Austin&#x27;s wife, wrote to her cousin explaining Moses&#x27;s plans to colonize Texas in order to provide for their family.

===Negotiations with Spain===

Austin&#x27;s primary intention was to create a trading venture on the coast of Texas to allow the United States to trade with New Spain. On December 23, 1820, Austin arrived in San Antonio to begin negotiations with the Spanish government to establish a trading post. After some difficulty on his own, Austin paired with a Spanish interpreter, Felipe Enrique Neri, Baron de Bastrop, who agreed to join Austin and plan a settlement called &quot;Austina&quot; which would be located somewhere on the coast of Texas. On December 26, 1820, Austin and Felipe Enrique Neri, Baron de Bastrop presented a formal petition to Governor Antonio María Martínez. They requested permission to bring three hundred families to a port in Texas. Most importantly, Austin insisted that the settlers were former subjects of Spain and would be willing to defend the land against foreign enemies. Austin convinced Spain to reinstate the empresario system in Texas, which resulted in permission to begin a new settlement in Texas. This outdated reward system granted tracts of land to immigrants who pledged their allegiance to the Spanish crown. Therefore, Austin&#x27;s settlement was contingent upon its allegiance to the Spanish Crown.

===Plan for settlement===
After returning from successful negotiations in San Antonio, Austin returned to Missouri to recruit settlers for his new settlement. In April, he created a &quot;Form of Contract for Emigration to Texas&quot; which detailed the obligations of each member joining the settlement in Texas. Austin required emigrants to help build community structures. He also ordered the settlers to own a &quot;Spanish carbine&quot;, a type of gun, to protect the settlement. Austin&#x27;s relationship with the settlers he recruited was not one of mutual respect, but rather he employed the settlers. Austin contracted his settlers to work from their departure in May, until the following January. In return, Austin guaranteed transportation along with the necessary tools and provisions to begin the settlement. Although Moses Austin died prior to his planned departure, his son, Stephen F. Austin, continued his efforts to colonize Texas. Austin triggered such a substantial movement of people into Texas that the land became inundated with Americans. Austin&#x27;s push to settle Texas contributed to the Texas Revolution in 1836 which foreshadowed Texas&#x27;s integration into the United States in 1845.

==Death==
Austin died of pneumonia. His tomb is located in Potosi, Missouri.

<text>Jamshid bin Abdullah Al Busaidi, (; 16 September 1929 – 30 December 2024) was a Zanzibari royal who was the last reigning Sultan of Zanzibar. He was deposed in the Zanzibar Revolution, after the United Kingdom gave up its British protectorate.

==Early life==
Sultan Jamshid was born in Zanzibar Town, Zanzibar on 16 September 1929. He was educated in Alexandria and Beirut. He also served in the British Royal Navy for 2 years, gaining leadership experience before undertaking administrative roles under his grandfather, Sultan Khalifa bin Harub. 

==Sultan of Zanzibar==
Jamshid ruled Zanzibar from 1 July 1963 to 12 January 1964. On 10 December 1963, the United Kingdom gave up its British protectorate over the already self-governing Zanzibar, leaving it as a constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth under Jamshid, responsible for its own defence and foreign affairs. But this state of affairs was short-lived. Without British protection the Sultan was soon overthrown by the majority Africans in the Zanzibar Revolution.

==Life in exile==
Jamshid fled into exile, firstly to Oman, but was not allowed to settle there permanently. He later moved to the United Kingdom, settling in Portsmouth with his wife and children. 

While his children and siblings were allowed to settle in Oman in the 1980s, the Omani government under Sultan Qaboos bin Said continually denied Jamshid&#x27;s requests to join them, citing security reasons. In September 2020, the new government of Sultan Haitham bin Tariq granted him permission to return to his ancestral land as a member of the Al Bu Said royal family, but not as a titular sultan, after Jamshid had lived more than fifty years in the United Kingdom.

Jamshid died in Muscat on 30 December 2024, at the age of 95. He was buried in the Royal Cemetery in Muscat.

==Honours==

===National===
* Sovereign of the Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar (Wisam al-Kawkab al-Durri al-Zanzibari) since 1 July 1963 (1st class on 30 March 1960).

* Founder and Sovereign of the Most Illustrious Order of Independence of Zanzibar (Wissam al-Istiqlal) in five classes on 9 November 1963.

===Foreign===
*Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) on 29 December 1963.

* Knight Grand Collar of the Royal Order of the Drum (Rwanda).

<text>Binary delta compression is a technology used in software deployment for distributing patches.

== Explanation ==
Downloading large amounts of data over the Internet for software updates can induce high network traffic problems, especially when a network of computers is involved. &quot;Binary Delta Compression&quot; technology allows a major reduction of download size by only transferring the difference between the old and the new files during the update process.

== Implementation ==
In real-world implementations, it is common to also use standard compression techniques (such as Lempel-Ziv) while compressing. This makes sense because LZW already works by referring back to re-used strings. ZDelta is a good example of this, as it is built from ZLib. The algorithm works by referring to common patterns not only in the file to be compressed, but also in a source file. The benefits of this are that even if there are few similarities between the original and the new file, a good data compression ratio is attained.

<text>Jay Thomas Kelly (born August 15, 1950) is an American former professional baseball player, coach and manager. As the manager of the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball over 16 seasons from mid-September through , he won two World Series championships. Currently, he serves as a special assistant to the general manager for the Twins.

Kelly was born in Graceville, Minnesota, and grew up in Sayreville, New Jersey, attending St. Mary&#x27;s High School in nearby South Amboy.

==Playing career==
A first baseman and outfielder, Kelly threw and batted left-handed and was listed as tall and . He was drafted by the Seattle Pilots in the eighth round of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft. After three years in the Pilots/Milwaukee Brewers organization, he was given his unconditional release on April 6, 1971.

On April 28, 1971, Kelly was signed as a minor league free agent by the Twins and sent to the Double-A Charlotte Hornets in the Southern League. From 1972 through 1975, Kelly would spend most of his playing time with the Triple-A Tacoma Twins of the Pacific Coast League, splitting time between first base and the corner outfield positions.

After starting the season again in Tacoma, Kelly was called up to the parent Twins and made his major league debut on May 11, 1975. Kelly would play in 49 games with the Twins over the 1975 season, getting into 43 games at first base and two in the outfield. In 147 plate appearances, he collected 15 bases on balls and 23 hits, with five doubles and one home run (a solo blast off Vern Ruhle at Tiger Stadium on 26 May), hitting a poor .181 with 11 runs batted in. Prior to the start of the season, Kelly was purchased by the Baltimore Orioles and assigned to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings; he would not return to the major leagues as an active player. In 1977, he returned to the Twins organization and Tacoma – spending part of the year as a player-manager. In 1978, Kelly appeared in 119 games for the Twins new Triple-A affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens. It was his last year as a full-time player.

==Managerial career==
Following the 1978 season, Kelly was sent down to manage the Twins&#x27; Class A affiliate, the Visalia Oaks in the California League, staying there through the 1980 season. He then spent 1981 and 1982 as skipper of the Double-A Orlando Twins, winning the 1981 Southern League championship.

In , Kelly was appointed third-base coach on Minnesota manager Billy Gardner&#x27;s big-league coaching staff. He retained the post when Ray Miller became skipper, and succeeded Miller as manager on September 12, 1986. Kelly was the 11th pilot of the Twins since they moved to Minneapolis–Saint Paul from Washington in 1961, and his 15-plus-year-stint as manager is the longest consecutive-season managerial term in the team&#x27;s history, which began with the founding of the American League in . During his tenure, the Twins won two World Series crowns in the span of five years (1987 and 1991); however, from to a long sequence of retirements and injuries (including superstars Kent Hrbek and Kirby Puckett) hurt the team badly, and Kelly spent the remainder of his managerial career rebuilding the Twins.

===1987 World Series===
A year after taking over the reins of the Twins from Miller, Kelly took the team that he had helped build through his role as one of the top people in the Twins&#x27; minor league organization and led it to a World Series championship. Though the &#x27;87 Twins were criticized for being the top team in a weak division (amassing only a .525 record in regular season play, which was the worst winning percentage for an eventual World Champion until surpassed by the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006), they easily handled the Detroit Tigers in five games, losing only Game 3 of the American League Championship Series to a heartbreaking 8th-inning two-run home run.

The World Series was a well-fought contest between the Twins and the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals, each team winning all of its home games. Games 1, 2, 4 and 6 were decidedly lopsided contests (10–1 Twins, 8–4 Twins, 7–2 Cards, 11–5 Twins), with Games 3, 5 and 7 being much closer contests, each being decided by only two runs (3–1 Cards, 4–2 Cards and 4–2 Twins).

After a 63-year drought, Tom Kelly&#x27;s leadership helped propel the Twins to their second World Championship, and first since their 1961 relocation to Minneapolis.

===1991 World Series===
After finishing the 1990 season in last place with a 74-88 record, the Twins dominated the AL West in 1991, finishing 8 games ahead of the second-place Chicago White Sox with a 95–67 record. During this season, the Twins set the club record of 15 consecutive wins, but this winning streak propelled them into first place. In the AL Championship, the Twins easily beat the Toronto Blue Jays in 5 games, winning the right to face the Atlanta Braves in the World Series. Marked by a series of close contests filled with dramatic plays and extra-innings, the 1991 World Series was later ranked by ESPN as the greatest World Series ever.

Following two closely contested victories at home, the Twins traveled to Atlanta where they suffered three straight defeats. Tom Kelly, prior to the Series&#x27; move to Atlanta, infamously said that managing without the designated hitter was &quot;right up there with rocket science&quot;. Although he was being facetious, the grueling Game 3 proved Kelly prescient as a series of double switches and substitutions emptied the Twins&#x27; bench and both teams&#x27; bullpens. Kelly was forced to pinch hit Rick Aguilera in the top of the 12th and was prepared to send outfielder Dan Gladden to the mound if necessary; however, the Braves won in the bottom of the 12th when David Justice narrowly beat a throw to the plate. After a similarly close Game 4 and a dominating 14–5 Braves victory in Game 5, the Twins had to win the final two games at home.

Game 6 featured two climactic plays by Kirby Puckett who, in the top of the 3rd, made a sensational leaping catch against the center field acrylic glass to prevent a Braves&#x27; run. The Twins won 4–3 in the bottom of the 11th when Puckett blasted a home run off Charlie Leibrandt. Game 7 proved to be one of the greatest games in baseball history, as the game was scoreless for 9 innings and included a number of decisive and memorable plays. Kelly planned to take Twins starter Jack Morris out after the ninth inning ended. Morris argued repeatedly with Kelly to allow him to stay in the game. Kelly finally gave in. &quot;What the hell,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;It&#x27;s only a ballgame.&quot; Morris ended up pitching 10 scoreless innings as the Twins won 1–0 in the bottom of the 10th, giving Minnesota its second World Series victory in five years.

===Final years===

In , management cleared all players earning over $1 million (except for pitcher Brad Radke) and rebuilt from the ground up; the team went 70–92 and in fourth place in the AL Central, 19 games behind the Cleveland Indians and five games ahead of the Detroit Tigers. On May 7, 2000, he won his 1,000th game as manager (having managed 2,092 games), doing so with a 4-0 victory over the Detroit Tigers at the Metrodome to become the 46th manager of the 1,000 wins club.

A run of eight straight losing seasons ended in 2001, when the Twins led the division for much of the year before fading, finishing at 85–77, second to Cleveland. He then resigned at age 51, citing burnout, and the threat of contraction. Kelly was succeeded as manager of the Twins by Ron Gardenhire, and his rebuilding efforts paid off the year after he retired from the Twins, with a repeat of divisional championships in 2002, 2003, and 2004.

The Twins retired Kelly&#x27;s jersey number, #10, on September 8, 2012.

A bronze statue of Kelly was unveiled outside Target Field on July 21, 2017.

<text>The Ford Vulcan is a 3.0 L V6 engine designed and built by the Ford Motor Company. It debuted in 1986 in the newly launched Ford Taurus. Ford went on to install the Vulcan V6 in a variety of car, van, and pickup truck models until the 2008 model year, after which production stopped. 

==History==
The Vulcan V6 engine was developed as part of Ford&#x27;s plan to produce a successor to their mid-size LTD and Marquis sedans and wagons. The project was led by vice president and head of product planning and research Lewis Veraldi. Originally called Sigma, the project was renamed DN5 and resulted in the 1986 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable.

A straight-four engine was specified early on, possibly from a supplier outside of Ford, with no provision for a V8 and no expectation that a V6 would be needed. As work progressed, the future car&#x27;s size and weight increased to the point where a V6 of 2.8 L was added to the powertrain options. Neither of Ford&#x27;s existing V6 engines were appropriate for this use; their 3.8 L Essex V6 was too wide and produced excessive vibration, while their 2.8 L Cologne V6 was too large and heavy. Two years into the project, Thomas Howard was chosen to head up internal engine development.

Performance goals were set for both the car and its engine. The car was to be able to accelerate from in a maximum time of 11.5 seconds. The engine was to develop no less than , travel before requiring an oil change, go before requiring major maintenance, run for five minutes after a major cooling system failure, and offer a &quot;limp home&quot; mode. Market studies indicated that American buyers were more interested in having a reliable, low maintenance engine than in owning a sophisticated engine for its own sake.

The resulting engine was a clean-sheet, all metric design. The engine&#x27;s 60° vee angle was chosen to help it fit into the Taurus&#x27; engine bay. Displacement grew from an original 2.8 L to 3.0 L. A variety of technologies were evaluated during development, including two different fuel injection systems, turbocharging, two sparkplugs per cylinder, variable displacement with cylinder deactivation, and Ford&#x27;s experimental programmed combustion (PROCO) system.

Ford&#x27;s parts and service division asked that the oil filter, sparkplugs, oil dipstick be up front and accessible, and that key underhood touchpoints be colored yellow for easy identification. The appearance of the engine was also important. The intake, for instance, was engineered with aesthetics in mind, though the design had the side effect of allowing it to flow more air.

The engine block was cast at Ford&#x27;s Cleveland Casting Plant with tooling built by Sherwood Metal Products, while the intake came from Ford&#x27;s Essex Aluminum Casting. Engine assembly took place at Ford&#x27;s Lima engine plant in Lima, Ohio.

In the spring of 1982 the first forty prototype engines blocks were cast, all of which cracked when they were assembled. In their efforts to produce a lightweight block, Ford&#x27;s engineers had designed a very rigid structure whose walls had been made very thin, which caused the cracking.

Some early engines were installed in front wheel drive Chevrolet Celebritys. Later test engines were installed in a group of Ford LTDs and Mercury Marquis. These were driven approximately , roughly twice the usual test distance, and evaluated in both hot and cold environments. Another set of about thirty prototype engines were installed in a fleet of trucks that logged between , after which the engines were torn down and inspected, deficiencies noted and parts redesigned, after which the engines were remanufactured and returned to service for a second phase of testing.

The Vulcan was the only engine available in the Taurus when it launched; Ford introduced the HSC inline four as the base engine on certain models late in the Taurus&#x27; first year and later offered a model with a 5-speed manual transmission. By the end of its first year of sales, the Taurus was offered in four trim levels: L, MT-5, GL, LX. The standard engine in the L and GL sedans and the only engine offered in the MT-5 sedan and wagon was the HSC four cylinder. The Vulcan was optional in the L and GL sedans, and standard in the L and GL wagons and all LX models. While the HSC engine could be paired with either the 3-speed Ford ATX transmission in the L, or the 5-speed MTX-III manual transmission in the MT-5, the only transmission available for Vulcan equipped models was the newly developed 4-speed AXOD automatic.

In 1992 the 2.5 L HSC four cylinder was dropped from the Taurus line, and the Vulcan became the car&#x27;s base engine, and later the only engine offered in the 2006–2007 model years. It was also used in the Ford Probe, the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz from 1992 to 1994 (optional, but standard in the 1992 GLS, XR5, and LTS models, respectively), the Ford Aerostar and Ford Windstar minivans, and the Ford Ranger and Mazda B3000 pickup trucks. The 3.0 L Vulcan replaced Ford&#x27;s 2.9 L German Cologne V6 as the base V6 in the Ranger. The last production vehicle available with the Vulcan V6 was the 2008 Ford Ranger.

Although it shared the Vulcan V6&#x27;s general layout, 60° cylinder bank angle, bore, stroke, bore spacing, and a few minor components, the SHO V6 was an engine designed and built by Yamaha with new DOHC cylinder heads and a redesigned, strengthened engine block.

Applications:
* 1986–1997 Ford Aerostar
* 1986–2007 Ford Taurus
* 1986–2005 Mercury Sable
* 1990–1992 Ford Probe
* 1991–2008 Ford Ranger
* 1992–1994 Ford Tempo
* 1992–1994 Mercury Topaz
* 1994–2007 Mazda B3000
* 1995–2000 Ford Windstar

==Features==
The Vulcan&#x27;s block and cylinder heads are of cast iron, with a 60° angle between cylinder banks. It has a single cam-in-block and two overhead valves per cylinder operated by pushrods and rocker arms. Bore and stroke measurements are , for a total displacement of . When it debuted in the 1986 Taurus, the Vulcan developed at 4800 rpm, 10 horsepower more than the design specification, and of torque at 3000 rpm. Power output was as high as at 4900 rpm in the 2007 Taurus, and as low as at 4800 rpm in the 1992 Tempo.

Designed from the start to use electronic fuel injection, no Vulcans left the factory fitted with a carburetor. The engine is managed by Ford&#x27;s EEC-IV engine control unit (ECU).

The Vulcan was also available in a &quot;flexible fuel&quot; (flex fuel) configuration that could burn normal gasoline, the E85 blend of 15% gasoline and 85% ethanol, or any mix of the two.

Over the course of its production life the engine received many internal upgrades, including roller lifters (1992), a five counterweight crankshaft (1995), a reinforced block (1995, 2002), and longer head bolts (1999) among other changes. In 1993 the flex fuel Vulcan received Ford&#x27;s coil pack based Electronic Distributorless Ignition System (EDIS), which the gasoline fueled version received in 1996.

<text>Boulton &amp; Paul Ltd was a British general manufacturer from Norwich, England that became involved in aircraft manufacture.

Jeld Wen Inc. bought Boulton &amp; Paul (along with another joinery company John Carr) from the Rugby Group plc in 1999 to form its British subsidiary.

== History ==

The company&#x27;s origins date back to an ironmonger&#x27;s shop founded in 1797 in Norwich by William Moore. William Staples Boulton joined the ironworks firm of Moore &amp; Barnard in 1844. By 1870 Boulton had been elevated to a partner alongside of John Barnard and the firm was renamed to Barnard &amp; Boulton. A later partner in the firm was Joseph Paul, and the firm was again renamed to Boulton &amp; Paul Ltd, which started its construction engineering division in 1905. By the early 1900s, Boulton &amp; Paul Ltd had become a successful general manufacturing firm.

During the Second World War it was a major producer of prefabricated buildings, wire netting and wooden sub-assemblies of aircraft. In 1942 the Midland Woodworking Company of Melton Mowbray became a subsidiary. Richard Jewson of the Jewson timber merchants and former Lord Mayor of Norwich was a member of the board until retiring in 1947.

=== Corrugated iron buildings ===
In the 1880s Boulton &amp; Paul were leading manufacturers of kits for corrugated iron buildings, which arrived in packing crates ready to be erected. Woodhall Spa Cottage Museum is a well-preserved example of a Boulton &amp; Paul corrugated building as is the conservatory at Carrow House in Norwich, the former management building at the Colman&#x27;s mustard works. Monkton Combe School&#x27;s first cricket pavilion was erected by Boulton &amp; Paul in 1884 and a cost of £50. It was demolished in 1970.

===Other building types===
Boulton &amp; Paul was one of the first manufacturers of prefabricated &quot;Residences, Bungalows and Cottages&quot;, which they sent to destinations all over the British Empire and South America. Its 1920 catalogue contained a choice of twenty-two designs with several varieties of bungalow illustrated, ranging from the &#x27;Modern Residential&#x27;, through the &#x27;Week-End&#x27; and the &#x27;Seaside&#x27; to the plain and ordinary (with verandah).

Many of its buildings are still in use, and include Castle Bungalow at Peppercombe, Devon (a former boathouse which is now a holiday cottage owned by the Landmark Trust) and Monkton Combe School&#x27;s thatched sports pavilion on Longmead, often referred to as one of the most beautiful cricket pitches in England, which is visible from the A36 in Somerset.

=== Aircraft manufacture ===

In 1915, Boulton &amp; Paul began to construct aircraft under contract including 550 of the Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2b. Fe.2 construction was passed over to another East Anglian company so Boulton Paul could concentrate on production of more advanced designs. Their extensive use of jigs and the manufacture of the smaller fittings required meant that they could maintain fast production. A new production site was built and an assembly and proving ground developed on Mousehold Heath in Norwich rather than transport the aircraft to the Army at Thetford. During the war the company built more Sopwith Camels than any other manufacturer. Success as a builder of aircraft led to the company forming a design department but none of its resulting aircraft made a significant impact while the war lasted. The P.3 Bobolink fighter was overshadowed by the Sopwith Snipe and the Armistice came before the P.7 Bourges bomber into production.

Boulton &amp; Paul developed steel-framed aircraft under their designer John Dudley North. The first was the Boulton &amp; Paul P.10 which used steel tubes rolled from sheet metal. It was exhibited – but not flown – at the Paris Air Show in 1919. Official interest in metal frame designs led to an order of a single Boulton &amp; Paul Bolton, a twin-engine bomber design. In the same period Boulton &amp; Paul produced another metal framed design, the Boulton &amp; Paul Bodmin, with its engines in the fuselage. North believed that a metal frame could be 10% lighter than an equivalent wooden frame.

After World War I, Boulton &amp; Paul made its mark with the introduction of powered and enclosed defensive machine-gun turrets for bombers. Its Sidestrand twin-engined biplane bomber, which could fly at 140 mph, had an exposed nose turret that was clearly inadequate. The subsequent Overstrand bomber featured the world&#x27;s first enclosed, power-operated turret, mounting a single Lewis gun and propelled by compressed air. The company licensed a French design of an electro-hydraulic four-gun turret that became a major feature of its future production. In addition to fitting turrets to bombers, Boulton &amp; Paul was to install them in fighters.

Boulton &amp; Paul provided most of the structure for the R101 airship; the completed sections being transported to RAF Cardington for assembly there. The R101 subsequently flew over Norwich in return.

In a depressed market in 1934, the aircraft division being its weakest, Boulton &amp; Paul Ltd sold its aircraft manufacturing component from the main construction business to create Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd. This moved to Wolverhampton in 1936 as the area had a surplus of skilled labour and the council was able to provide an incentive in the form of a greenfield site and flying rights. In 1961 Boulton Paul Aircraft, by now a producer of aircraft equipment rather than complete aircraft, merged with the Dowty Group to form first Dowty Boulton Paul Ltd and then Dowty Aerospace.

<doc id="959247" wikidata="Q2273567" url="?curid=959247" title="Halfrek">
<text>Halfrek or Hallie is a recurring fictional character on the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot; She appears as a vengeance demon in seasons 6 and 7, and has previously appeared as Cecily in season 5. She is played by actress Kali Rocha.

==Halfrek==
Halfrek is a long-time associate and sometime friend of Anya, who knew her from her days as a vengeance demon. The two had worked together in the past, notably during the Russian Revolution of 1905. However, Halfrek&#x27;s &quot;raison d&#x27;etre&quot; differed from Anya&#x27;s. Whereas Anya was an avenger of scorned women, Halfrek&#x27;s &quot;thing&quot; (as Anya put it) is to perform vengeance for children who have been wronged by their parents or guardians. Anya attributes this to &quot;daddy issues&quot;. Even after Anya ceases to be a vengeance demon, she continues her friendship with Halfrek. Like Anyanka used the name Anya when masquerading as human, Halfrek&#x27;s mortal persona goes by the name Hallie.

In her second appearance in season 6, Halfrek poses as a guidance counselor and coaxes Dawn into making a wish. Feeling that no one wants to spend time with her, Dawn wishes that people would never leave; Halfrek therefore casts a spell that prevents anyone from leaving the Summers residence. The crisis ends when Halfrek herself is caught in the spell and has to break it. Halfrek also appears as a bridesmaid at the failed wedding of Anya and Xander. Early in season 7, Halfrek attempts to coax Anya back into vengeance, but Anya has spent too long as a mortal to return to her old life; while she was initially successful in her return to demonhood, she subsequently regrets the deaths she has caused. D&#x27;Hoffryn asks Anya what she wants, and she says that she wants to reverse the vengeance she had done. D&#x27;Hoffryn grants her wish, telling her that it&#x27;ll require the sacrifice of a vengeance demon&#x27;s body and soul. Believing she is about to die, Anya is resigned to her fate—only to watch helplessly as D&#x27;Hoffryn summons her friend Halfrek and incinerates her in front of Anya.

==Cecily==
In the season 5 episode &quot;Fool For Love&quot;, Halfrek uses the persona of Cecily while on a job to kill all the guests at a party Spike is attending. Cecily, being the upper-class object of the then-human William&#x27;s affections in Victorian England circa 1880 spurns William&#x27;s advances, saying he is &quot;beneath her&quot;, and upsetting him greatly. This sets in motion the events that lead William to accept comfort from Drusilla, and become a vampire. (Cecily&#x27;s surname was implied to be &quot;Underwood&quot; in the episode &quot;Lies My Parents Told Me&quot;, but stated to be &quot;Addams&quot; in the script and credits of &quot;Fool for Love&quot; and the non-canon tie-in novel &quot;These Our Actors&quot;.)

==Identity==
In the season 6 episode &quot;Older and Far Away&quot;, Halfrek recognizes Spike and calls him by his human name, William. Spike also recognizes Halfrek, but when asked to explain this they both sheepishly deny being acquainted. This implies that Halfrek had previously been Cecily. However, Halfrek and Anya witnessed the Crimean War (circa 1853) which is mentioned in &quot;Lessons&quot; and shown in &quot;Selfless&quot;. The timing of this event would indicate that Halfrek existed as a demon at least three decades prior to the adoption of the youthful human form in Cecily. Joss Whedon and Kali Rocha have both stated that, in their minds at least, Halfrek and Cecily were indeed the same entity.

Halfrek later appeared in the comic &quot;&quot;, which established that she was &#x27;on a job&#x27; at the time that William fell for Cecily. She seems to have had at least some pity for William in spite of her rejection of him, as the night he became a vampire, she caused the deaths of the rude party-goers who had laughed at his poetry.

Continuity-wise, the comic story takes place in &quot;Buffy&quot; season 6, and assumes that Spike briefly left Sunnydale and visited Los Angeles.

==Appearances==
;&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; : Halfrek/Cecily has appeared in 7 Buffy episodes as a guest.
*Season 5: &quot;Fool for Love&quot; (as Cecily)

<doc id="959259" wikidata="Q496085" url="?curid=959259" title="Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>Robin Wood is a recurring character on the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The character, present for most of the seventh and final season, is played by D. B. Woodside.

==Biography==
In season 7 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Robin is the first (and only) principal of the newly rebuilt Sunnydale High School when Buffy&#x27;s sister Dawn Summers begins her year. At first, Buffy wonders if he may be evil, but nevertheless accepts a job offer from him. For much of the season, hints are dropped that Robin is aware of the mystical situation in Sunnydale — he finds and buries Jonathan Levinson&#x27;s body, for example — but the viewer is left without any indication as to which side he fights for.

The character is portrayed as having a good sense of humor and communicating well with students. He is a vegetarian and claims to have once been suspended for threatening to attack another student who bullied him during high school. Robin&#x27;s easygoing attitude and confidence are presented in sharp contrast to the previous high school principal characters depicted as nervous (Principal Flutie) and excessively disciplinarian (Principal Snyder), making him a well-liked educator among the students, alumns, and faculty members.

However, in the episode &quot;Him&quot;, a troubled student, RJ Brooks, develops a resentment towards Robin, leading to an attempt on Robin&#x27;s life by Buffy (who was under RJ&#x27;s family&#x27;s love spell at the time); she attempts to kill Robin with her rocket launcher, though he is saved by Xander, Willow and Spike.

In the episode &quot;First Date&quot;, it is revealed that Robin&#x27;s mother, Nikki Wood (who was first seen in the episode &quot;Fool for Love&quot;), had been a Slayer in New York City, and that he is a &quot;freelance&quot; demon fighter. On a date with Buffy, Robin explains that his mother was killed by a vampire; he later learns, from the First Evil, that this vampire is Spike. He was raised and trained by Nikki&#x27;s Watcher, not in New York but in Beverly Hills (according to the episode &quot;Help&quot;).

As retribution for his mother&#x27;s murder, Robin conspires with Giles to distract Buffy and kill Spike. However, the plan fails and Buffy realizes what has gone on, temporarily alienating Robin from the group. After Faith&#x27;s return, Robin returns to the fold and becomes interested in Faith; the two become physically intimate in the episode &quot;Touched&quot;. Prior to the final battle in the episode &quot;Chosen&quot;, Robin expresses concern that Faith views men as mere sex objects, and pledges to surprise her if they survive.

===Post-Sunnydale===
Robin appears in &quot;No Future for You&quot;, the second arc of the canonical comic book series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot;. Like Andrew, Robin is in charge of a squad of slayers, and is shown to be working at the Hellmouth in Cleveland. In his one-panel appearance he calls Faith to tell her of a family that was recently attacked by vamps. Faith refers to him as &quot;the ex&quot; implying the couple has ended their relationship since &quot;Chosen&quot;.

===Powers===
Robin did not inherit any powers from his mother. He was, however, trained in the martial arts and various vampire killing tactics by his mother&#x27;s former Watcher.

==Appearances==
===Canonical appearances===
Robin appeared in 14 canon Buffyverse episodes

<text>A perpetual stew, also known as forever soup, hunter&#x27;s pot, or hunter&#x27;s stew, is a pot into which foodstuffs are placed and cooked, continuously. The pot is never or rarely emptied all the way, and ingredients and liquid are replenished as necessary. Such foods can continue cooking for decades or longer if properly maintained. The concept is often a common element in descriptions of medieval inns. Foods prepared in a perpetual stew have been described as being flavorful due to the manner in which the ingredients blend together.
Various ingredients can be used in a perpetual stew such as root vegetables, tubers (potatoes, yams, etc.), and various meats.

==Historical examples==
Perpetual stews are speculated to have been common in medieval cuisine, often as pottage or pot-au-feu:

A batch of pot-au-feu was claimed by one writer to be maintained as a perpetual stew in Perpignan from the 15th century until World War II, when it ran out of ingredients to keep the stew going due to the German occupation.

==Modern examples==

The tradition of perpetual stew remains prevalent in South and East Asian countries. Notable examples include beef and goat noodle soup served by Wattana Panich in Bangkok, Thailand, which has been cooking for over years , and oden broth from Otafuku in Asakusa, Japan, which has served the same broth daily since 1945.

Between August 2014 and April 2015, a New York restaurant served a master stock in the style of a perpetual stew for over eight months.

In July 2023, a &quot;Perpetual Stew Club&quot; organized by social media personality Annie Rauwerda gained headlines for holding weekly gatherings in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to consume perpetual stew. Hundreds attended the event and brought their own ingredients to contribute to the stew. The stew lasted for 60 days.

<doc id="959267" wikidata="Q330179" url="?curid=959267" title="Abraham Kovoor">
<text>Abraham Thomas Kovoor (10 April 1898 – 18 September 1978) was an Indian professor and rationalist who gained prominence after retirement for his campaign to expose as frauds various Indian and Sri Lankan &quot;god-men&quot; and so-called paranormal phenomena. His direct, trenchant criticism of spiritual frauds and organized religions was enthusiastically received by audiences, initiating a new dynamism in the Rationalist movement, especially in Sri Lanka and India.

==Early life and career==
Abraham Kovoor was born into the aristocratic Kovoor family of Syrian Christians at Thiruvalla, Kerala. Kovoor was the son of Rev. Iype Thoma Kathanar (Kovoor Achen), Vicar General of the Mar Thoma Syrian Church of Malabar. After working briefly as a lecturer in botany at C.M.S.College in Kerala, Kovoor arrived in Ceylon in February 1928. Abraham&#x27;s younger brother, Behanan was a renowned sociologist and psychologist. Before his arrival in Ceylon, Kovoor married Kunjamma, daughter of a judge. The couple had a son, Aries. Kovoor&#x27;s first assignment in Ceylon was teaching botany at Jaffna College, Vaddukoddai for 15 years until 1943. Subsequently, he also taught at Richmond College, Galle, and St. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia from 1947 to 1953, before retiring in 1959 as a teacher at Thurstan College, Colombo. He also practiced hypnotherapy and applied psychology.

==As a rationalist==

After retirement Kovoor devoted his life to the rationalist movement. He spent most of his time building up the Ceylon Rationalist Association, and was its president from 1960 to his death. He edited an annual journal, &quot;The Ceylon Rationalist Ambassador&quot;. Kovoor became a widower when his wife Konjamma died in 1976. In his will, he wrote as follows: &quot;My body should not be buried on my death. The body of my wife also should not be buried. We have dedicated our bodies to the use of medical colleges on our death. I desire that my skeleton should be surrendered to Thurston College, Colombo, which I served for many years. I entrust this task to my son, Aries Kovoor, who is a professor at the Sorbonne University, Paris. My eyes should be donated to an eye bank immediately after death.&quot; Kovoor died on 18 September 1978 due to cancer. His skeleton is preserved inside one of the science labs in Thurstan College, Colombo.

==Publications and Kovoor&#x27;s challenge==
After his numerous encounters with god-men, astrologers, and other people who claimed to have psychic powers, Kovoor concluded that there was no objective truth to such claims. He wrote, &quot;Nobody has and nobody ever had supernatural powers. They exist only in the pages of scriptures and sensation-mongering newspapers.&quot; His books &quot;Begone Godmen&quot; and &quot;Gods, Demons and Spirits&quot;, about his encounters with people claiming psychic powers, are still bestsellers in India.

In 1963, Kovoor announced an award of Rs. 100,000 for anyone who could demonstrate supernatural or miraculous powers under foolproof and fraud-proof conditions. The challenge listed 23 miracles or feats that godmen (and Western mystics and performers such as Uri Geller and Jeane Dixon) claimed to perform, such as reading the serial numbers from currency in sealed envelopes, materializing objects, predicting future events, converting liquids from one kind to another, and walking on water. Some sought publicity by taking on his challenge, but they forfeited the initial deposit amount. The Sri Lankan Rationalist Association, led by Professor Carlo Fonseka, renewed the challenge in 2012 and increased the reward to one million dollars. (Similar challenges have been posed by Basava Premanand and James Randi.)

==Legacy==
The Malayalam movie &quot;Punarjanmam&quot; (1972), Tamil movie &quot;Maru Piravi&quot; (1973) and Telugu film &quot;Ninthakatha&quot; were made on the basis of his case diary. Aamir Khan&#x27;s character in &quot;PK&quot; (2014) is inspired by Kovoor. Bharathiya Yuktivadi Sangam declared a national award called the A. T. Kovoor Award for the Secular Artist. The first recipient was Indian film star Kamal Haasan in acknowledgment of his humanist activities and secular life.

Kovoor&#x27;s work remains controversial in India. In 2008, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, leader of Shiromani Akali Dal, imposed an &quot;immediate ban&quot; on Kovoor&#x27;s &quot;God, Demons and Spirits&quot;, translated into Punjabi by Megh Raj Mitter. Popular rationalist Basava Premanand, founder of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations, was heavily influenced by Kovoor.

<doc id="959272" wikidata="Q7551081" url="?curid=959272" title="Social effects of rock music">
<text>The popularity and worldwide scope of rock music resulted in a powerful impact on society in the 20th century, particularly among the baby boomer generation. Rock and roll influenced daily life, fashion, social attitudes, and language in a way few other social developments have equated to. As the original generation of rock and roll fans matured, the music became an accepted and deeply interwoven thread in popular culture. Beginning in the early 1950s, rock songs began to be used in a few television commercials; within a decade, this practice became widespread, and rock music also featured in film and television program soundtracks. By the 1980s, rock music culture had become the dominant form of popular music culture in the United States and other Western countries, before seeing a decline in subsequent years.

== Race ==

In the crossover of African American &quot;race music&quot; to a growing white youth audience, the popularization of rock and roll involved both black performers reaching a white audience and white performers appropriating African-American music.
Rock and roll appeared at a time when racial tensions in the United States were entering a new phase, with the beginnings of the civil rights movement for desegregation, leading to the Supreme Court ruling that abolished the policy of &quot;separate but equal&quot; in 1954, but leaving a policy which would be extremely difficult to enforce in parts of the United States. 

The coming together of white youth audiences and black music in rock and roll, inevitably provoked strong white racist reactions within the US, with many whites condemning its breaking down of barriers based on color. Many observers saw rock and roll as heralding the way for desegregation, in creating a new form of music that encouraged racial cooperation and shared experience. Many authors have argued that early rock and roll was instrumental in the way both white and black teenagers identified themselves.

==Sex and drugs==
The rock and roll lifestyle was popularly associated with sex and drugs. Many of rock and roll&#x27;s early stars (as well as their jazz and blues counterparts) were known as hard-drinking, hard-living characters. During the 1960s the lifestyles of many stars became more publicly known, aided by the growth of the underground rock press. Musicians had always attracted attention of &quot;groupies&quot; (girls who followed musicians) who spent time with and often performed sexual favors for band members.

As the stars&#x27; lifestyles became more public, the popularity and promotion of recreational drug use by musicians may have influenced use of drugs and the perception of acceptability of drug use among the youth of the period. For example, when in the late 1960s the Beatles, who had previously been marketed as clean-cut youths, started publicly acknowledging using LSD, many fans followed. Journalist Al Aronowitz wrote &quot;...whatever the Beatles did was acceptable, especially for young people.&quot; Jerry Garcia, of the rock band Grateful Dead said, &quot;For some people, taking LSD and going to Grateful Dead show functions like a rite of passage ... we don&#x27;t have a product to sell; but we do have a mechanism that works.&quot; 

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, much of the rock and roll cachet associated with drug use dissipated as rock music suffered a series of drug-related deaths, including the 27 Club-member deaths of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison. Although some amount of drug use remained common among rock musicians, a greater respect for the dangers of drug consumption was observed, and many anti-drug songs became part of the rock lexicon, notably &quot;The Needle and the Damage Done&quot; by Neil Young (1972).

Many rock musicians, including John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, Stevie Nicks, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards, Bon Scott, Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend, Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson, Steven Tyler, Scott Weiland, Sly Stone, Ozzy Osbourne, Mötley Crüe, Layne Staley, Kurt Cobain, Lemmy, Bobby Brown, Buffy Sainte Marie, Dave Matthews, David Crosby, Anthony Kiedis, Dave Mustaine, David Bowie, Richard Wright, Phil Rudd, Phil Anselmo, James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Joe Walsh, Julian Casablancas and others, have acknowledged battling addictions to many substances including alcohol, cocaine and heroin; many of these have successfully undergone drug rehabilitation programs, but others have died.

In the early 1980s. along with the rise of the band Minor Threat, a straight edge lifestyle became popular. The straight edge philosophy of abstinence from recreational drugs, alcohol, tobacco and sex became associated with some hardcore punks through the years, and both remain popular with youth today. 

==Fashion==

Rock music and fashion have been inextricably linked. In the mid-1960s of the UK, rivalry arose between &quot;Mods&quot; (who favoured &#x27;modern&#x27; Italian-led fashion) and &quot;Rockers&quot; (who wore motorcycle leathers), each style had their own favored musical acts. (The controversy would form the backdrop for The Who&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;). In the 1960s, The Beatles brought mop-top haircuts, collarless blazers, and Beatle Boots into fashion.

Rock musicians were also early adopters of hippie fashion and popularised such styles as long hair and the Nehru jacket. As rock music genres became more segmented, what an artist wore became as important as the music itself in defining the artist&#x27;s intent and relationship to the audience. In the early 1970s, glam rock became widely influential featuring glittery fashions, high heels and camp. In the late 1970s, disco acts helped bring flashy urban styles to the mainstream, while punk groups began wearing mock-conservative attire, (including suit jackets and skinny ties), in an attempt to be as unlike mainstream rock musicians, who still favored blue jeans and hippie-influenced clothes.

Heavy Metal bands in the 1980s often favoured a strong visual image. For some bands, this consisted of leather or denim jackets and pants, spike/studs and long hair. Visual image was a strong component of the glam metal movement.

In 1981, MTV was formed, marking a large shift in the music world. Because MTV would become such a cultural force, the young would look toward MTV. Fashion happened to be one of those cultural centers that the Television company would have a great effect on. With debuts like Madonna&#x27;s Iconic underwear-as-outerwear look and the companies featuring heavy metal as well as new wave and other genera that would go to promote each artist&#x27;s brand of fashion into the greater culture, because of the sheer amount of visibility that MTV gave these artist through music videos and other content that the television channel had.

In the early 1990s, the popularity of grunge brought in a punk influenced fashion of its own, including torn jeans, old shoes, flannel shirts, backward baseball hats, and people grew their hair against the clean-cut image that was popular at the time in heavily commercialized pop music culture.

Musicians continue to be fashion icons; pop-culture magazines such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; often include fashion layouts featuring musicians as models.

==Authenticity==

Rock musicians and fans have consistently struggled with the paradox of &quot;selling out&quot;—to be considered &quot;authentic&quot;, rock music must keep a certain distance from the commercial world and its constructs; however it is widely believed that certain compromises must be made to become successful and to make music available to the public. This dilemma has created friction between musicians and fans, with some bands going to great lengths to avoid the appearance of &quot;selling out&quot; (while still finding ways to make a lucrative living). In some styles of rock, such as punk and heavy metal, a performer who is believed to have &quot;sold out&quot; to commercial interests may be labelled with the pejorative term &quot;poseur&quot;.

If a performer first comes to public attention with one style, any further stylistic development may be seen as selling out to long-time fans. On the other hand, managers and producers may progressively take more control of the artist, as happened, for instance, in Elvis Presley&#x27;s swift transition in species from &quot;The Hillbilly Cat&quot; to &quot;your teddy bear&quot;. It can be difficult to define the difference between seeking a wider audience and selling out. Ray Charles left behind his classic formulation of rhythm and blues to sing country music, pop songs and soft-drink commercials. In the process, he went from a niche audience to worldwide fame. Bob Dylan faced consternation from fans for embracing the electric guitar. In the end, it is a moral judgement made by the artist, the management, and the audience.

==Social activism==
Love and peace were very common themes in rock music during the 1960s and 1970s. Rock musicians have often attempted to address social issues directly as commentary or as calls to action. During the Vietnam War the first rock protest songs were heard, inspired by the songs of folk musicians such as Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan, which ranged from abstract evocations of peace Peter, Paul and Mary&#x27;s &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot; to blunt anti-establishment diatribes Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young&#x27;s &quot;Ohio&quot;. Other musicians, notably John Lennon and Yoko Ono, were vocal in their anti-war sentiment both in their music and in public statements with songs such as &quot;Imagine&quot;, and &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;.

Famous rock musicians have adopted causes ranging from the environment (Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot;) and the Anti-Apartheid Movement (Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Biko&quot;), to violence in Northern Ireland (U2&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;) and worldwide economic policy (the Dead Kennedys&#x27; &quot;Kill the Poor&quot;). Another notable protest song is Patti Smith&#x27;s recording &quot;People Have the Power.&quot; On occasion this involvement would go beyond simple songwriting and take the form of sometimes-spectacular concerts or televised events, often raising money for charity and awareness of global issues.

===Live Aid concerts===

Rock and roll as social activism reached a milestone in the Live Aid concerts, held July 13, 1985, which were an outgrowth of the 1984 charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; and became the largest musical concert in history with performers on two main stages, one in London, England and the other in Philadelphia, USA (plus some other acts performing in other countries) and televised worldwide. The concert lasted 16 hours and featured nearly everybody who was in the forefront of rock and pop in 1985. The charity event raised millions of dollars for famine relief in Africa. Live Aid became a model for many other fund-raising and consciousness-raising efforts, including the Farm Aid concerts for family farmers in North America, and televised performances benefiting victims of the September 11 attacks. Live Aid itself was reprised in 2005 with the Live 8 concert, to raise awareness of global economic policy. Environmental issues have also been a common theme, one example being Live Earth.

==Religion==
The common usage of the term &quot;rock god&quot; acknowledges the quasi-religious quality of the adulation some rock stars receive. Songwriters like Pete Townshend have explored spirituality within their work. John Lennon became infamous, particularly in the United States, after he remarked in 1966 that The Beatles were &quot;more popular than Jesus&quot;, with Beatles records being burned in public in some places in the South. However, he later said that this statement was misunderstood and not meant to be anti-Christian.

Iron Maiden, Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne, King Diamond, Alice Cooper, Led Zeppelin, Marilyn Manson, Slayer and numerous others have also been accused of being satanists, immoral or otherwise having an &quot;evil&quot; influence on their listeners. Anti-religious sentiments also appear in punk and hardcore. There&#x27;s the example of the song &quot;Filler&quot; by Minor Threat, the name and famous logo of the band Bad Religion and criticism of Christianity and all religions is an important theme in anarcho-punk and crust punk.

===Christianity===
Christian rock, alternative rock, metal, punk, and hardcore are specific, identifiable genres of rock music with strong Christian overtones and influence. Many groups and individuals who are not considered to be Christian rock artists have religious beliefs themselves. For example; The Edge and Bono of U2 are a Methodist and an Anglican, respectively; Bruce Springsteen is a Roman Catholic; and Brandon Flowers of The Killers is a Latter Day Saint. Carlos Santana, Ted Nugent, and John Mellencamp are all other examples of rock stars who profess some form of Christian faith.

However, some conservative Christians single out the music genres of hip hop and rock as well as blues and jazz as containing &quot;jungle beats&quot;, or &quot;jungle music&quot;, and claim that it is a beat or musical style that is inherently evil, immoral, or sensual. Thus, according to them, any song in the rap, hip hop and rock genres is inherently evil because of the song&#x27;s musical beat, regardless of the song&#x27;s lyrics or message. A few even extend this analysis even to Christian rock songs.

Christian conservative author David Noebel is one of the most notable opponents of the existence of jungle beats. In his writings and speeches, Noebel held that the use of such beats in music was a communist plot to subvert the morality of the youth of the United States. Pope Benedict XVI was quoted as saying, according to the British Broadcasting Corporation, that &quot;Rock... is the expression of the elemental passions, and at rock festivals it assumes a sometimes cultic character, a form of worship, in fact, in opposition to Christian worship.&quot;

===Satanism===

Some metal bands use demonic imagery for artistic and/or entertainment purposes, though many do not worship or believe in Satan. Ozzy Osbourne is reported to be Anglican and Alice Cooper is a known born-again Christian. In some cases, though, metal performers have expressed satanic views. Numerous others in the early Norwegian black metal scene were Satanists. The most known example of this is Euronymous, who claimed that he worshiped Satan as a god. Varg Vikernes (back then called &quot;the Count&quot; or Grishnak) has also been called a Satanist, even though he has rejected that label. Even within this localized musical subgenre, however, the arson attacks against Christian churches and other centers of worship were condemned by some prominent figures within the Norwegian black metal scene, such as Kjetil Manheim.

<text>Timothy P. Dunigan (born August 2, 1955) is an American actor who is best known for having played the lead role of Captain Jonathan Power in &quot;Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future&quot;. He also played con-man 1st Lt. Templeton &quot;The Face-Man&quot; Peck in the pilot for the 1980s hit &quot;The A-Team&quot; but was replaced by Dirk Benedict for the series. The reason given was that Dunigan was too young for the role, although series creators Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell had wanted Benedict from the start but were overruled by the network executives.

==Early life==
Dunigan was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to the late Robert S. Dunigan and his Romanian-American wife Olga Dunigan Argint.

==Acting career==
As to why Dunigan wasn&#x27;t chosen to participate in &quot;The A-Team&quot; beyond the pilot, according to the actor himself, &quot;I look[ed] even younger on camera than I am. So it was difficult to accept me as a veteran of the Vietnam War, which ended when I was a sophomore in high school.&quot; He played the role of Davy Crockett as a young man in &quot;The Magical World of Disney&quot;&#x27;s 1988–89 miniseries &quot;Davy Crockett&quot;. He had guest-starring television roles on several hit series: &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Empty Nest&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, and &quot;JAG&quot;. During a phone interview for G4&#x27;s &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot; program, it was revealed that Dunigan had quit acting and became a mortgage broker following his role in &quot;JAG&quot; in 2002.

==Family==
Dunigan was the cousin of the late sports announcer Harry Caray. His uncle on his mother&#x27;s side, Nicholas Argint, was a veteran of World War II, member of American Legion Post 111 in Missouri.

<text>Tania Cagnotto (; born 15 May 1985) is an Italian diver. She is the first female Italian diver to win a medal in a World Championship. A five-time Olympian, she won medals in both individual and synchronized springboard diving in her final appearance at the Olympics in 2016. She is also a 20-time champion at the European level.

==Biography==
Tania Cagnotto was born in Bolzano, the daughter of Giorgio Cagnotto and Carmen Casteiner. Her parents were both Olympic divers, with her father winning four Olympic medals in the 1970s and 1980s.

Cagnotto was sponsored by the sport section of the Italian police force, GN Fiamme Gialle – Bolzano Nuoto.
Cagnotto won her first European gold medal at the 2004 championships in Madrid at the age of 19, winning the 10-meter platform event and also receiving a bronze medal for her performance in the 3-meter springboard competition. After a disappointing performance in the 10-meter platform final round at the Montreal 2005 World Championships, she won the bronze medal in the 3-meter springboard event. Cagnotto won a third consecutive bronze medal in the 3-meter springboard at the Rome 2009 World Championships, after a 4th place in the 1-meter springboard event. Together with Francesca Dallapè, she also won a silver medal in the 3-meter springboard synchronized event. 

Cagnotto competed in the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona, getting the silver medal in 1m springboard only 0.1 marks behind champion He Zi. She won the gold medal in the 1-meter springboard at the 2015 FINA World Championship held in Kazan; she was the first Italian female diver to win a World Championship in diving. In the same event, Cagnotto also won the bronze medal in the 3-meter springboard. 

Cagnotto announced that the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, her fifth Olympic games, were to be her last competitive events. After narrowly missing medals in London, she finally won a silver in the 3m synchro (with her partner Francesca Dallapé) and bronze in the women&#x27;s 3m.

Cagnotto competed in Torino in 12-14 May 2017 in 1m springboard as her last competition before retirement. She stated that she would coach diving after her ending her competitive career.

==Olympic results==
==Personal life==
Cagnotto is married to Stefano Parolin. She gave birth in Bolzano to their first child, daughter Maya, on 23 January 2018. In 2021 she gave birth to their second daughter, Lisa.

<doc id="959281" wikidata="Q6883400" url="?curid=959281" title="Mitsuya Cider">
<text>is a Japanese carbonated soft drink, created in 1884 and acquired by Asahi Soft Drinks in 1972. 

While branded as a &quot;cider&quot;, the East Asian use of &quot;cider&quot; refers to a very different drink from that typically referred to in English: the basic flavor can be described as a cross between a lemon-lime drink and Ginger Ale, though Asahi has formulated and introduced additional flavors, including grape, lemon, mikan and white peach. Occasionally, Mitsuya Cider will release its &quot;White Cider&quot; version with its own variations, which include &quot;White Cider with Melon&quot;. In 2020, Asahi re-released a Showa-era flavor, &quot;Lemola&quot; for a limited time (still available in mid-2022). Lemola is a lemon-lime flavor. 

Mitsuya Cider used to be sold exclusively in ornately decorated metal bottles and cans, as well as in glass bottles, but is now produced primarily in plastic. The old style metal bottles are still available in many vending machines and convenience stores for customers who prefer the nostalgic packaging.

Also on the market are small hard candies marked with the same logo as the cider bottles, and a carbonation effect. The candy is made by mixing its ingredients and heating them until they melt, then exposing the mixture to pressurized carbon dioxide gas (about 600 pounds per square inch) and allowing it to cool. The process causes tiny high pressure bubbles to be trapped inside the candy. When placed in the mouth, coming into contact with saliva the candy breaks and dissolves, releasing the carbon dioxide from the tiny bubbles, resulting in a popping and sizzling sound and leaving a slight tingling sensation. The bubbles in the candy pieces can be viewed when aided by a microscope. This process is similar to Pop Rocks, but the resulting candy is spherical and of average size, about 2cm in diameter.

Mitsuya Cider gained exposure in the West during 2008 as a result of the Rickrolling internet meme, since Rick Astley was the face of the brand during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Rick Astley was featured in some of its TV commercials in Japan during the late 80s.

<doc id="959282" wikidata="Q1389152" url="?curid=959282" title="Ford Aerostar">
<text>The Ford Aerostar is a range of vans that was manufactured by Ford from the 1986 to the 1997 model years. The first minivan produced by Ford, the model line was marketed against the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari and the first two generations of the Chrysler minivans. Introduced shortly before the Ford Taurus, the Aerostar derived its name from its slope-nosed &quot;one-box&quot; exterior (although over six feet tall, the body of the Aerostar retained a , besting the Lincoln Mark VII).

The first minivan powered exclusively by V6 engines, the Aerostar was also one of the first vehicles to introduce all-wheel drive to the segment in North America. The model line was sold in multiple configurations, including passenger and cargo vans, along with an extended-length body. Sold primarily in the United States and Canada, a limited number of vehicles were exported outside of North America.

The Aerostar was replaced for the 1995 model year by the front-wheel drive Ford Windstar; Ford sold both model lines concurrently through the 1997 model year. The role of the Aerostar cargo van was left unfilled, with the Ford Transit Connect serving as the closest successor (in terms of size and capability).

For its entire production, the model line was assembled by the St. Louis Assembly Plant in Hazelwood, Missouri. In total, 2,029,577 vehicles were produced across a single generation.

==Development==

===Carousel: the garageable van===

For Ford Motor Company, the development of the minivan began life in the early 1970s as a companion model to the third-generation Ford Econoline/Club Wagon, under development for the 1975 model year. As the full-size van was slated to grow in size, Ford explored the concept of a &quot;garageable van&quot;, designed with a roofline to easily fit through a typical garage door opening. Additional objectives for the &quot;garageable van&quot; included increased interior space (over station wagons) and more desirable styling (over full-size vans). Dubbed the Ford Carousel, a prototype was tested from 1972 to 1974, using the 124-inch wheelbase chassis of the Club Wagon.

To achieve its &quot;garageable&quot; status, the roofline of the Carousel was lowered approximately 12 inches in comparison to a standard-wheelbase Ford Club Wagon, placing its height close to that of the later Ford Windstar/Freestar. The Carousel also received a more steeply raked windshield, a new, longer, front fascia, and a wagon-style roofline, with wraparound window glass. In a key indication of its future as a family-oriented vehicle, the Carousel had a rear tailgate with a drop-down rear window; like the LTD station wagon, it was fitted with simulated exterior woodgrain trim. The interior of the prototype was fitted two rear bench seats trimmed similar to the Ford Country Squire and Mercury Colony Park.

While the prototype would receive a positive response from many Ford executives, for a potential 1976 introduction, the Carousel did not reach production under any model name. At the time of its development, financial constraints forced the company to divert funds towards critical projects, such as the development of the Fox platform, Panther platform, and 1980 Ford F-Series. Along with it not replacing an existing Ford model line, the Carousel did not compete against an existing GM or Chrysler vehicle. Developed during the 1973 energy crisis, the Carousel was fitted with a 460 V8, shared with full-size Ford vehicles and one-ton Ford trucks.

In 1978, Lee Iacocca and Hal Sperlich both departed Ford and were hired by Chrysler. At the time, the company had worked on its own &quot;garageable van&quot; project for a year, leading to its approval for development for 1979. While Chrysler would adopt the basic concept of the Ford Carousel prototype, in terms of its height and seat configuration, the resulting 1984 Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager would be very different vehicles from the Carousel in terms of layout and engineering.

===Aerostar: all-new design===

In 1974, Ford management ended development of the Carousel prototype; through the rest of the 1970s, the company continued to see potential in &quot;garageable vans&quot;, pursuing further design and market research on the subject. By 1980, Ford committed to a smaller vehicle, partially as the American automotive industry learned of the development of the Chrysler minivans; following the 1979 gas crisis, the company felt a 1980s release of the Carousel (a rebodied E-Series) could be an uncompetitive decision.

Along with potential fuel economy increases, in its marketplace research, Ford discovered a smaller all-new design could accommodate several design features desired in the marketplace.

* Garageability 
* 7-passenger seating, walk-around interior space 
* Fuel economy comparable to compact cars; trailer towing/payload comparable to full-size station wagons 
* Modern exterior design and vehicle features

The new van project adopted a rear-wheel drive layout for two primary reasons. While the new van was to given a carlike ride (its 119-inch wheelbase largely placed the wheels at all four corners), another key objective for the design to tow 5000 pounds (matching the Ford Ranger, then also in design). To lower production and engineering costs, the rear-wheel drive configuration allowed shared mechanical components with multiple Ford light trucks. While Chrysler and GM small vans shared chassis commonality with other model lines (to varying degrees), the Ford small van received a model-distinct chassis (with model-specific front and rear suspension).

The design of the Aerostar carried over two primary design features of the 1972 Carousel prototype, including its approximate 6-foot &quot;garageable&quot; height and long wheelbase; a large B-pillar also allowed for large window area. Beyond the drawing board, the design of the Aerostar progressed further by the introduction of two Ghia-designed 7-passenger concept vehicles, the 1982 Ford Aerovan and the 1984 Ford APV. Both derived from the Ford Escort: the Aerovan was a two-door wagon; the APV was a three-door MPV/van. While smaller than the American van project, the 1982 Ford Aerovan previewed the sloped-nose front fascia of both the Aerostar and the larger 1986 Ford Transit.

While designed by its European-owned styling firm, the design of the Aerovan received a positive response from the public, leading Ford to progress with a highly advanced design for the exterior. Though the company would ultimately trail the Chrysler minivans by nearly two years in its introduction, Ford considered innovative design and features as a key selling point of the vehicle.

To further live up to the first half of its name, the Aerostar adopted integrated plastic bumpers (also previewed by the Aerovan), in contrast to the attached metal bumpers of the E-series. To further improve fuel economy, Ford used multiple lightweight materials for the body, including plastic fuel tanks, liftgate doors, and hoods; aluminum was used for the driveshaft, axles, and wheels.

In 1984, Ford debuted the Aerostar nameplate on a concept vehicle. Nearly identical to the production vehicle, the 1984 concept was styled with a two-slot grille and composite-lens headlamps; along with skirted rear fenders, the concept differed in detail changes related to the taillamps, windows, and door handles. Intended for an early 1986 model-year introduction (prior to the Taurus), the production Aerostar was intended to have a three-engine lineup, adopted from the Ranger/Bronco II. A 2.3L inline-4 was to be standard, along with a 2.8L V6; as a first for an American-produced minivan, a 2.3L turbodiesel inline-4 was to be offered as a second option.

To officially launch the model line in the summer of 1985, Ford used the &quot;Ford Aerostar Airlift&quot;, using eight Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport aircraft to simultaneously airlift Aerostars into eight cities across the United States. In total, the entire development of the model line would cost Ford over $300 million; though lower in cost than the development of the Chrysler minivans, the Ford Aerostar was developed at the same time as the Ford Taurus (costing Ford $3.5 billion)

== Overview ==

=== Chassis ===
The Ford Aerostar (developed under Ford model code VN1, the first Ford chassis given an alphanumeric designation) uses a rear-wheel drive chassis configuration. Developed specifically for the model line, the chassis combines unibody chassis construction with full-length frame rails. While using unibody chassis construction to reduce weight, the hybrid frame design provided the Aerostar with a 5,000-pound tow rating ( times the Caravan/Voyager, and matching that of the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari. The design has been utilized by other widely produced designs in the automotive industry, including the 1971–1996 Chevrolet Van and 1984–2001 Jeep Cherokee XJ.

In a break from Ford light-truck precedent, the Aerostar did not use Twin I-Beam front suspension, instead using unequal-length A-arms and coil springs for the front suspension. The rear suspension was a coil-sprung live rear axle fitted with a three-link configuration (similar to the Ford Panther-platform chassis of the time, though not sharing commonality). During its production, the Aerostar was the only minivan sold in North America with coil springs at all four wheels. Through its production, the model line was fitted with front disc brakes and rear drum brakes.

==== Powertrain details ====
For its 1986 launch, the Aerostar was introduced with two engines shared with the Ranger/Bronco II. A 100 hp 2.3 L inline-4 (also shared with the Mustang) was standard with a 115 hp 2.8 L V6 (from Ford of Europe) offered as an option; as a running change during 1986, the 2.8 L engine was replaced by a 145 hp 3.0 L V6 (shared with the Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable). Initially intended as an option, the four-cylinder turbodiesel of the 1984 concept vehicle was dropped after prototype testing. For 1988, the 2.3 L engine was discontinued, with the 3.0 L V6 becoming the sole engine offering (with the Aerostar becoming the first minivan offering only V6 engines). For 1990, coinciding with the introduction of the E-4WD option, a 160 hp 4.0 L V6 was introduced; the engine was paired with the all-wheel drive system and was an option on higher-trim rear-wheel drive vehicles.

Sharing its transmissions with the Ranger/Bronco II, the Aerostar was available with a five-speed manual until 1995 (nearly exclusively in cargo vans and XL trim); in contrast to Chrysler minivans, all automatic transmissions were 4-speed overdrive units. For 1997, a 5-speed overdrive automatic transmission was introduced for the 4.0 L V6 (a first in the minivan segment).

==== All-wheel drive system (1990–1997) ====
During the 1990 model year, Ford introduced an all-wheel drive system for the Aerostar, called E-4WD (Electronic 4-Wheel Drive). Developed specifically for the model line, the E-4WD system was offered from 1990 to 1997 on XLT and Eddie Bauer trims. In contrast to the four-wheel drive systems in other Ford light trucks, E-4WD was not configured nor intended for off-road driving. While no low-range gearing was provided, the system provided increased traction in adverse weather conditions without driver input.

The E-4WD system used a Dana TC28 transfer case with a center differential (regulated by an electronically controlled electro-magnetic clutch); all four wheels received traction at all times. To accommodate the added weight and friction losses, the system was paired with the higher-torque 4.0L V6 and automatic transmission.

Following the 1997 discontinuation of the model line, Ford did not offer all-wheel drive as an option for North American-market vans until the 2020 Transit.

=== Body design ===
Distinguished by its sloped-nosed design, the Ford Aerostar utilized a &quot;one-box&quot; design similar to the Ford Transit and Renault Espace; in contrast to its European counterparts, the long wheelbase of the Aerostar placed the wheels near the corners, minimizing body overhangs. In an effort to further improve its fuel efficiency and aerodynamics (and lower its curb weight), multiple plastic body parts from the 1984 concept car were adopted by the production vehicle, including the bumper covers, fuel tank, and rear hatch.

==== Exterior ====

For 1988, the exterior saw a minor detail change to exterior badging, relocating it from both fenders to the tailgate; it was also changed from chrome to silver in color. In another revision, the &quot;V6&quot; and &quot;Electronic Fuel Injection&quot; badges were deleted (as both features were now standard).

As a response to the Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager, Ford released an (unnamed) extended-length version of the Aerostar for the 1989 model year. Extending the rear body 14 inches in length, the option shared the 119-inch wheelbase with the standard-length body. During the 1990s, the extended-length Aerostar would become the most popular version of the vehicle.

For 1989, the exterior was updated for the first time, with the chrome grille replaced by a black-trim grille; bracketed towing mirrors were replaced by power-operated mirrors.

For 1992, the Aerostar received its second (and most substantial) exterior update. The grille was changed slightly in color from 1989 to 1991, with the Ford Blue Oval relocated from the center to the top slot of the grille (similar to the Ford Explorer); Ford replaced the sealed-beam headlights with replaceable-bulb composite units (and clear-lens turn-signal lenses). While remaining 14 inches in size, nearly all versions of the Aerostar received restyled wheels.

In anticipation of withdrawing the model line after 1994, few changes were made to the Aerostar after 1992. To comply with federal regulations, the body received a center brake light for 1994. For 1997, the taillamps were revised for the first time (with the deletion of the amber turn signal lenses); XLT-trim vehicles received newly designed 14×6&quot; seven-hole alloy wheels.

==== Interior ====
In contrast to its contemporary one-box exterior design, the Ford Aerostar adopted many industry-standard features in its interior design. Sharing the same 2-2-3 seven-passenger layout of its Chrysler and GM competitors, XLT and Eddie Bauer-trim vehicles were offered with optional second-row bucket seats (a feature popularized from full-size conversion vans). Another option allowed both rear bench seats to fold down (making a bed); both rows of rear seats were removable.

However, the interior also adopted several European-influenced design features. At its launch, the Aerostar used a floor-mounted shifter for both its manual and automatic transmissions; it was equipped with a handbrake (which remains a feature in all US-market Ford minivans). In a fashion similar to the Volkswagen Vanagon, the second-row windows slid open. While cupholders were relegated to an optional armrest in the third-row seats (and a later console on the engine cover), the vehicle could be specified with up to two cigarette lighters and six ashtrays.

For 1992, the interior underwent a revision alongside the exterior. Coinciding with the addition of a driver-side airbag (and three-point seatbelts for all six outboard seats), the dashboard underwent a complete redesign. Both analog and digital instrument panels were replaced by more legible units; the controls were improved (many shared with the redesigned 1992 Econoline), introducing a column-shift automatic transmission. For 1993, integrated child safety seats were introduced as an option.

=== Trim ===
Along with a cargo van (distinguished by its available double rear doors and lack of side windows), the Aerostar passenger van (called the Wagon) came in two trim levels: base-trim &quot;XL&quot; and deluxe-trim &quot;XLT&quot; (in keeping with the Ford truck line). Many features standard on the XLT were available as extra-cost options on the XL, such as power windows, mirrors, and locks; air conditioning; and privacy glass.

XLT-trim Wagons also included the following features as extra-cost options:
* Overhead trip computer with auto-dimming rearview mirror (featuring Distance to Empty (English/Metric), Trip Mileage, Average Fuel Economy, Instant Fuel Economy, Average Speed (English/Metric), along with dual map lights)
* Rear climate control
* Second-row Captain&#x27;s chairs (quad seats)
* Fold-flat second and third-row bench seatbacks
* 8-speaker AM/FM stereo with cassette player
* Premium AM/FM/cassette sound system with 7-band equalizer and rear-seat headphone jacks
* Rear-wheel anti-lock brakes 
* Electronic four-wheel drive (see section)
* Two-tone paint
* 14-inch aluminum wheels

==== Eddie Bauer Wagon (1988–1994) ====
Introduced during the 1988 model year, the Aerostar was one of the first Ford vehicles to feature the outdoors-themed Eddie Bauer brand as a trim package. Marketed above the XLT, the Aerostar Eddie Bauer was the first minivan marketed towards luxury buyers (for 1988, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country was produced as a compact station wagon, not becoming a minivan until the 1990 model year).

The Eddie Bauer trim combined the interior convenience features of the XLT trim with two-tone exterior paint (tan as the accent color on the rocker panels and wheel trim) and a tan outdoors-themed interior. As on the XLT, cloth seating surfaces were standard; as part of the 1992 update, leather seats became an option. A standard feature of the trim package (an option on the XLT) was a feature allowing the second and third row bench seats to fold flat into a large bed across the rear half of the interior. However, a large number of Eddie Bauer Aerostars were ordered with the optional second-row bucket seats/captain&#x27;s chairs.

Following the introduction of the extended-length wagon in 1989, the Eddie Bauer trim was available in both body configurations. After 1989, the option package came with the 4.0L V6 standard, though buyers could choose between rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive powertrains.

After the 1994 model year, the Eddie Bauer trim was discontinued as the Aerostar trim line was consolidated to the cargo van and the Aerostar XLT.

==== Aerostar Sport (1992–1996) ====

In 1992, the Aerostar Sport was introduced as an option package available for any non-Eddie Bauer Aerostar Wagon. Similar to its Chevrolet Astro RS/GMC Safari CS and Dodge Caravan ES counterparts, the Aerostar Sport was largely a cosmetic upgrade. Distinguished by their silver-accented paint and &quot;Sport&quot; pinstriping, the Sport featured integrated running boards with a color-matched front air dam and color-matched rear mud flaps. On darker colors, the front grille and chrome was painted body color.

The trim version of an Aerostar Sport is most easily identified by its wheels: XL Sport Wagons, with full wheel covers; XLT Sport Wagons (less common), with aluminum wheels.

== Concept vehicles ==

=== Ford Aerostar (1984) ===
The Aerostar name was first revealed on a 1984 concept vehicle. Serving as a close preview of the production model line, the 1984 Ford Aerostar was one of the most aerodynamic vehicles designed by Ford (at the time); with a , the Aerostar was sleeker than the Ford Mustang SVO and the Lincoln Continental Mark VII.

The front-engine configuration of the Aerostar was chosen for multiple reasons. In its research, Ford found that potential buyers preferred the configuration over rear and mid-engine vehicles (used by German/Japanese imported vans). The rear-wheel drive platform was engineered with class-leading payload and towing capacity over front-wheel drive minivans, with a 2000-pound payload and 5000-pound tow rating (2½ times the capacity of the Chrysler minivans).

In the change from concept to production, very little of the exterior design would change, except for the window glass, headlights, and grille. In a notable change, the turbodiesel engine option (projected to provide up to 40mpg), was dropped from the engine lineup before production.

=== HFX Aerostar Ghia (1987) ===
Introduced at the 1987 Frankfurt Auto Show, the HFX (High Feature Experimental) Aerostar Ghia was a prototype of future minivan design. Two running prototypes were built from the collaboration of Ford and Ghia; both used the stock 3.0L Vulcan V6 and A4LD automatic transmission.

The HFX concept borrowed some features used in other Ford vehicles, such as four-wheel air suspension and electronic climate control. From there, some of the technologies showcased in the HFX had never before been seen in a minivan; this included run-flat tires, adjustable pedals, power-sliding side doors, electric power steering, ABS, traction control, seatbelt pretensioners, and movable grille shutters. On the rear, an LCD display was installed for the use of displaying 12 pre-programmed warning messages.

== Awards ==
The Aerostar was named &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Truck of the Year for 1990.

==Discontinuation==
Although the Ford Aerostar sold well, the minivan market segment was dominated by Chrysler minivans in the late 1980s. In 1988, Ford commenced design work on a successor to the Aerostar for a planned 1993 introduction. To compete more directly against Chrysler, what was to become the Ford Windstar adopted the form factor of the long-wheelbase Chrysler minivans and conceptually similar front-wheel drive sedan underpinnings, developed alongside the 1996 Ford Taurus.

With the Ford Windstar being readied for a 1995 model-year introduction, 1994 was set to be the final year for the Aerostar. As with the planned replacement of the third-generation Ford Mustang with the dissimilar front-wheel-drive Ford Probe in the late 1980s, negative reactions from Ford dealers and the public prompted Ford to instead sell the Aerostar and Windstar side-by-side.

On March 17, 1997, Ford announced the discontinuation of the Ford Aerostar, alongside the Ford Aspire, Ford Probe, and Ford Thunderbird/Mercury Cougar. The final vehicle rolled off the St. Louis assembly line on August 22, 1997; a total of 2,029,577 were produced over 12 years. Alongside the production of the Ford Windstar, a primary factor leading to the cancellation of the Ford Aerostar was an impending requirement for the addition of dual airbags (set to take effect on September 1, 1997), which would have required a complete (and costly) redesign of the front dashboard and front crash structure.

The Ford Windstar (and later Ford Freestar) was offered in a cargo van configuration, but the first direct successor to the Aerostar Van, in terms of size and capability, is the Ford Transit Connect. Imported into North America since 2010, the front-wheel drive Transit Connect is also offered in passenger configurations; a 2014 redesign led to the first seven-seat Ford minivan since 2007.

<text>A satellite is a subviral agent that depends on the coinfection of a host cell with a helper virus for its replication. Satellites can be divided into two major classes: satellite viruses and satellite nucleic acids. Satellite viruses, which are most commonly associated with plants, are also found in mammals, arthropods, and bacteria. They encode structural proteins to enclose their genetic material, which are therefore distinct from the structural proteins of their helper viruses. Satellite nucleic acids, in contrast, do not encode their own structural proteins, but instead are encapsulated by proteins encoded by their helper viruses. The genomes of satellites range upward from 359 nucleotides in length for satellite tobacco ringspot virus RNA (STobRV).

Most viruses have the capability to use host enzymes or their own replication machinery to independently replicate their own viral RNA. Satellites, in contrast, are completely dependent on a helper virus for replication. The symbiotic relationship between a satellite and a helper virus to catalyze the replication of a satellite genome is also dependent on the host to provide components like replicases to carry out replication. 

A satellite virus of mamavirus that inhibits the replication of its host has been termed a virophage. However, the usage of this term remains controversial due to the lack of fundamental differences between virophages and classical satellite viruses.

== History and discovery ==
The tobacco necrosis virus was the virus that led to the discovery of the first satellite virus in 1962. Scientists discovered that the first satellite had the components to make its own protein shell. A few years later in 1969, scientists discovered another symbiotic relationship with the tobacco ringspot nepovirus (TobRV) and another satellite virus. The emergence of satellite RNA is said to have come from either the genome of the host or its co-infecting agents, and any vectors leading to transmission.

A satellite virus important to human health that demonstrates the need for co-infection to replicate and infect within a host is the virus that causes hepatitis D. Hepatitis D or delta virus (HDV) was discovered in 1977 by Mario Rizzetto and is differentiated from hepatitis A, B, and C because it requires viral particles from hepatitis B virus (HBV) to replicate and infect liver cells. HBV provides a surface antigen, HBsAg, which is utilized by HDV to create a super-infection resulting in liver failure. HDV is found all over the globe but is most prevalent in Africa, the Middle East and southern Italy.

==Satellite compared to a virus==

==Classification==
The classification of subviral agents is ongoing. The following uses an outline for subviral agents in a 2011 ICTV report. Many of the taxa have since been assigned more formal names in 2019, so these are included when possible.

=== Satellite viruses ===
Some satellite viruses have been assigned a taxon. The following reflects the results of a 2015 proposal that has since been accepted (Taxoprop 2015.009a).

*Single-stranded RNA satellite viruses
**(unassigned to a family)

=== Satellite nucleic acids ===
The following may not be comprehensive in its ICTV coverage. The nomenclature for satellite RNAs is to prefix the host virus name with &quot;sat&quot;.

Satellite-like nucleic acids resemble satellite nucleic acids, in that they replicate with the aid of helper viruses. However they differ in that they can encode functions that can contribute to the success of their helper viruses; while they are sometimes considered to be genomic elements of their helper viruses, they are not always found within their helper viruses.

<doc id="959291" wikidata="Q1569504" url="?curid=959291" title="The Tribe (1999 TV series)">
<text>The Tribe is a science fiction drama television series which premiered on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom on 24 April 1999. The series was created by Raymond Thompson and Harry Duffin, and was developed and produced by the Cloud 9 Screen Entertainment Group in New Zealand. The series was commissioned by Channel 5, who received the initial screening rights. The series made its New Zealand premiere in 2000 on TV4.

Primarily aimed at teenagers, &quot;The Tribe&quot; is set in a post-apocalyptic city in which all adults have been killed as the result of an unknown virus. The series focuses on the remaining children and teenagers who must navigate the social and personal issues of adolescence, while being faced with the larger problems of a society in a state of anarchy. The inhabitants of the city form social groups, or tribes, with the focus of the series on the Mall Rats, who fight to survive among other threatening tribes such as the Locos. Overarching themes include the focus on change from tradition, empowerment, religion, and the exploration of power and corruption. The series was filmed in Wellington, New Zealand.

The series ran for 260 episodes and aired its final episode on 6 September 2003. A sequel series entitled &quot;The New Tomorrow&quot; was commissioned by Channel 5 and the Seven Network in Australia and first aired in 2005. It depicted the descendants of characters from &quot;The Tribe&quot; and was aimed at a younger audience. &quot;The Tribe&quot; experienced a resurgence in popularity after screening on ABC3 in Australia in 2009. This led to Cloud 9 developing a series of novels to continue the story of the television series, the first of which was released in 2011.

==Plot==

===Season 1===
In a post-apocalyptic city, all of the adults have been killed as a result of an unknown virus, leaving the children and teenagers to survive in a state of anarchy. Several social groups, or tribes, have formed, including the &quot;Locos&quot;, an unruly tribe controlling the city under the leadership of Zoot, who is later accidentally killed. On the streets, Amber and Dal lead a group of children to safety and take refuge in an abandoned shopping mall, forming a new tribe called the &quot;Mall Rats&quot;. They are joined by Bray and Trudy, who is pregnant; Bray&#x27;s brother, Zoot, is the father. The tribe learns to solve issues including food and water shortage. A second wave of the virus strikes the city, and the tribe tries searching to find an Antidote. They travel to a base called Eagle Mountain, where a pre-recorded message confirms the Antidote&#x27;s existence.

===Season 2===
At Eagle Mountain, Amber and Zandra, who is pregnant, are killed in an explosion. The tribe continues searching for an antidote to the virus and are successful, with Tai-San becoming the only one aware of the formula to produce it. Under Bray&#x27;s leadership, the Mall Rats use their position of power to unite the other tribes and bring peace to the city. A bill of rights is developed by Danni, along with a trading market in the mall, and a newsletter by Ellie detailing the city&#x27;s progress. The virus is later diminished, and a new tribe called the &quot;Chosen&quot; surfaces, they are remnants of the Locos who now worship Zoot as their god.

===Season 3===
The Chosen take control of the city, led by the Guardian and the &quot;Supreme Mother&quot;, who is a brainwashed Trudy. The Mall Rats are captured and, along with other prisoners of the city, are given the choice to join the Chosen or work as slaves, with many civilians being sent away due to rebellion. After escaping, Bray, Ebony, Lex and Dal encounter the Eco tribe and discover that its leader is Amber, whose death had been faked by Ebony. The Eco tribe join the revolt and the remaining Mall Rats recruit other tribes to their side. The Chosen are overthrown, and Ebony is elected as city leader though manipulation; she banishes Bray and Amber for speaking against her as a mysterious plane invades the city.

===Season 4===
The city is invaded and conquered by a group of paratroopers, who are called the &quot;Technos&quot; and possess advanced technology. Ebony maintains control of the city through a deal with the Technos general, Jay. After Bray is captured, Trudy helps Amber give birth on the outskirts of town. They flee to the Ecos, then later rejoin the Mall Rats. In an attempt to create a utopia, the leader of the Technos, Ram, releases a virtual reality game to which the people of the city become addicted to in exchange for workload. Ebony and Jay betray Ram and escape the city. The Mall Rats defeat Ram with the assistance of Ram&#x27;s lieutenant, Mega.

===Season 5===
Mega becomes the new leader of the Technos, and plans to take over the city. He orders everyone to be branded with a barcode and set to manual labour. Ebony is manipulated by virtual reality to believe that Zoot is alive. The Mall Rats try to learn the location of their members who were removed by the Technos. Ram is rescued by a vagabond, Slade, who takes him to the country town Liberty. Amber and Jay lead an attack against the city, capturing Mega. Ram infiltrates Mega&#x27;s technology and creates an artificial intelligence program, which goes rogue and releases a new virus. The Mall Rats and their allies evacuate the city by boat.

===Development===

Discussion which led to the creation of the series began when Raymond Thompson, co-founder of the independent production company Cloud 9 Screen Entertainment Group, known for his work as a screenwriter on the soap &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot;, was approached by Nick Wilson of Channel 5 to &quot;develop a soap for the millennium, targeting a child/adolescent market&quot;. Thompson recalled an idea that he had in the 1980s about a world without adults, run by tribes of children and teenagers. Having already worked with writer Harry Duffin on several occasions, Thompson contacted him in November 1997 to work with him on further developing the concept for Cloud 9. They commissioned and recruited a team of ten writers to adapt the storylines and by July 1998 the first four scripts of &quot;The Tribe&quot; were finished.

Pre-production for series one started in June 1998 and filming began in August 1998. Principal photography was completed in March 1999 and the first episode premiered on Channel 5 on 24 April 1999. By June 2001, it was the broadcaster&#x27;s &quot;leading children&#x27;s programme&quot;.

The show&#x27;s official website played a role in further development of &quot;The Tribe&quot;. Viewers used the website to discuss the show in a forum. Thompson revealed that he used viewer response for audience research which helped develop additional stories.

===Filming===
The cast and crew amounted to between 400 and 500 people on each season of &quot;The Tribe&quot;. Filming of each season took about four to six months, chiefly in two studios at Cloud 9&#x27;s production centre in Wellington, New Zealand. The permanent set of the &quot;Phoenix Shopping Mall&quot; was located in Studio A. This large set took five weeks to build prior to the commencement of principal photography and was said to be the largest set built for a production in New Zealand at the time. All of the shops contained in the Mall were built to almost realistic shop size specifications and designed to last for a long time.

Studio B housed the sewers that the Mall Rats use to secretly escape the Mall, as well as temporary structures that were built for scenes outside the Mall. Between the filming of the second and third series of &quot;The Tribe&quot;, the Mall set was repainted and redressed for use on another Cloud 9 production, &quot;Atlantis High&quot;.

Scenes of &quot;The Tribe&quot; were also shot on location in and around Wellington. For example, the Cloud 9 Studios car park was used as the exterior of the Mall and Alice&#x27;s and Ellie&#x27;s farmhouse was built in the rural area of Whitemans Valley in Upper Hutt. At times, over some weekends, the crew closed off Wellington streets to shoot scenes that took place in the desolate city streets.

===Casting===
Most of the cast had agents prior to the casting in 1998, as they had already worked on productions that were filmed in New Zealand, such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; or &quot;Mirror, Mirror II&quot;.

Many of the actors had worked with Thompson on other Cloud 9 productions before they auditioned for &quot;The Tribe&quot;. Jennyfer Jewell (Ellie) and Ryan Runciman (Ryan) had worked on &quot;The Enid Blyton Adventure Series&quot; in 1996 and Jewell had also starred in &quot;The Enid Blyton Secret Series&quot; in 1997 alongside Daniel James (Zoot). Beth Allen (Amber) and Michael Wesley-Smith (Jack) had been cast in &quot;The Legend of William Tell&quot; in 1998. Many cast members from series one had acted in William Shatner&#x27;s &quot;A Twist in the Tale&quot; in 1999.

The majority of the actors cast in series one were students and were tutored between scenes at Cloud 9&#x27;s production centre. The underage cast members stayed in the &quot;Cast House&quot; for the duration of the shoot and were accompanied by chaperones on set.

===Cancellation===
Pre-production for series six started in September 2003 and a script for a &quot;Tribe&quot; movie was written and put on the market. The scripts for the first two episodes of series six were included on the Series 5 DVD box set (released in 2006), and told the story of the Mall Rats as they arrived on an unknown island.

However, Nick Wilson and Thompson decided that although &quot;the show was still performing well, [they] felt that the cast was getting too old [and that] it was beginning to stretch the core proposition.&quot; Some of the cast and crew members went on to work on other productions.

==Release==
===Broadcast===
Series one of &quot;The Tribe&quot; premiered in the United Kingdom on 24 April 1999 on Five (Channel 5). It was broadcast on Channel 5 every Saturday. The final two episodes of &quot;The Tribe&quot; were shown on 6 September 2003 on Five.

==Sequels==

=== &quot;The New Tomorrow&quot; ===

During pre-production for the planned series six of &quot;The Tribe&quot;, Channel 5 and Cloud 9 created a sequel television series, &quot;The New Tomorrow&quot;. Twenty-six episodes were produced, which aired in 2005 on the Seven Network in Australia and on Five in the United Kingdom. The series was also filmed in Wellington, with twenty core cast and up to a hundred crew members, including a large number who had worked on Peter Jackson&#x27;s&#x27;s &quot;King Kong&quot;. Many themes and storylines intended for &quot;The Tribe&quot;″s series six were used and adapted for the new series. &quot;The New Tomorrow&quot; was aimed at a younger audience, 8- to , but followed the same theme of children creating a new world without the adults. It was set further in the future and followed the story of four Tribes: the Ants, the Barbs, the Privileged and the Discards.

=== Unproduced movie ===
Before the series was cancelled, Raymond Thompson had been working on a screenplay for a &quot;Tribe&quot; movie in 2003. He mentioned that the film was &quot;a backstory. The lead up to the virus. And how cities of children came about... but lots more as well.&quot; It was also mentioned to be in the third draft before it was shelved due to the show&#x27;s cancellation. In 2011, &quot;The Tribe&quot; movie, named &quot;Tribes&quot;, was announced to be in development with the partnership of Legendary Pictures. Raymond Thompson revealed he had been working with Rob Cohen and Jason Rothenberg; the latter went on to produce &quot;The 100&quot;. In 2015, the project fell through due to creative differences. Since 2015, Thompson has been trying to produce a sequel and a motion picture, but is unable to say more details due to non-disclosure agreements.

<text>The GAZ-66 is a Soviet and later Russian 4x4 all-road (off-road) military truck produced by GAZ. It was one of the main cargo vehicles for motorized infantry of the Soviet Army and is still employed in former Soviet Union countries. It is nicknamed &quot;shishiga&quot; (шишига), &quot;shisharik&quot; (шишарик)/&quot;shehsherik&quot; (шешерик), &quot;trueman&quot; (in Siberia).

== History ==
After tests and trials, in 1969 GAZ-66 received the state quality mark of the USSR. It was the first USSR truck to receive such an award.

Almost one million vehicles of this type were built for both military and civilian use. The GAZ-66 has gained legendary status in many countries due to its reliability, simplicity and off-road capability. Since the 1960s, the GAZ-66 has been popular with armed forces and off-road enthusiasts. Production ceased in 1999, with the GAZ-3308 being produced instead.

==Artistry==
Kubota incorporates guitar, piano, percussion, into a majority of his song and often writes about love, heartbreak, and the celebration and humor of life. He has cited several musicians as his inspirations, including Stevie Wonder, Sly Stone, Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, and Donny Hathaway. Kubota&#x27;s style is rooted in vintage soul music. He heavily incorporates classical piano and drums with R&amp;B, soul, and pop music. He began experimenting with other genres, including reggae, go-go, psychedelic soul, funk, and rock music, in his latter albums, Kubojah: Parallel Word I, Bonga Wanga, Bumpin&#x27; Voyage, and Nothing But Your Love. Karen Hunter of &quot;New York Daily News&quot; stated &quot;He speaks with an accent, but sings in pure funk. Toshi Kubota, the Japanese soul sensation, blends the old sounds of Sam Cooke, Stevie Wonder and even Luther Vandross with an up-to-date smoothed-out funk a la D&#x27;Angelo.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine states &quot;Kubota&#x27;s favored &#x27;70s retro-glam ward-robe emphasizes the mood of the music he loves&quot;.

Kubota has vocal range of a tenor and falsetto, which spans three octaves. Often referred to as &quot;Funky Kubota&quot;, Kubota has been commended as having a strong, raw and impassioned voice; others feel that his voice is a &quot;sake-voiced rhythm&quot; at time and that he pushes his voice out of its natural range.

Kubota is listed as one of Japan&#x27;s best-selling artists, having sold over 16 million records worldwide.

==Personal life==
In 1989, Kubota left Japan to move to New York, where, as of 2004, he resides. In October 2004, Kubota married a 31-year-old woman working for a Norwegian company. Their first son was born on 24 December 2004.

<text>The Boulton Paul P.29 Sidestrand was a twin-engine biplane medium bomber of the Royal Air Force. Designed for daylight operations, it was manoeuvrable and provided with three defensive gun positions. Named after a village on the Norfolk coast near Boulton &amp; Paul&#x27;s factory in Norwich, the Sidestrand first flew in 1926 and entered service in 1928. It remained in service until 1936, equipping No. 101 Squadron RAF. It was an agile and relatively fast aircraft that was capable of aerobatic manoeuvres such as loops, rolls and spins.

==Design and development==
Boulton &amp; Paul Ltd of Norwich built a series of twin-engined biplanes starting with the Bourges of 1918, which although not ordered into production, had demonstrated excellent performance and manoeuvrability, followed by the &#x27;all-metal&#x27; Bolton of 1922 and the smaller Bugle of 1923. In 1924, the Air Ministry issued Specification 9/24 for an all-metal, twin-engined medium bomber, and Boulton &amp; Paul&#x27;s offering, designed by John Dudley North, led to an order for two prototypes early in 1925. The first aircraft flew in 1926, piloted by Squadron Leader Cecil Rea, the company&#x27;s first full-time test pilot.

The village of Sidestrand, chosen for the aircraft name, was the home of the Secretary of State for Air, Samuel Hoare. Only 20 Sidestrands were built. The first two were similar prototypes, designated the Sidestrand Mk I. Originally intended to be powered by two Napier Lion inline engines, the Mk I was eventually fitted with 425 hp (317 kW) Bristol Jupiter VI radial engines, which also powered the first six production Sidestrands, known as the Sidestrand Mk II. The remaining twelve aircraft were powered by 460 hp (343 kW) Jupiter VIIIFs as the Sidestrand Mk III. The six Mk IIs were subsequently re-engined to bring them up to the Mk III specification.

Building on Boulton &amp; Paul&#x27;s experience with the Bourges, Bolton and Bugle, the airframe was carefully designed with the help of a wind tunnel to keep drag to a minimum. The fuselage was constructed from steel tube with a fabric and plywood covering. Aluminium alloys were used for elements bearing lower structural loads, such as the outer interplane struts and wing ribs. Bombs were carried internally in open bays set into the fuselage. A small compartment under the cockpit enabled the bomb-aimer to lie prone when using his sight, and also housed the radio. The undercarriage had oleo suspension legs and a tailskid. Unusually, the engine mountings were hinged for ease of maintenance, and the nose also hinged allowing access to the back of the cockpit instrument panel and to the radio compartment. Production models incorporated a prominent Servo tab on the rudder and Frise ailerons to reduce pilot control loads. The elevators horns remained unchanged in production models from the Mk I, but the vertical fin became less angular. Automatic sprung leading-edge slats were added to the top planes to reduce stalling speed. The Mk III introduced a bomb-aiming window into the nose. Four-bladed propellers replaced two-bladed from March 1930. 

The Sidestrand usually had a crew of three: pilot, nose gunner/bomb aimer and a rear gunner. Additionally, a navigator/co-pilot could be accommodated in a small cockpit immediately aft of the pilot&#x27;s. There were three open gun positions; nose, dorsal and ventral. Armament for each position was a .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis gun, the weapon being moved between the two rear positions depending on where each aircraft flew in a formation. The bomb-load was limited to , less than contemporaries such as the Tupolev TB-1.

In the early 1930s a Sidestrand Mk III was fitted with Bristol Pegasus IM3 engines. This was intended to become the Sidestrand Mk IV, but eventually became the prototype for the redeveloped Boulton Paul Overstrand which would begin replacing the Sidestrand in service in 1936. Four Sidestrands were eventually converted to Overstrand standard and are essentially considered Overstrands.

==Operational history==
Deliveries to the re-formed No. 101 Squadron began in 1928 at RAF Bircham Newton. The two Mk Is were joined initially by six Mk IIs with un-geared Bristol Jupiter VI engines. These were followed by nine Mk III variants with geared Jupiter VIIIFs and the final three production aircraft were replacement Mk IIs. The squadron moved to RAF Andover in 1929 and to RAF Bicester in 1934.

The Sidestrand inherited the good manoeuvrability of the Boulton Paul P. 7 Bourges, and put on a notably impressive display at the 1932 RAF Pageant. But despite proving to be an excellent aircraft for bombing and gunnery, only No. 101 Squadron was so equipped.

As part of its peacetime round of training duties, the Squadron undertook mock combat exercises with fighter squadrons and participated in the annual bombing competition (usually held at RAF Catfoss). After a mock combat exercise in the summer of 1930 with Armstrong Whitworth Siskin fighters of No. 111 Squadron, it was noted in the No. 101 Squadron operations record book that, &quot;the Sidestrand [in formation] was a difficult proposition to tackle and that Fighters had no attack at present to meet them.&quot; 

The Squadron also experimented with &#x27;glide bombing&#x27; (possibly dive bombing) in January 1932, and during 1934 the Sidestrand showed itself capable of intensive night flying. 

Even with Jupiter VI engines, the aircraft could retain height on only one engine, turn in either direction and climb slowly (without bomb load). 

The maximum endurance was found to be 6 hours with a 1/2 hour reserve. 

The Sidestrand never equipped any other squadrons and 101 Squadron remained essentially an experimental unit used by the RAF to test the medium day bomber concept.

<doc id="959319" wikidata="Q2033612" url="?curid=959319" title="Petermann Island">
<text>Petermann Island () is an island long, lying southwest of Hovgaard Island in the Wilhelm Archipelago, Antarctica.
==Location==

Petermann Island is off the Graham Coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.
It is in the Wilhelm Archipelago, southwest of Hovgaard Island and Booth Island, east of the Vedel Islands and northeast of the French Passage.
It is northwest of Mount Shackleton on the mainland.

The island is long and across. 
It rises steeply to elevations of up to from a rocky coastline with raised pebble beaches. It has volcanic origins, with about half the land surface covered by a permanent, crevassed icecap. Ice-free areas have a sparse vegetation of mosses and lichens. 
The bedrock of the island is granodiorite.

==Important Bird Area==

The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a breeding colony of about 3,000 pairs of gentoo penguins. 
Other birds nesting at the site in smaller numbers include Adélie penguins, imperial shags, Wilson&#x27;s storm petrels and south polar skuas.

==Sailing directions==
The US Defense Mapping Agency&#x27;s &quot;Sailing Directions for Antarctica&quot; (1976) describes Petermann Island as follows:
==History==
Petermann Island was discovered by a German expedition 1873–74, and named by Eduard Dallmann for August Petermann, noted German geographer and founder of Petermanns Mitteilungen. 
The United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) has rejected the name Lund Island, applied by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition (BelgAE), 1897–99, in favor of the original naming.
The French Antarctic Expedition (FrAE) of 1908-10 under Jean-Baptiste Charcot wintered over aboard ship in a cove on the southeast side of the island, named Port Circumcision because it was spotted 1 January 1909, the traditional day for the Feast of the Circumcision.
Huts built by the expedition are gone, although a cairn remains, along with a refuge hut built by Argentina in 1955, and a cross commemorating three members of the British Antarctic Survey who died in a 1982 attempt to cross the sea ice from Petermann to Faraday Station.

===Megalestris Hill Cairn===

A cairn with a lead plaque was erected on Megalestris Hill in 1909. The original plaque has since been removed to the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris, but the cairn, with a replica plaque, has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 27), following a proposal by Argentina, France and the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

===Groussac Refuge===

Groussac Refuge () is an Argentine naval refuge (originally called Hippolyte Bouchard) in Antarctica, located on the southern coast of the Port Circumcision, on Petermann Island. The refuge was inaugurated on February 6, 1955, and is operated by the Argentine Navy and was occupied periodically by personnel of the British Antarctic Survey of the former Faraday Station.
The refuge is in the middle of a colony of Gentoo penguins. Its current name is in honour of Paul Groussac, a French writer and historian who lived in Argentina and authored a plea on the Argentine claim of the Malvinas Islands and biographies of Argentine national heroes.

== Features==

===Rouch Point===
A point forming the northwest end of Petermann Island. 
Charted by the FrAE, 1908–10, and named by Charcot for Jules Rouch, sub-lieutenant of the &quot;Pourquoi-Pas?&quot;, who was responsible for the study of meteorology, atmospheric electricity and oceanography on the expedition.

===Godfroy Point===
A point which marks the north extremity of Petermann Island. 
Discovered by the FrAE, 1908–10, and named by Charcot for René Godfrey, sub-lieutenant on the Pourquoi-Pas?, who was responsible for the expedition&#x27;s study of tides and the atmosphere.

===Liouville Point===
A point marking the northeast end of Petermann Island. 
Discovered by the FrAE, 1908–10, and named by Charcot for J. Liouville, assistant medical officer and zoologist of the expedition.

==Nearby features==
===Herald Reef===
A reef southwest of Petermann Island, lying on the north side of French Passage in the Wilhelm Archipelago.

<doc id="959333" wikidata="Q7742958" url="?curid=959333" title="The Jane Pauley Show">
<text>The Jane Pauley Show is an American syndicated talk show packaged by NBC Universal, hosted by veteran journalist Jane Pauley. The show premiered on August 30, 2004.

Pauley and other people involved with the show, before its premiere, were not aware of how she would adapt to the medium. Pauley has shown that she can handle serious interviews (from her experience on &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;), but it was not immediately evident if she could hold her own in a medium which is heavily laden with impersonality.

The show&#x27;s ratings were not impressive, and the show was canceled, with the final episode airing in May 2005.

The show was broadcast from Studio 8G in 30 Rockefeller Center, which had formerly housed a succession of syndicated talk shows including &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;, &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, and &quot;The Caroline Rhea Show&quot;. Studio 8G was also previously home to &quot;The Today Show&quot; for a period in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

<doc id="959341" wikidata="Q741873" url="?curid=959341" title="Christmas Humphreys">
<text>Travers Christmas Humphreys, QC (15 February 1901 – 13 April 1983) was a British jurist who prosecuted several controversial cases in the 1940s and 1950s, and who later became a judge at the Old Bailey. He also wrote a number of works on Mahayana Buddhism and in his day was the best-known British convert to Buddhism. In 1924 he founded what became the London Buddhist Society, which was to have a seminal influence on the growth of the Buddhist tradition in Britain. His former home in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, is now a Buddhist temple. He was an enthusiastic proponent of the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship.

==Early life==
Humphreys was born in Ealing, Middlesex, the son of Travers Humphreys, a noted barrister and judge. His given name &quot;Christmas&quot; is unusual, but, along with &quot;Travers&quot;, had a long history in the Humphreys family. Among friends and family he was generally known as &#x27;Toby&#x27;. The death of his elder brother during World War I shocked Humphreys into reflection about his beliefs, and at age 17 he found himself drawn to Buddhism. He was educated at Malvern College, where he first became a theosophist, and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

== Buddhism and Theosophy ==
In the early decades of the twentieth century, Humphreys had begun a broad reading in the available English-language literature on Eastern thought and Buddhism in particular. He was further influenced in this direction by public lectures presented by J.R. Pain (founder of the short-lived Buddhist Society of England) Charles Henry Allan Bennett (aka Ananda Metteya), and Francis Payne. In 1924, Humphreys founded the London Buddhist Lodge (later the Buddhist Society). The impetus came from several theosophists with whom Humphreys corresponded, chief among them being Annie Besant (President of the Theosophical Society, 1907–1933) and George S. Arundale (President, 1933–1947). Both at his home and at the lodge he played host to a variety of spiritual authorities and writers including Nicholas Roerich, Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, Alice Bailey and D. T. Suzuki. Other regular visitors in the 1930s were the Russian singer Vladimir Rosing and the philosopher Alan Watts. In 1931 Humphreys met the spiritual teacher Meher Baba. 

The Buddhist Society is one of the oldest Buddhist organisations outside Asia with Western founders.

In 1945, Humphreys drafted the Twelve Principles of Buddhism for which he obtained the approval of all the Buddhist sects in Japan (including the Shin Sect which was not associated with Olcott&#x27;s common platform), the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand, and leading Buddhists of Ceylon, Burma, China, and Tibet.

In the same year, Humphreys received the news of the death of one of his mentors, George Arundale. He later assembled and collated some of Arundale&#x27;s unpublished works, a collection of which he left to the Theosophical Society on his death in 1983.

==Legal career==
Humphreys was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1924. When first qualified, he tended to take criminal defence work, making use of his skills in cross-examination. In 1934, he was appointed Junior Treasury Counsel at the Central Criminal Court (&quot;the Old Bailey&quot;).

Humphreys became Recorder of Deal in 1942, a part-time judicial post. In the aftermath of World War II, he became an assistant prosecutor in the War Crimes trials held in Tokyo. In 1950 he was appointed Senior Treasury Counsel, in which role he led for the Crown in some of the causes célèbres of the era, including the cases of Craig &amp; Bentley and Ruth Ellis. It was he who secured the conviction of Timothy Evans for a murder later found to have been carried out by John Christie. All three cases played a part in the later abolition of capital punishment in the United Kingdom. 

At the 1950 trial of the nuclear spy Klaus Fuchs, Humphreys was the prosecuting counsel for the Attorney General. In 1955, he was made a Bencher of his Inn and the next year became Recorder of Guildford.

In 1962 Humphreys became a Commissioner at the Old Bailey. He was appointed an Additional Judge there in 1968 and served on the bench until his retirement in 1976. Increasingly he became willing to court controversy with his judicial pronouncements. In 1975, he passed a six-month suspended jail sentence on an 18-year-old man convicted of raping two women at knife-point. The leniency of the sentence created a public outcry. His sentence of a man to eighteen months in jail for a fraud shortly afterwards added to the controversy.

The Lord Chancellor defended Humphreys in the face of a House of Commons motion to dismiss him, and he also received support from the National Association of Probation Officers. However, pressure was put on him to resign, which he did some six months after the controversy.

==Literary and arts career==
Humphreys was a prolific author of books on the Buddhist tradition. He was also president of the Shakespeare Fellowship, a position to which he was elected in 1955. The Fellowship advanced the theory that the plays generally attributed to Shakespeare were in fact the work of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Under Humphreys the fellowship changed its name to the Shakespeare Authorship Society. He helped found the Ballet Guild in 1941 and acted as its chairman. 

In 1962 Humphreys was appointed Vice-President of the Tibet Society, and made Joint Vice-Chairman of the Royal India, Pakistan and Ceylon Society.

Humphreys published his autobiography &quot;Both Sides of the Circle&quot; in 1978. He also wrote poetry, especially verses inspired by his Buddhist beliefs, one of which posed the question: &quot;When I die, who dies?&quot;

== Death ==
Humphreys died of a heart attack at his London home, 58 Marlborough Place, St John&#x27;s Wood.

== In popular culture ==
Humphreys was portrayed on screen by Geoffrey Chater in the 1971 film &quot;10 Rillington Place&quot;, about the Evans–Christie murder case.
Humphreys appears in the lyrics of Van Morrison&#x27;s 1982 song &quot;Cleaning Windows&quot;, &quot;I went home and read my Christmas Humphreys book on Zen.&quot;

He was played by Peter Eyre in the film &quot;Let Him Have It&quot;.

<text>The Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890 is a reference book by Philip Rees, on leading people in the various far right movements since 1890.
It contains entries for what the author regards as &quot;the 500 major figures on the radical right, extreme right, and revolutionary right from 1890 to the present&quot; (publisher&#x27;s blurb).
It was published, as a 418-page hardcover, in New York by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1990 ().

In the introduction Rees discusses his criterion for inclusion in the book. He describes the extreme right as &quot;opposed to parliamentary forms of democratic representation and hostile to pluralism.&quot;(xvii)
Among those it covers are Argentinian nationalists, Mexican &quot;sinarquistas&quot;, American &quot;nativist&quot; &quot;demagogues&quot;, Brazilian &quot;Integralists&quot;, German &quot;National Socialists&quot;, Portuguese &quot;National Syndicalists&quot;, Spanish &quot;Falangists&quot;, and Belgian &quot;Rexists.&quot;

<text>Anthocharis cethura, the desert orangetip or Felder&#x27;s orangetip, is a species of butterfly in the subfamily Pierinae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it lives on hills and ridges in rocky desert habitat.

The male and female look similar. The wingspan is between . The wings are yellow with an orange patch toward the front of the forewing outlined in black and white. The edges of the wings are spotted with black. The underside of the hindwing has greenish bands.

The adults appear early in the spring. Males congregate in the midday sun to wait for females to emerge, and are more easily observed than females, which are active later in the day. The flight pattern is quick and erratic.

The female lays eggs singly on host plants. The conical eggs are blue green when fresh, then turn orange. During early stages the caterpillar is green with a purple stripe outlined in white. In its last instar it is white with mottled markings. The larvae feed mostly on plants of the mustard family. They have been noted on lyreleaf jewelflower (&quot;Streptanthus carinatus&quot;), London rocket (&quot;Sisymbrium irio&quot;), western tansymustard (&quot;Descurainia pinnata&quot;), sand fringepod (&quot;Thysanocarpus curvipes&quot;), and California mustard (&quot;Streptanthus lasiophyllus&quot;).

There are many subspecies. The subspecies &quot;A. c. catalina&quot; is endemic to Santa Catalina Island, California.

<text>Holes is a 1998 young adult novel written by Louis Sachar and first published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The book centers on Stanley Yelnats, who is sent to Camp Green Lake, a correctional boot camp in a desert in Texas, after being falsely accused of theft. The plot explores the history of the area and how the actions of several characters in the past have affected Stanley&#x27;s life in the present. These interconnecting stories touch on themes such as labor, boyhood and masculinity, friendship, meaning of names, illiteracy, elements of fairy tales, and racism.

The book was both a critical and commercial success. Much of the praise for the book has centered around its complex plot, interesting characters, and representation of people of color and incarcerated youth. It won the 1998 US National Book Award for Young People&#x27;s Literature and the 1999 Newbery Medal for the year&#x27;s &quot;most distinguished contribution to American literature for children&quot;. In 2012 it was ranked number six among all-time children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

&quot;Holes&quot; was adapted by Walt Disney Pictures as a feature film of the same name released in 2003. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, was commercially successful, and was released in conjunction with the book companion &quot;Stanley Yelnats&#x27; Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake&quot;. A spin-off sequel to &quot;Holes&quot; entitled &quot;Small Steps&quot; was published in 2006 and centers on one of the secondary characters in the novel, Theodore &quot;Armpit&quot; Johnson. A female-lead television adaptation is in development for Disney+.

== Background ==
&quot;Holes&quot; is one of 42 books written by Louis Sachar, most of which are classified as children&#x27;s literature. The novel is categorized as young adult literature but has also been labeled as realistic fiction, a tall tale, a folk tale, a fairy tale, a children&#x27;s story, a postmodern novel, detective fiction, and a historical legend. &quot;Holes&quot; is considered an outlier of all Sachar&#x27;s published books, for its complex plot, character development, and elements of teen angst and mystery. Sachar says he &quot;never intended to write a grim story&quot; and instead &quot;wanted it to be fun and adventurous&quot;. The narrative of &quot;Holes&quot; is generally linear but also resembles multi-spatial and multidirectional narratives, similar to features of postmodernism literature. &quot;Holes&quot; was inspired by Sachar&#x27;s dislike for the heat in Austin, Texas, the home state of his family.

==Plot==
Stanley Yelnats IV is wrongfully convicted of theft and is consequentially sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility. The novel presents Stanley&#x27;s story together with two other linked stories.

=== Elya Yelnats ===
Elya Yelnats is 15 years old and lives in Latvia. He is in love with Myra Menke, the most beautiful girl in the village. Myra&#x27;s father has decided she should marry when she turns fifteen in two months. 57-year-old Igor Barkov offers his fattest pig to Myra&#x27;s father in exchange for her hand so Elya asks his friend Madame Zeroni, an old Egyptian fortune teller with a missing foot, for help. She warns him that Myra is an empty-headed girl, but gives him a piglet and tells him to carry it to the top of the mountain every day and sing a special song while it drinks from a stream that runs uphill. If he does this, according to Madame Zeroni, his pig will be fatter than any of Igor&#x27;s. In return, she requests that Elya carry her up the mountain. She warns him that if he does not, his family will be cursed.

Elya follows Madame Zeroni&#x27;s directions until the last day, when he takes a bath instead of carrying the pig up the hill. His pig and Igor&#x27;s weigh exactly the same, so Myra&#x27;s father lets her decide whom to marry. When Myra is unable to choose, Elya realizes Madame Zeroni was right about Myra. He tells her to marry Igor and keep his pig and, forgetting his promise to Madame Zeroni, leaves for America. There, he marries the kind and intelligent Sarah Miller but is continually beset by bad luck. The song that he sang to the pig becomes a lullaby passed down by his family.

=== Kissin&#x27; Kate Barlow ===
In the year 1888, Green Lake is a flourishing Texas lakeside village. Katherine Barlow, a local schoolteacher famous for her spiced peaches, falls in love with Sam, an African-American onion farmer. She rejects the advances of Charles Walker, the richest man in town, who is nicknamed &quot;Trout&quot; because his feet smell like dead fish. After Katherine and Sam are seen kissing, Trout raises a mob to burn down the schoolhouse. Katherine goes to the sheriff for help, but he refuses to help her and instead demands a kiss. Katherine and Sam attempt to escape across the lake in Sam&#x27;s rowboat, but Trout intercepts them with his motorboat. He shoots Sam dead and wrecks his boat, while Katherine is &quot;rescued&quot; against her wishes. From that day on, no rain falls upon Green Lake.

Three days later, Katherine shoots and kills the sheriff. She becomes the outlaw &quot;Kissin&#x27; Kate Barlow&quot;, so named because she leaves a red lipstick kiss on the cheeks of the men she kills. She robs Stanley Yelnats I, son of Elya Yelnats, and leaves him stranded in the desert. Seventeen days later, he is rescued by hunters, but he is delirious and can only explain his survival by saying he &quot;found refuge on God&#x27;s thumb&quot;.

After twenty years, Katherine retires to the ruins of Green Lake, now a dry and lifeless wasteland. She is confronted by Trout and his wife, now destitute, who demand that she reveal the location of her hidden loot. Katherine refuses, telling them that their descendants could dig holes for the next hundred years without finding it. She lets herself be bitten by a highly venomous yellow-spotted lizard, and dies laughing.

=== Camp Green Lake ===
Stanley Yelnats IV&#x27;s family is cursed, jokingly always blaming Stanley&#x27;s &quot;no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather&quot; Elya for their constant misfortunes. Stanley, who is in middle school, is convicted of stealing a pair of athletic shoes that baseball player Clyde &quot;Sweet Feet&quot; Livingston had donated to a charity auction for the homeless and is sentenced to 18 months at Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility.

Prisoners at Camp Green Lake are required to &quot;build character&quot; by digging one cylindrical hole five feet wide and five feet deep every day. The Warden allows campers a day off if they find anything &quot;interesting&quot;. The leader of Stanley&#x27;s group, a boy nicknamed X-Ray, tells Stanley to give him anything interesting he finds. Late one day, Stanley finds an empty lipstick tube with &quot;KB&quot; engraved on it. He gives it to X-Ray, who pretends to find it the next morning. For the next week and a half, the Warden has the boys excavate the area of X-Ray&#x27;s supposed discovery. Stanley concludes that she is searching for something.

Stanley learns that another prisoner, Zero, is illiterate. Zero volunteers to dig part of Stanley&#x27;s hole each day if Stanley teaches him to read. When one of the counselors, Mr. Pendanski, says that Zero is too stupid to learn to read, Zero smashes Mr. Pendanski&#x27;s face with his shovel and flees into the desert. When Zero does not return, the Warden assumes he has died. To avoid an investigation, she orders Mr. Pendanski to destroy Zero&#x27;s records.

Stanley goes into the desert to save Zero. He finds Zero hiding under the wreck of a rowboat. Zero has survived on what he calls &quot;sploosh&quot;, a peachy nectar stored in old jars he found under the boat. Stanley and Zero drink the last of the sploosh. Zero refuses to return to camp, so they head for a nearby mountain, Big Thumb, that looks like a thumbs up sign. As they ascend the mountain, Zero collapses due to exhaustion. Stanley carries Zero up the hill. He finds water, gives it to Zero, and sings his family lullaby.

Stanley and Zero live on Big Thumb for a week, eating wild onions from Sam&#x27;s old onion fields. Zero, whose real name is Hector Zeroni, reveals that he stole Clyde Livingston&#x27;s shoes. He was homeless and needed new shoes. When he realized everyone was making a commotion about the missing shoes, he discarded them by putting them on the roof of a moving car, and they accidentally landed on Stanley.

The boys secretly return to Camp Green Lake, and overnight, they dig where Stanley found the lipstick tube. They find a suitcase but are caught by the camp staff. The Warden, Mr. Sir, and the counselors stand watch over the boys all night, but they do not approach because the boys are in a nest of highly venomous yellow-spotted lizards. Stanley and Zero, however, are safe from the lizards because they smell like onions (which the lizards are known to avoid). When the sun rises, Stanley&#x27;s lawyer Ms. Morengo and the state attorney general arrive; Stanley&#x27;s conviction has been overturned. The Warden claims that the suitcase was stolen from her, but the suitcase has &quot;Stanley Yelnats&quot; written on it. Stanley refuses to leave without Hector, so Ms. Morengo asks to see Hector&#x27;s file. When Hector&#x27;s records are unable to be found, Ms. Morengo demands that he be released too. As they drive away, rain falls on Camp Green Lake for the first time in 110 years.

The attorney general closes Camp Green Lake. The Warden, whose real name is Ms. Walker, is forced to sell the land.

Hector is revealed to be Madame Zeroni&#x27;s great-great-great-grandson. The day after Stanley carried Hector up the mountain, Stanley&#x27;s father invented a peach-scented product that eliminated foot odor; the boys name it &quot;Sploosh&quot;. The suitcase, which had belonged to Stanley&#x27;s great-grandfather, contains financial instruments worth nearly two million dollars. Stanley and Hector split the money, and Hector hires private investigators to find his mother. A year and a half later, the Yelnats house hosts a Super Bowl party celebrating Clyde Livingston&#x27;s endorsement of Sploosh. Hector&#x27;s mother softly sings to him a second verse to the Yelnats&#x27; family lullaby.

==Characters==
===Camp Green Lake===
*Stanley Yelnats IV (also known as &quot;Caveman&quot; by the rest of the campers): Stanley is a 14-year-old boy who does not have any friends and is often picked on by his classmates and bullied due to his size. Stanley&#x27;s family is cursed with bad luck, and although they do not have much money, they always try to remain hopeful and look on the bright side of things. Stanley shares these traits with his family and, although he does not have a lot of self-confidence, he is not easily depressed, a characteristic that helps him adjust to the horrendous conditions of Camp Green Lake. However, he has a bad habit of blaming his great-great-grandfather when he gets in trouble. This habit made him impudent. As the book progresses, Stanley slowly gains strength. He identifies the people who threaten him, like the Warden. While he tries not to get in trouble, he also stands up for himself and his friends and family. Stanley rebels for the rights of his friends when he steals Mr. Sir&#x27;s truck to look for Zero in the dry lake bed.

*Zero (Hector Zeroni): Zero is known to be the best digger and is the smallest and youngest inmate at Camp Green Lake. He is considered to be stupid by the other boys and the counselors alike since he doesn&#x27;t often speak due to the fact that he is wary of those who mock him. He is said to always have a scowl on his face and does not like to answer questions. He lacks an education, meaning he&#x27;s unable to read or write. Despite this, he is intelligent and manages to stand up for himself in the face of adversity, breaking Mr. Pendanski&#x27;s nose with a shovel after one too many snide remarks. Zero is shown to be an honest character after becoming close friends with Stanley. Zero is the one who stole the shoes that Stanley was arrested for and accused of stealing. He is the descendant of Madame Zeroni, the woman who put a curse on Stanley&#x27;s family. He has been homeless for most of his life, as well as abandoned by his mother at a very young age. Although he suffers quite a bit, he always seems to persevere and come out on top.

*X-Ray (Rex Washburn): X-Ray is the unofficial head of the boys in Group D, who was sent to Camp Green Lake after he was caught selling dried herbs to people who thought they were buying marijuana (as revealed in the spin-off novel &quot;Small Steps&quot;). His nickname X-ray comes from it being pig Latin of his actual name, Rex. X-Ray maintains his position as the leader of the boys even though he is one of the smallest and can barely see without his glasses. X-Ray is able to maintain his position at the head of the group through a system of rewards and allies. Every time Stanley does something nice for X-Ray, X-Ray rewards Stanley. He stands up for Stanley when the other boys pick on him (i.e, X-Ray decides Stanley will be called &quot;Caveman&quot; and moves him up one in the line for water). When Stanley becomes friends with Zero, however, X-Ray&#x27;s hierarchy is threatened and he becomes hostile toward Stanley.

*Squid (Alan): Squid is a member of Group D at Camp Green Lake. Often, he taunts Stanley for sending and receiving letters to and from his mother. Squid is very tough but subservient to X-Ray&#x27;s rules. He is revealed to have a sensitive side to him, however, when Stanley wakes to hear him crying one night. Alan later asks Stanley to write to his (Alan&#x27;s) mother when Stanley leaves Camp Green Lake.

*Armpit (Theodore Thomas Johnson): A member of Group D. Like the other boys Armpit is rough, shoving Stanley to the ground when he calls him Theodore. However, in the &quot;Holes&quot; spin-off novel &quot;Little Steps&quot; he is shown to be hardworking and caring. His nickname Armpit is due to him being stung by a scorpion at camp and the venom traveling up into his armpit, causing him to complain about his armpit hurting. 

*Magnet (José): Another member of Group D. Magnet earned his nickname because of his ability to steal, he got sent to Camp Green Lake for stealing animals from the zoo and refers to his fingers as &quot;little magnets.&quot;

*ZigZag (Ricky): Described as being the tallest kid of Group D, constantly looking like he has been electrocuted, with frizzy hair. Stanley often thinks he is the strangest camper at Camp Green Lake. Zigzag hits Stanley on the head with a shovel, but later apologizes. Zigzag suffers from paranoia, highlighting his displayed &quot;craziness&quot;.

* Twitch (Brian): A car thief who arrives at camp after Zero runs away. He got his nickname for his constant twitching.

*Warden Walker: Running Camp Green Lake, she is soft-spoken but intimidating. Known to be violent and abusive, she uses her power and privilege to get what she wants and make members of the camp do as she pleases. She is often thought to have hidden cameras to spy on the campers, including in the showers, causing Stanley to be paranoid whenever he takes a shower. She wears nail polish laced with rattlesnake venom, and scratches those who displease or go against what she says. She has the members of Camp Green Lake digging holes to look for Kate Barlow&#x27;s hidden treasure. She is the granddaughter of Trout Walker. Her family had been digging the treasure out since her birth, but to no success. She is known for her catchphrase, &quot;excuse me?&quot;

*Mr. Sir: The overseer/head counselor at Camp Green Lake, below only the warden. He is constantly eating sunflower seeds after quitting smoking. He is rough, tough, and tyrannical, embracing his meanness and enjoying asserting his power over the boys. However, his cowardly nature is revealed when he encounters his biggest fear, yellow-spotted lizards. He also watches his words around the warden, the only person more powerful than him. While his backstory is never told in the book, his true identity is revealed in the film as a paroled criminal named Marion Seville, who was arrested for an unknown crime in El Paso, and later violated his parole by carrying a gun.

*Mr. Pendanski: Mr. Pendanski is the counselor in charge of group D at Camp Green Lake. Mr. Pendanski has a generally friendly demeanor, yet is just as cruel as the Warden and Mr. Sir. His darker side comes out in his frequent mistreatment of Zero, as well as in his callous lack of concern when Stanley and Zero are covered in deadly yellow-spotted lizards. Zero attacks Mr. Pendanski with a shovel. In the film, he is addressed as &quot;Dr. Pendanski,&quot; though he is revealed not to be a real doctor.

===Town of Green Lake===
* Katherine Barlow (Kissin&#x27; Kate Barlow): Katherine Barlow is a sweet and intelligent woman who teaches in a one-room school house on Green Lake one hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake. She falls in love with Sam, an African American man who sells onions in the town. Although the rest of the white people in the town are racist and enforce rules that prohibit African American people from going to school, Kate, who is white, does not care about the color of a person&#x27;s skin and she loves Sam for the person that he is. When Kate and Sam kiss, the angry townsfolk kill Sam and destroy her schoolhouse. Kate is devastated by Sam&#x27;s death and becomes Kissin&#x27; Kate Barlow, one of the most feared outlaws in the West. She leaves her mark by kissing the bodies of the men she killed; if she had only robbed them, she would leave them in the hot desert. She is the outlaw responsible for robbing Stanley Yelnats I (Stanley&#x27;s ancestor). After she is confronted by Charles &quot;Trout&quot; Walker and his wife Linda, who demand to know the location of her buried loot, Kate is bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard, and dies laughing, knowing the Walkers will never find her treasure. The lipstick tube that Stanley finds during his second week at Camp Green Lake was owned by Kate.

*Sam: Sam is an African-American farmer in the town Green Lake, Texas who grows onions. He believes onions are the cure to everything and makes many remedies from onions. He also has an immense love for his donkey, Mary Lou. His relationship with Kate begins when he exchanges his onions for her jars of spiced peaches. He is shot in cold blood by Charles &quot;Trout&quot; Walker when Sam and Kate try to escape. His death is implied to have set a curse upon the lake, causing the rain to stop coming and the lake to dry up.

*Charles &quot;Trout&quot; Walker: Charles &quot;Trout&quot; Walker is an extremely spoiled son of the richest family in Green Lake. He gets upset when Kate denies his request to date her. This adds on to the reason of him leading the townspeople to burn down the schoolhouse and kill Sam. His nickname Trout comes from his foot fungus that causes his feet to smell like dead fish. After Kate leaves to become an outlaw, he marries Linda Miller but his family loses everything when the lake dries up. He is the Warden&#x27;s grandfather, who, upon his death, opens up the juvenile detention camp to increase the efficiency of finding Kate Barlow&#x27;s hidden treasure.

*Stanley Yelnats I: Stanley Yelnats I is the son of Elya Yelnats as well as the great-grandfather of Stanley Yelnats IV. He had his treasure stolen by Kate Barlow while he was moving from New York to California. He is known to have survived by climbing to the top of a thumb-shaped mountain (God&#x27;s Thumb) which happens to be Sam&#x27;s old onion field.

===Mid-1800s Latvia===
*Elya Yelnats: Elya is the great-great-grandfather of Stanley. He is often referred to as his &quot;No-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather&quot;, constantly being blamed for everything that goes wrong in Stanley&#x27;s life. He is considered to be the reason why the Yelnats family has such bad luck. As he sets off for America, he forgets to fulfill the promise he made to an old woman named Madame Zeroni. This causes generations of bad luck to trickle down the Yelnats family tree. However, he does pass down an important song that Madame Zeroni taught him in Latvia that breaks the curse.

*Madame Zeroni: Madame Zeroni is the great-great-great-grandmother of Hector Zeroni (Zero). She is great friends with Elya Yelnats, and she gives him a pig to help him marry Myra Menke. Because Elya breaks his promise of carrying her to the top of the mountain, she is considered to be the one who put a &quot;curse&quot; on the Yelnats family.

*Myra Menke: Myra is the most beautiful girl in the Latvian village Elya lives in. Madame Zeroni considers her inadequate and her head as empty as a flowerpot. Myra&#x27;s father promises to award her hand in marriage to whichever suitor can raise the fattest pig. When the pigs offered are the same size, Myra asks Elya and Igor Barkov to guess a number between 1 and 10, showing her inability to make her own decisions. Upon realizing this, Elya allows Myra to marry Igor.

*Igor Barkov: Igor is Elya&#x27;s competitor for the hand of Myra Menke. He is an old, fat successful pig farmer.

===Minor characters===
*Mr. Yelnats (Stanley Yelnats III): Mr. Yelnats is Stanley&#x27;s father. He is an inventor and quite smart, but extremely unlucky. He attempts to discover a way to recycle old sneakers and because of this, the Yelnats&#x27; apartment smells bad. However, he eventually discovers a cure to ridding foot odor and is able to hire a lawyer, Ms. Morengo, to get Stanley out of Camp Green Lake.
*Mrs. Yelnats: Mrs. Yelnats is Stanley&#x27;s mother. She does not believe in curses but always points out the terrible luck that the Yelnats have.
*Barf Bag (Lewis): A &quot;camper&quot; who left Camp Green Lake before Stanley arrived. He deliberately got a rattlesnake to bite him in order to be hospitalized.
*Clyde &quot;Sweet Feet&quot; Livingston: A famous baseball player whose shoes Stanley is accused of stealing. He has the same foot fungus as Trout Walker, and later endorses Mr. Yelnats&#x27; Sploosh foot odor cure.

==Setting==
The majority of the book takes place in Camp Green Lake, a dried-up lake located in the US state of Texas. Camp Green Lake is a correctional boot camp, where &quot;campers&quot; spend most of their time digging holes. The name is a misnomer, as the area is a parched, barren desert. The only weather is the scorching sun. No rain has fallen since the day Sam was murdered. The only plants mentioned are two oak trees in front of the Warden&#x27;s cabin; the book notes that &quot;the Warden owns the shade.&quot; The abandoned town of Green Lake is located by the side of the lakebed. The majority of the book alternates between the present day story of Stanley Yelnats, the story of Elya Yelnats in Latvia (ca. mid-19th century) and the story of Katherine Barlow in the town of Green Lake in the 1880s. Later chapters focus less on the past stories and more on the present.

== Themes ==

=== Fairy tales ===
The themes typical of a folk or fairy tale are present throughout the novel, notable in both Stanley and Elya&#x27;s narratives. Elya must go on an adventure to win his love&#x27;s approval and prove his own worth and he is eventually placed under a witch&#x27;s curse. Stanley&#x27;s bad luck is blamed on the curse left on his great-great-grandfather and the Yelnats family easily believes in the power of this curse. Both Stanley and Elya are similar to fairy tale characters and are morally good, heroic protagonists who must overcome the challenges predestined for them. Both story lines are accompanied by a magic that is seen in the mountain stream, Madame Zeroni&#x27;s song, and the healing power of the onions. Each of these elements in &quot;Holes&quot; mirror elements frequently found in fairy tales.

=== Names ===
Throughout the novel, names act as a theme that allows the characters to disassociate their lives at Camp Green Lake from their lives back in the real world. Names also demonstrate irony—Camp Green Lake is not actually a camp, it is located in a desert, and there is no lake. The &quot;campers&quot; all label themselves differently and identify with names such as Armpit and X-Ray and the guards are referred to as counselors. One of the counselors, Mr. Pendanski, is referred to by the boys as &quot;Mom,&quot; representing the absent parents at Camp Green Lake. Only the woman in charge is referred to in a prison-like way and is called &quot;Warden&quot;. The different names allow the boys to bond and form a team based in their hatred for their work and the counselors. Many of the characters also have names that connect them to their family history, like the passing down of &quot;Stanley Yelnats&quot; and Zero&#x27;s last name of Zeroni, and remind them how the actions of their ancestors affect their modern-day lives. Stanley is the fourth Stanley Yelnats in his family, a name that is passed down due to its palindromic nature and adds to the connection to family history. In an interview, when asked about the significance of specific names in his novels, Louis Sachar says “when I get to naming characters, there&#x27;s nothing leading up to it...a name is just a name.” He typically writes a name for a character, and moves on, because otherwise it disrupts his flow of writing.

===Labor===
Labor is seen throughout the novel as the children are forced to dig holes while at Camp Green Lake. This theme is unusual in children&#x27;s literature as many authors portray children as carefree and without responsibility. If they do engage in work, it is synonymous with play. Critic Maria Nikolajeva contends that &quot;Holes&quot; is set apart through the not just manual, but forced labor Stanley and the other campers do daily. This is first referenced at the beginning of the book when the purpose of the camp is stated: &quot;If you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy.&quot;

=== Masculinity ===
Masculinity is seen in the novel through the depiction of &quot;boyhood&quot; and coming of age. Boyhood is portrayed as the separation and distancing from all things feminine, specifically a mother figure. Traits, symbols, and characters resembling femininity in &quot;Holes&quot; are portrayed as frightening and threatening, particularly represented by the only known female at the camp: the Warden. There are many instances of quotes and comments by characters within the novel labeling women and girls as being either incapable or undesirable, which was viewed as unacceptable. Particularly, Mr. Sir says &quot;You are not in Girl Scouts anymore&quot; implying that girls are unable to do physical labor or build character unlike their counterparts.

=== Friendship ===
Friendship is seen throughout the novel through Stanley Yelnats&#x27; relationships with the other boys at Camp Green Lake. Particularly Stanley and Zero&#x27;s friendship roots from an agreement that both boys can benefit from: Stanley teaches Zero to read and write, and Zero digs some of Stanley&#x27;s holes. Many of the boys at the camp have a strong loyalty to each other and it is indicated that after their departure from the camp, they remained friends.

=== Racism ===
&quot;Holes&quot; portrays various forms of racism and institutional discrimination. The book depicts the lynching of a southern black man by a mob of white people, echoing the overt acts of violence committed by white people against communities of color during the 19th century. The curse Green Lake inherits after Sam&#x27;s death allude to the lasting trauma inflicted by racial violence.

At Camp Green Lake the majority of the inmate characters are young men of color. The disproportionate representation of racial minorities in the camp is a product of the racial bias present in the American legal system. Although the camp portrays itself as an ethical alternative to juvenile detention, its &quot;counselors&quot; function as prison guards and the institution is directed by a woman known within the facility as the &quot;Warden.&quot; The adults at the camp are regularly physically violent and verbally abusive to the campers. The campers&#x27; task to dig holes every day under inhumane working conditions alludes to the continued practice of unpaid prison labor. The campers are made to stay in poor living conditions. They lack indoor plumbing, reasonable medical care, and are given limited ration of drinking water while they work. The adversity and cruelty perpetuated by the camp reflects the institutional discrimination present in the American prison system.

&quot;Holes,&quot; considered the most complex of Louis Sachar&#x27;s published books, is often praised for its complex plot, character development, and suspense. Over two decades after its original publication, &quot;Holes&quot; continues to be well received by critics and was ranked number 6 among all-time children&#x27;s novels by &quot;School Library Journal&quot; in 2012. The novel spent over 150 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List, reaching #1 for Young Adult fiction. 

Betsy Hearne of &quot;The New York Times&quot; applauded the novel&#x27;s integration of mystery and humor that manages to keep &quot;Holes&quot; light and fresh, and she characterizes it as a &quot;family read-aloud.&quot; Roger Sutton of &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot; called Sachar&#x27;s declarative style effective, and argues that it helped make the novel more poignant. Sutton appreciated the positive ending and the suspense that leads the reader to it.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
In 2003, Walt Disney Pictures released a film version of &quot;Holes&quot;, which was directed by Andrew Davis and written by Louis Sachar; the latter also has a cameo in the film.

===Television===
In April 2023, producer Mike Medavoy told &quot;Collider&quot; that Disney might be considering adapting &quot;Holes&quot; as a television series, adding, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a tribute to the material and a tribute to the people who made it.&quot; On January 7, 2025, it was announced that Disney+ had ordered a pilot for a female-lead &quot;Holes&quot; television series, with Alina Mankin writing and Liz Pheng serving as showrunner. Jac Schaeffer will direct the pilot.

==Sequels==
Two companion novels have followed &quot;Holes&quot;: &quot;Stanley Yelnats&#x27; Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake&quot; (2003) and &quot;Small Steps&quot; (2006).

===&quot;Stanley Yelnats&#x27;s Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake&quot;===

As Louis Sachar states: &quot;Should you ever find yourself at Camp Green Lake—or somewhere similar—this is the guide for you.&quot; Written from Stanley&#x27;s point of view, the book offers advice on everything from scorpions, rattlesnakes, yellow-spotted lizards, etc.

===&quot;Small Steps&quot;===

In this sequel to &quot;Holes&quot;, former camper Armpit is now 17 and struggling with the challenges facing an African American teenager with a criminal history. A new friendship with Ginny, who has cerebral palsy, a reunion with former friend X-Ray, a ticket-scalping scheme, a beautiful pop singer, and a frame-up all test Armpit&#x27;s resolve to &quot;Just take small steps and keep moving forward&quot;.

<text>Jianzhen (688–763), also known by his Japanese name Ganjin, was a Tang Chinese monk or Silla Korean of Yanju who helped to propagate Buddhism in Japan. In the eleven years from 743 to 754, Jianzhen attempted to visit Japan some six times, arriving in the year 753 and founding Tōshōdai-ji in Nara. When he finally succeeded on his sixth attempt, he had lost his eyesight as a result of an infection acquired during his journeys. Jianzhen&#x27;s life story and voyage are described in the scroll, &quot;The Sea Journey to the East of a Great Bonze from the Tang Dynasty.&quot;

==Life==
Jianzhen was born in Jiangyin county in Guangling Prefecture (present day Yangzhou), China, with the surname of Chunyu (). At the age of fourteen, he became a disciple of Dayun Temple (). At twenty he travelled to Chang&#x27;an for study and returned six years later, eventually becoming abbot of Daming Temple. Besides his learning in the Tripiṭaka, Jianzhen is also said to have been an expert in medicine. He opened the Buddhist temple as a place of healing, creating the Beitian Court (悲田院)—a hospital within Daming Temple.

In autumn 742, an emissary from Japan invited Jianzhen to lecture in Japan. Despite protests from his disciples, Jianzhen made preparations and in spring 743 was ready for the long voyage across the East China Sea to Japan. The crossing failed and in the following years, Jianzhen made three more attempts but was thwarted by unfavourable conditions or government intervention.

In summer 748, Jianzhen made his fifth attempt to reach Japan. Leaving from Yangzhou, he made it to the Zhoushan Archipelago off the coast of modern Zhejiang. But the ship was blown off course and ended up in the Yande (延德) commandery on Hainan Island. Jianzhen was then forced to make his way back to Yangzhou by land, lecturing at a number of monasteries on the way. Jianzhen travelled along the Gan River to Jiujiang, and then down the Yangtze River. The entire failed enterprise took him close to three years. By the time Jianzhen returned to Yangzhou, he was blind from an infection.

In the autumn of 753, the blind Jianzhen decided to join a Japanese emissary ship returning to its home country. After an eventful sea journey of several months, the group finally landed at Kagoshima, Kyūshū, on December 20. They reached Nara in the spring of the next year and were welcomed by the Emperor. At Nara, Jianzhen presided over Tōdai-ji. The Chinese monks who travelled with him introduced Chinese religious sculpture to the Japanese. In 755, the first ordination platform in Japan was constructed at Tōdai-ji, on the place where including former Emperor Shōmu and Empress Kōmyō received ordination by Jianzhen a year earlier. In 759 he retired to a piece of land granted to him by the imperial court in the western part of Nara. There he founded a school and also set up a private temple, Tōshōdai-ji. In the ten years until his death in Japan, Jianzhen not only propagated the Buddhist faith among the aristocracy, but also served as an important conductor of Chinese culture.

Jianzhen died on the 6th day of the 5th month of 763.

==Legacy==
Jianzhen is credited with the introduction of the Ritsu school of Buddhism to Japan, which focused on the &quot;vinaya&quot;, or Buddhist monastic rules.

A dry-lacquer statue of the monk made shortly after his death can still occasionally be seen at Tōshōdai-ji. Recognised as one of the greatest of its type, it has been postulated by statue restoration experts that the statue incorporates linen clothing originally worn by Ganjin. The statue is made public only during a limited number of days around the anniversary of Jianzhen&#x27;s death. For example, it was exhibited from June 2nd to 10th in 2007. The statue was temporarily brought to Jianzhen&#x27;s original temple in Yangzhou in 1980 as part of a long-planned friendship exchange between Japan and China. In preparation, the Chinese dredged the entire Slender West Lake leading up to the temple from the old city center and rehabilitated Buddhist temples and other sites around the area.

<text>George French Angas (25 April 1822 – 4 October 1886), also known as G.F.A., was an English explorer, naturalist, painter and poet who emigrated to Australia. His paintings are held in a number of important Australian public art collections. He was the eldest son of George Fife Angas, who was prominent in the early days of the colonisation of South Australia.

==Biography==

He was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, the eldest son of George Fife Angas, prominent in the establishment of the new colony of South Australia. Despite showing remarkable talent in drawing, he was placed in a London business house by his father. He left on a tour of Europe and in 1842 published his first book, &quot;Rambles in Malta and Sicily&quot;. As a result of this experience, he turned his back on the world of commerce, and directed his training towards a study of natural history, anatomical drawing and lithography. Embarking on his travels, he was soon to find his acquired skills extremely useful.

Angas painted some of the earliest views of South Australia. Arriving in Adelaide in January 1844, he joined Sir George Grey on an expedition into the interior. He soon began an extensive series of journeys to the Murray River lakes, Barossa Valley, Fleurieu Peninsula and the South East, presenting his impressions of the newly established colony – its inhabitants, landscape, and its flora and fauna (flowers, plants and stuff). Following a trip to New Zealand he returned to South Australia in 1845 and travelled to Port Lincoln. In the following year, 1846, he returned for a short while to England, accompanied by a young Māori man, Hemi Pomara, who was exhibited alongside Angas&#x27;s paintings at the Egyptian Hall in London.

Angas&#x27; next journey in 1846 was to South Africa, where he spent two years in Natal and the Cape, working on a series of drawings and watercolours which were published in 1849 as &quot;The Kafirs Illustrated&quot;. In this book were views of Cape Town, Durban, Wynberg, Genadendal, Paarl and Somerset West, and plates depicting the local ethnic groups such as the Khoikhoi (then referred to as Hottentots), Cape Malays and Zulus.

Angas married Alicia Mary Moran in 1849, the marriage producing four daughters.

In 1853 Angas was appointed to a position at the Australian Museum in Sydney, eventually becoming Director and staying a total of seven years. Angas was in Sydney when gold was first discovered near Bathurst, New South Wales. Travelling there to record the gold diggings he executed a number of drawings of the scenes that he found. These were published in Sydney and subsequently in London. Angas was represented at the 1855 Paris exposition with five other Australian artists including Conrad Martens, Frederick Terry and Adelaide Ironside, the first time Australian artists had been represented at a major overseas display. Angas returned to South Australia in 1860, and finally went back to England in 1863. Angas published several books on Australia and Polynesia as well as illustrating accounts of exploration by John McDouall Stuart and John Forrest, and contributed significantly to conchology with his descriptions and illustrations.

Angas died in London on 8 October 1886.

==Collections and legacy==
The African antelope, nyala (&quot;Tragelaphus angasii&quot;), was named &quot;angasii&quot; in his honour.

Many of Angas&#x27;s original watercolours are held in National Library of Australia, as well as in a number of South Australian institutions: Art Gallery of South Australia; University of Adelaide; South Australian Museum; and Royal Geographical Society of South Australia. The State Library of New South Wales has four letters written by Angas – the first is addressed to his publisher, Joseph Hogarth, and is dated 31 January 1848, requesting that two drawings be released to the lithographer James William Giles (1801–1870), and for an advance in payment. The second, dated 28 July 1849 discusses problems experienced by overseas subscribers in the delivery of &quot;Kafirs Illustrated&quot;. The third letter instructs the publisher to send a plate from his sister&#x27;s copy of &quot;Kafirs&quot; to the bookbinder, Mr Proudfoot, in George Street. The final, dated 10 February 1875 is addressed to Stephen William Silver (1819–1905), the London shipping merchant and book collector, and deals with matters relating to the Zoological Society and the Royal Geographical Society.

From August to late November 2020, the State Library of South Australia exhibited his 1848 folio &quot;South Australia illustrated&quot;, which is also available online.

<text>Universal Television LLC (abbreviated as UTV) is an American television production company that is a division of Universal Studio Group, a division of NBCUniversal, which, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast. It serves as the network television production arm of NBC; a predecessor of the company, NBC Studios, previously assumed such functions, and a substantial portion of the company&#x27;s shows air on the network.

It was formerly known by various names, including Revue Studios, Universal Pictures Television Department, Universal-International Television, Studios USA Television LLC, Universal Studios Network Programming, Universal Network Television, Universal Domestic Television, NBC Universal Television Studio, and Universal Media Studios. It is also known as Open 4 Business Productions in copyright in certain television series produced by them since 2009. Re-established in 2004, both NBC Studios and the original Universal Television are predecessors of the current Universal Television, formerly known as NBC Universal Television Studio and Universal Media Studios.

==History==

===Revue Studios===
Revue Studios (first known as Revue Productions Inc.) was founded in 1943 by MCA Inc. to produce live radio shows; it also produced &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; live events for the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II until it ended in 1945. Revue was re-launched as MCA&#x27;s television production subsidiary in 1950. The partnership of NBC and Revue extends as far back as September 6, 1950, with the television broadcast of the anthology series &quot;Stars Over Hollywood&quot; (also known as &quot;Armour Theatre&quot;), based on radio&#x27;s &quot;Stars over Hollywood&quot;.

During the early years of television, Revue was responsible for producing and distributing many television programs. These included &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, which ran for only one season on CBS before going to ABC from 1958 until 1963. In addition, Revue also made Alan Hale Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Biff Baker, U.S.A.&quot; (1952–1953) and all three of Rod Cameron&#x27;s syndicated series, &quot;City Detective&quot; (1953–1955), &quot;State Trooper&quot; (1956–1959), and &quot;Coronado 9&quot; (1960–1961) and the Bill Williams Western series, &quot;The Adventures of Kit Carson&quot; (1951–1955). It produced &quot;Bachelor Father&quot; (1957–1962), for &quot;Bachelor Productions&quot;, Edmond O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s syndicated crime film &quot;Johnny Midnight&quot;, based on a fictitious New York City actor-turned-private investigator.

Revue also produced the 52-episode &quot;Crusader&quot;, the first Brian Keith series, which aired on CBS from 1955 to 1956. Another western produced by Revue and starring Audie Murphy was &quot;Whispering Smith&quot;, which aired on NBC in 1961 and was based on the 1948 Alan Ladd movie of the same name. &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; was produced first by George Gobel&#x27;s Gomalco Productions, then by Kayro Productions on a back lot at Revue Studios from 1958 to 1963. The ABC sitcom &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; was also produced by Revue from 1962 to 1966.

In December 1958, MCA/Revue purchased Universal Studios&#x27; 367-acre backlot to produce television series, then leased it back to Universal for a million dollars a year for a decade. The backlot was renamed Revue Studios, which became the name of the company in 1959. In 1960, a jingle composed by Juan García Esquivel and Stanley Wilson was introduced at the end of its productions, which was used in some form until the 80s.

Revue produced later seasons of &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; for CBS and NBC and in co-operation with Jack Benny&#x27;s J and M Productions (later known as JaM Productions and JaMco Productions), &quot;Checkmate&quot; (also co-produced by Jack Benny), &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; for CBS, &quot;Studio 57&quot; for DuMont Television Network, and westerns such as &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;, &quot;The Restless Gun&quot; and &quot;Laramie&quot; for NBC, as well as &quot;Wagon Train&quot; for NBC and ABC. The first two seasons of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Virginian&quot;, based on a film released originally by Paramount Pictures, whose pre-1950 theatrical sound feature film library was sold to MCA in 1958. &quot;Wagon Train&quot; was the only Revue-produced TV show to finish an American television season in first place.

In 1962, following its merger with Decca Records, the then-parent of Universal Pictures, the studio backlot name was changed back to Universal. In 1963, MCA formed Universal City Studios to merge the motion picture and television arms of Universal Pictures and Revue Studios, and Revue was officially renamed Universal Television.

===Universal Television (original iteration)===
In 1962, MCA Inc. acquired Decca Records, including the film studio Universal-International Pictures (later renamed as Universal Pictures). The following year, in 1963, Revue Studios was reincorporated as the original iteration of Universal Television. Since then, they have made many contributions to television programming, including the production of the first television film (&quot;See How They Run&quot; from 1964), the first wheel series (&quot;The Name of the Game&quot; from 1968), the first rotating series with an umbrella title (1969&#x27;s &quot;The Bold Ones&quot;) and the first two-part television movie (&quot;Vanished&quot; from 1971). Uni TV (also commonly known as MCA/Universal) also co-produced many shows with Jack Webb&#x27;s Mark VII Limited, such as &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot; and a revival of the 1951 series &quot;Dragnet&quot;. 

In 1967, Grant Tinker, formerly employee of NBC was hired to join the studio. He held the position for two years, until he left in 1969 to join 20th Century-Fox Television, and later that year, had to start MTM Enterprises. He subsequently left Fox in 1971 due to conflicts with running MTM.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Uni TV produced shows such as &quot;Baretta&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; and &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, many of which received critical acclaim and several TV movie spin-offs after their cancellations.

In 1980, Bud Austin has received a production contract with Universal Television to produce television series. One of the more notable contracts was writer/producer Dick Wolf, whose Universal association began in 1986 with &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, then writing for several more shows before creating the hit &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise. In 1987, Universal Television, which by then, was the leading producers in prime time television programming, decided to have six pilots committed for network production value, plus three series for the 1987–88 season, which included development deals with people who already contracted with Universal.

In 1990, MCA/Uni TV began the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise. In 1991, Tom Thayer was named president of the Universal Television arm. In 1993, former Warner Bros. Television senior vice president of production employee Steven J. Papazian joined Universal Television as vice president of production. In 1992, Universal Television signed a deal with several newer talent, plus some returning and existing talent that were offered at the studio, including Ivan Reitman, David Burke, John Leekley and R.J. Stewart. In 1993, St. Clare Entertainment, a company owned by John Landis had reupped its contract at both MCA TV, MTE and Universal Television, three of the encompassing TV units of MCA via the MCA TV Group. In 1994, Universal Television made a financing partnership with ABC to help them fund the show &quot;Blue Skies&quot;.

In 1996, MCA was reincorporated as Universal Studios. Around the same time, Universal was acquired by Joseph A. Seagram and Sons and later acquired the Multimedia Entertainment and USA Network. Also that year, Universal Television collaborated with Warner Bros. Television to develop the series &quot;Spy Game&quot; for ABC, with Universal alumnus Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert of Renaissance Pictures, and Warner alumnus John McNamara producing the series, but it didn&#x27;t last long, as it only lasted one season on the air.

Universal purchased a 50% stake of Brillstein-Grey Entertainment in 1996 for $75 to $100 million, and included distribution rights to then-new BGE programming such as &quot;Alright Already&quot;, and does not include older BGE programs that was grandfathered by the Columbia TriStar distribution agreement, such as &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; for HBO, &quot;NewsRadio&quot; and &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; for NBC, and &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot; for The WB. They considered buying the other 50% after selling its own TV unit to Barry Diller in 1998. Universal sold its stake in BGE in 1999 and BGE was renamed as Brad Grey Television, though Universal continued to co-produce &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; and &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot; until their cancellations.

EMKA, Ltd. is the holding company responsible for a majority of the pre-1950 Paramount Pictures sound library. As an official part of the Universal Pictures library, they are part of the company&#x27;s television unit, Universal Television.

===MCA Television Entertainment===

During the 1970s and 1980s, MCA TV, the syndication company, had a production shop that produced shows like &quot;Probe&quot;, which aired on ABC.

MCA Television Entertainment (or MTE for short) was founded in 1989 as the telemovie and cable division of Universal Television. It primarily dealt with made-for-TV movies, and television shows like &quot;Dream On&quot; that were made for cable networks like HBO. It was also a producer of first-run syndication programming for the Hollywood Premiere Network, which was distributed by MCA&#x27;s own syndication arm MCA TV, as well as KCOP-TV in Los Angeles and WWOR-TV in New York, such as &quot;They Came from Outer Space&quot;, &quot;Shades of L.A.&quot; and &quot;She-Wolf of London&quot;, but it only lasted one season from 1990 to 1991, but it didn&#x27;t last long.

In 1990, Michael Landsbury was named vice president of series programs, Angela Mancuso as vice president of production, and Michael Houbrick was named assistant director of publicity, at the studio.

One of the most notable clients of MTE was Papazian-Hirsch Entertainment, who produced a bulk of these television movies and series for the studio.

In 1996, it was renamed as Universal Television Entertainment (or UTE for short) to align with MCA&#x27;s rebranding as Universal Studios. It was eventually renamed to Studios USA Pictures in 1998, and merged into USA Cable Entertainment in 1999. MCA Television Entertainment was also a collective branding for their units owned and operated by MCA, and it absorbed Universal Family Entertainment and Universal Cartoon Studios in 1996.

===Studios USA Television===

USA Networks Inc. was founded by Barry Diller when he bought Universal&#x27;s major television assets in February 1998. Among its assets were the USA Network and Sci-Fi Network cable channels along with series such as &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. Additionally, the company would own the HSN, the Ticketmaster Group and several television stations. Universal Television&#x27;s production and distribution unit was renamed Studios USA. Universal held on to its 50% share of Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, PolyGram&#x27;s international channels and the rights to its television library while signing a long-term domestic sales deal with Studios USA for the library. Universal got a 45% share in USA Networks Inc. Greg Meidel initially resigned and was rehired as chairman and CEO of Studios USA, only to leave in June 1998.

In 1999, USA Networks formed its own film and home media divisions when they acquired October Films and several production and distribution assets of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment for $200 million. Most of the new shows produced under the Studios USA name bombed after only one or two seasons; only &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; and &quot;The District&quot; were deemed to be big hits. Although the latter two were cancelled, in 2011 and 2004 respectively, the former is still an ongoing show.

In 2000, Clyde Phillips has signed an overall deal with the studio to develop scripts made for the studio.

On December 17, 2001, Vivendi Universal agreed to acquire USA&#x27;s entertainment assets for an estimated $10.3 billion; the transaction closed on May 8, 2002. Under the deal, Barry Diller became chairman of Vivendi Universal Entertainment. USA Networks is currently known as IAC. Shortly afterwards, Studios USA Television was merged with Universal Studios Network Television, producers of NBC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; to form Universal Network Television.

===PolyGram Television/Universal Network Television===
In 1997, PolyGram created not only its syndication unit, but a network unit for long-form television movies and drama series, which was a rebranding from the former UK-based ITC Entertainment television division of PolyGram. It was headed up by Bob Sanitsky, who headed the combined syndication and network divisions. In 1998, it signed a deal with Meg Ryan and her Prufock Pictures to set up her projects at the studio.

In early 1999, shortly after Seagram and Universal completed their deal to acquire PolyGram, PolyGram Television was absorbed into Universal&#x27;s TV and Networks division (which consisted of Universal&#x27;s international television operations). Universal would sell the ITC film and television library to Carlton Communications, and the pre-1996 film library to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Shortly afterwards, PolyGram Television was then retained by Universal, opting Bob Sanitsky out of the unit. Universal however then launched Universal Studios Network Programming to inherit the Brillstein-Grey productions, such as the upcoming &quot;Work with Me&quot;, and the existing Brillstein-Grey shows &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; and &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot;. In 2001, NBC had an option agreement with Universal Network Television to keep &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; on the air to 2003.

In June 2002, Universal Studios Network Television was also merged with Studios USA Network Television around the same time. In 2003, writer John Ridley signed a deal with the studio. Also that year, longtime Universal executives Sarah Timberman and Carl Beverly left the studio to start out 25C Productions, a production company affiliated with Warner Bros. Television.

===USA Cable Entertainment===

The origins of USA Cable Entertainment are traced back to the 1980s when it was founded as USA Network Productions to produce content for the USA Networks. In 1996, it was rebranded to USA Studios, and in 1999 to USA Networks Productions, and later on reincorporated as USA Cable Entertainment on December 24, 1999. Stephen Chao was named as the company&#x27;s president in 2000.

The company was best known for producing &quot;Monk&quot; and the 2003 miniseries &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, which spawned a reboot in 2004. The same year, following the NBC Universal merger, the USA Cable Entertainment name was retired and was replaced with the NBC Universal Television Studio name. In 2008, the studio, then renamed Universal Media Studios, spun off its cable production division, including shows previously produced under the USA Cable Entertainment name, to Universal Cable Productions (now Universal Content Productions).

===NBC Studios (production company)===

NBC Television Network&#x27;s production division was founded in 1947 by RCA (NBC&#x27;s former parent company). One of its first productions was the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;.

In 1955, NBC acquired production company Kagran Corporation, and by 1956, changed its company name to California National Productions (CNP) and became its syndication and merchandising division. The company also brought several NBC-aired programs, like &quot;The Adventures of Hiram Holliday&quot; and &quot;The Lawless Years&quot;, as well as non-NBC programs like &quot;The Silent Service&quot; and &quot;Philip Marlowe&quot;, but none of them were successful. The company&#x27;s first hit was the television show &quot;Bonanza&quot;, which aired from 1959 to 1973 on the NBC television network. Its follow-up project that was produced independently was &quot;Outlaws&quot;, a western from 1960 to 1962. The third independently produced NBC show, &quot;The Americans&quot;, which aired only in 1961, lasted a few episodes, and bombed after only one season.

In 1961, California National changed its name to NBC Films, and in 1963, launched NBC Productions to continue producing its existing show &quot;Bonanza&quot;, and develop newer projects for the network. NBC developed and produced several shows internally like &quot;Kentucky Jones&quot;, &quot;Captain Nice&quot; and &quot;T.H.E. Cat&quot;. By 1966, the company had output talent deals with Sheldon Leonard, Bob Finkel, Norman Felton and David Dortort. The next big project was &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;, which was a hit among viewers throughout its four-season run, only to be axed in 1971 due to the rural purge. Throughout its partnership with Sheldon Leonard, they produced three shows &quot;Accidental Family&quot;, &quot;My Friend Tony&quot; and &quot;My World and Welcome to It&quot;, but none of them were successful. In 1974, NBC produced its next big hit &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;. NBC Films was later sold to Worldvision Enterprises due to the 1970 fin-syn rules initiated by the Nixon Administration; today, the shows of that company are now owned by Paramount Global, syndicated by its CBS Studios subsidiary CBS Media Ventures.

In the 1980s, NBC produced &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;, which was popular among viewers. NBC&#x27;s production output was primarily on television movies and miniseries. NBC&#x27;s other television series output were &quot;Sara&quot; and &quot;Roomies&quot;; both of them were unsuccessful. In 1985, Michael Filerman through his Michael Filerman Productions company signed a deal with NBC Productions to develop long-form telemovies and miniseries, as well as television series. In the late 1980s, NBC Productions attempted to enter the film business, but it was proven unsuccessful, after the failure of the film &quot;Codename: Emerald&quot;. In 1987, NBC Productions provided funding for a feature film that starred Cassandra Peterson as her Elvira character, which raised $5–6 million by NBC to fund the film. In 1988, NBC started a deal with Peter Engel that resulted in the creation of &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot; and eventually producing a number of teen shows.

In early 1990, NBC had struck a development deal with musician/producer Quincy Jones and his Quincy Jones Entertainment company. Also the same year, NBC signed a deal with Jay Tarses for his production company. By 1990, NBC returned to producing hit programs with the sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, which starred Will Smith, in one of the first TV roles. Also that same year, NBC Productions partnered with Group W Productions to develop a syndicated program &quot;House Party&quot;. In 1991, NBC produced another syndicated show, this time, out of the WMAQ-TV studios, &quot;Johnny B...On the Loose&quot;, in partnership with Viacom Enterprises.

In 1993, Perry Simon left NBC to start his own production company with a non-exclusive production agreement. In 1995, NBC launched a partnership with television director James Burrows to create 3 Sisters Entertainment, who produced series for the network. Out of these five, the most successful out of the venture were &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; and &quot;Caroline in the City&quot; (co-produced and owned by CBS Productions). Later that year, NBC Productions was however folded into NBC&#x27;s entertainment division.

In 1996, the company was renamed NBC Studios. The company had returned to producing hit programs like &quot;The Pretender&quot;, &quot;Profiler&quot;, &quot;Providence&quot;, &quot;Ed&quot;, &quot;Las Vegas&quot; and &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;. In 2004, NBC Studios was merged with Universal Network Television to form NBC Universal Television Studio.

===2004–present===
NBC Universal Television Studio was formed in 2004 from NBC Studios and Universal Network Television after NBC and Universal merged. On June 14, 2007, NBC Universal Television Studio was renamed Universal Media Studios (UMS) as the unit would be also developing entertainment for the web.

On July 21, 2009, Universal Cable Productions was split off from UMS and placed into NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group division. On September 12, 2011, Universal Media Studios was renamed to Universal Television. In October 2019, Universal Television was transferred from NBC Entertainment to NBCUniversal Content Studios.

==Universal Television Alternative Studio==

Universal Television Alternative Studio (&quot;Universal Television Alternative&quot; according to the company&#x27;s on-screen logo) is an American television production company launched by Universal Television in 2016. The unit reports to Universal Studio Group chairman Pearlena Igbokwe.

The studio was founded in June 2016 under president Meredith Ahr. In July 2016, the studio&#x27;s first program, &quot;World of Dance&quot;, was announced by NBC. The studio sold its first show to another channel (&quot;In Search Of...&quot; to History).

The studio, as did Universal TV, signed a first-look agreement with Chelsea Handler in March 2018. Both production units signed that same year in August an overall agreement with Eddie Schmidt.

In November 2018, Ahr became president of alternative and reality group, NBC Entertainment. Ahr was replaced as the studio&#x27;s president in August 2019 by Toby Gorman, last the interim CEO of Magical Elves. From Endemol Shine North America, Georgie Hurford-Jones was hired in December 2019 as executive vice president of current programming.

Mario Lopez moved from hosting &quot;Extra&quot; to NBCUniversal&#x27;s &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; in July 2019 with production deal with Universal TV and Universal TV Alternative Studio. His first project, &quot;Menudo&quot;, an hour-long competition show, under the deal was announced to be in development in April 2020.

<doc id="959391" wikidata="Q1265449" url="?curid=959391" title="Panama Hattie">
<text>Panama Hattie is a 1940 American musical with music and lyrics by Cole Porter and book by Herbert Fields and B. G. DeSylva. The musical is about a nightclub owner, Hattie Maloney, who lives in the Panama Canal Zone and ends up dealing with both romantic and military intrigue. The title is a play on words, referring to the popular Panama hat.

The musical was adapted as the 1942 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical film &quot;Panama Hattie&quot;, and again in 1954 as an episode of the CBS TV series &quot;The Best of Broadway&quot;.

==Productions==

Pre-Broadway tryouts started at the Shubert Theatre, New Haven on October 3, 1940, and then at the Shubert Theatre, Boston on October 8, 1940.

The musical premiered on Broadway at the 46th Street Theatre on October 30, 1940, and closed on January 3, 1942, after 501 performances. It was directed by Edgar MacGregor, with choreography by Robert Alton and scenic design and costumes by Raoul Pène Du Bois. The cast featured Ethel Merman as Hattie, Arthur Treacher as Vivian, Betty Hutton as Florrie, James Dunn as Nick, Phyllis Brooks as Leila, Joan Carroll as Geraldine, Rags Ragland as Woozy, and Pat Harrington as Skat. Among the dancers were June Allyson, Doris Dowling and Constance Dowling, Betsy Blair, Lucille Bremer and Vera-Ellen.

The show opened in the West End at the Piccadilly Theatre on November 4, 1943, and ran for 308 performances. It was produced by William Mollison with the entire production supervised by Lee Ephraim and dances by Wendy Toye. The cast featured Bebe Daniels as Hattie, Max Wall as Eddy, Claude Hulbert as Vivian, Frances Marsden as Florrie, Ivan Brandt as Nick, Georgia MacKinnon as Leila, Richard Hearne as Loopy and Betty Blackler as Elizabeth.

The musical was revived for several performances as a staged concert at Barbican Cinema 1 in London in 1996 as part of the &quot;Lost Musicals&quot; series directed and produced by Ian Marshall Fisher. Louise Gold starred as Hattie, with Jon Glover as Windy. The &quot;Musicals Tonight!&quot; series presented a staged concert of the musical in New York City in October 2010.

==Plot==
;Act I
Hattie Maloney owns a night club in the Panama Canal Zone where she also performs. Three sailors from the S.S. &quot;Idaho&quot;, Skat Briggs, Windy Deegan and Woozy Hoga, ask her to sing at a party they are organizing (&quot;Join It Right Away&quot;). Nick Bullet, Hattie&#x27;s fiancé, is a wealthy Navy officer. They are about to meet his eight-year-old daughter Geraldine (Jerry), off the boat from Philadelphia. He tells Hattie, &quot;My Mother Would Love You&quot;. Hattie, eager to make a good impression on her prospective stepdaughter, spends three weeks&#x27; wages on her elaborately frilly outfit. But when she arrives, Jerry makes fun of Hattie&#x27;s clothing and way of speaking. Feeling that her marriage is off, Hattie gets drunk on rum (&quot;I’ve still Got my Health&quot;). Kitty-Belle, the daughter of Admiral Whitney Randolph, wants to marry Nick, and she schemes to end his romance with Hattie.

Florrie, a singer in the night club, develops a crush on Nick&#x27;s very proper butler Vivian Budd (&quot;Fresh as a Daisy&quot;). Nick&#x27;s efforts to persuade Jerry and Hattie to get along with each other finally succeed, with Jerry making the still hungover Hattie cut the bows off her dress and shoes (&quot;Let’s Be Buddies&quot;). Jerry gives Hattie advice on how to behave like a lady at a party where she is to be presented to Nick&#x27;s boss, the Admiral (&quot;I’m Throwing a Ball Tonight&quot;). Admiral Randolph is to be presented with a cup, and his daughter Leila suggests that Hattie might present it filled with goldenrod. This gives Whitney hay fever; Hattie is blamed, and Nick is ordered not to marry Hattie.

;Act II
The sailors from the S. S. Idaho uncover a spy plot involving saboteurs. Hattie swears off rum (&quot;Make It Another Old Fashioned Please&quot;). Hattie has it out with Leila, whose boyfriend keeps being called in whenever Hattie is on the verge of hitting her. Meanwhile, Florrie continues to try to attract the romantic attention of Budd (&quot;All I’ve Got to Get Now is My Man&quot;). Hattie, two of the sailors and Budd meet regarding these various threads (&quot;You Said It&quot;). Mildred Hunter, Leila&#x27;s best friend, turns out to be a terrorist. She gives Jerry a secret package to put in Nick&#x27;s desk. Hattie overhears the plot to blow up the Panama Canal control room, finds the bomb and throws it out, saving the day. The grateful Admiral Whitney retracts his order and the sailors praise Hattie (&quot;God Bless the Woman&quot;).

==Adaptations==
===Film===
===Television===
&quot;The Best of Broadway&quot; series broadcast a version of &quot;Panama Hattie&quot; on CBS Television on November 10, 1954. Ethel Merman, Ray Middleton, and Art Carney starred.

==Reception==
Brooks Atkinson in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;By hiring a trio of knockabout comedians, Mr. De Sylva has given it all the advantages of a burlesque show...Everything is noisy, funny and in order.&quot; Merman &quot;rolls though it with the greatest gusto, giving it a shake and a gleam and plenty of syncopation...The Merman hangs bangles on any song that comes her way.&quot;

&quot;&#x27;Panama Hattie&#x27; was a typical example of turning a routine musical comedy into entertainment gold. Without her [Merman] there was no show, and the musical has rarely been heard of since.&quot;

<text>Yangzhou is a prefecture-level city in central Jiangsu Province, East China. Sitting on the north bank of the Yangtze, it borders the provincial capital Nanjing to the southwest, Huai&#x27;an to the north, Yancheng to the northeast, Taizhou to the east, and Zhenjiang across the river to the south. Its population was 4,559,797 at the 2020 census and its urban area is home to 2,635,435 inhabitants, including three urban districts, currently in the agglomeration.

Historically, Yangzhou was one of the wealthiest cities in China, known at various periods for its great merchant families, poets, artists, and scholars. Its name ( &quot;Rising Prefecture&quot;) refers to its former position as the capital of the ancient Yangzhou prefecture in imperial China. Yangzhou was one of the first cities to benefit from one of the earliest World Bank loans in China, used to construct Yangzhou thermal power station in 1994.

==Administration==
Currently, the prefecture-level city of Yangzhou administers six county-level divisions, including three districts, two county-level cities and one county. Accordingly, they are further divided into 98 township-level divisions, including 87 towns and townships, and 11 subdistricts.

==History==
===Ancient China===
During the Spring and Autumn period of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, the hegemon Fuchai of Wu constructed the Han or Hangou Canal &quot;Hángōu&quot;) to improve his supply lines from his center of power around present-day Suzhou to the North China Plain, where he was engaged in an ongoing conflict with Qi. Taking advantage of the many streams and lakes of the Jianghuai Plain, the canal connected the Yangtze River within present-day Yangzhou to the Huai River within present-day Huai&#x27;an by 486BC. The next year, Fuchai established a fortress to protect the southern end of the new canal at Hancheng. Following the Chinese urban design principles of the time, it was constructed as a 3 li by 3 li square about above the water level on the Yangtze&#x27;s northern bank, with the Han Canal forming a moat around the southern and eastern sides of the city. The town was intended to stall any possible counterattack from Qi down the canal, giving time to raise reinforcements from Suzhou and Wu&#x27;s other lands in the Yangtze Delta.

===Imperial China===
Under the Eastern Han dynasty, the area was organized as the Guangling Commandery of Xu Province. Its seat of governmentalso known as Guanglingwas also near the confluence of the Yangtze and the Han Canal, although at a slightly different location than the former Wu fortress.

Under the Sui, Guangling was reorganized as Yang Province (&quot;zhou&quot;) in the year AD 590. Its seat of government took the new name as well. Prospering as the Emperor Yang (r.604–617) connected the Han Canal to other waterways north and south to form the core of the Grand Canal, Yangzhou became the southern capital of China under the name Jiangdu. With the failure of his invasions of Korea and a series of natural disasters, Emperor Yang abandoned to north entirely in 616 and made Jiangdu his primary capital until his assassination in 618.

Restoring the former name Guangling, the Tang made the city a major port for foreign trade and turned it into a leading economic and cultural center. Many foreign merchants lived in the city, including many Koreans, Arabs, and Persians. Thousands of Muslim Arab, Persian and other foreign merchants were massacred in 760 by forces under Tian Shengong, sent to suppress the city&#x27;s rebellion.

Jiangdu served briefly as the capital of a revived Wu Kingdom during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.

After the 1127 Jingkang Incident led to the Jurchen-led Jin conquest of Kaifeng, the Song used Yangzhou as their capital in 1128 and 1129. Song troops under Du Chong &quot;Dù Chōng&quot;, d.1141) breached the southern embankments of the Yellow River in an effort to stop the southward of Jin army, but the resulting avulsion caused the river to swing south of the Shandong Peninsula and capture the Si River and lower Huai. The Grand Canal was truncated for decades and the Southern Song moved to Lin&#x27;an (present-day Hangzhou, Zhejiang).

In 1280, during the Yuan, Yangzhou was the site of a massive gunpowder explosion when the bomb warehouse of the Weiyang arsenal accidentally caught fire. The blast killed over a hundred guards, hurled debris from buildings into the air that landed 10 li away, and could be felt 100 li. Marco Polo claimed to have served Kubilai Khan in Yangzhou shortly thereafter, variously placed at 1282–1285 or 1282–1287. Although some versions of Polo&#x27;s memoirs imply that he was the governor of Yangzhou, it is more likely that he was an official in the salt industry if he was employed there at all. Surviving Chinese texts do not mention him at all. It is well documented, however, that Kublai Khan trusted foreigners more than Chinese/Han subjects in internal affairs and the discovery of the 1342 tomb of Katarina Vilioni, member of an Italian trading family in Yangzhou, does, however, suggest the existence of an Italian community in the city in the 14th century. Moreover, both in &quot;The Travels of Marco Polo&quot; and in the &quot;History of Yuan&quot; there is documentation about a Nestorian Christian who funded two churches in China during the three years he served as an official of the emperor. This functionary is named &quot;Mar Sarchis&quot; by Marco Polo and &quot;Ma Xuelijisi&quot; in the &quot;History of Yuan&quot;. This person served as a supervisor in the prefecture of Zhenjiang. Arabic inscriptions during the 13th and 14th centuries similarly indicate a revival of the Muslim community.

During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) until the 19th century Yangzhou acted as a major trade exchange center for salt (a government regulated commodity), rice, and silk. The Ming were largely responsible for building the city as it now stands and surrounding it with of walls, in part as protection against Wokou raids.

There was a Hui or Chinese Muslim community in Yangzhou during the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties with historic mosques like Crane Mosque and the tomb of Sayyid Puhaddin.
After the fall of Beijing and northern China to the Manchus in 1644, Yangzhou remained under the control of the short-lived Southern Ming based in Nanjing. Qing forces led by Prince Dodo reached Yangzhou in the spring of 1645, and despite the heroic efforts of its chief defender, Shi Kefa, the city fell on May 20, 1645, after a brief siege. The Yangzhou massacre followed; Wang Xiuchu&#x27;s contemporary account alleged that the number of victims was close to 800,000, but that number is certainly an exaggeration. Shi Kefa himself was killed by the Manchus when he refused to switch his allegiance to the Manchurian Qing regime. Han bannermen were responsible for most of the atrocities in Yangzhou but they were nevertheless labelled as Manchus by other Han.

The city&#x27;s rapid recovery from these events and its great prosperity through the early and middle years of the Qing dynasty were due to its role as administrative center of the Lianghuai sector of the government salt monopoly. As early as 1655, the Dutch envoy Johan Nieuhof described the city of Yangzhoufu ( in his transcription):
Famed at that time and since for literature, art, and the gardens of its merchant families, many of which were visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors during their Southern Tours, the Qing-era Yangzhou has been the focus of intensive research by historians.

The Yangzhou riot in 1868 was a pivotal moment of Anglo-Chinese relations during late Qing China that almost led to war. The crisis was fomented by the scholar-officials of the city, who opposed the presence of foreign Christian missionaries there. The riot that resulted was an angry crowd estimated at eight to ten thousand who assaulted the premises of the British China Inland Mission in Yangzhou by looting, burning and attacking the missionaries led by Hudson Taylor. No one was killed, however several of the missionaries were injured as they were forced to flee for their lives. As a result of the report of the riot, the British consul in Shanghai, Sir Walter Henry Medhurst took seventy Royal Marines in a man-of-war and steamed up the Yangtze to Nanjing in a controversial show of force that eventually resulted in an official apology from Viceroy Zeng Guofan and financial restitution made to the injured missionaries.

===Modern China===
From the time of the Taiping Rebellion (1853) to the beginning of the Reform Era (1980) Yangzhou was in decline, due to war damage, neglect of the Grand Canal as railways replaced it in importance, and stagnation in the early decades of the PRC. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, it endured eight years of Japanese occupation and was used by the enemy as a site for internment camps. About 1200 civilians of Allied nationalities (mostly British and Australian) from Shanghai were transported here in 1943, and located in one of three camps (A, B, and C). Camps B and C were closed down in September, 1943, after the second American-Japanese prisoner exchange, and their inhabitants transferred back to Shanghai camps. Camp C, located in the former American Mission in the north-west of the city, was maintained for the duration of the war.

Among early plans for railways in the late Qing was one for a line that would connect Yangzhou to the north but this was jettisoned in favor of an alternative route. The city&#x27;s status as a leading economic center in China was never to be restored. Not until the 1990s did it begin to regain some semblance of prosperity, benefitting from national economic growth and a number of targeted development projects. With the canal now partially restored, and excellent rail and road connections, Yangzhou is once again an important transportation and market center. It also has some industrial output, chiefly in cotton and textiles. In 2004, a railway linked Yangzhou for the first time with Nanjing.

==Geography==

Yangzhou is located on a plain north of the Yangtze. The Grand Canal, also known as the Jing-Hang Canal, crosses the prefecture-level from the north to the south; its modern route passes through the eastern outskirts of Yangzhou&#x27;s main urban area, while its old route runs through the city center. Other major bodies of water within the prefecture-level city include the Baoshe River, Datong River, Beichengzi River, Tongyang Canal, Xintongyang Canal, Baima Lake, Baoying Lake, Gaoyou Lake and Shaobo Lake.

Like much of the entire prefecture-level city, Yangzhou&#x27;s main urban area (the &quot;city proper&quot;) is criss-crossed by an intricate network of canals and small lakes. The historic city center (the former waled city) is surrounded by canals on all sides: the Old Grand Canal forms its eastern and southern boundaries; the City Moat Canal runs along the former walled city&#x27;s northern edge, connecting the Old Grand Canal with the Slender West Lake; the Erdaohe Canal runs along the old city&#x27;s western edge, from the Slender West Lake to the Lotus Flower Pond (Hehuachi), which in its turn is connected by the short Erdaogou canal with the Old Grand Canal. It is possible to sail a small water craft from the Thin West Lake, via the Erdaohe, the Hehua Pond, and the Erdaogou into the Old Grand Canal.

===Climate===
Yangzhou has a subtropical monsoon climate with humid changeable wind; longer winters for about 4 months, summers 4 months and shorter springs and autumns, 2 months respectively; frost-free period of around 240 days and annual average sunshine of around 1,912 hours.

The mean annual temperature is annually, with an annual average daily maximum temperature of and an annual average daily minimum temperature of . The normal monthly mean 24-hour temperature ranges from in January to in July.

The annual average precipitation is , and about 59.1% of rainfall is concentrated in the summer. The rainy season known as &quot;plum rain season&quot; usually lasts from mid-June to mid-July. During this season, the plums are ripening, hence the name plum rain. Extreme temperatures since 1951 has ranged from on 6 January 1955 to on 14 August 2022 during the 2022 China Heatwave.

==Transportation==

Yangzhou has one Yangtze River crossing, the Runyang Yangtze River Bridge complex, which has one of the longest suspension bridge spans in the world, and carries the G4011 Yangzhou–Liyang Expressway to Zhenjiang.

===Air===
The Yangzhou Taizhou International Airport, completed in 2012 to serve Yangzhou and neighboring Taizhou, is located in Jiangdu district. The Nanjing Lukou International Airport is over away; it takes one hour and 40 minutes to get there from central Yangzhou. Prior to the completion of the Yangzhou Taizhou Airport, Lukou Airport in Nanjing was the primary air gateway for passengers destined for Yangzhou. There are over 10 airline ticket offices in Yangzhou, providing convenient service for foreign and domestic tourists. domestic and international fight are available with 10 international airlines and more than 20 domestic ones

===Rail===
Until 2004, Yangzhou was not served by passenger rail. Yangzhou Railway Station began construction in 2003 and was completed a year later. It is located on the western outskirts of the city, and is a major station on the Nanjing–Qidong railway, and provides direct passenger service to the provincial capital as well as a number of major cities to the west, north, and south (such as Xi&#x27;an, Wuhan, and Guangzhou), including an overnight Z-series express train to Beijing. Later, frequent high-speed (D-series) service has been introduced on this line as well.

In 2020, the new Yangzhoudong Railway Station came into service along with Lianyungang-Zhenjiang High-Speed Railway, an important high-speed railway running through the eastern part of the city that connects Southern and Northern Jiangsu with a design speed of 250kph. The railway connects Yangzhou to many major cities in the country using high-speed trains. The fastest direct train to Shanghai takes only 1 hour 19 minutes. 

A new railway with a design speed of 350kph, Shanghai-Nanjing-Hefei High-Speed Railway, is also under construction. It is expected to run through the major existing railway station, Yangzhoudong Railway Station. 

Major passenger railway stations in Yangzhou:
=== River transport ===
Yangzhou harbor, south from the city center, is located at the junction of the Beijing–Hangzhou Canal and the Yangtze River. The average water depth is 15–20 meters. In 1992, the State Council approved it to become a first-grade open state harbor, and General Secretary Jiang Zemin inscribed its name. Now, it has developed into a comprehensive inland harbor, integrating passenger, freight, container transportation and harbor trade, and has become the main distribution center of northern Jiangsu province, eastern Anhui Province and southeast Shandong Province. There are several dozen categories of goods including iron and steel, timber, minerals, coal, grain, cotton, container, products of light industry and machinery. The passenger routes reach Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Huangshi and Wuhan in the west, and Nantong and Shanghai in the east. Some well-known luxury international liners also anchor here. The harbor has greatly promoted the development of exports and the overall local economy.

===Expressways===

The Ningyang (Nanjing–Yangzhou) Expressway crosses the southern part of Yangzhou&#x27;s metropolitan area while the Ningtong (Nanjing–Nantong) Expressway is connected to Yangzhou at Liaojiagou. In recent years, local government have attached great importance to the development of the tourism, in conjunction with a greater effort dedicated to the improvement of the local road transport system. With a total investment of 680 million yuan, the Yangzhou section of the Ningyang Expressway was completed on December 18, 1998, and opened to traffic in June 1999. Stretching nearly , the section of the expressway starts from the Bazi Flyover as the entry/exit, via the Yanggua Highway, the Tonggang Highway, an ancient canal, the Yangwei Highway, the Beijing–Hangzhou Grand Canal and the Yangling Highway, to Liqojiagou Entry/Exit of Yangjiang Highway. It then passes the Jiangdu Flyover to directly link up with the Huaijiang Expressway. In addition, the section of Huaijiang Expressway within the territory of Yangzhou began construction on March 22, 1997, which will be commonly used by the state planned Tongjiang–Sanya and Beijing–Shanghai trunk lines. The section of Huaijiang Expressway in Yangzhou totals in length, starting from Jinghe Town of Baoying in the north to the entry/exist of Zhuanqiaozhen Flyover of Jiangdu in the south. It then links with Ningtong Expressway, passing by three counties (cities) such as Baoying, Gaoyou and Jiangdu and 26 towns, at a total cost of 3.7 billion yuan. It is expected to be open to traffic by the year 2000.
===Intercity bus service===
During the daytime, frequent bus service operates between Yangzhou and nearby cities. There are several bus stations on the city&#x27;s outskirts; most of the buses from Nanjing (Nanjing West Bus Station) and Zhenjiang (where the bus station is adjacent to the Zhenjiang Railway Station) arrive to Yangzhou South Bus Station, located a few kilometers southwest from downtown. Most of the intercity bus service stops in the early evening.

===Transportation in the urban area===
The city is served by an extensive network of public bus routes.

Yangzhou&#x27;s taxi industry began in 1982, and has developed rapidly since 1993. the city has over 40 taxi companies of various ownership structures, with a total of 1,571 vehicles. Parking lots were established at key stations and hotels, and eight taxi companies have opened round-the-clock telephone service. The construction department of the municipal government has strengthened the management of taxi services, providing education in the relevant laws, professional ethics and safety aspects.

In 2014, Yangzhou&#x27;s government approved plans for the construction of a subway system, which will initially include two lines. Line 1 will run in the general east–west direction, from Yangzhou Railway Station in the west to the historic central city to the future high-speed railway station (east of the Grand Canal) to Jiangdu District. Line 2 will run in the general north–south direction.

===Tourist transportation===

To develop tourism in Yangzhou, sightseeing buses have been introduced in the city run by the Tianma travel agency under the Yangzhou Tourist Bureau. There is a tour guide on each bus. The route, starting from Yangzhou station, has eight stops, and passes by such scenic spots of the Slender West Lake, Daming Temple, Imperial Dock, Siwang Pagoda, Wenchang Pagoda, and Shita Temple. Yangzhou Public Transit also operates No. 1, No. 2, and No. 5 special tourist lines. The No. 1 bus departs from the bus station and goes by the Slender West Lake, Shigong Temple, Ge Garden, and He Garden; the No. 5 bus starts from the bus station and goes by the Crane Temple, Wenchang Pagoda, Slender West Lake, Five-Pavilion Bridge, and Pingshan Hall. A sight-seeing route on Slender West Lake has opened, connecting Imperial Dock, Yichun Garden, Hong Garden, Dahong Bridge, Xiaojinshan, Diaoyutai, Five-Pavilion Bridge, and the 24 Bridge, finally reaching Daming Temple and Pingshan Hall.

==Industries and shipyards==
Yangzhou is the site of Chengxi shipyard, large shipyard where bulk carriers and other types of large ships are built. Owned partly by the state owned CSSC holdings, through Jiangsu Xinrong shipyard, Chengxi Yangzhou shipyard builds ships from 25,000 dwt to 170,000 dwt in size.

==Culture==

The Yangzhou dialect () of Chinese is representative of Lower Yangtze Mandarin, and is particularly close to the official language of the Ming and Qing courts, which was based on the Nanjing dialect. However, it does differ considerably from modern Standard Chinese, although they are still moderately mutually intelligible.

Dialect has also been used as a tool for regional identity and politics in the Jiangbei and Jiangnan regions. While the city of Yangzhou was the center of trade, flourishing and prosperous, it was considered part of Jiangnan, which was known to be wealthy, even though Yangzhou was north of the Yangzi river. Once Yangzhou&#x27;s wealth and prosperity were gone, it was then considered to be part of Jiangbei, the &quot;backwater&quot;. After Yangzhou was removed from Jiangnan, its residents decided to replace Jianghuai Mandarin, which was the dialect of Yangzhou, with Taihu Wu dialects. In Jiangnan itself, multiple subdialects of Wu fought for the position of prestige dialect.

During a period of prosperity and imperial favor, the arts of storytelling and painting flourished in Yangzhou. The innovative painter-calligrapher Shitao lived in Yangzhou during the 1680s and again from 1697 until his death in 1707. A later group of painters from that time called the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou are famous throughout China.

Former General secretary of CPC, President of China Jiang Zemin was born and raised in Yangzhou. His middle school is located right across from the public notary&#x27;s office in Yangzhou.

Yangzhou is famous for its carved lacquerware and jade.

Some of China&#x27;s most creative and eye catching dishes come from the Yangzhou school of cuisine called Huaiyang (also commonly known as the Weiyang school). Along with Sichuan cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, and Shandong cuisine, Huaiyang cuisine () is a distinctive and masterful skill that locals are quite proud of.

The city is famous for its public bath houses, lacquerware, jadeware, embroidery, and paper-cut arts and crafts.

The city was awarded Habitat Scroll of Honor in 2006.

Yangzhou is also very famous for its toy industry (especially stuffed animals). Many tourists from neighboring cities travel to the city for its good-quality and low-priced toys.

It is worth mentioning that the city is also famous for an ancient folk art called Yangzhou storytelling (), which is like Xiangsheng—the traditional Chinese comedic performance. It rose as a performing act during the Ming dynasty. In the performance, the artist details an interesting historical story to audiences, using Yangzhou dialect. These stories have been edited by artists, so they sound very soul-stirring and funny. The best known artist of Yangzhou storytelling was Wang shaotang. His most famous works are The 10 chapters of Wu Song (), The 10 chapters of Song Jiang (), The 10 chapters of Lu Junyi (), and The 10 chapters of Shi Xiu ().
===Literary references===
Yangzhou was frequently referenced in Chinese literature. Poet Li Bai (c. 700–762) wrote in &quot;Seeing Meng Haoran off to Yangzhou from Yellow Crane Pavilion&quot;:

:At Yellow Crane Pavilion in the west
:My old friend says farewell;
:In the mist and flowers of spring
:He goes down to Yangzhou;
:Lonely sail, distant shadow,
:Vanish in blue emptiness;
:All I see is the great river
:Flowing into the far horizon.

Du Mu wrote the famous lines on Yangzhou:

:After ten years, I awoke from my Yangzhou dream,
:All I gained was a fickle reputation in the green mansions.

The &quot;green mansions&quot; or &quot;green/black lofts&quot; (&quot;qinglou&quot;) refers to the pleasure districts for which Yangzhou became known.

In the Qing dynasty novel Dream of the Red Chamber, the character of Lin Daiyu is from Yangzhou.

==Tourism==

Tourist sights include Slender West Lake and old residences in the moated town, such as the Wang Residence and the Daming temple. Yangzhou is famous for its many well preserved Yangzhou style gardens. Most of the Historic city is in the Guangling District.

===Slender West Lake===

Named after Hangzhou&#x27;s famous West Lake, this long, narrow stretch of water which meanders through Yangzhou&#x27;s western limits is a well-known scenic spot. A long bank planted with weeping willows spans the lake. At its midpoint stands the Five-Pavilion Bridge with five covered terraces, one at each of the corners and one in the center. Around the lake is a park in which are found several attractions: Xu Garden, the White Dagoba of Lianxing Temple, copied from the similar tower in Beijing&#x27;s Beihai Park; Small Gold Mountain (Xiao Jinshan); and the Fishing Platform (Diaoyutai), a favorite retreat of the Qing emperor Qian Long. The emperor was so gratified by his luck in fishing at this spot that he ordered additional stipends for the town. As it turns out, his success had been augmented by local swimmers who lurked in the lake busily attaching fish to his hook.

===Daming Temple===

Located on Shugang Hill, in the city&#x27;s northwest, is Fajing Temple, formerly known as DaMing Temple. The original temple was built in Liu Song dynasty (420–479). A nine-story pagoda, the Qilingta, was built on the temple grounds in the year of Sui dynasty (589–618) . A recent addition to the temple complex is the Jianzhen Memorial Hall, built according to Tang dynasty methods and financed with contributions raised by Buddhist groups in Japan.
When Qing Emperor Qian Long visited Yangzhou in 1765, he was troubled by The temple&#x27;s name DaMing (which literally means &quot;Great Ming&#x27;) fearing that it might revive nostalgia for the Ming dynasty, which was overthrown by his Manchu predecessors. He had it renamed Fajing Temple.
The temple was seriously damaged during the Taiping Rebellion at the beginning of the 20th century. The present structure is a reconstruction dating from the 1930s.

===Flat Hills (Ping Shan) Hall===
Built by the Song dynasty writer Ouyang Xiu when he served as prefect of the city, this hall stands just west of Fajing Temple. Looking out from this hall, the mountains to the south of the Yangtze River appear as a line at the viewer&#x27;s eye level, hence the name Flat Hills Hall. When Ouyang Xiu&#x27;s student Su Dongpo moved to Yangzhou, he too served as prefect of the city. He had a hall built directly behind the one erected by his master, and called it Guling Hall.

===Pavilion of Flourishing Culture===

The Pavilion of Flourishing Culture &quot;Wénchāng Gé&quot;) is a round, three-story pavilion in Yangzhou&#x27;s eastern sector, built in 1585 and celebrating the city&#x27;s rich cultural traditions. It is also the de facto center of the city.

Built during Ming dynasty, it is located on the cross of Wenchang Road and Wenhe Road. The whole building is about 79-foot high, and looks like Temple of Heaven in Beijing. Today, bordered by many shopping stores, Wenchange had been a symbol of commercial center to residents.

===Stone Pagoda ===
The Stone Pagoda &quot;Shítǎ&quot;) is a five-story Tang-era pagoda west of the Pavilion of Flourishing Culture. First built in 837, it is the oldest pagoda still standing in Yangzhou.

===Tomb of Puhaddin===
This is essentially a Ming dynasty graveyard that includes the tomb of Puhaddin. According to information at the tomb, he was a 16th generation descendant of Muhammad, the prophet. The tomb is on the eastern bank of the (Old) Grand Canal in the eastern sector of the city and is adjacent to a mosque which houses a collection of valuable materials documenting China&#x27;s relations with Muslim countries.

===Ge Garden===

Ge Garden or Geyuan is a Jiangnan estate and garden, reckoned among the most refined and beautiful in China. Erected off Dongguan Road over a previous estate, the present design was established and named by the prosperous salt merchant Huang Zhiyun, who named it in honor of the virtues of the bamboo that appear in his name and throughout the garden. It is particularly famed for its four rockeries intended to represent the seasons.

===He Garden===

He Garden or Heyuan, also known as the Jixiao Shanzhuang, was built by the 19th-century Qing official He Zhidao. The garden is famed for its winding 2 story corridor, the walls of which are lined with stone tablets carved with lines of classical poetry. The garden also has an open-air theater set on an island in the middle of a fish pond.

===Yechun Garden===

Yechun Garden or Yechunyuan lies on the banks of the Xiading River at the city&#x27;s northern limits. Under the Qing, the poet Wang Yuyang and his circle of friends used to gather in the garden to recite their works. The thatched roofs of the pavilions in this garden give it a quaint rustic air.

===Yangzhou Museum===
The Yangzhou Museum is on the west shore of Bright Moon Lake, its architecture intended to embody the harmony of man and nature. The museum propercovering the history of Yangzhou and the surrounding areas of Chinaoccupies only a portion of the third floor, the other floors technically organized and operated as separate museums including the Chinese Block Printing Museum () established by the State Council in August 2003 to house 300,000 printing blocks collected by Yangzhou&#x27;s Guangling Press. All together, the museums cover an area of with the exhibition area occupying a fifth of the total.

===Jiangdu Hydro Project===

The Jiangdu Hydro Project is the southern beginning of the eastern route of the South–North Water Transfer Project, intended to divert massive amounts of freshwater from the mouth of the Yangtze to China&#x27;s drier northern regions along the route of the Grand Canal. Construction of the pumping facilities involved began in 1961 and was completed in 1975. The project includes facilities for irrigation, drainage, navigation, and power generation including 4 large electric pumping stations, 6 medium-sized check gates, 3 navigation locks, and 2 trunk waterways.

<doc id="959401" wikidata="Q16886188" url="?curid=959401" title="Jimmy Treybig">
<text>James G. Treybig is the founder of Tandem Computers, which designed and manufactured the first fault tolerant computers, in 1974. These pioneering computers were marketed to transaction processing customers, who used them for ATMs, banks, stock exchanges, phone companies, 911 and military applications.

== Early life and education ==
Treybig grew up in Bellaire, Texas, and attended Bellaire High School from 1956 to 1959. He then went to Rice University, where he received a B.A. degree in 1963 and a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering in 1964; following that he went to Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he earned an MBA in 1968.

== Career ==
Treybig&#x27;s first job after graduating from Rice was as a salesman for Texas Instruments. After receiving his MBA, he worked for Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 1968, serving as marketing section manager on the HP 3000 project, the first commercial minicomputer with a full featured operating system with time-sharing, released in 1973. In 1973, he joined Kleiner Perkins venture capital company. 

In 1974, he founded Tandem Computers, funded in part by Kleiner Perkins.

Treybig served as CEO of Tandem Computers from 1974 to 1996. The business plan included detailed ideas for building a corporate culture reflecting Treybig&#x27;s values, such as paid six week sabbaticals every four years for all employees, an annual gift of 100 shares of Tandem stock to all employees, a weekly all-employee party, and a world-wide closed circuit monthly telecast to keep employees informed. Under his leadership, Tandem delivered its first product in 1976, first issued public stock in 1977, and in 1980 was ranked by &quot;Inc.&quot; magazine as the fastest-growing public company in America. When Treybig left the company in 1996, Tandem was a $2.3 billion company employing approximately 8,000 people worldwide. He was succeeded by Roel Pieper. Tandem was acquired by Compaq in 1997, and Compaq was merged with Hewlett-Packard in 2002. The product line was later merged into Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) when HP split.
== Awards ==

Upside Magazine recognized Treybig as one of the 100 people who changed the world and The Silicon Valley Forum awarded him the Visionary Award of Silicon Valley Pioneers in 2002. Both Harvard University (1981) and Stanford University (1980) recognized him with their Entrepreneur of the Year awards. The Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith awarded him the “Torch of Liberty Award” for outstanding service to the community (1983).

== Post Tandem == 
Treybig was then briefly associated with Austin Ventures; and in August 2002, he became a venture partner at New Enterprise Associates, an association that continues to the present. Treybig was featured in the documentary film &quot;Something Ventured&quot;, which premiered in 2011.

== Personal life ==
Treybig lives in Austin, Texas, and is active on amateur radio (6-meter band, call sign W6JKV), a hobby he has enjoyed since high school.

<doc id="959404" wikidata="Q5358011" url="?curid=959404" title="Electrofax">
<text>An electrofax was a type of fax. It involved electrostatic printer and copier technology, where an image was formed directly on the paper, instead of first on a drum, then transferred to paper, as it would be in xerography. It was used in the United States from the 1950s through the 1980s.

The paper used in this process was coated with a zinc oxide powder, adhered with a resin, to make it able to hold an electrostatic charge, and absorb toner, to form an image and allow the evaporation of toner dispersants. Users of electrofax machines purchased paper with the coating already applied.

Copiers typically feed paper from a roll, where it is given a static electric charge, after which it is exposed to light reflected from the original document, and focused through a lens; zinc oxide particles either preserve or discharge the electric charge, depending on the amount of light reaching them. After exposure, the paper is passed through a toner station: toner is typically carbon black suspended in an organic liquid known as a dispersant, then spread over the paper. Black toner particles adhere to areas on the paper that remain charged; discharged areas do not attract toner particles. A knife then cuts the paper to the proper length (typically letter or legal size). The subsequently independent sheet of paper then passes from the toner station, where excess dispersant is wiped off. Typically, the paper is finally sent to an output tray where any remaining dispersant evaporates, leaving copies with a faint &quot;kerosene&quot; odor.

In printers and plotters, paper is typically electrostatically charged by passing it over a bar containing hundreds or thousands of charging contacts. As paper passes over it, an image is formed by either applying or removing a charge from each individual contact. The result is a grid of charged dots on the paper. Toner is then applied as described above.

In the early 1950s, this technology was first developed at RCA (Radio Corporation of America). Subsequently, many office machine companies, including SCM (Smith Corona Marchant), Savin, etc., introduced copiers that utilized this technology. Versatec was a brand of computer printers and plotters using this process; electrostatic printers like the Versatec were important stepping-stones to later laser printers. Programs like vtroff, by Tom Ferrin at UCSF, consequently justified early more expensive laser printers.

Copying machines using electrofax technology were common from the 1960s through the 1980s. They were less expensive to manufacture than xerographic copiers, although the paper was slightly more costly than the plain paper used by xerography. Electrofax fell out of favor when other copier technologies could produce markedly better quality copies at less expense. By comparison, electrofax suffered a number of drawbacks, including: weak blacks in the image (most machines could only produce a dark gray), dampness and odor of the copies, the need for special paper, and multiple-bottle liquid toner replacement. Similarly, the need for electrofax based printers &amp; plotters faded, as laser printers became cheaper, followed by inkjet printers.

<text>AirTrain Newark is a monorail people mover system connecting the terminals and various parking facilities at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and trains at Newark Liberty International Airport Station on the Northeast Corridor (NEC), where transfers are possible to Amtrak and NJ Transit&#x27;s Northeast Corridor Line and North Jersey Coast Line. The monorail opened in 1996, and is planned to be replaced by the mid-to-late 2020s.

== History ==
=== Planning and initial operations ===

In 1991, ground was broken for AirTrain Newark&#x27;s construction. A monorail had been proposed in order to alleviate vehicular traffic at the terminals. Originally projected to open in 1994, the completion date was pushed back due to a change in project management and issues related to the system&#x27;s switches.

The $354 million monorail eventually opened on May 31, 1996. It initially served only as an airport circulator, a service which allows passengers to transfer between airport terminals or concourses. Service was phased in, with trains operating from 5 AM to 11 PM for the first 60 days of the monorail&#x27;s operations, after which time it would operate at all times, starting early that August. The monorail tracks were soon thereafter extended to the Northeast Corridor, with construction on that project beginning in 1997; the extension opened on October 21, 2001.

When the system first opened in 1996, a fleet of 12 six-car trains ran on the network. The fleet was later expanded to 18 six-car trains.

In September 2000, the monorail temporarily shut down after defects were detected in the system&#x27;s de-icing mechanisms. Originally anticipated to last for three months, the shutdown &amp; repairs lasted for six months, and the monorail resumed operations on the morning of March 10, 2001. Adtranz was responsible for paying the $25 million in repairs, and temporary shuttle buses provided service in lieu of the monorail during the shutdown period.

The contract to build the system was awarded to Von Roll, but the project was finished by Adtranz, which acquired Von Roll&#x27;s monorail division while the system was being built. Adtranz was later acquired by Bombardier Transportation, which was itself purchased by Alstom, which continues to operate the AirTrain under contract to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey – the operator of the airport.

AirTrain service was suspended from May 1, 2014, for 75 days, until mid-July, to allow for repairs to be made. Repairs were completed early, and the system resumed operations on July 3.

=== Replacement ===
The system has a projected lifespan of 25 years. In April 2015, the PANYNJ suggested that initial work to replace the system would cost $40 million in consultant and engineering studies. In 2017, the Port Authority decided to include the then $1.7 billion PATH extension to the Newark Liberty International Airport &quot;RailLink&quot; station in their 2017 10-year capital plan, while the AirTrain was given $300 million for maintenance and repairs.

However, in January 2019, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced a plan for a $2 billion replacement project for the AirTrain. Murphy has stated that replacement is necessary because the system is reaching the end of its projected 25-year life and is subject to persistent delays and breakdowns. The Port Authority would be responsible for funding the project. In October 2019, the Port Authority&#x27;s Board of Commissioners approved the AirTrain Newark Replacement Project, with an estimated cost of $2.05 billion. Construction was expected to start in 2021 and be completed in 2024. A draft environmental impact statement was completed in February 2021 when the proposed opening date was shifted to 2026. Federal environmental approval for the project was received later that year.

In December 2023, the Port Authority announced that Doppelmayr will manufacture the replacement system, awarding them the contract in the first phase of the project&#x27;s contract procurement process. The new system will use automated, cable-driven trains, and many portions of the route will travel along new alignments; the new system will be in in length and have four stations. Tutor Perini received a $1.2 billion contract in November 2024 to construct the new system&#x27;s stations and elevated tracks, at which point the system&#x27;s cost had increased to $3.5 billion. Parsons Corporation was hired the next month to design the stations and guideway.

== Fare ==
The train is free, except for passengers traveling to and from the RailLink station to connect with NJ Transit or Amtrak; these passengers must pay an $8.50 &quot;AirTrain access fee&quot; at that station. When passengers purchase a rail ticket to or from the station, the fee is automatically added to the ticket price and a barcode is printed on the ticket that is used to pass through the fare gate array between the AirTrain platform and the train platform. Passengers using passes to another station and those who pay a cash fare on board the train must purchase a separate AirTrain ticket from machines located on either side of the fare gates. Child tickets (ages 5 to 11) are exempt from this additional fare.

The access fee has been raised several times since the system was built, with the last increase to $8.50 going into effect on March 1, 2024.

== Stations ==
The AirTrain has three major stations within the airport: one for each terminal (A, B, and C). Two stations – Terminal B and Terminal C – sit on top of their respective terminal buildings. There are two other stations (P3 and P4) for the parking lots and rental car facilities, plus a sixth (the RailLink station) at the Northeast Corridor. The system previously included two other stations: P1 and P2 – but the P1 station was removed in July 2019 to permit construction of a new consolidated rental car and parking facility, and P2 closed in June 2021 in connection with the same project. However, the P2 station was reopened as the new Terminal A station in conjunction with the new Terminal A in January 2023. The former Terminal A station was initially used as an &quot;employees only&quot; stop, but after the terminal&#x27;s permanent closure, the employees stop has since been moved to the closed P3 station.

Automated announcements recorded by former traffic reporter Bernie Wagenblast tell riders which airlines can be found in each terminal, as well as available connections at other stations.

All stations are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

In 2007, the average daily paid ridership was 4,930.
== Rolling stock ==

AirTrain Newark operates using 18 Von Roll Mk III trainsets, each train consisting of 6 cars. Automated announcements onboard the trains announce the stations and the airlines &amp; connections available at the given station – in addition to various other messages; the announcements are recorded by former traffic reporter Bernie Wagenblast.

The fleet originally consisted of 12 six-car trains, but an additional six trainsets – also six cars in length – were eventually added, bringing the total number of trainsets to 18.

Trains travel up to along the line.

=== Future ===
Upon the completion of the replacement AirTrain Newark system in the 2020s, the current Von Roll Mk III monorail trainsets will be retired and replaced by cable-driven trainsets manufactured by Doppelmayr.

<doc id="959417" wikidata="Q4276487" url="?curid=959417" title="Gwendolyn MacEwen">
<text>Gwendolyn Margaret MacEwen (1 September 1941 – 29 November 1987) was a Canadian poet and novelist. A &quot;sophisticated, wide-ranging and thoughtful writer,&quot; she published more than 20 books in her life. &quot;A sense of magic and mystery from her own interests in the Gnostics, Ancient Egypt and magic itself, and from her wonderment at life and death, makes her writing unique... She&#x27;s still regarded by most as one of Canada&#x27;s greatest poets.&quot;

== Life ==
MacEwen was born in Toronto, Ontario. Her mother, Elsie, spent much of her life as a patient in mental health institutions. Her father, Alick, suffered from alcoholism. Gwendolyn MacEwen grew up in the High Park area of the city, and attended Western Technical-Commercial School.

MacEwan&#x27;s first poem was published in &quot;The Canadian Forum&quot; when she was only 17, and she left school at 18 to pursue a writing career. By 18 she had written her first novel, &quot;Julian the Magician.&quot;

&quot;She was small and slight, with a round pale face, huge blue eyes usually rimmed in kohl (Type of eyeliner and cosmetic), and long dark straight hair.&quot;

Her first book of poetry, &quot;The Drunken Clock&quot;, was published in 1961 in Toronto. then the centre of a literary revival in Canada, encouraged by the editor Robert Weaver and influential teacher Northrop Frye. MacEwen was thus in touch with James Reaney, Margaret Atwood, Dennis Lee, etc. She married poet Milton Acorn, 19 years her senior, in 1962, although they divorced two years later.

She published over twenty books, in a variety of genres. She also wrote numerous radio docudramas for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), including a &quot;much-admired radio drama&quot;, &quot;Terror and Erebus&quot;, in 1965 which featured music by Terry Rusling.

With her second husband, Greek musician Niko Tsingos, MacEwen opened a Toronto coffeehouse, The Trojan Horse, in 1972. She and Tsingos translated some of the poetry of contemporary Greek writer Yiannis Ritsos (published in her 1981 book &quot;Trojan Women&quot;).

She taught herself to read Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, and French, and translated writers from each of those languages. In 1978 her translation of Euripides&#x27; drama &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; was first performed in Toronto.

She served as writer in residence at the University of Western Ontario in 1985, and the University of Toronto in 1986 and 1987.

During the last years of her life she was in a relationship with street writer Crad Kilodney (Lou Trifon).

MacEwen died in 1987, at the age of 46, of health problems related to alcoholism. She is buried in Toronto&#x27;s Mount Pleasant Cemetery.

==Writing==

&quot;A sophisticated, wide-ranging and thoughtful writer,&quot; says &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;, MacEwen &quot;displayed a commanding interest in magic and history as well as an elaborate and penetrating dexterity in her versecraft.&quot;

Her two novels – &quot;Julian the Magician&quot;, dealing with the ambiguous relationship between the hermetic philosophies of the early Renaissance and Christianity; and &quot;King of Egypt, King of Dreams,&quot; which imaginatively reconstructed the life and religious reformation of Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaton – blend fantasy and history.

==Recognition==
MacEwen won the Governor General&#x27;s Award in 1969 for her poetry collection &quot;The Shadow Maker&quot;. She was awarded a second Governor General&#x27;s Award posthumously in 1987 for &quot;Afterworlds&quot;.

Other awards and prizes MacEwen won include the CBC New Canadian Writing Contest for poetry in 1965; the A.J.M. Smith Poetry Award in 1973; the Borestone Mountain Poetry Award in 1983; the CBC Literary Competition, for short story in 1983; and the Du Maurier Awards, gold and silver for poetry, in 1983.

Her writing has been translated into many languages including Chinese, French, German, and Italian.

Rosemary Sullivan published a biography of MacEwen, &quot;Shadow Maker: The Life of Gwendolyn MacEwen&quot;, in 1995, which itself won the Governor General&#x27;s Award, for non-fiction in 1995.

Fictional tributes to MacEwen have been published by Margaret Atwood (the short story &quot;Isis in Darkness&quot;), and Lorne S. Jones (the novel &quot;Mighty Oaks&quot;).

A one-woman play by Linda Griffiths, &quot;Alien Creature: A Visitation from Gwendolyn MacEwen,&quot; won the Dora Mavor Moore Award and the Chalmers Award in 2000.

Her book of poems written in 1969 called The Shadow-Maker was set to music by Dutch/Canadian composer Rudi Martinus van Dijk in 1977. As a result, one of the highlights of the 1978-79 season of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra included the world premiere of Van Dijk&#x27;s The Shadow-Maker under the direction of Mario Bernardi and featuring Canadian baritone Victor Braun. It was performed at Massey Hall in Toronto, October 1978. Gwendolyn MacEwan attended the Massey Hall performances and was deeply struck by the music&#x27;s setting of her work. The biographer of MacEwan, Rosemary Sullivan, quotes the composer Van Dijk in her book: &quot;What attracted me to the poetry was the substance behind the subject matter - namely the dream. The poetry attempts, it seems to me, to lift the veil of &#x27;Maya&#x27; (illusion). Is our sensuous experience reality or illusion? MacEwan has something in common with Strindberg and D.H. Lawrence, as an explorer of these dark corners of the soul that most of us shut out conveniently, in order to create a safe but illusory reality.&quot; As Dutch musicologist Maarten Brandt wrote, &quot;The bold and expressionistic side of Alban Berg and Arnold Schoenberg is found in van Dijk’s setting of Gwendolyn MacEwan&#x27;s The Shadow-Maker for baritone and large orchestra, written in 1977. Yet, as in every single composition by van Dijk, tonal references are present here as well, demonstrating a kinship not only with Alban Berg, but also with Benjamin Britten, Hans Werner Henze, Michael Tippett and Frank Martin; all of them composers who have not simply exploited the resources available to them, but rather were grateful ‘inhabitants’ of a rich and saturated musical landscape.&quot;

Twenty years later a documentary film by Brenda Longfellow, &quot;Shadow Maker: Gwendolyn MacEwen, Poet&quot;, was made in 1998 and won the Genie Award for Best Short Documentary.

===Gwendolyn MacEwen Parkette===

The former Walmer Road Parkette, in The Annex neighbourhood of Toronto, was renamed Gwendolyn MacEwen Parkette in her honor in 1994.

On 9 September 2006, a bronze bust of MacEwen by her friend, sculptor John McCombe Reynolds, was unveiled in the parkette.

The park had been a grassy traffic circle in the middle of Walmer Road at Lowther Avenue, but a $300,000 makeover in 2010, expanded the park and narrowed the surrounding roads. The unique redesigned greenspace reopened 21 July 2010, and writer Claudia Dey read one of MacEwen&#x27;s poems.

<text>Henry Styles Bridges (September 9, 1898November 26, 1961) was an American teacher, editor, and Republican Party politician from Concord, New Hampshire. He served one term as the 63rd governor of New Hampshire before a twenty-four-year career in the United States Senate.

==Early life and career==
Bridges was born in West Pembroke, Maine, the son of Alina Roxanna (Fisher) and Earle Leopold Bridges. He attended the public schools in Maine. Bridges attended the University of Maine at Orono until 1918. From 1918 he held a variety of jobs, including teaching, newspaper editing, business and state government. He was an instructor at Sanderson Academy, Ashfield, Massachusetts, from 1918 to 1919. He was a member of the extension staff of the University of New Hampshire at Durham from 1921 until 1922. He was the secretary of the New Hampshire Farm Bureau Federation from 1922 until 1923, and the editor of the &quot;Granite Monthly&quot; Magazine from 1924 until 1926. Meanwhile, He was the director and secretary of the New Hampshire Investment Corporation from 1924 until 1929. He was then a member of the New Hampshire Public Service Commission from 1930 until 1934.

==Political career==

Bridges ran for governor of New Hampshire in 1934, and won, becoming the nation&#x27;s youngest governor at the time, according to John Gunther&#x27;s &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot;

Republican presidential nominee Alf Landon considered Bridges as his running mate for the 1936 United States presidential election, but aides pointed out that Democrats could use &quot;Landon Bridges falling down&quot; as a campaign slogan. Bridges was elected to the United States Senate in 1936, and would serve until his death in 1961. In 1937, he retired from the Army Reserve Corps, in which he had served as a lieutenant since 1925. In 1940, he attempted to win the Republican nomination for President; the nomination was eventually won by Wendell Willkie. That same year, Bridges also received two delegates for the Republican vice presidential nomination, which eventually went to Charles L. McNary. Bridges broke his hip on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1941, and missed several months of the next Senate session.

Bridges was reelected to four subsequent terms in 1942, 1948, 1954, and 1960, but he did not complete his final term due to his death. He became the highest-ranking Republican senator, serving as chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation when the Republicans had control of the Senate from 1947 until 1949, Senate Minority Leader from 1952 until 1953, President pro tempore of the United States Senate when the Republicans had control of it from 1953 until 1955, chairman of the Joint Committee on Inaugural Arrangements for both of the inaugurations of President Dwight Eisenhower, Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations when the Republicans had control of the Senate from 1947 to 1949 and 1953–1955, and Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee from 1954 until his death.

In 1946, Bridges was part of a five-member committee which investigated racist, violent voter suppression in Mississippi incited by the state&#x27;s demagogic senator Theodore G. Bilbo. The committee, being composed of three Democrats and two Republicans, voted to exonerate Bilbo along party lines. Bridges and his fellow conservative colleague on the committee, Bourke Hickenlooper of Iowa, dissented from the decision on the grounds that Bilbo&#x27;s actions violated federal laws and abused the First Amendment.

Bridges was on the first Senate Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee under the chairmanship of Lyndon Johnson. Johnson&#x27;s biographer Robert Caro argues that Bridges offered Johnson a free hand in running the committee in return for employing two subcommittee staff members who would in fact augment Bridges&#x27; staff.

In the Senate, John Gunther wrote, Bridges was &quot;an aggressive reactionary on most issues...and he is pertinaciously engaged in a continual running fight with the CIO, the Roosevelt family and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.&quot; Bridges voted present on the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1960.

After WWII, when the U.S. government was recruiting Nazi scientists, engineers, and doctors, and Jewish members of the U.S. State Department obstructed the naturalization and political rehabilitation of those individuals, Bridges said on the floor of the Senate on July 18, 1950, that the State Department needed a &quot;first-class cyanide fumigating job&quot; to eliminate resistance to the program, part of an extended &quot;house cleaning&quot; metaphor referencing the common use of cyanide as a fumigant.

===Association with Joseph McCarthy===
Bridges was a staunch defender of Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, and was one of only 22 senators, all Republicans, who voted against the censure of McCarthy for his &quot;red scare&quot; communist investigations, and for his so-called &quot;lavender scare&quot; tactics aimed at homosexuals in 1954.

===Blackmail===
Bridges was also a key collaborator, with fellow Republican senators McCarthy and Herman Welker of Idaho, in the blackmail of Democratic Wyoming senator Lester C. Hunt, harassment that led to Senator Hunt&#x27;s suicide in his Capitol office on June 19, 1954. Bridges threatened that if he did not immediately retire from the Senate and agree not to seek reelection, Bridges would see that Hunt&#x27;s son, Lester Hunt Jr., who had been arrested for soliciting an undercover policeman, was prosecuted and that his son&#x27;s homosexuality would be widely publicized. Bridges also threatened Inspector Roy Blick of the Morals Division of the Washington Police Department with the loss of his job for failing to prosecute Hunt Jr. A Republican, Edward D. Crippa, was appointed by the Republican acting governor of Wyoming, Clifford Joy Rogers, to fill the vacant seat.

Alex Ross in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote in 2012 of an event &quot;loosely dramatized in the novel and film &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot; [in which] Senator Lester Hunt, of Wyoming, killed himself after ... Bridges ... threatened to expose Hunt&#x27;s son as a homosexual&quot;.

==Death and burial==
Bridges died of a heart attack on November 26, 1961, in East Concord and, after a service attended by a thousand people at the State House in Concord, was buried in Pine Grove Cemetery.

He was one of the poorest men ever elected governor and still of modest means when elected to the Senate, yet his widow Doloris told then Vice President Lyndon Johnson that her husband had left her &quot;a million dollars in cash&quot;. Bridges willed his East Concord home to the state to serve as a residence for New Hampshire&#x27;s governors. The New Hampshire Governor&#x27;s Mansion is known as &quot;Bridges House&quot;.

The &quot;Styles Bridges Room&quot; in the U.S. Capitol was named in his memory on March 12, 1981.

Interstate 93 in New Hampshire, from Concord north to the Vermont state line, is named the Styles Bridges Highway. In December 2012, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; called for the state to examine Bridges&#x27;s role in Senator Lester Hunt&#x27;s death and reconsider whether the state should continue to honor Bridges, or rename the highway.

<text>AirTrain JFK is an elevated people mover system and airport rail link serving John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK Airport) in New York City. The driverless system operates 24/7 and consists of three lines and nine stations within the New York City borough of Queens. It connects the airport&#x27;s terminals with the New York City Subway at the Howard Beach station in the eponymous neighborhood, and with the Long Island Rail Road and the subway in the Jamaica neighborhood. Alstom operates AirTrain JFK under contract to the airport&#x27;s operator, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

A railroad link to JFK Airport had been proposed since the 1940s. Various plans surfaced to build a JFK Airport rail connection until the 1990s, though these were not carried out because of a lack of funding. The JFK Express subway service and shuttle buses provided an unpopular transport system to and around JFK. In-depth planning for a dedicated transport system at JFK began in 1990 but was ultimately cut back from a direct rail link to an intra-borough people mover. Construction of the current people-mover system began in 1998. During construction, AirTrain JFK was the subject of several lawsuits, and an operator died during one of the system&#x27;s test runs. The system opened on December 17, 2003, after many delays. Several improvements were proposed after the system&#x27;s opening, including an unbuilt extension to Manhattan. AirTrain JFK originally had ten stations, but the Terminal 2 stop was closed in 2022.

All passengers entering or exiting at either Jamaica or Howard Beach must pay an $8.50 fare, while passengers traveling within the airport can ride for free. The system was originally projected to carry 4 million annual paying passengers and 8.4 million annual inter-terminal passengers every year. The AirTrain has consistently exceeded these projections since opening. In , the system carried a total of passengers, or about per weekday as of .

== History ==

=== Plan for direct rail connection ===


==== Early plans ====
The first proposal for a direct rail link to JFK Airport was made in the mid-1940s, when a rail line was proposed for the median of the Van Wyck Expressway, connecting Midtown Manhattan with the airport. New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses, at the time an influential urban planner in the New York City area, refused to consider the idea. In 1968, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) suggested extending the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) to the airport as part of the Program for Action, an ambitious transportation expansion program for the New York City area. Ultimately, the rail link was canceled altogether due to the New York City fiscal crisis of 1975. Another proposal, made by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1987, called for a rail line to connect all of JFK Airport&#x27;s terminals with a new $500 million transportation center. The Port Authority withdrew its plans in 1990 after airlines objected that they could not fund the proposal.

In 1978, the MTA started operating the JFK Express, a premium-fare New York City Subway service that connected Midtown Manhattan to the Howard Beach–JFK Airport station. The route carried subway passengers to the Howard Beach station, where passengers would ride shuttle buses to the airport. The shuttle buses transported passengers between the different airport terminals within JFK&#x27;s Central Terminal Area, as well as between Howard Beach and the terminals. The JFK Express service was unpopular with passengers because of its high cost, and because the buses often got stuck in traffic. The service was ultimately canceled in 1990.

==== 1990s plans ====
By the 1990s, there was demand for a direct link between Midtown Manhattan and JFK Airport, which are apart by road. At the time, the airport was only served by two highways: the Belt Parkway and Van Wyck Expressway. During rush hour, the travel time from JFK to Manhattan could average up to 80 minutes by bus; during off-peak hours, a New York City taxi could make that journey in 45 minutes, while a bus could cover the same distance in an hour. The Port Authority, foreseeing economic growth for the New York City area and increased air traffic at JFK, began planning for a direct rail link from the airport to Manhattan. In 1991, the Port Authority introduced a Passenger Facility Charge (PFC), a $3 tax on every passenger departing from JFK, which would provide $120 million annually.

In 1990, the MTA proposed a $1.6 billion rail link to LaGuardia and JFK airports, which would be funded jointly by federal, state, and city government agencies. The rail line was to begin in Midtown Manhattan, crossing the East River into Queens via the Queensboro Bridge. It would travel to LaGuardia Airport, then make two additional stops at Shea Stadium and Jamaica before proceeding to JFK. After the Port Authority found that the ridership demand might not justify the cost of the rail link, the MTA downgraded the project&#x27;s priority. The proposal was supported by governor Mario Cuomo and Queens borough president Claire Shulman. The transport advocacy group Regional Plan Association (RPA) called the plan &quot;misguided&quot;, and the East Side Coalition on Airport Access&#x27;s executive director said, &quot;We are going to end up with another [...] uncompleted project in this city.&quot;

The Port Authority started reviewing blueprints for the JFK rail link in 1992. At the time, it was thought that the link could be partially open within six years. In 1994, the Port Authority set aside $40 million for engineering and marketing of the new line, and created an environmental impact statement (EIS). The project&#x27;s budget had grown to $2.6 billion by that year. The EIS, conducted by the New York State Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), found the plan to be feasible, though the project attracted opposition from area residents and advocacy groups.
The project was to start in 1996, but there were disputes over where the Manhattan terminal should be located. The Port Authority had suggested the heavily trafficked corner of Lexington Avenue and 59th Street, though many nearby residents opposed the Manhattan terminal outright. The Port Authority did not consider a connection to the more-highly used Grand Central Terminal or Penn Station because such a connection would have been too expensive and complicated. To pay for the project, the Port Authority would charge a one-way ticket price of between $9 and $12. By February 1995, the cost of the planned link had increased to over $3 billion in the previous year alone. As a result, the Port Authority considered abridging the rail link plan, seeking federal and state funding, partnering with private investors, or terminating the line at a Queens subway station. The following month, the administration of governor George Pataki directed the Port Authority to devise and finalize revised plans for the JFK rail link.

==== Curtailment of plan ====
The direct rail connection between Manhattan, LaGuardia Airport, and JFK Airport was canceled outright in mid-1995. The plan had failed to become popular politically, as it would have involved increasing road tolls and PATH train fares to pay for the new link. In addition, the 1990s economic recession meant that there was little chance that the Port Authority could fund the project&#x27;s rising price. Following the cancellation, the planned connection to JFK Airport was downsized to a monorail or people mover, which would travel between Howard Beach and the JFK terminals. The Port Authority initially proposed building a $827 million monorail, similar to AirTrain Newark at Newark Airport, which would open the following year. In August 1995, the FAA approved the Port Authority&#x27;s request to use the PFC funds for the monorail plan (the agency had already collected $114 million, and was planning to collect another $325 million). After the monorail was approved, the Port Authority hoped to begin construction in 1997 and open the line by 2002.

The Port Authority voted to proceed with the scaled-down system in May 1996, and it simultaneously set aside $25 million for planning and engineering. The FAA had already given the Port Authority permission to collect PFC funds for the Howard Beach branch and the terminal section, but not for the branch to Jamaica. The Port Authority&#x27;s final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the JFK people mover, released in 1997, examined eight possibilities. Ultimately, the Port Authority opted for a light rail system with the qualities of a people mover, tentatively called the JFK Light Rail System. It would replace the shuttle buses and run to Jamaica and Howard Beach. The FEIS determined that an automated system with frequent headways was the best design. Although there would not be a direct connection to Manhattan, the Port Authority estimated it would halve travel time between JFK and Midtown, with the journey between JFK and Penn Station taking one hour. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that 21 prior recommendations for direct rail links to New York-area airports had been canceled in the preceding 30 years, while the &quot;Engineering News-Record&quot; said 22 such proposals had failed.

The people mover system was one of several major projects proposed at JFK Airport during the late 1990s. Pataki supported the revised people-mover plan, but New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said the city would have to contribute $300 million, and that it was not a direct rail link from Manhattan, and thus would not be profitable because of the need to transfer from Jamaica. The Port Authority was originally planning to fund the project using $1.2 billion in PFC fees and $300 million in rental income. Giuliani wanted the Port Authority to study extending the Astoria elevated to LaGuardia Airport, as well as making the light rail system compatible with the subway or LIRR to allow possible future interoperability. By March 1997, five companies had expressed interest in building the system. The next month, Pataki agreed to provide $100 million to study a rail link to LaGuardia; in exchange, Giuliani and Queens borough president Claire Shulman agreed to not oppose the JFK link. The Port Authority was reluctant to approve more than $5 million for the LaGuardia study.

Giuliani&#x27;s continued opposition to the system delayed the project, and, if construction did not start by October, the project could lose $100 million worth of federal funds. Giuliani agreed to the plan in October 1997, when the state agreed to reimburse the city for its share of the system&#x27;s cost. As part of the agreement, the state would also conduct a study on a similar train link to LaGuardia Airport. By that time, the Port Authority had collected $441 million in PFC funds. An artist&#x27;s impression of the proposed people mover was presented to residents of southern Queens that November. Public reception was mixed. One civic leader in Jamaica was optimistic that the people mover would spur development in that neighborhood, and other supporters said it would benefit business and alleviate Van Wyck Expressway traffic in the long run. On the other hand, two community boards and several civic groups claimed the people mover would worsen traffic, and local newspaper &quot;Newsday&quot; criticized the proposal as being ineffective without a direct link to Manhattan, citing the failure of the JFK Express.

=== Construction ===

==== Approval and groundbreaking ====

The Port Authority could use the funds from the Passenger Facility Charge only to make improvements that exclusively benefited airport passengers. As a result, only the sections linking Jamaica and Howard Beach to JFK Airport were approved and built, since it was expected that airport travelers would be the sole users of the system. The federal government approved the use of PFC funds for the new light rail system in February 1998. The PFC funds could not be used for as much as $200 million of the cost because, according to the FAA, the tax funds could not be used to pay for additional costs such as storage, maintenance, operation, and fare collection expenses. The Air Transportation Association of America (ATA), which argued that FPC funds could only be used for projects within the airport itself, sued the FAA the next month, saying the light rail project was using the funds illegally.

The Port Authority awarded a $930 million design–build–operate–maintain contract in April 1998 to AirRail Transit Consortium, a group composed of Slattery Skanska, Bombardier Transportation, STV Inc., Perini Corporation, and numerous consultants. Giuliani, who did not want the city to pay the project&#x27;s $200 million cost difference, said he would not allow construction to begin unless the funding dispute was resolved. Construction of the system ultimately began in May 1998, and an official groundbreaking took place on September 16, 1998. By the beginning of 1999, the system was known as the AirTrain.

The route was to run mostly along existing rights-of-way, but three commercial properties were seized and demolished to make way for the route. Members of the New York City Planning Commission approved the condemnation of several buildings along the route in May 1999 but voiced concerns about the projected high price of the tickets, ridership demand, and unwieldy transfers at Jamaica. Before major construction could begin, the New York City Council had to vote on whether to approve the project, and the AirTrain&#x27;s supporters and opponents both lobbied the City Council heavily. Although City Council speaker Peter Vallone was publicly neutral on the project, his own office had published a study in early 1999, which criticized the AirTrain&#x27;s lack of direct access to Manhattan and predicted that it would be of little help to the local economy. To attract local support, the Port Authority offered to pay for other projects in surrounding neighborhoods, such as a waterfront park. The council approved the AirTrain that June on a 47–3 vote, even though many council members also had reservations about the AirTrain.

==== Early construction ====
Most of the system was built one span at a time, using cranes mounted on temporary structures that erected new spans as they progressed linearly along the structures. Several sections were built using a balanced cantilever design, where two separate spans were connected to each other using the span-by-span method. The Jamaica branch&#x27;s location above the median of the busy Van Wyck Expressway, combined with the varying length and curves of the track spans, caused complications during construction. One lane of the Van Wyck had to be closed in each direction during off-peak hours, causing congestion. The Port Authority also installed new sidewalks, plantings, and fences along the Van Wyck. By the end of 1999, the columns in the Van Wyck&#x27;s median were being erected, and half of the viaduct spans had been built, although only fifteen percent of the system was finished at the time.

The project also included $80 million of tunnels within the airport, which was built using a cut-and-cover method; the tunnels had been among the first contracts to be awarded. Two shifts of workers excavated a trench measuring deep, wide, and long. The water table was as shallow as beneath the surface, so contractors pumped water out of the trench during construction. For waterproofing, subcontractor Trevi-Icos Inc. poured a U-shaped layer of grout, measuring wide and between deep.

==== Reception, opposition, and complaints ====

The project was controversial from the outset: although several local politicians, community leaders, and the politically powerful construction industry supported the AirTrain, it faced opposition from the ATA and local residents. Community leaders supported the project because of its connections to the Jamaica and Howard Beach stations. Proponents, including retired U.S. congressman Floyd Flake and the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, claimed the system would attract businesses to downtown Jamaica and create jobs. Queens community boards 10, 12, and 13 cast advisory votes in support of the project.

Almost all civic groups along the Jamaica branch&#x27;s route opposed it due to concerns about nuisance, noise, and traffic. Opponents claimed that the system had not undergone the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure process, and more than 90 local organizations wanted the FAA to allow the public to discuss the PFC charges. Residents of Briarwood, a neighborhood that was not even near the AirTrain, also opposed the project because they feared the Jamaica branch would be extended to LaGuardia. There were multiple protests against the project, such as in 2000, when a crane caught fire in a suspected arson. Homeowners believed the concrete viaducts would lower the value of their houses, and some residents reported that vibrations from construction had caused their homes to shake and crack. Residents were also concerned about the noise that an elevated structure would create; according to a 2012 study, the majority of residents&#x27; complaints were due to &quot;nuisance violations&quot;.

In light of the ATA&#x27;s 1998 lawsuit, the Port Authority threatened to halt the development of a new terminal for American Airlines (one of the ATA&#x27;s primary members) at JFK Airport unless American dropped its opposition to the system. The ATA filed a federal lawsuit in January 1999, alleging misuse of PFC funds. In March, a federal judge vacated the project&#x27;s approval because the FAA had collected and perused public comments after the public-comment deadline, but found that the PFC funds had not been misused. Additionally, the judge found that the Port Authority and FAA had shut the ATA out of discussions. The FAA opened a second request for public comment and approved the project for the second time in August 1999. The ATA and two local advocacy groups appealed the funding decision in late 1999. The advocacy groups filed a second federal lawsuit in 2000, claiming that the FEIS had included misleading statements about the effects of the elevated structure on southern Queens neighborhoods. The ATA withdrew from the lawsuit, but one of the advocacy groups proceeded with the appeal and lost.

The Port Authority also hired a community liaison in 1998 to address local residents&#x27; concerns. During the next two years, the liaison received 400 calls seeking damages or complaining about vibrations and construction. In response to complaints, the Port Authority imposed strict rules regarding disruptive or loud construction activity, as well as implementing a streamlined damage claim process to compensate homeowners. Through 2002, there were 550 nuisance complaints over the AirTrain&#x27;s construction, of which 98 percent had been resolved by April of that year. By contrast, Queens Community District 12—which includes the neighborhood of South Jamaica, along the AirTrain&#x27;s route—recorded few complaints about the construction process.

==== Testing, delays, and completion ====
A website for the project was launched in April 2000. Pile-driving for elevated columns was nearly completed in late 2000, when two-thirds of the system&#x27;s columns had been installed. The United States Congress provided almost $2 million in November 2000 for wayfinding, marketing, and access projects and a study related to the AirTrain. The system was ready for its first test trains by the end of the year, and two AirTrain cars were delivered and tested after the system&#x27;s guideway rails were complete by March 2001. By then, workers had completed 140 columns for the guideways in the Van Wyck Expressway&#x27;s median. The guideways themselves were completed that August. Although the Port Authority had planned to award 17% of contracts for the first phase of AirTrain&#x27;s construction to minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBEs), only 8.6% of contracts had been awarded to MWBEs by mid-2001. Following a small protest by one group of minority workers, the Port Authority to hire consultants and create a committee to oversee the awarding of contracts. Despite the September 11 attacks later the same year, work on the project was not interrupted.
As part of the AirTrain&#x27;s construction, a renovation of the Jamaica LIRR station was announced in 2000. A $75 million renovation of the Howard Beach station was completed in May 2001, with an ADA-compliant transfer to and from the AirTrain. The same month, work started on the renovation of the Jamaica station, which entailed building a transfer passageway to the AirTrain; the Port Authority planned to spend $326 million on the AirTrain terminal and some work on the LIRR station at Jamaica. Though the Jamaica station&#x27;s rehabilitation was originally supposed to be finished by 2005, it was not completed until September 2006.
Service was originally planned to begin on the Howard Beach branch in October 2002, followed by the Jamaica branch in 2003, but the opening was delayed because of incidents during testing. In July 2002, three workers were injured during an AirTrain derailment. By the next month, the guideway, most of the stations and substations, and the rolling stock were complete, and test trains were running on the system. Bombardier employee Kelvin DeBourgh was piloting a test train with concrete ballast blocks when his train derailed in September 2002, causing the blocks to tilt forward and kill him. DeBourgh&#x27;s death prompted an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which found that the train had been speeding on a curve; in particular, it had been going as fast as on a segment of track that was meant to be traversed at . Further investigations found that DeBourgh&#x27;s supervisors had not correctly trained him.

The opening was postponed indefinitely as officials looked into the cause of the derailment that killed DeBourgh. In February 2003, the Port Authority announced that the system could open that June, although the opening was then delayed further. Work on the stations continued throughout early 2003, and the Port Authority resumed test runs of the system in April after its internal safety board found that DeBourgh&#x27;s death had not been caused by the system&#x27;s design. DeBourgh&#x27;s family sued the Port Authority and Bombardier in September 2003, as the new Jamaica terminal was being unveiled. At the time, the system was planned to open by the end of the year. The AirRail Transit Consortium said in November 2003 that it would open the entire system later that month, but this date was subsequently delayed to December 17. The latter date was chosen to mark the centennial of the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; maiden flight, as well as to accommodate increased air traffic for the Christmas and holiday season.

=== Opening and early years ===
The system opened on December 17, 2003, and was fare-free on its first day. According to &quot;Newsday&quot;, politicians were optimistic about the AirTrain, but travelers&#x27; enthusiasm was dampened by the fact that travelers had to transfer—though, the paper said, &quot;the stations where the schlepping will take place are polished and sleek&quot;. &quot;Newsday&quot;, which sent several reporters to test out whether the LIRR and AirTrain were faster than a car and a taxi, said the AirTrain was ideal for people &quot;looking for a modern ride removed from the stresses of the roadway&quot;. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; said that riders had mixed opinions of the new system. A writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that, while the system was superior to the bus routes that it replaced, the AirTrain was &quot;a complicated travel experience&quot; that required a transfer, necessitated an additional fare, and lacked adequate signage.

Southeast Queens residents feared the project could become a boondoggle, as the construction cost of the system had increased to $1.9 billion. This figure was $400 million over what had been budgeted for the system in 1999. Like other Port Authority properties, the AirTrain did not receive subsidies from the state or city for its operating costs. This was one of the reasons cited for the system&#x27;s relatively high initial $5 fare, which was more than twice the subway&#x27;s fare at the time of the AirTrain&#x27;s opening. The Port Authority predicted that the AirTrain&#x27;s opening would create 118 jobs at JFK Airport. &quot;Crain&#x27;s New York Business&quot; said in 2003 that the system&#x27;s opening and other upgrades at JFK Airport would allow the airport to accommodate 50 million annual passengers by 2007; by comparison, the airport had recorded 31.7 million travelers in 2003.

Early riders had difficulty finding the trains because navigational signs were still covered up. In its first month of service, the system experienced several outages, delays, and lower-than-expected ridership, and some travelers could not easily find the system because it was not shown on LIRR and subway maps. These issues had subsided by the AirTrain&#x27;s first anniversary, when Bombardier reported that the system had an uptime rate of between 97 and 99 percent.

==== Effects on development ====
Several projects were developed in Jamaica in anticipation of the system&#x27;s opening, and local civic leaders hoped the system would help revitalize downtown Jamaica. The Jamaica Center Mall, Joseph P. Addabbo Federal Building, the Civil Court, and a Food and Drug Administration laboratory and offices were all built in the five years before the AirTrain opened. As early as 2000, local leaders had envisioned hotels, offices, and parking around the AirTrain station in Jamaica. One development firm began constructing a office building at the site in 2001. Another project, a 250-room hotel above the AirTrain terminal, was deferred after the September 11 attacks. By mid-2003, a , 16-story building was being planned on Sutphin Boulevard across from the Jamaica station; this structure was the first building in a planned mixed-use development spanning .

After AirTrain JFK began operating, Jamaica saw a boom in commerce, and the area around Sutphin Boulevard in particular was expected to attract more business activity. A 15-screen movie theater opened in the area in early 2004, and developers were also planning a 13-floor building in the area. In 2004, the city proposed rezoning 40 blocks of Jamaica, centered around the AirTrain station, as a commercial area. According to the RPA, the rezoning was part of a proposal to re-envision Jamaica as a &quot;regional center&quot; because of the area&#x27;s high usage as a transit hub. During the average weekday, 100,000 LIRR riders and 53,000 subway riders traveled to or from Jamaica, and the Port Authority had estimated that the AirTrain JFK would carry 12.4 million passengers a year. The area was rezoned in September 2007, and the first development to be proposed in the rezoned area, a 13-story merchandise mart and showroom building, was announced the next month.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter wrote that the presence of AirTrain JFK riders was one factor in the redevelopment of downtown Jamaica, where, by 2011, three budget hotels had been developed near the Jamaica station. The area west of the Jamaica station was still underdeveloped, so many travelers chose to transfer to the LIRR or subway in Jamaica rather than stay there overnight.

==== Unbuilt extensions ====
Plans to extend the AirTrain to Manhattan were examined even before the system&#x27;s opening. In 1998, the Port Authority examined the possibility of reactivating the abandoned Rockaway Beach Branch, allowing LIRR trains to run from Manhattan directly onto the Howard Beach Branch. The RPA also published a report in 1999, in which it recommended the construction of new lines and stations for the New York City Subway. The plan included one service that would travel from Grand Central Terminal to JFK Airport via what eventually became the AirTrain. Ultimately, the MTA rejected the RPA&#x27;s proposal.

U.S. senator Chuck Schumer had proposed a direct rail link from JFK Airport to Manhattan&#x27;s Fulton Center the day the AirTrain opened. Between September 2003 and April 2004, several agencies, including the MTA and the Port Authority, conducted a feasibility study of the Lower Manhattan–Jamaica/JFK Transportation Project, which would allow trains to travel directly from JFK Airport to Manhattan. The study examined 40 alternatives, and four options for extending the AirTrain had been announced by early 2004. The project was halted in 2008 before an environmental impact statement could be created. Though a direct route to Grand Central was never built, the LIRR&#x27;s East Side Access project opened in 2023, connecting the East Side of Manhattan to the Jamaica station. However, passengers were still required to transfer between the LIRR and AirTrain at Jamaica.

=== Renovation of JFK Airport ===
On January 4, 2017, the office of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a $7–10 billion plan to renovate JFK Airport. As part of the project, the AirTrain JFK would either see lengthened trainsets or a direct track connection to the rest of New York City&#x27;s transportation system, and a direct connection between the AirTrain, LIRR, and subway would be built at Jamaica station. Shortly after Cuomo&#x27;s announcement, the Regional Plan Association published an unrelated study for a possible direct rail link between Manhattan and JFK Airport. Yet another study in September 2018, published by the MTA, examined alternatives for an LIRR rail link to JFK as part of a possible restoration of the abandoned Rockaway Beach Branch.

In July 2017, Cuomo&#x27;s office began accepting submissions for master plans to renovate the airport. A year later, in October 2018, Cuomo released details of the project, whose cost had grown to $13 billion. The improvements included lengthening AirTrains as well as adding lanes to the Van Wyck Expressway. The Terminal 2 station was closed on July 11, 2022, prior to the permanent closure of Terminal 2 six months later. To accommodate the reconstruction of Terminal 1, the PANYNJ closed the Terminal 1 station for seven months starting on May 1, 2023. The station was reopened in December 2023.

== System ==
=== Routes ===
AirTrain JFK connects the airport&#x27;s terminals and parking areas with the Howard Beach and Jamaica stations. It runs entirely within the New York City borough of Queens. The system consists of three routes: two connecting the terminals with either the Howard Beach or Jamaica stations, and one route looping continuously around the central terminal area. It is operated by Alstom (which purchased Bombardier in 2021) under contract to the Port Authority. Trains to and from Jamaica and Howard Beach were originally planned to run every two minutes during peak hours, with alternate trains traveling to each branch. The final environmental impact statement projected that trains in the central terminal area would run every ninety seconds. By 2014 actual frequencies were much lower: each branch was served by one train every seven to 12 minutes during peak hours. Trains arrived every 10 to 15 minutes on each branch during weekdays; every 15 to 20 minutes during late nights; and every 16 minutes during weekends.

The Howard Beach Train route (colored green on the official map) begins and ends at the Howard Beach–JFK Airport station, where there is a direct transfer to the New York City Subway&#x27;s . It makes an additional stop at Lefferts Boulevard, where passengers can transfer to parking lot shuttle buses; the Q3 bus to Jamaica; the B15 bus to Brooklyn; and the limited-stop Q10 bus. The segment from Howard Beach to Federal Circle, which is about long, passes over the long-term and employee parking lots.

The Jamaica Train route (colored red on the official map) begins and ends at the Jamaica station, adjacent to the Long Island Rail Road platforms there. The Jamaica station contains a connection to the Sutphin Boulevard–Archer Avenue–JFK Airport station on the New York City Subway&#x27;s . The AirTrain and LIRR stations contain transfers to the subway, as well as to ground-level bus routes. West of Jamaica, the line travels above the north side of 94th Avenue before curving southward onto the Van Wyck Expressway. The segment from Jamaica to Federal Circle is about long.

The Howard Beach Train and Jamaica Train routes merge at Federal Circle for car rental companies and shuttle buses to hotels and the airport&#x27;s cargo areas. South of Federal Circle, the routes share track for and enter a tunnel before the tracks separate in two directions for the terminal loop. Both routes continue counterclockwise around the loop, stopping at Terminals 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8 in that order. A connection to the Q3 local bus is available at Terminal 8. The travel time from either Jamaica or Howard Beach to the JFK terminals is about eight minutes.

The Airport Terminals Loop (colored gold on the official map), an airport terminal circulator, runs clockwise around each terminal, in the opposite direction from the Howard Beach Train and Jamaica Train routes. The terminal area loop is long.

=== Stations ===

All AirTrain JFK stations contain elevators and are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Each platform is long and can fit up to four cars. The stations include air conditioning, as well as platform screen doors that protect passengers and allow the unmanned trains to operate safely. Escalators and elevators are included in each station, and moving walkways are incorporated into the design of the terminal-area stations. Each station also contains safety systems such as CCTV cameras, alarms, and emergency contact points, and is staffed by attendants.

All the stations have island platforms except for Federal Circle, which has a bi-level split platform layout. The Jamaica and Howard Beach stations are designed as &quot;gateway stations&quot; to give passengers the impression of entering the airport. There are also stations at Lefferts Boulevard, as well as Terminals 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Three former terminals, numbered 3, 6, and 9, were respectively served by the stations that were later renamed Terminals 2, 5, and 8. The four stations outside the Central Terminal Area were originally designated with the letters A–D alongside their names; the letters were later dropped. After Terminal 2 station closed in 2022, Terminal 1 station temporarily served passengers for both terminals until the closure of Terminal 2 in January 2023.

STV Inc., the AirTrain&#x27;s main architectural and engineering designer, was tasked with creating a consistent design for the stations and infrastructure. The Jamaica station was designed by Voorsanger Architects, and Robert Davidson of the Port Authority&#x27;s in-house architecture department designed the Howard Beach station. Most stations in the airport are outdoors, but the Terminal 4 station is within the mezzanine of that terminal. The Jamaica station was designed with a footbridge leading from the AirTrain terminal above the LIRR tracks to the subway, as well as space for a hotel on top of it. Each station&#x27;s construction was divided into nine components (such as connections to parking garages), and construction materials were customized to the specific needs of each station site.

=== Tracks and infrastructure ===
The AirTrain has a route length of . The system consists of or of single-track guideway viaducts, as well as of double-track guideway viaducts. AirTrain JFK is mostly elevated, though there are short segments that run underground or at ground level, totaling about . Trains are operated from and maintained at a train yard between Lefferts Boulevard and Federal Circle, atop a former employee parking lot.

The elevated sections were built with precast single and dual guideway spans, the underground sections used cut-and-cover. The ground-level sections, including the train yards, used concrete ties and ballast trackbeds. The single guideway viaducts carry one track each and are wide, while the double guideway viaducts carry two tracks each and are wide. Columns support the precast concrete elevated sections at intervals of up to . The elevated structures run up to 40 feet above the Van Wyck Expressway. Workers fabricated 5,500 precast concrete sections in Cape Charles, Virginia, which were then shipped to Camden, New Jersey, before being installed in Queens. The elevated structures use seismic isolation bearings and soundproof barriers to protect from small earthquakes as well as prevent noise pollution. AirTrain JFK&#x27;s tunnels, all within the airport, pass beneath two taxiways and several highway ramps.

The AirTrain runs on steel tracks that are continuously welded across all joints except at the terminals; the guideway viaducts are also continuously joined. Trains use double crossovers at the Jamaica and Howard Beach terminals in order to switch to the track going in the opposite direction. There are also crossover switches north and south of Federal Circle, counterclockwise from Terminal 8, and clockwise from Terminal 1.

The tracks are set at a gauge of . This enables possible future conversion to LIRR or subway use, or a possible connection to LIRR or subway tracks for a one-trip ride into Manhattan, since these systems use the same track gauge. AirTrain&#x27;s current rolling stock, or train cars, are not able to use either LIRR or subway tracks due to the cars&#x27; inadequate structural strength and the different methods of propulsion used on each system. In particular, the linear induction motor system that propels the AirTrain vehicles is incompatible with the traction motor manual-propulsion system used by LIRR and subway rolling stock. If a one-seat ride is ever implemented, a hybrid-use vehicle would be needed to operate on subway or LIRR tracks in addition to AirTrain tracks.

There are seven electrical substations. The redundancy allows trains to operate even if there are power outages at one substation. Since there are no emergency exits between stations, a control tower can automatically guide the train to its next stop in case of an emergency.

== Fares ==

AirTrain JFK is free to use for travel within the terminal area, as well as at the Lefferts Boulevard station, which is next to the long-term parking, and at the Federal Circle station, where there are shuttle buses to hotels and car rental companies. Passengers entering or leaving the system at the Jamaica or Howard Beach stations must pay using MetroCard or OMNY. AirTrain JFK started accepting OMNY on October 10, 2023, although only some turnstiles initially had OMNY readers.

AirTrain JFK charges passengers $8.50 to enter or leave the system at the Jamaica and Howard Beach stations. MetroCard vending machines are located on both sides of the faregates at each station, and a $1 fee is charged for new MetroCards. In addition to single ride fares, machines also sell passes for AirTrain JFK. A 30-Day AirTrain JFK MetroCard can be purchased for $40 and used for unlimited rides for 30 days after first use. A 10-Trip AirTrain JFK MetroCard is $26.50 (plus $1 for the card) and can be used for ten trips on the AirTrain within 31 days from first use.

There are no free transfers between AirTrain JFK and connecting transit services. For passengers transferring to local buses or the subway, an additional $2.90 fare is charged, and may be paid with MetroCard. Patrons transferring to a Manhattan-bound LIRR train at Jamaica pay an additional $7 during peak hours or $5 during off-peak hours and weekends, using the railroad&#x27;s CityTicket program.

The fare to enter or exit at Howard Beach and Jamaica was originally $5, though preliminary plans included a discounted fare of $2 for airport and airline employees. In June 2019, the Port Authority proposed raising AirTrain JFK&#x27;s fare to $7.75, and the fare increase was approved that September. The new fares took effect on November 1, 2019, representing the first fare raise in the system&#x27;s history. In November 2021, the Port Authority discussed plans to raise the fare a second time, to $8; this fare increase took effect on March 1, 2022. The fare was increased once more to $8.25 on March 5, 2023, then to $8.50 on March 3, 2024. From July 1 through September 2, 2024, fares were reduced by 50% to $4.25 due to road construction at JFK Airport.

== Rolling stock ==

AirTrain JFK uses Innovia Metro ART 200 rolling stock and technology, similar to those used on the SkyTrain in Vancouver, the Everline in Yongin, and the Kelana Jaya Line in Kuala Lumpur. The computerized trains are fully automated and use a communications-based train control system with moving block signals to dynamically determine the locations of the trains. AirTrain JFK is a wholly driverless system, and it uses SelTrac train-signaling technology manufactured by Thales Group. The system originally used pre-recorded announcements by New York City traffic reporter Bernie Wagenblast, a longtime Port Authority employee.

The 32 individual, non-articulated Mark II vehicles operating on the line draw power from a 750 V DC top-running third rail. A linear induction motor pushes magnetically against an aluminum strip in the center of the track. The vehicles also have steerable trucks that can navigate sharp curves and steep grades, as well as align precisely with the platform doors at the stations. The cars can run at up to , and they can operate on trackage with a minimum railway curve radius of .

Each car is long and wide, similar to the dimensions of the rolling stock used on the New York City Subway&#x27;s B Division. Trains can run in either direction and can consist of between one and four cars. The cars have two pairs of doors on each side; each door opening is wide. An individual car has 26 seats and can carry up to 97 passengers with luggage, or 205 without luggage. Because most passengers carry luggage, the actual operating capacity is between 75 and 78 passengers per car.

== Ridership ==
When AirTrain JFK was being planned, it was expected that 11,000 passengers per day would pay to ride the system between the airport and either Howard Beach or Jamaica, evenly split between employees and airline passengers. Projections also showed that 23,000 more daily passengers would use the AirTrain to travel between terminals. This would amount to about 4 million paying passengers and 8.4 million in-airport passengers per year. According to the FEIS, the system could accommodate over 3,000 daily riders from Manhattan, and its opening would result in approximately 75,000 fewer vehicle miles ( kilometers) being driven each day. The Port Authority&#x27;s research showed that, when the system opened, eight percent of its riders would be from Long Island, while up to 70 percent would travel from Manhattan.

During the first month of service, between 15,000 and 20,000 passengers rode the system each day, less than the expected daily ridership of 34,000. Nonetheless, the AirTrain JFK had become the second-busiest airport transportation system in the United States. Within its first six months, AirTrain JFK had transported one million riders; this had increased to 2.5 million by the first anniversary of the AirTrain. By the end of 2004, the system had about 8,000 or 8,500 paying riders per day, although only 1,500 of these riders were employees. The Jamaica route had 4,500 paying riders, making it slightly more popular than the Howard Beach route, which had 4,000 paying riders. Paid ridership had reached 11,000 per day by 2006, when one in nine people flying to or from JFK used the AirTrain.

In the decade after the AirTrain opened, it consistently experienced year-over-year ridership growth. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article in 2009 observed that one possible factor in the AirTrain&#x27;s increasing ridership was the $7.75 fare for AirTrain and subway, which was cheaper than the $52 taxi ride between Manhattan and JFK. In 2019, there were 8.7 million passengers who paid to travel between JFK Airport and either Howard Beach or Jamaica. This represented an increase of more than 300 percent from the 2.6 million riders who paid during the first full year of operation, 2004. An additional 12.2 million people were estimated to have ridden the AirTrain for free in 2019, placing total annual ridership at 20.9 million. Amid a decline in air travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the AirTrain had 3.4 million total riders in 2021. In , the system carried a total of passengers, or about per weekday as of .

<text>Pocket Books is a division of Simon &amp; Schuster that primarily publishes paperback books.

== History ==
Pocket Books produced the first mass-market, pocket-sized paperback books in the United States in early 1939 and revolutionized the publishing industry. The German Albatross Books had pioneered the idea of a line of color-coded paperback editions in 1931 under Kurt Enoch, and Penguin Books in Britain had refined the idea in 1935 and had one million books in print by the following year.

Pocket Books was founded by Richard L. Simon, M. Lincoln (&quot;Max&quot;) Schuster and Leon Shimkin, partners of Simon &amp; Schuster, along with Robert Fair de Graff.

Penguin&#x27;s success inspired entrepreneur Robert F. de Graff, who partnered with publishers Simon &amp; Schuster to bring it to the American market. Priced at 25 cents and featuring the logo of Gertrude the kangaroo (named after the mother-in-law of the artist, Frank Lieberman), Pocket Books&#x27; editorial policy of reprints of light literature, popular non-fiction, and mysteries was coordinated with its strategy of selling books outside the traditional distribution channels. The small format size, 4.25&quot; by 6.5&quot; (10.8 cm by 16.5 cm) and the fact that the books were glued rather than stitched, were cost-cutting innovations.

The first ten numbered Pocket Book titles published in May 1939 with a print run of about 10,000 copies each:
# &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; by James Hilton
# &quot;Wake Up and Live&quot; by Dorothea Brande
# &quot;Five Great Tragedies&quot; by William Shakespeare
# &quot;Topper&quot; by Thorne Smith
# &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; by Agatha Christie
# &quot;Enough Rope&quot; by Dorothy Parker
# &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; by Emily Brontë
# &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot; by Samuel Butler
# &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; by Thornton Wilder
# &quot;Bambi&quot; by Felix Salten

This list includes seven novels, the most recent being six years old (&quot;Lost Horizons&quot;, 1933), two classics (Shakespeare and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, both out of copyright), one mystery novel, one book of poetry (&quot;Enough Rope&quot;), and one self-help book.

The edition of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; hit the bestseller list, and by the end of the first week sold out of its initial 100,000 copy run. By the end of the year Pocket Books had sold more than 1.5 million units. Robert de Graff continued to refine his selections with movie tie-ins and greater emphasis on mystery novels, particularly those of Christie and Erle Stanley Gardner.

Pocket and its imitators thrived during World War II because material shortages worked to their advantage. During the war, Pocket sued Avon Books for copyright infringement: among other issues, a New York state court found Pocket did not have an exclusive right to the pocket-sized format (both Pocket and Avon published paperback editions of Leslie Charteris&#x27; &quot;The Saint&quot; mystery series, among others).

In 1944, the founding owners sold the company to Marshall Field III, owner of the &quot;Chicago Sun&quot; newspaper. Following Field&#x27;s death in 1957, Leon Shimkin, a Simon &amp; Schuster partner, and James M. Jacobson bought Pocket Books for $5 million. Simon &amp; Schuster acquired Pocket in 1966.

Phyllis E. Grann who would later become the first woman CEO of a major publishing firm was promoted to run Pocket Books under then CEO Richard E. Snyder. Grann left for Putnam in 1976.

In 1981, Dr. Benjamin Spock&#x27;s &quot;Baby and Child Care&quot; was listed as their top seller, having sold 28 million copies at that time and having been acquired in 1946.

In 1989, &quot;The Dieter&quot; by Susan Sussman became the first hardcover published by Pocket Books.

Pocket was for many years known for publishing works of popular fiction based on movies or TV series, such as the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise (owned by former corporate siblings CBS Television Studios and Paramount Pictures). Since first obtaining the &quot;Star Trek&quot; license from Bantam Books in 1979 (with a publication of the novelization of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;), Pocket has published hundreds of original and adapted works based upon the franchise and continues to publish a new novel every month. Beginning in 2017 with novels based on &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, the Star Trek novel lines have gradually moved to Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s Gallery Books line.

Pocket also previously published novels based on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The author credited for one of the Buffy products is Gertrude Pocket, a reference to the company&#x27;s kangaroo logo. (The Buffy novels are now published by Simon Spotlight Entertainment, another division of Simon &amp; Schuster.) Pocket Books is also the division that currently owns publication rights to the well-known work of James O&#x27;Barr, &quot;The Crow&quot;.

<text>The Barrett XM109, originally known as the Objective Sniper Weapon (OSW) and now called the Anti-Materiel Payload Rifle (AMPR), is a prototype anti-materiel sniper rifle. It is chambered for 25 × 59 mm grenade rounds and was developed by Barrett Firearms Manufacturing. It was designed in accordance with a requirement set out in 1994, and is capable of defeating light armor and equipment out to .

==History==
Prototypes of the XM109 have existed since the late 1990s and studies of the weapon&#x27;s effectiveness were released in 2002; 10 prototypes were known to exist in 2004, and the XM109 and Barrett XM500 were folded into a broader Anti-Material Rifle Congressional Program in 2006. The current status of the XM109 is not clear, with no news of either cancellation or potential adoption.

==Overview==
The XM109, originally known as the Objective Sniper Weapon (OSW) and now called the Anti-Materiel Payload Rifle (AMPR), is a semi-automatic anti-materiel rifle, designed primarily for engagement of light armored vehicles and similar targets. The design uses the lower receiver from an M82/M107, but with a new upper receiver chambered in 25mm. The upper receiver of the M82 rifles can be replaced with an XM109 upper receiver to form a fully functional XM109 rifle.
The 25 × 59 mm round that is used in the XM109 is the same one originally developed for the cancelled XM307, product of the Objective (later Advanced) Crew Served Weapon program (OCSW / ACSW). As with the XM307, the XM109 can be reconfigured back to .50 BMG, in the XM109&#x27;s case this is done by swapping the 25mm upper receiver for a standard M82 / M107 upper.

The XM109 offers greater range and a shorter overall length than the previous M82/M107 systems, as well as potentially greater power in the 25 × 59 mm cartridge over even the Mk 211 .50 BMG cartridge (AKA &quot;Raufoss round&quot;). However, the small amount of propellant and heavy projectile resulted in unacceptably high recoil due to limiting the effects of the weapon&#x27;s muzzle brake, with a recoil force of over 60 foot-pounds compared to 36 for the M107. As of 2004, one of the project goals was to reduce the weapon&#x27;s recoil.

==Features==
*Picatinny rail
*BORS ballistic computer
*Monopod socket
*Dual-chamber detachable muzzle brake or suppressor system
*Detachable bipod and carry handle

<doc id="959434" wikidata="Q1826452" url="?curid=959434" title="AirTrain (San Francisco International Airport)">
<text>AirTrain is a fully automated people mover at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) that opened on February 24, 2003. It operates 24 hours a day on two separate lines, covering a total of . The service charges no fares; it is funded by a fee charged to rental car customers. The system is located outside of the sterile area of each terminal, meaning passengers must exit and re-enter through a security checkpoint when using AirTrain to travel between terminals.

== Lines and stations ==

AirTrain operates on two lines—Red Line and Blue Line—both of which run every four minutes. The Red Line travels in a clockwise loop around the central terminal area, which takes about nine minutes to complete. The Blue Line travels in a counterclockwise loop, serving the same stations in reverse order, and also proceeding to West Field Road, the Rental Car Center, and long-term parking, which takes 25 minutes for a round trip.


The AirTrain stations at the International Terminal are located one level above ticketing, at both ends of the main hall. Stations at Terminals 1, 2, and 3 are located on level 5 of the domestic parking garage and can be accessed from mezzanine-level skybridges located near security checkpoints B, D, and F. The Garage A and G stations are accessible from level 7 of each garage. The long-term parking station is connected by a skybridge to level 5 of the long-term parking garage.

== Technical details ==

The AirTrain system was built by Bombardier Transportation at a cost of US $430 million and is composed of 38 Innovia APM 100 cars coupled in trains of up to three cars. The APM 100 cars can also be found at airports in Tampa, Denver, Atlanta, Seattle-Tacoma, Houston, and Madrid. They are operated automatically under Bombardier&#x27;s Cityflo 650 Communications-based train control signaling technology, making it one of the first radio-based train control systems to enter service. The entire AirTrain fleet is accessible and allows rented baggage carts on board.

The Airport Development Plan from 2016 forecasted that ridership on the two lines would be over capacity in the future (42% and 87% over capacity on the Red and Blue Lines respectively) and recommended upgrades that would increase capacity. Specific upgrades included acquiring 30 additional AirTrain cars, upgrading existing stations to accommodate 4-car trains, and upgrading the maintenance facility to accommodate additional vehicles.

==History==
A $15 million infill station was constructed to serve the Grand Hyatt at SFO, a new airport hotel. The hotel opened on October 7, 2019.

AirTrain did not originally provide access to SFO&#x27;s long-term parking garage and lots; instead, passengers had to take a free airport shuttle bus between the airport terminals and the long-term parking areas. The original end of the track past the Rental Car Center station was only about away from the airport&#x27;s long-term parking garage; an extension to the garage began service in May 2021, replacing the shuttle buses. The extension is estimated to eliminate previously driven by the shuttle buses each year.

The Harvey Milk Terminal 1 station was closed from July 2021 to April 26, 2023, during reconstruction of the terminal.

<text>Michael Winter (born 1965) is a Canadian writer, the author of five novels and three collections of short stories.

==Life and career==
Michael Winter was born in 1965 in Jarrow, England. His father was an industrial arts teacher, who moved the family to Newfoundland, Canada three years later, eventually settling in Corner Brook. After high school, Winter attended Memorial University, graduating in 1986 with a BA in economic geography.

Winter&#x27;s first short story collection, &quot;Creaking in Their Skins&quot;, was published in 1994. In 1999, editor John Metcalf at The Porcupine&#x27;s Quill published his second book of stories, &quot;One Last Good Look&quot;. Winter moved to Toronto in 1999, where he published his first two novels: &quot;This All Happened&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Big Why&quot; (2004).

Much of Winter&#x27;s fiction chronicles the life and adventures of his fictional alter ego, Gabriel English. &quot;This All Happened&quot;, for example, is organized as a fictional diary, with 365 entries describing Gabriel&#x27;s life in St. John&#x27;s, his relationship with filmmaker Lydia Murphy, and the progress of the novel he is trying to write. The book was nominated for the 2000 Rogers Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize and won the inaugural Winterset Award.

&quot;The Big Why&quot; was a historical novel narrated by real-life American artist Rockwell Kent describing the time he spent in Brigus, Newfoundland, in 1914. Kent was eventually deported from Newfoundland on suspicion of being a German spy.

Winter was one of the judges of the 2006 Giller Prize, and his line drawings illustrate Noah Richler&#x27;s &quot;This is My Country, What&#x27;s Yours? A Literary Atlas of Canada&quot; (2006). He serialized short teasers for each chapter of his third novel, &quot;The Architects are Here&quot; (2007), on Facebook.

&quot;The Death of Donna Whalen&quot; (2010), his fourth novel, is described by the author as &quot;documentary fiction&quot;. It uses court documents, transcripts and other material to tell the story of Donna Whalen, a St. John&#x27;s woman stabbed to death, possibly by her boyfriend Sheldon Troke. The book is based on the 1993 murder of Brenda Young.

He divides his time between Toronto and Newfoundland, and is the brother of novelist Kathleen Winter.

==Critical commentary==
Winter&#x27;s novels and short stories have been described as having &quot;a free-flowing, vibrant dialogue, presented without quotation marks. His characters&#x27; speech ranges from contemplative and meandering to rapid fire and piercing.&quot;

Lynn Coady, reviewing &quot;The Death of Donna Whalen&quot;, wrote that Winter&#x27;s use of documentary material &quot;shows amazing faith in the power of story itself, the sheer ability of raw human character to transfix us. In stepping back from centre stage and turning the spotlight entirely on this devastating array of intersecting lives and deaths, Winter has enacted some of the most powerful storytelling of his career.&quot;

<text>Bui Simon (born Porntip Nakhirunkanok (; ; ); February 7, 1969) is a Thai philanthropist and beauty queen who won Miss Universe 1988. Simon is president and founder of the Angels Wings Foundation. She is on the Board of Regents of Pepperdine University, the Board of the Children&#x27;s Museum of Indianapolis as a Distinguished Advisor and also is on the Board of Governors for the Dream Foundation.

==Biography==
Porntip Nakhirunkanok was born in Bangkok, Thailand. Her nickname is &quot;Bui&quot; (, , ), which is her preferred name. It means &quot;to sleep like a baby&quot; in Thai. In the early 70&#x27;s, she was brought to the United States by her family. She attended Washington Irving Middle School and Franklin High School in Los Angeles. In August 1988, Nakhirunkanok was presented the Thai Royal Medal of Honour, Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant, by King Bhumibol Adulyadej for her service in helping children in need. She received a second Royal Decoration in 2001, Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand.

In 1989, she was named United Nations Goodwill Ambassador of Thailand by Air Chief Marshal Siddhi Savetsila, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Thailand. As Goodwill Ambassador, she addressed the UN General Assembly concerning the Convention on the Rights of the Child. She graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology from Pepperdine University.

In 2002, she married Herbert Simon, an American businessman who is the owner of the Indiana Pacers basketball team and Simon Property Group. The home she and her family had lived in, and all belongings, were destroyed in the January 2025 Southern California wildfires.

==Pageantry==
In 1983, at the age of 15, Simon took part in the Miss California Teen USA where she was placed first runner-up. Upon her return to Thailand, she participated in the 1988 Miss Thailand pageant held in Bangkok where she won the right to represent Thailand at the Miss Universe pageant.

Aged 19, Simon was crowned as Miss Universe 1988 by outgoing titleholder Cecilia Bolocco on May 24, 1988, in Taipei, Taiwan. She became the second Thai woman to win the title after Apasra Hongsakula who won Miss Universe 1965. Simon became the first woman ever to win both the Miss Universe and Best National Costume award in one pageant. At the time of Miss Universe 1988, Simon weighed , and stood at . Simon crowned her successor, Angela Visser of the Netherlands, at Miss Universe 1989 in Cancun, Mexico.

<doc id="959455" wikidata="Q219915" url="?curid=959455" title="Zone System">
<text>The Zone System is a photographic technique for determining optimal film exposure and development, formulated by Ansel Adams and Fred Archer. Adams described the Zone System as &quot;[...] not an invention of mine; it is a codification of the principles of sensitometry, worked out by Fred Archer and myself at the Art Center School in Los Angeles, around 1939–40.&quot;

The technique is based on the late 19th-century sensitometry studies of Hurter and Driffield. The Zone System provides photographers with a systematic method of precisely defining the relationship between the way they visualize the photographic subject and the final results. Although it originated with black-and-white sheet film, the Zone System is also applicable to roll film, both black-and-white and color, negative and reversal, and to digital photography.

== Principles ==

=== Visualization ===

An expressive image involves the arrangement and rendering of various scene elements according to the photographer&#x27;s desire. Achieving the desired image involves &quot;image management&quot; (placement of the camera, choice of lens, and possibly the use of camera movements) and control of &quot;image values&quot;. The Zone System is concerned with the control of image values, ensuring that light and dark values are rendered as desired. Anticipation of the final result before making the exposure is known as &quot;visualization&quot;.

=== Exposure metering ===

Any scene of photographic interest contains elements of different luminance; consequently, the &quot;exposure&quot; actually is many different exposures. The exposure time is the same for all elements, but the image illuminance varies with the luminance of each subject element.

Exposure is often determined using a reflected-light exposure meter. The earliest meters measured overall average luminance; meter calibration was established to give satisfactory exposures for typical outdoor scenes. However, if the part of a scene that is metered includes large areas of unusually high or low reflectance, or unusually large areas of highlight or shadow, the &quot;effective&quot; average reflectance
may differ substantially from that of a &quot;typical&quot; scene, and the rendering may not be as desired.

An averaging meter cannot distinguish between a subject of uniform luminance and one that consists of light and dark elements. When exposure is determined from average luminance measurements, the exposure of any given scene element depends on the relationship of its reflectance to the effective average reflectance. For example, a dark object of 4% reflectance would be given a different exposure in a scene of 20% effective average reflectance than it would be given in a scene of 12% reflectance. In a sunlit outdoor scene, the exposure for the dark object would also depend on whether the object was in sunlight or shade. Depending on the scene and the photographer&#x27;s objective, any of the previous exposures might be acceptable. However, in some situations, the photographer might wish to specifically control the rendering of the dark object; with overall average metering, this is difficult if not impossible. When it is important to control the rendering of specific scene elements, alternative metering techniques may be required.

It is possible to make a meter reading of an individual scene element, but the exposure indicated by the meter will render that element as a medium gray; in the case of a dark object, that result is usually not what is desired. Even when metering individual scene elements, some adjustment of the indicated exposure is often needed if the metered scene element is to be rendered as visualized.

=== Exposure zones ===

In the Zone System, measurements are made of individual scene elements, and exposure is adjusted based on the photographer&#x27;s knowledge of what is being metered: a photographer knows the difference between freshly fallen snow and a black horse, while a meter does not. Much has been written on the Zone System, but the concept is very simple—render light subjects as light, and dark subjects as dark, according to the photographer&#x27;s visualization. The Zone System assigns numbers from 0 through 10
to different brightness values, with 0 representing black, 5 middle gray, and 10 pure white; these values are known as &quot;zones&quot;. To make zones easily distinguishable from other quantities, Adams and Archer used Roman rather than Arabic numerals. Strictly speaking, zones refer to exposure, with a Zone V exposure (the meter indication) resulting in a mid-tone rendering in the final image. Each zone differs from the preceding or following zone by a factor of two, so that a Zone I exposure is twice that of Zone 0, and so forth. A one-zone change is equal to one stop,
corresponding to standard aperture and shutter controls on a camera. Evaluating a scene is particularly easy with a meter that indicates in exposure value (EV), because a change of one EV is equal to a change of one zone.

Many small- and medium-format cameras include provision for exposure compensation; this feature works well with the Zone System, especially if the camera includes spot metering, but obtaining proper results requires careful metering of individual scene elements and making appropriate adjustments.

=== Zones, the physical world and the print ===

The relationship between the physical scene and the print is established by characteristics of the negative and the print.
Exposure and development of the negative are usually determined so that a properly exposed negative will yield an acceptable print on a specific photographic paper.

Although zones directly relate to exposure, visualization relates to the final result. A black-and-white photographic print represents the visual world as a series of tones ranging from black to white. Imagine all of the tonal values that can appear in a print, represented as a continuous gradation from black to white:

From this starting point, zones are formed by first dividing the tonal gradation into ten equal sections, all one stop apart, plus one more for blown-out paper white.

:Note: &quot;The darker shades may not be distinguishable on some monitors.&quot;
Then for each section, one average tone represents all the tonal values in that section.

Finally, the zones are defined by numbering each section with Roman numerals from 0 for the black section to X for the white one.
=== Zones as tone and texture ===

Adams (1981, 52) distinguished among three different exposure scales for the negative:

* The full range from black to white, represented by Zone 0 through Zone X.
* The &quot;dynamic range&quot; comprising Zone I through Zone IX, which Adams considered to represent the darkest and lightest &quot;useful&quot; negative densities.
* The &quot;textural range&quot; comprising Zone II through Zone VIII. This range of zones conveys a sense of texture and the recognition of substance.

He noted that negatives can record detail through Zone XII and even higher, but that bringing this information within the exposure scale of the print is extremely difficult with normal processing.

Adams (1981, 60) described the zone scale and its relationship to typical scene elements:
For cinematography, in general, parts of the scene falling in Zone III will have textured black, and objects on Zone VII will have textured white. In other words, if the text on a piece of white paper is to be readable, light and expose the white so that it falls on Zone VII. This is a rule of thumb. Some film stocks have steeper curves than others, and the cinematographer needs to know how each one handles all shades of black-to-white.

== Technique ==

=== Effective film speed ===

The ISO standard for black-and-white negative film, ISO 6:1993, specifies development criteria that may differ from those used in practical photography (previous standards, such as ANSI PH2.5-1979, also specified chemistry and development technique). Consequently, the Zone System practitioner often must determine the speed for a particular combination of film, developer, and enlarger type; the speed determination is commonly based on Zone I. Although the method for determining speed for the Zone System is conceptually similar to the ISO method for determining speed, the Zone System speed is an &quot;effective speed&quot;
rather than an ISO speed.

=== Exposure ===

A dark surface under a bright light can reflect the same amount of light as a light surface under dim light. The human eye would perceive the two as being very different but a light meter would measure only the amount of light reflected, and its recommended exposure would render either as Zone V. The Zone System provides a straightforward method for rendering these objects as the photographer desires. The key element in the scene is identified, and that element is &quot;placed&quot; on the desired zone; the other elements in the scene then &quot;fall&quot; where they may. With negative film, exposure often favors shadow detail; the procedure then is to

# Visualize the darkest area of the subject in which detail is required, and place it on Zone III. The exposure for Zone III is important, because if the exposure is insufficient, the image may not have satisfactory shadow detail. If the shadow detail is not recorded at the time of exposure, nothing can be done to add it later.
# Carefully meter the area visualized as Zone III and note the meter&#x27;s recommended exposure (the meter gives a Zone V exposure).
# Adjust the recommended exposure so that the area is placed on Zone III rather than Zone V. To do this, use an exposure two stops less than the meter&#x27;s recommendation.

=== Development ===

For every combination of film, developer, and paper there is a &quot;normal&quot; development time that will allow a properly exposed negative to give a reasonable print. In many cases, this means that values in the print will display as recorded (e.g. Zone V as Zone V, Zone VI as Zone VI, and so on). In general, optimal negative development will be different for every type and grade of paper.

It is often desirable for a print to exhibit a full range of tonal values; this may not be possible for a low-contrast scene if the negative is given normal development. However, the development can be increased to increase the negative contrast so that the full range of tones is available. This technique is known as &quot;expansion&quot;, and the development usually referred to as &quot;plus&quot; or &quot;N+&quot;. Criteria for plus development vary among different photographers; Adams used it to &quot;raise&quot; a Zone VII placement to Zone VIII in the print, and referred to it as &quot;N + 1&quot; development.

Conversely, if the negative for a high-contrast scene is given normal development, desired detail may be lost in either shadow or highlight areas, and the result may appear harsh. However, development can be reduced so that a scene element placed on Zone IX is rendered as Zone VIII in the print; this technique is known as &quot;contraction&quot;, and the development usually referred to as &quot;minus&quot; or &quot;N−&quot;. When the resulting change is one zone, it is usually called &quot;N − 1&quot; development.

It sometimes is possible to make greater adjustments, using &quot;N + 2&quot; or &quot;N − 2&quot; development, and occasionally even beyond.

Development has the greatest effect on dense areas of the negative, so that the high values can be adjusted with minimal effect on the low values. The effect of expansion or contraction gradually decreases with tones darker than Zone VIII (or whatever value is used for control of high values).

Specific times for N+ or N− developments are determined either from systematic tests, or from development tables provided by certain Zone System books.

=== Additional darkroom processes ===

Adams generally used selenium toning when processing prints. Selenium toner acts as a preservative and can alter the color of a print, but Adams used it subtly, primarily because it can add almost a full zone to the tonal range of the final print, producing richer dark tones that still hold shadow detail. His book &quot;The Print&quot; described using the techniques of dodging and burning to selectively darken or lighten areas of the final print.

The Zone System requires that every variable in photography, from exposure to darkroom production of the print, be calibrated and controlled. The print is the last link in a chain of events, no less important to the Zone System than exposure and development of the film. With practice, the photographer visualizes the final print before the shutter is released.

== Application to other media ==

=== Roll film ===

Unlike sheet film, in which each negative can be individually developed, an entire roll must be given the same development, so that N+ and N− development are normally unavailable.
The key element in the scene is placed on the desired zone, and the rest of the scene falls where it will. Some contrast control is still available with the use of different paper grades. Adams (1981, 93–95) described use of the Zone System with roll film. In most cases, he recommended N − 1 development when a single roll was to be exposed under conditions of varying contrast, so that exposure could be sufficient to give adequate shadow detail but avoid excessive density and grain build-up in the highlights.

=== Color film ===

Because of color shifts, color film usually does not lend itself to variations in development time. Use of the Zone System with color film is similar to that with black-and-white roll film, except that the exposure range is somewhat less, so that there are fewer zones between black and white. The exposure scale of color reversal film is less than that of color negative film, and the procedure for exposure usually is different, favoring highlights rather than shadows; the shadow values then fall where they will. Whatever the exposure range, the meter indication results in a Zone V placement. Adams (1981, 95–97) described the application to color film, both negative and reversal.

=== Digital photography ===

The Zone System can be used in digital photography just as in film photography; Adams (1981, xiii) himself anticipated the digital image. As with color reversal film, the normal procedure is to expose for the highlights and process for the shadows.

Until recently, digital sensors had a much narrower dynamic range than color negative film, which, in turn, has less range than monochrome film. But an increasing number of digital cameras have achieved wider dynamic ranges. One of the first was Fujifilm&#x27;s FinePix S3 Pro digital SLR (released in 2004), which has their proprietary &quot;Super CCD SR sensor&quot; specifically developed to overcome the issue of limited dynamic range, using interstitial low-sensitivity photosites (pixels) to capture highlight details. The CCD is thus able to expose at both low and high sensitivities within one shot by assigning a honeycomb of pixels to different intensities of light.

Greater scene contrast can be accommodated by making one or more exposures of the same scene using different exposure settings and then combining those images. It often suffices to make two exposures, one for the shadows, and one for the highlights; the images are then overlapped and blended appropriately, so that the resulting composite represents a wider range of colors and tones. Combining images is often easier if the image-editing software includes features, such as the automatic layer alignment in Adobe Photoshop, that assist precise registration of multiple images. Even greater scene contrast can be handled by using more than two exposures and combining with a feature such as Merge to HDR in Photoshop CS2 and later. A simplified approach has been adopted by Apple Inc. as a selectable HDR option in later versions of the iPhone.

The tonal range of the final image depends on the characteristics of the display medium. Monitor contrast can vary significantly, depending on the type (CRT, LCD, etc.), model, and calibration (or lack thereof). A computer printer&#x27;s tonal output depends on the number of inks used and the paper on which it is printed. Similarly, the density range of a traditional photographic print depends on the processes used as well as the paper characteristics.

==== Histograms ====

Most high-end digital cameras allow viewing a histogram of the tonal distribution of the captured image. This histogram, which shows the concentration of tones, running from dark on the left to light on the right, can be used to judge whether a full tonal range has been captured, or whether the exposure should be adjusted, such as by changing the exposure time, lens aperture, or ISO speed, to ensure a tonally rich starting image.

== Misconceptions and criticisms ==

The Zone System gained an early reputation for being complex, difficult to understand, and impractical to apply to real-life shooting situations and equipment.

Criticism has been raised on grounds that the Zone System obscures simple densitometry considerations by needlessly introducing its own terminology for otherwise trivial concepts. Noted photographer Andreas Feininger wrote in 1976,

Much of the difficulty may have resulted from Adams&#x27;s early books, which he wrote without the assistance of a professional editor; he later conceded (Adams 1985, 325) that this was a mistake. Fred Picker (The Zone VI Workshop 1974) provided a concise and simple treatment that helped demystify the process. Adams&#x27;s later Photography Series published in the early 1980s (and written with the assistance of Robert Baker) also proved far more comprehensible to the average photographer.

The Zone System has often been thought to apply only to certain materials, such as black-and-white sheet film and black-and-white photographic prints. At a time when introduction of electronic still image cameras to the consumer market was imminent (e.g. the Sony Mavica), Adams (1981, xii) stated

which is sometimes interpreted as evidence that Adams envisioned his Zone System to be useful for electronic or even digital image capture/processing. However, in this quotation there is no claim that the Zone System would be a suitable instrument to comprehend and control the new imaging devices, and Adams explicitly states that electronic systems may have their own characteristics (which might thus require different approaches).

Yet another misconception is that the Zone System emphasizes technique at the expense of creativity. Some practitioners have treated the Zone System as if it were an end in itself, but Adams made it clear that the Zone System was an &quot;enabling&quot; technique rather than the ultimate objective.

<text>Łapanka (; English: &quot;roundup&quot; or &quot;catching&quot;) was the Polish name for a World War II practice in German-occupied Poland, whereby the German SS, Wehrmacht and Gestapo rounded up civilians on the streets of Polish cities. The civilians arrested were in most cases chosen at random from among passers-by or inhabitants of city quarters surrounded by German forces prior to the action.

The term usually refers to the action of rounding up and arresting a number of random people. Those caught in a &quot;łapanka&quot; were either taken hostage, arrested, sent to labor camps or concentration camps, or summarily executed.

Those caught in roundups were most often sent to slave labour in Nazi Germany, but some were also taken as hostages or executed in reprisal actions; imprisoned and sent to concentration camps or summarily executed in numerous ethnic-cleansing operations.

==History==
The term &quot;łapanka&quot;, derived from the Polish verb &quot;łapać&quot; (&quot;to catch&quot;), carried a sardonic connotation due to the prior use of the word &quot;łapanka&quot; for the children&#x27;s game known in English as &quot;tag&quot;.


Most people who were rounded up were transported to labour camps (&quot;Arbeitslager&quot;) or concentration camps, including Auschwitz. Many Polish women were selected for sexual slavery. Many Polish children were kidnapped for adoption by German families. Some − those without proper documents or carrying contraband − were transported to concentration and death camps. Others, particularly Jews in hiding and Poles wanted for harboring them, were shot dead on the spot. 

The term was also used for describing the tactic of cordoning-off of streets, and the systematic searching of buildings. For men in their 20s and 30s, the only reliable defense against being taken away by the Nazis was the possession of an identity card (called &quot;Ausweis&quot;) certifying that the holder was employed by a Nazi-German company or a government agency locally (for example, by the city utilities or the railways). Thus, many of those who were taken from cafes and restaurants in Warsaw on the night of December 5, 1940 were subsequently released after their documents had been checked. 
According to estimates, in Warsaw alone between 1942 and 1944 the Nazi &quot;łapankas&quot; claimed at least 400 victims every day, with numbers reaching several thousand on some days. On 19 September 1942, nearly 3,000 men and women, who had been caught in massive round-ups all over Warsaw during the previous two days, were transported by train-loads to slave labour in Nazi-Germany.

==Targeted territories==
Such roundups as Poland&#x27;s &quot;łapanka&quot; were carried out by the Germans in other occupied countries as well, particularly in northern France, although not as extensively as in Poland. The French term for this practice was &quot;rafle&quot;, applied primarily to the rounding-up of French Jews. In Denmark and the Netherlands, a Nazi roundup was called &quot;razzia&quot;. 

In historical terms, the &quot;razzia&quot; roundup was used in French colonial context for Muslim raids particularly to plunder and capture slaves from Western and Central Africa, also known as &quot;rezzou&quot; when practiced by the Tuareg. (See also: Barbary slave trade) The word was adopted from &quot;ġaziya&quot; of Algerian Arabic vernacular and later became a figurative name for any act of pillage, with its verb form &quot;razzier&quot;. The Soviets used similar tactics to round up middle-class Poles in the part of Poland that they occupied following the 1939 invasion of Poland. Men, women, and children were transported to labour camps in remote regions of the Soviet Union.

==Polish resistance==
In 1940, one roundup was used by Home Army secret agent Witold Pilecki to gain entry into the Auschwitz camp set up at about that time for Polish prisoners. There, he gathered first-hand intelligence on the camp, and organised inmate resistance. Pilecki deliberately went out into the street during a Warsaw roundup on 19 September 1940, and was arrested by the Nazis along with other civilians. Auschwitz was the main destination for the Poles from beyond the ghetto. There he organised &quot;Związek Organizacji Wojskowej&quot; (&quot;ZOW&quot;, the Military Organization Association), and in November 1940 sent its first report about the camp and the genocide being committed there to Home Army headquarters in Warsaw.
In retribution for roundups as acts of Nazi terror, the Polish resistance carried out attacks on Nazi forces and prepared lists of Nazi leaders to be eliminated for their crimes against civilians. Nazi personnel responsible for organizing roundups, such as members of local unemployment offices, the SS, SD, and Nazi police, were sentenced to death by the Underground court of the Polish Underground for crimes against Polish citizens during the Occupation of Poland. Because of the particular brutality of the police, the AK killed 361 gendarmes in 1943, and 584 in 1944. In Warsaw alone, ten Nazis were killed daily. From August to December 1942, the AK launched 87 attacks on the Nazi administration and members of the apparatus of terror. In 1943 this number rose radically − the AK carried out 514 attacks during the first four months. In an underground operation known as Operacja Główki (Operation Heads), Polish underground combat units from Kedyw eliminated roundup organizers such as:

#Kurt Hoffman - chief of the unemployment office in Warsaw responsible for organising roundups of Poles. Executed by the AK on 9 April 1943.
#Hugo Dietz - Hoffmann&#x27;s assistant. Executed on 13 April 1943.
#Fritz Geist - chief of the unemployment office department. Killed on 10 May 1943.
#Willi Lübbert - worked at the unemployment office and organised roundups of Poles to be sent to Nazi labor camps. Executed on 1 July 1944.
#Eugen Bollodino - worked at the unemployment office and organised roundups of Poles to be sent to Nazi labor camps. Executed by combat patrol unit DB-17 on 8 June 1944.

==In culture==
Criticism of the Nazi practice of roundups was the theme of the most popular song of occupied Warsaw, &quot;Siekiera, motyka&quot; (Polish for &quot;Axe, Hoe&quot;). In 1943 it was published by the Polish resistance&#x27;s underground presses in the book &quot;Posłuchajcie ludzie...&quot; (Listen, folks), one of the &quot;bibuła&quot; publications of the &quot;Komisja Propagandy&quot; (Propaganda Commission) of the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; (Home Army). The song was also reproduced in several books and records after the Nazi occupation ended. In 1946 the song was featured in the first Polish movie created after the war, &quot;Zakazane piosenki&quot;, directed by Leonard Buczkowski.
