<text>Do Re Mi is a musical with music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and a book by Garson Kanin, who also directed the original 1960 Broadway production. The plot centers on a minor-league con man who decides to go (somewhat) straight by moving into the legitimate business of juke boxes and music promotion. The musical was headlined by the comedy couple of Phil Silvers and Nancy Walker, both of whom were Tony nominated. Popular songs introduced included &quot;Cry Like the Wind&quot; and &quot;Make Someone Happy&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Hubie Cram is &quot;a loser endlessly scheming to win big.&quot; His long-suffering and patient wife Kay urges him to &quot;Take a Job,&quot; while he plots. He finds three pals, Fatso O&#x27;Rear, Brains Berman and Skin Demopoulos, and they scheme to enter the juke-box business (&quot;It&#x27;s Legitimate&quot;). Soon they have 300 juke-boxes, which they plan on selling to John Henry Wheeler, a record producer. Hubie discovers a naive singer, Tilda Mullen, and they plan their future (&quot;Ambition&quot;). At a fancy nightclub Hubie explains, and demonstrates, gangster&#x27;s behavior that he learned from watching the &quot;Late Late Show.&quot; Kay compares her abandoned comfortable existence with the insecurity of life with Hubie (&quot;Adventure&quot;). Tilda and Wheeler fall in love (&quot;Make Someone Happy&quot;). In the end Hubie realizes that he has nothing except a wonderful marriage.

==Design elements==
The musical was notable for its elaborate scenic design by Boris Aronson, who conceived the set as an enormous pop-art jukebox, and used extremely novel forms such as collage in his design. The curtain of juke boxes &quot;evoked a cathedral&#x27;s stained-glass effect.&quot; In a scene in a night club, the tables had drawn figures instead of actors, and the actors would talk with these drawings. (A similar design and staging conceit was seen when Silvers guest-starred in a 1967 TV adaptation of &quot;Damn Yankees!&quot;) And in the &quot;Fireworks&quot; number, black light is used to reveal shooting stars and Roman candles as Tilda and John&#x27;s love affair explodes in song.

The J2 Spotlight Musical Theatre Company, an Off-Broadway theatre company dedicated to producing revivals of worthy musicals, will produce Do, Re, Mi as part of their 2024 season in April 2024.

==Recordings==
The Original Broadway cast recording was released in January 1961 on RCA Victor. The 1999 Encores! cast recording was released on September 21, 1999 by DRG.

In 1961, June Christy and Bob Cooper recorded the album &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot; consisting of selections from the musical.

Numbers from both the New York and London productions were also restaged on television for &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;.

==Response==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; called the musical &quot;fast, loud and occasionally funny.&quot; It noted that &quot;a team of expensive talent has turned out some lively songs, set them in motion in feverishly paced production numbers and has managed to overcome, at least part of the time, the cheapness of a machine-made book.&quot; It commented that Phil Silvers was cast against type, here playing &quot;the fall guy, the poor sap who ends as the victim... Betty Comden and Adolph Green have written sprightly lyrics, and Jule Styne has contributed some attractive as well as some ear-shattering tunes. The loveliest is &quot;Cry Like the Wind&quot; which has the keening quality of a folk song of lamentation.&quot;

According to Stanley Green, the musical had &quot;an average score that is worth the price just to hear Miss Walker describe her life of &#x27;Adventure&#x27;&quot;. Ethan Mordden wrote that the song &quot;Adventure&quot; is &quot;one of the grandest comedy songs ever... Here we learn that she, at least, already knows that it&#x27;s a wonderful marriage, because it&#x27;s never boring ... then came a Mad Scene - a bolero complete with trumpets pealing out like the band in the Plaza del Toro on corrida day and woodwinds tripping up the scale with the flash of a hundred capes.&quot;

In reviewing the 1999 &quot;Encores!&quot; production for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ben Brantley wrote that, despite its famous creators, &quot;the show still has the incomplete feeling of a work that never quite meets its own aspirations... A tale of buffoonish gangsters trying to muscle in on the music industry.&quot; He further suggested that the show was like a &quot;shotgun marriage&quot; of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; and &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; with parts of the television sit-com &quot;The Honeymooners.&quot;

<text>Howard Weston &quot;Ted&quot; Bessell Jr. (March 20, 1935 – October 6, 1996) was an American television actor and director widely known for his role as Donald Hollinger, the boyfriend and eventual fiancé of Marlo Thomas&#x27;s character in the TV series &quot;That Girl&quot; (1966–1971).

==Early career==

Born in Flushing, New York, to Howard Weston &quot;Buster&quot; Bessell (1904–1958) and his wife, Jo (1915–2004), Ted Bessell grew up in Manhasset, New York. He was initially preparing for a career as a classical musician. As a 12-year-old child prodigy, he performed a piano recital at Carnegie Hall. Bessell played lacrosse in high school with future football star and actor Jim Brown.

After attending Georgetown University and the University of Colorado, Bessell decided to focus on acting. He studied with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse, studied dance and dramatic movement with Martha Graham and Louis Horst, was a member of a professional acting class under Meisner and worked with Wynn Handman in another professional acting group. He worked at ABC New York as a page (or usher) to supplement his income in the late 1950s.

He appeared on such TV shows as &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot; with Johnny Carson and &quot;The Dick Clark Show&quot;, a Saturday-night variety show featuring rock &#x27;n roll stars. He directed and acted in stock where he appeared in a wide spectrum of theatre works ranging from Shakespeare to Jule Styne. He then was cast in the off-Broadway production of &quot;The Power of Darkness&quot;, which led to further off-Broadway work with the Blackfriars Guild. He co-produced (with his brother, writer-director Frank Bessell) Joe Orton&#x27;s &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;, directed by Michael Kahn.

Bessell first went to Los Angeles in the West Coast production of Thomas Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;, for which he received great critical notices. Following that, he had small roles in &#x27; and &#x27; in 1961.

In 1962, he played 27-year-old college student Tom-Tom DeWitt on the short-lived television series &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World&quot;. In 1965, he appeared in an episode of &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot; and &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; episode, &quot;Thou Still Unravished Bride&quot;, as Elliott. In 1965 to 1966, he was also regularly featured on Jim Nabors&#x27;s &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; as Private Francis &quot;Frankie&quot; Lombardi.

Bessell appeared in such feature films as &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy Joins the Air Force&quot; (1965), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot; (1969). He appeared in the TV films &quot;Two on a Bench&quot; (1971) and &quot;Your Money or Your Wife&quot; (1972), which won the Peabody Award for Best Mystery of the Year.

==&quot;That Girl&quot; (1966–1971) and other work==

Bessell&#x27;s best-known TV role was as Donald Hollinger, Marlo Thomas&#x27;s boyfriend and fiancé on the hit series &quot;That Girl&quot;, which ran for five seasons from 1966 to 1971.

When &quot;That Girl&quot; ended its run, he tried his hand at another sitcom, &quot;Me and the Chimp&quot;, in which he played Mike Reynolds, a dentist who is persuaded by his children to take in a runaway chimpanzee. Created by Garry Marshall, the show had a short, unsuccessful run of 19 episodes in 1972. He had a supporting role in the television film &quot;Scream, Pretty Peggy&quot; (1973) and Bessell carried the lead role in the television film &quot;Bobby Parker and Company&quot; (1974) and another supporting role in &quot;Three Comedies&quot; (1975).

It was not until 1975 that Bessell would appear in another sitcom, as Joe Warner, the boyfriend of Mary Richards, for two episodes on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. In the 1980s, he appeared in several other TV movies, including &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Acorn People&quot; (1981). He also played regular roles on a pair of short-lived sitcoms, &quot;Good Time Harry&quot; (1980) and, in his last major role, &quot;Hail to the Chief,&quot; (1985) as the husband of Patty Duke&#x27;s character, the fictional first female President of the United States.

Bessell moved into directing, helming episodes of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; and &quot;Sibs&quot;. In 1989, he shared an Emmy as a producer on Fox Broadcasting&#x27;s &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, which was honored as best variety or comedy program.

==Death==
Bessell died on October 6, 1996, due to a ruptured aortic aneurysm at age 61. He is interred in Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery, Santa Monica, California.

==Personal life==
Bessell was married to Linnell Nobori and had two daughters, Sarah and Mary.

<text>Resident Evil 2 is a 1998 survival horror video game developed and published by Capcom for the PlayStation. The player controls rookie cop Leon S. Kennedy and college student Claire Redfield, who must escape Raccoon City after its citizens are transformed into zombies by a biological weapon two months after the events of the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. The gameplay focuses on exploration, puzzles, and combat; the main difference from its predecessor are the branching paths, with each player character having unique storylines, partners and obstacles.

&quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was produced by &quot;Resident Evil&quot; director Shinji Mikami, directed by Hideki Kamiya, and developed by a team of approximately 50 across 21 months. The initial version, commonly referred to as &quot;Resident Evil 1.5&quot;, differs drastically; it was canceled at approximately two thirds completion because Mikami decided it was inadequate. The final design introduced a more cinematic presentation.

&quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; received acclaim for its atmosphere, setting, graphics, audio, scenarios, overall gameplay, and its improvements over the original game, but with some criticism towards its controls, voice acting, and certain gameplay elements. It is widely listed among the best video games ever made. It is the best-selling &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game for a single platform at more than copies sold across all platforms. It was ported to Windows, Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, and GameCube, and a modified 2.5D version was released for the Game.com handheld. The story of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was retold and built upon in several later games, and has been adapted into a variety of licensed works. It was followed by &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot; in 1999. A remake was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in 2019.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; is a third-person survival horror game which features the same basic gameplay as its predecessor, &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. Set in Raccoon City, a fictional town in the Midwestern Arklay Mountains, the game offers a choice of two protagonists - rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy or college student Claire Redfield - as they attempt to survive a zombie outbreak in the city. The player explores Raccoon City while fighting monsters and solving puzzles. While the player characters may be equipped with firearms, limited ammunition adds a tactical element to combat, forcing the player to choose between engaging or evading encounters.

The game uses tank controls, meaning that pressing up moves the character forward, down reverses, and left and right rotates, independently of the camera perspective. On the status screen, the player can check the condition of the player character, view a map of the area, re-read obtained files, and equip or combine items. The characters&#x27; current health can also be determined by their posture and movement speed. For example, a character will hold their stomach in pain if wounded, and will limp slowly if on the verge of death. The player character will take damage whenever they are caught by an enemy or hazard, and if they take too much damage, they will die, causing a game over. Herbs and first aid spray can be used to heal. Safe rooms scattered throughout the city contain typewriters, where the player may spend ink ribbons to save their progress, and item boxes that can store items, which are necessary because the player characters can only carry a limited number of items with them.

Contrasting with Chris and Jill&#x27;s different abilities in the previous game, Leon and Claire differ only in their starting key items (a lighter and a lockpick, respectively). The game introduces a &quot;Zapping System&quot; where the two player characters are each confronted with differing puzzles, plot threads, and encounters. After finishing the &quot;A Scenario&quot; as one protagonist, the player will unlock the &quot;B Scenario&quot; for the other, elements of which change to reflect the A Scenario&#x27;s events, e.g. killed enemies, solved puzzles, and hazards caused by player actions. This results in a total of four unique playthroughs, two for each character, which increases the game&#x27;s replayability. Each protagonist is joined by a support partner during the game. These characters accompany the protagonist in certain scenes, and are playable during short segments. Like the previous game, there are multiple endings, but unlike the previous game, which ending the player sees is determined solely by which of the four scenarios is being played.

The graphics are composed of real-time generated polygonal characters and item models, superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds that are viewed from fixed camera angles.

After completing a scenario, the player is given a rank based on their playtime and the number of times they saved or used special healing items. Higher ranks may unlock additional weapons and costumes. &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; contains two standalone missions: &quot;The 4th Survivor&quot; and &quot;The To-fu Survivor&quot;. In both, the player must reach the goal while fighting every enemy along the way with only the default item loadout. The PlayStation version requires the player complete both scenarios with high ranks in order to unlock these missions, while the Dreamcast version has them accessible from the beginning. All later versions, excluding the Nintendo 64 version, have an additional &quot;Extreme Battle&quot; minigame, where the player, either as Leon, Claire, Ada or Chris Redfield from the first game, must plant four antivirus bombs around one of three maps while fighting through a gauntlet of enemies with limited supplies.

==Plot==
Depending on which order the scenarios are played in, the player experiences one of two courses of events which mutually contradict each other. This plot summary covers only the path followed by playing the Claire A and Leon B scenarios, which was suggested by Capcom to be the canon version of events.

On September 29, 1998, two months after the events of the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, most citizens of the Midwestern American mountain community of Raccoon City have been transformed into zombies by the T-virus, a biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. Leon S. Kennedy, a Raccoon Police Department officer on his first day of duty, meets Claire Redfield, a college student looking for her brother Chris. After being separated, Leon and Claire each make their own way to the Raccoon Police Station. They discover that most of the RPD has been killed, and that Chris has left town to investigate Umbrella&#x27;s headquarters in Europe. They split up to look for survivors and find a way out of the city. While searching for an escape route, Claire meets a little girl, Sherry Birkin, who is on the run from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong, who claims to be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher from Chicago.

RPD Chief Brian Irons had been bribed by Umbrella to hide evidence of the company&#x27;s experiments in the outskirts of the city. He concealed their development of the new G-virus, an agent capable of mutating a human into the ultimate bioweapon. Leon has multiple encounters with a Tyrant, a monster air-dropped into the police station by Umbrella to seek the G-virus. Irons tries to murder Claire but is killed by a G-virus mutant in the police station. Claire and Sherry escape through the sewers and become separated. After splitting up with Leon, Ada finds Sherry and picks up a golden pendant the girl loses while running away. Further into the sewers, Ada reluctantly teams up with Leon again, after he insists on his duty to protect her. They encounter a middle-aged woman who fires at Ada, but Leon jumps between them and takes a bullet himself. Ada ignores the unconscious Leon and follows the woman, who reveals herself to be Sherry&#x27;s mother Annette and the wife of William Birkin, the Umbrella scientist who created the G-virus. In an attempt to protect his life&#x27;s work from special agents sent by the Umbrella headquarters, he injected himself with the virus, which turned him into the malformed creature and is now chasing Sherry because of her genetic make-up. Annette recognizes her daughter&#x27;s pendant and attempts to take it from Ada. A fight ensues, during which Annette is thrown over a railing. Ada learns that the golden locket contains a sample of the G-virus, and later – taken over by her emotions – returns to Leon, tending to his bullet wound.

Meanwhile, Claire is reunited with Sherry and discovers that William has implanted his daughter with an embryo to produce offspring. Leon, Ada, Claire, and Sherry advance through an abandoned factory connected to Umbrella&#x27;s secret underground research facility. An attack by William leaves Ada heavily wounded, and Leon explores the laboratory to find something to treat her wounds. He is interrupted by a psychotic Annette, who says that Ada&#x27;s relationship with John was only a means of getting information about Umbrella because Ada is a spy sent to steal the G-virus for an unknown organization. Leon does not believe her, saying he trusts Ada. Just as Annette is about to shoot Leon, the Tyrant appears, and she retreats. Ada returns to save Leon and battles the Tyrant, which falls into a pit of molten metal. Ada is mortally wounded from the fight; she and Leon confess their love for each other before Ada stops breathing. Meanwhile, Annette tries to escape with another sample of the G-virus but is fatally wounded by her mutated husband; before she dies, she tells Claire how to create a vaccine that will stop the mutations caused by the embryo within Sherry. After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, which saves her life. En route, Leon is assisted in terminating the now-mutated Super Tyrant by an unseen figure; Leon briefly thinks it is Ada, but is unable to positively identify her voice over the noise. Grown to gigantic size, William follows Leon and Claire, but is destroyed when the train self-destructs. After escaping from the city with Sherry, Leon intends to take down Umbrella, while Claire continues to search for Chris. HUNK, one of the surviving special agents sent by Umbrella, completes his G-virus retrieval mission.

==Development==
Development of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; began one month after the completion of its predecessor in early 1996. &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was developed by a group of about 45 people that later became part of Capcom Production Studio 4. Director Hideki Kamiya led the team, which was composed of newer Capcom employees and over half of the staff from the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. In the initial stages of development, producer Shinji Mikami often had creative disagreements with Kamiya, and tried to influence the team with his own direction. He eventually withdrew into an overseeing role as producer, and only demanded to be shown the latest build once monthly. The game took more than $1 million to create.

===&quot;Resident Evil 1.5&quot;===

The first footage of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was shown at the V Jump Festival &#x27;96 in July. This build, later dubbed &quot;Resident Evil 1.5&quot; by Mikami, differed drastically from the final version. Its plot followed the same basic outline and features a zombie outbreak in Raccoon City two months after the events of the first game. However, Umbrella had already been closed as a consequence of its illegal experiments.

The development team sought to retain the degree of fear from the original game, and introduced two characters without experience of terrifying situations: Leon S. Kennedy, largely identical to his persona in the final build, and Elza Walker, a college student and motorcycle racer vacationing in Raccoon City, her hometown. Unlike the final version, the character paths did not cross, and each character had two support partners instead of one. Leon received help from fellow police officer Marvin Branagh and researcher Linda – an early version of Ada – while Elza was aided by Sherry Birkin and John, who appears in &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; as gun shop owner Robert Kendo. Mikami also revealed in 1996 that the sequel would have new monsters, and the number of onscreen enemies would be increased to &quot;around seven or more&quot; to produce &quot;the sensation of terror as the monsters swarm around the character&quot;.

Real-world examples influenced character designs by artists Isao Ohishi and Ryoji Shimogama. For example, Ohishi based Leon on his bloodhound, and Annette Birkin on actress Jodie Foster. The police station was smaller with a more modern and realistic design. There were more encounters with surviving policemen, such as a superior officer of Leon named Roy. Enemy models used far fewer polygons, allowing many zombies to appear on the screen. The game employed dynamic music, and altered pre-rendered backgrounds in response to gameplay events. The playable characters could use equipment such as protective clothes to enhance their defense and enable them to carry more items. The character models were altered by costume changes and by damage received from enemies.

Believing the game&#x27;s assets were good individually, but not yet satisfactory as a whole, Mikami expected that everything would coalesce in the three months leading up to the projected May 1997 release date. Soon after, &quot;Resident Evil 1.5&quot; was scrapped at 60–80 percent completion. Mikami later explained that the game would not have reached the desired quality on time, and that the gameplay and locations were dull.

=== Development restarted ===
Mikami planned to end the series with &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;. Supervisor Yoshiki Okamoto criticized the story, finding it too conclusive to allow for future installments. Instead, Okamoto proposed the creation of a fictional universe that would turn &quot;Resident Evil&quot; into a metaseries – similar to the &quot;Gundam&quot; and &quot;James Bond&quot; franchises – in which self-contained stories with common elements could be told.

During a period in which the team made no progress rewriting the scenario, Okamoto was introduced to professional screenwriter Noboru Sugimura, who was enthusiastic about the first game&#x27;s story. Sugimura was initially consulted on a trial basis, but Okamoto was impressed by the ease with which Sugimara solved script problems, and soon asked him to compose the entire scenario for &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;. One fundamental modification to the story was the reworking of Elza Walker into Claire Redfield, in order to introduce a connection to the plot of the first game.

To fulfill Capcom&#x27;s sales plan of two million copies, director Kamiya tried to attract new customers with a more ostentatious and Hollywood-like story presentation. As Okamoto did not want to simply enforce the new direction, he had Sugimura discuss the plot revisions with Mikami and the development staff. The planners redesigned the game from the ground up to fit the changes, and the programmers and other remaining members of the team were sent to work on &quot;Resident Evil Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, which was shipped with a playable preview disc of the new &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; version in order to promote the sequel and to apologize to the players for its belated release.

Few assets from &quot;Resident Evil 1.5&quot; could be recycled, as the principal locations in the final build had been made to look more extravagant and artistic, based on photographs taken of the interiors of Western-style buildings in Japanese cities. The environments were created on SGI O2 computers, and each background took two or three weeks to render. The maximum number of zombies displayed on the screen at one time was limited to seven, making it possible to use 450 polygons for the comparatively detailed models of Leon and Claire. The protagonists, instead of being given visible wounds, were made to limp slowly upon receiving heavy damage. Other than the graphics, one of the most important new features is the &quot;Zapping System&quot;, which was partly inspired by &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;, a time travel-themed film sequel that offers a different perspective on the story of the original film. The voice-overs by the all-Canadian cast of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; were recorded before the actual cutscenes were completed, with each of the actors selected from a roster of ten people per role. Thereafter, the full-motion videos (FMVs) were created by filming stop-motion animations of action figures, which were then rendered to completed pictures with computer graphics (CG) tools. Ada&#x27;s movie model could not be finished in time. Thus, she is the only main character not to appear in a pre-rendered cutscene.

Regional releases required several changes. The North American version contains more violent game over screens, which were removed from the Japanese &quot;Biohazard 2&quot;. &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was made more difficult (and thus longer-playing) than its Japanese equivalent to prevent short-term rentals from affecting U.S. sales.

===Music===

The music for &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was composed by Masami Ueda, Shusaku Uchiyama, and Syun Nishigaki, except one track composed by Naoshi Mizuta. The music conveys &quot;desperation&quot; as its underlying theme. In his role as lead composer, Ueda provided the motifs, and Uchiyama provided the horror-themed music for the investigation and movie scenes. The main theme, a versatile three-note leitmotif, appears several times throughout the story, included in compositions such as &quot;Prologue&quot;, &quot;Raccoon City&quot;, and &quot;The Third Malformation of G&quot;. Various musical styles, ranging from ambient horror to industrial, represent the different game environments. For example, the streets of Raccoon City are emphasized with militaristic percussion-based music, and the police station features ominous piano underscores. Key events of the story are supported with orchestral and cinematic compositions – a move that was inspired by blockbuster films.

Two albums containing music from the game were released in January and August 1998, respectively. The first, &quot;Biohazard 2 Original Soundtrack&quot;, is the main release and includes most of the significant compositions. The second, &quot;Biohazard 2 Complete Track&quot;, largely encompasses less prevalent themes, but offers an orchestral medley and a second CD with sound effects, voice collections, and an interview with the sound staff. The European version of &quot;Biohazard 2 Original Soundtrack&quot; has an identical CD, &quot;Resident Evil 2 Original Soundtrack&quot;. In the North American version, the opening theme &quot;The Beginning of Story&quot; is split into four individual tracks. Five orchestral arrangements were included on the &quot;Bio Hazard Orchestra Album&quot;, a live concert performed by the New Japan Philharmonic. Disc jockey Piston Nishizawa created electronic remixes for several of the compositions, which were later released as the album &quot;Biohazard 2 Remix: Metamorphoses&quot;.

===Marketing===
In Japan, marketing included a live action television commercial directed by renowned zombie film director George A. Romero. The commercial was filmed on location at Lincoln Heights Jail and starred Brad Renfro as Leon Kennedy and Adrienne Frantz as Claire Redfield. The game had a marketing budget of $5 million.

==Releases==
After its initial release for the PlayStation in January 1998, &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was reissued and ported to other systems, many gaining new features in the process.

===&quot;Dual Shock Ver.&quot;===
The first re-release is the &quot;Dual Shock Ver.&quot;, which supports the vibration and analog control functions of the PlayStation&#x27;s DualShock controller. Other additions include a new unlockable minigame called &quot;Extreme Battle&quot;, and a &quot;Rookie&quot; mode that enables the player to start the main story with a powerful weapon and infinite ammunition. The Japanese release of the &quot;Dual Shock Ver.&quot; contains a &quot;U.S.A. Version&quot; mode based on the difficulty level of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;″s Western versions. The &quot;Dual Shock Ver.&quot; served as the basis for the majority of ports, such as the Windows 9x-based PC-CD version &quot;Resident Evil 2 Platinum&quot;. The PC version retains all previously added features and can be run in higher resolutions. A &quot;Data Gallery&quot; was added to the main menu, allowing the player to view movies, rough sketches, illustrations, and 3D models. In February 2006, a Japan-exclusive, Windows XP-compatible PC-DVD re-release was published. Developed by Sourcenext, it includes high-quality FMVs encoded at 640×480 pixels.

The Dreamcast version keeps the additions from the original PC release, and incorporates real-time display of the character&#x27;s condition on the Visual Memory Unit peripheral. The Japanese edition of the Dreamcast port has the subtitle &quot;Value Plus&quot; and a playable demo of &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot;. An unmodified port of the &quot;Dual Shock Ver.&quot; was released for the GameCube. The initial PlayStation version was re-released on the Japanese PlayStation Network in 2007, and the service&#x27;s North American counterpart received the &quot;Dual Shock Ver.&quot; two years later.

===Nintendo 64===
Released on November 16, 1999, the Nintendo 64 version of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; is one of the few games released for the console to have FMVs, overcoming the limited storage space on the cartridge. The PlayStation version with two CD-ROMs of up to per disc was faithfully replicated (with unique enhancements) on a Nintendo 64 Game Pak. In the process, audio and video assets had to be more aggressively and creatively compressed, using novel techniques that shift the burden away from storage and toward the console&#x27;s high real-time processing power. Across twelve months and with a budget of $1 million, &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was ported to the console by a team led by nine full-time and one part-time personnel from Angel Studios. Further help was provided by ten staff from Capcom Production Studio 3 and Factor 5. This version offers features that were not included on any other system, such as alternate costumes, the ability to adjust the degree of violence and to change the blood color, a randomizer to place items differently during each playthrough, and a more responsive first-person control scheme. Additionally, the port features 16 new in-game documents known as the &quot;Ex Files&quot;, written by Tetsuro Oyama. Hidden throughout the four scenarios, they reveal new information about the series&#x27; lore and connect the story of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; to those of the other installments, including some that had not been released yet.

The Nintendo 64 version adjusts its display resolution depending on the number of polygonal models currently on screen, and supports the Expansion Pak accessory for a maximum resolution of 640×480 during gameplay. Other visual enhancements include smoother character animations and sharper, perspective-corrected textures for the 3D models. This is the only version to use surround sound, with the soundtrack converted to Dolby Surround by Chris Hülsbeck, Rudolf Stember, and Thomas Engel. The team reworked the sound set from scratch to provide each instrument with a higher sample rate than on the PlayStation, resulting in higher-quality music. Some features from the other enhanced versions based on the &quot;Dual Shock Ver.&quot; do not appear in the Nintendo 64 version, such as the &quot;Extreme Battle&quot; minigame. In 2018, Eurogamer called this &quot;one of the most ambitious [and impressive] console ports of all time&quot;.

===Other versions===
A port of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; for the Sega Saturn was developed at Capcom, with plans for it to use the console&#x27;s 4 MB RAM cartridge, but technical difficulties led to its cancellation in October 1998.

Tiger Electronics released a black and white sprite-based 2.5D version for its Game.com handheld in late 1998. It includes only Leon&#x27;s story path, and lacks many of the original game&#x27;s core features, including cutscenes and music. This was the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game to be released on a handheld console. 

In February 2013, an unfinished build of &quot;Resident Evil 1.5&quot; was leaked onto the Internet.

On June 26, 2024, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; was released on GOG.com, with &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; released on August 27, and &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot; released on September 25. The titles were sold both individually and as a $24.99 bundle. The PC port will be based on the &quot;Dual Shock ver.&quot; and will include high-resolution character models and an art gallery.

==Reception==
&quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; received critical acclaim upon release. Its original PlayStation release holds an average aggregate score of 93% at GameRankings based on 25 reviews, and 89 out of 100 points at Metacritic for both the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions based on 13 reviews. The majority of reviews praised &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; for its atmosphere, setting, graphics, audio, and overall gameplay, but criticized its controls, voice acting, and certain gameplay elements.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine&#x27;s Steve Key and Alex Huhtahla praised the gameplay, puzzles, horror, graphics, audio, and the scenario system&#x27;s replay factor. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; magazine&#x27;s four reviewers agreed it was better than the original game, and said almost everything about the sequel is &quot;flawless&quot;, including the gameplay, graphics, layout, level of detail, sound, frightful atmosphere, suspenseful story, and scenario system. They criticized the controls and menu system, but said the controls were an improvement over the original. The game tied with the PlayStation version of &quot;Point Blank&quot; for their &quot;Game of the Month&quot;. &quot;GameFan&quot; magazine&#x27;s three reviewers praised the gameplay, tension, environments, graphics, voice acting, and scenario system. &quot;Game Informer&quot; magazine&#x27;s three reviewers praised the concept, graphics, sound, playability, and entertainment. &quot;&quot; magazine praised the puzzles, monsters, and weapons. &quot;Next Generation&quot; called it &quot;the must-own title of the year&quot;, saying it made leaps over the original game in terms of longevity and graphics while retaining the original&#x27;s core appeal.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Ricardo Sanchez said that the game&#x27;s atmosphere was &quot;dead on&quot;, and that &quot;[the] graphics, sound effects, music, and level design all work together to create a spooky, horror-filled world&quot;. Ryan Mac Donald of &quot;GameSpot&quot; shared the opinion, and found the game to be &quot;like a product out of Hollywood&quot;. He said that it was &quot;more an interactive, cinematic experience than a video game&quot;. Writing for &quot;ComputerAndVideoGames.com&quot;, Paul Mallinson considered the atmosphere, story, and film-like presentation its most outstanding features, and though he found its plot to be &quot;far-fetched&quot;, he said it was &quot;kept down to earth by clever scripting and gritty storytelling&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; staff writer Mike Weigand called the narrative &quot;engrossing and dramatic&quot;, and the dialogue &quot;well-written&quot; and &quot;spell-binding&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Sanchez, &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Brian Davis, and &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Martin Taylor praised the &quot;Zapping System&quot; for adding to the story and increasing the replay value. Mac Donald said that the idea of actions in the first scenario affecting the second was &quot;cool in concept&quot;, but underused.

&quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was also praised for its graphics, which many critics said were a substantial improvement upon those of the first installment. Sanchez and Weigand said that the pre-rendered backgrounds were an impressive leap ahead of those in the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, due to their increased detail and interactivity. &quot;Next Generation&quot; said that the character models now stood out less from the backgrounds. Shawn Smith of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; found the rendered cutscenes far preferable to the live action ones of the original. Mac Donald praised the model animations for having reached &quot;true realism&quot;, and commended the use of body language as a means of seamlessly communicating the condition of the protagonists&#x27; health. &quot;Allgame&quot;″s Shawn Sackenheim awarded its graphics the highest possible score, as he found the backgrounds to be &quot;rendered to perfection&quot;, the cutscenes &quot;a work of art&quot;, and the animation &quot;fluid and eerie&quot;. The audio was well received by critics. Weigand cited it as an &quot;excellent accompaniment to the visuals&quot;. Sanchez went as far as to say that &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; &quot;may have the best sound design yet for a console game&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; said it had &quot;the most precise and realistic sound effects ever heard in any game&quot;. Sackenheim described the music and sound effects as &quot;spot on perfect&quot; and the soundtrack &quot;perfectly composed&quot;, and Mac Donald likened the use of audio to that of classic horror films.

A common point of criticism was the inventory system, which Sanchez called &quot;a pain&quot;. He disliked the player&#x27;s need to retrieve objects from item boxes, and Mac Donald criticized the system for being unrealistic, as the boxes are magically interconnected and all items take the same amount of space when being carried, regardless of their size. Furthermore, Mallinson and Mac Donald disapproved of certain puzzles, as out of place in a police station setting. Sanchez said that the puzzles were paced better than in the first game, but less interesting and too easy for experienced players. &quot;Next Generation&quot; praised the game&#x27;s massive length and said that the differences between each character&#x27;s scenario were great enough to make the replay value ten times greater than that of the original, which used a similar two-scenario system. Sackenheim said the game was brief, and remarked that the individual scenarios are not different enough to hold the interest of casual players until the end of the game. He found the controls to be &quot;easy to pick up and play&quot;, and Sanchez said that aiming weapons was difficult. Some reviewers panned the voice acting, calling it &quot;cheesy&quot;, &quot;terrible&quot;, and &quot;barbaric&quot;.

With the exception of the critically acclaimed Nintendo 64 version, most later releases of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; have received slightly lower scores than the PlayStation version. Weigand advised players who already owned &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; to rent the &quot;Dual Shock Ver.&quot; for the &quot;Extreme Battle&quot; minigame, and recommended that newcomers buy the updated edition instead of the original release. The Windows version was praised for its additional content, but criticized for not allowing the player to save at will, and for lacking updated backgrounds to fit the higher in-game resolution. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; said that version&#x27;s total elimination of CD-ROM load times make the game &quot;extremely fun and simple&quot;. The Nintendo 64 version was widely commended for the technical achievement of fitting a two-disc game on a single cartridge. However, Taylor criticized this version for retaining scenes from the PlayStation version that were used to conceal its CD-ROM loading times – a technical disadvantage absent from cartridge. &quot;GamePro&quot; writer &quot;The Freshman&quot; was impressed with the enhanced graphics of the Nintendo 64 version, but was disappointed by its heavily compressed FMVs. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Joe Fielder found the compression to be forgivable given the cartridge format, and that the new exclusive features made up for the lack of the &quot;Extreme Battle&quot; mode. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; said the Nintendo 64&#x27;s unique analog control &quot;works supremely well to the point where it&#x27;s borderline game-breaking&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; reviewer Matt Casamassina applauded the implementation of Dolby Surround support, and called the Nintendo 64 release the &quot;best version of the game&quot;. In 2018, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called it &quot;one of the most ambitious [and impressive] console ports of all time&quot;.

The clearer sound effects of the Dreamcast port were received well by &quot;GameRevolution&quot;″s Shawn Sparks, who also remarked that the character models look slightly sharper. However, Steve Key of &quot;Computer And Video Games&quot; disliked the Dreamcast release&#x27;s low-resolution backgrounds, which he thought made the characters stand out too much from the environments, and thus lessened the atmosphere. &quot;GameSpot&quot; staff writer James Mielke said that the Dreamcast port was not &quot;an essential purchase&quot;, but still a &quot;great game&quot; at an attractively low price. The GameCube release was heavily criticized for its high price and dated graphics. However, &quot;Four-Eyed Dragon&quot; of &quot;GamePro&quot; noted its superior in-game visuals compared to any other version. Davis and &quot;1UP.com&quot;″s Mark MacDonald were disappointed by the version&#x27;s lack of features that were included in the Nintendo 64 release. Peer Schneider of &quot;IGN&quot; found the 2.5D version for the Game.com to be frustrating and only &quot;partially faithful&quot; to the original release of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;. Although he believed that its graphics and sound effects managed to recreate the original game&#x27;s atmosphere to a certain extent, he thought that its controls were too &quot;sluggish&quot; to allow for an enjoyable experience.

===Sales===
&quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was promoted with a advertising campaign. In Italy, the game reached 100,000 pre-orders, worth over 12 billion lire or . It became the fastest-selling video game in North America. On the weekend following its release, more than 380,000 copies were sold, grossing . It therefore surpassed the opening revenue of all but one Hollywood movie at that time and broke previous sales records set by the video games &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. After one and a half months, the game&#x27;s global sales had topped 3 million copies, with 1.9 million sold in Japan and over a million sold in the United States.

&quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; named it Japan&#x27;s best-selling game for the first half of 1998, with sales of 2.13 million units. By August 1998, 2,298,814 copies were sold in Japan. According to The NPD Group, it was 1998&#x27;s sixth best-selling game in the United States. At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; took home a &quot;Gold&quot; prize for revenues above or in the European Union during 1998. With 4.96 million copies sold, the original PlayStation version of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was a commercial success, and is the franchise&#x27;s best-selling game on a single platform. By March 1999, approximately units of all versions of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; had been sold worldwide, including 810,000 copies of &quot;Resident Evil 2: Dual Shock Ver.&quot; In Japan, 17,973 copies of the Nintendo 64 and GameCube versions were sold. In the United States, 326,397 copies of the Nintendo 64 version were sold.

===Accolades===
&quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was a finalist at the AIAS&#x27; inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards for &quot;Console Action Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Console Adventure Game of the Year&quot;, but lost to &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, respectively.

In &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s 1998 Gamers&#x27; Choice Awards, &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was the runner-up for Best Adventure Game of the Year and Readers&#x27; Choice Best PlayStation Game of the Year, behind &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; which won in both award categories. The Video Software Dealers Association nominated it for Video Game of the Year.

&quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; has been held in high regard in the years following its initial release, and was named the fourth best game on the PlayStation by &quot;Famitsu&quot;. It is listed as one of the 100 best games of all time by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (62nd), &quot;IGN&quot; (58th), &quot;Empire&quot; (49th), &quot;Game Informer&quot; (34th), and &quot;Official UK PlayStation Magazine&quot; (6th). Readers of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; voted &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; the 97th top retro game, and the staff wrote it was &quot;considered by many to be the best in the long-running series&quot;.

===Controversy===
In Italy, &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was temporarily banned in 1999 following criticism from the political organization &quot;Movimento Diritti Civili&quot; (Civil Rights Movement) for its realistic depiction of violence, with the law enforcement agency Guardia di Finanza seizing over 5,500 unsold copies. Sony Computer Entertainment asked for a re-examination of the seizure decree, and the ban was lifted a few months later.

==Legacy==
&quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; is the basis of several licensed works and later games. Ted Adams and Kris Oprisko loosely adapted it into the comics &quot;Raccoon City – R.I.P.&quot; and &quot;A New Chapter of Evil&quot;, which were released in the first and second issues of &quot;Resident Evil: The Official Comic Book Magazine&quot; in March and June 1998. The 60-issue Hong Kong comics &quot;Biohazard 2&quot; was published weekly from February 1998 to April 1999. A romantic comedy retelling of the game&#x27;s story, centered on Leon, Claire and Ada, was released as the Taiwanese two-issue comic &quot;Èlíng Gǔbǎo II&quot; (lit. &quot;Demon Castle II&quot;). &quot;Resident Evil: City of the Dead&quot;, a 1999 book written by S. D. Perry, is a more direct adaptation of the narrative, and is the third release in her series of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; novelizations, published by Pocket Books in 1999.

The mobile game &quot;Resident Evil: Uprising&quot; contains a condensed version of the &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; story, adapted by Megan Swaine. &quot;Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles&quot;, an on-rails shooter released for the Wii in 2009, includes a scenario named &quot;Memories of a Lost City&quot;, which reimagines the original &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; plot while retaining key scenes from the game&#x27;s four scenarios. In 2008, &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; producer Jun Takeuchi, who had previously worked on the series as weapons designer and graphics animator, alluded to the possibility of a full-fledged remake. Such a project had already been considered for the GameCube in 2002, but Mikami abandoned the idea as he did not want to delay the in-development &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;.

&quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; appears in the British sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot; in the episode &quot;Art&quot;, in which a character hallucinates that he is fighting a zombie invasion. &quot;Spaced&quot; director Edgar Wright cited this episode inspired by &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; as the basis for his zombie comedy film &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004).

The story arcs introduced in &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; continue in drama albums and later game releases. Kyoko Sagiyama, Junichi Miyashita, Yasuyuki Suzuki, Noboru Sugimura, Hirohisa Soda, and Kishiko Miyagi – screenwriters employed by Capcom&#x27;s former scenario subsidiary Flagship – created two radio dramas, &quot;Chiisana Tōbōsha Sherry&quot; (&quot;The Little Runaway Sherry&quot;) and &quot;Ikiteita Onna Spy Ada&quot; (&quot;The Female Spy Ada Lives&quot;). The dramas were broadcast on Radio Osaka in early 1999, and later released by publisher Suleputer as two separate CDs, &quot;Biohazard 2 Drama Album&quot;. &quot;Chiisana Tōbōsha Sherry&quot; begins shortly after the events of the game. Sherry is separated from Claire while fleeing from Umbrella soldiers sent to kill all witnesses of the viral outbreak. Raccoon City is burned down by the U.S. Government and Umbrella in an attempt to cover up the disaster. Sherry seeks refuge in the neighboring town of Stone Ville, and later escapes to Canada with the help of a girl named Meg, who vows to help her reunite with Claire.

&quot;Ikiteita Onna Spy Ada&quot; is set a few days after &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;, and deals with Ada&#x27;s mission to retrieve Sherry&#x27;s pendant with the G-virus sample, which is said to be in the possession of HUNK in the backstory of the drama album. Ada intercepts the delivery of the locket in France, and kills HUNK and his men. As a consequence of an accidental T-virus leak in Loire Village, the destination of the delivery, Ada is forced to retreat to an old castle. Along with a unit of the French Air Force sent to burn down the village, she encounters Christine Henry, the Umbrella facility director who gave HUNK the order to deliver the G-virus to France. Jacob, the leader of the airborne unit, is revealed to be Christine&#x27;s co-conspirator. However, he plans to keep the G-virus sample for himself, and shoots her. Philippe, another member of the unit, convinces Ada to give him the pendant, after which he injects himself with the G-virus to give himself the power to stop Jacob. Ada escapes and realizes her feelings for Leon, deciding to quit the spy business and return to him. The characters&#x27; story arcs are continued differently: Sherry is taken into custody by the U.S. Government immediately after the events of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;, and Ada keeps the pendant with the G-virus and resumes her activities as a spy. Hunk successfully delivers a separate G-virus sample to Umbrella.

=== Remake ===

In August 2015, Capcom announced that a remake of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was in development. Capcom unveiled the game at E3 2018, with trailers and gameplay footage, and a worldwide release date of January 25, 2019 for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. The game uses the RE Engine, which is also in &quot;Resident Evil 7: Biohazard&quot;, and replaces the tank controls and fixed camera angles with &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; gameplay similar to &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;.

<doc id="938833" wikidata="Q529909" url="?curid=938833" title="Multi-agent system">
<text>A multi-agent system (MAS or &quot;self-organized system&quot;) is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents. Multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve. Intelligence may include methodic, functional, procedural approaches, algorithmic search or reinforcement learning. With advancements in Large language model (LLMs), LLM-based multi-agent systems have emerged as a new area of research, enabling more sophisticated interactions and coordination among agents.

Despite considerable overlap, a multi-agent system is not always the same as an agent-based model (ABM). The goal of an ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents (which do not necessarily need to be &quot;intelligent&quot;) obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in solving specific practical or engineering problems. The terminology of ABM tends to be used more often in the science, and MAS in engineering and technology. Applications where multi-agent systems research may deliver an appropriate approach include online trading, disaster response, target surveillance and social structure modelling.

== Concept ==

Multi-agent systems consist of agents and their environment. Typically multi-agent systems research refers to software agents. However, the agents in a multi-agent system could equally well be robots, humans or human teams. A multi-agent system may contain combined human-agent teams.

Agents can be divided into types spanning simple to complex. Categories include:
* Passive agents or &quot;agent without goals&quot; (such as obstacle, apple or key in any simple simulation)
* Active agents with simple goals (like birds in flocking, or wolf–sheep in prey-predator model)
* Cognitive agents (complex calculations)

Agent environments can be divided into:
* Virtual
* Discrete
* Continuous

Agent environments can also be organized according to properties such as accessibility (whether it is possible to gather complete information about the environment), determinism (whether an action causes a definite effect), dynamics (how many entities influence the environment in the moment), discreteness (whether the number of possible actions in the environment is finite), episodicity (whether agent actions in certain time periods influence other periods), and dimensionality (whether spatial characteristics are important factors of the environment and the agent considers space in its decision making). Agent actions are typically mediated via an appropriate middleware. This middleware offers a first-class design abstraction for multi-agent systems, providing means to govern resource access and agent coordination.

=== Characteristics ===

The agents in a multi-agent system have several important characteristics:

* Autonomy: agents at least partially independent, self-aware, autonomous
* Local views: no agent has a full global view, or the system is too complex for an agent to exploit such knowledge
* Decentralization: no agent is designated as controlling (or the system is effectively reduced to a monolithic system)

=== Self-organisation and self-direction ===

Multi-agent systems can manifest self-organisation as well as self-direction and other control paradigms and related complex behaviors even when the individual strategies of all their agents are simple. When agents can share knowledge using any agreed language, within the constraints of the system&#x27;s communication protocol, the approach may lead to a common improvement. Example languages are Knowledge Query Manipulation Language (KQML) or Agent Communication Language (ACL).

=== System paradigms ===

Many MAS are implemented in computer simulations, stepping the system through discrete &quot;time steps&quot;. The MAS components communicate typically using a weighted request matrix, e.g. 
 Speed-VERY_IMPORTANT: min=45 mph, 
 Path length-MEDIUM_IMPORTANCE: max=60 expectedMax=40, 
 Max-Weight-UNIMPORTANT 
 Contract Priority-REGULAR 
and a weighted response matrix, e.g. 
 Speed-min:50 but only if weather sunny, 
 Path length:25 for sunny / 46 for rainy
 Contract Priority-REGULAR
 note – ambulance will override this priority and you&#x27;ll have to wait

A challenge-response-contract scheme is common in MAS systems, where 
* First a &quot;Who can?&quot; question is distributed.
* Only the relevant components respond: &quot;I can, at this price&quot;.
* Finally, a contract is set up, usually in several short communication steps between sides, 
also considering other components, evolving &quot;contracts&quot; and the restriction sets of the component algorithms.

Another paradigm commonly used with MAS is the &quot;pheromone&quot;, where components leave information for other nearby components. These pheromones may evaporate/concentrate with time, that is their values may decrease (or increase).

=== Properties ===

MAS tend to find the best solution for their problems without intervention. There is high similarity here to physical phenomena, such as energy minimizing, where physical objects tend to reach the lowest energy possible within the physically constrained world. For example: many of the cars entering a metropolis in the morning will be available for leaving that same metropolis in the evening.

The systems also tend to prevent propagation of faults, self-recover and be fault tolerant, mainly due to the redundancy of components.

== Research ==

The study of multi-agent systems is &quot;concerned with the development and analysis of sophisticated AI problem-solving and control architectures for both single-agent and multiple-agent systems.&quot; Research topics include:
* agent-oriented software engineering
* beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDI)
* cooperation and coordination
* distributed constraint optimization (DCOPs)
* organization
* communication
* negotiation
* distributed problem solving
*multi-agent learning
* agent mining 
* scientific communities (e.g., on biological flocking, language evolution, and economics)

== Frameworks ==

Frameworks have emerged that implement common standards (such as the FIPA and OMG MASIF standards). These frameworks e.g. JADE, save time and aid in the standardization of MAS development.

Currently though, no standard is actively maintained from FIPA or OMG. Efforts for further development of software agents in industrial context are carried out in IEEE IES technical committee on Industrial Agents.

With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, LLM-based multi-agent frameworks, such as CAMEL, have emerged as a new paradigm for developing multi-agent applications.

== Applications ==
MAS have not only been applied in academic research, but also in industry. MAS are applied in the real world to graphical applications such as computer games. Agent systems have been used in films. It is widely advocated for use in networking and mobile technologies, to achieve automatic and dynamic load balancing, high scalability and self-healing networks. They are being used for coordinated defence systems.

Other applications include transportation, logistics, graphics, manufacturing, power system, smartgrids, and the GIS.

Also, Multi-agent Systems Artificial Intelligence (MAAI) are used for simulating societies, the purpose thereof being helpful in the fields of climate, energy, epidemiology, conflict management, child abuse, ... Some organisations working on using multi-agent system models include Center for Modelling Social Systems, Centre for Research in Social Simulation, Centre for Policy Modelling, Society for Modelling and Simulation International.

Vehicular traffic with controlled autonomous vehicles can be modelling as a multi-agent system involving crowd dynamics.
Hallerbach et al. discussed the application of agent-based approaches for the development and validation of automated driving systems via a digital twin of the vehicle-under-test and microscopic traffic simulation based on independent agents. Waymo has created a multi-agent simulation environment Carcraft to test algorithms for self-driving cars. It simulates traffic interactions between human drivers, pedestrians and automated vehicles. People&#x27;s behavior is imitated by artificial agents based on data of real human behavior.

<text>Ronald Ralph Schell (born December 23, 1931) is an American actor and stand-up comedian. He appeared on the May 28, 1959, episode of the TV quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, hosted by Groucho Marx. Schell demonstrated a comic barrage of beatnik jive talk. As a stand-up comedian, he first developed his act at the hungry i nightclub in San Francisco, California, and is heard (presumably as the opening act) introducing the Kingston Trio at the start of the group&#x27;s 1962 College Concert album. Schell is probably best known for his 1960s television role as Duke Slater in &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;

==Early life==
Schell was born in Richmond, California, on December 23, 1931. Upon graduation from high school, he served four years in the United States Air Force, where he became an airman first class.

==Career==
In his role as Duke Slater on &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, Schell&#x27;s character was cast for three seasons as a Marine private and best friend of Gomer Pyle. Schell left for a season to star as a disc jockey in his own sitcom, &quot;Good Morning World&quot;. He then returned to &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; as a corporal for its fifth and final season. Schell played Duke Slater as an urban, streetwise character, compared to Pyle&#x27;s rural, bucolic character, as portrayed by Jim Nabors. Returning as a corporal, Slater acted more as a mediator between Pyle and Sgt. Carter, portrayed by Frank Sutton, than as a buddy to Pyle.

Schell lent his voice to &quot;Jason&quot; on the animated series &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; and co-starred as &quot;Mr. Brown&quot; on &quot;The Mouseketeers at Walt Disney World&quot; episode of The Wonderful World of Disney.

His other television guest credits include &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;, &quot;Phil of the Future&quot;, &quot;Yes, Dear&quot;, &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot;, &quot;Step by Step&quot;, &quot;Coach&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;227&quot;, &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, &quot;Empty Nest&quot;, &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;, &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Too Close for Comfort&quot;, &quot;The Brian Keith Show&quot;, &quot;The New Temperatures Rising Show&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;The New Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;That Girl&quot;, &quot;Black Sheep Squadron&quot;, and &quot;Jessie&quot;.

Schell&#x27;s gradual ascendency into the public&#x27;s attention earned him the title &quot;America&#x27;s Slowest Rising Comedian&quot;.

Schell also acted in a few Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) commercials such as &quot;Smile Inspection&quot; and &quot;PSA Gives You A Lift Pageant&quot;. At the end of a Jerry Lewis PSA jingle, a voice said &quot;That was Jerry Lewis for PSA, and this is Ronnie Schell. What did I do wrong?&quot; Schell was the voice for the hockey puck-shaped character on the Peter Puck cartoons, which aired during televised National Hockey League games in the 1970s. From the mid to late 1980s, Schell appeared in numerous television commercials for Shakey&#x27;s Pizza.

In 2007, Schell was part of a touring cabaret show titled, &quot;5 Star Revue&quot; with Gary Collins, Mary Ann Mobley, Ruta Lee, and Steve Rossi. He starred in the 2009 off-Broadway production of &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave it All to Your Children!&quot;, a comedic and musical revue dedicated to aging baby boomers.

Schell was the comedy advisor to Richard Dreyfuss in the 2019 Netflix film &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;.

==Personal life==
He married Janet Rodeberg in 1968; they have two sons, Greg and Chris Schell.

<doc id="938844" wikidata="Q28931" url="?curid=938844" title="Kanō Masanobu">
<text>was a Japanese painter. He was the chief painter of the Ashikaga shogunate and is generally considered the founder of the Kanō school of painting. Kano Masanobu specialized in Zen paintings as well as elaborate paintings of Buddhist deities and Bodhisattvas.

== Life and work ==
Masanobu&#x27;s father had been a samurai and amateur artist named Kanō Kagenobu. Masanobu would start the line of professional artists of the Kanō family. As an artist, Masanobu, like many in his day, was influenced by the priest-painter Tenshō Shūbun, and some sources indicate that he may have received the bulk of his artistic education under Shūbun. Masanobu worked in the &quot;suiboku&quot; ink and wash style, derived from Chinese painting, but brought a Japanese touch to the style with more defined forms. Very few of his works survive with &quot;Zhou Maoshu Appreciating Lotuses&quot; being an exception.

Kanō Masanobu would serve the Ashikaga shogunate as an official painter (御用絵師, &quot;goyō eshi&quot;), succeeding to the post. Although Masanobu&#x27;s father was a samurai, the family was provincial and therefore he did not hold a court rank. Instead of a rank, he had gained his position in service due to a mix of both achievement and social capital. This led to some criticism as aristocrat Shūzan Tōki expressed disdain towards Masanobu stating he was not a &quot;born court painter.&quot;

== Legacy ==
The Kanō school would maintain its dominance as the dominant painting style for over 400 years from Masanobu&#x27;s time up through the Meiji Restoration (1868). However, the school&#x27;s style is neither purely nor mainly Masanobu&#x27;s legacy, as the distinct Kanō style is linked more to Masanobu&#x27;s son Kanō Motonobu, who took over as head of the school after Masanobu.

== Genealogy ==
Masanobu is said to be a descendant of Kanō Muneshige, a samurai of the Kamakura period of the Kanō clan, through his father, Kanō Kagenobu. Through this lineage, Masanobu would descend from the Fujiwara clan through the Kudō clan.

<doc id="938854" wikidata="Q1045125" url="?curid=938854" title="New Jersey Plan">
<text>The New Jersey Plan (also known as the Small State Plan or the Paterson Plan) was a proposal for the structure of the United States government presented during the Constitutional Convention of 1787. Principally authored by William Paterson of New Jersey, the New Jersey Plan was an important alternative to the Virginia Plan proposed by James Madison and Edmund Randolph of Virginia. Its proposals would have created a political entity similar to the modern-day European Union.

The less populous states were strongly opposed to the bicameralism and proportional apportionment of Congress by population called for in the Virginia Plan. Less populous states were concerned that the Virginia Plan would give substantial control of the national government to the more populous states. In response, the less populous states proposed an alternative plan that would have retained the one-vote-per-state representation under one legislative body from the Articles of Confederation. Following the defeat of the New Jersey Plan, Paterson and Madison&#x27;s proposals were reconciled through the Connecticut Compromise, which combined elements of each to create the current structure of Congress today—a Senate in which states are provided equal representation regardless of population, and a House of Representatives in which representatives are apportioned based on population.

==Proposal==
Edmund Randolph proposed the Virginia Plan, written by James Madison, on May 29, 1787. The Virginia Plan called for membership in two houses of the national legislature to be allocated to each state proportional to its population. A significant debate arose on proportional representation following the introduction of the Virginia Plan. Many less populous states, such as Connecticut, Delaware, and New Jersey, feared that proportional representation would result in their interests being overshadowed by those of the larger states. Several of these states threatened to leave the Convention if proportional representation was adopted.

As small state delegates became increasingly alarmed at the debate taking place, William Paterson, with the assistance of Connecticut&#x27;s Roger Sherman, Maryland&#x27;s David Brearley and Luther Martin, and New York&#x27;s John Lansing, proposed a unicameral legislature. Introduced on June 15, the New Jersey Plan would have maintained the Congress of the Confederation but substantially expanded its power.

The less populous states&#x27; alternative plan provided that each state was to have equal representation in the legislature, regardless of their population. This position reflected the belief that the states were independent entities and, as they entered the United States freely and individually, remained so.

The New Jersey Plan proposed:
# The Articles of Confederation should be amended.
# In addition to the existing powers under all of the Articles of Confederation, Congress gained authority to raise funds via tariffs and other measures, and to regulate interstate commerce and commerce with other nations. Cases involving these powers would still be heard by state courts unless appealed to the federal judiciary.
# Congress has the authority to collect taxes from states based on the number of free inhabitants and 3/5ths of slaves in that state. However, this power requires the consent of some proportion of the states.
# Congress elects a federal executive, consisting of multiple people, who cannot be re-elected and can be recalled by Congress when requested by the majority of executives of the states.
# The federal judiciary is represented by a Supreme Tribunal, appointed by the federal executive, which has authority in federal impeachment cases and as the appeal of last resort in cases dealing with national matters (such as treaties).
# The Articles of Confederation and treaties are the supreme law of the land, an early representation in the debates of the Supremacy Clause. The federal executive is authorized to use force to compel non-compliant states to observe the law.
# A policy of admission of new states should be established.
# A singular policy for naturalization should be established.
# A citizen of one state can be prosecuted under the laws of another state in which the crime was committed.

Variations also proposed that state governments must be bound by oath to support the Articles, that a policy should be established to handle territorial disputes, and that the offenses deemed treason should be defined.

==Debate==

After the introduction of the New Jersey Plan, debate over the plan lasted for four days. Even though the New Jersey Plan significantly expanded Congress&#x27;s power, the proposed increases were not sufficient to gain support from any of the more populous states. During debate over the New Jersey Plan, Alexander Hamilton on June 18 presented his own plan to replace the Articles of Confederation. Different from both the Virginia and New Jersey Plans, Hamilton proposed a constitution modeled on that of the United Kingdom. With little debate on Hamilton&#x27;s proposal, attention returned to the New Jersey Plan. Delegates from the more populous states heavily criticized the plan and delegates from the less populous states failed to fully defend it.

Ultimately, on June 19 delegates rejected the New Jersey Plan. Three states voted in favor, seven against, and one divided. Even delegates that helped Paterson author the New Jersey Plan voted against it, including Connecticut&#x27;s Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth. Since several delegates from less populous states failed to strongly defend the proposal during debate or vote in support of it on June 19, some scholars have suggested that the New Jersey Plan was proposed strategically by the less populous states to help secure a compromise on representation by showing that the Virginia Plan&#x27;s proportional representation would never be accepted by the less populous states.

Following the New Jersey Plan&#x27;s defeat, delegates continued to debate representation and the less populous states&#x27; concerns. Delegates from the less populous states proposed combining elements of the Virginia Plan and New Jersey Plan to create a compromise on representation that favored the less populous states. The Connecticut Compromise, introduced by Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, suggested a bicameral legislature with the House of Representatives apportioned by population, as desired by the Virginia Plan, and the Senate apportioned equally by state, as desired by the New Jersey Plan. The Connecticut Compromise was approved by delegates on July 16.

<doc id="938858" wikidata="Q24757533" url="?curid=938858" title="Orthohepevirus A">
<text>The hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative agent of hepatitis E. It is of the species &quot;Orthohepevirus A.&quot;

Globally, approximately 939 million corresponding to 1 in 8 individuals have ever experienced HEV infection. About 15–110 million individuals have recent or ongoing HEV infection.
The virus particle was first seen in 1983, but was only molecularly cloned in 1989.

==Genome and proteome==
&quot;Orthohepevirus A&quot; can be classified into eight different genotypes from different geographical regions: genotype 1 (Asia), genotype 2 (Africa and Mexico), genotype 3 (Europe and North America), genotype 4 (Asia); genotypes 5 and 6 have been detected in Asian wild boar and genotypes 7 and 8 in camels.

The viral genome is a single strand of positive-sense RNA that is about 7200 bases in length. The three open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3) encode for three proteins (O1, O2, O3), two of which are polyproteins, that is, they are cleaved into fragments which carry out the actual functions of the virus (see figure). The O1 protein consists of seven such fragments, namely Met (methyltransferase), Y (Y-domain), Plp (papain-like protease), V (proline-rich variable region), X (X-domain, macro-domain), Hel (helicase), and Rdrp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). The Pvx domain is a fusion protein consisting of the Plp, V, and X domains. The O3 protein is encoded by a single open-reading frame (ORF3). The O2 protein encodes the capsid, which is composed of three domains, namely the shell domain (S) and two protruding domains (P1, P2). Numbers in the figure indicate positions in the RNA sequence.

=== Interactome ===
The protein-protein interactome among &quot;Orthohepevirus A&quot; proteins has been mapped by Osterman et al. (2015), who found 25 interactions among the 10 proteins studied. Almost all (24) of these interactions were considered as of &quot;high quality&quot;.

== Structure ==
The viral particles are 27 to 34 nanometers in diameter and are not enveloped. Although not enveloped, it does have a isosahedral shaped capsid to ensure protection of its RNA genome, and additionally playing a role in the virus&#x27;s attachment and entry into the host.

==Taxonomy==
It was previously classified in the family &quot;Caliciviridae&quot;. However, its genome more closely resembles rubella virus. It is now classified as a member of the genus &quot;Orthohepevirus&quot; in the family &quot;Hepeviridae&quot;.

== Evolution ==
The strains of HEV that exist today may have arisen from a shared ancestor virus 536 to 1344 years ago. Another analysis has dated the origin of Hepatitis E to ~6000 years ago, with a suggestion that this was associated with domestication of pigs. At some point, two clades may have diverged — an anthropotropic form and an enzootic form — which subsequently evolved into genotypes 1 and 2 and genotypes 3 and 4, respectively.

Whereas genotype 2 remains less commonly detected than other genotypes, genetic evolutionary analyses suggest that genotypes 1, 3, and 4 have spread substantially during the past 100 years.

<text>Saleem Malik (Punjabi: ; born 16 April 1963) is a Pakistani former cricketer. He played for the Pakistan national cricket team between 1981/82 and 1999, at one stage captaining the side. He was a wristy, right-handed middle-order batsman who was strong square of the wicket. His off break bowling was also quite effective. Despite playing more than 100 Tests he would go down in cricket history as the first of a number of international cricketers to be banned for match fixing around the start of the 21st century. Saleem is the brother-in-law of former teammate Ijaz Ahmed. He was a part of the Pakistani squad which won the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

He captained Pakistan in 12 Tests, winning 7. In One-Day International cricket, he led his country 34 times, winning 21 of the matches.

==International career==

Malik played his first Test match in March 1982, against Sri Lanka at Karachi. After making 12 in his first innings, he made an unbeaten 100 in the second to set up a declaration. Aged 18 years and 323 days at the time, he was the second youngest player to make a century on Test debut.

During the tour of England in 1987, Malik fell for 99 at Headingley and made 102 at The Oval. He would become familiar with English conditions, playing for Essex for a couple of years during the early 1990s. He had a good season in 1991, scoring 1,972 runs, the 3rd most by a non-English player for Essex.
In Test cricket he performed better against England than any other of his opponents, appearing 19 times and making 1,396 runs at an average of 60.70.

One of his notable performances in One Day International cricket was an innings that he played against India in 1987. Chasing 238 in 40 overs, Pakistan were reduced to 5/161 when Malik arrived at the crease. He scored 72 out of the remaining 77 runs required, in just 36 deliveries. He finished unbeaten and Pakistan won by 2 wickets with 3 balls to spare.

==Match fixing==

Malik captained Pakistan on tours of South Africa and Zimbabwe before being suspended from cricket over accusations of bribery. He was however found innocent and allowed to continue his career. Malik played his last Test match in January 1999 but ended his cricket career in disgrace, with the charge of match fixing, having been given a life ban as a result of Justice Qayyam&#x27;s enquiry in May 2000.

A local court in Lahore lifted the life ban imposed by the Pakistan Cricket Board on 23 October 2008. Civil judge Malik Mohammad Altaf ruled in favour of Malik and quashed the ban imposed for alleged match fixing.

He claimed to have accepted an offer by the PCB to work as the Chief Coach for country&#x27;s National Cricket Academy on 3 November 2008 just days after the ban was lifted, however, the PCB denied making any such offer.

In October 2012, Malik submitted his application to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for the position of batting coach. Earlier that month the PCB had placed an advertisement seeking a batting coach for the national side. He is now planning to establish a cricket academy for young cricketers in Lahore and has been doing his personal business with his long-term partner, Hamza Yusuf.

<doc id="938863" wikidata="Q3535598" url="?curid=938863" title="Ijaz Ahmed (cricketer, born 1968)">
<text>Ijaz Ahmed (Urdu: ) (born 20 September 1968) is a Pakistani cricket coach and former cricketer who played 60 Test matches and 250 One Day Internationals for Pakistan from 1986 to 2001. He was a part of the Pakistani squad which won the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

==Personal life==
Born in Sialkot, his family roots lie in the city of Jalandhar (now in Punjab, India) where some of his cousins still live.

He is a brother-in-law of former Pakistan international cricketer and captain Saleem Malik.

==Career==

=== Cricket career ===
Ahmed scored six Test centuries against the world&#x27;s top-ranked side, Australia – a record number of centuries by a Pakistani against Australia, shared with Javed Miandad. However, 33 of his 92 innings yielded single-figure scores, 54 of them yielded scores below 20.

Ijaz Ahmed came into the national side at the height of the Imran Khan era, and remained on the fringes for nearly a decade, despite several good scores. Dropped after the 1992 World Cup, he came back strongly the following season and established himself at the pivotal &quot;one down&quot; position. He performed poorly at the 1999 World Cup, and the arrival of Younis Khan brought an end to his international career. He formally retired from cricket in 2003.

Ahmed&#x27;s 250 matches is the seventh-highest of all time in Pakistan, behind Shahid Afridi, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Wasim Akram, Saleem Malik, Younis Khan, Waqar Younis and Shoaib Malik.

A powerful hitter of the ball, Ahmed became the second Pakistani batsman to score 10 ODI centuries. At Lahore, in 1997, Ahmed collapsed the Indian bowling attack by making a quick century off just 68 balls including 9 sixes, remaining not out for 139*; his highest ODI score.

In Test cricket, Ahmed scored 12 Test centuries, including his first and only double century against Sri Lanka, when he scored 211. Ahmed is the top scorer for Pakistan side against South Africa.

On 21 April 1997, in a Test match against Sri Lanka, Ahmed was at the crease on 97, when a run-out attempt brought ambiguity in the decision. However, replays declared Salim Malik as dismissed, and Ahmad was called back to the crease. This was the first time for a batsman to return from the pavilion to the crease since 1987.

=== Coaching career ===
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) named fielding coach of that time Ijaz as the national side&#x27;s batting consultant for the upcoming tour of Zimbabwe. He was later appointed assistant coach of the national team before the upcoming tour of Zimbabwe on request of team management.

Ahmed was appointed as the coach of Pakistan&#x27;s Under-19 cricket team on 20 October 2019.

He was the head coach for Lahore Qalandars in the Pakistan Super League.

==International centuries==
Ijaz Ahmed made 22 centuries in international cricket – 12 in Test cricket and 10 in One Day Internationals. He scored his first Test century against Australia at Faisalabad in September 1988, scoring 122. He scored his final Test century, also against Australia at the Perth on in November 1999, scoring 115. His highest Test score is 211, scored against Sri Lanka at Dhaka in 1999.

He scored his first ODI century against Bangladesh at Chittagong, scoring 124*. He scored his final ODI century against England at Sharjah in 1999, scoring 137. His highest ODI score of 139 not out came against India in 1997 at Lahore.

==Controversies==

=== Fraud case ===
In 2009, he was jailed for fake issuance of bank cheques. He was remanded for six weeks in jail and later received a bail. In 2012, a local court charged him with forgery.

=== Racism against Pashtuns ===
Ijaz Ahmed was heavily criticized by a large number of former cricket players, and journalists after he made racist remarks about the number of Pashtun players in the Pakistan cricket team, calling them illiterate and accusing them of not being able to handle pressure because of their upbringing on a talk show in ARY channel.

<doc id="938865" wikidata="Q1538038" url="?curid=938865" title="Gordon Greenidge">
<text>Sir Cuthbert Gordon Greenidge (born 1 May 1951) is a Barbadian retired cricketer who represented the West Indies in Test and One Day International (ODI) teams for 17 years, as well as Barbados and Hampshire in first-class cricket. Greenidge is regarded worldwide as one of the greatest and most destructive opening batsmen in cricket history. In 2009, Greenidge was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He was a member of the squads which won the World Cups in 1975, 1979 and runners-up in 1983.

== Early life ==
Born Cuthbert Gordon Lavine in Saint Peter, Barbados, Greenidge was raised by his mother. At the ages of 8 and 14, he was raised by his grandmother after his mother moved to London, England to find work. His mother married, and Gordon moved to Reading as a 14-year-old to live with her and his stepfather. He described racism frequently while attending school in Reading and left school without any qualifications. He played cricket for his school, and the team won the Reading Schools Cricket League. He was selected to play for the Berkshire Bantams in 1967 and scored 135 runs in their game against Wiltshire. This attracted the attention of Hampshire and Warwickshire County Cricket Clubs, who offered Greenidge a trial.

==Domestic career==
Greenidge began his career in English county cricket with Hampshire in the English County Championship. He joined in April 1968 as a 17-year-old playing for the second eleven and was also given responsibilities such as painting the seating at the ground. His fielding at this stage &quot;left much to be desired&quot;. Nearly losing his contract, Greenidge applied himself over the winter and in 1970 scored 841 runs in 15 second eleven matches and eventually broke into the Hampshire first eleven team averaging 35 in seven matches with four scores over fifty.

He batted as an opener with Barry Richards for Hampshire, first playing together in August 1970. Greenidge said of the experience of playing alongside Richards was &quot;something I shall never forget. It was an education and an inspiration. If, at the end of my career, people talk of Richards and Greenidge in the same breath, then I for one will not mind it in the least&quot;. During his first-class career, he scored a total of 37,000 runs with 92 centuries.

In 1974, Greenidge scored his highest first-class score of 273 not out at Eastbourne for Derrick Robin&#x27;s XI against the Pakistani side who were touring England that year. He said that he had drunk too much lager the night before and had woken up with &quot;the most dreadful hangover&quot;. He did not recollect the innings saying &quot;I middled every ball and yet hardly saw one delivery clearly...I can&#x27;t remember a single shot but when I returned to the pavilion rather later than I had anticipated, I discovered I had made 273 not out&quot;. He hit 13 sixes and 31 fours in the innings.

In 1984, Greenidge achieved the highest batting average of any player during the English season. In his 16 innings, he scored 1,069 runs at an average of 82.23.

He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1985 New Year Honours for services to cricket. Greenidge received the ‘Hampshire Cricket Society Player of the Year’ in 1986 and played his final season for Hampshire in 1987.

Greenidge holds the record for the highest score for Hampshire in a 60-over game, of 177 against Glamorgan, and the highest score in a 40-over game for Hampshire, of 172 against Surrey.

==International career==
Greenidge was eligible to play for England but he opted to play for the West Indies. He played as an opening batsman and he began his Test career in 1974 against India at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore, scoring 93 and 107 on debut.

Greenidge made his ODI debut against Pakistan in the 1975 World Cup. This was a quiet tournament for Greenidge, with his only innings of note being 55 in the semi-final against New Zealand. It took four more years to score an ODI century when he made 106 not out against India at Edgbaston Cricket Ground, Birmingham. His highest score of 133 was made against the same team shortly after the 1983 World Cup. All but two of his ODI centuries were match-winning ones.

The 1975–76 West Indian tour of Australia was considered by Greenidge as &quot;personal nightmare so painful that I have spent my life since trying to erase it from my memory&quot;. Greenidge scored a total of 11 runs in four Test innings and the West Indies lost the series 5–1. He resolved, after that tour, to become &quot;such a consistently high scorer that I could not be ignored&quot;. He said that &quot;I knew from that point I had to tighten my game&quot;.

In the 1976 West Indian tour of England, Greenidge scored over a 1,000 runs for the West Indies. This included his 134 out of the West Indian total of 211 in the first innings and a further century in the second innings of the Old Trafford Test, 84 runs out of the West Indian total of 182 in the first innings of the test at Lord&#x27;s and a century in the Test at Leeds. He scored a further five centuries for the West Indies on tour with one each against Somerset, Leicestershire, Middlesex, Glamorgan and Nottinghamshire. In 1977, Wisden named Gordon Greenidge the Cricketer of the Year.

Greenidge and Desmond Haynes formed a prolific opening partnership, first playing a Test match together in 1978. The pair made 6,482 runs while batting together in partnerships, the third highest total for a batting partnership in Test cricket history as of 2019. Haynes said of Greenidge: &quot;Our opening partnership broke records, but Gordon was the better player. His technique was super, especially against spin&quot;. They enjoyed 16 century opening partnerships in Test matches. They also had success in ODIs with their batting partnerships yielding 5,150 runs at an average of 52.55.

Between 1977 and 1979, Greenidge joined the West Indies team to play in the WSC Super Tests. He was the fifth highest run scorer in this with a total of 754 runs in 13 matches.

Greenidge had a prolific 1979 World Cup scoring 253 runs (the most in the tournament) at an average of 84 with a century against India and 73 runs in the semi-final.

Greenidge released his autobiography during the 1980 tour of England and did not play well on that tour as a result. The Sun newspaper reported extracts of it with appropriately sensational headlines. Greenidge was very upset with what had been published and Clive Lloyd noted that &quot;he was a rather quiet, reserved individual who took failure hard and who was particularly upset by his experiences in Australia in 1975-6 when he had a bad tour but I never expected this type of outburst.&quot;

During the 5th Test of the 1983 series between West Indies and India, Greenidge became the first and, only, person in Test history to be retired not out when not injured. He had to leave the match in Antigua while on 154 to visit his gravely ill daughter, who died two days later, in Barbados.

Greenidge continued scoring runs at the 1983 World Cup with a total of scoring 250 runs at an average of 41 including a century against Zimbabwe. The Final, the third that Greenidge had played in, was a disappointment as Greenidge was bowled out for 1 run in the loss to India.

Greenidge scored two double centuries against England in the 1984 summer Test series. This series was dubbed the &quot;Blackwash&quot; because the West Indies won by a margin of 5–0. Greenidge scored an unbeaten 214 in the second innings of the second Test at Lord&#x27;s in June and followed up with 223 in the fourth Test at Old Trafford in late July.

The 214 was achieved on the fifth and last day of the match as the West Indies successfully chased 342 for victory. It remains the highest run chase at Lord&#x27;s. The innings was described as &quot;a sadistic uncle enjoying an afternoon&#x27;s beach cricket against his nieces and nephews back home in Barbados&quot;. Haynes said of it: &quot;We were chasing 342 on the final day, and everyone thought we&#x27;d bat out time, but Gordon had a different idea. He thought that, if he got going, he could get the runs in an afternoon, and he did&quot;. Chris Broad said &quot;As far as the result was concerned it was a disaster; we lost a game we should have won… Things did not go too badly for the first four days, just on the last day things fell apart — or rather Greenidge pulled a big one out the bag. That innings taught me a bit about being a Test match opener.&quot;

In New Zealand in 1987, Greenidge scored his third Test double century in Auckland to lead the West Indies to a 10-wicket victory. He hit seven sixes and twenty fours in his innings batting for almost two full days. It was considered &quot;a triumph of technique and temperament&quot;.

Greenidge became the first player in ODI history to score a century in his 100th ODI when he scored 102* against Pakistan in 1988. In that game, he achieved that milestone as captain, with his century eventually going in vain as West Indies lost that match.

Gordon Greenidge played in his 100th test match in 1990. This was the fifth test match against England at St Johns Cricket Ground in Antigua. Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes opened the batting with Greenidge scoring 149 before being run out and Haynes scoring 167 runs. They had an opening partnership of 298 runs. The West Indies won the match by an innings and 32 runs.

His final double century was scored at home in Barbados when the West Indies played Australia in 1991. Leading into the game, Greenidge had been going through a lean patch, having scored one fifty in the last 24 innings. He hit an impressive 226 allowing the West Indies to beat Australia by 343 runs. This performance ensured his selection for the subsequent tour of England, which he announced would be his farewell series before retirement: unfortunately, he suffered a knee injury while fielding during the second match of the ODI series, was unable to open the batting (he was held back to 8th in the order), and was unable to play in either the third ODI or the subsequent Tests.


In total, Greenidge played in 108 Test matches, scoring 7,558 runs with 19 centuries, and in 128 ODIs, including the 1975 and 1983 World Cup Finals, scoring 5,134 runs and 11 centuries. He picked up the ‘Man of the Match’ award 20 times in ODIs and a further six times in test matches. He later made an appearance for Scotland.

Described by &quot;ESPNcricinfo&quot; as &quot;brooding and massively destructive&quot;, he was among the 55 initial inductees of the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2009.

Clive Lloyd described Gordon Greenidge as &quot;a very fine player of the moving ball and one of the hardest hitters in my experience. He is immensely strong in the shoulders and arms and he uses this strength to club the ball...he is a magnificent fielder, especially in the slips&quot;.

==Coaching==
Gordon Greenidge decided to pursue a coaching career and became the coach of the Bangladeshi national cricket team in 1996. He was appointed the head coach of the Bangladesh national cricket team in 1997. Under his guidance, the Bangladesh men&#x27;s cricket team won the 1997 ICC Trophy beating 22 other nations. This also ensured the qualification of Bangladesh to the 1999 ICC Cricket World Cup, which was the first ever appearance in top-level cricket. Participating in their very first cricket world cup changed Bangladesh cricket forever and lead to Test cricket status for the Bangladesh national cricket team in 2000, which meant Bangladesh was promoted to full ICC member status and began playing Test cricket matches. Soon after winning the 1997 ICC Trophy, Gordon Greenidge was conferred honorary citizenship of Bangladesh for these outstanding achievements of winning the 1997 ICC Trophy and simultaneously qualifying for the Cricket World Cup. He later served on the West Indies selection committee for Test matches, along with Sir Viv Richards.

==Personal life==
Greenidge&#x27;s son Carl is a former cricketer who coaches at Bancroft&#x27;s School with John Lever. Carl also portrayed his father in the 2021 Indian film 83 which depicts the events of the 1983 Cricket World Cup. He was claimed to be the grandfather of Reiss Greenidge, who is a footballer. However, this was subsequently reported to be untrue.

He received honourary Bangladeshi citizenship for his contribution as a coach of the Bangladesh National Cricket Team. A primary school was named after him in 1993. The Gordon Greenidge Primary School is located in Barbados and was built to amalgamate the St. Boniface Primary School and the Black Bess Primary Schools.

He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to cricket and to the development of sport.

==International cricket centuries==


Greenidge scored 19 Test and 11 ODI centuries. He made his first Test century on debut in 1974 against India. His 214 not out against England in 1984 remains the fifth-highest individual total in the fourth innings of a Test match as of August 2015. His highest score of 226—his final century—was made against Australia in April 1991. Three of his four double-centuries feature in the &quot;Wisden&quot;&#x27;s top 100 batting performances of all time in a 2002 release. Greenidge holds the record for most centuries scored at Old Trafford. He was most prolific against England, accruing seven centuries.

<text>Wilfrid Scawen Blunt (17 August 1840 – 10 September 1922), sometimes spelt Wilfred, was an English poet and writer. He and his wife Lady Anne Blunt travelled in the Middle East and were instrumental in preserving the Arabian horse bloodlines through their farm, the Crabbet Arabian Stud. He was best known for his poetry, which appeared in a collected edition in 1914, and also wrote political essays and polemics. He became additionally known for strongly anti-imperialist views that were still uncommon in his time.

==Early life==
Blunt was the son of Francis Scawen Blunt, of Crabbet, by his wife Mary Chandler. Blunt was born at Petworth House in Sussex, home of his aunt&#x27;s husband Baron Leconfield. He served in the Diplomatic Service 1858–1869. He was raised in the faith of his mother, a Catholic convert, and educated at Twyford School, Stonyhurst, and at St Mary&#x27;s College, Oscott. He was a cousin of Lord Alfred Douglas.

==Personal life==
In 1869 Blunt married Lady Anne Noel, daughter of the Earl of Lovelace and Ada Lovelace, and granddaughter of Lord Byron. Together the Blunts travelled through Spain, Algeria, Egypt, the Syrian Desert, and extensively in the Middle East and India. Based upon pure-blooded Arabian horses they obtained in Egypt and the Nejd, they co-founded Crabbet Arabian Stud. They later bought a property near Cairo named Sheykh Obeyd to house their horse-breeding operation in Egypt.

As an adult Blunt became an atheist, though he underwent episodes of faith. His writings and some of his friendships show he gained a serious interest in Islam and became immersed in its reformist strands. Blunt had supposedly become a convert to Islam under the influence of al-Afghani. He agreed before he died to see a priest, Fr Vincent McNabb, and receive Communion, so fulfilling a prediction of Sir William Henry Gregory, as recalled by his wife: &quot;You will see Wilfrid will die with the wafer in his mouth.&quot;

In 1882, Blunt championed the cause of Urabi Pasha, which led to him being barred from Egypt for four years. Blunt was generally anti-imperialist as a matter of belief. His support for Irish independence led to imprisonment in 1888 for chairing an anti-eviction meeting in County Galway that had been banned by the Chief Secretary, Arthur Balfour. He was held in Galway Prison, then at Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin.

Blunt&#x27;s three attempts to enter Parliament were unsuccessful. He stood as a &quot;Tory Democrat&quot; supporting Irish Home Rule at Camberwell North in 1885 and as a Liberal at Kidderminster in 1886, where he lost by 285 votes. While in prison in Ireland, he contested a Deptford by-election in 1888, but lost by 275 votes.

His most memorable line of poetry on the subject comes from &quot;Satan Absolved&quot; (1899), where the devil, answering a Kiplingesque remark by God, snaps back: &quot;The white man&#x27;s burden, Lord, is the burden of his cash.&quot; Here, Elizabeth Longford wrote, &quot;Blunt stood Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s familiar concept on its head, arguing that the imperialists&#x27; burden is not their moral responsibility for the colonised peoples, but their urge to make money out of them.&quot; Edward Said mentions Blunt by name when describing late 19th and early 20th century Orientalist authors: &quot;[he] believed his vision of things Oriental was individual, self-created out of some intensely personal encounter with the Orient, Islam, or the Arabs&quot; and &quot;expressed general contempt for official knowledge held about the East.&quot; Notably, Said marked Blunt as exceptional in not exhibiting most other Orientalists&#x27; &quot;final...traditional Western hostility to and fear of the Orient.&quot;

Wilfrid and Lady Anne&#x27;s only child to reach maturity was Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth, later known as Lady Wentworth. She was married in Cairo when she was an adult, but in 1904 she relocated permanently to the Crabbet Park Estate.

Wilfrid had mistresses, including long-term relations with a courtesan, Catherine &quot;Skittles&quot; Walters, and a Pre-Raphaelite beauty, Jane Morris, the wife of his friend William Morris. He seduced and impregnated his cousin Mary Wyndham, having previously been the lover of her mother. Eventually he moved another mistress, Dorothy Carleton, into his home. This triggered Lady Anne&#x27;s legal separation from him in 1906. At the time, Lady Anne signed a Deed of Partition drawn up by Wilfrid, under terms unfavourable to Lady Anne, whereby she kept the Crabbet Park property, where their daughter Judith lived, and half the horses, while Blunt took Caxtons Farm, also known as Newbuildings, and the rest of the stock. Always struggling with financial concerns and chemical dependency issues, Wilfrid sold off numerous horses to pay debts and constantly attempted to obtain additional assets. Lady Anne left the management of her properties to Judith and spent many months of each year in Egypt at the Sheykh Obeyd estate, moving there permanently in 1915.

Due primarily to Wilfrid&#x27;s manœuvring to disinherit Judith and obtain the entire Crabbet property for himself, Judith and her mother were estranged at the time of Lady Anne&#x27;s death in 1917. As a result, Lady Anne&#x27;s share of the Crabbet Stud passed to Judith&#x27;s daughters, under the oversight of an independent trustee. Blunt filed a lawsuit soon afterwards. Ownership of the Arabian horses went back and forth between the estates of father and daughter in subsequent years. Blunt sold more horses to pay off debts and shot at least four in an attempt to spite his daughter, an action which led to intervention of the trustee of the estate with a court injunction to prevent him from further &quot;dissipating the assets&quot; of the estate. The suit was settled in favour of the granddaughters in 1920 and Judith bought their share from the trustee, combining it with her own and reuniting the stud. Father and daughter briefly were reconciled shortly before Wilfrid Scawen Blunt&#x27;s death in 1922, but his promise to rewrite his will to restore Judith&#x27;s inheritance was not kept.

Blunt was a friend of Winston Churchill, aiding him in a 1906 biography of his father, Lord Randolph Churchill. Blunt had befriended him in 1883 at a chess tournament.

==Work in Africa==

In the early 1880s, Britain was increasing its influence in Egypt. It established a &quot;veiled protectorate&quot; through military occupation in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War. In the autumn of 1881, Wilfrid Blunt&#x27;s ship ran aground in the Suez Canal. Rather than remain idle at Suez for a few days, Blunt visited friends in Cairo. It is untrue that &quot;he was sent to notify Sir Edward Malet, the British agent, of Egyptian public opinion about the recent changes in government and development policies.&quot; Blunt was in Cairo by accident and, again by accident, met Sheikh al Jasraji, who was close to Ahmed &#x27;Urabi. Blunt then met his old friend Malet, the British Consul General, and began to play the role of intermediary.

In mid-December 1881, Blunt met with &#x27;Urabi, known as Arabi or &quot;El Wahid&quot; (the Only One) due to his popularity with the Egyptians. &#x27;Urabi was impressed with Blunt&#x27;s enthusiasm and appreciation of Egyptian culture. Blunt was under the influence of Afghani&#x27;s disciple, Muhammad Abduh and had recently written some articles on the future of Islam. Their mutual respect helped &#x27;Urabi to peacefully explain the reasoning behind his new Egyptian nationalist movement, &quot;Egypt for the Egyptians&quot;. Over the course of several days, Arabi explained the complicated background of the revolutionaries and their determination to rid themselves of the Ottoman oligarchy.

Wilfrid Blunt was not vital in the relay of this information to the British Consul General in Egypt, as everybody in Egypt knew that the indigenous Egyptians resented foreigners – whether they were Muslim Turko-Circassian or Christian Greek, Italian or Armenian – who were growing rich while the natives remained in poverty. Blunt felt he had been used by Malet and Auckland Colvin who were only pretending to be sympathetic to the Nationalists. However, Malet, Colvin, Evelyn Baring (Lord Cromer), and other British officials dismissed Blunt as a romantic idealist of a quixotic type. Indeed, his own claim to be for Arabs what Byron had been to the Greeks, was sufficient to make him utterly ridiculous to the British public because he was not considered a good poet, whereas Byron was considered one of the greatest British poets of all time.

After the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, Blunt was banned from Egypt, while Urabi was exiled to Ceylon.

Blunt remained vigorously opposed to colonial expansion in Africa, writing three books outlining his views: &quot;The Secret History of the English Occupation of Egypt...&quot; (1907), &quot;Gordon at Khartoum&quot; (1911), and &quot;My Diaries: Being a Personal Narrative of Events, 1888–1914&quot; (2 vols. 1919–1920). 

Historian Robert O. Collins wrote, &quot;The most vigorous English advocate of Egyptian nationalism, Blunt was both arrogant and irascible, his works scathing, discursive, and at times utterly ridiculous. Immature and unfair, both he and his writings must be used with caution, but even the dullest of men will come away stimulated if not aroused and with fresh insights to challenge the sometimes smug attitudes of British officials in Whitehall and Cairo. Of course, to them Blunt was anathema if not disloyal and Edward Mallet, the British Consul-General at Cairo from 1879 to 1883, replied to Blunt&#x27;s charges in his posthumously published &quot;Egypt, 1879–1883&quot; (London, 1909).&quot;

==Egyptian Garden scandal==
In 1901, a pack of foxhounds was shipped to Cairo to entertain the army officers. A fox hunt then took place in the desert near Cairo. The fox was chased into Blunt&#x27;s garden, and the hounds and hunt followed it. As well as a house and garden, the land contained the Blunts&#x27; Sheykh Obeyd stud farm, housing a number of valuable Arabian horses. Blunt&#x27;s staff challenged the trespassers – who, though army officers, were not in uniform – and beat them when they refused to turn back. For this, the staff were accused of assault against army officers and imprisoned. Blunt made strenuous efforts to free his staff, much to the embarrassment of the British army officers and civil servants involved.

<text>Pietro Loredan (1372 – 28 October 1438) was a Venetian nobleman of the Loredan family and a distinguished military commander both on sea and on land. He fought against the Ottomans, winning the Battle of Gallipoli (1416), played a leading role in the conquest of Dalmatia in 1411–1420, and participated in several campaigns against Venice&#x27;s Italian rivals, Genoa and Milan, to secure Venice&#x27;s mainland domains (Terraferma). He also held a number of senior political positions as &quot;Avogador de Comùn&quot;, ducal councillor, and governor of Zara, Friuli, and Brescia, and was honoured with the position of Procurator of St Mark&#x27;s in 1425. In 1423, he contended for the position of Doge of Venice, but lost to his bitter rival Francesco Foscari; their rivalry was such that when Loredan died, Foscari was suspected of having poisoned him.

==Early life and career==
Pietro Loredan was born in 1372, in the parish of St. Canciano in Venice. He was a scion of a veritable dynasty of admirals: his father Alvise Loredan and grandfather, and later his son Giacomo and nephew Alvise, were all distinguished naval commanders in the service of the Republic of Venice. His father was further distinguished by being elected to the highly prestigious position of Procurator of St Mark&#x27;s. His mother, Joan, appears to have been from a wealthy family. Pietro Loredan married at a young age, probably in 1395, to Campagnola Vitale Lando di Pietro. Some historians report a second marriage, to a Foscolo, in 1422, but as Campagnola survived her husband and is still mentioned in his will, this is evidently erroneous.

Loredan commanded the galley which, at Manfredonia in June 1401, the young Michael of Rhodes (known for his &quot;Book of Michael of Rhodes&quot;) joined as an oarsman. In 1403, he served as commander of one of the three galleys that conveyed the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos () back to Constantinople, after his voyage in the courts of Western Europe. On the return journey, the three ships joined with the Venetian fleet under Carlo Zeno, and participated in the Venetian victory against the Genoese fleet of Marshal Boucicaut at the Battle of Modon on 7 October 1403.

==Military and political career, 1411–1422==
Loredan probably continued to serve in the fleet thereafter, until 1411, when he is attested for the first time as fleet commander (Captain of the Gulf), at the signing of the Treaty of Selymbria between Venice and the Ottoman prince and contender for the Ottoman throne, Musa Çelebi, on 3 September 1411. He was then ordered to go to Zara in Dalmatia, as the King of Hungary (and Holy Roman Emperor-elect) Sigismund was fighting to expand into Venetian holdings. As captain-general, he obtained the capitulation of Šibenik on 21 July 1412, and hastened to the assistance of the Venetian land forces at Motta di Livenza, helping them score a decisive victory in the Battle of Motta against Sigismund&#x27;s troops on 24 August. Having helped secure Dalmatia for Venice, Loredan then came into conflict with his lifelong rival, Francesco Foscari, the Doge of Venice (leader of the republic); unlike Foscari, who advocated expansion in the Italian mainland (the Terraferma), Loredan was a proponent of Venice&#x27;s maritime orientation.

In October 1412, Loredan was named ducal councillor, but held the post only briefly, as he was elected governor (&quot;podesta&quot;) of Treviso. The city constituted the &quot;pivot of the Venetian defence system in the east&quot;, and Loredan busied himself with strengthening its fortifications over the next year. On 26 June 1414, he was elected, along with Lorenzo Capello and Vitale Miani, as &quot;provveditore&quot; over Dalmatia. There he was active in the suppression of pro-Hungarian moves among the local nobility, and in the preparations for a new fortification of Zara. On 5 April 1415, he was appointed commander of the annual trade convoy (&quot;muda&quot;) to Flanders. Upon his return, he was elected as an &quot;Avogador de Comùn&quot; (public prosecutor), but again held the post for a short while because on 2 April 1416, he was chosen as captain of the Gulf to lead an expedition to the Ottoman Empire. The Great Council of Venice charged him with conveying Venetian ambassadors to the Sultan, and exhausting peaceful means, but in the event, on 29 May 1416, at the Battle of Gallipoli, Loredan scored a major victory against the Ottoman fleet, destroying or capturing most of its vessels. Loredan himself was wounded in the battle. Despite this success, the conflict was not concluded until November 1419, when a peace treaty was signed following exhaustive negotiations. Nevertheless, on his return to Venice on 8 November 1416, Loredan was feted as a hero.

In spring 1417, he was sent as an envoy to Milan to complain about the occupation of Lodi, Como, and other places whose autonomy had been guaranteed by Venice. Then he was appointed rector at Zara, where he remained until late 1418. Upon completion of his term there, he was again selected as &quot;Avogador de Comùn&quot;. In September 1419, he was elected as one of the committee of five wise men (&quot;savi di Terraferma&quot;) charged with overseeing the final phase of the Venetian conquest of Dalmatia and Friuli. As Sigismund was preoccupied with dealing with the Hussite Rebellion, the Venetians moved in to secure their claims on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea. Loredan was again named captain of the Gulf on 8 February 1420, and set sail from Venice on 12 May. By the end of June, he had secured the surrender of Trogir and Split, and between September and October he brought the islands of Brač, Korčula, and Hvar under Venetian control. In February 1421, he was sent to the Levant to counter the Genoese Giovanni Ambrogio Spinola, who was raiding Venetian commercial shipping in the area. On is return in summer, he was sent to Friuli as its &quot;luogotenente&quot; (&quot;Lieutenant&quot;, i.e., governor). His selection for the post was probably influenced by the fact that the area had been conquered by his nephew, Francesco Loredan, the previous year.

On 3 November 1422, serving again as captain of the &quot;muda&quot; of Flanders, and re-appointed again as ducal councillor, he was present at the registration of his son, Francesco, in the &quot;Golden Book&quot;, the book containing the names of the nobles eligible for public office.

==Contender for the Dogate, 1423==
On 4 April 1423, the Doge Tommaso Mocenigo died at a critical juncture: the next Doge would have to make decisions affecting the course of the Republic, particularly regarding the continued expansion in the Terraferma or a reaffirmation of the traditional maritime policy. A successful commander, well educated and a capable orator, Loredan had all the prerequisites necessary for the position, but in the end it was his old rival, Francesco Foscari, who was elected. The two men were fierce rivals, their political differences reinforced by personal relationships. Thus two of Loredan&#x27;s daughters, Maria and Marina, were married to Francesco Barbaro and Ermolao Donà respectively, both of them opponents of Foscari. Furthermore, when Foscari proposed a marriage between his own daughter and one of Loredan&#x27;s sons, it was rejected.

==Military and political career, 1424–1438==

Despite this setback, on 12 January 1424, Loredan was again elected as captain-general of the Gulf, with the task of assisting Thessalonica, which the Republic had acquired the previous year, by attacking Gallipoli and applying military and diplomatic pressure on the Ottoman Sultan Murad II to recognize Venetian possession of the city. Loredan led his fleet to patrol the Dardanelles from July to October, and fought a number of engagements with the Turks. This prompted the Byzantine emperor to send Loredan a number of holy relics as a token of gratitude. Despite Loredan&#x27;s activities, however, the conflict continued fruitlessly for the Venetians, amidst increasing suffering and discontent for the inhabitants of Thessalonica, until the city was conquered by the Ottomans in March 1430.

He remained &quot;savio del consiglio&quot;, until he was elected as Procurator of St Mark&#x27;s on 17 June 1425. At this time, Venice decided to join the war between the ruler of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, and the Republic of Florence, as Visconti&#x27;s successes were threatening the balance of power in Italy. In 1426, Loredan was appointed as &quot;provveditore&quot; of the army along with Fantino Michiel, and accompanied the &quot;condottiere&quot; Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola in the conquest of Brescia (10 August 1426). Loredan remained in the city as rector over the next year. In summer 1427 he repelled a Milanese attack on Brescia, and was one of the driving forces in getting Carmagnola to abandon his dilatory stance and confront the Milanese, leading to the victory of the Battle of Maclodio on 11 October.

Loredan disappears from the sources for the next few years until 1431, when the war between Venice and Milan was renewed. On 28 May 1431, he was appointed as captain-general of the Sea and charged with sailing into the Tyrrhenian Sea, joining with the Florentines, and capturing Genoa, which had joined Visconti. The Venetian fleet gained a major victory over the Genoese at Rapallo on 21 August 1431, but the Venetians failed in their efforts to overthrow the Genoese government. Loredan then led his fleet to winter in Apulia and Corfu. Returning to the Tyrrhenian Sea, he stormed the fortress of Sestri in July, where he was wounded; unable to contribute anything more to the campaign, he returned with his fleet to Venice, where they arrived on 22 October 1431.
Over the next few years, Loredan served alternately as &quot;savio del consiglio&quot; and ducal councillor for the &quot;sestiere&quot; of San Marco. When the conflict with Milan broke out again, Loredan was once again appointed &quot;provveditore&quot; of the army on 9 April 1437, under the commander-in-chief Gianfrancesco Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua, but poor health forced him to leave his post and return to Venice, being replaced by Paolo Tron. The war began badly for the Venetians, however, and as soon as Loredan was restored to health in November, he was sent to join the army and raise its faltering morale. He was joined by his son Giacomo Loredan, who thus began his own distinguished military career. By that time, it became clear that Gonzaga was considering defecting from Venice to the Milanese. On 21 June 1438 Loredan was elected as ambassador to the Marquess, in a last-ditch effort to prevent his defection, but Loredan refused. On 13 July 1438, he was appointed commander of the naval forces on the Po River. His appearance alone was sufficient to quell a riot by the troops in the Piazza San Marco. Nevertheless, the campaign went badly: Loredan was unable to exercise his accustomed tactics in a river, his actions were dependent on the course of the land campaign, and the climate once again affected his health.

On 23 August 1438, Loredan dictated his last will, and on 21 October, obtained permission to return to Venice, being replaced by Stefano Contarini. He arrived in Venice on 26 October 1438, &quot;&quot;molto agravato da mal&quot; and died two days later. He was buried in the Monastery of St. Helena (demolished in the Napoleonic period). His tomb&#x27;s inscription claimed that he was poisoned by unknown enemies(&quot;per insidias hostium veneno sublatus&quot;&quot;); popular legend ascribed the deed to the Doge Francesco Foscari. Loredan left behind a series of &quot;Commentaries&quot;, well-regarded by the contemporary historian (and Loredan&#x27;s subordinate at Brescia) Flavio Biondo, but now lost.

<text>Martin Lloyd Love (born 30 March 1974) is a former Australian cricketer who played in five Test matches from 2002 to 2003. He was a right-handed batsman.

==Early life==
Love was educated at Mundubbera State School and Toowoomba Grammar School. He graduated with a degree in physiotheraphy from The University of Queensland in 1997.

==Cricket==
He made 146 for Queensland in the 1994–95 Sheffield Shield final when team won their first Shield for 68 years. In 2002 he set a Durham record by making 251. He improved on that with a 273 in 2003.

His Test debut was in the 2002–03 Ashes Series in Australia where he played in the 4th and 5th Tests, making 62*, 6*, 0 and 27. This was followed with a single Test in Barbados (36 &amp; 2) and two Tests against Bangladesh in Australia in 2003 in which he made a duck and 100 not out. Martin Love signed a contract for Warwickshire CCC in October 2006, but injured himself before joining up with the squad and was subsequently replaced by Kumar Sangakkara

On Damien Martyn&#x27;s return from injury, Love was dropped from the Test squad.

On 24 February, Love announced he would retire at the end of the 2008–09 Australian cricket season to pursue a career in physiotherapy. He scored 219 not out in his last home match, followed by 104 not out in his last Sheffield Shield innings against Victoria at Junction Oval. This gave Love the distinction of scoring an unbeaten century in both his final Test and first class innings.

<text>&quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; is the sixth episode of the American science-fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, which originally aired October 26, 1987, in broadcast syndication in the United States. A high-definition, remastered version of the episode received a limited theatrical release for one day (along with the episode &quot;Datalore&quot;) to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series on July 23, 2012. The story was originally developed with the title &quot;Where None Have Gone Before&quot; and was based on Diane Duane&#x27;s book, &quot;The Wounded Sky&quot;. Duane and Michael Reaves pitched the idea to David Gerrold and Gene Roddenberry, and then submitted a script. Their script was subsequently rewritten by Maurice Hurley, whose first effort was poorly received; however, he subsequently rewrote it and that version was filmed. The episode was the first of the series directed by Rob Bowman, who went on to direct 12 more episodes. It was the only &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; assignment for writers Duane and Reaves.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship &quot;Enterprise-D&quot;. In &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot;, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is visited by Mr. Kosinski (Stanley Kamel) and an alien known as the Traveler (Eric Menyuk). The Traveler sends the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to distant parts of the universe, and help is required from Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) to bring the ship back home.

In this episode, Menyuk made the first of three appearances as the Traveler. Biff Yeager made his first appearance as the longest-running chief engineer of the first season.

==Plot==
The &quot;Enterprise&quot; rendezvous with the USS &quot;Fearless&quot; to bring aboard Mr. Kosinski (Kamel), a Starfleet propulsion expert who plans to run tests on the warp engines to improve their efficiency. Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) is skeptical of Kosinski&#x27;s seemingly nonsensical specifications, suggesting his apparent success on other ships was merely addressing inherent design flaws on older engines, whereas the &quot;Enterprise&quot; engines are brand new.

Kosinski arrives with his assistant, an alien from Tau Alpha C who claims his name is unpronouncable and asks them to refer to him as Kosinski&#x27;s Assistant. As Kosinski and the Assistant explain the tests to the engineering crew, Wesley Crusher (Wheaton) quickly grasps what the tests are designed to accomplish and the Assistant expresses admiration for his problem-solving abilities.

The test quickly goes awry when the &quot;Enterprise&quot; speeds up, surpassing the known capabilities of warp engines. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) orders the ship stopped, and the crew finds themselves on the far side of the M33 Galaxy (more than 2.7 million light-years from the Milky Way, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s home galaxy). Although Kosinski is pleased with the results, Picard reprimands him and asks him to simply redo the process to return home.

Crusher attempts to warn Riker that during the warp test, the Assistant appeared to &quot;phase&quot;, drifting in and out of reality, but Riker dismisses him without listening. However, after Kosinski begins the second test, Crusher and Riker both observe the Assistant again drifting out, appearing more tired. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; again experiences a burst of speed, and when it stops, the crew cannot determine their position. Picard demands that Kosinski get the crew home.

While Kosinski, the Assistant, and the engineering crew work on reversing the process, the rest of the crew begins experiencing lifelike visions of their past. After having a vision of his mother (Herta Ware), Picard surmises that they have arrived at the theoretical Outer Rim of the universe, and issues a red alert to awaken the crew from their visions.

Riker suggests that Kosinski may have had nothing to do with the warp jumps, which were more likely done by the Assistant himself, resulting in his weakness. Picard finds the alien in sick bay, dying, but Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) cannot evaluate the Assistant&#x27;s alien biology, and is unable to treat him.

The Assistant explains he is a Traveler with the ability to channel thought into reality, brought the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to the Outer Rim, triggering similar effects in anyone within it to ascertain if they were ready to experience thought as reality, and apologizes for bringing them before they were ready. The Traveler confides to Picard that he looks for scientific prodigies such as the young Crusher, and suggests that Picard nurture him.

When he returns to the engineering section, the Traveler asks Crusher to assist him in returning the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to known space. As they concentrate, beginning to return the ship home, the Traveler again phases and finally disappears completely. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; is back in Federation space. After the incident, Picard promotes Crusher to acting ensign (following his own unspoken suggestion in &quot;The Naked Now&quot;) on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for his performance.

==Production==
===Writing===
The original story for &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; was developed before the start of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, with Michael Reaves and Diane Duane invited to pitch story ideas. Duane did not belong to the Writers Guild of America (a requirement to write for the show at the time), and doubted she would be asked to write a script. Duane and Reaves worked together on several ideas, and after a week, Reaves informed Duane that he developed an idea based on her 1983 &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel &quot;The Wounded Sky&quot; and asked her to collaborate with him. She worked on the story idea with Reaves, and they expanded the story slightly from Reaves&#x27; original idea. One version of the script involved the &quot;Enterprise&quot; causing the birth of a new universe, with a play on the Genesis creation narrative.

They pitched the story to story editor David Gerrold, who brought them to &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry. Gene favored the story idea, suggesting changes, which Reaves and Duane incorporated into a second draft. The episode was now entitled &quot;Where None Have Gone Before&quot;, differing significantly from the final version: Kosinski was a roommate of Picard&#x27;s at Starfleet Academy, and instead of the Traveler, the ship&#x27;s extreme propulsion was provided by a &quot;warpdrive booster&quot; with a miniature black hole. The resolution of the plot involved imagining a duplicate miniature &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the interaction between the black holes on the two ships&#x27; propulsion units. After Duane and Reaves turned in the first version of the script based on that premise, nothing was heard from the &quot;TNG&quot; staff for two weeks.

The script was given to Maurice Hurley to rewrite. He took six weeks for the rewrite, and his initial version was received poorly by &quot;TNG&quot; executives. Hurley later said, &quot;they absolutely hated it, I think they wanted to fire me, and they would have if I didn&#x27;t have a guaranteed contract&quot;. He rewrote the script, and this version was filmed. Hurley was pleased with the result, saying that &quot;everything about that episode worked&quot;. The final version differed significantly from the original Reaves-Duane script. Duane later said that only two scenes remained: where Picard sees his mother, and where he nearly falls out of the turbolift into space. Reaves later said that the episode &quot;came together much better on the screen than we thought it would when we read the script. We were lucky, because it was out of our hands&quot;.

===Direction and casting===

Donald Petrie was originally signed to direct the episode, but dropped out to direct the film &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot;. Executive producer Robert Justman brought in Rob Bowman to direct his first &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode. Justman later said that this was one of his most significant achievements on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. Bowman worked on storyboards and set blocking for 20 days before shooting the episode. He was initially nervous about working on the show, and felt he had to prove himself because of his relative inexperience as a director. Bowman said that after the second day of filming, it became easier, and credited the crew with making him feel welcome. He went on to direct twelve more episodes of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;.

Eric Menyuk was cast as the Traveler. The actor had previously been runner-up for the role of Data several weeks earlier (the role went to Brent Spiner). He was a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan since age six, and would later return as the Traveler twice more: in &quot;Remember Me&quot; and &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;. Menyuk&#x27;s return in &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; would also mark the last on-screen appearance of Wesley Crusher. Biff Yeager made his &quot;Next Generation&quot; debut in &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; as Chief Engineer Argyle, who would become the most frequently appearing chief engineer of the first season (appearing twice). Geordi La Forge took over that role in the first episode of season two, &quot;The Child&quot;. Stuntman &quot;Dangerous&quot; Dennis Madalone also made his series debut as the science division crewman threatened by his own (imagined) fire. From season three onwards he was stunt coordinator for &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, and continued to portray a number of crew members. Viewers learned Picard&#x27;s mother&#x27;s first name in &quot;Chain of Command&quot;; she was played in &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; by Herta Ware, who appeared in the 1985 science-fiction film &quot;Cocoon&quot;.

===Visual effects and makeup===

Some effects in the episode were created in Robert Legato&#x27;s basement with water reflections and Christmas tree lights. The script was vague about what was seen at the end of the universe, so Legato played with the effects of water reflections on his basement wall. Shooting through BoPET film, he created multiple images that were layered over one another for the final effect (which Legato described as &quot;peculiar and bizarre&quot;). Christmas tree lights were suspended and moved, to create the blinking effect seen on screen.

The Klingon Targ was created by dressing a tamed wild boar (named Emmy Lou) in an outfit created by costume designer William Ware Theiss. Executive producer Robert Justman later recalled, &quot;That pig smelled horrid. A sweet-sour, extremely pungent odor. I showered and showered, and it took me a week to get rid of it!&quot; To appear as the Traveler, Eric Menyuk wore a prosthetic piece (created by Michael Westmore) on his forehead, which ran into his hairline. He also wore a pair of false three-fingered hands, which were sold in the &quot;It&#x27;s A Wrap!&quot; auction after the end of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. His Traveler costume was also sold at the auction.

===Music===
&quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; was the second episode scored by Ron Jones. Some themes in the soundtrack were rearrangements of Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s score from &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. In the piece &quot;Talk with Mom&quot; (played during Picard&#x27;s meeting with his mother), Jones tried to create an effect identical to the finale of Aaron Copland&#x27;s 1944 &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot;. Alexander Courage&#x27;s themes from &quot;The Original Series&quot; are included in a seven-note ostinato in the pieces &quot;Log&quot;, &quot;Visitors&quot;, and &quot;Fly-By&quot;.

The score was recorded with a 40-piece orchestra. Jones formatted the orchestra to generate a bigger sound than normally heard on television soundtracks to make it sound more like Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; score. Keyboards were used to make the cellos more prominent, and other changes included an increase in the midrange of the string section. The soundtrack to &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; was released (as part of &quot;The Ron Jones Project&quot; box set of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; scores) in a limited run of 5,000 copies in 2010 by &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; aired in broadcast syndication during the week commencing October 24, 1987. It received a Nielsen rating of 10.5, reflecting the percentage of all households watching the episode during its timeslot. This was the highest rating received by the series since &quot;The Naked Now&quot; three episodes earlier.

Several reviewers revisited the episode after the end of the series. Cast member Wil Wheaton later described the episode as &quot;the first time &quot;The Next Generation&quot; really started to come together&quot;. However, the episode was flawed in dialogue and in Picard&#x27;s changes in tone: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure if that was a deliberate choice, so he would appear as a conflicted man, or if it was Patrick Stewart&#x27;s natural warmth and kindness coming through the gruff demeanour Picard was written to have.&quot; When reviewing the show in 2006 for AOL TV, he gave it an overall score of B-plus. Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com, praising the guest actors: Stanley Kamel was &quot;magnificent&quot; and &quot;ooze[d] arrogance, overconfidence, and bull in equal measure&quot;, while Herta Ware brought &quot;tremendous &quot;gravitas&quot;&quot; to her role. He described the episode as the best of the first season, with strong performances from the main cast, and gave it an overall score of eight (out of ten).

Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website Jammer&#x27;s Reviews, said that it was the first time in the series that space itself generated &quot;awe and wonder&quot;; however, he thought the &quot;fresh and intriguing&quot; nature of the episode faded as it went along. He criticized Wesley Crusher, describing him as a &quot;cloying geek&quot; and &quot;you just want to strangle him&quot;. He gave the episode a score of 2.5 (out of 4).

In Richard Hanley&#x27;s book &quot;The Metaphysics of Star Trek&quot; the appearance of the Traveler in &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; was described as a continuation of intellectually advanced aliens in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, beginning in &quot;The Original Series&quot; with Apollo in &quot;Who Mourns for Adonais?&quot; and Gary Mitchell in &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;. Metaphysics is referenced in this episode by Wesley Crusher, who asks if thought is the basis of existence.

==Home media and theatrical release==
The first home-media release of &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; was on VHS cassette on April 1, 1992 in the United States and Canada. The episode was later included on the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; season-one DVD box set released in March 2002.

Episodes from &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; to &quot;Datalore&quot; were released in Japan on LaserDisc on June 10, 1995, as part of &quot;First Season Part.1&quot;. This included the first season episode &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot;, and the set has a total runtime of 638 minutes across multiple 12-inch optical video discs.

The episode was released as part of the season-one Blu-ray set on July 24, 2012. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and promote the release of the first season on Blu-ray, the episodes &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; and &quot;Datalore&quot; received a theatrical release in the United States on July 23, 2012 in nearly 500 theaters. &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; was chosen by &quot;Star Trek&quot; experts Mike and Denise Okuda because of the unusual space special effects.

<doc id="938876" wikidata="Q1226918" url="?curid=938876" title="Rhodesia (region)">
<text>Rhodesia, known initially as Zambesia, is a historical region in southern Africa whose formal boundaries evolved between the 1890s and 1980. Demarcated and named by the British South Africa Company (BSAC), which governed it until the 1920s, it thereafter saw administration by various authorities. It was bisected by a natural border, the Zambezi. The territory to the north of the Zambezi was officially designated Northern Rhodesia by the company, and has been Zambia since 1964; that to the south, which the company dubbed Southern Rhodesia, became Zimbabwe in 1980. Northern and Southern Rhodesia were sometimes informally called &quot;the Rhodesias&quot;.

The term &quot;Rhodesia&quot; was first used to refer to the region by European settlers in the 1890s who informally named their new home after Cecil Rhodes, the company&#x27;s founder and managing director. It was used in newspapers from 1891 and was made official by the company in 1895.

To confuse matters, Southern Rhodesia, which became a self-governing colony of the United Kingdom in 1923, referred to itself simply as &quot;Rhodesia&quot; from 1964 to 1979, and in 1965 unilaterally declared independence under that name. It thereafter briefly renamed itself &quot;Zimbabwe Rhodesia&quot; in 1979.

The usage of the term Rhodesia to refer to the historical region fell from prominence after Northern Rhodesia became Zambia in 1964. From then until 1980, &quot;Rhodesia&quot; commonly referred to Southern Rhodesia alone. Since 1980 the term has not been in general use, aside from in a historical context.

== Etymology ==
When Europeans settled what became &quot;Southern Rhodesia&quot; in 1890, and when the British South Africa Company was chartered to administer &quot;North-Western Rhodesia&quot; and &quot;North-Eastern Rhodesia&quot;, it was not under those names, but the names of the parts—&quot;Mashonaland&quot;, &quot;Matabeleland&quot;, &quot;Barotseland&quot;, and so on. The territories were initially collectively referred to as &quot;Zambesia&quot; (Cecil Rhodes&#x27;s preferred name), &quot;Charterland&quot; (Leander Starr Jameson&#x27;s proposal) or &quot;the BSAC territories&quot;. 

&quot;Rhodesia&quot; was used informally by the settlers from the start of &quot;White&quot; settlement, and was common enough usage for newspapers to start using it in articles in 1891. In 1892 it was used for the name of the first newspaper in Salisbury, &quot;The Rhodesia Herald&quot;. The BSAC officially adopted the name &quot;Rhodesia&quot; in May 1895, and the British government followed in 1898. &quot;It is not clear why the name should have been pronounced with the emphasis on the second rather than the first syllable,&quot; Robert Blake comments, &quot;but this appears to have been the custom from the beginning and it never changed.&quot;

The first official use of &quot;Rhodesia&quot; was actually for a boma on Lake Mweru, established in 1892 near the mouth of the Kalungwishi River under the authority of Alfred Sharpe, the British Commissioner of the British Central Africa protectorate in Nyasaland. After &quot;Rhodesia&quot; became the official name of the territories in 1895, the boma&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Kalungwishi&quot;. It was closed some years later.

Although &quot;Northern Rhodesia&quot; was not an official name until 1911 when Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia were combined, the name was used informally from 1895 onwards when referring to those two territories collectively.

==Public holidays==

Public holidays observed in Rhodesia were largely based around milestones in the region&#x27;s short history. Annual holidays marked various aspects of the arrival of white people to the region during the 1880s and 1890s, as well as the respective unilateral declarations of independence (1965) and of republican government (1970). On these days, most businesses and non-essential services closed. A number of Christian holidays were also observed according to custom, in the traditional British manner, and referred to in official documents by name—Christmas Day, for example, or Easter Monday.

<doc id="938883" wikidata="Q701609" url="?curid=938883" title="Rubella virus">
<text>Rubella virus (RuV) is the pathogenic agent of the disease rubella, transmitted only between humans via the respiratory route, and is the main cause of congenital rubella syndrome when infection occurs during the first weeks of pregnancy.

Rubella virus, scientific name &quot;Rubivirus rubellae&quot;, is a member of the genus &quot;Rubivirus&quot; and belongs to the family of &quot;Matonaviridae&quot;, whose members commonly have a genome of single-stranded RNA of positive polarity which is enclosed by an icosahedral capsid.

 the molecular basis for the causation of congenital rubella syndrome was not yet completely clear, but &quot;in vitro&quot; studies with cell lines showed that rubella virus has an apoptotic effect on certain cell types. There is evidence for a p53-dependent mechanism.

==Taxonomy==
Rubella virus (&quot;Rubivirus rubellae&quot;) is assigned to the &quot;Rubivirus&quot; genus.

===&quot;Matonaviridae&quot; family===
Until 2018, Rubiviruses were classified as part of the family &quot;Togaviridae&quot;, but have since been changed to be the sole genus of the family &quot;Matonaviridae&quot;. This family is named after George de Maton, who in 1814 first distinguished rubella from measles and scarlet fever. The change was made by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the central governing body for viral classification. &quot;Matonaviridae&quot; remains part of the realm that it was already in as &quot;Togaviridae&quot;, &quot;Riboviria&quot;, because of its RNA genome and RNA dependent RNA polymerase&quot;.&quot;

===Other rubiviruses===
In 2020, Ruhugu virus and Rustrela virus joined Rubella virus as second and third of only three members of the genus &quot;Rubivirus&quot;. Neither of them are known to infect people.

== Morphology ==
While alphavirus virions are spherical and contain an icosahedral nucleocapsid, RuV virions are pleiomorphic and do not contain icosahedral nucleocapsids.

=== Phylogeny ===
ICTV analyzed the sequence of RuV and compared its phylogeny to that of togaviruses. They concluded:Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of alphaviruses, rubella virus and other positive-sense RNA viruses shows the two genera within the &quot;Togaviridae&quot; are not monophyletic. In particular, rubella virus groups more closely with members of the families &quot;Benyviridae&quot;, &quot;Hepeviridae&quot; and &quot;Alphatetraviridae&quot;, along with several unclassified viruses, than it does with members of the family &quot;Togaviridae&quot; belonging to the genus &quot;Alphavirus&quot;. 

==Structure==
The spherical virus particles (virions) of Matonaviridae have a diameter of 50 to 70 nm and are covered by a lipid membrane (viral envelope), derived from the host cell membrane. There are prominent &quot;spikes&quot; (projections) of 6 nm composed of the viral envelope proteins E1 and E2 embedded in the membrane.

The E1 glycoprotein is considered immunodominant in the humoral response induced against the structural proteins and contains both neutralizing and hemagglutinating determinants.
=== Capsid protein ===
Inside the lipid envelope is a capsid of 40 nm in diameter. The capsid protein (CP) has different functions. Its main tasks are the formation of homooligomeres to form the capsid, and the binding of the genomic RNA. Further is it responsible for the aggregation of RNA in the capsid, it interacts with the membrane proteins E1 and E2 and binds the human host-protein p32 which is important for replication of the virus in the host.

As opposed to alphaviruses the capsid does not undergo autoproteolysis, rather is it cut off from the rest of the polyprotein by the signal-peptidase. Production of the capsid happens at the surface of intracellular membranes simultaneously with the budding of the virus.
==Genome==
The positive-strand RNA genome has 9,762 nucleotides and encodes 2 nonstructural polypeptides (p150 and p90) within its 5′-terminal two-thirds and 3 structural polypeptides (C, E2, and E1) within its 3′-terminal one-third. 
Both envelope proteins E1 and E2 are glycosylated.

There are three sites that are highly conserved in Matonaviruses: a stem-and-loop structure at the 5&#x27; end of the genome, a 51-nucleotide conserved sequence near the 5&#x27; end of the genome and a 20-nucleotide conserved sequence at the subgenomic RNA start site. Homologous sequences are present in the rubella genome.

The genome encodes several non-coding RNA structures; among them is the rubella virus 3&#x27; cis-acting element, which contains multiple stem-loops, one of which has been found to be essential for viral replication.

The only significant region of homology between rubella and the alphaviruses is located at the NH2 terminus of non structural protein 3. This sequence has helicase and replicase activity. In the rubella genome these occur in the opposite orientation to that found in the alphaviruses indicating that a genome rearrangement has occurred.

The genome has the highest G+C content of any currently known single stranded RNA virus (~70%). Despite this high GC content its codon use is similar to that of its human host.

== Replication ==
The viruses attach to the cell surface via specific receptors and are taken up by an endosome being formed. At the neutral pH outside of the cell the E2 envelope protein covers the E1 protein. The dropping pH inside the endosome frees the outer domain of E1 and causes the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. Thus, the capsid reaches the cytosol, decays and releases the genome

The +ssRNA (positive, single-stranded RNA) at first only acts as a template for the translation of the non-structural proteins, which are synthesized as a large polyprotein and are then cut into single proteins. The sequences for the structural proteins are first replicated by the viral RNA polymerase (Replicase) via a complementary −ssRNA as a template and translated as a separate short mRNA. This short subgenomic RNA is additionally packed in a virion.

Translation of the structural proteins produces a large polypeptide (110 kDa). This is then endoproteolytically cut into E1, E2 and the capsid protein. E1 and E2 are type I transmembrane proteins which are transported into the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) with the help of an N-terminal signal sequence. From the ER the heterodimeric E1·E2-complex reaches the Golgi apparatus, where the budding of new virions occurs (unlike alpha viruses, where budding occurs at the plasma membrane.
The capsid proteins on the other hand stay in the cytoplasm and interact with the genomic RNA, together forming the capsid.
== Transmission ==
RuV is transmitted via respiration between humans.

==Epidemiology==
On the basis of differences in the sequence of the E1 protein, two genotypes have been described which differ by 8 - 10%. These have been subdivided into 13 recognised genotypes - 1a, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F, 1G, 1h, 1i, 1j, 2A, 2B and 2C.

For typing, the WHO recommends a minimum window that includes nucleotides 8731 to 9469.

Genotypes 1a, 1E, 1F, 2A and 2B have been isolated in China.

Genotype 1j has only been isolated from Japan and the Philippines.

Genotype 1E is found in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe.

Genotype 1G has been isolated in Belarus, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Uganda.

Genotype 1C is endemic only in Central and South America.

Genotype 2B has been isolated in South Africa.

Genotype 2C has been isolated in Russia.

<text>Timothy Brian Gibbs (born April 17, 1967) is an American actor who has starred in films, such as &quot;11-11-11&quot; as Joseph Crone and &quot;The Kings of Brooklyn&quot; as Maximilian Sentor and television programs, such as &quot;Sex and the City&quot; as Detective Stevens.

==Life and career==
Gibbs was born in Calabasas, California. He began his acting career at age ten in commercials and later guest starring in television series before getting his first prominent role as Will Adams in the NBC drama series &quot;Father Murphy&quot; which ran from 1981 to 1983. He also played Chad Everett&#x27;s son on the short-lived NBC series &quot;The Rousters&quot;.

He is perhaps best known for starring in soap operas such as &quot;Another World&quot; as Gary Sinclair from 1995 to 1998 and &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; as Dash Nichols from 1990 to 1992.

In 2000, Gibbs was nominated for an Emmy award for his portrayal of the fictional character Kevin Buchanan (from 1998 to 2001) on the television series &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

In 2003, Gibbs was used as a model for the designing of the video game character Max Payne in the sequel &quot;Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne&quot;. 

Gibbs co-founded the Alkeme Company, a media firm based in Barcelona, Spain and Los Angeles, California.

In 2013, Gibbs created and produced the CIA procedural drama &quot;I/Nation&quot;, a television series in which he portrays Sidney &quot;Sid&quot; Porter, a self-destructive CIA agent. Gibbs wrote each of the thirteen episodes which make up the show&#x27;s premier season and directed the series pilot.

In 2015, Gibbs, a lifelong collector, founded Gibbs &amp; Son Ltd, a vintage furniture showroom located in Sant Cugat del Valles, Spain.

<doc id="938894" wikidata="Q635485" url="?curid=938894" title="Sedimentation">
<text>Sedimentation is the deposition of sediments. It takes place when particles in suspension settle out of the fluid in which they are entrained and come to rest against a barrier. This is due to their motion through the fluid in response to the forces acting on them: these forces can be due to gravity, centrifugal acceleration, or electromagnetism. Settling is the falling of suspended particles through the liquid, whereas sedimentation is the final result of the settling process.

In geology, sedimentation is the deposition of sediments which results in the formation of sedimentary rock. The term is broadly applied to the entire range of processes that result in the formation of sedimentary rock, from initial erosion through sediment transport and settling to the lithification of the sediments. However, the strict geological definition of sedimentation is the mechanical deposition of sediment particles from an initial suspension in air or water.

Sedimentation may pertain to objects of various sizes, ranging from large rocks in flowing water, to suspensions of dust and pollen particles, to cellular suspensions, to solutions of single molecules such as proteins and peptides. Even small molecules supply a sufficiently strong force to produce significant sedimentation.

==Principles==

===Settling===
===Classification===
Classification of sedimentation:
*Type 1 sedimentation is characterized by particles that settle discretely at a constant settling velocity, or by the deposition of Iron-Rich minerals to streamlines down to the point source. They settle as individual particles and do not flocculate (stick to each other) during settling. Example: sand and grit material
*Type 2 sedimentation is characterized by particles that flocculate during sedimentation and because of this their size is constantly changing and therefore their settling velocity is changing. Example: alum or iron coagulation
*Type 3 sedimentation is also known as zone sedimentation. In this process the particles are at a high concentration (greater than 1000 mg/L) such that the particles tend to settle as a mass and a distinct clear zone and sludge zone are present. Zone settling occurs in lime-softening, sedimentation, active sludge sedimentation and sludge thickeners.

===Sedimentation equilibrium===

When particles settling from a suspension reach a hard boundary, the concentration of particles at the boundary is opposed by the diffusion of the particles. The distribution of sediment near the boundary comes into sedimentation equilibrium. Measurements of the distribution yields information on the nature of the particles.

==In geology==

In geology, the term &quot;sedimentation&quot; is broadly applied to the entire range of processes that result in the formation of sedimentary rock, from initial formation of sediments by erosion of particles from rock outcrops, through sediment transport and settling, to the lithification of the sediments. However, the term is more particularly applied to the deposition of sediments, and in the strictest sense, it applies only to the mechanical deposition of sediment particles from an initial suspension in air or water. Sedimentation results in the formation of depositional landforms and the rocks that constitute the sedimentary record. The building up of land surfaces by sedimentation, particularly in river valleys, is called &quot;aggradation&quot;.

The rate of sedimentation is the thickness of sediment accumulated per unit time. For suspended load, this can be expressed mathematically by the Exner equation. Rates of sedimentation vary from less than per thousand years for pelagic sediment to several meters per thousand years in portions of major river deltas. However, long-term accumulation of sediments is determined less by rate of sedimentation than by rate of subsidence, which creates accommodation space for sediments to accumulate over geological time scales. Most sedimentation in the geologic record occurred in relative brief depositional episodes separated by long intervals of nondeposition or even erosion.

In estuarine environments, settling can be influenced by the presence or absence of vegetation. Trees such as mangroves are crucial to the attenuation of waves or currents, promoting the settlement of suspended particles.

===Siltation===
An undesired increased transport and sedimentation of suspended material is called siltation, and it is a major source of pollution in waterways in some parts of the world. High sedimentation rates can be a result of poor land management and a high frequency of flooding events. If not managed properly, it can be detrimental to fragile ecosystems on the receiving end, such as coral reefs. Climate change also affects siltation rates.

=== Human-enhanced sedimentation ===
==In chemistry==
In chemistry, sedimentation has been used to measure the size of large molecules (macromolecule), where the force of gravity is augmented with centrifugal force in an ultracentrifuge.

<doc id="938898" wikidata="Q3110724" url="?curid=938898" title="Goodnight Kiwi">
<text>The Goodnight Kiwi is an animated short which has been used to signal the end of nightly broadcasts on Television New Zealand channels. The &quot;Goodnight Kiwi&quot; features two characters: the eponymous Goodnight Kiwi (later also called TV Kiwi), and his companion, simply known as &quot;The Cat&quot;. The animation was introduced in 1975 on TV2, and used on South Pacific Television between 1976 and 1980. Between 1980 and 19 October 1994, the animation was screened again on TV2. This animation returned on 6 September 2007 for use on TVNZ 6 when the channel ended transmission at midnight. TVNZ U also used the &quot;Goodnight Kiwi&quot; at midnight before overnight service.

The short was animated by Sam Harvey (1923–2014), with music arrangement by Bernie Allen and sound by Gary Potts.

== Plot and overview ==

Three different clips have been used through time:

The first version of the clip was used when TV2 first signed off in 1975. In this version, the Kiwi was a director. The cartoon began with the Kiwi yawning in the director&#x27;s chair. Kiwi wakes up the cat, while a few of broadcasting equipment move away. The Kiwi then goes to the back of the studio, cuts the power and turns on the outside lights. Then the Kiwi put the empty bottle and the cat outside, but without it knowing the cat goes outside again while Kiwi is waving to the audience. Following this, the Kiwi exits the studio, pulling down a shade revealing &quot;GOODNIGHT FROM TV2&quot;. This version was thought to only exist in the form of small clips until TVNZ released it online for public viewing on 15 September 2016.

The second version of the &quot;Goodnight Kiwi&quot; clip was used by South Pacific Television somewhere between 1976 and 1980 and saw the Goodnight Kiwi living in a television camera (his cat had disappeared). After dusting his camera, throwing a blanket on top of it, winking at the audience, and turning out the lights, the kiwi would close the side flaps on the camera and then the South Pacific Television logo (reading &quot;GOOD NIGHT FROM SOUTH PACIFIC TELEVISION&quot;) would appear as the music faded out. This version was also thought to only exist in the form of small clips until TVNZ released this version to their YouTube channel on 4 November 2019. During transmission breakdowns, a still picture of the Goodnight Kiwi was often used, in poses including one of sweeping the floor and accidentally smashing one of the television monitors with a broom, or accidentally cutting a wire. 

The third iteration appeared in 1980 and aired on both channels until 1989. The one-minute-long animation begins with Goodnight Kiwi and the Cat in the master control room. Kiwi shuts down the screens and starts an audio cassette playing an instrumental arrangement of the lullaby &quot;Hine E Hine&quot; by Fanny Howie, this is accompanied by a continuity announcer bidding goodnight to viewers, Kiwi walks through the studio while Cat jumps and pulls faces into a camera. Kiwi turns out the lights, puts an empty bottle on the porch and locks the door, while the cat heads upstairs to the studio roof. The Kiwi follows and rides an elevator (presumably just after it had been used by the cat) to the top of a transmission mast. At the top, Kiwi covers himself in blankets (in which the cat was already curled up) and goes to sleep in a satellite dish with the Cat sitting on his stomach. The animation closes with the words: &quot;Goodnight from TELEVISION NEW ZEALAND&quot;.
(until
There was a slight variation of the ending – from 1989 onwards, the &quot;Goodnight Kiwi&quot; was only seen on Channel 2 (TV1 adopted its closedown sequence, featuring the National Anthem) and ended with a voiceover stating &quot;it&#x27;s goodnight from Channel 2&quot; and displaying the Channel 2 logo. On 19 October 1994, the last &quot;Goodnight Kiwi&quot; was broadcast on TV2. On the next day, TVNZ started to broadcast for 24 hours on both TV1 and TV2, so there was no need to use &quot;the Goodnight Kiwi&quot; cartoon anymore. The &quot;Goodnight Kiwi&quot; clip was used from 1980 to 1994 in its &quot;first era&quot;. Later TVNZ revived &quot;The Goodnight Kiwi&quot; cartoon in 2007 and used to end programming on TVNZ 6 because the channel did not broadcast for 24 hours. The only difference between the original and the TVNZ 6 version was that the cartoon was displayed in 16:9, instead of 4:3, with some parts being cropped. There was also a lower third, which was displayed at the end of the cartoon. Lower third displayed: &quot;&quot;Goodnight from TVNZ 6&quot;.

This same cartoon was also used for TVNZ 7, which displayed this same version as TVNZ 6, but with a lower third saying: &quot;Goodnight from TVNZ 7&quot;.&quot; There was also a small alteration later on its final day, saying: &quot;&quot;Goodbye from TVNZ 7&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Goodnight Kiwi&quot; was the last video ever played on this channel, as TVNZ 7 pulled the plug on June 30, 2012.

The animation, characters and music are regarded as part of New Zealand culture and icons of kiwiana.

== Return of the Kiwi ==
Eric Kearley, head of the TVNZ Digital Channel Launch team at the time, stated in a message board response that the &quot;Goodnight Kiwi&quot; would return to TV on Freeview on TVNZ 6 which began broadcasting on 6 September 2007 – a move which proved popular with New Zealand television viewers. New Christmas animations featuring the Kiwi and Cat characters were introduced by TV One on 1 December 2008.

It was also the final clip played on TVNZ 7, with the message &quot;Goodbye from TVNZ 7&quot;, before the station was shut down at midnight on 30 June 2012, and converted to TV One Plus 1 (now TVNZ 1 +1), a 1-hour delayed broadcast of TV One (now TVNZ 1).

In 2019, the Kiwi returned once more as a TV series. The Goodnight Kiwi Stories featured prominent New Zealanders – including PM Jacinda Ardern – reading children&#x27;s books in English and/or te reo Māori to help kids get to sleep. The show is only available on TVNZ+ (formerly TVNZ OnDemand).

There is a Matariki television special, &quot;Kiwi and Cat: Mānawātia a Matariki&quot;, where Kiwi and Cat learn about the stars of Matariki. The special features guest cameos, including &quot;Wellington Paranormal&quot;, Dame Lisa Carrington, Temuera Morrison, Jason Gunn and Benee.

== In popular culture ==

* TVNZ referred to the Goodnight Kiwi character as &quot;TV Kiwi&quot; in its cartoon merchandise. TVNZ produced a variety of &quot;Goodnight Kiwi&quot; memorabilia in the 1980s, including the magazine &quot;TV Kiwi&quot; and a book of short stories, &quot;TV Kiwi and the Cat&quot;.
* TVNZ 7 presenter Olly Ohlson used the name TV Kiwi for the character and occasionally performed a song &#x27;The T. V. K. I. W. I.&#x27; on his afternoon show &quot;After School&quot;.
* Clips from, and references to, the Goodnight Kiwi occasionally appear in locally produced television, including an advertisement for the Retirement Commission&#x27;s website Sorted.org.nz, in which a list of New Zealand&#x27;s favourite logos appear in a group therapy session.
* In 2004, composer Victoria Kelly wrote a solo piano piece inspired by this animation. It was one of the set of 12 Landscape Preludes commissioned by Stephen de Pledge.

<doc id="938905" wikidata="Q913841" url="?curid=938905" title="Bridget Jones">
<text>Bridget Rose Jones is a fictional character created by British writer Helen Fielding. Jones first appeared in Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; column in &quot;The Independent&quot; in 1995, which did not carry any byline. Thus, it seemed to be an actual personal diary chronicling the life of Jones as a thirtysomething single woman in London as she tries to make sense of life, love, and relationships with the help of a surrogate &quot;urban family&quot; of friends in the 1990s. The column was, in fact, a lampoon of women&#x27;s obsession with love, marriage and romance as well as women&#x27;s magazines such as &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and wider social trends in Britain at the time. Fielding published the novelisation of the column in 1996, followed by a sequel in 1999 called &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot;.

Both novels were adapted for film in 2001 and 2004, starring Renée Zellweger as Bridget Jones, and Hugh Grant and Colin Firth as the men in her life: Daniel Cleaver and Mark Darcy, respectively. After Fielding had ceased to work for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in late 1998, the feature began again in &quot;The Independent&quot; on 4 August 2005 and finished in June 2006. Helen Fielding released a third novel in 2013 (&quot;Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy&quot;, which is set 14 years after the events of the second novel), and a fourth in 2016 (&quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Baby: The Diaries&quot;, where Bridget finds herself unexpectedly pregnant without being certain who the father is).

&quot;Bridget Jones&quot; is hailed as a British cultural icon and was named on the 2016 &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; Power List as one of seven women judged to have had the biggest impact on women&#x27;s lives over the past 70 years.

==Plot summary==

===Original column and novelizations===
The plot of the first novel is loosely based on &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

Jones is a Bangor University graduate. She is a 34-year-old (32 in the first film adaptation) single woman whose life is a satirized version of the stereotypical single London 30-something in the 1990s and very unlucky in love. She has some bad habits—smoking and drinking—but she annually writes her New Year&#x27;s resolutions in her diary, determined to stop smoking, drink no more than 14 alcohol units a week, and eat more &quot;pulses&quot; and try her best to lose weight.

In the two novels and screen adaptations, Bridget&#x27;s mother is bored with her life as a housewife in the country and leaves Bridget&#x27;s father. Bridget repeatedly flirts with her boss, Daniel Cleaver. A successful barrister named Mark Darcy also keeps popping into Bridget&#x27;s life, being extremely awkward, and sometimes coming off a bit rude. After Bridget and Mark reach an understanding of each other and find a sort of happiness together, she gains some self-confidence and dramatically cuts down on her alcohol and cigarette consumption. However, Bridget&#x27;s obsession with self-help books plus several misunderstandings cannot keep the couple together forever.

===Return to the &quot;Independent&quot;===
The new &quot;Independent&quot; column was set in the then-present day of 2005 and 2006, with references being made to events such as the River Thames whale, and has dropped some of the motifs of the original diary, particularly the alcohol unit and calorie counts. Despite the time advance, Cleaver and Darcy were still the two men in Jones&#x27; life (&quot;I&#x27;m not sleeping with them both at once,&quot; she explains later to her friend Shazza. &quot;I accidentally slept with each of them separately&quot;), and the plot line launched into a pregnancy. As Fielding said, &quot;she&#x27;s heading in a different direction.&quot;

The column is continued into 2006. In the last entry, Bridget Jones gave birth to a baby boy, fathered by Daniel Cleaver, and moved in with him. However, Mark was not entirely out of the picture, as he previously suggested that he would like to adopt the child. The column finished with the note, &quot;Bridget is giving every attention to the care of her newborn son – and is too busy to keep up her Diary for the time being.&quot;

==History==

===Original column===
In the mid-1990s, Charles Leadbeater, at the time the features editor of the English newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot;, offered Helen Fielding, then a journalist on &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, a weekly column about urban life in London designed to appeal to young professional women. Fielding accepted and Bridget Jones was born on 28 February 1995. The instantaneous popularity of the columns led to the publication of the first book, &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;, in 1996.

The column appeared regularly every Wednesday on the pages of &quot;The Independent&quot; for almost three years: the last one was published on 10 September 1997. A couple of months later, on 15 November 1997, Helen Fielding resumed her weekly diary in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Fielding ceased to work for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on 19 December 1998.

====Novelizations====

The column was made into a novel in 1996, &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;. The plot is very loosely based on &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen. Critics assert that Fielding&#x27;s book arguably began the popular fiction movement known as chick lit. The second book, &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot;, was published on 1998, and was based on the plot of another of Austen&#x27;s novels, &quot;Persuasion&quot;.

Fielding named the character of Mark Darcy after the &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; character Fitzwilliam Darcy and described him exactly like Colin Firth, who played Mr Darcy in the 1995 BBC adaptation. Mark Darcy was also partly modelled on a friend of Fielding&#x27;s called Mark Muller, a barrister with chambers in Gray&#x27;s Inn Square; and the Kurdish revolutionary leader whom Darcy defends in the movie was inspired by a real case of Muller&#x27;s. The character of Shazzer was reportedly based on Sharon Maguire, who is a friend of Fielding and would become director of the film.

A third book was published in October 2013, titled &quot;Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy&quot;. The novel is set in present-day London; Bridget is 51, still keeping a diary, but is also immersed in texting and experimenting with social media. It is revealed in the book that Mark Darcy had died five years earlier and that they have two children, Billy and Mabel, aged seven and five respectively. Publication of the novel was set for &quot;Super Thursday&quot;, in preparation for Christmas. However, a mistake occurred in the early book prints which combined sections of the novel with Sir David Jason&#x27;s autobiography. Vintage explained the error as &quot;a Bridget moment&quot; and recalled the books.

===Return to &quot;The Independent&quot;===
The feature began again in &quot;The Independent&quot; on 4 August 2005 with a &quot;Sunday 31 July&quot; entry. A book containing the original columns for 1995 was given away with the paper the following Saturday. This relaunch of the column is also printed in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;. The &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; reviewed the new column rather favourably, commenting that Fielding&#x27;s satire was in good form.

===Connections to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;===
Helen Fielding (as Bridget Jones) wrote of her love of the 1995 BBC adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; in her &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; column during the original British broadcast, mentioning her &quot;simple human need for Darcy to get off with Elizabeth&quot; and regarding the couple as her &quot;chosen representatives in the field of shagging, or rather courtship&quot;. Fielding loosely reworked the plot of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; in her 1996 novelization of the column, naming Bridget&#x27;s uptight love interest &quot;Mark Darcy&quot; and describing him exactly like Colin Firth. Following a first meeting with Firth during his filming of &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; in 1996, Fielding asked him to collaborate in what would become an eight-page interview between Bridget Jones and Firth in her 1999 sequel novel, &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot;. Conducting the real interview with Firth in Rome, Fielding lapsed into Bridget Jones mode and obsessed over Darcy in his wet shirt. Firth participated in the following editing process of what critics would consider &quot;one of the funniest sequences in the diary&#x27;s sequel&quot;. Both novels make various other references to the BBC serial.

&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; screenwriter Andrew Davies collaborated on the screenplays for the 2001 and 2004 &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; films, which would show Crispin Bonham-Carter (Mr Bingley in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;) and Lucy Robinson (Mrs Hurst) in minor roles. The self-referential in-joke between the projects intrigued Colin Firth and he accepted the role of Mark Darcy, as it gave him an opportunity to ridicule and liberate himself from his &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; character. Film critic James Berardinelli would later state that Firth &quot;plays this part [of Mark Darcy] exactly as he played the earlier role, making it evident that the two Darcys are essentially the same&quot;. The producers never found a solution to incorporate the &quot;Jones&quot; Firth interview in the second film but shot a spoof interview with Firth as himself and Renée Zellweger staying in-character as Bridget Jones after a day&#x27;s wrap. The scene is available as a deleted scene on DVD.

==Adaptations==
===Screen===

The first novel was turned into a film of the same name in 2001, directed by Sharon Maguire. The movie starred Renée Zellweger as Bridget, Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver and Colin Firth as Mark Darcy. Before the film was released, a considerable amount of controversy surrounded the casting of the American Zellweger as what some saw as a quintessentially British heroine: however, her performance is widely considered to be of a high standard, including a perfect English accent, and garnered Zellweger a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. A second film was released in 2004, directed by Beeban Kidron. There are many differences between the books and the films. A third film, &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Baby&quot;, was released on 16 September 2016. Patrick Dempsey was cast as Jack Qwant. A fourth film, adapting &quot;Mad About the Boy&quot;, was released in February 2025. Actors Renée Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are joined by Leo Woodall (as Bridget&#x27;s young love interest) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (as a teacher).

===Musical===

Lily Allen wrote a musical based on the novel, which was &#x27;workshopped&#x27; in London with a cast including Sheridan Smith in the title role. Although a full production was anticipated for some time, Allen has since said she doubts it will &#x27;see the light of day&#x27;.

<text>In some religions, an unclean animal is an animal whose consumption or handling is taboo. According to these religions, persons who handle such animals may need to ritually purify themselves to get rid of their uncleanliness.

==Judaism==
In Judaism, the concept of &quot;impure animals&quot; plays a prominent role in the Kashrut, the part of Jewish law that specifies which foods are allowed (&quot;kosher&quot;) or forbidden to Jews. These laws are based upon the Books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy of the Torah and in the extensive body of rabbinical commentaries (the Talmud).

The concept of unclean animals is also mentioned in the Book of Genesis, when Noah is instructed to bring into the Ark all sorts &quot;of pure beasts, and of beasts that are impure, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth&quot;.

In the Torah, some animals are explicitly named as pure or impure, while others are classified by anatomical characteristics or other criteria. In some cases, there is some doubt as to the precise meaning of the Biblical Hebrew animal name.

According to Jewish dietary laws, to be &quot;pure&quot; an animal must also be free from certain defects and must be slaughtered and cleaned according to specific regulations (&quot;Shechita&quot;).

Any product of an impure or improperly slaughtered animal is also non-kosher. Animal gelatin, for example, has been avoided, although recently kosher gelatin (from cows or from fish prepared according to kosher regulations) has become available.; the status of shellac is controversial. The prohibitions also extend to certain parts of pure animals, such as blood, certain fat tissues, and the sciatic nerves.

Finally, it is forbidden to cook the meat of an animal in the milk or dairy product of that same animal, which has in turn led to the traditional practice of using separate complete sets of kitchen utensils for meat and dairy so as to totally ensure this rule is not broken.

===Classification of animals===

The Torah does not classify animals under modern scientific categories such as mammals, fish, reptiles, birds, etc. Rather, the religious categories are land-dwelling animals (land mammals, flightless birds, and land reptiles, etc.), flying animals (birds, insects, flying mammals such as bats), and given that each of these religious categories of animals includes species of at least two or more of each scientific categories of animals, there is no general &quot;kashrut&quot; rules relating per se to mammals, birds, reptiles, or fish. However, rules for each of these classes of animals can be extrapolated from the biblical requirements.

==== Mammals ====
According to the Torah, land-dwelling animals that &quot;both&quot; chew the cud (ruminate) and have cloven hooves, are kosher.

By these requirements, any land-dwelling animal that is kosher can only possibly be a mammal, but even then, permitted are only those mammals that are placentals and strictly herbivorous (not omnivores nor carnivores) that both ruminate and also have cloven hooves, such as bovines (cattle/cows, bison, buffalos, yak, etc.), sheep, goats, deer, antelope, and giraffes; there is no tradition for the consumption of giraffe by any Jewish community.

All other mammals, land-dwelling or otherwise, are forbidden by the Torah, including &quot;crawling creatures&quot; such as mice, and flying mammals such as the various species of bats.

Also forbidden are water-bound mammals, such as whales, dolphins, seals, and dugongs, as they do not have the characteristics required of water-bound creatures to be kosher; the creature must possess both fins and scales to be kosher.

Land-dwelling mammals possessing only one of the two characteristics of kosher land-dwellers, such as the camel who ruminates but has no cloven hooves or the pig who possesses cloven hooves but does not ruminate, are not kosher. These two animals are cited explicitly.

Given these conditions, there is no kosher land-dwelling non-mammal.

==== Fish ====

According to , anything that comes from the water (&quot;in the seas, and in the rivers&quot;) that has both fin and scales may be eaten. By these requirements, fish are the only possible kosher water-dwelling creatures. Because all creatures possessing both fins and scales also possess an endoskeleton and gills, any creature possessing lung or an exoskeleton is not kosher.

As every fish possessing scales also possesses fins, any water-dwelling creature possessing scales is kosher.

==== Birds ====
The Torah names only a few birds that may not be eaten; those not in the list are presumed to be kosher. However, the precise identity of the unclean birds is a matter of contention in traditional Jewish texts. It is therefore common to eat only birds with a clear &quot;masorah&quot; (tradition) of being kosher in at least one Jewish community, such as domestic fowl.

Leviticus 11 lists the non-kosher flying creatures. The Hebrew names listed are translated in the English Standard Version of the Bible as follows:
* Cormorant
* Eagle
* Gull
* Hawk
* Heron
* Hoopoe
* Red and Black Kite
* Osprey
* Owl (Horned, Screech, Little, White, and Desert)
* Raven
* Stork
* Vulture and Black Vulture
* Bats

==== Insects ====

 details which insects are not to be eaten, though all insects are considered impure to avoid mistaken consumption.

An exception is made for certain locusts (&quot;Schistocerca gregaria&quot;), which are traditionally considered kosher by some Yemenite Jewish communities.

Bees&#x27; honey is considered kosher as the honey is not made of bees.

===Explicit list===

The following animals are considered to be impure according to and , based on Rashi&#x27;s identification:
* Bat
* Camel
* Chameleon
* Coney (hyrax)
* Cormorant
* Cuckow (cuckoo)
* Eagle
* Ferret
* Frog
* Gier eagle
* Glede
* Great owl
* Hare
* Hawk
* Heron
* Kite
* Lapwing
* Little owl
* Lizard
* Mole
* Mouse
* Night hawk
* Osprey
* Ossifrage
* Owl
* Pelican
* Pig
* Raven
* Snail
* Stork
* Tortoise
* Vulture
* Weasel
===Reasons===
Some scholars have conjectured that the Jewish concept of &quot;unclean animals&quot; arose out of public health concerns by community leaders, since, in the conditions of the times, some of those animals were indeed more likely to cause food poisoning or transmit diseases to people who consumed them.

British anthropologist Mary Douglas proposed that the &quot;unclean&quot; label had philosophical grounds, namely it was cast on foods that did not seem to fall neatly into any symbolic category. The pig, for example, was seen as an &quot;ambiguous&quot; creature, because it has cloven hooves like cattle, but does not chew cud.

==Christianity==
In the very early days of Christianity it was debated if converts ought to follow Jewish customs (including circumcision and dietary laws) or not. According to the account of the Council of Jerusalem in , a compromise was reached between those who wanted full compliance and those who favored a more liberal view. It was agreed that the converted Gentiles would have to bear &quot;no greater burden than these necessary things: You must abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things&quot;.

While the majority of Christians agree that the dietary restrictions of the Old Testament were lifted with Christ&#x27;s New Covenant, a view known as supersessionism, there are Torah Observant Christians who believe that they should still be observed.

Some, like the Seventh-day Adventists, argue that the liberal view would imply the acceptance even of alcohol, tobacco, rats and roaches as &quot;clean food&quot;; and that God never declares something an abomination and then changes his mind.

Supporters of the stricter view have also disputed the interpretation of Peter&#x27;s vision , claiming that God was merely instructing him not to refer to Gentiles as &quot;unclean&quot; since salvation had been extended to them. This is expressly stated by Peter later in the chapter at Acts 10:28 (&quot;but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.&quot;) In Acts 10:14 Peter makes a distinction between &quot;common&quot; (Greek: κοινόν, &quot; koinón&quot;) and &quot;unclean&quot; (Greek: ακάθαρτον, &quot;akátharton&quot;) to which God replies in the next verse &quot;What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common [Greek: κοίνου, &quot;koínou&quot;]&quot;.

One modern example of a Torah-submissive group is the Seventh-day Adventist Church, whose co-founder Ellen G. White was a proponent of vegetarianism. Many Seventh-day Adventists avoid meat for health reasons, although vegetarianism is not a requirement. Members of the United Church of God as well as other Sabbath-keeping Churches also believe in not consuming the meat from unclean animals.

=== Seventh-day Adventist ===

Adventists are known for presenting a &quot;health message&quot; that advocates vegetarianism and expects adherence to the kosher laws, particularly the consumption of kosher foods described in Leviticus 11, meaning abstinence from pork, shellfish, and other animals proscribed as &quot;unclean&quot;.

==== Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches ====
Members of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo churches generally abstain from pork and other unclean meats, however this is merely a cultural practice with no formal canons on the church prohibiting the consumption of unclean meats.

==Islam==

In Islam several animals are considered unclean and their consumption is sinful (&quot;harām&quot;), except in case of necessity; while others are permitted (&quot;halāl&quot;), as long as they are slaughtered in the proper manner and with blessings given to God.

The Quran expressly forbids consumption of &quot;the flesh of swine&quot; There are no other &quot;impure animals&quot; explicitly named in the Qur&#x27;an. If someone converts to Islam, Allah &quot;allows them as lawful what is good and prohibits them from what is bad; he releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that were upon them&quot;.

For other animals, great importance is given to the manner of its death: forbidden are blood and carrion (&quot;dead meat&quot;), and any animal that has been &quot;killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored to death&quot;. Also forbidden is any animal that has been eaten by a wild animal, unless the person is able to slaughter it before it dies.

Finally, the Qur&#x27;an forbids food which has been invoked by a name other than Allah, which has been sacrificed on stone altars, or has been subjected to the pagan practice of raffling with arrows. Food slaughtered by an idolater is forbidden, but food that is acceptable to Jews and Christians is allowed to Muslims as well.

===Dogs===
According to the majority of Sunni scholars, dogs can be owned by farmers, hunters, and shepherds for the purpose of hunting and guarding and the Qur&#x27;an states that it is permissible to eat what trained dogs catch. Among the Bedouin, the saluki dogs are cherished as companions and allowed in the tents.

<text>Ion Vianu (15 April 1934 – 20 June 2024) was a Romanian writer and psychiatrist, who lived in Switzerland from 1977. He was the son of literary critic Tudor Vianu and his wife, Elena.

Vianu first studied classical philology for two years (1952–1954) as a kind of &quot;self-imposed exile into another world&quot;, as he called it, before studying medicine.

==Dissident==
Ion Vianu was one of those who signed Paul Goma&#x27;s 1977 open letter that expressed solidarity with the Charter 77 movement in Czechoslovakia. This was done, partly, to put the Romanian communist authorities under pressure to allow him to emigrate. As a result, he was interrogated by the Romanian&#x27;s secret police, the Securitate, harassed, fired from his University job, and eventually allowed to emigrate to Switzerland. After settling down in Switzerland, he joined the &quot;Geneva Initiative Against Political Psychiatry&quot; and collaborated with Radio Free Europe, discussing attempts to use psychiatry as a form of repression.

After the 1989 Revolution, he became actively involved in the reform of the system of psychiatric treatment in Romania to bring it up to world standards. Vianu, together with his friend Matei Călinescu, published an autobiographical volume, &quot;Amintiri în dialog&quot; (&quot;Remembrances in Dialogue&quot;). He died on 20 June 2024, at the age of 90.

==Writings==
Ion Vianu&#x27;s writings include memoires, novels and critical essays.

He published the novels &quot;Caietele lui Ozias&quot; (in 2004) and &quot;Vasiliu, foi volante&quot; (in 2006), both being part of the cycle &quot;Arhiva trădarii şi a mâniei&quot; (the Archive of Treason and Wrath), dealing with Romanian society during the communist regime . (2nd edition, completed and reviewed, 2016) He also published another two novels, &quot;Paramnezii&quot; (2005) and, in 2007, &quot;Necredinciosul&quot; (the Unfaithful), inspired by his practice as a psychiatrist in the Western world. In 2009 he published &quot;Exercitii de sinceritate&quot; (Exercises in sincerity) about his public life under the communist regime during the seventies. In 2010 he published an autobiographical novel, &quot;Amor intellectualis&quot;, dealing with some major figures from his youth and the tragic destiny of the intelligentsia under the communist regime. He also published collected critical essays under the name &quot;Blestem şi binecuvântare&quot; (Curse &amp; Blessing, 2007), and, in 2008, &quot;Investigatii mateine&quot;, a biographical essay about the Romanian writer Matei Caragiale. Another volume of critical essays &quot;Apropieri&quot; (Approaches), was published in 2011.

The novel &quot;Vasiliu, foi volante&quot; was translated in Spanish by Ioana Zlotescu in 2010 under the title &quot;Vasiliu, hojas sueltas&quot; (Aletheia Publishing House).

&quot;Amor intellectualis&quot; was awarded a few prizes, among them &quot;Book of the year 2010&quot; by the &quot;România Literara&quot; magazine.
În 2012 it appeared in Spanish, translated by Victor Ivanovici and Susanna Vásquez (Miguel Gomez ediciones, Malaga).

<text>Hawarden Old Castle () is a Grade I listed medieval castle near Hawarden, Flintshire, Wales.

The castle&#x27;s origins are indeterminate and the oldest fortifications on this site may date back to the Iron Age, later being used as a Norman Motte-and-bailey castle which was reportedly destroyed and replaced in a short period during the 13th century.

The castle played an important role during the Welsh struggle for independence in the 13th century. At Easter 1282, Dafydd ap Gruffudd attacked and captured Hawarden Castle, thereby starting the final Welsh conflict with Norman England, in the course of which Welsh independence was lost. King Edward I&#x27;s sense of outrage was such that he designed a punishment for Dafydd harsher than any previous form of capital punishment; Dafydd was hanged, drawn, and quartered in Shrewsbury in October 1283. 

A sense at the wider outrage caused by Dafydd&#x27;s attack being made at Easter can be read in the account of the Chronicle of Lanercost;

&quot;...the Welsh nation, unable to pass their lives in peace, broke over their borders on Palm Sunday, carrying fire and sword among the people engaged in procession, and even laid siege [to some places – probably referring to Flint and Rhuddlan]; whose Prince Llywelyn, deceived (more&#x27;s the pity) by the advice of his brother David, fiercely attacked his lord the King; as we read written about Christ, &#x27;him whom I loved most hath set himself against me.&#x27;&quot;

In 1294 the castle was captured during the revolt of Madog ap Llywelyn.

After the English Civil War in the 17th century the castle was slighted on the orders of Oliver Cromwell. Its ruins are on the New Hawarden Castle estate and are open to the public on some Sundays, typically the second and fourth Sundays in summertime. The castle was Grade I listed on 2 July 1967. It is also a scheduled monument.

<text>Jeff Sagarin (born 1948) is an American sports statistician known for his development of a method for ranking and rating sports teams in a variety of sports. His Sagarin Ratings have been a regular feature in the &quot;USA Today&quot; sports section from 1985 to 2023, have been used by the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee to help determine the participants in the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship tournament since 1984, and were part of the college football Bowl Championship Series throughout its history from 1998 to 2014.

==Background==
Sagarin attended New Rochelle High School, earned a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1970 and an M.B.A. from Indiana University School of Business in 1983. He grew up outside New York City in Westchester County in New Rochelle, New York. In 1977 he moved to Bloomington, Indiana. In 1986 he created the computer game &quot;Hoops&quot; with Wayne L. Winston.

==Method==
Sagarin, like the developers of many other sports rating systems, does not divulge the exact methods behind his system. He offers two rating systems, each of which gives each team a certain number of points. One system, &quot;Elo chess,&quot; is presumably based on the Elo rating system used internationally to rank chess players. This system uses only wins and losses with no reference to the victory margin. The other system, &quot;Predictor,&quot; takes victory margin into account. For that system the difference in two teams&#x27; rating scores is meant to predict the margin of victory for the stronger team at a neutral venue. For both systems teams gain higher ratings within the Sagarin system by winning games against stronger opponents, factoring in such things as home-venue advantage. For the Predictor system, margin of victory (or defeat) factors in also, but a law of diminishing returns is applied. Therefore, a football team that wins a game by a margin of 7–6 is rewarded less than a team that defeats the same opponent under the same circumstances 21–7, but a team that wins a game by a margin of 35–0 receives similar ratings to a team that defeats the same opponent 70–0. This characteristic has the effect of recognizing &quot;comfortable&quot; victories, while limiting the reward for running up the score.

At the beginning of a season, when only a few games have been played, a Bayesian network weighted by starting rankings is used as long as there are whole groups of teams that have not played one another, but once the graph is well-connected, the weights are no longer needed. Sagarin claims that from that point, the rankings are unbiased.

==Justification==
Sagarin&#x27;s ratings are particularly relevant in the world of American college football and basketball, where, with hundreds of teams in NCAA Division I competition, there is no way a team can play against more than a small fraction of its competitors. Therefore, in determining the participants in championship games and tournaments, it is necessary to distinguish between teams that have compiled impressive win–loss records against strong competition and teams that have defeated weaker opponents.

In addition, sports rating systems are generally of great interest to gamblers. Gamblers use Sagarin&#x27;s ratings as a source of &quot;Power Ratings,&quot; traditionally used as a way to determine the spread between two teams.

==Winval==
Along with his former MIT classmate Wayne L. Winston, a professor of decision sciences at Indiana University, , Sagarin advised the Dallas Mavericks about which lineups to use during games and which free agents to sign using a system called Winval. Winval is modeled after hockey&#x27;s plus–minus system.

<text>19-Norandrosterone, also known as 5α-estran-3α-ol-17-one, is a metabolite of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) and bolandione (19-norandrostenedione) that is formed by 5α-reductase. It is on the list of substances prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency since it is a detectable metabolite of nandrolone, an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS). Consumption of androstendione products contaminated with traces of bolandione may also result in testing positive for nandrolone.

Traces of 19-norandrosterone may be naturally present in human urine. An experiment conducted on athletes showed that after a prolonged intense effort, the 19-norandrosterone concentration can be increased by a factor varying between 2 and 4, but another study failed to replicate the result. Concentration also increases in the urine of female athletes during menstruation. The consumption of edible parts of a non-castrated pig, containing 19-nortestosterone, has been shown to result in the excretion of 19-norandrosterone in the following hours, so athletes should prudently avoid meals composed of pig offal in the hours preceding doping tests. Consumption of boar meat, liver, kidneys and heart also increased 19-norandrosterone output.

<doc id="938935" wikidata="Q1630803" url="?curid=938935" title="Hotel (American TV series)">
<text>Hotel is an American primetime soap opera series that aired on ABC from September 21, 1983, to May 5, 1988, in the timeslot following &quot;Dynasty&quot;.

Based on Arthur Hailey&#x27;s 1965 novel of the same name (which had also inspired a 1967 feature film), the series was produced by Aaron Spelling and set in the elegant and fictitious St. Gregory Hotel in San Francisco (changed from the New Orleans setting of the novel and film). Establishing shots of the hotel were filmed in front of the Fairmont San Francisco atop the Nob Hill neighborhood. Episodes followed the activities of passing guests, as well as the personal and professional lives of the hotel staff.

The distribution rights to the series were originally owned by Warner Bros. Television Distribution, until 2006 when CBS Paramount Network Television bought the television libraries and properties of Spelling Entertainment Inc. from Paramount Pictures Domestic Distribution and Viacom Enterprises.

==Premise==
Rich aristocrat Victoria Cabot (Anne Baxter) runs the St. Gregory Hotel, assisted by general manager Peter McDermott (James Brolin) and his staff. McDermott and assistant general manager Christine Francis (Connie Sellecca) became romantically involved. Halfway through the series Cabot died, leaving McDermott her share of the St. Gregory Hotel. When McDermott inherited half of the St. Gregory, he ran the hotel and promoted Francis to general manager.

Other staff members included: the guest relations director Mark Danning (Shea Farrell); ex-conman now head of hotel security, Billy Griffin (Nathan Cook); reception manager Julie Gillette (Shari Belafonte); young couple Dave and Megan Kendall (real life spouses Michael Spound and Heidi Bohay), a bellhop and a desk clerk, respectively; and Harry the bartender (Harry George Phillips). Characters Eric Lloyd (Ty Miller); Cheryl Dolan (Valerie Landsburg) and Ryan Thomas (Susan Walters) were added to the cast during its final season.

Cast members Brolin, Sellecca, Belafonte and Cook appeared in every episode of the series. In later years, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., made numerous guest appearances as an opponent of Victoria Cabot and Peter McDermott who plants his daughter, played by Michelle Phillips, in the hotel staff as the concierge.

Bette Davis appeared in the pilot episode as hotel owner Laura Trent, and publicity for the series indicated that Davis was to be a regular on the program. However, the onset of ill health forced Davis to withdraw from the series and Anne Baxter, who had played her nemesis in the 1950 film &quot;All About Eve&quot;, was brought in as Victoria Cabot, Mrs. Trent&#x27;s sister-in-law. When Davis&#x27; health improved it was intended to bring her back; however, with Baxter on board fulfilling the series matriarchal role it was decided to make Davis&#x27; character an offscreen character, who though mentioned, was never seen. Ironically, Davis would outlive Baxter by four years and the series itself by over a year.

Similar to Spelling&#x27;s other ABC show, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, episodes of &quot;Hotel&quot; relied heavily on the appearance of recognizable guest stars. However, unlike &quot;The Love Boat&#x27;s&quot; comedic story lines, &quot;Hotel&quot; generally broached more serious and controversial subject matter, such as abortion, infidelity, rape, suicide, AIDS, homophobia, spousal abuse and child molestation.

===Season 2 (1984–85)===

===Season 3 (1985–86)===

===Season 4 (1986–87)===

== Soundtrack ==
The theme music used for the opening titles was composed by Henry Mancini, who composed famous songs such as &quot;Moon River&quot;, &quot;Charade&quot; and &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;.

==Home media==
On July 21, 2009, Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS DVD released Season 1 of &quot;Arthur Hailey&#x27;s Hotel&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The episodes are uncut, with most of them clocking in at over 48 minutes, and some coming in at just a shade under that.

On October 20, 2015, Visual Entertainment released &quot;Hotel – The Complete Collection&quot; on DVD in Region 1 for the first time in a 29-disc box set.

On December 6, 2016, VEI re-released the complete series in a condensed, 20-disc edition. The discs were all compiled in a single, jumbo DVD case (the original complete series edition was released with each individual season contained in five individual DVD cases). The box claims the discs to be Region 1 protected but Seasons 1, 2 and 3 are actually region-free.

==Remake==

In 2003, Aaron Spelling tried to remake the show, twenty years after the original&#x27;s premiere. The pilot, which starred Michael Jai White and Christina Vidal, was shot for UPN, which passed on the show.

<text>Felipe Ortiz Rose (born January 12, 1954) is an American musician who was an original member of the disco group the Village People. While in the group, he performed as &quot;The Indian&quot;, usually wearing a costume consisting of an imitation, &quot;bespangled war bonnet&quot;, loincloth, and theatrical face paint. Rose was a member of the group from 1977 until 2017, when the name of the group was turned over to the original lead singer, Victor Willis. Rose subsequently launched a solo career and released the single &quot;Going Back to My Roots&quot; in 2018.

==Early years==
Felipe Ortiz Rose was born in Manhattan. His father, reportedly of Lakota descent, moved to New York for work as a welder, where he met Rose&#x27;s Puerto Rican mother. Rose has said his father was Mescalero Apache, Lakota, and Cherokee. He was raised in Brooklyn, where he displayed an interest in the arts during his childhood, and first dressed as &quot;an Indian&quot; while in school for &quot;the Christopher Columbus parade and celebration.&quot;

After graduating from high school in 1972, he moved to Greenwich Village where he stayed with a succession of friends and acquaintances. He also spent time in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he performed his &quot;Indian&quot; character in the Arthur Blake bicentennial revue.

He cites his mother was his main inspiration as she had been a dancer for the Copacabana during the 1940s and 1950s.

==Village People==
In the early 1970s, Rose was working as a nightclub dancer. He describes being encouraged by an aunt to begin dancing in what he says was &quot;his father&#x27;s tribal regalia,&quot; which he says led to his costume, acting and neon facepaint in the Village People. &quot;His aunt, he has said, inspired him to work the Indian angle into his showbiz ambitions: &#x27;Why not honor your father&#x27;s heritage,&#x27; Rose has recalled her saying, &#x27;and dress in your tribal regalia in your dance journey through culture?&#x27;&quot;

Rose was working as a dancer and a bartender in the New York gay club, The Anvil, dressed &quot;as an Indian&quot; when he was discovered by French producer Jacques Morali and executive producer Henri Belolo and so became the first recruit for Village People.

In 1977, Village People had their first hit with &quot;San Francisco&quot;, although this song became a hit only in the United Kingdom. Then in 1978 they had their first hits in the U.S. with &quot;Macho Man&quot; followed by &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot;.

He was a member of the band&#x27;s board of directors, called Sixuvus Ltd (&quot;six of us&quot; - named for the six members of the Village People).

==Solo career==
From 2000 to 2008, while still part of Village People, Felipe wrote and recorded &quot;Trail of Tears,&quot; &quot;We&#x27;re Still Here,&quot; &quot;Red Hawk Woman&quot; and &quot;Going Back to My Roots.&quot;

His single &quot;Trails of Tears&quot; won a NAMMY (Native American Music Awards) for Best Historical Recording. In 2002, Rose was the opening act of the fifth Annual Native American Music Awards celebrated at the Marcus Amphitheatre in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His media company was the &quot;Tomahawk Group&quot;.

Rose has appeared in the movies &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; (1980), &quot;The Best of Village People&quot; (1993), and &quot;Feathers and Leathers: The Story of the Village People&quot; (1999). He also participated in the 2000 documentary, &quot;Village People: The E! True Hollywood Story&quot;.

In 2008, Rose received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was inducted into the Native American Music Hall of Fame a month later.

His 2018 single, &quot;Going Back to My Roots,&quot; begins with a Lakota prayer and includes a rap by Native American hip-hop artist Sten Joddi. He first performed the song during a tribute show of the 40th anniversary of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;.

By 2014, he had become an ordained minister along with Eric the Biker, to gain the ability to marry fans. When asked if this was used for gay marriages, Rose claimed he once spontaneously married a gay couple while aboard a ship in Australia.

==Personal life==
After his mother&#x27;s death, Rose moved to Richmond, Virginia. He briefly lived in Jersey City, New Jersey, though he found it to be too crowded.

In a 2008 interview, he stated that approximately four or five years prior, he moved to Asbury Park, New Jersey, on the advice of several friends who lived there, saying, &quot;So I came down and I just fell in love with the shore... I love the diversity of Asbury because it brings everyone together. There is a very large gay and lesbian community here, but the diversity of artists is amazing; it&#x27;s become very bohemian.&quot;

Rose is also a hobbyist cook, making dishes inspired by his Puerto Rican heritage. He says his mother was not a cook, preferring to prepare &quot;five cans of Chef Boyardee and a loaf of bread&quot;, leading Rose to learn to cook at a young age. He pitched a cooking show to ABC, with the idea of preparing meals at various celebrities&#x27; houses. He then revamped the show idea with the late Chef Lou Petrozza, a Hell&#x27;s Kitchen runner-up, but ABC declined unless the other Village People members were present. As of 2021, he continues to cook on his YouTube channel.

<text>Tudor Vianu (; January 8, 1898 – May 21, 1964) was a Romanian literary critic, art critic, poet, philosopher, academic, and translator. He had a major role on the reception and development of Modernism in Romanian literature and art. He was married to Elena Vianu, herself a literary critic, and was the father of Ion Vianu, a psychiatrist, writer and essayist.

==Biography==
Born in Giurgiu to a Jewish family converted to Christianity , he completed his primary education in the city, at the Ion Maiorescu Gymnasium, followed by the Gheorghe Lazăr High School in Bucharest. Around 1910, he began writing poetry — which he never published.

In 1915, Vianu became a student at the Department of Philosophy and Law at the University of Bucharest. During the period, Vianu began attending Alexandru Macedonski&#x27;s Symbolist literary circle, and, in 1916, he published a study on Macedonski and later his own verses in &quot;Flacăra&quot; magazine.

Upon Romania&#x27;s entry in World War I, he was drafted into the Romanian Army, trained as an artillery cadet in Botoşani, and took part in the Moldavian campaign. In 1918, he returned to Bucharest, where he was editor of Macedonski&#x27;s &quot;Literatorul&quot;, and resumed his studies, graduating in 1919. Vianu also worked on the editorial staff for Constantin Rădulescu-Motru&#x27;s &quot;Ideea Europeană&quot; and for &quot;Luceafărul&quot;. In 1921, he began his long collaboration with &quot;Viaţa Românească&quot;, while he contributed to Eugen Lovinescu&#x27;s &quot;Sburătorul&quot;.

In 1923, he obtained a doctorate in Philosophy at the University of Tübingen, with the thesis &quot;Das Wertungsproblem in Schillers Poetik&quot; (&quot;The Judgment of Values in Schiller&#x27;s Poetics&quot;), his first major study in aesthetics (delivered in November 1923). The work was praised by Lucian Blaga, who was subsequently Vianu&#x27;s colleague during their time as staff members for &quot;Gândirea&quot;; the two shared an appreciation of Expressionism. With Blaga, he stood for &quot;Gândirea&quot;&#x27;s early modernist tendencies, and grew opposed to Nichifor Crainic&#x27;s intense advocacy of traditionalism (at a time when the magazine&#x27;s editor, Cezar Petrescu, was occupying a middle position).

With the publishing of his &quot;Dualismul artei&quot; in 1925 (followed by a long succession of collections of essays and studies), Vianu secured his place in the cultural landscape of modern Romania, and became the titular professor of aesthetics at the University of Bucharest. At around the same period, he distanced himself from &quot;Gândirea&quot; (which was becoming the mouthpiece of Crainic&#x27;s far right traditionalism), and instead advocated democratic government.

Throughout the interwar period, Vianu was an adversary of the fascist Iron Guard, and polemized with its press, becoming the target of attacks serialized in &quot;Cuvântul&quot;. His status as a professor was in peril during the National Legionary State established by the Guard in 1940, and he felt the imminent danger of physical assaults. Anti-Semitic authorities began alluding to his Jewish origins, and several violent remarks were aimed at him. Following the Legionary Rebellion and the Guard&#x27;s defeat, he sent a congratulatory telegram to the &quot;Conducător&quot; (lit. &#x27;Leader&#x27;, the equivalent title to &#x27;il Duce&#x27; and &#x27;der Führer&#x27;) Ion Antonescu. In 1945, after the end of Antonescu&#x27;s regime and World War II, he was the recipient of a letter from his friend Eugène Ionesco: the document forms a list of intellectuals whom Ionesco harshly criticized for their pro-Iron Guard activism (they include Nae Ionescu, Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran, Constantin Noica, Dan Botta, Mircea Vulcănescu, Horia Stamatu, Paul Sterian, Mihail Polihroniade, Haig Acterian, Dumitru Cristian Amzăr, Costin Deleanu and Paul Deleanu).

In charge of Romania&#x27;s National Theater in 1945, ambassador to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946, Vianu became an honorary member of the Romanian Academy starting in 1955. He made several concessions to the new Communist authorities, which Ion Vianu has described as &quot;purely formal&quot; (an assessment shared by Ion Papuc, who argued that Vianu joined the Romanian Communist Party &quot;for lack of a way out&quot;). He gave active support to literary figures who, as former members of the Iron Guard, faced imprisonment — Vianu was a defense witness in the trial of Traian Herseni, and, with Mihai Ralea, the author of an appeal for the release of Petre Ţuţea.

During his late years, he translated several of William Shakespeare&#x27;s works into Romanian. In the beginning of summer 1964, he completed &quot;Arghezi, poet al omului&quot; (&quot;Arghezi, Poet of Mankind&quot;), carrying the subtitle &quot;Cântare omului&quot; (&quot;A Chant to Mankind&quot;), a work in the field of comparative literature. It began printing on the very day of its author&#x27;s death, which was due to a heart attack.

==Philosophy==
Vianu&#x27;s investigations into cultural history, coupled with his vivid interest in the sociology of culture, allowed him to develop an influential philosophy, which attributed culture a seminal role in shaping human destiny. According to his views, culture, which had liberated humans from natural imperatives, was an asset that intellectuals were required to preserve by intervening in social life.

In his analysis of the Age of Enlightenment and 19th-century philosophy, Vianu celebrated Hegel for having unified the competing trends of universalist Rationalism and ethnocentric Historicism. A sizable part of his analysis was focused on the modern crisis of values, which he attributed to the inability of values to impose themselves on all individuals, and which he evidenced in the ideas of philosophers as diverse as Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, and Søren Kierkegaard.

<doc id="938951" wikidata="Q1247355" url="?curid=938951" title="Profiler (TV series)">
<text>Profiler is an American crime drama created by Cynthia Saunders that aired on NBC from September 21, 1996, to July 1, 2000. The series follows the exploits of a criminal profiler working with the fictional FBI Violent Crimes Task Force (VCTF) based in Atlanta, Georgia.

The show initially starred Ally Walker as profiler Dr. Samantha Waters, the victim of a stalker known as &quot;Jack of All Trades&quot;. At the end of the third season, Walker departed the series and was replaced by Jamie Luner as prosecutor-turned-profiler Dr. Rachel Burke during the show&#x27;s final season. Robert Davi, Roma Maffia, Peter Frechette, and Julian McMahon co-starred for all four seasons. Caitlin Wachs and Erica Gimpel also co-starred for the first two seasons; Wachs was replaced by Evan Rachel Wood in a recurring role for the third season, while Gimpel appeared as a guest star.

Along with &quot;The Pretender&quot;, &quot;Profiler&quot; was a staple of NBC&#x27;s Saturday night lineup during the late 1990s. The series shared a similar lead character and premise with the Fox series &quot;Millennium&quot;, which also premiered at the beginning of the 1996–97 television season.

==Plot==
===Seasons 1–3===
Dr. Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Waters (Ally Walker) is a forensic psychologist working for the FBI&#x27;s (fictitious) Violent Crimes Task Force (&quot;VCTF&quot;), based in Atlanta, Georgia. She is a criminal profiler with her own unique gift to &quot;see&quot; through the eyes of others. This gift gives Sam an added special insight into the workings of the criminal mind.

Sam performs all of her duties diligently and competently, her drive coming from experiencing both a professional and personal tragedy years earlier in which her husband was murdered by a serial killer known only as &quot;Jack of All Trades.&quot; Due to Jack&#x27;s dangerous and pathological nature, Sam must live under 24/7 police guard in a former firefighter station with her seven-year-old daughter Chloe (Caitlin Wachs, later Evan Rachel Wood); and her best friend, artist Angel Brown (Erica Gimpel).

After helping her mentor Bailey Malone (Robert Davi) on a difficult case, Sam comes out of retirement and reclusiveness to join the FBI Violent Crimes Task Force. Also on the team are detectives John Grant (Julian McMahon) and Nathan Brubaker (Michael Whaley), computer hacker George Fraley (Peter Frechette), forensic pathologist Grace Álvarez (Roma Maffia).

In season two, Brubaker leaves the VCTF and is replaced by Marcus Payton (Shiek Mahmoud-Bey), who creates tension on the team due to his skepticism of Sam&#x27;s methods. Jack also recruits violent ex-felon Sharon Lesher (Traci Lords) to become his partner-in-crime &quot;Jill of All Trades.&quot; Bailey is also faced with the rebellious behavior of his daughter Frances (Heather McComb) after she becomes involved in criminal activity.

In season three, all three of the new characters were dropped while Chloe was downgraded to a recurring character. With &quot;Jack&quot; seemingly being captured as a childhood schoolmate of Sam named Donald Lucas (Mark Rolston), the series began to focus more on VCTF cases and Sam&#x27;s attempts to reintegrate back into society. Sam and Chloe move into an upscale house in the Atlanta suburbs, while Sam also begins to reconnect with her estranged father Walter Anderson (Lawrence Pressman) and pursue a relationship with prosecutor Paul Sterling (John Mese). Bailey also reconciles with his ex-wife Janet (Patricia Healy).

===Season 4===
It is discovered at the end of season three that Lucas is not the real &quot;Jack&quot;; he was instead framed by violent sociopath Albert Newquay (Dennis Christopher). To mislead and tease the viewers, Albert Newquay, the real Jack&#x27;s true name, was first mentioned in season two when he took refuge at the Maryland home of his wealthy mother Miriam (Louise Fletcher) to recover after being shot by Sam. Newquay then appeared on-camera for the first time in season three posing in disguise as Ed Post, the seemingly buffoonish sheriff of a sinister fictional small northern California town.

At the start of season four, Sam is kidnapped by Newquay. Bailey calls in for assistance from profiler Rachel Burke (Jamie Luner), a former FBI instructor at Quantico who also had Waters&#x27; skill of profiling. After being freed, Sam departs VCTF and Burke joins the team.

Burke initially alienates the team members due to her brusque take-charge manner that is unlike Sam. She and John Grant, who had met her previously, in particular clash due to a disagreement on whether they had actually engaged in intercourse during a liquor-filled nightcap. Rachel struggles to help her self-destructive younger brother Danny (Raphael Sbarge); Grace faces dealing with her second pregnancy after her husband leaves her; and George develops an addiction to painkillers after being injured in a minor car accident.

Rachel soon receives a stalker of her own with the shadowy urban legend named Damian Kennasas. Unstable FBI agent Joel Marks (Gregory Itzin) is initially presented as the main suspect. However, the season ends with a cliffhanger as Rachel is framed for Joel&#x27;s murder by the real Damian. The VCTF also faces disbandment from U.S. Congress over its high budget. The cancellation of the series resulted in these cliffhangers never being answered.

<text>The druid is a playable character class in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game. Druids wield nature-themed magic. Druids cast spells like clerics, but unlike them do not have special powers against undead and, in some editions, cannot use metal armor. Druids have a unique ability that allows them to change into various animal forms, and various other qualities that assist them in natural settings.

==Publication history==

===Creative origins===
The druid is named for the pre-Christian Celtic priests called druids. In the book &quot;The Evolution of Fantasy Role-Playing Games&quot; (2014), Michael Tresca highlighted that &quot;historically, druids did revere trees as nature spirits. [...] Zoomorphism was common enough to justify druids transforming into all kinds of animals. [...] Conspicuously lacking from Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the role of sacrifices in druidic rituals&quot;.

===Original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;===
Druids appeared, but not as player characters, in the original &quot;Greyhawk&quot; supplement from 1975. They were presented as a player character class in the &quot;Eldritch Wizardry&quot; supplement in 1976.

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 1st edition===
The druid was one of the standard character classes available in the original &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, and appeared as a sub-class of cleric. The druid was one of five subclasses presented in the original &quot;Players Handbook&quot;. Originally, druids were very limited in their choice of weapons and armor (not able to wear any metal armor, and only permitted a few weapons, though that did include the scimitar and crossbow), and were of True Neutral alignment, but were able to cast spells more times per day than the magic-user and at a faster speed than clerics; they also had access to both healing and attack spells (albeit at different levels). Essentially, they were in many ways in between the cleric and the magic-user in function and use, with different special abilities. There were also a set of societal rules governing druidic life as well as higher-level abilities. In order to reach some of the higher levels, players had to defeat a higher-level druid in combat; after accomplishing this, they earned different titles (such as Archdruid) and gained lower-level druids as followers. The later-published accessory &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; featured several higher-level abilities for druids, including the ability to summon various elementals and para-elementals, the ability to enter and survive in various planes (such as the elemental planes and the Plane of Shadow), and so on.

===Basic &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;===
The druid was available as a character class in the game&#x27;s &quot;Basic&quot; edition, introduced in the &quot;Companion Set&quot;. Druids were clerics who adhered to a special code of conduct, maintaining a Neutral alignment; in exchange they gained some special powers and additional spells.

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition===
According to the second edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, the druid class is only loosely patterned after the historical druids of Europe during the days of the Roman Empire and acted as advisors to chieftains with great influence over the tribesmen.

In 2nd edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, druids were presented as an example of a &#x27;specialty priest&#x27;, also known as a priest of a specific mythos, differentiated by spells and powers and ethos. The 2nd Ed AD&amp;D druid was more similar to the cleric in terms of spellcasting (druids now learned spells at the same rate and level as clerics, as long as the spells were available to them; casting times were also the same). Certain higher level abilities as introduced in Unearthed Arcana were also removed (or ignored), such as the ability to enter the Plane of Shadow. &quot;The Complete Druid&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, published in 1994, provided more details on the druid class, including druidic society, magic groves, class kits and herbal lore.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition===
Druid is one of the base character classes presented in the 3rd edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2000). In the 3.5 edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Druids are free to use different forms of weaponry, but they lose the ability to cast spells or change into animal form for a day if they wear metal armor. The alignment restriction now requires that druids remain neutral on at least one (but not necessarily both) alignment axis (Good vs. Evil and Law vs. Chaos). i.e., they are restricted to Chaotic Neutral, Lawful Neutral, Neutral Good, Neutral Evil, or True Neutral, to reflect belief in the balance and amoral, impartial character of the natural world. Druids have also gained the ability to have a special animal companion; other abilities have been added or modified as well. For example, they can spontaneously convert a prepared spell in order to summon an animal that will serve as a temporary but loyal ally.

In the 3rd edition Player&#x27;s Handbook, Druids were limited to a single animal shape. In the 3.5 edition, Druids are allowed significantly more freedom so that an appropriate animal shape can be chosen to match the circumstances. At higher levels Druids can even change into elementals. Animal companions are more clearly defined in the 3.5 edition as well.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition===
The Druid was introduced to Fourth Edition with Player&#x27;s Handbook 2. The newest incarnation of the class has the Primal power source and the Controller role. They are proficient in simple weapons and light armor, use staves and totems as implements, generally use Wisdom for power attack and damage rolls and, like all primal classes, their powers are called evocations.

Unlike most classes, druids know a third at-will attack power, however they must have at least one and at most two at-will attack powers with the &quot;Beast Form&quot; keyword. Each of the two Druid builds presented in the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook 2&quot; emphasizes one of the class&#x27;s two secondary roles. Guardian druids lean towards the Leader role, focus on Constitution and ranged evocations, and take the &quot;Primal Guardian&quot; class feature, which allows them to use their Constitution bonus in place of their Dexterity or Intelligence bonus when determining AC while wearing light armour, as well as giving some druid evocations additional effects, many of which are based on Constitution. Predator druids lean towards the Striker role, focus on Dexterity and melee and short range evocations, and take the &quot;Primal Predator&quot; class feature, which makes them more mobile while wearing light armor, as well as giving some druid evocations additional effects, many of which are based on Dexterity.

All druids also have &quot;Wild Shape&quot;, an at-will power which allows them to switch between their natural and beast forms. While in beast form, they cannot use weapons, and cannot use weapon or implement attack powers without the &quot;Beast Form&quot; keyword. Like clerics and wizards, druids gain Ritual Caster as a bonus feat.

====&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Essentials====
The &quot;Essentials&quot; rulebook &quot;Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms&quot; presented an alternate core version of the Druid, known as the Sentinel.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition===
The druid is included as a character class in the 5th edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2014); druids utilize divine magic in this edition. Druid spells are typically devoted to communing with nature, interpreting or directing the weather, communicating with creatures and plants, and the like. The druid shares some spells with the cleric, such as some healing spells, and has a number of offensive spells which use the power of nature—calling down lightning storms, for example, or summoning wild animals to fight. They also gain special powers such as the shapeshifting ability &quot;Wild Shape&quot;; but these are not mechanically considered spells.

Included in the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; are two Druid subclasses: the Circle of the Land and the Circle of the Moon. Several sourcebooks published since the launch of 5th edition have expanded the number of Druid Circle options. &quot;Xanathar&#x27;s Guide to Everything&quot; (2017) added the Circle of Dreams and the Circle of the Shepherd. &quot;Guildmasters&#x27; Guide to Ravnica&quot; (2018) added the Circle of Spores, which was then reprinted in &quot;Tasha&#x27;s Cauldron of Everything&quot; (2020) along with two new options: Circle of Stars and Circle of Wildfire. All subclasses offer additional features for the druid. In addition to those features, some druid circles offer an expanded spell list, which may include spells not typically available to druids, and augmented or alternate uses for their &quot;Wild Shape&quot; ability.

==Campaign settings==

===Dark Sun===
Druids are bound to the essence of a particular oasis or other geographic location.

== Reception ==
In the book &quot;The Evolution of Fantasy Role-Playing Games&quot; (2014), Tresca compared the class to the Celtic druids the class was inspired by: &quot;Druids could be classified as neutral alignment, in that druids were on both sides of morality. Celtic stories are filled with accounts of druids on both sides, undoing each other&#x27;s spells, and batting in fantastic magical combats that would make any role-player envious. But the alignment of druids as being true neutral was simply not accurate; druids were just as passionate about one ethos as anybody else&quot;.

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; rated the druid class as the 10th most powerful class of the base 12 character classes in the 5th edition.

Gus Wezerek, for &quot;FiveThirtyEight,&quot; reported that of the 5th edition &quot;class and race combinations per 100,000 characters that players created on D&amp;D Beyond from&quot; August 15 to September 15, 2017, druids were the least created at 6,328 total. Elf (1,779) was the most common racial combination followed by human (996) and then genasi (584).

<text>Labidochromis caeruleus is a species of cichlid endemic to the central western coastal region of Lake Malawi in East Africa. It is also known as lemon yellow lab, the blue streak hap, the [[Electric yellow cichlid|electric yellow]] or yellow prince, depending on the colour morph. A naturally occurring yellow-coloured variant from Lion&#x27;s Cove is one of the most popular cichlids amongst aquarium hobbyists.

Electric yellows inhabit water with a pH between 7.8 and 8.9 and an ideal temperature range of 23–26 °C (73.4–78.8 °F). Large males may reach in length.

==Reproduction==
This species, like the &quot;Astatotilapia burtoni&quot;, is a maternal mouthbrooder, meaning the eggs are carried, hatch, and develop in the mother&#x27;s mouth (buccal cavity), for about three weeks. These fish are ovophiles and the male will excavate a pit in the sand within his territory, in which the female lays the eggs; the female then takes these eggs into her mouth for fertilization.

==Aquarium care==
Electric yellows are peaceful compared to most other African cichlids. Despite this, like all cichlids from Lake Malawi, they are best kept in specialist cichlid aquariums with other Mbuna. As with most cichlids, electric yellows should not be kept with freshwater community aquarium species such as Zebra Danios or Neon Tetras, they may nip the finnage of other peaceful species, and are not recommended for freshwater community aquariums because of the differences in the natural habitats between African Lake cichlids and other fish species. This fish is more suited to an African lake cichlid community consisting of other Malawi species. In an aquarium setting, their natural habitat of rocks and caves should be emulated with a sandy substrate. Their diet should consist mostly of prepared cichlid pellets or flakes, supplemented with foods like krill, bloodworms, brineshrimp, and Spirulina flakes. Refrain from feeding these cichlids feeder goldfish, as they are likely carrying diseases that will cause harm to your cichlids.

<text>The PZL-Mielec M-18 &quot;Dromader&quot; (English: &quot;Dromedary&quot;) is a single engine agricultural aircraft that is manufactured by PZL-Mielec in Poland. The aircraft is used mainly as a cropduster or firefighting machine.

==Development==
PZL-Mielec, then known as WSK-Mielec, began to design the Dromader in the mid 1970s, with help of United States aircraft manufacturer Rockwell International. PZL-Mielec asked for Rockwell&#x27;s help because of the political situation at the time: operating in an Eastern Bloc country, PZL wanted the aircraft to sell well worldwide, and the company realized that certification by the United States Federal Aviation Administration would be important in reaching that goal. Rockwell on the other hand wanted to fit Polish high-power radial engines into its agricultural planes. As a result of this cooperation the Rockwell Thrush Commander aircraft was fitted with the PZL-3 engine, and the Polish designers created the higher payload M-18 Dromader by introducing the more powerful ASz-62 engine, making structural changes to the airframe, and increasing dimensions. The cooperation led to the Dromader sharing outer wing panels and part of the fuselage with the Thrush Commander.

The first prototype of the aircraft flew on August 27, 1976. In September 1978, the aircraft was given certification to fly in Poland. Certifications from many countries around the world followed soon.

During the 1980s, PZL envisaged a family of related designs based on the M-18, optimised for different capacities. The M-21 Dromader Mini and M-24 Dromader Super flew in prototype form, and a M-25 Dromader Mikro was designed. However, none of these saw production.

Many aircraft of the M-18 type and its variations can still be seen around the world. They were sold to 24 countries, over 200 are used in the US. In 2008, fifteen were sold to China. In 2012, PZL-Mielec was still selling models M-18B and M-18BS, with 759 built in total. , the Dromader was sold by PZL-Mielec, but the production has been halted. The produced aircraft are still refurbished instead, with new engines (produced by WSK &quot;PZL-Kalisz&quot;). There are plans to acquire rights and renew the production in WZL-2 in Bydgoszcz.

==Variants==
;M-18:original one-seat production version, available for special orders only.
;M-18A:two seater available from 1984 onwards. Allows a mechanic or chemical loader to be carried as a passenger to remote fields.
;M-18AS:two-cockpit trainer version
;M-18B:refined version of M-18A with increased capacity, flown in 1993.
;M-18BS:two-cockpit trainer.
;M-18C:version with more powerful 895 kW (1,200 hp) Kalisz K-9 engine. Flown in 1995 but not produced.
;AII AVA-303:The M-18 is being built in Iran as the AVA-303.

==Operators==

===Military===
*Croatian Air Force - Former operator.
*Hellenic Air Force
*Montenegrin Air Force
; - Agricultural Aviation

===Civil===
The Dromader is in service with aerial agriculture and other companies in many countries, operating in a variety of roles. The former Yugoslav Airline, Jugoslovenski Aerotransport, used it for cropspraying. Turkish Aeronautical Association uses it for firefighting.

<text>The electric yellow cichlid is a popular freshwater aquarium fish. It is a naturally occurring variant of &quot;Labidochromis caeruleus&quot; endemic to the central western coastal region of Nkhata Bay in Lake Malawi in East Africa. It is the most popular African cichlid amongst aquarium hobbyists. These fish are mouthbrooders; the female lays her eggs on the surface of rocks and then scoops them into her mouth where they brood for 18 days before being released.

The electric yellow cichlid is set apart from other African cichlids by its striking electric yellow coloration. Mature specimens flaunt contrasting black stripes and vertical bars.
The electric yellow African cichlid is also known colloquially as the yellow lab or electric yellow lab. Considered a newer species and referred to commercially as Labidochromis tanganicae, this cichlid lives in the waters of Lake Malawi between the islands of Charo and Mbowe. First displayed at Burundi in the early 1980s and exported from there, the electric yellow was mistakenly believed to come from Lake Tanganyika.

A peaceful and shy cichlid compared to other African cichlids, the electric yellow still displays distinct social and territorial behaviors. The electric yellow will act aggressively towards fish of similar body shape and color perceived to be competition for food and mates. The aquarium should include a sandy bottom, caves, and rocks.

== In the aquarium ==

* Size: 5+ Inches
* Minimum tank requirements are dependent on a few factors, seeing as Yellow Labs are far more peaceful than one would imagine.
* Breeding: 30 gallon minimum for 1 male and 5 females
* community: 55 gallons
* species only: 1-4 in a 10 gallon; 5-7 in a 20-gallon, 8-10 in a 30-gallon, and 11-15 in a 45.
* These fish prefer open swimming areas as well as many caves.
* The aquarium would optimally include a sandy bottom, robust plants, caves, and rocks.
* The electric yellow cichlid needs both meaty foods and greens such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and quality flake or pellet food containing vegetable matter. Malawi bloat can occur if they are fed too much protein, and they should be fed mostly vegetable matter. They are compatible with most zebra cichlids, yellow tail acei cichlids, rusty cichlids and other African cichlids with a more peaceful less aggressive nature.
* The water needs to be semi-hard so the DH value should range from 18 to 20. The ideal PH value should be between 7 and 8. -Tasin

<text>Zeng Gong (; 1019–1083), courtesy name Zigu (), was a Chinese essayist, historian, poet, politician, and writer of the Song dynasty in China. He was one of the supporters of the New Classical Prose Movement () and is regarded by later scholars as one of the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song ().

Zeng Gong was born in Nanfeng, Jianchang (modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi). He is said to have written &quot;Liulun&quot; 六論 (&quot;Six arguments&quot;) when he was only twelve. After the work was praised by Ouyang Xiu, one of the intellectual leaders of the era, Zeng Gong became widely known among literary circles.

In 1037, at the age of eighteen, he moved to Yushan county (玉山縣, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi) to accompany his father Zeng Yizhan (), who had been appointed magistrate there. Whilst in Yushan, he travelled extensively in its hinterlands and wrote &quot;You Xinzhou Yushan Xiaoyan Ji&quot; (). The work was divided into five sections. The first describes the geography of Yushan, followed by sections on the caves, rocks etc. Zeng&#x27;s youthful descriptions show his vivid imagination and literary talent. In his twenties, Zeng Gong traveled throughout China, befriending the would be reformer Wang Anshi and later recommending him to Ouyang Xiu.

In 1057, Zeng Gong achieved a degree in &quot;jinshi&quot; and was appointed to a military post in the provinces. The next year, he was recalled to the capital and served in the Department of History - collecting and drafting documents. From 1069, he was appointed successively as the head of Qizhou (), Xiangzhou (), Hongzhou, Fuzhou, Mingzhou () and Bozhou.

In 1080, en route to a fresh appointment in Cangzhou, Zeng was granted an audience with Emperor Shenzong. The emperor was suitably impressed and allowed Zeng to stay at the capital to work on a history of the Five Dynasties period. Zeng Gong was promoted to become Aide to the Master of Writings () in 1082. He died the following year in Jiangning. The new monarch Emperor Lizong granted him the posthumous appellation of &quot;Wending&quot; ().

Zeng Gong produced four hundred poems in his lifetime and a number of essays. His style of prose writing is mostly discursive rather than argumentative. In terms of political philosophy, Zeng was a firm follower of Ouyang Xiu. For this reason his reputation as leader of one of the eight great schools of philosophy has largely been overshadowed by that of his mentor. Among Zeng Gong&#x27;s collected works are fifty chapters of &quot;Yuanfeng Leigao&quot; (), forty chapters of the &quot;Xu Yuanfeng Leigao&quot; () and thirty chapters of the &quot;Longping Ji&quot; ().

In May 2016 a letter by Zeng sold for ¥207 million at auction, setting a new record for a Chinese document sold at auction.

<doc id="939029" wikidata="Q1795127" url="?curid=939029" title="Kyogle">
<text>Kyogle () is a town in the Northern Rivers region of northern New South Wales, Australia. It falls within the local government area of Kyogle Council. At the 2016 census, Kyogle had a population of 2,751 people. Kyogle is known as a &quot;gateway&quot; to many national parks including Border Ranges National Park and Toonumbar National Park.

==History==
It was founded in the 1830s as a lumber camp, and is located north of Sydney, north of Casino on the Summerland Way close to the Queensland border. It also lies on the banks of the Richmond River. It is the seat of its own shire. 

The meaning of the name Kyogle is adapted from the Bundjalung word ‘kaiou-gal’ meaning ‘place of the bush turkey” which is a fast long-legged running bird.

The bush turkey, or brush turkey, is a common theme in Kyogle and this is reflected in the construction of the &quot;Big Bush Turkey&quot; and that the Kyogle Rugby League Football Club is known as the Kyogle Turkeys.

=== Flooding ===
In early January 2008, parts of Kyogle were subject to major flooding, when the Richmond River burst its banks after heavy rainfall around Kyogle and upstream, reaching heights of . This was the second worst flood in Kyogle on record, after the flood of 1954. The January 2008 event was approximately a 1 in 50 year event. The State Emergency Service evacuated 30 people from a caravan park in Kyogle and responded to two landslide incidents.

==Economy==

Cattle grazing, dairy farming and forestry are the primary industries. In times past, timber getting was the main reason for settlement in the area, with red cedar and hoop pine the main timber trees.

== Railway ==
Kyogle station is served by the main North Coast railway line between Sydney and Brisbane. A train from Sydney to Brisbane stops at 2:46am and a train from Brisbane to Sydney stops at 7:53am (only stops if there are booked passengers getting on or off at Kyogle). A short crossing loop used to be located at the passenger station, but when the loop was extended for -long trains, the crossing loop was relocated to a more suitable – straighter – site outside town.

Further north along the railway line towards Brisbane, located at Cougal, is the Border Loop spiral, where the track loops 360 degrees and eventually passes over itself. This loop was constructed for trains to climb from the low side (NSW) to the high side (QLD) of the McPherson Range.

In 2012, Kyogle Council made a submission for a twice-daily train service, between Kyogle and Brisbane, which would benefit both the South East Queensland and the Kyogle regions, especially in tourism. 

==Demographics==
According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 3,464 people in Kyogle.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.0% of the population. 
* 82.4% of people were born in Australia and 87.4% of people spoke only English at home. 
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 24.1%, Catholic 22.3% and Anglican 19.1%.

== The Big Bush Turkey ==

Kyogle is home to one of Australia&#x27;s big things in the form of the Big Bush Turkey. This is located at the southern end of the town on Summerland Way. 

It was constructed by a Kyogle couple, John and Chrystine Graham, in 2018 and weighs 16 tonnes. It is 8.5 metres wide, 4 metres high and 20 centimetres thick.

It is sometimes called the Big Brush Turkey or the Big Scrub Turkey.

==NSW Tidy Towns winner==
Kyogle won the &quot;Young Legends&quot; category award at the 2012 Australian Tidy Town Awards. One of the judges, Dick Olesinski, described how Kyogle&#x27;s community encompasses a diverse range of projects that demonstrate the community&#x27;s commitment to Tidy Towns and other related environmental and beautification programs, saying &quot;Kyogle&#x27;s Tidy Towns Committee continues to deliver active and enthusiastic promotion of the town, providing infrastructure and support of community activities.&quot;

<text>Jamaica Kincaid (; born Elaine Cynthia Potter Richardson on May 25, 1949) is an Antiguan–American novelist, essayist, gardener, and gardening writer. Born in St. John&#x27;s, the capital of Antigua and Barbuda, she now lives in North Bennington, Vermont, and is Professor of African and African American Studies in Residence, Emerita at Harvard University.

==Biography==
Kincaid was born in St. John&#x27;s on the island of Antigua, on 25 May 1949. She grew up in relative poverty with her mother, a literate, cultured woman and homemaker, and her stepfather, a carpenter. She was very close to her mother until her three brothers were born in quick succession, starting when Kincaid was nine years old. After her brothers&#x27; births, she resented her mother, who thereafter focused primarily on the brothers&#x27; needs. Kincaid later recalled,

Our family money remained the same, but there were more people to feed and to clothe, and so everything got sort of shortened, not only material things but emotional things. The good emotional things, I got a short end of that. But then I got more of things I didn&#x27;t have, like a certain kind of cruelty and neglect.

In an interview for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Kincaid also said: &quot;The way I became a writer was that my mother wrote my life for me and told it to me.&quot;

Kincaid received, and frequently excelled in, a British education growing up, as Antigua did not gain independence from the United Kingdom until 1981. Although she was intelligent and frequently tested at the top of her class, Kincaid&#x27;s mother removed her from school at 16 to help support the family when her third and last brother was born, because her stepfather was ill and could no longer provide for the family. In 1966, when Kincaid was 17, her mother sent her to Scarsdale, a wealthy suburb of New York City, to work as an &quot;au pair&quot;. After this move, Kincaid refused to send money home; &quot;she left no forwarding address and was cut off from her family until her return to Antigua 20 years later&quot;.

===Family===
In 1979, Kincaid married the composer and Bennington College professor Allen Shawn, son of longtime &quot;The New Yorker&quot; editor William Shawn and brother of actor Wallace Shawn. The couple divorced in 2002. They have two children: a son, Harold, a graduate of Northeastern University, a music producer/songwriter who is the founder of Levelsoundz; and a daughter, Annie, who graduated from Harvard and now works in marketing. Kincaid is president of the official Levelsoundz Fan Club.

Kincaid is a keen gardener who has written extensively on the subject. 

She converted to Judaism in 2005.

===Career overview===
While working as an &quot;au pair&quot;, Kincaid enrolled in evening classes at a community college. After three years, she resigned from her job to attend Franconia College in New Hampshire on a full scholarship. She dropped out after a year and returned to New York, where she started writing for the teenage girls&#x27; magazine &quot;Ingénue&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine. She changed her name to Jamaica Kincaid in 1973, when her writing was first published. She described this name change as &quot;a way for [her] to do things without being the same person who couldn&#x27;t do them — the same person who had all these weights&quot;. Kincaid explained that &quot;Jamaica&quot; is an English corruption of what Columbus called Xaymaca, the part of the world that she comes from, and &quot;Kincaid&quot; appeared to go well with &quot;Jamaica&quot;. Her short fiction appeared in &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, and in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, where her 1990 novel &quot;Lucy&quot; was originally serialized.

Kincaid&#x27;s work has been both praised and criticized for its subject matter because it largely draws upon her own life and because her tone is often perceived as angry. Kincaid counters that many writers draw upon personal experience, so to describe her writing as autobiographical and angry is not valid criticism. 

Kincaid was the 50th commencement speaker at Bard College at Simon&#x27;s Rock in 2019.

====&quot;The New Yorker&quot;====
As a result of her budding writing career and friendship with George W. S. Trow, who wrote many pieces for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; column &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot;, Kincaid became acquainted with &quot;New Yorker&quot; editor William Shawn, who was impressed with her writing. He employed her as a staff writer in 1976 and eventually as a featured columnist for &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; for nine years. Shawn&#x27;s tutelage legitimized Kincaid as a writer and proved pivotal to her development of voice. In all, she was a staff writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for 20 years. She resigned from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1996 when then editor Tina Brown chose actress Roseanne Barr to guest-edit an issue as an original feminist voice. Though circulation rose under Brown, Kincaid was critical of Brown&#x27;s direction in making the magazine less literary and more celebrity-oriented.

Kincaid recalls that when she was a writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, she would often be questioned, particularly by women, on how she was able to obtain her position. Kincaid felt that these questions were posed because she was a young black woman &quot;from nowhere… I have no credentials. I have no money. I literally come from a poor place. I was a servant. I dropped out of college. The next thing you know I&#x27;m writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, I have this sort of life, and it must seem annoying to people.&quot;

&quot;Talk Stories&quot; was later published in 2001 as a collection of &quot;77 short pieces Kincaid wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s &#x27;Talk of the Town&#x27; column between 1974 and 1983&quot;.

===Recognition===
In December 2021, Kincaid was announced as the recipient of the 2022 &quot;Paris Review&quot; Hadada Prize, the magazine&#x27;s annual lifetime achievement award.

==Writing==
Her novels are loosely autobiographical, though Kincaid has warned against interpreting their autobiographical elements too literally: &quot;Everything I say is true, and everything I say is not true. You couldn&#x27;t admit any of it to a court of law. It would not be good evidence.&quot; Her work often prioritizes &quot;impressions and feelings over plot development&quot; and features conflict with both a strong maternal figure and colonial and neocolonial influences. Excerpts from her non-fiction book &quot;A Small Place&quot; were used as part of the narrative for Stephanie Black&#x27;s 2001 documentary, &quot;Life and Debt&quot;.

One of Kincaid&#x27;s contributions according to Henry Louis Gates, Jr, African-American literary critic, scholar, writer, and public intellectual, is that:

===Themes===
Kincaid&#x27;s writing explores such themes as colonialism and colonial legacy, postcolonialism and neo-colonialism, gender and sexuality, renaming, mother-daughter relationships, British and American imperialism, colonial education, writing, racism, class, power, death, and adolescence. In her most recent novel, &quot;See Now Then&quot;, Kincaid also first explores the theme of time.

===Tone and style===
Kincaid&#x27;s style has created disagreement among critics and scholars, and as Harold Bloom explains: &quot;Most of the published criticism of Jamaica Kincaid has stressed her political and social concerns, somewhat at the expense of her literary qualities.&quot; As works such as &quot;At the Bottom of the&quot; River and &quot;The Autobiography of My Mother&quot; use Antiguan cultural practices, some critics say these works employ magical realism. &quot;The author claims, however, that [her work] is &#x27;magic&#x27; and &#x27;real,&#x27; but not necessarily [works] of &#x27;magical realism&#x27;.&quot; Other critics claim that her style is &quot;modernist&quot; because much of her fiction is &quot;culturally specific and experimental&quot;. It has also been praised for its keen observation of character, curtness, wit, and lyrical quality. Her short story &quot;Girl&quot; is essentially a list of instructions on how a girl should live and act, but the messages are much larger than the literal list of suggestions. Derek Walcott, 1992 Nobel laureate, said of Kincaid&#x27;s writing: &quot;As she writes a sentence, psychologically, its temperature is that it heads toward its own contradiction. It&#x27;s as if the sentence is discovering itself, discovering how it feels. And that is astonishing, because it&#x27;s one thing to be able to write a good declarative sentence; it&#x27;s another thing to catch the temperature of the narrator, the narrator&#x27;s feeling. And that&#x27;s universal, and not provincial in any way&quot;. Susan Sontag has also commended Kincaid&#x27;s writing for its &quot;emotional truthfulness,&quot; poignancy, and complexity. Her writing has been described as &quot;fearless&quot; and her &quot;force and originality lie in her refusal to curb her tongue&quot;. Giovanna Covi describes her unique writing: &quot;The tremendous strength of Kincaid&#x27;s stories lies in their capacity to resist all canons. They move at the beat of a drum and the rhythm of jazz…&quot; She is described as writing with a &quot;double vision&quot; meaning that one line of plot mirrors another, providing the reader with rich symbolism that enhances the possibilities of interpretation.

===Influences===
Kincaid&#x27;s writing is largely influenced by her life circumstances even though she discourages readers from taking her fiction literally. To do so, according to the writer Michael Arlen, is to be &quot;disrespectful of a fiction writer&#x27;s ability to create fictional characters&quot;. Kincaid worked for Arlen, who would become a colleague at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, as an au pair and is the figure whom the father in &quot;Lucy&quot; is based on. Despite her caution to readers, Kincaid has also said: &quot;I would never say I wouldn&#x27;t write about an experience I&#x27;ve had.&quot;

===Reception and criticism===
The reception of Kincaid&#x27;s work has been mixed. Her writing stresses deep social and even political commentary, as Harold Bloom cites as a reason why the &quot;literary qualities&quot; of her work tend to be less of a focus for critics. Writing for Salon.com, Peter Kurth called Kincaid&#x27;s work &quot;My Brother&quot; the most overrated book of 1997. Reviewing her latest novel, &quot;See Now Then&quot; (2013), in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Dwight Garner called it &quot;bipolar&quot;, &quot;half séance, half ambush&quot;, and &quot;the kind of lumpy exorcism that many writers would have composed and then allowed to remain unpublished. It picks up no moral weight as it rolls along. It asks little of us, and gives little in return.&quot; Another &quot;New York Times&quot; review describes it as &quot;not an easy book to stomach&quot; but goes on to explain, &quot;Kincaid&#x27;s force and originality lie in her refusal to curb her tongue, in an insistence on home truths that spare herself least of all.&quot; Kate Tuttle addresses this in an article for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;: &quot;Kincaid allowed that critics are correct to point out the book&#x27;s complexity. &quot;The one thing the book is,&quot; she said, &quot;is difficult, and I meant it to be.&quot; Some critics have been harsh, such as one review for &quot;Mr Potter&quot; (2002) that reads: &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t be so hard if the repetition weren&#x27;t coupled, here and everywhere it occurs, with a stern rebuff to any idea that it might be meaningful.&quot; On the other hand, there has been much praise for her writing, for instance: &quot;The superb precision of Kincaid&#x27;s style makes it a paradigm of how to avoid lots of novelistic pitfalls.&quot;

In February 2022, Kincaid was one of 38 Harvard faculty members to sign a letter to &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; defending Professor John Comaroff, who had been found to have violated the university&#x27;s sexual and professional conduct policies. The letter defended Comaroff as &quot;an excellent colleague, advisor and committed university citizen&quot; and expressed dismay over his being sanctioned by the university. After students filed a lawsuit with detailed allegations of Comaroff&#x27;s actions and the university&#x27;s failure to respond, Kincaid was one of several signatories to say that she wished to retract her signature.

<text>Circuit City Corporation, Inc., formerly Circuit City Stores, Inc., is an American consumer electronics retail company, which was founded in 1949 by Samuel Wurtzel as the Wards Company, operated stores across the United States, and pioneered the electronics superstore format in the 1970s. After multiple purchases and a successful run on the NYSE, it changed its name to Circuit City Stores Inc.

Ronny Shmoel re-established the brand name in 2016 as part of his acquisition of the brand name and trademark rights sold by Systemax. Systemax formerly operated the CircuitCity.com website from 2009 until 2012, when it was consolidated into the TigerDirect brand, which kept the website open until 2023, when the website shut down.

==Retail History==
===As Wards Company (1949–1984)===
In early 1949, Wurtzel was on vacation in Richmond, Virginia when, while at a local barber shop, he was witness to the start of television in the South. Imagining the opportunities, in late 1949, he moved his family to Richmond and opened the first Wards Company retail store. Later, Abraham L. Hecht joined him as a partner in the business.

By 1959, Wards Company operated four television and home appliance stores in Richmond. The company continued to grow and acquired stores in other locations including Albany, New York; Mobile, Alabama; Washington, D.C.; and Costa Mesa, California. During the 1970s and early 1980s, it also sold mail-order under &quot;Dixie Hi Fi&quot; and advertised in hi-fi magazines. Wards experimented with several retail formats in Richmond, including smaller mall outlets branded &quot;Sight-n-Sound&quot; and &quot;Circuit City&quot;.

Samuel Wurtzel served as president of the company until 1970 and remained the chairman until 1984. Alan Wurtzel, his son, became CEO of Wards in 1972 and initially focused on digesting the acquisitions and shedding unprofitable operations. After developing a long range plan for the company in 1973, construction began on a distribution center and new corporate offices building at 2040 Thalbro Street (named after Thalhimer Bros. Department Store) in Richmond, Virginia and in the extra space, &quot;Wards Loading Dock&quot;, its first warehouse showroom opened on May 1, 1975. The large-format store was popular with customers. The company continued to expand with the new format modeled after &quot;Wards Loading Dock&quot; and renamed it Circuit City Superstore in 1978; the first locations called such opened on June 22 of that year in North Carolina.

===As Circuit City Stores (1984–2009)===

Wards Company officially changed its name to Circuit City Stores, Inc., and became listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1984. One of the company&#x27;s early slogans was &quot;Circuit City — Where the Streets are Paved with Bargains&quot;. The company, which had leased floor space from the Zodys discount stores as well as other department stores, began acquiring retail stores and turning them into Circuit City Superstores. The first of these replacements occurred in Knoxville, Tennessee; Charleston, South Carolina; and Hampton, Virginia.

In 1981, Circuit City entered the New York City market by acquiring the six remaining stores of the bankrupt Lafayette Radio chain. They operated the stores under the &quot;Lafayette/Circuit City&quot; name and expanded to 15 locations, but the stores were not profitable and were closed in 1986 after spending US$20 million (~$ in ) to enter the market.

In 1985, Circuit City entered the Los Angeles market by opening seven Superstore locations in former The Akron discount stores. The next year, Circuit City opened five more Superstores in the market and closed the licensed electronics and appliance departments it operated in Zodys stores. The new stores featured the &quot;red tower&quot; entrance that ultimately became a trademark of the company. The towers were designed to make the store more identifiable to drivers among the endless stores and shopping centers in Los Angeles.

In 1988, Circuit City began constructing the new &quot;plug&quot; design Superstore formats. The company also returned to New York City, opening a superstore in Union Square, the first of two planned Manhattan locations. In late 1988, Circuit City had an opportunity to purchase Best Buy, a growing competitor at the time, for US$30 million (~$ in ). The offer was rejected by Richard Sharp, Circuit City&#x27;s CEO, since he believed they could open a store in Best Buy&#x27;s home territory of Minneapolis and easily beat the competitor.

During this era, Circuit City became known for its exceptional service, going so far as to have many of its staff factory-trained. Its slogan, likewise, was &quot;Welcome to Circuit City, Where Service Is State of the Art&quot;.
Many Circuit City stores were out-of-date and in bad locations, unable to compete with newer Best Buy stores. In 2000, Circuit City moved away from the Superstore showroom format and introduced a new more self-service &quot;Big Box&quot; format called &quot;Horizon.&quot; The new format eliminated the red tower entrances and moved the entrance to the center of the store. The selling floor was enlarged with lower sight lines and the race track was removed. A central checkout was located at the front of the store and shopping baskets were added for small items. Appliances were eliminated to make room for games, computer peripherals, and other small electronics. The plan was to open stand-alone major appliance stores, but later that plan was dropped. One new store in Jacksonville, Florida incorporated the new design and twenty-five existing Florida stores were remodeled to this format.

In July 2000, Circuit City abandoned the large appliance business in all stores to make space for more small electronics. This was controversial because in the previous year Circuit City was the second largest appliance retailer in the United States, behind only Sears. The company had earned nearly US$1.6 billion in sales revenue from large appliances in 1999. However, executives were concerned about the competition from Home Depot and Lowe&#x27;s and believed there would be big savings in warehouse storage and delivery costs if they quit the large appliance business. It was later realized that Circuit City thus missed out on the residential housing boom of the mid-2000s, which saw a dramatic rise in new-appliance sales.

Every Superstore was retrofitted after the exit from the large-appliance business, using the space for an expanded self-serve computer accessory and software selection. Under an exclusive agreement with Sony, the only games that had been sold at the stores were PlayStation games. The new space allowed them to sell Nintendo, Sega, and eventually Xbox games after the agreement ended. Music and movie sales had been added to most stores years before, but the extra space allowed the selection to be added to smaller stores. The retrofitting project alone cost the company US$1.5 billion.

Another store format, called &quot;Tide&quot;, was created based on research conducted that found women and teenagers were not respected by the Circuit City sales staff. The front of the store featured windows allowing customers to see in and the signage was improved. Power poles and movable fixtures allowed for easy rearrangement of the store and lowered the cost of remodeling older locations since the floor did not need to be trenched. In 2001, Chicago stores were remodeled with parts of this format and all new locations opened with this design.

In March 2002, Circuit City purchased the key assets for 800.com, which included their entire 2.6 million customer list, websites, and marketing assets. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

In 2003, Circuit City converted to a single hourly pay structure in all stores, eliminating commissioned sales. Many previously commissioned sales associates were offered new positions as hourly &quot;product specialists&quot;, while 3,900 salespeople were laid off, saving the company about $130 million per year. Many company insiders later revealed that they thought this was the most influential company decision that would ultimately lead to its demise.

In 2004, with the expansion of the wireless phone market, Circuit City partnered with Verizon Wireless to include full-service Verizon Wireless sales and service centers in each Superstore. These locations were owned and staffed by Verizon Wireless. Circuit City stopped selling wireless phones with all other carriers due to the agreement.

In April 2004, Circuit City announced its purchase of Canadian retailer InterTAN. Circuit City paid approximately US$284 million for InterTAN&#x27;s 980 stores, which operated in Canada under the trade names RadioShack, Rogers Plus, and Battery Plus. Chairman and CEO Alan McCollough believed these existing small-format stores provided an easy entry into Canada, a country where Best Buy had been expanding. RadioShack sued InterTan in April 2004 over the branding use of RadioShack in Canada. Circuit City lost the lawsuit and all Canadian locations were renamed The Source by Circuit City in 2005. These stores were sold to Bell Canada and continue to operate.
In 2007, a new store format was introduced as &quot;The City&quot; and designed to eliminate previously under-utilized space. The smaller format gave the company greater flexibility to enter new markets and backfill existing ones. Most new store openings in 2008 used this new store format.

On February 8, 2007, Circuit City announced that it planned to close seven domestic Superstores and a Kentucky distribution center to cut costs and improve its financial performance. News reports also mention that 62 stores in Canada were to close.

Circuit City announced on February 23, 2007, that its chief financial officer, Michael Foss, would leave the company. This unsettled investors and analysts, who were concerned about management turnover. &quot;This represents the third departure of a senior executive in he past six months, and the second departure of a top-five executive in the past month&quot;, said Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler in a client note. Chief Executive Officer Phil Schoonover&#x27;s &quot;hand-picked team is turning over faster than we would like to see in a turnaround situation.&quot;

In 2007, the starting wage for new employees was dropped from $8.75 an hour down to $7.40 an hour ($6.55 being the federal minimum wage at the time). In a press release on March 28, 2007, Circuit City announced that in a &quot;wage management&quot; decision, it had laid off approximately 3400 better-paid associates and would re-staff the positions at the lower market-based salaries. Laid-off associates were provided severance and offered a chance to be re-hired after ten weeks at prevailing wages. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported interviews with management concerning the firings. The &quot;Post&quot; later reported in May 2007 that the layoffs, and consequent loss of experienced sales staff, appeared to be &quot;backfiring&quot; and resulting in slower sales.

In April 2008, video rental firm Blockbuster announced a bid worth $1 billion (~$ in ) to purchase Circuit City. In July 2008, Blockbuster withdrew its offer due to market conditions.

In August 2008, the chain&#x27;s head office demanded stores destroy all copies of an issue of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine which described &quot;Sucker City&quot; as a chain with a long list of locations, all in proximity to each other and each adjacent to a rival Best Buy store.

Philip J. Schoonover, CEO, president and chairman of the board of Circuit City Stores, Inc. announced his immediate resignation on September 22, 2008. James A. Marcum, former vice chairman of the board, was named acting CEO. Allen King was selected chairman of the board.
This switch was said to be due to a stream of losses stemming from the rapid decline of flat-panel TV prices, and possibly due to the strong call for Schoonover&#x27;s removal from activist shareholder Mark Wattles.

=== Bankruptcy and liquidation ===
On November 4, 2008, Circuit City announced that it would close 155 stores and lay off 17% of its workforce by the end of the year as a result of continuing difficulties in remaining profitable. On November 7, 2008, Circuit City laid off between 500 and 800 corporate employees from its Richmond, Virginia headquarters. The approximately 1,000 remaining corporate employees were consolidated into one building, to further reduce costs and improve profitability. On November 10, 2008, Circuit City filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. At that time, Circuit City&#x27;s stock traded well below $1 per share, and was removed from listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

In bankruptcy court, Circuit City was approved to borrow $1.1 billion to finance operations while restructuring. Court filings revealed that the company had assets of $3.4 billion and debt of $2.32 billion, including a $119 million debt to Hewlett-Packard and a $116 million debt to Samsung Electronics. Chief executive James A. Marcum promised that the stores would stay open and the chain would not be liquidated.

On November 18, 2008, it was announced that Ricardo Salinas Pliego, current owner of Mexican television broadcaster TV Azteca and electronics store chain Elektra, had purchased 28 percent of Circuit City.
On January 10, 2009, it was announced by a company spokesman that Circuit City needed a buyer by January 16, 2009, to keep from shutting its doors due to an approaching deadline set by the court and creditors. Although two unnamed parties were interested in buying out Circuit City, a bidder could not be found, so Circuit City, with bankruptcy court approval, converted its Chapter 11 bankruptcy to Chapter 7, and started airing &quot;going out of business&quot; commercials, as they started closing all of their stores. The Canadian operations, which were run under The Source by Circuit City banner, were not initially affected by the liquidation, but were later sold to Bell Canada.

According to Circuit City&#x27;s website, the company announced on January 16, 2009, that it intended to liquidate all of its stores. Reportedly, over 30,000 employees lost their jobs in the liquidation, as well as 45% of Verizon&#x27;s Circuit City sales force being laid off with the remainder resigning or transferring to other Verizon locations.

The final day of operations for all Circuit City stores was March 8, 2009. Besides retail auto dealerships, Circuit City closed more retail locations in the U.S. than any other retail chain in 2009. Circuit City selected Great American Group LLC, Hudson Capital Partners LLC, SB Capital Group LLC, and Tiger Capital Group LLC to handle the liquidation of all stores nationwide. Liquidation was completed on March 9, 2009.

During the liquidation of all Circuit City stores across the nation, the company&#x27;s online store was closed, and replaced it with a page that read as follows:

===Purchase by Systemax===
Systemax, Inc., in April 2009, signed a stalking horse agreement for $6.5 million (~$ in ), which was an initial offer for the bankrupt Circuit City&#x27;s assets.

On May 13, 2009, it was announced that Systemax had purchased the Circuit City brand name, trademarks, and e-commerce website for US$14 million (~$ in ) at auction from Circuit City Stores, Inc. on May 11, with the deal set to take effect on May 19. Systemax relaunched the CircuitCity.com website on May 22, 2009, as an online retailer of consumer electronics. Systemax had earlier acquired both CompUSA and TigerDirect separately, which superficially continued to operate as separate online retailers with the same website formats and product catalog along with the new CircuitCity.com site. The revived site&#x27;s front page initially looked similar to the original front page, while other pages were similar in appearance and functionality to the other two sites. All three sites eventually transitioned into slightly rebranded mirrors of each other.

On November 2, 2012, it was announced that Systemax would drop both the CompUSA and Circuit City storefront brands by consolidating their businesses under the TigerDirect brand and website. This ended, after 63 years, the use of the Circuit City brand name.

===Circuit City Corporation===
It was reported in January 2016 that the Circuit City brand would be revived as Circuit City Corporation by area retail veteran Ronny Shmoel, who acquired the brand from Systemax. Circuit City was originally set to reopen in June 2016, but the postponed relaunch was announced at CES for February 15, 2018. On August 22, 2018, Circuit City Corporation officially relaunched the brand name as an online retailer and announced plans to begin operating as a store-within-a-store chain. It also planned to open some new Circuit City retail stores in the future, but never materialized. On December 13, 2023, Circuit City announced its intention to raise US$25M. Shmoel aims to establish strategic alliances (in alternative to brick-and-mortar stores) with undisclosed national enterprises (potentially including JCPenney) to launch a &quot;Powered by Circuit City&quot; initiative.

==Former subsidiaries==
===CarMax===
CarMax is a used car auto superstore concept developed in 1991 at Circuit City by Austin Ligon, then Circuit City&#x27;s Senior VP of Planning, and Rick Sharp, then Circuit City CEO. The goal of CarMax was to revolutionize used car retailing through a combination of large selection (400+ used cars at each store); low, no-haggle pricing; guaranteed quality; and a consumer-friendly shopping experience. The first location opened in Richmond, Virginia in September 1993. CarMax grew slowly for its first four years as the team refined the basic concept, then went public through an IPO as a &quot;tracking stock&quot; (KMX) of Circuit City in February 1997. The offering was managed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, and raised more than $400m for a 20% interest in the company, with Circuit City retaining the remaining 80% ownership. CarMax used the proceeds to repay Circuit City&#x27;s initial $170mm investment in the company, then used the remainder to grow rapidly, adding 27 more stores from 1997 to 2000, and turning its first profit in FY2001. Circuit City sold a further 10% of its interest in CarMax in July 2001 for $140mm (~$ in ), with proceeds going to Circuit City. CarMax was spun off from Circuit City in tax-free distribution to shareholders in October 2002 to allow both companies to grow and be valued independently. The stock distribution provided Circuit City shareholders with KMX stock valued at over $1.2bn (~$ in ) at the time of the spin off in 2002.

===Circuit City Express===
Circuit City Express was a chain of mall-based Circuit City stores with over 50 locations at its peak. The first locations opened in Baltimore, Maryland; Richmond, Virginia; and McLean, Virginia in 1989. The stores were originally known as Impulse, but were later renamed in 1993 to focus on the strength of the Circuit City brand. These stores focused on small electronic products for personal use or to be given as gifts. Cellular phones were a major focus of the business since all major carriers were sold until the exclusive agreement with Verizon Wireless in 2004. Circuit City Express stores offered Superstore prices and the Circuit City &quot;Price Match Guarantee&quot; in a mall environment. Most of the locations closed in the early 2000s as their original 10-year leases expired. There was also a Circuit City Express location inside Charlestowne Mall in Saint Charles, Illinois.

=== Connect ===
Connect was a store concept operated as a joint venture between Circuit City and Comcast. These small stores offered Comcast cable services, plus select electronics and Firedog tech support services from Circuit City. The first Connect store opened in Medford, Massachusetts in December 2006, followed by a second in nearby Burlington in May 2007.

===DIVX===

DIVX was developed by Circuit City and launched in 1997 as an alternative to DVD. DIVX discs cost $5 each, but could only be played for 48 hours on proprietary set-top players before a continuation fee was required to continue viewing. The player was connected to a phone line to check whether the disc was still valid. Opposition to the format and limited acceptance by the public led Circuit City to discontinue the format in 1999. Circuit City took a US$114 million loss to close its DIVX division.

===Firedog===
Firedog was launched in August 2006 to provide in-store, in-home, and online computer and home theatre technical support and installation services in competition with other retailers&#x27; consumer and business technical services offerings such as Best Buy&#x27;s Geek Squad and Staples&#x27; EasyTech. The Firedog brand was sold to Firstmark for US$250,000 (~$ in ) in September 2009, approximately six months after the liquidation of all Circuit City stores.

===First North American National Bank===
First North American National Bank was created by Circuit City to operate its private-label credit card in 1990. In 2002, Circuit City began offering a co-branded Visa credit card. It sold both of these operations in 2004 to Bank One (now Chase Bank).

===Patapsco Designs===
Patapsco Designs was acquired by Circuit City in 1987. The company was in charge of designing product displays and other electronic services for Circuit City. Patapsco Designs was founded in 1977 and is based in Frederick, Maryland and in November 2004 was acquired by American Computer Development Inc. Patapsco Designs, Inc. filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in joint administration with Circuit City Stores, Inc. in November 2008.

==Legal battles==
In 2004, RadioShack sued InterTAN to prematurely terminate its role as reseller for the Radio Shack line in Canada; the stores rebranded as &quot;The Source by Circuit City&quot;. In 2005, InterTAN sued RadioShack in an attempt to prevent it from re-entering the Canadian marketplace as a direct competitor; while this effort failed, the nine new RadioShack-branded stores closed their doors by 2007.

In 2005, Circuit City agreed to pay $173,220 in settlement and investigation reimbursement costs due to a false advertising claim in a 2004 New Jersey court case. The court found that important information about sale items was purposely obscured within the advertisement, thus potentially deceiving customers.

Circuit City&#x27;s City Advantage Plan was also challenged in a United States District Court in Massachusetts. The plaintiffs&#x27; claim concerned Circuit City&#x27;s cancellation of its warranty plan without full disclosure of the plan at the time of sale. The plaintiffs cited breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act. Circuit City requested the matter be dismissed. The court, however, upheld the plaintiffs&#x27; claim that the monies paid for the protection plan be reimbursed and credit be issued for non-working goods returned.

Liquidators handling the sale of remaining Circuit City inventory have also become the target of consumer complaints, not only for often-uncompetitive pricing of items but also for an &quot;all sales final&quot; policy which allows the sale of defective or damaged merchandise at former Circuit City locations with no recourse afforded to the consumer.

==Real estate holdings==
Due to the expansion of Circuit City stores in the 1970s–1990s, the company accumulated a surplus of unused real estate with a presence in nearly every major market in the country. Although a typical retail location is approximately 30,000 square feet (2700 m2), the company had numerous freestanding and in-line locations ranging from 2,000 to 50,000 square feet (180 to 4500 m2), and had surplus office, service and distribution locations scattered across the country. During Circuit City&#x27;s 2005 fiscal year (March 1, 2004, through February 28, 2005), the company disposed of approximately 1.2 million square feet (108,000 m2) of vacant retail space. In January 2007, Circuit City&#x27;s vice president for real estate announced plans to open 200–300 stores in the next two years, a large increase from the current trend of 10–12 stores a year. Due to the economic conditions the company faced, they did not reach that goal. Many of these stores, however, did open in 2008 and operated for only a few weeks before closing. Some were built and never opened, and upon the company&#x27;s declaration of bankruptcy, it was discovered that large expenditures were due to paying leases on buildings that were not even opened to the public.

In January 2010, the main Circuit City headquarters building was put up for sale. The five-story office building, &quot;Deep Run I&quot;, had been appraised at $46.2 million. New York–based Lexington Property Trust defaulted on a $17 million commercial mortgage and the lender foreclosed on the property. The asking price was set at $11 million. The former headquarters was sold in September 2010, for $3 million (~$ in ) to DRCC Properties, LLC. They also bought the of land that the building sits on for $2.75 million.

<doc id="939051" wikidata="Q209535" url="?curid=939051" title="False Dmitry I">
<text>False Dmitry I or Pseudo-Demetrius I () reigned as the Tsar of all Russia from 10 June 1605 until his death on 17 May 1606 under the name of Dmitriy Ivanovich (). According to historian Chester S.L. Dunning, Dmitry was &quot;the only Tsar ever raised to the throne by means of a military campaign and popular uprisings&quot;.

He was the first, and most successful, of three impostors who claimed during the Time of Troubles to be the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible, tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich, who supposedly escaped a 1591 assassination attempt when he was eight years old. It is generally believed that the real Dmitry of Uglich died in Uglich in 1591. False Dmitry claimed that his mother, Maria Nagaya, anticipated the assassination attempt ordered by Boris Godunov and helped him escape to a monastery in the Tsardom of Russia, and the assassins killed somebody else instead. He said he fled to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth after he came to the attention of Boris Godunov, who ordered him seized. Many Polish nobles did not believe his story, but nonetheless supported him.

With the support of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, False Dmitry invaded Russia in 1605, but the war ended with the sudden death of Boris Godunov. Disaffected Russian boyars staged a coup against the new tsar, Feodor II. False Dmitry entered Moscow on 21 July 1605, and was crowned tsar. Maria Nagaya accepted him as her son and &quot;confirmed&quot; his story. False Dmitry&#x27;s reign was marked by his openness to Catholicism and allowing foreigners into Russia. This made him unpopular with the boyars, who staged a successful coup and killed him eleven months after he took the throne. His wife of 10 days, Marina, would later &quot;accept&quot; False Dmitry II as her fallen husband.

==Background==
Dmitry entered history circa 1600, after making a positive impression on Patriarch Job of Moscow with his learning and assurance. Tsar Boris Godunov ordered the young man seized and questioned. Dmitry fled to Prince Constantine Ostrogski at Ostroh, in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and subsequently entered the service of the Wiśniowieckis, a polonized Ruthenian family. The princes Adam and Michał Wiśniowiecki in particular showed interest in the stories Dmitry told, and who he purported to be, as they gave the Poles an opportunity to capitalize on the political rancor in Moscow.

Rumors said that Dmitry was an illegitimate son of the Polish king, Stefan Batory, who reigned from 1575 to 1586. According to a later tale, Dmitry blurted out that identity once, when a violent master slapped him. Dmitry&#x27;s own story was that his mother, Tsar Ivan&#x27;s widow, anticipated Boris Godunov&#x27;s assassination attempt, and put him into the care of a doctor, who hid him in various monasteries through the years. After the doctor died, Dmitry fled to Poland, and worked briefly there as a teacher before he entered the service of the Wiśniowieckis. Some who had known Ivan IV later claimed that Dmitry did indeed resemble the young tsarevich. The young man also possessed such aristocratic skills as horsemanship and literacy, and was fluent in Russian, Polish, and French.

Whether or not Dmitry&#x27;s tale was accurate, the Wiśniowiecki brothers, Samuel Tyszkiewicz, Jan Sapieha, Roman Różyński, and several other Polish noblemen agreed to back him, and his claim, against Boris Godunov.

In March 1604, Dmitry visited the court of Sigismund III Vasa in Kraków. The king provisionally supported him, but did not promise any military help. To attract the powerful Jesuits to his cause, Dmitry publicly converted to Roman Catholicism on 17 April 1604, and convinced papal nuncio Claudio Rangoni to also back his claim.

While at court, Dmitry met Marina Mniszech, daughter of Polish nobleman Jerzy Mniszech. Dmitry and Marina fell in love. When he asked her father for her hand, he was promised it in return for granting the Mniszechs full rights to the Russian towns of Pskov, Novgorod, Smolensk, and Novhorod-Siverskyi upon his ascension.

==Russian throne==

Boris Godunov received word of Dmitry&#x27;s Polish support, and spread claims than the younger man was simply a runaway monk called Grigory Otrepyev (born Yuri Otrepyev; Grigory was the name given to him at the monastery). On what information this claim was based is uncertain. But the tsar&#x27;s public support began to wane, especially as Dmitry&#x27;s loyalists spread counter-rumors. Several Russian boyars also pledged themselves to Dmitry, thereby giving themselves a &quot;legitimate&quot; reason to not pay taxes to Tsar Boris.

Dmitry, having gained the full support of the Polish Commonwealth, formed a small army of approximately 3,500 soldiers from various private Polish and Lithuanian forces. With his men he advanced on Russia in March 1605. Boris&#x27;s many enemies, including the southern Cossacks, joined Dmitry&#x27;s army on the long march to Moscow. These combined forces fought two engagements with reluctant Russian soldiers. Winning the first, they captured Chernigov (modern Chernihiv), Putivl (Putyvl), Sevsk, and Kursk, but they badly lost the second battle. Their cause was only saved by the news of the sudden death of Boris Godunov on 13 April 1605.

The death of the unpopular tsar swept away the last impediment to Dmitry; the victorious Russian troops defected to his side, and others swelled the Polish ranks as they marched in. On 1 June, the disaffected boyars of Moscow staged a palace coup and imprisoned the newly crowned tsar Feodor II and his mother Maria Skuratova-Belskaya, widow of Boris Godunov.

On 20 June, Dmitry made his triumphal entry into Moscow with 8,000 cossacks and Poles according to Isaac Massa, and on 21 July was crowned tsar by a new Muscovite Patriarch of his own choosing, the Greek Ignatius of Moscow.

==Reign==

The new tsar moved to consolidate his power by visiting the tomb of Tsar Ivan, and the convent of his widow Maria Nagaya, who accepted him as her son and &quot;confirmed&quot; his story. The Godunovs were killed, including Tsar Feodor and his mother, with the exception of Tsarevna Xenia, whom Dmitry raped and kept as a concubine for five months. Many of the noble families Tsar Boris had exiled – such as the Shuiskys, Golitsins and Romanovs – were pardoned and allowed to return to Moscow. Feodor Romanov, sire of the future imperial dynasty, was soon appointed as metropolitan of Rostov; the old patriarch Job, who did not recognize the new tsar, was sent into exile.

Dmitry planned to introduce a series of political and economic reforms. He restored Yuri&#x27;s Day, the day when serfs were allowed to change their allegiance to another lord, easing the conditions of peasantry. His favorite at the Russian court, 18-year-old Prince Ivan Khvorostinin, is considered by historians to be one of Russia&#x27;s first Westernizers.

In foreign policy, Dmitry sought an alliance with his sponsor, the Polish Commonwealth, and with the Papal States. He planned for war against the Ottoman Empire, ordering mass production of firearms to prepare for the conflict. In his correspondence, he referred to himself as &quot;Emperor of Russia&quot; a century before Tsar Peter I used the title, although this was not recognized at the time. Dmitry&#x27;s royal depictions featured him clean-shaven, with slicked-back dark hair, an unusual look for the era.

On 8 May 1606, Dmitry married Marina Mniszech in Moscow; she was Catholic. When a Russian Tsar married a woman of another faith, the usual practice was that she would convert to Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Rumors circulated that Dmitry had obtained the support of Polish King Sigismund and Pope Paul V by promising to reunite the Russian Orthodox Church and the Holy See; so, claimed the rumors, Tsarina Marina did not convert to the Orthodox faith. This angered the Russian Orthodox Church, the boyars, and the population alike.

The resentful Prince Vasily Shuisky, head of the boyars, began to plot against the tsar, accusing him of spreading Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, and sodomy. This gained traction and popular support, especially since Dmitry surrounded himself with foreigners who flouted Russian customs — something the conservative Russian society of the time could not accept. According to Russian chronicler Avraamy Palitsyn, Dmitry further enraged many Muscovites by permitting his Catholic and Protestant soldiers, whom the Russian Church regarded as heretics, to pray in Orthodox churches.

Shuisky&#x27;s adherents had spread word that Tsar Dmitry was about to order his Polish retainers to lock the city gates and massacre the people of Moscow. Whether such orders existed or not, Palitsyn&#x27;s chronicle reported them as undeniable fact.

==Death==
On the morning of 17 May 1606, ten days after Dmitry&#x27;s marriage to Marina, huge numbers of boyars and commoners stormed the Kremlin. Dmitry tried to flee by jumping out a window, but fractured his leg in the fall. He fled to a bathhouse and tried to disappear within. But he was recognized and dragged out by the boyars, who killed him lest he successfully appeal to the crowd. His body was hacked to pieces, burned, and then the ashes fired from a cannon towards Poland. According to Palitsyn, Dmitry&#x27;s death set off a massacre of his supporters. He boasted in his chronicle that &quot;a great amount of heretical blood was spilled on the streets of Moscow.&quot;

Dmitry&#x27;s reign had lasted only eleven months before Prince Shuisky took his place. Two further impostors later appeared, False Dmitry II and False Dmitry III, the first of whom was publicly &quot;accepted&quot; by Tsarina Marina as her fallen husband.

==Portrayals in literature==
*False Dmitry is one of the primary characters in Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s blank verse drama &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. Pushkin&#x27;s character is a young novice monk who impersonates the Tsarevich after he learns he is the age the child would have been had he lived. Pushkin&#x27;s decision to humanise the False Dmitry earned him the disapproval of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, who prevented the play from being published or staged. In an unpublished foreword, Pushkin wrote, &quot;There is much of Henri IV in Dmitri. Like him he is brave, generous and boastful, like him indifferent to religion -- both abjure their faith for a political cause, both love pleasures and war, both devote themselves to chimerical projects, both are victims of conspiracies... But Henri IV didn&#x27;t have a Ksenya [Xenia] on his conscience -- it is true that this horrible accusation hasn&#x27;t been proved and, as for me, I make a point of not believing it.&quot; Pushkin intended to write further plays about the reigns of Dmitry and Vasili, as well as the subsequent Time of Troubles. Pushkin was prevented from fulfilling these plans by his death in a duel at the age of 37.
*Although based on Pushkin&#x27;s play, Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera of the same name demonizes False Dmitry, the Polish people, and the Roman Catholic Church. False Dmitry&#x27;s engagement to Marina Mniszech is portrayed as instigated by a Jesuit. Marina balks at seducing the pretender, and the Jesuit threatens her with hellfire until she grovels at his feet. In contrast, Pushkin believed that Marina was motivated by pathological ambition. At the opera&#x27;s denouement, the pretender&#x27;s ascent to the throne is lamented by the holy fool Nikolai, who appears in Pushkin&#x27;s play only to rebuke Tsar Boris for murdering the real Dmitry. In Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera, the holy fool proclaims, &quot;Weep, weep Orthodox soul&quot;, and predicts that &quot;the enemy will come&quot; leading to &quot;darkness blacker than night.&quot; 
*False Dmitry&#x27;s story was also told by Schiller (in &quot;Demetrius&quot;), Sumarokov, Khomyakov, by Victorin Joncières in his opera &quot;Dimitri&quot;, and by Antonín Dvořák in his opera &quot;Dimitrij&quot;. 
*Rainer Maria Rilke recounts the overthrow of False Dimitry in &quot;The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge&quot;, Rilke&#x27;s only longer prose work.
*Harold Lamb fictionalizes the demise of False Dimitry in &quot;The Wolf Master&quot;, in which the claimant survives his assassination through trickery, and flees east, pursued by a Cossack he had betrayed.
*A false Dmitry features in the second story of The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Back to Earth (Volume 2.1), a boxset of Doctor Who audio dramas from Big Finish Productions. In that story the False Dmitry is under the control of aliens who wish to conquer Russia and then the world with a robot army.

<text>Sir Cyril David Townsend (21 December 1937 − 20 November 2013) was a British politician.

Townsend was elected Conservative Member of Parliament for Bexleyheath at the February 1974 election, and held the seat until retiring at the 1997 election.

== Early life ==
Townsend was born in Woking to Lois Henderson and Lieutenant Colonel Cyril Townsend. He was educated at Bradfield College and Sandhurst.

== Military career ==
He was commissioned in 1958 into the Durham Light Infantry. He served during the end of the Cyprus Emergency. He was promoted to captain in December 1963. In 1966 he fought in Malaysia in the confrontation with Indonesia. He was the Hong Kong Governor&#x27;s aide-de-camp from 1964 to 1966, and in March 1968, after two years serving as adjutant to the first battalion of the Durham Light Infantry, retired from the army at the rank of captain.

== Politics ==
After joining the Conservative Party, Townsend was recruited as a personal assistant by Edward Heath, the party leader, in 1968. When the party returned to government in 1970 he became political secretary to the leader of the Greater London Council, Sir Desmond Plummer. In 1972 he was selected as the new Conservative candidate for Bexleyheath, whose predecessor constituency, Bexley, Edward Heath had left in favour of neighbouring Sidcup due to boundary changes. In February 1974 Townsend was elected with a majority of 3686 votes, despite his party being defeated overall and the seat being considered marginal.

=== Member of Parliament ===
Townsend was made a member of the Select Committee on Violence in the Family, and, concerned about child sex abuse, was the sponsor of the Protection of Children Act 1978, which he introduced as a private member&#x27;s bill in 1977.

A liberal Conservative, he never obtained ministerial office under Margaret Thatcher, whom he frequently opposed. In 1979, after six months as Parliamentary private secretary to Reg Prentice, he resigned over immigration restrictions on Asian fiancés. He criticised Geoffrey Howe&#x27;s 1981 budget and in November 1982 was the only Conservative MP to oppose benefit cuts. A strong supporter of local government, he opposed the Local Government Act 1985, including the abolition of the Greater London Council. In 1988 and 1989 he opposed the government&#x27;s move not to increase child benefit.

As a former officer he advocated a robust defence policy, supporting the Trident nuclear programme and opposing defence cuts under John Major. He also supported the boycott of the Moscow Olympics in 1980 in response to the Soviet–Afghan War, and was elected eight times as vice-chair of the Tory backbenchers&#x27; defence committee. However, he opposed Thatcher&#x27;s &quot;Fortress Falklands&quot; policy and sought reconciliation and negotiation with Argentina. In 1983 this led to his removal from the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs. In 1988 he was in charge of a Parliamentary Designation to Iran.

Townsend was pro-European, advocating Britain&#x27;s membership of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. He criticised Thatcher for her Euroscepticism, which led to him supporting Michael Heseltine in the 1990 Tory leadership election. As a result, in January 1991 the executive of his constituency association proposed to make him stand for reselection, with Townsend&#x27;s critics saying that he was a maverick who failed to consult his local party on key issues. The motion fell when put to the full association the next month.

After retaining his seat at the 1992 general election with a majority of 14,086, he served on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. After the 1997 boundary changes he was not selected as a candidate for Bexleyheath and Crayford and left Parliament having been knighted in the 1997 New Year Honours.

=== Outside Parliament ===
Townsend was part of the Council for Arab-British Understanding. He served as joint chair during the 1980s, and became joint president in 1996. After retiring from Parliament he took this role full-time until stepping down in 2002. He served as an observer for the European Union at the 1996 Palestinian elections.

In 2005 he became disillusioned with the Conservatives. In 2006, having joined the Liberal Democrats due to support for European integration, he supported Menzies Campbell&#x27;s bid for the party leadership.

== Journalism ==
Townsend was a respected journalist who wrote for several Middle Eastern newspapers (including &quot;Al-Hayat&quot;, for which he wrote a regular column), and was also a regular contributor to the &quot;Western Morning News&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
In his youth Townsend enjoyed tennis and skiing, and later he represented the House of Commons in these sports. He sang in the choir at Tavistock church.

In 1976 Townsend married Anita Walshe, with whom he had two sons, Hugh and John.

Townsend died at his home in Chillaton aged 75. He had been suffering from leukaemia.

<text>A Hakka walled village () is a large multi-family communal living structure that is designed to be easily defensible. This building style is unique to the Hakka people found in southern China. Walled villages are typically designed for defensive purposes and consist of one entrance and no windows at the ground level.

==History==
The Hakka were originally immigrants from northern China who settled in the southern provinces. From the 17th century onwards, population pressures drove them more and more into conflict with their neighbours (called &quot;punti&quot; in Cantonese). As rivalry for resources turned to armed warfare, the Hakka began building communal living structures designed to be easily defensible. These houses, sometimes called &quot;tulou&quot; 土楼, were often round in shape and internally divided into many compartments for food storage, living quarters, ancestral temple, armoury etc. The largest houses covered over and it is not unusual to find surviving houses of over .

==Features==

Hakka walled villages can be constructed from brick, stone, or rammed earth, with the last being the most common. The external wall is typically in thickness and the entire building could be up to three or four stories in height. Often turrets were also built to extend the range of defensive power and to cover otherwise indefensible points. Battlements were also constructed on the top floor for muskets. The gate was the most vulnerable point and it was usually reinforced with stone and covered with iron. A number of smaller gates followed, in case the outer one was breached. With the exception of a few exceptionally large forts, Hakka houses usually only had one entrance. The round shape of the walls, which became popular in later stages, added to the defensive value of the fortifications and reduced the firepower of artillery against it. A Hakka fort could withstand a protracted siege, since it was well stocked with grains and had an internal source of water. They often also had their own sophisticated sewage systems.

The architectural style of Hakka forts is unique in China and around the world. The typical Chinese house contains a courtyard and, other than pagodas, does not often contain any structures higher than two stories.

Researchers note similarity between some of the walled villages and some ancient fortifications in southern China, as seen in Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms tomb models unearthed in Guangzhou, Guangdong and in Ezhou, Hubei.

==Tulou==
The Hakkas who settled in mountainous south western Fujian province in China developed unique architectural buildings called &quot;tulou&quot;, literally meaning &quot;earthen structures&quot;. The Hakkas set up these unique homes to prevent attack from bandits and marauders. The &quot;tulou&quot; are either round or square, and were designed as a large fortress and apartment building in one. Structures typically had only one entranceway and no windows at ground level. Each floor served a different function - the first hosts a well and livestock, the second is for food storage and the third and higher floors contain living spaces. &quot;Tulou&quot; can be found mostly in south western Fujian and southern Jiangxi provinces.
Tulou buildings have been inscribed in 2008 by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

==Guangdong==
The largest communities of Hakkas live mostly in eastern Guangdong, particularly in Xing-Mei (Xingning-Meixian), whereas most of the other Hakkas come from Huizhou. Unlike their kin in Fujian, the Hakkas in Xingning (兴宁, Hin Nin) and Meixian (梅县, Moi Yen) developed non-fortress-like architectural styles, typified most notably by the weilongwu () and sijiaolou ().

==Jiangxi==
There are about 500 Hakka walled villages in the southern part of Jiangxi province; some 370 of them are in Longnan County. They are known locally as &quot;weiwu&quot; () or &quot;wei&quot; ().

<text>Brighton Le Sands (formerly Brighton-le-Sands and also known simply as Brighton or Brighton Beach), is a suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Brighton Le Sands is located 13 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district, on the western shore of Botany Bay. Brighton Le Sands is in the local government area of the Bayside Council and is part of the St George area.

Lady Robinsons Beach and Cook Park run along the eastern border of Brighton Le Sands, on Botany Bay. The beach is also commonly referred to as Brighton Beach and is known for its off-white sand. Brighton Le Sands features a mixture of low density houses, medium density flats, high rise apartments, retail, cafés and restaurants. The Grand Parade runs along the foreshore and intersects with Bay Street, at the commercial centre. The higher density developments are located along these roads.

==History==
The area between the Cooks River and Georges River was originally known as Seven Mile Beach. It was changed to Lady Robinsons Beach in 1874 to honour Governor Sir Hercules Robinson&#x27;s wife. Cook Park, established in about 1882, is a strip of reserve land 30 metres inland from the high water mark of the sea. The park is named after Samuel Cook who advocated it as a public pleasure area. The name Seven Mile Beach was last used in the Sydney Morning Herald on 28 February 1879, whilst the first use of the name Lady Robinson&#x27;s Beach by the same newspaper was on 1 June 1877.

New Brighton was the name given to his new housing estate by tramway pioneer Thomas Saywell, who had plans to emulate the famous seaside resort Brighton in England. Land acquisitions began in the 1840s but no significant development of Brighton Le Sands occurred until the railway opened to Hurstville, via Rockdale in 1884. In 1885 Thomas Saywell constructed a tramway from Rockdale to Lady Robinsons Beach, along Bay Street. He was given a 30-year lease on the line. Thomas Saywell also financed and built the public swimming baths, a substantial picnic area called the Shady Nook Recreational Park (1898–1918), a race course and the Brighton Hotel, on the current Novotel site. The developments were a huge success. To avoid confusion with the English Brighton, the district became known as Brighton-le-Sands. From 1900, the tramway was electrified. The tramway passed into government ownership in 1914. The line was closed in September 1949, as the Sydney tramway system was slowly wound down. A bus route replaced the tram route.

Brighton Baths attracted a large number of Sydney&#x27;s weekend holidaymakers. The racecourse operated from about 1897 to 1911. The baths were also popular with punters who could cool off after a stressful day at the races.

Brighton Hotel was stripped of its licence in 1892 due to violence and reckless behaviour that found expression in the hotel and its surrounding area. The depression of the 1890s meant that many unemployed workers lived in the district and frequented the hotel, leading to a crisis for the area. The area several kilometres north of the hotel was used during the depression as one of many shanty sites that spread across Sydney, especially in the 1930s. Thomas Saywell offered the use of the hotel to The Scots College. Albert Aspinall, brother of the first Principal, Arthur Ashworth Aspinall, transformed the ground floor of the building to classrooms and the hotel rooms into the dormitory. In 1895, the principal of the college, Arthur Aspinall, decided to transfer the Scots College to Bellevue Hill. This was to avoid both the proximity of the local racecourse and the distraction the nearby beach was having on his students.

By 1900, there were pleasure grounds south of Bay Street, as well as a pony racetrack. Development of the land south of Bay Street for housing began before World War I [Post Office Directories]. Extensive development of the northern area of the suburb occurred after World War I, in the late 1920s and again in the 1950s. For the first 20 years of the 20th century, a small boat ran a ferry service around Botany Bay, with an important stop at Brighton Le Sands. In 1966 a freak storm hit the coastline, destroying the baths and much of the beach. The expansion of Sydney Airport and Port Botany involved dredging sand from the bay and disrupted sedimentary sand flows. This caused serious damage to the area. Beach restoration projects have attempted to restore the damage done to the coastline in recent years.

==Commercial area==

The main shopping precinct is located along Bay Street and extends to the foreshore on The Grand Parade and down a short length of Moate Avenue. The landmark Novotel Hotel Brighton Beach, located on north-western corner of the intersection of Bay Street and The Grand Parade, also contains a significant amount of commercial and retail space. Many cafés and restaurants are located along The Grand Parade and Bay Street, covering many types of cuisine: Australian, Greek, French, European, Italian, Thai and Japanese. Take-away food shops are also abundant, particularly for seafood, chicken, cakes and gelato. Shops and services include supermarket, banks, post office, clothing, jewellery, hair dressers, doctors and fishing supplies.

The appearance of a Coles supermarket in Moate Avenue in the late 1990s decimated some of the smaller specialty shops. It also competed with the existing Flemings supermarket for two years before the latter closed and in 2005 the local family-run fruit store also folded. The supermarket is part of a high-rise residential development and the incorporation of a car park was a requirement for Coles to be allowed to trade from this site. Developments to the area are planned as part of a multimillion-dollar upgrade called &quot;Destinations Rockdale&quot;.

==Transport==
There is a two kilometre bus service available to link with Rockdale railway station, which forces a lot of residents to catch a lengthy bus ride to Rockdale station. Transit Systems operates all the routes that pass by Brighton Le Sands. Route 303 runs from Sans Souci to Randwick via Brighton-le-Sands and Mascot. Route 478 runs from Westfield Miranda to Rockdale railway station via Ramsgate and Brighton Le Sands. Route 479 runs from Rockdale Plaza via Rockdale railway station to Kyeemagh and Brighton-Le-Sands.

Historically, starting in 1903, a weekend ferry service connected Brighton-le-Sands, Kurnell, Sans Souci, and La Perouse.

==Culture==

===Entertainment===
Brighton Le Sands is a popular location for multicultural cuisine and night-time entertainment. The area has been dubbed &#x27;Little Greece by the Bay&#x27; for its many Greek cafés, restaurants and businesses, including on the beach side of The Grand Parade, overlooking the sand and the boardwalk.

It was the centre of celebrations after Greece won the Euro 2004 Football (soccer) Cup. Bay Street was also closed at night and a large screen erected during the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics, however this proved less popular and wasn&#x27;t repeated for future sporting events.

===Attractions===

Brighton Le Sands is the site of the Bicentennial Monument which stands in Cook Park, on the Botany Bay foreshore. It commemorates the arrival of the First Fleet in Botany Bay in 1788.

The Greek Australian Sports Hall of Fame was established to commemorate the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics. It was originally housed in the old Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol building on The Grande Parade close to the intersection of Bay Street, but was moved further south, when this building was demolished in 2008. A statue of 1896 Greek gold medallist Spyros Louis also stands nearby in Cook Park.

A shared paved walkway and cycleway runs the length of Cook Park from Kyeemagh to Sandringham (approximately 7 kilometres) and is popular with both walkers, joggers and cyclists especially on weekends. For cyclists it provides access to the Homebush Bay Cycle route (North from Kyeemagh), and the Cronulla to Kurnell cycleway via the Captain Cook Bridge (South), and also forms part of the Sydney Coastal Walk.

Every New Year&#x27;s Eve, Bayside Council holds a popular family fireworks display over the water at 9pm which attracts tens of thousands of visitors to Brighton Beach.

===Notable residents===
* Michael Dransfield, poet, grew up in Brighton Le Sands
* June Salter, actress, grew up in Brighton Le Sands and was educated at the local primary school

==Population==

According to the 2021 Australian Census of population, there were 8,336 residents in Brighton Le Sands. 51.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Greece (5.0%), Egypt (2.7%), Brazil (2.5%), England (1.6%), and Lebanon (1.6%). 45.1% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek (12.1%), Arabic (6.6%), Spanish (3.8%), Portuguese (3.1%), and Macedonian (2.4%). The most common responses for religion were Catholic (24.4%), Eastern Orthodox (21.9%) and No Religion (18.1%).

Brighton Le Sands attracts many young and single residents to the suburb with its beach and entertainment lifestyle. It is known for its large Greek-Australian community which is reflected in many of the businesses.

==Politics==
Brighton Le Sands is in Ward 5 of the local government area of the City of Rockdale, the federal government division of Barton and state government Electoral district of Rockdale. The local government area City of Rockdale has merged with City of Botany Bay to become &quot;Bayside&quot;.

==Storm damage==
Several times the bridge over Muddy Creek at Bestic Street has flooded to the extent of making it impassable, or even washing the bridge away. Similar problems arose for the bridge over the creek at Bay Street. The floods were particularly bad when water cascading down the hills on the two streets coincided with a high tide in the creek.

Wind storms would deposit sand on The Grand Parade and The Esplanade making them impassable and eroding the sand dunes. Periodically wave damage would erode the beach. The worst damage to the beach occurred on 13 June 1966 (&quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, 15 June 1966).

==Brighton Le Sands Primary School==
The initial school building, opened in 1917, was located on the west side of Crawford Road between Kurnell Street and Kings Road. As the population of the suburb increased land was resumed further south on Crawford Road, between Kings Road and O&#x27;Neill Street, on which two buildings were constructed in the 1930s: an infants&#x27; school to cater for the first three years of schooling and the main upper primary school.

==Medical services==

The Pacific Private Hospital was located initially on The Esplanade. By 1930 the hospital had relocated to Queens Road. Bigger facilities were built on the south east corner of the intersection of Bay Street and West Botany Street by 1936.

A private convalescent hospital, &quot;East Lynn&quot; run by Matron Maudie Shaw, opened at 13 Henson Street in the mid-1930s soon after the extension of Henson Street past Reading Road. Matron Shaw&#x27;s husband was in the Royal Australian Navy. Many of the patients were overseas sailors recuperating from illness or accidents. These sailors were waiting until they were well enough to return home or to rejoin their ships when the ships were next in port. By the 1950s the number of sailors needing convalescence had reduced greatly. The hospital now catered to a wider range of needs within the local population. Matron Shaw retired in the 1960s.

By 1925, a doctors surgery had been opened on the south west corner of the intersection of Crawford Road with Bay Street.

<text>Laḫmu ( or , d laḫ-mu, ) is a class of apotropaic creatures from Mesopotamian mythology. While the name has its origin in a Semitic language, Lahmu was present in Sumerian sources in pre-Sargonic times already.

== Iconography and character ==
Laḫmu is depicted as a bearded man wearing a red garment (&quot;tillû&quot;) Some texts mention a spade as the attribute of Lahmu. The artistic representations are sometimes called &quot;naked heroes&quot; in literature.

Lahmu were associated with water. They were generally believed to be servants of Enki/Ea (and later on of his son Marduk as well), and were described as the doorkeepers of his temple in Eridu and possibly as the &quot;guardians of the sea&quot; known from some versions of the &quot;Atra-Hasis&quot;. Some texts list as many as 50 Lahmu in such roles. It&#x27;s possible they were initially river spirits believed to take care of domestic and wild animals.

Apotropaic creatures such as Lahmu weren&#x27;t regarded as demonic; they protected the household from demons. However, myths may depict them as defeated and subsequently reformed enemies of the gods. At the same time, they weren&#x27;t viewed as fully divine, as their names were rarely if ever, preceded by the dingir sign (&quot;divine determinative&quot;) and they do not wear horned tiaras (a symbol of divinity) in art.

In apotropaic rituals, Lahmu was associated with other monsters, for example mušḫuššu, bašmu (a type of mythical snake), kusarikku (bison-men associated with Shamash) or Ugallu.

== As a cosmological being ==
In god lists, a singular Lahmu sometimes appears among the ancestors of Anu alongside a feminine counterpart (Lahamu), following the primordial pair Duri and Dari (eternity) and other such figures and preceding Alala and Belili. Assyriolgist Frans Wiggermann, who specializes in the study of origins and development of Mesopotamian apotropaic creatures and demons, assumes that this tradition had its origin in Upper Mesopotamia. Lahmu and Lahamu aren&#x27;t necessarily siblings in this context. Long lists of divine ancestors of Enlil or Anu from some god lists were at least sometimes meant to indicate that the gods worshiped by the Mesopotamians weren&#x27;t the product of incestuous relationships. Wilfred G. Lambert wrote, &quot;The history of these two [theogonies] shows that steps were sometimes taken quite specifically to avoid the implication of incest, which was socially taboo.&quot;

In the &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot;, compiled at a later date and relying on the tradition mentioned above, Lahmu is the first-born son of Abzu and Tiamat. He and his sister Laḫamu are the parents of Anshar and Kishar, parents of Anu and thus ancestors of Ea and Marduk according to this specific theogony. Both of them bestow 3 names upon Marduk after his victory. However, Lahmu - presumably of the same variety as the apotropaic rather than cosmological one - also appears among Tiamat&#x27;s monsters.

A fragmentary Assyrian rewrite of Enuma Elish replaced Marduk with Ashur, equated with Anshar, with Lahmu and Lahamu replacing Ea/Enki and Damkina. Wilfred G. Lambert described the result as &quot;completely superficial in that it leaves the plot in chaos by attributing Marduk&#x27;s part to his great-grandfather, without making any attempt to iron out the resulting confusion.&quot;

== Disproven theories ==

19th and early 20th century authors asserted that Lahmu represents the zodiac, parent stars, or constellations.

<doc id="939118" wikidata="Q2088330" url="?curid=939118" title="Ashnan">
<text>Ashnan or Ezina (d; both possible readings are used interchangeably) was a Mesopotamian goddess considered to be the personification of grain. She could also be called Ezina-Kusu, which led to the proposal that the goddess Kusu was initially her epithet which only developed into a distinct figure later on. She was already worshiped in the Uruk period, and appears in documents from many Mesopotamian cities from the third millennium BCE. She is also known from various works of Mesopotamian literature, such as the debate poem &quot;Debate between Sheep and Grain&quot;.

==Names and character==
The logogram dŠE.TIR can be read as both Ezina and Ashnan. According to Jeremy Black, both are used interchangeably to refer to the same deity in modern publications. Frank Simons argues the latter can be understood as the &quot;Akkadianised version&quot; of Ezina. The Sumerian word &quot;ezina&quot; was also a common noun referring to grain. The Akkadian &quot;ašnan&quot; could be interpreted the same way. However, the precise etymology of both is uncertain. The goddess designated by these names was associated with grain and agriculture. Early on in her history, she was a major deity, but in later periods she was simply perceived as the divine hypostasis of grain. In addition to her primary role, she could be invoked alongside Nintur to stop post-natal bleeding.

It is possible that in art, Ashnan was depicted as a goddess surrounded by grain-like plants. In some cases this figure is depicted seated on a throne. 

===Ezina-Kusu===
The compound theonym Ezina-Kusu, which combines the names of Ezina and Kusu, a purification goddess, is well attested. The Akkadian form Ashnan-Kusu is also used in scholarship. It already appears in sources from the Early Dynastic period. In most texts, it seemingly designates a deity analogous to Ezina, for example an inscription on one of the Gudea cylinders states that &quot;Ezina-Kusu, the pure stalk, will raise its head high in the furrows in Gu-edina,&quot; while &quot;The Debate between Sheep and Grain&quot; uses the double name interchangeably with that of the grain goddess. Frank Simons has suggested that Kusu was not a distinct goddess at first, but rather an epithet, and only developed into a separate figure at a later date. However, it has also been argued that Kusu treated as an epithet was not related to the purification goddess, and should be understood as a generic appellation, &quot;goddess filled with purity.&quot; Ezina-Kusu is also attested as an epithet referring to Nisaba and Aruru in their respective vegetation-related roles.

==Worship==
The Mesopotamian grain goddess was already worshiped in the Uruk period. According to the &quot;Archaic City List&quot;, a settlement named after her existed somewhere in Mesopotamia, though the reading of its full name remains unknown. She is one of the oldest attested city goddesses, with Nisaba, Nanshe, Inanna of Uruk and Inanna of Zabalam being the only other ones present in texts of comparable age. In one of the Early Dynastic &quot;Zame Hymns&quot;, her city is instead AB×ŠUŠ (U2), but the reading of this name also remains unknown. She is also present in the Fara and Abu Salabikh god lists. She was worshiped in Lagash, Adab, Umma, Ur, Nippur and Shuruppak. Joan Goodnick Westenholz suggested that in Nippur she was worshiped in the temple of Kusu, which according to Andrew R. George likely bore the name Esaĝĝamaḫ, &quot;house of the exalted purifier.&quot; Alfonso Archi notes that she also occurs in a bilingual lexical list from Ebla, which gives the equation &quot;dAšnan = A-za-na-an&quot;, but she is absent from the administrative texts from this city. Theophoric names invoking her are known from various sources from the third millennium BCE. For example, multiple individuals named Amar-Ashnan (&quot;young bull of Ashnan&quot;) appear in texts from Adab from the Early Dynastic and Sargonic periods. The same name, as well as other ones, such as Ashnan-amamu (&quot;Ashnan is my mother&quot;), are also attested in texts from Lagash.

A formula from the reign of Ishme-Dagan refers to Ezina, Enki, Ishkur and Šumugan as the &quot;lords of abundance&quot; (&quot;en ḫegallakene&quot;). The name Ashnan appears in a curse formula of Yahdun-Lim of Mari, in which she is invoked alongside Šumugan to punish anyone who would remove this king&#x27;s foundation deposits by impoverishing his land. Some attestations of Ashnan are available from the corpus of Old Babylonian personal letters as well, where she appears with comparable frequency to Bau or Nisaba, though less often than the most popular goddesses, such as Ishtar, Annunitum or Aya. Seals inscribed with the formula &quot;servant of Ashnan&quot; or &quot;servant of Ezina&quot; are known too.

==Mythology==
The debate poem &quot;Debate between Sheep and Grain&quot; involves Ashnan arguing with Laḫar (U8), a sheep deity, over which of them is more important. The text begins with an account of creation, which relays that both of them were created because mankind had no food to eat and no clothes to wear. Both Ashnan and Laḫar raise many arguments in favor of their respective claim to superiority, but eventually Enki convinces Enlil to declare the grain goddess the winner, which according to Jeremy Black might reflect the belief that grain was more crucial for survival of mankind than domestic animals were.

An Early Dynastic myth, &quot;Tale of Ezina and her Seven Children&quot;, is known from multiple copies, and apparently relays how the eponymous goddess, after having sex with a partner whose identity remains uncertain, gives birth to seven children, who seemingly were responsible with providing the world with some type of food which was previously unknown, presumably bread. Julia M. Asher-Greve proposes that a goddess with plants on her robe who in one case accompanies the possible enthroned depiction of Ezina represents one of her seven children from this myth.

Ezina is mentioned in the myth &quot;Enki and the World Order&quot;, in which she is called &quot;the good bread of the whole world.&quot;

An incantation recited during the renovation of a temple lists Ashnan among deities created by Ea from clay.

<doc id="939131" wikidata="Q942068" url="?curid=939131" title="Linea alba (abdomen)">
<text>The linea alba (Latin for: white line) is a strong fibrous midline structure of the anterior abdominal wall situated between the two recti abdominis muscles (one on either side). The umbilicus (navel) is present on the linea alba through which foetal umbilical vessels pass before birth. The linea alba is formed by the union of aponeuroses (of the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall) that collectively make up the rectus sheath. The linea alba attaches to the xiphoid process superiorly, and to the pubic symphysis inferiorly. It is narrow inferiorly where the two recti abdominis muscles are in contact with each other posterior to it, and broadens superior-ward from just inferior to the umbilicus.

The name means &quot;white line&quot; as it is composed mostly of collagen connective tissue, which has a white appearance.

In sufficiently muscular individuals, its presence can be seen on the skin, forming the depression between the left and right halves of a &quot;six pack&quot;.

== Function ==
The linea alba stabilizes the anterior abdominal wall, as it balances contractile forces from the muscles attached to it.

== Clinical significance ==
An abnormal widening of the linea alba is known as diastasis recti.

During pregnancy, the linea alba usually darkens due to hormonal changes whereupon it becomes known as the linea nigra. The linea nigra sometimes also occurs in either sex outside the context of pregnancy.

A median incision through the linea alba is a common surgical approach for abdominal surgery. This is because it consists of mostly connective tissue, and does not contain any primary nerves or blood vessels.

<doc id="939133" wikidata="Q6453666" url="?curid=939133" title="Modular programming">
<text>Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect or &quot;concern&quot; of the desired functionality.

A module interface expresses the elements that are provided and required by the module. The elements defined in the interface are detectable by other modules. The implementation contains the working code that corresponds to the elements declared in the interface. Modular programming is closely related to structured programming and object-oriented programming, all having the same goal of facilitating construction of large software programs and systems by decomposition into smaller pieces, and all originating around the 1960s. While the historical usage of these terms has been inconsistent, &quot;modular programming&quot; now refers to the high-level decomposition of the code of an entire program into pieces: structured programming to the low-level code use of structured control flow, and object-oriented programming to the &quot;data&quot; use of objects, a kind of data structure.

In object-oriented programming, the use of interfaces as an architectural pattern to construct modules is known as interface-based programming.

==History==
Modular programming, in the form of subsystems (particularly for I/O) and software libraries, dates to early software systems, where it was used for code reuse. Modular programming per se, with a goal of modularity, developed in the late 1960s and 1970s, as a larger-scale analog of the concept of structured programming (1960s). The term &quot;modular programming&quot; dates at least to the National Symposium on Modular Programming, organized at the Information and Systems Institute in July 1968 by Larry Constantine; other key concepts were information hiding (1972) and separation of concerns (SoC, 1974).

Modules were not included in the original specification for ALGOL 68 (1968), but were included as extensions in early implementations, ALGOL 68-R (1970) and ALGOL 68C (1970), and later formalized. One of the first languages designed from the start for modular programming was the short-lived Modula (1975), by Niklaus Wirth. Another early modular language was Mesa (1970s), by Xerox PARC, and Wirth drew on Mesa as well as the original Modula in its successor, Modula-2 (1978), which influenced later languages, particularly through its successor, Modula-3 (1980s). Modula&#x27;s use of dot-qualified names, like codice_1 to refer to object codice_2 from module codice_3, coincides with notation to access a field of a record (and similarly for attributes or methods of objects), and is now widespread, seen in C++, C#, Dart, Go, Java, OCaml, and Python, among others. Modular programming became widespread from the 1980s: the original Pascal language (1970) did not include modules, but later versions, notably UCSD Pascal (1978) and Turbo Pascal (1983) included them in the form of &quot;units&quot;, as did the Pascal-influenced Ada (1980). The Extended Pascal ISO 10206:1990 standard kept closer to Modula2 in its modular support. Standard ML (1984) has one of the most complete module systems, including functors (parameterized modules) to map between modules.

In the 1980s and 1990s, modular programming was overshadowed by and often conflated with object-oriented programming, particularly due to the popularity of C++ and Java. For example, the C family of languages had support for objects and classes in C++ (originally C with Classes, 1980) and Objective-C (1983), only supporting modules 30 years or more later. Java (1995) supports modules in the form of packages, though the primary unit of code organization is a class. However, Python (1991) prominently used both modules and objects from the start, using modules as the primary unit of code organization and &quot;packages&quot; as a larger-scale unit; and Perl 5 (1994) includes support for both modules and objects, with a vast array of modules being available from CPAN (1993). OCaml (1996) followed ML by supporting modules and functors.

Modular programming is now widespread, and found in virtually all major languages developed since the 1990s. The relative importance of modules varies between languages, and in class-based object-oriented languages there is still overlap and confusion with classes as a unit of organization and encapsulation, but these are both well-established as distinct concepts.

==Terminology==
The term assembly (as in .NET languages like C#, F# or Visual Basic .NET) or package (as in Dart, Go or Java) is sometimes used instead of module. In other implementations, these are distinct concepts; in Python a package is a collection of modules, while in Java 9 the introduction of the new module concept (a collection of packages with enhanced access control) was implemented.

Furthermore, the term &quot;package&quot; has other uses in software (for example .NET NuGet packages). A component is a similar concept, but typically refers to a higher level; a component is a piece of a whole system, while a module is a piece of an individual program. The scale of the term &quot;module&quot; varies significantly between languages; in Python it is very small-scale and each file is a module, while in Java 9 it is planned to be large-scale, where a module is a collection of packages, which are in turn collections of files.

Other terms for modules include unit, used in Pascal dialects.

==Language support==
Languages that formally support the module concept include Ada, ALGOL, BlitzMax, C++, C#, Clojure, COBOL, Common Lisp, D, Dart, eC, Erlang, Elixir, Elm, F, F#, Fortran, Go, Haskell, IBM/360 Assembler, Control Language (CL), IBM RPG, Java, Julia, MATLAB, ML, Modula, Modula-2, Modula-3, Morpho, NEWP, Oberon, Oberon-2, Objective-C, OCaml, several Pascal derivatives (Component Pascal, Object Pascal, Turbo Pascal, UCSD Pascal), Perl, PHP, PL/I, PureBasic, Python, R, Ruby, Rust, JavaScript, Visual Basic (.NET) and WebDNA.

Conspicuous examples of languages that lack support for modules are C and have been C++ and Pascal in their original form, C and C++ do, however, allow separate compilation and declarative interfaces to be specified using header files. Modules were added to Objective-C in iOS 7 (2013); to C++ with C++20, and Pascal was superseded by Modula and Oberon, which included modules from the start, and various derivatives that included modules. JavaScript has had native modules since ECMAScript 2015.

Modular programming can be performed even where the programming language lacks explicit syntactic features to support named modules, like, for example, in C. This is done by using existing language features, together with, for example, coding conventions, programming idioms and the physical code structure. IBM i also uses modules when programming in the Integrated Language Environment (ILE).

==Key aspects==
With modular programming, concerns are separated such that modules perform logically discrete functions, interacting through well-defined interfaces. Often modules form a directed acyclic graph (DAG); in this case a cyclic dependency between modules is seen as indicating that these should be a single module. In the case where modules do form a DAG they can be arranged as a hierarchy, where the lowest-level modules are independent, depending on no other modules, and higher-level modules depend on lower-level ones. A particular program or library is a top-level module of its own hierarchy, but can in turn be seen as a lower-level module of a higher-level program, library, or system.

When creating a modular system, instead of creating a monolithic application (where the smallest component is the whole), several smaller modules are written separately so when they are composed together, they construct the executable application program. Typically, these are also compiled separately, via separate compilation, and then linked by a linker. A just-in-time compiler may perform some of this construction &quot;on-the-fly&quot; at run time.

These independent functions are commonly classified as either program control functions or specific task functions. Program control functions are designed to work for one program. Specific task functions are closely prepared to be applicable for various programs. 

This makes modular designed systems, if built correctly, far more reusable than a traditional monolithic design, since all (or many) of these modules may then be reused (without change) in other projects. This also facilitates the &quot;breaking down&quot; of projects into several smaller projects. Theoretically, a modularized software project will be more easily assembled by large teams, since no team members are creating the whole system, or even need to know about the system as a whole. They can focus just on the assigned smaller task.

She received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the chemistry between Rao and Mahesh Babu. Radhika Rajamani for Rediff.com noted, &quot;Amrita Rao, who makes her debut in Telugu films, makes a mark.&quot; &quot;Moviebuzz&quot; for Sify wrote, &quot;Amrita Rao is not only beautiful but also glamorous. She has proved that she could be yet another native girl of Tollywood. She emoted well with convincing histrionics fit for the Telugu screen.&quot;

Rao had two major releases in 2008: drama &quot;My Name Is Anthony Gonsalves&quot; opposite newcomer Nikhil Dwivedi, and Shyam Benegal&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Welcome to Sajjanpur&quot;. &quot;My Name Is Anthony Gonsalves&quot; received overwhelmingly negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office. Rao&#x27;s performance as an orphan who lives a middle-class lifestyle was praised by a few critics; OneIndia Entertainment noted, &quot;Amrita Rao looks gorgeous, but her role isn&#x27;t substantial enough.&quot; In &quot;Welcome to Sajjanpur&quot;, Rao played the role of Kamala, a woman who is desperate for communication from her husband Bansiram (Kunal Kapoor), a laborer at a dockyard in Mumbai. Successful in creating an impact at the box office, the film obtained positive reviews from critics and earned , making it the second-highest-grossing film in Rao&#x27;s career. &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; noted, &quot;Amrita Rao is sweetness personified.&quot; She received the Stardust Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film.

Rao made her debut as a Judge with the 2009 television show &quot;Perfect Bride&quot;. She Judged the show alongside Shekhar Suman and Malaika Arora. She next starred with Harman Baweja in the 2009 film &quot;Victory&quot;. The film faced competition from other films such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Dev.D&quot; and failed to do well. With a huge budget, it only managed to gross and was declared a disaster by &quot;Boxoffice-India&quot;. That same year, Rao took on the lead role in Neeraj Vora&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Short Kut: The Con is On&quot; opposite Akshaye Khanna, produced by Anil Kapoor. The film stars Rao as Mansi, the girlfriend of Akshaye&#x27;s character. Critical response towards the film and Rao&#x27;s performance received negative reviews: &quot;The Indian Express&quot;&#x27;s Shubhra Gupta noted: &quot;Everything is loud and plastic, and the actors all chant their lines at the top of their voices.&quot; Gaurav Malini of &quot;The Times of India&quot; stated, &quot;Amrita Rao tries too hard to look hot but lacks oomph in every possible angle&quot;. Though having grossed its budget back, it was considered a financial disappointment.

Rao&#x27;s only film of 2011 was &quot;Love U...Mr. Kalakaar!&quot; and her second collaboration with Rajshri Productions. The movie generated mostly negative reviews and emerged as a commercial failure. Though, her performance as the daughter of a businessman was praised by the critics. Nikhat Kazmi of &quot;The Times of India&quot; wrote, &quot;Amrita Rao at best, but the film is so predictable and so long, it loses impact&quot;. In later years, Rao made special appearances in comedy-drama &quot;Heyy Babyy&quot; (2007), romantic-comedy &quot;Life Partner&quot; (2007), and science fiction romance &quot;Jaane Kahan Se Aayi Hai&quot; (2010).

In 2013, Rao starred in the national award-winning, courtroom, comedy-drama &quot;Jolly LLB&quot;. She played the lead role of Sandhya, the girlfriend of Arshad Warsi&#x27;s character. The film received positive reviews and won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. Rao with limited performance in the film received average applause. Mohar Basu of &quot;Koimoi&quot; commented, &quot;Amrita Rao could have been avoided in the film altogether. Though she is immensely pleasant, she and her role have nothing to contribute to the film&quot;.

Anil Sharma&#x27;s action drama &quot;Singh Saab the Great&quot; was her next release. Co-starring alongside Sunny Deol, Rao played a journalist Shikha Chaturvedi. The film was largely panned by critics but Rao&#x27;s performance earned positive reviews. Namrata Joshi of Outlook said, &quot;Amrita Rao plays a role that feels like something she has already done, all the emotional support&quot;. The film received predominately negative reviews, nevertheless was an above-average grosser at the box office with revenues of . Later that year, she appeared alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor, Arjun Rampal, and Manoj Bajpai in Prakash Jha&#x27;s political drama &quot;Satyagraha&quot;. Rao played the role of Sumitra, the daughter-in-law of Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s character. Rao was praised in particular; Resham Sengar of &quot;Zee News&quot; wrote, &quot;Ms. Rao has the sweetly cherubic looks. She is convincing in most of the emotional scenes. But again, her scope of performance is just limited to mouthing a few important dialogues.&quot; The film was poorly received by critics and failed to make a profit at the box office. Despite having moderate reviews, the film grossed over at the domestic box office.

Rao made her television acting debut in 2016 with &amp;TV&#x27;s &quot;Meri Awaaz Hi Pehchaan Hai&quot; portraying the elder sister Kalyani Gaikwad. The story showed three generations of two sisters whose lives revolve around music. Her character&#x27;s older version was played by Deepti Naval.

After a five-year absence from the screen, Rao played leading role in Abhijit Panse&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;Thackeray&quot;, a biopic based on a right-wing pro-Marathi politician Balasaheb Thackeray. Rao played the role of Meena Thackeray, wife of Balasaheb Thackeray. The film as well as Rao received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Shilpa Jamkhandikar of &quot;Reuters&quot; wrote, &quot;Amrita Rao, who plays Thackeray&#x27;s wife, has the cosmetic role of providing endless cups of tea to visitors and gaze at her husband dotingly&quot;.

Rao will next reprise Sandhya in &quot;Jolly LLB 3&quot; opposite Arshad Warsi. The film marks her return to cinema after six years hiatus.

== Personal life ==
After seven years of dating, Rao married her boyfriend, Anmol Sood, a Radio Jockey on 15 May 2016 in Mumbai. She gave birth to a baby boy, Veer on 1 November 2020. In February 2023, the couple launched their book &quot;Couple of Things&quot;, and they own a YouTube channel with the same name.

== In the media ==
Rao has been part of many successful films and is often cited by the media as Bollywood&#x27;s &quot;quintessential girl-next-door&quot;. In the Times&#x27; Most Desirable Women list, she was placed 24th in 2009 and 23rd in 2011. Kalwyna Rathod of &quot;Femina&quot; termed Rao a &quot;darling of the audience&quot;.

&quot;Vivah&quot; is termed as a significant success in Rao&#x27;s career and is noted among her best roles. &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; placed her and Shahid Kapoor in its list of the top 10 best romantic couples of the decade. M. F. Husain pronounced Rao as his second muse, 11 years after he painted Madhuri Dixit and made several paintings dedicated to the actress&#x27;s role in &quot;Vivah&quot; (2006). On her career, Rao said, &quot;I have done some unforgettable films that I believe will hold relevance for a very long time. Perhaps many newcomers today haven&#x27;t even seen the back-to-back success that I have seen right from the start of my career. My journey has been easy, yet difficult, because I had to carve my own path by trial and error. But the taste of being self-made is the sweetest.&quot; In 2023, Rao turned author, and published her memoir &quot;Couple of Things&quot;, along with her husband.

<text>The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour is an American music and comedy television variety show that was hosted by singer Glen Campbell from January 29, 1969, to June 13, 1972, on CBS. He was offered the show after he hosted a 1968 summer replacement for &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;. Campbell used &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; as the theme song of the show.

The show was one of the few shows with rural audience appeal to survive CBS&#x27;s so-called &quot;rural purge&quot; of 1971, a survival made more unusual because it had fallen out of the top 30 shows that season. Reruns of the show are in the library of free over-the-top services Pluto TV and Shout! Factory TV.

<doc id="939157" wikidata="Q2914838" url="?curid=939157" title="Abraham Foxman">
<text>Abraham Henry Foxman (born May 1, 1940) is an American lawyer and activist. He served as the national director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) from 1987 to 2015, and is currently the League&#x27;s national director emeritus. From 2016 to 2021 he served as vice chair of the board of trustees at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York City in order to lead its efforts on antisemitism.

==Early life==
Foxman, the only son of Helen and Joseph Foxman, was born in Baranovichi (now in Belarus) just months after the Soviet Union took the town from Poland in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and incorporated it into the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Foxman&#x27;s parents were Polish Jews.

To protect him, Foxman&#x27;s parents left him with his nanny, Bronisława Kurpi, a Catholic Pole, when they were ordered by the Germans to enter a ghetto in 1941. Foxman was baptized into Christianity by the Catholic Church, given the Polish Christian name of Henryk Stanisław Kurpi, and raised as a Catholic in Vilnius until he was returned to his parents in 1944.

==Education and career==

Foxman immigrated to the United States in 1950 with his parents. He graduated from the Yeshivah of Flatbush in Brooklyn, New York City. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the City College of New York and graduated with honors in history. Foxman also holds a J.D. degree from the New York University School of Law. He did graduate work in Jewish studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America and in international economics at The New School.

ADL legal representative Arnold Forster hired Foxman in 1965 as a legal assistant in the ADL&#x27;s international affairs division. In 1987, Foxman was the consensus choice of the Board to become its new National Director, replacing long-time director Nathan Perlmutter.

==Recognition==
Foxman has been awarded several honors from nonprofit groups, religious figures, and statesmen. In 1998, Foxman received the Interfaith Committee of Remembrance Lifetime Achievement Award &quot;as a leader in the fight against anti-Semitism, bigotry, and discrimination&quot;. Foxman won the Raoul Wallenberg Humanitarian Leadership Award on April 18, 2002, from the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Ramapo College of New Jersey.

On October 16, 2006, Foxman was named a Knight of the Legion of Honor by French President Jacques Chirac. This award is France&#x27;s highest civilian honor.

During a May 22, 2008, ceremony, Foxman was awarded an honorary doctoral degree from Yeshiva University by Richard Joel, the then-president of Yeshiva University.

Additionally, American President George W. Bush appointed Foxman to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of Israel in May 2008.

==Political stances==

===Support for gay rights===

Foxman&#x27;s support for gay rights in America has placed him at odds with many Orthodox Jews. For example, he protested the 2000 ruling by the Supreme Court in &quot;Boy Scouts of America v. Dale&quot;—a case in which &quot;the Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts of America could exclude a gay scoutmaster because of his sexual orientation.&quot; It was reported that, &quot;Within the Jewish community, Orthodox groups supported the ruling, saying civic organizations should be empowered to determine their own message - but most Jewish organizations condemned it as endorsing discrimination.&quot; According to a report published a year later, &quot;the Anti-Defamation League&#x27;s national director, Abraham Foxman, and its national chairman, Howard Berkowitz, said in a statement at the time: &#x27;We are stunned that in the year 2000, the Supreme Court could issue such a decision. ... This decision effectively states that as long as an organization avows an anti-homosexual position, it is free to discriminate against gay and lesbian Americans.&#x27;&quot;

===Criticism of Mel Gibson===

Foxman has received criticism from Jewish and non-Jewish quarters for his antagonist approach to the 2004 film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; and its director, Mel Gibson. In September 2003, during the pre-release controversy, Foxman called Gibson &quot;the portrait of an anti-Semite&quot;. The next day he said, &quot;I&#x27;m not ready to say he&#x27;s an anti-Semite&quot;, but that Gibson &quot;entertains views that can only be described as anti-Semitic&quot;. In November 2003, Foxman said of Gibson, &quot;I think he&#x27;s infected, seriously infected, with some very, very serious anti-Semitic views.&quot; Foxman was also criticized for his initial response to Gibson&#x27;s apology for his behavior during his 2006 DUI arrest, and for giving second billing to the Seattle Jewish Federation shooting that occurred on the same day. Foxman accepted Gibson&#x27;s second apology, although he continued to censure Gibson publicly, saying in 2008, &quot;In his heyday, he was No. 1 in Hollywood, the most sought-after star, the people&#x27;s choice, the icon. Then he revealed himself as an anti-Semite, and look where he is today. That&#x27;s the beauty of America.&quot;
Foxman continued to condemn Gibson for &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, saying in 2008, &quot;What he was doing was giving credibility, on film, in our lifetime, to deicide. Where is Mel Gibson today? He did his movie, and one day, he revealed himself to the American people. He&#x27;s no icon anymore.&quot;

===Opposition to a Congress resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide===
In July 2007, Foxman opposed a congressional resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide. &quot;I don&#x27;t think congressional action will help reconcile the issue. The resolution takes a position; it comes to a judgement&quot;, said Foxman in a statement issued to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. &quot;The Turks and Armenians need to revisit their past. The Jewish community shouldn&#x27;t be the arbiter of that history, nor should the U.S. Congress.&quot;

Sharistan Melkonian, chairwoman of the Armenian National Committee of Eastern Massachusetts, accused Foxman of engaging in &quot;genocide denial&quot; in an interview with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. Various New England communities threatened to sever ties with the ADL-sponsored &quot;No Place for Hate&quot; program in response. In August 2007, Foxman publicly affirmed the position of the Anti-Defamation League, &quot;that the consequences of [the Ottoman government&#x27;s] actions were indeed tantamount to genocide&quot;, but that a United States Congressional recognition of this history was unnecessary, and not helpful. He went on to state, &quot;We continue to firmly believe that a Congressional Resolution on such matters is a counterproductive diversion and will not foster reconciliation between Turks and Armenians. We will not hesitate to apply the term &#x27;genocide&#x27; in the future.&quot; Foxman additionally sent a letter to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressing regret over the difficulty his position caused for the government of Turkey: &quot;We had no intention to put the Turkish people or its leaders in a difficult position.&quot;

===Opposition to Park51===
Foxman opposed the Park51 Islamic community center near the World Trade Center site. Fareed Zakaria, a recipient of ADL&#x27;s Hubert H. Humphrey First Amendment Freedoms Prize, returned the prize and its $10,000 honorarium, saying that he &quot;cannot in good conscience hold onto the award or the honorarium that came with it&quot;. Zakaria has &quot;urged the ADL to reverse its decision&quot;.

<text>Messier 2 or M2 (also designated NGC 7089) is a globular cluster in the constellation Aquarius, five degrees north of the star Beta Aquarii. It was discovered by Jean-Dominique Maraldi in 1746, and is one of the largest known globular clusters.

==Discovery and Visibility==
M2 was discovered by the French astronomer Jean-Dominique Maraldi in 1746 while observing a comet with Jacques Cassini. Charles Messier rediscovered it in 1760, but thought that it is a nebula without any stars associated with it. William Herschel, in 1783, was the first to resolve individual stars in the cluster.

M2 is, under extremely good conditions, just visible to the naked eye. Binoculars or a small telescope will identify this cluster as non-stellar, while larger telescopes will resolve individual stars, of which the brightest are of apparent magnitude 6.5.

==Characteristics==

M2 is about 55,000 light-years distant from Earth. At 175 light-years in diameter, it is one of the larger globular clusters known. The cluster is rich, compact, and significantly elliptical. It is 12.5 billion years old and one of the older globular clusters associated with the Milky Way galaxy.

M2 contains about 150,000 stars, including 21 known variable stars. Its brightest stars are red and yellow giant stars. The overall spectral type is F4.
M2 is part of the Gaia Sausage, the hypothesized remains of a merged dwarf galaxy.

Data from &quot;Gaia&quot; has led to the discovery of an extended tidal stellar stream, about 45 degrees long and 300 light-years (100 pc) wide, that is likely associated with M2. It was possibly perturbed due to the presence of the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Messier 2 is located within our Milky Way galaxy, and is one of the oldest clusters of stars designated to the Milky Way. Like most globular clusters, M2 is found within the galactic halo, specifically in the southern galactic cap. This places it right below the southern pole of the Milky Way.

==Oosterhoff Classification==

M2 is defined as an Oosterhoff type II globular cluster. Oosterhoff type is a classification system of globular clusters originally observed by Pieter Oosterhoff in where globular clusters are generally separated into two types. Oosterhoff type is determined by metallicity, age, and average pulsation period of type ab RR Lyrae variable stars of the cluster. A cluster metallicity below −1.6, an age above 13 billion years, and an average RRab Lyrae pulsation period around .64 days indicates a type II cluster. This .64 day value, coupled with a metallicity of −1.65, provides evidence that M2 follows the Oosterhoff Gap phenomena. This is an observed gap in the grouping of type I and type II clusters in the Milky Way on a metallicity vs average RRab pulsation period plot.

M2 is a bit of an anomaly in reference to Oosterhoff type. While it satisfies the metallicity and RRab Lyrae pulsation period conditions, it actually has an age of 12.5 Gyr, well below the cutoff age of 13 Gyr normal for a Oosterhoff type II cluster. This is unexpected because age of a cluster is generally determined from metallicity. However, this abnormality is explained in an article by Marín-Franch.

<text>The Flotilla of Hope was a voyage by yacht carried out in 2004 by protesters critical of the Australian government&#x27;s asylum policy. Two boats, the &quot;Eureka&quot; and the &quot;One Off&quot;, sailed to Nauru, a Pacific island nation which is host to Australia&#x27;s offshore immigrant detention centre. They intended to deliver goods to those interned (most detainees are families who fled conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq), but were not allowed to land by the Nauruan government. Under an agreement put into effect earlier that year, Australia had taken responsibility for the island&#x27;s finances and civilian police force. Following the action, asylum was granted to over half the refugees on Nauru and Aladdin Salanin who was in solitary confinement on Manus Island, New Guinea was released.

Along the way to Nauru, the Flotillas docked at Santa Cruz, a far flung island of the Solomon Islands where they were met by the local indigenous people.
The Flotillas carried their cargo through the 12 mile No Go Zone and got to within 500 metres of Nauru coast until they were chased out by 6 Nauruan boats.

<text>Messier 7 or M7, also designated NGC 6475 and sometimes known as the Ptolemy Cluster, is an open cluster of stars in the constellation of Scorpius. The cluster is easily detectable with the naked eye, close to the &quot;stinger&quot; of Scorpius. With a declination of −34.8°, it is the southernmost Messier object.

M7 has been known since antiquity; it was first recorded by the 2nd-century Greek-Roman astronomer Ptolemy, who described it as a nebula in 130 AD. Italian astronomer Giovanni Batista Hodierna observed it before 1654 and counted 30 stars in it. In 1764, French astronomer Charles Messier catalogued the cluster as the seventh member in his list of comet-like objects. English astronomer John Herschel described it as &quot;coarsely scattered clusters of stars&quot;.

Telescopic observations of the cluster reveal about 80 stars within a field of view of 1.3° across. At the cluster&#x27;s estimated distance of 980 light years this corresponds to an actual diameter of 25 light years. The tidal radius of the cluster is and it has a combined mass of about 735 times the mass of the Sun. The age of the cluster is around 200 million years while the brightest member star is of magnitude 5.6. In terms of composition, the cluster contains a similar abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium as the Sun.

On August 29, 2006, Messier 7 was used for first light image of the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) telescope on the Pluto-bound New Horizons spacecraft.

As of January 2022, Messier 7 is one of the few remaining Messier objects not photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope. This is mainly due to those objects&#x27; angular diameter or lack of scientific significance. Most such objects are open clusters of large angular diameter that would require thousands of photos due to Hubble&#x27;s small field of view. (For comparison, Hubble&#x27;s well known panoramic photo of the Andromeda Galaxy, covering less than half of our galactic neighbor, required approximately 400 individual movements and 7400 exposures.)

<text>Messier 80 (also known as M80 or NGC 6093) is a globular cluster in the constellation Scorpius. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1781, being one of his first discoveries.

This star cluster is, as to its angle from the solar system, midway between α Scorpii (Antares) and β Scorpii in a field in the Milky Way Galaxy that is rich in nebulæ. With low levels of light pollution it can be viewed below the 67th parallel north with modest amateur telescopes, appearing as a mottled ball of light.

It has an apparent angular diameter of about 10 arcminutes. Since it is away, this translates into a true (spatial) diameter of about 95 light-years. It contains several hundred thousand stars, and ranks among the densest globular clusters in the Milky Way. It is at more than twice the distance of the Galactic Center in regions considered the Galactic halo.

It hosts relatively many &quot;blue stragglers&quot;, stars that appear to be much younger than the cluster. It is thought these have lost part of their outer layers due to close encounters with other cluster members or perhaps from collisions between stars in the dense cluster. Images from the Hubble Space Telescope have shown pronounced districts of these stragglers in M80, suggesting the center of the cluster to have a very high capture and collision rate.

On May 21, 1860, a nova was found in M80 that delivered a magnitude of +7.0 to telescopes, binoculars and astute eyes. This variable star, given designation T Scorpii, reached an absolute magnitude of −8.5, briefly outshining the cluster.
