<text>Henry James Redknapp (born 2 March 1947) is an English former football manager and player. He has previously managed AFC Bournemouth, West Ham United, Portsmouth, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, Queens Park Rangers and Birmingham City. In his second spell at Portsmouth, he managed the side that won the 2008 FA Cup. At the conclusion of the 2009–10 season, he guided Tottenham into the UEFA Champions League. Redknapp announced his retirement from football management in 2017.

His son, Jamie Redknapp, played under him at Bournemouth and Southampton. He is also uncle to Frank Lampard, who played under him at West Ham United.

==Early life==
Redknapp was born in Poplar, London, the only child of Henry Joseph William Redknapp (1922–1996) and Violet May Brown (1924–2001).

At age eleven, while Redknapp was playing for East London Schools football, he was spotted by Dickie Walker, a Tottenham Hotspur scout. From there, Redknapp grew in the Tottenham youth ranks playing at Cheshunt, meeting the likes of Bill Nicholson, Dave Mackay and Danny Blanchflower. At age 15, Redknapp moved to West Ham United and played alongside Bobby Moore. In a 2008 interview, Redknapp stated as part of a tribute to Tom Finney, &quot;I was a big Arsenal fan as a kid and I remember seeing him play against Tommy Docherty one night.&quot;

After being appointed Tottenham manager later in 2008, Redknapp stressed his Tottenham connections as well, stating:

==Club career==
===West Ham United===
During his playing career, Redknapp played as a midfielder. He began his career with Tottenham Hotspur, playing for the youth team until he was 15 years old, when he moved to West Ham United. He first broke into the first team at West Ham in the 1965–66 season, making seven appearances and scoring one goal. He made his debut for West Ham in a 1–1 draw at home to Sunderland on 23 August 1965. His first goal came in a 4–1 away win over Tottenham on 8 April 1966.

Redknapp made his first start of the 1966–67 season, and scored his second goal for the club, on 3 December 1966 in a 3–0 win over West Bromwich Albion. Redknapp made 12 League appearances scoring once during his second season. During the 1967–68 season, he made 28 League appearances and scored twice, the first in a 4–2 home win over Burnley on 21 August 1967 and the second in a 5–1 away win over Sunderland on 6 September 1967.

During the 1968–69 season, Redknapp made 42 appearances and scored three times, with 36 appearances coming in the league (along with two goals), three in the FA Cup appearances and three in the League Cup (along with one goal). His first league goal of the season came in a 4–0 win over West Brom on 31 August 1968, while the next came in a match in the League Cup against Bolton Wanderers, which West Ham won 4–0. Redknapp received a red card in a 2–0 away defeat at Leeds United on 12 October 1968. He had been booked for fouling Billy Bremner and was dismissed by the referee for dissent. His third goal of the season came in a 4–3 win over Queens Park Rangers on 2 November 1968.

Redknapp made his first appearance of the 1969–70 season on 9 August 1969 in a 1–0 home win over Newcastle United, while his first goal of the season came in a 3–0 home win over Sheffield Wednesday on 2 September 1969. Redknapp made 26 total appearances and scored one goal; 23 of his appearances came in the league.

During the 1970–71 season, Redknapp made 21 league appearances with one more coming in the League Cup. He then made a further 35 appearances during the 1971–72 season with 22 of them coming in the league. This would be his last season at the club before he moved to AFC Bournemouth for the 1972–73 season. He made 175 total appearances in both league and cup action for West Ham, scoring eight times over seven seasons.

===AFC Bournemouth===
Redknapp joined Division 3 Bournemouth in 1972 from West Ham. He spent four seasons with the south coast side between 1972 and 1976.

In the 1972–73 season, Redknapp made 37 appearances with 34 of them coming in the league scoring once in the league and Bournemouth finished seventh in the league. He made a further 46 appearances scoring five times during the 1973–74 season with 39 appearances in the league.

Redknapp made 19 (all league) appearances during the 1974–75 season as Bournemouth were relegated to the Fourth Division. In 1975–76, he only managed nine appearances. At the end of the 1975–76 season, he moved to then Fourth Division side Brentford, where he made one appearance during the 1976–77 season.

===Seattle Sounders===
In 1976, Redknapp joined North American Soccer League (NASL) club Seattle Sounders as a player-coach. He made 15 appearances during the 1976 season as they reached the playoffs after finishing second in the Pacific Conference, Western Division, before losing to the Minnesota Kicks in the Division Championship. Before returning to Seattle, he appeared briefly for AP Leamington in the Southern League Premier Division. Redknapp then made five appearances during the 1977 season as they finished third in the Pacific Conference, Western Division, before losing out in Soccer Bowl &#x27;77 to Pelé&#x27;s New York Cosmos, 2–1.

Redknapp went on to make three appearances in the 1978 season and just the one in the 1979 season, before joining up with old teammate and 1966 World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore.

In 1980, he was contracted to play with ASL expansion team the Phoenix Fire, but the team folded in pre-season.

==International career==
Redknapp represented England at youth level when he was 17. He was in the side that won the 1964 UEFA European Under-18 Championship after defeating Spain 4–0 in the final.

==Management and coaching career==

===Seattle Sounders and Oxford City===
Redknapp began his management career as player-assistant manager of NASL club Seattle Sounders from 1976 to 1979 under Jimmy Gabriel. During his time with Seattle, Redknapp made 24 appearances, helping the side to second place in the Pacific Conference, Western Division, in his first season as player-coach, and then to third place in the Pacific Conference, Western Division, for the 1977 season, taking them to the final of the Soccer Bowl, before losing to Pelé&#x27;s New York Cosmos.

During the 1978 season, Redknapp helped Seattle to a third-place finish in the National Conference, Western Division, before they lost in the first round of the playoffs, again to the New York Cosmos. In his final year in Seattle, he helped them to another third-place finish in the National Conference, Western Division, but this time they failed to qualify for the playoffs.

Redknapp then assisted his former West Ham teammate Bobby Moore at Isthmian League club Oxford City.

===AFC Bournemouth===
At the beginning of the 1982–83 season, Redknapp took up his first major coaching role as assistant manager to David Webb at Bournemouth, six years after leaving the club as a player. Redknapp applied for the manager&#x27;s job when Webb moved to Torquay United partway through that season, but was overlooked in favour of Don Megson. Megson was sacked in late 1983 as Bournemouth were in the Third Division relegation places, and Redknapp was hired as his replacement in October 1983.

In his first season at the helm, Redknapp helped Bournemouth avoid relegation to the Fourth Division. Bournemouth also caused a shock in the FA Cup when they defeated holders Manchester United 2–0 in the third round. He led Bournemouth to victory in the inaugural Associate Members&#x27; Cup by beating Hull City in the final. Bournemouth won the Third Division title in 1987 with 97 points, breaking the club&#x27;s record for the most points accumulated in a season.

After two years at this level, Bournemouth were relegated at the end of their third season. Bournemouth were in 13th position on 3 March, but injuries which depleted the squad, combined with a catastrophic loss of form, meant they won only one more match that season, and were relegated on 5 May after a 1–0 defeat at Dean Court against Leeds United.

====Road accident====
In June 1990, while in Italy to watch the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Redknapp was involved in a road accident along with Michael Sinclair, the chairman of York City, Fred Whitehouse, the chairman of Aston Villa, and Bournemouth&#x27;s managing director, Brian Tiler. Travelling through Latina, south of Rome, at night, their chauffeur-driven minibus was in a head-on collision with a car containing three Italian soldiers. The minibus was flipped onto its roof and skidded 50 yards along the road. Sitting in the seat where Redknapp had usually sat during the trip, Tiler was killed, as were the three occupants of the other vehicle. Redknapp was doused in petrol and pulled clear of the accident by Sinclair. Redknapp suffered a fractured skull, a broken nose, cracked ribs and a gash in his left leg. Ambulance services arriving at the scene believed him dead and placed a blanket over his head. Unconscious for two days, Redknapp was flown home two weeks later in a special air ambulance paid for by Bournemouth. Though he made a full recovery, apart from losing his sense of smell and gaining a facial tic, he eventually quit Bournemouth at the end of the 1991–92 season.

===West Ham United===
For the next season, Redknapp was appointed assistant manager to Billy Bonds at West Ham, another of his former clubs. However, in August 1994, the club board of directors opted to turn control of the team over to Redknapp and move Bonds into an administrative role. Bonds eventually resigned outright from the club, leaving Redknapp solely in charge.

Just months before being promoted to the manager&#x27;s seat at Upton Park, Redknapp was linked with the managerial vacancy at Southampton after the departure of previous manager Ian Branfoot, but the job went to Alan Ball instead.

Redknapp helped to establish the club in the FA Premier League and introduced a number of young players from the club&#x27;s academy, including Michael Carrick, Joe Cole, Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard. The signings of Stuart Pearce, Paolo Di Canio and Trevor Sinclair helped them re-establish their careers having been signed by Redknapp. He also made mistakes in the transfer market, particularly with overseas players, including Marco Boogers, Florin Raducioiu and Paulo Futre.

Nevertheless, West Ham finished in eighth position in 1998 and fifth in 1999, which saw them qualify for the UEFA Intertoto Cup in what was their second-best ever season in the top division. In the 1999–2000 season, West Ham won the Intertoto Cup and qualified for the UEFA Cup but failed to match their performances in the Premier League. Redknapp left West Ham on 9 May 2001, one match before the end of the 2000–01 season. For some time, it was unconfirmed whether he resigned or was sacked but Redknapp shed new light on the true circumstances in October 2007:
===Portsmouth===
Redknapp became director of football for Portsmouth in 2001, and when the Leicester City manager&#x27;s job became vacant with the dismissal of Peter Taylor that autumn, Redknapp was widely tipped to take over at the East Midlands club, but stayed loyal to &quot;Pompey&quot;, with the Leicester job going to Dave Bassett. It was reported in the national media that had Redknapp taken over, Bassett would have been on his coaching staff at the East Midlands club.

However, after the club&#x27;s poor form, he replaced manager Graham Rix in March 2002. Redknapp managed the club to the Division One title in the 2002–03 season, gaining promotion to the Premier League, replacing his former club West Ham.

Redknapp kept Portsmouth in the Premier League in the 2003–04 season, but had a dispute with Portsmouth owner Milan Mandarić over his assistant Jim Smith. Redknapp had another disagreement with Mandarić over the appointment of Velimir Zajec as director of football and resigned as manager in November 2004.

===Southampton===
A few weeks after his departure at Portsmouth, Redknapp became manager of Southampton, a move which infuriated Portsmouth&#x27;s supporters, as the two clubs are fierce local rivals. Some fans even bore T-shirts which referred to Redknapp as &quot;Scummer&quot; and &quot;Judas&quot; and called for him to &quot;Rot in Hell&quot;.

Redknapp was tasked with keeping Southampton in the Premier League – a similar task to the one Redknapp was facing with Portsmouth, and a familiar one at the club over the previous 15 years, which he would have faced had he accepted the offer to take over a decade earlier – but ultimately was unable to achieve this, ending Southampton&#x27;s 27-year spell in the top flight. Redknapp remained in charge for the 2005–06 Championship season but was unable to establish consistency needed to make Southampton promotion contenders. Redknapp was also unhappy with chairman Rupert Lowe&#x27;s appointment of Clive Woodward to the club&#x27;s coaching staff. After being repeatedly linked with a return to Portsmouth after they sacked Alain Perrin, Redknapp resigned as Southampton&#x27;s manager in early December 2005. Lowe quoted Redknapp as referring to Portsmouth as his &quot;spiritual home&quot;.

===Return to Portsmouth===
Redknapp returned to Portsmouth on 7 December 2005 with the club threatened by relegation to the Championship, although not in the relegation zone. At first it looked like Redknapp would be heading for a second successive relegation, but a fine run of form at the end of the season, aided by the takeover of Portsmouth by Alexandre Gaydamak (which provided Redknapp with more money), ensured Portsmouth&#x27;s survival. In the following season, Redknapp led Portsmouth to a ninth-placed finish which was the club&#x27;s highest league finish since the 1950s. In October 2007, Redknapp signed a new contract at Portsmouth lasting until 2011.

In January 2008, it emerged through the media that Redknapp was offered the vacant manager&#x27;s job at Newcastle United following the sacking of Sam Allardyce. Redknapp had apparently declined the job, stating, &quot;I have a job to do to take this club forward and to walk away would not have been the right thing to do.&quot; It was later stated by Newcastle chairman Christopher Mort that Redknapp &quot;was interviewed for the job but he was only one of a number of people we were speaking to at that time&quot;, and at the time of Redknapp&#x27;s interview the club had already been in secret talks with the eventual appointee, Kevin Keegan, for a week.

On 8 March 2008, Redknapp led Portsmouth to an FA Cup quarter-final victory over Manchester United, completing a hat-trick of FA Cup wins over Manchester United, and followed this with a semi-final victory over West Bromwich Albion at Wembley on 5 April. He guided the club to their first FA Cup Final in 69 years, where they defeated Cardiff City on 17 May 2008 to win The FA Cup 1–0, thanks to a goal scored by Nwankwo Kanu. He is the last English manager to win a major English trophy.

Redknapp returned to Portsmouth to receive the Freedom of the City in a ceremony on 28 October 2008. As this event took place two days after his departure for Tottenham Hotspur, he received a mixed reception from the Portsmouth fans, despite having led the club to a long-awaited trophy in the 2008 FA Cup.

===Tottenham Hotspur===

In October 2008, following the sacking of Juande Ramos by Tottenham Hotspur, the club announced Redknapp had agreed to take over as the new manager at Spurs, the club where he began his playing career. Tottenham paid £5 million in compensation to Portsmouth for releasing Redknapp. Spurs had secured only two points from the first eight matches of the season prior to Redknapp&#x27;s arrival and lay bottom of the Premier League table, but in his first two weeks in charge, he took the club out of the relegation zone, winning 10 out of the 12 points available after wins against Bolton Wanderers, Liverpool and Manchester City, as well as a remarkable 4–4 draw against North London rivals Arsenal.

In January 2009, Redknapp signed five new players in order to add quality and much-needed depth to his squad. He brought back Jermain Defoe from his old club Portsmouth for £15.75 million and Honduran midfielder Wilson Palacios from Wigan Athletic for £12 million. Long-serving Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini also joined on a free transfer; former Spurs player Pascal Chimbonda returned to White Hart Lane from Sunderland for a fee in the region of £3 million; and Robbie Keane, who like Chimbonda and Defoe had only left Spurs within the last year, re-joined after an unsuccessful spell at Liverpool for an initial fee of £12 million.

In the second half of the season, Spurs gradually moved up the league table after a significant improvement in form. In March 2009, Redknapp led Spurs to the League Cup final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester United. Spurs eventually finished in eighth position with 51 points, narrowly missing out on a UEFA Europa League place.

Redknapp made significant alterations to the squad in the summer of 2009. Striker Darren Bent was sold to Sunderland for an initial fee of £10 million, while midfielder Didier Zokora departed for Sevilla for £7.75 million. Both England international striker Peter Crouch and Croatia midfielder Niko Kranjčar arrived from Portsmouth for £9 million and £2 million respectively along with defender Sébastien Bassong from Newcastle United for £8 million.

In 2009–10, his first full campaign with the club, Redknapp guided Spurs to one of their most successful Premier League campaigns to date. Beginning with four consecutive wins, Spurs went on to finish in fourth place with 70 points, therefore gaining the chance to qualify for the UEFA Champions League via a play-off. As a result of his efforts, he won the Premier League Manager of the Year award, only the second manager to do so in a season when his side did not win the title.

On 13 July 2010, it was confirmed Spurs had extended Redknapp&#x27;s contract until the end of the 2013 season.

On 25 August 2010, Spurs confirmed their position in the Champions League group stage by overturning a first-leg deficit to defeat Swiss team Young Boys at White Hart Lane in the Champions League play-off. After a surprising run to the quarter-finals, Spurs were eliminated in April 2011, after a 5–0 aggregate defeat to Real Madrid. Spurs ended the Premier League season in fifth position with 62 points. Although not enough to secure a second year of Champions League football, this finish instead meant that Redknapp&#x27;s Spurs qualified for the Europa League.

In the 2011–12 season, Redknapp signed 40-year-old goalkeeper Brad Friedel after his contract expired with Aston Villa. He also made a season-long loan move for Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor. On transfer deadline day, he signed English midfielder Scott Parker for an undisclosed fee from West Ham. Redknapp then went on to win the Premier League Manager of the Month award for September and November.

Despite leading Tottenham to their second fourth-placed finish in three years, and missing out on UEFA Champions League qualification only due to Chelsea winning the competition, Redknapp was sacked by Tottenham on 13 June 2012, after reportedly failing to agree terms on a new contract.

===Queens Park Rangers===
On 24 November 2012, Redknapp, who had been working at former club Bournemouth in an advisory role, was appointed as manager of Queens Park Rangers, taking over from Mark Hughes, whose contract was terminated the previous day. QPR were bottom with only four points from 12 matches. His first match in charge of QPR came on 27 November, a 0–0 draw away to Sunderland. Redknapp earned his first win as QPR manager, and the club&#x27;s first Premier League victory of the 2012–13 season, on 15 December after defeating Fulham 2–1 at Loftus Road.

On 2 January 2013, Redknapp led QPR to a 1–0 victory away from home against reigning European champions Chelsea. This was QPR&#x27;s first away win in the Premier League since November 2011 and their first top flight victory at Stamford Bridge since March 1979. His first match against Tottenham since being sacked by the North London club came on 12 January 2013, with Redknapp leading QPR to a 0–0 draw at Loftus Road.

On 28 April 2013, after a 0–0 draw against fellow relegation rivals Reading, and with three matches of the season to play, QPR were relegated from the Premier League to the Championship after two seasons in the top flight. After a single season in the Championship, Redknapp managed QPR to a 1–0 victory in the Play-off Final against Derby County on 24 May 2014 at Wembley Stadium, returning the club to the Premier League. On 3 February 2015, Redknapp resigned as manager of QPR. With an imminent knee operation, Redknapp said that he could not give 100% to the job and that it would be better for someone else to take over as manager. Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey were placed in temporary charge. In April 2015, Redknapp expanded on his reasons for leaving QPR, stating he had also left the club because he &quot;no longer knew who was on my side&quot;. At his time of departure, QPR were in second-last position in the Premier League with 19 points from 23 matches and a record zero points from away matches.

===Jordan===
In March 2016, Redknapp was appointed manager of the Jordan national team alongside his former assistant, Kevin Bond, for the country&#x27;s next two qualifying matches for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Redknapp&#x27;s first match as Jordan manager, on 24 March, ended in an 8–0 win over Bangladesh. This was followed by a 5–1 defeat to Australia.

===Birmingham City and retirement===
On 18 April 2017, Redknapp was announced as the manager of Birmingham City until the end of the season after the resignation of Gianfranco Zola. His first match in charge was a 1–0 loss to local rivals Aston Villa. The final two matches of the season saw Redknapp&#x27;s team beat Huddersfield Town 2–0, followed by a 1–0 away win at Bristol City, allowing Birmingham to escape any threat of relegation.

In May 2017, Redknapp signed a one-year deal to continue as Birmingham manager for another season. Kevin Bond was reunited with Redknapp as assistant manager, replacing the outgoing Steve Cotterill. His first signings were David Stockdale, Marc Roberts and Cheikh N&#x27;Doye.

On 16 September 2017, after five straight league defeats that left the team second bottom in the table, a statement from Birmingham City said the club were &quot;left with no choice but to terminate the contract of the manager with immediate effect&quot;. After his sacking, Redknapp said that there was &quot;every chance&quot; his role as Birmingham manager would be his last managerial job. A month later, Redknapp confirmed his retirement from management after 34 years in the dugout.

On 16 February 2023, Redknapp revealed he would be interested in a return to club management via Leeds United after the dismissal of Jesse Marsch. On 21 February 2023, Leeds would appoint Javi Gracia putting an end to the Redknapp rumours.

==Other roles==
In January 2016, Redknapp made a return to football as a director at Wimborne Town. In March 2016, he was named as a football advisor for Derby County until the end of the 2015–16 season.

On 29 April 2016, it was announced that Redknapp was to join Australian side Central Coast Mariners as a football consultant.

In October 2017, following his departure from Birmingham City, Redknapp briefly joined League Two club Yeovil Town in a voluntary advisory role to manager Darren Way.

Since December 2020, Redknapp has been a Nexen Tire brand ambassador.

On 8 February 2021, Redknapp returned to Bournemouth to advise caretaker manager Jonathan Woodgate, though was not officially involved.

On 9 July 2021, Redknapp made a small cameo appearance in the popular British soap opera, &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

On 6 December 2023, Redknapp came out of retirement aged 76 to help Specsavers Cwm Albion

In 2024, Redknapp signed up to co-manage England&#x27;s football team on Sunday 9 June for Soccer Aid 2024. The England team was captained by former lioness, Jill Scott, and the match was hosted at Stamford Bridge stadium against a World XI, with proceeds going to charity.

==Corruption allegations and arrest==

On 19 September 2006, Redknapp was shown on camera by BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; taking part in what appeared to be an interest in approaching a player in a manner forbidden by FA rules. Redknapp denied that his conversation about then-Blackburn Rovers player Andy Todd with the football agent Peter Harrison amounted to &quot;tapping up&quot; or improperly approaching the player. Redknapp referred to Todd as a &quot;tough bastard&quot; during the conversation and suggested he would be interested in signing the player on a full-time basis if he was available. Redknapp told the BBC he has never taken a bung and had given Kevin Bond no reason to think otherwise and that he considers himself to be &quot;one million percent innocent&quot;.

In the final report of the Stevens inquiry, published in June 2007, the only criticism of Redknapp concerned his ownership of a racehorse named Double Fantasy thought to have been given to him by the agent Willie McKay, which has aroused some suspicion. Redknapp told the inquiry it was possible he did own the horse but insisted he had not made any money out of it because the horse was a failure and never won a race.

On 28 November 2007, Redknapp, along with Portsmouth&#x27;s managing director Peter Storrie, former Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandarić, agent Willie McKay and footballer Amdy Faye had been arrested by City of London Police on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting. Redknapp was later released without charge and announced his intention to sue the police because of his arrest, considering it as the reason for the failure of the FA to consider him for manager of the England national team after the sacking of Steve McClaren. The High Court ruled in May 2008 that the raid by City of London Police officers, on Redknapp&#x27;s home in Poole, was illegal and quashed the search warrants, calling their actions &quot;wholly unacceptable&quot; and ordering them to pay £1,000 damages to Redknapp as well as part of his legal costs.

Following further investigation by HM Revenue &amp; Customs as part of the corruption enquiry, in January 2010, Redknapp was charged with two counts of cheating the public revenue, along with Milan Mandarić. The charge related to a £189,000 payment from Mandarić to Redknapp via a bank account in Monaco. The trial began at Southwark Crown Court on 23 January 2012. Part of Redknapp&#x27;s defence was that he was both dyscalculic and dyslexic and therefore had difficulty in dealing with transfer contracts. He was found not guilty on both counts on 8 February 2012.

===England manager&#x27;s job===
Redknapp&#x27;s acquittal came just hours before the resignation of England national team head coach Fabio Capello. Two days later, he refused to rule himself out of the running for the job, but said it would be very difficult to combine the role with his then position as Tottenham manager. A few weeks later, the FA appointed Roy Hodgson as manager.

==Personal life==
Redknapp and his wife Sandra have two sons: Jamie, a football pundit and former professional footballer; and Mark, a model. Jamie made his professional debut under his father at Bournemouth in 1990 before moving on to Liverpool and later Tottenham Hotspur and lastly Southampton before retiring in 2005. Harry&#x27;s grandson via his son Mark, also called Harry Redknapp, signed for Bournemouth during May 2014. His nephew is former England midfielder Frank Lampard, Jr. whose parents are Sandra&#x27;s late twin sister, Patricia, and Harry&#x27;s former teammate and managerial assistant Frank Lampard, Sr.

Redknapp and his wife are the fundraising presidents for the Southampton-based charity Leukaemia Busters, a role they took over in 2004 previously held by former cricketer David Gower and his wife Thorunn.

Redknapp and his wife also own a property development company, Pierfront Developments. In August 2011, it was announced that a housing development their company was building in Southsea, Hampshire, would go ahead without affordable housing. The £600,000 they offered to the council to build affordable homes elsewhere, was accepted by the council. Opponents of the scheme estimated this will only be enough to build eight homes instead of the 28 that council policy says they should be building in this development. In October 2019, planning permission was granted for the company to convert a homeless shelter in Bournemouth into flats, despite pleas from residents who told planning authorities that the development would exacerbate homelessness and put their welfare at risk.

In January 2011, Redknapp was mugged while attending a football match in Madrid. On 2 November 2011, he had an operation to unblock coronary arteries. Redknapp wrote for the online gambling company, Betfair, as its &quot;Euro 2012 columnist&quot;.

In 1998 Redknapp published his autobiography, &quot;Harry Redknapp: My Autobiography&quot;. It was co-written with Derek McGovern. His second autobiography, &quot;Always Managing&quot;, was published in 2013. It was ghostwritten by journalist Martin Samuel.

Redknapp was a contestant in the 2018 series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; He subsequently won the show, and was crowned &#x27;King of the Jungle&#x27;.
Redknapp is the owner of racehorse, &quot;Shakem Up&#x27;Arry&quot; which won the TrustATrader Plate Handicap Chase at the 2024 Cheltenham Festival.

<text>Warren Jay Cawley (July 6, 1940 – January 21, 2022) was an American athlete, winner of 400 m hurdles at the 1964 Summer Olympics.

Cawley was born in Highland Park, Michigan. He attended Farmington High School.

Cawley still holds the record time for the 100 yard dash at Farmington High School that he set in 1959. He was &quot;Track and Field News&quot; &quot;High School Athlete of the Year&quot; in 1959. He won the AAU championships in 440-yard hurdles in 1963 and 1965 and as a University of Southern California student, he won an NCAA title in 440 yd hurdles in 1963.

At the Olympic Trials in 1964, Cawley set a world record in 400 m hurdles with a time of 49.1, thus becoming a main favorite at the Olympic Games. Cawley won the gold medal in Tokyo with a commanding performance in which he beat his nearest competitor John Cooper from Great Britain by 0.5 seconds.

He died on January 21, 2022, at the age of 81.

<doc id="971401" wikidata="Q4026169" url="?curid=971401" title="Glottalic consonant">
<text>In phonetics, a glottalic consonant is a consonant produced with some important contribution (movement or closure) of the glottis.

Glottalic sounds may involve motion of the larynx upward or downward, as the initiator of an egressive or ingressive glottalic airstream mechanism respectively. An egressive glottalic airstream produces &quot;ejective consonants&quot;, while an ingressive glottalic airstream produces &quot;implosive consonants&quot;. Ejectives are almost always voiceless stops (plosives) or affricates, while implosives are almost always voiced stops.

However, when a sound is said to be &quot;glottalized&quot;, this is often not what is meant. Rather, glottalization usually means that a normal pulmonic airstream is partially or completely interrupted by closure of the glottis. Sonorants (including vowels) may be glottalized in this fashion. There are three ways this can be represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet: (a) with an apostrophe; (b) with a superscript glottal stop; or (c) with an under-tilde. For example, the Yapese word for &quot;sick&quot; with a glottalized &quot;m&quot; could be transcribed . (In some conventions, the apostrophe is placed above the letter.) When an obstruent is glottalized but still uses a pulmonic airstream, it may be written , , , , , , , , etc.

The constriction of the larynx and surrounding tissues when pronouncing a glottalized resonant may cause the larynx to rise (usually) or occasionally to fall. However, this is not normally interpreted as an ejective or implosive airstream mechanism, but rather individual variation in the glottalization.

A language may have more than one kind of glottalic consonant. However, a language that has one kind is not particularly likely to have others. For example, languages in the Americas which have both ejectives and glottalized sonorants may reflect an areal feature rather than an inherent feature common to the sounds in question. Since none of the three types are very common, languages containing more than one type are relatively rare.

==Distribution in the world&#x27;s languages==

:&quot;Based on Ian Maddieson&#x27;s map of the distribution of glottalized consonants, and on the accompanying text, which can be opened in a separate window; all statements are drawn from this source. Click on the symbols in the map legend to remove them from or restore them to the map. Click on the symbols on the map itself to see Maddieson&#x27;s sources for that language.&quot;

This section gives the distribution of &quot;ejective and ejective-like consonants, implosive and implosive-like consonants, and glottalized resonants&quot; according to the number of languages in which these sounds occur, the geographical location of these languages, and the total number of consonants in the languages. Note that fewer than 10% of the extant languages were surveyed; future research could change some of the conclusions here.

===How many languages have glottalized consonants?===

In the text accompanying his map, Maddieson writes, “At least some glottalized consonants occur in the consonant inventories of 154 of the 566 languages surveyed for this chapter, that is, in a little over a quarter of the languages (27.2%). Among the three classes of these consonants as defined above, ejectives are more widely found than implosives, and glottalized resonants are the least widespread. Ejectives or ejective-like consonants occur in 92 (16.3%) languages in the survey, implosives or implosive-like consonants occur in 75 (13.3%), and glottalized resonants in just 29 (5.1%).” Note that Maddieson includes such features as stiff voice (but not breathy voice), “It should thus be borne in mind that the terms ejective and implosive are being used here to refer to somewhat more inclusive classes of consonants than is traditional in the phonetic literature” (or in Wikipedia).

====Co-occurrence of ejectives, implosives, and glottalized resonants====
Maddieson also states, “An overwhelming majority (135 out of 151) [that is, almost 90%] of the languages in the survey with implosives or with ejectives do not include members of the other class in their consonant inventories; on the other hand, a majority (22 out of 29) [about 75%] of the languages with glottalized resonants also have ejectives.”

===Geographic distribution===

It appears that these types of consonants cluster in geographic regions more strongly than they cluster in language families (areal distribution rather than genealogical, according to Maddieson).

====Ejectives====
Over half of the languages with ejectives are in the Western Hemisphere. Maddieson says, “They are particularly found along the Andean cordillera in the south, in Mexico and Guatemala, and in the more northwesterly parts of North America. Most strikingly, the consonant inventories of almost all the diverse indigenous languages of northern California, Oregon and Washington, British Columbia, the Yukon and Alaska include ejectives.” Clusters elsewhere include the Semitic languages of Ethiopia and neighbouring countries. “The dense cluster of languages in the Caucasus with ejectives includes languages of four different families... Itelmen and Yapese [show] that consonants of this type can occasionally develop in geographical isolation.”

====Implosives====
Over half of the languages with implosives are in sub-Saharan Africa; another big cluster is in Southeast Asia. Only 16% of the languages with implosives occur elsewhere in world. Maddieson says that about three-quarters of the languages that have both ejectives and implosives occur in eastern and southern Africa.

====Glottalized resonants====
Two-thirds of the languages with glottalized resonants are in the Americas. Nearly half of them co-occur with ejectives in the cluster from California to the Northwest Territories of Canada. Glottalized resonants are found only in three languages with ejectives outside the Western Hemisphere; Maddieson suggests, “The association between glottalized resonants and ejectives might best be viewed as a result of overlapping patterns of spread in a single area, and not as the consequence of any particular linguistic dependence between the occurrence of these two classes of consonants.”

===Glottalized consonants compared to total number of consonants===

Maddieson believes that complex consonants, requiring &quot;more intricate coordination&quot; of different parts of the mouth and throat, are more likely to occur in languages with larger numbers of contrasting consonant phonemes. He says,
“About 10% of the languages with small consonant inventories [18 or fewer consonants] have any glottalized consonants, whereas two-thirds of those with large inventories [34 or more consonants] include one or more glottalized consonants, and the proportion increases with each increase in overall inventory size.”

<text>Johann Michael Ackner (January 25, 1782 – August 12, 1862) was a Transylvanian archaeologist and nature researcher.

==Biography==
A Saxon born in Schäßburg (Sighişoara), a town in the Habsburg province of Transylvania (now Romania), Johann Ackner first studied at the college in his hometown. He then went on to study philosophy at the Reformed College of Hermannstadt and in 1805 in Wittenberg. However, his studies were interrupted by the occupation of Wittenberg by the troops of the French Empire in 1806. Ackner continued his studies in Göttingen where he heard among others Christian Gottlob Heyne, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, Johann Beckmann and Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren.

After finishing his university studies, he traveled by foot through large parts of Germany, France, Italy and Switzerland. After returning to Transylvania, he worked for 13 years as professor of philology and archaeology at the school of Hermannstadt. In 1821, the community of Hermannstadt elected him as priest, which gave him time to follow his studies.

He traveled several times between 1832 and 1847 to visit areas of ancient Roman and Dacian history, as well as sites of mineral findings and petrifactions in Transylvania and neighbouring countries. As a result of these travels, he wrote a series of archaeological tracts and tracts on natural history and collected Roman Dacian antiquities, coins, petrifactions and minerals. He often accepted visitors from scientific circles in his parish. In 1851, Johann Michael Ackner was elected as member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.
In 1856 he initiated the archaeological research at the ancient Dacian town of Cumidava (now Râșnov), where the Romans built a castrum after the conquest of Dacia.

Ackner died in 1862 in Hermannstadt (Sibiu).

<text>The Goring Gap is a topographical feature on the course of the River Thames. The Gap is located in southern England where the river, flowing from north to south, cuts through and crosses a line of chalk hills in a relatively narrow gap between the Chiltern Hills and the Berkshire Downs. The Gap is approximately upstream of Reading and downstream of Oxford. The Gap is named after the town of Goring-on-Thames in Oxfordshire. That town is on the east bank of the river at Goring Gap, and Streatley (in Berkshire) is immediately opposite, on the west bank.

At Goring Gap, the Thames is at an altitude of about . The ground rises steeply on either side, reaching within a kilometre to the east and west, and continuing to higher ground at around .

The Chalk beds have proved to be relatively more resistant to erosion than adjacent geological formations, so the relief of land to the north and south-east of the Gap is less marked. In particular, there is a low-lying Gault clay vale either side of Dorchester (to the north), and a broad, low-lying London Clay zone in the London Basin beyond Reading (to the south-east).

Although this configuration - of a major river slicing through chalk hills, with extensive areas of lower-lying land on either side - is not found in this precise fashion elsewhere in the Chiltern Hills, it is found at a number of locations in the North Downs and South Downs; for example, where the North Downs are crossed by the River Wey at Guildford, and by the River Mole near Dorking.

==Formation==
The River Thames has its origins in the emergence of Britain from a Cretaceous sea over 60 million years ago. During the latter part of the Cretaceous period, sea level is thought to have been over higher than today.
Much of the land which was later to form Britain was covered by sea. In this marine environment, thick deposits of Chalk were laid down.
From the early Paleocene (from around 65 million years ago), much of what is now Britain emerged above sea level. The maximum uplift occurred in the north-west, with a regional tilt towards the east and south-east. The North Sea basin also developed.
The drainage of much of England was thus aligned to the south-east. As the land emerged from beneath the Cretaceous sea, precursors of some of today&#x27;s major drainage systems of central, eastern and southern England developed. Thus, from the early Tertiary period a number of major consequent rivers flowed approximately NW-SE down the tilted emergent Chalk surface towards what later became southern England. 

One of those early watercourses was the Ancestral Thames. However, the course of the river prior to the Pleistocene epoch is not known exactly. The geological beds over which it flowed (including Chalk beds which formerly covered much of central, northern and western Britain), and any deposits which the river may have left, have all been removed by erosion.

However, it is known with some certainty that the Thames has been flowing close to where the Goring Gap is now situated from at least Early Pleistocene times - that is, for at least one million years, and probably for rather longer. This is because a deposit of &quot;variably sandy and clayey gravel&quot;, which is known to have been laid down by the Thames, has been found on hilltops close to Goring Gap. This deposit, known as Westland Green Gravel, lies on land at a today&#x27;s altitude of about at Cray&#x27;s Pond (about east of Goring), and at the top of Streatley Hill (about west of today&#x27;s Thames). It is believed that that deposit was laid down by the Thames approximately 1.6 million years ago.

(It is possible that, at a slightly earlier time (on a geological scale), the Thames may have been flowing on a course a little to the north-east of Goring Gap - that is, through Stoke Row, where deposits laid down by the Thames and resting today at a somewhat higher altitude (over have been identified. The outcrops of Thames gravel there are relatively isolated, and the line which the river was taking at that time is not entirely clear. But if the Thames did enter the London Basin in the vicinity of Stoke Row at that time, it would then have moved south-westwards to Goring Gap over a period of about a hundred thousand years or more, prior to the deposit of the Westland Green Gravel.)

The Stoke Row Gravel and the Westland Green Gravel are known to have been deposited by a major watercourse because they contain far-travelled materials, such as quartz and quartzite from Triassic and earlier formations of the West Midlands, and volcanic rocks from northern Wales. Moreover, the Westland Green Gravel continues beyond Goring Gap, north-eastwards across Hertfordshire and into East Anglia. A watercourse of such magnitude could only have been a precursor of today&#x27;s River Thames.

The extent and course of the Thames have changed considerably in certain places during the past 1.5 million years. In particular, the Thames lost its headwaters north of the Cotswolds - possibly as a result of the Anglian glaciation about 450,000 years ago. That glaciation was certainly responsible for a major change in the river&#x27;s course in the London Basin, where the ice advance to Watford forced the river, which had formerly flowed along the line of the Vale of St Albans, to take a more southerly course towards the North Sea, approximately along its present line.

However, the course of the Thames in the vicinity of Goring Gap has stayed much the same during the past 1.5 million years. Deposits laid down by the Thames which are younger than the Westland Green Gravel are found on hillsides close to today&#x27;s Thames in a zone running from Goring Gap to Reading, with their altitude becoming lower as the deposits become younger. And ice sheets from the north never reached as far south as Goring, so they did not disrupt the river&#x27;s course here as they did elsewhere. The river at Goring Gap has simply cut down progressively to its current altitude. During that time, the relief in the vicinity of Goring Gap, as elsewhere in many parts of Britain, has become progressively more pronounced, especially at times during the Quaternary of &quot;high discharge, under cold climatic conditions&quot;.

==Communications==

The Goring Gap forms an important communications and transportation corridor. Besides the river itself, which is now limited to navigation for leisure purposes, the gap accommodates the A329 road linking Reading and Oxford, along with the Great Western Main Line railway from London to Bristol and South Wales.

The Thames Path local section between Reading and Oxford, and the Ridgeway (local successor to the Icknield Way) cross the Thames here.

<doc id="971416" wikidata="Q2413627" url="?curid=971416" title="The Prisoners (band)">
<text>The Prisoners are a British garage rock band formed in 1980 in Rochester, Kent, England. Their 1960s garage sound made them a regular live fixture in London&#x27;s underground &quot;psychedelic revival&quot; and &quot;mod revival&quot; scene of the early 1980s, as well as a linchpin of the Medway scene.

==History==
The Prisoners line-up was: Graham Day (Vocal and Guitar), James Taylor (Vox Continental and Hammond Organ), Allan Crockford (Bass) and Johnny Symons (Drums). Fans speculated about the origin of the band&#x27;s name, with many believing it was derived from the 1960s TV series The Prisoner; however, Graham Day later stated that it came from the title of the first single by The Vapors (who later scored a hit with &quot;Turning Japanese&quot;). The band&#x27;s sound combined catchy, retro-flavoured melodies, punky guitar riffs, a distinctive vocal style and a lead instrument of the then-unfashionable Vox Continental organ. Part of the Medway scene, often referred to as the &#x27;Medway Delta&#x27;, they often toured with Thee Milkshakes, with whom they appeared in an edition of Channel 4&#x27;s The Tube dressed in Star Trek outfits. The band were adopted by the Mod revival, despite never considering themselves a mod band, and are widely considered to be one of the best bands from the 1980s mod scene. The Prisoners didn&#x27;t have much commercial success during their active years, but were later hailed as an influence on the Madchester sound of bands such as The Charlatans.

The band released their first album, &quot;A Taste of Pink&quot;, in 1982. Most of the songs were written by Graham Day. After releasing several self-financed records and spending a year with Big Beat Records, they made a final album, &quot;In From The Cold&quot; in 1986 for the Stiff Records label on their subsidiary label &quot;Countdown&quot;, run by Eddie Piller. After failing to find commercial success, the band split later in 1986. They have reformed for several live shows since then, and released a final one-off single in 1997.

Bassist Allan Crockford produced the single &quot;Strawberries are Growing in My Garden (and It&#x27;s Wintertime)&quot; by fellow Medway band, The Dentists. He joined James Taylor in the James Taylor Quartet. Graham Day continues to perform in a number of different beat combos, such as the Solar Flares, and MBEs alongside Billy Childish and Wolf Howard.

==Post break-up activities==
Since splitting up the members of The Prisoners have featured in a wide range of bands. James Taylor and Allan Crockford formed mainstream jazz funk band the James Taylor Quartet in 1986, although Allan Crockford is no longer part of their line-up. The Solarflares, who released four albums before splitting up in 2004, were Graham Day and Allan Crockford basically reprising The Prisoners sound along with drummer Wolf Howard and Mr Parsley on organ. Other bands who have featured former members of The Prisoners are Planet, The Buff Medways, The Prime Movers, Thee Mighty Caesars, The Stabilisers and The Galileo 7. Day fronted Graham Day &amp; the Gaolers, who released their first album, &quot;Soundtrack to the Daily Grind&quot;, in November 2007. Their second album &quot;Triple Distilled&quot; was released on the Damaged Goods label in 2008.

In 2014 &quot;A Taste of Pink&quot; was re-released again by Ace Records.

<text>Streatley is a village and civil parish on the River Thames in Berkshire, England. The village faces Goring-on-Thames. The two places share in their shops, services, leisure, sports and much of their transport. Across the river is railway station and the village cluster adjoins a lock and weir. The west of the village is a mixture of agriculture and woodland plus a golf course. The village has a riverside hotel. Much of Streatley is at steeply varying elevations, ranging from above ordnance datum (AOD) at Streatley Warren, a hilltop point on its western border forming the eastern end of the Berkshire Downs. This Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty is topped by the The Ridgeway path, which crosses the Thames at Goring and Streatley Bridge.

==Location==
Streatley is centred north-west of Reading and south of Oxford. Its developed area occupies half of the narrow Goring Gap on the River Thames and is directly across the river from the Oxfordshire village of Goring-on-Thames. The two villages are connected by Goring and Streatley Bridge, with its adjacent lock and weir, and are often considered as a single settlement. railway station on the Great Western Main Line is in Goring and serves both villages.

The village is mostly surrounded by National Trust land: Lardon Chase, the Holies and Lough Down. Nearby villages include Aldworth, Goring-on-Thames, Lower Basildon, Moulsford and Pangbourne The Ridgeway long-distance path passes through the village, which is the finishing line for the annual &quot;Ridgeway 40&quot; walk and trail run. The Thames Path, Icknield Way and the Ridgeway cross the Thames at Streatley.


==History==
Being in such a vital crossing point on the Thames, a settlement at Streatley has existed for a long time. The village is mentioned in the Domesday book. Neolithic tools have been found at the base of Lough Down and Bronze Age artefacts in the village. A sarsen stone, traditionally thought to be the remains of a Roman milestone, is still present at the Bull crossroads. Long before the bridge was built a ferry used to operate between the two villages. Sixty people were drowned at Streatley in 1674 when a ferry capsized in the flash lock. The iron wheel pump, on the forecourt of &quot;The Bull&quot;, was the only reliable water source in the great freeze of 1895, and water was sold from this point for sixpence a bucket.

Two-thirds of Streatley used to be owned by the Morrell family of brewers from Oxford, whose resistance to change enabled the village to withstand the railway line and extra houses that went to Goring-on-Thames. The watermill was originally owned by the nuns of Goring. In later years it was used to drive a generator to provide electricity for the estate. However, it burned down in 1926 and was not rebuilt. On the death of Emily Morrell, in 1938, the estate was sold, and the manor house and some other houses in the village became part of the Royal Veterinary College, which had moved out of London during The Blitz. The college left in 1958. A bomb exploded in a postman&#x27;s bag on a bicycle in the village in 1979. It was targeted at a retired judge in the village, but went off early, when the postman&#x27;s bicycle fell over. The incident appeared to be the work of the IRA.

==Government==
Streatley is a civil parish with an elected parish council. Besides the riverside village of Streatley, the parish covers an area of the Berkshire Downs to the west, and includes the small cluster of dwellings named Stichens Green. The parish is bordered to the north and east by the Oxfordshire parishes of Moulsford, South Stoke and Goring. To the west and south, it is bordered by the Berkshire parishes of Basildon, Ashampstead and Aldworth. The parish falls within the area of the unitary authority of West Berkshire. Both the parish council and the unitary authority have responsibilities for various aspects of local government. The parish used to form part of the Newbury parliamentary constituency, but moved to the new constituency of Reading West and Mid Berks in 2024.

==Amenities==
===Public house===
Streatley has one public house, &quot;The Bull at Streatley&quot; on the Reading Road. Its garden is the unusual burial site for a monk and a nun executed in 1440 for &quot;misconduct&quot; and contains an ancient yew tree. Near the &quot;Bull&quot; is a youth hostel.

===Hotel===
There is a four-star hotel and restaurant in the village – the Swan at Streatley. During the 1970s, it was owned by the drag artist Danny La Rue. The hotel was then purchased by Diplomat Hotels of Sweden, before being sold in 2001 to Nike Group Hotels, part of the Bracknell-based Nike Group of Companies, whose Chairman is John Nike. Since 2012, the hotel has been owned by Rare Bird Hotels, backed by Punch Taverns and Pizza Express entrepreneur Hugh Osmond. The restaurant area is now branded as Coppa Club. During the summer small electric boats can be rented from here to explore the Thames.

===Leisure facilities===
Goring and Streatley Golf Club is in the village, founded in 1895. It has a 6,355-yard, par 72 golf course, designed in part by Harry Colt, and has views of the Thames and Ridgeway. Streatley Hill is a destination for cycling hill climbs – the annual Didcot Phoenix Cycle Club and Reading Cycle Club Hill Climb competitions take place every September. The hill featured in the Tour of Britain in 2008 as a designated King of the Mountains climb.

===Church===
The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary in Streatley used to be part of the Reading Episcopal Area of the Diocese of Oxford, but has now moved to the Dorchester Episcopal Area, crossing the old Wessex-Mercia boundary for the first time in 1400 years. In the churchyard is the grave of an Anglo-Saxon warrior, whose body was discovered under the old bowling green in 1932 and reburied in the cemetery. The village has a Church of England primary school with a feeder pre-school attached to it. The church is a Grade II listed building.

===Events===
The annual Goring and Streatley Regatta was held each July on the Streatley side of the river. In the 19th century, it was a serious regatta to rival Henley or Marlow, but changed to a local regatta for amateur teams of inhabitants of the two villages. It came to a halt after COVID. 

A torchlight procession of villagers and visitors merges with another stream from Goring each Christmas Eve, in a night-time spectacle that continues onto Streatley Recreation Ground for a carol service.

There is a biannual Arts Festival called the Goring Gap Festival.

==In literature==
The village is the subject of the poem &quot;A Streatley Sonata&quot; by Joseph Ashby-Sterry composed in the late 19th century:
The village is mentioned in Jerome K Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;:

<doc id="971422" wikidata="Q378564" url="?curid=971422" title="Wang Xizhi">
<text>Wang Xizhi (; courtesy name: Yishao (); ) was a Chinese politician and writer from the Jin dynasty (266–420) known for his mastery of Chinese calligraphy. He is often regarded as the greatest calligrapher in Chinese history. His most famous work, composed in 353, is the (; &quot;Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion&quot;).

Born in Langya Commandery (in present-day Linyi, Shandong), Wang fled to southern China in his childhood after the collapse of the Western Jin dynasty. He studied calligraphy under the tutelage of relatives, including Wei Shuo, and became engaged to Xi Xuan around the year 323. They had eight children, including Wang Xianzhi, who later became a renowned calligrapher in his own right. Between 324 and 354, Wang Xizhi served in various government positions. He received his highest title, &quot;General of the Right Army&quot;, in 347, and was appointed administrator of Kuaiji (present-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang). In 353, he hosted 41 of his friends, relatives, and pupils at the Orchid Pavilion Gathering on Mount Kuaiji. There, the participants took part in a &quot;winding stream party&quot; and Wang composed the , a preface to the collection of poems that were written that day. He retired from governmental service in 355, devoted himself to Taoist practices, and died in Jinting (present-day Shengzhou, Zhejiang).

Wang is known for his proficiency in multiple Chinese script styles, particularly the regular, semi-cursive, and cursive forms. Apart from the and his letters to others, he mainly produced copies of existing texts. His works were enthusiastically collected by both emperors and private collectors. In particular, Emperor Taizong of Tang established Wang and his style as the defining standard for Chinese calligraphy by requiring that the imperial court scholars study his techniques and employing calligraphers to make handwritten tracing copies and ink rubbings of his works. There are no known surviving original works by Wang – only rubbings and a small number of tracing copies. Wang&#x27;s artistic talent continues to be held in high esteem, and he remains an influential figure in East Asian calligraphy.

== Life ==
=== Historical sources ===

Much of what is known about Wang Xizhi&#x27;s life is derived from letters that he wrote during his lifetime and historical texts such as the () and the (). Wang makes 47 appearances within the 1,130 historical anecdotes of the , which was originally compiled during the 5th century. These anecdotes describe his interactions with contemporaries such as the statesman Xie An and the poet Sun Chuo. The , which details the history of the Jin dynasty (266–420), contains his official biography in its 80th volume. The work was commissioned in the 7th century by Emperor Taizong of Tang, who personally wrote a postscript to Wang&#x27;s biography declaring him the greatest calligrapher in history.

Modern scholars have questioned the reliability and accuracy of these early sources. Xiaofei Tian, a scholar of Chinese literature, writes that the compilers of the , in an attempt to evoke feelings of nostalgia, were often &quot;willing to sacrifice historical accuracy for the sake of a good story&quot;. Matthew V. Wells suggests that Emperor Taizong&#x27;s unusual degree of involvement in the compilation of the may have been motivated by a desire to create a pro-imperial work and revise the presentation of historical events for his own purposes. In his analysis of the biography of Wang Dao, the uncle of Wang Xizhi, Wells observes that its authors selectively omitted anecdotes from the that were unflattering or otherwise did not depict Wang Dao as a model statesman. Because many other historical accounts of the Jin dynasty have not survived, the and the continue to be referenced as rich sources of information about the era, despite their limitations.

=== Early years and family ===

Wang Xizhi was born in Linyi in Langya Commandery (present-day Linyi, Shandong). During his childhood, his personal name was A&#x27;tu (). He was later given the courtesy name Yishao (), and adopted the studio name Danzhai (). He was a member of an aristocratic family, the Wang clan of Langya, and his father, Wang Kuang (), was the governor of Huainan. With the collapse of the Western Jin dynasty following the capture and execution of Emperor Huai, the Wang family fled to southern China and helped establish the Eastern Jin in 317. Together with other aristocratic immigrants such as the Xie clan of Chen, they dominated the regional politics of this period.

In his youth, Wang had difficulties with his speech, but he became a skilled orator later in life. He studied calligraphy under the tutelage of Wei Shuo, also known as &quot;Lady Wei&quot;, who was Wang Kuang&#x27;s cousin. Wang Kuang was also involved in his son&#x27;s lessons, working with Wei to teach him the techniques of the calligrapher Cai Yong. Wei Shuo was a specialist in the clerical, regular, and semi-cursive script styles of Chinese calligraphy, and gave lessons on selection of calligraphy supplies, proper posture, and basic stroke techniques. Wang Xizhi also learned calligraphy from his uncle, Wang Yi (), a painter and calligrapher who was married to the sister of Emperor Yuan of Jin. After his parents died, Wang Xizhi lived in the household of his uncle Wang Dao, a prominent politician and the patriarch of the Wang family. Wang Dao helped suppress attempted coups by his cousin Wang Dun in 322 and 324. Wang Xizhi&#x27;s reaction to these conflicts between his uncles, which ultimately resulted in Wang Dun&#x27;s death in 324, left him with a distaste for political and military affairs.
Around the year 323, Wang became engaged to Xi Xuan, the eldest daughter of the military general Xi Jian. In a well-known anecdote from the and the , Xi Jian sent an emissary to Wang Dao&#x27;s household to find a suitable husband for his daughter. While the other young men flaunted themselves in fine clothing, an indifferent Wang Xizhi arrived late and sprawled across a bed, with his robes open and belly exposed due to the heat. The emissary was impressed by his spontaneity and reported back to Xi Jian, who agreed to the match. Xi Xuan was also skilled at calligraphy. She and Wang had eight recorded children: seven sons – Xuanzhi, Ningzhi, Huanzhi, Suzhi, Huizhi, Caozhi, and Xianzhi – and one daughter, Mengjiang. Wang Xianzhi, their youngest son, became a renowned calligrapher in his own right, and he and Wang Xizhi were later praised as the &quot;Two Wangs&quot; or &quot;Two Kings&quot; ().

=== Political career ===
Wang Xizhi was appointed to various government positions between 324 and 354. He started as an assistant in the Palace Library, and he served as a companion and mentor to the future Emperor Jianwen of Jin. Around the year 334, he became the military aide to the general Yu Liang, who later praised him as &quot;pure and noble, a man with discriminating judgment&quot;. Wang was named governor of Linchuan (present-day Linchuan, Jiangxi) in 336. After declining several offers from Wang Dao to serve in the Department of Personnel, he became the regional inspector of Jiangzhou (near present-day Huangmei County, Hubei) and received the title of &quot;General Who Brings Repose to the Distance&quot; . In 346, he was reluctantly persuaded by his friend Yin Hao to accept the appointment of &quot;General Who Defends the Army&quot;.

He then requested an appointment as the administrator of Xuancheng (present-day Xuancheng, Anhui), so that he could focus on his cultural interests in a remote area, away from dynastic politics. He was instead appointed administrator of Kuaiji (present-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang), and moved there with his family in 347. That same year, he received his highest title, (; &quot;General of the Right Army&quot;). Because of this title, he later received the nickname &quot;Wang Youjun&quot; (). Despite his military titles, Wang disliked war, never engaged in warfare himself, and often tried to prevent armed conflicts. He unsuccessfully attempted to convince Yin Hao, who was in a fierce rivalry with the ambitious general Huan Wen, to abandon his plans to lead an army into northern China; Yin Hao&#x27;s expeditions ultimately ended in failure.

=== Orchid Pavilion Gathering ===
On 22 April 353, Wang hosted 41 of his friends, relatives, and pupils at the Orchid Pavilion on Mount Kuaiji for the Double Third Festival, which was celebrated annually on the third day of the third month of the Chinese calendar. Originating as a spring purification ritual, the festival became popular among scholars who gathered each year to discuss philosophical topics, compose poetry, and drink rice wine.

Wang&#x27;s gathering included six of his sons (Xuanzhi, Ningzhi, Huanzhi, Suzhi, Huizhi, and Xianzhi), as well as Xie An, Sun Chuo, and the Buddhist monk Zhi Dun. The participants of the Orchid Pavilion Gathering took part in a &quot;winding stream party&quot;, a customary drinking game in which they composed poetry while cups containing rice wine floated down the stream towards them. Those who were able to compose two poems before the cups reached them would have to drink only one cup of wine, whereas those who were unsuccessful had to drink more. The scholars composed a total of 41 poems that day.

The (; &quot;Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion&quot;), the most famous calligraphic work attributed to Wang (though its authenticity has been debated), is a preface to the collection of poems that were written that day. The Orchid Pavilion Gathering has been described as &quot;one of the most famous events in Chinese literary history&quot;. It has been depicted in numerous works of art and literature, and features as a prominent theme in paintings from the Song and Ming dynasties in China and the Edo period in Japan.

=== Retirement and later years ===

In 355, Wang announced that he would resign from governmental service. This decision was precipitated when Wang Shu, a political rival, was appointed regional inspector of Yangzhou and gained oversight of Kuaiji and Wang Xizhi&#x27;s administration. The two men had personally feuded for many years. Wang Shu subsequently opened an investigation into Kuaiji&#x27;s finances, alleging that Wang Xizhi had mishandled the collection of taxes in the region. Resolving to leave his position rather than continue working under his new superior, Wang Xizhi retired, citing ill health.

After his retirement, Wang moved to Jinting (present-day Shengzhou, Zhejiang) and devoted himself to Taoist practices. The Wang clan of Langya were well-known adherents of the Way of the Celestial Masters movement of Taoism, and Wang&#x27;s letters indicate that he was a follower of this movement as well. On one occasion when his granddaughter was ill, he composed a written confession of his own perceived moral failings, believing that these were linked to her illness and that he needed to petition the celestial masters to heal her. He regularly collected medicinal herbs that were believed to grant longevity, and together with his brother-in-law Xi Yin, he practiced (abstinence from cereals). During his lifetime, he transcribed several Taoist texts, including the (; &quot;Yellow Court Classic&quot;).

Wang died . Details about the circumstances of his death are unknown, but he had frequently mentioned his poor health in his letters to others. The maladies that were detailed in the letters include fatigue and weakness, insomnia, gastrointestinal issues, chronic pain, and chest discomfort. He sought out many treatments and therapies such as acupuncture, moxibustion, and various medicinal substances, including the psychoactive and toxic Cold-Food Powder which may have exacerbated his symptoms. He has been traditionally believed to be buried in a tomb in Jinting, which has become a major tourist attraction in Shengzhou. Some modern scholarship has suggested that he may have been actually buried in Jiankang (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu), the capital of the Eastern Jin, alongside other members of his family.

== Calligraphy ==
=== Provenance ===
The first known collector of Wang&#x27;s calligraphy was Huan Xuan, a Jin dynasty warlord who collected two wrappers (each containing approximately ten scrolls) of works by Wang Xizhi and his son, Wang Xianzhi. Another early collector, Duke Hui, was tricked by dealers who soaked forgeries in dirty water to make them appear older and then sold them as originals. The emperors of the Liu Song dynasty (420–479) were enthusiastic art collectors whose imperial collection included many pieces by the Two Wangs. Emperor Xiaowu obtained ten scrolls of Wang Xizhi&#x27;s calligraphy from private collectors, but collected many forgeries as well. A violent palace revolt during the reign of Liu Ziye caused the imperial collection to be scattered. His successor, Emperor Ming, reassembled and expanded the collection and tasked an expert calligrapher with cataloguing and authenticating the pieces. In total, 52 wrappers containing 520 scrolls of works by the Two Wangs were documented at the time. Over the next century, emperors continued to acquire new works of calligraphy, reacquire stolen ones, and hire expert authenticators. After Emperor Yuan of Liang reportedly set fire to his collection of 240,000 scrolls as an enemy army was approaching the capital, only about 4,000 scrolls were able to be salvaged from the ashes; it is unknown how many of these were produced by Wang.
Emperor Taizong of Tang, a great admirer of Wang, amassed a collection of over 2,000 of his works (including originals and copies) and required that the imperial court scholars study his calligraphic techniques. The emperor was particularly fascinated with the and went to great lengths to obtain the original, which he ordered to be buried in his mausoleum upon his death. He employed calligraphers to make tracing copies of the and other works by Wang, using semitransparent tracing paper that was placed over the original versions. They also produced copies using the ink rubbing technique, which involved carving a tracing copy into a stone block, placing a thin sheet of paper over the engraving, and pounding an inkpad onto the surface to transfer the characters to the paper. This process was more efficient than tracing by hand, but it was also less accurate. These reproductions, along with the creation of an imperial office to teach calligraphy to young scholars in the capital, firmly established Wang and his style as the defining standard for Chinese calligraphy. According to the art historian Lothar Ledderose, Emperor Taizong was the &quot;one man who did most for the propagation of the Wang [Xizhi] tradition&quot;.

The emperors of the Song dynasty continued to promote reproductions of Wang&#x27;s calligraphy. Around this time, the &quot;Dingwu stone&quot;, an engraving of the made by Ouyang Xun and widely considered to be most faithful to the original, was discovered in the Hebei province. During the Ming dynasty, Wang&#x27;s works were mainly promoted by private collectors who accumulated compilation albums of his rubbings. In the present day, there are no known surviving original works by Wang Xizhi. The earliest extant reproductions of his work were produced during the Tang dynasty, including a small number of tracing copies. Numerous rubbings exist – including many copies of the Dingwu stone – but these have likely become less accurate over the centuries as inaccuracies are propagated over time when new engravings are made from older rubbings.

=== Technique and style ===
Wang is known for his proficiency in multiple Chinese script styles, particularly the regular (), semi-cursive (), and cursive () forms. His calligraphy also contains traces of patterns found in the early seal script () style, according to an analysis by Dong Qichang, an art theorist and calligrapher of the Ming dynasty who studied the stylistic effects of the brush tip in Wang&#x27;s works. Although he produced famous works in multiple script styles, he remains best known for his innovations in semi-cursive script, the style of the . His works vary in length from a few lines to several hundred characters and, apart from the and his letters to others, are largely copies of existing texts.

A hallmark of Wang&#x27;s calligraphy, according to the art historian Robert E. Harrist Jr., is the presence of &quot;brushstrokes that are carefully formed and create a sense of disciplined energy flowing down the page&quot;, even for text that appears to have been rapidly written. He regularly experimented with varying the speed and direction of the brush, resulting in distinctive visual characteristics in different instances of recurring strokes. In the , for instance, characters that are repeated have different visual forms, creating a sense of spontaneity that reflects the scene during which it was written. In contrast to the relatively wide characters typically seen in clerical script (), Wang&#x27;s characters were more vertically elongated and compact.

The study of Wang&#x27;s style is challenged by the lack of surviving original works. In debating the differences between Wang&#x27;s calligraphy and archaeological texts produced by other writers around the same time period, some scholars have questioned the relative influence of Wang versus the Tang calligraphers who copied his pieces. Ledderose observes that the works attributed to Wang vary widely in style, precision, and balance, making a &quot;correct assessment of his personal contribution quite difficult&quot;.

==== Representative works ====

Written in regular script:
* (; &quot;Essay on Yue Yi&quot;): a transcription of an essay authored by Xiahou Xuan about Yue Yi, a military general during the Warring States period. Copied by Wang in 348, it is generally regarded as the best example of his regular script.
* (; &quot;Yellow Court Classic&quot;): a transcription of a Taoist text describing methods of meditation. There are two versions of this text; the shorter one () was copied by Wang in 356.
* (; &quot;Eulogy to a Portrait of Dongfang Shuo&quot;): a transcription of a text authored by the poet Xiaohou Chen about a portrait of Dongfang Shuo, a court jester of the Han dynasty. Wang&#x27;s original copy, written in 356, was reportedly buried in the tomb of his relative, Wang Xiu.
Written in semi-cursive script:
* (; &quot;Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion&quot;): Wang&#x27;s most celebrated work of calligraphy, composed in 353 at the Orchid Pavilion Gathering.
* (; &quot;Letter of Distress and Indignation&quot;): a letter from Wang expressing despair that he is unable to mourn at his ancestors&#x27; tombs in the conquered north. Records indicate that a tracing copy was preserved in the Japanese imperial household and donated to the Shōsōin treasure house in the 8th century.
* (; &quot;Letter to Kong&quot;): a letter from Wang asking about the well-being of one of his friends. Like the , a tracing copy of this letter was among a Japanese imperial collection of Wang&#x27;s calligraphy that was later donated to the Shōsōin.
* (; &quot;Sudden Clearing after a Lively Snowfall&quot;): a letter from Wang addressed to a &quot;Marquis of Zhang&quot; in which he remarks on the clear weather.
* (; &quot;Letter on Presenting Oranges&quot;): a letter from Wang to a friend to accompany a gift of 300 oranges. It is Wang&#x27;s shortest known letter, comprising 12 characters. 
* (; &quot;Ritual to Pray for Good Harvest&quot;): a 15-character fragment of a letter from Wang. Though the art historian Zhang Yanyuan identified the second half of the letter containing the remaining 17 characters, the meaning of the letter is still unclear. Wang appears to reference a ritual or ceremony involving the addressee and nine others. The is the only tracing copy of Wang&#x27;s calligraphy held in a Western collection (the Princeton University Art Museum).
Written in cursive script:
* (; &quot;Seventeen Posts&quot;): a collection of 29 letters from Wang that were reportedly later engraved during the Tang dynasty. The name of the collection is derived from the first two characters in the opening letter.
* (; &quot;National Territory&quot;): a letter from Wang that was later owned by Mi Fu, a calligrapher of the Song dynasty, who treasured it and described it as &quot;the foremost [writing] in existence&quot;.

=== Debates on authenticity ===
The complicated textual history of Wang&#x27;s calligraphy has led to debates over the authenticity of his works, primarily the . During the Song dynasty, the poets Jiang Kui and Lu You began to question the authenticity of the preface. Several centuries later, some scholars of the Qing dynasty rejected the claim that Wang produced the based on arguments that it did not include characters written in clerical script, that its semi-cursive script may not have been developed until after Wang&#x27;s lifetime, and that it was inconsistent with another recorded version, the (; &quot;Preface to the Riverbank Gathering&quot;). They instead hypothesized that it was written by a later calligrapher of the Sui or Tang dynasties, but this was a minority view at the time.

During the 1960s, the question of the authenticity was revived by Guo Moruo, the chairman of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Guo published an article in 1965 rejecting Wang&#x27;s authorship based on the recent discovery of tombs from the Jin dynasty whose inscriptions were written in clerical script. Guo also presented the argument that portions of the , which somberly reflect on the transience of life, were inconsistent with the celebratory nature of the Orchid Pavilion Gathering. He suggested that it was actually written by Zhiyong, a Buddhist monk who was a descendant of Wang. In the wake of the Socialist Education Movement, few scholars were willing to publicly challenge Guo&#x27;s claims, and those who did were attacked by Guo and his political allies in the Chinese Communist Party.

He Jianjun, a scholar of Chinese history, wrote that Guo&#x27;s motivation for challenging the authenticity of the was political, not academic, and that Guo was deliberately trying to subvert &quot;the single most important Chinese work of art of past millennia&quot;, usher in the Cultural Revolution, and establish his own authority in cultural debates. These debates over Wang&#x27;s calligraphy subsided after 1966 as critics shifted their focus to other works such as &quot;Hai Rui Dismissed from Office&quot;. Guo&#x27;s claim that clerical script would have been used exclusively during Wang&#x27;s lifetime was weakened in 1988 upon the discovery of an Eastern Jin tomb with an inscription written in regular script.

== Legacy ==
=== Posthumous reputation ===

Wang&#x27;s works were already popular during his lifetime, and in the centuries after Wang&#x27;s death, collectors continued to seek out his calligraphy. The value of an imperial collection was often judged by the number of works written by the Two Wangs. As Wang Xizhi&#x27;s works were the most valuable part of the collection, they surpassed &quot;their aesthetic value and function as a symbol of power&quot;. Thus, emperors continually sought to expand their collection of Wang&#x27;s calligraphy in order to strengthen their own perceived legitimacy. Around the time of the Tang dynasty, he was designated the &quot;Sage of Calligraphy&quot; (; ), a title that is still used to describe him in the present day.

As a result of Emperor Taizong&#x27;s patronage, Wang is generally considered to be the most significant Chinese calligrapher in history. The , according to Ledderose, is &quot;the most celebrated piece of calligraphy of all time&quot;, admired for both its calligraphy and its text. He is an influential figure in Japanese calligraphy as well. After his calligraphy was established as the defining model in China during the Tang dynasty, it was transmitted to Japan during the Nara and Heian periods. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Heian court standardized Wang&#x27;s semi-cursive and cursive scripts and these were copied by Japanese calligraphers, resulting in a distinctive Japanese style of that time period. Extant tracing copies of Wang&#x27;s work, which are rare, continue to be highly valued. In 2010, a scroll with four lines of Wang&#x27;s calligraphy, copied during the Tang dynasty, was sold at a China Guardian auction in Beijing for ().

Several locations associated with Wang&#x27;s life have become visitor attractions in China. The site of his childhood residence in Linyi is open to tourists and features an &quot;ink pond&quot; where he reportedly washed his brush while writing. In Shaoxing, the site of the Orchid Pavilion contains a stone engraving of the and receives over one million visitors annually, and his tomb is popular with visitors as well. The Tishan Bridge (; ; ) in Shaoxing is named after an anecdote in which Wang took pity on a struggling vendor and inscribed her fans with his calligraphy to increase their value. The fans were easily sold and the old woman reapproached Wang with even more fans, but he declined to sign them and slipped out through a side door.

=== Depictions in art ===

According to an anecdote from the &quot;Jin shu&quot;, Wang once received ten live geese in exchange for transcribing two chapters from the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, a foundational Taoist text. After his lifetime, art theorists such as Guo Xi continued to associate him with geese, creating the narrative that his calligraphic brush technique was inspired by the way that the geese moved their necks. Wang&#x27;s fondness for geese &quot;has come to be &quot;the&quot; emblem of his artistic personality in popular and elite imagination alike&quot;, and his depictions in art typically show him in the presence of geese. A 14th-century rubbing of a painting from the Song dynasty is the earliest known depiction of Wang with geese. A well-known painting, &quot;Wang Xizhi Watching Geese&quot; by Qian Xuan, was painted and is housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Though the Orchid Pavilion Gathering in 353 did not involve geese, artists have often combined the two themes in their paintings of Wang. According to the art historian Kazuko Kameda-Madar, the gathering itself is &quot;one of the most important painting themes in the cultural history of East Asia&quot;. Over time, Chinese and Japanese artists have added other recurring elements to their depictions of the Orchid Pavilion Gathering not mentioned in the , such as saucers in the shape of lotus leaves to carry the goblets of rice wine down the stream and the presence of a young boy stealing a sip of wine.

<doc id="971428" wikidata="Q691782" url="?curid=971428" title="Kung Lao">
<text>Kung Lao (Chinese: 空佬) is a character in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. He debuted in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993) as a Shaolin monk and close friend of series protagonist Liu Kang, and his trademark characteristic is his wide razor-brimmed hat that he uses as a weapon. Kung Lao is depicted as one of the series&#x27; primary heroes, including a main role in the action-adventure spin-off &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot; (2005).

Outside of the games, Kung Lao has appeared in various related media. Reception to the character has been generally positive, particularly in respect to his appearance, special abilities, and Fatality finishing moves.

==Character design and gameplay==
As stated in Kung Lao&#x27;s bio card that after the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game, the creators wanted a monk character other than Liu Kang. According to &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator John Tobias, Kung Lao&#x27;s hat was inspired by the 1964 James Bond movie &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, in which the villain Oddjob threw his derby hat as a deadly weapon. Kung Lao was portrayed by Anthony Marquez in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;; Ed Boon said Marquez was ”one of the best martial artists we worked with.&quot; Liu and Kung Lao were meant to compliment each other. One as the present day chosen one and the other as a reflection of a failed past, yet it was their sense of righteous purpose that bonded their friendship.

Kung Lao can be seen in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, and &quot;Shaolin Monks&quot; wearing the Chinese character which means military/wu shu/martial arts. However, when asked about this character, John Tobias stated that it is Chinese for &quot;war&quot;.

Kung Lao&#x27;s attacks are based on wind-type moves. His most notable attack is the Hat Toss, which could be directed in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, but could not be directed since &quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot;, until &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011). Many of his Fatalities involve the use of his hat to some extent, such as slicing the body in half and decapitation.

According to Prima Games, Kung Lao is one of the cheapest Mortal Kombat characters, where they observe &quot;He can combo almost any jumping attack into his Dive Kick. He even has multiple projectile attacks, one of which he can aim up or down, meaning you can&#x27;t reliably crouch under or jump over it. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, he even had one of the longest dial-a-combos, because his damage clearly wasn&#x27;t high enough already.&quot;

==Appearances==
===&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games===
====Midway games====
Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993), Kung Lao is one of the last known descendants of the Great Kung Lao, a Mortal Kombat champion who lost the title and his life to the Shokan Prince Goro 500 years previously, resulting in the start of corrupt sorcerer Shang Tsung&#x27;s rule over the tournament. Kung Lao was originally chosen to represent the Shaolin in the Mortal Kombat tournament, but he declined due to the consequences of becoming champion. When a portal leading to the otherworldly dimension Outworld is opened and the Shaolin temple is attacked by Baraka and his Tarkatan soldiers, Liu Kang and Kung Lao resolve to travel through the portal themselves and avenge their fallen Shaolin brothers. Kung Lao&#x27;s ultimate goal however was to rebuild the White Lotus Society at the Wu Shi Academy in order to train a new generation of warriors for the coming ages. Following Liu Kang&#x27;s victory over the Outworld tyrant Shao Kahn, the monks return to Earth and begin training the next generation of Shaolin warriors. When Shao Kahn invades Earthrealm in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995), Kung Lao temporarily scraps his plans for reforming the White Lotus Society. While he faces the Kahn in battle, he is ultimately defeated and presumed dead.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot; (1999), Kung Lao had faked his death so he can live a life of peace in respect to the beliefs of his ancestors. However, he is drawn away from his newfound peace to help fight against the fallen Elder God Shinnok&#x27;s forces when word reaches him that Goro is still alive. Kung Lao attacks Goro with a ceremonial strike of vengeance for the Great Kung Lao&#x27;s death. With this act, the two warriors shake hands, ending their conflict.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; (2002), Kung Lao vows revenge for Liu Kang&#x27;s death at the handsof the title sorcerers. Along the way, Kung Lao seeks out advice and training from Outworld martial arts teacher Bo&#x27; Rai Cho. Kung Lao is killed by Deadly Alliance and then were resurrected by the dragon king Onaga to become his slaves in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; (2004). He and the rest of his brainwashed allies were later released from Onaga&#x27;s spell by a partially resurrected Liu Kang and reformed ninja Ermac. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006) describes Kung Lao joins forces with him to bring their former comrades Raiden and Liu Kang under control, with the God of Thunder becoming &quot;as ruthless as Shao Kahn&quot; and Liu Kang&#x27;s corpse selectively slaying various people.

In the action-adventure game &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot; (2005), an alternate depiction of the events between the first and second &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games, Kung Lao&#x27;s character was explored to a greater degree than had been shown in previous titles. In this game, he is portrayed as feeling almost resentful of Liu Kang&#x27;s victory in the Shaolin tournament. A rivalry between the two monks was hence established for the first time. As the two fighters defeated Shang Tsung&#x27;s warriors, they formed a race of sorts to become the Mortal Kombat champion. This rivalry escalated until the two warriors become convinced that the other has been corrupted by Outworld.

====NetherRealm games====
In the rebooted continuity of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), Raiden receives foreboding visions from his future self and attempts to change the timeline of events that lead to Armageddon. He allows Kung Lao to fight in the second tournament. Kung Lao defeats Shang Tsung, Quan Chi, and the Shokan Kintaro, but he is killed by Shao Kahn. Following Shao Kahn&#x27;s failed invasion of Earthrealm, Kung Lao is resurrected as one of Quan Chi&#x27;s undead revenant slaves. Kung Lao returns in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015), continuing to serve Quan Chi and Shinnok in the Netherrealm.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019), past iterations of Kung Lao and Liu Kang are brought to the present due to the machinations of the keeper of time Kronika. After learning the Shaolin Temple was attacked by Kronika&#x27;s forces, the monks head out to investigate, only to encounter their revenant selves and fail to stop Kronika&#x27;s henchman Geras from stealing vials of Earthrealm&#x27;s lifeforce. They later help Kitana defeat Shao Kahn and lead the surviving Shaolin monks alongside the combined Earthrealm/Outworld armies in assaulting Kronika&#x27;s Keep while their revenants attempt to stop them.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, the Kung Lao from Liu Kang&#x27;s new timeline was born and raised in the village of Fengjian, where he worked in the fields alongside his childhood friend, Raiden. In one of his intros with Liu Kang, the Great Kung Lao&#x27;s victory is revealed to be hidden from the Earthrealm&#x27;s public at the said ancestor&#x27;s behest. After the two were trained in martial arts by Madam Bo, Liu Kang recruits them to be defenders of Earthrealm in the tournament against Outworld alongside Johnny Cage and Kenshi. The fight with Sub-Zero Liu Kang set up to test him also inspired him to develop his razor-sharp hat. After Raiden becomes Earthrealm&#x27;s champion and wins the tournament for them, Liu Kang sends the remaining warriors to investigate Shang Tsung. To prevent Titan Shang Tsung from destroying his timeline, Liu Kang summons Titan incarnations of Kitana, Kung Lao, and Raiden to assist him. After Shang Tsung&#x27;s Titan counterpart is defeated, Kung Lao becomes an instructor at the Wu Shi Academy, with Shujinko becoming one of his first students. Due to Kung Lao not teaching him humility, Shujinko became a threat to the realms before Liu Kang erased his memories. Kung Lao agreed to train him again, but with Raiden&#x27;s help.

===Other media===
Kung Lao was absent from the 1990s &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; feature films, with the producers of the 1995 film opting to combine his character with that of Liu Kang, in turn making Liu the descendant of The Great Kung Lao. Series co-creator John Tobias said in a 2021 interview that this decision &quot;caus[ed] confusion in our games for years to follow&quot; and &quot;was a mistake.&quot; Kung Lao appeared in a supporting role in the 2021 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; reboot film as one of Raiden&#x27;s chosen Earthrealm defenders, but he is killed late in the film by main antagonist Shang Tsung. He was played by Max Huang, a former member of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. Huang will reprise the role in the upcoming sequel &quot;Mortal Kombat 2&quot;.

Kung Lao appeared in the first and last episodes in the 2013 second season of the web series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot;, and was played by Mark Dacascos.

Matthew Yang King voiced Kung Lao in the 2021 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms&quot;, a retelling of the first Mortal Kombat tournament in which he is again one of Earthrealm&#x27;s chosen warriors to compete, but he is ultimately killed in battle by Shao Kahn.

Kung Lao was the main protagonist of Jeff Rovin&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; novel that featured an original story set before the events of the 1992 game. In Malibu Comics&#x27; &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; comic series that ran from 1994 to 1995, his backstory is altered in that he is an exile in Outworld due to the failure of his ancestor and the fall of his lineage. He debuts in the sixth and final issue of the 1994 &quot;Blood &amp; Thunder&quot; miniseries when he rescues a near-death Liu Kang after the latter is severely wounded by Kano, and in the 1995 &quot;Battlewave&quot; miniseries, he joins with Kitana, Baraka and Sub-Zero in an attempt to overthrow the Outworld emperor Shao Kahn. He lastly featured in a July 1995 one-shot, &quot;Rising Son&quot;, which depicted his battle against Shang Tsung and his shapeshifting mind tricks.

In the 1998 syndicated television series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Conquest&quot;, The Great Kung Lao (played by Paolo Montalban) is one of the show&#x27;s main protagonists alongside original characters Siro (Daniel Bernhardt) and Taja (Kristanna Loken). After becoming Grand Champion, the thunder god Raiden tells Kung Lao that, because he was the last defending warrior of Earthrealm, he is now destined to train new warriors to compete against Shao Kahn&#x27;s forces for the next Mortal Kombat. The series ran for one season of 22 episodes.

==Reception==
Kung Lao has received generally positive critical reception and often cited as one of the best fighters from the franchise. Kung Lao and Liu Kang&#x27;s team ups were praised with &quot;IGN&quot; saying they made the series &quot;at its best&quot; whenever they joined forces. Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; wrote that Kung Lao &quot;was easily one of the most fun to play and carried a unique style,&quot; but criticized his story as being less influential than the rest of the cast when it comes to moving the plot In his 2022 book &quot;Mortal Kombat: Games of Death&quot;, David Church noted Kung Lao among &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;″s &quot;nonwhite upper-tier characters&quot; while exploring the topic of racial stereotyping in fighting games.

The character&#x27;s finishing moves have been positively received throughout his series appearances. with Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot finding his original &quot;Hat Split&quot; Fatality from &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; was a classic move. Moreover, K. Thor Jensen of UGO called it one of the most gruesome finishing move in video games, and &quot;Complex&quot; ranked it fifth in their listing of the &quot;50 Craziest Video Game Fatalities&quot;. while &quot;Den of Geek&quot; rated the finisher among the best from &quot;MKII&quot;, praising both the animation and gore. Meanwhile, Kung Lao&#x27;s &quot;Buzzsaw&quot; Fatality was considered among the best from the 2011 reboot game, and was cited as a factor in the game being banned in Australia. &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator Ed Boon commented that it was &quot;probably the most painful-looking Fatality ever made&quot;.

Reception to Kung Lao&#x27;s alternate-media depictions has been generally positive. Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; sin that in &quot;MK Legacy&quot;, Dacascos&#x27; performance stands out positively but lamented the season season &quot;kept the focus more squarely on Liu Kang and Kung Lao throughout.&quot; &quot;Screen Rant&quot; wrote that &quot;standout performances&quot; such as Dacascos&#x27; were &quot;undermined slightly by stilted deliveries from some of the extras that flesh out flashback scenes.&quot; Carl Lyon of Fearnet similarly praised casting of Kung Lao and conversely felt the character was &quot;woefully underused&quot; in the series.

Gene Park of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that Kung Lao &quot;makes one of the more exciting debuts&quot; in the 2021 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; film, adding that that while he was an appealing mentor, the narrative poorly treats him especially with his highly gory death scene. Jeffrey Harris of 411Mania wrote that supporting characters like Kung Lao were &quot;marginalized at the price of serving the contrived journey of discovery for [main protagonist] Cole Young&quot;, and while Huang was &quot;not great&quot; in the role, he and Ludi Lin (Liu Kang) &quot;show[ed] enough that the movie probably should have been about them&quot;. Wesley Yin-Poole of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; and lamented the poor handling of the Shaolin Monks. Rosie Knight of &quot;Nerdist&quot; praised the strong bond the two monks share. Max Huang stated enjoyed the inclusion of Kung Lao thanks as he believes it was due to his relationship with Liu Kang. In regards to &quot;Battle of the Realms&quot; IGN panned the poor handling of the character especially because he does not have interactions with Liu Kang. In general, Sam Stone of Comic Book Resources noted the character&#x27;s deaths in both the animated and live-action films released in the same year made the character more of a plot device to show the risk the heroes are facing.

<text>In applied statistics, total least squares is a type of errors-in-variables regression, a least squares data modeling technique in which observational errors on both dependent and independent variables are taken into account. It is a generalization of Deming regression and also of orthogonal regression, and can be applied to both linear and non-linear models.

The total least squares approximation of the data is generically equivalent to the best, in the Frobenius norm, low-rank approximation of the data matrix.

== Linear model ==

===Background===

In the least squares method of data modeling, the objective function to be minimized, &quot;S&quot;, is a quadratic form:
:formula_1
where &quot;r&quot; is the vector of residuals and &quot;W&quot; is a weighting matrix. In linear least squares the model contains equations which are linear in the parameters appearing in the parameter vector formula_2, so the residuals are given by
:formula_3
There are &quot;m&quot; observations in y and &quot;n&quot; parameters in β with &quot;m&quot;&gt;&quot;n&quot;. X is a &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix whose elements are either constants or functions of the independent variables, x. The weight matrix W is, ideally, the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix formula_4 of the observations y. The independent variables are assumed to be error-free. The parameter estimates are found by setting the gradient equations to zero, which results in the normal equations
:formula_5

===Allowing observation errors in all variables===

Now, suppose that both x and y are observed subject to error, with variance-covariance matrices formula_6 and formula_4 respectively. In this case the objective function can be written as
:formula_8
where formula_9 and formula_10 are the residuals in x and y respectively. Clearly these residuals cannot be independent of each other, but they must be constrained by some kind of relationship. Writing the model function as formula_11, the constraints are expressed by &quot;m&quot; condition equations.

:formula_12
Thus, the problem is to minimize the objective function subject to the &quot;m&quot; constraints. It is solved by the use of Lagrange multipliers. After some algebraic manipulations, the result is obtained.

:formula_13

or alternatively formula_14
where M is the variance-covariance matrix relative to both independent and dependent variables.
:formula_15

=== Example ===

When the data errors are uncorrelated, all matrices M and W are diagonal. Then, take the example of straight line fitting.
:formula_16
in this case
:formula_17
showing how the variance at the &quot;i&quot;th point is determined by the variances of both independent and dependent variables and by the model being used to fit the data. The expression may be generalized by noting that the parameter formula_18 is the slope of the line.
:formula_19

An expression of this type is used in fitting pH titration data where a small error on &quot;x&quot; translates to a large error on y when the slope is large.

=== Algebraic point of view ===
As was shown in 1980 by Golub and Van Loan, the TLS problem does not have a solution in general. The following considers the simple case where a unique solution exists without making any particular assumptions.

The computation of the TLS using singular value decomposition (SVD) is described in standard texts. We can solve the equation 
:formula_20
for &quot;B&quot; where &quot;X&quot; is &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; is &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;k&quot;. 

That is, we seek to find &quot;B&quot; that minimizes error matrices &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; for &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; respectively. That is,
:formula_21
where formula_22 is the augmented matrix with &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; side by side and formula_23 is the Frobenius norm, the square root of the sum of the squares of all entries in a matrix and so equivalently the square root of the sum of squares of the lengths of the rows or columns of the matrix.

This can be rewritten as
:formula_24
where formula_25 is the formula_26 identity matrix.
The goal is then to find formula_22 that reduces the rank of formula_28 by &quot;k&quot;. Define formula_29 to be the singular value decomposition of the augmented matrix formula_28.
:formula_31
where &quot;V&quot; is partitioned into blocks corresponding to the shape of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.

Using the Eckart–Young theorem, the approximation minimising the norm of the error is such that matrices formula_32 and formula_33 are unchanged, while the smallest formula_34 singular values are replaced with zeroes. That is, we want
:formula_35
so by linearity,
:formula_36
We can then remove blocks from the &quot;U&quot; and Σ matrices, simplifying to
:formula_37
This provides &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; so that 
:formula_38
Now if formula_39 is nonsingular, which is not always the case (note that the behavior of TLS when formula_39 is singular is not well understood yet), we can then right multiply both sides by formula_41 to bring the bottom block of the right matrix to the negative identity, giving
: formula_42
and so
:formula_43

A naive GNU Octave implementation of this is:
function B = tls(X, Y)

[m n] = size(X); % n is the width of X (X is m by n)
Z = [X Y]; % Z is X augmented with Y.
[U S V] = svd(Z, 0); % find the SVD of Z.
VXY = V(1:n, 1+n:end); % Take the block of V consisting of the first n rows and the n+1 to last column
VYY = V(1+n:end, 1+n:end); % Take the bottom-right block of V.
B = -VXY / VYY;

end
The way described above of solving the problem, which requires that the matrix formula_39 is nonsingular, can be slightly extended by the so-called &quot;classical TLS algorithm&quot;.

=== Computation ===

The standard implementation of classical TLS algorithm is available through Netlib, see also. All modern implementations based, for example, on solving a sequence of ordinary least squares problems, approximate the matrix formula_45 (denoted formula_46 in the literature), as introduced by Van Huffel and Vandewalle. It is worth noting, that this formula_45 is, however, &quot;not the TLS solution&quot; in many cases.

== Non-linear model ==
For non-linear systems similar reasoning shows that the normal equations for an iteration cycle can be written as
:formula_48
where formula_49 is the Jacobian matrix.

== Geometrical interpretation ==
When the independent variable is error-free a residual represents the &quot;vertical&quot; distance between the observed data point and the fitted curve (or surface). In total least squares a residual represents the distance between a data point and the fitted curve measured along some direction. In fact, if both variables are measured in the same units and the errors on both variables are the same, then the residual represents the shortest distance between the data point and the fitted curve, that is, the residual vector is perpendicular to the tangent of the curve. For this reason, this type of regression is sometimes called &quot;two dimensional Euclidean regression&quot; (Stein, 1983) or &quot;orthogonal regression&quot;.

== Scale invariant methods ==
A serious difficulty arises if the variables are not measured in the same units. First consider measuring distance between a data point and the line: what are the measurement units for this distance? If we consider measuring distance based on Pythagoras&#x27; Theorem then it is clear that we shall be adding quantities measured in different units, which is meaningless. Secondly, if we rescale one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different line). To avoid these problems it is sometimes suggested that we convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However, there are various ways of doing this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the Mahalanobis distance from the points to the line, providing a maximum-likelihood solution; the unknown precisions could be found via analysis of variance.

In short, total least squares does not have the property of units-invariance—i.e. it is not scale invariant. For a meaningful model we require this property to hold. A way forward is to realise that residuals (distances) measured in different units can be combined if multiplication is used instead of addition. Consider fitting a line: for each data point the product of the vertical and horizontal residuals equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the residual lines and the fitted line. We choose the line which minimizes the sum of these areas. Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson proved in 1942 that, in two dimensions, it is the only line expressible solely in terms of the ratios of standard deviations and the correlation coefficient which (1) fits the correct equation when the observations fall on a straight line, (2) exhibits scale invariance, and (3) exhibits invariance under interchange of variables. This solution has been rediscovered in different disciplines and is variously known as standardised major axis (Ricker 1975, Warton et al., 2006), the reduced major axis, the geometric mean functional relationship (Draper and Smith, 1998), least products regression, diagonal regression, line of organic correlation, and the least areas line (Tofallis, 2002). 

Tofallis (2015, 2023) has extended this approach to deal with multiple variables. The calculations are simpler than for total least squares as they only require knowledge of covariances, and can be computed using standard spreadsheet functions.

<doc id="971443" wikidata="Q282883" url="?curid=971443" title="Shihab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi">
<text>Shihāb ad-Dīn Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardī (, also known as Sohrevardi) (1154–1191) was a Persian philosopher and founder of the Iranian school of Illuminationism, an important school in Islamic philosophy. The &quot;light&quot; in his &quot;Philosophy of Illumination&quot; is the source of knowledge. He is referred to by the honorific title &quot;Shaikh al-ʿIshraq&quot; &quot;Master of Illumination&quot; and &quot;Shaikh al-Maqtul&quot; &quot;the Murdered Master&quot;, in reference to his execution for heresy. Mulla Sadra, the Persian sage of the Safavid era described Suhrawardi as the &quot;Reviver of the Traces of the Pahlavi (Iranian) Sages&quot;, and Suhrawardi, in his magnum opus &quot;The Philosophy of Illumination&quot;, thought of himself as a reviver or resuscitator of the ancient tradition of Persian wisdom. Suhrawardi provided a new Platonic critique of the peripatetic school of Avicenna that was dominant at his times, and that critique involved the fields of Logic, Physics, Epistemology, Psychology, and Metaphysics.

==Life==
Of Persian stock, Suhrawardi was born in 1154 in Suhraward, a village located between the towns of Zanjan and Bijar Garrus in Iran. He learned wisdom and jurisprudence in the city of Maragheh. His teacher was Majd al-Dīn Jīlī who was also Fakhr al-Din al-Razi’s teacher. He then went to Iraq and Syria for several years and developed his knowledge while he was there.

His life spanned a period of less than forty years during which he produced a series of works that established him as the founder of a new school of philosophy, called &quot;Illuminism&quot; (&quot;hikmat al-Ishraq&quot;). According to Henry Corbin, Suhrawardi &quot;came later to be called the Master of Illumination (&quot;Shaikh-i-Ishraq&quot;) because his great aim was the renaissance of ancient Iranian wisdom&quot;. which Corbin specifies in various ways as the &quot;project of reviving the philosophy of ancient Persia&quot;.

In 1186, at the age of thirty-two, he completed his magnum opus, &quot;The Philosophy of Illumination.&quot;

There are several contradictory reports of his death. The most commonly held view is that he was executed sometime between 1191 and 1208 in Aleppo on charges of cultivating Batini teachings and philosophy, by the order of al-Malik al-Zahir, son of Saladin. Other traditions hold that he starved himself to death, others tell that he was suffocated or thrown from the wall of the fortress, then burned by some people.

== Influences on Suhrawardi ==
Suhrawardi was a strong defender of Peripatetic philosophy, until he was influenced by those whom he described as those who &quot;have traveled the path of God&quot;, like - as noted by Suhrawardi - Plato from the Greek tradition, Hermes (Thoth) from Egypt, and Pythagoras the Phoenician, and also figures in the Persian tradition. His philosophical project aims to revive the lost &quot;hikma&quot; of east and west.

It is also apparent that Suhrawardi was strongly influenced by the Sufi tradition, bearing in mind his mystical spiritual journeys that he considered a necessary prerequisite for understanding his Illuminationist philosophy. Zoroastrianism also appears to have influenced Suhrawardi, as its symbols appear in some of his works.

==Teachings==

Arising out of peripatetic philosophy as developed by Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Suhrawardi&#x27;s illuminationist philosophy is critical of several of Ibn Sina&#x27;s positions and radically departs from him in creating a symbolic language (mainly derived from ancient Iranian culture or &quot;Farhang-e Khosravani&quot;) to give expression to his wisdom (&quot;hikma&quot;).

Suhrawardi taught a complex and profound emanationist cosmology, in which all creation is a successive outflow from the original Supreme Light of Lights (&quot;Nur al-Anwar&quot;). The fundamental of his philosophy is pure immaterial light, where nothing is manifest, and which unfolds from the Light of Lights in a descending order of ever-diminishing intensity and, through complex interaction, gives rise to a &quot;horizontal&quot; array of lights, similar in conception to Platonic forms, that governs mundane reality. In other words, the universe and all levels of existence are but varying degrees of Light—light and darkness. In his division of bodies, he categorises objects in terms of their reception or non-reception of light.

Suhrawardi considers a previous existence for every soul in the angelic realm before its descent to the realm of the body. The soul is divided into two parts, one remains in heaven and the other descends into the dungeon of the body. The human soul is always sad because it has been divorced from its other half. Therefore, it aspires to become reunited with it. The soul can only reach felicity again when it is united with its celestial part, which has remained in heaven. He holds that the soul should seek felicity by detaching itself from its tenebrous body and worldly matters and access the world of immaterial lights. The souls of the gnostics and saints, after leaving the body, ascend even above the angelic world to enjoy proximity to the Supreme Light, which is the only absolute Reality.

Suhrawardi elaborated the neoplatonic idea of an independent intermediary world, the imaginal world (&quot;ʿalam-i mithal&quot; عالم مثال). His views have exerted a powerful influence down to this day, particularly through Mulla Sadra’s combined peripatetic and illuminationist description of reality.

==Influence==
Suhrawardi&#x27;s Illuminationist project was to have far-reaching consequences for Islamic philosophy in Shi&#x27;ite Iran. His teachings had a strong influence on subsequent esoteric Iranian thought and the idea of “Decisive Necessity” is believed to be one of the most important innovations in the history of logical philosophical speculation, stressed by the majority of Muslim logicians and philosophers. In the 17th century, it was to initiate an Illuminationist Zoroastrian revival in the figure of the 16th century sage Azar Kayvan.

Many later philosophers were influenced by the Illuminationist philosophy of Suhrawardi including Athir al-Din al-Abhari, Al-Allama al-Hilli, Ibn Abi Jumhur al-Ahsa&#x27;i, Jalal al-Din Davani, and also Mulla Sadra.

==Suhrawardi and pre-Islamic Iranian thought==
Suhrawardi thought of himself as a reviver or resuscitator of the ancient Persian wisdom. He states in &quot;Hikmat al-&#x27;Ishraq&quot; that:

Suhrawardi uses pre-Islamic Iranian gnosis, synthesising it with Greek and Islamic wisdom. The main influence from pre-Islamic Iranian thought on Suhrawardi is in the realm of angelology and cosmology. He believed that the ancient Persians&#x27; wisdom was shared by Greek philosophers such as Plato as well as by the Egyptian Hermes and considered his philosophy of illumination a rediscovery of this ancient wisdom. According to Nasr, Suhrawardi provides an important link between the thought of pre-Islamic and post-Islamic Iran and a harmonious synthesis between the two. And Henry Corbin states: &quot;In northwestern Iran, Sohravardi (d. 1191) carried out the great project of reviving the wisdom or theosophy of ancient pre-Islamic Zoroastrian Iran.&quot;

In his work &quot;Alwah Imadi&quot;, Suhrawardi offers an esoteric interpretation of Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Epic of Kings&quot; (&quot;Shah Nama&quot;) in which figures such as Fereydun, Zahak, Kay Khusraw and Jamshid are seen as manifestations of the divine light. Seyyed Hossein Nasr states: &quot;Alwah &#x27;Imadi is one of the most brilliant works of Suhrawardi in which the tales of ancient Persia and the wisdom of gnosis of antiquity in the context of the esoteric meaning of the Quran have been synthesized&quot;.

In this Persian work &quot;Partaw Nama&quot; and his main Arabic work &quot;Hikmat al-Ishraq&quot;, Suhrawardi makes extensive use of Zoroastrian symbolism and his elaborate angelology is also based on Zoroastrian models. The supreme light he calls both by its Quranic and Mazdean names, &quot;al-nur al-a&#x27;zam&quot; (the Supreme Light) and &quot;Vohuman&quot; (&quot;Bahman&quot;). Suhrawardi refers to the &quot;hukamayya-fars&quot; (Persian philosophers) as major practitioners of his &quot;Ishraqi&quot; wisdom and considers Zoroaster, Jamasp, Goshtasp, Kay Khusraw, Frashostar and Bozorgmehr as possessors of this ancient wisdom.

Among pre-Islamic Iranian symbols and concepts used by Suhrawardi are: &quot;minu&quot; (incorporeal world), &quot;giti&quot; (corporeal world), &quot;Surush&quot; (messenger, Gabriel), &quot;Farvardin&quot; (the lower world), &quot;gawhar&quot; (pure essence), &quot;Bahram&quot;, &quot;Hurakhsh&quot; (the Sun), &quot;shahriyar&quot; (archetype of species), &quot;isfahbad&quot; (light in the body), &quot;Amordad&quot; (Zoroastrian angel), &quot;Shahrivar&quot; (Zoroastrian angel), and the &quot;Kiyani Khvarenah&quot;.

With regards to the pre-Islamic Iranian concept of Khvarenah (glory), Suhrawardi mentions:&quot;Whoever knows philosophy (&quot;hikmat&quot;) and perseveres in thanking and sanctifying the Light of the Lights, will be endowed with royal glory (&quot;kharreh&quot;) and with luminous splendor (&quot;farreh&quot;), and—as we have said elsewhere—divine light will further bestow upon him the cloak of royal power and value. Such a person shall then become the natural ruler of the universe. He shall be given aid from the high heavens, and whatever he commands shall be obeyed; and his dreams and inspirations will reach their uppermost, perfect pinnacle.&quot;

و هر که حکمت بداند و بر سپاس و تقدیس نور الانوار مداومت نماید، او را خرّه کیانی بدهند و فرّ نورانی ببخشند، و بارقی الاهی او را کسوت هیبت و بهاء بپوشاند و رئیس طبیعی شود عالم را، و او را از عالم اعلا نصرت رسد و سخن او در عالم علوی مسموع باشد، و خواب و الهام او به کمال رسد.»

==Suhrawardi and Illumination school==
According to Hossein Nasr since Sheykh Ishraq was not translated into Western languages in the medieval period, Europeans had little knowledge about Suhrawardi and his philosophy. His school is ignored even now by later scholars. Sheykh Ishraq tried to pose a new perspective on questions like the question of Existence. He not only caused peripatetic philosophers to confront new questions but also gave new life to the body of philosophy after Avicenna.

According to John Walbridge, Suhrawardi&#x27;s critique on peripatetic philosophy can be counted as an important turning point for his successors. Suhrawardi tried to criticize Avicennism in a new approach. Although Suhrawardi first was a pioneer of peripatetic philosophy, he later became a Platonist following a mystical experience. He is also considered as the one who revived the ancient wisdom of Persia by his philosophy of Illumination. His followers include other Kurdish and Persian philosophers such as Shahrazuri and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi who tried to continue the way of their teacher. Suhrawardi made a distinction between two approaches in his Illuminationism: one approach is discursive and the other is intuitive.

==Scholarly views on Suhrawardi==
There are different and contradictory views regarding the character of Suhrawardi&#x27;s school. Some scholars such as Hossein Ziai believe that the most important aspects of his thought are his logic and critique of the peripatetic conception of definitions. On the other hand, scholars like Mehdi Hairi and Sayyid Jalal Addin Ashtiyyani, believe that Suhrawardi remained within the framework of peripatetic and neo-Avicennian philosophy. Mehdi Amin Razavi criticises both these groups for ignoring the mystical dimension of Suhrawardi&#x27;s writings. In turn, scholars such as Henry Corbin and Hossein Nasr view Suhrawardi as a theosophist and focus on the mystical dimension of his work. Viewing in another way, Nadia Maftouni has analysed Suhrawardi&#x27;s works to figure out the elements of philosophy as a way of life. As she holds, the priority of practical reason to theoretical reason, the emphasis on intuition, taking philosophy as a practice of attaining optional death, and proposing ways to heal mental diseases may well be considered the main elements of philosophy as a way of life in Suhrawardi&#x27;s allegorical treatises.

==Writings==
Suhrawardi left over 50 writings in Persian and Arabic.

==Gameplay==

A sequel of sorts to &quot;Attack of the Mutant Camels&quot; (also known as &quot;Advance of the Mega-Camels&quot;), this time the player controls a camel. The camel is armed by default with small blue shots, but can obtain other weapons and weapon upgrades by collecting power-ups during the game. In all but the Commodore 64 version, the camel is teamed up with a bipedal goat, who can be controlled either by the computer or by a second player. If the camel crouches down, the goat can mount it and ride on its back, enabling them to focus their firepower.

The game features a host of bizarre enemies, including: British telephone boxes, Polo mints, exploding sheep, skiing kangaroos, guys sitting on flying toilets, and even the jet plane controlled by the player in &quot;Attack of the Mutant Camels&quot; and a wave of Jeff Minters. In versions other than the Commodore 64 version, a variety of power-ups are available, including ecstasy tablets (for a turn of speed), spliffs (to fly over life&#x27;s troubles), and apples (because they&#x27;re good for you).

Unlike &quot;Attack of the Mutant Camels&quot;, it is possible for the player to win &quot;Revenge&quot;. After 42 waves of enemies are defeated the player is declared the winner. In the Commodore 64 version, this was indicated simply by the message &quot;WELL DONE! YOU HAVE SAVED CAMELKIND!&quot; being briefly flashed over the playfield before the game restarted on the first level.

==Development==
&quot;Revenge of the Mutant Camels&quot; was announced in the Dec 1983/Jan 1984 issue of &quot;Commodore Horizons&quot; with a prospective release for mid-December 1984. The game was written over a two month period.

Ideas for various attack waves were created by Minter whilst on holiday in Crete and written down in a notebook. An innovation at the time was that this was the first UK program to use a fast loader – the German TURBO system. Minter was influenced by the reaction to the game &quot;Manic Miner&quot; having 20 levels, and so improved on this by creating 42 different levels for &quot;Revenge&quot;.

The theme music for the Commodore 64 version was arranged by James Lisney and was based on &quot;Ballet égyptien&quot; by Alexandre Luigini.

==Legacy==
Llamasoft developed a sequel to &quot;Revenge of the Mutant Camels&quot; entitled &quot;Revenge of the Mutant Camels II&quot; for the PC. It was published by Kool Dog Entertainment, a division of Guildhall Leisure which has since closed down. Due to poor sales and reception the title was withdrawn from shelves just weeks after release. The plot is a continuation of the story from the original Revenge of the Mutant Camels.

For Amiga, &quot;Revenge of Mutant Camels II&quot; was released with poor reception by Mastertronic in 1988. This release did not involve Minter himself, but in 1992 Minter released his own Amiga version entitled simply &quot;Revenge of the Mutant Camels&quot; as a shareware game (this is similar to the Atari ST version).

Almost 40 years after its first release, in 2021 Jeff Minter fixed a bug on collision detection in the Commodore 64 version.

<text>David Peter Hemery, (born 18 July 1944) is a British former track and field athlete, best known as the winner of the 400 metres hurdles at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.

==Early life==
Hemery was born in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, but his father&#x27;s accounting work took the family to the United States, where he attended school and graduated from Boston University. At one point the family had returned to Britain for a time, and Hemery moved back and forth across the Atlantic during his training.

==Athletics career==
Hemery&#x27;s first International title came at the 1966 Commonwealth Games, where he won the 120 yd hurdles in 14.1 seconds, a title he retained four years later at the 1970 Commonwealth Games (by then it was the 110m hurdles which he won in 13.8 seconds). at 3:35.

At the Mexico City Olympics in 1968, Hemery won the 400m hurdles in 48.12 seconds, a new world record. His margin of victory was the largest since 1924, beating second-placed Gerhard Hennige from West Germany by almost a second. After Hemery crossed the line BBC commentator David Coleman famously exclaimed &quot;Who cares who&#x27;s third – it doesn&#x27;t matter!&quot; Hemery&#x27;s British teammate John Sherwood turned out to be the bronze medal winner in a close finish that had to be settled by photo finish. Hemery&#x27;s performance helped him win the 1968 BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

In 1969, Hemery won a silver at the European Championships in the 110m hurdles, but missed the next European Championships in 1971 due to injury. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Hemery defended his title and finished third, behind John Akii-Bua from Uganda and Ralph Mann from the United States. He was also a member of the silver medal-winning British 4 × 400 m relay team, one of whose members was David Jenkins.

==Superstars==
David Hemery won the first ever British Superstars competition, held in 1973, registering a second victory in 1976, and was recognised as Britain&#x27;s best Superstar from 1973 to 1977.

As a recently retired athlete, Hemery was free to participate in the professional Superstars contests and keep any prize money he won – unlike many other competitors (like Kjell Isaksson or Andy Ripley). Noticing the very high standard of competition within a short time of the event starting, Hemery created his own training regime, becoming adept at the gymnasium tests and canoeing and propelling himself into national fame.

After winning the original British title, Hemery then entered the 1974 event though he was struggling with illness. Eventually narrowly beaten by John Conteh, Hemery then went on to the 1975 European contest where he was beaten again, this time by Ties Kruize. When Kruize suffered serious injuries in a car crash before the final, Hemery was invited to participate and performed bravely, scoring points in every event. He was soundly beaten by Kjell Isaksson, but could still finish second. The rules for European Superstars allowed athletes to compete in &quot;near specialist&quot; events with a handicap, meaning that both Hemery and Isaksson were allowed to run in the 100m and Steeplechase, but only after giving the other finalists a head start. In the final 600m Steeplechase event Hemery had to make up a 100m handicap on his rivals in order to finish in overall second, and valiantly did so, but only after again falling badly at the water jump. Hitting the ground hard while challenging Isaksson for the lead, Hemery rose with a grimace of pain on his face then sprinted for the line, grabbing third. However, as soon as the race was over he collapsed, with the TV cameras showing huge swelling to his injured leg – he had run the last 100m with badly torn ankle ligaments.

In 1976 Hemery won back his British title with a dominating performance. He could not qualify for the European Final this year (beaten by Isaksson again), so he then tried his hand at the American version, qualifying for the final before finishing a disappointing 11th. Because of this sojourn to the US, Hemery was not eligible to compete in the inaugural 1977 World Final, and he did not compete again in individual Superstars again until the 1981 Challenge of the Champions, where he finished joint fourth with his great hurdling rival John Sherwood. Winning the 1983 Past Masters event enabled him to compete in the 1984 International Final (where he finished third, though 40 years old).

===Superstars record===
==Later life==
After his running career, Hemery worked as a coach in the United States and Great Britain. He returned to his alma mater, Boston University, at which as track coach he was widely admired by his student athletes and in which post he succeeded in recruiting many top-notch British runners to Boston University. In the 1969 New Year Honours he was appointed a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE), before being promoted to Commander (CBE) in the 2003 Birthday Honours, in both cases for services to athletics. He received a master&#x27;s degree in education from Harvard University. For a period in the 1970s he taught at the famous English school Millfield. In 1998, he was elected as the first president of UK Athletics. In 2011 Hemery became the first Briton to be awarded the European Olympic Committee&#x27;s Laurel Award for services to sport. In 2015, he ran the London Marathon to raise money for the charity that he had founded - &#x27;21st Century Legacy&#x27;.

In 2016, Hemery was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Wiltshire.

<doc id="971457" wikidata="Q1647117" url="?curid=971457" title="RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)">
<text>Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, commonly referred to as RNAS Yeovilton, (HMS &quot;Heron&quot;) is an airbase of the Royal Navy, sited a few miles north of Yeovil, in the English county of Somerset. It is one of two active Fleet Air Arm bases, the other being RNAS Culdrose. RNAS Yeovilton is currently home to the Royal Navy Wildcat HMA2, along with Army Air Corps Wildcat AH1 helicopters, as well as the Royal Navy&#x27;s Commando Helicopter Force Merlin HCi3/4/4A and Wildcat AH1 helicopters.

The site consists of of airfield sites, plus ranges and minor estates. Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Yeovilton is a large multi-role air station, with an annual budget of some £61 million. The airfield is also home to the Fleet Air Arm Museum, and until 2019 the station hosted an annual Air Day in July.

==History==
In , the potential of the land at Yeovilton for use as an airfield was spotted by Westland Aircraft&#x27;s chief test pilot Harald Penrose, and an offer was made to buy the land. The owners, however, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of the Church of England, refused to sell it. In 1939, the Admiralty Air Division commandeered of the land, and work began on the construction of the site. The runways being completed in 1941, despite problems with poor drainage. A main runway of and three subsidiary runways each of had been constructed.
750 Naval Air Squadron was formed at RNAS Ford on , from the Royal Navy Observer School, but after Ford was bombed early in the war, it moved to RNAS Yeovilton. They were joined by 751 and 752 Squadrons, with the Naval Air Fighter School soon following. In addition, Westland Aircraft developed a repair facility at the site. 

From 1940 on, the site was subjected to Luftwaffe bombing on several occasions. 794 Naval Air Squadron was the first to be formed at the base, and served to train other squadrons to practise aerial gunnery, and part of one of the runways was marked up as a flight deck to practise landing on an aircraft carrier. 827 Naval Air Squadron was also stationed at Yeovilton operating Fairey Albacores and later Barracudas starting in May 1943, becoming the first squadron to receive Barracudas in any substantial number. Several units which were preparing for embarkation were also stationed at the site during the Second World War. Because of pressure on space at the airfield, satellite sites were set up at Charlton Horethorne and Henstridge in 1942. A centre for Air Direction Radar was also established at Speckington Manor on the edge of the airfield.

After the end of the war, Yeovilton became one of the main demobilisation centres for the Royal Navy, with many of the men helping to refurbish the runways while they stayed at the base. In 1952, Yeovilton became the shore base for the fleets&#x27; all-weather fighters. The runways were further extended by Taylor Woodrow in 1952 and 1957 to cope with jet aircraft. In May 1953, it became the headquarters of Flag Officer Flying Training.
During the 1960s, further development work was undertaken, with the School of Fighter Direction returning to the site, and the Sea Venoms being replaced by the de Havilland Sea Vixens then in turn, by the McDonnell-Douglas Phantom FG1 as a carrier-borne fighter. The 1970s saw the Flag Officer, Naval Air Command (FONAC), transferring from RNAS Lee-on-Solent. Royal Navy fixed wing operations were phased out, and the Phantoms transferred to the Royal Air Force (RAF). The base remained as the home of the Commando Helicopter Squadrons, using the Wessex HU5 and later the Sea King HC4, and the fixed wing Fleet Requirements and Aircraft Direction Unit (FRADU), and became the main shore base for the Navy&#x27;s fleet of Sea Harrier FRS1 (and later, FA2). A ski-jump (now removed) was installed to enable practice of ski-jump assisted take-offs.

In the mid 1980s, Defence Estates announced that many of the Royal Navy ratings married quarters at RNAS Yeovilton were surplus to requirements. As a result, The Welbeck Estate Group acquired in the nearby town of Ilchester two entire estates of apartments in Hermes Place and Lyster Close that were used by personnel at HMS &quot;Heron&quot;. (Note that while &#x27;HMS&#x27; is typically a designation for a ship, the Royal Navy also used it for land-based establishments, known as a &#x27;stone frigate&#x27;.) These were refurbished and sold to local buyers.

Since 1993, the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s Memorial Church has been the Church of St Bartholomew in Yeovilton.

800 Naval Air Squadron, 801 Naval Air Squadron, and 899 Naval Air Squadron (training) which operated the BAE Sea Harrier FA2 and T8 were disbanded in 2006. The replacement carrier-borne aircraft, the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, will be operated from RAF Marham, and was due to enter service in 2018, when it will equip the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers.

In July 2006, Sea King HC4 helicopters from RNAS Yeovilton were deployed to Cyprus on Operation Highbrow to assist with the evacuation of British citizens from Lebanon. Following the closure of RNAS Portland (HMS &quot;Osprey&quot;) in 1999, HMS &quot;Heron&quot; became the main shore base for the Lynx fleet.

In 2013, NATO&#x27;s Joint Electronic Warfare Core Staff was established at Yeovilton. The organisation provides NATO with electronic warfare policy, advice and support.

===Commando Helicopter Force – from Sea King to Merlin===

The Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010 recommended that in order to replace the Navy&#x27;s ageing Westland Sea King HC4&#x27;s which formed the Commando Helicopter Force at Yeovilton, the RAF&#x27;s AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin fleet should be transferred from the Royal Air Force to the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm. To gain experience of operating and maintaining the Merlin, Royal Navy aircrew and engineers were integrated into the Merlin Force at RAF Benson during 2012.

The Merlin fleet was officially handed over to the Navy during a ceremony at Benson on 30 September 2014. The ceremony marked the disbandment of the RAF&#x27;s No. 78 Squadron, and its replacement at Benson with 846 Naval Air Squadron. During July 2015, 845 Naval Air Squadron reformed at Benson and replaced No. 28 Squadron of the RAF which also disbanded.

The Merlin arrived at Yeovilton when 846 NAS moved from Benson on . In May of that year, 848 Naval Air Squadron temporarily stood up with the remaining Sea King HC4 to cover the last remaining Sea King operations, before the Sea King HC4 was finally retired and the squadron decommissioned on 24 March 2016.

The last phase of the transition occurred when 845 NAS departed Benson for Yeovilton on 16 June 2016, bringing nearly 15 years of RAF Merlin operations to a close.

===Wildcat and Project WINFRA===

The AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat HMA2 began replacing the Westland Lynx HMA8 when the first production aircraft arrived at Yeovilton in January 2013. Prior to that, in May 2009, 700W NAS was formed at Yeovilton as the Wildcat Fielding Squadron. The squadron disbanded in July 2014 when it was merged with 702 NAS to form 825 NAS, the first operational Wildcat unit. The final Wildcat HMA2 for the Royal Navy was delivered to 825 NAS in October 2016, bringing the total number of Royal Navy Wildcats to 28. The Lynx was retired in March 2017.

In October 2015, the consolidation of the Army Air Corps (AAC) for Army 2020 resulted in a large regular aviation regiment of Wildcat AH1 being based at RNAS Yeovilton. As such, all 62 UK military Wildcats on order will operate from Yeovilton. 1 Regiment AAC has returned from Gütersloh in Germany, and merged with 9 Regiment AAC from Dishforth. The current 652 (Wildcat Fielding) Squadron will become 1 Regiment&#x27;s Wildcat Operational Conversion Unit. 1 Regiment will form part of the Army Air Corps&#x27; Aviation Reconnaissance Force along with 5 Regiment AAC.

In order to allow the Army Air Corps to locate their Wildcat helicopters and 750 personnel at Yeovilton, extensive redevelopment of the station began in 2014. Known as Project WINFRA, the work involves eight separate contracts worth a total of £150 million and was undertaken by Mott McDonald and Carillion. Building 710, a new three-storey squadron building for 846 Naval Air Squadron was completed in March 2015. The refurbishment of technical facilities and the construction of new quarter master&#x27;s stores, vehicle garages and facilities, ancillary buildings, a cycle path and car parks was completed and handed to the AAC in November 2015. Building 661 is the new 1 Regiment headquarters, and provides accommodation for 659 Squadron and 661 Squadron.

In 2016, a new dental centre, a refurbished office building for 825 Naval Air Squadron, and a new build squadron building for 815 Naval Air Squadron were completed. By January 2017, a 500 capacity Senior Rates Mess, Physical and Recreational Training Centre including a gym, Multi Use Games Area and 4G sports pitches and the refurbishment of the medical centre had been completed. Three blocks of Single Living Accommodation which can accommodate 400 personnel were finished in March 2017. In total, the project has provided 508 new single living accommodation bed spaces, and 130 service families accommodation bed spaces.

===Royal Navy Historic Flight===
The Royal Navy Historic Flight (RNHF) was disbanded in March 2019, previously operating at RNAS Yeovilton since 1972. Following its disbandment, the remaining aircraft were donated to the Fly Navy Heritage Trust at an approximate value of £1,810,000. With the aircraft having now been transferred to the civilian register, displays are now funded from charity events run by the Fly Navy Heritage Trust.

==Operations==
Yeovilton is home to the Royal Navy Wildcat Maritime Force (MWF), Royal Navy Commando Helicopter Force (CHF), the Army&#x27;s Aviation Reconnaissance Force (ARF), and elements of the Royal Navy Fixed Wing Force. The station operates over 100 aircraft, and is staffed by around 1675 service and 2000 civilian personnel, including Ministry of Defence (MOD) employees and permanent contractors. Training of aircrew and engineers of resident aircraft types is also carried out at RNAS Yeovilton. It is also the location for the RN Fighter Controller School, training surface-based aircraft controllers.

Commando Helicopter Force has now returned to prioritising its main amphibious role in support of Royal Navy and Royal Marines operations, after focusing on more than a decade of service in land campaigns in Afghanistan and prior to that in Iraq.

During periods of busy flying training, pressure on the RNAS Yeovilton circuit is relieved by the use of nearby RNAS Merryfield.

727 Naval Air Squadron operate the Grob Tutor T1 in the grading and elementary flying training role.

==Air Day==
Until 2019 the station held an annual air show, allowing public access to the airfield. It included both a flying and static aircraft display. The air day traditionally ended with the Commando Helicopter Force role demonstration, which saw a mixture of aircraft and land forces demonstrate a land assault delivered from the air.

===Merlin Life Sustainment Programme (MLSP)===
The Merlin HC3/3A fleet is currently undergoing an upgrade to HC4 and HC4A, to ensure the aircraft are fully capable of deploying in a maritime / amphibious role. The differences between the remaining HC3 and (former Denmark-bound) HC3A will be almost eliminated in the HC4/4A upgrade, known as the Merlin Life Sustainment Programme (MLSP). This will remove conversion training requirements, as both the HC4 and HC4A variants can be operated under the same training. 

Prior to the upgrade, seven of the airframes have been upgraded to the &#x27;interim HC3&#x27; (HC3i), and are serving with 846 NAS. These aircraft are receiving the full upgrade after the remaining aircraft were upgraded to the HC4 and HC4A. The upgraded and ship-optimised Merlin HC4 and HC4A aircraft are painted in Royal Navy grey, unlike their green &#x27;Junglie&#x27; Sea King HC4 and Merlin HC3 predecessors. Full Operating Capability of the HC4 was delivered in December 2020, with all airframes expected to be delivered by 2023.

<text>Soft updates is an approach to maintaining file system metadata integrity in the event of a crash or power outage. Soft updates work by tracking and enforcing dependencies among updates to file system metadata. Soft updates are an alternative to the more commonly used approach of journaling file systems.

== Method of operation ==

Soft updates allow only asynchronous metadata writes that do not render the on-disk file system inconsistent, or that the only inconsistency that ever happens is a storage space leak (space marked allocated when not used by any file). It avoids having to do ordered synchronous metadata writes by temporarily &quot;rolling back&quot; any part of a metadata block that depends on another potentially non-flushed or partially rolled-back block when writing it.

In effect, blocks may be flushed at any time and the soft updates code will always provide the disk a consistent version of the metadata (as long as it knows which blocks have physically been flushed). Recovery then simply becomes a matter of running a background walk of the file system when it is next mounted to garbage collect any allocated space that has been orphaned. This also permits the file system to selectively flush certain files without having to flush all metadata blocks or all of the records.

Data that is unlinked from the metadata dependency graph before writing it to disk has begun, does not need to be written to disk at all. For example, creating a file, using it for a short period of time, and then deleting it may cause no disk activity at all.

Soft updates require periodic flushing of the metadata to nonvolatile storage.

== Implementations ==

FreeBSD supports soft updates for the UFS file system and they have been enabled by default during installation for many years. Soft updates are manually enabled or disabled during file system creation with an option to the newfs command. They can be disabled or enabled anytime thereafter with an option to the tunefs command. FreeBSD 9.0 introduced a journaling supplement to soft updates for the purpose of eliminating a background fsck for garbage collection after a crash. However, enabling journaling on a file system with soft updates disables the ability to make file system snapshots. This may cause issues when file systems are dumped with the -L option, as snapshots are used to guarantee file system coherency during the dump.

OpenBSD supported soft updates for the FFS file system until the release 7.4 (2023), at which time it was disabled. 

NetBSD supported soft updates until the 6.0 release (2012) at which time it was deprecated in favor of WAPBL journaling.
== Comparison to journaling file systems ==

Neither journaling nor soft updates guarantees that no data will be lost, but they do make sure that the file system remains consistent.

An advantage of a file system with soft updates is that it can be mounted immediately after a crash, since there is no log replay.

<text>Andreas Acoluthus (; 16 March 1654 – 4 November 1704) was a German scholar of orientalism and professor of theology at Breslau (Wrocław). A native of Bernstadt (Bierutów), Lower Silesia, he was the son of Johannes Acoluthus, pastor of St. Elisabeth and superintendent of the churches and schools of Breslau.

== Early life and education ==

He attended the school of St. Elisabeth in Breslau and was in taught by August Pfeiffer in: Rabbinic, Arabic, Persian, Syriac and Ethiopian. He later also learned Mauritanian, Turkish, Coptic, Armenian and Chinese. In 1674 he went to Wittenberg, then Leipzig, where he held private lectures on oriental languages.

By circumstance, he came into possession of an Armenian Bible, so that he was able to publish in 1680 the first Armenian print in Germany, prophet Obadiah with observations.

Acoluthus returned in 1683 to Breslau where he entered the practical religious service. In 1689 he became professor of the Hebrew language at the St. Elisabeth school, one year later he became senior at St. Bernhard.

== Studies ==

His studies reached a new zenith when an Arabic manuscript of the Qur&#x27;an with translations into Persian and Turkish was looted during the wars against the Ottoman Empire. At this time, the Qur&#x27;an was almost unknown in Germany, as the only other known edition in Arabic script was burned by order of the pope. Therefore, Acoluthus decided to publish this book with a Latin translation, a plan which found the goodwill of Frederick III of Saxony. The latter provided Acoluthus with a yearly pension. However, only a partial edition was published. Acoluthus was in the following accepted as a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin.

Andreal Acoluthus was the father of Johann Karl Acoluthus von Folgersberg, who was ennobled by Charles VI.

<doc id="971469" wikidata="Q292297" url="?curid=971469" title="Demodex">
<text>Demodex is a genus of tiny mites that live in or near hair follicles of mammals. Around 65 species of &quot;Demodex&quot; are known. Two species live on humans: &quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot; and &quot;Demodex brevis&quot;, both frequently referred to as eyelash mites, alternatively face mites or skin mites.

Different species of animals host different species of &quot;Demodex&quot;. &quot;Demodex canis&quot; lives on the domestic dog. The presence of &quot;Demodex&quot; species on mammals is common and usually does not cause any symptoms. &quot;Demodex&quot; is derived from Greek () and , δηκός (, &quot;dēkós&quot;) .

==Notable species==
===&quot;D. folliculorum&quot; and &quot;D. brevis&quot;===

&quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot; and &quot;D. brevis&quot; are typically found on humans. The former was first described in 1842 by German physician and dermatologist Gustav Simon, with English biologist Richard Owen naming the genus &quot;Demodex&quot; the following year.

&quot;Demodex brevis&quot; was identified as separate in 1963 by LK Akbulatova. While &quot;D. folliculorum&quot; is found in hair follicles, &quot;D. brevis&quot; lives in sebaceous glands connected to hair follicles. Both species are primarily found in the face near the nose, the eyelashes, and eyebrows but also occur elsewhere on the body. &quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot; is occasionally found as a cause of folliculitis, although most people with &quot;D. folliculorum&quot; mites have no obvious ill effects.

The adult mites are long, with &quot;D. brevis&quot; slightly shorter than &quot;D. folliculorum&quot;. Each has a semitransparent, elongated body that consists of two fused parts. Eight short, segmented legs are attached to the first body segment. The body is covered with scales for anchoring itself in the hair follicle, and the mite has pin-like mouthparts for eating skin cells and oils that accumulate in the hair follicles. The mites can leave the follicles and slowly walk around on the skin, at a speed of per hour, especially at night, as they try to avoid light. The mites are transferred between hosts through contact with hair, eyebrows, and the sebaceous glands of the face.

Females of &quot;D. folliculorum&quot; are larger and rounder than males. Both male and female &quot;Demodex&quot; mites have a genital opening, and fertilization is internal. Mating takes place in the follicle opening, and eggs are laid inside the hair follicles or sebaceous glands. The six-legged larvae hatch after 3–4 days, and the larvae develop into adults in about 7 days. The total lifespan of a &quot;Demodex&quot; mite is several weeks.

====Prevalence====
Older people are much more likely to carry face mites; about a third of children and young adults, half of adults, and two-thirds of elderly people carry them. The lower rate in children may be because children produce less sebum, or simply have had less time to acquire the mite. A 2014 study of 29 people in North Carolina, USA, found that all of the adults (19) carried mites, and that 70% of those under 18 years of age carried mites. This study (using a DNA-detection method, more sensitive than traditional sampling and observation by microscope), along with several studies of cadavers, suggests that previous work might have underestimated the mites&#x27; prevalence. The small sample size and small geographical area involved prevent drawing broad conclusions from these data.

====Research====
Research about human infestation by &quot;Demodex&quot; mites is ongoing:

* Evidence of a correlation between &quot;Demodex&quot; infestation and acne vulgaris exists, suggesting it may play a role in promoting acne, including in immunocompetent infants displaying pityriasis and erythema toxicum neonatorum, or simply that &quot;Demodex&quot; mites thrive in the same oily conditions where acne bacteria thrive.
* Several preliminary studies suggest an association between mite infestation and rosacea.
*&quot;Demodex&quot; mites can cause blepharitis, which can be treated with solutions of tea tree oil; there is no good evidence for its effectiveness.
* &quot;Demodex&quot; mites causing a reaction in healthy individuals depends on genealogy. Mites may evolve differently with different bloodlines.
* New studies suggest &quot;Demodex&quot; mites are involved in psoriasis, allergic rhinitis, and seborrheic dermatitis in immunosuppressed individuals.
* Atopic triad is widely known as atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and asthma.&quot;

Consequently, it has been suggested that effective management of atopic dermatitis could deter the progression of the atopic march, therefore preventing or at least reducing the subsequent development of asthma and allergic rhinitis.

===&quot;D. canis&quot;===

The natural host of &quot;D. canis&quot; is the domestic dog. &quot;Demodex canis&quot; mites can survive on immunosuppressed human skin and human mites can infect immunosuppressed dogs, although reported cases are rare. Ivermectin is used for &quot;Demodex&quot; mites requiring up to four treatments to eradicate in humans; only one treatment is usually given to dogs to reduce mite count. Naturally, the &quot;D. canis&quot; mite has a commensal relationship with the dog, and under normal conditions does not produce any clinical signs or disease. The escalation of a commensal &quot;D. canis&quot; infestation into one requiring clinical attention usually involves complex immune factors.

Under normal health conditions, the mite can live within the dermis of the dog without causing any harm to the animal. However, whenever an immunosuppressive condition is present and the dog&#x27;s immune system (which normally ensures that the mite population cannot escalate to an infestation that can damage the dermis of the host) is compromised, it allows the mites to proliferate. As they continue to infest the host, clinical signs begin to become apparent and demodicosis/demodectic mange/red mange is diagnosed.

Since &quot;D. canis&quot; is a part of the natural fauna on a canine&#x27;s skin, the mite is not considered to be contagious. Many dogs receive an initial exposure from their mothers while nursing, during the first few days of life. The immune system of the healthy animal keeps the population of the mite in check, so subsequent exposure to dogs possessing clinical demodectic mange does not increase an animal&#x27;s chance of developing demodicosis. Subsequent infestations after treatment can occur.

The species was first described by Franz Leydig in 1859.

<text>Home Nations () is a collective term in sport, usually referring to England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. When a sport is governed by a council representing the island of Ireland, such as the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), the term can refer to the nations of the constituent countries on the island of Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and the island of Ireland as a whole.

The term was originally used when the whole island of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom. The synonymous &quot;Home Countries&quot; (not to be confused with the &quot;home counties&quot;) is also sometimes used.

==Association football==

In association football, the Home Nations originally referred to the then four national teams of the United Kingdom: England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Today, the term refers to the teams of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales – the teams that contested the British Home Championship until 1984 – although references to the Home Nations sometimes erroneously include the Republic of Ireland team.

==Rugby union==
In 1883, the first Home Nations Championship was played between England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. At this point in its history, the competition contained only teams from the UK. In 1910, France officially joined the competition and it was renamed the Five Nations Championship. Despite the partition of Ireland and the secession of the Republic of Ireland from the United Kingdom, the island of Ireland still fields a single team and is referred to as a &quot;Home Nation&quot; in the context of rugby union. When France was expelled from the international championship in 1932, the tournament reverted to being known simply as the Home Nations tournament until the readmission of France immediately after the 1939 tournament, just before World War II caused its suspension until 1947. Since the admission of Italy in 2000, the tournament has been known by its current name, the Six Nations Championship.

Victories by any Home Nation over the other three in one Championship season is a Triple Crown. The Home Nations also contribute players to a unified team known as the British and Irish Lions. Southern Hemisphere teams who beat all four home nations in one tour are said to have a Grand Slam Tour.

<text>Yeovilton is a village in Somerset, England, east of Ilchester and north of Yeovil. It had a population of 1,226 in the 2011 census, estimated at 1,418 in 2019. 

The village is part of &quot;Yeovilton and District&quot; civil parish, which includes Limington, Podimore (also known as Puddimore or Milton Podimore) and the hamlets of Speckington and Bridgehampton. The village includes RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron) and the associated Fleet Air Arm Museum.

==History==
Yeovilton is close to the route of the Fosse Way, a Roman road that linked Exeter (&quot;Isca Dumnoniorum&quot;) in South West England to Lincoln (&quot;Lindum Colonia&quot;) in the East Midlands, via Ilchester (&quot;Lindinis&quot;), Bath (&quot;Aquae Sulis&quot;), Cirencester (&quot;Corinium&quot;), Leicester (&quot;Ratae Corieltauvorum&quot;) and Newark-on-Trent. There is evidence of a Romano-British farmstead under what is now an airfield.

Between 899 and 925, an estate in Yeovilton was granted by King Edward and between 955 and 959 King Eadwig gave a further holding of five hides to Brihtric. The parish of Yeovilton was part of the hundred of Somerton, while Podimore was part of the Whitley Hundred.

In 1411 the lord of the manor was John Rogers, who also held the manor of Barwick. By 1602, these had been inherited by Henry Lyte. The holding was purchased by G. D. W. Digby of Sherborne Castle in Dorset in 1857 and remained with the Digby family until 1919.

In 1939, the village was chosen as the site for the RNAS Yeovilton air base, which was used for engagements during World War II. The associated Fleet Air Arm Museum, was opened on the site of the airfield in 1964. Since 1993 the Fleet Air Arm’s Memorial Church has been the Church of St Bartholomew in Yeovilton. The village was host to a stage start of the Tour of Britain in 2007.

==Governance==
Yeovilton is part of Castle Cary electoral division, which elects two councillors to Somerset Council. &quot;Yeovilton and District&quot; parish, formed in 2022 when Yeovilton parish was merged with Limington parish, also has a parish council which has responsibility for some local issues.

The village was formerly part of South Somerset district from 1974 to 2023, and part of Yeovil Rural District from 1894 to 1974.

The village is part of the Glastonbury and Somerton constituency for elections to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

==Geography and climate==

It lies on the north bank of the River Yeo, from which it gets its name, opposite Limington.

The parish is largely flat, lying mostly between and above sea level, on the alluvium of the Yeo and Cam valleys and partly on clay loam on the Lower Lias.

Average maximum and minimum temperatures, average rainfall, rain days and sunshine recorded in 1981–2010 at the Yeovilton Met Office weather station:
&lt;section begin=weatherbox /&gt;&lt;section end=weatherbox /&gt;

==Transport==
The village lies south of the A303 trunk road, which connects Basingstoke in Hampshire with Honiton in Devon. 

Yeovilton has a two-hourly service in each direction between Taunton and Yeovil, operated by The Buses of Somerset. A coach service on the Taunton–London route, provided by Berry&#x27;s Coaches, stops in the village twice a day in each direction.

The nearest railway station is Yeovil Junction, which is away. South Western Railway provides generally hourly services between and .

==Religious sites==
At Podimore the Church of Saint Peter dates from the 14th century and has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.

The Church of St Bartholomew in Yeovilton dates from around 1300 century and is a grade II* listed building. From 1642 Richard Sterne held the rectory of Yeovilton before going on to become Archbishop of York. The rector between 1762 and 1805 was Daniel Dumaresq after his period as an educational consultant to Russian and Polish monarchs. Since 1993 the church has been owned by the Royal Navy, and it serves as the Memorial chapel for the Fleet Air Arm.

==Notable people==
*Robert Potter (1721–1804), a cleric born in Podimore, was the first to translate the works of Aeschylus into English.

<text>St. George&#x27;s University is a private for-profit medical school and international university in Grenada, West Indies, offering degrees in medicine, veterinary medicine, public health, the health sciences, nursing, arts and sciences, and business.
St. George&#x27;s University was established by an act of Grenada&#x27;s parliament on July 23, 1976. Classes in the School of Medicine began January 17, 1977. In 1993, the university added graduate and undergraduate programs. In 1996, it was granted a charter for the School of Arts and Sciences and a Graduate Studies Program. In 1997, undergraduate courses in international business, life sciences, medical sciences, pre-medical and pre-veterinary medicine were added. The School of Veterinary Medicine was established in 1999, as was the university&#x27;s Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine.

==History==

St. George&#x27;s University was founded on July 23, 1976, by an act of Grenada&#x27;s Parliament, which was then effectively controlled by Prime Minister Eric M. Gairy. The school was named for the capital city of Grenada, but it was the brainchild of Charles R. Modica, a 29-year-old lawyer and education entrepreneur. Modica envisioned creating a for-profit medical school in the English-speaking Caribbean that would cater to academically qualified American students who failed to gain admission to medical schools in the United States. Besides Modica, the other three original founders of the school were also from Long Island: Louis J. Modica, Charles&#x27; father and a successful real estate developer; Edward McGowan, also a land developer; and Patrick F. Adams, a business lawyer. The university&#x27;s corporate structure is currently held within Medforth Global Healthcare Education, which also operates the Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine in Parker, Colorado and in Ivins, Utah.

Classes at St. George&#x27;s School of Medicine began on January 17, 1977, with 125 students and six part-faculty. Almost all of the founding faculty members had been educated either in the United States or Europe. By the early 1979, the school had expanded to 23 full-time faculty and about 600 island-resident students.

On March 13, 1979, a Marxist-inspired revolutionary party forcibly overturned Gairy&#x27;s rule. Despite the school&#x27;s association with the ousted Gairy regime, it survived and prospered under the new prime minister, Maurice Bishop, because it generated significant income for the government and people of Grenada. The school amicably co-existed with the revolutionary regime until Bishop also became embroiled in a domestic leadership challenge four years later.

On October 19, 1983, Bishop and seven of his closest supporters were executed by Army soldiers loyal to an insurgent element in Bishop&#x27;s own party. To quell any mass protests, the island&#x27;s military declared martial law and placed the entire island under a 24-hour, shoot-on-sight curfew. The repression raised fears in the Eastern Caribbean that Grenada&#x27;s turmoil would destabilize democracy and law and order in the entire region. In Washington, the Reagan Administration feared for the safety of 1,000 US citizens on the island (including students, faculty, families, etc.). The U.S. government, urged on by allies in the English-speaking Caribbean, launched Operation Urgent Fury on Oct. 25, 1983. The surprise invasion was an attempt to secure the safety of American nationals on the island, but also sought to restore Westminster-style democracy and evict the Soviet-Cuban presence on Grenada because the U.S government did not trust Grenadians to make their own leadership decisions.

The operation was supposed to have been essentially over in a day, but the invading multi-national forces ran into stiffer than expected resistance from the Grenada&#x27;s People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army and militarized Cuban workers on the island. On D-Day, the principal independent information coming out of the island was from a ham radio operated by a St. George&#x27;s student.

Because of an intelligence failure, the American-led forces landed on the island without knowing that the medical school had more than one campus. It took the invaders three days to reach all the students and staff on the island. Eventually 564 were evacuated back to U.S. soil without suffering any injuries.

In his memoirs, President Reagan recounted the return to the U.S. of the St. George&#x27;s students as an event that affected him deeply. &quot;I was among many in our country whose eyes got a little misty when I watched their arrival in the United States on television and saw some of them lean down and kiss U.S. soil the moment that they stepped off the airplanes that brought them home.&quot;

Charles R. Modica, the school&#x27;s founder and chancellor, initially criticized the invasion as &quot;very unnecessary,&quot; but changed his mind the next day after receiving a private State Department briefing that convinced him the intervention was justified. Classes were moved to Long Island, New York; New Jersey, and Barbados temporarily until 1984.

In response to Hurricane Ivan in 2004, students were again relocated temporarily to campuses in the United States. The school has a comprehensive hurricane plan in place currently.

In August 2014, SGU received a $750 million investment from Baring Private Equity Asia and Altas Partners, a Canadian private equity company whose other major investment is in a salt mining operation. In August 2015, G. Richard Olds, the founder and past dean of UC Riverside School of Medicine, was named as the school&#x27;s president and CEO. Dr. Andrew Sussman, former executive vice president of clinical services for CVS Health, was appointed the university&#x27;s CEO in May 2017.

==Campus==
St. George&#x27;s University owns 65 buildings on 42 acres of land, spread out in a peninsula in the southwest corner of Grenada located in the West Indies. A major campus expansion begun in the early 1990s resulted in 52 new buildings. The architecture of the buildings are of Georgian architecture.

SGU has its own desalination plant, electrical grid, and WIFI services separate from the rest of the island to ensure uninterrupted services.

==Academics==

=== School of Medicine ===
St. George&#x27;s University School of Medicine offers a Doctor of Medicine degree program that can be earned individually or as part of a dual degree with a Master of Public Health, Master of Business Administration, Master of Science, or Bachelor of Science. The School of Medicine is accredited by the Grenada Medical and Dental Council (GMDC). GMDC has been recognized by the World Federation of Medical Education (WFME) and the U.S. National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation (NCFMEA), a panel of experts organized by the U.S. Department of Education, which determined that GMDC uses standards that are comparable to the standards used to accredit medical schools in the United States.

=== School of Veterinary Medicine ===
St. George&#x27;s University School of Veterinary Medicine (SGUSVM) was started in 1999, with the first faculty member Dr. Sunil Gupta, a veterinarian and anatomist, being tasked with forming a veterinary school. By 2011, the university had obtained probationary accreditation from the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), and it was awarded full accreditation in 2018. Additionally, the school obtained accreditation by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) making it one of few schools to be accredited by both the AVMA and RCVS.

<text>The Conestoga wagon, also simply known as the Conestoga, is an obsolete transport vehicle that was used exclusively in North America, primarily the United States, mainly from the early 18th to mid-19th centuries. It is a heavy and large horse-drawn vehicle which, while largely elusive in origin, originated most likely from German immigrants of Pennsylvanian Dutch culture in the Province of Pennsylvania in the early 18th century. The name &quot;Conestoga Wagon&quot; probably derived from the Conestoga River Valley settlement area in the province and saw usage as early as 1717, although it is not known whether the first wagons referred as such had similar builds as later Conestoga wagons.

Conestoga wagons are larger and more robust variants of covered wagons, sharing similarities in usage of white hemp cloths to cover the wagons, large wheels to travel on non-macadam road surfaces, and intended usage as vehicles to transport items elsewhere. It differs from most other covered wagon variants mainly by the curvature of the wagon body&#x27;s sides and floor, which replicated boats and served the dual purposes of keeping the luggage centered while also looking visually pleasing to wagon customers. They were operated by a team of four to six horses of a now-extinct breed, a driver, and sometimes helpers. Conestoga wagons early on may have been produced by farmers but later were often made by teams of blacksmiths, wheelwrights and wagon makers.

They were primarily used as transport vehicles that could have carried up to of raw goods from rural areas to towns or cities of the eastern United States, typically bringing back commodified goods in exchange. Conestoga wagons were common presences in the northeast, especially Pennsylvania, as thousands of them may have traveled to different areas annually. Although it was sometimes used for westward frontier travel in the 19th century, lightweight and cheaper covered wagons were generally preferred by the pioneers. The Nissen wagon, likely deriving from Conestoga wagons, was also lightweight despite superficially resembling them and was a dominant vehicle type in the southeastern states compared to the heavyweight wagons. Conestoga wagon usage likely declined as a result of displacement by canals and railroads in the 19th century, which proved to be more efficient means of transporting goods. Despite this, the cultural legacy of the Conestoga wagon endured in the later 19th and 20th centuries as they and other covered wagons became icons of early American history including pioneering, although the romanticized image waned by the 21st century.

== Origin ==

The exact origins of covered wagons (or prairie schooners) and the derivation of Conestoga wagons from earlier covered wagons remain not well known. The less adequately documented history of Conestoga wagons is in part due to the overall lack of specificity of the wagon types from early American colonists of the 18th century. Knowledge of wagon production in colonial America originated from that of English and German immigrants of Great Britain and central Europe where a variety of wagon designs were already created. They also may have brought early farm wagons with them. Wagons would have proven increasingly necessary in North America due to the need to haul farm goods and trade goods such as furs to other settlements such as Philadelphia in the Province of Pennsylvania and to ports for Europe.

There is no documented record of any strictly &quot;first&quot; Conestoga wagon to have ever been made. Covered wagon designs may have been standardized in design within colonial America, making it differ from the varied designs of English farm wagons of the 18th–19th centuries. They may have derived from both English road wagons and large wagons of Germany although this remains speculative. The earliest documented usage of the American wagons was in 1716 when Philadelphia fur trader James Logan, who took over William Penn&#x27;s business estate after his death, wrote in his account book the usage of an individual wagon by the wagoner John Miller for hauling goods from Philadelphia to the Conestoga River Valley in what is now Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Two other wagons were built and put to use by other individuals from the Conestoga valley named James Hendricks and Joseph Cloud in 1717. In November of the same year, Logan established a store for selling hardware and household goods to German settlers and Native Americans in Conestoga. Logan then purchased what he called a &quot;Conestogoe Waggon&quot; from James Hendricks on December 31, 1717, thus making this the earliest known mention of the wagon name.

The name &quot;Conestoga wagon&quot; likely derived from the Conestoga River Valley, which was a settlement area for American colonists by the early 18th century that was about from Philadelphia and from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The earliest usage of the name &quot;Conestoga&quot; was previously applied to a river stream by the Bohemian merchant Augustine Herman in 1665, and it was also used as a name for the now-extinct Susquehannock tribe. The slang term &quot;stogie&quot;, used for long and cheap cigars made from rolled leaves and at times smoked by Conestoga wagoners, may have derived from the Conestoga wagon term.

Farm wagons became increasingly prevalent in Philadelphia since after 1720, many of which were referred to as &quot;Conestoga&quot; or &quot;Dutch&quot; wagons. Advertisements in &quot;The Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; indicate that the former term saw common usage by February 5, 1750, for a Philadelphia tavern named &quot;The Sign of the Conestogoe Wagon&quot;. The synonymous term &quot;Dutch Waggon&quot; was also used for the location for another advertisement in the same newspaper published on February 12, 1750.

== Description ==
The Conestoga wagon is a more robust variant of covered wagon – it has the general characteristics of being a wooden wagon with both hickory bows on top to hold up a waterproof canvas and wooden wheels. Covered wagons are generally pulled by draft horses and act as both a transport vehicle and mobile home. They were specialized vehicles for transversing on rough roads, although walking or horse-riding would have been preferred in other circumstances by travelers. Although they generally made for uncomfortable travel experiences, covered wagons are considered by historians to have been vital to pioneer families whose possessions required long-distance travel while acting as temporary shelters for when the pioneers needed to sleep. Wagoners did not ride inside the Conestoga wagons themselves; instead they either walked beside the wagon&#x27;s team, rode on the backmost and left-sided horse (known as a &quot;wheel horse&quot;), or sat on the &quot;lazy board&quot; of the wagon&#x27;s left side in front of its rear wheel. The difficulty of Conestoga wagon travel was weighed largely on the road surface conditions, the poorer conditions leading to larger rolling resistance.
Conestoga wagons derived in design from earlier covered wagons. They had general boat-like shapes, their sides slanting outwards. The interior floors of the wagon type were slightly curved. The wagons combined with three pairs of hauling horses could have measured up to long. Depending on the weight load of the wagons, the terrestrial vehicles were transported by some four to six horses. In comparison, American western frontier covered wagons were often transported by oxen instead of horses, but travelers tended to prefer the latter option. The largest Conestoga wagons may have been capable of carrying up to of goods. Some Conestoga wagons had as many as 8 draft horses, but none ever had fewer than 4 of them.

The Conestoga horse was a specialized breed of heavy and large draft animal as well as one of the few horse breeds to have originated from North America. The origins of the breed is unknown, but they probably originated from a few individual horses from Pennsylvania. They were popularly used because of their abilities to haul loaded heavy Conestoga wagons. Conestoga horses typically came in black or bay hair coat colors but were sometimes dapple gray. The Conestoga horse breed went extinct likely as a result of the decline of Conestoga wagon usage.

The pack horses were often equipped with bells, but when such a practice started is unknown. The bells are small-sized and located on wearable &quot;Conestoga bell arches&quot;, sturdy iron pieces measuring to . The lead horses (or front horses) often had five small bells, the middle horses four, and the pole horses (back horses) three larger ones for a total of twenty-four bells on the entire team. The bell sounds coming from the Conestoga team were often seen by wagoners as a source of pride and some would tune them for better sound. Traditionally, a Conestoga wagon team that arrived without any bells on, usually the result of forfeiting them to another team when they needed assistance on a damaged or stuck wagon, was seen as a source of humiliation. The archaic American phrase &quot;&quot; therefore derived from this now-obsolete tradition.

=== Wagon body ===

The Conestoga wagon model is a uniquely American design with no close European equivalent, being well-suited for transversal through American roads that were not yet macadam, or built from hard stone. It is boat-shaped in terms of both crosswise (horizontal) and lengthwise (vertical) dimensions, thus ensuring the ability for sagging, or curving downwards in the middle, during movements through hills and valleys so that the loads remained centered. However, the curvatures of the boxes could have also been for stylistic purposes, as consumers may have preferred their designs over those of straight-sided wagons.

The wagon body of a Conestoga wagon, known also as a &quot;box&quot; or &quot;bed&quot;, has a complex design compared to typically simple rectangular wagon boxes. The designs of the Conestoga wagon&#x27;s body were intended to make the wagon last a long time and be flexible for traveling through roads that are normally rough for heavy-loaded vehicles. As a result, the Conestoga wagon is more representative in technological niches as a large-sized basket on a set of wheels than a box. Its designs were meant to replicate large-sized watercrafts that serve the dual purposes of carrying heavy quantities of goods and withstanding hostile environmental conditions such as currents. Historians George Shumway and Howard C. Frey considered nonsensical the suggestions in early United States history books that the Conestoga wagon boxes allowed for traveling passengers and goods across rivers—the boxes were not water-tight and would have leaked if placed in water bodies.
The wagon bed is typically created from the hardy woods of white oaks (&quot;Quercus alba&quot;). It measures in length from its front to rear ends and never more than in width. Six to twelve sloping hooplike hickory bows or &quot;tilts&quot;, reaching individual grounded heights of , are arched over the wagon&#x27;s bed to hold the white canvas sheet that covers them. The canvas, a cloth made from hemp fiber, was tied down to both sides of the wagon body but were left overhanging at both its front and rear ends. The white sheet measures approximately long. The positioning of the canvas serves to shield the wagon&#x27;s contents from rainfall while allowing for air circulation for cargo and passengers. The Conestoga wagon was extensively painted given the prominence of flair in Pennsylvania Dutch culture. The wagon box has light blue color tones whereas the ironworks were black and the wheels, other running gear (the components allowing a vehicle to move and stop), and sideboards were vermilion in color. The prominence of color in Conestoga wagons make it partially differ from other covered wagons, many of which had no painted colors due to concerns that draft animals were frightened by bright colors.
On the left side of the Conestoga wagon is a short but strong white oak board known as the &quot;lazy board&quot;. It is able to bear the weight of the wagon driver, or his helper if he hired one, who managed his draft animals plus team and operated the brake there. This meant that the driver had a habit of operating Conestoga wagons on the left side, starkly contrasting with modern operations of automobiles on the right. The heavy and sturdy brakes served to slow down the wagon&#x27;s wheels when the driver held the iron handle (or &quot;lock patent&quot;) down, and the handles were also used to lock the brakes. The brakes were vital for managing the wagon through unsmooth roads. The tongue, or a long board in the wagon&#x27;s front area, may be plated in iron then painted.

There are several other covered wagon variants, known from complete wagon evidence, that closely resemble the Conestoga wagon. The Weber wagon, utilized in the early 19th century, differs from typical Conestoga wagons in the presence of a front end panel and an almost vertical tail gate. Whether it and the similar Sternberg wagon and Shantz wagon can be considered Conestoga wagons is a matter of subjectivity according to Shumway and Frey. On the other hand, the Groff wagon of the later 19th century, known by a single specimen, is clearly distinct from Conestoga wagons despite similar appearances in different constructions of the front end panel and lower sides. The &quot;Sheibley wagon&quot; has similar shapes to the Groff wagon but is classified as a Conestoga wagon because of the formatting of the wagon bed and bows. The Nissen wagon is a distinct covered wagon variant originating from North Carolina that derived in design from the Conestoga wagon. Therefore, Nissen wagons can superficially resemble Conestoga wagons, but the former differs from the latter in usage as lightweight carriage of people and items instead of as heavyweight carriage of goods and the presence of a box in the front area where a driver and a passenger could sit. The Nissen wagon uses just two draft horses given its lightweight nature and is synonymous with the alternate term &quot;Salem wagon&quot;.

=== Running gear ===

The running gear of the four-wheeled Conestoga wagon is assembled into two parts. The first is the front portion, which contain the front wheels connected by the front axletree, front wagon hounds (parts binding the axles to the wagon), front wagon bolster (a wood beam connecting an axletree to the wagon body), and the tongue. The rear portion is made up of similar components, but instead of a tongue, it has a coupling pole (a beam connecting the front and back wagon axles). The front and rear portions are very similar in appearances, the differences being very specific.

The axletrees are wooden and encased with iron coverings. The wagon&#x27;s wheels are kept in place by iron linchpins. The rear brake mechanism can be handy for the covered wagons but are not required, hence the lack of them in some Conestoga wagons. The front hounds are made from oak wood and are the connecting piece between the wagon tongue and the front axletree. They are bound by a transverse oak and iron brace piece that can keep the wagon tongue up. The front hounds can also support the curved iron pieces that minimize sideways swaying and prevent toppling for the front wagon portion. The left front hound may also hold an iron sheath for an axe that wagoners can use to cut through wood obstacles or make new tongues and axletrees.

The Conestoga wagon wheels were high so that the axles (or wheel centers) could clear through or move over low obstacles such as tree stumps and mud. The wheels, equipped with iron tires, ranged in size in accordance to the wagon&#x27;s size, the largest having been used for the Pitt wagon variants of the early 19th century for mountain-freighting. The rear wheels of large wagons on average have diameters between and while the front wheels were smaller and generally measured approximately in diameter. Medium-sized Conestoga wagon rear wheels meanwhile generally measure between and in diameter. The tires of large Conestoga wagon rear wheels usually measure to in width while those of medium Conestoga wagon rear wheels measured about in width. Conestoga wagons used for hauling and farming may have been complemented with different wheel size sets for performing different transversal duties, from small wheels for farms to large ones for road travel. Medium-sized wheels normally contain 14 spokes (or rods connecting to the wheel&#x27;s center) while large wheels usually have 16 of them.

=== Other accessories ===

Additional accessories may be paired with the Conestoga wagon for utilitarian purposes. On the rear end of the wagon is a wooden trough known as the &quot;feed trough&quot; or &quot;feed box&quot; that wagon operators were able to remove, fill with grain, and place on the tongue to feed the draft animals. Also present was a water bucket that was usually hung on the rear axletree, or an underside bar connecting two wheels, of the wagon. Conestoga wagons may also be equipped with water barrels on the side, toolboxes for wagon-fixing, and a pot of tar for keeping the wheels moving.

The feed box measures long, approximately wide, and deep in dimensions. The top edges of the trough are embedded with light iron straps to prevent damage to it by the horses&#x27; teeth. The iron lug and pin of the feed box, positioned at the opposite ends of the trough from each other, are intended to fix the box&#x27;s position at the tongue while the horses feed. The water bucket fills a similar purpose for consumption of water from nearby water sources by horses. The tar pot was wooden and had a lid with a central hole and a paddle for applying the lubricant of pine tar and lard to the axles.

In addition to the axe and toolbox which Conestoga wagons were equipped with, the wagon jack, used for raising wagons up, was another tool that was equipped on them, specifically probably in its rear end. They were highly durable and tended to have outlasted the wagons themselves, making them valuable for antique collectors. Trends around the size increase of wagon jacks is correlated directly with the increased size of the covered wagons.

== Production ==

Conestoga wagon production depended largely on the labors of blacksmiths and similar occupations since the colonial era of the United States, coinciding with increased land colonization and the rise of the American iron industry. The American iron industry was fueled by the abundant lumber from land-clearing that could be converted to charcoal and be used by blacksmiths to melt iron in furnaces into needed products. The American colonial iron industry was challenged by the British implementation of the Iron Act in 1750, which limited American production of cast iron and bar iron products. Nonetheless, pig iron (or crude iron) was still a prominent good within and near the Lancaster County of Pennsylvania.

In the 18th century, farmers were expected to support themselves and their families by combined knowledge of farming and blacksmithing. Based on tax assessments in Lancaster County, the turn of the 19th century marked a shift towards specialized craftsmanship as wheelwrights and wagon makers became separate occupations from blacksmiths, all three of whom worked together to produce Conestoga wagons. Blacksmiths at times also hired apprentices to operate or produce tools. Blacksmiths used various tools such as vises, hammer and anvils, pliers, and drills to iron the wagon&#x27;s gear and decorate the wagon bed. Early on, they built most of the wagon except for the wheels, but the wagon builder occupation later arose by the turn of the 19th century to help with the construction process. The construction of the Conestoga wagon was a laborious process and required light but strong wood of pure qualities. Because of the long process and importance of the wagon in the United States, a finished product could have cost as much as $250 in 1820.

Blacksmiths of high expertise were able to not only iron but decorate different elements of the Conestoga wagon such as toolbox lids. The tendencies by blacksmiths to decorate Conestoga wagons with motifs, often those of Pennsylvania Dutch culture such as tulips, hearts, serpents, and birds, are the result of competitive efforts to catch interest of their wagons by customers. Toolbox lids today are valuable collector&#x27;s items for both museums and private collectors. Women played roles in Conestoga wagon production as well, using loom devices to weave simple canvas covers and ensure that they fit with the corresponding wagons according to the wagons&#x27; sizes and the curvature of the wagon beds.

By the time Conestoga wagons were commercially produced for the United States, the wagon makers individually tended to employ some 20 to 25 assistants in the construction process, but they did not strictly compose any single factory. Also, the Conestoga wagon was never completely standardized in design. Covered wagons resembling Conestoga wagons were built throughout the country, but true Conestoga wagon production, fairly organized in structure, was almost entirely restricted to eastern Pennsylvania. In the later 19th century in comparison, wagon shops in the United States tended to compose less than five workers total.

== Historic usage ==
=== Pennsylvanian origins ===

The region now known as Lancaster County was first permanently settled by European colonists by 1719. German immigrants arrived to Lancaster County within the 18th century because of the rich-quality land. The Pennsylvanian town of Lancaster was founded by John Wright in 1730 and grew to become one of the largest towns in the American colonies by the American Revolution. The German immigrants of the county referred to themselves as &quot;Pennsylfawisch Deitsch&quot;, leading to the confusion by English speakers who established the term &quot;Pennsylvanian Dutch&quot; despite them not actually being Dutch.

By 1720, farm wagons were already put into usage within the British colony of Pennsylvania as they carried merchandise from Philadelphia to Lancaster county in exchange for furs. In the mid-18th century, the German immigrants of Lancaster County produced their own Conestoga wagons for hauling crops elsewhere and for traveling on dirt roads. The covered wagons often carried flour and iron ores from Lancaster to Philadelphia in exchange for tools, clothing, and furniture. They were also hauled from Conestoga, Pennsylvania, to Philadelphia, where they returned to the former area with basic goods such as lead, gunpowder, rum, and salt. Conestoga wagon usage was broadened to American settlers for pioneering west as time passed.

=== Braddock Expedition ===

The Conestoga wagons were notably the major transport vehicles used during the Braddock Campaign of the French and Indian War. They were first referenced in relation to the war campaign by the Pennsylvania governor Robert Hunter Morris when he advised the Pennsylvania General Assembly that they cover the expenses of the wagons and horses to be employed for British-American military service to capture the French Fort Duquesne. Neither the Pennsylvania assembly nor those of Maryland and Virginia passed any law to cover military transport.

Major-General Edward Braddock arrived to North America in February 1755 to carry out his role as commander-in-chief of the British forces during the French and Indian War. Colonel Sir John St. Clair informed Braddock about settlers at the Blue Ridge Mountains who were running provisions and stores, expressing confidence that by early May 1755, they would have 200 wagons and 1,500 pack horses ready for deployment into Fort Cumberland. Unfortunately for Braddock, only 25 wagons were deployed for the British frontier port by April, several of which were actually unusable. The major-general was aggravated in reaction to the underwhelming resources and wanted to shut down the expedition, but he later commissioned Benjamin Franklin to gather some 150 wagons and 1,500 pack horses from the locals. Franklin eventually succeeded in Braddock&#x27;s demands but with great difficulty due to farmers being unable to afford giving up their resources and the Pennsylvania assembly having little interest in the war due to Quaker affinities. Another challenge was of building roads, as several road builders under Colonel James Burd were being killed by Native Americans, leading to many others threatening to quit their work unless they were given protection.

Letters and newspaper accounts of the 1750s confirm the usage of farm wagons during the Braddock Expedition that were referred to as &quot;Conestoga wagons&quot;. No wagon of the war campaign survives today, but archeological evidence of wagon fragments provide limited evidence of the wagon designs. The wheel diameters are typical of farm wagons rather than military vehicles, and the presence of strakes for wagon wheels indicate the lack of brakes in early farm wagons that later Conestoga wagons had. The wagons used by Braddock&#x27;s men also carried smaller loads compared to later Conestoga wagons due to their smaller sizes.

According to the British Army officer Robert Orme, the wagons, artillery, and carrying horses were placed into three different divisions that were each overseen by an appointed superior. The wagon masters of each division were expected to keep their teams stable and replenish horses when needed. During the expedition, many wagons sustained critical damage and were replaced by wagons from other camps. Management of horses also proved problematic as they were often lost or brought home by their owners, and those that remained grew weaker over time. Some wagons had to be sent back due to being too heavy, and the others had loads removed in order to reduce their weights.

The Braddock Expedition ended with the Battle of the Monongahela, which ultimately proved to be disastrous for the British Army. Many of Braddock&#x27;s soldiers were killed or wounded by the opposing French and their allied Native American forces, and Braddock himself was mortally wounded. Most of the British artillery, wagons, and supplies were abandoned by the British army as they quickly retreated, meaning that a majority of the remaining wagons were lost. Most of the wagons at Dunbar&#x27;s Camp were burned by the British to prevent the French and Native Americans from seizing their materials as they anticipated pursuit by the enemy forces. Only a few wagons of the Braddock Expedition ultimately returned to Wills Creek in Pennsylvania, most of which were evidently damaged beyond repair. All the wagon owners were ultimately compensated both for the use of the wagons and, where appropriate, their loss. In total, 146 wagons are thought to have been employed for the disastrous Braddock Expedition, the only wagon which appears to have survived intact being that of William Douglas.

=== Late 18th–19th centuries ===
Conestoga wagons, strictly speaking, are generally thought to have had widespread usage within North America lasting from 1750 to 1850, although the year range is by no means strict. Several authors argued that the &quot;golden age&quot; of Conestoga wagons (or time of peak usage) lasted from 1820 to 1840. As the main terrestrial vehicles of transport in North America, they frequently hauled farm goods from rural areas into towns and cities in exchange for other manufactured commodities. In the 18th century of the United States, the Conestoga wagon was the most popular transport vehicle of the American frontier, and as many as one hundred of them traveled in individual groups, extending in geographical range from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Augusta, Georgia. However, Conestoga wagon travel was still costly, so merchants often preferred transport of goods by sea. The increase in usage of Conestoga wagons within Pennsylvania in the later 18th century was correlated with the growth population in the western region and the rising economic development of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. From 1750 up to 1775, more than 10,000 Conestoga wagons traveled within the Pennsylvania region to Philadelphia annually, and 50 to 100 wagons traveled daily. At times, a whole train of 100 wagons traveled at once. Wagon travel was made possible by the construction of roads across multiple provinces to make travel easier and forts within the Pennsylvania mountain front to protect settlers from Native American raids, as diplomatic relations had been damaged due to the French and Indian War. Some of the most significant roads included the Conestoga Road and the Great Wagon Road.

Beginning in the early 19th century, wagons became larger as evident by the size increase of the wagon jacks over time. They were also hauled across rivers such as the Susquehanna River via ferry boats, and heavy wagon traffic for ferrying had resulted in wagons waiting in line for up to three days. It was used to some extent for travel to the western frontier, but it was generally too heavy, required too many draft animals for hauling, and was an expensive vehicle to build or purchase. Standard &quot;prairie schooners&quot; were much more often used since they were lighter, had sturdier wheels, and were cheaper. The perception of Conestoga wagons being the preferred vehicle of choice for traveling westward in North America is seemingly the result of them being better-represented in literature and media compared to the smaller prairie schooners. Still, by the 1840s, the Conestoga wagon saw usage in the Santa Fe Trail, being distinguished in purpose from the medium and light covered wagons used by settlers migrating to California or Oregon. Conestoga wagons saw also some usage by German immigrants of the British provinces of what is now Canada, typically carrying of goods, and roads were built to accommodate wagon travel.
Wagoners, especially in Pennsylvania, often stopped by at taverns, also at the time called &quot;stations&quot;. From Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, to Pittsburgh, there were about 150 taverns, or roughly 1 tavern for each mile. The inns of the 19th century often contained large signs containing painted figures and words that were mounted on posts at the highway to catch the attention of wagoners, including those who were illiterate. The taverns were numerous, but not all of them welcomed wagoners in for service. In the winter, the wagons were parked on planks so that the wheels would not freeze while the wagoners stayed in overnight. The taverns were normally crowded on busy days, and wagoners may have expected greetings from other tavern guests, ranging from fellow wagoners to community members meeting up there. Tavern keepers, generally influential men of their communities, made profits from selling liquor and meals to them, but their revenue mainly came from overnight stays, which would have cost less than $1.75. The next morning, wagoners followed typical schedules of eating breakfast then tending to their horses (i.e. feeding and watering them) before departing.

=== Decline ===

The Conestoga wagon&#x27;s extended period of use in North America gradually declined in the latter half of the early 19th century as technological change ushered in more practical alternatives. This was especially true in the state where the covered wagons had originated, Pennsylvania, as the introduction and spread of canals provided a cheaper and faster way to transport goods. Another major factor in the decline of Conestoga wagons was the construction of railroads, over whose lines companies like the Reading Company could haul goods such as coal or agricultural produce more efficiently than wagons. As a result, the use of Conestoga wagons later became largely restricted to rural areas. The displacement of Conestoga wagons by railroads and canals in the United States was a national trend. Despite the replacement not only of most wagons but also of the short-lived Pony Express mail service by more technologically advanced modes of transport, the US horse population did not experience a corresponding decline in numbers.

The decline of the Conestoga wagon and most other covered wagons in the later 19th century did not include the decline of all covered wagon variants, however. The Nissen Wagon, originating in North Carolina, was still a popular transport vehicle throughout the 19th century; contemporaneous production numbers reflect that high demand. In the early 20th century, the Nissen Wagon Works continued to produce Nissen Wagons in high numbers for southeastern states, but by the 1940s their use had declined.

== Legacy ==
By the American Civil War, Conestoga wagons were viewed in a romantic light by Americans. Several poems about Conestoga wagons and their wagoners were produced, such as &quot;The Wild Wagoner of the Alleghenies&quot; by Thomas Buchanan Read in 1863 and &quot;Wagoning&quot; by H. L. Fischer in 1888. There were many wagoner-based songs that were produced within the 19th century. &quot;The Wagoner&#x27;s Curse on the Railroad&quot; was a song sung in reflection of the saddened and disgruntled wagoners whose ways of life were displaced by the rise of the railroads. A brief 1937 poem for &quot;The Denver Post&quot; made a comparison of covered wagons and the more recent autotrailers, drawing upon the mythical status of Conestoga wagons to promote an autotrailer camping craze. However, the camping wagons failed to make the same cultural impacts that covered wagons had.

The legacy of the Conestoga wagon endured as a symbol of the early United States, being viewed in romantic light along with regular covered wagons in the 20th century. The popular image of the Conestoga wagon was roughly comparable to that of another American horse-drawn vehicle called the Concord coach. &quot;The Covered Wagon&quot;, a silent film released in 1923, was amongst the earliest cases of covered wagons in 20th-century popular culture. The &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; book series features a Conestoga wagon that was owned by the Ingalls family. The cultural depictions of the covered wagons represented American values of pioneering in its early history. The Conestoga wagon is also featured in tradition in the form of a sports trophy that the football teams of Dickinson College and Franklin &amp; Marshall College had competed for since 1963, and the wagon model of the trophy is meant to represent a Conestoga wagon that had transported the teams of both colleges back in 1889.

In the modern day, the legacy of Conestoga wagons declined mostly to books, paintings, and historical artifacts held by museums and private collections. Nonetheless, they have been preserved to tell American history and establish appreciation for historical relics. The National Museum of American History, as an example, featured a Conestoga wagon to encourage children to wonder about 19th-century American family lives within the wagons, especially their struggles.

<text>Melton Constable is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It covers an area of and had a population of 518 in 225 households at the 2001 census. The population had increased to 618 at the 2011 Census. For the purposes of local government, it falls within the district of North Norfolk. The village sits on fairly high ground south-west of Holt.

The place-name &quot;Melton Constable&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Maeltuna&quot;. This may mean either &#x27;middle town&#x27; or &#x27;mill town&#x27;. There is a reference to &#x27;Constabularius de Melton&#x27; in 1197, as the land was held by the constable of the bishop of Norwich.

Melton Constable Hall is regarded as the finest specimen of the Christopher Wren style of house.

St Peter&#x27;s, Melton Constable, the Church of England parish church, is located within Melton Constable park; it is a Grade I listed building. The church contains many monuments to the Astley family, who formerly resided at Melton Constable Hall.

The village was struck by an F0/T1 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.

The River Bure has its source in the parish, just south of the village, roughly half-way between the village and the parish church.

==Railway==


Melton Constable reached its heyday about 1911; in the census of that year, it had a population of 1,157. It was a new town built in 1880s at the junction of four railway lines, which came from Cromer, North Walsham, King&#x27;s Lynn and Norwich and linked Norfolk to the Midlands. Melton Constable railway station, with a platform long, was constructed with a specially-appointed waiting room for Lord Hastings, the local squire. The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway (M&amp;GNJR)&#x27;s main workshops and factory were also situated in the village, helping to give it the character of a rural industrialised village (rather similar to Woodford Halse in Northamptonshire). The workshops were often called the &quot;Crewe Works of North Norfolk&quot;. When in M&amp;GNJR hands, the works built 19 steam locomotives. 

Under LNER ownership, the works was gradually degraded until 1934 when it closed completely. Between 1959 and 1964, British Railways chose to close the lines, withdrawing both passenger and goods services from Melton Constable, which resulted in the slow decline of the village; it now lies stranded in the middle of a vast agricultural area which uses other forms of transport. In 1971, the station was demolished and the works were converted into an industrial estate; several railway buildings are extant and have found other uses.

The railways may eventually return to Melton Constable in future, as part of the Norfolk Orbital Railway&#x27;s plans to restore former railway lines.

==Burgh Parva==
The parish of Melton Constable includes the deserted former parish of Burgh Parva, notable for its ruined church and tin tabernacle replacement.

<text>Arthur Sherwood Flemming (June 12, 1905September 7, 1996) was an American government official. He served as the United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from 1958 until 1961 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s administration. Flemming was an important force in the shaping of Social Security policy for more than four decades. He also served as president of the University of Oregon, Ohio Wesleyan University, and Macalester College. In 1966, he was elected to a four-year term as president of the National Council of Churches, the leading Christian ecumenical organization in the United States. From 1974 to 1981, he was the chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights.

==Early life and education==
Flemming was born in Kingston, New York, to Judge Harry Hardwick Flemming and the former Harriet (née Sherwood). Flemming graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University, class of 1927 and a member of the Epsilon chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. On December 14, 1934, he married Bernice Virginia Moler. They had five children.

==Federal government career==
Flemming&#x27;s government career began in 1939, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him to the U.S. Civil Service Commission. While in this capacity, he was appointed to the Navy Manpower Survey Board under Vice Admiral Adolphus Andrews, which was established to determine whether shore establishments were over-manned or under-manned and whether Navy&#x27;s manpower was being utilized to the best possible advantage.

He was a member of the Hoover Commission, which studied the organization of federal government in the late 1940s and the early 1950s. Flemming was the chairman of the White House Conference on Aging in 1971, and was the appointed U.S. commissioner on Aging by President Richard M. Nixon.

Flemming was also a co-founder of the Save Our Security coalition, a Social Security advocacy group. He was the recipient of two Presidential Medals of Freedom, one in 1957, from President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the second one in 1994, from President Bill Clinton. Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala said of Flemming: &quot;He was one of the great intellects of social policy, combining extraordinary knowledge with a rare gift for policy-making.&quot;

==Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare==
From 1958 until 1961, Flemming served as U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, following the resignation of Marion B. Folsom. On November 9, 1959, Secretary Flemming announced, seventeen days before the Thanksgiving holiday, that some of the 1959 crop of cranberries contained traces of aminotriazole, a weed killer, which had been shown to cause thyroid cancer in rats in laboratory testing. Although the sale of cranberries was not banned, Flemming cautioned that if a housewife did not know where the berries in a product came from, &quot;to be on the safe side, she doesn&#x27;t buy&quot;. Flemming acknowledged the impact of his announcement before the holidays, but added &quot;I don&#x27;t have any right to sit on information of this kind.&quot;

After decreased sales of cranberries during the holiday season, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined, in January 1960, that 99 percent of the crop had not been contaminated. However, the incident did cause cranberry growers to cease using amitrole as an herbicide, as demanded by the farmers&#x27; largest consumer, the Ocean Spray company. Before 1959, cranberries were seldom consumed except during Thanksgiving and Christmas, and cranberry juice was available, but not popular. After the disastrous holiday season, Ocean Spray promoted the popularity of the juice, and the production of the berries was increased in the long run.

Flemming retired at the end of President Eisenhower&#x27;s administration on January 19, 1961. Later, he was the chairman of the Commission on Civil Rights.

==University president==

Barely out of his degree at AU, Flemming was petitioning Roosevelt for New Deal funds to start a program at American University. The program was the School of Public Affairs, and Flemming was its first director.

Flemming served as president of Ohio Wesleyan University. He was the university&#x27;s first president to be an alumnus and a layman (non-ordained minister). Having served in the Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman administrations, his Wesleyan inauguration at the June commencement of 1949 drew many famous speakers and celebrities.

From 1961 to 1968, Flemming served as president of the University of Oregon. During his popular and controversial tenure, the number of students grew from 8,000 to 14,000, and federal funding for the university rose dramatically. Flemming was responsible for the addition of the School of Community Services and Public Affairs, the Pine Mountain Observatory and the building of various laboratories on campus. He defended the right of the Communist Party, under the leadership of Gus Hall, to speak on campus and he also convinced Tom Autzen to contribute money toward to the building of Autzen Stadium.

From 1968 to 1971, Flemming served as president of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. During his short-lived tenure, he founded the Expanded Educational Opportunities (EEO) Program, which provided &quot;total aid,&quot; including room &amp; board, books, and travel expenses, to students from &quot;racial minority groups and economically deprived backgrounds.&quot; Flemming had a close relationship with Black student groups on campus, even marching with students to protest a St. Paul landlord who had refused to rent to Black students. Former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who returned briefly to Macalester (where he had previously taught) after losing the presidential election in 1968, also joined the march.

==Death==
He died of renal failure at a retirement home in Alexandria, Virginia, on September 7, 1996, at the age of 91. Flemming was buried at the Montrepose Cemetery in his hometown of Kingston, New York.

<doc id="971549" wikidata="Q1421761" url="?curid=971549" title="Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols">
<text>Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols is a Unicode block comprising styled forms of Latin and Greek letters and decimal digits that enable mathematicians to denote different notions with different letter styles. The letters in various fonts often have specific, fixed meanings in particular areas of mathematics. By providing uniformity over numerous mathematical articles and books, these conventions help to read mathematical formulas. These also may be used to differentiate between concepts that share a letter in a single problem.

Unicode now includes many such symbols (in the range U+1D400–U+1D7FF). The rationale behind this is that it enables design and usage of special mathematical characters (fonts) that include all necessary properties to differentiate from other alphanumerics, e.g. in mathematics an &quot;italic&quot; &quot;𝐴&quot; can have a different meaning from a &quot;roman&quot; letter &quot;A&quot;. Unicode originally included a limited set of such letter forms in its Letterlike Symbols block before completing the set of Latin and Greek letter forms in this block beginning in version 3.1. 

Unicode expressly recommends that these characters not be used in general text as a substitute for presentational markup; the letters are specifically designed to be semantically different from each other. Unicode does include a set of normal serif letters in the set. Still they have found some usage on social media, for example by people who want a stylized user name, and in email spam, in an attempt to bypass filters.

All these letter shapes may be manipulated with MathML&#x27;s attribute mathvariant.

Double-struck C, N, Q, R and Z are handwritten forms of the corresponding bold letters. They are not intended for print publication, and the rest of the series has no purpose. The four sans-serif series also have no purpose in mathematics. 

The introduction date of some of the more commonly used symbols can be found in the Table of mathematical symbols by introduction date.

==Tables of styled letters and digits==
These tables show all styled forms of Latin and Greek letters, symbols and digits in the Unicode Standard, with the normal unstyled forms of these characters shown with a cyan background (the basic unstyled letters may be serif or sans-serif depending upon the font). The styled characters are mostly located in the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols block, but the 24 characters in cells with a pink background are located in the letterlike symbols block, for example, ℛ () is at U+211B rather than the expected U+1D4AD which is reserved. In the code charts for the Unicode Standard, the reserved code points corresponding to the pink cell are annotated with the name and code point of the correct character. There are a few characters which have names that suggest that they should belong in the tables below, but in fact do not because their official character names are misnomers:

* ; &quot;despite its character name, this symbol is derived from a special italicized version of the small letter l&quot;. It has various other specialized uses, such as a liter symbol and as the azimuthal quantum number symbol.
* is a symbol for Weierstrass&#x27;s elliptic function. It is officially aliased as .

===Latin letters===
The Unicode values of the characters in the tables below, except those shown with or index values of &#x27;–&#x27;, are obtained by adding the base values from the &quot;U+&quot; header row to the index values in the left column (both values are hexadecimal).


===Greek letters and symbols===
The Unicode values of the characters in the tables below, except those shown with or index values of &#x27;–&#x27;, are obtained by adding the base values from the &quot;U+&quot; header row to the index values in the left column (both values are hexadecimal).


===Digits===
The Unicode values of the characters in the tables below are obtained by adding the hexadecimal base values from the &quot;U+&quot; header row to the index values in the left column.

===Glyph variants===
Variation selectors may be used to specify chancery (U+FE00) vs roundhand (U+FE01) forms, if a computer font is available that supports them:

<text>Matthias Sammer (; born 5 September 1967) is a German football official and former player and coach. He played as a defensive midfielder and later in his career as a sweeper.

With Borussia Dortmund as a player, Sammer won the Bundesliga and DFB-Supercup in 1995, the Bundesliga, DFB-Supercup, and European Footballer of the Year in 1996, and the UEFA Champions League and Intercontinental Cup in 1997. Germany won the UEFA Euro 1996 with Sammer as a player, where he was named the tournament&#x27;s best player, and was subsequently awarded the Ballon d&#x27;Or later that year. Sammer retired with 74 total caps, 23 for East Germany and 51 for the unified side. Known for his exceptional defensive skills, including his ability to read the game, make interceptions, and tackle effectively, Sammer is regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time.

With Sammer as a manager, Borussia Dortmund won the Bundesliga in 2002.

==Club career==

===Dynamo Dresden===

Sammer started his career at Dynamo Dresden when he joined the club&#x27;s youth team as a nine-year-old in 1976. He made his debut for the senior team under the management of his father, Klaus Sammer, in the 1985–86 season. Playing as a striker, he scored eight goals in his first season as Dynamo finished fifth in the DDR-Oberliga. After being moved to the left wing the following season by new manager Eduard Geyer, he eventually found his place in central midfield during the 1987–88 season.

In the 1988–89 season, Sammer was part of the Dynamo Dresden team which won the East German championship. The same season the club also reached the semi-final of the UEFA Cup where they were knocked out by West German club VfB Stuttgart. The following year Dynamo won the league and cup double, defending the DDR-Oberliga title and also winning the 1990 FDGB-Pokal.

Sammer was formally an officer of the Volkspolizei, as a player of Dynamo Dresden. He enrolled into the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment as a 19-year-old. Many players of Dynamo Dresden were assigned to the regiment for their military service. Sammer then served as a non-commissioned officer in the Guards Regiment for three years from 1987, holding the rank of sergeant in the Stasi. The President of SV Dynamo was the head of the Stasi Erich Mielke. Sammer has explained that he would not have been able to continue to play football for Dynamo Dresden if he had refused to serve with the Guards Regiment and that he never saw any weapon or took part in any military exercise. He has described his employment with the Guard Regiment as an alibi to play football to Dynamo Dresden.

===VfB Stuttgart===
In the summer of 1990, Sammer joined VfB Stuttgart of the Bundesliga. Sammer scored 11 times in his debut season as Stuttgart finished sixth in the Bundesliga. The following year Sammer scored nine goals, helping Stuttgart to become the first champions of the reunified Germany.

===Inter Milan===
After two seasons at Stuttgart, Sammer joined Italian club Inter Milan for the 1992–93 Serie A season. Though he was a success on the pitch, scoring four times in 11 appearances, including a goal against Juventus in the Derby d&#x27;Italia, Sammer failed to adapt to the Italian lifestyle and returned to Germany in January 1993.

===Borussia Dortmund===
In the winter break of the 1992–93 season, Sammer signed for Borussia Dortmund. He made 17 Bundesliga appearances in the second half of the season, scoring ten times.

The following season, Sammer was moved from midfield into the libero position by Dortmund coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. This move proved to be successful as Dortmund won back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 1994–95 and 1995–96, followed by the 1996–97 UEFA Champions League, with Sammer lifting the European Cup as captain after beating Juventus 3–1 in the final at Munich&#x27;s Olympiastadion.

Soon after winning the Champions League, Sammer&#x27;s career was cut short by injury. He made only three further Bundesliga appearances for Dortmund before suffering a serious knee injury which he failed to recover from and retired in 1998.

In addition to the two Bundesliga titles and one Champions League, Sammer also led Dortmund to two DFB-Supercups, in 1995 and 1996. Sammer himself was named Footballer of the Year (Germany) in both 1995 and 1996 and was named European Footballer of the Year in 1996, making him the first defender to win the Ballon d&#x27;Or since Franz Beckenbauer in 1976.

==International career==

===East Germany===

Sammer represented the GDR at every age group. He was part of the East German squads which won the 1986 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship and finished third at the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship.

In November 1986, he made his debut for the full East Germany national football team in a UEFA Euro 1988 qualifier against France at Zentralstadion in Leipzig.

On 12 September 1990, Sammer captained East Germany in its final match. He scored both goals as the GDR beat Belgium 2–0 in Brussels.

===Germany===

On 19 December 1990, Sammer debuted for the newly formed unified Germany national football team, which was mostly made up of the West Germany team that had won the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The match was played at his home stadium in Stuttgart and Germany ran out 4–0 winners against Switzerland.

Sammer was a member of the German squad for UEFA Euro 1992, where the team was beaten in the final by Denmark. He was also selected for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, as Germany was surprisingly knocked out by the underdog Bulgaria at the quarter-final stage.

In UEFA Euro 1996, Sammer played in the libero role he had been converted to at Borussia Dortmund. He scored the opening goal in Germany&#x27;s second group match against Russia and the winning goal against Croatia in the quarter-final. After Germany defeated the Czech Republic in the final, Sammer was named Player of the Tournament.

On 7 June 1997, Sammer played his final match for Germany in a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Ukraine in Kyiv. He did not take part at the 1998 FIFA World Cup due to injury.

==Style of play==
Sammer usually played as a sweeper during the height of his career, in particular in later years, although he was also capable of playing in several midfield and offensive roles; indeed, he was often deployed further up the pitch earlier in his career, including in a holding role, as an attacking midfielder, as a central midfielder, as a left winger, as a deep-lying playmaker, or even as a striker on occasion, courtesy of his technique, stamina, passing ability, and vision. Although he was not the most physically gifted defender, due to his slender frame, he was regarded as a world class player in his position, in particular due to his intelligence and positional sense, while he was also able to improve his tackling ability as his career progressed. Despite his more defensive playing role, he was also a talented and energetic player, who was known for his eye for goal, athleticism, elegance, finesse, and offensive capabilities, and had a penchant for undertaking individual forward runs with the ball towards the opposing penalty area. Beyond his skills as a footballer, he was also known as an influential player and a commanding presence on the pitch, who stood out for his charismatic leadership qualities, determination, bravery, and composure under pressure. Despite his ability and reputation as one of the greatest sweepers of all time, however, he was also known to be prone to injuries, which ultimately forced him to retire from professional football at the age of 31.

==Coaching and management career==
===Borussia Dortmund===
After retirement, Sammer became head coach of Borussia Dortmund on 1 July 2000. Sammer led Borussia Dortmund to another Bundesliga title in 2002. His team reached the 2001–02 UEFA Cup final the same year but lost 2–3 against Feyenoord. Sammer was sacked at the end of the 2003–04 season after Dortmund finished in sixth place.

===VfB Stuttgart===
Sammer returned to VfB Stuttgart as head coach for the 2004–05 season. Despite finishing one point off a Champions League qualifying position, Sammer left the club on 3 June 2005.

===German Football Association===
On 1 April 2006, he was appointed technical director of German Football Association (DFB), on a five-year contract. The position was new in the DFB at the time and had been initiated by national coach Jürgen Klinsmann, who undertook major structural reforms in the DFB during his short time of two years as a coach, with an impact lasting much longer than his actual term. The position included responsibility for the national youth teams, focusing on young talents between the ages of eleven and eighteen, as well as incorporating the latest developments in sports science into the DFB&#x27;s training theories. Sammer was also expected to work on a tactical system for all of Germany&#x27;s national sides in close co-operation with national coach Joachim Löw. He is credited of having led the declining quality of German football from its worst era at the beginning of the 2000s to new success through several talented players developed in the restructured youth system.

===Bayern Munich===
On 2 July 2012, he took over as Sporting Director of Bayern Munich and replaced Christian Nerlinger, who had been released following Bayern&#x27;s treble losses in Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League and because of his strained relationship with the club. As Sporting Director, Sammer was a member of the management board responsible for the professional playing staff of the club.

In his first season, Sammer orchestrated FC Bayern&#x27;s turnaround to the first treble in club history by claiming the 2012–13 Bundesliga, the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League and the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal in record-setting fashion. His communicative abilities to never get satisfied, always stress some critical details, keep pressure high and not getting into delight even during the most superior periods were especially lauded to have contributed to the historic success. In the next years three consecutive Bundesliga championships and two cup wins followed.

In spring 2016, he had a &quot;minute circulatory disorder in the brain&quot; and had to take a break from his work. During his recovery, he gained a new perspective on his work and family life and asked FC Bayern to release him from his position as sporting director which they granted. Afterwards Munich continued working without any sporting director for a year before they presented Hasan Salihamidžić as his replacement.

Following this he effectively retired, initially working as a pundit for Eurosport for a while but ruling out to continue this in the future. In 2018, he started to work part-time as an adviser for Borussia Dortmund, meeting with the club for talks every two weeks, and is regularly seen sitting next to Dortmund&#x27;s management during matches.

==Personal life==
Sammer is married and has three children, Sarah, Marvin, and Leon. He lives in Munich, Germany. He is the son of Klaus Sammer, a former player and manager of Dynamo Dresden.

<text>Nitrianske Pravno (; until 1946 &quot;Nemecké Pravno&quot; , / &quot;Deutsch Pranno&quot;, ) is a village and municipality in Prievidza District in the Trenčín Region of western Slovakia.

==History==
In historical records, the village was first mentioned in 1393. In 1430 it is mentioned as a small town belonging to the Bojnice Castle, with a gold mine nearby. It was prosperous in the 15th century, but as the 16th century came, it slowly began to decay, as the mines were exhausted and with many uprisings taking place at that time. It was degraded in 1886 from town status to large municipality status. The village belonged to a German language island. The German population was expelled in 1945.

==Geography==
The municipality lies at an altitude of 348 metres (1142 feet) and covers an area of 31.195 km² (12.045 mi²). It has a population of about 3,180 people. The municipality lies in the upper Nitra River valley region, 12 km north of Prievidza.

<text>The New Joint Endeavor for Welfare, Education, and Liberation, or New JEWEL Movement (NJM), was a Marxist–Leninist vanguard party in the Caribbean island nation of Grenada that was led by Maurice Bishop. 

Established in 1973, the NJM issued its manifesto prior to Grenada being granted independence from the United Kingdom in 1974. The NJM took control of Grenada with a bloodless coup in 1979 and ruled by decree as the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Government until 1983. In October of that year, Bishop and seven of his associates were killed by paramilitaries affiliated with hard-line elements in his own party. Those elements formed a military government, which was quickly deposed by a U.S. invasion later in October.

== Origin ==
The New JEWEL Movement (NJM) was established on 11 March 1973 as an alliance of (1) the Joint Endeavor for Welfare, Education, and Liberation (JEWEL); (2) the Organization for Revolutionary Education and Liberation (OREL); and (3) the Movement for Assemblies of the People (MAP). Although &quot;JEWEL&quot; was originally an acronym, since then NJM&#x27;s name has generally been spelled out as &quot;New Jewel Movement&quot;.

Maurice Bishop, a young lawyer who had returned to Grenada after being educated in England, and Unison Whiteman, the founder of JEWEL, were elected NJM&#x27;s Joint Coordinating Secretaries. The party&#x27;s manifesto was largely drafted by MAP&#x27;s prominent intellectual, Franklyn Harvey, who had been influenced by the writings of C.L.R. James.

In its early days, Bishop described the NJM as &quot;a political party aimed at raising consciousness and taking political power if the accepted processes didn’t allow for electoral change.&quot; The &quot;New Jewel&quot; newspaper, the party&#x27;s principal publication, featured the motto: &quot;Not Just Another Society – But a Just Society; Let Those who Labour Hold the Reins.&quot;

From 1973 to 1979, the NJM functioned as an opposition party. During those years, the country&#x27;s political situation became increasingly polarized and violent. For the 1976 general election, the NJM forged an electoral coalition, known as the People&#x27;s Alliance, with the Grenada National Party and United People&#x27;s Party. However, the coalition lost to Prime Minister Eric Gairy&#x27;s ruling Grenada United Labour Party. Many international observers branded the 1976 election as fraudulent. In the late 1970s, the NJM became more militant and formed the National Liberation Army (NLA), also known as &quot;the 12 Apostles&quot;.

== Revolution ==
On 13 March 1979, the NJM launched a revolutionary coup against the government of Prime Minister Gairy while he was away visiting the U.S. Within hours, the NJM gained control of the country&#x27;s military barracks, radio stations, government buildings, and police stations. Maurice Bishop then suspended the constitution and announced that the NJM was now a provisional revolutionary government, the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Government (PRG), with himself as Prime Minister.

Shortly after taking power, the NJM created the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army, granting them &quot;the powers of arrest and search as are vested in the members of the Royal Grenada Police Force.&quot;

After the revolution, the NJM described itself as a Marxist–Leninist vanguard party, but not a communist party because it didn&#x27;t believe it had advanced sufficiently to earn that label. According to the NJM, it &quot;practiced policies to reach a point where a communist party could be formed, but considered themselves unready, due to the party not being led by a proletarian class, and due to the low level of education in Marxist-Leninist politics.&quot;

== Foreign policy ==
The new government looked to Cuba for aid since the PRG had a &quot;strained relationship with the United States&quot; right from the outset. One of Bishop&#x27;s first major projects was to supersede the small Pearls Airport on the north end of the island with a large, modern Point Salines International Airport on the south end. Over 600 Cuban construction workers were brought in to assist in the project.

The NJM also worked closely with Cuba to provide assistance to left-wing revolutionary movements around the world, such as the South West African People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO) in Namibia and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) in El Salvador.

== Bishop&#x27;s fall and the American intervention ==
The leaders of the U.S. government, and several other Caribbean nations, expressed concerns about the NJM government because of its close ties with Cuba, its alleged military expansion, and its new airport that could be repurposed as a Soviet-Cuban airbase.

Meanwhile, the NJM ruling party started showing signs of internal dissension as early as July 1982. That&#x27;s when Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard, who was also the country&#x27;s finance minister, resigned from the Political Bureau of the NJM Central Committee. According to the recollections of Bishop&#x27;s press secretary Don Rojas, Coard&#x27;s reason for resigning was that &quot;he was not satisfied with the style of work and the priorities the Central Committee was addressing itself to. He was not more concrete than that.&quot; When several Central Committee members pressured Coard to be specific, he refused. Other members—who all came out of the OREL organization and were loyal to Coard (Rojas referred to them as the &quot;OREL clique&quot;)—backed his decision and allowed him to resign his party posts while retaining his state posts.

During the next year, Coard worked behind the scenes &quot;to advance the OREL people within the Central Committee to very influential positions. Three of them were elevated to the Political Bureau.&quot; By September 1983, the schism in NJM leadership had reached a crisis point. The &quot;Coard faction&quot; voiced their doubts about Prime Minister Bishop&#x27;s continuing effectiveness and attempted to convince him to accept a power-sharing arrangement with Coard, wherein the two men would be co-equal leaders of the country. After a couple weeks of consideration, Bishop rejected the idea, which precipitated a disastrous sequence of events.

On 13 October, Coard took control of the PRG and placed Bishop under house arrest. Bishop&#x27;s arrest, once it became known, triggered demonstrations and strikes throughout the country. On 19 October, Bishop was freed by a crowd estimated at 15,000 to 30.000 supporters. Bishop led the crowd to army headquarters at Fort Rupert. Eventually a military force from Fort Frederick (under Coard’s direction) arrived at the headquarters and fighting broke out. Many civilians were killed. Bishop and seven others—Jacqueline Creft, education minister; Norris Bain, housing minister; Unison Whiteman, foreign minister; and close supporters Fitzroy Bain, Keith Hayling, Evelyn Bullen and Evelyn Maitland—were lined up against a Fort Rupert courtyard wall and executed by firing squad. The military transported the bodies to an isolated peninsula known as Calivigny. &quot;Their remains were put in a pit with tires and other debris, and set on fire.&quot; The remains of Bishop and the others have never been found.

Immediately after Bishop&#x27;s execution, Hudson Austin formed a military government. He instituted a 24-hour curfew for four consecutive days under which anyone who left home without authorization would be shot on sight. Six days later, the United States invaded Grenada and overthrew the Austin government. As a consequence of the successful U.S. invasion and occupation, the NJM ceased to exist. 

In 1986, eighteen people involved in the murders of Bishop and the seven others were arrested and tried. Seventeen of them (they came to be known as the Grenada 17), including Coard and Austin, were found guilty and given lengthy prison sentences.

<text>Hascombe is a village and civil parish in Surrey, England. It is around southeast of Godalming in the Borough of Waverley. The settlement contains a large cluster of cottages and country estates, St Peter&#x27;s Church, the village green, a fountain, pond, a central public house and is surrounded by steep wooded hillsides.

==History==
The earliest records of the settlement are from 1241, in which it appears as &quot;Hasecumbe&quot; and under the modern spelling &quot;Hascombe&quot;. Additional variants from the 13th century include &quot;Hescumbe&quot; (1243), &quot;Hascumbe&quot; (1255), &quot;Hassecumbe&quot; (1266) and &quot;Escumbe&quot;. (). The second part of the name &quot;combe&quot;, is generally agreed to derive from the Old English (OE) &quot;cumb&quot;, meaning a valley. The first element &quot;Has&quot; may come from &quot;hese&quot; or &quot;hæse&quot; (OE) meaning &quot;brushwood&quot;, or from &quot;hægtesse&quot; (OE) meaning &quot;witch&quot;.

Above the village is Hascombe Hill, the site of an Iron Age multivallate hillfort. Pottery sherds recovered from the site suggest that it was occupied between 200 and 50 BCE.

Hascombe is thought to have been part of the Manor of Bramley until the early 14th century.

==Landmarks==

The public house, &quot;The White Horse&quot;, a 16th- or 17th-century building with many later extensions, is constructed from the local Bargate stone, a local term for the hard masonry material which is a type of limestone with traces of greensand.

In the southern part of the main street a metre-high, 4 metre square animal pound appears to the west: according to English Heritage, this is a stone 15th century construction and is listed for its uniqueness in the county.

===St Peter&#x27;s Church===
St Peter&#x27;s Church, which is grade II* listed, was rebuilt during the mid-19th century, and the new church consecrated in June 1864. The original church dated from the 13th century but by 1862, when Canon Vernon Musgrave became rector, it was described as being in a poor condition. The architect of the new church was Henry Woodyer, a pupil of William Butterfield. The church is built of local Bargate stone, with a simple nave, chancel, and lady chapel. The roof rafters are cusped and gilded. The stained-glass is mostly by Hardman Powell and the decoration is by J A Pippet, a freelance artist employed by Hardman.

The medieval rood screen, made from Jerusalem olive trees and featuring elaborate carvings and paintings, remains from the old church and was restored in 1864 and decorated by Hardman and Powell. The font of Purbeck marble dates back to 1690. 

Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman described the church as &quot;a Tractarian work of art&quot;. The walls of the nave are decorated with the scene of the ‘miraculous draught of fishes’ with &#x27;one hundred and fifty and three&#x27; fishes caught in a net dragged by the six disciples. Above the chancel arch is a painting of the Last Judgement, and on the inside of the arch is a picture of our Lord with angels. The walls of the choir and sanctuary have scenes from the Bible depicting the ministry of Angels. The stained glass in the chancel are scenes from the life of our Lord. The central window shows Christ on the cross. The reredos above the altar shows the Adoration of the Lamb. At the entrance to the chancel is a Victorian brass to Canon Vernon Musgrave. The pulpit panels show our Lord together with Noah, St Peter, and St John the Baptist. The west window by William Holland shows Jesus in the fishing boat calming the storm, in memory of Conyers Middleton who was rector from 1747 to his death in 1750. The Lady Chapel was created in 1935 and contains a squint window. The east window in the Lady Chapel is by Clayton and Bell and the lancet windows by Hardman Powell commemorating the Godman family.

The damming of a stream in the 15th century created the Church Pond.

==Geography==
Hascombe&#x27;s natural fresh-water spring attracts many visitors: the fountain itself was commissioned in 1887 by local landowner Edward Lee Rowcliffe as a memorial to his late brother.

===Hills===
A promontory that adjoins Hascombe Hill from 1796 to 1816 Hascombe hosted a station in the shutter telegraph chain which connected the Admiralty in London to its naval ships in Portsmouth.

Hascombe has the following summits in the large Surrey Hills AONB:

==Residents==

Hascombe is in a ward, Bramley, Busbridge and Hascombe, which has much higher than average home ownership than the South East Region and nation. Current and former residents include the film star Dirk Bogarde; Russian businessman Boris Berezovsky; former member of The Jam, Bruce Foxton; boss of McLaren F1 Formula One racing team, Ron Dennis; broadcaster Chris Evans; and actor Billie Piper.

The wildlife artist Archibald Thorburn lived and died in the village. His grave lies in the parish churchyard. It was during a stay at Hoe Farm in 1915 that statesman and future Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill learned to paint.

<doc id="971561" wikidata="Q5543759" url="?curid=971561" title="George Reavey">
<text>George Reavey (1 May 1907 – 11 August 1976) was a Russian-born Irish surrealist poet, publisher, translator and art collector. He was also Samuel Beckett&#x27;s first literary agent. In addition to his own poetry, Reavey&#x27;s translations and critical prose helped introduce 20th century Russian poetry to an English-speaking audience. He was also the first publisher to bring out a collection of English translations of the French surrealist poet Paul Éluard.

Perhaps one of the most controversial aspects of Reavey&#x27;s literary career was his claim, made to the New York press and to British editor and publisher Alan Clodd, that he had written &quot;The Painted Bird&quot; for Jerzy Kosiński.

==Early life and work==
Reavey&#x27;s father, Daniel Reavey, was a flax engineer from Belfast and his mother, Sophia Turchenko, was Russian. He was born in Vitebsk and the family moved to Nizhni Novgorod in 1909, where the young poet was educated and became a fluent Russian speaker. When Daniel was arrested in 1919, during the Russian Civil War, mother and son fled to Belfast.

Reavey attended the Royal Belfast Academical Institution until 1921, at which point the family moved to Fulham, London. Here he attended the Sloan School. He spent the summer holidays in Belfast, where he recorded folk ballads and Gaelic poetry in a series of notebooks. In 1926, he entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he studied history and literature. Then he became associated with the group of Cambridge writers associated with the magazine &quot;Experiment&quot;, including William Empson, Jacob Bronowski, Charles Madge, Kathleen Raine and Julian Trevelyan. He contributed prose and poetry to &quot;Experiment&quot; along with translations from Boris Pasternak.

==The Paris years==
In 1929, Reavey moved to Paris with his friend Trevelyan. Ostensibly, this was so that he could improve his French for the entry examinations for the Indian Civil Service, but in fact he was in search of an entry into the &quot;avant garde&quot; artistic circles based in that city. He met Thomas MacGreevy, who introduced him to Beckett, James Joyce, Brian Coffey and Denis Devlin and to many of the writers who published in &quot;transition&quot;. He also became a regular contributor to Samuel Putnam&#x27;s &quot;The New Review&quot;. Putnam published Reavey&#x27;s first book, &quot;Faust&#x27;s Metamorphoses&quot; in 1932, a series of twenty vers libre monologues based on Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; with illustrations by S. W. Hayter who worked with Trevelyan at Atelier 17.

Around this time, Reavey started his literary agency the Bureau Littéraire Européen
(later the European Literary Bureau) and his Europa Press imprint. The first three books from the press were Reavey&#x27;s own &quot;Nostradam&quot; (1932) and &quot;Signes d&#x27;Adieu&quot;, and Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Echo&#x27;s Bones and Other Precipitates&quot; (both 1935).

==London and the Second World War==
Just after publishing &quot;Echo&#x27;s Bones&quot;, Reavey moved this agency and press to London. This move can be placed in a context of a general surrealist exodus from the French capital. Between 1934 and 1936, Trevelyan, David Gascoyne, Herbert Read, Roland Penrose and E. L. T. Mesens made similar moves. As a result, London became a hub of surrealist-related exhibitions and publishing. Reavey found himself extremely active in this scene, collecting paintings, contributing to Read&#x27;s &quot;Surrealism&quot; (1936) and representing authors via the Bureau. His most notable client was Beckett, whose novel &quot;Murphy&quot; Reavey (unsuccessfully) attempted to place with a publisher.

To coincide with the opening of the International Surrealist Exhibition in 1936, Europa Press published &quot;Thorns of Thunder&quot;, the first collection of English translations of poems by Paul Éluard to appear. The book featured a drawing by Pablo Picasso and a preface by Read, and the translators included Reavey, Beckett, Devlin, Gascoyne, Man Ray and Ruthven Todd.The press produced four more books, one each by Devlin, Coffey and Charles Henri Ford and Reavey&#x27;s &quot;Quixotic Perquisitions&quot; (1939).

With the outbreak of World War II, Reavey first went to the Soviet occupied zone of Poland to rescue his mother. He then closed down the press and bureau and joined the Foreign Office, serving in Madrid and the Soviet Union. Returning to London in 1945, he published &quot;Soviet Literature Today&quot; (1946) and on the back of this book he was able to move to New York to teach Russian literature.

==Later life and work==
Apart from occasional trips to Paris, London, Dublin and Belfast, Reavey lived out his life in the United States, where he published a number of important translations, including Alexander Esenin-Volpin&#x27;s &quot;A Leaf of Spring&quot; (1961), Fyodor Abramov&#x27;s &quot;New Life: A Day on a Collective Farm&quot; (1963), the bilingual anthology &quot;The New Russian Poets 1953 – 1968&quot; (1968) and contributions to Yevgeny Yevtushenko&#x27;s &quot; Stolen Apples&quot; (1972).

As a poet, Reavey fell more or less out of the public eye after moving to the States. However, he continued to publish collections including &quot;Colours of Memory&quot; (1955) and &quot;Seven Seas&quot; (1971). This latter was issued by Coffey from his Advent Press imprint. A group of seven Reavey poems were printed in the 1971 1930s special issue of &quot;The Lace Curtain&quot; and he was represented in John Montague&#x27;s &quot;Faber Book of Irish Verse&quot; (1974).

<text>Mae Questel (; born Mae Kwestel; September 13, 1908 – January 4, 1998) was an American actress. She was best known for providing the voices for the animated characters Betty Boop (from 1931) and Olive Oyl (from 1933). 

Questel began her career in vaudeville, primarily working as an impressionist. She later performed on Broadway and in films and television, including her role as Aunt Bethany in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989).

==Early career and Betty Boop==
Born Mae Kwestel in the Bronx, New York City, to Simon and Freida (née Glauberman) Kwestel, she attended Morris High School and studied acting at the American Theatre Wing and with the Theatre Guild. Although she wanted to be an entertainer, her parents, who were Orthodox Jews, actively discouraged her from doing so, at one point forcing her to leave the Theatre Guild school.

Nevertheless, at the age of 17, Questel won a talent contest held at the RKO Fordham Theatre in the Bronx by imitating actress and singer Helen Kane. She was signed by an agent and began performing in vaudeville as an impersonator. Billed as &quot;Mae Questel – Personality Singer of Personality Songs&quot;, she did impressions of Fanny Brice, Marlene Dietrich, Eddie Cantor, Mae West, Maurice Chevalier and others, as well as doing animal imitations. 

She was seen by animator Max Fleischer, who was looking for an actress to provide the voice for his Betty Boop character. Questel&#x27;s &quot;Boop-boop-a-doop&quot; routine, done in a style similar to the version Helen Kane created, while at the same time evoking something of the naughty allure of film star Clara Bow, was exactly what Fleischer wanted, and he hired Questel in 1931. She began as one of a number of actresses providing the character&#x27;s voice, but soon took over the role exclusively.

From 1931 until 1938, Questel provided the voice of Betty Boop in more than 80 animated shorts, the longest run for any actress doing that voice. During the 1930s, she released a recording of &quot;On the Good Ship Lollipop&quot; which sold more than two million copies. In 1988, she reprised her role as Betty Boop in a cameo appearance in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, which was Questel&#x27;s most extensive work for Disney; she had provided brief additional voices for some of Disney&#x27;s earlier films. Along with her voice work, and occasional on-camera appearance in Paramount shorts, Questel also attended Columbia University, where she studied drama.

==Voice of Olive Oyl==
Beginning in 1933, Questel provided the voice for Olive Oyl in the Max Fleischer Popeye cartoons. She made her debut with &quot;I Eats Me Spinach&quot; and essentially became the permanent voice until her hiatus to start a family in 1938. She reportedly based Olive&#x27;s nasal vocal quality and expression, &quot;Oh, dear!&quot;, on the character actress ZaSu Pitts.

When Hanna-Barbera began making the &quot;All New Popeye&quot; cartoons for television in 1978, Questel auditioned for the role of Olive Oyl but lost out to Marilyn Schreffler.

==Voice of Betty Boop==
Starting in 1938, Margie Hines, who was the original voice of Betty Boop, replaced Mae Questel when production made the transition from New York to the Miami Studio, Florida. Questel returned as the voice of Olive Oyl in 1944 after the studio reorganized as Famous Studios, Paramount Pictures and had returned to New York, a role in which she would remain until 1962. She also filled in for Jack Mercer as the voice of Popeye for a small number of cartoons, made when Mercer was temporarily drawn into war service, alongside Floyd Buckley and Harry Foster Welch.

==Other voices==
In addition to her signature voices of Olive Oyl and Betty Boop, Questel also provided the voice of Little Audrey. In 1958, she voiced Wendy the Good Little Witch in the theatrical Casper cartoon short &quot;Which is Witch&quot;. In the 1950s, she was the voice for the title character of the pioneering interactive Saturday-morning cartoon series &quot;Winky Dink and You&quot;. She provided the voice of Casper, the Friendly Ghost in Golden Records&#x27; &quot;Casper the Friendly Ghost and Little Audrey Says&quot; in 1962.

In &quot;The Flintstones&quot; series she voiced characters from the spin-offs &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot;, &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Hour&quot; and the &quot;Flintstone Frolics&quot;. She voiced Wiggy Rockstone after the original voice actress, Gay Autterson, left the role in 1982.

She continued to provide the voices of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl in commercials, television specials and elsewhere for the rest of her life. In 1988, she reprised her role as Betty Boop in the film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

In 1935, Mae Questel played the voice of the Woman in the Shoe in the Max Fleischer cartoon, &quot;The Kids in the Shoe&quot;.

==On-camera roles==
Questel played a number of small parts, including appearing with Rudy Vallee as Betty Boop in the 1931 short &quot;Musical Justice (1931)&quot; and as a nurse in &quot;The Musical Doctor&quot; in 1932.

In 1962, she played a Jewish mother in an episode of crime drama &quot;Naked City.&quot;

In 1961, she was seen as a middle-aged bride in Jerry Lewis&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s Only Money&quot;, one of Fanny Brice&#x27;s mother&#x27;s card-playing friends at the start of the film &quot;Funny Girl&quot; in 1968, and as the &quot;Jewish Mama from Hell&quot; in &quot;New York Stories&quot; in 1989 in Woody Allen&#x27;s segment titled &quot;Oedipus Wrecks&quot;; she had earlier sung the song &quot;Chameleon Days&quot; on the soundtrack for Allen&#x27;s film &quot;Zelig&quot; in 1983. Her last non-voice appearance was as the elderly Aunt Bethany in 1989&#x27;s &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot;.

In 1973, Questel had a role in the short-lived ABC television sitcom &quot;The Corner Bar&quot;, but she achieved perhaps her greatest visibility in television commercials, notably playing &quot;Aunt Bluebell&quot; in ads for Scott Towels from 1971 to 1979, and appeared in spots for Playtex, Folger&#x27;s Coffee and others. She also appeared on panel shows and in daytime soap operas.

==Broadway==
Questel appeared on Broadway four times:
* &quot;Doctor Social&quot; (1948) with Dean Jagger
* Leonard Spigelgass&#x27; &quot;A Majority of One&quot; (1959) with Cedric Hardwicke and Barnard Hughes – she reprised her role (as &quot;Essie Rubin&quot;) in the film adaptation
* &quot;Enter Laughing&quot; (1963) based on the novel by Carl Reiner, with Alan Arkin, Alan Mowbray, Sylvia Sidney and Michael J. Pollard and
* &quot;Bajour&quot; (1964), the Walter Marks musical, starring Herschel Bernardi, Nancy Dussault and Chita Rivera

==Personal life==
Questel married Leo Balkin on December 22, 1930, and they were divorced prior to 1950. She married Jack E. Shelby on November 19, 1970; they remained married until his death. She had two sons, Robert Balkin and Richard Balkin.

==Politics==
Questel was a Democrat who supported Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign during the 1952 presidential election.

==Death==
Questel died on January 4, 1998, from complications related to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at the age of 89 in her Manhattan apartment. She was buried in New Montefiore Cemetery in West Babylon, New York.

<text>Igor Ivanovich Belanov () or Ihor Ivanovych Bielanov (; born 25 September 1960) is a Soviet and Ukrainian former professional footballer who played as a striker.

He made a name for himself at Dynamo Kyiv, winning five major titles as well as the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 1986 and became the second Ukrainian national to win the award after Oleh Blokhin (1975). He then spent six years in Germany with Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Bundesliga and Eintracht Braunschweig in the 2. Bundesliga, with little success.

Belanov represented the Soviet Union at one World Cup and one European Championship. He was included in the list of the top 100 World Cup footballers of all time by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2014. In 2011, he, Oleh Blokhin and Vitaliy Starukhin were named as the &quot;legends of Ukrainian football&quot; at the Victory of Football awards.

==Club career==

===Beginnings and Dynamo Kyiv===
Belanov was born in Odesa, Ukraine, Soviet Union. He started playing professionally in his hometown, with SKA Odesa and FC Chornomorets Odesa, joining country giants FC Dynamo Kyiv in 1985, and scoring ten goals in his first season, which ended with league and cup conquest.

Along with teammates Oleh Blokhin and Oleksandr Zavarov, Belanov led the scoring charts at the 1985–86 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (five apiece) as Dynamo won the competition for the second time. He played the full 90 minutes in the final against Atlético Madrid (3–0).

===Germany===
Midway through 1989, 29-year-old Belanov got the long-awaited clearance to join a Western European side, making a move to Germany to join Borussia Mönchengladbach. His debut in the Bundesliga came on 4 November 1989 in a 4–0 away defeat against VfB Stuttgart, but he failed to impress overall, scoring only five goals in his one-and-a-half-season stint.

Belanov&#x27;s reputation at the club diminished further in January 1990, when he and his wife were among five Soviet citizens arrested for shoplifting clothes worth Deutsche Mark. Belanov protested that he was innocent, and was found guilty, being fined DM. He had faced financial problems due to his demand to be paid in U.S. dollars, which he trusted more than the mark, but which had suddenly declined in value.

Belanov moved to 2. Bundesliga&#x27;s Eintracht Braunschweig in January 1991, for a fee of DM. He made his debut for his new club on 23 February, and went on to net 21 times in the competition in three seasons combined, also suffering relegation in 1992–93 without making a single appearance.

===Retirement===
In 1995 Belanov returned home to Chernomorets for one season, retiring at almost 37 after a spell with FC Illychivets Mariupol, appearing in only five games in two seasons combined.

==International career==
Belanov played 33 matches for the Soviet Union, scoring eight goals. His best performance came at the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, where he netted four and assisted for six others as the team (which comprised 13 Dynamo Kyiv players) reached the round-of-16; he scored a hat-trick in the game against Belgium, in a losing extra time effort (4–3).

This performance at the World Cup, along with Dynamo&#x27;s Cup Winners&#x27; Cup success, helped Belanov win the European Footballer of the Year award. He was also part of the squad that reached the final of UEFA Euro 1988, where the national side faced the Netherlands. With the score at 2–0 for the Netherlands, USSR were awarded a penalty: he took it, but saw goalkeeper Hans van Breukelen save his effort as the score remained 2–0 until full time, giving the Netherlands the European title. He won 33 caps between 1985 and 1990.

==Style of play==
Belanov was noted for his athleticism, in particular for his running speed and powerful goal strikes. He was one of the fastest sprinters among Soviet footballers of all times, together with Oleh Blokhin. However, while Blokhin was trained by his parents, who were both competitive sprinters, Belanov never received a formal sprint training; yet he ran the 50 metres in a hand-timed 5.7 seconds, corresponding to a mere 0.3 seconds slower than the world record at the time.

==Post-retirement==
Belanov turned to business after finishing his playing career. He returned to prominence when he became the majority shareholder at Switzerland&#x27;s FC Wil, in August 2003. His predecessor, banker Andreas Hafen, had been given a five-year prison sentence after embezzling 51 million Swiss francs ($40 million) from the &quot;UBS Bank&quot;.

Belanov&#x27;s first move at Wil was replacing first-team manager Martin Andermatt with his former Dynamo Kyiv teammate Oleksandr Zavarov, not taking note of the fact that he lacked the necessary UEFA licence to manage a European top-division outfit. That circumstance forced Belanov to sign former FC Karl-Marx-Stadt manager Joachim Müller. Due to the appointment of Müller, Zavarov&#x27;s job was officially described as director of football; Müller did not last long as coach however, as Belanov sacked him just after three months, replacing him with Tomáš Matějček.

Matejcek&#x27;s strict training regiment caused a quick revolt amongst Wil players. This forced Belanov to make amends for his decisions and to re-appoint Müller as manager, and hand the assistant-manager role to former Swiss international goalkeeper Stephan Lehmann. Those turned out to be Belanov&#x27;s last series of actions as Wil&#x27;s major shareholder as, in a quick sequence, he pulled out of his chairman and shareholder role of the club.

Additionally, Belanov also owned a football school in Odesa, Ukraine, which carried his name.

In 2018 joined the board of strategic development Ukrainian Association of Football.

Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine 2022, Belanov joined the Territorial Defence Battalion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces of his hometown Odesa.

<doc id="971572" wikidata="Q7501906" url="?curid=971572" title="Short Seamew">
<text>The Short SB.6 Seamew was a British aircraft designed in 1951 by David Keith-Lucas of Shorts as a lightweight anti-submarine platform to replace the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm (FAA)&#x27;s Grumman Avenger AS 4 with the Reserve branch of the service. It first flew on 23 August 1953, but, due to poor performance coupled with shifting defence doctrine, it never reached service and only 24 production aircraft had flown before the project was cancelled. It has been described as a &quot;camel amongst race-horses&quot;.

==Design and development==
The Short Seamew was selected to fulfill Admiralty Specification M.123D for a simple, lightweight anti-submarine aircraft capable of unassisted operation from any of the Royal Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers in all but the worst of conditions, in particular escort carriers which the UK still had in considerable numbers from the Second World War. Although specifically designed for naval operations, the Seamew was also intended for land-based use by the RAF. It was to be suitable for mass production and operation by the Air Branch of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). This specification was in response to the alarming increase in capabilities of the Soviet submarine forces following the Second World War.
Three prototypes were ordered in April 1952 and the first flight (&quot;XA209&quot;), piloted by test pilot Sqn. Ldr. Walter J. &quot;Wally&quot; Runciman, took place on 23 August 1953. This same aircraft, also piloted by Runciman, took part in the 1953 Farnborough Airshow three weeks later. In 1954 both &quot;XA209&quot; and the second prototype &quot;XA213&quot; took part at Farnborough, where the following year both prototypes and two production AS Mk 1 models (&quot;XE171&quot; and &quot;XE172&quot;) gave a formation display.

The fourth Seamew prototype (&quot;XE175&quot;) was flown by Runciman for a series of sales tours in 1956 to Italy (March), Yugoslavia (April) and West Germany (May). It was this same aircraft in which Runciman was killed when it crashed during the Sydenham (Belfast) Air Display on 9 June 1956, when he attempted a loop. Rumours that the crash had been caused by a material failure were current at the time, but the accident investigation board did not confirm them.

The MR Mark 2 for use by Coastal Command was similar in every respect to the AS Mk 1 except that it was optimised for land-based use from hastily prepared airstrips. Naval equipment was deleted although manual wing folding was retained. Slightly heavier than the naval version, the MR Mk 2 had oversize low pressure tyres and could carry a higher weapons load.

===Design===


The pilot and observer were located in tandem cockpits located high up in the front of the deep, narrow fuselage, creating a decidedly &quot;curious&quot; profile. They sat atop the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba turboprop in front and the weapons bay to the rear of them. The design had originally called for the tried and tested Rolls-Royce Merlin piston engine but the Royal Navy had made it policy to phase out piston engines, in order that supplies of highly flammable high octane aviation fuel need not be carried in large quantities on ships. The turboprop engine also caused less airframe vibration so that the pilot could be sat directly over it with the absence of a piston engine ignition system which would have interfered with the radar scanner mounted below the engine housing.

For simplicity, and so that a nosewheel would not obscure the forward field of the radar scanner, a fixed tailwheel undercarriage was used. The long stroke necessary on the main undercarriage to allow for heavy deck landings while giving the radar scanner and propeller adequate clearance from the ground resulted in an alarming attitude on the ground and the cockpits mounted at a seemingly perilous height. For landing the tailwheel extended so it could land at a more level attitude.

The pilot and observer sat very far forward in order for the pilot to have a reasonable field of downward vision for takeoff and landing and so that both he and the observer had a good field of view for spotting surface vessels even when in level flight.

The large, broad-chord wings featured power-folding and pylons for the carriage of rockets, depth charges, flares and small bombs. The large, slab-like tailplane was mounted high on the vertical stabiliser, requiring the rudder to be split into upper and lower sections. The fixed undercarriage legs could be jettisoned in the event of ditching.

The weapons bay was 14 ft long and 3 ft wide. By omitting the rotating radar scanner, it could be extended to 17 ft in order to carry longer weapons.

===Handling characteristics===
The handling characteristics of the Seamew were poor. The prototypes were heavily modified with fixed leading-edge slats, slots added in the trailing-edge flaps, alterations to the ailerons and slats added to the tailplane roots. Although something of an improvement over the initial models, the handling was never wholly satisfactory. Arthur Pearcy wrote &quot;only Short Brothers&#x27; test pilot Wally Runciman seemed able to outwit its vicious tendencies and exploit its latent manoeuvrability to the limit.&quot;

The stall speed of the Seamew was 50 knots and it required only 50% of engine power to maintain flight. Runciman said &quot;take off and landing are simple and straightforward&quot;, &quot;it is, in fact, impossible to bounce the Seamew&quot;, and that its performance in crosswinds was &quot;outstanding&quot;.

==Operational history==

An order was placed in February 1955 for 60 aircraft (split evenly between the FAA and RAF), with Seamew &quot;XA213&quot; successfully completing carrier trials on HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; in July and December 1955. Naval service flight trials with two Seamews were carried out with 700 Naval Air Squadron in November 1956, which included catapult trials and around 200 takeoffs and landings on HMS &quot;Warrior&quot;.

The RAF lost interest after four Mk 2s were built with three of them converted to AS1 standard; the fourth (&quot;XE175&quot;) was flown by S/L W. &quot;Wally&quot; J. Runciman for a series of sales tours in 1956 to Italy (March), Yugoslavia (April) and West Germany (May).

Meanwhile, the FAA decided that the RNVR Avengers would be replaced by Seamews, but only four had been taken on charge by the time the RNVR squadrons were disbanded in March 1957 in keeping with the 1957 Defence White Paper, before any Seamews were allocated to them. Seven aircraft eventually delivered to the FAA were scrapped at RNAS Lossiemouth, and the other 11, complete and awaiting delivery, were scrapped at Sydenham. The last surviving Seamew, &quot;XE180&quot; which had been purchased by Shorts on 31 August 1959 for ground instruction at its Apprentice Training School, was scrapped in 1967.

The Rolls-Royce Heritage Trust owns several Armstrong Siddeley Mamba engines once fitted to Seamews.

<text>The Young and Dangerous film series () is a collection of Hong Kong films about a group of young triad members, detailing their adventures, dangers and growth in a Hong Kong triad society. The series is based on a popular comic book series known as &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; (古惑仔).

The series contributed a lot to the public image of triads and was condemned by certain quarters as glorifying secret triad societies. However, it was immensely popular in Hong Kong and spawned nine sequels and spin-offs. Its main actors and actresses have also become major stars in their own right.

Andrew Lau served as cinematographer and director for parts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 as well as the spinoff &quot;Born to Be King&quot; and the prequel film, with radio personality Manfred Wong writing scripts for the ongoing franchise.

==The Series==

===Andrew Lau===

====The Young and Dangerous Saga (1996–2000)====
* Young and Dangerous () (1996)
:&quot;Young and Dangerous&quot; tells the story of Chan Ho Nam (Ekin Cheng), &quot;Chicken&quot; Chiu (Jordan Chan), Dai Tin-Yee (Michael Tse), Pou Pan (Jerry Lam), his brother Chow Pan (Jason Chu) and Smartie (Gigi Lai) during their inclusion into the &quot;Hung Hing&quot; Society. The focus is on internal squabbling within the triad, spearheaded by &quot;Ugly Kwan&quot; (Francis Ng).

* Young and Dangerous 2 () (1996) 
:The story in &quot;Young and Dangerous 2&quot; is told in two parts: the first focuses on Chicken and his exile in Taiwan skipped over in the first film. The second half deals with the Hung Hing Society trying to ally with Chicken&#x27;s Taiwanese triad &quot;San Luen&quot;. The character &quot;Banana Skin&quot; (Jason Chu) is recruited into Ho Nam&#x27;s circle. At the same time, an election to obtain the branch leadership status of Causeway Bay is underway, with Chan Ho Nam as its prime candidate, until a rivalry breaks out between him and another Hung Hing member, &quot;Tai Fei&quot; (Anthony Wong).

* Young and Dangerous 3 () (1996)
:Chan Ho Nam and Chicken are back again in &quot;Young and Dangerous 3&quot;, this time taking on the rival &quot;Tung Sing&quot; triad, who is attempting to usurp Hung Hing influence in Hong Kong by having Tung Sing member &quot;Crow&quot; (Roy Cheung) frame Ho Nam for the murder of Hung Hing chairman Chiang Tin Sang (Simon Yam). On the plus side, Chicken finds a new love interest in Wasabi (Karen Mok), the daughter of the comedic priest, Father &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; Lam.

* Young and Dangerous 4 () (1997)
:When the branch leader position is open for Tuen Mun, Chicken decides to run for it and is up against fellow Hung Hing member &quot;Barbarian&quot;, who resorts to ruthless Tung Sing member &quot;Thunder Tiger&quot; (Roy Cheung) for help in his candidacy. The triad also has to deal with finding a new chairman to the Hung Hing Society, Chiang Tin Yeung (Alex Man), Chiang Tin Sang&#x27;s older brother, who resides in Thailand. &quot;Young and Dangerous 4&quot; also brings in new characters first appearing among the Hung Hing ranks, such as &quot;Sister 13&quot; (Sandra Ng), Ben Hon (Vincent Wan) and &quot;Prince&quot; (Ken Lo).

* Young and Dangerous 5 () (1998)
:Although Chicken does not make an appearance, Chan Ho Nam finds a new love interest in the form of Mei Ling (Shu Qi) and Big Head (Chin Kar-lok). Meanwhile, Tung Sing returns to cause trouble again for Hung Hing, in the form of new leader Szeto Ho Nam (Mark Cheng). &quot;Young and Dangerous 5&quot; occurs during the transfer of Hong Kong sovereignty to China, with the &quot;boys&quot; becoming &quot;men&quot;, as they develop and mature into more business-like dealings.

* Young and Dangerous: The Prequel () (1998) 
:Showcasing the earlier years of Chan Ho Nam (Nicholas Tse), Big Head (Daniel Wu), Chow Pan (Benjamin Yuen) and Chicken (Sam Lee), this prequel tells of their time during their willingness to follow Hung Hing&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Bee&quot;.

* Born to Be King () (2000)
:&quot;Born to Be King&quot;, also known as &quot;Young and Dangerous 6&quot;, is the last and final instalment to the mainstream franchise and characters. This film is a return to form for the series with what is considered a fitting end by fans. Chicken is set to marry Nanako (Anya), the daughter of Japanese yakuza son Akira Kusaraki (Roy Cheung), Jason (Jason Chu) and Lui Fu-kwan (Peter Ho) to tie relationships between the Taiwanese San Luen triad and Kurasaki&#x27;s clan. When Chicken is set up and framed again for murder, he seeks his old friends from Hung Hing to clear his name.

=== Cha Chuen-yee ===
* Once Upon a Time in Triad Society () (1996)
:The story of a gangster &quot;Ugly Kwan&quot; (Francis Ng)&#x27;s rise and fall in the Triads. This is a sort of spin-off from the Young and Dangerous series. While Ng is basically reprising his role as Ugly Kwan from Young and Dangerous 1 and the priest from the series (Lam) makes an appearance, their ends don&#x27;t mesh with the Y&amp;D storyline.

* Once Upon a Time in Triad Society 2 () (1996)
:Not a continuation of the original, the sequel stars Ng in the role of Dagger who has a reputation for being good with fighting. In reality his reputation has been overblown by rumours and he uses his wit to get out of lethal situations.

=== Yip Wai Man===
* Portland Street Blues () (1998) 
:&quot;Portland Street Blues&quot; is the first spin-off to the franchise, providing a different contrast to the familiar &quot;Young and Dangerous&quot; films with more character development. This time, the story&#x27;s focus centres on &quot;Sister 13&quot;. In a triad underworld dominated by men, the film tells the story of how she faces the trials and tribulations of rising to become the Hung Hing&#x27;s branch leader of Portland Street, and her willingness to forgo a heterosexual relationship. The film also gives more details and insights on the rival Tung Sing triad and the mutual friendship between Sister 13 and Ben Hon.

* Those Were The Days... () (2000)
:This semi-prequel/spin-off follows the life of Chicken before he joined the Hung Hing triad. The film co-stars Gigi Leung as Chicken&#x27;s childhood friend and Kristy Yang as Cheung May Yun.

=== Kant Leung ===
* The Legendary &#x27;Tai Fei&#x27; () (1999) 
:In another spin-off, after Tai Fei obtains branch leadership status of North Point in &quot;Young and Dangerous 4&quot;, he discovers he has a son. Worse yet, his son is a member of the hated Tung Sing triad, now dealing in narcotics.

* Sexy and Dangerous 2 (2000)
:Sequel to the first spin-off

=== Felix Chong ===
* Once a Gangster () (2010)
:Once a Gangster is a 10th year anniversary spin-off parody. This film does not directly follow the mainstream plot. The film is an action comedy. Both Ekin Cheng and Jordan Chan are starred in the film as &quot;Sparrow&quot; and &quot;Roast Pork&quot;.

===Billy Hin-Shing Tang===
* Sexy and Dangerous (1996) 
:Another spin-off from the series.

===Jingle Ma Chor-Sing===
* Goodbye Mr. Cool () (2001)
:Goodbye Mr. Cool is the successor of the Young and Dangerous film series. Ekin Cheng and Karen Mok are starred in the film as &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Underworld&quot;. The plot follows a retired triad leader (Cheng) whose life of crime has been traded for a waiter&#x27;s apron at the Kowloon Cafe. Queen of the Underworld (Mok) seduces Dragon back to the crime business. Though Dragon is reluctant to go back, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before he plays a key role in a bloody gang war.

===Daniel Chan Yee-Heng===
* Young and Dangerous: Reloaded (古惑仔之江湖新秩序) (2013)
:This film is a reboot to the series. On a dark Mong Kok night, May, the cousin of Dai Tin-Yee (Dominic Ho), is gang raped and murdered by Med King (Deep Ng) and his men. The furious Tin-Yee, together with his buddies, Chan Ho Nam (Him Law), Chicken (Oscar Leung), Pou-Pan (Jazz Lam) tracked down Med King to revenge May&#x27;s death. As Med King was under the wing of Ugly Kwan (Sammy Sum), a leader of the Hung Hing triad, Kwan gave orders to get rid of Ho-Nam by all means...

<doc id="971581" wikidata="Q1817164" url="?curid=971581" title="Westland Wyvern">
<text>The Westland Wyvern is a British single-seat carrier-based multi-role strike aircraft built by Westland Aircraft that served in the 1950s, seeing service in the 1956 Suez Crisis. Production Wyverns were powered by a turboprop engine driving large and distinctive contra-rotating propellers, and could carry aerial torpedoes.

==Design and development==

The Wyvern began as a Westland project for a naval strike fighter, with the engine located behind the pilot, driving a propeller in the nose via a long shaft that passed under the cockpit floor, similar to the Bell P-39. This enabled the pilot to be located in a position that conferred the best possible visibility over the nose for carrier operations. Official interest resulted in Air Ministry Specification N.11/44 for a long-range naval fighter using the 24-cylinder H-block Rolls-Royce Eagle 22 piston engine (unrelated to the First World War-era engine of the same name) being issued to cover Westland&#x27;s design. The specification also called for an airframe design that would be able to take a turboprop engine when a suitable unit was available. There was a parallel specification for the Royal Air Force, F.13/44, for which Hawker submitted the competing P.1027, a development of the Tempest. The RAF variant was cancelled, when in 1945 it was decided that all future fighter aircraft would be jet-powered.

The original design soon matured into the more conventional Westland W.34, with the 3,500 hp (2,610 kW) Eagle engine in the nose driving large contra-rotating propellers and the pilot sitting high in a humped fuselage to improve visibility. The design was otherwise orthodox, with a low wing, tailwheel undercarriage and double-folding wings fitted with both Youngman flaps on the inner wing section and conventional flaps on the outer section. The W.34 was to be armed with four Hispano 20 mm cannon in the wings and have the ability to carry a torpedo under the fuselage or a selection of bombs and rockets under the wings.

The prototype W.34; the Wyvern TF.1, first flew at Boscombe Down on 16 December 1946 with Westland&#x27;s test pilot Harald Penrose at the controls. This aircraft was lost on 15 October 1947 when the propeller bearings failed in flight. Westland&#x27;s assistant test pilot Sqn. Ldr. Peter Garner was killed attempting to make an emergency landing. From prototype number three onwards, the aircraft were navalised and carried their intended armament.

At around this time, the Eagle engine was cancelled and it was found that there were insufficient pre-production engines available to complete all the prototype and pre-production aircraft. Specification N.12/45 was therefore issued for the Wyvern TF.2, to be powered by a turboprop engine: either the Rolls-Royce Clyde or the Armstrong Siddeley Python. A single Clyde-powered prototype was ordered along with two with Pythons. A Clyde-powered TF.2 first flew on 18 January 1949. Both the piston-powered and turboprop versions shared many common components including wing and tail units, and essentially the same basic cockpit structure. The flight was cut short to only three minutes when shortly after takeoff, the cockpit filled with smoke from a fuel leak onto the exhaust ducting. Clyde development was subsequently cancelled by Rolls-Royce after only 50 hours of flight time for the TF.2, and the aircraft was delivered to Napier &amp; Son to be fitted with the Nomad turbo-compound engine. The latter engine never materialised, however and this aircraft was used for crash barrier trials.

The first Python-powered TF.2 flew on 22 March 1949 and this aircraft introduced the ejection seat to the Wyvern. Twenty TF.2s were completed to the Python design although after three years of testing what was then a revolutionary aircraft design, a myriad of detailed aerodynamic changes resulted. The Python engine responded poorly to minor throttle adjustments, so control was exercised by running the engine at a constant speed and varying the pitch of the propellers. The aircraft was declared ready for service in 1952, but never reached an operational squadron.

The definitive Wyvern model was the TF.4, later S.4. Initially, 50 S.4s were ordered and were joined by the last 7 TF.2s, which were altered while still under construction. S.4s reached limited shore-based front line service in May 1953 with 813 Naval Air Squadron at RNAS Ford, replacing the somewhat similar (and equally troubled) Blackburn Firebrand. Several second-line squadrons also received Wyverns around this time.

Total production was 127 airframes with 124 aircraft completed, as the last three Eagle piston-engined airframes, VR138, -139, and -140, were never completed.

==Operational history==
The first carrier trials were carried out by the first pre-production Wyvern TF.2 aboard on 21 June 1950. Despite this, when the Wyvern S.4 entered service with 813 Naval Air Squadron in May 1953, it had not obtained clearance for carrier operations, this being obtained only in April 1954. The Wyvern was in service with the Fleet Air Arm from 1954 to 1958. Wyverns equipped 813 Squadron, 827 Squadron, 830 Squadron and 831 Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm.

In September 1954, 813 embarked with their Wyverns on HMS &quot;Albion&quot; for carrier-based service in the Mediterranean. The Wyvern soon showed a worrying habit for flameout on catapult launch: the high G forces involved caused fuel starvation. A number of aircraft were lost off &quot;Albion″s&quot; bow and Lt. B. D. Macfarlane made history on 13 October 1954 when he successfully ejected under water using his Martin-Baker Mk.1 ejection seat after his aircraft had ditched on launch and been cut in two by the carrier. 813 did not return to &quot;Albion&quot; until March 1955 when the problems had been resolved.
830 Sqn. took the Wyvern into combat from HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;, flying 79 sorties during Operation Musketeer, the armed response to the Suez Crisis. Two Wyverns were lost to damage from Egyptian light anti-aircraft fire; the pilots of both aircraft successfully ejected over the sea and were picked up by &quot;Eagle&quot;&#x27;s search and rescue helicopter. The squadron returned to the UK on &quot;Eagle&quot; after this conflict and disbanded in January 1957. Consequently, 813 was the last Wyvern squadron, disbanding on 22 April 1958.
All Wyverns were withdrawn from service by 1958: while in service and testing there were 68 accidents, 39 were lost and there were 13 fatalities, including two RAF pilots and one United States Navy pilot.

==Variants==
*W.34 Wyvern
::Six prototypes ordered in August 1944, with the first aircraft flown 12 December 1946. Powered by the Rolls-Royce Eagle Mk 22 H-block, piston engine.

*W.34 Wyvern TF.1
::Pre-production aircraft ordered in June 1946, with only seven built of 20 contracted due to the cancellation of the Eagle powerplant.

*W.35 Wyvern TF.2
::The original production version, powered by the Armstrong Siddeley Python turboprop in replacement of the discontinued Eagle piston powerplant seen on the W.34 prototypes. Three prototypes were ordered in February 1946 with a production contract for 20 aircraft issued in September 1947. Only nine production aircraft were built, and the remaining eleven were completed as S.4s.

*W.38 Wyvern T.3
::Two-seat conversion trainer. One prototype serialed VZ739 was ordered in September 1948 and first flown in February 1950.

*W.35 Wyvern TF.4
::The definitive version. 50 were ordered in October 1948, 13 in December 1950, 13 in January 1951 and a final 11 in February 1951. A total of 98 built (including 11 that had started as TF.2s). The model was later redesignated as the S.4.

==Survivors==
An unflown pre-production aircraft, the last to be fitted with the original Eagle piston engine, (serial number &quot;VR137&quot;) is on display at the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovilton, England.

<text>In organochlorine chemistry, reductive dechlorination describes any chemical reaction which cleaves the covalent bond between carbon and chlorine via reductants, to release chloride ions. Many modalities have been implemented, depending on the application. Reductive dechlorination is often applied to remediation of chlorinated pesticides or dry cleaning solvents. It is also used occasionally in the synthesis of organic compounds, e.g. as pharmaceuticals.

==Chemical==
Dechlorination is a well-researched reaction in organic synthesis, although it is not often used. Usually stoichiometric amounts of dechlorinating agent are required. In one classic application, the Ullmann reaction, chloroarenes are coupled to biphenyl]]s. For example, the activated substrate 2-chloronitrobenzene is converted into 2,2&#x27;-dinitrobiphenyl with a copper - bronze alloy.
Zerovalent iron effects similar reactions. Organophosphorus(III) compounds effect gentle dechlorinations. The products are alkenes and phosphorus(V). 
*Alkaline earth metals and zinc are used for more difficult dechlorinations. The side product is zinc chloride.

== Biological ==
Vicinal reduction involves the removal of two halogen atoms that are adjacent on the same alkane or alkene, leading to the formation of an additional carbon-carbon bond.

Biological reductive dechlorination is often effected by certain species of bacteria. Sometimes the bacterial species are highly specialized for organochlorine respiration and even a particular electron donor, as in the case of &quot;Dehalococcoides&quot; and &quot;Dehalobacter&quot;. In other examples, such as &quot;Anaeromyxobacter&quot;, bacteria have been isolated that are capable of using a variety of electron donors and acceptors, with a subset of possible electron acceptors being organochlorines. These reactions depend on a molecule which tends to be very aggressively sought after by some microbes, vitamin B12.

===Bioremediation using reductive dechlorination===

Reductive dechlorination of chlorinated organic molecules is relevant to bioremediation of polluted groundwater. One example is the organochloride respiration of the dry-cleaning solvent, tetrachloroethylene, and the engine degreasing solvent trichloroethylene by anaerobic bacteria, often members of the candidate genera &quot;Dehalococcoides&quot;. Bioremediation of these chloroethenes can occur when other microorganisms at the contaminated site provide H2 as a natural byproduct of various fermentation reactions. The dechlorinating bacteria use this H2 as their electron donor, ultimately replacing chlorine atoms in the chloroethenes with hydrogen atoms via hydrogenolytic reductive dechlorination. This process can proceed in the soil provided the availability of organic electron donors and the appropriate strains of &quot;Dehalococcoides&quot;. Trichloroethylene is dechlorinated via dichloroethene and vinyl chloride to ethylene.

A chloroform-degrading reductive dehalogenase enzyme has been reported in a &quot;Dehalobacter&quot; member. The chloroform reductive dehalogenase, termed TmrA, was found to be transcriptional up-regulated in response to chloroform respiration and the enzyme can be obtained both in native and recombinant forms.

Reductive dechlorination has been investigated for bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFC). The reductive dechlorination of PCBs is performed by anaerobic microorganisms that utilize the PCB as an electron sink. The result of this is the reduction of the &quot;meta&quot; site, followed by the &quot;para&quot; site, and finally the &quot;ortho&quot; site, leading to a dechlorinated product. In the Hudson River, microorganisms effect dechlorination over the course of weeks. The resulting monochlorobiphenyls and dichlorobiphenyls are less toxic and more easily degradable by aerobic organisms compared to their chlorinated counterparts. The prominent drawback that has prevented the widespread use of reductive dechlorination for PCB detoxification and has decreased its feasibility is the issue of the slower than desired dechlorination rates. It has been suggested that bioaugmentation with DF-1 can lead to enhanced reductive dechlorination rates of PCBs through stimulation of dechlorination. Additionally, high inorganic carbon levels do not affect dechlorination rates in low PCB concentration environments.

The reductive dechlorination applies to CFCs. Reductive dechlorination of CFCs including CFC-11, CFC-113, chlorotrifluoroethene, CFC-12, HCFC-141b, and tetrachloroethene occur through hydrogenolysis. Reduction rates of CFC mirror theoretical rates calculated based on the Marcus theory of electron transfer rate.

==Electrochemical==

The electrochemical reduction of chlorinated chemicals such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons can be carried out by electrolysis in appropriate solvents, such as mixtures of water and alcohol. Some of the key components of an electrolytic cell are types of electrodes, electrolyte mediums, and use of mediators. The cathode transfers electrons to the molecule, which decomposes to produce the corresponding hydrocarbon (hydrogen atoms substitute the original chlorine atoms) and free chloride ions. For instance, the reductive dechlorination of CFCs is complete and produces several hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) plus chloride.

Hydrodechlorination (HDC) is a type of reductive dechlorination that is useful due to its high reaction rate. It uses H2 as the reducing agent over a range of potential electrode reactors and catalysts. Amongst the types of catalysts studied such as precious metals (platinum, palladium, rhodium), transition metals (niobium and molybdenum), and metal oxides, a preference for precious metals overrides the others. As an example, palladium often adopts a lattice formation which can easily embed hydrogen gas making it more accessible to be readily oxidized. However a common issue for HDC is catalyst deactivation and regeneration. As catalysts are depleted, chlorine poisoning on surfaces can sometimes be observed, and on rare occasions, metal sintering and leaching occurs as a result.

Electrochemical reduction can be performed at ambient pressure and temperature. This will not disrupt microbial environments or raise extra cost for remediation. The process of dechlorination can be highly controlled to avoid toxic chlorinated intermediates and byproducts such as dioxins from incineration. Trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene are common targets of treatment which are directly converted to environmentally benign products. Chlorinated alkenes and alkanes are converted to hydrogen chloride which is then neutralized with a base. However, even though there are many potential benefits to adopting this method, research have mainly been conducted in a laboratory setting with a few cases of field studies making it not yet well established.

<text>In toss juggling, columns, also known as One-up Two-up, is a juggling trick or pattern where the balls are thrown upwards without any sideways motion, distinguishing it from the fountain. The simplest version involves having three balls, with two going up simultaneously on either side, followed by one going up in the middle. One way to accomplish this is to juggle 2 balls in one hand and one ball in the other, so one hand has to move faster and further than in a regular pattern (cascade), whilst the other remains almost stationary. The hand juggling the center ball can alternate with each repeat to make the pattern symmetric.

==Variations==
The two-in-one is a variant using two balls in one hand (the hand with the &quot;lone&quot; ball is unused), &quot;where the balls travel vertically in their own separate paths...Columns is really just a Two-in-One in one hand with a third ball thrown synchronously from the other hand.&quot;

There are many variations to the simple three-ball pattern. Some involve alternating the placement of the &#x27;lone&#x27; inside throw, while others involve the two outside throws.

The &#x27;lone&#x27; ball may be to either side of the two balls, and can have its position in relation to them altered whilst juggling the pattern by throwing it not at a vertical angle, or moving the hand holding it when it has been caught. This ball can also be thrown quickly from one hand to the other as in a box pattern, whilst the other two balls are in midair.

The two balls being thrown and caught simultaneously may also be moved, for example crossing them over in the air, so that they do not land in the hand which threw them. The hands holding these balls may also cross or uncross at any time during the pattern.

Another common variation is to carry one of the two outside throws up and down rather than throwing it, which may be called the Dummy pattern, or &quot;fake columns&quot; (siteswap: (4,2)), which may be interpreted as adding a carry to the &quot;lone&quot; hand during the two-in-one. &quot;Juggle two balls in one hand, but instead of throwing and catching the third ball with the other hand, you simply hold it in that hand, moving the ball up and down.&quot; The carried ball can then be moved in many different ways to complement the pattern. In a variation called Yo-yo (siteswap: (4,2)), or The String, the ball is carried up and down directly above one of the other balls to give the impression that the balls are connected by an invisible string, like a yo-yo.

The trick can be extended to any number of balls and can be varied by doing synchronous [siteswap: (4,4)(4,0)] or asynchronous throws (siteswap: 3). The props used may also be altered.

==Siteswap==

The synchronous siteswap of the basic version of the trick is (4,4)(4,0). What the notation fails to capture is that 4s are always thrown in straight lines, which can be considered an essential property of the trick, given the name (props thrown in an oval would be a fountain pattern).

<text>Jacopo Aconcio () was an Italian jurist, theologian, philosopher and engineer. He is now known for his contribution to the history of religious toleration.

==Life==
Aconcio was born around 1520 in Trento, Italy, or possibly the nearby town of Ossana. He was the son of Gerolamo Aconcio and his wife, Oliana. He studied law and later became a notary in 1548 when he was admitted to the Collegio dei Notai of Trento. In 1549 he entered the service of Count Francesco Landriano, a courtier serving the emperor, Charles V in Vienna. Aconcio remained with Landriano for seven years and then around 1556 became secretary to Cardinal Madruzzo, the imperial governor in Milan.

Aconcio later wrote that he became attracted to the ideas of the Reformation while in service to Landriano. He knew that it was dangerous to express these beliefs openly while living in Italy and decided to pursue a career in military engineering that would allow him to live safely in exile. He taught himself the basics of engineering through conversations with military men like Landriano and Giovanni Maria Olgiati. He also took careful note of fortifications he had the opportunity to visit while travelling through Europe.

When conservative Paul IV became pope in 1555, he instituted a rigorous campaign to suppress heresy in the Italian States. Aconcio felt threatened and in June 1557 he renounced his Catholic faith and fled first to Basel and then on to Zürich. In Basel he met Bernardino Ochino and other radical Italian reformers. In Switzerland he wrote his first works, &quot;Dialogue di Silvio e Mutio&quot;, outlining the Lutheran criticisms of the Catholic church and &quot;Summa de Christiana religione&quot;, which presents a view of religion purged of the controversial points that divided Christendom. Both were published in 1558. At the same time he published a secular work, &quot;De Methodo, hoc est, de recte investigandarum tradendarumque Scientiarum ratione&quot;, which lays out an approach to intellectual inquiry that emphasizes a rational, almost mathematical approach, proceeding from clear and concrete first principles.

While in Switzerland, Aconcio became acquainted with some of the Marian exiles, English Protestants who had fled persecution under the reign of Queen Mary. In 1558 Aconcio moved to Strasbourg and then contemplated a move to England where he hoped for favourable treatment of Protestants under the new ruler, Queen Elizabeth. In addition, Sir William Cecil, England&#x27;s secretary of state, was recruiting Italian engineering expertise to improve English fortifications and in September 1559 Aconcio was brought to England by the new government.

In December 1559 he petitioned the queen for grants of patent on a variety of machines powered by water wheels. This was the first patent request in England but it was not granted to Aconcio until 1565. In 1560 he was granted an annual royal pension of 60 pounds and in 1561 he became an English subject. In 1563 Aconcio proposed a plan to drain two thousand acres of marshland along the south bank of the Thames between Erith and Plumstead. The effort was initially successful, but bad weather flooded what he had managed to reclaim, and Aconcio was obliged to hand over control of the project to his partner, Giovanni Battista Castiglione, and other investors. It was not until 1564 that he was hired as a military engineer to participate in a joint review of the fortifications being developed at Berwick Castle, one of the most important strongholds along the Scottish-English border. The work being done by engineer Richard Lee had been criticized by the government&#x27;s chief Italian expert, Giovanni Portinari, and Aconcio was sent to Berwick to provide another perspective. He made his own design suggestions, some of which were implemented.

On his arrival in London, he joined the Dutch Reformed Church in Austin Friars, but he was &quot;infected with Anabaptistical and Arian opinions&quot; and was excluded from the sacrament by Edmund Grindal, bishop of London.

==Works==
Before reaching England he had published a treatise on the methods of investigation, &quot;De Methodo, hoc est, de recte investigandarum tradendarumque Scientiarum ratione&quot; (Basel, 1558, 8vo); and his critical spirit placed him outside all the recognized religious societies of his time. His heterodoxy is revealed in his &quot;Stratagematum Satanae libri octo&quot;, sometimes abbreviated as &quot;Stratagemata Satanae&quot;, published in 1565 and translated into various languages. The &quot;Stratagems of Satan&quot; are the dogmatic creeds which rent the Christian church. Aconcio sought to find the common denominator of the various creeds; this was essential doctrine, and the rest was immaterial. To arrive at this common basis, he had to reduce dogma to a low level, and his result was generally repudiated. &quot;Stratagemata Satanae&quot; was not translated into English until 1647, but afterwards, it became very influential among English liberal theologians.

John Selden applied to Aconcio the remark &quot;ubi bene, nil melius; ubi male, nemo pejus&quot; (&quot;Where good, none better. Where bad, none worse&quot;). The dedication of such a work to Queen Elizabeth illustrates the tolerance or religious laxity during the early years of her reign. Aconcio later found another patron in Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and died about 1566.

<doc id="971609" wikidata="Q7574677" url="?curid=971609" title="Special Patrol Group">
<text>The Special Patrol Group (SPG) was a unit of Greater London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Service, responsible for providing a centrally based mobile capacity to combat serious public disorder, crime, and terrorism, that could not be dealt with by local divisions.

The SPG was active from 1961 to 12 January 1987. It was replaced by the Territorial Support Group (TSG), three times the size of the SPG.

==History==
The SPG recruited experienced police officers capable of working as striper teams, either in uniform or in plain clothes preventing public disorder, targeting areas of serious crime, carrying out stop and searches, and providing a response to terrorist threats. It also conducted its own surveillance and was tasked with reducing burglaries. It had a dedicated radio channel and a fleet of vans to allow it to work independently of routine divisions.

The SPG originally consisted of four units based throughout London. This was increased to six and finally to eight. Each unit comprised an inspector, three sergeants, and thirty constables.

Its position within the Metropolitan Police was unusual: whereas the Flying Squad became the symbol of the Criminal Investigation Department in London, the SPG became recognised as a unit that efficient uniformed officers could aspire to join. As such it had an exceptionally high level of &quot;esprit de corps&quot;.

Other police forces outside London created their own versions of the Special Patrol Group. Greater Manchester Police created the Tactical Aid Group (TAG) in 1977. Merseyside Police formed the Task Force in 1974, which was disbanded in 1978 and replaced with the Operational Support Division (OSD). There was also a Special Patrol Group in Northern Ireland.

==Controversy==
One of the SPG&#x27;s most controversial incidents came in 1979, while officers were policing a protest by the Anti-Nazi League in Southall. During a running battle, demonstrator Blair Peach was struck on the head, which caused his death; at the time it was alleged to have been an action of the SPG. In the inquiries that followed, unauthorised weapons were found in lockers kept as souvenirs by SPG officers at one of their bases after the weapons were seized; these included knives, crowbars, and sledgehammers.

No SPG officer was ever charged with the attack. An internal report was leaked, which stated that the Metropolitan Police settled with Peach&#x27;s family out of court. The original Metropolitan police report, eventually officially published on 27 April 2010, concluded that the fatal blow that killed the anti-racism activist was probably made by a police officer. It is thought that &quot;Peach&#x27;s skull was crushed with an unauthorised weapon, such as a lead-weighted cosh or police radio&quot; The internal report also concluded that some officers had conspired to cover up the circumstances of the special-needs teacher&#x27;s death and strongly recommended that proceedings be taken against three officers for attempting or conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

==In popular culture==
Nick Lowe referred to the Special Patrol Group in the song &quot;Half a Boy and Half a Man&quot;, on his album &quot;Nick Lowe and His Cowboy Outfit&quot; (1984).

In the BBC sitcom &quot;The Young Ones&quot; (1982–84), the character Vyvyan Basterd&#x27;s pet hamster was named &quot;Special Patrol Group&quot;.

The second book of &quot;The Borrible Trilogy&quot; novels, &quot;The Borribles Go For Broke&quot; by Michael de Larrabeiti, features a parody of the SPG in the form of the &quot;Special Borribles Group&quot;, or SBG, led by the book&#x27;s villain, the fictional Inspector Sussworth.

British Oi! bands The Exploited and Red Alert both have songs named &quot;S.P.G.&quot;, on the albums &quot;Punks Not Dead&quot; (1981) and &quot;We&#x27;ve Got The Power&quot; (1983), respectively.

The Linton Kwesi Johnson song &quot;Reggae fi Peach&quot;, on the album &quot;Bass Culture&quot; (1980), includes the refrain: &quot;The SPG them are murderers (murderers) / We can&#x27;t make them get no furtherer&quot;.

In the &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; Racist Police sketch, Constable Savage is transferred to the SPG.

The song &quot;Little Boys in Blue&quot; by the punk band The Professionals includes the lyric &quot;Special Patrol, License to kill&quot;.

By amateur standards, a small telescope can have a primary mirror/aperture less than in diameter. Little if any professional-level research is performed with refracting telescopes in the modern era of astronomy.

Small telescopes dominate astronomical research in the fields of asteroid/comet discovery/observation, variable star photometry, supernova/nova discovery, and colorimetry/polarimetry of the Solar System&#x27;s planets.

Because of their limited light-gathering capability, small telescopes are usually not well-suited to spectroscopy, although some useful spectroscopic work can be performed with reflecting telescopes with a primary mirror as small as when equipped with the increasingly sophisticated CCD imaging and spectroscopic instrumentation that has become available to amateur astronomers in the 21st century.

Most telescopes within the field of amateur astronomy are considered to be small, ranging in general from achromatic refracting types, to reflecting telescopes featuring primary mirrors up to or more in diameter. Most small telescopes are dedicated to visual observation, although many are used for astrophotography or to gather scientific data.

The range of amateur astronomers&#x27; telescopes is wide, with numerous types and designs. Refracting designs include achromatic and apochromatic types. Some reflecting types are Newtonian, Schmidt–Cassegrain, Maksutov-Cassegrain, and Maksutov-Newtonian. Even sophisticated designs, such as the Ritchey–Chrétien and (corrected) Dall–Kirkham, which have traditionally been the preserve of large professional-grade instruments, have become available to amateurs.

<text>State of Alert (often abbreviated to S.O.A.) was an American hardcore punk group formed in Washington, D.C., in October 1980, and active until July 1981. S.O.A. was fronted by Henry Rollins, then using his original surname Garfield.

==History==
S.O.A. was formed in October 1980, after the members of a previous group, the Extorts, lost their vocalist Lyle Preslar and hired Rollins, then known by his birth name Henry Garfield. The original lineup consisted of Rollins (vocals), Michael Hampton (guitar), Wendel Blow (bass) and Simon Jacobsen (drums).

During December 1980 and January 1981, the group recorded the 10-song 7-inch EP &quot;No Policy&quot; at Inner Ear Studios in Arlington, Virginia, produced by Skip Groff and engineered by Inner Ear owner Don Zientara. It was released on Dischord Records in March 1981, as the label&#x27;s second release. &quot;No Policy&quot; was financed by Rollins, as Dischord was tied up in releasing Minor Threat&#x27;s debut EP.

Circa April 1981, drummer Jacobsen was replaced by Ivor Hanson. At the time, Hanson&#x27;s father was a top admiral in the US Navy and his family shared living quarters with the vice president in the Naval Observatory. The band held their practices there and had to be let in by Secret Service agents.

S.O.A. played a total of nine concerts in and around the eastern United States. Among them:
* 1980-12-06 - Washington, D.C. (the first show)
* 1980-12-13 - 1929 Calvert St., Washington, D.C.
* 1980-12-17 - Unheard Music Festival, D.C. Space, 7th &amp; Enw., Washington, D.C.
* 1980-12-18 - Unheard Music Festival, D.C. Space, 7th &amp; Enw., Washington, D.C.
* 1981-01-10 - The 9:30 Club, 930 F Street NW, Washington, D.C.
* 1981-04-04 - The Wilson Center, Washington, D.C.
* 1981-07-10 - Philadelphia (the last show)

Rollins later described their performances: &quot;All of them were 11 to 14 minutes in duration because the songs were all like 40 seconds... and the rest of the time we were going, &#x27;Are you ready? Are you ready?&#x27; Those gigs were poorly played songs in between &#x27;Are you readys?&quot;

Three S.O.A. songs (&quot;I Hate the Kids&quot;, UK Subs cover &quot;Disease&quot; and Boyce and Hart cover &quot;Stepping Stone Party&quot;) were posthumously included on the influential Dischord compilation &quot;Flex Your Head&quot;, issued in January 1982.

&quot;No Policy&quot; was later included, in its entirety, on the Dischord compilations &quot;Four Old 7-inchs on a 12-inch&quot; (1984) and &quot;Dischord 1981: The Year in Seven Inches&quot; (1995). In 2014, Dischord issued a 7-inch EP of early demos, titled &quot;First Demo 12/29/80&quot;.

==Legacy and other projects==
Today, S.O.A. is remembered primarily as Rollins&#x27; first band – before he joined Black Flag and then founded Rollins Band – but also as an example of early &quot;DC hardcore&quot; and an influence on other bands such as Detroit&#x27;s Negative Approach and New York City&#x27;s Agnostic Front.

Hampton and Hanson went on to form the Faith in 1981 with Alec MacKaye (brother of Ian MacKaye), and then Embrace with Ian MacKaye in 1985. In 1986, Hampton joined One Last Wish with Guy Picciotto (Fugazi, Rites of Spring) and Brendan Canty (Deadline, Fugazi, Rites of Spring)., and also played in the Snakes. Moving to indie rock, Hampton joined forces again with Hanson to form Manifesto in 1988, and later played with members of Ivy in Paco.

Blow went on to play in Iron Cross and Lethal Intent.

<text>Melchior Acontius (1515, Oberursel (Taunus) – 22 June 1569) was a German poet.

He was born in Oberursel (Taunus) near Frankfurt am Main and lived in Wittenberg during the first half of the 16th century. He was a close friend of fellow poet Georg Sabinus and wrote epithalamies on the marriage of the latter with the daughter of Philipp Melanchthon. Sabinus included these dedications among his own creations. Acontius was also friends with another contemporary poet, Jacob Micyllus.

<text>The Colt Automatic Rifle-15 or CAR-15 is a family of M16 rifle–based firearms marketed by Colt in the 1960s and early 1970s. However, the term &quot;CAR-15&quot; is most commonly associated with the Colt Commando (AKA: XM177); these select-fire carbines have ultrashort and barrels with over-sized flash suppressors.

==Etymology==
The CAR-15 name was an attempt to re-associate the AR-15 name with Colt, since the AR initially stood for &quot;Armalite Rifle&quot; the original manufacturer of the Armalite AR-15. Colt later abandoned the CAR-15 concept, but continued to make carbine variations, using the &quot;M16&quot; brand for select-fire models and the &quot;Colt AR-15&quot; brand for semi-automatic models. However, in present usage, &quot;CAR-15&quot; is the generic name for all carbine-length variants made before the M4 carbine.

==History==


After Colt&#x27;s Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company purchase of the rights and intellectual property to the AR-10 and AR-15 rifles from Armalite in late 1959, Colt&#x27;s embarked on a research and development program to create variations of the AR platform that evolved into the CAR-15 family of firearms. The focus of the CAR-15 R&amp;D was to develop five different variants of the existing AR-15 in addition to a 40mm grenade launcher. The five firearms developed were a submachine gun (SMG), a carbine, a heavy barrel magazine fed squad automatic ( SAW), a belt fed machine gun, and a compact survival rifle. Only the SMG generated any interest with the U.S. Army and &quot;Aside from limited purchases of 100-150 M-1 heavy assault rifles for trials during the upcoming SAWS program, the military was cool to most of Colt&#x27;s CAR-15 Military Weapons System, and only a handful of carbines, M-2 belt-fed assault rifles and survival rifles were ever produced. However, the short-barreled submachine gun and the 40mm grenade launcher attachment did undergo considerable further development.&quot;

The CAR-15 program started in earnest in 1964 with samples of the SMG &quot;Model 607&quot; being submitted to the U.S. Army for evaluation. Starting in May, 1965, Colt attempted to market the M16 rifle and its variants developed under the CAR-15 program to commercial markets and markets outside the United States as a modular weapon system. By using various upper assemblies, buttstocks, and pistol grips, the weapon could be configured as an assault rifle, a carbine, a submachine gun, an open-bolt squad automatic weapon, a belt-fed light machine gun, or a survival rifle. There was a second belt-fed machine gun developed under the CAR-15 program called the CMG-1, CMG-2, and CMG-3 in 7.62 NATO that was not based on the existing AR-15/M16 design. However, the U.S. military only made significant purchases of the existing M16 rifle and the SMG model, later called the Commando versions, so Colt abandoned the CAR-15 family concept. The &quot;CAR-15 Rifle&quot; was already identified by most users as the M16 rifle, and &quot;CAR-15&quot; was similarly associated with the short-barreled Colt Submachine Gun and Commando models. Because of that, the term &quot;CAR-15&quot; has been used to describe any M16-based carbine, even if the particular weapon is not officially named this.

==Colt Automatic Rifle-15 family==

===CAR-15 Rifle (M16 rifle)===

Beginning in 1961 under ARPA&#x27;s Project Agile, Colt provided approximately 1,000 AR-15s for evaluation to the U.S. Government in southeast Asia. Colt was eventually awarded their first contract to supply the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force with the M16 in November, 1963. The &quot;Model 603&quot; CAR-15 Rifle, adopted initially by the United States Army as the XM16E1 and then later as the M16A1, and the &quot;Model 604&quot; CAR-15 Rifle, adopted by the United States Air Force as the M16, formed the core of the CAR-15 family. However, the United States military had already committed to purchases before Colt created the concept of the CAR-15 weapons system. The principal difference between the &quot;Model 603&quot; and &quot;Model 604&quot; is that the former has a forward assist, allowing a user to manually close a stuck bolt.

===CAR-15 Heavy Assault Rifle M1 (Model 606)===
The CAR-15 Heavy Assault Rifle M1 was a heavy-barreled version of the standard CAR-15 with a bipod attachment, intended for use as a Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW). It was designed to feed from the same detachable box magazine used for the M16. Approximately 100-150 were produced by Colt for evaluation by the U.S. Army during the SAWS program in 1965. Colt continued attempts to market the HBAR M16A1 as the &quot;Model 621&quot; through the late 1970s without success and only a few dozen were manufactured. Colt&#x27;s did eventually produce a heavy barrel civilian market semi-automatic AR-15 beginning in the late 1980s based on the M16A2 called the AR-15 HBAR that was a commercial success.

===CAR-15 Heavy Assault Rifle M2===
The CAR-15 Heavy Assault Rifle M2 was a belt-fed conversion of the standard CAR-15, with a heavy barrel and bipod attachment. It was made in prototype form only and saw no sales. The &quot;CAR-15 Heavy Assault Rifle M2&quot; was not related to the CMG-1, CMG-2, or CMG-3 belt fed machine guns.

===CAR-15 Carbine (Model 605)===
The &quot;Model 605&quot; CAR-15 Carbine was a shortened version of the of Colt&#x27;s M16E1/M16A1 for situations where longer weapons could be unwieldy, such as inside armored vehicles, ships/boats, or helicopters. There were only a very small number of known prototypes of the carbine made sometime after the 1963 award of the first contract to Colt&#x27;s for the delivery of the M16 and M16E1. The first prototype was essentially an M16E1/M16A1 rifle with 5 inches of the barrel removed resulting is a barrel in length, so that it ended just forward of the front sight base. Because of the shorter barrel and no space to attach a bayonet, the bayonet mounting lugs removed. Due to the shortened barrel with the gas port intersecting the barrel bore near the muzzle, the gas port diameter was opened up to match the internal diameter of the gas tube at 0.110 inches.

A second prototype used a custom profile barrel with the gas port and front sight base/gas block moved back approximately 2.5 inches to improve reliability. A standard M16 handguard had 2.5 inches cut off the back to fit the shortened barrel/gas system, and a custom adapter fabricated to retain the modified handguard in the existing retainer ring surrounding the barrel nut. As an added benefit from the relocated front sight/gas block a bayonet was able to be fitted. This gas system is arguably the first use of what is called today as a &quot;mid-length&quot; gas system since it falls between the 12 in gas system of the rifle and the 7 inch gas system used in the SMG variants.

Because of the issues with reliable cycling caused by the shortened barrel, Colt&#x27;s experimented with buffers and low mass bolt carriers during the development of the carbine and SMG versions of the CAR-15. The only two known versions of the &quot;Model 605&quot; prototypes used a modified lower receiver assembly that appears to use an early M16 &quot;Model 603&quot; type forging without the &quot;fence&quot; surrounding the magazine release button. The modified lower receiver incorporated a four-position selector switch (developed by Foster Sturtevant in December 1966) so that a user could select safe, semi-automatic, three-round burst, or full automatic modes of fire. Unlike the standard three-position group, the four-position group went from (going clockwise from the 9 o&#x27;clock position) safe, fully automatic, semi-automatic and finally burst. The selector itself had 360 degrees of motion, and could be moved either clockwise or counterclockwise, unlike with standard groups. Instead of three-round burst, the burst cam could be modified to two-round or six-round burst.

The &quot;Model 605&quot; prototypes used what appeared to be an M16E1/M16A1 upper receiver forging but with the forward assist deleted and the hump mostly machined off. Both prototypes used the standard rifle-length buttstock.

Despite the failure of Colt&#x27;s CAR-15 program to produce a successful carbine variant, in the mid 1990&#x27;s Bushmaster manufactured a similar firearm based on the semi-automatic civilian market M16A2. The Bushmaster XM-15 Dissipatior used a 16 inch barrel (for NFA compliance) and standard rifle length handguard and front sight location, but differed significantly in that it used a M4 length gas system with a gas block separate from the front sight block hidden under the handguard. In the early 2020&#x27;s, Brownells manufactured their BRN-605, a &quot;retro-rifle&quot; clone of the first prototype CAR-15 carbine but used a 16 inch barrel instead of 15 inch (for NFA compliance), but the Brownells clone used the same rifle length gas system as the first &quot;Model 605&quot; prototype.

=== CAR-15 Submachine Gun (Model 607) ===
As early as 1964, United States Navy SEALs were testing prototypes of what would become the &quot;Model 607&quot; SMG. Colt&#x27;s manufactured approximately 50 of these for evaluation. Most were issued to Navy SEALs and Army Special Forces, though some were also given to Army K-9 units.

In 1965, Colt introduced the &quot;Model 607&quot; Submachine Gun. This was the first AR-15 made with a retractable buttstock and was as a product of the development of Colt&#x27;s SMG prototypes. With its overall length being only with the buttstock collapsed. The retractable buttstock resembled a shortened version of the fixed buttstock, but a two-position latch recessed in the back allowed it to be extended and locked into position, increasing the length of pull by . The barrel is too short to mount a bayonet, so the SMG had no bayonet lug. It was a compact weapon for use by special forces and vehicle crewmen. The of submachine gun is an automatic firearm that fires pistol-caliber cartridges. However, manufacturers such as Colt, Heckler &amp; Koch, and Zastava Arms have referred to compact carbines as submachine guns, to emphasize their short length and to differentiate them from longer carbines.

The &quot;Model 607&quot; never went into production, however the limited success during the prototype development resulted in further interest by the U.S. Army and U.S Air Force. The first models were made with M16 receivers without forward assists and with shortened pistol grips from the Survival Rifle (see below). The later &quot;Model 607A&quot; was made with XM16E1 receiver with forward assist and standard pistol grip. The handguard was made from full-length rifle handguard by cutting it in half and using either the fore or aft pair, after machining the ends to fit the slip ring and handguard cap.

Because of the short barrel, the CAR-15 SMGs suffered from a loud and bright muzzle blast, and a number of muzzle devices were developed to reduce this. The SMGs were initially fitted with the standard M16 rifle&#x27;s &quot;duckbill&quot; or three-prong flash hiders, which did not alleviate the problem. In September 1966, Colt developed a long moderator that lessened the noise and muzzle flash, which also increased the weapon&#x27;s reliability by increasing the amount of back pressure. However, the moderator created its own problems, such as heavy bore fouling and causing tracer bullets to wildly yaw. A long moderator with six slots and an expansion chamber, which further reduced noise and flash, replaced the previous muzzle device and became standard for the SMG and the Commando series, but fouling and tracer problems persisted.

===Colt Commando (XM177 &amp; GAU-5)===
The Colt Commando was an outgrowth of the CAR-15 Military Weapons System, specifically the &quot;Model 607&quot;, as a result of interest by the U.S. Army for a fully developed weapon. It was introduced by Colt&#x27;s in 1966 in response to the US military&#x27;s desire for a shorter M16 and without the &quot;Model 607&quot; SMG&#x27;s inadequacies. Colt engineer Rob Roy designed a simpler two-position telescoping tubular aluminum buttstock to replace the complicated extending triangular version. The fragile and ad hoc triangular handguards were replaced by reinforced round handguards. Each half of the round handguard is identical, simplifying logistics by not requiring a top/bottom or left/right pair. The &quot;Model 609&quot; Commando has a forward assist, while the &quot;Model 610&quot; Commando does not. A &quot;Model 610B&quot; with a four-position selector was available, but not used by the U.S. military. All versions are equipped with the long moderator.

The XM177 uses a unique flash suppressor sometimes called a flash or sound moderator for its barrel. This device is long and was designed primarily as a counterbalance measure as the shorter barrel makes the weapon unwieldy. This device reduces flash signature greatly and sound signature slightly, making the normally louder short barreled carbine sound like a longer barreled M16A1. Although it has no internal baffles and does not completely reduce the sound signature to subsonic levels, because it alters the sound level of the weapon, the US Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives has declared this muzzle device to be a sound suppressor and regulates its civilian purchase in the United States.

The &quot;Model 610&quot; was classified as the &quot;XM177&quot; but adopted by the Air Force as the &quot;GAU-5/A&quot; Submachine Gun (GA denoting an automatic gun and U a complete unit rather than a parts kit: the popular &quot;gun aircraft unit&quot; and &quot;gun automatic unit&quot; explanations are backronyms). The Army purchased 2,815 &quot;Model 609&quot; CAR-15 Commandos on June 28, 1966, which were officially designated Submachine Gun, 5.56 mm, &quot;XM177E1&quot;. As part of the contract, Colt was supposed to supply each XM177E1s with seven 30-round magazines, but Colt was unable to build a reliable 30-round curved magazine that would fit in the M16 magazine well, so most XM177E1s were shipped with 20-round magazines. The exception was 5th Special Forces Group, who received a total of four early 30-round magazines. Colt completed delivery of the purchased XM177E1s in March 1967, but the 30 round magazines did not become available until November 1967.

In 1967, in response to field testing, Colt lengthened the Commando&#x27;s barrel from . The increased length reduced noise and muzzle flash, and allowed fitting of the Colt XM148 grenade launcher. A metal boss was added to the moderator for mounting of the XM148 and rifle grenades. The chambers were chrome-plated. The Commandos with the longer barrels were called the &quot;Model 629&quot; and &quot;Model 649&quot;. The &quot;Model 629&quot; Commando has a forward assist; the &quot;Model 649&quot; Commando does not.

In April 1967, the Army purchased 510 &quot;Model 629&quot; Commandos for use by troops assigned to the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG), and designated them &quot;XM177E2&quot;. Delivery was completed by the end of September 1967. The Air Force adopted a similar model without the forward assist feature as the &quot;GAU-5A/A&quot;. Sources debate whether or not this was a Colt &quot;Model 630&quot; or &quot;Model 649&quot;. According to John Plaster and other sources, the lack of 30-round magazines continued to be problematic and SOG operators resorted to pooling their personal resources and purchasing the larger capacity magazines on the civilian U.S. market. Problems with range, accuracy, barrel fouling, and usage of tracer bullets continued to plague the XM177 series, but Colt estimated that it would take a six-month $400,000 program to do a complete ballistic and kinematic study. There were also recommendations for a 29-month $635,000 research and development program. Both recommendations were declined by the U.S. military as American ground force involvement in the Vietnam War was gradually winding down. Production of the CAR-15 Commando ended in 1970.

===CAR-15 Survival Rifle (Model 608)===
The &quot;Model 608&quot; CAR-15 Survival Rifle was meant for use by downed aircrew. Because of the CAR-15&#x27;s modular design, the Survival Rifle could be broken down into two subassemblies and stowed with four 20-round magazines in a pilot&#x27;s seat pack. Resembling a Colt Commando, it also has a barrel and is in overall length when assembled. The Survival Rifle used a fixed tubular plastic-coated aluminum buttstock and a round handguard that were not used on the other CAR-15 versions, and did not have either a forward assist or a bayonet lug. The pistol grip was chopped down, and the muzzle was equipped with either a conical flash hider or the long moderator. Around 10 of the &quot;Model 608&quot; were known to be manufactured.

==Post-Vietnam==

After the Vietnam War, Colt abandoned the CAR-15 Modular Weapon System concept, but continued to develop short barrel carbines. These were marketed as &quot;M16s&quot;, while the civilian and law-enforcement semi-automatic counterparts were marketed as &quot;Colt AR-15s&quot;, though they were all commonly called CAR-15s.

===M16 Carbine (CAR-15)===
In the early 1970s, Colt began development of an M16 carbine with a long pencil barrel. The barrel length was compatible with the existing carbine-length gas system and allowed for the mounting of a standard M16 bayonet. Despite having a longer barrel, it&#x27;s no longer than the Colt Commando, as the longer barrel did not require the long 4.5 inch moderator of the XM177 series, only the much shorter M16 birdcage-type flash hider. Colt labeled the M16 carbines the &quot;Model 651&quot;, &quot;652&quot;, &quot;653&quot;, or &quot;654&quot;, depending on whether or not it had a fixed or retractable buttstock, or a forward assist. Only the &quot;Model 653&quot; M16A1 carbine, with retractable buttstock and forward assist would be purchased in significant numbers by the U.S. military. The Malaysian Armed Forces and the Armed Forces of the Philippines, purchased Model 653s in small numbers for special operations forces or security forces.

====GUU-5/P====

The GUU-5/P was a result of United States Air Force making ad-hoc upgrades to its GAU-5 series. The barrels and flash suppressor were replaced with the longer barrel with a 1-in-12 twist, but the weapons retained their original designations. With the change to M855 cartridges, they either received 1-in-7 twist barrel or complete upper receiver assembly replacements. The GAU-5s markings were also removed and the weapons were re-stamped &quot;GUU-5/P&quot;. These were used by the British Special Air Service during the Falklands War.

===M4 carbine===

In the early 1980s, at the request of the United States Marine Corps, Colt upgraded the M16A1 rifle, resulting in the M16A2 rifle. Among the major changes were a reinforced lower receiver, a case deflector, a birdcage flash suppressor redesigned to be a muzzle brake, and a barrel with a faster 1-in-7 twist. The faster barrel was necessitated by the switch from the 55-grain M193 bullet to the 62-grain M855 bullet. The M16A2 rifle&#x27;s barrel was also thicker for the portion in front of the handguard. Colt incorporated these changes into its carbines, which it called M16A2 carbines. The &quot;Model 723&quot; M16A2 carbine used the iron sights of the M16A1, but had a case deflector. The barrel had a 1-in-7 twist, but the thinner profile of the older M16A1 carbine&#x27;s barrel. As with the Model 653, the United States military made small purchases of the Model 723 for its special operation forces. It was notably used by Delta Force operators from the late 1980s to the early 1990s.

In 1983, Diemaco developed a carbine similar to the Model 723, the &quot;C8 carbine&quot; for use by the Canadian Forces. The original C8s were built by Colt as the &quot;Model 725&quot;. In 1984, the U.S. government asked Colt to develop a carbine with maximum commonality with the issue M16A2. Colt named the carbine as the &quot;XM4&quot;. The project would eventually culminate in the development and official adoption of the M4 carbine in 1994.

====M4 Commando====
Though Colt has focused its attention on carbines with barrels and rifles with barrels, Colt continues to make carbines with barrels, which it calls Commandos. Originally, Commandos were assembled from whatever spare parts were available, so &quot;Model 733&quot; Commandos could have A1-style upper receivers with case deflectors or A2-style upper receivers, and M16A1-profile 1:7 or M16A2-profile 1:7 barrels. Depending on the specific models, Commandos may have had three-position fire control groups (safe/semi-automatic/three-round burst), or four-position having both full-automatic and burst. The modern Model 933 has a &quot;flattop&quot; receiver, with a removable carrying handle and a MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail, with semi-automatic and automatic fire. The &quot;Model 935&quot; Commando has the features of the Model 933, but has three-round burst fire instead of automatic. Though originally called the M16A2 Commando, Colt now markets them as the &quot;M4 Commando&quot;.

The M4 Commando with its short barrel suffers the same failings as its predecessors: a substantially lower muzzle velocity and greater muzzle flash, in comparison to longer M16 rifles and carbines. The lower muzzle velocity can reduce carbines&#x27; wounding effects. However, United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance personnel sometimes used M4 Commandos in place of their M9 pistols. United States Army Special Operations Command Groups also use M4 Commandos as self-defense weapons. United States Navy SEALs use the ultra-compact Mk 18 Mod 0 with its barrel in a similar role.

====GAU-5A Aircrew Self Defense Weapon====
In 2019, a solution to give a personal firepower upgrade over the traditional sidearm for US aircrews in ACES ejection seat–equipped aircraft was to use commercially available AR-15 rifle parts including a special short quick-release barrel, collapsible stock, folding pistol-grip, and four magazines to fit inside the survival kit pan of the ejection seat. Major Gibson, an Air Force spokesperson, said, &quot;This has driven the dimension of 16 × 14 × 3.5 inches.&quot; The Aircrew Self Defense Weapon is to be included in survival kits for A-10, B-1, B-2, B-52, F-15C, F-15E, F-16, and F-22 aircraft. The rifle is being built at U.S. Air Force Gunsmith Shop at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas. 2,137 GAU-5A ASDWs are planned.

<doc id="971621" wikidata="Q4908997" url="?curid=971621" title="Bill Fiske, Baron Fiske">
<text>William Geoffrey Fiske, Baron Fiske, CBE (3 July 1905 – 13 January 1975) was a British politician who was the first Leader of the Greater London Council and oversaw the decimalisation of the pound sterling as Chairman of the Decimal Currency Board.

==Early life==

Fiske came from a middle-class family with radical sympathies who often discussed politics, with his maternal grandfather being a particularly strong influence. In his early life, Fiske&#x27;s main interest was in the art of ancient Greece. He was sent to Berkhamsted Collegiate School, and upon leaving, went to work for the Bank of England. After twelve years at the Bank, he took advantage of its generous pension scheme and left in 1935, and began to work as a Company Secretary.

==Career==

When World War II broke out, Fiske was drafted as a specialist into the Civil Service where he founded the Society of Civil Servants. The war helped to energise him in politics generally and he unsuccessfully fought the constituency of Hornsey for the Labour Party in the general election of 1945.

The next year saw Fiske elected to the London County Council for Hammersmith South, a seat previously held by the Conservatives. He lost his seat at the next LCC election in 1949, but remained a member when he was chosen as an alderman for a six-year term. He gradually became so enthusiastic about council work that, by 1955, it had eclipsed his previous ambitions to be elected to Parliament. (On becoming Leader of the GLC, he observed that &quot;Here you see far more of the results of what you do than you can across the river.&quot;) In the 1956 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In 1955, he was elected as a councillor for the new seat of Barons Court, holding it until 1965.

Fiske became popular among his colleagues in the Labour Group, and in 1960, was elected as Chief Whip, deposing Freda Corbet who had held the job for 12 years and was a close ally of the Labour leader Isaac Hayward. He was less popular among individual members of the Labour Party, and when the LCC was abolished, he was selected as a candidate for the new Greater London Council in Havering, which was marginal. He was however selected as the Leader of the Labour Group for the GLC elections.

He fought the 1964 elections on traditional lines, campaigning on the record of the LCC in building new council housing which was regarded as good quality at the time. Despite predictions that the wider boundaries of the GLC would hand power to the Conservatives, Fiske was returned in his own seat and Labour won a comfortable victory. When Labour won the general election later that year, Fiske was given a knighthood.

In power, Fiske&#x27;s administration treated the GLC as a version of the LCC with wider boundaries, which ignored the increased power of the new London Boroughs. Attempts to press GLC policy on unwilling boroughs were made but could now be resisted. The GLC also had to cope with increasing road transport problems because of the increase in the number of cars. Fiske proposed to increase charges for parking in inner London, with residents&#x27; parking permits required for those living in the zone, stating that he hoped more people would leave their car and use public transport. The scheme proved unpopular among car drivers.

Fiske carried out a policy of subsidies for the arts, and it was under his leadership that the decision was made to build the Royal National Theatre on the South Bank site. He, himself, served as a member of the board. However, he was unable to hold council house rents down as far as he wished.

The 1967 elections took place when the Labour Government of Harold Wilson had become unpopular and it was accepted that Fiske would find it difficult to hold on. However, the result was shattering. Not only did Fiske lose his own seat, but the Labour Party was reduced to only 20 members. Fiske accepted immediately that his career in local politics was over. On 18 September 1967 he received a life peerage with the title Baron Fiske, of Brent in Greater London as a consolation.

He had already been handed a lifeline by Chancellor of the Exchequer James Callaghan who, thinking of his Bank of England experience, appointed him Chairman of the Decimal Currency Board on 12 December 1966. Fiske was charged with arranging the changeover from a Pound consisting of 20 shillings, with each shilling containing 12 pence, to a decimalised Pound of 100 new pence.

Fiske led an ambitious public campaign in the years leading up to the switch, trying to make sure every business and every consumer was aware of the implications. Public information films were made and shown on television and leaflets were distributed by the Government. The date for the switch, which became known as &#x27;Decimal Day&#x27; or &#x27;D day&#x27;, was set for Monday 15 February 1971 but the new decimal coins (some of which were the same value as existing pre-decimal coinage) were introduced gradually.

In the event, despite some predictions of disaster, D day went off smoothly, with the main concerns being over retailers using the opportunity to round prices up and thereby boost inflation. The Decimal Currency Board was wound up at the end of 1971, and Fiske then went into retirement. He used his seat in the Lords to campaign in support of council tenants, statutory control of estate agents, and for better treatment of diabetes.

<text>Damian Higgins (born 1972) better known by his stage name Dieselboy, is an American drum and bass DJ and music producer.

==Early life==
Dieselboy was born Damian Higgins in Tarpon Springs, Florida in 1972. At the age of six he moved to Colorado City, Colorado, where he and his two sisters were raised by their mother. He moved with his family to Oil City, Pennsylvania, on the third day of school in the 9th grade, and is a graduate of Oil City Senior High School.

He is the eldest son of singer/songwriter Bertie Higgins whose ballad &quot;Key Largo&quot; reached #8 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100 chart in 1982.

Higgins&#x27;s early musical experience included playing drums in a school marching band and DJing for high school dances.

Higgins attended the University of Pittsburgh from 1990 to 1995 where he gained additional DJing experience, and completed a degree in information science. He also played on a Carnegie Mellon University radio station (WRCT). The name Dieselboy originated from Higgins&#x27;s IRC handle, &quot;Diesel&quot;. Upon discovering a local graffiti artist shared the alias, he &quot;made it Dieselboy.&quot;

==Career==
=== Early career ===
In 1994, Higgins created a mixtape entitled &quot;The Future Sound of Hardcore,&quot; and sold about 100 copies through online LISTSERVs. &quot;Through [the mixtape], people heard about me and I started getting bookings on the East Coast. It was a very slow process that eventually snowballed into my getting flown various places.&quot; In 1996, at the request of Dan Donnelly of British Drum and bass label Suburban Base, Dieselboy did a mix called &quot;DrumAndBass Selection USA&quot;. In 1997, Suburban Base had him follow up with &quot;97 Octane&quot;, this time allowing him to submit track suggestions, resulting in a more varied selection. In 1998, his mix called &quot;611 DJ Mix-series Vol. One&quot; was released. Dieselboy did the graphics for the cover. Also that year, Dieselboy recorded a mix called &quot;Director’s Cut&quot; which he had packaged in film cans, his first experiment in presenting a dance mix in a quasi-cinematic framework.

In 1998, Dieselboy initiated Philadelphia&#x27;s first 21+ drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass weekly Thursday club night entitled &quot;Platinum&quot; at club Fluid, which ended on October 14, 2004. Platinum residents included Dieselboy, Kaos, Method One, Sine, Icon, Karl K, Mason, and MC&#x27;s Dub2, Messinian, Armanni Reign, Sharpness, and Illy Emcee. It was rekindled in late 2009 featuring Mason, Sine and MC&#x27;s Messinian &amp; Sharpness.

In 1999, Dieselboy released his fourth mix CD, &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot; on the Moonshine label. It opened with his first original “intro” and marked his CD debut as a producer with &quot;Atlantic State&quot;, a track co-produced with Technical Itch. Also released on the Moonshine label was System Upgrade (2000) while Dieselboy joined forces with Palm Pictures/Island Recordings and his releases &quot;The Descent&quot;, &quot;Invid&quot;, &quot;Render&quot;. &quot;The 6ixth Session&quot; was a double CD release on Palm Pictures, featuring a cyborg-themed mix described by the Washington Post as “hard-edged hyperdriven dance music&quot;. 

In a 2000 interview with JIVE Magazine, Dieselboy discussed his roots and the rising popularity of drum and bass music, &quot;Well, when I started playing there wasn&#x27;t drum and bass per say[sic], but I was playing stuff that was prototype drum and bass, stuff that led up to it, like early break beat and it was called dark side which is like fast dark breakbeat. I couldn&#x27;t have predicted it, I definitely wanted it to become more popular, my goal was to get more people into it and open up the scene a little bit. I hold onto my goal on that...I wouldn&#x27;t have predicted that it was going to be where it is, that [DNB] would be in commercials or that I was going end up DJ-ing so much.&quot;

Dieselboy is represented by agencies &quot;Corson Agency (USA) and RVLT Agency (Europe)&quot; for booking.

=== Creative career ===
In January 2022, Dieselboy founded &quot;Destroyer Design&quot;, a graphic design agency. Dieselboy began his design journey in 1991, has a background in both DJing and graphic design. During the pandemic, he transitioned to launch Destroyer, offering design, creative direction, and branding services. The agency&#x27;s portfolio includes work for various restaurants and bars, with clients like Bonnie’s, Win Son, Rolo’s, Cozy Royale, The Meat Hook, Mischa, Empellon Al Pastor, Empellon Taqueria, Nura, Variety Coffee (NYC), The Far Out Lounge (AUSTIN), Point Easy, Hop Alley (DENVER), Kinn (LOS ANGELES), Adroit Theory (VA), and more.

In July 2018, Dieselboy co-founded a streetwear company called Death Saves, specializing in metal and fantasy-themed apparel, in collaboration with actor Joe Manganiello. Dieselboy served as the Design Director for Death Saves.

Destroyer 2 featured Corey Burton, a voiceover artist, for the intro vocals. Awakening marked Dieselboy&#x27;s first and only collaboration with members of Planet Of The Drums.

Dieselboy has been involved in various clothing collaborations, including work with NEO4IC (formerly Damascus Apparel) in San Diego.

=== Human Imprint ===
On August 13, 2023, Dieselboy hosted his inaugural drum and bass event in NYC, named &quot;BIG DRUM AND BASS PARTY&quot;, in collaboration with promotion company Driven AM.

Dieselboy released his 93-track, 87-minute mix &quot;Dieselboy – The Destroyer&quot; on August 5, 2014. The mix and its art incorporate the aesthetics of his 2014 tour as Blood, Sweat and Bass with bass music producer Downlink and 1970s exploitation films. It includes a new collaboration with drum and bass producer Gridlok called &quot;MDMX,&quot; and three tracks by Faces of Def, a new collaborative project between Dieselboy and Mark the Beast [&quot;Blvck Celebration&quot; with Counterstrike (SubHuman); &quot;Carcosa&quot; with Mayhem and Downlink (SubHuman); remix of &quot;Tuh Tuh Duh&quot; by Sinister Souls (PRSPCT)].

On January 31, 2014, Dieselboy and bass music artist Downlink teamed up to launch a DJ touring project known as BLOOD, SWEAT AND BASS. Over the years, they&#x27;ve conducted five successful tours across the United States and Canada. These tours have included various support artists, such as Apashe, Craze, Justin Hawkes, KJ Sawka, Ajapai, and more.

On January 31, 2011, Dieselboy released his first new mix in two and a half years, &quot;Dieselboy – Unleashed!&quot;, as a free download on SoundCloud. He also performed with Skrillex. In 2012 he released the mix &quot;Wake The Dead&quot; on SoundCloud. On May 23, 2013, Dieselboy&#x27;s mix &quot;Beyond the Black Bassline&quot; was released by Skrillex&#x27;s then new NEST HQ website.

In May 2008, Dieselboy released his ninth major mix-CD Substance D (Human Imprint), which reached the Billboard Dance/Electronic album chart. In conjunction with this release, Dieselboy initiated the &quot;Monsters of Jungle&quot; tour with rotating Human Imprint label artists including Evol Intent, Ewun, Demo, Mayhem, SPKTRM, Infiltrata and MC Messinian.

In 2006, Dieselboy released his first Human Imprint compilation called &quot;The HUMAN Resource&quot;. Disc One &quot;Selected Works&quot;, is a 12-song un-mixed selection. Disc Two &quot;Evol Intent Assemble the&quot; Monster &quot;features a continuous DJ-mix from Evol Intent.&quot;

In the summer of 2000, Dieselboy contributed to the formation of the drum and bass DJ crew called &quot;Planet of the Drums&quot;, alongside AK1200, DJ Dara, and MC Messinian.

=== SubHuman ===
In July 2009, Human Imprint parted amicably from System Recordings. In summer 2010, Human relaunched with Steve Gordon of Steez Promo and Circle Management as new co-owner with Dieselboy, and they created the SubHuman for dubstep and electro releases.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2009 headlining a 3D Productions event at Club 24 in Washington, D.C., Dieselboy played a three-hour multi-subgenre set including drum and bass, dubstep and electro. The enthusiastic crowd response encouraged him to continue experimenting with this new open format into 2010. In January 2013 Dieselboy started playing all drum and bass sets again.

==Culinary career ==
In 2014, Dieselboy&#x27;s passion for food advanced beyond writing about it for the James Beard Award-winning FirstWeFeast.com blog, into professional kitchens. He cooked a sold-out collaboration dinner with respected chefs Matt McCallister and Alex Stupak at FT33 restaurant in Dallas on June 9, 2014. Dieselboy competed in a nacho battle against chef Alex Stupak at Empellón Cocina in New York in February 2013, which he lost. He came back to face off against chefs Alex Stupak, Michael Anthony, Wylie Dufresne and Seamus Mullen in February 2014, beating Mullen.

Dieselboy assisted chefs Dave Beran (Chicago), Daniel Patterson (San Francisco), and Christina Tosi (New York City) at an Art Basel dinner hosted by Questlove in Miami on December 6, 2014.

In November 2014, Dieselboy&#x27;s cooking was featured at his first &quot;pop-up&quot; event called &quot;Burger Night with Dieselboy&quot; at the Groningen, Netherlands restaurant De Boom, preceding his DJ performance at Subsonic nightclub. In January 2015, another pop-up hamburger event took place at P60 cafe in Amstelveen, Netherlands as a prelude to his DJ gig at the P60 club.

In 2012, Dieselboy was a co-presenter with mixologist Jim Meehan (PDT, New York City) and chef/designer Taavo Somer at the Origins and Frontiers mixology workshop at the 7th Annual StarChefs.com International Chefs Congress in New York City. Dieselboy&#x27;s cocktail &quot;The Higgins&quot; is published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ cocktail writer Robert Simonson&#x27;s 2014 book &quot;The Old-Fashioned&quot; (Ten Speed Press).

Dieselboy collaborated with Betony restaurant chef Bryce Shuman on a limited edition hot dog as part of a monthlong &quot;musicians and chefs&quot; special menu at the New York City cocktail lounge PDT in May 2015. On August 9, 2015 as part of the Moonrise Festival in Baltimore, Maryland, Dieselboy and The Glitch Mob hosted a Taco Party for contest winners.

==Awards and recognition==
Dieselboy placed #23 in the 2014 America&#x27;s Best DJ Poll, up 19 from the previous year&#x27;s #42, between Moby and BT. Dieselboy was the highest ranked drum &amp; bass DJ (#45) in the 2008 DJ Times America&#x27;s Best DJ Poll.

On February 12, 2012 in accepting his Grammy for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical, Skrillex (Sonny Moore) ended his comments quoting Dieselboy as saying &quot;All the boats rise with the water.&quot;

In 1998, Dieselboy was the first American drum &amp; bass DJ to be nominated for Best Drum &amp; Bass DJ at the Global DJ Mix Awards, tying with LTJ Bukem.

== Personal life ==
Dieselboy has a son with his ex-partner Jackie Carnesi, born in 2018.

<text>Eisler Liván Hernández Carrera (; born February 20, 1975) is a Cuban-born former professional baseball pitcher in Major League Baseball. Over a 17-year career, he played for nine different teams and was named to two All-Star Games. He was named the MVP of the 1997 World Series with the Florida Marlins. He is the half-brother of pitcher Orlando &quot;El Duque&quot; Hernández.

Hernández played for the Florida Marlins (1996–1999), the San Francisco Giants (1999–2002), the Montreal Expos (2003–2004), the Washington Nationals (2005–2006, 2009–2011), the Arizona Diamondbacks (2006–2007), the Minnesota Twins (2008), the Colorado Rockies (2008), the New York Mets (2009), the Atlanta Braves (2012) and the Milwaukee Brewers (2012). He bats and throws right-handed, and was known for throwing a &quot;slow hook&quot; curveball, sometimes below 60 miles per hour, as a strikeout pitch.

A two-time All-Star, Hernández was considered to be a great defensive pitcher, having made just fifteen errors in his career. He was described as a workhorse due to his ability to pitch deep into games. Between 1998 and 2007, he never pitched fewer than 199 innings in any given season (in 1999 he threw only 199 innings). Hernández led the National League in innings pitched in three consecutive seasons, 2003 through 2005, and led the league in complete games for the first two of those years. In 2005, he once threw 150 pitches in nine innings, although the game went into extra innings after he left. In 2004 and 2005, he led the major leagues with 3,927 and 4,009 pitches, respectively.

==Early life==
Hernández was born to a poor family in the Villa Clara Province in Cuba. Hernández&#x27;s actual age has been the subject of debate. Some believe he is older than his given birthday. After meeting recruiter Joe Cubas in Venezuela in 1994, the two planned an escape through Mexico. At the age of 20, Hernández gave up his job as an official Cuban athlete and defected to the United States in 1995. His half-brother, Orlando, would defect two years later.

==Professional career==
After meeting with numerous team officials in the Dominican Republic, Hernández signed a four-year, $4.5 million contract with the Florida Marlins on January 13, 1996, in order to live in Miami.

===Florida Marlins (1996–1999)===
He made his major league debut for the Marlins on September 24, 1996, tossing three scoreless innings in a relief appearance against the Atlanta Braves. Hernández joined the team for good in June 1997. He finished his rookie season with a 9–3 record, a 3.17 ERA, and 72 strikeouts in 17 starts.

The Marlins reached the 1997 World Series, and Hernández started and won Games 1 and 5 of the series against the Cleveland Indians. In the 1997 National League Championship Series, he struck out a postseason-record 15 batters in Game 5 against the Atlanta Braves. His efforts earned him the World Series MVP trophy.

Before Game 7, Hernández was able to meet his mother, Miriam Carreras, for the first time in two years. The moment was the result of concerted efforts by the Cuban and United States governments as well as a written plea from the entire roster of players. His mother and sister now reside in Miami.

===San Francisco Giants (1999–2002)===
On July 25, 1999, the Marlins traded Hernández to the San Francisco Giants for minor leaguers Nate Bump and Jason Grilli. He tallied a career-high 17 wins in 2000, finishing the year with a 17–11 record in 33 starts, alongside a 3.75 ERA in 240 innings. He would regress slightly in the next two seasons, despite pitching and 216 innings respectively, as he went 13–15 with a 5.24 ERA in 2001 and 12–16 with a 4.38 ERA in 2002 (his 16 losses that year were tied for the most in the National League).

Hernández would go on to pitch in five postseason games during his stint with the Giants, one in 2000 and four in 2002. During the 2002 postseason, Hernández had a record of 1–2 with an ERA of 6.20.

===Montréal Expos / Washington Nationals (2003–2006)===
On March 23, 2003, following his loss in Game 7 of the 2002 World Series, Hernández, along with infielder Edwards Guzmán, were traded by the Giants to the Montréal Expos for relief pitchers Jim Brower and Matt Blank.

From 2003 to 2005, Hernández led the National League in innings pitched, and led the league in complete games 2003 and 2004. In 2003, Hernández posted a 15–10 record and had a career-low 3.20 ERA in 33 starts. He threw innings, including eight complete games, giving up just 225 hits and 57 walks, while recording 178 strikeouts (the seventh-most in the NL) and a career-high 6.87 K/9 ratio, and turned in 22 quality starts. Hernández was particularly dominant in July, going 4–1 in six starts with a 1.80 ERA in 50 innings, throwing three complete games, striking out 43 and holding opponents to a .197 batting average. This helped earn him the NL Pitcher of the Month Award (he also won the Player of the Week Award on July 13, after throwing back-to-back complete game victories and striking out 16.). His most dominant stretch came from July 2 to September 5; Hernández recorded 13 consecutive quality starts, allowing two earned runs or less in 11 of those starts, and pitching at least seven innings in all but one of them. He recorded a 9–2 record with a 1.54 ERA in 105 innings during this stretch, averaging over eight innings per start, while striking out 95 against just 24 walks and holding opponents to a .203 batting average.

The following season, Hernández was selected to represent the Expos at the 2004 All-Star Game in Houston, Texas. This would turn out to be the first of two selections to the Midsummer Classic for Hernández during his career and the last All-Star selection for the Expos. Despite an 11–15 record, Hernández posted a respectable 3.60 ERA in 35 starts (20 of his starts were quality). His 255 innings pitched led all major league pitchers, while giving up just 234 hits, 86 walks, 26 home runs, and holding opponents to a .248 batting average. He struck out a career-high 186 batters (good for ninth in the NL) and threw nine complete games, including two shutouts. Hernández also won the National League Silver Slugger Award for a pitcher, hitting .247 with one home run and 10 RBI.

Between the 2004 and 2005 MLB season, the Montréal Expos franchise, with Hernández in tow, relocated to Washington, D.C. to become the Washington Nationals. Hernández started and won the first major league game in Washington since 1971, defeating the Arizona Diamondbacks 5–3 on April 14, 2005. In 2005, Hernández would once again lead the National League in innings pitched, as well as earn his second All-Star selection; along with reliever Chad Cordero, he was the first All-Star in the new Nationals&#x27; history.

After the 2005 season, Hernández had knee surgery, and his performance in the first half of 2006 suffered. At the All-Star break, he had a 5.64 ERA, and opposing batters had been batting .308 against him. But over his last five starts with the Nationals, he had a 3.27 ERA with four walks and 23 strikeouts.

===Arizona Diamondbacks (2006–2007)===
On August 7, 2006, Hernández was traded from the Nationals to the Arizona Diamondbacks for two young pitching prospects, Matt Chico and Garrett Mock. He made 10 starts with Arizona to close out the season, going 4–5 with a 3.76 ERA.

Hernández struggled in 2007, finishing the season 11–11 with a 4.93 ERA in 33 starts. He led the majors in home runs allowed, with 34, and had the lowest strikeout-to-walk ratio in the Major Leagues (1.14).

===Minnesota Twins (2008)===
On February 12, 2008, Hernández signed a one-year, $5 million deal with the Minnesota Twins, including an additional $2 million for performance bonuses. Through July 20, 2008, Hernández led all Twins starting pitchers with 10 wins and innings pitched. He was 10–6 with 5.29 ERA and 47 strikeouts. On August 1, 2008, Hernández was designated for assignment to make room for Francisco Liriano. At the time, he was 10–8 with a 5.48 ERA in 23 starts for the Twins.

===Colorado Rockies (2008)===
On August 6, Hernández was claimed off waivers by the Colorado Rockies. He posted a record of 3–3 with an 8.03 ERA and 13 strikeouts in innings across eight starts with the Rockies.

Hernández ended 2008 having given up 12.9 hits per nine innings, the highest rate in the majors, had a major-league-worst .342 batting-average-against, and his 3.4 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched were the lowest rate in the major leagues. Batters also made contact with his pitches 91.3% of the time that they swung at them, easily the highest percentage among major league starters.

===New York Mets (2009)===
On February 14, 2009, Hernández signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets. He won the fifth spot in the rotation, and was added to the major league roster when his turn came up on April 11.

In 2009, Hernández was one of only three active players, along with Derek Lowe and Brad Ausmus, to have played 12 or more seasons without going on the disabled list.

Hernández securely established himself as a dependable starting pitcher early in the Mets&#x27; 2009 pitching rotation. On May 26, 2009, Hernández threw a complete game, allowing just one earned run through his nine innings courtesy of an Adam Dunn home run in a 6–1 win over his former club, the Washington Nationals. He was the first pitcher to throw a complete game in Citi Field, and became the only active player to have thrown a complete game with six different teams.

However, after struggling greatly in July and August, Hernández&#x27;s job was put in jeopardy. After a 6–2 loss to the Diamondbacks, manager Jerry Manuel decided to start Hernández against the San Francisco Giants, who handed the Mets a 10–1 loss on August 17, 2009. Subsequently, on August 20, the Mets released Hernández to make room for Billy Wagner on the active roster.

===Second stint with the Washington Nationals (2009–2011)===
On August 26, 2009, Hernández re-signed with the Washington Nationals. He went 2–4 with a 5.36 ERA in eight starts to finish the season.

On February 24, 2010, Hernández signed a minor league deal to stay with the Nationals. He was called up on April 11. Hernández had a bounce-back season in 2010, finishing 10–12 with a 3.66 ERA in 33 starts. On August 29, 2010, he signed a one-year contract extension with the Nationals for the 2011 season.

Hernández was the starting pitcher on Opening Day of the 2011 season, his fourth Opening Day appearance for the franchise. Despite allowing only two earned runs on four hits in innings, he took the loss in a 2–0 defeat to the Atlanta Braves.

On August 30 against the Braves, Hernández threw his 50,000th pitch of his MLB career, getting Jair Jurrjens to ground out and end the inning. Since 1988, only 11 pitchers have thrown more pitches.

===Houston Astros===
On January 31, 2012, Hernández signed a minor league contract with the Houston Astros with an invitation to attend spring training. He was released by the Astros on March 30.

===Atlanta Braves (2012)===
Within hours of being released by the Astros, Hernández was signed to a one-year Major League deal by the Atlanta Braves as a relief pitcher. On May 5, 2012, he recorded his first career save in his 485th major league appearance. On June 19, 2012, Hernández was released by the Braves. His release came after his relief appearance on June 10 where he allowed seven hits (including two home runs) in just innings as the Braves were defeated by the Toronto Blue Jays.

===Milwaukee Brewers (2012)===
On June 22, 2012, Hernández signed a one-year deal with the Milwaukee Brewers. Following the season, he was removed from the 40-man roster and opted to become a free agent.

==Retirement==
After not playing in the Major Leagues for a full season, Hernández officially retired from professional play on March 13, 2014. Hernández filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on June 30, 2017, in United States bankruptcy court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Despite earning more than $53 million during his 15-year career, his assets were worth no more than $50,000 and he owed up to $1 million to as many as 50 creditors. Court documents revealed Hernández had no bank account and gambled heavily at local South Florida casinos.

Hernández now runs a youth baseball academy in Miami.

==Pitching style==
As a young man, Hernández had a fastball in the mid-90s, a slider, and a changeup. As he aged, he became a finesse pitcher who relied on locating his pitches rather than generating great pitch speed. His primary pitch was a sinker sitting at 83–87 mph. He also had a four-seam fastball in the same speed range. Another main pitch, used mostly against right-handed hitters, was a cut fastball at 79–82 mph. His off-speed offering to right-handers was a curveball ranging from 65 to 70 mph. Against lefties, he also added a changeup in the upper 70s. His four-seam fastball was the slowest among all MLB starters in the 2011 season.

Hernández was an excellent fielder throughout his career, finishing seven full seasons without making an error. He posted a career .982 fielding percentage committing only 15 errors in 827 total chances in 3,189 innings of work and 519 games pitched. , he owns the 128th-best fielding percentage all-time among pitchers. He also was a better than average hitting pitcher, posting a .221 batting average (215-for-973) with 64 runs, 38 doubles, 10 home runs and 85 RBI.

<doc id="971634" wikidata="Q4735122" url="?curid=971634" title="Alpha Sigma Alpha">
<text>Alpha Sigma Alpha () is a United States National Panhellenic sorority founded on November 15, 1901, at the Virginia State Female Normal School (later known as Longwood College and now known as Longwood University) in Farmville, Virginia.

Once a sorority exclusively for teacher&#x27;s/educational colleges, Alpha Sigma Alpha became a full member of the National Panhellenic Conference in 1951, and, as a social sorority, now admits members without limits based on major. There are currently over 175 chapters of Alpha Sigma Alpha nationwide with more than 120,000 members. It is currently partnered with philanthropic organizations Special Olympics and Girls on the Run.

==History==

=== Founding ===
In the fall of 1901, at Longwood University, five young women, all friends, decided to rush the local women&#x27;s fraternities on campus. However, rather than accepting bids that would separate the group, they decided to form their own sorority. The Founders were:
* Virginia Lee Boyd-Noell (Virginia Boyd)
* Juliette Jefferson Hundley-Gilliam (Juliette Hundley)
* Calva Hamlet Watson-Wootton (Calva Watson)
* Louise Burks Cox-Carper (Louise Cox)
* Mary Williamson-Hundley (Mary Williamson)

On November 15, 1901, Alpha Sigma Alpha was named and chartered. The charter stated &quot;The purpose of the association shall be to cultivate friendship among its members, and in every way to create pure and elevating sentiments, to perform such deeds and to mold such opinions as will tend to elevate and ennoble womanhood in the world.&quot;

In the year after the charter was signed the founders announced the Sorority&#x27;s first hymn, &quot;Blest Be the Tie that Binds&quot;, and first open motto, &quot;to one another ever faithful&quot;. The first colors were crimson and silver, the flower was the white carnation, and the jewel was the emerald. The first membership badge of the Sorority was a shield topped with a jewel set crown, with the Greek letters ΑΣΑ inscribed in gold on a black background. On February 13, 1903, Alpha Sigma Alpha was chartered in the Circuit Court of Prince Edward County, VA, by Judge George Jefferson Hundley, the father of one of the founding members. This chartering began the organization&#x27;s legal existence, the first of many steps toward expanding the sorority and making Alpha Sigma Alpha a national sorority.

Alpha Sigma Alpha is one of the &quot;Farmville Four&quot; sororities founded at the university, which includes Kappa Delta, Sigma Sigma Sigma, and Zeta Tau Alpha. A clock tower at the university campus with a clock face representing each sorority is dedicated to the four. Each sorority in the &quot;Farmville Four&quot; is also a member of the National Panhellenic Conference, which governs the 26 national social sororities.

=== Early challenges ===
Alpha Sigma Alpha expanded quickly, installing 13 chapters in its first decade, and then began having issues due to the anti-sorority sentiment of the time, causing one of the chapters to be disbanded only months after its instatement. Despite the anti-sorority attitude, Alpha Sigma Alpha&#x27;s first six chapters held its first National Convention at the Hotel Richmond in Richmond, VA over the 1905 Thanksgiving weekend. During the convention, the first National Council was elected and the sorority created its magazine, to be published three times a year. This first publication was first printed in 1906. In 1908, the magazine&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;Aegis of Alpha Sigma Alpha&quot;. In 1911, Alpha Sigma Alpha became a professional sorority within the field of education.

Soon after, Alpha Sigma Alpha&#x27;s chapters began to struggle with membership and function. Alpha Sigma Alpha first contacted (Sarah) Ida Shaw Martin – founder and former national president of Delta Delta Delta and author of the Sorority Handbook – for assistance in 1912. By that year, only four of the 13 chapters established since the sorority&#x27;s founding were left, and by the next, only one active chapter existed, the original &quot;Alpha chapter&quot;. Shaw Martin suggested ASA contact a local sorority at Miami, Ohio, which was then installed as an ASA chapter. Shaw Martin&#x27;s assistance led to her induction as an honorary member and the sorority&#x27;s expansion at teacher&#x27;s colleges. The sorority would absorb many more local chapters over the next few years.

As the sorority began to stabilize, it held a convention to reorganize itself over Thanksgiving in 1914. At this convention, the sorority adopted a constitution and modified its symbols, customs, and ritual. Here, Shaw Martin was elected national president, and the sorority renamed its magazine to its current name, &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, which became a weekly publication edited by Shaw Martin. It functioned &quot;as the central medium linking the various parts of the Sorority... it consisted entirely of instructions and discussions of Sorority rulings and policy, chapter newsletters and excerpts from articles on morals and ethics for fraternal organizations.&quot;

In 1915 the sorority founded the Association of Education Sororities with Sigma Sigma Sigma to develop common standards for the formation and expansion of educational sororities. Although Shaw Martin petitioned the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) in 1920, this request was rejected on the basis that women could not hold dual membership in two NPC organizations (as Shaw Martin would if the education sororities were accepted).

=== Modern day ===
In 1947, the six sororities of the AES voted to dissolve it and petitioned to join the NPC. On November 27, 1951, Alpha Sigma Alpha was officially welcomed as a full member of the NPC. From that point on, Alpha Sigma Alpha could potentially establish a chapter at any university recognized by the NPC, no longer limited to those specific to the education profession.

Since then, Alpha Sigma Alpha has partnered with various nonprofits in the name of philanthropy. Its philanthropic efforts began in 1958 when it established scholarships for intellectually disabled students and those in special needs education. In 1976, the sorority&#x27;s national headquarters announced a partnership with the Special Olympics. Since then, it has taken several other projects under its wing. The sorority added the S. June Smith Center, a day care center for intellectually disabled students, as a philanthropic partner in 1990.

In 1998, the sorority moved its national headquarters to Indianapolis, Indiana, and opened a new building a decade later in September 2008. It also adopted an official mascot that year, a ladybug named Dot.

Continuing its involvement with the Special Olympics, Alpha Sigma Alpha joined its campaign &quot;Spread the Word to End the Word&quot; in 2009. In 2012, the sorority added another national philanthropic partner, Girls on the Run.

==Symbols ==
Alpha Sigma Alpha has multiple official colors, flowers, jewels, and symbols. The primary colors of Alpha Sigma Alpha are crimson and pearl white, with palm green and gold as the sorority&#x27;s secondary colors. Its official flowers are both the aster (the fall flower) and the narcissus (the spring flower). For jewels, the fraternity chose the pearl (for members before initiation) and the ruby (for initiated members), which are also linked to the sorority&#x27;s primary colors. The symbols are the palm tree and the crown, which are linked to the secondary colors of palm green and gold. The sorority mascot is Dot the ladybug.

The insignia are the star, crown, palm tree, and phoenix. To the sorority, the star represents how its members should try to live up to the sorority&#x27;s values, while the crown represents leadership and alumnae recognition. The palm tree represents strong development, and the phoenix, the coat of arms&#x27; central and largest symbol, openly represents the sorority&#x27;s 1914 reorganization (or, a rebirth, linking it to the phoenix).

The original colors, flower, and jewel were respectively crimson and silver, the white carnation, and the emerald. The first membership badge was a shield topped with a jewel set crown, with the Greek letters ΑΣΑ inscribed in gold on a black background. In 1903, the membership badge changed to the diamond shape it has today.

== Activities ==
In 2016, Alpha Sigma Alpha relaunched its membership education program, where members learn about the sorority&#x27;s values. The program is broken down into four stages to correspond with four stages of membership, namely new members, initiates, senior members, and alumnae. The new member program includes online and in-person components, a handbook, a journal to reflect on the sorority&#x27;s ritual, and a mentorship via an older collegiate member. Initiates also learn about the sorority&#x27;s values online, have chapter programs, and may be certified to become a mentor to a new member if they wish. Graduating members have monthly meetings on how to transition from college and have a legacy project. Alumnae receive quarterly newspapers, blogs, and webinars.

The sorority currently runs a Sexual Assault Prevention Program, SPEAK UP, where members may watch videos online on topics including &quot;healthy relationships, bystander intervention, self-care and consent, and alcohol and risk reduction.&quot; Collegiate chapters host one workshop per semester on such topics, facilitated by a trained regional staff member.

=== Service ===
Alpha Sigma Alpha has run a Service Immersion Experience for its members since 2013, which consists of a service trip where members travel to Oahu, Hawaii, and work with local organizations. In 2012, the sorority began a program called D.O.T. Days, or Donating Our Time Days, which take place during the first week of October every year. Sorority members &quot;are encouraged to donate their time to the national philanthropic partners and local community.&quot;

=== Leadership ===
Various leadership programming exists for Alpha Sigma Alpha members, advisors, and volunteers. Advisors, volunteers, collegiate members, and alumnae may all attend the sorority&#x27;s National Convention &amp; Leadership Conference.

For its collegiate members, the sorority hosted its first leadership training school in 1966. In 1989, the sorority followed with its Emma Coleman Frost Leadership Development Institute. Collegiate members are also required to attend the sorority&#x27;s &quot;The Academy&quot; program on leadership and networking. Graduating college seniors and alumnae have a Women&#x27;s Advancement Series, which provides career feedback and help on connecting with local sisters.

Volunteers and advisors may attend a Region Volunteer Development Weekend or an Advisor Institute, respectively, which are each a weekend of leadership training and advice on chapter operations. The sorority began its leadership consultant program with their first &#x27;traveling secretary&#x27; in 1963, later called &#x27;field representatives&#x27;, before settling on its final name. Leadership consultants are the traveling staff of the national organization who educate college chapters on leadership and programming.

=== Publications ===
The current publication is &quot;The Phoenix&quot;. The magazine covers chapter news and includes features on members who are involved in their communities, memorial lists, praise for members on their personal successes, and miscellaneous articles.

The sorority has also published two cookbooks sourced from recipes members have submitted.

==Philanthropies==

The sorority&#x27;s various philanthropic partners include the Alpha Sigma Alpha Foundation, the S. June Smith Center, the Special Olympics, and Girls on the Run.

In 1986, Alpha Sigma Alpha combined the 1947 Endowment fund and the Development Fund established in 1982 into the Alpha Sigma Alpha Foundation. Initially, it was a scholarship-granting body, but it has branched out to provide the sorority&#x27;s members with grants and awards as well. The foundation also provides funds for chapter programming.

Two of the sorority&#x27;s philanthropies focus on helping people with disabilities. The S. June Smith Center provides services to children with disabilities and their families, including various types of therapy and instruction. The center was named after an Alpha Sigma Alpha member, Dr. S. June Smith. The Special Olympics is an organization for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, providing year-round training and competitions worldwide.

The sorority&#x27;s newest philanthropic partner is Girls on the Run, a non-profit which uses exercise to build healthy mental and physical habits in preteen girls.

== Awards ==

=== Collegiate awards ===
Collegiate members are recognized with awards for outstanding new members and sisters who exemplify service, academics, or athletics. Chapters also receive various awards.

Established in 1985, the Four-Star Chapter Award is given annually to collegiate chapters which excel in various areas. The areas covered include membership, academic excellence, finance, chapter education and operations, service and giving, national meetings and bylaws, organization image, policies and procedures, advisory board, and alumnae involvement. The chapter that achieves the highest percentage of requirements toward this award receives the Crown of Excellence Award, the top award that a collegiate chapter can receive.

Awards are also given to chapters which excel in single areas. Any collegiate chapter with the highest GPA on its campus for a school term receives the Scholastic Achievement Award. The Rose Marie Fellin Financial Excellence Award was established in 1992 in honor of its namesake&#x27;s 27 years of service as the headquarters executive. The award is given to a chapter practicing sound financial management through record keeping, accurate financial reports, communication with national headquarters, as well as striving towards overall financial stability. The Recruitment Excellence Award was established in 2010 and is presented to a chapter that has met its recruitment targets for the year. This encompasses reaching campus quota and total, as well as innovation in planning and implementing a quality recruitment plan. Sidney Gremillion Allen Panhellenic Award, named after the sorority&#x27;s NPC delegate, is given to the chapter that displays outstanding Panhellenic spirit and participation. The Service and Giving Award is given to a chapter that best exhibits generosity.

=== Alumnae awards ===
Alumnae chapters may receive several different awards: Palm, Star, or Crown Chapter; the Crown of Excellence; and Outstanding Membership Growth/Alumnae Panhellenic Engagement/Collegiate Chapter Relations/Programs/Community Involvement, Service and Giving.

Individual alumnae may receive their own awards. Alumnae whose professional or community achievements have attracted recognition outside of the sorority receive the Recognition of Eminence Award. First presented in 2012 at the sorority&#x27;s national convention, the Alpha Sigma Alpha Foundation Heart of Giving Award is given to an alumna who has made a significant contribution of time or money to a charitable organizations. The Evelyn G. Bell Award, named after a past national president, is given to an alumna member who exhibits exceptional leadership, loyalty and commitment to the sorority by serving as a collegiate officer, alumnae officer, and national volunteer. Other awards presented to members for dedication and service to the sorority are the Helen Corey Award, the Wilma Wilson Sharp Award, the Agape Award, and the Outstanding Advisor Award.

<text>Peter Bryan George (26 March 1924 – 1 June 1966) was a Welsh author, most famous for the 1958 Cold War thriller novel &quot;Red Alert&quot;, published initially with the title &quot;Two Hours to Doom&quot; and written using the pseudonym Peter Bryant. The book was the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot;.

==Life==
George was born in 1924 in Treorchy, Rhondda, Wales, and died aged 42 in Hastings, East Sussex, England. He was a flight lieutenant and navigator for the Royal Air Force during World War II serving with No. 255 Squadron RAF, flying night fighter missions over Malta and Italy. He rejoined the RAF serving at RAF Neatishead and as a fighter controller where he often wrote while on duty and used a pseudonym. He retired from the service in 1961.

On 1 June 1966, Peter George was found dead with a discharged double-barreled shotgun between his knees; his death was ruled a suicide.

==Works==
His best-known novel, &quot;Red Alert&quot; was written while he was a serving RAF officer (hence the original use of a pseudonym: &quot;Peter Bryant&quot; – the &quot;Bryan&quot; being from his middle name). Drawn from personal experience, &quot;Red Alert&quot; was the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s classic film &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot;. Interest in nuclear weapon themes, sparked by Stanley Kramer&#x27;s film version of the novel &quot;On the Beach&quot; in 1959, caused the movie rights to &quot;Red Alert&quot; to be sold that year, only to be transferred until Stanley Kubrick bought them in 1962, reportedly for as little as $3,500.

Another bestselling novel published in 1962, &quot;Fail Safe&quot;, was so similar to George&#x27;s nuclear war theme that both he and Kubrick sued on a charge of copyright infringement, settling out of court. Ironically the same movie studio, Columbia Pictures, which had financed and was distributing &quot;Strangelove&quot;, also bought &quot;Fail Safe&quot;, which had been an independently financed production. Since Kubrick insisted that the studio release his movie first in January 1964, the perceived commonality led to &quot;Fail Safe&quot; opening in October later that year to poor box office performance, despite excellent reviews for its more serious depiction of a nuclear crisis than Kubrick&#x27;s overtly satirical approach.

While Peter George received a co-writing credit for &quot;Strangelove&quot;&#x27;s screenplay with Kubrick and Terry Southern, it is unclear how much involvement he actually had, and he was reportedly dissatisfied with the comedic element Kubrick applied to the material. As a co-writer, he shared a &quot;Best Adapted Screenplay&quot; Oscar nomination. After the movie was released, he wrote a novelisation of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and dedicated it to Kubrick. It was out of print for many years but was to be re-issued in 2015 by Candy Jar Ltd and features previously unpublished material concerning Strangelove&#x27;s early career, with a foreword by George&#x27;s son, David.

George&#x27;s final completed novel before his suicide, &quot;Commander-1&quot;, envisaged a post-apocalyptic world in which a group of survivors is tyrannized by a dictator.

<text>Johannes Acronius Frisius (1520 – 18 October 1564) was a Dutch medical doctor and mathematician of the 16th century.

He was named after his city of birth, Akkrum in Friesland. From 1547 he worked as professor of mathematics in Basel, then after 1549 as professor of logic, and in 1564 of medicine. He died from the plague in the same year. Apart from mathematical and scientific works, he wrote Latin poetry and humanist tracts.

According to the &quot;Historical Dictionary of Switzerland&quot;, &quot;nothing justifies the usual identification of A[cronius] with the philologist and botanist Johannes Atrocianus&quot;.

<doc id="971645" wikidata="Q6608756" url="?curid=971645" title="List of people who received an electoral vote in the United States Electoral College">
<text>The following is a complete list of people who received an electoral vote in a United States presidential election. For all elections from 1804 onwards, &quot;P&quot; denotes a presidential vote, and &quot;VP&quot; denotes a vice presidential vote. Bold entries are successful candidates; &quot;Italicized&quot; entries are runners-up who became vice president under the original system (1788-1800).

This list includes eleven women, nine of whom received vice presidential votes: the first was Tonie Nathan who in 1972 received one vote from a faithless elector. This was followed by Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and Sarah Palin in 2008. Maria Cantwell, Susan Collins, Carly Fiorina and Winona LaDuke all received a single faithless vote for vice president in 2016, and in that same election Elizabeth Warren received two. Hillary Clinton and Faith Spotted Eagle in 2016 were the first women to receive electoral votes for president; Spotted Eagle&#x27;s single vote was from a faithless elector, and she was also the first Native American to receive an electoral vote for president. Kamala Harris became the first female vice president after the 2020 election.
==Special cases==
17 electors did not cast votes:
* Two Maryland electors and two Virginia electors in 1788.
* Two Maryland electors and one Vermont elector in 1792.
* A Kentucky elector in 1808.
* An Ohio elector in 1812.
* Three Maryland electors and one Delaware elector in 1816.
* Two Maryland electors in 1832.
* A Nevada elector in 1864.
* A Washington, DC elector, Barbara Lett-Simmons, in 2000.

There are also two cases where votes were rejected by Congress:
* In 1864, 17 electoral votes from Louisiana and Tennessee (received by Abraham Lincoln) were rejected due to issues relating to the American Civil War.
* In 1872:
** 14 votes from Arkansas and Louisiana (received by Ulysses S. Grant) were rejected due to various irregularities, including allegations of electoral fraud.
** Three electoral votes from Georgia (received by Horace Greeley) were rejected as the votes were cast after Greeley&#x27;s death.

<doc id="971650" wikidata="Q5525918" url="?curid=971650" title="Gary Seven">
<text>Gary Seven is the major character in the last episode of the second season of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series, &quot;&quot;. He is portrayed by Robert Lansing.

==&quot;Assignment: Earth&quot;==
The episode &quot;&quot; was originally a television pilot for a proposed series about Gary Seven, who, according to &quot;Assignment: Earth”, is a human from the 24th century undertaking a mission on Earth in 1968, &quot;the only Earth man to survive the transit.&quot; His goal in the original series pilot would have been to defeat the Omegans, a race of shape-changing aliens who have sent agents back in time to change Earth&#x27;s history so they can defeat Earth in the future.

The pilot was later reworked as an episode for &quot;Star Trek&quot;, where Seven is now a human raised on a distant planet.

==Powers and abilities==
Although Seven is human, he manifests at least one non-human feature: he is immune to the impact of the Vulcan nerve pinch, an ability very few human or humanoid characters of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe ever manifested. Seven utilizes a small pen-shaped device called a . It functions as a communication device, a remote control to his personal transporter, a handheld weapon with both stun and kill settings and enough precision to manipulate technology at a distance.

==Other &quot;Star Trek&quot; appearances==
===&quot;Star Trek&quot; novels===
In Greg Cox&#x27;s &quot;The Eugenics Wars&quot; novels, Gary Seven had numerous dealings with Khan Noonien Singh and initially hopes to train Khan as his successor. Along with his now-partner Roberta Lincoln, Seven tries to prevent World War III in a variety of ways. Seven leaves Earth in 1996, after sending Khan on the DY-100 class sleeper ship SS &quot;Botany Bay&quot;.

Cox also wrote a 1997 novel, &quot;Assignment: Eternity&quot;, featuring Seven. In this novel, the alien agency which Seven works for is called the &quot;Aegis&quot;, though whether this refers to the organization or the alien species in charge of the organization is unclear.

Seven is mentioned, but not seen, in the &quot;Star Trek: Department of Temporal Investigations: Watching the Clock&quot; novels as well as the 2017 novel &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation: Hearts and Minds&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot; comics===
According to several issues of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; comic books released by DC Comics in the 1990s (written by Howard Weinstein and Michael Jan Friedman), Gary Seven and Isis were sent by a force known as the &quot;Aegis&quot;, who took individuals from many worlds to selectively alter historical events. They gave their agents long lifespans, estimated to be as long as 1,000 years. Not all of these interventions went well—at least one led to an agent becoming the sole survivor of his homeworld—leading to a small rebellion against the Aegis. Several agents go so far as to injure or murder innocent beings who stand in their way.

Gary Seven later went against the wishes of the Aegis when he tried to stop the Devidians from altering the timeline so that the Federation would fall to the Romulans. Seven died in an initial attempt to rescue Spock from the Devidians, but was pulled from the timeline by the Aegis prior to the moment of his death after Exana (another agent of the Aegis, who was romantically involved with Seven) stopped the Devidians with the aid of Captain Kirk and Captain Picard.

In 2008, IDW Publishing launched an &quot;Assignment: Earth&quot; comic miniseries written and drawn by John Byrne.

===&quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;===
In the second season of the Star Trek canon series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, the character Tallinn is introduced. She is shown to be a supervisor, in 2024, carrying out the same role of guiding important human events that Gary Seven did in 1968. In the episode &quot;Watcher&quot;, Guinan tells Jean-Luc Picard that there is a supervisor in Los Angeles. In the episode &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, when Picard meets Tallinn, and she states she was recruited to be a supervisor, he tells her: &quot;Supervisors? Kirk&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot; crossed paths with a human called Gary. Gary Seven. He too was recruited by superior beings as an agent who would, in your words, protect the tapestry of history.&quot;

<text>A foam weapon, also known as a boffer, padded weapon, or latex weapon, is a padded mock weapon used for simulated handheld combat. Such weapons are used in simulated battles called battle gaming and in some live action role-playing games (LARPs).

==Terminology==
In the United States there are four major kinds of foam mock weapons in use in medieval combat sports, battle gaming, and LARPs. They can be defined as:

* &quot;boffer weapons&quot;: The term &quot;boffer&quot; refers to a particular construction of weapon that involves a single piece of PVC pipe, with one layer of pipe foam around it, and covered with duct tape. This type of mock weapon, although it has padding, is not suitable for unarmored high impact fighting. It is commonly used by live action role-playing games where participants must perform touch combat by pulling back on their strikes at the last moment.
* &quot;heavy boffer weapons&quot;: These mock weapons are similar to standard boffer weapons, but they are reinforced on the core pipe with strapping tape. They are used in full power combat with the participants wearing a significant amount of safety equipment (armor). This type of mock weapon is primarily used by the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) in their youth combat program.
* &quot;latex weapons&quot;: Throughout Europe, almost all modern sword-fighting games use molded foam swords of latex rubber. These weapons are often airbrush painted with a slick latex covering. The weapons are only lightly padded and require players to use only touch contact and pull back on their blows before striking. The weapons have little support at the tip and do not lend themselves to thrusting. These mock weapons are starting to be used in United States LARP games.
* &quot;padded weapons&quot;: The padded weapon sometimes just called the &quot;foam weapon&quot; is the creation of the American battle gaming movement. Padded weapons typically have at least twice the padding found in traditional boffer weapons. They also tend to be lighter than traditional PVC boffers as they are almost always built on fiberglass or carbon fiber cores. All striking surfaces are covered with cloth to prevent the weapon from scratching uncovered skin. The combination of more padding, lighter weight, and cloth covering make these weapons ideal for the unrestrained fighting that is found in most American battle gaming groups (Amtgard, Belegarth Medieval Combat Society, Dagorhir, Darkon Wargaming Club, and High Fantasy Society). 

In Europe and the UK, the terms &quot;latex weapon&quot; and &quot;LARP-safe weapon&quot; are more common, and combat is usually referred to as &quot;LARP combat&quot;. Non-latex foam weapons are primarily used in Jugger and in the Finnish LARP community.

==Boffer weapon construction==

The primary concern in designing a foam weapon is safety; a pulled blow with a foam weapon should not hurt the target, and in systems that allow it, even a full-strength blow should not cause injury. Combatants who consistently fail to pull their blows are liable to be ejected from an event, or at least pulled out of the fighting for safety reasons. The weapon should be durable, to withstand the stresses of combat.

A secondary issue is aesthetics; often, a foam weapon is designed to look something like a real weapon such as a sword or an axe, sometimes with detailed adornment. The weighting and balance of a foam weapon can also affect how easy it is to use in combat.

Normally there are several main features of a foam weapon: A core, padding, thrusting tips, various forms of functional and artistic flourishes, and an outer coating or shell.

===Core===

The most important piece of a foam weapon is its core, which acts as the shaft of the weapon and gives it its initial shape. Cores made out of PVC, graphite, fiberglass, carbon fiber, bamboo or aluminium are used, with standards varying between groups and countries. Graphite golf club shafts and PVC tubes are presently the cores most commonly used in the United States, whereas solid fiberglass or carbon fibre rods are the cores most commonly used in Europe.

Some core materials can be bent into a number of shapes to give variety and uniqueness to a weapon. A common way to bend a PVC core is with a blow torch or kitchen stove; however, heat guns or boiling water are preferred by some as these methods deliver even heat, to prevent burning or weakening of the core. Rattan is generally soaked in water and then moulded to fit a shape.

Some groups wrap tape around the core as reinforcement and to limit damage should the core break.

===Padding===

Once a core is decided upon, a layer of foam padding is glued around it. Sometimes a core is inserted into a pool noodle, either full length or cut into smaller pieces, which makes a firm, yet safe coating for the weapon. Sometimes pipe insulation is used. The general convention of most modern groups is that there must be at least one layer of stiff closed-cell foam for safety reasons. Some groups differ on the thickness required and this mainly stems from issues of safety and control. Some full-contact groups require more padding on striking surfaces.

===Thrusting tip===
Some foam weapons also feature a tip made of open cell foam or other foam types that allow a progressive give, which is often much softer and more compressible than the foam on the core. This allows for a wielder to execute a thrust on their opponent without fear of skewering them on the core or leaving bruises.

Most groups in Europe and the UK do not allow thrusting even if the weapon has a thrusting tip, due to concerns on the safety of such weapons. However, thrusting tips are much more popular in the United States where practitioners ensure that any weapons that risk the core piercing through the thrusting tip and into a combatant are failed in safety checks held before every game.

Depending on which set of rules are being used, the pommel of the foam weapon may also have a thrusting tip for striking with the bottom of the weapon. The thrusting tip at the bottom of the pommel is commonly referred to as a waylay tip, as its purpose is to be used to strike between the shoulder blades, simulating an assailant waylaying a victim. Even without this tactic, having a padded pommel is a common safety precaution as it provides added protection against accidents.

===Flourishes===

Once padding and thrusting tips are secured on the core, it is not unusual for the weapon to have added flourishes for aesthetic and practical purposes. If the foam weapon is to be an axe, a head carved out of open-cell foam may be affixed. Additional layers of closed-cell foam can be used to define a blade of a sword, the hilt of a dagger, or the soft foam &quot;spikes&quot; of a club. Foam weatherstripping is commonly used to better define a &quot;cutting blade&quot; as opposed to electrical tape. Flourishes allow for a great deal of artistic expression.

===Coating or shell===
The weapon is then covered with either tape (such as kite tape, gaffer tape, etc.), cloth or several layers of rubberised coating (such as latex) to protect the foam from abrasion and tearing.

One method within United States conventions involves a simple coating of duct tape to hold the outer foam together. The tape itself is used in many places to shape the foam and pull it into place, allowing for the artist to &quot;carve&quot; the weapon out as they work. Duct tape weapons also allow for easy repair of punctures by simply smoothing the shell out and applying a small patch of duct tape to the hole. Additionally, some United States groups use a cloth covering or opaque tights instead of duct tape. This practice is gaining almost universal acceptance with most groups moving to these systems.

Within European and Australian conventions, latex or rubberized coatings are generally considered the standard. Latex coating allows for levels of detailing and artistry through such techniques as appliqué moulds, and isoflex finishes with detail airbrushing. Some specimens are so stunning that, at first glance, they are difficult to tell apart from actual metal weapons. Latex weapons, however, are much more expensive (to both purchase and repair), and generally have a stiffer give on impact.

When solid coatings are applied over thrusting tips, many holes must be poked through them to allow the foam to deflate and re-inflate upon impact. This is generally not needed when coatings such as cloth are used, as air can pass freely through such media.

==Padded weapon construction==

===Core===
Padded weapons are typically built on similar cores as listed for the boffer weapon, but some groups such as Markland use rattan cores.

===Padding===
Unlike boffer weapons, padded weapons are used in full force striking and therefore need more padding. For most American battle gaming organizations the rules specify approximately one inch of padding on the striking surface of any weapon under 24 ounces in weight. For weapons over 24 ounces in weight the padding requirement typically is increased to about one and one half inch of closed cell foam.

Most padded weapons are either formed using round (omni) blades such as pool noodles, or flat rectangular blades from layers of sheet foam. Adhesives such as contact cement, spray glue, or carpet tape are typically used to hold foam layers together.

===Thrusting tip===
Padded weapons used in American-style battle gaming are often used with full force blows. The thrusting tips must be elastic and compressible. The foam should be open cell of a density greater than or equal to 2.3 lbs per square inch. In addition, between the core and the thrusting tip there should be placed a ridged punch protector consisting of either a pipe end cap or small plastic or leather disk. The end of the core should also be covered or surrounded by a rip-resistant material such as a tightly taped small foam box, a layer of strong mesh tape, or some yoga matt that will prevent the core (which will whip back and forth) from sliding around the punch protector.
===Flourishes===
For safety all parts of the hilt (including pommels and guard) of the weapon should not easily fit through a two-inch hole. This allows the weapon to be used in unhelmeted combat without significant risk of causing eye injury.

===Covering===
To prevent skin abrasion from full contact strikes, all padded weapons must have cloth covers over all striking surfaces.

==Variations==

Rules for constructing foam weapons vary a great deal from group to group as foam weapon fighting groups are usually small and tend to operate independently of each other. Foam weapon fighting groups also differ on the allowed weight, size, flexibility, thickness of foam, length of thrusting tip, and type of materials that may be used as a core. As a result, those who are into the sport, whether as a form of freestyle martial arts or within the context of LARPing, are generally encouraged to check with the rules of group with whom they plan to participate, so not to bear the pain of disassembling and re-assembling a new weapon to make it in compliance with local standards.

==Usage==

===LARP props===
Boffer weapons are commonly used as props in live action role-playing games. While designed with safety in mind, these weapons tend to undergo more relaxed safety inspections as the fighters are usually not expected to use full-force blows.

===Medieval combat sports===
Foam weapons may also be used in fights more akin to martial arts tournaments, which resemble historical reenactment combat but require less protective gear. The scale of such tournaments may vary from individual duels to battles with hundreds of participants. Foam weapons are also used in some sport-like battle games such as Jugger.

===Home use===
Boffers are also made by individuals for use at home for fighting amongst friends and family. Typically these will be made without reference to the design standards of any LARP group.

<text>TPoint is computer software that implements a mathematical model of conditions leading to errors in telescope pointing and tracking. The model can then be used in a telescope control system to correct the pointing and tracking. Such errors are typically caused by mechanical or structural . For example, TPoint can analyze and compensate for systematic errors such as polar misalignment, mechanical and optical non-orthogonality, lack of roundness in telescope mounting drive gears, as well as for flexure of the mounting caused by gravity.

TPoint is in use on the majority of professional telescopes worldwide, including among many others the Anglo-Australian Telescope, Keck Observatory, Gemini Observatory and the Large Binocular Telescope. It has significantly improved the performance and efficiency of telescope operation and has had an especially strong impact on the development of automated and robotic telescopes. 

TPoint is also widely used by amateur astronomers. Software Bisque distributes TPoint as an add-on to TheSkyX Serious Astronomer Edition and TheSkyX Professional; this version is used to improve the pointing on amateur telescopes.
==History==
TPoint was invented and developed by Patrick Wallace. It grew out of work he and John Straede performed
at the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) between 1974 and 1980
using Interdata 70 computers. In the early 1980s, it was ported to the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX running under
the VMS operating system and between 1990 and 1992 was also ported to run on the PC/MS-DOS platform as well
as various UNIX platforms. A TPoint add-on is available for TheSkyX Serious Astronomer Edition and TheSkyX Professional Edition from Software Bisque, and it runs under Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows.

<text>Moving Shadow is an English breakbeat hardcore, jungle and drum and bass record label which was founded in 1990 by Rob Playford.

== History ==
The label began in 1990, operating from Playford&#x27;s Stevenage home. Playford had become a focal point for local, young artists and bedroom producers seeking advice on releasing their own music following his first three 12 inch vinyl releases.

The label&#x27;s first release with a &#x27;Shadow&#x27; prefixed catalogue number came in 1991; the &quot;Psychotronic EP&quot; by Earth Leakage Trip. Many artists attributed to early Shadow releases were Playford&#x27;s aliases or collaborations, such as 2 Bad Mice, a group he formed with Sean O&#x27;Keeffe and Simon Colebrooke.

As the rave scene scratched the surface of the mainstream music industry in 1991 and 1992, Moving Shadow, like its friendly rival Suburban Base and D-Zone, enjoyed some UK Singles Chart success through Blame&#x27;s &quot;Music Takes You&quot; and 2 Bad Mice&#x27;s &quot;Bombscare&quot;.

Moving Shadow&#x27;s output could be seen at this time to represent the complete spectrum of the genre. The label released albums from both Omni Trio and Foul Play in 1995 and the first of a series of regional compilation albums such as &quot;The Revolutionary Generation&quot;, &quot;Storm from the East&quot; and &quot;Trans-Central Connection&quot;, highlighting artists both local and distantly-located.

In 1994, Playford began working with drum and bass artist Goldie on tracks written using his Rufige Kru alias, after Goldie made contact with Playford about appearing in a documentary he was making. The result was Goldie&#x27;s &quot;Timeless&quot; album, produced and engineered by Playford and released in 1995 on the better-funded FFRR Records. The album was one of the first drum and bass titles to achieve mainstream success, going on to be one of the best-selling drum and bass albums of its time.

In 2000, Moving Shadow published a retrospective of their catalogue to date.

Many songs from artists of the label were featured in the 2005 Rockstar Games racing videogame &quot;Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition&quot;.

The label stopped releasing new artist material in 2006. A digital only release of previously unreleased tracks and versions, &quot;Cut Out Shapes&quot; by &quot;Omni Trio” was released in 2012.

In 2023, Moving Shadow expanded its list of the digital sales platforms servicing its catalogue from Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store (since 2006) and Beatport (since 2008) to include other download and streaming platforms of the day as well as its own YouTube channel. As of May 2023, the entire Moving Shadow back catalogue is accessible on Spotify. 

== Special Release Series&#x27; ==
The &quot;Two on One” series was a collection of specially commissioned tracks spread over 9 (12 inch vinyl) releases. Each release featured a guest artist (not signed to the label) on one side of the vinyl and a Moving Shadow artist on the other. The artwork design was split over the 9 releases so as to create one large 3’ x 3&#x27; image. Released 7 February 1994 - 26 December 1994.

The &quot;10” series was a limited edition retrospective of the label&#x27;s popular tracks to date. Released 11 September 2000 - 14 May 2001.

The &quot;MSXEP” series was a collection of double 12 inch vinyl releases featuring new artist and existing Moving Shadow artists alike. Released 3 January 2000 - 20 March 2006.

<text>Helminthiasis, also known as worm infection, is any macroparasitic disease of humans and other animals in which a part of the body is infected with parasitic worms, known as helminths. There are numerous species of these parasites, which are broadly classified into tapeworms, flukes, and roundworms. They often live in the gastrointestinal tract of their hosts, but they may also burrow into other organs, where they induce physiological damage.

Soil-transmitted helminthiasis and schistosomiasis are the most important helminthiases, and are among the neglected tropical diseases. These group of helminthiases have been targeted under the joint action of the world&#x27;s leading pharmaceutical companies and non-governmental organizations through a project launched in 2012 called the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, which aimed to control or eradicate certain neglected tropical diseases by 2020.

Helminthiasis has been found to result in poor birth outcome, poor cognitive development, poor school and work performance, poor socioeconomic development, and poverty. Chronic illness, malnutrition, and anemia are further examples of secondary effects.

Soil-transmitted helminthiases are responsible for parasitic infections in as much as a quarter of the human population worldwide. One well-known example of soil-transmitted helminthiases is ascariasis.
==Types of parasitic helminths==

Of all the known helminth species, the most important helminths with respect to understanding their transmission pathways, their control, inactivation and enumeration in samples of human excreta from dried feces, faecal sludge, wastewater, and sewage sludge are:
* soil-transmitted helminths, including &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot; (the most common worldwide), &quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot;, &quot;Necator americanus&quot;, &quot;Strongyloides stercoralis&quot; and &quot;Ancylostoma duodenale&quot;
* &quot;Hymenolepis nana&quot;
* &quot;Taenia saginata&quot;
* &quot;Enterobius&quot;
* &quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot;
* &quot;Schistosoma mansoni&quot;
* &quot;Toxocara canis&quot;
* &quot;Toxocara cati&quot;

Helminthiases are classified as follows (the disease names end with &quot;-sis&quot; and the causative worms are in brackets):

===Roundworm infection (nematodiasis)===
* Filariasis (&quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot;, &quot;Brugia malayi&quot; infection)
* Onchocerciasis (&quot;Onchocerca volvulus&quot; infection)
* Soil-transmitted helminthiasis – this includes ascariasis (&quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot; infection), trichuriasis (&quot;Trichuris&quot; infection), and hookworm infection (includes necatoriasis and &quot;Ancylostoma duodenale&quot; infection)
* Trichostrongyliasis (&quot;Trichostrongylus&quot; spp. infection)
* Dracunculiasis (guinea worm infection)
* Baylisascaris (raccoon roundworm, may be transmitted to pets, livestock, and humans)

===Tapeworm infection (cestodiasis)===
* Echinococcosis (&quot;Echinococcus&quot; infection)
* Hymenolepiasis (&quot;Hymenolepis&quot; infection)
* Taeniasis/cysticercosis (&quot;Taenia&quot; infection)
* Coenurosis (&quot;T. multiceps&quot;, &quot;T. serialis&quot;, &quot;T. glomerata&quot;, and &quot;T. brauni&quot; infection)

===Trematode infection (trematodiasis)===
* Amphistomiasis (amphistomes infection)
* Clonorchiasis (&quot;Clonorchis sinensis&quot; infection)
* Fascioliasis (&quot;Fasciola&quot; infection)
* Fasciolopsiasis (&quot;Fasciolopsis buski&quot; infection)
* Opisthorchiasis (&quot;Opisthorchis&quot; infection)
* Paragonimiasis (&quot;Paragonimus&quot; infection)
* Schistosomiasis/bilharziasis (&quot;Schistosoma&quot; infection)

===Acanthocephala infection===
* &quot;Moniliformis&quot; infection

==Signs and symptoms==

The signs and symptoms of helminthiasis depend on a number of factors including: the site of the infestation within the body; the type of worm involved; the number of worms and their volume; the type of damage the infesting worms cause; and, the immunological response of the body. Where the burden of parasites in the body is light, there may be no symptoms.

Certain worms may cause particular constellations of symptoms. For instance, taeniasis can lead to seizures due to neurocysticercosis.

===Mass and volume===
In extreme cases of intestinal infestation, the mass and volume of the worms may cause the outer layers of the intestinal wall, such as the muscular layer, to tear. This may lead to peritonitis, volvulus, and gangrene of the intestine.

===Immunological response===
As pathogens in the body, helminths induce an immune response. Immune-mediated inflammatory changes occur in the skin, lung, liver, intestine, central nervous system, and eyes. Signs of the body&#x27;s immune response may include eosinophilia, edema, and arthritis. An example of the immune response is the hypersensitivity reaction that may lead to anaphylaxis. Another example is the migration of &quot;Ascaris&quot; larvae through the bronchi of the lungs causing asthma.

===Secondary effects===

====Immune changes====
In humans, T helper cells and eosinophils respond to helminth infestation. It is well established that T helper 2 cells are the central players of protective immunity to helminths, while the roles for B cells and antibodies are context-dependent. Inflammation leads to encapsulation of egg deposits throughout the body. Helminths excrete into the intestine toxic substances after they feed. These substances then enter the circulatory and lymphatic systems of the host body.

Chronic immune responses to helminthiasis may lead to increased susceptibility to other infections such as tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria. There is conflicting information about whether deworming reduces HIV progression and viral load and increases CD4 counts in antiretroviral naive and experienced individuals, although the most recent Cochrane review found some evidence that this approach might have favorable effects. Helminth infection also lowers the immune responses to vaccination for other diseases such as BCG, measles, and Hepatitis B.

==== Chronic illness ====
Chronic helminthiasis may cause severe morbidity. Helminthiasis has been found to result in poor birth outcome, poor cognitive development, poor school and work performance, decreased productivity, poor socioeconomic development, and poverty.

====Malnutrition====
Helminthiasis may cause chronic illness through malnutrition including vitamin deficiencies, stunted growth, anemia, and protein-energy malnutrition. Worms compete directly with their hosts for nutrients, but the magnitude of this effect is likely minimal as the nutritional requirements of worms is relatively small. In pigs and humans, &quot;Ascaris&quot; has been linked to lactose intolerance and vitamin A, amino acid, and fat malabsorption. Impaired nutrient uptake may result from direct damage to the intestinal mucosal wall or from more subtle changes such as chemical imbalances and changes in gut flora. Alternatively, the worms’ release of protease inhibitors to defend against the body&#x27;s digestive processes may impair the breakdown of other nutrients. In addition, worm induced diarrhoea may shorten gut transit time, thus reducing absorption of nutrients.

Malnutrition due to worms can give rise to anorexia. A study of 459 children in Zanzibar revealed spontaneous increases in appetite after deworming. Anorexia might be a result of the body&#x27;s immune response and the stress of combating infection. Specifically, some of the cytokines released in the immune response to worm infestation have been linked to anorexia in animals.

====Anemia====
Helminths may cause iron-deficiency anemia. This is most severe in heavy hookworm infections, as &quot;Necator americanus&quot; and &quot;Ancylostoma duodenale&quot; feed directly on the blood of their hosts. Although the daily consumption of an individual worm (0.02–0.07 ml and 0.14–0.26 ml respectively) is small, the collective consumption under heavy infection can be clinically significant. Intestinal whipworm may also cause anemia. Anemia has also been associated with reduced stamina for physical labor, a decline in the ability to learn new information, and apathy, irritability, and fatigue. A study of the effect of deworming and iron supplementation in 47 students from the Democratic Republic of the Congo found that the intervention improved cognitive function. Another study found that in 159 Jamaican schoolchildren, deworming led to better auditory short-term memory and scanning and retrieval of long-term memory over a period of nine-weeks.

====Cognitive changes====
Malnutrition due to helminths may affect cognitive function leading to low educational performance, decreased concentration and difficulty with abstract cognitive tasks. Iron deficiency in infants and preschoolers is associated with &quot;lower scores ... on tests of mental and motor development ... [as well as] increased fearfulness, inattentiveness, and decreased social responsiveness&quot;. Studies in the Philippines and Indonesia found a significant correlation between helminthiasis and decreased memory and fluency. Large parasite burdens, particularly severe hookworm infections, are also associated with absenteeism, under-enrollment, and attrition in school children.

==Transmission==
Helminths are transmitted to the final host in several ways. The most common infection is through ingestion of contaminated vegetables, drinking water, and raw or undercooked meat. Contaminated food may contain eggs of nematodes such as &quot;Ascaris&quot;, &quot;Enterobius&quot;, and &quot;Trichuris&quot;; cestodes such as &quot;Taenia&quot;, &quot;Hymenolepis&quot;, and &quot;Echinococcus&quot;; and trematodes such as &quot;Fasciola&quot;. Raw or undercooked meats are the major sources of &quot;Taenia&quot; (pork, beef and venison), &quot;Trichinella&quot; (pork and bear), &quot;Diphyllobothrium&quot; (fish), &quot;Clonorchis&quot; (fish), and &quot;Paragonimus&quot; (crustaceans). Schistosomes and nematodes such as hookworms (&quot;Ancylostoma&quot; and &quot;Necator&quot;) and &quot;Strongyloides&quot; can penetrate the skin directly.

The roundworm, &quot;Dracunculus&quot; has a complex mode of transmission: it is acquired from drinking infested water or eating frogs and fish that contain (had eaten) infected crustaceans (copepods); and can also be transmitted from infected pets (cats and dogs). Roundworms such as &quot;Brugia&quot;, &quot;Wuchereria and&quot; &quot;Onchocerca&quot; are directly transmitted by mosquitoes. In the developing world, the use of contaminated water is a major risk factor for infection. Infection can also take place through the practice of geophagy, which is not uncommon in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Soil is eaten, for example, by children or pregnant women to counteract a real or perceived deficiency of minerals in their diet.

==Diagnosis==
Specific helminths can be identified through microscopic examination of their eggs (ova) found in faecal samples. The number of eggs is measured in units of eggs per gram. However, it does not quantify mixed infections, and in practice, is inaccurate for quantifying the eggs of schistosomes and soil-transmitted helminths. Sophisticated tests such as serological assays, antigen tests, and molecular diagnosis are also available; however, they are time-consuming, expensive and not always reliable.

==Prevention==
Disrupting the cycle of the worm will prevent infestation and re-infestation. Prevention of infection can largely be achieved by addressing the issues of WASH—water, sanitation and hygiene. The reduction of open defecation is particularly called for, as is stopping the use of human waste as fertilizer.

Further preventive measures include adherence to appropriate food hygiene, wearing of shoes, regular deworming of pets, and the proper disposal of their feces.

Scientists are also searching for a vaccine against helminths, such as a hookworm vaccine.

==Treatment==

=== Medications ===

Broad-spectrum benzimidazoles (such as albendazole and mebendazole) are the first line treatment of intestinal roundworm and tapeworm infections. Macrocyclic lactones (such as ivermectin) are effective against adult and migrating larval stages of nematodes. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for schistosomiasis, taeniasis, and most types of food-borne trematodiases. Oxamniquine is also widely used in mass deworming programmes. Pyrantel is commonly used for veterinary nematodiasis. Artemisinins and derivatives are proving to be candidates as drugs of choice for trematodiasis.

=== Mass deworming ===

In regions where helminthiasis is common, mass deworming treatments may be performed, particularly among school-age children, who are a high-risk group. Most of these initiatives are undertaken by the World Health Organization (WHO) with positive outcomes in many regions. Deworming programs can improve school attendance by 25 percent. Although deworming improves the health of an individual, outcomes from mass deworming campaigns, such as reduced deaths or increases in cognitive ability, nutritional benefits, physical growth, and performance, are uncertain or not apparent.

=== Surgery ===

If complications of helminthiasis, such as intestinal obstruction occur, emergency surgery may be required. Patients who require non-emergency surgery, for instance for removal of worms from the biliary tree, can be pre-treated with the anthelmintic drug albendazole.

==Epidemiology==
Areas with the highest prevalence of helminthiasis are tropical and subtropical areas including sub-Saharan Africa, central and east Asia, and the Americas.

=== Neglected tropical diseases ===
Some types of helminthiases are classified as neglected tropical diseases. They include:
* Soil-transmitted helminthiases
* Roundworm infections such as lymphatic filariasis, dracunculiasis, and onchocerciasis
* Trematode infections, such as schistosomiasis, and food-borne trematodiases, including fascioliasis, clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis, and paragonimiasis
* Tapeworm infections such as cysticercosis, taeniasis, and echinococcosis

=== Prevalence ===
The soil-transmitted helminths (&quot;A. lumbricoides&quot;, &quot;T. trichiura&quot;, &quot;N. americanus&quot;, &quot;A. duodenale)&quot;, schistosomes, and filarial worms collectively infect more than a quarter of the human population worldwide at any one time, far surpassing HIV and malaria together. Schistosomiasis is the second most prevalent parasitic disease of humans after malaria.

In 2014–15, the WHO estimated that approximately 2 billion people were infected with soil-transmitted helminthiases, 249 million with schistosomiasis, 56 million people with food-borne trematodiasis, 120 million with lymphatic filariasis, 37 million people with onchocerciasis, and 1 million people with echinococcosis. Another source estimated a much higher figure of 3.5 billion infected with one or more soil-transmitted helminths.

In 2014, only 148 people were reported to have dracunculiasis because of a successful eradication campaign for that particular helminth, which is easier to eradicate than other helminths as it is transmitted only by drinking contaminated water.

Because of their high mobility and lower standards of hygiene, school-age children are particularly vulnerable to helminthiasis. Most children from developing nations will have at least one infestation. Multi-species infections are very common.

The most common intestinal parasites in the United States are &quot;Enterobius vermicularis&quot;, &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot;, &quot;Ancylostoma duodenale&quot;, &quot;Necator americanus&quot;, and &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;.

In a developing country like Bangladesh, the most common species are round worm (&quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot;), whipworm (Tricurias tricuras) and hookworm
(Ancylostoma duodenalis).

=== Variations within communities ===
Even in areas of high prevalence, the frequency and severity of infection is not uniform within communities or families. A small proportion of community members harbour the majority of worms, and this depends on age. The maximum worm burden is at five to ten years of age, declining rapidly thereafter. Individual predisposition to helminthiasis for people with the same sanitation infrastructure and hygiene behavior is thought to result from differing immunocompetence, nutritional status, and genetic factors. Because individuals are predisposed to a high or a low worm burden, the burden reacquired after successful treatment is proportional to that before treatment.

=== Disability-adjusted life years ===
It is estimated that intestinal nematode infections cause 5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYS) to be lost, of which hookworm infections account for more than 3 million DALYS and ascaris infections more than 1 million. There are also signs of progress: The Global Burden of Disease Study published in 2015 estimates a 46 percent (59 percent when age standardised) reduction in years lived with disability (YLD) for the 13-year time period from 1990 to 2013 for all intestinal/nematode infections, and even a 74 percent (80 percent when age standardised) reduction in YLD from ascariasis.

===Deaths===
As many as 135,000 die annually from soil transmitted helminthiasis.

The 1990–2013 Global Burden of Disease Study estimated 5,500 direct deaths from schistosomiasis, while more than 200,000 people were estimated in 2013 to die annually from causes related to schistosomiasis. Another 20 million have severe consequences from the disease. It is the most deadly of the neglected tropical diseases.

<text>The Electric Telegraph Company (ETC) was a British telegraph company founded in 1846 by William Fothergill Cooke and John Ricardo. It was the world&#x27;s first public telegraph company. The equipment used was the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph, an electrical telegraph developed a few years earlier in collaboration with Charles Wheatstone. The system had been taken up by several railway companies for signalling purposes, but in forming the company Cooke intended to open up the technology to the public at large.

The ETC had a monopoly of electrical telegraphy until the formation of the Magnetic Telegraph Company (commonly called the &quot;Magnetic&quot;) who used a different system which did not infringe the ETC&#x27;s patents. The Magnetic became the chief rival of the ETC and the two of them dominated the market even after further companies entered the field.

The ETC was heavily involved in laying submarine telegraph cables, including lines to the Netherlands, Ireland, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man. It operated the world&#x27;s first specialised cable-laying ship, the &quot;Monarch&quot;. A private line was laid for Queen Victoria on the Isle of Wight. The company was nationalised in 1870 along with other British telegraph companies, and its assets were taken over by the General Post Office.

== Formation ==
The Electric Telegraph Company was the world&#x27;s first public telegraph company, founded in the United Kingdom by Sir William Fothergill Cooke and John Lewis Ricardo, MP for Stoke-on-Trent, with Cromwell F. Varley as chief engineer. It was incorporated by the Electric Telegraph Company&#x27;s Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. xlvi). Its headquarters was in Founders Court, Lothbury, behind the Bank of England. This was the first company formed for the specific purpose of providing a telegraph service to the public. Besides Cooke and Ricardo, the original shareholders were railway engineer George Parker Bidder with the largest holding, Benjamin Hawes, Thomas Boulton, and three other members of the Ricardo family; Samson, Albert, and Frederick.

Up to this point telegraph lines had been laid mostly in conjunction with railway companies, and Cooke had been a leading figure in convincing them of its benefits. However, these systems were all for the exclusive use of the railway company concerned, mostly for signalling purposes, until 1843 when Cooke extended the Great Western Railway&#x27;s telegraph on to Slough at his own expense, at which point he acquired the right to open it to the public. Railway telegraphy continued to be an important part of the company&#x27;s business with expenditure on the railways peaking in 1847–48. This focus on the railways was reflected in the directors and major shareholders being dominated by people associated with railway construction. Additional railway people who had become involved by 1849 included Samuel Morton Peto, Thomas Brassey, Robert Stephenson (of &quot;Rocket&quot; fame and who was chairman of the company in 1857–58), Joseph Paxton, and Richard Till, a director of several railway companies.

The collaboration between Cooke and Charles Wheatstone in developing the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph was not a happy one, degenerating into a bitter dispute over who had invented the telegraph. As a result, the company was formed without Wheatstone (although he claimed he had been offered the post of scientific adviser). At creation the company purchased all the patents Cooke and Wheatstone had obtained to date in building the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph. It also obtained the important patent for the electric relay from Edward Davy for £600. The relay allowed telegraph signals weakened over a long distance to be renewed and retransmitted onward.

== Early years ==
The company was not immediately hugely profitable, and shares were more or less worthless. In 1846 it won a concession from Belgium for telegraph lines covering the whole country. The company installed a line from Brussels to Antwerp but the traffic was light (mainly stock exchange business) and the company decided to return its concession to the Belgian Government in 1850. In 1848, after a dispute with the Great Western over an engine the ETC was alleged to have damaged, the telegraph line from Paddington to Slough was removed, although the railway company continued to use the telegraph at the Box Tunnel.

The setback with the Great Western did not slow the growth of the telegraph along railway lines, and these continued to be the main source of revenue. By 1848 the company had telegraph lines along half of the railway lines then open, some 1,800 miles, and continued to make deals with more railway companies after that. These included in 1851 a new contract with Great Western which was extending its line to Exeter and Plymouth and by 1852 the ETC had installed a line that ran from London, past Slough, as far as Bristol. These contracts usually gave the company exclusive rights to install telegraph lines. This gave the company a significant advantage over competitors when other companies entered the market.

Other areas of growth were in the supply of news to newspapers, and contracts with stock exchanges. However, general use by the public was retarded by the high cost of sending a message. By 1855 this situation was changing. The ETC now had over 5,200 miles of line and sent nearly three-quarters of a million messages that year. The growth, together with competitors coming on to the market, drove down prices. ETC&#x27;s maximum charge for an inland telegram (over 100 miles) fell from ten shillings in 1851 to four shillings in 1855.

By 1859, growth required the company to relocate its London central office to Great Bell Alley, Moorgate, but retaining the Founders Court site as a public office. The Moorgate office was arranged over three floors and a large number of men and boys were recruited on an accelerating rate of pay. The company also employed a significant number of women from a higher social class as telegraphists operating the Wheatstone needle instruments. They were paid less and they had to leave if they married. A notable early employee was Maria Craig who became a supervisor. The portion of Great Bell Alley east of Moorgate Street was later renamed Telegraph Street in recognition of the importance of the company at 11–14 Telegraph Street. The site is now occupied by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; pub.

== Government reserved powers ==
In the act of Parliament establishing the company, the Electric Telegraph Company&#x27;s Act 1846, the government reserved the right to take over the resources of the ETC in times of national emergency. It did this in 1848 in response to Chartist agitation. Chartism was a working-class movement for democratic reform. One of the main aims was to achieve the vote for all men over twenty-one. In April 1848, the Chartists organised a large demonstration at Kennington Common and presented a petition signed by millions. The government, fearing an insurrection, used its control of the ETC telegraph to disrupt Chartist communication.

== Competitors ==
The first competitor to emerge was the British Electric Telegraph Company (BETC), formed in 1849 by Henry Highton and his brother Edward. The ETC had a policy of suppressing competitors by buying up rival patents. This it had done to Highton when he patented a gold-leaf telegraph instrument. However, Highton now proposed a telegraph with a different system. Even worse for the ETC, in 1850 Parliament passed an Act giving it the right to force the railways to allow the BETC to construct a telegraph for government use between Liverpool and London. The ETC tried to oppose the government Bill but without success.

A more serious rival came in 1851 with the formation of the English and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company (later renamed the British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company and usually just called the &quot;Magnetic&quot;). The Magnetic also used a non-infringing system, generating the telegraph pulses electromagnetically by the operator&#x27;s own motion of working the equipment handles. The Magnetic got around the ETC&#x27;s dominance of rail wayleaves by using buried cables along highways, a problem that had hindered the BETC and eventually led to its takeover by the Magnetic. Further, it had an exclusive agreement with the Submarine Telegraph Company who had laid the first cable to France and was busily laying more cables to other continental countries. The Magnetic also beat the ETC in getting the first cable to Ireland in 1853. For a while then, the Magnetic had shut the ETC out of international business. The ETC was keen to correct this situation and started laying its own submarine cables.

Other companies came on to the market, but ETC remained by far the largest of them with the Magnetic second. The ETC and the Magnetic so dominated the market that they were virtually a duopoly until nationalisation.

== Submarine cables ==
The Electric Telegraph Company merged with the International Telegraph Company (ITC) in 1854 to become the Electric and International Telegraph Company. The International Telegraph Company had been formed in 1853 for the purpose of establishing a telegraph connection to the Netherlands between Orfordness and Scheveningen using submarine telegraph cables. The concession to lay the cables had originally been granted to the ETC, but the Dutch government objected to the ETC laying landlines on its territory so a separate company, the ITC, was set up to do this. In practice, the ITC was run by ETC staff. It planned to lay four separate cable cores as a diversity scheme against damage from anchors and fishing gear. All four were combined into a single cable in the sea a short distance from landing. The work was begun in 1853 with the ship &quot;Monarch&quot;, specially purchased and fitted out for the purpose, and completed in 1854. The cable proved to need a great deal of maintenance and was replaced in 1858 by a single, heavier cable made by Glass, Elliot &amp; Co and laid by &quot;William Cory&quot;.

=== &quot;Monarch&quot; ===

The &quot;Monarch&quot; was the first ship to be permanently fitted out as a cable ship and operated on a full-time basis by a cable company, although the fitting out for the Netherlands cables was considered temporary. She was a paddle steamer built in 1830 at Thornton-on-Tees with a 130 hp engine. She was the first of a series of cable ships named &quot;Monarch&quot;.

The cable laying equipment of &quot;Monarch&quot; was a major step forward compared to the unspecialised ships that had previously been used for cable laying, with sheaves to run the cable out of the hold and a powerful dedicated brake to control the cable running out. However, &quot;Monarch&quot; did not store the cable in water-filled tanks as was done on future cable ships. The ship could not, therefore, be kept in trim by replacing the cable with water as it was payed out. It was necessary to run out coils of cable alternately from the fore hold and the main hold for this reason.

Besides the cables to the Netherlands, &quot;Monarch&quot; laid several cables around Britain in its first year. One of these was a cable across the Solent to the Isle of Wight. The purpose of this cable was to provide a connection to Osborne House, the summer residence of Queen Victoria.

A number of improvements were made to &quot;Monarch&quot; over the years and its gear became the prototype for future cable ships. A cable picking-up machine was soon fitted with a drum that could be driven by both steam engine and manual winching, designed by the company engineer, Frederick Charles Webb. In 1857, draw-off gear was fitted to avoid crew having to hold the cable taught by hand, and water-cooled brakes were fitted in 1863.

The ship was frequently chartered to other companies like the Submarine Telegraph Company and the Magnetic for cable work. The first charter was to R.S. Newall and Company to recover an abandoned cable in the Irish Sea. Newall had made this cable for the Magnetic and a failed attempt to lay it from Portpatrick in Scotland to Donaghadee in Ireland was made in 1852. Newall temporarily installed its own picking-up machine as Webb&#x27;s had not yet been fitted.

After nationalisation in 1870, &quot;Monarch&quot; irreparably broke down on her first cable mission for the General Post Office (GPO). She was then relegated to a coal hulk.

=== Ireland ===
The chief competitor to the company, the Magnetic, had succeeded in providing the first connection to Ireland in 1853 on the Portpatrick–Donaghadee route. The ETC was keen to establish its own connection. In September 1854 &quot;Monarch&quot; attempted to lay a lightweight cable from Holyhead in Wales to Howth in Ireland. This attempt was a failure, as had previous attempts on both routes with lightweight cable. In June 1855 &quot;Monarch&quot; tried again, but this time with a heavier cable made by Newall. This attempt was successful, the cable being to a similar design to the one Newall had made for the successful Magnetic cable.

Another cable was laid to Ireland in 1862, this time from Wexford in Ireland to Abermawr in Wales. The cable was made by Glass, Elliot &amp; Co and laid by &quot;Berwick&quot;.

=== Channel Islands ===
A subsidiary company, the Channel Islands Telegraph Company was formed in 1857 for the purpose of providing telegraph to the Channel Islands of Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney. The main cable was made by Newall and laid by &quot;Elba&quot; between Weymouth and Alderney in August 1858. The cable required numerous repairs due to the rocky coast of Alderney and the tidal race between Portland Bill and the Isle of Portland. The main section was finally abandoned as a maintenance liability shortly after September 1860.

=== Isle of Man ===
A subsidiary company, the Isle of Man Electric Telegraph Company was formed in 1859 for the purpose of providing telegraph to the Isle of Man. The cable was made by Glass, Elliot &amp; Co and laid by &quot;Resolute&quot; from Whitehaven.

== Nationalisation ==
The company was nationalised by the British government in 1870 under the Telegraph Act 1868 along with most other British telegraph companies. The Telegraph Act 1870 extended the 1868 Act to include the Isle of Man Electric Telegraph Company and the Jersey and Guernsey Telegraph Company, but excluded the Submarine Telegraph Company and other companies which exclusively operated international cables.

The Electric Telegraph Company formed the largest component of the resulting state monopoly run by the GPO. In 1969 Post Office Telecommunications was made a distinct department of the Post Office, and in 1981 it was separated entirely from the Post Office as British Telecom. In 1984, British Telecom was privatised and from 1991 traded as BT.

== Equipment ==
The primary system initially used by the company was the two-needle and one-needle Cooke and Wheatstone telegraphs. Needle telegraphs continued to be used throughout the company&#x27;s existence, but printing telegraphs were also in use by the 1850s. From 1867, the ETC started to use the Wheatstone automatic duplex system. This device sent messages at an extremely fast rate from text that had been prerecorded on paper punched tape. Its advantage was that it could make maximum use of a telegraph line. This had a great economic advantage on busy long-distance lines where traffic capacity was limited by the speed of the operator. To increase traffic it would otherwise have been necessary to install expensive additional lines and employ additional operators.

In 1854 the ETC installed a pneumatic tube system between its London central office and the London Stock Exchange using underground pipes. This system was later extended to other major company offices in London. Systems were also installed in Liverpool (1864), Birmingham (1865), and Manchester (1865).

== Historical documents ==
Records of the Electric Telegraph Company (33 volumes), 1846–1872, the International Telegraph Company (5 volumes), 1852–1858 and the Electric and International Telegraph Company (62 volumes), [1852]–1905 are held by BT Archives.

<text>Donald H. Bell (born March 10, 1942) is a Canadian politician. He is currently serving as a councillor for the City of North Vancouver (November 2011 to present). He previously represented the riding of North Vancouver as Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada from 2004 to 2008 as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. Before being elected, he was the mayor of the District of North Vancouver.

Born in New Westminster, British Columbia, Bell was first elected as an alderman in the District of North Vancouver in 1970, and again, topping the polls, in 1972 and 1974. He was elected mayor of the District in 1976, 1978, and 1980. He then voluntarily returned to the private sector for 13 years. In 1986 he revived his political career and was elected for three terms as a school trustee in 1986, 1988 and 1990, serving twice as school board chairman. He then returned to District council, being elected as a municipal councillor in 1993. In 1996 he returned full-time to the mayor&#x27;s chair by acclamation, and was re-elected as mayor in 1999 and 2002.

During the 2004 federal election, and against most pundits&#x27; predictions, he federally won the North Vancouver riding for the Liberals in what had been a strong Conservative seat for 30 years. Bell defeated incumbent MP Ted White who had held the seat for the Reform, Alliance and Conservative parties since 1993. Bell was re-elected to office in the 2006 federal election.

Bell served as BC federal Liberal Caucus Chair, and as Chair of the federal Liberal Northern and Western Caucus, covering the four western provinces and the northern territories. He was a member and vice-chair of the federal Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, and the Liberal opposition critic for the Asia Pacific Gateway.

Bell was defeated in the 2008 election by Conservative Andrew Saxton.

Bell served as Chair of a special City of North Vancouver Civic Engagement Task Force from June 2010 to April 2011.

Bell was elected as City of North Vancouver Councillor, topping the polls in November 2011, for a 3-year term.

In 2014, Bell was re-elected as a City Councillor, for the first time not topping the polls.

In 2018, Bell was re-elected as a City Councillor, returning to the top of the polls.

==Private sector==

Bell was Public Affairs Director for Canada Safeway, based in Vancouver, from 1982 through 1995, when he then returned full-time to local politics as Mayor of the District in 1996.

Following his defeat in the federal election of 2008, he was Product Development Manager for Golden Griffin International Enterprises Inc. from the Fall of 2008 through 2009.

<text>Winer Observatory is an astronomical observatory near Sonoita, Arizona in the United States. It is a private, non-profit observatory, operated by Mark and Pat Trueblood since 1983. It has been the site of a number of significant small telescopes and famous robotic telescopes, including the Iowa Robotic Observatory, Michael Schwartz&#x27;s supernova survey telescope (until Tenagra Observatories opened a facility in the area), and the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope that discovered over 30 exoplanets. It now houses the Iowa telescope, a telescope owned by a university in Poland, and the Sutter Survey telescope owned by asteroid mining company TransAstra.

<text>The New Power Generation, also known as the NPG, was the backing band of musician Prince from 1990 to 2013. They were replaced by 3rdeyegirl as his backing band in 2013. In 2015, the New Power Generation reunited as Prince&#x27;s backing band for his final studio album before his death, &quot;Hit n Run Phase Two&quot;. They reunited once again in 2017 for a US and European tour.

==History==
The phrase &quot;Welcome to the New Power Generation&quot; was mentioned on the opening track of 1988&#x27;s &quot;Lovesexy&quot;. New Power Generation was used for the first time as a band name in the 1990 film &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot;, and a song entitled &quot;New Power Generation&quot; appeared on the accompanying soundtrack album.

The New Power Generation debuted live during the Nude Tour in 1990 and on record on the 1991 album &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot;. The band consisted of holdovers from the Nude Tour: Michael Bland (drums), Levi Seacer, Jr. (guitar), Rosie Gaines (keyboards and backing vocals), Tony M. (lead raps and dancing), Kirk Johnson (percussion and dancing), and Damon Dickson (dancing), along with two new members Tommy Barbarella (keyboards) and Sonny T. (bass). Rosie Gaines left the band after the Diamonds and Pearls Tour and was replaced by keyboardist Morris Hayes.

When Prince began his formal dispute with Warner Bros. and changed his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol in 1993, the NPG became a side-project for Prince, allowing him to release music outside of his contract. 

The NPG&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Goldnigga&quot;, featured Tony M. as lead vocalist/rapper. The album relied heavily on rap, while the music itself was reminiscent of the 1970s funk. Prince participated heavily in writing and performing the music, while Tony wrote and performed raps. Prince provided co-lead vocals on two songs, &quot;Black M.F. in the House&quot; and &quot;Johnny&quot;, and the two were often performed by him in his own concerts and after shows.

A reduced NPG returned to the Prince fold when he began performing under the symbolic moniker in early 1994, backing him on &quot;The Gold Experience&quot;. The rappers and dancers were let go, and Levi Seacer left the band as well. Given an expanded role in the band was dancer Mayte Garcia who provided backing and Spanish vocals. This incarnation released &quot;Exodus&quot; in 1995. Prince again took a role behind the scenes, adopting the guise of the masked &quot;Tora Tora&quot; and performing lead vocals on several tracks, sometimes with an altered voice. His participation in this version of the NPG was much more apparent. Although several raps were recorded for the album, they were left out of the final release, and the focus was more on funk.

In 1996, longstanding members Michael Bland, Tommy Barbarella, and Sonny T. were fired and a new band was formed for touring. Guitarists Kat Dyson and Mike Scott, along with bassist Rhonda Smith joined Morris Hayes and Kirk Johnson, who re-joined the band to play drums.

In 1998, another NPG album was released titled &quot;Newpower Soul&quot; (modifying a song title from &quot;Exodus&quot;). In fact, a spoken outtake from &quot;Exodus&quot; mentions the upcoming album, indicating its planning stages. Prince features prominently on the cover and liner notes and provides lead vocals on all songs. Unlike the two previous releases, the album relies heavily on drum programming by Kirk Johnson and features input from Larry Graham and Doug E. Fresh.

A fourth album, &quot;Peace&quot;, due to be released in 2001, never materialized and although a few songs have been made public through limited-release singles at concerts (&quot;Peace&quot; / &quot;2045: Radical Man&quot; and &quot;The Daisy Chain&quot; / &quot;Gamillah&quot;) and through Prince&#x27;s former official website, NPG Music Club. The songs were later included on the Prince albums &quot;The Slaughterhouse&quot; and &quot;The Chocolate Invasion&quot;.

The band since has been a &quot;revolving door&quot; of musicians, who usually stay for a couple years before being replaced. It is often nebulous as to who is actually an &#x27;official&#x27; member.

In 2010, three former members of the original New Power Generation, drummer Michael Bland, keyboardist Tommy Barbarella and bass player Sonny T., became members of Nick Jonas and the Administration (a side project of Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers).

In 2013, NPG singer Elisa Fiorillo (Dease) formed a duo with Nashville-based guitarist Tyler Reese, called the Dease &amp; Reese Project, and in 2014 released the album &quot;Life in 20&quot; (REMU Records). Fiorillo continued to perform with Prince.

The NPG collaborated with Prince once more in 2015 on what would be his last studio album, &quot;Hit n Run Phase Two&quot;.

After Prince&#x27;s untimely death in 2016, the band reunited in 2017 and 2019 for a US and European Prince tribute tour.

<text>iptables is a user-space utility program that allows a system administrator to configure the IP packet filter rules of the Linux kernel firewall, implemented as different Netfilter modules. The filters are organized in a set of tables, which contain chains of rules for how to treat network traffic packets. Different kernel modules and programs are currently used for different protocols; &quot;iptables&quot; applies to IPv4, &quot;ip6tables&quot; to IPv6, &quot;arptables&quot; to ARP, and &quot;&quot; to Ethernet frames.

iptables requires elevated privileges to operate and must be executed by user root, otherwise it fails to function. On most Linux systems, iptables is installed as and documented in its man pages, which can be opened using codice_1 when installed. It may also be found in codice_2, but since iptables is more like a service rather than an &quot;essential binary&quot;, the preferred location remains .

The term &quot;iptables&quot; is also commonly used to inclusively refer to the kernel-level components. &quot;x_tables&quot; is the name of the kernel module carrying the shared code portion used by all four modules that also provides the API used for extensions; subsequently, &quot;Xtables&quot; is more or less used to refer to the entire firewall (v4, v6, arp, and eb) architecture.

iptables superseded ipchains; and the successor of iptables is nftables, which was released on 19 January 2014 and was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 3.13.

==Overview==
iptables allows the system administrator to define &quot;tables&quot; containing &quot;chains&quot; of &quot;rules&quot; for the treatment of packets. Each table is associated with a different kind of packet processing. Packets are processed by sequentially traversing the rules in chains. A rule in a chain can cause a goto or jump to another chain, and this can be repeated to whatever level of nesting is desired. (A jump is like a “call”, i.e. the point that was jumped from is remembered.) Every network packet arriving at or leaving from the computer traverses at least one chain.

The origin of the packet determines which chain it traverses initially. There are five &quot;predefined chains&quot; (mapping to the five available Netfilter hooks), though a table may not have all chains. Predefined chains have a &quot;policy&quot;, for example DROP, which is applied to the packet if it reaches the end of the chain. The system administrator can create as many other chains as desired. These chains have no policy; if a packet reaches the end of the chain it is returned to the chain which called it. A chain may be empty.

* codice_3: Packets will enter this chain before a routing decision is made.
* codice_4: Packet is going to be locally delivered. It does not have anything to do with processes having an opened socket; local delivery is controlled by the &quot;local-delivery&quot; routing table: codice_5.
* codice_6: All packets that have been routed and were not for local delivery will traverse this chain.
* codice_7: Packets sent from the machine itself will be visiting this chain.
* codice_8: Routing decision has been made. Packets enter this chain just before handing them off to the hardware.

A chain does not exist by itself; it belongs to a &quot;table&quot;. There are three tables: &quot;nat&quot;, &quot;filter&quot;, and &quot;mangle&quot;. Unless preceded by the option &quot;-t&quot;, an codice_9 command concerns the &quot;filter&quot; table by default. For example, the command codice_10, which shows some chains and their rules, is equivalent to codice_11. To show chains of table &quot;nat&quot;, use the command codice_12

Each rule in a chain contains the specification of which packets it matches. It may also contain a &quot;target&quot; (used for extensions) or &quot;verdict&quot; (one of the built-in decisions). As a packet traverses a chain, each rule in turn is examined. If a rule does not match the packet, the packet is passed to the next rule. If a rule does match the packet, the rule takes the action indicated by the target/verdict, which may result in the packet being allowed to continue along the chain or may not. Matches make up the large part of rulesets, as they contain the conditions packets are tested for. These can happen for about any layer in the model, as with e.g. the codice_13 and codice_14 parameters, and there are also protocol-independent matches, such as codice_15.

The packet continues to traverse the chain until either
# a rule matches the packet and decides the ultimate fate of the packet, for example by calling one of the codice_16 or codice_17, or a module returning such an ultimate fate; or
# a rule calls the codice_18 verdict, in which case processing returns to the calling chain; or
# the end of the chain is reached; traversal either continues in the parent chain (as if codice_18 was used), or the base chain policy, which is an ultimate fate, is used.

Targets also return a verdict like codice_16 (codice_21 modules will do this) or codice_17 (e.g. the codice_23 module), but may also imply codice_24 (e.g. the codice_25 module; codice_24 is an internal name) to continue with the next rule as if no target/verdict was specified at all.

==Userspace utilities==

===Front-ends===
There are numerous third-party software applications for iptables that try to facilitate setting up rules. Front-ends in textual or graphical fashion allow users to click-generate simple rulesets; scripts usually refer to shell scripts (but other scripting languages are possible too) that call iptables or (the faster) codice_27 with a set of predefined rules, or rules expanded from a template with the help of a simple configuration file. Linux distributions commonly employ the latter scheme of using templates. Such a template-based approach is practically a limited form of a rule generator, and such generators also exist in standalone fashion, for example, as PHP web pages.

Such front-ends, generators and scripts are often limited by their built-in template systems and where the templates offer substitution spots for user-defined rules. Also, the generated rules are generally not optimized for the particular firewalling effect the user wishes, as doing so will likely increase the maintenance cost for the developer. Users who reasonably understand iptables and want their ruleset optimized are advised to construct their own ruleset.

===Other notable tools===
* FireHOL – a shell script wrapping iptables with an easy-to-understand plain-text configuration file
* NuFW – an authenticating firewall extension to Netfilter
* Shorewall – a gateway/firewall configuration tool, making it possible to use easier rules and have them mapped to iptables

<doc id="971688" wikidata="Q2847252" url="?curid=971688" title="André Bellavance">
<text>André Bellavance (born June 3, 1964) is a Canadian politician, who served in the House of Commons of Canada from 2004 to 2015 and was the mayor of Victoriaville, Quebec from 2016 to 2021.

Born in Victoriaville, Quebec, Bellavance was the Bloc Québécois Member of Parliament for Richmond—Arthabaska from 2004 until his resignation from the party on August 25, 2014, continuing in the House of Commons of Canada as an Independent until the 2015 election. representing the riding of Richmond—Arthabaska since 2004. Before being elected, he was the parliamentary assistant to Pierre Paquette.

Bellavance was interim parliamentary leader of the Bloc from December 16, 2013, to February 25, 2014. On February 25, 2014, Bellavance resigned from that position to become a candidate in the Bloc Québécois leadership election. Bellavance&#x27;s candidacy for leadership was endorsed by the other three BQ MPs, however he was defeated in the leadership election by Mario Beaulieu, the former president of the sovereigntist Société-Saint-Jean-Baptiste, who was viewed as a &quot;hardline&quot; (&quot;pur et dur&quot;) sovereigntist in comparison to Bellavance who had campaigned on broadening the party so that it would become more than a coalition of sovereigntists.

On his reasons for leaving the Bloc, Bellavance told a press conference: &quot;[Beaulieu&#x27;s] vision and orientation for the Bloc are diametrically opposed to mine. Mr. Beaulieu says he can unite the party; for me it&#x27;s not the case.&quot; Bellavance also announced that he will not seek re-election as an MP.

Bellavance was elected as mayor of Victoriaville on February 21, 2016, following the election of previous mayor Alain Rayes to the House of Commons.

==Flag flap==
Bellavance gained national attention early in his first term as an MP, when he initially refused to provide Canadian flags to a Royal Canadian Legion hall in Richmond. Bellavance, a Quebec sovereigntist, had said he felt uncomfortable promoting Canada by providing a flag through his own office, and instead provided a toll-free phone number for the Department of Canadian Heritage, which might provide such a flag.

Other Bloc MPs had given their constituents Canadian flags on request in the past. A short national scandal ensued at what critics perceived a slight against veterans and against the country. Many politicians quickly sent the Legion flags; Prime Minister Paul Martin sent a flag that had flown atop the Peace Tower, and Opposition leader Stephen Harper personally delivered a dozen flags.

Gilles Duceppe, then leader of the Bloc Québécois, announced that the Bloc whip would send the legion several flags.

<doc id="971690" wikidata="Q5511064" url="?curid=971690" title="Fuzzy Control Language">
<text>Fuzzy Control Language, or FCL, is a language for implementing fuzzy logic, especially fuzzy control. It was standardized by IEC 61131-7. It is a domain-specific programming language: it has no features unrelated to fuzzy logic, so it is impossible to even print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;. Therefore, one does not write a program in FCL, but one may write &quot;part&quot; of it in FCL.

== Example ==

 RULE 0: IF (temperature IS cold) THEN (output IS low)
 RULE 1: IF (temperature IS very cold) THEN (output IS high)

== Limitations ==

FCL is not an entirely complete fuzzy language, for instance, it does not support &quot;hedges&quot;, which are adverbs that modify the set. For instance, the programmer cannot write:

RULE 0: If (Temperature is VERY COLD) then (Output is VERY HIGH)

However, the programmer can simply define new sets for &quot;very cold&quot; and &quot;very high&quot;. FCL also lacks support for higher-order fuzzy sets, subsets, and so on. None of these features are essential to fuzzy control, although they may be nice to have.

<text>In mathematics, a plane curve is a curve in a plane that may be a Euclidean plane, an affine plane or a projective plane. The most frequently studied cases are smooth plane curves (including piecewise smooth plane curves), and algebraic plane curves.
Plane curves also include the Jordan curves (curves that enclose a region of the plane but need not be smooth) and the graphs of continuous functions.

==Symbolic representation==
A plane curve can often be represented in Cartesian coordinates by an implicit equation of the form formula_1 for some specific function &quot;f&quot;. If this equation can be solved explicitly for &quot;y&quot; or &quot;x&quot; – that is, rewritten as formula_2 or formula_3 for specific function &quot;g&quot; or &quot;h&quot; – then this provides an alternative, explicit, form of the representation. A plane curve can also often be represented in Cartesian coordinates by a parametric equation of the form formula_4 for specific functions formula_5 and formula_6

Plane curves can sometimes also be represented in alternative coordinate systems, such as polar coordinates that express the location of each point in terms of an angle and a distance from the origin.

==Smooth plane curve==
A smooth plane curve is a curve in a real Euclidean plane and is a one-dimensional smooth manifold. This means that a smooth plane curve is a plane curve which &quot;locally looks like a line&quot;, in the sense that near every point, it may be mapped to a line by a smooth function.
Equivalently, a smooth plane curve can be given locally by an equation formula_7 where is a smooth function, and the partial derivatives and are never both 0 at a point of the curve.

==Algebraic plane curve==
An algebraic plane curve is a curve in an affine or projective plane given by one polynomial equation formula_8 (or formula_9 where is a homogeneous polynomial, in the projective case.)

Algebraic curves have been studied extensively since the 18th century.

Every algebraic plane curve has a degree, the degree of the defining equation, which is equal, in case of an algebraically closed field, to the number of intersections of the curve with a line in general position. For example, the circle given by the equation formula_10 has degree 2.

The non-singular plane algebraic curves of degree 2 are called conic sections, and their projective completion are all isomorphic to the projective completion of the circle formula_10 (that is the projective curve of equation The plane curves of degree 3 are called cubic plane curves and, if they are non-singular, elliptic curves. Those of degree 4 are called quartic plane curves.

==Examples==

Numerous examples of plane curves are shown in Gallery of curves and listed at List of curves. The algebraic curves of degree 1 or 2 are shown here (an algebraic curve of degree less than 3 is always contained in a plane):

<text>Cinema Verity was a British independent television and film production company, founded in 1985 by Verity Lambert, the television producer, who named the company after herself and as a pun on the expression &#x27;cinéma vérité&#x27;.

The company&#x27;s first major venture was the 1988 feature film &quot;A Cry in the Dark&quot;, which was produced by Lambert herself and based on the infamous Azaria Chamberlain &#x27;dingo baby&#x27; case in Australia in the early 1980s.

Thereafter, the company was active mainly in television, producing two sitcoms for BBC1, &quot;May to December&quot; (1989–94) and &quot;So Haunt Me&quot; (1992–94). It also co-produced the short-lived BBC soap opera &quot;Eldorado&quot; (1992–93).

Other work included the literary adaptation &quot;The Cazalets&quot; for BBC One in 2001. This programme was co-produced by actress Joanna Lumley, whose initial idea the adaptation had been.

The company was voluntarily dissolved in 2011.

<text>The Sikorsky Cypher and Cypher II are types of unmanned aerial vehicles developed by Sikorsky Aircraft. They are vertical takeoff and landing aircraft which use two opposing rotors enclosed in a circular shroud for propulsion.

==Design and development==

===Cypher===
In the late 1980s, Sikorsky Aircraft flew a small UAV named &quot;Cypher&quot;, with coaxial rotors inside a torus-shaped airframe. The torus shroud improved handling safety and helped increase lift. The first proof-of-concept Cypher was 1.75 meters (5.75 feet) in diameter and 55 centimeters (1.8 feet) tall, weighed 20 kilograms (43 pounds), and was first flown in the summer of 1988. This design was powered by a four-stroke, 2.85 kW (3.8 hp) engine and was mounted on a truck for forward-flight tests.

It led to a true flight prototype Cypher that weighed 110 kilograms (240 pounds), had a diameter of 1.9 meters (6.2 feet) and was powered by a compact, 40 kW (53 hp) Wankel engine. After an initial free flight in 1993, the Cypher prototype was used in flight tests and demonstrations through most of the 1990s, ultimately leading to a next-generation design, the Cypher II, which was a competitor in the United States Navy VT-UAV competition.

The single prototype first flew in April 1992 and flew untethered in 1993. Since then, over 550 demonstration flights have been made for the US government.

The Cypher can carry a sensor package on struts above its hull, or can transport loads weighing up to 50 lb (23 kg).

===Cypher II===
Two Cypher II prototypes have been built for the US Marine Corps, which calls it &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;. The Cypher II is similar in size to its predecessor, but has a pusher propeller in addition to its rotor and can be fitted with wings for long-range reconnaissance missions. In its winged configuration, the Cypher II has a range of over 185 kilometers (115 miles) and a top speed of 230 km/h (145 mph). It is unclear if the Cypher will enter production.

<doc id="971702" wikidata="Q1747573" url="?curid=971702" title="Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol">
<text>The Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) Protocol is a method used by clients to locate the URL of a configuration file using DHCP and/or DNS discovery methods. Once detection and download of the configuration file is complete, it can be executed to determine the proxy for a specified URL.

==History==
The WPAD protocol only outlines the mechanism for discovering the location of this file, but the most commonly deployed configuration file format is the proxy auto-config format originally designed by Netscape in 1996 for Netscape Navigator 2.0.
The WPAD protocol was drafted by a consortium of companies including Inktomi Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, RealNetworks, Inc., and Sun Microsystems, Inc. (now Oracle Corp.). WPAD is documented in an INTERNET-DRAFT which expired in December 1999. However, WPAD is still supported by all major browsers. WPAD was first included with Internet Explorer 5.0.

== Context ==
In order for all browsers in an organization to be supplied the same proxy policy, without configuring each browser manually, both the below technologies are required:

* Proxy auto-config (PAC) standard: create and publish one central proxy configuration file. Details are discussed in a separate article.
* Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol (WPAD) standard: ensure that an organization&#x27;s browsers will find this file without manual configuration. This is the topic of this article.

The WPAD standard defines two alternative methods the system administrator can use to publish the location of the proxy configuration file, using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or the Domain Name System (DNS):

Before fetching its first page, a web browser implementing this method sends a DHCPINFORM query to the local DHCP server, and uses the URL from the WPAD option in the server&#x27;s reply. If the DHCP server does not provide the desired information, DNS is used. If, for example, the network name of the user&#x27;s computer is &quot;pc.department.branch.example.com&quot;, the browser will try the following URLs in turn until it finds a proxy configuration file within the domain of the client:

* http://wpad.department.branch.example.com/wpad.dat
* http://wpad.branch.example.com/wpad.dat
* http://wpad.example.com/wpad.dat
* http://wpad.com/wpad.dat (in incorrect implementations, see note in Security below)

(Note: These are examples and are not &quot;live&quot; URLs due to them employing the reserved domain name of &quot;example.com&quot;.)

Additionally on Windows if the DNS query is unsuccessful then Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and/or NetBIOS will be used.

== Notes ==

DHCP has a higher priority than DNS: if DHCP provides the WPAD URL, no DNS lookup is performed. This only works with DHCPv4. In DHCPv6, there is no WPAD-Option defined.

When constructing the query packet, DNS lookup removes the first part of the domain name (the client host name) and replaces it with &quot;wpad&quot;. Then, it &quot;moves up&quot; in the hierarchy by removing more parts of the domain name, until it finds a WPAD PAC file or leaves the current organisation.

The browser guesses where the organisation boundaries are. The guess is often right for domains like &#x27;company.com&#x27; or &#x27;university.edu&#x27;, but wrong for &#x27;company.co.uk&#x27; (see security below).

For DNS lookups, the path of the configuration file is always &quot;wpad.dat&quot;. For the DHCP protocol, any URL is usable. For traditional reasons, PAC files are often called &quot;proxy.pac&quot; (of course, files with this name will be ignored by the WPAD DNS search).

The MIME type of the configuration file must be &quot;application/x-ns-proxy-autoconfig&quot;. See Proxy auto-config for more details.

Internet Explorer and Konqueror are currently the only browsers offering support for both the DHCP and DNS methods; the DNS method is supported by most major browsers.

== Requirements ==

In order for WPAD to work, a few requirements have to be met:

* In order to use DHCP, the server must be configured to serve up the &quot;site-local&quot; option 252 (&quot;auto-proxy-config&quot;) with a string value of e.g. http://example.com/wpad.dat where &quot;example.com&quot; is the address of a Web server. 
* In order to use the DNS only method, a DNS entry is needed for a host named WPAD.
* The host at the WPAD address must be able to serve a Web page.
* In both cases, the Web server must be configured to serve the WPAD file with a MIME type of codice_1.
* If the DNS method is used, a file named &quot;wpad.dat&quot; must be located in the WPAD Web site&#x27;s root directory.
* The PAC files are discussed in the Proxy auto-config article.
* Use caution when configuring a WPAD server in a virtual hosting environment. When automatic proxy detection is used, WinHTTP and WinINET in Internet Explorer 6 and earlier send a &quot;Host: &lt;IP address&gt;&quot; header and IE7+ and Firefox sends a &quot;Host: wpad&quot; header. Therefore, it is recommended that the wpad.dat file be hosted under the default virtual host rather than its own.
* Internet Explorer version 6.0.2900.2180.xpsp_sp2_rtm requests &quot;wpad.da&quot; instead of &quot;wpad.dat&quot; from the Web server.
* If Windows Server 2003 (or later) is used as the DNS server, the &quot;DNS Server Global Query Block List&quot; may have to be disabled, or the registry can be modified to edit the list of blocked queries.

== Security ==

While greatly simplifying configuration of one organisation&#x27;s web browsers, the WPAD protocol has to be used with care: simple mistakes can open doors for attackers to change what appears on a user&#x27;s browser:

* An attacker inside a network can set up a DHCP server that hands out the URL of a malicious PAC script.
* If the network is &#x27;company.co.uk&#x27; and the file http://wpad.company.co.uk/wpad.dat isn&#x27;t served, the browsers will go on to request http://wpad.co.uk/wpad.dat. Before the introduction of the Public Suffix List in the 2010s, some browsers could not determine that wpad.co.uk was no longer inside the organization.
* The same method has been used with http://wpad.org.uk. This used to serve a wpad.dat file that would redirect all of the user&#x27;s traffic to an internet auction site.
* ISPs that have implemented DNS hijacking can break the DNS lookup of the WPAD protocol by directing users to a host that is not a proxy server.
* Leaked WPAD queries could result in domain name collisions with internal network naming schemes. If an attacker registers a domain to answer leaked WPAD queries and configures a valid proxy, there is potential to conduct man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks across the Internet.

Through the WPAD file, the attacker can point users&#x27; browsers to their own proxies and intercept and modify the WWW traffic of everyone connected to the network. Although a simplistic fix for Windows WPAD handling was applied in 2005, it only fixed the problem for the .com domain. A presentation at Kiwicon showed that the rest of the world was still critically vulnerable to this security hole, with a sample domain registered in New Zealand for testing purposes receiving proxy requests from all over the country at the rate of several a second. Several of the wpad.tld domain names (including COM, NET, ORG, and US) now point to the client loopback address to help protect against this vulnerability, though some names are still registered (wpad.co.uk).

Thus, an administrator should make sure that a user can trust all the DHCP servers in an organisation and that all possible wpad domains for the organisation are under control. Furthermore, if there&#x27;s no wpad domain configured for an organisation, a user will go to whatever external location has the next wpad site in the domain hierarchy and use that for its configuration. This allows whoever registers the wpad subdomain in a particular country to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on large portions of that country&#x27;s internet traffic by setting themselves as a proxy for all traffic or sites of interest.

On top of these traps, the WPAD method fetches a JavaScript file and executes it on all users browsers, even when they have disabled JavaScript for viewing web pages.

<doc id="971703" wikidata="Q2316125" url="?curid=971703" title="Space Runaway Ideon">
<text>is a 1980 anime television series produced by Sunrise, created and directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, produced immediately following his signature work, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;. It first premiered on TV Tokyo from 1980 to 1981, followed by two feature films in 1982, and was later broadcast in Japan by the satellite TV network Animax from September 2006.

Its mechanical designs were created by Yuichi Higuchi at Studio Submarine. The television series credited only the design studio, while Higuchi received full credit for the subsequent films. The characters were designed by Tomonori Kogawa. The series won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize for the second half of 1980.

==Plot summary==
===Television series (prior to the ending)===
&quot;Space Runaway Ideon&quot; begins in 2300, far enough in the future that mankind has begun colonizing other planets. On the planet Solo in the Andromeda Galaxy, a group of archaeologists have come across the mysterious remains of the Ideon—three large armored tanks with the ability to combine into a godlike mecha. They also come across a large spaceship known as the Solo Ship. For six months, they have diligently restored the machines, but have failed to get the giant tanks to move. Suddenly, a humanoid alien civilization known as the Buff Clan comes across Solo.

Karala, the youngest daughter of the Buff Clan&#x27;s military commander, Doba Ajiba, flies down to the planet against orders with her assistant Mayaya to investigate (her commanding officer, Gije, is reluctant to go with her due to her standing and the fact that he once was a soldier under her father). She is pursued closely by soldiers sent by Gije, but they lose sight of her. Assuming the &quot;aliens&quot; (Earthling colonists) have attacked Karala, the Buff Clan begins to attack. Cosmo Yuki, the afro-wearing protagonist of the series, and his friends Kasha Imhof and Deck Afta climb aboard the three tanks, which activate on their own, and, when they initially combine to form the Ideon, fend off the first assault, repelling Gije&#x27;s men.

This is a short respite, though, as another force is sent down soon after. Bes Jordan, leader of the sparse military force stationed on Solo, orders that the Ideon tanks be armed with missiles, but while this is happening, the cities on Solo are obliterated by Buff Clan soldiers. Gije and his partner Damido, meeting up with the leader of their expedition, Abadidi Gurimade, soon launch more attacks on the planet Solo in an attempt to capture the Ideon (which they refer to as the &#x27;Giant God&#x27;). The survivors flee inside the Solo Ship and Karala and Mayaya, who are mistaken by Bes as a colonist, are let onboard as well. Other civilians who quickly get onboard the Solo Ship include Sheryl Formosa, a linguist studying the civilization on Solo; Sheryl&#x27;s sister, Lin; Banda Lotta; three children: Piper Lou, Ashura Nobaku, and Fard Maraka; mechanic Joliver Ira, pilot Hatari Naburu; and Moera Fatima.

The pilots Tekuno and Bento soon join Cosmo and Kasha as pilots of the Ideon&#x27;s 3 parts and Moera soon replaces Bes as another pilot. Karala and Mayaya are soon discovered to be aliens, and while Mayaya is killed, Bes has taken a liking to Karala and she is allowed to live, although Sheryl and others distrust her. Karala tells everyone of the Legend of Ide, a story of the Buff Clan&#x27;s savior, who saved them with the power of the Ide. The Buff Clan have searched the universe for this legendary existence, which is what powers both the Ideon and the Solo Ship.

The Solo Ship soon flees Solo using its powerful DS Drive engines and, after a fight in sub space with the Buff Clan, arrives at the planet Saurus Star. Bes, Cosmo, and the others confront Gije in a powerful Dogg Mack Mobile Suit and later in man to man fighting. Abadidi receives orders from above - Karala&#x27;s elder sister Harulu - that they no longer have to worry about harming Karala and can kill her they need to, since she has shamed the Ajiba family by associating with the humans. The Buff Clan force chases the Solo Ship to the planet Crystal Star, where Abadidi heads out himself in a Dogg Mack. His attempts to destroy the Solo Ship with giant winged creatures known as Bajins backfires and it is he who is killed by them. With Abadidi dead and Damido injured, Harulu herself heads to the front. Arriving on the planet Ruins Star, Karala tries to make peace with her sister, but is humiliated by Harulu&#x27;s underlings. Things get even worse for her when Banda Lotta, upset by all the harm the Buff Clan has caused, tries to kill her, but folds under pressure. Karala, who is willing to die, impresses everyone on the Solo Ship with her strength.

The Solo Ship arrives at an Earth base where Cosmo meets Camyula, a female officer who reminds him of his mother. She soon dies right in front of him, which renews his desire to fight. Damido, now recovered, makes one final attempt to destroy the Ideon, but is killed as well. The Solo Ship heads to the planet Ajian, and when Gije attacks the planet, the Ideon uses its powerful Black Hole Cannon, which prevents the Buff Clan&#x27;s missiles from hitting the planet, but ends up destroying a lot of the planet as a result. Gije heads back to the Buff Clan homeworld as the Solo Ship travels to the planet Flag Star. The Solo Ship and Harulu&#x27;s Dorowa Zan meet in space and the Dorowa is destroyed. Harulu flees in an escape capsule and meets up with Daram Zuba, a former lover and member of the Ome Foundation, which is plotting with Doba to overthrow the Buff Clan Emperor. With Gije with him, Daram now becomes the main adversary of the Solo Ship as it goes to the planet Kyaral. There, Cosmo meets Kitty Kitten, who desires for the Solo Ship to flee, since it will bring nothing but more heartbreak to their wartorn planet. Kitty is shot to death soon after by Daram and Cosmo is injured, saved only by a blood transfusion from Karala.

The Solo Ship, still pursued by Daram, approaches Earth, but the crew and the survivors learn that their fellow Earthlings will not welcome them. Sheryl and Joliver head to the moon to use the Earth military&#x27;s powerful Gloria computer and discover that the power of Ide is infinite. The Solo Ship is attacked yet again and the Ideon uses its newest weapon, the Ideon Gun, to defend itself. The 3 children sneak aboard the Ideon in their latest battle with the Buff Clan&#x27;s Barume Baram Mobile Weapon, which becomes an unforeseen benefit as the reaction of the children in danger makes the Ideon even more powerful and yet another weapon, the Ideon Sword, is revealed. Gije, abandoned by Daram, meets Sheryl and sneaks aboard the Solo Ship. Few trust him, even after he kills Daram in a battle on Earth. With the Earth&#x27;s military completely rejecting them, the Solo Ship flees without a home to go back to.

The Buff Clan continues to send high ranking Buff Clan officers after the Solo Ship, but they all fail. Moera is killed in battle to the distress of everyone, especially medic Rapot. Gije takes his place as one of the Ideon&#x27;s pilots. The Solo Ship returns to Ajian, whose inhabitants now despise them for what happened earlier and their military leader takes hostages, killing Lin before he is stopped. The Solo Ship flees to the planet Steckin Star and Gije is killed when the Ideon is heavily damaged. The Ideon continues to get more and more powerful as the battles and deaths escalate, and the Ideon chops the entire planet in half as it makes its escape.

===TV ending===
With repeated failure by his military leaders, Doba himself heads out on the Buff Clan flagship, the Bairal Jin. Along with him is the Ome Foundation leader, Gindoro. Karala and Joliver suddenly find themselves transported to the Bairal Jin and are caught by Doba and his men. Karala reveals that she is pregnant with the child of an Earthling (Bes), to the shock of everyone, and they make their escape. The Solo Ship heads there to save them. Doba then declares that he will do whatever it takes to kill his own daughter, causing the Ideon&#x27;s power to invoke. Karala and Joliver continue to head through the halls of the Bairal Jin and hide from the soldiers. They find the Heavy Mobile Mecha hangar and defeat the soldiers there chasing them. Doba orders his soldiers to find the source of the recent tremors occurring around the Bairal Jin. Suddenly, the Solo Ship departs from DS space right in front of the Bairal Jin and rams right into it. The Buff Clan&#x27;s forces approach the Solo Ship and the Ideon heads out to fight them. Karala and Joliver, putting on spacesuits, realize that the Solo Ship has come to rescue them.

They leave the dock, but are still pursued by soldiers. Cosmo tells the Solo Ship to keep the Ideon Gun since they won&#x27;t be able to use it there. Bes and Hatari are able to find Karala and Joliver. A strange light glows from Karala&#x27;s abdomen. Bes heads to one of the Solo Ship&#x27;s cannons to help Karala. He fires upon the soldiers pursuing her and Joliver. They make their way to a small Buff Clan shuttle. The Ideon uses its &#x27;All Missiles&#x27; attack on the enemy. Joliver tells Karala she&#x27;s gotten stronger as they head out in the shuttle. Bes tells Hatari to pull back the Solo Ship and have the Ideon protect Karala and Joliver. Cosmo brings the Ideon towards their shuttle, but it is blown up by a stray blast seconds before the Ideon reaches it. Cosmo curses the Buff Clan over Karala and Joliver&#x27;s apparent deaths. Hatari says the Ideon gauge has returned to normal and Bes orders him to reverse the thrusters and escape. Doba is upset at his force&#x27;s lack of success against the enemy. Suddenly, a glowing light appears in front of the Ideon. It is Karala and Joliver, unharmed. The Ideon grabs them and heads back towards the Solo Ship. Cosmo tells Bes and Hatari the good news. Joliver tells Karala she&#x27;s a great woman and that he&#x27;d be with her if she wasn&#x27;t with Bes already. The Solo Ship escapes into Null Space.

Doba orders his forces to track down the Solo Ship, even if they have to go to the end of the universe. At that moment, the Ideon is invoked. Yet another strange light envelops the Solo Ship. Doba and Karala&#x27;s encounter was the last chance humanity had, and both sides rejected it. The Ideon releases its infinite power, using Karala&#x27;s baby as the trigger, and the Ideon wipes out both races. It scatters humanity and the Buff Clan, sending them to the end of the universe to be reborn as wise and kindhearted, to use technology more wisely, and never to repeat the same mistakes they did by using technology. The souls of Piper Lou and Karala&#x27;s baby then travel through space.

===Be Invoked===
After the TV series ends, the second movie changes events drastically. The Buff Clan is quickly finishing its work on the Gando Rowa, a powerful warship that might be even more powerful than the Ideon. After Doba declares that he will hunt his daughter to the ends of the universe, the Solo Ship flees under pursuit of many Buff Clan troops. Harulu sends out her top fighters, Tororof and Kilarul, in the Zanza Lubu. Sheryl, drunken and mad over Lin and Gije&#x27;s deaths and armed with the knowledge that the Ide desires to protect children, brings out Piper Lou onto the deck of the ship in order to strengthen the Ideon. The force of the Ideon Gun blows her right off the ship to her death, reuniting her with her beloved Gije. Karala saves Piper Lou and the Solo Ship escapes.

On the bridge of the Solo Ship, Karala reveals to everyone else that she&#x27;s pregnant with Bes&#x27; child, who Cosmo and the others call a Messiah. Kilarul and Tororof head back to Harulu, telling her that Karala and her unborn child are what manifest the Ide. Harulu decides to both prevent the child&#x27;s birth and stop the Ide&#x27;s power from invoking by killing Karala. The Zanza Lubu that she, Kilarul, and Tororof are on is destroyed in battle, but the three make their way onto the Solo Ship. Tororof is killed by Banda Lotta, who is killed shortly after by Kilarul. Karala reveals herself and tries to kill Harulu, only to be shot in the face and killed by Harulu, who flees immediately after along with Kilarul. It isn&#x27;t long before the two of them are annihilated by the Ideon Gun.

Meanwhile, meteors strike Earth, its colony planets, and the Buff Clan&#x27;s homeworld, killing everyone and reducing them to uninhabitable wastelands. Gindoro, afraid of the Ideon and wishing to flee, refuses to listen to Doba and is subsequently killed. Doba, angry with the deaths of his daughters, has the Buff Clan military force continue to attack the Solo Ship as it approaches the Gando Rowa. In the ensuing battle, Kasha is killed by shrapnel and Buff Clan soldiers make their way to the Solo Ship bridge. Hatari, Rapot, and Ashura are killed, while Fard is mortally wounded. Bes is shot in the neck, hanging on long enough to fire back at the remaining assailants. Doba doesn&#x27;t care about sacrificing everyone&#x27;s lives as long as the Ideon is destroyed, causing his own soldiers to kill him, only for them to be killed when the Ideon attacks the bridge. The Ideon tries to destroy the Gando Rowa, which fires and kills everyone and destroys the Solo Ship. The Ide is invoked as the Ideon and the Gando Rowa are destroyed by a resulting blast wiping out the entire universe.

The naked souls of everyone, Buff Clan and Earthlings peaceful at last, ascend through space. Bes and Karala&#x27;s baby, the Messiah, leads everyone to a new planet in the universe that closely resembles Earth.

==Cast==
==DVD releases==
The home video releases of Ideon have all had very limited production runs. The series&#x27; first DVD box was overproduced, resulting in many units that did not sell even years after the release, so the second boxset and movie boxset had much fewer units produced. As a result, they sold out quickly and it was not uncommon to see the second boxset alone command a price of over 80,000 yen used on such websites as Yahoo! Japan auctions or amazon.co.jp, or all three boxsets sell for over 120,000 yen (over $1,000 USD), a remarkable feat for 38 episodes and 2 movies. (For reference, the retail price on the 153 episode Dragon Ball boxset sold new for 100,000 yen, $800 USD.)

In 2006 Ideon was re-released on single DVDs, but the singles, like previous Ideon releases, went quickly out of print due to a low production run. A Blu-ray box set of the TV series was released on February 2, 2013.

On November 8, 2017, Hidive announced that they will stream the series on their website beginning on November 9, 2017. As of August 2023 the series is no longer available on Hidive. On July 5, 2018, anime distributor Maiden Japan announced their license to the series. A 2-disc SDBD set was set to be released on December 11, 2018, however, after fan complaints, considering the quality shown on the Hidive stream at the time, Section23 announced that the SDBD set would be cancelled and replaced with a HD Blu-ray set down the line. The HD Blu-ray set was released on February 5, 2019.

<text>Suburban Base Records is a British breakbeat hardcore, rave and jungle/drum and bass record label. It is based in Romford, Havering, England. It was established by Danny Donnelly and operated in the UK from 1990 to 1997 and in the United States from 1994 to 1997, however, started to release again in 2014.

== History ==
Danny Donnelly opened a record store in his native Romford, Essex. Named Boogie Times, the store specialised in dance music as well as producing its own self-made white label records. Donnelly&#x27;s first release was a track called &quot;Hypersonic&quot; which he made with André Jacobs, the owner of Essex-based D-Zone Records. These Boogie Times white labels were well received by customers, as well as DJs from the nearby capital London, which enhanced the store&#x27;s reputation. In the wake of this success, Donnelly was able to fund a nascent label entitled Suburban Base.

The fledgling label&#x27;s first release was Kromozone&#x27;s &quot;The Rush&quot;, released in April 1991. This was followed by six further releases later in the year from artists Austin, M&amp;M, Rachel Wallace, Run Tings, Phuture Assassins and QBass. 1992 saw the label&#x27;s first Top 40 success in the UK Singles Chart - Sonz of a Loop Da Loop Eras&#x27; &quot;Far Out&quot; - a piano-led breakbeat track which reached number 36 in February. As music heard at raves filtered into the mainstream, the label was to end the year with twelve UK Singles Chart hits, and experienced the highest-charted debut from an independent record company since the charts began with Smart E&#x27;s &quot;Sesame&#x27;s Treet&quot;. The track, which sampled heavily from the US children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, reached number two in the UK Singles Chart in July of that year.

As the rave scene began to mutate into two contrasting scenes, 4/4 helium-vocal-characterised happy hardcore and darker, more bass-led darkcore (which itself mutated in jungle/drum and bass), the Suburban Base label found itself drawn to the latter. Such releases as DJ Hype&#x27;s &quot;Weird Energy&quot; and &quot;Shot In The Dark&quot; and Boogie Times Tribe&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Stranger&quot; (all 1993) maintained the label&#x27;s high standing within the scene, which continued as jungle/drum and bass broke through into the mainstream in 1994. Tracks from this period were showcased on the two &quot;The Joint&quot; compilation releases; a joint collaboration with fellow leading record label Moving Shadow.

That year, Donnelly launched Breakdown Records, a compilation-only subsidiary with which he and others devised and compiled an entire range of albums covering all genres of dance. The most successful of these were the &#x27;Drum &amp; Bass Selection&#x27; series, compiled with the help of Danny Breaks and DJ Ash, which sold in excess of 300,000 copies and were the first TV-advertised jungle compilations.

The label&#x27;s successes allowed it to expand its horizons, setting up a US subsidiary, Sub Base USA, and opening an office in Los Angeles, as well as securing a distribution deal for North America. Further label deals for South America and Japan soon followed.

Towards the end of 1997, however, Donnelly took the decision to close Suburban Base down. This was to allow him to pursue other new challenges in business, and he felt it would be a great injustice to continue running Suburban Base without his full attention. In particular, with the emergence of the speed garage music scene, a genre that derived many elements from jungle and which saw many jungle/drum and bass fans and club-goers defect to this new scene, Donnelly had created a specific sub-label, Quench, for speed garage releases.

In 2014, the label returned initially with a compilation, and then in 2021 started to release previously unreleased material and re-issues.

==Compilations==
Suburban Base regularly showcased its catalogue throughout its brief history. These compilations include:
*&quot;Sub Base For Your Face LP&quot; (1992)
*&quot;The Joint LP&quot; (1993) (collaboration with Moving Shadow)
*&quot;The Joint II&quot; (1994) (collaboration with Moving Shadow)
*&quot;A History Of Hardcore&quot; (1995) (collaboration with Moving Shadow)
*&quot;Subbase Sampler&quot; (1996)
*&quot;Classic Subbase&quot; (1997)
*&quot;Suburban Base Records (The History of Hardcore, Jungle, Drum &amp; Bass 1991-1997)&quot; (2014 via New State Music)

<doc id="971727" wikidata="Q5467741" url="?curid=971727" title="Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)">
<text>The Essex V6 is a 90° V6 engine family built by the Ford Motor Company at the Essex Engine Plant in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. This engine is unrelated to Ford&#x27;s British Essex V6. Introduced in 1982, versions of the Essex V6 engine family were used in subcompact through to large cars, vans, minivans, and some pickup trucks. The Essex V6 was last used in the 2008 regular-cab F-150, after which it was succeeded by a version of the Ford Cyclone engine. An industrial version of the engine was available until 2015.

==Design and early production==
The Essex V6 is an overhead valve (OHV) V6 engine with a 90° angle between cylinder banks, a single cam-in-block, and two valves per cylinder operated by pushrods and rocker arms. Split crankshaft pins permit even firing intervals. Versions of the engine used in front-engine, front-wheel-drive layouts (FWD) have a different bellhousing pattern than those use in front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layouts (RWD).

In 1977 Ford foresaw the need to develop a new engine for use in mid-size cars and light trucks in the 1980s. They began a project to design a V6 engine that would be lightweight, fuel efficient, and reliable. To meet the first criterion, many components were to be made of aluminum, including the intake manifold, front cover, water pump, oil pump, water outlet, rear cover plate, EGR distribution spacer, distributor, carburetor, engine block and cylinder heads. The rocker covers were of glass-filled nylon. The first engines were complete in early 1978 and successfully met all design objectives, but tooling and material cost increases prompted a redesign with a cast iron block while keeping the aluminum heads. Other lightweight features that were deleted in the redesign included a hollow-core crankshaft, stamped steel exhaust manifolds, and an aluminum harmonic balancer and camshaft sprocket. The first cast iron engines were complete by February 1979. Even with the weight increases due to the redesign, it was the lightest V6 engine of any displacement ever built in North America to that time.

The earliest production blocks exhibited a tendency to develop a crack in the camshaft bearing bulkhead that could propagate down to the bearing bore under high speed conditions. The problem, caused by the accelerated cooling of the blocks produced at full production speeds, was solved by increasing the width of the rib. To deal with the 5000 already completed engines that had received the potentially flawed block, Ford ran the engine assembly line backwards, disassembling the engines and stockpiling the internal components. The line was then run forward and the engines were reassembled using the stockpiled components and new engine blocks.

===SPI===
In 1996 the Essex V6 received Ford&#x27;s Split Port Induction (SPI) system, a form of variable-length intake manifold. In this system, the intake port to each intake valve is split into a primary and secondary passage. The primary passage contains the injector for the cylinder, and introduces the air tangentially to the cylinder for maximum swirl. The secondary passage contains an intake manifold runner control (IMRC) deactivation valve which opens for high speed and wide-open throttle (WOT) situations to provide a minimally restricted path for additional air to maximize volumetric efficiency and power.

Other changes that were part of the SPI system included lightweight valves, larger intake valves, revised exhaust ports, revised valve seats, an increased compression ratio, and new cylinder heads that were shared by both the 3.8 L and 4.2 L versions of the Essex V6. The IMRC assembly was likewise shared, while the upper intake manifold differed between the two engine versions.

The addition of the SPI system resulted in a 33% increase in peak power, a 7% increase in peak torque, and a 2% reduction in fuel consumption for the 3.8 L Essex. The 4.2 L saw similar improvements, and its longer stroke and use of longer intake runners resulted in an even greater increase in low speed torque.

==Origin rumors==
Two rumors about the origin of the Essex V6 engine&#x27;s design have circulated:

#That the Essex V6 is a Ford small block V8 engine with two cylinders removed
#That the Essex V6 is a copy of the Buick V6 engine.

The first claim relies on similarities like the 90° angle between cylinder banks, an OHV valvetrain, and the fact that deducting two cylinders&#x27; volume from a 5.0 L V8 results in a V6 displacing in the range of . Although the practice of deriving a V6 from a V8 is not unheard of, there are significant differences between the small block V8 and the Essex V6. The bore and stroke of the V8 are different from those of the Essex V6, as are their bore center spacings, making a common lineage unlikely. Also, while the versions of the Essex V6 used in RWD applications shared their bell housing pattern with the 5.0 L small block V8 engine, the FWD version did not, having a pattern that matched the 3.0 L Vulcan V6 instead.

The second claim is also based on the two engines sharing certain features, including; a short rigid block, but shorter on the Ford and with different bore spacings; similar, but not identical, bore and stroke dimensions; similar rods and mains dimensions; a rolled radius on the mains; split rod pins for even firing intervals on the 90° block, although with different bobweight percentages; a cam located by a spring-loaded thrust button, later designed out on the Ford; and an aluminum front cover for the oil and water pumps. 

In a paper published in the Society of Automotive Engineers &quot;SAE Transactions&quot; detailing the origin and development of the Essex V6, there are several places where either the Ford 5.0 L V8 or a &quot;competitive 3.8L V6&quot; are mentioned, usually to serve as a contrast to a feature of the Essex V6. Under &quot;Engine Test &amp; Development&quot;, the article mentions that the engine&#x27;s basic design assumptions were demonstrated using &quot;competitive V6 engines&quot; as well as the Ford 5.0 L V8 modified to operate as a 90° V6, but does not indicate that the Essex V6 was directly based on either of these proof-of-concept test engines. Instead, the article describes the Essex V6 as &quot;an all-new lightweight 90° V6 engine&quot;.

==3.8 L==
The first Essex V6 released was a 3.8 L version introduced for the 1982 model year as an option on the Ford Granada.

Bore and stroke were , for a total displacement of . Output was at 4200 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm. Most early engines had a 2-barrel Motorcraft 2150 carburetor, while 50-state Lincoln Continentals and California Granada-Cougar-Thunderbird-XR7 cars got Ford&#x27;s Motorcraft 7200 carburetor with variable venturi. Central Fuel Injection became available in 1984, raising output to at 3600 rpm and of torque at 1600 rpm in models so equipped.

Multi-point fuel injection (single port) became standard on the 3.8 L V6 in 1988, raising power and torque to at 3800 rpm and of torque at 2400 rpm. Engines upgraded with Ford&#x27;s EEC-V Powertrain control module (PCM) received a small increase in output to , if they did not have other enhancements to increase output beyond this already. The 1991–1995 Police Package Taurus, 1991–1994 Lincoln Continental and 1995 Ford Windstar had a high-output version of the 3.8 L with better cylinder heads and other modifications that produced and of torque depending on application and model year.

A 3.8 L V6 with SPI was introduced in the 1996 Windstar. With a compression ratio of 9.3:1, this engine was rated at at 5000 rpm and of torque at 3000 rpm. The upper intake manifold has a sticker located on the passenger side of the forward plenum denoting &quot;Split Port Induction&quot;.

For 1999 the 3.8 L in the Mustang was updated to use the split port cylinder heads originally introduced on the Windstar, but did not use IMRC, leaving all twelve intake runners open at all times. Output of the V6 in these Mustangs was at 5250 rpm and of torque at 2750 rpm. With the addition of IMRC to the Mustang in 2001, engine output increased slightly to at 5500 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm.

A nine-digit serial number appears on a label on the right side (front) valve cover. It also appears on a barcode label on the transmission side of the right side head.

Applications:
* 1982 Ford Granada
* 1982–1983 Ford F-100
* 1982–1997 Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar
* 1982–1986, 1994–2004 Ford Mustang
* 1982–1986 Mercury Capri
* 1983–1986 Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis
* 1988–1995 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable
* 1988–1994 Lincoln Continental
* 1995–2003 Ford Windstar

===Supercharged 3.8 L===
Ford developed a supercharged version of the 3.8 L Essex V6 that was used in two Ford MN12 platform cars beginning in the late 1980s. 

A belt driven Eaton M90 roots-type supercharger spinning at 2.6 times engine rpm, to a maximum of 15,000 rpm at the engine&#x27;s 6000 rpm redline, provided up to of boost. An intercooler was added to cool the intake charge. Internal changes to the engine included an engine block and cylinder heads modified to accommodate increased coolant flow, a fully counterweighted forged crankshaft, a billet camshaft with revised cam profiles, and hypereutectic alloy pistons, along with a reduction in the compression ratio to 8.2:1. Output of this engine was at 4000 rpm and of torque at 2600 rpm.

Five Thunderbirds with pre-release supercharged Essex V6s were supplied to the Arizona Highway Patrol in 1988 for road testing, even though the supercharged engine never became part of an official police package. In 1991 Ford again sent a batch of supercharged engines, this time in production Thunderbird SCs, to the Arizona Highway Patrol for hot weather testing.

The supercharged Essex 3.8 L debuted in the new-for-1989 Thunderbird Super Coupe and Cougar XR-7, becoming the first supercharged engine offered by an American manufacturer since the Studebaker Silver Hawk of the late 1950s or early 1960s. The standard transmission in the Thunderbird Super Coupe was a Mazda M5R2-RKE 5-speed manual transmission, while a 4-speed AOD automatic transmission was optional.

The supercharged Essex was dropped from the Cougar XR-7 in favor of a V8 shortly after the start of the 1991 model year, but continued to be used in the Super Coupe.

For the 1994 and 1995 model years the engine received revisions that increased power to at 4400 rpm and torque to at 2500 rpm. The supercharger got a larger, square-style inlet, a larger attaching inlet plenum, and Teflon coated rotors. The engine received larger fuel injectors, and the compression ratio was raised to 8.5:1. The Super Coupe was offered until 1995, after which production of the engine stopped.

Applications:
* 1989–1995 Thunderbird Super Coupe
* 1989–1990 Cougar XR-7

==4.2 L==

The largest displacement version of the Essex V6 appeared in the 1997 model year as a replacement for the Ford 300 straight six in the F-150. This engine kept the 3.8 L&#x27;s bore, but featured a stroke lengthened to , bringing its displacement up to . Power output of the 4.2 L V6 in the 1997 F-150 was at 4750 rpm, and torque was at 3000 rpm.

The 4.2 L Essex has been described as one of the more reliable engines offered in the F-150 at the time, although the early engines did encounter some well-known problems. All 1997–1998 engines made at the Canadian Essex plant received a bad front cover gasket. Ford initially addressed this problem by using a thicker gasket for the 1999 model year and five years later, in 2004, replaced the earlier gasket with a completely redesigned part. The lower-intake manifold also had a reputation for cracking at relatively low miles.

The 4.2 L V6&#x27;s final use was as the base engine in the 2008 F-150; the 2009 and 2010 F-150 was only offered with V8 engines, and starting with the 2011 model year the new 3.7 L Cyclone became the standard engine. The 2008 model year marked the end of the Essex V6&#x27;s use in cars and trucks.

An industrial version of the 4.2 L Essex engine, called the ESG-642, was offered by Ford Power Products. Versions of this engine could use gasoline, Natural gas, or Liquified Petroleum gas as fuels. The ESG-642 was available until 2015, after which it was succeeded by the newer 3.7 L Cyclone-based CSG-637.

Applications:
* 1997–2008 Ford F-150

<text>Leyton Football Club was an English association football club based in Leyton, in the London Borough of Waltham Forest. The club withdrew from the Isthmian League Division One North in January 2011 due to severe financial difficulties, and disbanded. The first club to go by the name was founded in 1868, and the last incarnation of the club, which began playing in 1997, won a High Court action in 2002 in support of its claim to be a continuation of the original team, making it at that stage the second-oldest existing club in Greater London, after Cray Wanderers.

The team played in white shirts with blue shorts and white socks and were nicknamed the &quot;Lilywhites&quot; or &quot;Lillies&quot;. The club were unrelated to their Football League neighbours Leyton Orient, although Orient moved into their Brisbane Road stadium after Leyton moved out in 1937.

==History==

The club was originally founded in 1868, and disbanded several times (late 1890s, 1911, 1914 and 2011) during its history. In 1975, the club merged with Wingate F.C. to become Leyton-Wingate F.C. until 1992 when the two clubs parted company and the name reverted to &quot;Leyton&quot;. In 1995 the club merged with Walthamstow Pennant and moved away from Leyton Stadium to become Leyton Pennant F.C., who are now known as Walthamstow.

A new Leyton Football Club was established in 1997, and following a High Court case in 2002, won the right to be recognised as a continuation of the original club. A statement by lawyers Richard West Freeman Christofi reads:

At the beginning of the new millennium Leyton won back-to-back promotions, winning the Essex Senior League in 2001–02 then finishing second in the Isthmian League Second Division the following season. In 2003–04 Leyton finished second in the Isthmian League First Division North, gaining a place in the new Isthmian League Premier Division for the following season as the non-league pyramid was reconstructed. In 2004–05 Leyton finished fifth in the Isthmian Premier Division and reached the final of the play-offs for promotion to the Conference South, but the Lilywhites were beaten 2–1 in the final by Eastleigh.

Costas Sophocleous, the club chairman, was once the manager. Having managed the team for the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons, Sophocleous decided to step back from management to concentrate on his role as chairman. Following a bad start to the season, however, two managers were sacked in quick succession and the chairman took over the managerial role again.

Leyton then appointed Troy Townsend as manager for the 2005–06 season. He continued to manage the first team squad, the reserves side (which competed in the Capital League) and the Eastern Junior Alliance U18s squad.

In 2006–07 Leyton completed the season in 15th position. This led Troy Townsend to step aside as manager of the first team to concentrate on the reserves and U18s sides. The following season, under manager Rowley Cray, the club suffered an 11–1 home defeat to Hendon and a 9–0 loss at AFC Hornchurch en route to relegation.

Steve Newing and Del Deanus (previously at Edgware Town) were appointed as joint managers for the 2008–09 season, but resigned in November citing financial difficulties at the club. Tony Ievoli then took the reins but he resigned at the start of September 2009, before being replaced by former Grays Athletic manager, Craig Edwards. In November 2009 Edwards was replaced by Ivan Persaud.

In October 2009, following an investigation by HMRC, chairman Costas Sophocleous and former director Philip Foster pleaded guilty to their parts in a £16 million VAT fraud. In January 2010 Sophocleous was sentenced to 8 years 3 months and Foster to 5 years 3 months. Sophocleous&#x27; son, former Leyton player Mark, and his wife, Alison, were found not guilty of associated money laundering charges. Accountant Stewart Collins was found guilty and sentenced to 6 years. Sophocleous stood down as chairman and was replaced by former vice-chairman Tony Hardy.

Following Costas Sophocleous&#x27; conviction, Ivan Persaud left the club and was replaced as manager by former player Malcolm Dannie for the beginning of February 2010.

The team&#x27;s inability to win a game in his tenure led to Dannie leaving and being replaced by former Ashford Town Middlesex Reserve Team manager Wilson Frimpong for the final six games of the season, during which time the team went unbeaten but still failed narrowly to avoid finishing 21st and in the relegation zone. However, because several clubs higher in the pyramid were dissolved or demoted, Leyton were awarded a reprieve and remained in the Isthmian League Division One North division for the 2010–11 season.

In January 2011, and after a short suspension from the league for not paying its subscription, the club was forced to withdraw from the league due to debt. Following this, the chairman, secretary, management and players all left the club, effectively ending its existence.

In the summer of 2017, a group of Dutch investors made an attempt to revive the club under the name Leyton 1868 FC. Going as far as hosting behind-closed-doors friendlies however by November 2017 the project fell through.

==Stadium==
Leyton F.C. played at the Leyton Stadium (previously known as the Hare and Hounds, and before that as the Wingate-Leyton Stadium). At its height the club had ten youth teams, ranging in age from under nines to under eighteens, and ran a Football in the Community scheme for local schools.

<doc id="971736" wikidata="Q488463" url="?curid=971736" title="Ice cube">
<text>An ice cube is a small piece of ice, which is typically rectangular as viewed from above and trapezoidal as viewed from the side. Ice cubes are products of mechanical refrigeration and are usually produced to cool beverages. They may be made at home in a freezer with an ice tray or in an automated ice-making accessory. They may also be produced industrially and sold commercially.

== Origin of production ==
American physician and inventor John Gorrie built a refrigerator in 1844 to produce ice in cool air. His refrigerator produced ice which hung from the ceiling in a basin to lower the ambient room temperature. During his time, bad air quality was thought to cause disease. Therefore, in order to help prevent and treat sickness, he pushed for the draining of swamps and the cooling of sickrooms.

== Production ==

=== Trays and bags ===

Ice cube trays are designed to be filled with water, then placed in a freezer until the water freezes into ice, producing ice cubes. Ice trays are often flexible, so the frozen cubes can be easily removed by flexing the tray. &quot;Twist ice trays&quot; have a simple spring-loaded mechanism with a lever that is used to turn the tray upside down and flex at the same time, such that the cubes that drop are collected in a removable tray below. The spring returns the ice cube tray to its upright position without having to remove it from the freezer, which can save time and reduce accidental mess—though the tray has to be removed to be collected, the ice cube tray still has to be removed to be refilled. An alternative system is an aluminium tray with a lever that raises the ice cubes, freeing them from the tray. A motorized version of this is found in most automatic ice-making freezers.

While the usual shape of the ice cube is roughly cubical, some ice trays form hemispherical or cylindrical shapes; others produce blocks of ice in seasonal, festive, or other shapes. Occasionally, edible items are frozen inside ice cubes at home and in commercial production.

Lloyd Groff Copeman invented a rubber ice tray after noticing that slush and ice flaked off his rubber boots rather than adhering to them while walking through some woods collecting sap for maple syrup. Recalling this 1928 incident over lunch with his patent attorney, he conducted experiments using rubber cups, which led to practical designs and patents for different types of tray; these included a metal tray with rubber separators, a metal tray with individual rubber cups which was invented in 1933, and a tray made completely of rubber. Guy L. Tinkham, a household product executive, invented the first flexible, stainless steel, all-metal ice cube tray in 1933. The tray bent sideways to remove the ice cubes. Commercial pre-filled disposable ice trays for home freezing are designed to provide better taste and reduce the risk of contamination.

Danish inventor Erling Vangedal-Nielsen patented the single-use ice cube bag in 1978. He was inspired to do so after spending a night with friends where their need for ice was in excess of that which ice cube trays could provide; he, therefore, filled standard plastic bags with water and froze them, the ice to subsequently be retrieved with a hammer. The design was subsequently revised to feature individual compartments for each ice cube, with a seal at the bag&#x27;s entry point. The ice cube bag has subsequently been marketed and adopted worldwide.

Dedicated ice-maker machines can be used to produce ice cubes for laboratories, home, and academic use. Ice cubes are also produced commercially and sold in bulk.

== Range of characteristics ==

=== Clear and cloudy ===

Commercially made ice cubes may be clear, compared to domestically made ice cubes. Cloudy ice cubes occur when water is frozen quickly, or when the water is high in dissolved solids. When water is cooled to its freezing point, and ice starts to form, dissolved gases can no longer stay in solution and come out as microscopic bubbles. However, as ice floats in water, once there is enough ice to form a layer on the surface, the ice layer traps all bubbles within the ice cube. Commercial ice-makers use a flowing source of purified water to make ice with cooling elements at the bottom, allowing the bubbles to be washed away from the top as the cube grows.

=== Crushed ice ===
Crushed ice is the term for ice cubes that are crushed or sheared into irregularly shaped flakes to provide an aesthetic effect to some cocktails. Crushed ice is also used when faster cooling is desired since the number and average radius of the ice particles govern the cooling rate. Ice is often also crushed to form slushies, which can be both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. Crushed ice melts faster than solid ice: it has a greater surface area, so heat transfer is faster than solid ice.

Ice chips are small pieces of ice, which can be obtained by crushing cubes. They are often recommended before surgery or an invasive medical procedure. They may help to prevent oral mucositis or mouth sores associated with high-dose chemotherapy.

== Alternatives ==
An alternative to ice cubes for &quot;whiskey on the rocks&quot; are so-called whiskey rocks or stones. These are used to chill a drink without diluting it.

<text>Count Sergey Semionovich Uvarov (; – ) was a Russian classical scholar and politician who is best remembered as an influential statesman under Nicholas I of Russia.

==Biography==
Uvarov, connected through marriage with the Razumovsky family, published a number of works on Ancient Greek literature and archaeology, which brought him European renown. A confirmed conservative, he was on friendly terms with Alexander Humboldt, Madame de Stael, Goethe, Prince de Ligne, Nikolay Karamzin, and Vasily Zhukovsky. Uvarov studied in Göttingen, and from 1811 to 1822, he curated the Saint Petersburg educational district.

In 1832, Uvarov was appointed Deputy Minister of National Education, succeeding his father-in-law Count Alexey Razumovsky. He was elected an Honorable Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1811 and was the president of that venerable institution from 1818 until his death. In the wake of the Decembrist revolt of 1825, the Emperor moved to protect the status quo by centralizing the educational system. He wanted to neutralize the threat of foreign ideas and what he ridiculed as &quot;pseudo-knowledge.&quot; However, Uvarov quietly promoted academic freedom and autonomy, raised academic standards, improved facilities, and opened higher education to the middle classes. By 1848 the Emperor, fearing the political upheavals in the West might cause uprisings in Europe, ended Uvarov&#x27;s innovations.

Uvarov was responsible for coming up with the formula &quot;Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality&quot;, the basis of his activities regarding public education. According to Uvarov’s theory, the Russian folk (&quot;narod&quot;) is very religious and devoted to the Emperor, so the Orthodox religion and Autocracy are unconditional bases of the existence of Russia. Nationality (&quot;narodnost&quot;) is deemed to be the necessity to follow independent national traditions and to fight foreign influence. The theory stated that it was necessary to reject western ideas – freedom of thought, freedom of personality, individualism, rationalism which were considered by Orthodox religion as dangerous and rebel thinking. The chief of Russian political police (the Third Section of His Majesty Personal Chancellery) Alexander von Benckendorff wrote that “&quot;the past of Russia was wonderful, the present is splendid and the future is above all dreams&quot;”. These three concepts were considered as &quot;pillar-walls&quot; of the Russian Empire. He worked to limit access to education by people of non-noble origin and strengthening governmental control over the universities and gymnasiums, once famously remarking, &quot;No university Pugachevs.&quot; It means that only a small part of Russian population (only noble ones, many of them of foreign descent) had the possibility to get the education; it was almost impossible for Russian non-nobles (&quot;raznochynets&quot;) to get access to education. Within this meaning, the &quot;Narodnost&quot; (Nationality) meant that Russian folk had to stay away from education (Western influence) in order to preserve the folks&#x27; pure Russian national character.

The universities were small and closely monitored, especially the potentially dangerous philosophy departments. Their main mission was to train a loyal, athletic, masculinized senior bureaucracy that avoided the effeminacy of office work.

Despite these reactionary measures, Uvarov was also responsible for laying the foundations of high-quality education in Russia and reinstating the practice of sending Russian scientists abroad. Unfortunately all his deeds and acts were a dead contribution into Russian educational system, because almost 99% of Russian population (non-nobles, folk) were prohibited from getting education, no matter how talented they were.

Uvarovite, the rarest of garnets, is named after him. His son Aleksey Uvarov co-founded the Russian Archaeological Society and the State Historical Museum in Moscow.

Uvarov&#x27;s known relationship was with Prince Mikhail Alexandrovich Dondukov-Korsakov, who, according to persistent rumors reflected in Pushkin&#x27;s scurrilous epigram, was owed his appointment in the Academy of Sciences to his homosexual relationship with Uvarov.

<doc id="971745" wikidata="Q2173192" url="?curid=971745" title="Sturry">
<text>Sturry is a village on the Great Stour river situated northeast of Canterbury in Kent. Its large civil parish incorporates several hamlets and, until April 2019, the former mining village of Hersden.

==Geography==
Sturry lies at the old Roman junction of the road from the city to Thanet and Reculver, at the point where a fort was built to protect the crossing of the river Stour. Sturry railway station was opened in 1848 and the line was electrified in 1962, by the South Eastern Railway; it is on the line between Canterbury West and Ramsgate. The station was until the 1860s the stagecoach point for Herne and Herne Bay. The parish boundaries are the same now as they were in 1086 as recorded in the Domesday Book.

==History==
Human habitation in Sturry is thought to have started around 430,000 years ago, as dated flint implements - namely knives and arrow-tips - show. Other signs of early human activities include a collection of axes and pottery shards from the Bronze Age and more pottery from the Sturry Hill gravel-pits, and a burial-ground near Stonerocks Farm showed that there was an Iron Age settlement of Belgic Celts (who gave Canterbury its pre-Roman name of Durovernum) from the end of the 2nd century BC.

All this evidence indicates that human habitation of some kind existed on the north bank of the River Stour, on Sturry&#x27;s site, for hundreds and thousands of years. When the Romans arrived, they built Island Road (the A28) to connect Canterbury, the local tribal capital, with the ferry to the Isle of Thanet, with a branch to their fort at Reculver.

The most important era for Sturry, determining its future shape, size, function and name, was that part of the early 5th century when the beleaguered Romano-Britons brought in Frisians and Jutes as mercenaries to help them fight against invading Picts and Scots, and rewarded them with land. Some of them settled near Sturry: their cemetery was found at Hersden. Some time after, Kent was re-organised into lathes, or districts. Sturry was the first; Stour-gau, meaning district or lathe on the Stour. The lathe was bounded by the Stour as far as Canterbury in the North by the sea, and farther south as distant as Wye.

The remains of a large village water mill lie near the parish church, and the High Street retains some historic buildings. The village virtually adjoins one of the smallest towns in England, Fordwich, where there are further interesting buildings, including the historic Town Hall. Fordwich itself is smaller in size than Sturry. A rare survival, a small granary, constructed with wooden weather-boards is located at Blaxland Farm and has nine staddle stones supporting it. A barn from Vale Farm, Calcott has been re-erected at the Museum of Kent Life, Sandling. A 16th-century manor house and oast house, built in 1583 and which belonged to St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in Canterbury still stand in Sturry village beside the medieval tithe barn - although they have all been incorporated into the King&#x27;s School after they were sold by the widow of Lord Milner in 1925.

Since the 1960s a large number of satellite housing estates have been built on the north side of the village, mostly in former woodland, which have turned Sturry into one of the major dormitory villages for Canterbury. Nonetheless, the village is still overwhelmingly rural, with fields for arable farming and livestock grazing, and large amounts of coppice woodland. A number of market gardens can also be found in the countryside around the village. Large and deep quarries are still worked on the edge of the village, with the old workings flooded to provide recreational lakes used primarily for fishing.

===The Second World War===
During the Second World War, Sturry was bombed, the greater part of the High Street being destroyed by a parachute mine in 1941 during the Baedeker Blitz, killing 15 people of which seven were children aged 12 and under. One of these was a little girl who had been to the bakers&#x27; and whose body was recovered still clutching the bag of buns she had bought.

The same aircraft dropped another bomb, but this landed amongst the allotments. In the book &quot;Letters to Sturry&quot;, it is recorded that on Wednesday 28 August 1940, there were eight separate air-raid warnings and on &#x27;Battle of Britain Day&#x27;, 15 September 1940, a German Dornier bomber plane (Aircraft 2651, 3rd Staffel, Kampfgeschwader 76), crash-landed in a field below Kemberland Wood near the Sarre Penne stream. Three of the five crew were killed and were firstly buried in Sturry Cemetery but then reinterred in the late 1960s into the German war cemetery at Cannock Chase.

Nonetheless, a number of interesting buildings remain intact in Sturry, including the Manor House, built in 1583, which is now the junior school of The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury.

==Religion==
St Nicholas parish church is a joint Anglican and Methodist church and is situated on a bank beside the River Stour, The Local Ecumenical Partnership enables the congregation to be of mixed denomination - either Methodist or Anglican. The large parish of St Nicholas incorporates the villages of Sturry with Fordwich and Westbere with Hersden.

The church is predominantly Norman in style, with the oldest parts dating to about 1200. In 1965 the church was Grade I listed by English Heritage.

==Education==
There are two primary schools in the area. Sturry Church of England Primary school is situated near the north of the village, with strong links with Hersden Primary School. The junior part of The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, is also located in south Sturry. Famous alumni of King&#x27;s School include Antony Worrall Thompson and Orlando Bloom. 
Spires Academy, formerly known as Sturry Secondary Modern School and later Frank Montgomery School, is the only secondary school in Sturry. It too has produced graduates of note, including the television producer Nic Ayling, the actor Rusty Goffe, and the novelist Michael Paraskos.

==Sport==
Sturry has had a cricket club playing off Field Way since 1863. In 2005 Sturry Cricket Club was made homeless after the land was sold; currently the club are playing out of Polo Farm Sports Ground near Fordwich and run two sides in the KRCL on Saturday and a friendly side on Sundays.

<text>Michael Barry OBE (15 May 1910 – 27 June 1988) was a British television producer, director and executive, who was an important early influence on BBC television drama. He was educated at King&#x27;s College London.

He was one of the first producers to work in the field of drama for the BBC, producing and directing several plays for the fledgling BBC Television Service in the 1930s, before it was placed on hiatus for the duration of the Second World War in 1939. He also worked occasionally outside of drama, producing episodes of the magazine programme &quot;Picture Page&quot; during 1938. After the resumption of the service in 1946, Barry returned, and quickly became one of the senior drama producers.

In 1952, he succeeded Val Gielgud to become the Head of Drama at BBC Television, a position he was to occupy for the next decade. He was responsible for commissioning several important productions, including the &quot;Quatermass&quot; science-fiction serials, and in 1954 an adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. This latter production caused much controversy due to its supposed horrific scenes and subversive content, and Barry appeared on the current affairs programme &quot;Panorama&quot; the day after broadcast to defend the production, and three days later introduced the second performance live to camera himself.

Barry retired from his position of Head of Drama in 1961, being replaced the following year by his friend Sydney Newman, who oversaw major changes in the department. After a brief and unsuccessful spell in charge of RTÉ&#x27;s new television service in Ireland, Barry returned for a time to front-line producing work, overseeing an epic series adaptations of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; sequence of plays, before he retired altogether from television work.

The memoirs of his period in television, &quot;From the Palace to the Grove&quot;, were published by the Royal Television Society in 1992.

<text>Decoder is the collective stage name of drum and bass jungle producers Darren Beale and Mark Caro.

==Biography==
Beale started his career in 1991 using various aliases, creating some old-school hardcore tracks. He continued with fine tuning the deep jungle sounds under the Orca and Koda aliases on Lucky Spin Records and its sister label, Deejay Recordings, releasing &quot;Tranquility to Earth&quot; in 1994. In 1995 he first used the Decoder pseudonym, pioneering the dark or &#x27;tech step&#x27; style of drum &amp; bass, often on Mark Caro&#x27;s label Tech Itch Recordings. 

1997 saw the release of Decoder&#x27;s &quot;Decoded EP&quot;. Decoder&#x27;s releases appeared on various labels, including Breakbeat Culture with Markee Ledge as Decoder &amp; Substance, Tech Itch Recordings, BS1 Records, Hard Leaders, 31 Records and Audio Couture.

Beale&#x27;s next release, the &quot;Encrypted EP&quot;, reached number three in Fabio &amp; Grooverider&#x27;s &quot;Rollers Top Ten&quot; chart in 1998. The &quot;Encrypted EP&quot;, along with &quot;Headlock&quot;, &quot;Deception&quot; and Decoder&#x27;s collaboration with Mark Caro, &quot;EKO&quot;, followed. The debut album, &quot;Dissection&quot;, appeared on Hard Leaders Records in 1998. Decoder was also responsible for remixes of tracks such as Photek&#x27;s &quot;Rings Around Saturn&quot;, Adam F&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and Alan McGee&#x27;s &quot;The Chemical Pilot&quot;.

Beale later went on to form a new band called Kosheen with Markee Ledge.

<doc id="971778" wikidata="Q1635668" url="?curid=971778" title="Constitutional Reform Act 2005">
<text>The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (c. 4) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, relevant to UK constitutional law. It provides for a Supreme Court of the United Kingdom to take over the previous appellate jurisdiction of the Law Lords as well as some powers of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and removed the functions of Speaker of the House of Lords and Head of the Judiciary of England and Wales from the office of Lord Chancellor.

==Background==
The office of Lord Chancellor was reformed to remove the ability of the holder to act as both a government minister and a judge, an arrangement that ran contrary to the idea of separation of powers. The reform was motivated by concerns that the historical mixture of legislative, judicial, and executive power might not conform with the requirements of Article 6 (paragraph 1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, because a judicial officer who has legislative or executive power is likely not to be considered sufficiently impartial to provide a fair trial. This act ensures that the powers of the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Justice have limitations on their abilities over the president of the court.

==Legislative history==
The bill was originally introduced in the House of Lords on 24 February 2004 and proposed the following changes:
*Abolition of the office of &quot;Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain&quot;, generally known as the Lord Chancellor.
*Setting up of a &quot;Supreme Court of the United Kingdom&quot; and moving the Law Lords out of the House of Lords to this new court.
*Other measures relating to the judiciary, including changes to the position of the Lord Chief Justice and changes to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

The bill caused much controversy and the Lords made amendments to it. The most significant of these was the decision not to abolish the position of Lord Chancellor, as, unlike other Secretaries of State in the UK Government, a number of the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s functions are explicitly defined in law, and transferring these functions to other individuals would have required further legislation. However, although the post was retained, its role in relation to the judiciary is greatly reduced and the office holder is no longer automatically Speaker of the House of Lords because of the Government&#x27;s announced intention to appoint Lord Chancellors from the House of Commons. Other measures remained generally the same as stated above.

The newly created Cabinet position of Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (originally created to wholly replace the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s executive function) continued, although the holder of that Cabinet post—renamed Secretary of State for Justice in 2007—currently also holds the office of Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor remains the custodian of the Great Seal (the bill as originally written put this into commission).

The bill was approved by both Houses on 21 March 2005, and received Royal Assent on 24 March.

==Changes resulting from the act==

The act contains provisions which reform two institutions and one former office of the United Kingdom. The document is divided into three parts: the first concerns the reform of the office of Lord Chancellor, the second creates and sets the framework for a Supreme Court, and the third regulates the appointment of judges.

=== Role of the Lord Chancellor ===
Under the new legislation, the role of the Lord Chancellor was redefined. Rather than being the head of the Judiciary in England and Wales, the role of the Lord Chancellor was changed to managing the judiciary system including the Supreme Court, county courts, magistrates&#x27; courts, and coroners&#x27; courts. In carrying out this duty, the Lord Chancellor is required to address both houses of Parliament and deliver a report as to how he or she has managed the Judiciary system.

The Lord Chief Justice replaces the Lord Chancellor as head of the English and Welsh judiciary and is also responsible for representing the views of the judiciary to the Lord Chancellor and Parliament as a whole.

The law also set out an oath of office for the Lord Chancellor to take. the Oath being: &quot;I, (name), do swear that in the office of Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain I will respect the rule of law, defend the independence of the judiciary and discharge my duty to ensure the provision of resources for the efficient and effective support of the courts for which I am responsible. So help me God.&quot;

===Supreme Court===
The establishment of a Supreme Court is the main subject of the act and it had consequences for the House of Lords and the office of Lord Chancellor. The sections contained in Part 3 prescribe that the Supreme Court be composed of 12 judges (s. 23) and that the first judges be the then-current twelve Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (s. 24). The following sections (ss. 26–31) set out the rules for the appointment of future members of the Court. Section 11 of the Supreme Court Act 1981, amended by The Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993, requires Justices of the Supreme Court to retire at age 70. Justices are appointed by the Monarch on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. On a death, or deselection approved by both houses, its selection commission consisting of the President and Deputy President of the Supreme Court (schedule 8) proposes one name to the Lord Chancellor who may reject a name only once per vacancy (since amended to Secretary of State for Justice), having a single veto. Sections 32 to 37 are entitled Terms of Appointment and deal with issues such as tenure, salaries and allowances, resignation and retirement, and pensions. Section 40 additionally sets out that the new Court will assume the jurisdiction of the House of Lords and the jurisdiction in matters of devolution of the Privy Council.

The following sections deal with practical matters such as procedures, staff, and resources of the new Court and the fees of the judges. The Chief Executive of the Supreme Court must prepare an annual report on the work and it must be presented to both Houses of Parliament (s. 51).

Although the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords is abolished, the 2005–06 serving Law Lords kept their judicial office in the new Supreme Court. Newly appointed members of the Court take no peerage, instead bearing the formal title Justice of the Supreme Court. Under the act such judges also have a courtesy title of Lord or Lady, for the expressed purpose of ensuring there is no perceived hierarchy among the JSCs.

The new Supreme Court sits in a separate building from the Houses of Parliament where the mentioned predecessor judicial committee (of the House of Lords) formerly acted as the UK&#x27;s final court of appeal. After a lengthy survey of suitable sites, including Somerset House, Parliament and the former Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department agreed to the Court&#x27;s installation in Middlesex Guildhall in Parliament Square, formerly a Crown Court building. Architect Lord Foster was chosen to design the necessary alterations. The building reopened as the Supreme Court on 1 October 2009.

===Appointment of judges===
The third part of the act is about the appointment of judges. In 1991 the Law Society had criticized the old system (the Monarch appointing judges on the advice of the Lord Chancellor), emphasizing its defects and recommending the establishment of an independent body responsible for appointing judges. The Constitutional Reform Act realized the hopes of the Law Society. Section 61 prescribed the creation of the Judicial Appointments Commission, responsible for the appointment of judges for English and Welsh courts. The following sections regulate the structure and the procedures of the Commission.

There are several criteria set out by the law in order for a person to become eligible to sit on the Supreme Court. These are:

* held high judicial office for a period of at least 2 years,
* been a qualifying practitioner for a period of at least 15 years,
* satisfied the judicial-appointment eligibility condition on a 15-year basis, or
* been a qualifying practitioner for a period of at least 15 years.
