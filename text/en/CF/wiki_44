<text>Angela Michelle Harmon (born August 10, 1972) is an American actress and model. She won &quot;Seventeen&quot;&#x27;s modeling contest in 1987 at age 15, signed with IMG Models, and appeared on covers for magazines such as &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;Esquire&quot;. Her acting breakthrough came with the role of Ryan McBride on &quot;Baywatch Nights&quot; (1995–1997), and she earned four Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for playing Abbie Carmichael on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (1998–2001). Harmon also appeared in a number of film roles, which notably include voicing Barbara Gordon in the animated &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot; (2000) and Ronica Miles in &quot;Agent Cody Banks&quot; (2003).

Following the roles of Rose in the acclaimed-film &quot;Seraphim Falls&quot; (2006) and Lindsay Boxer in the short-lived series &quot;Women&#x27;s Murder Club&quot; (2007–2008), Harmon earned praise for playing Jane Rizzoli on the TNT series &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot; (2010–2016), and won the Gracie Award for Outstanding Female Actor in a Leading Role in a Drama Series or Special in 2012 and the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Cable TV Actress in 2015. She has starred in a number of &quot;Lifetime&quot; network&#x27;s original projects, which include the biographical special &quot;Video Voyeur&quot; (2002) and the critically acclaimed feature &quot;Living Proof&quot; (2008). In 2021, she signed an exclusive multi-picture deal with &quot;Lifetime&quot;.

==Early life==
Harmon was born in the Dallas suburb of Highland Park, Texas, the daughter of Daphne Demar (&quot;née&quot; Caravageli) and Lawrence Paul &quot;Larry&quot; Harmon, a hospital information network executive in Dallas, Texas. Her father has German and Irish ancestry, while her mother is of Greek descent. In an episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, Harmon found she had a German ancestor who served in George Washington&#x27;s army during the American Revolutionary War and the ancestor later acquired land in Mercer County, Kentucky. The land is still owned by a distant branch of her family.

== Career ==
Harmon worked as a child model, and in 1987 won a &quot;Seventeen&quot; modeling contest. She attended Highland Park High School until 1990, where she was a member of the Highland Belles. She won a Spectrum Model Search contest shortly afterward, subsequently pursued a successful modeling career, and became well known in the early 1990s. She worked as a runway model for Calvin Klein, Giorgio Armani, and Donna Karan and appeared on the covers of &quot;ELLE&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, and &quot;Esquire&quot;. She is signed with IMG Models in New York City.

Harmon began acting in 1995 after being discovered on a plane by David Hasselhoff. She then had a leading role in &quot;Baywatch Nights&quot; and the short-lived &quot;C-16: FBI&quot;. She also appeared in the 1997 film &quot;Lawn Dogs&quot;, which received a limited theatrical release.

In the late 1990s, Harmon became better known when she joined the NBC series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, playing ADA Abbie Carmichael from 1998 to 2001. During this time, she also voiced Barbara Gordon in the animated film &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot;, succeeding Stockard Channing in that role. Harmon left &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; to concentrate on her film career, saying that she preferred working in film to television.

After appearing in the 2001 direct-to-video film &quot;Good Advice&quot;, she had a supporting role in &quot;Agent Cody Banks&quot; (2003), playing the CIA handler of a teenage agent (Frankie Muniz). In 2006, Harmon co-starred with Cuba Gooding Jr. and James Woods in the direct-to-DVD political suspense drama &quot;End Game&quot;, and appeared as Rose in the acclaimed Western film &quot;Seraphim Falls&quot;.

In 2006, Harmon starred in an ABC pilot &quot;Secrets of a Small Town&quot;, which did not go to series. She also starred in another failed television show on NBC, &quot;Inconceivable&quot;, which was canceled after two episodes. The following year, she starred in another ABC pilot, &quot;Women&#x27;s Murder Club&quot;, which aired for thirteen episodes. Harmon was one of five actresses who posed discreetly nude for the May 2008 issue of &quot;Allure&quot; magazine, alongside Gabrielle Union, Zoe McLellan, Jill Scott, and Ana Ortiz.

 In 2010, Harmon hosted an infomercial for &quot;UpLiv&quot;, a stress-management program, and also appeared in an infomercial for Olay &quot;Pro-X&quot; wrinkle cream. From 2010 to 2016, she co-starred with Sasha Alexander in the TNT crime-drama series &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot;, playing Boston police detective Jane Rizzoli. The show premiered July 12, 2010. She directed the series&#x27; 100th episode. Harmon won Outstanding Female Actor in a Leading Role in a Drama Series for &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot; at the 2012 Gracie Allen Awards, and also won a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Cable TV Actress in 2015.

Harmon appeared in the music video for Craig Morgan&#x27;s &quot;This Ole Boy&quot;, released in January 2012. In July 2012, during promotions for a new season of &quot;Rizzoli and Isles&quot;, Harmon revealed on Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s late night series that she was a fan of and very interested in playing a film version of She-Hulk should such a film become available.

In June 2021, Harmon had signed a multi-picture development deal with Lifetime where she hosted the documentary series &quot;Cellmate Secrets&quot; and starred as Hazel King in &quot;Buried in Barstow&quot;.

==Personal life==
On March 13, 2000, Harmon became engaged to former NFL player Jason Sehorn. She was appearing as a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; when Leno called Sehorn out as a surprise guest. Sehorn immediately walked up to her, knelt down on one knee, and proposed. They were married on June 9, 2001. They have three daughters: Finley; Avery, and Emery. In November 2014, Harmon and Sehorn announced their separation after 13 years of marriage.&lt;br&gt;

From 2019 until 2021, Harmon was engaged to actor Greg Vaughan.

<text>Commelina is a genus of approximately 170 species commonly called dayflowers due to the short lives of their flowers. They are less often known as widow&#x27;s tears. It is by far the largest genus of its family, Commelinaceae. The Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus of the 18th century named the genus after the two Dutch botanists Jan Commelijn and his nephew Caspar, each representing one of the showy petals of &quot;Commelina communis&quot;.

The dayflowers are herbs that may be either perennial or annual. They are characterised by their zygomorphic flowers and by the involucral bracts called spathes that surround the flower stalks. These spathes are often filled with a mucilaginous liquid. Each spathe houses either one or two scorpioid cymes, with the upper cyme being either vestigial or bearing from one to several typically male flowers, and the lower cyme bearing several flowers. All members of the genus have alternate leaves.

The Asiatic dayflower (&quot;Commelina communis&quot;) is probably the best known species in the West. It is a common weed in parts of Europe and throughout eastern North America. Several species, such as &quot;Commelina benghalensis&quot;, are eaten as a leaf vegetable in Southeast Asia and Africa.

==Description==

Plants in the genus are perennial or annual herbs with roots that are usually fibrous or rarely tuberous or rhizomatous. The leaves are distichous (i.e. 2-ranked) or spirally arranged with blades that either lack or have a petiole. The ptyxis, or the way the leaf is folded in the bud, is either involute (i.e. having inrolled margins) or supervolute.

The inflorescences are terminal, meaning the stem terminates with an inflorescence, and often leaf opposed, meaning it emerges at the node with a leaf of a new axillary stem. The inflorescence is composed of one or two cincinni, also called scorpioid cymes, which are monochasia (i.e. cymes with a single branched main false axis) in which the lateral branches arise alternately on opposite sides of the false axis. The distal cincinnus may either be vestigial or contain one to several flowers that are typically male. The proximal cyme is always present and is multi-flowered. The cincinni are enclosed in a folded spathe, a modified leaf, which is often filled with a mucilaginous liquid. The spathe may either have completely distinct margins or they may be fused to varying degrees at the basal end.

The flowers are borne on pedicels and are strongly zygomorphic, meaning there is only a single plane of symmetry. Bracteoles occasionally subtend the pedicels, but they are usually absent. The flowers are either bisexual or male. There are three unequal sepals, which may either be free or the two lateral ones may be fused. The petals are free and unequal with the two upper ones being larger and clawed while the lower petal is typically reduced and often differs in colour from the other two. Flower colour is most typically blue, but lilac, lavender, yellow, peach, apricot and white also occur. There are three stamens and two to three staminodes, or infertile stamens, all of which have free, glabrous filaments. The staminodes occur posteriorly and have antherodes with four to six lobes. The stamens are anterior and are longer than the staminodes. The medial stamen differs in size and form from the lateral two, and when a central staminode is present it also differs from the other staminodes. The ovaries are bi- or trilocular and one to two ovules is present per locule.

The fruit is a capsule that is typically bi- or trilocular, but in rare cases may be unilocular, and it is bi- or trivalved. The locules may contain one or two seeds, or no seed at all. The seeds are uniseriate (i.e. arranged in a single row), have a linear hilum and a lateral embryotega.

<text>Kabbe was a constituency in the Zambezi Region of Namibia. Most of the area is situated in the flood area of the Zambezi River. It contained the former German colonial residence of Schuckmannsburg (today Luhonono), as well as several other villages. Its population in 2010 was 14,979.

Following a recommendation of the &quot;Fourth Delimitation Commission of Namibia&quot;, and in preparation of the 2014 general election, the constituency was split into Kabbe South and Kabbe North.

==Politics==

Kabbe is traditionally a stronghold of the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO) party. In the 2004 regional election SWAPO candidate Peter Mwala Mwala received 3,095 of the 3,144 votes cast. In the presidential election the same year, Kabbe voted overwhelmingly for Hifikepunye Pohamba of SWAPO. Pohamba won with 3764 (96%) votes, with Ben Ulenga of the Congress of Democrats receiving 82 (2%) of the constituency&#x27;s votes.

<doc id="953111" wikidata="Q1896161" url="?curid=953111" title="Omaruru, Namibia">
<text>Omaruru is a town in the Erongo Region of central Namibia. The town has 14,000 inhabitants and encompasses of land. It is situated near Mount Erongo, on the usually dry Omaruru River. It is located on the main paved road from Swakopmund to Otjiwarongo. The name in the Otjiherero language means &#x27;bitter milk&#x27;, as Herero cattle herds used to graze on the local bush that turned their milk bitter.

Omaruru is known for its annual festival where the Herero people commemorate their past local chiefs, its winery, and for the dinosaur footprints at nearby Otjihaenamparero.

==History==
Omaruru was established in 1863 by Wilhelm Zeraua, the first chief of the &quot;White Flag&quot; clan of the OvaHerero people. In 1871, Anders Ohlsson and Axel Eriksson established a brewery at Omaruru. Eriksson had also established a trading post, which flourished and by 1878 he employed about forty whites. Eriksson&#x27;s business was based upon long-distance trading between southern Angola and the Cape Colony, which necessitated the establishment of regional trade routes.

The town grew around a mission built in 1872 by Gottlieb Viehe, now a museum, and was attacked in 1904 during the Herero Wars. Franke Tower was later erected to commemorate the relief by Hauptmann Victor Franke troops of the local Schutztruppe garrison - which had been under siege by the Herero people, who had risen against rule by the German colonial empire.

===Legacy of von Trotha===
The descendants of Lothar von Trotha and the von Trotha family travelled to Omaruru in October 2007 by invitation of the royal Herero chiefs and publicly apologised for his role in the Herero genocide. Member of the family Wolf-Thilo von Trotha: &quot;We, the von Trotha family, are deeply ashamed of the terrible events that took place a 100 years ago. Human rights were grossly abused that time&quot;.

==Dutch Reformed Church==
Omaruru Reformed Church, the local congregation of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK) was separated from that in Otjiwarongo on March 1, 1941, and included Omaruru, Karibib, Usakos, Kalkfeld, Swakopmund, and Walvis Bay as ward centers. Over the years, six congregations were in turn spun off from the Omaruru one, but the overall numbers were usually sparse given the predominantly ethnic German demographics of the local white population. At its founding, the congregation covered an area of approximately , both north to south and east to west.

==Politics==
Omaruru is governed by a municipal council that has seven seats. It is the district capital of the Omaruru Constituency.

Omaruru is one of few Namibian towns where the political opposition is relatively strong. Namibia&#x27;s ruling party SWAPO won the 2010 local authority election with 847 votes, followed by the Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) with 369 votes, the United Democratic Front (UDF) with 308 votes, and National Unity Democratic Organisation (NUDO) with 107 votes. SWAPO also was the strongest party in the 2015 local authority elections, winning four seats in the town council and gaining 1117 votes. The UDF gained two seats (590 votes), and the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) obtained one (291 votes).

In the 2020 local authority election SWAPO won again over each individual opposition party but lost the majority of seats in the city council. SWAPO obtained 642 votes and gained two seats. One seat each went to the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM, the new name of the DTA since 2017) with 403 votes, the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC, newly formed in August 2020) with 305 votes, the local Omaruru Community Development Organisation with 297 votes, the UDF with 230 votes, and NUDO with 182 votes.

==Economy and infrastructure==
Omaruru is the only Namibian town not connected to the NamWater pipeline network. It receives its water from boreholes along the Omaruru River which are managed by the municipality.

Omaruru Railway Station connects the town to the Trans-Namib railway network.

The Omaruru Correctional Facility is the smallest of Namibia&#x27;s seven major prisons.

<doc id="953112" wikidata="Q7126357" url="?curid=953112" title="Paladin's Quest">
<text>Paladin&#x27;s Quest, originally released as in Japan, is a utopian/dystopian science fantasy role-playing video game developed by Copya System and published in Japan by Asmik Corporation on November 13, 1992, for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was published in North America by Enix in October 1993. It was different from other role-playing games at the time, because when the player casts magic, it takes away HP (health points) instead of MP (magic points/power).

Its sequel, &quot;Lennus II&quot;, was only released in Japan.

==Plot==

The game centers on a boy named Chezni who, on a dare, activates an ancient machine called Dal Gren and in doing so releases a being of immense power and evil. As a result, the magic school is destroyed and the headmaster of the school orders Chezni to destroy Dal Gren at whatever cost before it destroys the world. During his travels he meets a girl named Midia, very much like himself, who wishes to help him on his quest, and numerous other mercenaries that come to aid Chezni. The main antagonist is a young dictator named Zaygos, who wants to use the Dal Gren for his own nefarious purposes.

==Gameplay==
The player character travels through dungeons, towns, and an overworld map, battling in random encounters. In case of a battle, the game switches to first person, similar to the &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; games. The battles are turn-based. Increasing a character&#x27;s speed increases the chances of acting earlier within a turn, but does not change how frequently that character&#x27;s turns come about. From each battle, characters accrue experience points, which eventually lead to higher levels, and better attributes. During battle, use of healing items usually, but not always, takes priority and occurs before the enemy can strike.

The magic system has no form of MP for the characters. Instead, characters cast spells by spending their own HP. Only one spell directly heals HP, and using it kills the caster in order to heal the rest of the party.

Instead of learning spells individually, characters unlock spells by learning to wield the powers of eight &quot;spirits&quot;: Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Sphere, Sky, Heart and Light. Each individual spirit provides a single spell, each unique pair of spirits provides an additional spell, and learning all eight unlocks an additional spell, for a total of 37. So, for example, a character who knows the &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;Sphere&quot;, and &quot;Light&quot; spirits would know six spells: one each of the three spirits and one for each of the three spirit combinations (&quot;Fire+Light&quot;, &quot;Fire+Sphere&quot; and &quot;Sphere+Light&quot;). There is no statistic which universally enhances spellcasting ability. Instead, characters gain experience in each spirit as they cast related spells; a combination spell&#x27;s power is based on both spirits it uses.

Items cannot be used from battle unless they are equipped, traditional healing spells are nonexistent, and extra healing items cannot be purchased. The primary healing items are healing &quot;bottles&quot;, which are good for nine uses each. These bottles can be refilled cheaply at most towns. The only other healing items are certain pieces of equipment which can be used as an unlimited healing item, but can only heal the wearer, and cannot be used outside of battle.

The player controls a party of up to four characters: up to two main characters, while the rest of the party slots can be filled by mercenaries. Although the player controls a mercenary&#x27;s actions in battle, the player has no control over the equipment they wear and cannot purchase spirits for them. Many mercenaries have spirits not yet available to the player, and so have spells not yet available to the main characters. Some mercenaries lack a healing bottle, making them unable to do any healing in battle. New, stronger mercenaries become available as the player progresses through the story (usually for a price), but it is up to the player whether to continue by leveling their old mercenaries, or hiring new ones. All mercenaries may be rehired, with the exception of a single mercenary tied to a story event.

==Music==
The musical score for &quot;Paladin&#x27;s Quest&quot; was composed by anime and game composer Kōhei Tanaka. A promotional MiniDisc containing 10 tracks with the game&#x27;s original music was released by Asmik under the title &quot;Welcome to the Lennus World!&quot;. A separate soundtrack titled &quot;Lennus: Memory of the Ancient Machine Original Album&quot; also contains 10 tracks, half composed of arranged instrumental medleys of the game&#x27;s music and the other half consisting of dramatic dialogue. The album was released by Future Land on December 2, 1992.

==Reception==

&quot;Paladin&#x27;s Quest&quot; received mixed to negative reviews. &quot;GamePro&quot; commented that the game &quot;feels rather stale. Its dialogue, story, transitions, settings, and even its game play seem to have been done before.&quot; They criticized the system wherein magic usage draws from the character&#x27;s pool of hit points, and found the characters in general underpowered against the game&#x27;s enemies, requiring tedious backtracking to inns and reloading of saves. Mike Weigand of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; commented, &quot;For fans of &quot;Soul Blazer&quot;, this borrows the perspective, but it isn&#x27;t as interactive plus combat isn&#x27;t as direct. Fans of these kinds of RPG games will probably be more than satisfied.&quot; Zy Nicholson reviewed the game as an import in British magazine &quot;Super Play&quot;. He commented that &quot;Paladin&#x27;s Quest&quot; is short and falls within the graphical limitations of the last-generation NES, both things which he found particularly hard to accept given the cart&#x27;s above-average size and accordingly above-average price. He also described the controls as very awkward. He concluded that fanatics of Japanese RPGs would still find the game enjoyable due to the compelling and sometimes humorous story, but warned that it does not hold up well to contemporary Japanese RPGs such as &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;.

==Sequel==

A sequel to &quot;Paladin&#x27;s Quest&quot;, , was released by Asmik Corporation for the Super Famicom in Japan only, on July 28, 1996. Enix had dropped support for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by this time.

The plot centers around a hero, Farus, who must find four orbs to avert apocalypse. He is the only character central to the player&#x27;s party; other members are recruited and may be dismissed if a superior replacement is found. The music was critically acclaimed, and two tracks were recorded by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra for release on the Orchestral Game Concert compilations.

Gameplay is fairly similar to the original &quot;Lennus&quot; / &quot;Paladin&#x27;s Quest&quot;:
* The player can swap out mercenary equipment.
* There have been some revisions to the magic system.
** There are eight spirits: Fire, Light, Wind, Gold, Earth, Sky, Water and Void, with one spell for each spirit and each pair of spirits, for 36 spells.
** Farus starts the game with three of the eight spirits, and can gain the powers of the other five through sidequests. He can only cast spells from the spirits he currently has equipped, and only has a limited number of slots (starting with only a single slot, with three more slots unlockable through sidequests for a maximum of four, allowing up to 10 of the 36 spells to be available at a time), and can only swap spirits outside of combat.
** Much like in &quot;Paladin&#x27;s Quest&quot;, each mercenary has a fixed repertoire of spirits, which are automatically equipped and cannot be swapped out.
** Instead of building up spirit skill ratings by repeatedly casting associated spells, spirits are powered up by defeating monsters, who yield a sort of spirit-specific experience points in addition to regular experience points.

<text>Jason Heath Sehorn (born April 15, 1971) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants from 1994 to 2002 and St. Louis Rams in 2003. He played college football for the USC Trojans.

==Early life==
Sehorn was born in Sacramento, California. He played only one year of high school football at Mount Shasta High School in Mount Shasta, California.

Sehorn was signed by the Chicago Cubs after just one season of playing American Legion Baseball following his senior year of high school. An outfielder, Sehorn failed to produce as a hitter, batting just .184 in 49 games in 1990 for the rookie league Huntington Cubs. Sehorn would then turn his focus to playing football.

==College career==
Sehorn played his first two years of college football at Shasta College, a junior college in Redding, California, where he was a standout wide receiver, kick returner and punt returner. He then played two years at the University of Southern California, where he was moved to defense, playing safety and cornerback.

==Professional career==
Sehorn was drafted in the second round of the 1994 NFL draft by the New York Giants. He spent most of his career playing cornerback for them.

After back-to-back successful seasons in 1996–97, Sehorn suffered a debilitating knee injury, tearing his anterior cruciate (ACL) and medial collateral ligaments (MCL) while returning the opening kickoff in a 1998 preseason game against the New York Jets. Though Sehorn returned the next season, his speed was diminished. Still, he started 73 games for the Giants at cornerback in six seasons played from 1996 to 2002. He represented the Giants in Super Bowl XXXV.

The Giants released Sehorn on March 7, 2003, and in May of that year, he signed with the St. Louis Rams as a safety. He missed the first six games of the season with a broken foot, but played in the last ten. The next year, his contract with the Rams was terminated after he failed a physical examination before the start of the 2004 season.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Playoffs===
==In media==
Sehorn participated in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Superstars&quot; competition during the NFL offseason. As a testament to his athleticism, he won the competition three consecutive years from 1998 to 2000.

In 2005, Sehorn joined Fox Sports Net, where he was a panelist on their Sunday NFL pregame show.

Sehorn is also a college football analyst for ESPNU. He joined the network in 2011 as the in-studio analyst for Thursday and Saturday night games on ESPNU.

Sehorn is now the Director of Communications at the Hendrick Automotive Group in Charlotte, North Carolina, an automotive retailer in the United States.

==Personal life==
Sehorn was briefly married to former CNN correspondent Whitney Casey from February 14, 1998, until their divorce in 1999. His marriage to actress Angie Harmon is well known due to his unusual and public proposal. During one of Harmon&#x27;s appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, Sehorn (with the assistance of host Jay Leno) hid backstage and surprised Harmon by getting on one knee and asking for her hand in marriage in front of a live studio audience and millions more watching on television. They were married on June 9, 2001. They have three daughters: Finley, born October 14, 2003; Avery, born June 22, 2005; and Emery, born December 18, 2008. Both publicly support the Republican Party. The couple announced in November 2014 that they were separating after 13 years of marriage, and divorced in December 2015. Sehorn remarried, to fire equipment heiress Meghann Gunderman, in 2017. They have a daughter named Sage.

On January 19, 1999, Sehorn&#x27;s high school jersey #1 was retired by his alma mater, Mt. Shasta High School, in a ceremony hosted by his longtime friend, mentor, and former coach, Joe Blevins. The ceremony aired on local cable television.

<text>Karibib () is a town in the Erongo Region of western Namibia. It has 8,434 inhabitants. Karibib is the district capital of the Karibib electoral constituency. It is situated on the Khan River, halfway between Windhoek and Swakopmund on the B2 (Trans-Kalahari Highway), the main road between Walvis Bay and Johannesburg. The town is known for its aragonite marble quarries and the Navachab Gold Mine.

==Geography==
Karibib comprises of town land.

== Economy and Infrastructure ==

The Navachab Gold Mine owned by QKR Namibia is located 10 km from Karibib town. The mine is the major tax payer, employer and property owner of the town, providing more than 750 jobs and owning 240 residential properties. In 2008, proposals surfaced for a new cement works.

Karibib is home to the Usab Stadium. and there is a golf course at the Klippenberg Country Club.

=== Transport ===
Karibib is situated on the B2 national road (Walvis Bay–Okahandja) close to the branch-off of the C33 to Otjiwarongo. About 1,000 trucks per day pass the town.

Karibib is connected to the TransNamib railway network; Karibib Railway Station is situated downtown. The next station to the west is Kranzberg, the junction for the branch railways to Tsumeb and Grootfontein from the line to the capital Windhoek.

North of the town is the location of the headquarters of the Namibian Air Force at the Karibib Air Base, housing the Command of the Air Force. The air base has a asphalt runway, parallel paved taxiways and apron. The history of Karibib Airport goes back to pre-independence when it was used by the South African Air Force.

==History==
Originally Karibib was a waterhole known to the Herero under the name &quot;Otjandjomboimwe&quot;. Expecting business opportunities arising from the railway construction between Swakopmund and Windhoek, Eduard Hälbich, merchant at Otjimbingwe, bought the waterhole and 20,000 hectares of land surrounding it from Herero headman Zacharias Zeraua. The deal was finalised on 7 January 1895, the purchase price was 22,500 marks (ℳ), two ox wagons, and 742 pounds 5 shillings that Zeraua had incurred in debts in Hälbich&#x27;s shop in Otjimbingwe.

Karibib began to grow quickly when on 30 May 1900 the railway construction reached the newly founded place. 1 June 1900 marks the day of the official foundation of Karibib at the occasion of the first train arriving from Swakopmund. The railway station was built, a medical practice, storage facilities, a prison, and living quarters were erected, and the population rose to 274. This development disadvantaged the settlement of Otjimbingwe; ox wagons that before would travel via Otjimbingwe on the Alter Baiweg (&quot;Old bay path&quot;) would now take the route through Karibib.

In 1904 the place once again became important as a railway hub for ferrying troops in the Herero and Namaqua War. Its status was upgraded to that of a county, and governance was extended to include Omaruru. At the end of the war in 1907, Karibib counted 316 white residents, and the remaining Herero land was expropriated and offered to white farmers. Karibib was declared a municipality in 1909, and Eduard Hälbich was its mayor.

===Historic Buildings===

One of Karibib&#x27;s oldest buildings is the Roesemannhaus / &quot;Roesemann&#x27;s house&quot;, erected in 1900 shortly after the town was founded. Other historic structures are the Wollhaus / &quot;Wool house (&quot;1900) erected from local marble, the Railway station building (1901), the Kaiserbrunnen / &quot;Emperor fountain (1&quot;906-1908) and the Christ Church (1910).

==Politics==
Karibib was downgraded from municipal to town status in 2010. It is governed by a town council that has seven seats.

In the 2010 local authority election in Karibib, a total of 990 votes were cast. SWAPO won with approximately 60% of the vote. Of the three other parties seeking votes in the election, United Democratic Front (UDF) received approximately 31% of the vote, followed by RDP (9%) and the Congress of Democrats, which, despite being on the ballot, did not receive a vote. SWAPO also won the 2015 local authority elections, gaining 4 seats (653 votes). 2 seats went to the UDF (223 votes), and the remaining seat was won by the local Karibib Residents Association (KRA) that gained 128 votes.

In the 2020 local authority election SWAPO won again by a large margin but lost the majority of seats in the town council. SWAPO obtained 461 votes and gained three seats. One seat each went to the UDF (175 votes), the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC, newly formed in August 2020, 94 votes), the Landless People&#x27;s Movement (LPM, registered in 2018, 80 votes) and the KRA (68 votes).

==Education==
Schooling in Karibib started as a private missionary enterprise in 1902. From 1907 the Deutsche Schule Karibib (, also: Privatschule Karibib) operated in town, first as a government school of Imperial Germany, and after World War I as private school supported by German government. In 1965 it had 13 teachers and 53 learners. When competition from other German schools eroded its pupil base, the school closed down in 1986. The campus is currently leased to the similarly named but unrelated Karibib Private School.

Karibib is also home to Karibib Junior Secondary School and Ebenhaeser Primary School, situated in the Usab Location. Karibib Junior Secondary School emerged from Ebenhaeser Primary School when the latter started offering classes beyond grade 7. The Navachab gold mine in Karibib has played a major role in developing the school. Karibib Junior Secondary School is situated in town and offers grade 8 to Grade 10.

<text>is a sardonic term which refers to the reluctance to use words that are considered potentially offensive or politically incorrect in the Japanese language. For instance words such as , , , , &quot;kichigai&quot; ( or , &quot;crazy&quot;), , and are currently not used by the majority of Japanese publishing houses; the publishers often refuse to publish writing which includes these words.

Another example is that a school janitor in Japan used to be called a . Some felt that the word had a derogatory meaning, so it was changed to . Now &quot;yōmuin&quot; is considered demeaning, so there is a shift to use or instead. This pattern of change is an example of the linguistic phenomenon known as the &quot;euphemism treadmill&quot;.

Other examples of words which have become unacceptable include the replacement of the word for &quot;farmer&quot; with . 

Since World War II, the word &quot;Shina&quot; () for China written in kanji has been recognized as derogatory, and has been largely superseded by the Japanese pronunciation of the endonym, , or with &quot;Shina&quot; written in katakana ().

In the 1960s, the Sino-Japanese word meaning &quot;Mongol&quot; was recognized for its connotation of a &quot;stupid, ignorant, or immature&quot; person (compare the English term &quot;Mongoloid&quot;), and the ethnic group is now referred to by the katakana term .

==&quot;Kotobagari&quot; and ideology==

&quot;Kotobagari&quot; has led to some confusing terminology.

NHK, the Japanese Broadcasting Company, runs a Korean language study program, but the language is referred to as &quot;Hangul&quot;. This is a result of both the North and South Korean governments demanding that the language be called by their respective preferred name of Korea suffixed with &quot;language&quot; (). North Korea wanted the show to be called &quot;Chōsen-go&quot; or &quot;&quot;Chōsen&quot; language&quot; (), taken from the Japanese pronunciation of the full name of North Korea, or &quot;Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea&quot;. South Korea wanted &quot;Kankoku-go&quot; or &quot;&quot;Kankoku&quot; language&quot; () from or &quot;Republic of Korea&quot;. 

As a compromise, &quot;Hangul&quot; was selected and Korean is referred to as &quot;the language on this program&quot; or &quot;this language&quot;, but this has led to the use of the neologism &quot;Hangul language&quot; () to refer to the Korean language, which is technically incorrect since hangul itself is a writing system, not a language.

<text>Sixth sense or variants may refer to:
* Biological senses other than the five traditionally understood in many cultures — taste, smell, touch, sound, &amp; sight. Some are internal, for example our sense of balance, or sense of pain or spatial orientation. Animals can also have senses for temperature, for echolocation, electric and/or magnetic fields, moisture, polarized light, and other phenomena.

* Extrasensory perception (ESP) — narrowly this refers to psychic powers, or even more specifically to mind-reading. More generally, it can refer to any sensing modality which is seen as super-human, whether it is explainable by science or not.

<doc id="953135" wikidata="Q1276781" url="?curid=953135" title="Mashing">
<text>In brewing and distilling, mashing is the process of combining ground grain – malted barley and sometimes supplementary grains such as corn, sorghum, rye, or wheat (known as the &quot;grain bill&quot;) – with water and then heating the mixture. Mashing allows the enzymes in the malt (primarily, α-amylase and β-amylase) to break down the starch in the grain into sugars, typically maltose to create a malty liquid called wort.

The two main methods of mashing are infusion mashing, in which the grains are heated in one vessel, and decoction mashing, in which a proportion of the grains are boiled and then returned to the mash, raising the temperature.

Mashing involves pauses at certain temperatures (notably ) and takes place in a &quot;mash tun&quot; – an insulated brewing vessel with a false bottom.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;mashing&quot; probably originates from the Old English noun &quot;masc&quot;, which means &quot;soft mixture&quot;, and the Old English verb &quot;mæscan,&quot; which means &quot;to mix with hot water&quot;. Usage of the term to refer to &quot;anything reduced to a soft, pulpy consistency&quot; is recorded as early as the late 16th century. The end product is called a &quot;mash&quot;.

==Infusion mashing==
Most breweries use infusion mashing, in which the mash is heated directly to go from rest temperature to rest temperature. Some infusion mashes achieve temperature changes by adding hot water, and some breweries do single-step infusions, performing only one rest before lautering.

==Decoction mashing==
Decoction mashing involves boiling a portion of the grains and then returning them to the mash, raising the temperature. The boiling extracts more starches from the grains by breaking down the cell walls. It can be classified into one-, two-, and three-step decoctions, depending on how many times part of the mash is drawn off to be boiled. Decoction is a traditional method and is common in German and Central European breweries. It was used out of necessity before the invention of thermometers allowed for simpler step mashing, but the practice is still in use for many traditional beers because of the unique malty flavor it lends to the end product. Boiling part of the grain results in Maillard reactions, which create melanoidins that create rich, malty flavors.

==Mash tun==
To achieve economies of scale, large breweries often possess at least one dedicated vessel for mashing, called a &quot;mash tun&quot;. Breweries implementing a decoction process must possess at least two dedicated vessels. 

Mash tuns have a powerful stirring mechanism, known as a mash rake, to keep the temperature of the mash uniform. They also have an efficient heating method, often based on steam, that will not scorch the malt. This heating method is combined with proper insulation enabling mash to maintain rest temperatures for up to one hour inside the vessels. A spray ball for clean-in-place (CIP) operation helps with periodic deep cleaning. Sanitation is not a major concern before wort boiling, so a rinse-down is usually all that is necessary between batches.

Smaller breweries often use a boil kettle or a lauter tun for mashing. Using a lauter tun limits the breweries to single-step infusion mashing, however, because such a vessel is not completely appropriate for the lautering process[cite?].

==Mashing-in==
Mixing of the strike water used for mashing in and milled grist must be done in a way that minimizes clumping and oxygen uptake. This was traditionally done by first adding water to the mash vessel and then introducing the grist from the top of the vessel in a thin stream, but this led to a lot of oxygen absorption and loss of flour dust to the surrounding air. A premasher, which mixes the grist with mash-in temperature water while it&#x27;s still in the delivery tube, reduces oxygen uptake and prevents dust from being lost.

Mashing in – sometimes called &quot;doughing-in&quot; – is typically done between , but for single-step infusion mashes, mashing in must be done between for amylases to break down the grain&#x27;s starch into sugars. The weight-to-weight ratio of strike water and grain varies from one-half for dark beers in single-step infusions to one-quarter or even one-fifth ratios that are more suitable for light-colored beers and decoction mashing, where much of the mash water is boiled off.

==Enzymatic rests==

In step infusion and decoction mashing, the mash is heated to different temperatures to allow specific enzymes to work optimally. The table at right shows the optimal temperature ranges for key enzymes and what materials those enzymes break down. There is some contention in the brewing industry as to the optimal temperatures for these enzymes, as it is often very dependent on the pH of the mash and its thickness. A thicker mash acts as a buffer for the enzymes. Once a step is complete, the enzymes active in that step are denatured by the increasing heat and become permanently inactive. The time spent transitioning between rests is preferably as short as possible; however, if the temperature is raised more than 1 °C per minute, enzymes may be prematurely denatured in the transition layer near the heating elements.

===β-Glucanase rest===
β-glucan is a general term for polysaccharides, such as cellulose, made up of chains of glucose molecules connected by beta glycosidic bonds, as opposed to the alpha glycosidic bonds in starch. They are a major constituent of the cell walls of plants and make up a large part of the bran in grains. A β-glucanase rest done at is practiced in order to break down cell walls and make starches more available, thus raising the extraction efficiency. Should the brewer let this rest go on too long, it&#x27;s possible that a large amount of β-glucan will dissolve into the mash, which could lead to a stuck mash on brew day and cause filtration problems later in beer production.

===Protease rest===
Protein degradation via a proteolytic rest plays many roles: production of free-amino nitrogen (FAN) for yeast nutrition, freeing of small proteins from larger proteins for foam stability in the finished product, and reduction of haze-causing proteins for easier filtration and increased beer clarity. In all-malt beers, the malt already provides enough protein for good head retention, and the brewer needs to ensure the amount of FAN produced can be metabolized by the yeast to avoid off flavors. The haze causing proteins are also more prevalent in all-malt beers, and the brewer must strike a balance between breaking down these proteins and limiting FAN production.

===Amylase rests===
The amylase rests are responsible for the production of free fermentable and non-fermentable sugar from starch in a mash. Starch is an enormous molecule made up of branching chains of glucose molecules.

β-amylase breaks down these chains from the end molecules, forming links of two glucose molecules, i.e. maltose. β-amylase cannot break down the branch points, although some help is found here through low α-amylase activity and enzymes such as limit dextrinase. The maltose will be the yeast&#x27;s main food source during fermentation. During this rest, starches also cluster together forming visible bodies in the mash. This clustering eases the lautering process.

The α-amylase rest is also known as the saccharification rest. During this rest, the α-amylase breaks down the starches from the inside and starts cutting off links of glucose that are one to four glucose molecules in length. The longer glucose chains, sometimes called dextrins or maltodextrins, along with the remaining branched chains give body and fullness to the beer.

Because of the closeness in temperatures of peak activity of an α-amylase (63-70 °C) and β-amylase (55-65 °C), the two rests are often performed at once with the time and temperature of the rest determining the ratio of fermentable to non-fermentable sugars in the wort and, hence, the final sweetness of the fermented drink.

A hotter rest results in a fuller-bodied, sweeter beer as α-amylase produces more non-fermentable sugars. is a typical rest temperature for a pale ale or German pilsener, while Bohemian pilsener and mild ale are typically rested at .

===Decoction &quot;rests&quot;===
In decoction mashing, part of the mash is taken out of the mash tun and placed in a cooker, where it is boiled for a period of time. This caramelizes some of the sugars, giving the beer a deeper flavor and color, and frees more starches from the grain, making for a more efficient extraction from the grains. The portion drawn off for decoction is calculated so the next rest temperature is reached by simply putting the boiled portion back into the mash tun. Before drawing off for decoction, the mash is allowed to settle a bit, and the thicker part is typically taken out for decoction, as the enzymes have dissolved in the liquid, and the starches to be freed are in the grains, not the liquid. This thick mash is then boiled for around 15 minutes and returned to the mash tun.

The mash cooker used in decoction should not scorch the mash, but maintaining a uniform temperature in the mash is not a priority. To prevent a scorching of the grains, the brewer must continuously stir the decoction and apply slow heating. A decoction mash brings out a higher malt profile from the grains and is typically used in Bock or Doppelbock beers.

==Mash-out==
After the enzyme rests, the mash is raised to its mash-out temperature. This frees up about 2% more starch and makes the mash less viscous, allowing the lauter to process faster. Although mash temperature and viscosity are roughly inversely proportional, the ability of brewers and distillers to use this relationship is constrained by the fact that α-Amylase quickly denatures above . Any starches extracted once the mash is brought above this temperature cannot be broken down and will cause a starch haze in the finished product. In larger quantities, an unpleasantly harsh flavor can develop. Therefore, the mash-out temperature rarely exceeds .

If the lauter tun is a separate vessel from the mash tun, the mash is transferred to the lauter tun at this time. If the brewery has a combination mash-lauter tun, the agitator is stopped after mash-out temperature is reached and the mash has mixed enough to ensure a uniform temperature.

<text>The Samsung SPH-i500 was a Palm OS-based smartphone manufactured by Samsung Electronics. It was previewed at CommunicAsia 2002 in June and launched later that year. It was later discontinued in August 2005.
It was marketed in the United States for use on Sprint&#x27;s mobile phone network.

The CDMA phone has a clamshell-style design, with the 160×240 pixel color display on the top half, and the Graffiti area and telephone keypad on the bottom half. 
It operates like a standard color Palm OS device, but several hard (external) and software-imbedded buttons launch the &#x27;phone&#x27; application, which manages calls.
Once a call is connected, it is possible to switch back to another application. Despite the Graffiti interface, the device could not send text messages, though it could receive them.

The phone shipped with an extra battery and extra stylus. The supplied power cable could be used as a travel charger or to plug into the included cradle, which could charge the phone and an extra battery simultaneously. Despite two batteries, the phone needed to be plugged in regularly. Swapping charged batteries would eventually result in a phone reset---a complete loss of user data.

==Specifications==
* Processor: Dragonball 66 MHz
* Weight: 130 g
* Operating System: Palm OS 4.1
* RAM: 16 MB

==Applications==
Applications include the Handspring Blazer microbrowser and Voice Memo, but exclude Palm OS Note Pad. Shortly after the i500 was discontinued, Handspring discontinued proxy
service for the Blazer browser. Sprint provided a free install of
Novarra&#x27;s nweb browser as a replacement. This browser was functional
on the i500 until its proxy was taken down in 2008.

Installed applications included ones carried over from existing Palm handheld non-phone devices:
In addition, applications to support voice and data communications were included:
Note that the Voicemail application was not a distinct executable, but rather aliased directly to the Voicemail category in the Messages application.

==History==
The SPH-i500 is the last Palm-OS-based smartphone to use a clamshell design and employ Graffiti input. It is the only clamshell to use the upper block for the display, and the lower for input. Its successors use a brick form phone and a keypad for input.

Samsung developed a follow-on Palm OS smartphone with multimedia features, the SPH-i550, but Sprint canceled it.

==Reviews==
CNET gave it 4/5, praising it as a good integration of Palm PDA and phone, but criticised its price and lack of expansion slot. PCMag gave it 4/5, a rating of &quot;excellent&quot;, also praising it as a phone that unites PDA and phone with few compromises. It was also well-reviewed by Mobile Tech Review.

<text>Keetmanshoop Urban is a constituency in the ǁKaras Region of Namibia. It comprises the city of Keetmanshoop, except the Krönlein suburb, covering an area of . It had a population of 19,447 in 2011, up from 15,777 in 2001. the constituency had 12,569 registered voters, up from 11,534 in 2019.

==Politics==
Keetmanshoop Rural is traditionally a stronghold of the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO) party.

===Regional and local elections===
In the 2004 regional elections, Hilma Nicanor (SWAPO) was elected with 1,872 of the 3,803 votes cast.

In the 2015 regional elections Councillor Nicanor (SWAPO) was again reelected with 2,291 votes. She defeated challengers Fredrik Kuhlmann of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 551 votes) and Peter John Visser of the Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP, 378 votes). After councillor Nicanor was fielded as a parliamentary candidate in the 2019 Namibian general election, a by-election became necessary for Keetmannshoop Urban because Namibian electoral law prohibits sitting councillors and members of the public service to run for a seat in parliament.

The by-election was conducted on 15 January 2020. Maxie Minnaar of the Landless People&#x27;s Movement (LPM, a new party registered in 2018) won with 1,958 votes, followed by Festus Shilimela (SWAPO, 1,306 votes) and Abraham ǀGoagoseb (Popular Democratic Movement, 292 votes). Minnaar died in August 2020. Considering that the next regional election was only months away, the Electoral Commission of Namibia decided to keep the councillor position vacant until then. The 2020 regional election was also won by the LPM. Its candidate Joseph Isaacks obtained 3,016 votes, well ahead of the SWAPO candidate Emrico Blaauw who came second with 1,849 votes.

<text>In mathematics, the Lagrange reversion theorem gives series or formal power series expansions of certain implicitly defined functions; indeed, of compositions with such functions.

Let &quot;v&quot; be a function of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in terms of another function &quot;f&quot; such that
:formula_1
Then for any function &quot;g&quot;, for small enough &quot;y&quot;:
:formula_2
If &quot;g&quot; is the identity, this becomes
:formula_3

In which case the equation can be derived using perturbation theory.

In 1770, Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736–1813) published his power series solution of the implicit equation for &quot;v&quot; mentioned above. However, his solution used cumbersome series expansions of logarithms. In 1780, Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827) published a simpler proof of the theorem, which was based on relations between partial derivatives with respect to the variable x and the parameter y. Charles Hermite (1822–1901) presented the most straightforward proof of the theorem by using contour integration.

Lagrange&#x27;s reversion theorem is used to obtain numerical solutions to Kepler&#x27;s equation.

==Simple proof==
We start by writing:

:formula_4

Writing the delta-function as an integral we have:

:formula_5

The integral over &quot;k&quot; then gives formula_6 and we have:

:formula_7

Rearranging the sum and cancelling then gives the result:

:formula_8

<text>Berseba is a constituency in the ǁKaras Region of Namibia. The main settlement is Berseba. the constituency had 6,659 registered voters.

Berseba constituency covers an area of and contains the Brukkaros crater and the settlements of Snyfontein, Helmeringhausen, Tses, Bethanie, and Goageb. It had a population of 10,589 in 2011, up from 9,064 in 2001. The first diamonds in Namibia were found in this area in 1898, while oil was found in 1929.

==Politics==
Berseba Constituency is traditionally a stronghold of the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO) party. In the 2004 regional elections, former parliamentarian Dawid Boois (SWAPO) was elected with 1,724 of the 3,591 votes cast. Boois, by then governor of ǁKaras, was reelected in the 2010 regional elections with 1,225 votes. He defeated challengers Aron Lucas Stephanus of RDP (558 votes), Regina Kuhlman of Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 397 votes), Hendrik Christiaan Humphries of the Democratic Party of Namibia (DP, 296 votes) and Bernardt Barry Stephanus of Congress of Democrats (CoD, 126 votes). 

Boois was again reelected in the 2015 regional elections with 1,774 votes. Diederik Isaak Vries of the DTA obtained 901 votes, and Trougot Metusalag Kaffer of the RDP obtained 148 votes. The 2020 regional election was won by Jeremias Gooieman of the Landless People&#x27;s Movement (LPM, a new party registered in 2018). He obtained 1,822 votes. The SWAPO candidate, Steve Sensus Ovambo, came second with 1,127 votes.

<doc id="953151" wikidata="Q3641186" url="?curid=953151" title="Blue Water (missile)">
<text>Blue Water was a British battlefield nuclear missile of the early 1960s, intended to replace the MGM-5 Corporal, which was becoming obsolete. With roughly the same role and range as Corporal, the solid-fuel Blue Water was far simpler to use and would be significantly easier to support in the field. It was seen as a replacement for Corporal both in the UK as well as other NATO operators, notably Germany and possibly Turkey.

The design traces its history to the shorter-ranged but otherwise similar Red Rose design of 1954. In 1958, significantly changed requirements led to it being renamed despite the missile itself remaining almost unchanged. The Blue Water missile entered testing in 1962 was generally successful, and praised in the industry. However, when Germany purchased the MGM-29 Sergeant instead of Blue Water, and it appeared Turkey would do the same, the UK government decided to cancel its development instead of continuing to develop a missile that would be used only by their own forces.

&quot;Red Rose&quot; and &quot;Blue Water&quot; were code names assigned randomly by the Ministry of Supply based on their Rainbow Code system.

==History==

=== Origins ===
In the late World War II period, the British Army formed the Guided Weapons Committee to consider their needs for missile weapons. They identified seven designs of interest, mostly surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles. In the surface-to-surface role, they identified the need for three nuclear armed weapons, for short, medium and long range use. Given the general feeling that another war was at least ten years off, and the poor post-war economy, little work on these plans was carried out.

The opening of the Cold War led to new priorities, and by 1954 the missiles were once again being seriously considered. By this time, it was decided that the short-range mission was to be filled by a new nuclear artillery shell, Yellow Anvil, leaving only the two longer-range designs. English Electric (EE) won the initial contract for a design study on the long range weapon, which became known as Black Rock under the Ministry of Supply&#x27;s Rainbow Code system. The project was abandoned, with observers suggesting it was due to its role overlapping with the Royal Air Forces deep strike mission which they considered their own.

===Red Rose===
In November 1954, English Electric was also handed a development contract for the medium-range missile. This was given the code name Red Rose in August 1956. Leslie Bedford, Director of Engineering at EE&#x27;s Stevenage division, initially proposed adapting their Red Shoes surface-to-air missile (SAM) for this role. Red Shoes became known as Thunderbird when it entered service with the Army in 1959. The modified design was referred to as the 30-mile RS Conversion, but may have also been known as Red Herring, although whether this an official Rainbow Code or simply a nickname is not known.

Given the much heavier warhead compared to the one used in the anti-aircraft role, the RS conversion required extra thrust for takeoff. To supply this, it added two more of the Gosling solid fuel rocket boosters for a total of six. Like Red Shoes, the missile was mounted on a transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) towed by a Bedford RLHC truck and then raised to about 45 degrees for launch. For guidance, they proposed using the AA No. 3 Mk. 7 gun laying radar to accurately measure its trajectory during launch and compare that to a pre-computed path and send corrections via radio. The War Ministry was not impressed, having found that Red Shoes was difficult to maneuver during transit with four boosters and concerned that six would make it even more difficult, especially as the fins on the boosters had to be enlarged to provide more stability for the heavier missile.

Unknown to either EE or the Army at the time, Vickers also began development of a weapon to fill the same role, the &quot;35 mile Artillery Weapon System&quot;. Their design was a single-stage solid fuel rocket in a dedicated TEL. The initial design was to make the TEL look like a normal trailer and haul it as a semi-trailer, which would allow it to be hidden among motor pool vehicles. A later proposal used a dedicated single-piece TEL with its own prime mover fixed to the trailer. Although initially interested, the Army eventually decided against it because it flew at the relatively slow speed of and reached an altitude of only , which would allow it to be attacked by SAMs.

The final entry was from Bristol, the &quot;RP.15&quot;, which, like EE, proposed an adapted version of their existing Red Duster missile, later known as Bloodhound. It is unclear whether this was seriously considered for the role.

===New Red Rose===
In 1956 the Corporal missile had been adopted by the Royal Artillery as a battlefield tactical nuclear missile, filling much the same role as Red Rose. This missile was liquid-fuelled, and required a large convoy of support vehicles to prepare it for launch, which was a slow process. It also required continual command guidance in flight, yet only achieved relatively poor accuracy. Also in use within the Royal Artillery was the Honest John rocket. This was solid-fuelled and could be launched rapidly, but was unguided and had only short range. There was a clear requirement for a missile that would combine the range of the Corporal, the ease-of-use and rapid reaction of Honest John, and a new guidance system with higher accuracy than either.

EE had won the contract for servicing both of these missiles in the field, and it was no surprise when the Army turned to them to consider a proposal to fill a new Red Rose. EE returned a new design, sometimes referred to as &quot;Red Rock Ab Initio&quot;, using a single larger rocket engine. The missile would be carried on a AEC Militant converted as a TEL, but the launch pad was separate, towed behind the TEL on a small trailer. For launch, the trailer was dropped to the ground and the TEL backed up and used hydraulic rams to lift the missile to vertical and sit it on the pad. After launch, as the thrust dropped, a set of stabilizing fins at the extreme rear would drop off to improve aerodynamics, as they were only needed during launch when the missile was flying at slower speeds.

===Corps Support Rocket, Blue Water===
In 1958, the Army changed the requirements for the system, demanding it be air-portable. They later extended the range to a desired . A new Operational Requirement was released, A5077, for a &quot;short-range corps support weapon&quot; that was solid-fuelled with autonomous guidance and requiring only simple support equipment for launch. It also took advantage of the shrinking dimensions and weight of nuclear warheads and so only required a much smaller payload.

Given the lighter warheads, Red Rose could meet the range requirements without any changes to the rocket. But the two-part TEL was a problem as it would not fit into the RAF&#x27;s standard Argosy transport aircraft. EE responded by making relatively small modifications to their last Red Rose proposal. The missile remained largely the same, but reshaped the wings and control fins removed the drop-off fins. The major change was to the TEL, which was now a single vehicle based on the Bedford LRHC. As the missile now flew beyond the radar horizon, it was guided entirely through an inertial platform. After being raised, the missile was carefully levelled using a built-in theodolite and then the trajectory was calculated using a computer in an accompanying Land Rover. 

The changes were significant enough to grant it a new name, &quot;Blue Water&quot;. The resulting design was significantly similar to the later MGM-52 Lance that would fill the same role in the US Army in the 1970s.

=== Development ===
A suitable warhead of 10 kiloton began development at Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWRE). Codenamed ‘Tony’, this was a UK version of the US W44 Tsetse primary. The Propellant and Explosives Research and Manufacturing Establishment (PERME) developed the solid rocket motor based on the successful Cuckoo originally developed for the Black Knight experimental rocket. The engines were built by Bristol Siddeley Engines Ltd. It gave a thrust of . Initial testing of the engine suggested it would be underpowered, and in 1959 the Ministry of Supply issued a contract to Bristol Aerojet for a new design.

The first test vehicle flew in 1960 from Aberporth followed by full-range trials at Woomera.

=== Cancellation ===
Initial hopes for Blue Water had been optimistic, seeing it as a NATO-wide replacement for the clearly obsolete Corporal. The anticipated customer was the West German Bundeswehr, but there were serious expectations that this would become standard equipment across NATO. There was even the possibility of sales to the non-NATO Switzerland, which would be equipped with a French warhead instead. To improve the chances of sales into Europe, the weapon was the first UK design to be dimensioned in metric.

The US replacement for Corporal was the Sergeant. Sergeant was solid-fuelled and generally comparable to Blue Water, although it was more complex and slower to operate and, like Corporal, still required a train of semi-trailer vehicles. It was however promised for delivery in 1961. In 1960 West Germany agreed to buy Sergeant rather than to wait for Blue Water. As this represented the other major customer for Blue Water, and also the likelihood that other potential customers such as Turkey and Italy would then follow this American path, the sales prospects for Blue Water became bleak.

The programme was cancelled on 10 August 1962, as the UK government, whilst still wishing to purchase the missile, was no longer willing to fund the entire development costs itself. The total costs were estimated at around £32.1 million. Additional funding already earmarked for Blue Water was instead directed to TSR-2. This, and other similar cancellations in this period, were a source of considerable criticism for years to come.

At the time, it was suggested that the cancellation was also the outcome of a successful program to better integrate the RAF and Army. The program, started in 1960, aimed to improve air-ground coordination, allowing RAF aircraft to be used more effectively in the close-support role. Blue Water was, to a large degree, a replacement for long-range artillery, a role that was easily fulfilled by the RAF&#x27;s TSR-2, as long as those aircraft were available to the Army on a timely basis. The need for missile artillery was replaced by the immediate availability of flying artillery. This suggestion is backed by public comments at the time of the cancellation; &quot;there are plenty of nuclear weapons in Europe already, and that TSR.2 could cover many of the targets the army had in mind for Blue Water&quot;.

Solly Zuckerman, the Chief Scientific Adviser to the incoming Minister of Defense Peter Thorneycroft, was not asked for his opinion on the system. He did, however, readily offer it to the press, stating &quot;My own view, which I made perfectly clear, was that Blue Water should go. While I recognized that PT.428 was highly ambitious from a technical point of view, it made more sense to spend such money as was available on a system that had some ostensible military purpose, rather than on one that I thought had none.&quot; His concerns were mostly based on the feeling that any use of nuclear weapons on the battlefield would quickly lead to outright nuclear war, so Blue Water&#x27;s contribution to the outcome would be close to nothing. In contrast, the PT.428, a rapid-firing SAM missile battery also being developed by EE, had a clear military purpose of attacking enemy tactical aircraft in any war situation, nuclear or not. By this time, however, the War Office had been offered the choice of cancelling PT.428 or Blue Water. The Army decided to cancel the former to save the latter, leaving EE with no ongoing project when both were ultimately cancelled.

=== Air-launched stand-off variant ===
A number of references claim that a version of Blue Water was designed for air-launch by the TSR-2 strike aircraft in the stand-off attack role. The modifications were relatively minor, tapering the rear fuselage and adding a cowling over the rocket nozzle to reduce drag in flight. The fairing would be blown off by the rocket motor when fired. Top secret MoD papers since released reveal that an air-launched version of Blue Water was considered for development, but this development clearly never proceeded, and the project had been abandoned by the time the TSR.2 was cancelled in 1965.

==Description==
This missile was in length 610 mm diameter and weighed-in at . The fuselage was cylindrical with a tapered nose, without the swelling required for previous large diameter nuclear warheads. The control surfaces were small and of typical English Electric form: four rear fins and four daggerboard shaped all-moving control surfaces at mid-length, indexed at 45° to the tail fins. Guidance was inertial and once aligned before launch, entirely autonomous in flight.

The transporter erector launcher was a modified Bedford RL lorry. Additional launch equipment consisted of an early electronic computer, carried in a Land Rover, together with an alignment theodolite. Missiles were normally to be held under cover until a few minutes before launch, whereupon they would be moved to their launch position and the stabilising jacks beneath the lorry placed in position. These launch positions had been surveyed immediately beforehand, so as to be aligned directly at the target.

Prior to launch, the launch computer was connected to the missile by an umbilical cable. The same theodolite was used to align the on-board gyroscopes before launch and the flight plan settings for the missile were downloaded to it. The launch control vehicle could then move on to prepare another launcher within the battery. Only immediately before launch was the missile raised on its launcher and then fired. Each missile required a remarkably small crew of two, not counting the battery survey team, to operate it.

<doc id="953171" wikidata="Q1439417" url="?curid=953171" title="ǃNamiǂNûs Constituency">
<text>ǃNamiǂNûs (; until 2013 Lüderitz) is an electoral constituency in the ǁKaras Region of Namibia. It covers an area of and contains the major town of Lüderitz, after which the constituency was originally named. In 2011, it had a population of 13,859, down from 14,542 in 2001. the constituency had 9,670 registered voters.

==Politics==
ǃNamiǂNûs Constituency is traditionally a stronghold of the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO) party. In the 2004 regional elections, its candidate David Shoombe was elected with 4,135 of the 4,468 votes cast. In the 2010 regional elections, Jan Albertus Scholtz (SWAPO) won the constituency with 3,526 votes. His only challenger was Phyllicia Maree’ Hercules of the Rally for Democracy and Progress, who received 559 votes. In the 2015 regional elections Swapo won the constituency without any contesting opposition candidate. 

The 2020 regional election saw six candidates competing for the councillor position and was only narrowly won by SWAPO. Its candidate Hambelela Ndjaleka obtained 1,654 votes, ahead of Tshinana Petrus Tshiqwetha of the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020, who obtained 1,438 votes.

==Renaming controversy==
Lüderitz Constituency was renamed in August 2013, originally to &quot;ǃNamiǂNüs&quot;. Namibia president Hifikepunye Pohamba stated that: 

&quot;I have accepted the [4th Delimitation] Commission&#x27;s recommendation that Lüderitz Constituency be renamed ǃNamiǂNûs Constituency which was the original name of the area. This includes the current town of Lüderitz&quot;.

Other spellings of the name also popped up, and arguments arose whether or not the president&#x27;s statement implied a name change of the town Lüderitz, and if so, what the town&#x27;s demonym would then be. The current interpretation of the statement is that only the constituency has been renamed.

The meaning of the name &quot;!Namiǂnûs&quot; is not universally accepted. It is a term of the Khoekhoe language of the ǃAman, a subtribe of the Nama people, the inhabitants of the area before German colonialisation. Erwin Leuschner stated that even Khoekhoe natives are divided on its spelling but that it &quot;certainly&quot; means &quot;embrace&quot;. Christopher Torchia reports that the meaning is more specific, &quot;place embraced by the water&quot;.

<doc id="953174" wikidata="Q6931734" url="?curid=953174" title="Mudgee High School">
<text>Mudgee High School is a government-funded co-educational comprehensive secondary day school, located in Mudgee, a regional town in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia.

Established in 1916, the school enrolled approximately 810 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom 13 percent identified as Indigenous Australians and five percent were from a language background other than English. The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education; the principal is Wayne Eade.

== Overview ==
According to the school, its aim is to &quot;provide a safe, supportive and inclusive environment where students can develop the skills and knowledge to connect, succeed and thrive.&quot;

== Electronic devices ==
The New South Wales Department of Education has banned all electronic devices in schools since October 2023. To bring a phone or any other device to school it must be put in a YONDR pouch, which prevents use of the device. Alternatively, it the device may be locked at one of the 4 locking stations in the morning and can be unlocked in the afternoon before students depart.

==Sports houses==

At the beginning of Year 7, all Mudgee High School students are placed in one of the following four houses, usually on the basis of their last name.

== Transport ==
Mudgee High School is within walking distance of most of the township, however bus services are operated to and from the school by Ogdens Coaches and 2 are operated by APM Booths bus services.

== School newsletter ==
Each week the office staff produce a newsletter for parents and students to read, the newsletter contains information about recent school events and P&amp;C awards announced and future programs to be held.

== Sister schools ==

Mudgee High School has formed close links with several sister schools over the world including the Japanese Kita senri High School in Osaka, Japan, Nose Senior High School, and Ibaraki Nishi High School and, in East Timor, St. Francis of Assisi High School, in the town of Fatuberliu.

Every even year (Ex: 2022), a group of Mudgee High students and teachers make their way to Japan to further their study of the Japanese culture and language. The opposite occurs later in the same year when a group of Japanese students and teachers make their way to Mudgee.

== Aurora College ==
Mudgee High School caters for Aurora College. Aurora allows students in rural and remote areas to remain in their local school and community while studying specialist subjects which their home school cannot currently offer. The school library has a distance education / Aurora room where Aurora lessons are held.

<doc id="953184" wikidata="Q4982749" url="?curid=953184" title="Buchwald v. Paramount">
<text>Buchwald v. Paramount (1990), , was a breach of contract lawsuit filed and decided in California in which humorist and writer Art Buchwald alleged that Paramount Pictures stole his script idea and turned it into the 1988 movie &quot;Coming to America&quot;. Buchwald won the lawsuit and was awarded damages, and then accepted a settlement from Paramount before any appeal took place.

The decision was important mainly for the court&#x27;s determination in the damages phase of the trial that Paramount used &quot;unconscionable&quot; means of determining how much to pay authors, which is widely called &quot;Hollywood accounting.&quot; Paramount claimed, and provided accounting evidence to support the claim, that despite the movie&#x27;s $288 million in revenues, it had earned no net profit, according to the definition of &quot;net profit&quot; in Buchwald&#x27;s contract, and hence Buchwald was owed nothing. The court agreed with Buchwald&#x27;s argument that this was &quot;unconscionable&quot; and therefore invalid. Fearing a loss if it appealed, and the subsequent implications of the unconscionability decision across all its other contracts, Paramount settled for $900,000. The case was the subject of a 1992 book, &quot;Fatal Subtraction: The Inside Story of Buchwald v. Paramount&quot; by Pierce O&#x27;Donnell, the lawyer who represented Buchwald, and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter Dennis McDougal.

==Timeline==
In 1982, Buchwald wrote a screen treatment titled &quot;It&#x27;s a Crude, Crude World&quot; (later renamed &quot;King for a Day&quot;) that was pitched to Jeffrey Katzenberg of Paramount, with the intention of starring Eddie Murphy, who was under contract to Paramount at the time. According to the court documents, the synopsis for &quot;King for a Day&quot; was:

Paramount optioned the treatment in early 1983 and commissioned several unsuccessful scripts from several screenwriters. John Landis was considered as the director from time to time. After two years of development hell, Paramount decided to abandon the project in March 1985.

In May 1986, Paramount&#x27;s rival Warner Bros. optioned Buchwald&#x27;s treatment.

In the summer of 1987, Paramount began to develop a movie that was credited as being based on a story by Eddie Murphy, and which was to be directed by John Landis. The story outline was similar to Buchwald&#x27;s story idea, and to the failed Paramount scripts that had been based on it.

In January 1988, Warner Bros. canceled their version of Buchwald&#x27;s project, citing the Paramount project.

When the movie &quot;Coming to America&quot; was released by Paramount in 1988, Eddie Murphy was given sole story credit. Buchwald was not paid, or even credited as the story writer. Buchwald sued Paramount for breach of contract, as his contract with Paramount stated that he would be paid a certain amount if his treatment were made into a film.

==Decision==
The California Superior Court decided in 1990 that Buchwald had demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that his story treatment and Paramount&#x27;s unsuccessful scripts based on the treatment were &quot;similar&quot; to that of the &quot;Coming to America&quot; movie. Together with the evidence that Murphy and Landis previously had access to Buchwald&#x27;s treatment, the court determined that the movie&#x27;s story was indeed &quot;based upon&quot; Buchwald&#x27;s treatment. Since Paramount never paid Buchwald, as the option agreement specified would occur if a movie based on his treatment were ever released, Paramount did indeed breach the contract.

In the second phase of the trial in which the court determined the appropriate amount of damages to be paid to Buchwald, Paramount testified that despite the movie&#x27;s $288 million in ticket sales, it had spent so much money on the movie&#x27;s development and marketing that, according to the formula specified in Buchwald&#x27;s contract, Paramount had made no &quot;net profit&quot;.

The court then found that the formula was &quot;unconscionable&quot; and that Buchwald therefore could pursue a separate tort lawsuit against the company.

Fearing a loss on appeal and, presumably, a wave of lawsuits by authors claiming they, too, had been wronged by the unconscionable net profit formula, Paramount settled with Buchwald and his producing partner for $900,000. As part of the settlement, the &quot;unconscionability&quot; decision was vacated.

==Implications==

The net profit formula in authors&#x27; contracts does not correspond to the net profit formula of generally accepted accounting principles that the movie studios use when creating their financial statements that are reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and to the investing public. What the court described as an &quot;unconscionable&quot; formula in Buchwald&#x27;s contract effectively double-counts many costs borne by the movie studio.

Some commentators have claimed this lawsuit was a watershed that would affect Hollywood&#x27;s payments to anyone who enjoyed &quot;profit participation&quot; by forcing a change to the net profit formulas. However, a ruling by the California Superior Court in &quot;Batfilm Productions v. Warner Bros.&quot; regarding the 1989 &quot;Batman&quot; movie stated that a similar formula was not unconscionable. To date, there has been no review of this type of claim by an appellate court, meaning that the superior courts cannot look to an appellate court&#x27;s decision for guidance.

Still, the case has caused nearly all studios and production companies to be more careful about how they handle scripts since they do not want to inspire a similar case if they accidentally use a plot element from work that comes without prior agreement. Concerned that &quot;similarities&quot; between future script drafts and movies could cause lawsuits, nearly all studios and production companies now return unsolicited scripts to their authors unopened.

==Response from John Landis==
In the retrospective interviews included on the 2007 DVD release of &quot;Coming to America&quot;, John Landis and screenwriters Barry Blaustein and David Sheffield make no mention of Art Buchwald&#x27;s lawsuit, and maintain that the film&#x27;s story originated with Eddie Murphy, with Blaustein and Sheffield writing the screenplay from Murphy&#x27;s 25-page treatment. In an interview filmed around the time of the film&#x27;s theatrical release, and included on the DVD, Murphy himself claims that he came up with the idea for the movie while on tour.

In Giulia D&#x27;Agnolo Vallan&#x27;s 2008 book &quot;John Landis&quot;, Landis is quoted as saying that Art Buchwald&#x27;s case against Paramount was &quot;without merit,&quot; going on to state the following:

Landis also provided the following response as to why Buchwald&#x27;s lawsuit received more attention in the press than other similar lawsuits:

<doc id="953186" wikidata="Q1367078" url="?curid=953186" title="José Luis Garci">
<text>José Luis García Muñoz (born 20 January 1944), known professionally as José Luis Garci, is a Spanish film director, producer, critic, TV presenter, screenwriter and author. One of the most influential film personalities in the history of film in Spain, he earned worldwide acclaim and his country&#x27;s first Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award for &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot; (1982). Four of his films, including also &quot;Sesión continua&quot; (1984), &quot;Asignatura aprobada&quot; (1987) and &quot;El abuelo&quot; (1998), have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, more than any other Spanish director. His films are characterized for his classical style and the underlying sentimentality of their plots. 

==Early life and work==
Born in 1944 in a humble family from Asturias. After completing a pre-university course, Garci began working as an administrative assistant in a bank. His love for cinema from an early age led him to pursue filmmaking as a career. At age twenty he began writing reviews for a number of film magazines such as &quot;Signos&quot; and &quot;Cinestudio&quot;, winning an award in 1968 from the Circulo de Escritores Cinematograficos for his work as film critic.

In 1969 he became involved in scriptwriting, receiving his first screen credits for Antonio Giménez Rico &quot;El Cronicón&quot; (The Chronicle, 1970). Between 1972 and 1977 he scripted five more films: León Klimovsky&#x27;s &quot;La casa de las chivas&quot; (&quot;The House of the goats&quot;); Pedro Olea&#x27;s &quot;No es bueno que el hombre esté solo&quot; (A Man Shouldn&#x27;t be Alone, 1973); Eloy de la Iglesia&#x27;s &quot;Una gota de sangre para morir amando&quot;, (A drop of blood to die loving, 1973); Antonio Drove&#x27;s &quot;Mi mujer es muy decente dentro de lo que cabe&quot; (1974) or Roberto Bodegas&#x27; &quot;Vida conyugal sana&quot; (Healthy Married Life, 1973) and &quot;Los nuevos españoles&quot; (New Spaniards, 1974). During this same period, Garci also wrote the made for T.V film &quot;La Cabina&quot; (The Telephone Box, 1972) directed by Antonio Mercero. He then directed his first short films: &quot;!Al Futbol!&quot; (!To Football!) &quot;Mi Marilyn&quot; (My Marilyn), both in 1975, and &quot;Tiempo de gente acobardada&quot; (People Cowed Time, 1976).

At the same time, he wrote his first literary works, science fiction stories like: &quot;Bibidibabibidibú&quot; (1970), &quot;Adam Blake (1972),&quot; and &quot;La Gioconda está triste y otras extrañas historias&quot; (1976). He also published the essay: &quot;Ray Bradbury humanista del futuro&quot; (1971). In 1981 he obtained the Puerta de Oro Prize for his story &quot;Los mejores años de nuestra vida&quot;.

== Feature films ==
In 1977, José Luis Garci directed his first feature film &quot;Asignatura pendiente&quot; (&quot;Unfinished Business&quot;) from a script by Gonzalez Sinde, a love story between an old pair of lovers which runs parallel to the social and political changes lived in Spain after the fall of Francisco Franco&#x27;s regime. The film was well received by critics and audiences, becoming the most successful representative of the Spanish film of the generation of the Transition from dictatorship to democracy who saw themselves in a social and political limbo. A simple story of an amorous seduction by the film&#x27;s hero is set around a series of topical references to a generation of Spaniards born in the immediate post-civil war period whose frustrations and nostalgia are embodied in the film&#x27;s protagonist. Garci took his narrative cues from the visual patterns followed in the traditional Hollywood narrative.

Garci second film &quot;Solos en la madrugada&quot; (Alone in the Dark, 1978) became skilled tackling progressive social themes intended for an audience interested neither in elite art cinema nor in the popular style of most Spanish comedies. He used this same pattern in his third film, &quot;Las verdes praderas&quot; (The Green Meadows, 1979), in which heavy sentimentality, a constant in his films, became more apparent.

After founding the production company Nickel Odeon with José Esteban Alenda in 1980, the director changed gears with &quot;El Crack&quot; (1981), in which he used the figure of the hard boiled detective in a story inspired by the novels of Dashiell Hammett, to whom the film is dedicated, and employing elements of the American film noirs of the 1930s and 40s giving it a Spanish flavor. For this film Garci won the CEC Award for Best Screenplay from the Círculo de Escritores Cinematográficos. The formula worked so well that two years later he made a sequel, &quot;&quot; (1983).

Between this two films, Garci made his most emblematic work &quot;Volver a empezar&quot;, (&quot;Begin to Beguine&quot;, 1982), a sentimental story of an aging writer who returns to Spain after many years in exiled following the civil war. The film was the first Spanish motion picture to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

His films &quot;Sesión continua&quot; (&quot;Double Feature&quot;, 1984) and &quot;Asignatura aprobada&quot; (&quot;Course Completed&quot;, 1987), which also received Academy Award nominations, gave emphasis to sentimentality. He won the Goya Award for Best Director for &quot;Asigantura aprobada&quot; in 1988. &quot;Canción de cuna&quot; (&quot;Cradle Song&quot;, 1994), a film adaptation of Gregorio Martinez Sierra play, was awarded with the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the 18th Montreal World Film Festival. Garci&#x27;s subsequently films include &quot;La herida luminosa&quot; (&quot;The Wound of Light&quot;, 1997), and &quot;El abuelo&quot; (&quot;The Grandfather&quot;, 1998), which was Spain&#x27;s submission for the Best Foreign Film category of the Academy Awards in 1999, getting the final nomination.

Recently, Garci directed &quot;Una historia de entonces&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot;, 2000), which was entered into the 51st Berlin International Film Festival, &quot;Historia de un beso&quot; (&quot;Story of a Kiss&quot;, 2002), &quot;Tiovivo c. 1950&quot; (2004), &quot;Ninette&quot; (2005), &quot;Luz de domingo&quot; (2007), &quot;Sangre de mayo&quot; (2008), &quot;Holmes &amp; Watson. Madrid Days&quot; (2012), and the prequel &#x27; (2019), the third part of the crime film saga &quot;El crack&quot;. In addition to filmmaking, he is a popular television presenter in his homeland. His television program &#x27;, which was broadcast on Televisión Española between 1995 and 2005 on the occasion of the first centenary of the history of cinema, presented a feature film weekly and was attended by three experts, who debated after the screening of the chosen film.

== Style ==
Garci does not have a computer, but writes all his scripts by hand or on an Olympia brand typewriter. When writing a collaborative script, Garci can base it on his own idea or that of the other scriptwriter, providing mutual feedback with ideas, characters and scenes until reaching the final result. In his films his preference for the shot and sequence stands out and are usually divided into two stages, one that goes from &quot;Asignatura pendiente&quot; (1977) to &quot;Asignatura aprobada&quot; (1987), another that begins with &quot;Canción de cuna&quot; (1994) and extends until &quot;El crack cero&quot; (2019). In its first stage, Garci places the action in the present or in the immediate past, showing throughout the film the social and political changes that occur at that moment, while in the second stage it focuses on showing the past in an attempt to understand the present.

== Personal life ==
Garci maintained a long-time relationship with Ana Rosa Quintana. In 1998 he began a relationship with Cayetana Guillén Cuervo, whom he met during the filming of &quot;El abuelo&quot;. Since June 10, 2004, he has been married to the Uruguayan actress Andrea Tenuta.

A fan of football, he is a follower of Atlético de Madrid and Real Sporting de Gijón, of which he was a manager for more than three years.

<text>Joseph Robbie (July 7, 1916 – January 7, 1990) was an American attorney, politician, and the principal founder of the Miami Dolphins.

==Early life==
Robbie was raised in Sisseton, South Dakota, the second of five children. His father was a Lebanese immigrant and restaurant manager; his mother was a baker and the daughter of Irish immigrants. He was raised Catholic.

At 14 years old, Robbie was the sportswriter for his local newspaper, &quot;The People&#x27;s Press&quot;. In 1934, during the Great Depression, Robbie dropped out of high school to work as a lumberjack for the Civilian Conservation Corps in the Black Hills, sending $25 of his $30 monthly earnings home to his family. After completing his high school education in 1936, Robbie enrolled at Northern State Teachers College on a debating scholarship. After three years, he transferred to the University of South Dakota. Robbie met his future wife, Elizabeth, while he was a senior at the school and she was a freshman. The couple were married two years later.

Robbie enlisted in the Navy on the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Robbie saw substantial action in the Pacific theater and was awarded a Bronze Star for his service. After his discharge, he used the G.I. Bill to return to University of South Dakota School of Law as a law student.

==Politics==
Following his graduation from law school, Robbie worked as a deputy state&#x27;s attorney and a professor of economics at Dakota Wesleyan University. In 1948, at 33 years old, Robbie entered politics. He was elected to the South Dakota House of Representatives as a Democrat. In 1950, he ran for Governor of South Dakota but lost to Sigurd Anderson. The following year, Robbie and his family moved to Minneapolis at the encouragement of then-mayor Hubert H. Humphrey.

His political and business careers further developed in Minnesota. In addition to operating his own law firm, Robbie served as regional counsel for the Office of Price Stabilization in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota. He was also a charter member of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Commission and chairman of the Minnesota Municipal Commission. In addition to working on Humphrey&#x27;s political campaigns, Robbie represented Minnesota&#x27;s 5th congressional district at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.

Robbie also worked as a lobbyist for the tobacco industry from the 1960s until his death. In 1963, he appeared before the United States Senate to voice opposition to a bill which would have regulated tobacco advertising. From 1971 until 1989, he was the head of the Minnesota Candy &amp; Tobacco Distributors Association.

==Professional sports==
After moving to Minneapolis, Robbie took an interest in professional football and became a Minnesota Vikings season ticket holder.

In March 1965, Joe Foss, the commissioner of the American Football League, met with Robbie in Washington, D.C. Foss had attended the University of South Dakota, later serving in the Marine Corps and being awarded the Medal of Honor.

At the meeting, Foss recommended that Robbie look into Miami as a potential site for an expansion franchise. Robbie formed a partnership with comedian Danny Thomas, a fellow Lebanese-American, and raised the $7.5 million required to purchase an expansion team.

The Dolphins&#x27; stadium was officially called Joe Robbie Stadium from its opening in 1987 until 1996. It has undergone a series of name changes since, and it is currently known as Hard Rock Stadium.

Robbie had a small part playing himself in the film &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, in which he is interviewed about security for Super Bowl X (1976).

Robbie also owned the Miami Toros and the Fort Lauderdale Strikers (later the Minnesota Strikers) soccer teams of the North American Soccer League. Joe Robbie Stadium was one of the first major stadiums in the U.S. designed with soccer in mind., and was also designed to be easily reconfigured for baseball.

Robbie also believed that given Miami&#x27;s rapid growth, it was a foregone conclusion that Miami would have a Major League Baseball team: this was proven correct when the city was granted a franchise, the Florida Marlins (now the Miami Marlins), in 1990, two months after Robbie&#x27;s death.

==Honors and awards==
For his contributions to the Miami Dolphins, and being the founder of the team, Joe Robbie became the inaugural inductee on the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll on September 16, 1990 (eight months after his death).

<text>Bold Forbes (March 31, 1973 – August 9, 2000) was a champion thoroughbred racehorse, winner of the 1976 Kentucky Derby and 1976 Belmont Stakes.

==Background==
Bold Forbes was a bay horse bred in Kentucky by Lee Eaton. Bold Forbes&#x27; dam Comely Nell was a daughter of the Kentucky Oaks winner Nellie L.

==Racing career==

===1975: two-year-old season===
Bold Forbes was campaigned in Puerto Rico as a two-year-old, where he won seven of eight starts in 1975. He was then transferred to the United States where he won the Saratoga Special Stakes and the Tremont Stakes.

===1976: three-year-old season===
As a three-year-old Bold Forbes was trained by Laz Barrera. He won the San Jacinto Stakes, Wood Memorial Stakes and Bay Shore Stakes.

On the first Saturday in May 1976, Bold Forbes contested the Kentucky Derby. Ridden by Angel Cordero, he led from the start, setting a &quot;blistering pace&quot;, and won by half a length from the 2/5 favourite Honest Pleasure. In the Preakness Stakes Bold Forbes again took an early lead and set an exceptionally fast pace, but after a prolonged battle with Honest Pleasure, both horses tired in the final stages and were beaten by Elocutionist, with Bold Forbes finishing third. In the Belmont Stakes, Bold Forbes again led from the start and won by a neck from McKenzie Bridge with Great Contractor a further neck away in third.

At the end of the year, Bold Forbes was voted American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. He lost Horse of the Year honors to six-year-old champion Forego.

==Retirement==
Bold Forbes was retired to stud after his three-year-old season with earnings of $546,536. He stood at Stone Farm in Paris, Kentucky. He sired 13 crops through 1990 with 460 named foals and 304 winners, 30 of which were stakes winners, and his offspring have won over $18 million. Some of Bold Forbes&#x27; offspring include champions Tiffany Lass (winner of the Kentucky Oaks) and Bold Apparel, as well as Grade I stakes winner Air Forbes Won.

The dark bay/brown champion was moved to the Kentucky Horse Park in April 1991. He was a resident of the Hall of Champions for nine years. Until his death, he was the oldest living Kentucky Derby winner. He died on August 9, 2000, at the age of 27 after being humanely euthanized due to renal failure and complications from gastroenteritis. Bold Forbes is buried at the Hall of Champions, where a memorial is dedicated to him in the &quot;Memorial of Champions.&quot;

==Career earnings==
In 1975, at age two, Bold Forbes started 8 times, winning seven times and finishing third once, for earnings of $86,250. In 1976, as a three-year-old, he made 10 starts, winning six, placing second once, and placing third three times. He won a total of $460,286.

<text>Erika Natalie Louise Harold (born February 20, 1980) is an American attorney, politician, and former Miss America.

Harold was Miss Illinois 2002 and Miss America 2003. Her pageant platform was combating bullying. In 2014, she was a candidate in the Republican primary for the 13th Congressional District seat in the State of Illinois, ultimately losing the nomination to the incumbent, Rodney Davis. In the 2018 election, she was the Republican nominee for Illinois Attorney General.

==Background and legal career==

Harold was born in Urbana, Illinois. Her ethnicity includes Greek, German and English on her father&#x27;s side; and on her mother&#x27;s side, both Native American and African-American.

She graduated from the University of Illinois, Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in political science and was a Chancellor&#x27;s Scholar. In 2007, she received her J.D. from Harvard Law School, where she won best brief in the Harvard Ames Moot Court semi-final and final rounds of competition. She has worked in Chicago, Illinois, as an associate attorney at Sidley Austin LLP and at Burke, Warren, MacKay &amp; Serritella. She later was a commercial litigation attorney for Meyer Capel law firm in Champaign, Illinois. In 2022, she was appointed by the Illinois Supreme Court as executive director of the Commission on Professionalism.

==Pageants==

She became Miss America 2003 on September 21, 2002 (as Miss Illinois 2002). Her official platform was &quot;Preventing Youth Violence and Bullying: Protect Yourself, Respect Yourself.&quot; Her platform choice grew out of personal experience; she recounted having been the subject of racial and sexual harassment while growing up. In a May 2, 2003, speech, Harold said when she turned to teachers and school administrators, her concerns were dismissed. As part of her platform, she became a national spokesperson for Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a national advocacy group.

In the first week of her reign, she also adopted a secondary platform for sexual abstinence. The Washington Times suggested that pageant officials demonstrated a liberal bias when they allowed Miss America 1998 Kate Shindle, whose platform was HIV prevention, to advocate condom distribution and needle exchange during her time as Miss America. On October 8, 2002, Harold gave a speech at the National Press Club in Washington during which she stated that she would talk about sexual abstinence and that she &quot;will not be bullied&quot; into dropping the topic from her platform. Thirty-eight members of Congress sent her a letter of support, encouraging her to press on with her &quot;healthy message of abstinence until marriage.&quot; During her time as Miss America, Harold interacted with legislators and testified before Congress on bullying and abstinence, which provided her with additional motivation to pursue a political career.

==Politics==
Harold is a Republican, and was the Youth Director for the Republican primary campaign of Illinois gubernatorial candidate Patrick O&#x27;Malley. She later served as a delegate to the 2004 Republican National Convention. She gave a speech to the convention on August 31, 2004, to support George W. Bush&#x27;s faith-based initiatives. She worked on the Bush campaign to reach out to minority voters.

In May 2012, Harold was one of four finalists for the Republican nomination for Congress in Illinois&#x27;s 13th district, a nomination selected by the Republican chairmen of the 14 counties covered by the 13th Congressional District, instead of a primary election. The Republican chairmen selected Rodney L. Davis, over Harold, and Davis was subsequently elected to Congress, in an expensive race.

===2014 congressional campaign===

On June 4, 2013, Harold announced she would run against Rep. Rodney L. Davis, R-Ill. in the 2014 Republican primary for Illinois&#x27;s 13th congressional district. Davis, Harold&#x27;s opponent in the primary, was among the top targets for Democrats in 2014. On March 18, 2014, Harold lost the Republican primary to Davis 54%–41%.

===2018 campaign for Illinois attorney general===

On August 15, 2017, Harold announced that she would seek the Republican nomination to be Illinois attorney general. On March 20, 2018, she won the Republican nomination for attorney general garnering 59% of the vote in a two-way contest against Gary Grasso, a former mayor of Burr Ridge, IL, now a member of the DuPage County Board and a litigation attorney. She lost the general election to Democrat Kwame Raoul garnering 43% of the vote to his 55%.

<doc id="953207" wikidata="Q464914" url="?curid=953207" title="Gayatri Devi">
<text>Gayatri Devi (born Princess Gayatri Devi of Cooch Behar; 23 May 1919 − 29 July 2009) was the third Maharani consort of Jaipur from 1940 to 1949 through her marriage to Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II. Following her husband&#x27;s signature for the Jaipur State to become part of the Union of India and her step-son&#x27;s assumption of the title in 1970, she was known as Maharani Gayatri Devi, Rajmata of Jaipur.

She was born in the Hindu royal family of Cooch Behar. Her father was Maharaja Jitendra Narayan of Cooch Behar in West Bengal, and her mother was the Maratha Princess, Indira Raje of Baroda, the only daughter of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III, and she was sister to Jagaddipendra Narayan, informally known as &#x27;Bhaiya&#x27;, who succeeded their father to the throne of Cooch Behar.

Following India&#x27;s independence and the abolition of the princely states, she became a successful politician in the Swatantra Party. Gayatri was also celebrated for her beauty and became something of a fashion icon in her adulthood. She served 12 years in Swatantra Party, during which she was a prominent critic of Indira Gandhi&#x27;s government. After her departure from politics, she lived a quiet life in her large estate, spending time on hobbies and leisure.

She died on 29 July 2009 in Jaipur, at the age of 90. She was suffering from paralytic ileus and a lung infection. She left an estate estimated at £250 million, which was passed on to her grandchildren.

==Early life==

Born into a Hindu royal family, she had Bengali and royal Koch ancestry on her paternal side, while her maternal side was of royal Maratha descent. Her father, Prince Jitendra Narayan of Cooch Behar, presently in West Bengal, was the younger brother of the Yuvaraja (Crown Prince). She was related to Keshub Chandra Sen (A prominent figure in the Bengal Renaissance and social reformer) through her paternal grandmother, Suniti Devi, who was the daughter of Keshub Chandra Sen. Her mother was Maratha Princess Indira Raje of Baroda, the only daughter of Maratha King, Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III, an extremely beautiful princess and a legendary socialite. Early in her life, her uncle&#x27;s death led to her father ascending the throne (gaddi). Gayatri studied at Glendower Preparatory School in London, Patha Bhavana of Visva-Bharati University, Shantiniketan, and later in Lausanne, Switzerland, where she travelled with her mother and siblings, then studied secretarial skills in London School of Secretaries; Brillantmont and Monkey Club London.

She first met Sawai Man Singh II when she was 12 and he had come to Calcutta to play polo and stayed with their family. She married Sawai Man Singh II Bahadur on 9 May 1940.

Gayatri was a particularly avid equestrienne. She was an excellent rider and an able Polo player. She was a good shot and enjoyed many days out on &#x27;Shikars&#x27;. Gayatri was fond of cars and is credited with importing the first Mercedes-Benz W126, a 500 SEL to India which was later shipped to Malaysia. She also owned several Rolls-Royces and an aircraft. Gayatri had one child, Prince Jagat Singh of Jaipur, late Raja of Isarda, born on 15 October 1949, who was granted his uncle&#x27;s fief as a subsidiary title. Jagat Singh was the half-brother to Bhawani Singh, who was the eldest son of his father born by his father&#x27;s first wife.

As a style icon, Gayatri was shot by photographer Cecil Beaton for Vogue. Gayatri was described by Beaton as one of the ten most beautiful women in the world. In a 2004 interview, Gayatri mentioned &quot;I have never felt beautiful...I remember as a young girl, my mother had to literally force me into applying lipstick, physical appearance doesn&#x27;t bother me, it never has, it never will&quot;. In 1962 Jacqueline Kennedy visited Gayatri Devi in India and were photographed together at a Polo match and on her tour of India. In 2019 an exhibition &#x27;Maharani: ‘Remembering the Princess&#x27;&quot; was held in Mumbai to celebrate the Maharani&#x27;s Centennial year. In 2013 designer Sabyasachi made five limited edition saris presented at the Taj Mahal Palace in honour of Devi&#x27;s enduring style icon status.

She started two schools in Jaipur, Maharani Gayatri Devi Girls’ Public School established in 1943 and Maharaja Sawai Man Singh Vidyalaya, Jaipur which is a co-educational school in memory of her husband. She revived and promoted the dying art of blue pottery.

==Political career==
Gayatri Devi ran for Parliament in 1962 and won the constituency in the Lok Sabha, winning 192,909 votes out of 246,516 cast. She continued to hold this seat in 1967 and 1971 as a member of the Swatantra Party founded by C. Rajagopalachari, running against the Indian National Congress.

In 1965, during a meeting with Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, Gayatri was again asked to join Congress. Despite the fact that her husband was being made ambassador to Spain, she stuck to her principles and decided not to join the party. In 1967 the Swatantra party joined hands with Jan Sangh that was led by Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. The alliance won a large number of seats in the 1967 election. In the assembly election Gayatri lost to Damodar Lal Vyas, in Malpura constituency, but won the Lok Sabha election.

The privy purses were abolished in 1971, terminating all royal privileges and titles. Gayatri was arrested under the COFEPOSA Act during the Emergency in July 1975 on the accusation of violating tax laws, and served 5 and a half months in Tihar Jail. She retired from politics and published her biography, &quot;A Princess Remembers&quot;, written by Santha Rama Rau, in 1976. It was also published in Marathi language as &quot;A Princess Remembers: Gayatri Devi&quot;. She was also the focus of the film &quot;Memoirs of a Hindu Princess&quot;, directed by Françoise Levie.

There were rumours that she might re-enter politics as late as 1999, when the Cooch Behar Trinamool Congress nominated her as their candidate for the Lok Sabha elections, but she did not respond to the offer.

==Family==
Gayatri Devi had one son, Prince Jagat Singh, Raja of Isarda (15 October 1949 – 5 February 1997), who was granted his paternal uncle&#x27;s (father&#x27;s elder brother) fief of Isarda as a subsidiary title. Jagat Singh was married on 10 May 1978 to Mom Rajawongse Priyanandana Rangsit (b. 1952), daughter of Prince Piyarangsit Rangsit and Princess Vibhavadi Rangsit (née Rajani) of Thailand. The couple had two children:
* Rajkumari Lalitya Kumari (b. 1979)
* Maharaj Devraj Singh, Raja of Isarda (b. 1981)
Today, they are her only surviving descendants, and as such, have claimed to be heirs of their paternal grandmother.

Maharaj Jagat Singh was paternal half-brother to Bhawani Singh of Jaipur, the eldest son of the late Maharaja by his first wife, a Jodhpur princess.

===Family relationships===

Gayatri Devi was related to several erstwhile royal families in India. She was herself not from the Rajput community, but from a dynasty native to Cooch Behar in Bengal, and was daughter of Maharaja Jitendra Narayan and Maharani Indira Raje, who was daughter of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III and Maharani Chimnabai, belonging to the Gaekwad dynasty of the Marathas.

Her paternal grandparents were Nripendra Narayan Bhup Bahadur and Sunity Devi of Cooch Behar. Maharani Sunity Devi was the daughter of the Brahmo social reformer Keshab Chandra Sen.

She had two brothers, Jagaddipendra Narayan and Indrajitendra Narayan of whom Jagaddipendra Narayan became the Maharaja of Cooch Behar in his infancy after the death of their father in 1922.

Thus, maternally, she was closely connected to Gaekwads of Baroda State. Further, her sister Ila Devi was married into the Tripura royal family, and her younger sister, Maneka Devi, was married into the royal family of Dewas State. Thus, through various relatives, she was related to the royal houses of Kota, Sawantwadi, Akkalkot State, Jath State, Dewas Jr., Jasdan State, Sandur, Tehri-Garhwal, Mayurbhanj, Dhar State, Kolhapur, Lunawada State, Baria and Raja of Payagpur, which was considered normal among the royalties of India.

==Death==
She was admitted at Santokba Durlabhji Memorial hospital (SDMH) on 17 July 2009. She died at the age of 90 on 29 July 2009, reportedly due to lung failure.

Her family has approached the Delhi High Court to regain 800 kg of gold which was taken away by the government in 1975 describing possession of the gold by Gayatri Devi to be illegal as per the Gold Control Act, 1968. In 2012, the central government counsel S.K. Dubey told the court the possession of raw gold by Gayatri Devi was illegal. Dubey added, &quot;The family has violated both the rules, so a fine of Rs.1.5 crore was imposed on them by the government. It was later reduced to Rs.80 lakh.&quot;

<doc id="953219" wikidata="Q714574" url="?curid=953219" title="Titta Ruffo">
<text>Titta Ruffo (9 June 1877 – 5 July 1953), born as Ruffo Cafiero (double forename) Titta, was an Italian operatic baritone who had a major international singing career. Known as the &quot;Voce del leone&quot; (&quot;voice of the lion&quot;), he was greatly admired, even by rival baritones, such as Giuseppe De Luca, who said of Ruffo: &quot;His was not a voice, it was a miracle&quot; (although not often published is the second part of De Luca&#x27;s conclusion &quot;which he [Ruffo] bawled away...&quot;), and Victor Maurel, the creator of Verdi&#x27;s Iago and Falstaff. Maurel said that the notes of Ruffo&#x27;s upper register were the most glorious baritone sounds he had ever heard (see Pleasants, cited below). Indeed Walter Legge, the prominent classical record producer, went so far as to call Ruffo &quot;a genius&quot;.

==Biography==

Born Ruffo Titta in Pisa (he reversed his forename and surname for the stage), Ruffo was the son of a foreman at an ironworks, who named him after a favourite dog, Ruffo. His mother only ever called him &quot;Cafiero&quot;. He studied singing and voice production with several teachers.

Ruffo made his operatic debut in 1898 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome as the Herald in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. After a slow start, his career took off in the early 1900s and he quickly achieved international renown due to the power and ardency of voice and acting.

His other major debuts occurred in the following venues and years: Buenos Aires (1902), London (1903), Milan (1904), Lisbon (1907), the Paris Opéra (1911) and the Theatro Municipal (São Paulo) (1911). Ruffo made his American debut in Philadelphia in 1912 and sang extensively in Chicago. He reached the New York Metropolitan Opera relatively late in his career, in 1922, as Figaro in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, having enlisted in the Italian army during World War I. He would give a total of 46 performances at the Met from 1922 through to 1929. While committed to the Met he was a pupil of voice teacher Estelle Liebling. In 1929 he signed a $350,000 (approximately $ today) movie contract.

He retired in 1931, staying for several years in exile Switzerland and Paris. He wrote an autobiography, &quot;La mia parabola&quot;, which was translated into English in 1995 as &quot;My Parabola&quot;. In 1937 he returned to Italy, where he was later arrested by the authorities for opposing the Fascist regime and espousing socialist beliefs. His sister was married to Giacomo Matteotti, after whose murder by the Fascists he had vowed never to sing in Italy again. In the later years of his life, he maintained friendships with a variety of singers, notably with baritones Gino Bechi, Carlo Tagliabue and tenors Giacomo Lauri-Volpi and Giuseppe di Stefano.

Titta Ruffo died in Florence, Italy from heart disease on 5 July 1953, aged 76.

==Vocal characteristics and recorded legacy==
Ruffo&#x27;s repertoire included most of the major baritone roles in French and Italian opera, including among others Rigoletto, Di Luna, Amonasro, Germont, Tonio, Rossini&#x27;s Figaro, Valentin, Iago, Carlo (in both &quot;Ernani&quot; and &quot;La forza del destino&quot;), Nabucco, Vasco, Don Giovanni, Barnaba, Scarpia, Marcello, and Renato in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;. He was also renowned for his interpretations of several baritone parts in operas that are largely forgotten today, namely, the title roles in Ambroise Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and Franchetti&#x27;s &quot;Cristoforo Colombo&quot; plus Cascart in Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Zazà &quot;and Neri in Giordano&#x27;s &quot;La cena delle beffe&quot;.

Like his tenor contemporary Enrico Caruso, Ruffo was said to embody a new style of singing in which power, declamatory force and a rich, chesty tone eclipsed the previous generation&#x27;s emphasis on vocal grace, flexibility and technical finesse. Consequently, some conservative commentators compared Ruffo unfavorably with his elegant Italian predecessor Mattia Battistini, who was a master of bel canto and the possessor of a leaner, more silvery timbre than Ruffo&#x27;s. However, according to modern-day critics like John Steane and Michael Scott, the difference between the two great baritones was not quite as clear cut as some have suggested in the past, because both Battistini and Ruffo displayed exceptional vocal agility and control plus the ability to sustain a long legato line. Both of them also favored a virile interpretive style and even shared a teacher in Venceslao Persichini.

Writing in the &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine in 1928, the often acerbic British critic and future record producer, Walter Legge, lauded Ruffo&#x27;s singing, recalling a recital that he had heard the baritone give six years earlier in London. Legge said that: &quot;From his first phrase the audience was vanquished by the overwhelming beauty of his voice—manly, broad, sympathetic, of unsurpassed richness. Such ease of production, such abundance of ringing high Gs! But more: Ruffo&#x27;s infinite subtlety, variety of tone-colour, interpretive insight and sincerity, his magnificent control, stupendous breathing powers, and impeccable phrasing stamped him as a genius.&quot;

Ruffo was a prolific recording artist. He made more than 130 78-rpm records, both acoustic and electric, first for Pathé Frères in Paris in 1904, and then exclusively for La voce del padrone beginning in 1906. Upon arriving in the United States in 1912 he began his long association with the Victor Talking Machine Company which concluded in 1929. As was the case with Caruso, Ruffo&#x27;s voice recorded remarkably well; it was so rich and resonant that even on the primitive acoustic recording process, much glory remains to be heard. He continued recording into the electrical recording era after 1925, but at far as one is able to judge (many titles remain unpublished) most of his published electrical recordings caught him past his prime, with what Steane calls a &quot;hollowness&quot; now evident in his mid-range. However, the unpublished Victor electrics, and some unpublished sides made even later, in London in 1933 are more than touching &quot;beaux restes&quot;, with (strangely, compared with the published electrical recordings) a great deal of voice, technique and charm still surviving to this late date.

As Steane and Pleasants mention, Ruffo made records at his peak of two arias which stand-out as exemplars of his voice and style. The first example is the Brindisi from &quot;Hamlet&quot; (made in 1907 and remade in 1911), the cadenza of which demonstrates his astounding élan and breath control. The second is the unaccompanied &quot;All&#x27;erta, marinar!&quot; from Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, which exhibits the resonance, power and brilliance of his upper register. For examples of his vocal agility, his early discs of &quot;Largo al factotum&quot; from &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; stand out. Other discs of arias singled out for praise by Pleasants, Steane and/or Scott include Ruffo&#x27;s acoustic Victor recordings of the following arias: &quot;Pari siamo&quot;, &quot;Urna fatale&quot;, &quot;Credo in un Dio crudel&quot;, &quot;Tremin gl&#x27;insani&quot;, &quot;Buona Zazà, del mio buon tempo&quot;, &quot;Nemico della patria&quot; and the &quot;Prologo&quot; from &quot;Pagliacci&quot;. All these recordings can be heard on CD collections issued by the Pearl and Preiser labels.

|DESCRIPTION =The 1914 recording by Titta Ruffo and Enrico Caruso of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;}}

Unusual for his era, Ruffo was never under exclusive contract to any one opera company; he was an operatic freelancer, a nomadic star in his own right and received top billing—and top fees—wherever he sang. Ruffo was the only male opera singer of his time who could compete, in terms of celebrity and fees, with Caruso. Surprisingly, they sang together infrequently and made only one commercially issued recording: an electrifying 1914 performance of the Oath Duet from Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;. Two explanations have been adduced by historians for this happenstance. First, professional jealousy: neither Ruffo nor Caruso liked sharing the glory with another extravagantly gifted star (though virtually all intimates of Caruso have denied this). Secondly, few opera houses could have afforded to pay both singers&#x27; enormous fees in conjunction, especially if there was an expensive diva appearing in the same production.

Ruffo refused to teach voice after his retirement, stating: &quot;I never knew how to sing; that is why my voice went by the time I was fifty. I have no right to capitalize on my former name and reputation and try to teach youngsters something I never knew how to do myself.&quot; However, as Ruffo&#x27;s decline started around 1924–25, this means that he had a very respectable 26–27 years in good form, which is remarkable in any case.

<doc id="953223" wikidata="Q434682" url="?curid=953223" title="Deniece Williams">
<text>June Deniece Williams (née Chandler; born June 3, 1950) is an American singer. She has been described as &quot;one of the great soul voices&quot; by the BBC.

She is best known for the songs &quot;Free&quot;, &quot;Silly&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Take a Miracle&quot; and two &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No.1 singles &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It for the Boy&quot; and &quot;Too Much, Too Little, Too Late&quot; (with Johnny Mathis). 

Williams has won four Grammys with twelve nominations altogether. She (with Johnny Mathis) is also known for recording “Without Us”, the theme song of &quot;Family Ties&quot;.

== Early life==
June Deniece Chandler was born and raised in Gary, Indiana, United States.

She attended Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, in the hopes of becoming a registered nurse and an anesthetist, but she dropped out after a year and a half. She recalled, &quot;You have to be a good student to be in college, and I wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

==Career==
===Early years (late 1960s–1975)===
Williams started performing while a college student, &quot;a part-time job singing at a club, Casino Royal, and I liked it. It was a lot of fun.&quot; During those years, she also worked at a telephone company and as a ward clerk at the Chicago Mercy Hospital.

She recorded for The Toddlin&#x27; Town group of labels as Deniece Chandler. One of those early records, &quot;I&#x27;m Walking Away&quot;, was released on Toddlin&#x27;s subsidiary Lock Records in the late 1960s, is a favorite on England&#x27;s Northern Soul scene. A brief spell in 1969 with Patti Hamilton&#x27;s the Lovelites resulted in her lead on &quot;I&#x27;m Not Like the Others&quot;, a track that was eventually released in 1999.

=== Becoming established (1975–1987) ===
She became a backup vocalist for Stevie Wonder as part of &quot;Wonderlove&quot;, lending her vocals on his albums &quot;Talking Book&quot;, &quot;Fulfillingness&#x27; First Finale&quot;, and &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;. Williams also appeared on Syreeta Wright&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Stevie Wonder Presents: Syreeta&quot;, Minnie Riperton&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Perfect Angel&quot; and Roberta Flack&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot; and 1977 album &quot;Blue Lights in the Basement&quot;.

She left Wonder in 1975 to sign a deal with Columbia Records and Kalimba Productions. Kalimba was a production company started by Maurice White and Charles Stepney. Williams went on to work on her first studio album with both White and Stepney as its producers. Released in August 1976 &quot;This Is Niecy&quot; rose to Nos. 3 and 33 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts respectively. &quot;This Is Niecy&quot; has also been certified Gold in the United States by the RIAA and silver in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry. An album cut, &quot;Free&quot;, got to Nos. 1, 2 &amp; 25 on the UK Singles, &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B Songs and Hot 100 charts respectively. Another single being &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot; rose to No. 8 on the UK Singles chart.

A few months before the release of &quot;This Is Niecy&quot;, Charles Stepney died. White went on to single handedly produce Williams&#x27; second album, &quot;Song Bird&quot;, released in October 1977. The album rose to No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart. Simon Gage of &quot;The Daily Express&quot; found Songbird is &quot;filled with gorgeous songs that showcase her four-octave range to full effect&quot;. John Rockwell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also wrote &quot;Deniece Williams&#x27;s “Song Bird” is a most appealing album for anyone who likes varied, skillful and sophisticated singing in the black pop area. One can&#x27;t be more stylistically precise than that because it is a characteristic of Maurice White&#x27;s production and Miss Williams&#x27;s virtuousically diverse singing that her disk ambles all over the stylistic map. But instead of sounding diffuse, it sounds refreshingly varied.&quot;
A tune from the album called &quot;Baby, Baby My Love&#x27;s All for You&quot;, reached No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 32 UK Singles chart.

Williams guested on Roberta Flack&#x27;s 1977 album, &quot;Blue Lights in the Basement&quot;, and sang along with Maurice White on Weather Report&#x27;s 1978 album, &quot;Mr. Gone&quot;.
Williams also recorded a duet with Johnny Mathis, called &quot;Too Much, Too Little, Too Late&quot; that reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Hot Soul Songs and Adult Contemporary Songs charts.

Williams went on to issue a duet album with Johnny Mathis dubbed That&#x27;s What Friends Are For in 1978 on Columbia for Kalimba Productions. Paul Sexton of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; commented &quot;their coupling is quite satisfactory from an artistic point of view.&quot; Dennis Hunt of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that &quot;Mathis&#x27; duets with Williams have rescued him from the MOR graveyard and given him new life in the pop/R&amp;B market. This album, far superior to the last featuring this pair, brims with romantic material. To make sure no one mistakes these songs for MOR, producer Jack Gold has tacked on sprightly rhythm tracks which turn some of them into gentle rockers.&quot; 

A cover from the album of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell&#x27;s You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By peaked at No. 5 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Canadian Adult Contemporary Songs chart, No. 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Singles Chart and No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary songs chart.
The LP rose to No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart and No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. That&#x27;s What Friends Are For has also been certified Gold in the US by the RIAA.

William&#x27;s fourth studio recording, &quot;When Love Comes Calling&quot; was issued in 1979 by ARC Records (ARC), Maurice White&#x27;s vanity label on Columbia. Connie Johnson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; proclaimed &quot;This album (coproduced by Raydio&#x27;s Ray Parker Jr.), nicely showcases Williams&#x27; expressive voice, and those translucent high C&#x27;s she&#x27;s capable of reaching.&quot; The album rose to No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart. A single from the album, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the Next Dance&quot;, rose to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Club Play chart.

Williams issued her follow-up album, &quot;My Melody&quot;, in 1981 on Columbia/ARC. The Philadelphia Inquirer opined &quot;Although her roots are R&amp;B, Miss Williams transcends easy categorisation with this collection of material and her versatile presentation.&quot; Stephen Holden of the New York Times also found that &quot;My Melody, Miss Williams&#x27;s fourth solo album, is an inspired collaboration with Thom Bell, the Philadelphia songwriter and producer whose hits with the Stylistics and the Spinners in the early 70&#x27;s epitomized pop-soul elegance.&quot; The album rose to No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soul Albums chart. My Melody has been certified Gold in the US by the RIAA.
The single, &quot;Silly&quot;, reached No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart.

Williams issued her follow-up album, &quot;Niecy&quot;, in 1982 on Columbia/ARC. The album reached No. 5 on the Top Soul Albums chart and No. 20 on the Billboard 200. With a B+ Robert Christgau of the Village Voice found &quot;Williams&#x27;s exquisite clarity and thrilling range have always slotted her among the perfect angels for me, but there&#x27;s a lot more to her work with Thom Bell, who finally challenges Burt Bacharach on his own turf, applying strings and woodwinds and amplifiers with a deft economy that textures rather than sweetens. And Williams&#x27;s lyrics, while never startling, become increasingly personal as her professional confidence grows--she&#x27;s wrinkling her brow more and her nose less.&quot; Crispin Cioe of High Fidelity found &quot;as a writer, Williams deals in the unabashedly romantic; as a singer she lends her lines an emotionalism that rings true. In Bell&#x27;s sympathetically rich arranging/production context small sentiments take on grand proportions, and therein lies the album&#x27;s charm.&quot;
A cover of the Royalettes&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Take a Miracle&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Williams and Mathis collaborated once again to record &quot;Without Us&quot; the theme song of the sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot; which debuted in September 1982.

In the Netherlands the album track &quot;It&#x27;s Your Conscience&quot; had been released as a single. It climbed to No. 15 on the Dutch Top 40 charts.

During 1983 she released her seventh studio album, &quot;I&#x27;m So Proud&quot;, which got to No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B Albums chart. Connie Johnson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The album works due to fresh-sounding, quality material. This is black pop at its most enterprising.&quot; I&#x27;m So Proud was also nominated for a Grammy in the Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Female category. During 1984, Williams released her follow up album &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It for the Boy&quot;. This album reached No. 26 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Albums chart and No. 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hop-Hop Albums chart. The title track reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Hot Soul Songs and Dance Club Play Songs charts. The hit single was eventually certified Platinum in the US by the RIAA, Gold in Canada by Music Canada and Gold the UK by the BPI. Additionally, the song was featured on the soundtrack to the feature film &quot;Footloose&quot;. She later guested on Johnny Mathis&#x27; 1984 album &quot;A Special Part of Me&quot;, Stevie Wonder&#x27;s 1985 LP, &quot;In Square Circle&quot; and James Taylor&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;That&#x27;s Why I&#x27;m Here&quot;.

===Gospel (1980–1987)===
Although Williams had recorded one inspirational song on almost each of her mainstream albums, it was in 1980 that her musical career path began to change favoring Gospel music. Williams joined with friends Philip Bailey of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire fame, Billy Davis and Marilyn McCoo to present a gospel show at The Roxy, a popular Los Angeles club: &quot;Jesus at the Roxy&quot;. Williams later reported that &quot;God did something miraculous. Over three hundred people were saved.&quot; In 1985, at the 27th Annual Grammy Awards, Williams sang an a cappella version of her 1977 composition &quot;God Is Amazing&quot;, a Gospel song, rather than her No. 1 song &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It for the Boy&quot;, much to her record company&#x27;s disdain.

During 1986, her first gospel studio album, &quot;So Glad I Know&quot;, was released on Sparrow Records, and got to No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Christian Albums chart and was nominated for Best Gospel Performance, Female Grammy. &quot;They Say&quot;, a duet with Sandi Patti, Williams won the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group, Choir or Chorus and for &quot;I Surrender All&quot;, she won the Grammy Award for Best Soul Gospel Performance, Female.

===R&amp;B, Gospel and Jazz (1987–2000)===
During 1987 she released her tenth studio album, Water Under the Bridge, which rose to No. 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B Albums chart. &quot;Never Say Never&quot; reached No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B Songs chart and No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart.

A year later she released her follow-up studio album, &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot;, which rose to No. 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B Albums chart. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Wait&quot; charted at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B Songs chart. Another single, &quot;This Is as Good as It Gets&quot;, rose to No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B Songs chart.

During 1989, she issued her second Gospel album &quot;Special Love&quot;.
That album reached No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Christian Albums chart.

Williams went on to appear on Nancy Wilson&#x27;s 1990 LP A Lady with a Song, George Duke&#x27;s 1992 album Snapshot, Stevie Wonder&#x27;s 1995 LP Conversation Peace and Spyro Gyra&#x27;s 1995 album Love &amp; Other Obsessions. During 1999 she released another Gospel album, &quot;This Is My Song&quot;, on Harmony Records. The album rose to No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Gospel Albums chart. As well This Is My Song won a Grammy Award for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album.

===Later years (2000–present)===
In April 2007 she later released another studio album entitled &quot;Love, Niecy Style&quot;, produced by Philly Soul veteran Bobby Eli, on Shanachie Records. Love, Niecy Style rose to No. 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums chart. On October 13, 2007, Williams performed in her hometown of Gary, Indiana at the re-opening of the historic Glen Theater. Williams was thereafter recognized by Indiana State Representative Vernon G. Smith as an Outstanding Hoosier.

In October 2007 Williams went on to issue a single called, &quot;Grateful: The Rededication&quot;, with Wanda Vaughn of The Emotions and Sherree Brown. The single got to No. 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult R&amp;B Songs chart.

On April 29, 2008, Williams announced that she was preparing a proposal to establish a program called KOP—Kids of Promise—in her hometown of Gary, Indiana. Williams said the program would include a center with classes and programs dedicated to education and the performing arts. On June 27, 2010, Williams performed &quot;Silly&quot; with Monica at the BET Awards. As well in June 2011, Williams featured on &quot;Unsung&quot;, TV One&#x27;s musical biography show.

She later guested on Cliff Richard&#x27;s 2011 album Soulicious.

In the fall of 2020 she released a new single called &quot;When You Love Somebody&quot;. This was followed by a new EP titled &quot;Gemini&quot;, released in the fall of 2021. On June 30, 2021, she was honored as one of the first ever inductees into the Women Songwriters Hall of Fame. Williams was, on May 16, 2023, also bestowed with the keys to the city of Kingston, Jamaica.

== Filmography ==
Williams appeared in the 2004 holiday movie &quot;Christmas Child&quot;. During December 2005 she appeared on the reality-dating show &quot;Elimidate&quot; as part of their &quot;Celebrity Week&quot;.

== Vocal profile ==
Deniece Williams has a four-octave range and distinctive soprano voice. Her vocal range was also pointed out by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Miss Williams mounted a spectacular vocal display in which her penetrating, feline soprano soared effortlessly to E flat above high C, and she worked various vowel sounds into prolonged feats of vocal gymnastics.&quot; In pointing to Williams&#x27;s similar vocal ability as her former musical icon and colleague (Minnie Riperton), Mark Anthony Neal, in referencing Jill Scott&#x27;s agility in displaying vocal acrobatics, states, &quot;Scott draws on her upper register recalling the artistry of the late Minnie Riperton and &quot;songbird&quot; Deniece Williams.&quot; According to Monica Haynes of Post-Gazette.com, Williams &quot;has the kind of range that would make Mariah Carey quiver&quot;.

==Personal life==

<text>Khomasdal Constituency (until 2013: Khomasdal North Constituency) is a constituency in Windhoek in the Khomas Region of Namibia. it had 25,550 registered voters. The constituency consists of parts of the suburbs Khomasdal, Katutura, and Otjomuise. It had a population of 43,921 in 2011, up from 27,950 in 2001.

==Politics==
Khomasdal is traditionally a stronghold of the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO) party. The first councillor of this constituency was SWAPO&#x27;s Karel Persendt. In 1998, Margaret Mensah-Williams, also on a SWAPO ticket, took over from him. She was subsequently selected to represent Khomas Region in the National Council, and in 1999 she became its vice-chairperson (deputy speaker), the first woman to be elected to a major decision-making position in Namibia. Mensah-Williams was re-elected in 2004 and 2010. She also won the 2015 regional elections with 4,121 votes. Sylvester Kazapua of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) came second with 723 votes. Uzikama Kandjii of the National Unity Democratic Organisation (NUDO, 384 votes) and Bartholomeus Kauahuma of the South West Africa National Union (SWANU, 170 votes) also contested this election. 

After councillor Mensah-Williams was fielded as a parliamentary candidate in the 2019 Namibian general election, a by-election became necessary for Khomasdal because Namibian electoral law prohibits sitting councillors and members of the public service to run for a seat in parliament. The by-election was conducted on 15 January 2020. Samuel Angolo (SWAPO) won with 1,227 votes, followed by Mara Baumgartner (Landless People&#x27;s Movement (LPM), 349 votes), Raymond Diergaardt (Popular Democratic Movement (PDM), 326 votes) and Bartholomeus Kauahuma (SWANU, 202 votes). Councillor Angolo of SWAPO was re-elected in the 2020 regional election receiving 2,337 votes. Frans Wilbard of the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020, came second with 1,503 votes. This election was also contested by the LPM (candidate Christiaan Tseitseimou, 1,285 votes), the PDM (Nadine Pienaar, 881 votes), and the NUDO (Sylvester Kazapua, 679 votes).

<text>Kerry Scott Conran is an American film director and screenwriter, best known for creating and directing the 2004 pulp science fiction film &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot;.

==Early life and influences==
Conran was born in Flint, Michigan. He was educated at the California Institute of the Arts. He grew up watching such classic adventure movies and serials as &quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, &quot;Metropolis&quot;, and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; on a local television channel.

He was impressed by the whimsy and imagination of these films. He explained in an interview with John Joseph Adams that the adventure films of the 1930s era were not limited by what was practical, but only by the imaginations of the creators. He stated that he found this element lacking in most modern adventure films, which he described as &quot;almost too well informed... and more cynical&quot;. As a result, he had aspired ever since his childhood to create an adventure film or serial in the same vein as the aforementioned escapist adventures of the 1930s. He spent much of his childhood making short super-8 movies. Upon becoming an adult, he entered the California Institute of Arts. Although he was enrolled in a live-action course, he became enamored with the abilities of those in animation courses to create whatever was in their imagination. He realized that they were not bound by such things as practicality or the rules of physics, but only by their imaginations. As a result, he devised the idea of making a film with live actors, but computer-generated backgrounds.

==Career==
When he had fully figured out how he was going to go about making the movie, he enlisted the help of his brother Kevin and a few friends. At first, he planned to make a feature-length seven-chapter serial, which he would release independently. He eventually decided to make only a six-minute teaser instead, as it would take him several decades to create the backgrounds for a full-length feature. He set up a blue-screen in his apartment, and some of his friends acted in the roles. He created the backgrounds for the black and white short over the course of four years with his Mac computer. He could not afford better equipment, so he used equipment given him in payment for projects that he worked on, such as desktop publishing of articles. His computer (including the equipment he earned) was outdated and slow. He dropped out of society, and spent all of his free time creating the short, working only enough to support himself and his project. He later remarked that he &quot;had no life&quot;, and would sometimes hide under his desk in a fetal position, feeling tempted to give up on his project.

He modeled the tone and visuals of the short on the cinematography in &quot;The Third Man&quot;, and based the look of the robots featured in the short on those in the Superman cartoon &quot;The Mechanical Monsters&quot;. The short took four years to complete. When finished, it was entitled &quot;Sky Captain and the Flying Legion In: The World of Tomorrow - Chapter One: The Mechanical Monsters&quot;, but it is usually referred to merely as &quot;The World of Tomorrow&quot;.

Kevin Conran invited Marsha Oglesby, a movie producer and friend of his wife, to look at the short. She was impressed by the scope and ambition of the short, especially as it was made entirely in Kerry Conran&#x27;s apartment. She referred the Conran brothers to producer Jon Avnet, who agreed to help the Conran brothers make a feature-length film, and found funding for the project. Kerry Conran wrote and directed the feature-length film, entitled &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot;, Kevin Conran served as the concept artist, production designer, and costume designer, and his younger sister Kirsten served as art director. At first, Kerry Conran intended for the film to be a seven-part black and white serial, but Jon Avnet convinced him to make it without chapters, and in color. As a result, Kerry Conran and visual effects supervisor Darin Hollings developed a color style based on two-strip and three-strip Technicolor. &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot; was filmed, for the most part, entirely on blue-screen, with backgrounds, lighting, and other effects added in post-production. However, due to time and budget constraints, one set was partially built, and another was fully built. &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot; was released in 2004, by Paramount Pictures. It was given fairly favorable reviews by critics, but did not do well at the box office.

Afterwards, Conran was slated to direct &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot;, an adaptation of the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, after having initially turned it down twice. Before production could commence, Sherry Lansing stepped down from Paramount and the studio had lost interest in the project. Conran, who had replaced Robert Rodriguez, was replaced by Jon Favreau after leaving the project. Paramount executives decided not to continue with the project, citing their desire to put their resources toward the Star Trek franchise. Disney then picked up the option for Pixar&#x27;s Andrew Stanton to direct. Conran planned to work on an original project with friend and former schoolmate Robert Gordon. He has stated that he prefers to adapt original material.

Conran directed a 2006 Christmas-themed Coca-Cola commercial entitled &quot;The Greatest Gift&quot;, on which he served as production designer along with other key &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot; collaborators, including Eric Adkins and Erik Jessen.

In 2012, Conran and &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot; collaborator Stephen Lawes co-directed a short film written by Conran entitled &quot;Gumdrop&quot;. &quot;Sky Captain&quot; collaborators Jon Avnet, Marsha Oglesby, Sean Cushing, Todd Toon, and Kevin Chalk were also involved in making the short. Conran also worked on the 2012 proof of concept short film &quot;Monster Roll&quot;, along with &quot;Sky Captain&quot; collaborators Dan Blank (who directed the short), Eric Adkins, Erik Jessen, and Takashi Takeoka.

Conran at one point was to direct &quot;Truckers&quot; for DreamWorks Animation before the project was shelved. He was to also collaborate with Sam Raimi on an adaptation of &quot;The Shadow&quot; and a separate project based on &quot;Doc Savage&quot;. Sony Pictures, which held the rights to both characters, lost interest in both projects sometime afterwards. Following a string of films that failed to go into production, Conran opted to step away from the limelight, &quot;I decided I was just going to disappear, I&#x27;d just do my own stuff, and that&#x27;s basically what I&#x27;ve been doing. I&#x27;ve not been idle, I&#x27;ve been doing stuff that&#x27;s more about the experimentation [of &quot;Sky Captain&quot;].&quot; He is open to making more films and has shown some admiration towards the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

==Legacy==
&quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot; has come to be considered a landmark in special effects, as it is the first major motion picture to be shot completely on blue-screen with computer-generated backgrounds (with the exception of the two sets built due to time and budget constraints), and is the film that brought this medium into vogue. Such films as &quot;Sin City&quot;, &quot;300&quot;, and &quot;The Spirit&quot; are all influenced by &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot; in this respect. However, Kerry Conran has stated that he did not intend to create a new genre or medium, nor did he use his method of shooting on blue-screen as a gimmick. In his interview with John Joseph Adams, he stated: &quot;I have always come at this from the perspective of filmmaking and developed the techniques used in this film out of necessity and never really sought to interest other computer aficionados&quot;. However, he did acknowledge that his film had indeed become influential, albeit unintentionally: &quot;That wasn&#x27;t really the intention. Whether or not that what evolved from this maybe... which is a possibility. The intention was to tell that particular story with those particular visuals that we used... and if history says it’s something else...&quot;.

<text>John William Oates (born April 7, 1948) is an American musician, best known as half of the rock and soul duo Hall &amp; Oates along with Daryl Hall. He has played rock, R&amp;B, and soul music, serving as a guitarist, singer, songwriter, and record producer.

Although Oates&#x27;s main role in the duo is being the guitarist, he also co-wrote many of the top 10 songs that they recorded, including: &quot;Sara Smile&quot; (referring to Hall&#x27;s then-girlfriend, Sara Allen), &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot;, and &quot;Out of Touch&quot;, as well as &quot;You Make My Dreams&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go for That (No Can Do)&quot;, &quot;Maneater&quot;, and &quot;Adult Education&quot;. He also sang lead vocals on several more singles in the Hot 100, such as &quot;How Does It Feel to Be Back&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; (a remake of the 1965 song performed by the Righteous Brothers), and &quot;Possession Obsession&quot;. In 1986, Oates contributed the song &quot;(She&#x27;s the) Shape of Things to Come&quot; on the soundtrack to the 1986 film &quot;About Last Night&quot;. He also co-wrote and sang backup on the song &quot;Electric Blue&quot;, recorded by the Australian band Icehouse, which was a &quot;Billboard&quot; top 10 hit.

Oates was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2004, and in 2014 was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of Hall &amp; Oates. His memoir, &quot;Change of Seasons&quot;, was published in 2017.

==Early life and education==
Oates was born in New York City on April 7, 1948. Oates&#x27;s memoir states his mother was Italian, and his father was a Gibraltarian of mixed background: Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Moorish (Berber and/or Arab). He was raised in North Wales in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

He attended North Penn High School in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, where he was co-captain of the 1965-66 wrestling team his senior year and was Section 2 champion in the weight class. Oates turned down college wrestling scholarships and opted to attend Temple University in North Philadelphia instead because &quot;it was in the city.&quot; Oates wrestled as a freshman for the Temple Owls and then &quot;got tired of losing weight.&quot;

==Career==
In 1966, he recorded his first single, &quot;I Need Your Love&quot;, with a group named The Masters for Philadelphia-based Crimson Records. After graduating from North Penn High School in 1966, John enrolled in Temple University in Philadelphia, where he met Daryl Hall, a senior at Temple who was also a professional musician. The two were involved in several college bands, then formed the duo Hall &amp; Oates, and by 1972, they had signed with Atlantic Records. Hall &amp; Oates went on to record 21 albums (to date), which have sold over 80 million units worldwide, making them arguably the most successful duo in pop–rock history. They have scored ten number-one records and over 20 Top 40 hits and have toured the world for decades. Their involvement in the original Live Aid concert and the charity single &quot;We Are the World&quot;, both in 1985, established them further as artists. Their influence on modern American pop music and considerable contributions have been acknowledged by numerous contemporary bands, including Gym Class Heroes and the Killers.

Despite 30 years as a chart-topping performer and sought-after producer, Oates did not release a solo album until 2002&#x27;s &quot;Phunk Shui&quot;.

Oates took part, along with Jamie Cullum, in the song &quot;Greatest Mistake&quot; by Handsome Boy Modeling School. The song appears on the 2004 album &quot;White People&quot;.

Oates&#x27; second solo album, &quot;1000 Miles of Life&quot;, was released on August 23, 2008.

As reported by &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2008, Oates was shopping an animated series titled &quot;J-Stache&quot;, created by Evan Duby at Primary Wave Music Publishing.

On October 1, 2011, Margo Rey charted at #24 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Adult Contemporary Tracks with the song &quot;Let the Rain&quot;, which was co-written by Oates.

On March 11, 2013, Oates released a new single, &quot;Stand Strong&quot;, which he co-wrote with Teddy Morgan. &quot;Stand Strong&quot; is part of &quot;Good Road to Follow&quot;, a set of original songs released as digital singles, one after the other. In 2015, Oates released &quot;Another Good Road&quot;, a DVD and Live CD combination via PS Records / Warner Elektra, which also debuted as a television special on the Palladia music channel. The DVD was shot live in a recording studio in Nashville, Tennessee, and features rare footage of his home in Woody Creek, Colorado.

His memoir &quot;Change of Seasons&quot; was co-written with Chris Epting and published on March 28, 2017, by St. Martin&#x27;s Press.

He released an album with his new backing band, &quot;The Good Road Band&quot;, titled &quot;Arkansas&quot;, on February 2, 2018. Oates commented that the album serves as a connection back to his pre-Hall &amp; Oates music interest of traditional delta, country blues, and ragtime.

Oates has used many instruments and effects throughout his musical career and endorses several manufacturers and brands. Some of the companies endorsed by Oates include Taylor Guitars, Voyage Air Guitars, Neunaber Audio, LR Baggs, and Fishman.

In November 2023, Daryl Hall sued John Oates and filed a temporary restraining order against him, for initially undisclosed reasons. The following week, Hall filed a declaration accusing Oates of &quot;the ultimate partnership betrayal&quot; for planning to sell his share of the duo&#x27;s publishing to Primary Wave Music. Oates responded that Hall&#x27;s statements were &quot;inflammatory, outlandish, and inaccurate&quot;.

Also in 2023, Oates competed in season ten of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Anteater&quot;. He was eliminated during the Group C finals in &quot;Soundtrack of My Life&quot; alongside Keyshia Cole as &quot;Candelabra&quot;.

==Personal life==
Oates was previously married to former model Nancy Hunter. He and his second wife, Aimee, have a son named Tanner (born 1996). They split their time between Woody Creek, Colorado, and Nashville, Tennessee.

Oates became friends with Hunter S. Thompson when he moved to Woody Creek in the late 1980s, and the pair maintained a close bond until Thompson&#x27;s suicide in 2005.

<text>John Pandeni constituency, formerly known as Soweto, is an electoral constituency in the Khomas Region of Namibia. In 2008, it was renamed after John Pandeni, a member of the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO) and its militant wing, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). Pandeni was the first regional councillor for the former Soweto constituency and the first governor of Khomas. This constituency is inside the city of Windhoek in the formerly all-Black suburb of Katutura. It had a population of 15,121 in 2011, up from 13,865 in 2001. , it has 14,758 registered voters.

==Politics==
John Pandeni Constituency is traditionally a stronghold of the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO) party. In the 2004 regional election, SWAPO candidate Rakel Jacob received 2.079 of the 3,080 votes cast and became councillor. In the 2015 regional election SWAPO also won by a landslide. Jakob was reelected with 2,996 votes, followed by Steve Kevanhu of the Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP, 375 votes). 

The SWAPO candidate also won the 2020 regional election, albeit by a much smaller margin. Shaalukeni Moonde received 1,696 votes, followed by Abraham Nakantinda of the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020, with 827 votes and Duminga Ndala of the Landless People&#x27;s Movement (LPM, also a new party, registered in 2018) with 825 votes.

<doc id="953243" wikidata="Q5492835" url="?curid=953243" title="Franz Jozef van Beeck">
<text>Frans Jozef Van Beeck or Franz Jozef van Beeck, also known as Joep van Beeck (June 11, 1930 – October 12, 2011), was a Dutch author and Christian theologian who was also a prominent priest of the Society of Jesus.

Born in Helmond, Netherlands, he entered the Jesuit religious order in 1948 after studies at the Jesuit Aloysius College in The Hague. He received a doctorate in English from the University of Amsterdam in 1961 and was ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood in 1963. From 1968 to 1985, Van Beeck taught theology at Boston College in Boston, Massachusetts. He then moved to Loyola University Chicago in Chicago, Illinois where he served as John Cardinal Cody Professor of Theology until his retirement in 2002. From 2006 until his death, he resided in Nijmegen, Netherlands.

Van Beeck wrote hundreds of thousands of pages of letters, treatises and books used today in Christian colleges and universities throughout the world. His most famous theological work is an ambitious series of six books called &quot;God Encountered: A Contemporary Catholic Systematic Theology&quot; (Liturgical Press).

Some of his most controversial works considered the issues arising from World War II. Critics challenged van Beeck&#x27;s attempt to define a single universal theme in the overall tragedy of the Holocaust. They believed that such an attempt to explain the Holocaust as a metaphor or symbol was dangerous and could lead to a minimalization of the horrors of the mass murder.

Van Beeck&#x27;s &quot;Christ Proclaimed: Christology as Rhetoric&quot; (1979) is a significant synthesis of theological reflection in christology with a distinctive consideration of rhetoric and the Christian proclamation. Van Beeck&#x27;s thought about rhetoric and proclamation culminated in the publication of the article &quot;Divine Revelation: Intervention or Self-Communication&quot; in &quot;Theological Studies&quot; 52 (1991): 199–226.

In 2006, Sacred Heart University Press published his &quot;Driven under the Influence: Selected Essays in Theology 1974–2004&quot;.

<doc id="953245" wikidata="Q907358" url="?curid=953245" title="Bremen (aircraft)">
<text>The Bremen is a German Junkers W 33 aircraft that made the first successful transatlantic aeroplane flight from east to west on April 12 and 13, 1928.

After weather delays lasting 17 days, the &quot;Bremen&quot; left Baldonnel Aerodrome, Ireland, on April 12 with a three man crew, arriving at Greenly Island, Canada, on April 13, after a flight fraught with difficult conditions and compass problems.

Owner Ehrenfried Günther Freiherr von Hünefeld, a wealthy German aristocrat, and pilot Captain Hermann Köhl had made an all-German attempt at the feat in 1927, but had to abandon it due to bad weather. For this new attempt, they were joined by a third crewman, Irish navigator Major James Fitzmaurice. Fitzmaurice had also previously attempted the crossing, as co-pilot of the &quot;Princess Xenia (aircraft)&quot; with Robert Henry McIntosh, but they had to abandon the attempt due to high headwinds in September 1927.

==Flight log==

* 12 Apr, 05:09 GMT: Started engine of the &quot;Bremen&quot; at Baldonnel Aerodrome (about southwest of Dublin). 
* 12 Apr, 05:38 GMT: Lifted off from Baldonnel Airport and headed west. 
* 12 Apr, 07:05 GMT: The &quot;Bremen&quot; passed the Slyne Head Lighthouse in County Galway, started across the Atlantic, and headed for Mitchel Field, Long Island, New York while maintaining an altitude of and an airspeed of 
* 12 Apr, 09:00 GMT: The crew started their first meal aloft: hot bouillon and sandwiches. 
* 12 Apr, 13:45 GMT: &quot;Bremen&quot; crossed the 30th meridian west. Surface speed was over . 
* 12 Apr, 16:00 GMT: &quot;Bremen&quot; climbed to . 
* 12 Apr, 21:00 GMT: Crew made their last drift calculation. When the sun disappeared and the clouds obscured the stars, the &quot;Bremen&quot; climbed to . Köhl estimated that they were then about three hours from land. If they had been able to stay on course, his estimate would have proven to have been correct. In fact, without the aid of the north star, they then relied on a magnetic compass and drifted far off course toward the north. 
* 13 Apr, 06:50 GMT: They saw Polaris again. Fitzmaurice then estimated that their magnetic compass was in error by 40 degrees. Köhl immediately turned southwesterly to follow the east coast of North America towards Mitchel Field on New York&#x27;s Long Island, which was then about south of the &quot;Bremen&quot;. They flew among the Torngat Mountains of Labrador (then part of the Dominion of Newfoundland) and then, unable to recognize any landmarks, followed the George River upstream in the northeastern part of the Canadian province of Quebec. In order to minimize the adverse effect of a strong southwest wind, Köhl descended into the George River Valley and flew at an altitude of . 
* 13 Apr, 14:00 GMT: The &quot;Bremen&quot; passed over the lakes at the source of the George. The crew saw nobody on the ground but people on the ground sighted the plane. 
* 13 Apr, 15:00 GMT: The &quot;Bremen&quot; had crossed back into Labrador, and was seen flying over North West River on the shore of Lake Melville.
* 13 April: At about 17:50 GMT, with about two hours of fuel remaining, and only a general knowledge of their location, the crew spotted a lighthouse on an island with a pack of dogs and four people. The island was Greenly Island in the Strait of Belle Isle, which separates the island of Newfoundland from Labrador and Quebec on the mainland. Greenly Island, only in size, lies about off the Quebec mainland.

== Landing ==

Greenly Island is small, barren and rocky. It was fortunate for the crew that the airplane landed in a peat bog. The relatively soft landing saved them but damaged the plane.

The clock in the lighthouse was remembered (by the family of the lighthouse keeper) as indicating 2 p.m. Atlantic Time when the &quot;Bremen&quot; was first sighted from the ground. Captain Köhl and Baron von Hünefeld said that they had been in the air for 36½ hours. If their statements of elapsed time had an accuracy of better than one minute, which is unlikely, then the time of touchdown was 18:08 GMT or 13:08 EST or 14:08 Atlantic Time.

Gretta May Ferris, a nurse from Saint John, New Brunswick, who was posted at nearby Forteau&#x27;s Grenfell Medical Station, travelled by dogsled some to attend to the crew&#x27;s medical needs; she was the first to write the story that was picked up by the international media saying that the &quot;Bremen&quot; had landed and that the crew were safe.
Alfred Cormier of Long Point (Lourdes-de-Blanc-Sablon), who operated the local telegraph office from his home, made contact with Marconi station VCL at Point Amour in Labrador—18 miles (29 km) east of Long Point. From there, his message went through St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland (at 6:30 p.m.) and Louisbourg, Nova Scotia. It was forwarded by land lines across Canada and via Radio Corporation of America (RCA) station WCC at Chatham, Massachusetts, for transmission to New York City.

The first message read: &quot;German plane at Greenly Island, wind southeast, thick [fog].&quot;

A short time later, a second message was sent: &quot;German plane Bremen landed Greenly Island, noon, slightly damaged, crew well.&quot;

By 7:15 p.m., the story was in all the newsrooms of the eastern seaboard.

The first Canadian aircraft to reach the scene was piloted by Duke Schiller and the second machine was flown by Canadian Transcontinental Airways (1927–38) Chief Pilot, Romeo Vachon, who arrived two days later with a group of media representatives. Both Schiller and Vachon were flying Fairchild FC-2W machines; G-CAIQ (Schiller) and G-CAIP (Vachon). Ultimately, some 60 journalists would crowd onto the island to report on the successful crossing. The &quot;Bremen&quot; crew did not depart the island for two weeks as they attempted to repair the aircraft, but they were ultimately unsuccessful.

The crew of the &quot;Bremen&quot; was rescued by a Ford Trimotor flown by veteran pilots Bernt Balchen (who would later pilot the first aircraft over the South Pole) and Floyd Bennett (who had piloted the first aircraft over the North Pole, in 1926). Bennett was suffering from pneumonia and died in hospital after the flight. On their arrival in New York on April 30, the &quot;Bremen&quot;&#x27;s crew were honoured with a tickertape parade.

On 2 May, the 70th United States Congress authorized President Calvin Coolidge to confer the United States Distinguished Flying Cross on the Bremen Flyers. Back in Ireland on 30 June 1928, they were bestowed the Freedom of the City of Dublin in recognition of their trans-Atlantic flight achievement

Later in 1928 they published a book about their experience called (in English) &quot;The Three Musketeers of the Air&quot;.

The &quot;Bremen&quot; belongs to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, and is on display in a hangar at the Bremen Airport Museum.

<text>Donzaleigh Abernathy (born August 5, 1957) is an American actress, author and civil rights activist.

== Early life ==
Abernathy’s mother was pregnant with her when her parents’ home was bombed in the pre-dawn hours of January 10, 1957 after the successful close of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Abernathy was born in the segregated St. Jude’s Hospital Montgomery, Alabama and lived there through the “Freedom Riders” movement. In 1962, at the request of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., her family moved to Atlanta, Georgia where she grew up. There, her father, Dr. Ralph David Abernathy, Sr. continued his work co-leading the Civil Rights Movement with Dr. King. In 1965, after participating in “The Selma to Montgomery March for the Right To Vote,” the Abernathy children, along with the King children integrated Spring Street Elementary School and began mass integration of public schools in the South. Abernathy briefly attended the Northside High School for the Performing Arts, before attending and graduating from George School, a Quaker Prep School in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

Her father was Rev. Dr. Ralph Abernathy, a co-founder and co-leader of the American civil rights movement, and her mother was the life long civil rights activist Juanita Jones Abernathy. She, her sister Juandalynn and brother Ralph David III joined their parents on all the major civil rights marches and witnessed first-hand many significant events of the Civil Rights movement. Her family was very close to that of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, a prominent leader of the Civil Rights movement. The Abernathy and King children went to school together, performed extracurricular activities together, spent Saturday and Sunday dinners together, as well as spent vacations and holidays together. According to Ms. Abernathy herself, children from both families would hold performances for their parents and their childhood acting teacher Mr. Walter Roberts, the father of movie stars Julia Roberts and Eric Roberts, on these occasions with Yolanda King, one of King&#x27;s daughters, acting as the director and Dr. King filming their performances. Abernathy has stated &quot;that&#x27;s really when [she] started acting.&quot; She is married to actor/producer Dar Dixon.

== Career ==
After graduating from Emerson College in Boston, Abernathy moved to New York. She landed her first job after auditioning for a role with the Off Off Broadway production and worked for the Production Designer Eugene Lee and Costume Designer Franne Lee of “Saturday Night Live.” She played Lady in Orange in the Alliance Theater’s Southeastern Equity Tour of “For Colored Girls” and Iris in the Alliance Theater’s “Antony and Cleopatra“ with Jane Alexander and Ed Moore. Since then, Ms. Abernathy has played roles in many movies and television movies, such as Mrs. Don King in the Award Winning HBO Drama “Don King, Only in America.” In the historical Civil War drama &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;, she portrays the slave, Martha. Although the film itself was not critically well-received, Abernathy was praised for her part by film critic Roger Ebert. Another reviewer stated that &quot;Abernathy&#x27;s image of Martha combines strength with glamour.&quot; She starred for four years as a series regular on Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;Any Day Now&quot;. Born in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement after her parents’ home was bombed, Ms. Abernathy’s life has been dedicated to civil and human rights.

<text>Montell Du&#x27;Sean Jordan (born December 3, 1968) is an American singer, pastor, songwriter, and record producer. Best known for his 1995 single &quot;This Is How We Do It&quot;, Jordan was the primary male solo artist on Def Jam&#x27;s Def Soul imprint until leaving the label in 2003. He is also known for his 1998 hit single &quot;Let&#x27;s Ride&quot; featuring Master P and Silkk the Shocker.

In 2010, Jordan became the worship leader at Victory World Church in Norcross, Georgia.

==Early life and education==
Montell Jordan was born in South Central Los Angeles to Elijah and Delois Jordan. Born into a Baptist family, Jordan attended his local church frequently as a child, where his mother and father worked as deacons. Growing up, Jordan played piano for his church as a musician. In the mid-1980s, he attended Junipero Serra High School in Gardena, California, as well as Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in communications. He became a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity in the spring of 1989. Jordan graduated in 1991.

After graduating, Jordan started working for Williams Television Time, where he helped make TV infomercials. In an attempt to jump-start his career as a musician, Jordan invited his coworkers to see him perform at a showcase. According to interviews with Jordan, musicians Janet Jackson and Shanice Wilson attended the show. From there he made his first mix-tape and flew out to New York with producer Russell Simmons of Def Jam Records. He signed to Def Jam in 1995, becoming the second R&amp;B artist to sign with the label.

==Musical career==
Jordan&#x27;s first single was the 1995 No. 1 hit &quot;This Is How We Do It&quot;, which sampled Slick Rick&#x27;s earlier Def Jam hit &quot;Children&#x27;s Story&quot;. According to interviews with Jordan, the song is a &quot;reflection of what street life was for a kid who grew up in the neighborhood.&quot; The single reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and remained there for seven consecutive weeks. Thanks to the enormous success of the single, Jordan&#x27;s first album went platinum, selling over a million copies.

In 1996, Jordan opened for Boyz II Men in Vancouver. During the performance a stage flare disoriented him, causing him to fall off the seven-foot stage and hit his head. Despite being taken to the hospital, Jordan sustained no injuries. Jordan would later describe the event as a &quot;modern-day miracle&quot; and that he owed his life to Boyz II Men.

Jordan followed up his success with &quot;Somethin&#x27; 4 da Honeyz&quot;, which peaked at No. 21. Later hits included &quot;Let&#x27;s Ride&quot; with Master P and Silkk the Shocker and &quot;I Like&quot;. He co-wrote, produced and sang back-up on Shae Jones&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Talk Show&quot;. The Jordan single &quot;Get It On Tonite&quot; peaked at No. 4 in the same year.

In addition to crafting his own material, Jordan has written and produced for other artists, including Christina Milian, 98 Degrees, Shae Jones, Deborah Cox (&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Supposed to Be Here&quot;, 1998), Lil&#x27; Mo (&quot;Ta Da&quot;, 2000), and Sisqó (the number-one hit &quot;Incomplete&quot;, 2000). The singer had a comedic supporting role in the film &quot;The Fighting Temptations&quot; as Mr. Johnson, an aggressive convict who is self-conscious about his high-pitched voice. He made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, and he performed in the documentary &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot;. In 2000, his song &quot;Unstoppable&quot; was featured exclusively in the video game &quot;NBA Live 2001&quot;. He performed the song &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; together with musician Dave Koz during the evening gown competition in Miss Universe 2000, in Nicosia, Cyprus.
In 2003 Jordan left Def Soul, citing artistic differences as the reason for the departure. In recent interviews, Jordan recalls issues he had with his image under Def Soul. In particular, Jordan wished to leave his image as a sex symbol behind and mature artistically. Jordan was marketed as a sex icon since his start at Def Soul, despite having been married to Kristin Hudson before even signing. Whenever he was asked about his relationship status, Jordan would simply respond that he was &quot;married to [his] music.&quot; Realizing Def Soul was committed to maintaining Jordan&#x27;s current image as their prominent R&amp;B artist, Jordan left the label to sign with Koch Records. That same year Jordan released the album &quot;Life After Def&quot; under Koch. He contributed to the album of Croatian singer Nina Badrić in the duet &quot;Ne dam te nikom&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Not Giving You to Anyone&quot;). Jordan&#x27;s last release was 2008&#x27;s &quot;Let It Rain&quot; on the Fontana Records label.

Through 2015 and 2016, Jordan appeared at the halftime shows of various sporting games, as well as on &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;, performing &quot;This Is How We Do It&quot;.

In 2019, during an appearance on the SoulBack R&amp;B Podcast, Jordan confirmed that he has recorded his first R&amp;B album in over a decade and plans to release it this year.

On May 19, 2019, Jordan sang &quot;This Is How We Do It&quot; on the finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;, with a minor portion rapped by eliminated contestant Margie Mays, due to a performance of the song by Jake Puliti from earlier in the season in the audition round, which led to one of the memorable moments of the season with Katy Perry doing the worm.

On November 19, 2019, Jordan was a guest on Tamron Hall&#x27;s talk show for her Throwback week series in which he performed &quot;This Is How We Do It&quot;. During the show, he talked about his upcoming album, &quot;The Masterpiece&quot;, which would be released on November 29.

In 2022, Jordan competed in season eight of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Panther&quot;. When Jordan was eliminated on &quot;Vegas Night&quot; alongside Jeff Dunham as &quot;Pi-Rat&quot;, Nick Cannon stated to the panel that this is the one time that they didn&#x27;t guess Montell Jordan like they did for the other contestants. In addition, Jordan also sang this show&#x27;s rendition of &quot;This Is How We Do It&quot;.

==Ministry career==
Jordan is now a born-again Christian and can be seen at Victory World Church in Atlanta, Georgia, where he lives and worships with the church team called Victory World Music. In 2010 Jordan planned to make a comeback album as his foray back into the music industry. However, during a fast at the Victory World Church, Jordan said he was told by God to quit the music industry. He decided to cancel his plans and dedicate his life to his faith.

Jordan created a music collective at the Victory World Church called &quot;Victory World Music&quot;. In early 2011, they released a Christian album featuring the song &quot;Shake Heaven&quot;, with Beckah Shae.

Montell Jordan, alongside his wife Kristin Jordan, co-founded Master Peace Church, a fully virtual ministry dedicated to nurturing spiritual growth and community engagement through online services and resources. The church&#x27;s commitment extends to preserving marriages and providing worldwide access to its teachings through digital platforms. Their virtual services were held every Sunday from 2022 to 2024 and offered a range of programs to address spiritual needs and foster deep, meaningful relationships among its congregation. The Jordans are now focusing on their other ministry with Marriage Masterpeace and the Retreat Center, further emphasizing their dedication to strengthening family bonds and supporting marriages through spiritual guidance. 

==Personal life==
Jordan married his wife, Kristin, in 1994. They have five children and 4 grandchildren. Montell and Kristin co-authored their first book in 2017: &quot;This Is How We Do It! Making Your Marriage A Masterpeace&quot;.

In 2023, Jordan appeared on the reality TV series &quot;Special Forces: World&#x27;s Toughest Test&quot;. He was eliminated in the second episode due to a medical issue.

<doc id="953257" wikidata="Q119195" url="?curid=953257" title="Diving bell spider">
<text>The diving bell spider or water spider (Argyroneta aquatica) is the only species of spider known to live almost entirely under water. It is the only member of the genus Argyroneta. When out of the water, the spider ranges in colour from mid to dark brown, although the hairs on the abdomen give it a dark grey, velvet-like appearance. It is native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia.

==Uniqueness of aquatic behavior==
&quot;A. aquatica&quot; is the only known species of spider that spends almost all its life underwater, including resting, catching and eating prey, mating, egg laying, and overwintering. It only briefly surfaces to replenish its oxygen supply and occasionally will bring prey to the surface.

Several other spiders are semiaquatic, either periodically living underwater or willing to dive. For example, certain &quot;Desis&quot; species spend the high tide in an air-filled underwater retreat made from silk and forage on land in the intertidal zone during low tide. Some spiders living in periodically flooded habitats can survive for an extended period underwater by entering a coma-like state, up to 16–36 hours in &quot;Arctosa fulvolineata&quot;. Numerous species, including some &quot;Ancylometes&quot;, &quot;Dolomedes&quot;, &quot;Megadolomedes&quot;, &quot;Pardosa&quot;, &quot;Pirata&quot;, &quot;Thalassius&quot; and others, live above water at the surface, but may actively submerge for a prolonged period, are strong swimmers and will catch underwater prey. Several of these, as well as a few others, may dive into the water to avoid larger predators.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;A. aquatica&quot; is found in clean freshwater habitats with aquatic vegetation, such as lakes, ponds, canals, marshes and slow-moving streams. It ranges through much of mainland Europe (no records from Portugal, Greece and Albania), the British Isles and central to northern Asia ranging as far south as Iran and as far north as Siberia, up to latitude 62°N. Most of the range is inhabited by the nominate subspecies, but Japan has its own subspecies, the very similar &quot;A. a. japonica&quot;.

South Korea has a protected area, &quot;Yeoncheon Eundaeri water spider habitat&quot;, for this endangered species in that country.

==Ecology==
As with other spiders it breathes air; when submerged in water, an air bubble is trapped by a dense layer of hydrophobic hairs on its abdomen and legs, giving the abdomen a silvery appearance. The spider lives for about two years in captivity.

&quot;A. aquatica&quot; is able to remain submerged for prolonged periods of time due to the silk-based structure it constructs in order to retain an oxygen supply, named after the diving bell structure it resembles. The species range in size, although the size of females may be limited as they put more energy into building and maintaining their larger bells. Males are more active and on average almost 30% larger than females, measuring in head-and-body length compared to . This size differential favoring males is unusual for spiders, where sexual dimorphism is usually in favour of larger females. Theories suggest that the male&#x27;s more active hunting style requires greater strength to overcome water resistance and counteract the buoyancy of their mobile air supplies. This larger body size is also associated with longer front legs, shown to affect diving ability and giving the males superiority in diving over the more sessile females. In addition, females build larger air bells than males, as the bell is also used to care for the offspring, forcing them to collect air from the surface much more frequently. And the larger the body, the more air is trapped on their abdomen, which means more buoyancy to overcome. Larger females therefore have higher energy costs than males of the same size and smaller females, which could limit the number of offspring they are able to produce.

The spiders prey on aquatic insects and crustaceans such as mosquito larvae and &quot;Daphnia&quot;. The spiders themselves fall prey to frogs and fish.

==Diving bell==
The appearance of the diving bell gave rise to the genus name &quot;Argyroneta&quot;, from the Greek &quot;argyros&quot; (ἄργυρος), meaning &quot;silver&quot;, and &quot;neta&quot;, a neologism (perhaps for *νητής) derived from the verb &quot;neo&quot; (νέω) &quot;spin&quot;, intended to mean &quot;spinner of silver&quot;. Both sexes build diving bell webs which are used for digesting prey, although only the female&#x27;s larger bell is used for mating and raising offspring. Females spend most of their time within their bells, darting out to catch prey animals that touch the bell or the silk threads that anchor it and occasionally surfacing to replenish the air within the web. The bells built by males are typically smaller than females&#x27; and are replenished less often. It is thought that prior to mating, the male constructs a diving bell adjacent to the female&#x27;s then spins a tunnel from his bell, breaking into hers to gain entrance. Mating takes place in the female&#x27;s bell. The female spider then constructs an egg sac within her bell, laying between 30 and 70 eggs. Where this species moults is less clear, with some sources stating that it occurs below water in the diving bell and others that it occurs out of water.

Diving bells are irregularly constructed sheets of silk and an unknown protein-based hydrogel which is spun between submerged water plants then inflated with air brought down from the surface by the builder. Studies have considered gas diffusion between the diving bell and the spiders&#x27; aquatic environment. The silk is waterproof but allows gas exchange with the surrounding water. There is net diffusion of oxygen into the bell and net diffusion of carbon dioxide out. This process is driven by differences in partial pressure. The production of carbon dioxide and use of oxygen by the spider maintains the concentration gradient, required for diffusion. However, there is net diffusion of nitrogen out of the bell, resulting in a gradually shrinking air bubble which must be regularly replenished by the spider.

Larger spiders are able to produce larger bubbles which have a consequently higher oxygen conductance, but all spiders of this species are able to enlarge their bells in response to increased oxygen demands in low aquatic P(O2) environments. These spiders voluntarily tolerate internal conditions of low oxygen, enlarging their bells with air when the P(O2) drops below 1 kPa; this replenishment process may not need to occur for several days, in some cases. This system has been referred to as &quot;the water spider&#x27;s aqua-lung of air bubbles&quot;, though an aqua-lung lacks gas exchange with the surroundings; this system is more properly regarded as an inorganic form of gill.

==Bite==
Their bite is often described as being very painful to humans and as causing localised inflammation, vomiting, and slight feverishness that disappears after 5–10 days. However, solid evidence is lacking, with information being based on old and unverified reports because recent confirmed and published reports are lacking, leading some sources to refer to its bite as reputedly painful.

<text>The Bridge is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher, first printed in March 1930.

It depicts a bridge connecting two sheer cliffs. On the top of the left hand cliff is a city. The chasm between the two cliffs is narrow but plummets out of view. In the distance is another outcrop with a city built on top. Both the rock and the architecture on this third outcrop are darker in colouration than in the foreground. The buildings appear to be modelled partly after southern Italian architecture. The rock is in blocky formations that appeared often during Escher&#x27;s Italian period and it is possible that the village seen is Assisi.

<text>Opuwo was a constituency in the Kunene Region of Namibia. Its population in 2010 was 20,119, and its administrative capital was Opuwo. 

Opuwo Constituency was dissolved in August 2013, in preparation for the 2014 general election. Following a recommendation of the &quot;Fourth Delimitation Commission of Namibia&quot; the new constituencies Opuwo Urban (comprising the townlands and immediate surroundings of Opuwo), and Opuwo Rural (comprising the remainder of Opuwo Constituency) were created.

==Politics==
Opuwo Constituency had had considerable opposition support since Independence of Namibia. In the first regional elections in 1992 for the National Assembly of Namibia, Edward Uapundua Mumbuu of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) won and became the inaugural councillor of the constituency. He received 3,523 votes, well ahead of Erasmus Nganjone of SWAPO who received 1,553 votes. The SWANU candidate came third with 106 votes.

The 2004 regional election was won by Nghohauvi Kavetu of the DTA with 2,750 of the 5,996 votes cast.

<doc id="953263" wikidata="Q2963501" url="?curid=953263" title="Dogs Playing Poker">
<text>Dogs Playing Poker, by Cassius Marcellus Coolidge, refers collectively to an 1894 painting, a 1903 series of sixteen oil paintings commissioned by Brown &amp; Bigelow to advertise cigars, and a 1910 painting. All eighteen paintings in the overall series feature anthropomorphized dogs, but the eleven in which dogs are seated around a card table have become well known in the United States as examples of kitsch art in home decoration.

Depictions and reenactments of the series have appeared in many films, television shows, theater productions, and other popular culture art forms. Critic Annette Ferrara has described &quot;Dogs Playing Poker&quot; as &quot;indelibly burned into ... the American collective-schlock subconscious ... through incessant reproduction on all manner of pop ephemera&quot;.

The first painting, Coolidge&#x27;s 1894 &quot;Poker Game&quot;, sold for $658,000 at a 2015 auction.

==Description==
The majority of the paintings ascribed to the &quot;Dogs Playing Poker&quot; moniker consist of anthropomorphized versions of dogs sitting around a poker table playing poker. The dogs presented are usually larger breeds like collies, Great Danes, St. Bernards, and general mastiffs. Humans do not appear in any of the paintings, and female dogs rarely appear. According to James McManus of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the dogs are depicted as &quot;upper-middle-class lawyers and businessmen&quot;, as they drink and smoke at the table. The dogs sit on leather chairs in dimly lit rooms, adorned by a ceiling lamp. Some of the paintings tell a story. For example, in the painting &quot;A Bold Bluff&quot;, a St. Bernard is holding a pair of deuces, and the other dogs are questioning whether to call his bluff. In the painting &quot;Waterloo&quot;, the same dogs did not call the St. Bernard&#x27;s bluff, and he uses both paws to grab his winnings. Another painting in the series, titled &quot;A Friend in Need&quot;, depicts a bulldog slipping an ace under the table to the dog sitting next to him. Common themes throughout the &quot;Dogs Playing Poker&quot; series are deception, mistrust, and confrontation.

Not every painting within the series depicts dogs playing poker. Some paintings depict dogs performing other human activities, such as playing baseball and football. In the painting &quot;Riding a Goat&quot;, a blindfolded dog sits atop a goat for the amusement of a royal couple.

== Coolidge paintings ==


The title of Coolidge&#x27;s original 1894 painting is &quot;Poker Game&quot;.

The titles in the Brown &amp; Bigelow series are:

* &quot;A Bachelor&#x27;s Dog&quot; – reading the mail
* &quot;A Bold Bluff&quot;  – poker (originally titled &quot;Judge St. Bernard Stands Pat on Nothing&quot;)
* &quot;Breach of Promise Suit&quot; – testifying in court
* &quot;A Friend in Need&quot; (1903) – poker, cheating
* &quot;Pinched with Four Aces&quot; (1903) – poker
* &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve in Dogville&quot; – ballroom dancing
* &quot;One to Tie Two to Win&quot; – baseball
* &quot;Pinched with Four Aces&quot; – poker, illegal gambling
* &quot;Poker Sympathy&quot; (1903) – poker
* &quot;Post Mortem&quot; – poker, camaraderie
* &quot;The Reunion&quot; – smoking and drinking, camaraderie
* &quot;Riding the Goat&quot; – Masonic initiation
* &quot;Sitting up with a Sick Friend&quot; (1905) – poker, gender relations
* &quot;Stranger in Camp&quot; – poker, camping
* &quot;Ten Miles to a Garage&quot; – travel, car trouble, teamwork
* &quot;A Waterloo&quot; (1906) – poker (originally titled &quot;Judge St. Bernard Wins on a Bluff&quot;)

These were followed in 1910 by a similar painting, &quot;Looks Like Four of a Kind&quot;. Other Coolidge paintings featuring anthropomorphized dogs include &quot;Kelly Pool&quot;, which shows dogs playing kelly pool.

Some of the compositions in the series are modeled on paintings of human card-players by such artists as Caravaggio, Georges de La Tour, and Paul Cézanne.

On February 15, 2005, the originals of &quot;A Bold Bluff&quot; and &quot;Waterloo&quot; were auctioned as a pair to an undisclosed buyer for US $590,400. The previous top price for a Coolidge was $74,000. In 2015, &quot;Poker Game&quot; sold for $658,000, currently the highest price paid for a Coolidge.

==In literature and the arts==
The paintings remained fairly well-known into the 21st century, with various passing references in a number of works.

The animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has made several references to the paintings, such as in &quot;Treehouse of Horror IV&quot; (1993) when Homer is driven to screaming insanity simply by looking at the surrealness of the painting. The TV sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; used the paintings as a plot point in one episode. Passing references or short scenes involving the paintings occur in the 1998 season four episode &quot;Sinking Ship&quot; of the TV series &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, in an episode of &quot;White Collar&quot;, In the 2005 &quot;Suite Life of Zack and Cody&quot; episode &quot;Hotel Inspector&quot;, in the 2006 &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Saving Private Brian&quot;, and the episode &quot;Road to Rhode Island&quot;, in an episode of &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;, in an episode of the TV series &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, in the 1994 &quot;School Daze&quot; episode of &quot;Living Single&quot;, in a 2000 episode of the TV series &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, &quot;Hunting&quot;, and in the 2020 &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; season seven episode &quot;Passport and a Gun&quot;. In an episode of &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, a young Pablo Picasso&#x27;s artistic frustration is demonstrated by his producing a &quot;Dogs Playing Poker&quot; painting. &quot;Dogs Playing Poker&quot; TV ads were aired during &quot;ESPN Sunday Night Football&quot; during the 1998 and 1999 NFL seasons.

In the 1999 film &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, Banning believes she finds a stolen Claude Monet painting in Crown&#x27;s house. On expert examination it turns out to be a fake painted over a copy of &quot;Poker Sympathy&quot;, a &quot;Dogs Playing Poker&quot; canvas. In the 2016 film, &quot;The Accountant&quot;, the paintings are discussed by the lead characters. Later, a copy of &quot;A Friend in Need&quot; is used as a cover to hide a Jackson Pollock painting. Glimpses, passing mentions, or short scenes involving the paintings are in the 2009 film &quot;Up&quot;, the 2006 film &quot;Barnyard&quot;, and in the 2022 film &quot;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish&quot;. 

In the 1984 play &quot;The Foreigner&quot;, a character complains that she doesn&#x27;t want to be in her motel room because there is a &quot;Damn picture on the wall of some dogs playin&#x27; poker.&quot;

The cover of the 1981 album, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; by Rush, features &quot;A Friend in Need&quot; as one of the three pictures being moved. The music video for Snoop Dogg&#x27;s 1993 song, &quot;What&#x27;s My Name&quot;, depicts dogs playing craps while smoking cigars and wearing sunglasses.

In 2022 the gambling company Bodog made a series of Poker Masterclasses called Pokerdogs.

<text>USS &quot;James Madison&quot; (SSBN-627), the lead ship of her class of ballistic missile submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Founding Father James Madison (1751–1836), the fourth President of the United States (1809–1817).

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;James Madison&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 20 July 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 5 March 1962. She was launched on 15 March 1963, sponsored by Mrs. Mary Ellen (Mellon) Monroney, wife of Oklahoma Senator A.S. &quot;Mike&quot; Monroney, and commissioned on 28 July 1964. She was launched with sixteen Polaris A-3 ballistic missiles.

==Operational history==
After post-shakedown repairs and modification in November and December 1964, &quot;James Madison&quot; departed on her first deterrent patrol on 17 January 1965. By the end of 1966, she had completed her 10th deterrent patrol, serving in the European area.

In November 1974 she was involved in a collision with a Soviet . The incident occurred when the &quot;James Madison&quot; was departing Holy Loch in Argyll, Scotland, to take up station and collided with a Soviet submarine waiting outside the port to trail it. Eric Graham, a marine historian from the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland it could have been a diplomatic incident but because it was so deep into the UK home water it was an &quot;embarrassment&quot; that they wanted to keep quiet.

During her first major overhaul, like the rest of her class, &quot;Madison&quot; was retrofitted with Poseidon C-3 missiles and their associated Mark 88 firecontrol system. Poseidon was replaced by Trident C-4 missiles during a comprehensive overhaul that took place at the Newport News (VA) Shipyard in the early 1980s.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
The inactivation of &quot;James Madison&quot; at Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, began on 18 February 1992. She was decommissioned on 20 November 1992 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register the same day, and her inactivation at Mare Island was completed on 8 December 1992. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 24 October 1997.

<text>USS &quot;Tecumseh&quot; (SSBN-628), a ballistic missile submarine, was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for Tecumseh (c.1768–1813), the leader of the Shawnee people.

==Construction and commissioning==

The contract to build &quot;Tecumseh&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 20 July 1961. Originally, she was to have been named &quot;William Penn&quot;, and would have been the first Navy ship to bear that name, but was renamed on 11 April 1962.

&quot;Tecumseh&quot;″s keel was laid down on 1 June 1962. She was launched on 22 June 1963 sponsored by Mrs. Mildred Inez (Tyner) Sikes, wife of Florida Congressman Robert L. F. Sikes, and commissioned on 29 May 1964, with Commander Arnett B. Taylor in command of the Blue Crew and Commander Charles S. Carlisle in command of the Gold Crew.

==Service history==

Based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, &quot;Tecumseh&quot; deployed to the Mariana Islands on 17 December 1964, arriving at Guam on 29 December 1964 to commence deterrent patrols.

&quot;Tecumseh&quot; had conducted 21 strategic deterrent patrols in the Pacific by 1969, when she transferred to the United States Atlantic Fleet. She proceeded via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal to the United States East Coast and arrived at Newport News, Virginia, on 8 November 1969. Soon thereafter, she entered Newport News shipyard for a conversion which replaced her Polaris ballistic missile system with the new Poseidon ballistic missile system. Emerging from dry dock on 9 May 1970, &quot;Tecumseh&quot; underwent a thorough overhaul through that fall and winter before being assigned a new home port of Charleston, South Carolina, on 18 February 1971.

&quot;Tecumseh&quot; conducted sea trials and shakedown out of Charleston before conducting two deterrent patrols in late 1971. Subsequently deployed to Holy Loch, Scotland, &quot;Tecumseh&quot; arrived in Scottish waters on 9 February 1972. She conducted 18 more deterrent patrols out of Holy Loch through 1976.

&quot;Tecumseh&quot; was homeported in Charleston, South Carolina, at least from March 1982 until entering Newport News shipyard for a refueling overhaul in 1983. After completion of this overhaul in Spring of 1987 she successfully completed sea trials, shakedown, and a successful missile launch and returned to her home port of Charleston, South Carolina,

From 1987 to 1992 Tecumseh was homeported in Charleston SC, making patrols from both Charleston and Holy Loch Scotland. In 1992, Tecumseh off-loaded its missiles and participated in war games out of Charleston for training of attack boats and other Anti-Submarine warfare vessels or planes. In January 1993, Tecumseh transited the Panama Canal, and subsequently ported in Bremerton, WA for decommissioning.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

&quot;Tecumseh&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 23 July 1993. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 1 April 1994.

==Memorials==

&quot;Tecumseh&quot;″s port torpedo tubes and a large piece of pressure hull were preserved and are now on display at the Naval Undersea Museum at Keyport, Washington.

<text>USS &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; (SSBN-629), a ballistic missile submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Daniel Boone (1734–1820), the pioneer and frontiersman.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, on 21 July 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 6 February 1962. She was launched on 22 June 1963 sponsored by Mrs. Margaret Smith Wakelin, wife of Dr. James H. Wakelin, Jr., a physicist who was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research and Development) from 1959 until 1964. &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; was commissioned on 23 April 1964, with Commander George P. Steele, III, in command of the Blue Crew and Lieutenant Commander Alan B. Crabtree in command of the Gold Crew. Following her commissioning, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 15, becoming the first ballistic missile submarine assigned to the Pacific Fleet.

==Operational history==
During her first major overhaul , like the rest of her class, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; was retrofitted with Poseidon C-3 missiles and the associated Mark 88 firecontrol system. Poseidon was replaced by Trident C-4 missiles and on 6 September 1980, &quot;Boone&quot; became the first &quot;James Madison&quot; operational with the new missile.

&quot;Daniel Boone&quot; entered the Tenneco Shipyard at Newport News, Virginia sometime in late 1985 or early 1986 for refit. During post-refit sea trials on 7 April 1987 she ran aground in the James River at Newport News. This grounding occurred primarily because the OOD (Officer of the Deck), in an attempt to counteract tidal currents, lowered the SPM (Secondary Propulsion Motor) which was quickly and violently snapped off on a sandbar. The OOD then ordered the SPM retracted which, when retracted would have opened up an unpluggable 6&quot; diameter hole in the hull. This potentially catastrophic mistake was countermanded by watchstanders on the scene in the Machinery space. In spite direct orders from the CONN and Maneuvering, the senior watchstander on the scene prevented the SPM from being retracted, preventing the submarine from sinking in the James River. This accident, however, significantly delayed her departure from the refit yards because they had to obtain another SPM and repair the hull penetration in Tenneco Shipyard&#x27;s dry dock. No ballistic missiles were on board.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Daniel Boone&quot; was decommissioned on 18 February 1994 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 4 November 1994.

<text>USS &quot;Ulysses S. Grant&quot; (SSBN-631), a fleet ballistic missile submarine, was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Ulysses S. Grant (1822–1885), American Civil War general and the 18th President of the United States (1869–1877).

==Construction and commissioning==

The contract to build &quot;Ulysses S. Grant&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 20 July 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 18 August 1962. She was launched on 2 November 1963, sponsored by President Grant&#x27;s great-granddaughter Edith (Grant) Griffiths, wife of Colonel David W. Griffiths (retired), and commissioned on 17 July 1964 with Captain J. L. From Jr., in command of the Blue Crew. In September, Commander C.A.K. McDonald took command of the Gold Crew.

==Service history==

Following shakedown, the &quot;Ulysses S. Grant&quot; got underway from Groton in early December 1964, bound for the Pacific Ocean. Transiting the Panama Canal on 31 December 1964, she arrived at Pearl Harbor in January 1965. She was deployed to Guam, in the Mariana Islands, and conducted 18 deterrent patrols operating from there equipped with Polaris ballistic missiles before returning to the United States in 1969. After an and conversion to carry Poseidon ballistic missiles at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, &quot;Ulysses S. Grant&quot; was deployed to Holy Loch in Scotland in 1970, and operated in the European area until September 1977.

In the late 1970s, &quot;Ulysses S. Grant&quot; underwent a refueling overhaul at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, in Kittery, Maine. After the overhaul period, the Blue Crew, under Commander W.G. Ellis, completed what was called &quot;The best DASO (Demonstration and Shakedown Operation) in 10 years,&quot; which concluded with the firing of a test missile on 31 July 1980. &quot;Ulysses S. Grant&quot; then returned to Charleston, South Carolina, where, subsequent to normal change if command, the Gold Crew, under the command of Commander Michael P. McBride, took &quot;Ulysses S. Grant&quot; through a non-firing second-half DASO. During that period, the Gold Crew enjoyed a luxury for a &quot;boomer&quot; crew, a swim call in the Caribbean. USS Ulysses S. Grant continued to operate out of Holy Loch, Scotland, for several more years, until 1984 or later.

On 7 April 1987, two crewmen of &quot;Ulysses S. Grant&quot; were swept off the submarine&#x27;s missile deck during heavy seas 3 miles off Portsmouth, New Hampshire. One man, Lt. David Jimenez of Groton, Connecticut, was rescued but was pronounced dead soon afterwards. The second man, Chief Torpedoman&#x27;s Mate Larry Thompson of Concord, California, remained &quot;lost at sea&quot;.

In 1989, after the Blue Crew turned &quot;Ulysses S. Grant&quot; over to the Gold Crew while she was moored alongside the submarine tender , the Gold Crew took the submarine to Holy Loch, and &quot;Ulysses S. Grant&quot; operated on deterrent patrols out of Holy Loch for the remainder of her career.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

&quot;Ulysses S. Grant&quot; was decommissioned on 12 June 1992 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton was completed on 23 October 1993.

==Commemoration==
&quot;Ulysses S. Grant&quot;″s ship&#x27;s bell is stored at the submarine base at Bremerton, where it has been used in retirement ceremonies.

<text>USS &quot;Casimir Pulaski&quot; (SSBN-633), a ballistic missile submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Casimir Pulaski (1745–1779), a Polish general who served in the American Revolutionary War.

==Construction and commissioning==

The contract to build &quot;Casimir Pulaski&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division (EB) of the General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 20 July 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 12 January 1963. She was launched on 1 February 1964, sponsored by Mary Louise (Metz) Gronouski, wife of United States Postmaster General and first Polish-American cabinet officer John A. Gronouski Jr., and commissioned on 14 August 1964, with Captain Robert L. J. Long in command of the Blue Crew and Commander Thomas B. Brittain Jr. in command of the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
&quot;Casimir Pulaski&#x27;s&quot; first dive was on 28 June 1964. After she was commissioned on 14 August 1964, &quot;Casimir Pulaski&quot; stood out of Electric Boat for a three-month shakedown cruise with both crews to the waters off Cape Kennedy where she test-fired multiple UGM-27 Polaris ballistic missiles. Blue Crew&#x27;s first missile firing was on 31 October and Gold Crew&#x27;s was on 13 November 1964. She completed her shakedown on 5 December 1964, and proceeded back to Groton.

From Groton, the boat went to the Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic at Naval Weapons Station Charleston, South Carolina for her final weapons load out. Assigned to Submarine Squadron (Subron) 16, she proceeded to Naval Station Rota, Spain, in March 1965. The &quot;Pulaski&#x27;s&quot; Blue Crew set sail on the boat&#x27;s first deterrent patrol on 13 April 1965.

After completing 20 deterrent patrols, Casimir Pulaski returned to EB in Groton, Connecticut on 5 January 1970 for refueling and overhaul where the S5W reactor was replaced with an S3G core 3 and the boat became the seventh SSBN refitted to carry UGM-73 Poseidon ballistic missiles. After the overhaul, she was reassigned to Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 14 and departed for Holy Loch, Scotland on 30 April 1971.

In June 1971, while in Holy Loch, &quot;Casimir Pulaski&quot; was the first boat to have the Integrated Data Acquisition System (IDAS) M-35 set installed. On 2 July, the Blue Crew successfully completed the Pulaski&#x27;s first Poseidon missile launch during her Demonstration and Shakedown Operations (DASO) — testing of missile systems that allowed the collection of flight data and examinations of submarine launch platforms. The Gold Crew followed up with a launch on 16 August. With DASO complete, &quot;Pulaski&quot; returned to the fleet, beginning her next operational patrol on 28 October 1971.

During her sixth operational test, &quot;Pulaski&#x27;s&quot; Gold Crew launched four Poseidon missiles on 2 March 1973.

In July 1974, SubRon 14 bestowed &quot;Pulaski&quot; with the Battle Efficiency (Battle &quot;E&quot;) Award, the first ever for any ballistic missile boat. Later that year, she completed her 50th strategic deterrent patrol.

Late in 1980, &quot;Pulaski&quot; entered Newport News Shipyard for refueling and overhaul where she was modified for the UGM-96 Trident I ballistic missile. Reassigned to Submarine Squadron (Subron) 16, following overhaul and refueling, she proceeded to her new homeport at Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay, GA, arriving on 10 December 1982. During the post-overhaul DASO, on 19 April 1983, the Gold Crew successfully launched a Trident I ballistic missile and had a Trident missile flight terminated on a malfunction after launch. Returning to fleet operations, SSBN-633 began her next deterrent patrol on 3 June.

On 17 June 1985, &quot;Casimir Pulaski&quot; successfully test fired four Trident I missiles in the Atlantic Test Range Range off Cape Canaveral, Florida.

In October 1985, &quot;Casimir Pulaski&quot; Gold Crew won the Arleigh Burke Fleet trophy for most improvement in combat efficiency of any Navy unit in the US Atlantic Fleet during Fiscal Year 1985, under the Command of Commander Conrad A. Plyler, Jr, USN. The ship went on to win the fiscal year 1986 Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; for Submarine Squadron Sixteen and the Fleet Ballistic Submarine Superior Performance Award Trophy (Providence Plantation Trophy) for the US Atlantic Fleet under the command of Commander Plyler (Gold Crew) and Commander William W. Schmidt (Blue Crew). The ship also received the Navy Unit Meritorious Commendation ribbon for her service from 1 January 1985 to 2 October 1986. During this period, the ship participated in a successful Atlantic Fleet Follow-on Operational Test on the Atlantic Test Range, evaluating the readiness of the Trident C-4 missile.

From 1 April to 20 May 1989, &quot;Casimir Pulaski&quot; participated in Concept of Operation Exercise LANTCOOPEX 1-89, held at a remote site—Port Canaveral—away from an SSBN refit port, arriving there after the end of Gold Crew deterrent patrol. After being relieved by the Blue Crew, both crews—with tender personnel—conducted a complete resupply of the ship and performed major maintenance and repairs and a torpedo reload with no submarine tender present, just a refit barge, under conditions of round-the-clock special forces simulated attacks. After LANTCOOPEX 1-89, both crews received a Letter of Commendation from Secretary of the Navy Henry L. Garrett III. In the fall of 1989, SubRon 16 awarded &quot;Pulaski&quot; with the Battle Efficiency (Battle &quot;E&quot;) Award. In November, the Blue Crew sailors were awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for their actions in response to Hurricane Hugo which caused widespread damage in the Caribbean and the southeast United States.

In May 1993, &quot;Pulaski&quot; completed her 88th and final deterrent patrol. The two crews were combined and SSBN-633 was transferred to the Pacific Fleet for inactivation and decommissioning.

&quot;USS Casimir Pulaski&#x27;s&quot; 88 Strategic Deterrent Patrols were the most of any of the original &quot;41 For Freedom&quot; missile submarine fleet.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
After her final cruise under Commander Kenneth W. Wrona, &quot;Casimir Pulaski&quot; was decommissioned on 7 March 1994 and simultaneously stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington was completed on 21 October 1994.

<text>USS &quot;Von Steuben&quot; (SSBN-632), a fleet ballistic missile submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben (1730–1794), a Prussian army officer who served in the American Revolutionary War.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Von Steuben&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 20 July 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 4 September 1962. She was launched on 18 October 1963, sponsored by Vera (Connell) Korth, wife of Fred Korth, Secretary of the Navy, and commissioned on 30 September 1964, with Commander John P. Wise in command of the Blue Crew and Commander Jeffrey C. Metzel in command of the Gold Crew.

During the autumn of 1964, the &quot;Von Steuben&quot; completed two shakedown cruises — one for each crew — and a period of antisubmarine warfare training between the two cruises. On 22 December 1964, her Gold Crew fired her first Polaris ballistic missile on the Atlantic Missile Range before returning to Newport News for Christmas. She changed crews again at the beginning of 1965, and returned to the missile range off Cape Canaveral, Florida, where the Blue Crew fired its first Polaris missile. In February 1965, after completing all initial training operations, she returned to Newport News.

In March 1965, &quot;Von Steuben&quot; headed for her first duty assignment. She joined Submarine Squadron 18 at Charleston, South Carolina, her new base of operations, and immediately began conducting strategic deterrent patrols.

At the end of her 11th deterrent patrol early in 1968, &quot;Von Steuben&quot; was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 16 and operated out of Rota, Spain, until the middle of 1969.

===Sealady incident===
On August 9, 1968, while operating submerged about 40 miles (64 kilometers) off the southern coast of Spain, &quot;Von Steuben&quot; was struck by a submerged tow cable connecting a tug and a merchant tanker called &quot;Sealady&quot; (&quot;Sealady&quot; was a liberty ship previously named &quot;Bengt H. Larson&quot; (1959) and before that was named (1954)). Due to the merchant being under tow at the time of the collision, the ship had no engine noise for the submarine to detect its presence. When it became apparent the submarine had lost depth control and steering, but not knowing why, the submarine conducted an emergency main ballast tank blow, which resulted in the collision of the submarine and the towed ship. The submarine suffered external damage to the sail and superstructure. After local repairs at the submarine squadron facilities in Rota, she reported to Groton, Connecticut, for more detailed repairs at the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation, after which she resumed deterrent patrols out of Rota.
This incident was revisited, when , on 9 February 2001, also conducted an emergency main ballast tank blow off the coast of Oahu while hosting several civilians. &quot;Greeneville&quot; struck the Japanese fishery high school training ship &quot;Ehime Maru&quot; (), causing the fishing boat to sink in less than ten minutes with the death of nine crew members, including four high school students. &quot;Von Steuben&quot; had conducted an emergency main ballast tank blow due to its planes tangled in the submerged towline of the tug, jamming them so that the sub threatened to sink. &quot;Greenville&quot; blew her main ballast tanks merely to demonstrate a maneuver and not to escape from danger. Her captain consciously surrendered control of the vessel. The captain of &quot;Von Steuben&quot; had acted properly in ordering the emergency blow. He had lost control of his ship, his stern planes were jammed, and the possibility of an irreversible plunge to the bottom of the ocean was very real. However, &quot;Greenville&quot;″s captain had to face a court of inquiry and possibly a full court-martial, until his request to retire was approved.
==Upgraded ballistic missile system==
 In November 1970, &quot;Von Steuben&quot; visited Groton once again, this time near the end of a 16-month during which she was modified to carry the newly developed Poseidon C-3 ballistic missile, which boasted major advances in warhead technology and accuracy and systematically was replacing the older Polaris missiles in the , &quot;James Madison&quot; and s. &quot;Von Steuben&quot; conducted post-conversion shakedown during the early months of 1971 and, while escorted by the destroyer for range security, conducted a two-missile Demonstration and Shakedown Operation (DASO) in which she fired her first and second Poseidon missiles in February and March 1971, respectively.
In May 1971, she returned to Charleston and resumed strategic deterrent patrols carrying the newer Poseidon missiles. She conducted an Extended Refit Period at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard between March 1978 and May 1978.

&quot;Von Steuben&quot;″s ballistic missile system was upgraded a second time in the early 1980s to use Trident I (C4) ballistic missiles. These missiles were also retrofitted to 11 other SSBNs of the &quot;James Madison&quot; and &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; classes, replacing their Poseidon missiles, and also were the first missiles carried by the early s. Trident missiles were three-stage missiles that provided for increased range along with advances in inertial guidance systems. &quot;Von Steuben&quot; continued making strategic deterrent patrols into the early 1990s with the Trident I missile.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Von Steuben&quot; was decommissioned on 26 February 1994 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register simultaneously. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington, began on 1 October 2000 and was completed on 30 October 2001. &quot;Von Steuben&quot;″s age from delivery to disposal was 37.2 years.

<text>USS &quot;Sam Rayburn&quot; (SSBN-635) was a fleet ballistic missile submarine named for Sam Rayburn (1882–1961), Speaker of the United States House of Representatives (1940–1947, 1949–1953, and 1955–1961). &quot;Sam Rayburn&quot; was in commission 2 December 1964 to 31 July 1989 carrying the Polaris missile and later the Poseidon missile. Following decommissioning, ex-&quot;Sam Rayburn&quot; was converted into a moored training ship for use at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Unit at Goose Creek, South Carolina.

== Construction and commissioning ==
The contract to build &quot;Sam Rayburn&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 20 July 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 3 December 1962. She was launched on 20 December 1963, sponsored by Mrs. S. E. Bartley and Mrs. W. A. Thomas, and commissioned on 2 December 1964, with Captain Oliver H. Perry, Jr., in command of the Blue Crew and Commander William A. Williams III in command of the Gold Crew.

== Service history ==

&quot;Sam Rayburn&quot; conducted demonstration and shakedown operations on the Atlantic Missile Range, first operated by her Blue Crew and then by her Gold Crew. She joined Submarine Squadron 18 at Charleston, South Carolina, before her first Polaris ballistic missile deterrent patrol in the summer of 1965. In August 1965, she joined Submarine Squadron 16 and made seven deterrent patrols out of Rota, Spain, before rejoining Submarine Squadron 18 at Charleston in December 1966. During 1967, &quot;Sam Rayburn&quot; completed her 8th through 11th deterrent patrols. During 1968, she completed her 12th through 14th deterrent patrols.

During 1969, &quot;Sam Rayburn&quot; operated continuously with Submarine Squadron 18 until commencing at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, in December 1969. Upon completion of overhaul on 27 May 1971, she operated along the United States East Coast for the remainder of 1971 and into 1972.

In 1972, &quot;Sam Rayburn&quot; departed Groton, Connecticut, and arrived at Charleston before departing Charleston on an extended period of special operations. In June 1974, she remained engaged in those special operations.

== Deactivation, decommissioning, and disposal ==
 On 10 June 1985, the U.S. Navy announced plans to dismantle a fleet ballistic missile submarine so as to remain within the SALT II strategic arms limitation treaty ceiling on MIRVed ballistic missiles. &quot;Sam Rayburn&quot; was selected and was deactivated on 16 September 1985, with missile tubes filled with concrete and tube hatches removed. Her missile compartment was later dismantled and the two halves (bow and stern) of the ship were pulled together and welded in place for use as a training ship.

&quot;Sam Rayburn&quot; was decommissioned on 31 July 1989 and reclassified a moored training ship (MTS) with hull number MTS-635. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 July 1989, she arrived at the Naval Nuclear Prototype Training Unit at Goose Creek, South Carolina, in August 1989 after achieving initial criticality in her new role on 29 July 1989. Her modifications included special mooring arrangements, including Water Brake, a mechanism to absorb power generated by her main propulsion shaft. She operated as a moored training ship from 1989-2021. MTS-635 departed the Naval Nuclear Power Training Unit Charleston on 1 April 2021 via a tow vessel and escort, arriving at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth Virginia on 3 April 2021 to await defueling and eventual dismantling. The Naval Nuclear Power Training Unit at Goose Creek, South Carolina will continue to train students with replacement converted training ships; the (SSN-701) and the .

<text>USS &quot;Stonewall Jackson&quot; (SSBN-634, active 1963–1995), a fleet ballistic missile submarine, was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Confederate States Army General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson (1824–1863).

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Stonewall Jackson&quot; was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, on 21 July 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 4 July 1962. She was launched on 30 November 1963, sponsored by Miss Julia Christian McAfee, great-granddaughter of General Jackson, and commissioned on 26 August 1964, with Commander John H. Nicholson in command of the Blue Crew and Commander Richard A. Frost in command of the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
&quot;Stonewall Jackson&quot; departed Vallejo on 3 September 1964 for her shakedown cruise to Cape Kennedy, Florida. The Blue Crew completed training with a successful Polaris ballistic missile firing on 2 December 1964 and was relieved by the Gold Crew. Following the Gold Crew&#x27;s successful Polaris missile launch on 16 December 1964, &quot;Stonewall Jackson&quot; returned to the Pacific Ocean to complete shakedown operations. She began post-shakedown alterations and repairs on 13 February 1965, then made final preparations at Bangor, Washington for an overseas deployment. In April 1965, she began her first strategic deterrent patrol.

In June 1965, the Gold Crew relieved the Blue Crew at Apra Harbor, Guam. For the next five years &quot;Stonewall Jackson&quot; conducted deterrent patrols from Apra Harbor.

In the spring of 1970, &quot;Stonewall Jackson&quot; was reassigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet. On 23 April 1970, she got underway from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to conduct a special operation, before continuing on to the Panama Canal. She transited the canal on 7 May 1970 and changed operational control from Submarine Flotilla 5 to Submarine Flotilla 6, officially joining the Atlantic Fleet. On 15 May 1970, she put into New London, Connecticut.

&quot;Stonewall Jackson&quot; spent the second half of May 1970 in upkeep at New London, then headed south on 1 June 1970. She stopped at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, from 7 June to 10 June 1970 for midshipman indoctrination tours, then put to sea for special operations. She entered Charleston, South Carolina, to off-load ballistic missiles during the first week in July 1970, then shaped a course for New London, arriving on 10 July 1970. On 15 July she entered the shipyard of the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics at Groton, Connecticut, for conversion to carry the Poseidon C-3 ballistic missile system.

The installation of the new missile system was completed by 29 October 1971, when the Blue Crew began preparations to put to sea. Between October 1971 and March 1972, both the Blue Crew and the Gold Crew conducted their shakedown cruises off the southeastern coast of the United States. &quot;Stonewall Jackson&quot; returned to Groton on 4 March 1971 and, on 8 March, commenced post-shakedown repairs and alterations at the General Dynamics shipyard.

On 7 April 1971, &quot;Stonewall Jackson&quot; got underway for Charleston for ballistic missile loading in preparation for her first post-conversion and first Atlantic deterrent patrol.

&quot;Stonewall Jackson&quot; was based at Holy Loch, Scotland, for patrol duties until mid-1978. She returned to the United States for an extensive overhaul at Portsmouth, New Hampshire Shipyard and was fitted with the Trident C-4 missile system at Pier side Port Canaveral, Florida in late 1988. 1988-1990 in Charleston, SC is where she deployed for patrols. She then operated out of Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia, until her final patrol in 1994.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Stonewall Jackson&quot; was decommissioned on 9 February 1995 and simultaneously stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 13 October 1995.

<doc id="953279" wikidata="Q2662041" url="?curid=953279" title="Skatepark of Tampa">
<text>The Skatepark of Tampa is a skatepark in Tampa, Florida, United States. It is considered one of the top skateboarding venues on the East Coast of the United States. The name is often abbreviated as &quot;SPoT&quot;, and it is well known for its annual &quot;Tampa Am&quot; and &quot;Tampa Pro&quot; competitions.

== History ==
On December 28, 1992, SPoT was opened only to employees, and on January 2, 1993 the park officially opened to the public. The first pro contest was held April 1 &amp; 2, 1995 and won by Mike Vallely.

On April 1, 2012, SPoT announced on its website that the park had been purchased (for 9.3 million) by rapper Lil Wayne. It was revealed shortly afterwards that the fake press release was an April Fool&#x27;s joke.

== Obstacles ==

The skatepark includes a terrain park-style &quot;pro course&quot;, offering a pyramid, rails and transitions. Outside, there is a concrete transition course with a pizza oven. The &quot;beginner&#x27;s course&quot; features many smaller rails and ramps to expand skateboarding skills and also includes the famous bowl.

The street skateboarding course is redesigned every year for the Tampa Pro and Tampa Am contest.

== Music venue ==
The skatepark also doubles as a popular music venue. In 2012, SPoT hosted its 20-year anniversary event with performances from Souls of Mischief and Killer Mike.

The venue also hosts the &quot;Transitions Art Gallery&quot; music venue on its premises. TAG has served as a springboard for acoustic artists and other musicians. In December 2012, the owner of the Gallery announced he was stepping down and that the venue would be under new management from January 2013. The venue&#x27;s new owners subsequently announced that the name of the venue would change to &quot;Epic Problem&quot;. &quot;Epic Problem&quot; hosts many shows from many post-hardcore bands and one annual show from the nonprofit high school (mainly from Hillsborough High School) sketch comedy troupe On The Brink.

In July 2016, Epic Problem held its last show and passed the torch to King State coffee, owned by Tim McTague, of Underoath and Nate Young, of Anberlin, who use the space for brewing.

In March 2017, the SPoT Snack Bar was expanded and reconstructed into a full-fledged music venue and renamed &quot;Transitions&quot;. It is complete with stage, lighting, sound system and newly rebuilt bar. Transitions held its first show during the 23rd Annual Tampa Pro contest that featured the music of Ray Barbee.

==Popular culture==
The skatepark is a major feature in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot; video game, and SPoT employees appear as competitors in the street and vertical contests. The skatepark also served as an exclusive competition level in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2x&quot;.

SPoT appeared on the MTV series &quot;Rob &amp; Big&quot; that featured professional skateboarder and entrepreneur Rob Dyrdek.

In August 2011, Lil Wayne stopped by SPoT for a private after hours session. He has attended every Tampa Pro contest since, often spectating from the judges&#x27; booth.

In May 2004, comedian Dave Chappelle set up an after hours session with some of his friends while on tour in Tampa.

<doc id="953281" wikidata="Q284989" url="?curid=953281" title="Tri-Ace">
<text>is a Japanese video game developer founded in 1995. They are known for their role-playing games, most notably the &quot;Star Ocean&quot; and &quot;Valkyrie Profile&quot; series.

== History ==
tri-Ace was formed in March 1995 by former Telenet Japan employees Yoshiharu Gotanda (programmer, current tri-Ace President), Masaki Norimoto (game designer) and Joe Asanuma (director). The name is a play on words regarding the &quot;three aces&quot; who formed the company. Most of tri-Ace&#x27;s games have been published by Square Enix (formerly Enix).

The company exclusively makes role-playing video games, and is known for giving their games&#x27; action-packed battle systems and deep skill systems. This trademark style began when the founders of tri-Ace originally worked for Telenet Japan&#x27;s Wolfteam, and had created &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot;. This game, published by Namco, is a precursor to tri-Ace&#x27;s own &quot;Star Ocean&quot; games in several ways; e.g., an action battle system where the player controls one character and AI controls others in the party and special battle skills that the player can assign to different buttons. Besides the &quot;Star Ocean&quot; series, they also released &quot;Valkyrie Profile&quot; in 1999.

After their long-time Square Enix liaison and producer, Yoshinori Yamagishi, announced that he was done working on the &quot;Star Ocean&quot; series in 2009, several of tri-Ace&#x27;s works started to be published by different game companies other than Square Enix. Such as their 2010 release of &quot;Resonance of Fate&quot; which was taken to Sega publishing. As well, onwards there began to be a lack of tri-Ace games that received English localizations until &quot;Exist Archive&quot; in 2016.

tri-Ace games have sold over 3.8 million copies worldwide as of September 2005. The company&#x27;s sound programmer Hiroya Hatsushiba formed tri-Crescendo in 1999 which has since developed several games independently of tri-Ace.

Japanese mobile company Nepro Japan acquired tri-Ace in February 2015. Despite being acquired by a company focusing on mobile gaming, tri-Ace continued developing video games for consoles, as evidenced by &quot;Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness&quot; in 2016 and then &quot;Star Ocean: The Divine Force&quot; in 2022, but weeks before the release for &quot;Star Ocean: The Divine Force&quot;, tri-Ace was reported to have financial issues and was insolvent.

<text>Atrani, Coast of Amalfi is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher, first printed in August 1931. Atrani is a small town and commune on the Amalfi Coast in the province of Salerno in the Campania region of south-western Italy. Atrani is the second smallest town in Italy and was built right at the edge of the sea. This image of Atrani recurs several times in Escher&#x27;s work, most notably in his series of &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; prints: &quot;Metamorphosis I&quot;, &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;.

<doc id="953286" wikidata="Q4819920" url="?curid=953286" title="Silk (group)">
<text>Silk is an American R&amp;B group, formed in 1989 in Atlanta, Georgia. They are best known for their 1993 hit single, &quot;Freak Me&quot;, which reached number-one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Career==
Silk was discovered by the musician Keith Sweat. The group was originally a quintet made up of Timothy &quot;Timzo&quot; Cameron, James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Gates, Jr., Johnathen &quot;John John&quot; Rasboro, Tyga Graham &amp; Albert “ NELLA” Allen. Gary &quot;Big G&quot; Glenn &amp; Gary &quot;Lil G&quot; Jenkins joined shortly after the departures of Graham &amp; Allen.

Silk is best known for their hit singles, &quot;Freak Me&quot;, and &quot;Happy Days&quot; from their debut album, &quot;Lose Control&quot;. Another hit from &quot;Lose Control&quot;, &quot;Girl U For Me&quot;, helped the album reach double platinum status. They later had success with singles such as &quot;I Can Go Deep&quot;, &quot;Hooked on You&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Rush&quot;, &quot;If You&quot; (released February 23, 1999) &quot;Meeting in My Bedroom&quot;, and &quot;We&#x27;re Calling You&quot;. In 1994, Silk won Album Of The Year for &quot;Lose Control&quot; at the Soul Train Music Awards.

In 2002, Silk left Elektra and took a hiatus. That same year, Jenkins went on to pursue other interests and made his stage debut as &#x27;AJ&#x27; in the Tyler Perry play &quot;Madea&#x27;s Family Reunion&quot;. He resurfaced musically in 2007 with his solo debut, &quot;The Other Side&quot;. Silk and Sweat both appeared in the group, Black Men United on the song &quot;U Will Know&quot; which is featured on soundtrack for the movie &quot;Jason&#x27;s Lyric&quot;. Silk has also appeared on the soundtracks for &quot;Booty Call&quot; (Feel Good), &quot;Made In America&quot; (Does He Do It Good w/Keith Sweat),&quot;A Low Down Dirty Shame&quot; (I Can Go Deep), and &quot;Blankman&quot; (Cry On).

In 2003 and down to a quartet, Silk released their fifth studio album &quot;Silktime&quot; on their own label Silk Music Group. The album featured the songs &quot;Silktime&quot;, &quot;My Girl&quot;, &quot;Alibi&quot;, &quot;More&quot;, &quot;You (The Baby Song)&quot;, &quot;Check My Story&quot; and a cover version of Blue Magic&#x27;s &quot;Sideshow&quot;. That song reunited them with their mentor Keith Sweat. The album appeared in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 2006, the group returned with their sixth release, a covers album entitled &quot;Always And Forever&quot; on Shanachie Records. The album featured covers of R&amp;B songs including &quot;Adore&quot; by Prince, &quot;Always and Forever&quot; by Heatwave, and &quot;Secret Garden&quot; by Quincy Jones. &quot;Secret Garden&quot; was the first and only single.

Jenkins has since rejoined Silk; their 7th album, &quot;Quiet Storm&quot;, was released on March 18, 2016 on Shanachie Records.

In 2018, Silk celebrated 25 years in the music business with two star studded concerts - one at B.B. King&#x27;s in New York in February and the other in Atlanta in March. They were also honored with an episode on the popular series &quot;Unsung&quot; that same year.

<doc id="953289" wikidata="Q1980019" url="?curid=953289" title="Life of Alexander Nevsky">
<text>The Life of Alexander Nevsky is an Old East Slavic hagiography about Alexander Nevsky, composed and edited in stages between the late 13th century and the mid-15th century. In most manuscript copies, its full title is &quot;Tale about the Life of the Brave, Blessed, and Great Prince Alexander Nevskii&quot;.

== Contents ==
The &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot; describes the life and achievements of Aleksandr Yaroslavich (1220/21–1263), a prince of Novgorod (intermittently between 1236 and 1259) and a grand prince of Vladimir (). He is presented as having defended the northwestern borders of Rus against a Swedish invasion in the legendary Battle of the Neva (July 1240, for which he was nicknamed &quot;Nevsky&quot; in the 15th century, long after the &quot;Life&quot; was written), defeated the Livonian Order at the Battle of Lake Peipus in 1242 and paid a few visits to Batu Khan to protect the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality from the Khazar raids. The work is filled with &#x27;patriotic spirit&#x27; and achieves a &#x27;high degree of artistic expressiveness&#x27; in its glorification of Alexander&#x27;s deeds and those of his warriors as heroic.

== Textual criticism ==
=== Manuscripts ===
The &quot;First Edition&quot; or &quot;First Redaction&quot; of the &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot; has been preserved in 13 manuscripts, with the oldest extant manuscripts dating from the 14th century, and the youngest to the 17th century. Yurii Begunov published the first list of all known 13 extant manuscripts in 1965. The 1377 Laurentian Codex only contains the &quot;Life″&quot;s beginning, the 1486 Synodal manuscript 154 only the beginning and end, while the other 11 manuscripts contain the full text of the &quot;First Edition&quot;. 

=== Textual history ===
Historian Vasily Klyuchevsky (1871) was the first to make a distinction between different editions of the &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot;, naming the oldest edition the &quot;First Edition&quot; ().

Yurii Begunov (1965), basing himself on thirteen stand-alone manuscripts, dated the first redaction of the &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot; to the 1280s, hypothesising that it had been composed in the Rozhdestvensky (Nativity) monastery in Vladimir-on-Kliazma. Begunov reasoned that during this recension, a passage was added mentioning that metropolitan Kirill II of Kiev declared that &quot;the sun has set in the Suzdalian Land&quot; at Nevsky&#x27;s funeral.

According to scholar Donald Ostrowski (2008), the original text of the &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot; was a secular military narrative, written by a layman in the late 13th century, who made no mention of &quot;the Suzdalian Land&quot;, nor of &quot;the Rus&#x27; Land&quot;. Some hagiographic motifs would be inserted by a cleric a century later, but still no reference to &quot;Suzdalian/Rus&#x27; Land&quot;. Ostrowski argued that the &quot;First Redaction&quot; of the &quot;Life&quot; should be dated to the mid-15th century, because it used the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; (NPL) Older Redaction as a source, whereas the NPL Younger Redaction incorporated parts of the &quot;Life&quot;. It would be this editor who added an allusion to Volodimer I of Kiev&#x27;s conversion of &quot;the Rus&#x27; Land&quot;, and two mentions of &quot;the Suzdalian Land&quot;, one of them the setting sun passage.

=== Authorship ===
In two 1947 papers, Dmitry Likhachev asserted that the author of the &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot; had to have been metropolitan Kirill II of Kiev (died 1280), who allegedly simultaneously authored the &quot;Chronicle of Daniil&quot; (corresponding to the 1246–1262 segment of the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot;) due to similarities in style. While this view soon became dominant amongst scholars (including Begunov, Günther Stökl, Norman Ingham, S. A. Zenkovsky, John Fennell, and O. V. Tvogorov) for decades, Mari Isoaho (2006) and Ostrowski (2008) firmly rejected Kirill&#x27;s authorship, pointing out numerous flaws in Likhachev&#x27;s reasoning, and internal and external evidence to the contrary.

<text>USS &quot;Whale&quot; (SSN-638) was a nuclear-powered attack submarine of the United States Navy. She was the second ship of that name, after the whale family of aquatic mammals.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Whale&quot;″s keel was laid down on 27 May 1964, at the General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division shipyard, in Quincy, Massachusetts. She was launched on 14 October 1966, sponsored by Mrs. Russell B. Long, the wife of United States Senator Russell B. Long, of Louisiana, and commissioned on 12 October 1968.

==Service history==
===1968===
&quot;Whale&quot; arrived in her first home port, Charleston, South Carolina, on 2 November 1968, and, after a week in port, put to sea on 9 November 1968, for shakedown training, which she completed in November and December 1968, along with a series of post-commissioning tests, trials, and qualifications. In January 1969, she began normal operations out of Charleston, with attack submarine training along the southeastern coast of the United States.

===1969===

On 18 March 1969, &quot;Whale&quot; stood out of Charleston, on her way north to operations above the Arctic Circle. She reached the North Pole, on 6 April 1969, and surfaced there in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of Rear Admiral Robert E. Peary&#x27;s 1909 arrival there. Following that event, she completed her mission under the polar ice cap and then headed south. After a visit to Faslane, Scotland, she voyaged home to Charleston, where she arrived on 9 May 1969.

Following two months of local operations out of Charleston, &quot;Whale&quot; sailed for Groton, Connecticut, and her post-shakedown repair period. After three months in the shipyard of the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation, at Groton, she started back to Charleston, on 16 October 1969. She arrived at Charleston, on 20 October, and conducted local operations for the remainder of 1969.

===1970===
During the first half of 1970, &quot;Whale&quot; continued operations out of Charleston. In late January, she participated in tests with a Navy Underwater Demolition Team and, in February and March, took part in three major fleet exercises. In April, she headed north for a brief tour of duty as training ship for the Prospective Commanding Officers&#x27; School at New London, Connecticut. She returned to Charleston, at the end of the first week in May, and spent the remainder of the month conducting acoustic trials.

&quot;Whale&quot; departed Charleston, on 27 July 1970, for an overseas deployment which she concluded in mid-September, with visits to Faslane and Holy Loch, in Scotland. While &quot;Whale&quot; visited Scotland, the Jordanian crisis, precipitated by civil war between the government of Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and aggravated by an incursion into northern Jordan by Syrian tanks, resulted a show of American strength in the eastern Mediterranean. &quot;Whale&quot; received orders to join the United States Sixth Fleet, in the Mediterranean, and did so near the end of September 1970. She remained in the Mediterranean through October and into November 1970. When the crisis abated, she headed for Charleston, arriving home on 18 November 1970, and remaining there for the remainder of the year.

===1971–1972===
Three fleet exercises and local operations out of Charleston, occupied &quot;Whale&quot; during the first half of 1971. Late in July, she deployed once more for special operations in the Atlantic Ocean, concluding that cruise late in September 1971, at Bremerhaven, West Germany. She returned to Charleston, on 12 October 1971, and resumed local operations upon arrival. That routine continued until 20 March 1972, when she departed once again for another special operations cruise in the Atlantic. At the end of that voyage, she made a brief call at Holy Loch, before returning to Charleston, on 9 June 1972.

Almost two months after her return to the United States, &quot;Whale&quot; left Charleston, and headed north to Naval Submarine Base New London, Connecticut, her new home port. She entered the shipyard at the Electric Boat Division, in Groton, on 7 August 1972, for a 46-week overhaul and remained there undergoing repairs until 27 October 1973.

===1973–1974===
&quot;Whale&quot; completed post-overhaul shakedown and refresher training in November and December 1973, and began preparations for another deployment to the Mediterranean, in response to the Middle Eastern crisis brought about by the Arab-Israeli War, in October 1973. Late in January 1974, however, she received notification that her deployment had been delayed until May 1974. During the interim, she conducted normal operations out of Groton, including submarine anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercises, attack submarine training, and a major fleet exercise, Operation Safe Passage. On 3 May 1974, she departed Groton en route the Mediterranean Sea. On 12 May 1974, she changed operational control from the United States Second Fleet to the Sixth Fleet.

While in the Mediterranean, &quot;Whale&quot; participated in two North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) exercises, &quot;International Week&quot; and &quot;Dale Falcon&quot;, with units of the Greek and Italian navies as well as several ASW exercises with other units of the Sixth Fleet. She passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and changed operational control back to the Commander, Submarines, United States Atlantic Fleet, on 18 October 1974. During the voyage back to Groton, &quot;Whale&quot; participated in a fleet ASW exercise which she completed on 28 October 1974. On 30 October 1974, she arrived at Groton.

===1975–1976===
&quot;Whale&quot; spent the next 11 months engaged in operations out of Groton. Various tests and evaluations occupied January, and the first half of February 1975. Between then and June 1975, she provided training services for various units of the Atlantic Fleet and for prospective commanding officers. &quot;Whale&quot; also served as a training platform for midshipmen during indoctrination cruises held late in the summer. On 29 September 1975, she stood out of Groton, for another deployment with the Sixth Fleet. During that cruise, she took part in a major Second Fleet exercise, &quot;Ocean Safari&quot;, and after joining the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, took part in a succession of unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral exercises with units of the navies of Greece, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. She completed her tour of duty with the Sixth Fleet during the second week in March 1976, and arrived at Groton on 25 March 1976.

===1976–1978===
&quot;Whale&quot; resumed normal United States East Coast operations until 9 September 1976, when she entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, for a refueling overhaul. That overhaul concluded on 7 July 1978. &quot;Whale&quot; then spent the remainder of 1978 in refresher training for the purpose of obtaining certification throughout the full range of her weapons system.

===1979–1987===
In April 1979, &quot;Whale&quot; departed Groton, for the Mediterranean. She made stops in Sousse, Tunisia; La Spezia, LaMaddellena and Naples, Italy and Tangier, Morocco. While in the Mediterranean Whale participated in fleet exercises.
1979-Fall, 1980: &quot;Whale&quot; was in an extended period of refit/repair (Selected Restricted Availability), in the floating drydock in Groton, Connecticut. After refloating, workups, and training, she proceeded south for torpedo proficiency exercises, stopping for liberty at Port Everglades, Florida. Go Go dancers from Butch Cassidy&#x27;s greeted &quot;Whale&quot; and her crew on arrival, and were heartily welcomed aboard. &quot;Whale&quot; spent the remainder of 1980, and early 1981, on short training and test deployments, one of which concluded with the &quot;Thunderbuoy&quot; and &quot;Whitefish&quot; exercises. With a fresh coat of paint, and a new skipper, CDR E.D. Morrow, &quot;Whale&quot; proceeded to the Mediterranean in June 1981, stopping on her way at Cartagena, Spain, which proved to be her only liberty port on this deployment. &quot;Whale&quot; spent the next six months in the Mediterranean Sea, taking part in the US Navy&#x27;s defiance of Libyan president Mohammar Khadaffi&#x27;s &quot;Line of Death&quot; in the Gulf of Sidra. &quot;Whale&quot; made periodic up-keeps at the submarine tender , in La Maddelena, Sardinia. Early 1982, found &quot;Whale&quot; back home in Groton, making frequent short training workup runs, honing the crew&#x27;s proficiency to a fine tune. In May 1982, &quot;Whale&quot; proceeded on an Atlantic deployment, (pollywogs among the crew becoming &quot;Bluenoses&quot; on the way), and later a stop in Faslane, Scotland. &quot;Whale&quot; earned the Battle &quot;E&quot; for efficiency after this deployment. Early 1983, &quot;Whale&quot; had a new skipper, Captain James E. Welsch. Mid 1983, &quot;Whale&quot; was suddenly given a double barrel patrol – a North Atlantic deployment immediately followed by an abbreviated Mediterranean patrol. This was due to being unable to handle her commitments. This deployment, dubbed the &quot;Nor-Med Run&quot;, was quite active, with port visits in Holy Loch, Scotland, Toulon, France, and La Spezia and La Maddalena, Italy. &quot;Whale&quot; left La Maddalena, on Christmas Day 1983, and returned to Groton, in January 1984. 1984 was spent doing up keep, refit, drilling, and short training deployments, most notably spending a week in St Croix, Virgin Islands. In January 1985, &quot;Whale&quot; again went on patrol to the Mediterranean, with stops in Holy Loch, Scotland, Brest, France, La Maddalena, Italy, as well as Rotterdam, Netherlands, prior to &quot;Whale&quot; being temporarily reassigned to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, at Bremerton, Washington, for an overhaul period starting in November 1985. While undergoing overhaul in 1986, &quot;Whale&quot; crew members formed a unit softball team, which competed in and won the Northwestern Pacific Softball Championship. For a crew of roughly 120 to compete against much larger ships and commands, this was quite an accomplishment.

===1988–1995===
January 1988, &quot;Whale&quot; was in Bremerton, completing its overhaul. She went through sea trials and left Washington, in May 1988, for her to return to her home port at Groton, under the command of Commander J. W. Francis. &quot;Whale&quot; crossed the equator on 17 June 1988, and transited the Panama Canal, on 19 June 1988, finally returning to Groton, as an operational unit of Submarine Squadron 10.

&quot;Whale&quot;″s next major deployment was to the Mediterranean from January through June 1989, during which she made stops in Scotland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy.

From August through December 1990, &quot;Whale&quot; was sent on a North Atlantic deployment under the command of Commander Ronald Deering, for which she was awarded her fifth Meritorious Unit Commendation.

In 1991, &quot;Whale&quot; was awarded the last Battle Efficiency Award (Battle &quot;E&quot;) from Submarine Squadron 10 She then was assigned to Submarine Squadron 2 and conducted a second &quot;Northern Run&quot; (i.e., North Atlantic deployment) in 1991.

In 1992, &quot;Whale&quot; participated in UNITAS XXXIII, an expedition around South America while under the command of Commander Andrew V. Harris, Jr., During UNITAS XXXIII she made port calls in Puerto Rico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Panama, and Colombia. The port visit in Panama was a somber one due to the sudden loss of the ship&#x27;s chief yeoman due to a heart attack. During UNITAS &quot;Whale&quot; again crossed the Equator, and transited the Panama Canal, (South to North), returning to port in November.

In 1993, &quot;Whale&quot; visited Bermuda, while transiting from the Autec Torpedo Firing Range, and Florida ports of call, conducted a scientific exercise under the ice cap at the North Pole and in the North Atlantic.

Following the final Change of Command in January 1994, &quot;Whale&quot; deployed to the Arctic with in support of combined United States and Royal Navy testing of submarine equipment as well as collection of environmental data in the polar region. JOINTSUBICEX 1-94 saw &quot;Whale&quot;″s second North Pole surfacing on 16 April 1994, 25 years and 10 days, after her first polar surfacing in 1969. Around this time, &quot;Whale&quot; circumnavigated the globe by circling the North Pole underwater to earn each crewmember the Order of Magellan. This circumnavigation occurred in about 15 minutes as the ship used underwater navigational means to cross every longitude, a feat that only a submarine could accomplish in 1994. Following visits to Norway, Germany and Scotland, &quot;Whale&quot; returned to SUBRON TWO in July 1994.

Following a circumnavigation of the world, &quot;Whale&quot; was deactivated while still in commission on 28 April 1995. &quot;Whale&quot; was placed in reserve, in commission, on 1 October 1995.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Whale&quot;″s scrapping via the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, at Bremerton, began on 20 October 1995. She was officially decommissioned on 25 June 1996, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping was completed on 1 July 1996, and she was officially listed as scrapped on 29 September 1997.

<text>Charlie Hunter (born May 23, 1967) is an American guitarist, composer, producer and bandleader. First coming to prominence in the early 1990s, Hunter plays custom-made seven- and eight-string guitars on which he simultaneously plays bass lines, chords, and melodies. Critic Sean Westergaard described Hunter&#x27;s technique as &quot;mind-boggling...he&#x27;s an agile improviser with an ear for great tone, and always has excellent players alongside him in order to make great music, not to show off.&quot; Hunter&#x27;s technique is rooted in the styles of jazz guitarists Joe Pass and Tuck Andress, two of his biggest influences, who blended bass notes with melody in a way that created the illusion of two guitars.

==Biography==

Charlie Hunter&#x27;s affinity for guitars was cultivated from a young age, largely due to his mother&#x27;s profession as a guitar repairer. He and his mother and sister lived for several years on a commune in Mendocino County, California, then settled in Berkeley. Hunter attended Berkeley High School and took lessons from rock guitarist Joe Satriani. At eighteen he moved to Paris. He has stated that busking in Paris gave him on the job training. Returning to San Francisco, he played seven-string guitar in Michael Franti&#x27;s political rap group, The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy. In 1992, they were one of the opening acts for U2&#x27;s Zoo TV Tour.

For his self-titled 1993 debut album, &quot;Charlie Hunter Trio&quot; (PrawnSong 1993), Hunter played a seven-string guitar for the duality effect, locking down the bottom with drummer Jay Lane and mixing melodically with saxophonist Dave Ellis (saxophonist). But on his trio’s 1995 sophomore release, &quot;Bing, Bing, Bing!&quot; (Blue Note, 1995), he unveiled his custom-made Novax eight-string guitar. Designed by Ralph Novak, the instrument featured fanned frets and separate pickups for its guitar and bass portions. Picking bass notes with his right thumb while fretting them with his left index finger (while at the same time fingerpicking guitar chords and single notes with his right hand’s remaining four digits as he frets with his left hand’s other three fingers), Hunter achieves the real sound of two-for-one.

Hunter played with the side group T.J. Kirk in the mid-’90s, a band that derived their name from the cover material they exclusively played: Thelonious Monk, James Brown, and Rahsaan Roland Kirk. T.J. Kirk released a self-titled 1995 debut and their 1996 follow-up, If Four Was One received a GRAMMY nomination. Hunter’s next project was an instrumental remake of Bob Marley’s &quot;Natty Dread&quot; album in its entirety. Also featuring saxophonists Kenny Brooks and Calder Spanier, the 1997 release beat the odds by becoming arguably Hunter’s best album. Teaming with vibraphonist Stefon Harris and percussionist John Santos, Charlie Hunter &amp; Pound for Pound released &quot;Return of the Candyman&quot; (Blue Note 1998). A departure from &quot;Natty Dread&quot;, mainly due to the work of Harris, the disc featured a vibes-heavy cover of Steve Miller’s “Fly Like an Eagle.”

He performed on three songs on D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s album &quot;Voodoo&quot; (2000), including &quot;The Root&quot;. He has stated that the session for the song was the most challenging session he has worked on.

In between tours he recorded a 1999 duo album with drummer/percussionist Leon Parker and a self-titled 2000 album that featured Parker and an otherwise ensemble cast. Hunter also contributed greatly to the 2000 comeback album by drummer Mike Clark (drummer), Actual Proof. Hunter concluded his run at Blue Note with 2001’s &quot;Songs from the Analog Playground&quot;, which saw him collaborating with vocalists for the first time, ranging from labelmates Norah Jones and Kurt Elling to Mos Def. 2003 found Hunter with a new label (Ropeadope) and two new bands (the Charlie Hunter Quintet) on Right Now Move, and the beginning of Groundtruther, a partnership with percussionist/composer Bobby Previte. They released &quot;Come in Red Dog, This Is Tango Leader&quot; before adopting the Groundtruther moniker. In 2003 he released &quot;Friends Seen and Unseen&quot;, with drummer Derrek Phillips and saxman John Ellis (saxophonist), both members of the Quintet. By now, Groundtruther had taken on a life of its own, with Hunter and Previte joined by a rotating third member. &quot;Latitude&quot; was first, in 2004 with saxophonist Greg Osby, followed by &quot;Longitude&quot; with DJ Logic in 2005.

In 2006, the Charlie Hunter Trio resurfaced with &quot;Copperopolis&quot;. After recruiting Erik Deutsch on keys and Simon Lott on drums, the trio released &quot;Mistico&quot; in the summer of 2007. In 2008, Hunter released the self-titled Charlie Hunter Trio and &quot;Baboon Strength&quot; and then continued into the new decade with &quot;Gentlemen, I Neglected to Inform You You Will Not Be Getting Paid.&quot; Hunter&#x27;s exploration into various genres led to the creation of a unique catalog of instrumental music From 2008 to 2018, he released a series of albums that further explored his 7-string guitar style. Highlights during this period were “Baboon Strength” (2008), “Gentlemen I Neglected to Tell You You Will Not Be Getting Paid” (2009), “ Let the Bells Ring On&quot; (2015), &quot;Everybody Has a Plan Until They Get Punched in the Mouth&quot; (2016). In 2016, he embarked on a groundbreaking tour with a new quartet that included a trombone, an instrument seldom seen in his previous line-ups. After releasing Blue Note’s &quot;Songs of the Analog Playground&quot; which featured Norah Jones, Kurt Elling, Mos Def, Theryl DeClouet, he continued to work with vocalists such as D’Angelo, Frank Ocean, John Mayer, alongside emerging voices like Dara Tucker, Lucy Woodward, Silvana Estrada, Maritzaida and Victoria Elliott.

By the end of the decade, Hunter’s innovative and pioneering contributions to the jazz genre had significantly reshaped its landscape, earning him a place among the most influential jazz artists of the 21st century.

During the 2019 pandemic, Hunter turned his attention towards music production and long-distance collaborations. This led to the creation of Wheelhouse Beats, a groundbreaking metronome app featuring some of today’s most notable drummers. Furthermore, Hunter founded SideHustle Records, his personal record label and artist development house. As a staunch advocate for artist rights, he gained control of his master recordings, which he subsequently remastered and reissued. SideHustle Records’ artist development house is committed to nurturing emerging talent. Occasionally teaming up with The Little Village Foundation, a non-profit organization known for its dedication to promoting and preserving diverse cultural expressions, Hunter works to amplify new voices and talents and build a more inclusive music community. His various collaborations are instrumental in escalating the careers of many budding artists, further establishing his reputation as a producer, collaborator and mentor.

After a long-distance collaboration, former Blue Note label mate and GRAMMY award-winning vocalist, Kurt Elling, alongside Hunter, Corey Fonville, and DJ Harrison (Butcher Brown), debuted their innovative band, SuperBlue, in late 2020. Their unique blend of traditional jazz elements with modern influences heralds a new era of music exploration. Following their debut, the band embarked on several international tours and released four LPs. SuperBlue has been nominated twice for the GRAMMY awards.

==Equipment==
Hunter currently plays 6 and 7 string guitars made by Hybrid Guitars Co. Hybrid Guitars was founded in 2015 when he teamed up with luthiers Clay Conner and Wes Lambe to produce fanned-fret instruments to his specifications. www.hybrid-guitars.com Previously, Hunter played custom-made seven-string guitar/s made by Jeff Traugott, eight-string guitar/s made by luthier Ralph Novak of Novax Guitars. He played chords and lead guitar solos on the top five strings (tuned ADGBE), and simultaneously played bass lines on the bottom three strings (tuned EAD). With the addition of a Hughes &amp; Kettner Tube Rotosphere (a Leslie rotary speaker simulator), his unique style produced a sound similar to that of a Hammond organ—an instrument he set out to imitate.

In 2006, Hunter removed the top guitar string and had the neck of his guitar reworked and now plays a modified 7-string on the formerly-8 string body. Hunter has mentioned that because of his small hands, he had to move out of position to make use of the 8th string and thus wasn&#x27;t using it much. A change in Hunter&#x27;s style away from the organ sound into a more blues and distortion based sound happened at the same time. After removing the 8th string, Hunter retuned all of the strings up a half step: F-Bb-Eb on the bass and Bb-Eb-Ab-C on the guitar. As of 2008, he had once again retuned up another whole step: G-C-F on the bass and C-F-Bb-D on the guitar.

<text>Sesfontein is a settlement in the Kunene Region of Namibia, situated from the regional capital Opuwo. It is the district capital of Sesfontein Constituency with a population of 7,358. Sesfontein derives its name from the six fountains which have their source in the vicinity. The settlement features a clinic.

The most well known landmark of Sesfontein is Fort Sesfontein, erected in 1896 as a police outpost by &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; soldiers of Imperial Germany. It was abandoned in 1914 and fell into disrepair soon thereafter. Considered a prospective National Monument in 1984 it was decided in 1989 not to list it. The fort was reconstructed in the 1990s and is now equipped to accommodate tourists. The palm trees at the fort were planted by the German police officers who manned the fort to combat weapons smuggling and elephant and rhino poaching.

Hendrik Gaobaeb, president of the United Democratic Front, was born in Sesfontein.

<doc id="953301" wikidata="Q8016965" url="?curid=953301" title="William Plunket, 1st Baron Plunket">
<text>William Conyngham Plunket, 1st Baron Plunket, PC (Ire), QC (1 July 1764 – 5 January 1854) was an Irish politician and lawyer. After gaining public notoriety as the prosecutor in the treason trial of Robert Emmet in 1803, he rose rapidly in government service. He become Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1830 and served, with a brief interruption, in that post until his retirement in 1841.

==Background and education==
The son of a Presbyterian minister, Reverend Thomas Plunket of Dublin, and his wife Mary (née Conyngham), Plunket was born in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, and educated at Trinity College Dublin. After graduating in 1784, he was admitted as a student at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and was called to the Irish bar three years later.

==Prosecution of Robert Emmet and political career==
Plunket was made a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1795, and three years later was elected to the Irish House of Commons as a Member of Parliament for Charlemont. After the Act of Union was passed, Plunket lost his seat, and failed to be elected to Westminster for Dublin University in 1802. He was restored to prominence in September 1803 as the prosecuting counsel in the treason trial of Robert Emmet.

Lord Castlereagh, as a principal architect of the Acts of Union, had been acutely embarrassed by Emmet&#x27;s abortive rising in Dublin. He advised that &quot;the best thing would be to go into no detail whatever upon the case, to keep the subject clearly standing on its own narrow base of a contemptible insurrection without means or respectable leaders&quot;. It is an instruction that Plunket appears to have followed.

The prosecution itself presented no difficulty: the evidence was overwhelming and the Crown had taken the extra precaution of suborning Emmet&#x27;s defence attorney, Leonard McNally, for £200 and a pension. But when McNally announced that the trial was concluded because his client wished to call no witnesses nor &quot;take up the time of the court&quot;, Plunket took to his feet to berate the prisoner. He mocked Emmet as the deluded leader of a conspiracy encompassing &quot;the bricklayer, the old clothes man, the hodman and the hostler&quot;.

Plunket was made Solicitor-General for Ireland and, in 1805, Attorney-General for Ireland. He was also raised to the Irish Privy Council. As Solicitor General, Plunket was one of the Irish officials singled out for attack in a series of scurrilous letters published by the radical journalist William Cobbett in his weekly newspaper &quot;Political Register.&quot;

Plunket was alluded to as &quot;the viper&quot; who &quot;in an unheard of exercise of prerogative&quot; had &quot;wantonly lashed [...] the dying son of his former friend [Emmet&#x27;s father at whose table it was alleged Plunket had often dined], when that dying son produced no evidence, and had made no defence; but on the contrary had acknowledged his offence and submitted to his fate&quot;. Plunket was able to bring successful libel cases both against Cobbett and against the author of the letters, &quot;Juverna&quot; (a variant of Hibernia, Ireland) whom he had unmasked as Robert Johnson, a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland), who was forced to resign from the Bench as a result.

In January 1807, Plunket was returned to British House of Commons as a Whig member for Midhurst, representing the constituency for only three months, although he subsequently returned to the House of Commons in 1812 as the member for Dublin University, a seat which he continued to represent until May 1827.

In 1822 he was reappointed to the office of Attorney-General for Ireland, since William Saurin (Attorney General 1807–22) was implacably opposed to Catholic emancipation, which the Crown now accepted was inevitable. Plunket, unlike Saurin, supported Emancipation and was able to work in reasonable harmony with Daniel O&#x27;Connell to secure it.

In 1827, relinquishing his seat in the House of Commons, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Plunket, of Newton in the County of Cork and was appointed Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas.

He was an advocate of Catholic emancipation, and served as Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1830 to 1841, with a brief interval when the Tories were in power between 1834 and 1835. He was forced into retirement to allow Sir John Campbell to assume office.

His tenure as Chancellor was not without controversy: opponents accused him of political partisanship, lengthy absences from work, and nepotism on a scale unusual even in an age when it was understood that officeholders took care of their relatives.

==Family==
Plunket was married to Catherine McCausland, daughter of John McCausland of Strabane and Elizabeth Span, daughter of Reverend William Span of Ballmacove, County Donegal. Their son Thomas became Church of Ireland Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry. Thomas&#x27;s eldest daughter the Honourable Katherine Plunket (1820–1932) was the longest-lived Irish person ever. Their other children included sons Patrick (died 1859), judge of the Court of Bankruptcy, and Robert (Dean of Tuam from 1850), and a daughter, Louisa. In Dublin, Plunket was a member of Daly&#x27;s Club. He died in January 1854, aged 89, at his country house, Old Connaught, near Bray, County Wicklow, and was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son, Thomas.

He lived in considerable state: Sir Walter Scott, who visited him at Old Connaught, left a glowing tribute to Plunket&#x27;s charm and hospitality, and the excellence of his food and wine.

<text>Still Life with Spherical Mirror is a lithography print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher first printed in November 1934. It depicts a setting with rounded bottle and a metal sculpture of a bird with a human face seated atop a newspaper and a book. The background is dark, but in the bottle can be seen the reflection of Escher&#x27;s studio and Escher himself sketching the scene.

Self-portraits in reflective spherical surfaces can be found in Escher&#x27;s early ink drawings and in his prints as late as the 1950s. The metal bird/human sculpture is real and was given to Escher by his father-in-law. This sculpture appears again in Escher&#x27;s later prints &quot;Another World Mezzotint (Other World Gallery)&quot; (1946) and &quot;Another World&quot; (1947).

<doc id="953311" wikidata="Q3182930" url="?curid=953311" title="Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment">
<text>The Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment was a short-lived infantry regiment of the British Army.

==History==
The regiment was formed in 1994 by the amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Regiment (Berkshire and Wiltshire).

It was the only regiment in the British Army whose members were permitted to wear a cap badge on both the front and the rear of their headdress. The back badge was awarded to the 28th Regiment of Foot for their actions at the Battle of Alexandria in 1801 when the regiment fought on whilst completely surrounded by the enemy.

The regiment was also unique in the British Army in that it was permitted to wear the United States Presidential Unit Citation, which it inherited from the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment which was awarded for their defence of Gloster Hill during the Battle of the Imjin River in April 1951 during the Korean War.

Between 2002 and 2005, the 1st Battalion, Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment served as a public duties battalion in London, where its duties included providing the Queen&#x27;s Guard. It was while the RGBW was on guard at Buckingham Palace that the Fathers 4 Justice protest took place.

In April 2004, 16 Territorial Army soldiers from the regiment joined the TA Force Protection Company, Salamanca Company, and deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Telic.

On 16 December 2004, the Ministry of Defence announced a reorganisation of the infantry regiments. In preparation for this, the regiment was moved from the Prince of Wales&#x27; Division to the Light Division and renamed the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry in July 2005.

On 24 November 2005, the Ministry of Defence announced further changes to the amalgamations. The regiment would amalgamate with the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, the Royal Green Jackets and The Light Infantry to form a new large regiment to be called The Rifles. The new regiment came into existence in 2007.

The Colours of the 1st Battalion were laid up at the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum in Gloucester and the Colours of the 2nd Battalion were laid up at the Wardrobe, home of The Rifles Berkshire and Wiltshire Museum in Salisbury.

==Volunteers==
In 1995, the regiment formed its own territorial battalion: 2nd (Volunteer) Battalion, Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment, through the amalgamation of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Wessex Regiment. Its structure was:
*HQ (Berkshire) Company, at Brock Barracks, Reading
**Assault Pioneer Platoon, at Cinderford
*A (Gloucester) Company, at Gloucester and Cheltenham
*B (City of Bristol) Company, at Bristol
*C (Wiltshire) Company, at Devizes and Swindon

In 1999 the battalion was split up, with A and B Companies amalgamating to form The Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment Company, Rifle Volunteers; and HQ and C Companies amalgamating to form The Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment Company, Royal Rifle Volunteers.

==Alliances==
* - The Royal Canadian Regiment
* - The Lincoln and Welland Regiment
* - The Algonquin Regiment
* - 11th/28th Battalion, The Royal Western Australia Regiment
* - 13th Battalion, The Frontier Force Regiment
* - 3rd Battalion, The Kenya Rifles

<text>Hand with Reflecting Sphere, also known as Self-Portrait in Spherical Mirror, is a lithograph by Dutch artist M. C. Escher, first printed in January 1935. The piece depicts a hand holding a reflective sphere. In the reflection, most of the room around Escher can be seen, and the hand holding the sphere is revealed to be Escher&#x27;s.
Self-portraits in reflective, spherical surfaces are common in Escher&#x27;s work. In much of his self-portraiture of this type, Escher is in the act of drawing the sphere, whereas in this image he is seated and gazing into it. On the walls there are several framed pictures, one of which appears to be of an Indonesian shadow puppet.

<doc id="953314" wikidata="Q3884265" url="?curid=953314" title="Option (filmmaking)">
<text>In the film industry, an option agreement is a contract that &quot;rents&quot; the rights to a source material to a potential film producer. 
It grants the film producer the exclusive option to purchase rights to the source material if they live up to the terms of the contract and make a film (or series) from it. This is known as optioning the source material.

Some examples of producers are film studios, production companies or an individual. Source materials are often a book, theatrical play, or screenplay; however, they may also be articles, video games, songs, or any other work of intellectual property. 

The term is often used as a verb. For example, &quot;Paramount optioned a short story by Ted Chiang.&quot;

==Overview==
When a work is optioned, the producer has not actually purchased the right to use the source material; they have simply purchased the option to purchase the rights to the work at some point in the future, if they are successful in setting up a deal to actually film a movie (or series) based on it.

Purchasing the actual rights to a work is called &quot;exercising&quot; the option. This requires another contract, the &quot;Rights Purchase Agreement&quot;.

Option agreements detail the rights of the producer and the original author, including how long the agreement lasts, the fees paid to the author, and any plans for rights associated with derivative works (for example, a future prequel to a book).

The producer usually has to outline their plan for financing, writing, casting, and shooting the film or series.

Financially, the contract qualifies as a financial option and may be valued by applying real options analysis.

===Exclusivity===
Film option agreements last for a set amount of time, which is called the &quot;option period&quot; and is often around eighteen months.

After the option period expires, the producer no longer has an exclusive right to buy the screenplay and the original work&#x27;s rights are returned to the author.

===Fees===
Most option agreements have two option periods, which have separate timelines and fees. The initial option fee is negotiated during the original agreement. They vary greatly from deal to deal. 

The fee for the first option period can be detracted from any income received from the project after the original work is exercised, while the fee for the extension cannot.

A portion of the film&#x27;s financing is usually used to pay the exercise price. This is also called the &quot;purchase price&quot;. The producer has until the end of the last extension period to exercise the option.

==Producer&#x27;s role during the option period==
During the option period, the producers often:
# Get the screenplay written (if the option was on a book or other work, and not a screenplay);
# Obtain informal agreements with the director, the principal actors, the film crew, and the financiers;
# Take it to a movie studio or other potential financier and potentially help with distribution (pre-sales);
# Finalize the screenplay to the agreement of all stakeholders—the exclusivity of the option allows this step without risk of a rival attempt to produce the same property.

This process can last for a prolonged period of time known as development hell. 

If all planning falls into place, actual agreements are signed, financing is secured, and the option fee is paid, then the producer can start pre-production.

===Options in Hollywood===
Options are not expensive by the standards of Hollywood movies. For &quot;True Romance&quot;, Quentin Tarantino received US$50,000 to option his script. Many writers are happy to receive a few thousand dollars. Option contracts typically specify the eventual cost of the screenplay, if the producer does end up exercising the option.

Since optioning a screenplay is far cheaper than buying it, options are very popular in Hollywood for speculative projects.

<text>Novella Calligaris (born 27 December 1954) is a retired Italian swimmer, and the first Italian to win an Olympic medal in swimming. Her elder brother Mauro Calligaris was also an Olympic swimmer.

==Biography==
Aged 13 Calligaris competed at the 1968 Olympics in the 200 m, 400 m and 800 m freestyle, but was eliminated in the heats of all events. At 14, she set her first European record. At the 1972 Summer Olympics, she won a medal in every event she competed: a silver medal in the 400 m freestyle, a bronze in the 800 m freestyle, and another bronze in the 400 m individual medley.

The following year, the first FINA World Championships took place in Belgrade. On 9 September 1973, Novella swam 8:52.97 in the 800 m freestyle event, setting a new world record and winning a gold medal. In the same competition she also finished third in the 400 m freestyle and 400 m individual medley.

At the 1974 European Championships, she won two medals, one silver and one bronze. These were the last international achievements of her career, which ended shortly afterward. In retirement she coached swimming, and in the 1980s worked with the junior national team in Rome.

During her career Calligaris won 76 national titles and set 82 national and 21 European records. Until Federica Pellegrini&#x27;s second place in 200 m freestyle at the 2004 Athens Olympics, she was the only Italian woman to win an Olympic medal in swimming. In 1986 she was inducted to the International Swimming Hall of Fame.

<text>Regular Division of the Plane is a series of drawings by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher which began in 1936. These images are based on the principle of tessellation, irregular shapes or combinations of shapes that interlock completely to cover a surface or plane.

The inspiration for these works began in 1936 with a visit to the Alhambra, a fourteenth-century Moorish castle near Granada, Spain. Escher had visited the Alhambra once before in 1922 but in this visit he had spent several days studying and sketching the ornate tile designs there.

In 1958 Escher published his book &quot;The Regular Division of the Plane&quot;. This book included several woodcut prints to demonstrate the concept, but the series of drawings continued until the late 1960s, ending at drawing #137. While not Escher&#x27;s most artistically important works, some of these patterns are among Escher&#x27;s most famous, having been used for a number of commercial products, including neckties.

<doc id="953323" wikidata="Q7064777" url="?curid=953323" title="November 9th Society">
<text>The November 9th Society (also known as the British First Party or N9S) is a British neo-Nazi group, formed in 1977 by Terry Flynn. The 9th of November has been a pivotal date in German history on several occasions: the execution of the liberal leader Robert Blum which effectively ended the German revolutions in 1848; the abdication of Wilhelm II, German Emperor and the end of the German Empire in 1918; the failed Nazi Beer Hall Putsch in 1923; and the beginning of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938.

==History==
Under Flynn&#x27;s leadership, N9S functioned as a pressure group, but under the leadership of Kevin Quinn, the group has taken a more active role in British politics. Under the name British First Party, the group ran two candidates in the May 2007 UK local elections in Sunderland. In St Anne&#x27;s ward, the BFP candidate received 257 votes of 2,293 votes in total, finishing ahead of the Liberal Democrats and three votes behind the British National Party (BNP). In Redhill ward, the BFP candidate received 78 out of 2,540 votes cast.

N9S has had sporadic activity since inception, and &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine claims the group had 120 members although the numbers are deemed far lower due to the forming of the British First Party causing a split between members. They produce the magazine &quot;Britain Awake&quot;, and previously had a blog on their website. On 17 December 2005 and 20 March 2006, they were involved demonstrations outside the Austrian embassy in support of David Irving, who was awaiting trial in Austria for Holocaust denial and was subsequently jailed for three years. They took part in a similar demonstration on 20 December 2006, the day of Irving&#x27;s early release. At one point, N9S had a youth leader (an ex-football hooligan) and regional leaders who operated in groups to distribute leaflets.

The group prided itself on strong security, and members were encouraged not to reveal their real identities online. However, the anonymity of several members was compromised in February 2006 when the group became the subject of an undercover investigation by a reporter from British tabloid newspaper &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;. The paper reported that a reporter had infiltrated the group and filmed several members, including Quinn, verbally abusing Jewish people in the street, boasting of having committed violent attacks, and making overtly racist jokes. Quinn claimed that these were outright lies. In November 2006, the &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot; published an exposé of the society, alleging among other things, that the members wear Nazi regalia in private, and are attempting to recruit youths.

The party formed a political party under the name British First Party. The N9S&#x27;s slogan of &quot;We will never change to flirt with public opinion&quot; came to an end when the BFP was introduced, and many other right wing parties turned their back on the N9S/BFP ever being a serious contender in British politics. Its UK core members wear an identifying silver &#x27;fraternity&#x27; ring among their regalia. It was renamed back to November 9th Society in November 2007.

==Platform==
The society campaigns against non-white immigration, abortion, communism, foreign aid and homosexuality. It promotes a hierarchical system of leadership, repatriation, Holocaust denial and British ownership of industry; with all banking controlled by a central government bank and all media outlets becoming nationalised. N9S members are critical of the BNP, whom they view as too moderate, even dubbing them &#x27;Conservatives on steroids&#x27;.

The party states that its name comes from the date in 1923 when 16 Nazis lost their lives at Feldherrnhalle as part of the Beer Hall Putsch. Opponents have argued that the name is actually based on the Kristallnacht in 1938, and that N9S is merely a force for anti-Semitism. Party members deny such criticism but do cite Israel as the cause of Islamic violence in Britain whilst also condemning &quot;Jewish bankers&quot;.

<text>The Guide Star Catalog (GSC), also known as the &quot;Hubble Space Telescope, Guide Catalog&quot; (&quot;HSTGC&quot;), is a star catalog compiled to support the Hubble Space Telescope with targeting off-axis stars. GSC-I contained approximately 20,000,000 stars with apparent magnitudes of 6 to 15. GSC-II contains 945,592,683 stars out to magnitude 21. As far as possible, binary stars and non-stellar objects have been excluded or flagged as not meeting the requirements of Fine Guidance Sensors. This is the first full sky star catalog created specifically for navigation in outer space.

==History==

===Version 1.0===
The first version of this catalog was published in 1989. The first catalog was created by digitizing photographic plates produced by the Palomar Schmidt Quick-V survey for the northern hemisphere and the UK Schmidt SERC-J survey for the southern hemisphere. This catalog contains objects in the magnitude range 7-16 and the classification was biased to prevent the use of a non-stellar object as a guide star. The photometry is based on a photoelectric sequence (9-15th mag) near the center of each Schmidt plate. Stellar photometry was performed in a manner that would systematically reject galaxies. Astrometry was determined using the AGK3, SAOC or CPC catalog stars depending on plate declination. Although the relative astrometry (required for HST) is about 0.3 arc seconds, there are known systematic errors near the plate edges of 1 to 2 arc seconds.

===Version 1.1===
The first revision of the catalog was published in 1992. The Tycho Input Catalog was created by the Hipparcos/Tycho international consortia in preparation for the Hipparcos satellite mission. They produced a catalog containing the best available data for all stars to magnitude 11. Adding the bright star data from this catalog to the GSC produced a complete all-sky catalog down to the GSC limiting magnitude. In addition, many of the false objects due to artifacts around the halos and diffraction spikes of the bright stars were identified and corrected as well as a number of reported errors. A number of astrographic plates centered on southern hemisphere bright stars (of magnitude less than 3) were also processed and added to the catalog. This was the version used by HST operations prior to cycle 15.

===Version 1.2===
Version 1.2 was published in 2001. It was produced in collaboration with the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut in Heidelberg. This version reduces the plate-based position-dependent and magnitude-dependent systematic errors. The PPM and AC reference catalogs were used and absolute position errors have been reduced to between 0.3 and 0.4 arc seconds.

==Catalog format==
When quoting a catalog entry, the format is &quot;GSC FFFFF-NNNNN&quot;, or alternately, &quot;GSCfffff0nnnnn&quot; (fffff0nnnnn). The F-sequence references a Hubble sky region code.

==Guide Star Catalog II==
A significant expansion of the catalog, Guide Star Catalog II, was published in 2008. The Guide Star Catalog II (GSC-II) was compiled by the Catalog and Surveys branch of the Space Telescope Science Institute and the astrometry team of the Astronomical Observatory of Torino (Italy). It has entries for 945,592,683 stars, and has positions, classifications, and magnitudes for 455,851,237 stars. The latest revision of this version (2.3.4) is in active use for accurately positioning the Hubble Space Telescope.

<text>Still Life and Street is an unusual woodcut print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher which was first printed in March, 1937. It was his first print of an impossible reality. In this artwork there are two distinctly recognizable realities bound together in a natural yet impossible way. Looked at from the window, the houses make book-rests between which tiny dolls are set up. Looked at from the street, the books stand yards high and a gigantic tobacco jar stands at the crossroads.

A small street in Savona, Italy, was the inspiration for this work. Escher said it was one of his favorite drawings but thought he could have drawn it better.

This image is a classic example of Escher&#x27;s plays on perspective. In it, the horizontal plane of the table continues into the distance to become the street, and the rows of books on the table are seen to lean against the tall buildings that line the street.

<text>Haji Gokool Meah (1847–1939) was a Kashmiri Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian industrialist and philanthropist. He was born into an Kashmiri Muslim family to Caulloo and Puddoo in Kashmir which then was part of the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir at that time. He was originally named Modhoo. His father died shortly before his birth and his mother remarried.

As a small child, his family left Kashmir and ended up in Calcutta where in 1852 they signed up as indentured labourers bound for the sugarcane fields of Trinidad and Tobago. On 25 January 1853 they arrived in Trinidad aboard the &quot;Benares&quot;. They were indentured at the Concord Estate in Pointe-à-Pierre. After three months, his mother died of malaria and his stepfather took little interest in him. He was informally adopted by a Hindu couple who gave him the name Gokool.

Once he was old enough, Gokool secured his own indentureship contract with the Concord Estate. He renewed his contract once it expired, and then went out on his own. He purchased a donkey cart and made a living hauling sugarcane to the factory at Usine Sainte Madeline, then the second largest sugar refinery in the world. After a few years of this trade, he sold his cart and established a shop in Danglade Village on the road to San Fernando (now part of the Petrotrin oil refinery at Pointe-à-Pierre). Gokool was a true entrepreneur who started off in the cane-cart business and then was a shopkeeper. By 1892, Gokool was able to purchase Diamond, Greenhill and River Estates, comprising almost the whole Diego Martin valley, which he developed as cocoa plantations.

He married Rojan and had 17 children, 11 of whom survived. From shopkeeping he moved on to cocoa cultivation, establishing one of the early cocoa plantations in the Diego Martin valley. From cocoa he moved on the real estate, by 1918, Gokool took advantage of recession prices in the wake of World War I and brought several properties in Port-of-Spain. This turned out to be a masterstroke in the long-run, becoming one of the major landlords in Port of Spain. In 1933, he also established himself as a cinema magnate, establishing the Metro cinema in collaboration with MGM. Gokool opened the cinema at the corner of St Vincent and Park Streets, called Green Corner, and called it the Metro Cinema. The ornate faux classical-style building, with its plush red-carpeted walls, could seat over 1,000 people in balcony and pit, and cost over $80,000 to construct. By comparison, in those days you could buy the whole of Aranguez for $22,000. The cinema was as big a hit as its films. He later split with MGM and renamed his cinema the Globe Cinema, eventually operating a string of five cinemas in Port of Spain and San Fernando. He also opened other Globe cinemas in Princes Town and Chaguanas. Gokool died in 1940, aged 92, leaving behind the cinemas he founded.

In 1922 he performed the Haj (Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca) with his son Noor. In 1927, he built a masjid in St James which stands to this day. In his will, he established the Haji Gokool Meah Trust, a trust to continue the charitable works which had earned him the title &quot;Meah&quot; (benefactor).

<text>Metamorphosis I is a woodcut print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher which was first printed in May, 1937. This piece measures and is printed on two sheets.

The concept of this work is to morph one image into a tessellated pattern, then gradually to alter the outlines of that pattern to become an altogether different image. From left to right, the image begins with a depiction of the coastal Italian town of Atrani (see &quot;Atrani, Coast of Amalfi&quot;). The outlines of the architecture then morph to a pattern of three-dimensional blocks. These blocks then slowly become a tessellated pattern of cartoon-like figures in oriental attire.

<text>Robert Brasillach (; 31 March 1909 – 6 February 1945) was a French author and journalist. He was the editor of &quot;Je suis partout&quot;, a nationalist newspaper which advocated fascist movements and supported Jacques Doriot. After the liberation of France in 1944, he was executed following a trial and Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s express refusal to grant him a pardon. Brasillach was executed for advocating collaborationism, denunciation and incitement to murder. The execution remains a subject of some controversy, because Brasillach was executed for &quot;intellectual crimes&quot;, rather than military or political actions.

==Biography==
Robert Brasillach was born in Perpignan on 31 March 1909, the son of Lieutenant Arthémile Brasillach, who served in the colonial regiment of Marshall Lyautey in Morocco, and Marguerite Brasillach, née Redo. He studied at the École normale supérieure, at the time a school of the University of Paris, and then became a novelist and literary critic for the Action française of Charles Maurras. After the 6 February 1934 crisis in the Place de la Concorde, Brasillach openly supported fascism. His politics are shared by several of the protagonists in his literary works, notably the two male main characters in &quot;The Seven Colours&quot; (see below).

===Author===
Brasillach wrote both fiction and non-fiction. While his fiction dealt with love, life and politics in his era, his non-fiction dealt with a great variety of themes, ranging from drama, great literary figures and contemporary world events. His work in the realm of cinema history (see below) was particularly influential.

====Cinema====
Brasillach was fascinated by the cinema and in 1935 co-wrote a detailed critical history of that medium, &quot;Histoire du cinéma&quot; (re-edited in 1943), with his brother-in-law, Maurice Bardèche. This work remained the &quot;most prominent aesthetic history of film for at least a decade&quot;, and a work that exerted considerable influence, via its impact on Georges Sadoul (who nonetheless disliked the authors) until the 1970s. Unlike several other authors and critics of the time, Brasillach did not see cinema through an overtly political lens, although the 1943 edition of his work did contain anti-Semitic comments not present in the original. Despite being fervent nationalists and personally believing that each nation and people had a unique cinema, the authors instead focused on international trends rather than local particularities. Brasillach frequented Henri Langlois&#x27; &quot;Cercle du cinéma&quot; (Cinema Circle). His personal tastes are detailed in his writings of the period. These tastes ranged from Soviet cinema (&quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; and &quot;Alexander Nevski&quot;) to film-makers Charlie Chaplin, G.W. Pabst, René Clair and Jean Renoir and to some Hollywood films from directors such as John Ford, Frank Borzage and King Vidor. Brasillach was drawn to originality and explored foreign cinema, and became the first major critic in France to address Japanese cinema, the work of Yasujirō Ozu, Kenji Mizoguchi and Heinosuke Gosho. While in prison, he worked on a third edition of his work on cinema and began to adapt a work on Falstaff which he hoped to film with Raimu.

===Politics and wartime activities===
He became an editor of &quot;Je suis partout&quot;, a fascist paper founded by dissidents from the Action Française and led by Pierre Gaxotte. Brasillach was attracted to the fascistic Rexist movement in Belgium, and wrote an article and later a book about the leader of the movement, Leon Degrelle. Brasillach admired what he perceived to be Degrelle&#x27;s youth and charisma and Degrelle&#x27;s insistence on being neither left nor right, supporting striking workers, encouraging love of God, the King and family and desiring to see the establishment of an anti-communist and anti-capitalist, Christian-influenced corporate state. Degrelle collaborated with the German occupation of Belgium and served in the Waffen-SS. Brasillach was also greatly impressed by José Antonio Primo de Rivera and his Falangist movement. By contrast, he described &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; as a &quot;masterpiece of cretinism&quot; in which Hitler appeared to be &quot;a sort of enraged teacher.&quot;

A soldier in 1940, Brasillach was captured by the Germans and held prisoner for several months after the fall of France. At his trial, the prosecution alleged that his release was due to pro-German articles written while in captivity. He was freed in early 1941 and returned to his editorial role at &quot;Je suis partout&quot;. He wrote in favour of the Vichy regime but later embraced a more committed germanophile policy of collaboration and Nazi policies and began to criticize the Vichy state. He joined a group of French authors and artists in a trip to meet with German counterparts in Weimar and in November 1942 he supported the German militarisation of the unoccupied zone (Case Anton) under the Vichy government because it &quot;reunited France&quot;.

He visited the site of the Katyn massacre, toured the Eastern Front, visited Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism and wrote, on his return to France, that he had gone from embracing a collaboration due to reason and rationality to being a collaborator for reasons of the heart (&quot;De collaborationiste de raison, je suis devenu collaborationiste de coeur&quot;). He published the names and addresses of Jews who had gone into hiding, called for the death of left-wing politicians, and in the summer of 1944 signed the call for the summary execution of all members of the French Resistance. He considered himself a &quot;moderate&quot; antisemite and was replaced as editor of &quot;Je suis partout&quot; in 1943 by the even more extreme Pierre-Antoine Cousteau. He was a member of the Groupe Collaboration, an initiative that encouraged close cultural ties between France and Germany. He worked for various journals, including &quot;Révolution nationale&quot; and &quot;le Petit Parisien&quot;. After the liberation of Paris, Brasillach hid in an attic, joking in his diary: &quot;Jews have been living in cupboards for four years, why not imitate them?&quot; He surrendered on 14 September when he heard that his mother had been arrested. He spent the next five months in prison and continued his literary endeavours while incarcerated.

===Trial and execution===
Brasillach was tried in Paris on 19 January 1945. The trial judge had served under Vichy. The prosecutor reiterated Brasillach&#x27;s vehement antisemitism, linked his praise of Germany and denunciation of the Resistance to SS massacres in France and played upon homophobic sentiments by repeatedly drawing the jurors&#x27; attention to the author&#x27;s homosexuality (alleged, but denied by those who knew him best), noting, &quot;inter alia&quot;, that he had slept with the enemy and approved of Germany&#x27;s &quot;penetration&quot; of France. In so doing, the prosecution was making hay with Brasillach&#x27;s own words, as he had suggested, as Liberation approached, that France had slept with Germany and would remember the experience fondly. Brasillach was sentenced to death. Brasillach responded to the outrage of some of his supporters then in attendance by saying &quot;It&#x27;s an honour!&quot;

The death sentence caused an uproar in French literary circles and even some of Brasillach&#x27;s political opponents protested. Resistance member and author François Mauriac, whom Brasillach had savaged in the press, circulated a petition to Charles de Gaulle to commute the sentence. This petition was signed by many of the leading lights of the French literary world, including Paul Valéry, Paul Claudel, Albert Camus, Jean Cocteau, Colette, Arthur Honegger, Jean Anouilh and Thierry Maulnier; others, such as Jean Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir circulated their own counter-petitions. De Gaulle did not comply and Brasillach was executed by firing squad in Montrouge. It has been argued that De Gaulle refused to spare Brasillach because the author had on numerous occasions called for Georges Mandel&#x27;s execution. De Gaulle admired Mandel, a prominent conservative politician (who happened to be Jewish), and who was murdered by the Milice during the closing days of the Occupation. Brasillach called out &quot;But all the same, long live France!&quot; (&quot;Vive la France quand même!&quot;) immediately before his execution. He was buried in the cimetière de Charonne in the 20th Arrondissement of Paris. His brother-in-law, Maurice Bardèche, was later buried next to him.

===Legacy===
Brasillach sought to protect his own legacy as his life drew to a close. He composed several works while awaiting trial and execution, including a collection of verse and a letter to French youth of the future, explaining and justifying his actions (&quot;Lettre à un soldat de la classe de soixante&quot; (Lettre), see below). In &quot;Lettre&quot; he was unrepentant about his fascism, his anti-Semitism or his wartime activity, although he insisted that he had no idea that deported French Jews were being murdered.

Brasillach&#x27;s trial and execution inspired Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s essay &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot;, in which she defended the role of emotion (especially hatred) in politics and the role of revenge in punishment.

His biographer Alice Kaplan noted that his death made him the &quot;James Dean of French fascism&quot; and a martyr to the extreme right. François Truffaut was both aware and appreciative of Brasillach, stating that Brasillach and Pierre Drieu La Rochelle shared similar political beliefs and that &quot;views that earn their advocates the death penalty are bound to be worthy of esteem.&quot;

Dominique Venner&#x27;s &quot;Nouvelle Revue d&#x27;Histoire&quot; has praised the author&#x27;s intellectual oeuvre.

A group called &quot;Association des Amis de Robert Brasillach&quot; celebrates the author&#x27;s work and legacy.

:The book begins with the courtship of Patrice and Catherine, two students, in Paris in the 1920s. At one point the young couple meet two children, who are also called Patrice and Catherine and who claim to be a couple. His studies completed, Patrice leaves to work in Italy, where he becomes enamoured with Italian fascism. Catherine, desiring a more stable relationship, eventually marries a Communist she has met at the office where she works, François. Patrice leaves Italy and serves a five-year stint in the Foreign Legion, where he befriends a young Nazi. After his time in the Legion, Patrice goes to work in Nazi Germany, where he finds Nazi ritual (e.g. Nuremberg rallies, the banners and marches) very engaging. Patrice learns from a friend from his Paris days that François has become a fascist, having turned from both Communism and the Third Republic following the 6 February 1934 crisis in which the extreme right rioted against government &quot;corruption&quot; and perhaps planned to overthrow the state. Ten years after he last saw Catherine, Patrice returns to Paris to visit Catherine and she agrees to go away with him but asks for a few days to collect her thoughts. She decides to stay with François instead, but François misunderstands and believes she has left him. François leaves France without a word and joins the Nationalist cause in the Spanish Civil War, where he has a brief encounter with the Nazi Patrice met in the Foreign Legion. Catherine stays faithful to François, although she meets a young Frenchman who fought for the Republicans in Spain and who turns out to be the young Patrice she had met while he was a child in the 1920s. Meanwhile, the elder Patrice marries a young German woman. The book ends with Catherine on her way to visit François in hospital in Spain after learning that he has been seriously wounded at the front.

:The title of the book stems from the seven styles in which it is written: a narrative of Patrice and Catherine&#x27;s time together in the 1920s; letters exchanged between Patrice and Catherine while Patrice is in Italy; Patrice&#x27;s journal entries while he is in Germany; a series of reflections or maxims, mainly on the process of aging and turning 30; dialogue, in the form of a play, between François and Catherine and Catherine and Patrice in the mid-1930s; a series of &quot;documents&quot; François has put together in a scrap book about the Spanish Civil War; and finally a &quot;speech&quot; (&quot;discours&quot;), in which Catherine describes her thoughts as she travels to meet François in hospital.

:The book is very sympathetic to fascism as a regenerating ideology. However, given his future as a collaborator, readers may be surprised that Communism and socialism are not attacked outright and that the &quot;Patrice&quot; character mentions several times that Nazism may not be as enduring as fascism and that Frenchmen may have to fight the Germans in the future. Also, it is of note that Catherine, who calls herself a &quot;petite bourgeoise&quot; and who exemplifies French rationalism (and perhaps represents France herself) as noted in the dialogue section, chooses François, the French/native fascist and turns away from Patrice, who has immersed himself in Italian and German ideology.

*1943 &quot;La Conquérante&quot; (The Conqueror; gender suggests a female conqueror)

:This short work chronicles the siege of the Alcazar in Toledo by Republican forces in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. While it lionises the defenders, Brasillach does not shy from mentioning the execution of the Republican prisoners in Toledo&#x27;s hospitals after the relief of the city and the Alcazar. The author also discounts certain elements of Nationalist propaganda concerning La Pasionaria, Communist Dolores Ibárruri. The work remains heavily pro-Nationalist, with Falangist and Carlist songs reprinted in its pages.

===Posthumously published works===
*1945 &quot;Poèmes de Fresnes&quot;
*1946 &quot;Lettre à un soldat de la classe 60&quot; (Letter to a Soldier of the Class of 1960).
:In this &#x27;letter&#x27;, written while Brasillach was awaiting trial, the author expressed his thoughts and hopes to a future generation. He argued that he had few regrets about his social and political role in World War II era France. He admitted that certain excesses had occurred under the occupation but contrasted the Germans&#x27; worst crimes against Frenchmen (e.g. the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre) to the well documented atrocities committed by the French in their colonial empire, especially Indochina. He re-iterated his commitment to anti-semitism, although he insisted that he did not know of and entirely repudiated the holocaust despite having advocated the deportations of French Jewry. In the letter Brasillach insists that Franco-German relations would inevitably continue to improve and that the occupation had ultimately brought the two nations closer together. While these statements would have shocked many at the time, when one considers the rapid rapprochement between the two nations post-war, the general idea of Franco-German unity he expressed in some way presages the development of Franco-German cooperation and the pivotal role of the two nations in the European Community/Union, although the causes of this rapprochement may not have been what he foresaw. Brasillach also re-iterated his commitment to fascism and argued that, whether it survived as an ideology or not, the generation of the class of 1960 would doubtless look back on and consider German fascism with a sense of awe. Brasillach also argued that he believed that the spirit of fascism should be mixed with the English sense of liberty and free expression, despite the apparent contradiction in terms.

<doc id="953347" wikidata="Q574910" url="?curid=953347" title="Pink Moon">
<text>Pink Moon is the third and final studio album by the English musician Nick Drake, released in the UK by Island Records on 25 February 1972. It was the only one of Drake&#x27;s studio albums to be released in North America during his lifetime. &quot;Pink Moon&quot; differs from Drake&#x27;s previous albums in that it was recorded without a backing band, featuring just Drake on vocals, acoustic guitar and a single piano melody overdubbed onto the title track.

Released two years before Drake&#x27;s death in November 1974, at the age of twenty-six, the lyrical content of &quot;Pink Moon&quot; has often been attributed to Drake&#x27;s ongoing battle with depression. The songs are shorter than on his previous albums, with a total album running time of just over twenty-eight minutes.

&quot;Pink Moon&quot;, like Drake&#x27;s previous studio albums, did not sell well during his lifetime, and its stripped-back, intimate sound received a mixed response from critics. However, the album has since garnered significant critical acclaim, appearing on a number of best-of lists in the modern era.

==Background==
Nick Drake&#x27;s first two albums with Island Records, &quot;Five Leaves Left&quot; (1969) and &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; (1971), had sold poorly, and, combined with Drake&#x27;s reluctance to perform live or engage in album promotion, Island was not confident of another album from Drake. Additionally, Drake had isolated himself in his London apartment for some time and was suffering from depression. In 1971, he saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed antidepressants, which he was reluctant to take due to the stigma associated with depression at the time and his fears concerning the medication&#x27;s interaction with marijuana, which he smoked regularly.

Although critics often associate Drake&#x27;s music with his depression – especially the perceived melancholy of &quot;Pink Moon&quot; – Cally Callomon of Bryter Music, which manages Drake&#x27;s estate, remembers it differently: &quot;Nick was incapable of writing and recording while he was suffering from periods of depression. He was not depressed during the writing or recording of &quot;Pink Moon&quot; and was immensely proud of the album.&quot;

==Recording==
Drake appeared to have made a decision before recording his third album that it would be as plain as possible and free of the numerous guest musicians that had been employed on &quot;Bryter Layter&quot;. In his autobiography, Joe Boyd, producer of Drake&#x27;s first two albums, remembered that as they were finishing the recording of &quot;Bryter Layter&quot;, Drake had told him that he wanted to make his next record alone. And in his only interview, published in &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine in March 1971, Drake told interviewer Jerry Gilbert that &quot;for the next [album] I had the idea of just doing something with John Wood, the engineer at Sound Techniques&quot;.

After a brief hiatus in Spain spent at a villa belonging to Island Records&#x27; head Chris Blackwell, Drake returned to London refreshed. In October 1971, he approached record engineer and producer John Wood, who had worked with Drake on his previous two albums and who Drake felt was one of the few people he could trust. Wood has worked with other artists such as Fairport Convention, Cat Stevens, and Pink Floyd, and he often worked in partnership with record producer Joe Boyd. Boyd produced Drake&#x27;s first two albums with Wood acting as sound engineer. Although Wood primarily focused on the engineering of an album, he often contributed as a producer.

When Drake reached out to Wood in 1971 expressing his interest in recording another album, the ensuing process was significantly pared down compared to Drake&#x27;s other two albums. The album was recorded at Sound Techniques studio in London in late October 1971 with just Drake and Wood present. With the studio being booked during the day, Drake and Wood arrived at the studio around 11:00 p.m. and simply and quietly recorded half the songs. The next night, they did the same. In only two late night sessions, with just his voice and acoustic guitar, Drake created what is considered by many to be one of the &quot;most influential folk albums of all time&quot;.

Contrary to popular myth that Drake dropped the album off in a plastic bag at Island Records reception and then left without anyone realizing it, Drake delivered the master tapes of &quot;Pink Moon&quot; to Chris Blackwell at Island. In an interview for the Nick Drake fanzine &quot;Pink Moon&quot; in 1996, Island&#x27;s press officer David Sandison recalled that Drake&#x27;s arrival at the record company had certainly not gone unnoticed, although there had been no indication that he was delivering them a new album:

The tapes of the &quot;Pink Moon&quot; session also included Drake&#x27;s recording of &quot;Plaisir d&#x27;amour&quot; (translated from French as &quot;The Pleasure of Love&quot;), a classical French love song written in 1784 by Jean-Paul-Égide Martini. &quot;Plaisir d&#x27;amour&quot; was on the track listing of the &quot;Pink Moon&quot; master tape box as the first track of Side Two when the tapes were presented. However, a note in reference to the song was included which read, &quot;Spare title – Do not use&quot; so the song did not make it onto the album. The recording, less than a minute long and featuring guitar with no vocals, was eventually included as a hidden track on UK editions of the Nick Drake compilation &quot;A Treasury&quot; (2004). Had &quot;Plaisir d&#x27;amour&quot; been included on the &quot;Pink Moon&quot; album, it would have been the only song on any of his albums that Nick Drake did not write himself.

== Artwork ==
Keith Morris was the photographer who took Drake&#x27;s photo for the cover of &quot;Five Leaves Left&quot; and he was commissioned to photograph Drake for the cover of &quot;Pink Moon&quot;. However, the photos were not used as Drake&#x27;s rapidly deteriorating appearance, hunched figure and blank expression were not considered good selling points. Island&#x27;s creative director Annie Sullivan, who oversaw the shoot, recalled the difficulty in making a decision around the cover of the LP: &quot;I remember going to talk to [Nick], and he just sat there, hunched up, and even though he didn&#x27;t speak, I knew the album was called &quot;Pink Moon&quot;, and I can&#x27;t remember how he conveyed it, whether he wrote it down ... he wanted a pink moon. He couldn&#x27;t tell me what he wanted, but I had &#x27;pink moon&#x27; to go on.&quot; Island picked a piece of surrealist Dalí-esque art by Michael Trevithick, who was incidentally a friend of Drake&#x27;s sister Gabrielle. Although Drake was not outspoken in his opinion on the cover art of &quot;Pink Moon&quot;, many close to him felt that he approved.

David Sandison stated that he found the original framed artwork for &quot;Pink Moon&quot; in among the debris of the basement room that Island later allocated to him as his office, and he took it home and hung it on the wall of his house for several years, before eventually presenting it to Drake&#x27;s parents. An undated photo of Drake&#x27;s music room at his parents&#x27; house in Tanworth-in-Arden shows what appears to be the artwork hanging on the wall.

== Critical reception ==
Island Records launched an unusual promotional campaign for the initial release of &quot;Pink Moon&quot;. They spent the entire promotional budget on full-page advertisements in all major music magazines the month of the record&#x27;s release.

&quot;Pink Moon&quot; received more attention from the UK music press than Drake&#x27;s first two albums had, but most critical reviews were still brief.

In 1971, Jerry Gilbert of &quot;Sounds&quot; had conducted the only known interview with Drake. Gilbert had championed Drake up to this point, but expressed his disappointment with &quot;Pink Moon&quot; and his frustration at Drake&#x27;s apparent lack of motivation, saying, &quot;The album consists entirely of Nick&#x27;s guitar, voice and piano and features all the usual characteristics without ever matching up to &quot;Bryter Layter&quot;. One has to accept that Nick&#x27;s songs necessarily require further augmentation, for whilst his own accompaniments are good the songs are not sufficiently strong to stand up without any embroidery at all. &#x27;Things Behind the Sun&#x27; makes it, so does &#x27;Parasite&#x27; – but maybe it&#x27;s time Mr. Drake stopped acting so mysteriously and started getting something properly organised for himself.&quot;

In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Mark Plummer appreciated the music, but was distracted by Drake&#x27;s growing ascetic mythology: &quot;His music is so personal and shyly presented both lyrically and in his confined guitar and piano playing that neither does nor doesn&#x27;t come over ... The more you listen to Drake though, the more compelling his music becomes – but all the time it hides from you. On &#x27;Things Behind the Sun&#x27;, he sings to me, embarrassed and shy. Perhaps one should play his albums with the sound off and just look at the cover and make the music in your head reciting his words from inside the cover to your own rhythmic heart rhymes ... It could be that Nick Drake does not exist at all.&quot;

Referring to Drake&#x27;s recorded output, Fred Dellar noted in &quot;Hi-Fi News &amp; Record Review&quot; that &quot;the LPs hardly sell, thanks partly to Nick&#x27;s reluctance to play promotional concerts and one is left with the feeling that his only ambition is to play the lead in the Howard Hughes story should anyone ever decide to make it as a musical. In the meantime, he employs his deliciously smokey voice in making these intimate, late-night sounds that I find myself playing time and time again.&quot; Duncan Fallowell of &quot;Records and Recording&quot; said that &quot;his songs are infinitely soothing and infinitely similar&quot;, calling the album &quot;even more unassuming than the others&quot;, and stating &quot;Nick Drake will never strike it big. It is not in his nature or in the nature of his music. And that is another good thing too.&quot; In the London edition of &quot;Time Out,&quot; Al Clark observed that Drake &quot;writes striking and evocative songs and always has done, but most of the magic is in the delivery: a smoky, palpitating voice, reminiscent of the jazzier Donovan, gliding wistful words over the chord changes and creating moments of perfect stillness&quot;. Clark stated that &quot;several of the more substantial songs are very lovely&quot;, but concluded presciently, &quot;Sadly, and despite Island&#x27;s efforts to rectify the situation, Nick Drake is likely to remain in the shadows, the private troubadour of those who have been fortunate enough to catch an earful of his exquisite 3am introversions&quot;.

Reviewing the album in the October 1972 issue of &quot;Creem&quot;, Colman Andrews described the songs as &quot;not awfully good&quot; and &quot;weak&quot;, and that the music was &quot;a triumph of style over sententiousness, of sound over sense&quot; with &quot;a lulling repetitiousness to a lot of what he sings&quot;, but that this was the point: &quot;he knows precisely what emotional limits to impose upon his self-accompaniment. It&#x27;s seductive music.&quot;

By the time of the album&#x27;s reissues on compact disc in the 1990s and 2000s, Drake&#x27;s fame and critical standing had improved considerably, and legacy reviews of the album were overwhelmingly favourable.

Martin Aston of &quot;Q&quot; noted in 1990 that &quot;the mood is even more remote [than Drake&#x27;s first two albums] with – finally – a defeated strain in both throat and words, but several of his most elegant melodies&quot;.

John Harris&#x27;s review of the 2000 reissue in the same magazine was more positive still, claiming that &quot;many hold up &quot;Pink Moon&quot; as Nick Drake&#x27;s best album&quot; and saying, &quot;The motivation of success had evaporated and Drake made a record so singular and uncompromising that, superficially, it beggars belief ... The truth is that &quot;Pink Moon&quot;″s excellence shines through, irrespective of the endless speculation [regarding Drake&#x27;s state of mind during the making of the record and subsequent death]. Few records have ever sounded so intimate, or embodied the eternal human ailment known as Melancholy with such grace and assurance.&quot;

In &quot;Mojo&quot;, Rob Chapman claimed that &quot;&quot;Pink Moon&quot; is his masterpiece and the Robert Johnson comparisons are fully deserved&quot;.

Critic and author Ian MacDonald, a contemporary of Drake&#x27;s at Cambridge University, stated in &quot;Uncut&quot; that &quot;what remains clear is that this is one of the premium singer-songwriter albums, nearly every one of its 11 tracks a timeless classic&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Anthony DeCurtis observed that &quot;by the time of these sessions, Drake had retreated so deeply into his own internal world that it is difficult to say what the songs are &#x27;about&#x27;. His lyrics are so compressed as to be kind of folkloric haikus, almost childishly simple in their structure and elemental in their imagery. His voice conveys, in its moans and breathy whispers, an alluring sensuality, but he sings as if he were viewing his life from a great, unbridgeable distance. That element of detachment is chilling. To reinforce it, messages of isolation gradually float to the surface of the songs&#x27; spare, eloquent melodies.&quot;

Three years later in the same magazine, James Hunter said of the 2003 North American reissue &quot;The album unleashes a dramatic starkness and some breathtakingly pretty music&quot;.

AllMusic&#x27;s Ned Raggett wrote in his retrospective review that &quot;&quot;Pink Moon&quot; more than anything else is the record that made Drake the cult figure he remains. Specifically, &quot;Pink Moon&quot; is the bleakest of [all his records]; that the likes of Belle and Sebastian are fans of Drake may be clear enough, but it&#x27;s doubtful they could ever achieve the calm, focused anguish of this album, as harrowing as it is attractive ... Drake&#x27;s elegant melancholia avoiding sounding pretentious in the least thanks to his continued embrace of simple, tender vocalizing. Meanwhile, the sheer majesty of his guitar playing – consider the opening notes of &#x27;Road&#x27; or &#x27;Parasite&#x27; – makes for a breathless wonder to behold.&quot;

Reviewing &quot;Pink Moon&quot; as part of the 2014 box set &quot;Tuck Box&quot;, Jayson Greene of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted, &quot;A &#x27;pink moon&#x27; is a baleful symbol, a sign of impending death or calamity ... On paper, this sentiment reads like vindictive rage, but on record, it sounds contemplative. Drake&#x27;s voice never conveyed palpable anger or sadness; he had a slight, gentle voice and upper-class accent, the product of his upbringing, clipped and clean, and his guitar, as always, rang out with a crystalline purity. His music is so consoling that the darkness at its heart is not always accessible. It&#x27;s almost impossible to hear the emotional abandon in &quot;Pink Moon&quot;, then, without the taste of his first two albums lingering on your mouth. It&#x27;s only then that the bone-dry resonance of the guitars registers as slightly alarming, and the backdrop of silence suggests both the purity of Drake&#x27;s vision and also something darker: like someone who has dropped out of the world, mumbling prophecies ... There is a stillness to Nick Drake&#x27;s music that bewitches anyone who gets near enough, and &quot;Pink Moon&quot; is its purest expression. It remains the Nick Drake record most people begin with, and for good reason.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Pink Moon&quot; was voted number 131 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 2003, the album was ranked number 320 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2012, that ranking was revised to number 321, and in 2020 was revised to number 201.

In the UK, &quot;Pink Moon&quot; was placed at number 48 in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s 2000 list of the best albums of all time, and at number 126 in &quot;Uncut&quot;″s 200 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2016.

== Legacy ==
The first notable cover versions of Nick Drake songs were released in 1992 when Lucinda Williams covered &quot;Which Will&quot; on her album &quot;Sweet Old World&quot; and alternative rock band Sebadoh covered &quot;Pink Moon&quot; on their EP &quot;Sebadoh vs Helmet&quot;. By 2006, Beck recorded covers of the album&#x27;s songs for online-only release, including &quot;Which Will&quot; and &quot;Parasite.&quot;

===1999 Volkswagen Cabriolet advertisement===

On 11 November 1999, Volkswagen debuted a television advertising campaign named &quot;Milky Way&quot; that featured the Volkswagen Cabriolet with the title track of &quot;Pink Moon&quot; as the soundtrack.

Ron Lawner, Chief Creative Officer of Arnold Communications stated in the press release, &quot;The song is very special. It&#x27;s an old song by a guy named Nick Drake. It&#x27;s called &#x27;Pink Moon&#x27; and is actually a very good introduction to Nick Drake if you&#x27;re not familiar with him. It&#x27;s very transporting. And to us seemed very fitting for a beautiful drive in the country on a very special night.&quot;

The Volkswagen Cabriolet commercial, directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and filmed by Lance Acord, led to a large increase in record sales
and a number-five placing for &quot;Pink Moon&quot; in Amazon&#x27;s sales chart. 

Bethany Klein, a professor in the Department of Media and Communication at the University of Central England states, &quot;The role of &#x27;Pink Moon&#x27; in the success of &quot;Milky Way&quot; was interesting, in that it both added to the artistry of the commercial and was also protected by the visual artistry of the spot: because the ad &#x27;worked&#x27; (it was an aesthetic success) the usual negative discourse surrounding the use of popular music in advertising was, if not stopped, at least reduced and accompanied by positive appraisals ... The linking together of the ad being a &#x27;watershed&#x27; and being &#x27;nicely done&#x27; is no coincidence; it is because the ad is so well executed and so aesthetically successful that the industry and the public reassessed the use of music in advertising around this example.&quot; In 2001, Volkswagen gave all new Volkswagen Cabrio buyers a compilation CD which featured &quot;Pink Moon&quot; as the first track.

American sales of Nick Drake&#x27;s &quot;Pink Moon&quot; album rose from 6,000 copies, prior to the song&#x27;s use in the Cabrio commercial, to 74,000 copies in 2000. As of 2004 it had sold 329,000 copies in the United States.

<doc id="953369" wikidata="Q44415" url="?curid=953369" title="Virtual image">
<text>In optics, the &quot;image&quot; of an object is defined as the collection of focus points of light rays coming from the object. A &quot;real image&quot; is the collection of focus points made by converging rays, while a virtual image is the collection of focus points made by backward extensions of diverging rays. In other words, a virtual image is found by tracing real rays that emerge from an optical device (lens, mirror, or some combination) backward to perceived or apparent origins of ray divergences.

There is a concept &quot;virtual object&quot; that is similarly defined; an object is virtual when forward extensions of rays converge toward it. This is observed in ray tracing for a multi-lenses system or a diverging lens. For the diverging lens, forward extension of converging rays toward the lens will meet the converging point, so the point is a virtual object. 

For a (refracting) lens, the real image of an object is formed on the opposite side of the lens while the virtual image is formed on the same side as the object. For a (reflecting) mirror, the real image is on the same side as the object while the virtual image is on the opposite side of, or &quot;behind&quot;, the mirror. In diagrams of optical systems, virtual rays (forming virtual images) are conventionally represented by dotted lines, to contrast with the solid lines of real rays.

Because the rays never really converge, a virtual image cannot be projected onto a screen by putting it at the location of the virtual image. In contrast, a real image can be projected on the screen as it is formed by rays that converge on a real location. A real image can be projected onto a diffusely reflecting screen so people can see the image (the image on the screen plays as an object to be imaged by human eyes).

* A plane mirror forms a virtual image positioned behind the mirror. Although the rays of light seem to come from behind the mirror, light from the source only exists in front of the mirror. The image in a plane mirror is not magnified (that is, the image is the same size as the object) and appears to be as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror.
* A diverging lens (one that is thicker at the edges than the middle) or a concave mirror forms a virtual image. Such an image is reduced in size when compared to the original object. A converging lens (one that is thicker in the middle than at the edges) or a convex mirror is also capable of producing a virtual image if the object is within the focal length. Such an image will be magnified. In contrast, an object placed in front of a converging lens or concave mirror at a position beyond the focal length produces a real image. Such an image will be magnified if the position of the object is within twice the focal length, or else the image will be reduced if the object is further than this distance.

<doc id="953371" wikidata="Q521799" url="?curid=953371" title="Battle of the Neva">
<text>The Battle of the Neva (; ; ) was fought between the Novgorod Republic, along with Karelians, and the Kingdom of Sweden, including Norwegian, Finnish and Tavastian forces, on the Neva River, near the settlement of Ust-Izhora, on 15 July 1240. The battle is mentioned only in Russian sources, and it remains unclear whether it was a major invasion or a small-scale raid. In Russian historiography, it has become an event of massive scale and importance.

==Background==
Pope Honorius III (1216–1227) received a number of petitions regarding new Baltic crusades, mainly concerning Prussia and Livonia but also a report from the Swedish Archbishop concerning difficulties with their mission in Finland. At that time, Honorius responded to the Swedish archbishop only by declaring an embargo against trade with pagans in the region; it is not known if the Swedes requested further help for the moment.

In 1237, the Swedes received papal authorization to launch a crusade, and in 1240, new campaigns began in the easternmost part of the Baltic region. The Finnish mission&#x27;s eastward expansion led to a clash between Sweden and Novgorod, since the Karelians had been allies and tributaries of Novgorod since the mid-12th century. After a successful campaign into Tavastia, the Swedes advanced further east until they were stopped by a Novgorodian army led by Prince Alexander Yaroslavich. Novgorod fought against the crusade for economic reasons, to protect their monopoly of the Karelian fur trade.

== Russian sources ==
The existence of the battle is known only from Russian sources. The first source to mention the battle is the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; from the 14th century. According to the chronicle, on receiving the news of the advancing Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish and Tavastian fleets, the 20-year-old Prince Alexander Yaroslavich of Novgorod quickly moved his small army and local men to face the enemy before they had reached Lake Ladoga. The chronicle described the battle as follows:
&quot;Swedes came with a great army, and Norwegians and Finns and Tavastians with ships in great numbers, Swedes with their prince and bishops, and they stayed on the Neva, at the mouth of the Izhora, willing to take Ladoga, and then Novgorod and all of its lands. But still protected the merciful, man-loving God us and sheltered us from the foreign people, and the word came to Novgorod that Swedes were sailing to Ladoga; but prince Alexander did not hesitate at all, but went against them with Novgorodians and people of Ladoga and overcame them with the help of Saint Sophia and through prayers of our lady, the Mother of God and Virgin Mary, 15 July, in the memory of Kirik and Ulita, on Sunday, (the same day that) the 630 holy fathers held a meeting in Chalcedon; and there was a great gathering of the Swedes; and their leader called Spiridon was killed there; but some claimed that even the bishop was slain; and a great number of them fell; and when they had loaded two ships with the bodies of high-born men, they let them sail to the sea; but the others, that were unnumbered, they cast to a pit, that they buried, and many others were wounded; and that same night they fled, without waiting for the Monday light, with shame. Of Novgorodians there fell: Konstantin Lugotinitch, Gyuryata Pinyashchinich, Namest, Drochilo Nezdylov son of the tanner, but including the people of Ladoga 20 men or less, God knows. But prince Alexander came back home with Novgorodians and people of Ladoga, all well, protected by God and Saint Sophia and all the prayers of the holy men.&quot;

A 16th-century version of the battle gave plenty of additional details, expanding the conflict to biblical proportions, but otherwise following the earlier described developments.

Prince Alexander Yaroslavich was nicknamed &quot;Nevsky&quot; (of Neva) after his first significant victory. Two years later Alexander stalled an invasion of the Livonian Knights during the Battle on the Ice. Despite the victories there were no Novgorodian advances further west to Finland or Estonia.

== Swedish sources ==
There is no reference to a battle of the Neva in Swedish sources.

=== Situation in Sweden ===

After the death of King John in 1222, Sweden was in a &quot;de facto&quot; state of civil war until 1248 when Birger Jarl managed to seize power in the kingdom. Unrest was due to the struggle between those who wanted to keep the old tribal structure, the folkung party, and the king, who was assisted by the church. Folkungs, who were mainly from Uppland, stoutly resisted the centralization of power, taxation of the Swedes of Uppland, and church privileges. They had temporarily succeeded in deposing the king in 1229, but were forced to give in five years later, but were far from defeated yet. Uppland remained largely independent of the king, and its northern areas continued to be in folkung hands. An uneasy truce continued until 1247, when the folkung rebellion was put to an end at the Battle of Sparrsätra and its leader beheaded a year later.
Furthermore, the official Sweden was on the brink of war with Norway ever since the Norwegians&#x27; infamous Värmland expedition in 1225. Relations improved only after the Treaty of Lödöse in 1249, which was forged by the newly empowered Birger Jarl. Before the treaty, Norway remained an ally of the folkungs, giving them refuge and providing men and arms.

In this situation, it seems unlikely that Sweden could have been able to organize a major expedition against Novgorod. Swedes are not known to have carried out any other military campaigns between 1222 and 1249, making the claims about their forceful appearance at the Neva with Norwegians as their allies seem questionable.

=== Theories ===
Taking these facts into consideration, it has been suggested in a recent book aimed at a wide readership, that the Swedish expedition may have been an indirect result of the papal letter in 1237 that was sent to the Swedish Archbishop of Uppsala. The letter eloquently called for a crusade, not against Novgorod, but against Tavastians in Finland, who had allegedly started hostilities against the church. In his defunct position, the king may not have been willing or able to act, but the letter may have provided the frustrated folkungs an opportunity to regain part of their Viking Age glory. Mostly free to act without interference from the king, folkungs would have been able to raise an army of their own, get volunteers from Norway and even assistance from Thomas, the independent Bishop of Finland, who needed to constantly worry about attacks from the east. Instead of Tavastia, this mixed set of interests and nationalities would have headed for the more lucrative Neva and there met its fate at the hands of Alexander. In the possible aftermath of the said battle, the King of Norway approached his Swedish counterpart for peace talks in 1241, but was turned down at the time.

However, some recent research has fundamentally questioned the importance of the battle, seeing it as an ordinary border skirmish that was exaggerated for political purposes, thus also explaining its absence from Swedish and other western sources.

Additional theories are numerous. Some historians have suggested that the Swedish army was already under the command of the very young Birger Jarl, eight years before his appointment to the position of jarl. It has also been suggested that the suspicious information on Norwegians&#x27;, Finns&#x27; and Tavastians&#x27; participation was made up in the 14th century, the time of writing of the First Novgorod Chronicle, when Sweden was in control of Norway, Finland and Tavastia.

=== Consequences ===
All in all, the first known Swedish military expedition against Novgorod after the events at the Neva took place in 1256, following folkungs&#x27; demise, peace with Norway and conquest of Finland. If the battle of the Neva had any long-term consequences, it was in Sweden&#x27;s determination to take over Finland first before attempting to proceed further east.

== Legacy ==
In 2007, scholar Janet L. B. Martin wrote: &quot;Novgorod and Sweden were competitors both for dominance over Finnic tribes north of the Novgorod lands and for control over access to the Gulf of Finland. The Swedish attack on the Neva River in July 1240 was one of a long series of hostile encounters over these issues, not, as is sometimes asserted, a full-scale campaign timed to take advantage of the Russians&#x27; adversity and aimed at conquering the entire Novgorodian realm. Nevertheless, Alexander&#x27;s victory there was celebrated and became the basis for his epithet Nevsky.&quot;

<doc id="953383" wikidata="Q7767101" url="?curid=953383" title="The Student (newspaper)">
<text>The Student is a fortnightly independent newspaper produced by students at the University of Edinburgh. First started in 1887, the newspaper is distributed on Wednesdays and usually consists of 32 pages. It has a physical circulation of 2,500 copies per issue and is read by some 30,000 people in Edinburgh, .

Since 1992, &quot;The Student&quot; has become financially and editorially independent from the University of Edinburgh and its students&#x27; association. It therefore relies on advertising and fundraising to cover costs. The newspaper is produced by volunteers, who fit this work around their studies. 

The newspaper held the title of &quot;Best Student Newspaper in Scotland&quot;awarded by &quot;The Herald&quot; Student Press Awardsin 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010. It also won the Student Publication Association&#x27;s &quot;Best Publication Award&quot; in 2024.

== History ==

&quot;The Student&quot; started in 1887 as a small fortnightly magazine, founded by Robert Cochrane Buist. In 1889 the Students&#x27; Representative Council took over publishing the paper from Buist. &quot;The Student&quot; states that it was founded by Robert Louis Stevenson. A typical, turn-of-the-century edition of &quot;The Student&quot; would open with a short biography of a notable person and an editorial. The remaining content largely comprised notes from various societies, sports results, poetry and literary reviews, and profiles of newly appointed lecturers. The magazine was supported by advertising, but cost two pence.

By the 1970s, &quot;The Student&quot; had become a weekly newspaper, roughly Berliner in format. The running of the newspaper wasby this stagein the control of the Student Publications Board, a body independent of the university. It was during the first half of the 1970s that Gordon Brown, future British prime minister, was a news editor. The type of content had shifted to reflect the times: a typical copy would contain pages on news, the environment, society, features, politics and entertainment. By this point, the price had risen to five pence.

The 1990s saw the introduction of computers to the newspaper; the offices were also moved from the Student Publications Board offices at 1 Buccleuch Place to their present location in the Pleasance, anecdotally held to be space reclaimed after the closure of a monkey-testing lab. Initially, the newspaper was laid out on Apple Macintosh computers. During this period, Darius Danesh briefly wrote for the paper, as a film and music critic.

The paper, then in tabloid format, won &quot;The Herald&quot; Student Media Award for best newspaper in 1998, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010 and the &quot;Guardian&quot; Student Media Awards for &quot;Best Newspaper on a Shoestring&quot; in 2001. The paper was redesigned several times in the lead-up to the millennium, winning &quot;The Herald&quot; award for its design in 2004. After failing to win the same award the following year, the paper was again radically redesigned in 2006.

Many of &quot;The Student&quot;&#x27;s former writers have gone on to become internationally renowned journalists and politicians. Past staff members of &quot;The Student&quot; include the former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown; Lord Steel; Robin Cook; and many of Fleet Street&#x27;s reporters and editors. Recent graduates include &quot;Guardian&quot; staff writer and editor Helen Pidd and BBC radio reporter Chris Page.

=== Financial issues ===
In 1992, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Student&quot;, which had been selling for 20 pence, was dropped by the students&#x27; association as part of a cost-cutting exercise. A grant of £5,000 from the University Development Fund allowed it to continue as a student society for a few years. By 1997, the newspaper was under severe financial pressure, selling only around a thousand copies a week at 20 pence each; the advertising was largely ineffective. During the course of the year, the newspaper stopped publishing to avoid going into debt and a relaunch was scheduled for the start of the autumn term, with a shift towards a free distribution model. This shift resulted in a wholesale change in how the newspaper was produced. For the first time, the newspaper was printed on a web offset press; full colour printing was available; and the newspaper was fully produced on computers, not old fashioned light boxes. The initial circulation after the relaunch was around 5,000 copies, distributed through cardboard stands around the various university campuses. To ease the transition, the newspaper was published on a fortnightly basis for a year. After a successful advertising funded first year the newspaper returned to being published weekly and within two years the circulation crept up to over 12,000 copies a week, aided by initiatives such as a second edition catering to the other universities within Edinburgh and a seven-day TV guide.

In early 2002, &quot;The Student&quot;&#x27;s continuous run came to an end when the newspaper faced &quot;five-figure debts&quot;. The official explanation was that the post-11 September 2001 climate had caused a downturn in advertising, something being widely claimed by other newspapers at the time. The newspaper was relaunched at the start of the 2002/03 academic year and advertising sales, which had been traditionally managed internally, began to be handled by the advertising department of the Students&#x27; Association, though the paper&#x27;s committee now includes a Head of Advertising. The paper recovered quickly, returning to weekly publication with a redesign soon after the start of the next academic year.

In 2023, the students&#x27; association withdrew from its role as a major advertiser, putting the continuation of the print edition at risk. An online fundraiser raised over £4,500, enabling the print edition of 750 copies fortnightly to be continued.

== Notable pieces ==

=== &#x27;Page Three&#x27; feature ===
In early 2005, &quot;The Student&quot; published an editorial discussing &quot;Page 3&quot; models and nudity in the media, accompanied by two full-page, scantily-clad glamour model photographs: one of a male, the other of a female. The newspaper subsequently received a complaint from the Edinburgh University Islamic Society (ISocEd). The &quot;Edinburgh Evening News&quot; took up the story, which subsequently appeared in the national press, with the photograph of the female model appearing next to the story.

Newspapers claimed there had been &quot;floods of complaints&quot; and that the female model was in hiding. Catherine Harper of the &#x27;Scottish Women Against Pornography&#x27; organisation said, &quot;[this] will lead students to only view women as a pair of breasts.&quot; However, &quot;The Sun&quot; defended the publication of a page similar to its own, and offered the model a place in its paper.

=== &#x27;Pure&#x27; controversy ===
In November 2006, &quot;The Student&quot; ran a series of front pages drawing readers&#x27; attention to the university&#x27;s Christian Union, which was running a &#x27;Pure&#x27; course which allegedly taught that homosexuality was a &#x27;curable condition&#x27;. &quot;The Student&quot; complained that the course was being taught on university premises, at the Chaplaincy Centre, and that this breached the university&#x27;s anti-discrimination policy. The course was subsequently banned temporarily, amid threats of litigation.

=== JK Rowling interview ===

In early March 2008, &quot;The Student&quot; published an interview with JK Rowling, author of the best-selling &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. Rowling told &quot;The Student&quot; journalist Adeel Amini that she had considered suicide during her mid-20s but that she had overcome depression through counselling. On 23 March, newspapers from around the world, including &quot;USA Today&quot;, the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot;, and several major Indian newspapers published the excerpt from Amini&#x27;s interview.

=== Princess Anne controversies ===
In October 2011, &quot;The Student&quot; covered the appointment and inauguration of Princess Anne as chancellor of the University of Edinburgh, running the headline &#x27;A Fucking Disgrace&#x27;, a quote from a student onlooker for related protests. The university&#x27;s administration banned the particular copy of &quot;The Student&quot; from distribution in academic buildings, citing offence caused to their staff members as the reason.

In October 2013, &quot;The Student&quot; released a story stating that two students had been removed from campus buildings and detained by royal protection officers ahead of a visit from Princess Anne, with one of the students alleging xenophobic abuse from university security guards. The story was picked up by &quot;The Independent&quot; and other mastheads.

=== EUSA censorship dispute ===

In January and February 2013, the Edinburgh University Students&#x27; Association took out an interdict against &quot;The Student&quot; to stop them publishing a story rumoured to be related to Max Crema, an EUSA sabbatical officer.

On 26 February, ex-Features editor of &quot;The Student&quot;, Cameron Taylor submitted two motions to EUSA, one a vote of no confidence against Max Crema and the other, a motion to censure James McAsh (President of EUSA). After a comment piece published in the Student explaining his actions, it was revealed that he had been behind the anonymous Facebook page and blog &#x27;Are you happy with EUSA?&#x27;. An Emergency Special General Meeting was called for 6.30pm on Wednesday 6 March in George Square Lecture Theatre, to debate the two motions. &quot;The Student&quot; published an story in which editors Alistair Grant and Nina Seale interviewed both James McAsh and Max Crema about the actions they were being held accountable for. On 1 March, student John Wallace submitted another motion to hold a vote of no confidence against James McAsh. Both motions fell substantially short of the two-thirds majority required.

=== Esme Allman–Robbie Travers controversy ===

In September 2017, &quot;The Student&quot; released two interviewsone with former Edinburgh University Students&#x27; Association Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) Convenor Esme Allman, and the other with law student Robbie Travers, against whom Allman had filed a complaint. The paper dismissed earlier assertions in the national media that Travers had been investigated by Edinburgh University for &#x27;mocking ISIS&#x27;. The SPA-award-winning interviews were subsequently picked up by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and other newspapers. Author JK Rowling commented on the controversy on her Twitter account.

=== &#x27;The Tab&#x27; Controversy ===
In November 2024, &quot;The Student&quot; released a features article discussing the scandal with the popular social media brand &#x27;The Tab&#x27; and their negative comments on Scottish students such as &quot;just as god intended&quot; when someone stated that they had interviewed no Scottish people in one particular video. However, the article produced by the newspaper did not state which social media brand was involved, with anonymous writers stating they were silenced by the University of Edinburgh and were not allowed to write about the topic in full detail due to &quot;bullying&quot; concerns. The story was consequently picked up by &quot;The BBC&quot; and other newspapers, and resulted in the university publishing a guide instructing students on how to behave; described as a guide on &quot;how not to be a snob&quot;.

<doc id="953387" wikidata="Q183170" url="?curid=953387" title="University of Texas at San Antonio">
<text>The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is a public research university in San Antonio, Texas, United States. Established in 1969, UTSA is the largest university in San Antonio and the eighth-largest by enrollment in the state of Texas enrolling over 35,000 students across its five campuses spanning more than 758 acres. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity&quot;. The UTSA Institute for Economic Development generates $2.6 billion in direct economic impact.

Student-athletes compete as The UTSA Roadrunners and are a member of The American Athletic Conference (AAC). The football team, which was founded in 2009, previously competed in Conference USA, the WAC and as an FCS independent.

==History==
===Establishment (1969 to 1970s)===
The University of Texas at San Antonio was officially founded on June 5, 1969, by the 61st Texas Legislature as H.B. 42 and signed into law by Governor Preston Smith. Frank Lombardino, a conservative Democrat who represented northwest Bexar County in the state legislature, was known as the &quot;father of UTSA&quot; due to his impassioned advocacy for the institution. When Governor Smith signed the bill officially establishing the university, he did so on the back of Lombardino in a ceremony in front of the Alamo. At the university&#x27;s inaugural commencement, the first diploma was also signed on Lombardino&#x27;s back.

In 1970, the University of Texas Board of Regents appointed the university&#x27;s first president, Arleigh B. Templeton, who served from 1970 to 1972, and received a land donation of in far northwest San Antonio for the site of UTSA. The architecture firm of Ford, Powell and Carson Inc. was assigned to develop a master plan for the university. O&#x27;Neil Ford, the designer of both the Tower of the Americas and the Trinity University tower, designed the campus to be reminiscent of an Italian village.

The 671 graduate students composing the first class at the university were admitted in September 1973. Upperclassmen and lowerclassmen were admitted in 1975 and 1976, respectively. Students temporarily attended class at the Koger Center, which also housed administrative offices until 1975, when construction on the Main Campus was completed. Enrollment during this time numbered 4,433 students. UTSA began with five colleges: Business, Fine and Applied Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, Multidisciplinary Studies and Science and Mathematics.

By 1975, the university&#x27;s future colors were being openly discussed among student leaders and the administration. UTSA&#x27;s third color of blue was selected, beating out other proposed colors such as &quot;fiesta red&quot; and &quot;cactus green&quot;. The John Peace Library opened the next year, serving as the new administrative headquarters for the university.

The discussion of a university mascot soon followed the selection of school colors. In the fall of 1977, an election was held to determine the school&#x27;s mascot, with &quot;the armadillos&quot; and &quot;the stars&quot; taking the top two spots. However, the referendum was declared void by the student government and a new election was held with nine candidates and a write-in option. The top two choices from the second election, the roadrunner and the armadillo, campaigned in a competitive run-off. On December 9, 1977, the roadrunner was announced as UTSA&#x27;s first and only mascot.

James W. Wagener, a graduate of Southern Methodist University and former acting dean of the University of Texas Health Science Center, was selected to be UTSA&#x27;s third president in 1978. The Alumni Association was formed that same year, providing a new avenue of support for the university. The first Fiesta UTSA was also held in April 1978, with multiple bands playing throughout the day and culminating in a school dance. At the end of the 1970s, enrollment numbered 9,400 undergraduate and graduate students.

=== Early years (1980s to 1999) ===
 &quot;The Paisano&quot;, was established in 1981 as the first independent student publication in the state. During the fall of that year, the university began playing collegiate athletics. It was immediately elected to Division I status in the NCAA. The Student Representative Assembly headed the burial of a time capsule in 1983, the university&#x27;s 10th anniversary, instructing it to be opened on June 5, 2023.

In 1986, UTSA acquired the Institute of Texan Cultures, a center for multicultural education in the state, as a campus. During this year, both the University Center and Chisholm Hall, the university&#x27;s first on-campus housing complex, opened.

In 1994 the U.S. Department of Education designated UTSA as a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).

On the first day of fall classes in 1996, a campus shooter stormed into the John Peace Library. The perpetrator, Gregory Tidwell, murdered head of cataloging Stephen L. Sorensen before fatally shooting himself in the chest.

The University Center expanded in the late 1990s, breaking ground in 1995 on the 97,500-square foot, $13.2 million building, dubbed &quot;UC Phase II&quot;, which included the new Retama Auditorium and UTSA Bookstore. The Downtown Campus opened the doors to its permanent location on Interstate Highway 10 and Cesar Chavez Blvd. (then Durango Blvd.) in 1997.

Ricardo Romo, a graduate of The University of Texas at Austin and UCLA, became UTSA&#x27;s fifth president in May 1999. He began with the ambitious agenda of aggressively expanding UTSA, both physically and academically, laying out the university&#x27;s &quot;Roadmap to Excellence&quot;. During his tenure, UTSA would grow 68% in student enrollment while adding new programs and facilities.

=== Expansion and growth (2000 to 2009) ===

In the mid-2000s decade, UTSA embarked on a long-term campaign to dramatically increase its national prestige and selectivity. A &quot;Master Plan&quot; was created in 2007 as a guide for this campaign and to direct the future physical growth of the institution. The &quot;UTSA 2016&quot; strategic plan, formulated at the same time, is guided by the Master Plan and forms the basis for the development of the university into a &quot;premier research institution&quot; by 2016. John T. Montford—a San Antonio businessman, former chancellor of the Texas Tech University System, and a member of the Texas State Senate from 1983 to 1996—eventually established the UTSA presidents Dinner and, in 2007, the event raised US$4.6 million.

From 2006 to 2009, UTSA completed over $250 million in construction projects. The $84 million five-story Biotechnology, Sciences and Engineering (BSE) Building opened its doors in 2006. The university underwent extensive remodeling in 2009, renovating older buildings such as the John Peace Library (JPL), the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS, now known as the McKinney Humanities or MH) and the Multidisciplinary Studies (MS) buildings. A new ceramics studio broke ground in 2009 and two adjacent science buildings underwent $24 million in renovations. The $83 million Applied Engineering and Technology building (AET) also opened its doors in 2009. A year later the AET Library opened as the nation&#x27;s first completely bookless library on a college or university campus.

Proposition 4 was passed by Texas voters in November 2009. This piece of legislation named 7 emerging research universities in Texas, UTSA being one, that could compete for additional state funds in an effort to increase the number of Tier One institutions in Texas. Factors such as research expenditures, graduate degrees awarded and scholarly productivity all play a part in which schools receive the most funding.

=== Further expansion (2010 to 2020) ===

The first-time undergraduate acceptance rate, a common measurement for institutional selectivity, was 60% for the Fall of 2013. U.S. News &amp; World Report ranks UTSA&#x27;s admissions process as &quot;selective&quot;. In 2010, the university hit a population benchmark of 30,000 students, signifying a growth rate of more than 39% over the past decade. UTSA was one of the fastest growing universities in Texas during this decade reaching nearly 31,000 students by 2012.

However, in 2011, the Center for College Affordability and Productivity ranked UTSA&#x27;s freshman as the second most &quot;unhappy&quot; in the country, based solely on low retention rates. The Associate Vice President refuted this claim and members of Student Government Association sponsored a resolution rebuking the claims, pointing out the Coordinated Admissions Program skews freshmen retention rates.

The North Paseo Building, a $15 million office building, began housing ROTC operations when it opened in October 2011. The Bauerle Road Garage, a 5-level parking facility with office space, opened in 2012. Dining services also expanded in 2008, continuing through 2011.

That same year, the university also fielded its long-anticipated football team as an NCAA FCS independent, with Larry Coker as the inaugural head coach. The following year, 2012, UTSA, the city&#x27;s sole NCAA Division I university at the time, became a member of the Western Athletic Conference; one year later, it moved to Conference USA. An athletic complex was constructed slightly west of the main campus and features pedestrian-friendly mixed-use areas. The complex, dubbed &quot;Park West&quot;, adds another 125 acres to the university&#x27;s property.

In 2014 the &quot;New&quot; North Paseo building (NPB) was completed and now houses Computer Science and Cyber Security labs and classrooms. The NPB is also home to the Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security (CIAS), Center for Education and Research in Information and Infrastructure Security (CERIIS), and the Institute for Cyber Security.

Ricardo Romo, who had served as president since 1999, resigned on March 3, 2017, after having been placed on administrative leave. Pedro Reyes served as interim president from February through August 2017. On September 1, 2017, Thomas Taylor Eighmy, the vice chancellor for research and engagement at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, began serving as UTSA&#x27;s sixth president.

On June 9, 2017, UTSA introduced the largest construction project in its history with the announcement of a $95 million science and engineering building which opened in fall 2020. On September 6, 2018, UTSA announced it had received a $15 million gift from San Antonio business leader Graham Weston and $70 million commitment from The University of Texas System Board of Regents for construction of two new facilities at its Downtown Campus for a National Security Collaboration Center and a proposed School of Data Science which opened January 9, 2023 and became the first and only Data Science school in the state of Texas.

In November 2018, a video emerged of an incident involving a student being escorted out of a lecture hall by campus police after refusing to comply with the professor&#x27;s request that she not place her feet on the seat in front of her. An investigation found no evidence of racial bias in the incident, but the professor was suspended again in 2019 following another classroom management issue. A petition signed by over 900 students called for her reinstatement, stating she had been &quot;ousted unfairly&quot;, but ultimately she was not asked to return to UTSA.

=== Modern university (2021–present) ===
In 2021, the College of Engineering and College of Architecture, Construction and Planning were merged to form the new College of Engineering and IntegratedDesign (CEID), officially launched on September 1, 2021. UTSA also acquired the Southwest School of Art which became part of a new school within UTSA&#x27;s College of Liberal and Fine Arts.

Toward the end of 2021, UTSA attained Carnegie Tier One research status. The university also announced a partnership with UTHSCSA to create a new School of Public Health. The first MPH students were admitted in 2024 and Vasan Ramachandran was hired as dean of the new school.

In September 2023, UTSA introduced a dual degree combining medicine and artificial intelligence. Medical students spend four years at the UT Health SA Long School of Medicine and one year at UTSA. Upon completion graduates earn a doctor of medicine (M.D.) and a masters of science degree in artificial intelligence. In January 2024, UTSA announced the creation of a new college centered on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and computer and data science.

In August 2024, the University of Texas Board of Regents announced that UTSA and UT Health Science Center at San Antonio would be merging to form a &quot;world class university in San Antonio.&quot; The merged universities will retain the UTSA name with current UTSA president Taylor Eighmy leading the new combined institution.

==Campuses==
=== Main Campus ===

The Main Campus, the original and largest, was born out of a 600-acre donation to the University of Texas Board of Regents. It proved to be so controversially remote to the city (at the time) that many San Antonians nicknamed it &quot;University of Texas at Boerne&quot; or &quot;UT Boerne&quot;. The Main Campus opened its doors in 1975. Prior to that, classes were held at the Koger Center at Babcock Road and Loop 410. Roadrunner Cafe, the university&#x27;s first dining hall, was erected in 2005. In 2006, UTSA acquired a 125-acre swath of land on Hausman Road to build its future athletics complex, bringing the Main Campus up to 725 acres in total. Up until 2009, it was known as the &quot;1604 Campus&quot;, at which point it was renamed the &quot;Main Campus&quot; so as to better reflect its importance within the university and community as a whole. Students have the choice to live at one of the campus&#x27; many housing complexes.

=== Downtown Campus ===

The Downtown Campus in Downtown San Antonio houses parts of the College of Engineering and Integrated Design, College for Health, Community and Policy, and College of Education and Human Development. Many of the university&#x27;s community outreach centers and institutes including the Texas State Data Center and The Urban Education Institute are located at the downtown campus as well. In early 1993, the demolition of Fiesta Plaza made way for what would become the Downtown Campus. While construction was underway, the campus made its temporary home at Cypress Tower on Main Street, offering its first classes in January 1994. Its permanent location on I-10 and Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard (formerly Durango Boulevard) was completed in 1997. A new bus-rapid transit line, VIA Primo, opened in late 2012. Together with a VIA Express route, allows students to quickly commute between the UTSA Main Campus and the Downtown Campus.

In 2018 UTSA President Eighmy announced a new $90 million 10-year advancement plan for the downtown campus which includes a $15 million gift from San Antonio business leader Graham Weston to support the university&#x27;s proposed School of Data Science. At the same time, UTSA actively engaged in discussions with the City of San Antonio and Bexar County for the transfer of downtown parcels of land, valued at $13 million, to the university. Those parcels became the sites for the new school, a National Security Collaboration Center, and for the expansion of the UTSA College of Business.

=== UTSA Institute of Texan Cultures ===
The Institute of Texan Cultures previously housed at the Texas Pavilion, hosted the Texas Folklife Festival, an annual event celebrating the various cultures of Texas and their roles in the multicultural state. The ITC (as it is commonly known) was originally built as a $10 million project for HemisFair &#x27;68, with the stated goal of promoting awareness of the history and ethnic diversity of Texas. It was turned over to the University of Texas System after the conclusion of the world&#x27;s fair, being designated as a campus of UTSA in 1986. It served to further historical research, housing both UTSA&#x27;s archives and historic photography collection with over 3 million images. The ITC formalized an agreement with the Smithsonian Institution in 2010 to obtain affiliate status. Funding for the ITC primarily came from legislative appropriations, event admissions fees, grants and contributions. It was announced on April 3, 2024, that the building housing The ITC would close by May 2024 and the current future of the museum is unknown at this time other than the museum will be temporarily operating out of the Frost Tower&#x27;s 1st floor beginning in early 2025 and lasting at least five years.

=== Park West Campus ===
Located less than 2 miles west of the Main campus, the 125-acre Park West Campus is currently home to the UTSA Roadrunners soccer and track-and-field facilities. Park West is also designated as a host site for community sporting events. Construction of a new 80,000-square-foot state of the art outpatient facility is slated to be complete by summer 2023, once complete it will offer Student-athletes access to enhanced imaging and surgical services, primary care, orthopedics, physical therapy and other specialties. The center will ultimately support the sports medicine program for UTSA student-athletes and provide future collaborative opportunities in academics, research and health care delivery.

=== Southwest Campus ===
The Southwest Campus is located on the San Antonio River in downtown San Antonio. Considered an &quot;urban oasis&quot;, the campus has been a place of learning for more than 165 years. The buildings and campus were originally known as the Ursuline Convent and Academy, which opened in 1851. The campus is now home to part of the UTSA School of Art.

In 2009, The AFROTC unit was awarded 36 slots for field training compared to Texas A&amp;M University, which had 32.

=== Student Government ===
The Student Government Association, originally founded as &quot;Student Representative Assembly&quot; (&quot;SRA&quot;), was established in 1976. The organization&#x27;s name changed to &quot;Student Government Association&quot; for the second Constitution in 1993. In October 1976, the UTSA student body voted to accept a constitution establishing the Student Representative Assembly. The constitution was drafted by a student committee and approved by the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System.

The Student Government Association (SGA) is the official voice of the university&#x27;s student body. Its officers and committees reflect that of the United States federal government, using a three-branch system. Student Government hosts the University Life Awards, a large celebration in the Ballroom that recognizes excellence in leadership throughout the campus. All students are considered members of SGA, due to both the fact its activities are subsidized through the Student Services Fee and it represents the views of the entire student body.

Accomplishments credited to the association include facilitating voting for a university mascot in 1977, advocating for building a university center in 1979, sponsoring the first Fiesta UTSA in 1980, distributing the University Life Awards to recognize outstanding efforts of students, faculty and staff, expanding dining hours, advocating for the installation of the Roadrunner statue, and renovating the Sombrilla fountain.

The Paisano is the oldest independent collegiate student newspaper in Texas and one of only approximately a dozen independent student newspapers in the nation.

==Traditions==
The official colors of UTSA are blue and orange. The colors of the University of Texas System have historically been orange and white. Blue was selected upon the recommendation of the Student Representative Assembly in accordance with the Board of Regents&#x27; Rules and Regulations, which states &quot;an institution may adopt one additional color to be used in connection with athletic and other activities of the institution.&quot;

The Greater Roadrunner, a bird representative of the Texas Hill Country and the American Southwest, was voted the UTSA mascot in 1977. &quot;Rowdy the Roadrunner&quot; attends many university functions and games. On March 1, 2008, UTSA Athletics unveiled its new logos during the Homecoming Game against Texas A&amp;M University–Corpus Christi. The athletic markings were changed to further differentiate it from other bird mascots such as the University of Kansas Jayhawk.

=== Class ring ===
The night before class ring ceremonies, the UTSA rings are placed within the Alamo overnight, a tradition that began in 2012 as part of the university&#x27;s efforts to build upon longstanding traditions.

===Best Fest and Fiesta UTSA===
Fiesta UTSA, an annual event held in April, began in 1978. The first Fiesta UTSA was attended by over 1,000 students and included music, a jalapeño eating contest, a watermelon seed spitting contest, a dunk tank, and other activities. Fiesta UTSA includes booths set up under the Sombrilla in a carnival atmosphere and run by Registered Student Organizations. Fiesta UTSA became the kickoff event for Fiesta San Antonio each spring, having been added to the official Fiesta San Antonio schedule in 1980. Fiesta UTSA was renamed by students in 2022, and is now known as Día en la Sombrilla.

Best Fest, an annual celebration held in October, began in 1978 (as &quot;Bestfest&quot;) as &quot;a special salute to five of the state&#x27;s outstanding festivals,&quot; including New Braunfels&#x27;s Wurstfest, Corpus Christi&#x27;s Buccaneer Days, San Antonio&#x27;s Fiesta, the Texas State Fair in Dallas, and George Washington&#x27;s Birthday Celebration in Laredo. It was presented by the student organization Variety 79. In 1979, the event was said to be &quot;a salute to five of the city&#x27;s outstanding festivals: Fiesta Navidena, King William Fair, La Feria del Rio, the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo, and the Texas Folklife Festival.&quot;

=== Birds Up Hand Sign ===
The origins of the Birds Up hand sign dates back to 1979 during Wurstfest in New Braunfels, Texas. The gesture is made by making a fist with the palm facing away from the body, then extending the pinky finger and thumb. The thumb represents the head of the roadrunner while the pinky finger represents the tail.

===Homecoming===
Homecoming has many traditions at UTSA. One of the most notable is the annual Golf Cart Parade. Student organizations design and create decorated golf carts according to the year&#x27;s homecoming theme. Each submission is constructed by students at the Golf Cart Decorating Party, an event held a few days before. The parade has been an official part of the university&#x27;s homecoming ceremonies since 1993. In 2004 it was combined into the Rowdy Rampage Fireworks Spectacular, alongside the spirit rally and a live music concert.

===University Life Awards===
The University Life Awards (also known as the &quot;ULAs&quot;) is an award ceremony sponsored by Student Government Association to recognize outstanding leadership on campus. It recognizes students, student organizations, faculty and staff who have made an exceptional difference in the UTSA community. It is touted as the university&#x27;s oldest tradition. Awards include Most Outstanding Student (by colleges and classification), Greek Man and Woman of the Year, the Jane Findling Award and the Golden Feather Award.

==Athletics==

UTSA is San Antonio&#x27;s only NCAA Division I FBS institution and is currently a member of The American Athletic Conference (AAC). The Roadrunners compete in 17 intercollegiate sports including baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, women&#x27;s soccer, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor and outdoor track and field, and women&#x27;s volleyball. The university has hosted 17 NCAA Division I Championships since 1997 including four men&#x27;s Final Fours, two women&#x27;s Final Fours and a pair of women&#x27;s Volleyball Championships. UTSA has captured more than 70 conference championships, appeared in more than 50 NCAA postseason appearances, and has garnered two NCA national championships. The home of the UTSA basketball and volleyball teams is the Convocation Center, a multipurpose arena with more than 4,000 seats at the UTSA Main Campus. The Park West Athletics Complex opened in 2013 as the home of the soccer and track &amp; field programs. The baseball, softball and tennis teams all play at on-campus facilities.

UTSA maintains a rivalry with Texas State University in a series known as the I-35 Rivalry. Separated by about 50 miles (~80 km), both schools have been conference rivals since 1991, first in the Southland Conference and then in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). UTSA and Texas State are now in different conferences, with UTSA in The American Athletic Conference (AAC) and Texas State in the Sun Belt Conference. The leadership of both universities have stated their interest in preserving the football rivalry, even as the institutions are in different conferences.

In 2019, after working closely with Brenda Tracy who is the founder of the national campaign and non-profit SetTheExpectation, UTSA became the first university in the nation to implement the Tracy Rule which is the most comprehensive Serious Misconduct rule in the NCAA.&quot;The rule ensures that a current or prospective student-athlete who has been convicted of, pleaded guilty or no contest to a felony or misdemeanor involving Serious Misconduct, has been found a delinquent in relationship to a juvenile code equivalent, or has been disciplined by the university or athletic department at any time during enrollment at any collegiate institution (excluding temporary disciplinary action during an investigation) due to Serious Misconduct shall not be eligible for athletically related financial aid, practice or competition at The University of Texas at San Antonio.&quot;

===Football===
 Football has always been a great topic of conversation in the UTSA community since the university&#x27;s very beginning. In a 1971 article famously titled &quot;UTSA will not have football&quot;, president Arleigh Templeton dismissed the idea of the university acquiring a football team, stating &quot;When we do begin playing football we will be playing the best competition available.&quot; A 2007 student referendum doubled the university&#x27;s athletics fee, effectively paving the way for the program&#x27;s arrival in the fall of 2011.

The football team plays its home games in the 65,000-seat Alamodome in Downtown San Antonio. The university won its first football game against Northeastern State University on September 3, 2011, in front of a record attendance of 56,743. Thus setting the NCAA&#x27;s record for the highest-attended inaugural game for a start-up program. The Roadrunners also broke the attendance record for an inaugural season, averaging 35,521 per game. UTSA lead the WAC in attendance for the 2012 season. The Roadrunners now compete in The American Athletic Conference (AAC) after previously being a part of Conference USA. The UTSA administration was very supportive of the move along with AAC commissioner Mike Aresco stating, &quot;We’re really excited about UTSA coming into our conference. They bring so much, and this community brings so much, I said to myself, ‘Why didn’t we do it before?’ We had 11 teams for a while, and we didn&#x27;t expand, and you just can&#x27;t get a better program coming in.”

<doc id="953388" wikidata="Q7668413" url="?curid=953388" title="T. Jerome Overbeck">
<text>Rev. T. Jerome Overbeck, S.J. is an American author and Christian theologian who is also a prominent priest of the Society of Jesus. Since 1983, he has been chaplain, liturgist and professor at Loyola University Chicago with the Loyola University Chicago School of Law and the School of Social Work in Chicago, Illinois. He has also been a professional consultant for the construction and renovation of Roman Catholic places of worship.

Born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, he entered the Jesuit religious order—obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree at Loyola University Chicago in 1970 and a master&#x27;s degree in education at Xavier University in 1972. Overbeck entered the Berkeley Jesuit School of Theology where he obtained a master&#x27;s degree in divinity in 1974, a master&#x27;s degree in theology in 1975 and a licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1982. He continued his studies at the Graduate Theological Union and University of California Berkeley, obtaining a doctoral degree in 1983.

Overbeck&#x27;s most prominent publications were &quot;Ancient Fonts, Modern Lessons&quot; in 1998, &quot;Preparing Your Catholic Wedding&quot; in 2002 (2nd edition 2010), and &quot;Hindsight: Wisdom From Couples Who Have Prepared A Wedding And Lived A Marriage&quot; in 2014. Considered a groundbreaking analysis, &quot;Spirits, Life, Worship: A Hawaiian Religious and Catholic Perspective&quot; was published in 2015 after spending a year researching native Hawaiian religious traditions in Hawaii.

<text>In optics, an &quot;image&quot; is defined as the collection of focus points of light rays coming from an object. A real image is the collection of focus points actually made by converging/diverging rays, while a virtual image is the collection of focus points made by extensions of diverging or converging rays. In other words, a real image is an image which is located in the plane of convergence for the light rays that originate from a given object. Examples of real images include the image produced on a detector in the rear of a camera, and the image produced on an eyeball retina (the camera and eye focus light through an internal convex lens). 

In ray diagrams (such as the images on the right), real rays of light are always represented by full, solid lines; perceived or extrapolated rays of light are represented by dashed lines. A real image occurs at points where rays actually converge, whereas a virtual image occurs at points that rays appear to be diverging from.

Real images can be produced by concave mirrors and converging lenses, only if the object is placed further away from the mirror/lens than the focal point, and this real image is inverted. As the object approaches the focal point the image approaches infinity, and when the object passes the focal point the image becomes virtual and is not inverted (upright image). The distance is not the same as from the object to the lenses.

Real images may also be inspected by a second lens or lens system. This is the mechanism used by telescopes, binoculars and light microscopes. The objective lens gathers the light from the object and projects a real image within the structure of the optical instrument. A second lens or system of lenses, the eyepiece, then projects a second real image onto the retina of the eye.

<doc id="953399" wikidata="Q344046" url="?curid=953399" title="Active Denial System">
<text>The Active Denial System (ADS) is a non-lethal directed-energy weapon developed by the U.S. military, designed for area denial, perimeter security and crowd control. Informally, the weapon is also called the heat ray since it works by heating the surface of targets, such as the skin of targeted human beings. Raytheon had marketed a reduced-range version of this technology. The ADS was deployed in 2010 with the United States military in the Afghanistan War, but was withdrawn without seeing combat. On August 20, 2010, the Los Angeles Sheriff&#x27;s Department announced its intent to use this technology to control incarcerated people in the Pitchess Detention Center in Los Angeles, stating its intent to use it in &quot;operational evaluation&quot; in situations such as breaking up prisoner fights. As of 2014, the ADS was only a vehicle-mounted weapon, though U.S. Marines and police were both working on portable versions. ADS was developed under the sponsorship of the Department of Defense Non-Lethal Weapons Program with the Air Force Research Laboratory as the lead agency. In 2014, there were reports that Russia and China were developing their own versions of the Active Denial System.

==Mechanism and effects==
The ADS works by firing a high-powered (100 kW output power) beam of 95 GHz waves at a target, which corresponds to a wavelength of 3.2 mm. The ADS millimeter wave energy works on a principle similar to a microwave oven, exciting the water and fat molecules in the skin, and instantly heating them via dielectric heating. One significant difference is that a microwave oven uses the much lower frequency (and longer wavelength) of 2.45 GHz. The short millimeter waves used in ADS only penetrate the top layers of skin, with most of the energy being absorbed within 0.4 mm ( inch), whereas microwaves will penetrate into human tissue about .

The ADS&#x27;s effect of repelling humans occurs at slightly higher than , though first-degree burns occur at about , and second-degree burns occur at about . In testing, pea-sized blisters have been observed in less than 0.1% of ADS exposures, indicating that second degree surface burns have been caused by the device. The radiation burns caused are similar to microwave burns, but only on the skin surface due to the decreased penetration of shorter millimeter waves. The surface temperature of a target will continue to rise so long as the beam is applied, at a rate dictated by the target&#x27;s material and distance from the transmitter, along with the beam&#x27;s frequency and power level set by the operator. Most human test subjects reached their pain threshold within 3 seconds, and none could endure more than 5 seconds.

A spokesman for the Air Force Research Laboratory described his experience as a test subject for the system: For the first millisecond, it just felt like the skin was warming up. Then it got warmer and warmer and you felt like it was on fire. ... As soon as you&#x27;re away from that beam your skin returns to normal and there is no pain.

Like all focused energy, the beam will irradiate all matter in the targeted area, including everything beyond/behind it that is not shielded, with no possible discrimination between individuals, objects or materials. Anyone incapable of leaving the target area (e.g., physically handicapped, infants, incapacitated, trapped, etc.) would continue to receive radiation until the operator turned off the beam. Reflective materials such as aluminum cooking foil should reflect this radiation and could be used to make clothing that would be protective against this radiation.

Following approximately ten thousand test exposures of volunteers to ADS beams, a Penn State Human Effects Advisory Panel (HEAP) concluded that ADS is a non-lethal weapon that has a high probability of effectiveness with a low probability of injury:
* no significant effects for wearers of contact lenses or other eyewear (including night vision goggles)
* normal skin applications, such as cosmetics, have little effect on ADSʼs interaction with skin
* no age-related differences in response to ADS exposures
* no effect on the male reproduction system
* damage was the occurrence of pea-sized blisters in less than 0.1% of the exposures (6 of 10,000 exposures).
In April 2007, one airman in an ADS test was overdosed and received second-degree burns on both legs, and was treated in a hospital for two days. There was also one laboratory accident in 1999 that resulted in a small second-degree burn.

===Safety studies===
Many possible long-term effects have been studied, with the conclusion that no long-term effects are likely at the exposure levels studied. However, overexposures of either operators or targets may cause thermal injury. According to an official military assessment, &quot;In the event of an overexposure to a power density sufficient to produce thermal injury, there is an extremely low probability that scars derived from such injury might later become cancerous. Proper wound management further decreases this probability, as well as the probability of hypertrophic scarring or keloid formation.&quot;
* Cancer: A mouse cancer study was performed at two energy levels and exposures with a 94 GHz transmitter: a single 10-second, 1 W/cm2 exposure, and repeated 10-second exposures over a two-week period at 333 mW/cm2. At both energy levels, no increase in skin cancers was observed. No studies of higher energy levels, or longer exposure times have been performed on millimeter-wave systems.
* Cornea damage: Tests on non-human primate eyes have observed no short-term or long-term damage as the blink reflex protects the eye from damage within 0.25 seconds.
* Birth defects: Millimeter waves only penetrate 0.4 mm ( inch) into the skin, making direct damage to the testes or ovaries impossible.
* Blisters and scarring: Pea-sized blistering due to second degree burns occurred in a very small minority (less than 0.1%) of tested exposures, which have a remote potential for scarring.

ADS operators would be exposed to more than the standard maximum permissible exposure (MPE) limits for RF energy, and military use requires an exception to these exposure limits.

ADS Safety Studies have been independently reviewed by a non-government human effect advisory panel.

==History==
===Development===
Two Active Denial Systems were developed under a Defense Department &quot;Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration&quot; Program (now known as Joint Concept Technology Demonstration Program) from 2002 to 2007. Unlike typical weapons development programs in the Defense Department, ACTDs/JCTDs are not focused on optimizing the technology; rather they are focused on rapidly assembling the technology in a configuration suitable for user evaluation.

===Contracts===
On September 22, 2004, Raytheon was granted an FCC license to demonstrate the technology to &quot;law enforcement, military and security organizations.&quot;

On October 4, 2004, the United States Department of Defense published the following contract information:

===Demonstration===
The military has made the ADS available to the media for demonstrations on a number of occasions. A fully operational and mounted version of the system was demonstrated on January 24, 2007, at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia. A Reuters correspondent who volunteered to be shot with the beam during the demonstration described it as &quot;similar to a blast from a very hot oven – too painful to bear without diving for cover.&quot; An Associated Press reporter who volunteered to be engaged stated &quot;They certainly convinced me that the system could help save the lives of innocent civilians and our young service members&quot;. A CBS News correspondent did an in-depth story on ADS in March 2008. A demonstration was conducted for the media on March 9, 2012, at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia.

===Afghanistan deployment===

On June 21, 2010, Lt. Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the NATO forces commander General Stanley McChrystal, confirmed in an e-mail to &quot;Wired&quot; reporter Noah Shachtman that the ADS was deployed in Afghanistan. The spokesman added however that the system had not yet been used operationally.

The ADS has been removed from service in Afghanistan as of July 25, 2010. A former Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense noted that the recall of ADS from Afghanistan was an &quot;opportunity missed&quot; and &quot;the non-lethality of the ADS system could prove useful in a counterinsurgency operation where avoidance of civilian casualties is essential to mission success.&quot;

===Potential deployment against civilians===
In September 2020 it was revealed that federal officials had explored the use of the device and the Long Range Acoustic Device to disperse civilians protesting outside the White House in June of that year, but had been advised that the National Guard was not currently in possession of either device.

===Problems===
There have been speculations in open literature for why the ADS has not been used in a theater of operations. Some of the claimed problems expressed have included: (1) that a potential unreliability in certain environmental conditions, because precipitation (rain/snow/fog/mist) commonly dissipates RF energy, which may moderate the ADS&#x27;s sensation to &quot;warm and comfortable&quot;; (2) that ADS may only work successfully against exposed skin, implying that heavier clothing may reduce its effectiveness and that its tactical usefulness may potentially be limited in striking specific personnel hiding in crowds of civilians, because this &#x27;hiding&#x27; situation has not been seen in all recent theaters of operation (was reportedly observed in Somalia and Iraq, but reportedly not in Afghanistan). What the actual performance of ADS is relative to these concerns is not presently known to be published in open literature.

===Future===
Following the development of two prototype systems for the ACTD, interest remains in the technology by the military as a means to minimize collateral damage and increase force protection. Research continues on technology that will make it smaller, more reliable, and able to be used on the move, for example, in protection of convoys.

==Concepts for use==
ADS was developed as a non-lethal weapon. According to Department of Defense policy, non-lethal weapons &quot;are explicitly designed and primarily employed so as to incapacitate personnel or material, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to personnel, and undesired damage to property and the environment.&quot; ADS has applications for crowd control and perimeter defense, and filling &quot;the gap between shouting and shooting.&quot; Other crowd control methods – including pepper spray, tear gas, water cannons, slippery foam and rubber bullets – carry implicit dangers of temporary or permanent injury or accidental death, and often leave residue or residual material. Combinations of acoustic and optical system platforms with ADS can be used to effectively communicate to, warn of escalation of force, introduce optical and auditory deterrents and step function the escalation of transmitted force from relatively benign to ultimately forced dispersal of a crowd, or to deny them from an area or access to an area. A group of people can theoretically be dispersed or induced to leave an area in a manner unlikely to damage personnel, non-involved civilians (no stray bullets), or to nearby buildings or the environment.

Non-lethal weapons are intended to provide options to U.S. troops, for example, &quot;to stop suspicious vehicles without killing the drivers&quot;. Although the ADS millimeter wave frequency does not affect a car&#x27;s electronic components, it can be used to deter a driver in an approaching vehicle. In a broader strategic context, non-lethal weapons such as ADS have the potential to offer &quot;precision, accuracy, and effective duration that can help save military and civilian lives, break the cycle of violence by offering a more graduated response, and even prevent violence from occurring if the opportunity for early or preclusionary engagement arises.&quot;

The Council on Foreign Relations noted that &quot;wider integration of existing types of nonlethal weapons (NLW) into the U.S. Army and Marine Corps could have helped to reduce the damage done by widespread looting and sabotage after the cessation of major conflict in Iraq.&quot;

In Afghanistan, the need to minimize civilian casualties has led to restrictive rules of engagement on the use of lethal force by US troops. A National Public Radio correspondent in Afghanistan &quot;witnessed troops grappling with the dilemma of whether to shoot.&quot; Non-lethal weapons such as ADS provide an option for US forces in those situations.

==Controversy==
The effects of this radio frequency on humans have been studied by the military for years, and much, but not all of the research has been published openly in peer-reviewed journals.

A news article criticized the sheer amount of time it is taking to field this system, citing the potential it had to avert a great deal of pain and suffering in volatile areas around the world.

While it is claimed not to cause burns under &quot;ordinary use&quot;, it is also described as being similar to that of an incandescent light bulb being pressed against the skin, which can cause severe burns in just a few seconds. The beam can be focused up to 700 meters away, and is said to penetrate thick clothing although not walls. At 95 GHz, the frequency is much higher than the 2.45 GHz of a microwave oven. This frequency was chosen because it penetrates less than , which – in most humans, except for eyelids and the thinner skin of babies – avoids the second skin layer (the dermis) where critical structures are found such as nerve endings and blood vessels.

The early methodology of testing, in which volunteers were asked to remove glasses, contact lenses and metallic objects that could cause hot spots, raised concerns as to whether the device would remain true to its purpose of non-lethal temporary incapacitation if used in the field where safety precautions would not be taken. However, these tests were early in the program and part of a thorough and methodical process to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the technology, which has now involved more than 600 volunteer subjects and some 10,200 exposures. As safety was demonstrated in each step of the process, restrictions were removed, and now, according to ADS proponents, there are no restrictions or precautions necessary for volunteers experiencing the effect. Long-term exposure to the beam may cause more serious damage, especially to sensitive tissues, such as those of the eyes. Two people received second degree burns after exposure to the device during testing.

Critics cite that despite the stated intent of the ADS is to be a non-lethal device designed to temporarily incapacitate, and 
despite that ADS had undergone legal and treaty compliance reviews by AF/JAO and determined to be in compliance with the applicable laws and treaties, that modifications or misuse by an operator could nevertheless turn the ADS into a more damaging weapon which could potentially violate international conventions on warfare. 

Some have focused on the lower threshold of use which may lead those who use them to become &quot;trigger-happy&quot;, especially in dealing with peaceful protesters. Others have focused on concerns that weapons whose operative principle is that of inflicting pain (though &quot;non-lethal&quot;) might be useful for such purposes as torture, as they may leave little or no evidence of use, but undoubtedly have the capacity to inflict horrific pain on a restrained subject. According to &quot;Wired&quot;, the ADS has been rejected for fielding in Iraq due to Pentagon fears that it would be regarded as an instrument of torture.

==Silent Guardian==
Defense contractor Raytheon has developed a smaller version of the ADS, the Silent Guardian. This stripped-down model is directly marketed to law enforcement agencies, the military and other security providers. The system is operated and aimed with a joystick and aiming screen. The device can be used for targets over away, and the beam has a power of 30 kilowatts.

The Los Angeles County Jail installed the smaller-sized unit, under the name &quot;Assault Intervention Device&quot;, on the ceiling of the Pitchess Detention Center in 2014.

<doc id="953401" wikidata="Q24383" url="?curid=953401" title="Rock music in Germany">
<text>German rock music (&quot;Deutschrock&quot;) came into its own only by the late 1960s, but spawned many bands spanning genres such as krautrock, Neue Deutsche Welle, heavy metal, punk, and industrial.

Rock and roll itself arose in the United States in the 1940s, and spread around the world beginning in about 1956. There were few German performers at that time, even though American rock was popular in (West) Germany. Rockabilly stars like Bill Haley &amp; His Comets were of particular popularity. The reasons for this lack of German musical innovation were the suppression of &quot;degenerate&quot; forms of music by the Nazis and/or the traumatic effects of the war—while Germany was a center of several forms of modern music before the Nazi era, it had difficulty developing its own music culture after the war.

== 1960s and 1970s: Krautrock ==

Mostly instrumental, the signature sound of krautrock mixed rock music and &quot;rock band&quot; instrumentation (guitar, bass, drums) with electronic instrumentation and textures, often with what would now be described as an ambient music sensibility.

By the end of the 1960s, the American and British counterculture and hippie movement had moved rock towards psychedelic rock, heavy metal, progressive rock and other styles (from which Scorpions rose to prominence), incorporating, for the first time in popular music, socially and politically incisive lyrics. The 1968 student riots in Germany, France and Italy had created a class of young, intellectual continental listeners, while nuclear weapons, pollution and war inspired protests and activism. Music had taken a turn towards electronic avant-garde in the mid-1950s.

These factors all laid the scene for what came to be termed &quot;krautrock&quot;, which arose at the first major German rock festival in 1968 at Essen. Like their American and British counterparts, German rock musicians played a kind of psychedelia. That same year, 1968, saw the foundation of the Zodiak Free Arts Lab in Berlin by Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Conrad Schnitzler, which further popularized the psychedelic-rock sound in the German mainstream.

== Neue Deutsche Welle ==

<text>Combat stores ships, or storeships, are ships used to store naval supplies. They are used to deliver supplies such as provisions and fuel to combat ships on extended deployments. The United States Navy operated the and es and the Royal Navy operated the class and continues to operate one ship, having scrapped the other. They carried or carry the fleets&#x27;s refrigerated stores, dry provisions, technical spares, general stores, fleet freight, mail and replacement personnel or specialists. Storeships should not be confused with fast combat support ships which are high speed auxiliary ships or tenders which provide maintenance support to flotillas.

==Storeship==

Both the United States and the United Kingdom used stores ships in the War of 1812. In both the Mexican–American War and in the American Civil War, captured enemy prizes that were not considered &quot;warlike&quot; enough to be sold for prize money often became stores ships for a naval force operating where no friendly ports are nearby. took part in the Baja California Campaign in the Mexican–American War. In both the Spanish–American War and the Philippine–American War the US Navy acquired the stores ship and other similar vessels to serve in its Asiatic Squadron.

==Combat stores ship==
===US Navy===
Six combat stores ships operated by Military Sealift Command provided supplies, including frozen, chilled and dry provisions, and propulsion and aviation fuel to United States Navy combatant ships at sea for extended periods of time. Combat stores ships did not carry ammunition for resupply.

Combat stores ships provided underway replenishment of all types of supplies, ranging from repair parts to fresh food, clothing and mail via tensioned cargo rigs and CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters or their commercial equivalents. Combat stores ships have been replaced by the more capable s in the US Navy.

==Former combat stores ships==

Three ships were transferred from the British Royal Fleet Auxiliary to MSC in 1981–83: on January 18, 1981; on November 5, 1981 and on December 13, 1983. Five Navy s were transferred to Military Sealift Command in 1992–94: on October 15, 1992; on February 1, 1993; on August 11, 1993; on November 2, 1993 and on September 23, 1994. &quot;San Diego&quot; was deactivated on December 10, 1997 and &quot;Mars&quot; was deactivated on February 12, 1998. &quot;Sirius&quot; was sold in 2005, &quot;Spica&quot; was used as a target ship and sunk in 2009 and &quot;Saturn&quot; was used as a target ship and sunk in 2010.

<doc id="953405" wikidata="Q3238030" url="?curid=953405" title="Licentiate of Sacred Theology">
<text>Licentiate in Sacred Theology (; abbreviated LTh or STL) is the second of three ecclesiastical degrees in theology (the first being the Baccalaureate in Sacred Theology and the third being the Doctorate in Sacred Theology) which are conferred by a number of pontifical faculties around the world. The licentiate comes with attendant canonical effects in the Catholic Church, specifically granting the holder the right to teach in Catholic seminaries and schools of theology.

==Description==
The program for a licentiate&#x27;s degree is equivalent to a total of two years or four semesters of full-time study after receiving a university degree and the Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree [STB] (SapC 72b). The STB, or first cycle, requires five years or ten semesters (SapC 72a). &quot;In this cycle the special disciplines are taught corresponding to the nature of the diverse specializations being undertaken. Also seminars and practical exercises are conducted for the acquisition of the ability to do scientific research.&quot; (SapC 72b) The licentiate program develops research skills and treats theological questions in greater depth.

Students may pursue the license as either a transitional or a terminal degree. As a transitional degree, the STL program introduces students to a more scientific study of theology in pursuing Doctoral studies. &quot;Nobody can be admitted to the doctorate unless first having obtained the licentiate&quot; (SapC 49.2). As a terminal degree, the license prepares students to be teachers and resource persons.

A graduate of the STL program is prepared to teach theology in a college, seminary, or university, to function as a chaplain to various professional groups, and to act as a theological resource for a diocese and diocesan agencies. &quot;The doctorate is the academic degree which enables one to teach in a Faculty and which is therefore required for this purpose, the licentiate is the academic degree which enables one to teach in a major seminary or equivalent school and which is therefore required for this purpose&quot; (SapC 50.1). In several European countries, the master level degree is referred to as a license – from its original meaning as a &quot;license to incept&quot;, i.e., that is, permission from the local bishop to actually take the degree of master or doctor, an event which took place through the ceremony of inception.

The usual prerequisites for entering the Licentiate program of Sacred Theology are that a candidate must have the Baccalaureate in Sacred Theology (STB) or equivalent, typically the Master of Divinity (M.Div.). In order for a candidate to receive a license in sacred theology, he or she must engage in a two-year program of theological studies and propose an original thesis which contributes to the understanding of sacred theology.

The license in sacred theology is required for a person to teach sacred theology in a pontifical university (SapC 17) or major seminary (SapC 50.1). The license is also the prerequisite for the doctorate (STD) (SapC 49.2).
The Licentiate of Sacred Scripture is a similar degree in the field of biblical studies.

<text>Rattlesnake Annie (born Rosan Gallimore, December 26, 1941) is an American country singer and songwriter. She earned her nickname as a child from her respect of snakes. Rattlesnake began recording music in 1959 and achieved success in Europe. She became the first female country blues musician to tour the Eastern Bloc countries in Europe and released an album with a country singer Michal Tučný from Czechoslovakia. In 1989, she became the first American country performer to sign a recording contract with Sony Music Japan.

==Early years==
She was born and raised near Puryear, Tennessee, United States, on a cotton and tobacco farm.

Rattlesnake&#x27;s father had been a country and blues musician, singer, guitar and fiddle and she learned to play guitar at an early age. She earned her first paycheck from singing at age eight, and from then on her goal in life was to earn a living while making music. When she was 12, Rattlesnake and two of her cousins formed a band called the Gallimore Sisters. They performed locally and won a statewide talent contest in 1954, landing them an appearance in Nashville on the &quot;Junior Grand Ole Opry&quot; and a live television performance.

At age 16, Rattlesnake moved to Memphis and then on to Huntsville, Alabama.

==Recording career==
Rattlesnake continued to pursue a music career, and in 1974 her first single, &quot;Texas Lullabye&quot;, was released. She recorded her debut album, &quot;Rattlesnakes and Rusty Water&quot;, on her own label, Rattlesnake Records. At the time, it was also rare for a woman to produce her own songs. Rattlesnake reminisced of those early days: &quot;I was breaking down barriers. If I could work like a man in the fields, why couldn&#x27;t I play a guitar and produce my own records?&quot;

Because of promotion and her focus for International music, her first album became popular in Europe. In the mid-1970s, she became the first female country blues singer/guitarist songwriter to play in the Eastern Bloc countries of Europe. She appeared on television in East Germany, and the West German branch of Greenpeace adopted one of her songs, &quot;Goodbye to a River&quot;, as their anthem. In Czechoslovakia she recorded an album, &quot;Anka Chřestýš &amp; Poslední Kovboj&quot; (lit. &quot;Rattlesnake Annie and the Last Cowboy&quot;), with Czech country singer Michal Tučný.

In 1991, Rattlesnake became the first American country performer to sign a recording contract with Sony Music Japan. She expressed relief at the agreement, mentioning that &quot;it&#x27;s always been a hassle because they can never put me in a slot. What bin does the record store use for my records? ... When I signed with Sony Japan and they put me in their world music department, for the first time I felt free and understood.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In the early 1960s she moved to Texas, where she met and married Max McGowan. The couple purchased 200 acres of land along the Brazos River. The land had never been cleared or lived on. She and her husband moved to Southern Spain in the 1990s, where they remained for 30 years. In Andalusia she immersed herself in the lives and music of the Romani people and Flamenco.

==Music==
Rattlesnake has recorded music and performed live on every continent except Oceania In her career, she has recorded in over ten languages, including Czech, Russian, Spanish, Japanese, Maya, German, Chinese, Arabic and English. Many of her songs contain a political message. She says that &quot;Songs are so important to make a statement on issues, and that&#x27;s how I have used my music. Life is just full of objections, especially when you are a woman.&quot; In this vein, she has recorded songs for the Civil Rights Movement, for women&#x27;s rights, and against the Vietnam War.

<text>Wycoller is a hamlet in the civil parish of Trawden Forest in Pendle, Lancashire, England. It is east of Colne, near to the junction of the Lancashire, West Yorkshire and North Yorkshire borders.

The hamlet is centred on the ruins of 16th-century Wycoller Hall and may date back to the 10th century BC. It is in a conservation area, and is closed to outside traffic. There is a car park on the road from Trawden and another on the east side opposite Height Laithe Farm on the road towards Haworth in Yorkshire.

The name is probably from the Old English &quot;wīc&quot; &quot;dairy farm&quot; and &quot;alr&quot; &quot;alder&quot;, so means &quot;dairy farm by the alders&quot;.

==Bridges==
Various ancient bridges cross Wycoller Beck, including &#x27;Pack-Horse Bridge&#x27;, a twin arched bridge in the centre of the village, &#x27;Clapper Bridge&#x27; (also known as Hall Bridge) and &#x27;Clam Bridge&#x27; (also known as Bank House Bridge). The last is believed to be of neolithic origin (possibly 6000 years old) and is listed as an ancient monument. It consists of just a long stone laid across the river. It was damaged by floods in 1989–90, though has now been repaired. All three bridges are designated as both Grade II* listed buildings and scheduled monuments.

==Wycoller Hall==

Wycoller Hall was originally the home of the Hartley family, and passed through marriage to the Cunliffe family in the early 17th century. The hall was built in 1550 by Piers Hartley, and was extended in the late 18th century by its last owner, Squire Cunliffe. The structure was partially dismantled in 1818, some material was reused in the construction of a cotton mill, to help repay debts owed by Henry Owen-Cunliffe, who was the last Cunliffe to live at the hall. He was born Henry Owen of Sheffield and was left the Hall by a distant uncle (Cunliffe) if he changed his name to Cunliffe and educated himself. The hall subsequently fell into ruin and is reputed to be haunted by a variety of spectres. Like the bridges, it is both a Grade II* listed building and a scheduled monument.

&#x27;Ferndean Manor&#x27; in Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is thought to be based on Wycoller Hall. The Brontë Way passes through here, leading to the Brontë sisters&#x27; home in nearby Haworth.

==20th–21st centuries==
Wycoller appears in &quot;The Railway Children&quot;, the 1970 British film based on the novel of the same name by E. Nesbit.

It also featured in episode 2 of the television series &quot;Penelope Keith&#x27;s Hidden Villages&quot; in 2014. She also owned a house there, but never lived in it.

Notable people from the village include Tom Emmott, who founded the Lancastrian Party while living in Wycoller Cottage.

<text>South Shore is one of 77 defined community areas of Chicago, Illinois, United States. Located on the city&#x27;s South Side, the area is named for its location along the city&#x27;s southern lakefront. Although South Shore has seen a greater than 40% decrease in residents since Chicago&#x27;s population peaked in the 1950s, the area remains one of the most densely populated neighborhoods on the South Side. The community benefits from its location along the waterfront, its accessibility to Lake Shore Drive, and its proximity to major institutions and attractions such as the University of Chicago, the Museum of Science and Industry, and Jackson Park.

==History==
Like all of what is now the City of Chicago, the South Shore community area was originally inhabited by a number of Algonquian peoples, including the Mascouten and Miami. After the expulsion of Native Americans by white settlers in the nineteenth century, it became characterized by small settlements including Essex, Bryn Mawr, Parkside, Cheltenham Beach, and Windsor Park. The area is bounded by 67th and 79th streets to the north and south and by Stony Island Avenue and Lake Michigan to the west and east. In 1861, the Illinois General Assembly incorporated Hyde Park Township, which included South Shore. The area&#x27;s population grew as workers in the nearby steel industry settled in the area. Following the June 29, 1889 elections, the South Shore community area was annexed into the City of Chicago with the entirety of Hyde Park Township. The location of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in nearby Jackson Park prompted the sale of land and building lots. As in other parts of Chicago, the desire for affordable housing at the start of the twentieth century led to the large scale construction of bungalows. Unlike other areas in which bungalows were built en masse, South Shore&#x27;s bungalow residents were largely affluent. Additionally, South Shore was the destination for white flight from Washington Park as immigrants and African Americans moved there.

After racially restrictive covenants were declared unconstitutional by &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot;, African American families began to move into historically white neighborhoods such as South Shore. The South Shore Commission initiated a program they called &quot;managed integration&quot;, designed to check the physical decline of the community and to achieve racial balance. The initiative was largely unsuccessful on both counts. Per the 1950 census, South Shore had 79,000 residents and was 96% white. A 1951 University of Chicago study estimated that over 20% of the neighborhood’s residents were Jewish. In 1960, the population had dropped to 73,000 residents and was 90% white and 10% black. Like many other urban neighborhoods across the United States undergoing racial change and tensions, many of the white residents began to choose to move to new locations. By 1970, the population had risen to 81,000 and was 69% black and 28% white as South Shore itself became a victim of white flight. By 1980, the population had fallen slightly to 78,000, but was 94% black.

By the late 1990s South Shore had developed into a middle-class African American community. The Chicago Park District purchased the waning South Shore Country Club in 1972, converting it into a cultural center.

== Neighborhoods and sub-areas ==
===Jackson Park Highlands===

The Jackson Park Highlands District is a sixteen block area bounded by East 67th Street on the north. East 71st Street on the south, South Cregier Avenue on the west, and South Jeffrey Boulevard on the east.

The Jackson Park Highlands District is a historic district in the South Shore community area of Chicago. The district was built in 1905 by various architects. It was designated a Chicago Landmark on October 25, 1989.

===Jeffery–Cyril Historic District===

The Jeffery–Cyril Historic District is a national historic district in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The district comprises a cluster of six apartment buildings on Jeffery Boulevard, 71st Place, and Cyril Avenue. All six buildings were built between 1927 and 1929. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 5, 1986.

===South Shore Bungalow Historic District===

The South Shore Bungalow Historic District is a residential historic district in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The district contains 229 Chicago bungalows and twenty other residential buildings built between 1911 and 1930. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 2008.

==Architecture==

The South Shore Cultural Center, previously the South Shore Country Club, began as a lakefront retreat for the wealthiest of Chicago&#x27;s movers and shakers. The firm of Marshall and Fox, architects of the Drake, Blackstone, and Edgewater Beach hotels, were hired to design an opulent, Mediterranean-style clubhouse for a membership that included some of Chicago&#x27;s most prominent families. The grounds provided private stables and members-only beach, and golf course. Tennis, horseback riding, and skeet shooting were enjoyed by guests the likes of Jean Harlow, Will Rogers, and Amelia Earhart. Between the first and second World Wars, a housing boom brought a development of luxury cooperative apartments and mansions to the neighborhood surrounding the club. In 1974 the club held its last members-only event. Today, the Chicago Park District owns the property. It has been restored to its original design and is now open to the public. A major drawback to the South Shore and surrounding South Chicago neighborhoods is that they are one of the few remaining Chicago lakefront neighborhoods that lack a fully publicly accessible neighborhood shoreline. There are lakefront gaps between the existing South Shore Cultural Center and Rainbow Beach to its south. Even larger masses of lakefront land along the South Chicago neighborhood (at the abandoned USX steel mill) with their beautiful vistas of the city&#x27;s lakefront and Chicago skyline are undergoing development as parks and not completely available for recreational enjoyment by the adjacent neighborhood residents. Presently, Chicago Lakeside Development has proposed plans that call for the completion of this southern portion of lakefront with the development of new parklands, beaches, and a continuous waterfront bicycle and jogging path that will link Calumet Park and Beach in the East Side neighborhood to the South Shore Cultural Center in South Shore. Completion of such a project would result in improved access to Chicago&#x27;s southern lakefront and connect it to neighborhoods such as Hyde Park and Bronzeville to the north.

At the northern end of South Shore is the historic district Jackson Park Highlands, one of Chicago&#x27;s greatest examples of structural history and 19th-century architecture, with an abundance of homes in the style of American Foursquare, Colonial Revival, and Renaissance Revival on suburban-sized lots.

Located in the Bryn Mawr section of South Shore is the Allan Miller House at 7121 South Paxton Avenue. Commissioned by advertising executive Allan Miller, this home is an excellent example of Prairie-style architecture. Built in 1915, it is Chicago&#x27;s only surviving building designed by John Van Bergen, a former member of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s architecture firm.

==Politics==

The South Shore community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections by overwhelming margins. In the 2016 presidential election, the South Shore cast 18,130 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 373 votes for Donald Trump (96.07% to 1.98%). In the 2012 presidential election, South Shore cast 22,515 votes for Barack Obama and cast 222 votes for Mitt Romney (98.77% to 0.97%).

==Crime and policing==
On July 14, 2018, the community clashed with the Chicago Police Department after a local barber, Harith Augustus, was shot multiple times by a police officer at 71st Street and Chappel Avenue. Body camera footage without audio was released immediately contrary to past practices of months-long waits for video in other police shootings. Footage taken by body cameras of other officers has not been released.

==Culture and religion==
The Nation of Islam National Center and Mosque Maryam are at 7351 South Stony Island Avenue. The National Black United Front has its headquarters in the community.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago operates Catholic churches. On July 1, 2020, Our Lady of Peace, St. Bride, and St. Philip Neri in South Shore and Our Lady Gate of Heaven Church in Jeffery Manor will merge.

==Transportation==
The South Shore community area has five stations along the South Chicago Branch of the Metra Electric District. In South Shore, the South Chicago Branch runs the median of along East 71st Street, making stops at Stony Island, Bryn Mawr, and South Shore stations before turning southeast along South Exchange Avenue to make stops at Windsor Park and Cheltenham stations. In addition, the 75th Street station is on the Greater Grand Crossing side of the border between that area and South Shore.

==Education==
Chicago Public Schools operates district public schools.

Urban Prep Academies has a South Shore Campus.

Muhammad University of Islam, a Nation of Islam-affiliated primary and secondary school, is adjacent to the Mosque Maryam.

<text>Welbore Ellis, 1st Baron Mendip, PC, FRS (15 December 1713 – 2 February 1802) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons for 53 years from 1741 to 1794 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Mendip. He held a number of political offices, including briefly serving as Secretary for the Colonies in 1782 during the American War of Independence.

==Background==
Ellis was the second but only surviving son of the Most Reverend Welbore Ellis, Bishop of Kildare and Bishop of Meath. He was educated at Westminster School from 1727 to 1732 and then entered Christ Church, Oxford.

==Political career==
In 1741, he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Cricklade, then moved to Weymouth and Melcombe Regis (1747–1761), Aylesbury (1761–1768), Petersfield (1768–1774), Weymouth and Melcombe Regis (1774–1790) and Petersfield (1791–1794).

In 1762, he succeeded Charles Townshend as Secretary at War, and in 1763, he proposed the appropriation of twenty army regiments to the colonies of America. In Parliament, with many others, he opposed the reception of papers from the American Continental Congress. He became Treasurer of the Navy in 1777, then succeeded to the Colonial Secretaryship in 1782, which he held for a matter of months, before the American colonies were lost. In 1784, he became the longest-serving member of the House of Commons (having served for 43 years non-continuously), becoming the honorary Father of the House.

He was created Baron Mendip, of Mendip in the County of Somerset, in 1794 in recognition of his governmental service. The peerage was created with remainder to the three eldest sons of his sister Anne by her husband Henry Agar, of Gowran and Gowran Castle.

==Personal life==

In 1738 he inherited a large fortune from his uncle, John Ellis and built Clifden House in Brentford.

He married firstly in 1747 Elizabeth, the daughter and heiress of Sir William Stanhope and secondly in 1765 Anne, the daughter of George Stanley of Paultons, Hampshire. Ellis nevertheless died childless in February 1802, aged 88, and was succeeded in the barony according to the special remainder by his great-nephew, Henry Welbore Agar, 2nd Viscount Clifden, who assumed the surname of Ellis two years later.

<text>Edinburgh IMP is a development of Atlas Autocode, initially developed around 1966-1969 at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. It is a general-purpose programming language which was used heavily for systems programming.

Expressively, IMP is highly similar to ALGOL and includes all the ALGOL-style block structure, reserved words (keywords), and data types such as arrays, and records. It adds to ALGOL-style languages a string type (an array of characters, although these have a predeclared size) and built-in operators for string manipulation and character handling. One significant difference from ALGOL is that IMP does not support parameters passed by name, although it does support parameters passed by reference.

IMP provides significant control over the storage mapping of data, plus commands for addressing within parts of words. Most IMP compilers offer compiler-generated runtime checks and a stack trace (backtrace) facility by default, even in production code. IMP allows inline assembler machine language instructions in source code.

The ERCC Implementation of IMP for the ICL System 4 (known as IMP9) offered a syntax-driven macro facility (designed by Alan Freeman) that was similar to the Compiler Compiler features offered by IMP&#x27;s predecessor, Atlas Autocode.

Early IMP compilers were developed for the English Electric KDF9, ICL System 4, UNIVAC 1108, IBM System/360, DEC PDP-9, DEC PDP-15 and CTL Modular One computers. IMP was used to implement the Edinburgh Multiple Access System (EMAS) operating system, and a compiler was written for the ICL 2900 series to allow porting of EMAS to that platform. In later years, a version of IMP named IMP77 was developed by Peter Robertson within the Computer Science department at Edinburgh which was a portable compiler that brought IMP to even more platforms. In 2002, the IMP77 language was resurrected by the Edinburgh Computer History Project for Intel x86 hardware running DOS, Windows, and Linux, and is once again in use by Edinburgh graduates and ex-pats.

The diverged IMP and IMP77 were later consolidated into one language with the introduction of the IMP80 standard, supported by implementations from the Edinburgh Regional Computer Centre. IMP80 has also been ported to several platforms including Intel and was actively in use into the 1990s.

Edinburgh IMP is unrelated to the later IMP syntax-extensible programming language developed by Edgar T. Irons, for the CDC 6600, which was the main language used by the National Security Agency (NSA) for many years.

<text>The Graduate Theological Union (GTU) is a consortium of eight private independent American theological schools and eleven centers and affiliates. Seven of the theological schools are located in Berkeley, California. The GTU was founded in 1962 and their students can take courses at the University of California, Berkeley. Additionally, some of the GTU consortial schools are part of other California universities such as Santa Clara University (Jesuit School of Theology) and California Lutheran University (Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary). Most of the GTU consortial schools are located in the Berkeley area with the majority north of the campus in a neighborhood known as &quot;Holy Hill&quot; due to the cluster of GTU seminaries and centers located there.

==History and administration==
Many of the GTU&#x27;s constituent seminaries were established at various locations throughout the Bay Area in the early 20th or even the late 19th centuries. Because of the foundation of the University of California, several of them relocated to Berkeley and established cooperative relationships with the university. In the wake of the formation of the World Council of Churches and the Second Vatican Council, Bay Area seminaries began negotiations to form a cooperative degree program. In 1962, agreement between the Berkeley Baptist Divinity School (now Berkeley School of Theology), Episcopalian Church Divinity School of the Pacific, Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary and San Francisco Theological Seminary enabled for the incorporation of the Graduate Theological Union in 1962. In 1964, the Pacific School of Religion, St. Albert&#x27;s College (now the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology) and Starr King School for the Ministry joined the GTU consortium. In 1966, Alma College relocated to Berkeley and was renamed the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley. In 1968, the Franciscan School of Theology moved to Berkeley from Santa Barbara and joined the GTU consortium, although in 2013 it merged with the University of San Diego, leaving the consortium and relocating to Oceanside, California. By 1971, the GTU was fully accredited by the Association of Theological Schools.

In 1969, the GTU common library was established and the individual libraries of the seminaries were merged into one collection. In the 1970s, construction began on a Louis I. Kahn-designed building to house the GTU library. The main library building was completed in 1987 and was named the Flora Lamson Hewlett Library in honor of the Hewlett Foundation.

==Academics==
The GTU offers the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree and the Master of Arts (MA) degree in cooperation with its member seminaries. GTU consortial seminaries variously offer Th.M., M.Div., Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.), S.T.B., S.T.L., and S.T.D. degrees. The GTU also offers non-degree certificates in Interreligious Chaplaincy and Interreligious Studies. Ph.D. students are encouraged not only to take advantage of the academic resources available to them at the University of California at Berkeley, but are also required to include a non-GTU scholar in their exams or dissertation committees. As such, students have collaborated with UCB faculty members in the anthropology, critical theory, ethnic studies, history, philosophy, sociology, etc. departments.

===Departments and certificate programs===
There are four doctoral departments, with more than 30 concentrations, encompassing the breadth of religious and theological scholarship at the GTU. The Sacred Texts and Interpretation department focuses on Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Rabbinic Literature, and studies in the sacred texts of Islamic and Hindu traditions. Historical and Cultural Studies of Religions encompasses studies in history of religions, art and religion, interreligious studies, and sociology of religion. Theology and Ethics focuses on theological and ethical reflections in the Christian, Jewish, Islamic, and Hindu traditions. Other concentrations include comparative theology/ethics, philosophical theology, theology and science, and aesthetics. Religion and Practice focuses on homiletics, liturgical studies, missiology, practical theology, and religious education. The GTU also offers certificates in specialized studies.

All degree seeking students at GTU may take any classes offered at the University of California, Berkeley, and have access and borrowing privileges at the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University libraries. Only Ph.D. students have unrestricted access to registering for UCB classes (subject to approval of course instructors). Cross-registration opportunities are also available at Dominican University of California, Holy Names University, and Mills College. Additionally, students can participate in international exchange programs.

===&quot;Berkeley Journal of Religion and Theology&quot;===
The GTU&#x27;s in-house academic journal is the &quot;Berkeley Journal of Religion and Theology&quot;. The journal is managed by current doctoral students, although peer-reviewers include members of the consortial doctoral faculty. All issues are available free online.

==Campus==
Although the GTU consortium occupies many buildings throughout the Bay Area, only three buildings are owned by the GTU. The largest of the buildings is the Flora Lamson Hewlett Library, one of the largest theological libraries in the world, with around 529,000 volumes.

<doc id="953436" wikidata="Q1258666" url="?curid=953436" title="Dressler syndrome">
<text>Dressler syndrome is a secondary form of pericarditis that occurs in the setting of injury to the heart or the pericardium (the outer lining of the heart). It consists of fever, pleuritic pain, pericarditis and/or pericardial effusion.

Dressler syndrome is also known as postmyocardial infarction syndrome and the term is sometimes used to refer to post-pericardiotomy pericarditis.

It was first characterized by William Dressler at Maimonides Medical Center in 1956.

It should not be confused with Dressler&#x27;s syndrome of haemoglobinuria named for Lucas Dressler, who characterized it in 1854.

==Presentation==
Dressler syndrome was historically a phenomenon complicating about 7% of myocardial infarctions, but in the era of percutaneous coronary intervention, it is very uncommon. The disease consists of persistent low-grade fever, chest pain (usually pleuritic), pericarditis (usually evidenced by a pericardial friction rub, chest pain worsening when recumbent, and diffuse ST elevation with PR segment depression), and/or pericardial effusion. The symptoms tend to occur 2–3 weeks after myocardial infarction but can also be delayed a few months. It tends to subside in a few days, and very rarely leads to pericardial tamponade. Elevated ESR is an objective but nonspecific laboratory finding.

==Causes==
It is believed to result from an autoimmune inflammatory reaction to myocardial neo-antigens formed as a result of the MI. Similar pericarditis can be associated with any pericardiotomy or trauma to the pericardium or heart surgery which is called a postcardiotomy syndrome.

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===
Dressler syndrome needs to be differentiated from pulmonary embolism, another identifiable cause of pleuritic (and non-pleuritic) chest pain in people who have been hospitalized and/or undergone surgical procedures within the preceding weeks. ischaemic heart disease.

==Treatment==
Dressler syndrome is best treated with high-dose aspirin. In some resistant cases, corticosteroids can be used but are not preferred (avoided) in the first month due to the high frequency of impaired ventricular healing leading to an increased rate of ventricular rupture. Other NSAIDs, though once used to treat Dressler syndrome, are less advocated and should be avoided in patients with ischemic heart disease. One NSAID in particular, indomethacin, can inhibit new collagen deposition, thus impairing the healing process for the infarcted region. Other NSAIDS should be used only in cases refractory to aspirin. Heparin should be avoided because it can lead to hemorrhage into the pericardial sac, leading to tamponade. The only time heparin could be used with pericarditis is with coexisting acute MI, in order to prevent further thrombus formation.

<text>Top7 is an artificial protein, classified as a &quot;de novo&quot; protein. This means that the protein itself was designed to have a specific structure and functional properties.

== Background ==
Top7 was designed by Brian Kuhlman and Gautam Dantas in David Baker&#x27;s laboratory at the University of Washington. Top7&#x27;s design was built through the use of a general computational method that repeated its sequence design and structure prediction. The end goal was to develop a 93-residue α/β protein with a new sequence and arrangement of its structure, or topology. These computational methods helped to design the proteins along with protein structure prediction algorithms.

The resulting sequence of residues is:

== Structure ==
Due to the de novo design, Top7 possesses a unique three-dimensional structure. The protein is described as a 93-residue α/β protein, which suggest that Top7 contains both alpha helices,α, and beta sheets, β, in its secondary structure. Overall, the structure consists of two alpha helices packed on a five-stranded anti-parallel beta sheet. The combination of alpha helices and beta sheets is seen commonly in protein structures; this contributes to the overall stability and functionality of the protein.

In order to achieve a target structure, researchers first developed a two-dimensional diagram and utilized it to determine the constraints that allowed them to construct the three-dimensional model of Top7. Determination of the high-resolution X-ray structure of the experimentally expressed and purified protein revealed that the structure (PDB: 1QYS) was indeed very similar (1.2 Å RMSD) to the computer-designed model.

== Characterization ==
Researchers used a variety of biophysical methods in order to characterize the Top7 protein. These processes were able to define certain characteristics to describe the protein. Gel filtration chromatography was used to determined that Top7 is monomeric and is highly soluble. It was also discovered that an increase in temperature allows the protein to unfold cooperatively and displays cold denaturation. Crystallization trials with Top7 design resulted in negligible differences in nuclear magnetic resonance therefore the design model exhibited a structure very similar to the true structure. Structure-Based models were used to further studying folding characteristics of Top7.

Through these analyzes, it was determined that the Top7 protein is extremely stable.

== Folding kinetics ==
Top7 exhibits non-cooperative folding behavior. Many naturally occurring proteins display cooperative folding, indicating that the whole structure folds in a coordinated procedure. In contrast, the folding of Top7 does not follow a smooth, single phase process. Its non-cooperative characteristic may be linked to its designed sequence, which promotes the formation of an independently folded C-terminal intermediate structure. Studies found that mutations in C-terminal as well as N-terminal of the amino acid sequence of a base model prove that there is a probable sequence of Top7 that allows fold cooperative folding.

== Implications ==
The creation of the de novo protein Top7 showcases the capability of computational methods in creating proteins with specific three-dimensional structures. This has broad implications for advancing the field of computational protein design and provides a platform for the creation of novel biomolecules with desired properties. The stability and folding characteristics of Top7 provide insights into the relationship between sequence, structure, and folding cooperativity. Understanding these principles can contribute to the development of more stable and functional proteins not derived from natural evolution.

Top7 was featured as the RCSB Protein Data Bank&#x27;s &#x27;Molecule of the Month&#x27; in October 2005, and a superposition of the respective cores (residues 60-79) of its predicted and X-ray crystal structures are featured in the Rosetta@home logo.

<doc id="953449" wikidata="Q3511598" url="?curid=953449" title="Súmate">
<text>Súmate (Spanish for &quot;Join Up&quot;) is a Venezuelan volunteer civil association founded in 2002 by María Corina Machado and Alejandro Plaz. &quot;Súmate&quot; describes itself as a vote-monitoring group; it has also been described as an election-monitoring group.

==Mission and values==
&quot;Súmate&quot; is a non-governmental organization (NGO) whose stated aim is to promote the free exercise of citizen&#x27;s political rights, and the discussion of matters of public interest. The group&#x27;s mission is to promote, defend, facilitate, and back the political rights accorded to citizens by the Constitution of Venezuela.

&quot;Súmate&#x27;s&quot; espoused values are:
* The guarantee of civil and political freedom and rights
* Impartial and independent citizen participation in democratic processes
* Professional volunteerism with a high level of citizen participation
* Organizational transparency and efficacy

Other projects are the consolidation of a national network of volunteers; analysis of voter registration; planning and execution of parallel vote counts to strengthen confidence in electoral processes; and educational programs.

== History ==

Hugo Chávez was elected President of Venezuela in 1998. Participation was 64%, with 36% of the electorate abstaining, resulting in a Chávez victory with 35% of the total electorate. In 1999, a new Constitution of Venezuela was approved, making Chávez eligible to run for president again in 2000, for a six-year term; and again in 2006, for another six years. This could result in a Chávez presidency of 14 years, compared to the previous presidential term limit of five years. He won the 2000 election with 60% of the votes cast, 33% of the total electorate, and 44% abstention.

These changes were made to the Constitution and electoral processes based on elections with an overwhelmingly support for Chávez but unprecedented voter abstention—a &quot;poor showing&quot; with most staying away from the polls.


&quot;Súmate&quot; was founded with an expressed goal of achieving a high level of citizen participation in Venezuelan elections. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Machado and Plaz had a hurried encounter in a hotel lobby in 2001, where they shared their concern about the course that was being shaped for Venezuela. Machado said, &quot;Something clicked. I had this unsettling feeling that I could not stay at home and watch the country get polarized and collapse... We had to keep the electoral process but change the course, to give Venezuelans the chance to count ourselves, to dissipate tensions before they built up. It was a choice of ballots over bullets.&quot; According to Súmate, it is &quot;not concerned with who governs but rather that those in power respect the rule of law.&quot; &quot;Súmate&quot; was originally composed of a group of professionals, but by 2004 it grew to include 30,000 volunteers from across Venezuela and all walks of life.

===Recall referendum, 2004===
In 2003, &quot;Súmate&quot; organized a campaign to force a recall referendum revoking the remainder of the term in office of President Chávez, as provided for under Article 72 of the Constitution of Venezuela, which permits citizens to request a recall if signatures are collected from 20% of the electorate.

The recall vote was held on 15 August 2004. A record number of voters turned out but the recall was defeated with a 59% &quot;no&quot; vote. The Carter Center concluded the results were accurate, but European Union observers did not oversee the referendum, saying too many restrictions were put on their participation by the government.

An exit poll by US company Penn, Schoen &amp; Berland Associates (PSB) predicted that Chávez would lose by 20%, whereas the election results showed him to have won by 20%. Schoen commented, &quot;I think it was a massive fraud&quot;. PSB used &quot;Súmate&quot; personnel as fieldworkers. Publication or broadcast of exit polls was banned by electoral authorities, but results of the PSB poll went out to media outlets and opposition offices several hours before polls closed. Jimmy Carter said that Súmate &quot;deliberately distributed this erroneous exit poll data in order to build up, not only the expectation of victory, but also to influence the people still standing in line&quot;.

Following the recall vote, &quot;Súmate&quot; requested that Ricardo Hausmann of Harvard University and Roberto Rigobón of MIT perform a statistical analysis analyzing how fraud could have occurred during the referendum. They concluded that the vote samples audited by the government were not a random representation of all precincts and that opposition witnesses and international observers were not allowed near the computer hub on election day. CEPR, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington, reports that other economists have called the Harvard/MIT assumptions about how fraud was conducted unlikely.

Chávez branded the leaders of Súmate as &quot;conspirators&quot;, &quot;coup plotters&quot; and &quot;lackeys of the U.S. government&quot;. After the referendum, members of &quot;Súmate&quot; were charged with treason and conspiracy, under Article 132 of the Venezuelan Penal Code, accused of receiving financial support for their activities from the NED. The trial has been postponed several times.

The criminal charges triggered concern from Human Rights Watch and the World Movement for Democracy. The latter accused the government of Venezuela of illegally &quot;withholding case files from the defendants, using depositions of the defendants that were made before the charges against them were known, and refusing to accede to requests of the Supreme Court in the case.&quot; Tom Casey, acting spokesman for the State Department, expressed disappointment about the court&#x27;s decision to try the founders and said the charges were &quot;without merit.&quot;

Over 70 individuals, including prominent world leaders, wrote to Chávez on 11 November 2004, pointing out that &quot;proceeding against nongovernmental organizations for receiving democratic assistance is a violation of both the Inter-American Democratic Charter and the Warsaw Declaration of the Community of Democracies, a document your government signed along with over 100 others four years ago.&quot; The letter indicated that the prosecution, &quot;as well as the proposal to criminalize democracy assistance from abroad&quot; are both &quot;clearly inconsistent with international democratic norms and constitute a grave threat to democracy.&quot; Signatories of the letter included Czech President Václav Havel, former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, U.S. Senator John McCain, former Canadian Prime Minister Kim Campbell, former Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro, former Prime Minister of Bulgaria Philip Dimitrov, and Richard Goldstone, former prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

A 2008 Human Rights Watch report expressed concern at the gravity of the charges sought by the prosecution against Súmate, saying that the sought a conviction for the crime of “conspiracy to destroy the nation’s republican form of government,” for a maximum 16-year prison sentence. The report explained that both Súmate and the NED insisted that the funds, a total of $53 400 US dollars, were not used for electoral activities but rather to educate people about the recall referendum, and arguing that even if it supported electoral activity, &quot;the recall referendum was itself a legal process envisaged in the 1999 Constitution&quot; and &quot;not an act of subversion&quot;. The report continues saying that in July 2005 a court in Caracas ordered a trial for its Vice President María Corina Machado, her colleague Alejandro Plaz, as well as Luis Enrique Palacios and Ricardo Estévez. In February 2006, the report says, the process was suspended, after the court of appeals ruled that the trial judge had committed due process violations, including refusing to empanel a jury or to allow key defense witnesses to testify, including the NED directors. The report concludes saying that the appeals court ordered a new jury trial, but that it had been postponed repeatedly and that by 2008, after three years, the process against the NGO was still open.

===Presidential elections, 2006===

&quot;Súmate&quot; recommended procedures for a primary, to be held on 13 August 2006, to choose the opposition candidate for the 3 December 2006 presidential elections. Teodoro Petkoff, a Chávez critic, said that &quot;Súmate&#x27;s&quot; procedure was authoritarian, comparing it to the Carmona Decree. Nine other candidates agreed to the terms for holding a primary, confirming their desire to allow the citizens to choose the opposition candidate. Another candidate condemned Petkoff&#x27;s remarks against &quot;Súmate&quot;, saying that Petkoff&#x27;s statements didn&#x27;t help the country, and explaining that the conditions for holding a primary had been previously discussed between all of the candidates, including Petkoff. On 9 August, Súmate announced that the 13 August primary election would not be held, since the candidates had decided to back Manuel Rosales as the single opposition candidate. Machado said that the primary &quot;initiative accomplished its goal and that Súmate would continue working to ensure clean elections and respect for citizens&#x27; rights.&quot;

On 8 December 2006, Súmate announced that their count and audits of the final election results matched the official count of the Venezuelan National Electoral Council, that showed a landslide victory for Hugo Chávez, highlighting that &quot;balloting was not clean, transparent or reliable.&quot; Machado said the government had stacked the odds against the opposition in the pre-election period, including &quot;a climate of collective intimidation&quot; due to the use of fingerprint-reading machines and an unaudited register of voters, and that if irregularities had been corrected, they could have impacted the final result. She clarified that the impact could not be assessed, saying &quot;We will know only the truth about what Venezuelans really feel, the day when clean elections are held in Venezuela.&quot;

==Personnel==
Plaz is a Venezuelan engineer and management consultant, who holds three master&#x27;s degrees (two from Stanford University), and was a Senior partner for McKinsey &amp; Company in Latin America, before taking a leave of absence to co-found &quot;Súmate&quot;. Machado was hailed as &quot;the best of womankind and the difficult times many women face around the globe&quot; on a list of &quot;Women the World Should Know&quot; for International Women&#x27;s Day.

Ricardo Estévez is one of the founders of Súmate. In 2012 he withdrew from Súmate in order to run for the position of rector of the Consejo Nacional Electoral as an independent.
