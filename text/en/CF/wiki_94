<text>The lesser silver water beetle (&quot;Hydrochara caraboides&quot;) is a species of water scavenger beetle (family Hydrophilidae).

==Description==
The beetle is about long and, despite the name, is actually black in color. It traps air with the hairs on the underside of its body in order to breathe below water, and it is this silver looking bubble of air that gives the beetle its name.

==Distribution==
&quot;H. caraboides&quot; has a wide distribution across Europe. In the United Kingdom, it is only found in the Somerset Levels, Cheshire and north-east Wales. It is classified as an endangered species, protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

The northern population cluster currently consists of around 45 breeding pools, several being ditches, most of which have a floating raft of densely matted vegetation at their centre, and an area of shallow open water containing isolated stands of emergent vegetation. The effect from cattle poaching is considered crucial for the beetle&#x27;s ability to breed successfully at these water bodies.

<text>Petržalka (; ; ) is the largest borough of Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. Situated on the right bank of the river Danube, the area shares a land border with Austria, and is home to around 100,000 people.

==Names and etymology==
The German name of the village &quot;Engerau&quot; (1654) derives from the ethnic name of Hungarians and comes from older placenames &quot;Mogorsciget&quot; (&quot;Hungarian Island&quot;, 1225) and &quot;Ungerau&quot; (&quot;Hungarian floodplain&quot;, 1509). The Hungarian name, &quot;Ligetfalva&quot;, (later Pozsonyligetfalu, literally &quot;parkland village&quot;) originates from the 1860s. After the foundation of Czechoslovakia, it was officially renamed to &quot;Petržalka&quot; (1920). The name refers to vegetables and herbs that were grown there (&quot;petržlen&quot; means &quot;parsley&quot;).

==History==

Before the 18th century, the territory of present-day Petržalka consisted of several regularly flooded islands and was not suitable for larger permanent settlement. The deed of donation of Andrew II of Hungary (1225) mentions a property &quot;Wlocendorf&quot;/&quot;Fluecendorf&quot;, abandoned village of Pechenegs and several local place names including the &quot;Peceneg Island&quot; (&quot;Beseneusciget&quot;, now national protected area &quot;Pečniansky les&quot;) and the &quot;Magyar Island&quot; (&quot;Mogorsciget&quot;). Pecheneg mercenaries on guard duty near the river Danube were probably the first permanent settlers, but the ford was protected also by other ethnic groups like Székelys and Ruthenians. The abandoned village of Pecenegs (or the neighboring territory) was settled most likely by German colonists. The inhabitants of &quot;Flocendorf&quot; were ferrymen, tradesmen and farmers. In the late 15th century, a new village &quot;Ungerau&quot;/&quot;Engerau&quot; was founded. The village was inhabited mostly by Germans and Croatians fleeing from the south during the Ottoman wars. During this period, the neighbouring Pressburg (Pozsony, today Bratislava) was the capital of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.

In the 18th century, the villages began to merge, but their population remained relatively low. It became a popular recreation area with the oldest public park in Central Europe (now Sad Janka Kráľa, founded in 1776). In 1866, the village had only 594 inhabitants and 103 houses. In 1891, it became permanently connected with Pressburg when the first railway bridge, 460 meters long, was built for the Pressburg-Csorna-Szombathely railway as the first bridge not made of wood, those wooden bridges often damaged by frost and floods. A 1910 census shows that of its 2,947 inhabitants, 1,997 spoke German, 495 spoke Hungarian, and 318 spoke Slovak as their native language.

On 1 January 1919, the Czechoslovak Legions captured Pressburg (then Bratislava). At the beginning of August, Czechoslovakia got permission to correct the borders for the strategic reasons, mainly to secure the port and to prevent a potential attack of the Hungarian Army on the town. On the night of 14 August 1919 barefoot Czechoslovak soldiers silently climbed to the Hungarian side of the bridge, captured the guards and annexed Petržalka without a fight. The Paris Peace Conference finally assigned the area to Czechoslovakia with the aim of creating a bridgehead for the newly created Czechoslovak state for controlling the Danube. In the 1920s Petržalka was the largest village in Czechoslovakia. During the Czechoslovak rule Petržalka grew quickly and the population increased from 3,576 (1919) to 14,164 (1930). The village lost its former ethnic German majority.

Petržalka was annexed by Nazi Germany on 10 October 1938 on the basis of the Munich agreement and renamed &quot;Engerau&quot;. The Starý most bridge becomes a border bridge between the First Slovak Republic and Nazi Germany. Several thousand inhabitants of Slovak, Czech, and Hungarian ethnicity were obliged to stay in Petržalka. Although citizens of the Third Reich, their national character was repressed. The occupiers closed down all Slovak schools, and the German language replaced Slovak. Non-Germans were not allowed to participate in public life, and the Gestapo arrested citizens who promoted ideas opposing Nazism, including those active before the occupation.

From November 1944 to March 1945 – Petržalka (&quot;Engerau&quot;) was the site of a labour camp for Hungarian Jews, who were deployed at the construction of the Südostwall. Out of 2000 prisoners, at least 497 died from inhumane treatment and during the death march to Bad Deutsch-Altenburg. 

On April 4, 1945 Petržalka was, along with the rest of Bratislava, freed from the Nazis and taken by the Communists. It was returned to Czechoslovakia after World War II. On May 5, 1945, 90% of the Hungarian population of Bratislava was forced into internment camps in Petržalka; at least 2500 Hungarians, including 71 children were murdered.

On February 13, 1946 Petržalka officially became a part of Bratislava. Construction of the housing blocks known as &quot;panelák&quot; began in 1977.

A 2001 Census reports that of its 117,227 inhabitants, 108,600 were Slovak, 4,259 were Hungarian, 1,788 were Czech, and 219 were German.

==Local parts==

Petržalka is divided into three official parts, &quot;Dvory&quot;, &quot;Lúky&quot; and &quot;Háje&quot;, and further into unofficial parts, &quot;Ovsište&quot;, &quot;Janíkov dvor&quot;, &quot;Kopčany&quot;, &quot;Zrkadlový háj&quot;, &quot;Starý háj&quot;, and &quot;Kapitulský dvor&quot;.

==Characteristics==
As of 2008, Petržalka is connected to Bratislava by five bridges. It is the most densely populated residential district in Central Europe.

Petržalka is primarily a residential area, with most people living in blocks of flats called &quot;paneláks&quot;, a neologism for buildings built from concrete panels joined together to form the structure, which were widely deployed throughout the Eastern Bloc during the communist era. As the borough was built primarily as a residential area, it has no clearly defined centre.

Petržalka was sometimes referred to as the Bronx of Bratislava because of a high crime rate and drug dealing, but as of 2008 the crime rate had become similar to that of the other boroughs. It has the highest suicide rate in the country.

Important institutions include the congress and exposition centre Incheba and Petržalka railway station. Sad Janka Kráľa is one of the oldest municipal parks in Europe. There is also the Arena Theatre, established in 1828, one of the oldest theatres in Bratislava.

Petržalka is mostly a lowland area with no hills or mountains. There are two lakes, Malý and Veľký Draždiak, which are used for swimming, fishing and leisure activities.

==Education and sport==
The University of Economics is based in Petržalka, with campuses situated in different locations around Bratislava.

There are 11 elementary schools and 19 kindergartens administered by the borough. Gymnasium high schools include the state-administered Albert Einstein and Pankúchova 6 gymnasiums and the private Mercury Gymnasium. Petržalka is also a home to Evanjelické lýceum - lutheran educational institution that played important part in development of slovak culture and national identity.

The borough is also known for its football club, Artmedia Bratislava, a participant in the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League.

==Transport==
===Road===
Petržalka is connected to the rest of Bratislava by five bridges, of which three are used for local traffic (Nový Most, Starý most and Most Apollo) and two for international traffic (Lafranconi Bridge and Prístavný most). Starý most, from the first of January 2009, was closed to all traffic except for public transport, bicycles and pedestrians.

Petržalka is located near a major international motorway junction, where the D1 and D2 motorways meet.

There is a road border crossing into Austria along Viedenska cesta near the intersection of the D1 and D2. The Austrian crossing is called Berg after the nearby town of the same name. There are no more border checks from December 21, 2007 with Slovakia joining the Schengen Area.

===Railway===
Bratislava-Petržalka railway station is located in the western part of the borough and is used primarily for international traffic and, since 1999, for trains to and from Vienna.

===Public transportation===
Buses connect Petržalka with the other boroughs. In 1989, construction of a subway began, but it was stopped shortly after the Velvet Revolution broke out. Instead, a high-speed tram (light rail) line was planned but its construction was postponed multiple times because it involved a complete reconstruction of Starý most bridge. At one point it was scheduled to begin in summer 2013. Test runs of trams across the bridge were carried out in February 2016. Official tram operation started on 8 July 2016.

<doc id="970579" wikidata="Q6979893" url="?curid=970579" title="Nationwide Urban Runoff Program">
<text>The Nationwide Urban Runoff Program (NURP) was a research project conducted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) between 1979 and 1983. It was the first comprehensive study of urban stormwater pollution across the United States.

==Study objectives==
The principal focus areas of the study consisted of:
* Examine the water quality aspects of urban runoff, and a comparison of results across various urban sites
* Assess the impact of urban runoff on overall water quality
* Implement stormwater management best practices.

A major component of the project was an analysis of water samples collected during 2,300 storms in 28 major metropolitan areas.

==Findings==
Among the conclusions of the report are the following:
* &quot;Heavy metals (especially copper, lead and zinc) are by far the most prevalent priority pollutant constituents found in urban runoff...Copper is suggested to be the most significant [threat] of the three.&quot;
* &quot;Coliform bacteria are present at high levels in urban runoff.&quot;
* &quot;Nutrients are generally present in urban runoff, but... [generally] concentrations do not appear to be high in comparison with other possible discharges.&quot;
* &quot;Oxygen demanding substances are present in urban runoff at concentrations approximating those in secondary treatment plant discharges.&quot;
* &quot;The physical aspects of urban runoff, e.g. erosion and scour, can be a significant cause of habitat disruption and can affect the type of fishery present.&quot;
* &quot;Detention basins... [and] recharge devices are capable of providing very effective removal of pollutants in urban runoff.&quot;
* &quot;Wet basins (designs which maintain a permanent water pool) have the greatest performance capabilities.&quot;
* &quot;Wetlands are considered to be a promising technique for control of urban runoff quality.&quot;

An interesting finding of the NURP was that street sweeping was considered to be, &quot;ineffective as a technique for improving the quality of urban runoff&quot;.

===Impact of the report===
In 1987, the results of the report were used as the basis of an amendment to the Clean Water Act requiring local governments and industry to address the pollution sources indicated by the report. The amendment requires all industrial stormwater dischargers (including many construction sites) and municipal storm sewer systems, affecting virtually all cities and towns in the country, to obtain discharge permits. EPA published national stormwater regulations in 1990 and 1999. EPA and state agencies began issuing stormwater permits in 1991. &quot;See&quot; Stormwater management permits.

==About &quot;NURP ponds&quot;==
The term &quot;NURP ponds&quot; refers to retention basins (also called &quot;wet ponds&quot;) that capture sediment from stormwater runoff as it is detained, and that are designed to perform to the level of the more effective ponds observed in the NURP studies. Some practitioners may assume that a &quot;NURP pond&quot; design conforms to some particular standard issued by EPA, but in fact EPA has issued no regulations or other requirements regarding the design of stormwater ponds. (However, some states and municipalities have issued stormwater design manuals, and these publications may include a reference to a &quot;NURP pond&quot;.)

<text>Carlos Federico Ruckauf (; born July 10, 1944) is a Peronist politician in Argentina, member of the Justicialist Party. He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from January 2002 to March 2003. He had earlier served as Vice-President of Argentina from 1995 to 1999, with Carlos Menem, and as his Interior Minister during his first administration. He was twice elected to the National Assembly following the restoration of democratic rule. In his early career, he was appointed a labor court judge, followed by Minister of Labor in July 1974.

==Early life and education==
Carlos Federico Ruckauf was born in the western Buenos Aires suburb of Ramos Mejía. His parents separated when he was seven, and he lived in Mar del Plata, Salta, and Buenos Aires during the remainder of his childhood. Ruckauf enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires, and earned a &quot;juris doctor&quot; in 1967. He was hired as a fingerprint analyst by an insurance company, and was elected Adjunct Secretary of the Insurance Employees&#x27; Union, a member union of the CGT, in 1969. He married María Isabel Zapatero, and they had three children.
==Political career==
Through associations at CGT, Ruckauf became a close ally of Lorenzo Miguel, leader of the Steelworkers&#x27; Union. With the return of Peronists to power in 1973, he was appointed to the bench as a labor court judge.

Following a cabinet reshuffle in the wake of the &quot;Rodrigazo&quot; crisis, Miguel recommended him to President Isabel Perón for the post of Minister of Labour in July 1974, following her succession to office after the death of Juan Perón. During his tenure, Ruckauf signed decree 261/75 on October 6, 1974. It granted blanket amnesty to the Armed Forces for the &quot;annihilation of subversives&quot;. It is considered an important early milestone in what would become the state&#x27;s &quot;Dirty War&quot; against political dissidents. Ruckauf was later accused of being responsible for the &quot;disappearance&quot; of 14 Mercedes-Benz workers in 1975. He remained in office until the March 1976 coup by the military.

Unlike many others in Peron&#x27;s government, he escaped arrest, allegedly with the support of Admiral Eduardo Massera, through a Federal Police official, Ramón Ramírez.

==Restoration of democracy==
Following the restoration of democratic rule in 1983, Carlos Ruckauf was elected as president of the Buenos Aires City chapter of the Justicialist Party.

Elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 1987, he was designated Ambassador plenipotentiary of Argentina in Italy, Malta and the FAO by the newly elected President Carlos Saúl Menem in 1989, serving as ambassador until 1991.

He was returned by voters to Congress in 1991, and named Interior Minister by Menem on March 1, 1993. Relatives of the victims of the 1994 AMIA bombing later put his role during the crisis into question. He was nominated as Menem&#x27;s running-mate for the 1995 reelection campaign, and served as Vice-President of Argentina from 1995 to 1999.

Elected Governor of Buenos Aires Province in 1999, he issued the provincial Patacón bonds in August 2001 to deal with the scarcity of Argentine pesos when the 2001 Argentine economic crisis entered its most acute phase. The new president appointed by a crisis meeting of Congress, Eduardo Duhalde, named Ruckauf as Foreign Minister on January 2, 2002. He served in that position until May 25, 2003, when the Duhalde government left office.

Later in 2003 Ruckauf was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies for Buenos Aires Province. He sat in the center-right Federal Peronism caucus opposed to the government of Néstor Kirchner, until leaving Congress in 2007.

<text>The Norwegian Elkhound is one of the Northern Spitz-type breeds of dog and is the National Dog of Norway. The Elkhound has served as a hunter, guardian, herder, and defender. It is known for its courage in tracking and hunting moose and other large game, such as bears or wolves. The Norwegian Elkhound was first presented at a dog exhibition in Norway in 1877.

The Norwegian name of the breed is . The breed&#x27;s object in the hunt is to independently track down and hold the moose at bay—jumping in and out toward the moose, distracting its attention, while signaling to the hunters by barking very loudly—until the hunter who follows the sound can arrive to shoot it. The dog will only bark while the moose is stationary, but it can also slowly drive the elk or moose towards shooters lying in wait. The Norwegian Elkhound is also used on a leash. In this mode of hunting, the dog leads the hunter in the direction of the elk or moose while keeping quiet.

==Lineage==
The breed falls under the mitochondrial DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia. It is the result of a female wolf-male dog hybridization that occurred post-domestication. Subclade d1 originated &quot;at most 480–3,000 years ago&quot; and includes all Sami-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Jämthund, Norwegian Elkhound and Hällefors Elkhound. The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to these breeds has not been matched across Eurasia&quot;

==Description==

===Appearance===

According to The Kennel Club breed standard ideally the dog stands about high and weighs up to . Its grey, white, and black coat is made up of two layers: an underlying dense smooth coat ranging from black at the muzzle, ears, and tip of its tail to silvery grey on its legs, tail, and underbody and an overlying black-tipped protective guard coat. An ideal Elkhound has a tightly curled tail. The Elkhound is a medium-sized dog and extremely hardy.

===Temperament===

Norwegian Elkhounds are bred for hunting large game, such as wolf, bear and moose. Although the breed is strong and hardy, the dogs typically have an inseparable bond with their masters and are quite loyal. All Elkhounds have a sharp loud bark which makes them suitable as watchdogs.

Norwegian Elkhounds are loyal to their &quot;pack&quot; and make excellent family dogs given proper attention. They are bold, playful, independent, alert, extremely intelligent, and, at times, a bit boisterous. They rank 36th in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, being of above average working/obedience intelligence.

== Health ==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.9 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Norwegian Elkhounds are prone to an inherited abnormality that causes primary renal glucosuria via reducing the functional capacity of the tubular epithelial cells to reabsorb glucose; this disorder further predisposes them to lower urinary tract bacterial infections.

Norwegian Elkhounds are also predisposed to dioestrous &amp; gestational diabetes, progesterone-related forms of diabetes mellitus.

A form of inherited chondrodysplasia has been described in the Norwegian Elkhound since the 1980s. Symptoms include curvature of the forelimbs, carpal valgus, retarded ossification, and a shortening of the vertebral body. Researchers from Finland identified the cause to be a recessive nonsense mutation in the ITGA10 gene.

The Norwegian Elkhound is one of the more commonly affected breeds for primary open angle glaucoma. An autosomal recessive mutation in the ADAMTS10 gene is responsible for the condition in the breed.

==History==
The Norwegian Elkhound has its origins in Sweden where it has always been highly prized as a hunting dog. It is 98% genetical identical to the Jämthund and share the same roots being from Jämtland and Norrland (Northern Sweden). It was rarely seen or bred outside of Norway until its appearance in England in the 19th century. It was officially recognized by The Kennel Club in 1901.

<text>Hidipo Livius Hamutenya (17 June 1939 – 6 October 2016) was a Namibian politician. Veteran politician Hidipo Hamutenya died at 77 after a short illness. A long-time leading member of the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO), Hamutenya was a member of the Cabinet of Namibia from independence in 1990 to 2004, serving in several important ministerial portfolios. He was defeated in a bid for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination in 2004 and left SWAPO to form an opposition group, the Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP), in 2007. He was elected to the National Assembly of Namibia with RDP in the 2009 general election. He was forced to step down as RDP president on 28 February 2015 and rejoined SWAPO on 28 August 2015.

==Early life and education==
Hidipo Livius Hamutenya was born in Odibo in the Ohangwena Region of northern Namibia. His father, Aaron Hamutenya, was a founding member of SWAPO. Hamutenya attended primary school at Odibo and Engela and then participated at the Augustineum Teachers Training College in Okahandja from 1959 to 1961. He met other political activists there and participated when the 1959 Old Location Uprising spilled over from Windhoek to Augustine. At the end of 1961, aged 22, he went to Tanzania into exile.

He studied journalism at Sofia University in Bulgaria. Then he stayed in the United States, where he obtained a BA in political science and history from Lincoln University, Pennsylvania, and a PD in development studies from Syracuse University, both in 1969. In 1971 Hamutenya graduated from McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, with an MA.

==Political career==
Hamutenya served as SWAPO&#x27;s representative to the Americas from 1965 to 1972 and as SWAPO&#x27;s secretary for education from 1974 to 1976. He joined the SWAPO politburo in August 1976, and at the same time he was a founding member of the United Nations Institute for Namibia (UNIN) in Lusaka; at the UNIN, Hamutenya was deputy director and head of the History and Political Science department from 1976 to 1981. From 1978 to 1989, he was part of SWAPO&#x27;s negotiating team for the UN Plan for Namibian independence, and he was SWAPO&#x27;s secretary of information and publicity from 1981 to 1991.

Immediately before independence, he was a SWAPO member of the Constituent Assembly, which was in place from November 1989 to March 1990, and when Namibia gained its independence in March 1990, he became a member of the National Assembly and the Minister of Information and Broadcasting. He served as Minister of Information and Broadcasting until April 15, 1993, when he was instead appointed Minister of Trade and Industry, trading posts with Ben Amathila. He remained in the latter position for nine years, until he became Minister of Foreign Affairs on 27 August 2002 in a cabinet reshuffle. Hamutenya made political upheavals in the second part of the new millennium when he left the Swapo party and founded the Rally for Democracy and Progress which performed well as a fledgling party in its first elections in 2009 by becoming the official opposition with 11,31 % of the vote against SWAPO&#x27;s 75,27 %

The RDP&#x27;s rapid advance was followed by an equally rapid plummet in the 2014 elections when it failed to make any inroads and lost the title of Official Opposition to the DTA of Namibia by attracting 3,51 % of the vote against SWAPO&#x27;s 80,01%. Hamutenya received the 13th highest number of votes—352—in the election to the Central Committee of SWAPO at the party&#x27;s August 2002 congress.

===Fall out with SWAPO===
In May 2004 Hamutenya sought SWAPO&#x27;s nomination as its candidate for the presidential election which took place later in 2004; his candidacy was proposed by Mosé Penaani Tjitendero and seconded by Hartmut Ruppel. As the leadership contest was underway, Hamutenya was dismissed from his position as foreign minister by President Sam Nujoma on 24 May, because Nujoma accused him of inciting division within the ranks of the party in the country&#x27;s Omaheke region. Hifikepunye Pohamba became the presidential candidate after two rounds of voting.

In November 2007, Hamutenya resigned from SWAPO and from his seat in the National Assembly, where he had served for 17 years. In the same month, he launched a new party, the Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP), together with another former minister, Jesaya Nyamu.

===2009 presidential campaign===
In November 2009, Hamutenya was the RDP&#x27;s candidate for President of Namibia. He finished in second place with 88,640 votes (10.91%) behind SWAPO candidate and incumbent president Hifikepunye Pohamba (75.25%). Hamutenya was placed at the top of the RDP&#x27;s electoral list and was one of eight RDP members elected to the National Assembly of Namibia.

In September 2010, Hamutenya and eight other opposition politicians were sworn in as members of the National Assembly following a six-month boycott due to electoral irregularities in the 2009 election.

The RDP performed poorly in the 2014 general election, and Hamutenya subsequently faced pressure from within the party to retire. He said in March 2015 that he was retiring, leaving the way open for the party to elect a new leader, although he shortly afterward claimed he had been forced to retire against his will. He attempted to claim a parliamentary seat when the National Assembly began meeting for its new term in March 2015 but later opted against taking a seat paving the way for his return to SWAPO.

==Death and legacy==
Hamutenya collapsed at a family wedding in September 2016. After several weeks in hospital, he died in the morning hours of 6 October.

Hidipo Hamutenya was one of the leading diplomats of the struggle for the independence of Namibia. He supervised the composition of Namibia&#x27;s national anthem, &quot;Namibia, Land of the Brave&quot; while serving as chairman of the National Symbols subcommittee. While Axali Doëseb is commonly credited with writing both its music and text, Hamutenya in 2006 claimed that he authored the lyrics himself. Doëseb denied the claim.

As Minister of Foreign Affairs portfolio, he was the first to engage in economic diplomacy for Namibia. Hamutenya was buried at Heroes&#x27; Acre in Windhoek.

==Awards==
* African Personality of the Year (2003), awarded by fDi, a subsidiary of the Financial Times for &quot;his efforts to bring in foreign investment&quot; during his tenure as Minister of Foreign Affairs

<text>The Bonfires of Saint John (, ) are a traditional and popular festival celebrated in the city of Alicante, Spain, from 19 to 24 June. The celebration ultimately stems from a tradition of bonfires for Saint John&#x27;s Eve that can be found in many places, among them the Mediterranean coast of Spain, especially Catalonia and the Valencian Community; in Alicante, it&#x27;s the official and most important festivity in the city. It was officially declared as a Fiesta of International Tourist Interest in 1983 and a Bien de Interés Cultural in 2014.

== Background ==
Midsummer eve festivals (St. John&#x27;s Eve among Christians) have roots in ancient celebrations related to the summer solstice. Bonfires were lit to protect against evil spirits which were believed to roam freely when the sun was turning southward again. In later years, witches were also thought to be on their way to meetings with other powerful beings. 

Fire features in many of the celebrations, with people gathering together and creating large bonfires from any kind of wood, such as old furniture, and sharing food and drinks while teens and children jump over the fires. Parties are often organized at open areas, such as beaches, where bonfires are lit and a set of firework displays usually take place. On the Spanish Mediterranean coast, especially in Catalonia and the Valencian Community, special foods such as &quot;coca de Sant Joan&quot; are also served on this occasion. In Alicante, since 1928, the bonfires of Saint John were developed into elaborate constructions inspired by the Fallas of Valencia.

==Celebration in Alicante==




=== Origins ===
Before 1928, the bonfires of Saint John had been celebrated in Alicante as it had been elsewhere in Europe: by burning old pieces of furniture on the night of Saint John on 24 June. The Bonfires festival in Alicante originated in 1928. Jose María Py, the founder of the festival, felt that Alicante needed an important fiesta, and came up with an idea to combine bonfires with an older Valencian tradition known as the &quot;fallas&quot;. 

===Events===
19 June
*The Bonfires start with the &#x27;Set Up&#x27; (&quot;la plantà&quot;) when monuments, street ninots and archways to the &quot;barraques&quot; are set up in the streets. A pie of tuna (&quot;coca amb tonyina&quot;) and early figs (&quot;bacores&quot;) are eaten at night.

 19–24 June
*The &quot;despertà&quot; occurs at 08:00 – Neighbours are awakened with a great deal of noise in all the districts of the city.
*The &quot;mascletà&quot; takes place at 14:00. It is a combination of fireworks and a very long string of firecrackers (bangers).
*At night, from 23:00 to 06:00 there are street parties in all the districts of the city. People dance and drink all night at the &quot;racós&quot; (sing. &quot;racó&quot;) and the &quot;barraques&quot; (sing. &quot;barraca&quot;).

21 June
*The Street Band Parade (&quot;Entrada de bandas&quot;) occurs at 19:00.

22 June
*At 11:30, the Prize Giving Parade (&quot;Desfilada entrega de premios&quot;) takes place
*At 19:00, the Flower Offering Parade for St Mary of the Remedy (&quot;Ofrenda de flores a la Virgen del Remedio&quot;) takes place.

In the three parades, people wear the traditional garments from Alicante, and, in the Flower Offering, women wear mantilla and they have a bunch of flowers.

23 June
*At 21:00, the International Folklore Parade (&quot;Desfile folklórico internacional&quot;) takes place.

24 June :
*At 24:00 (morning of 25 June), the Palm (firework) (&quot;La Palmera&quot;), occurs. This is a magnificent cascade of fireworks, and it is followed by the Burning (&quot;La Cremà&quot;), which is the culmination of the festival.

Before the main events, in the beginning of June, there are the Ninot and Children&#x27;s Ninot Exhibition (Exposición del Ninot y del Ninot infantil), the Paella Contest (Certamen de Paellas), the Tribute to Past Foguerers and Barraquers (Homenaje a Foguerers y Barraquers muertos), the Opening Ceremony (El Pregón), the Ninot Parade (Desfile del Ninot), and the Street Parade of Ninots competition (La plantà dels Ninots de Carrer).

After 24 June, there is the Firework Display Competition (&quot;Concurso de Castillos de Fuegos Artificiales&quot;) and the String of Firecrackers Display (&quot;Concurso de tracas&quot;) in Postiguet Beach. There are also sports events and a Medieval Street Market.

The Bonfires commissions host a number of other events during the rest of the year. In autumn, there is a musical and dancing competition known as the Artistic Competition (&quot;Concurso artístico). In December, there is the Christmas Carol Competition (&quot;Concurso Navideño&quot;). In May, there is the Beauty of the Fire Contest (&quot;Festival d’elecció de la Bellea del Foc&quot;), which is the most important event outside the festive period, followed by the Beauty of the Fire Proclamation (&quot;Proclamació de la Bellea del Foc&quot;). During the year, there are the Presentations of the Beauties in all the districts of Alicante.

===Organization===
Bonfires are organised into commissions which fundraise and host the other events throughout the year. A member of a commission is called a &quot;foguerer&quot;. A commission usually represents one area, a place or an avenue in the city, but there are many areas with numerous commissions. (For example, Carolinas has five commissions: Carolinas Altas, Carolines Bajas, Foguerer-Carolinas, Doctor Bergez-Carolinas and Bola de Oro.) In Alicante there are more than 90 commissions (and so many others for children).

A &quot;barraca&quot; is a group of friends who don&#x27;t take part in all the activities, and they raise money only to eat, drink and dance during the festival in a place in the street called the &quot;barraca&quot;. The member of a &quot;barraca&quot; is called &quot;barraquero&quot;.

The &quot;barracas&quot; and the &quot;racós&quot; are places in the street with tables, chairs, a bar, an orchestra and a dance floor. They are places for people to eat, talk, drink, dance and socializing during the festivities. The difference between the &quot;barraca&quot; and the &quot;racó&quot; is that the &quot;racó&quot; is for the entire district and admission is free, while entrance to the &quot;barraca&quot; is restricted. The &quot;racó&quot; is made by the &quot;foguerers&quot; and the &quot;barraca&quot; is made by the &quot;barraquers&quot;.

The commissions organize and take part in several events during the year: an artistic competition, parades, beauty contests, etc. These activities are open to the general public and the participation of the district&#x27;s residents is very important and, sometimes, they are the main group. In districts such as Ciudad de Asís, Florida Alta (or Florida Portazgo), Los Ángeles and Carolinas Altas, the relationship between the commission and the district&#x27;s residents is very strong.

A very important source of financing for the festival is a lottery administered by the commission, although there are other sources such as tombolas, raffles, or sales.

===Beauties===
Beauty is the most emblematic element in the Bonfires after the monument. The Beauty is a woman who is the queen of the festival . There are both Beauties and Infantile Beauties representing Bonfires and Infantile Bonfires respectively.

Since a Beauty is the representative of a particular commission, there are near 90 Beauties and so many Infantile Beauties in Alicante. A Beauty can have two or four Honour Ladies in her commission.

There are certain Honour Ladies for the whole city. The Beauty of the Fire (&quot;Bellea del Foc&quot;) is the queen of the festival in all the city and there are also six Ladies of the Fire (&quot;Dames del Foc&quot;).

===Clothes===
There are three types of traditional clothes:

Novia Alicantina (&quot;Alicantinian Bride&quot;): the costume that Beauties and Honour Ladies wear. It is made up of:
*A band in the hair
*A white and round mantilla
*A small lemon blossom bunch
*Two hangings
*A cross with jewellery around the neck
*A black, velvet, waist with long sleeves
*A fan
*A black apron with jewellery
*A long skirt
*A petticoat (sinagües)
*White stockings
*Black heels

Labradora (&quot;farmer&quot;): the costume for the other women. It is made up of:
*A band in the hair with flowers
*Two hangings
*A cross with a black ribbon in the neck
*A white piece called &quot;manteleta&quot;
*A waist made in colours
*A white apron
*A long skirt, the same of the Beauties
*A petticoat (sinagües)
*White stockings
*Black heels

Zaragüelles: the costume for the men. It is made up of:
*A scarf in the head or in the neck
*A cotton, white, shirt
*A blanket with pockets
*A long sash at the same colour that the scarf
*Full white trousers called &quot;zaragüelles&quot;
*White stockings
*Shoes called &quot;espardenyes&quot;

===Art: Monuments===
Bonfires are an art show. In autumn, there is an artistic competition among the Bonfire Commissioners. In the Festival, there are Ninots (wooden figures) in the street. This is an old tradition that was revived in 2008. Every year there is an Official Festival Poster, a beautiful art demonstration.
But the most important in this festival are the Monuments, who are called Bonfires (Fogueres). They are made of wood, cardboard, mud, paintings and, nowadays, of cork and polyurethane too. A Bonfire is not only an artistic creation, it is a critique of the societal, political and economic situation of the world in general and the city of Alicante especially. Critiques are made across the &quot;Ninot&quot; or figure. The Ninot usually represents a famous person, often an amusing parody of a politician.

The Bonfires are not the same as the Valencian Fallas. When Bonfires originated in Alicante there were not made by &quot;faller&quot; artists, and the first Bonfires were made by local painters and sculptors. They did not imitate the Valencian style; they were very vanguardist and they followed Art-Dèco and other artistic currents. This vanguard continued throughout the history of the event (except 70&#x27;s, when Valencian style was adopted), and today Bonfires are different still.

A Bonfire is paid for by contributions by the Bonfire Commission, together with donations from residents and shops. The Monument Competition is the most important contest in the Bonfire events. Monuments are divided into seven categories according to the price. There are 6 categories from 1st to 6th, and a Special Category. The latter category consists of more expensive bonfires costing more than 60,100 euros.

The most important artists throughout the Bonfire&#x27;s history are Gastón Castelló, Ramón Marco, Remigio Soler, Ángel Martín, Pedro Soriano, José Muñoz and Paco Juan. The most successful district is Benalúa, with 18 victories. Other successful districts are Ciudad de Asís, Carolinas Altas, Mercado Central, Alfonso el Sabio and Hernán Cortés.

Bonfires are kindled on the 20th in an act called &quot;La plantà&quot;, and they are burned on the 24th in a very beautiful and emotive act called &quot;La cremà&quot; (the burning). The former is the beginning of the Alicantinian Festival and the latter marks the end of the Festival.

<text>Prefabrication is the practice of assembling components of a structure in a factory or other manufacturing site, and transporting complete assemblies or sub-assemblies to the construction site where the structure is to be located. Some researchers refer it to “various materials joined together to form a component of the final installation procedure“. 

The most commonly cited definition is by Goodier and Gibb in 2007, which described the process of manufacturing and preassembly of a certain number of building components, modules, and elements before their shipment and installation on construction sites.

The term &quot;prefabrication&quot; also applies to the manufacturing of things other than structures at a fixed site. It is frequently used when fabrication of a section of a machine or any movable structure is shifted from the main manufacturing site to another location, and the section is supplied assembled and ready to fit. It is not generally used to refer to electrical or electronic components of a machine, or mechanical parts such as pumps, gearboxes and compressors which are usually supplied as separate items, but to sections of the body of the machine which in the past were fabricated with the whole machine. Prefabricated parts of the body of the machine may be called &#x27;sub-assemblies&#x27; to distinguish them from the other components.

==Process and theory==

An example from house-building illustrates the process of prefabrication. The conventional method of building a house is to transport bricks, timber, cement, sand, steel and construction aggregate, etc. to the site, and to construct the house on site from these materials. In prefabricated construction, only the foundations are constructed in this way, while sections of walls, floors and roof are prefabricated (assembled) in a factory (possibly with window and door frames included), transported to the site, lifted into place by a crane and bolted together.

Prefabrication is used in the manufacture of ships, aircraft and all kinds of vehicles and machines where sections previously assembled at the final point of manufacture are assembled elsewhere instead, before being delivered for final assembly.

The theory behind the method is that time and cost is saved if similar construction tasks can be grouped, and assembly line techniques can be employed in prefabrication at a location where skilled labour is available, while congestion at the assembly site, which wastes time, can be reduced. The method finds application particularly where the structure is composed of repeating units or forms, or where multiple copies of the same basic structure are being constructed. Prefabrication avoids the need to transport so many skilled workers to the construction site, and other restricting conditions such as a lack of power, lack of water, exposure to harsh weather or a hazardous environment are avoided. Against these advantages must be weighed the cost of transporting prefabricated sections and lifting them into position as they will usually be larger, more fragile and more difficult to handle than the materials and components of which they are made.

==History==

Prefabrication has been used since ancient times. For example, it is claimed that the world&#x27;s oldest known engineered roadway, the Sweet Track constructed in England around 3800 BC, employed prefabricated timber sections brought to the site rather than assembled on-site.

Sinhalese kings of ancient Sri Lanka have used prefabricated buildings technology to erect giant structures, which dates back as far as 2000 years, where some sections were prepared separately and then fitted together, specially in the Kingdom of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.

After the great Lisbon earthquake of 1755, the Portuguese capital, especially the Baixa district, was rebuilt by using prefabrication on an unprecedented scale. Under the guidance of Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, popularly known as the Marquis de Pombal, the most powerful royal minister of D. Jose I, a new Pombaline style of architecture and urban planning arose, which introduced early anti-seismic design features and innovative prefabricated construction methods, according to which large multistory buildings were entirely manufactured outside the city, transported in pieces and then assembled on site. The process, which lasted into the nineteenth century, lodged the city&#x27;s residents in safe new structures unheard-of before the quake.

Also in Portugal, the town of Vila Real de Santo António in the Algarve, founded on 30 December 1773, was quickly erected through the use of prefabricated materials en masse. The first of the prefabricated stones was laid in March 1774. By 13 May 1776, the centre of the town had been finished and was officially opened.

In 19th century Australia a large number of prefabricated houses were imported from the United Kingdom.
The method was widely used in the construction of prefabricated housing in the 20th century, such as in the United Kingdom as temporary housing for thousands of urban families &quot;bombed out&quot; during World War II. Assembling sections in factories saved time on-site and the lightness of the panels reduced the cost of foundations and assembly on site. Coloured concrete grey and with flat roofs, prefab houses were uninsulated and cold and life in a prefab acquired a certain stigma, but some London prefabs were occupied for much longer than the projected 10 years.

The Crystal Palace, erected in London in 1851, was a highly visible example of iron and glass prefabricated construction; it was followed on a smaller scale by Oxford Rewley Road railway station.

During World War II, prefabricated Cargo ships, designed to quickly replace ships sunk by Nazi U-boats became increasingly common. The most ubiquitous of these ships was the American Liberty ship, which reached production of over 2,000 units, averaging 3 per day.

==Current uses==

The most widely used form of prefabrication in building and civil engineering is the use of prefabricated concrete and prefabricated steel sections in structures where a particular part or form is repeated many times. It can be difficult to construct the formwork required to mould concrete components on site, and delivering wet concrete to the site before it starts to set requires precise time management. Pouring concrete sections in a factory brings the advantages of being able to re-use moulds and the concrete can be mixed on the spot without having to be transported to and pumped wet on a congested construction site. Prefabricating steel sections reduces on-site cutting and welding costs as well as the associated hazards.

Prefabrication techniques are used in the construction of apartment blocks, and housing developments with repeated housing units. Prefabrication is an essential part of the industrialization of construction. The quality of prefabricated housing units had increased to the point that they may not be distinguishable from traditionally built units to those that live in them. The technique is also used in office blocks, warehouses and factory buildings. Prefabricated steel and glass sections are widely used for the exterior of large buildings.

Detached houses, cottages, log cabin, saunas, etc. are also sold with prefabricated elements. Prefabrication of modular wall elements allows building of complex thermal insulation, window frame components, etc. on an assembly line, which tends to improve quality over on-site construction of each individual wall or frame. Wood construction in particular benefits from the improved quality. However, tradition often favors building by hand in many countries, and the image of prefab as a &quot;cheap&quot; method only slows its adoption. However, current practice already allows the modifying the floor plan according to the customer&#x27;s requirements and selecting the surfacing material, e.g. a personalized brick facade can be masoned even if the load-supporting elements are timber.

Today, prefabrication is used in various industries and construction sectors such as healthcare, retail, hospitality, education, and public administration, due to its many advantages and benefits over traditional on-site construction, such as reduced installation time and cost savings. Being used in single-story buildings as well as in multi-story projects and constructions. Providing the possibility of applying it to a specific part of the project or to the whole of it.

The efficiency and speed in the execution times of these works offer that, for example, in the case of the educational sector, it is possible to execute the projects without the cessation of the operations of the educational facilities during the development of the same.
Prefabrication saves engineering time on the construction site in civil engineering projects. This can be vital to the success of projects such as bridges and avalanche galleries, where weather conditions may only allow brief periods of construction. Prefabricated bridge elements and systems offer bridge designers and contractors significant advantages in terms of construction time, safety, environmental impact, constructibility, and cost. Prefabrication can also help minimize the impact on traffic from bridge building. Additionally, small, commonly used structures such as concrete pylons are in most cases prefabricated.

Radio towers for mobile phone and other services often consist of multiple prefabricated sections. Modern lattice towers and guyed masts are also commonly assembled of prefabricated elements.

Prefabrication has become widely used in the assembly of aircraft and spacecraft, with components such as wings and fuselage sections often being manufactured in different countries or states from the final assembly site. However, this is sometimes for political rather than commercial reasons, such as for Airbus.

==Advantages==
* Moving partial assemblies from a factory often costs less than moving pre-production resources to each site
* Deploying resources on-site can add costs; prefabricating assemblies can save costs by reducing on-site work
* Factory tools - jigs, cranes, conveyors, etc. - can make production faster and more precise
* Factory tools - shake tables, hydraulic testers, etc. - can offer added quality assurance
* Consistent indoor environments of factories eliminate most impacts of weather on production
* Cranes and reusable factory supports can allow shapes and sequences without expensive on-site falsework
* Higher-precision factory tools can aid more controlled movement of building heat and air, for lower energy consumption and healthier buildings
* Factory production can facilitate more optimal materials usage, recycling, noise capture, dust capture, etc.
* Machine-mediated parts movement, and freedom from wind and rain can improve construction safety
* Homogeneous manufacturing allows high standardization and quality control, ensuring quality requirements subject to performance and resistance tests, which also facilitate high scalability of construction projects. 
* The specific production processes in industrial assembly lines allow high sustainability, which enables savings of up to 20% of the total final cost, as well as considerable savings in indirect costs. 

==Disadvantages==
* Transportation costs may be higher for voluminous prefabricated sections (especially sections so big that they constitute oversize loads requiring special signage, escort vehicles, and temporary road closures) than for their constituent materials, which can often be packed more densely and are more likely to fit onto standard-sized vehicles.
* Large prefabricated sections may require heavy-duty cranes and precision measurement and handling to place in position.

== Off-site fabrication ==
Off-site fabrication is a process that incorporates prefabrication and pre-assembly. The process involves the design and manufacture of units or modules, usually remote from the work site, and the at the site to form the permanent works at the site. In its fullest sense, off-site fabrication requires a project strategy that will change the orientation of the project process from construction to manufacture to installation. Examples of off-site fabrication are wall panels for homes, wooden truss bridge spans, airport control stations.

There are four main categories of off-site fabrication, which is often also referred to as off-site construction. These can be described as component (or sub-assembly) systems, panelised systems, volumetric systems, and modular systems. Below these categories different branches, or technologies are being developed. There are a vast number of different systems on the market which fall into these categories and with recent advances in digital design such as building information modeling (BIM), the task of integrating these different systems into a construction project is becoming increasingly a &quot;digital&quot; management proposition.

The prefabricated construction market is booming. It is growing at an accelerated pace both in more established markets such as North America and Europe and in emerging economies such as the Asia-Pacific region (mainly China and India). Considerable growth is expected in the coming years, with the prefabricated modular construction market expected to grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 8% between 2022 and 2030. It is expected to reach USD 271 billion by 2030.

<doc id="970600" wikidata="Q1395516" url="?curid=970600" title="William H. Dana">
<text>William Harvey Dana (November 3, 1930 – May 6, 2014) was an American aeronautical engineer, U.S. Air Force pilot, NASA test pilot, and astronaut. He was one of twelve pilots who flew the North American X-15, an experimental spaceplane jointly operated by the Air Force and NASA. He was also selected for participation in the X-20 Dyna-Soar program.

On two separate flights, Dana flew the X-15 to an altitude above 50 miles, thereby qualifying as an astronaut according to the United States definition of the boundary of space; however, neither flight exceeded the Kármán line, the internationally accepted boundary of 100 kilometers (62 miles).

==Early life and education==
Dana was born in Pasadena, California on November 3, 1930. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Military Academy in 1952 and served four years as a pilot in the United States Air Force. He joined NASA on October 1, 1958, after receiving a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Southern California.

Dana married his wife Judi in 1962, and they had four children.

==Test pilot and astronaut career==

From 1960 through 1962 he was a pilot astronaut in the U.S. Air Force X-20 Dyna-Soar program. That program was canceled before the vehicle flew, but Dana later tested several other lifting-body space vehicle projects. He made one of the earliest flights in the plywood M2-F1, and flew the HL-10, the M2-F3, and the X-24B. He made the highest-ever flight in a lifting body, to 90,303 feet, in the HL-10. He also made the final powered flight of a lifting body, in the X-24B (1975).

Dana began as an engineer on the North American X-15 program. He progressed to chase pilot, and finally as project pilot on the hypersonic research aircraft. He flew the rocket-powered vehicle 16 times, reaching a top speed of 3,897 mph. His peak altitude of 307,000 feet (nearly 59 miles high) technically qualified him for the Astronaut Badge, although he was not formally recognized as an astronaut until 2005. He was the pilot on the final (199th) flight of the 10-year program.

In the late 1960s and in the 1970s, Dana was a project pilot on the manned lifting body program, which flew several versions of the wingless vehicles and produced data that helped in development of the Space Shuttle. He completed one NASA M2-F1, nine Northrop HL-10, nineteen Northrop M2-F3 and two Martin Marietta X-24B flights, for a total of 31 lifting body missions.

===NASA career===

Dana was Chief Engineer at NASA&#x27;s Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards Air Force Base, California, from 1993 until 1998, when he retired after almost 40 years of distinguished service to NASA. Formerly an aerospace research pilot, Dana flew the F-100 variable stability research aircraft and the Advanced Fighter Technology Integration/F-16 aircraft, as well as many others.

Before his assignment as Chief Engineer, he was Assistant Chief of the Flight Operations Division, a position he assumed after serving since 1986 as Chief Pilot. He was also a project pilot on the F-15 HIDEC (Highly Integrated Digital Electronic Control) research program, and a co-project pilot on the F-18 Hornet High Angle of Attack research program.

As a research pilot, Dana was involved in some of the most significant aeronautical programs carried out at Dryden. For his service as a flight research pilot, he received NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1997. In 2000 he was awarded the Milton O. Thompson Lifetime Achievement Award by the Dryden Flight Research Center.

==Death==
Dana died at age 83 in Phoenix, Arizona, on May 6, 2014, of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Honors==
For his contributions to the lifting body program, Dana received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. In 1976 he received the Haley Space Flight Award from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) for his research work on the M2-F3 lifting body control systems.

A member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, Dana is the author of several technical papers. In 1993, he was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor.

===Astronaut wings===
During the X-15 program, eight pilots flew above 264,000 feet or 50 miles, thereby qualifying as astronauts according to the United States definition of the space border. Of these pilots, five were active-duty Air Force personnel who were awarded military astronaut wings contemporaneously with their achievements. However, the other three, including Dana, were then-current NASA employees, and did not receive a comparable decoration at the time. In 2004, the Federal Aviation Administration conferred its first-ever commercial astronaut wings on Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie, pilots of the commercial SpaceShipOne, another spaceplane with a flight profile comparable to the X-15&#x27;s. Following this in 2005, NASA retroactively awarded its civilian astronaut wings to Dana (then living), and to McKay and Walker (posthumously).

<doc id="970606" wikidata="Q995174" url="?curid=970606" title="Bryant Park">
<text>Bryant Park is a , privately managed public park in the New York City borough of Manhattan. It is located between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) and between 40th and 42nd Streets in Midtown Manhattan. The eastern half of Bryant Park is occupied by the Main Branch of the New York Public Library. The western half contains a lawn, shaded walkways, and amenities such as a carousel, and is located entirely over an underground structure that houses the library&#x27;s stacks. The park hosts several events, including a seasonal &quot;Winter Village&quot; with an ice rink and shops during the winter.

The first park at the site was opened in 1847 and was called Reservoir Square due to its proximity to the Croton Distributing Reservoir. Reservoir Square contained the New York Crystal Palace, which hosted the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations in 1853 and burned down in 1858. The square was renamed in 1884 for abolitionist and journalist William Cullen Bryant. The reservoir was demolished in 1900 and the New York Public Library&#x27;s main branch was built on the site, opening in 1911. Bryant Park was rebuilt in 1933–1934 to a plan by Lusby Simpson. After a period of decline, it was restored in 1988–1992 by landscape architects Hanna/Olin Ltd. and architects Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, during which the park was rebuilt and the library&#x27;s stacks were built underneath. Further improvements were made in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Though it is owned by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, Bryant Park is managed by the private not-for-profit organization Bryant Park Corporation, which was founded in 1980 and led the restoration of Bryant Park. The park is cited as a model for the success of public-private partnerships. The park is both a National Register of Historic Places listing and a New York City designated landmark.

==History==
===Early history===

In 1686, when the area was still a wilderness, New York&#x27;s colonial governor, Thomas Dongan, designated the area now known as Bryant Park as a public space. George Washington&#x27;s troops crossed the area while retreating from the Battle of Long Island in 1776. The road upon which Washington&#x27;s troops retreated traversed the park site diagonally. The city acquired the land in 1822. Beginning in 1823, Bryant Park was designated a potter&#x27;s field (a graveyard for the poor) and remained so until 1840, when thousands of bodies were moved to Wards Island.

The first park at this site opened in 1847, though that park was never legally named. It was called &quot;Reservoir Square&quot; after the Croton Distributing Reservoir, which was erected on the eastern side of the park site due to its elevated location. In 1853, the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations with the New York Crystal Palace, featuring thousands of exhibitors, took place in the park. The Crystal Palace, also known as the Great Exhibition Hall, burned down in 1858. The Latting Observatory was also constructed in the park as part of the 1853 Exhibition, and was also burned down in 1856. The square was used for military drills during the American Civil War, and was the site of some of the New York City draft riots of July 1863, when the Colored Orphan Asylum at Fifth Avenue and 43rd Street was burned down.

Reservoir Square was renovated in 1870–1871, during which the modern-day park had been laid out. Several additional structures were planned for Reservoir Square, but never built. These included an 1870 plan for new armory for the 7th New York Militia, an 1880 plan for an opera house, another plan in 1881 for a New York Historical Society building, an 1893 plan for relocating the New York City Hall building, and a 1903 plan for a general post office.

=== Late 19th and early 20th centuries ===

==== Renaming and library construction ====

In 1884, Reservoir Square was renamed Bryant Park, to honor the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; editor and abolitionist William Cullen Bryant. Around the same time as the park&#x27;s renaming, in 1883, plans emerged to build a library in Bryant Park, atop the site of the reservoir. The library would be funded by Samuel J. Tilden. This was opposed somewhat by property owners, who wanted to extend the park eastward onto the reservoir site. Nevertheless, by the 1890s, the reservoir was slated for demolition. When the New York Public Library was founded in 1895, its founders wanted an imposing main branch building. The trustees of the libraries chose to build the branch at the eastern end of Bryant Park, along Fifth Avenue between 40th and 42nd Streets, because it was centrally located between the Astor and Lenox Libraries, the library&#x27;s direct predecessors. The architects of the building, Carrère and Hastings, also planned to convert the western border along Sixth Avenue into a pedestrian arcade with a flower market, while the central portion of Bryant Park would have housed sculptures and statues. However, these plans were cancelled as a result of opposition.The reservoir was torn down by 1900, and construction started on the library. In conjunction with the library&#x27;s construction, several improvements were made to the park, such as terrace gardens, public facilities, and kiosks, as well as a raised terrace adjoining the library on the eastern portion of the park. Since Bryant Park itself was located several feet above the surrounding streets, an iron fence, hedge, and embankment wall were built on the north, west, and south borders to separate the park from the bordering sidewalks. Benches were also installed along the retaining walls. Bryant Park&#x27;s interior was split into three lawns, divided by a pair of west–east gravel paths that aligned roughly with the sidewalks of 41st Street on the west end of the park. Four stone stairways were built: one each from Sixth Avenue&#x27;s intersections with 40th and 42nd Streets, and one each from 40th and 42nd Streets between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. In addition, 42nd Street was widened in 1910, necessitating the relocation of the fence on Bryant Park&#x27;s northern border and the removal of plants there. The NYPL&#x27;s Main Branch was opened on May 23, 1911.

==== Infrastructure and further improvements ====

Due to its central location in Midtown Manhattan, several transit lines and infrastructure projects were also built around Bryant Park. The first of these was the Sixth Avenue Elevated railway, which opened in 1878. The city&#x27;s first subway line, now part of the 42nd Street Shuttle, was opened in 1904 by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and ran directly under 42nd Street. In the 1910s, the Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad (now PATH) also planned to extend their Uptown Hudson Tubes from Herald Square to Grand Central Terminal, with intermediate stations near Bryant Park&#x27;s northeast and southwest corners, though this plan was never realized.

The Catskill Aqueduct water tunnel was built under Bryant Park in the early 1910s. Once the work was complete, the affected sections of Bryant Park were restored. During World War I, Bryant Park was frequently used for patriotic rallies, and a &quot;war garden&quot; and a &quot;recreation building&quot; for Allied soldiers was erected in the park. After the end of the war in 1920, an experimental garden was placed in the park and the recreation building was destroyed. During construction of the IRT Flushing Line in the 1920s, the northern segment of Bryant Park was partly closed for four years while the subway line was constructed directly underneath. The subway tunnel ran below ground level with a station at the eastern edge of the park, at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. During construction, workers took precautions to avoid interrupting the flow of traffic above ground and interfering with preexisting tunnels. The Fifth Avenue station opened in 1926, while the tunnel under Bryant Park to Times Square opened the following year. In January 1927, after the section of the Flushing Line under Bryant Park was complete, plans were announced for a restoration of the park&#x27;s northern section.

===1930s restoration===

By the 1930s, Bryant Park was suffering from neglect and was considered disreputable, as the Sixth Avenue elevated literally overshadowed the park. Over a period of 10 years, about 100 separate plans for Bryant Park&#x27;s renovation were proposed, but never enacted. In an attempt to revitalize the park, the George Washington Bicentennial Planning Committee and Sears filed plans for a replica of Lower Manhattan&#x27;s Federal Hall in early 1932. During the construction of the replica, part of the park was fenced off. The Dr. Marion Sims and Washington Irving statues were removed; the statues were later found under the Williamsburg Bridge. The replica was opened to the public in May 1932, charging an admission fee for entry. That November, Manhattan parks commissioner Walter R. Herrick formally notified Sears that the replica had to be torn down, because he did not approve of its proposed conversion into a Great Depression relief center. By the next year, the Bicentennial Committee&#x27;s funds had been exhausted. The replica was torn down in mid-1933.

In an attempt to engage unemployed architects, the Architects&#x27; Emergency Committee held a competition for the redesign of Bryant Park in 1933. The winning design was submitted by Lusby Simpson, of Queens. However, due to a lack of funding, the winning design was not implemented immediately. In February 1934, under the leadership of newly appointed parks commissioner Robert Moses, work was started on Simpson&#x27;s plan. The renovated park featured a great lawn, as well as hedges and later an iron fence that separated the park from the surrounding city streets. Two entrances each were added from 40th and 42nd Streets. As part of the project, 270 trees were placed around the park. Moses also placed the park&#x27;s statues along 40th and 42nd Streets so as to block sight lines from these streets. To save money, the project hired workers from the Civil Works Administration, an unemployment relief program. The renovation was complete by late 1934, and after a short postponement, the park reopened that September 15.

Parts of the park were closed in the late 1930s due to transit changes on Sixth Avenue; the elevated was torn down in 1938, and the construction of the underground Sixth Avenue subway line occurred around the same time. The Sixth Avenue subway opened in 1940. A &quot;New Yorker&quot; article remarked in 1936 that during the prior 14 years, &quot;Bryant Park has been closed to the public [...] for half that time.&quot;

=== Mid-20th century ===
Public events in Bryant Park were held through the mid-20th century. For instance, in 1944 during World War II, an aircraft demonstration was held in the park. Outdoor summer concerts in Bryant Park were started in 1948 by Philip Lieson Miller, a musicologist at the New York Public Library. These concerts took place from 12 to 2 p.m. on weekdays from July through September. On October 15, 1969, forty thousand people attended a rally in Bryant Park as part of the nationwide Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam. Another large event, the Big Apple Circus, was proposed to be held in Bryant Park in 1978, but parks commissioner Gordon Davis denied the circus permission to host a show there, since it would have closed off Bryant Park to the public.

Plans to build parking garages under Bryant Park also surfaced in the mid-20th century, as a means of relieving parking shortages in Midtown Manhattan. The first such plan was made in 1946 when the city conducted a survey to determine the feasibility of such a garage. Parks commissioner Moses opposed the plan. A parking garage was proposed again in 1958, with plans for 1,200 spaces, though Moses also opposed this proposal. This proposal was backed by the Avenue of the Americas Association. However, though Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. supported the proposal, the New York City Planning Commission voted against it in November 1961.

By the 1960s, Bryant Park had entered a state of deterioration, due to a lack of maintenance and its location in a business district with few nighttime activities. In an attempt to deter crime, new lighting was installed in Bryant Park in 1962. Nevertheless, in 1966, parks commissioner Thomas Hoving called a meeting to restore the park, noting its degraded condition. By the 1970s, Bryant Park had been taken over by drug dealers and the homeless, and was considered a no-go area by ordinary citizens and visitors. The condition of the park was so bad that in 1973, parks commissioner Richard M. Clurman threatened to &quot;close Bryant Park and clear it of everybody—until we can get together and make it a place that New Yorkers want it to be.&quot; After a man was murdered at the park in 1976, the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that gambling and drinking were commonplace at the park. In an opinion piece in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Jerome Gartner, a coordinator for the Bryant Park Steering Committee, stated that the mugging of a Union Carbide executive in Bryant Park had been quoted as a reason for the company&#x27;s moving out of New York City.

An initial attempt at cleanup was commenced by the Bryant Park Community Fund in the mid-1970s. Free concerts were added in the hope that it would keep out criminals. The initiative was largely unsuccessful, though, and its funding was nearly depleted by 1977. Another initiative, the Bryant Park Steering Committee, was created in 1977 as a partnership between local businesses and the City University of New York. More New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers were added, and District Attorney Robert Morgenthau agreed to process arrests in Bryant Park more quickly. By 1978, public perception of Bryant Park&#x27;s safety was slightly better than in previous years, though drug dealers still frequented the park after office workers had gone back to work following their lunch breaks. Furthermore, NYPD officers initially declined to arrest drug users who were nonviolent. Starting in 1979, a coordinated program of amenities, including book and flower markets, landscape improvements, and entertainment activities, was initiated by a parks advocacy group called the Parks Council. Though the Parks Council&#x27;s activities became popular, drug use and small crimes were still common within the park through the early 1980s. After a group of undercover NYPD officers were stationed in the park starting in 1980, they had made 400 drug-related arrests within six months.

===Late 20th century===

====Formation of corporations====

The Bryant Park Restoration Corporation was founded in 1980 by Dan Biederman, along with Andrew Heiskell, chairman of Time Inc. and the New York Public Library. The BPRC immediately brought significant changes to remake the park into a place that people wanted to visit, and instituted a rigorous program to clean the park, remove graffiti, and repair physical damage. The BPRC also created a private security staff to confront unlawful behavior. In addition, the BPRC started an outdoor concert series in the summers. By 1982, arrests had decreased significantly compared to two years prior.

Another agency—the Bryant Park Management Corporation, composed of several nearby businesses—was tasked with maintaining the park, spending $525,000 per year to do so. NYC Parks spent an additional $250,000 a year on maintenance, the same amount as when the city had sole control over the park&#x27;s management. In 1983, HBO&#x27;s president, Frank Biondi, gave Heiskell a $100,000 check just before the company moved into new headquarters at 1100 Avenue of the Americas, adjacent to the park. At the time, that was the largest donation toward Bryant Park by a private corporation.

==== Renovation ====
In 1983, in an attempt to draw crowds to the park and raise money for continued maintenance, the BPRC proposed leasing Bryant Park from the city, renovating it, and building a café in the park. The $18 million renovation was to be executed by an alliance between the BPRC, NYPL, and NYC Parks. Restaurateur Warner LeRoy was to operate the eatery, and he planned to build an , glass café on the park&#x27;s east side adjacent to the library. In addition, the park would include four smaller food kiosks, a reflecting pool and water fountain, and a dedicated security team.

In 1984, the state passed legislation to allow the BPRC to lease space for such an eatery. The City Planning Commission also approved the structure the following year. However, the proposed café was met with opposition from the public, as it would obscure the library&#x27;s rear facade. Several park advocates who opposed it argued that the proposed eatery would turn over part of a public park to a private entity. LeRoy withdrew from the project in 1986 due to this opposition, saying that he feared that the constant reviews of the plan would bring the proposed structure to &quot;mediocrity&quot;.

The renovation was approved by the City Art Commission in January 1987, though the restaurant plan had not yet been approved. Following LeRoy&#x27;s withdrawal from the proposed Bryant Park café, the BPRC created a new plan with multiple smaller restaurant spaces. The spaces would be composed of two smaller pavilions, each tall with an area of , flanking the Bryant memorial next to the library. In September 1987, the plans went to another vote before the City Art Commission, with the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission taking an advisory role. The redesigned restaurant spaces were also approved by the City Art Commission that December, though the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission registered no official position on the matter. A concessionaire for one of the spaces was found in 1988, and the same year, the city turned over duties of Bryant Park&#x27;s land to BPRC. Subsequently, the park redesign was drafted by Hanna/Olin Ltd. and Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates; the design preserved many elements of Simpson&#x27;s design in the 1930s.

The park was closed for renovations on July 11, 1988. The four-year project to rebuild Bryant Park entailed new entrances, repairs to paths and lighting, and a redesign of the park&#x27;s garden by Lynden Miller. Biederman worked with William H. Whyte, a sociologist whose influence led them to implement two decisions. One was the placement of 2,000 movable chairs in the park. The other was to lower the park itself, because Bryant Park had been elevated from the street and isolated by tall hedges prior to the 1988 redesign. The 1988 renovation lowered the park to nearly street level and tore out the hedges, though much of the park was still slightly elevated. The park&#x27;s restrooms, which had been closed for 35 years, were renovated as well. The BPRC also found that several of the sculptures would need to be repaired, and called on William Cullen Bryant&#x27;s descendants and other entities to provide funding for the restoration of these sculptures. Landscape architect Laurie Olin of Hanna/Olin recalls that the design process focused on &quot;the different abilities of people [who] use these spaces...as well as making spaces that people are comfortable being with each other in.&quot; The restoration cost $8.9 million, which included $5.7 million of city funding and $3.2 million of private funding.

The renovation took place at the same time as the NYPL&#x27;s expansion of the main branch&#x27;s stacks underneath Bryant Park. The project was originally estimated to cost $21.6 million and was to be the largest expansion project in the main branch&#x27;s history; it entailed building of stacks, which could hold 3.2 million books. Construction on the stacks started after the park was closed. The park was excavated and the Great Lawn was rebuilt above it. Once the underground facilities were completed, Bryant Park was completely rebuilt, with of earth between the park surface and the storage facility&#x27;s ceiling.

==== Reopening and critical acclaim ====

Bryant Park was initially supposed to reopen in late 1990 or early 1991. The reopening date was pushed back due to delays caused by the construction of the library&#x27;s stacks. In June 1991, the city and BPRC reached an agreement to reopen the western section of Bryant Park on summer weekdays. The park was soft reopened on April 21, 1992, with the official reopening set for nearly a month later.

The new design received widespread acclaim. Deemed &quot;a triumph for many&quot; by &quot;New York Times&quot; architectural critic Paul Goldberger, the renovation was lauded not only for its architectural excellence, but also for adhering to Whyte&#x27;s vision. According to Goldberger, Biederman &quot;understood that the problem of Bryant Park was its perception as an enclosure cut off from the city; he knew that, paradoxically, people feel safer when not cut off from the city, and that they feel safer in the kind of public space they think they have some control over.&quot; The renovation was lauded as &quot;The Best Example of Urban Renewal&quot; by &quot;New York&quot; magazine, and was described by &quot;Time&quot; as a &quot;small miracle&quot;. Many awards followed, including a Design Merit Award from Landscape Architecture Magazine, and the 1996 Award for Excellence from the Urban Land Institute (ULI). The park has been extolled for its relative calmness and cleanness. Even through the 21st century, Bryant Park remains a model of civic renewal that mayors of other cities, such as Jorge Elorza of Providence, Rhode Island, sometimes hold up as a model to emulate.

Bryant Park was described in the media as an example of New York City&#x27;s 1990s revival. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article in 1995 referred to the park as the &quot;Town Square of Midtown&quot; and an &quot;office oasis&quot; frequented by midtown office workers. Further improvements included the installation of two newsstands in 1992, one each at Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Open-air concerts in the summers, which drew thousands of people, were commenced. To lessen infestations of pigeons eating the plants, the BPC started scattering corn kernels that contained the drug azacosterol, which resulted in many pigeons becoming infertile without any other side effects. Meanwhile, financing for a restaurant in Bryant Park next to the library was finally secured in 1993. The restaurant, Bryant Park Grill, opened in 1995.

=== 21st century ===

With security largely under the purview of the BPC, corporate control of the park has meant that Bryant Park received passive-recreation amenities, while excluding active sports that might cater to a broader urban public. The BPC added a custom-built carousel in 2002 and revived the tradition of an open-air library, the Reading Room, in 2003. In July 2002, the park launched a public wireless network, making the park the first in New York City to formally offer free Wi-Fi access to visitors. The Wi-Fi system was subsequently upgraded in 2008. Furthermore, the Pond, a free-admission ice skating rink, opened in the park in 2005. The park&#x27;s public restrooms were renovated in 2006 and in 2017.

The dramatic rise in real estate values in the area around Bryant Park, as well as new construction in adjacent areas, was a consequence of the park&#x27;s improvements. By 1993, the surrounding region had become a highly desirable office area, and formerly vacant office space around the park was being filled quickly. By the first decade of the 21st century, nearby buildings and businesses were also using names that referred to the park. This was shown by the then-new Bank of America Tower skyscraper at the park&#x27;s northeast corner using the address &quot;One Bryant Park&quot;, as well as the growing trend of Bryant Park vanity addresses, including 3, 4, 5, and 7 Bryant Park. National Public Radio, located just south of the park, also named a now-defunct talk show the &quot;Bryant Park Project&quot; upon the show&#x27;s 2007 launch. Such enthusiasm to use the Bryant Park name would have been nonexistent in the 1980s, when the area was described as &quot;the Wild West&quot;.

New real-estate developments were also built in the park&#x27;s vicinity starting in the 21st century, which together added over 13,000 new workers to the area immediately surrounding Bryant Park. These included the Bank of America Tower; an expansion to 1095 Avenue of the Americas immediately to the south; Eleven Times Square a block west of Bryant Park; and 505 Fifth Avenue at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Several hotels were also built, including a conversion of 485 Fifth Avenue at 41st Street, a Residence Inn by Marriott at Sixth Avenue and 39th Street. By the early 2010s, investors were purchasing buildings around Bryant Park south of 42nd Street as part of a small real estate boom. Rents per square foot in buildings south of 42nd Street had historically been lower than rents in buildings north of 42nd Street. Conversely, 1095 Avenue of the Americas and 452 Fifth Avenue were able to attract comparatively high rental rates despite both being south of 42nd Street. Later in the decade, the area around Bryant Park started growing into a residential neighborhood, with the construction of new developments in the area. Within a two-block radius of the park, or roughly , units routinely sold for millions of dollars.

By 2024, the Bryant Park Grill&#x27;s lease was about to expire. After the Bryant Park Grill lost its lease in January 2025, the BPC leased the space to a branch of the Jean-Georges restaurant, which planned to renovate the space for $12 million.

== Description ==
Bryant Park is located between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and between 40th and 42nd Streets, and covers . Although technically the main branch of the New York Public Library is located within the park, in design it forms the eastern boundary of the park&#x27;s green space, making Sixth Avenue the park&#x27;s primary entrance. Bryant Park is used mostly as a passive recreation space, and lacks active sports facilities. Bryant Park is several steps above the surrounding streets, enclosed by a retaining wall. Granite stairs at several locations provide access from the surrounding sidewalks. The surrounding area contains numerous structures, including the Bank of America Tower and 1095 Avenue of the Americas to the northwest; the Bryant Park Studios, American Radiator Building, Engineers&#x27; Club Building, and 452 Fifth Avenue to the south; 461 Fifth Avenue and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library to the southeast; and 500 Fifth Avenue, the Aeolian Building, and the W.R. Grace Building to the north.

One of the park&#x27;s largest features is a large lawn located slightly below the level of the surrounding walkways. Besides serving as a &quot;lunchroom&quot; for office workers, the lawn serves as the seating area for some of the park&#x27;s major events, such as Bryant Park Movie Nights, Broadway in Bryant Park, and Square Dance. The lawn&#x27;s season runs from February until October, when it is closed to make way for Bank of America Winter Village.

Numerous walkways surround the central lawn. The northern and southern sides are each flanked by two flagstone walkways. Each of these walkways is bordered by London plane (&quot;Platanus × hispanica&quot;) trees, which contribute to the park&#x27;s European feel. In addition, numerous statues are scattered throughout the park. A raised terrace on the eastern side of the lawn, which dates to the construction of the library&#x27;s main branch, is paved with gray flagstones and red brick. Its centerpiece is the William Cullen Bryant Memorial, which is raised on a pedestal of its own.

A restroom structure is located at the northern border of the park along 42nd Street. A carousel, installed in 2002, is located at the park&#x27;s southern border. The park is served by the New York City Subway&#x27;s at 42nd Street–Bryant Park/Fifth Avenue station, entrances to which are located on the northern and western borders of the park, as well as MTA Regional Bus Operations&#x27; routes.

===Art and monuments===
====Sculptures====
Notable sculptures in the park include or have included:
* Statue of William E. Dodge (1885), a standing figure located on a pedestal at the park&#x27;s northern border
* Statue of J. Marion Sims (1894), removed in the 1930s
* &quot;Washington Irving&quot; (1894), removed in the 1930s
* &quot;William Cullen Bryant Memorial&quot; (1911), a standing figure located on a canopied pedestal at the park&#x27;s eastern border
* &quot;Josephine Shaw Lowell Memorial Fountain&quot; (1913), located at the park&#x27;s western border; the fountain collects about $3,000 to $4,000 in coins each year, from dozens of countries
* Bust of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1932), a bust located at the park&#x27;s southern border
* Statue of José Bonifácio de Andrada (1954, dedicated 1955), a standing figure located on a pedestal at the park&#x27;s southwestern corner
* Statue of Gertrude Stein (1992), a sitting figure located at the park&#x27;s southeastern corner
* Statue of Benito Juárez (2002), a standing figure located on a pedestal at the park&#x27;s northwestern corner

==== Other memorials ====
The northwest corner of Bryant Park, at Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street, contains the Heiskell Plaza, a stairway and entrance plaza paved with flagstones. It was placed in 1993 in honor of Andrew Heiskell, a cofounder of the BPC.

The southwest corner of Bryant Park, at Sixth Avenue and 40th Street, is known as Nikola Tesla Corner. Tesla, an inventor, lived in the nearby New Yorker Hotel in his later years, and would feed pigeons in the park. The placement of the sign was due to the efforts of the Croatian Club of New York in cooperation with New York City officials, and Ljubo Vujovic of the Tesla Memorial Society of New York.

=== Carousel ===
Bryant Park contains a carousel called Le Carrousel Magique, located in the southern section of the park. The carousel was designed by Marvin Sylvor, created by the Fabricon Carousel Company, and installed in 2002. The company was selected after a carousel installation in Bryant Park was approved in 1997. The carousel has a diameter of , weighs , and contains 14 animal casts, of which 12 are capable of moving vertically. In keeping with the French theme of the park, it plays French music. It underwent a restoration in 2009. The carousel also has a ticket booth, measuring tall and wide, which was constructed in 1928 and was relocated from Paragon Park in Hull, Massachusetts.

=== Restrooms ===

Bryant Park contains a Beaux-Arts granite restroom structure on the northern border, along 42nd Street. There are two facilities, one for men and women, both of which are . These were built in 1911 along with the NYPL Main Branch, but due to the park&#x27;s landmark status, they cannot be expanded. The exterior of each building contains a frieze with garland motifs. After being closed in the mid-1960s, they were restored by Kupiec &amp; Koutsomitis and reopened in 1992. The restrooms have been described as being among the city&#x27;s best. A subsequent renovation in 2006 solidified their status as, in the words of then-New York City Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe, &quot;the gold standard for park comfort stations.&quot; The restrooms were renovated again in 2017. Following the 2017 renovation, the restrooms contained rotating artworks selected from a collection of 225 works, as well as fresh flowers, classical music, attendants, and automatic toilets and faucets.

=== Reading room ===
The original Reading Room was founded in August 1935 to entertain unemployed workers during the Great Depression. Started as an initiative by the New York Public Library, the Reading Room provided the jobless with a place to interact and share ideas without having to pay money or show identification. Despite this, the library was well-used, being used by 50,000 people by its first anniversary. Theft was low, with only 34 publications being lost in the library&#x27;s first year. By its third year, 400 books and 1,000 magazines were in circulation and were being perused by 70,000 people per year. Books from the NYPL, and donations of magazines and trade publications from publishers, contributed to the success of the open-air library. The tradition of Reading Rooms halted in 1944 due to a staff shortage during World War II.

The Reading Room tradition was revived in 2003 with HSBC as its first sponsor. Oxford University Press, Scholastic Corporation, Mitchell&#x27;s NY, Condé Nast Publications, Time Inc., Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., and Rodale, Inc. were among the companies who donated books and publications. In addition to the complimentary reading materials, in 2004 programming was added to Reading Room&#x27;s content. The Reading Room features readings and book sales by contemporary writers and poets, plus book-related special events such as book clubs, writers workshops and storytelling for kids.

=== Bank of America Winter Village ===

Modeled on Europe&#x27;s &quot;Christkindlmarkt&quot;, in 2002 Bryant Park introduced the Holiday Shops in an effort to liven up the park space during the winter. Initially slow to gain traction, the Holiday Shops became a fixture of the Manhattan holiday scene in 2005 by adding an ice-skating rink. The Shops also include a Norway Spruce tree, as well as a standalone dining and event space.

Sponsored by Bank of America, Winter Village can be set up within two weeks. In September 2016, Bryant Park Corporation announced market makers Urbanspace as the new operator for the Holiday Shops, which grew from 80 boutiques in 2002 to over 170 in 2018. In 2018, Urbanspace also took over management of the rinkside eatery, rebranding it as The Lodge. The &quot;Gothamist&quot; wrote in 2024 that visitors had mixed views of Winter Village; though tourists and some New Yorkers liked Winter Village&#x27;s shops and food stands, detractors felt that the shops were overcrowded.

== Private operation ==
The Bryant Park Corporation (BPC), formerly the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation (BPRC), manages the park. BPC also oversees the Bryant Park Management Corporation (BPMC), which was created to manage the Bryant Park business improvement district.

Although Bryant Park is a public park, BPC accepts no public funds. It was initially supported by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, but by the 21st century it received funding through tax assessments on surrounding property within the business improvement district, fees from concessionaires, and revenues generated by public events. To obtain accurate data about park usage, BPC counts the number of patrons in Bryant Park at 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. every day.

The number of events at the park grew significantly after its reopening, causing some consternation by people who feared that the park would be dominated by private entities, thus would be inaccessible to the public. As a result, BPC makes most events free and open to the public. One exception was the New York Fashion Week shows that formerly took over the park for two weeks in the winter and late summer each year. BPC cofounder Dan Biederman often publicly expressed his frustration that the fashion shows were not under BPC&#x27;s control. &quot;They pay us a million dollars. It&#x27;s a million dollars I would happily do without,&quot; he told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. BPC was particularly frustrated that the fashion shows dominated the park during two crucial times: in late summer, when the weather is perfect for park visitors; and in early February, necessitating the early closure of the park&#x27;s popular free-admission ice-skating rink.

==Programming==

Numerous events are hosted on the lawn at Bryant Park. Bryant Park Movie Nights, begun in the early 1990s, take place on Monday evenings during the summer. Various free musical performances are sponsored by corporations during months with warm weather, including &quot;Broadway in Bryant Park&quot;, sponsored by iHeartMedia and featuring performers from current Broadway musicals, integrated with content provided by event sponsors.

The park has various activity areas open all day long, including board games, chess and backgammon, a putting green and Kubb area, an Art Cart, ping pong tables, and Petanque courts. The parks also offer free classes in juggling, yoga, tai chi, and knitting. In the 40th Street plaza of the park, there is a station called Bryant Park Games where visitors can borrow an array of games, including Chinese chess and quoits. In addition, chess and table tennis can also be played at Bryant Park.

Food and drink are served at four park-operated concessionary kiosks. There are two additional kiosks on Fifth Avenue, bringing the total of concessionaires near Bryant Park to six.

=== Former programming ===
Formerly, Bryant Park hosted New York Fashion Week (NYFW) shows, which took over the park for two weeks in the winter and late summer each year. NYFW, which moved to Bryant Park in 1993, was forced to set fees for its shows after Manhattan Community Board 5 disapproved of a free fashion show on the grounds that three-fourths of profits would go to BPC and only one-fourth to NYC Parks. Dan Biederman of the BPC had called the profits from NYFW &quot;a million dollars I would happily do without,&quot; and lamented the fact that NYFW took over the park at two high-traffic periods: late summer and late winter. NYFW moved from Bryant Park in 2010 after disagreements with the BPC.

==Landmark designations==
Bryant Park and the New York Public Library Main Branch were jointly listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1966. Its listing on the NRHP is distinct from the &quot;New York Public Library&quot; on the same day, which covered just the main branch building. In addition, in 1974, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the park as a New York City scenic landmark.

<text>Priscus of Panium (; ; 410s/420s AD – after 472 AD) was a 5th-century Eastern Roman diplomat and Greek historian and rhetorician (or sophist).

==Biography==
Priscus was born in Panion (located in Thrace) between 410 and 420 AD. In 448/449 AD, he accompanied Maximinus, the head of the Byzantine embassy representing Emperor Theodosius II (r. 402–450), on a diplomatic mission to the court of Attila the Hun. While there, he met and conversed with a Greek merchant, dressed in &quot;Scythian&quot; (or Hunnic) fashion, who was captured eight years earlier () when the city of Viminacium (located on the Danube east of modern-day Belgrade) was sacked by the Huns. The trader explained to Priscus that after the sack of Viminacium, he was a slave of Onegesius, a Hunnic nobleman, but obtained his freedom and chose to settle among the Huns. Priscus ultimately engaged in a debate with the Greek defector regarding the qualities of life and justice in both the Byzantine Empire and in barbarian kingdoms.

After an interlude in Rome, Priscus traveled to Alexandria and the Thebaid in Egypt. He last appeared in the East, circa 456, attached to the staff of Euphemios as Emperor Marcian&#x27;s (r. 450–457) magister officiorum. He died after 472 AD.

===History of Byzantium===
Priscus was the author of an eight-volume historical work, written in Greek, entitled the &quot;History of Byzantium&quot; (Greek: Ἱστορία Βυζαντιακή), which was probably not the original title name. The &quot;History&quot; probably covered the period from the accession of Attila the Hun to the accession of Emperor Zeno (r. 474–475), or from 433 up until 474 AD. Priscus&#x27;s work currently survives in fragments and was very influential in the Byzantine Empire. The &quot;History&quot; was used in the &quot;Excerpta de Legationibus&quot; of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (r. 913–959), as well as by authors such as Evagrius Scholasticus, Cassiodorus, Jordanes, and the author of the Souda. Priscus&#x27;s writing style is straightforward and his work is regarded as a reliable contemporary account of Attila the Hun, his court, and the reception of the Roman ambassadors. He is considered a &quot;classicizing&quot; historian to the extent that his work, though written during the Christian era, is almost completely secular and relies on a style and word-choice that are part of an historiographical tradition dating back to the fifth century BC.

===Priscus account of a dinner with Attila the Hun===

Priscus recounted the story of a dinner with Attila the Hun which took place at one of Attila&#x27;s many houses. This house was said to be greater than the rest (having been made for celebration) due to it being constructed of decorative polished wood, with little thought to making any part of the place for defense. The dinner was at three o’clock; Priscus entered the house bearing gifts to Attila&#x27;s wife; her name was Kreka and she had three sons. Priscus and the embassy of Eastern Romans were placed at the end of the table farthest from Attila but still in his presence; this was meant to show that he was greater than the Roman guests, and that Attila considered his people to be more important than Priscus and the Roman embassy. As Priscus and the Eastern Roman embassy stood, they followed the cultural tradition of being served tea from the cupbearers; they were to pray and have a drink before having a seat at the table. The seats were arranged parallel to the walls; Attila sat on the middle couch. The right side of Attila was reserved for his honored Chiefs, and everyone else including Priscus and the Roman embassies sat on the left. After being seated, everyone raised a glass to pledge one another with wine. Once the cupbearers left another attendant came in with a platter of meat, followed by bread and other foods of the time. All of the food was served onto plates of silver and gold. Priscus also notes that Attila didn&#x27;t use any silver or gold plates but instead used a cup made of wood; also, his attire was not very grand. Once the first round was finished, they stood and drank again to the health of Attila. When evening arrived torches were lit and songs that were about Attila&#x27;s victories were sung.

===Priscus in fiction===
Priscus is an important character in &quot;Slave of the Huns&quot; by Geza Gardonyi. He is depicted as a kindly master and scholar, and part of the novel is based on his account of his visit to Attila.

He is not to be confused with Priscus of Epirus, who lived in the 4th century and is one of two main interlocutors in Gore Vidal&#x27;s novel &quot;Julian&quot;.

<text>Kassym-Jomart Kemeluly Tokayev (born 17 May 1953) is a Kazakh politician and diplomat who has served as the President of Kazakhstan since March 20, 2019.

Born in Alma-Ata (now Almaty), Tokayev attended the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. After graduating in 1975, he worked as a diplomat in Singapore and China. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Tokayev became the deputy foreign minister of a newly independent Kazakhstan in 1994, where he was involved on the issues of nuclear disarmament within the former Soviet republics. In 1999, Tokayev became the deputy prime minister, and in October of that year with the endorsement of the Parliament, he was appointed as prime minister by President Nursultan Nazarbayev. From 2002, Tokayev served as foreign minister and state secretary, where he continued to play an active role in the field of nuclear non-proliferation. He was the director-general of the UN Office at Geneva from 2011 to 2013 and served twice as a chairman of the Kazakh Senate from 2007 to 2011 and 2013 to 2019.

In 2019, Tokayev assumed office as the acting president after Nursultan Nazarbayev&#x27;s resignation. Being a member of the ruling Amanat party, he won a snap election in June of that year with the support of Nazarbayev as the nominee for the party. During his presidency, he has enacted several reforms including increasing workers&#x27; salaries, reducing corruption, abolishing capital punishment, and decentralising the local government. From 2020, Tokayev had endured the economic downturn and issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and War in Afghanistan and has sought to counter Kazakhstan&#x27;s rising inflation, domestic terrorism, illegal migration, drug trafficking, nuclear energy development and power shortages caused by cryptocurrency mining, as well as the COVID-19 vaccination rollout. In 2022, Tokayev announced constitutional reforms that would limit his powers and grant more authority to the Parliament. As a result, he initiated a constitutional referendum which was backed by an overwhelming number of voters and led to the complete stripping of Nazarbayev&#x27;s post-presidential privileges regarding policymaking.

Since becoming president, Tokayev&#x27;s political influence and role in Kazakhstan had steadily grown apart from Nazarbayev as he assumed various other powerful positions which were previously held by Nazarbayev starting with the chairmanship of the Assembly of People in 2021. In January 2022, he imposed a nationwide state of emergency, dismissed the entirety of Asqar Mamin&#x27;s government, and ordered security forces to use deadly force following a two-week long violent unrest that had begun earlier that month. Shortly thereafter, Tokayev took the leading role in the Security Council and ruling Amanat party from Nazarbayev and along with his relatives, dismissed several officials who held a close relationship with Nazarbayev.

While managing to maintain the country&#x27;s stability, ensuring political transition, and enacting new reforms, Tokayev&#x27;s governance has remained authoritarian with human rights abuses. The 2022 Suisse Secrets leaks revealed that the Tokayev family had maintained an elaborate network of secretive offshore wealth assets since at least 1998.

On 20 November 2001, at the Khabar Agency broadcast, Tokayev threatened to resign from his post as the PM unless President Nursultan Nazarbayev would dismiss several government officials whom he accused of being &quot;intriguers&quot; such as Deputy PM Oraz Jandosov, Labour and Social Protection of the population minister Alikhan Baimenov, Pavlodar Regional äkim Galymzhan Zhakiyanov and Deputy Defense Minister Janat Ertlesova by trying to decentralise the country&#x27;s executive branch and slow down the democratization programs. The move came just days after a group of prominent Kazakh officials whom Tokayev accused and others announced the creation of Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan at a press conference. As a result, six cabinet members, including Jandosov, Zhakiyanov and Ertlesova were dismissed by Nazarbayev.

On 28 January 2002, Tokayev resigned from his post without a full explanation, calling it a &quot;normal event&quot; due to &quot;a strong presidency&quot;. He was subsequently appointed a state secretary and minister of foreign affairs concurrently.

He served the post until being relieved on 15 April 2011 after being appointed Director-General of the United Nations. President Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed his gratitude towards Tokayev, stating that he&#x27;s &quot;absolutely committed to the path of reforms that I am pursuing.&quot;

On 16 October 2013, he was reappointed again as the Senate Chair and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate MP&#x27;s.

During the 2016 Protests against land reforms in Kazakhstan, Tokayev stressed the issue of land lease to be dealt with in a critical matter.

Tokayev became a candidate for presidency following his nomination by the ruling Amanat party, then known as Nur Otan on 23 April 2019. During the campaign, Tokayev&#x27;s election promises focused on continuation of existing policies, justice and progress, citing his personal reason in participating in the race to ensure Nazarbayev&#x27;s continuity, a major part of Tokayev&#x27;s platform. While campaigning, Tokayev was mocked on social media for his use of photo manipulation software to erase his wrinkles and double chin from official photos. He was elected president of Kazakhstan on 9 June with 71% of the popular vote. He was congratulated by foreign heads of state such as Xi Jinping, Ilham Aliyev, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Emomali Rahmon, and Sooronbay Jeenbekov.

==Presidency==
On 19 March 2019, then-President Nursultan Nazarbayev announced his resignation. According to the Constitution of Kazakhstan, in case of early termination of powers, the Senate Chairman becomes President until the end of the previous term. On 20 March, Tokayev officially took office as president. Immediately after the inauguration, Tokayev proposed renaming the capital city of Kazakhstan after his predecessor, and the same day the Parliament of Kazakhstan approved the renaming of Astana to Nur-Sultan. Russian President Vladimir Putin was one of the first foreign leaders to congratulate Tokayev, inviting him to visit Moscow in a joint telephone conversation with him and Nazarbayev.

=== Term ===

==== 2019 ====
In June 2019, following a military ammo deposit blast in the town of Arys which resulted in evacuations of residents and hundreds of injuries, Tokayev launched a criminal case and ordered the Interior and Defence ministries to prevent possible more explosions, pledging that any perpetrators would be prosecuted. Tokayev paid visit to the town on 25 June, touring buildings that were affected by the blast as well as meeting with hospitalised victims.

Tokayev delivered his first State of the Nation Address on 2 September 2019. The address focused on strengthening civil society and social security, supporting domestic business and economic development.

In October 2019, it was announced that all potential ministerial candidates needed the approval of Nazarbayev before being appointed, with the exception of minister of defence, interior minister and foreign minister.

After the Bek Air Flight 2100 crash, Tokayev declared the following day, 28 December 2019, a national day of mourning and said that &quot;all those responsible will be severely punished in accordance with the law.&quot; He also ordered the suspension of the flight authorisation of Bek Air, the domestic airline involved.

==== 2020 ====
Following the Dungan–Kazakh ethnic clashes which broke out in February 2020, Tokayev fired the governor, deputy governor and police chief of the southern Jambyl Region. Tokayev blamed &quot;two criminal groups&quot; fighting over contraband for the deadly ethnic violence between ethnic Kazakhs and the relatively wealthier Dungan minority.

In an interview to Informburo news agency, Tokayev commented on the fate of Mukhtar Dzhakishev, saying &quot;this issue is exclusively within the competence of the court. Of course, I am aware that Dzhakishev has repeatedly applied for parole on ill-health. The session of the court of first instance will be held on 3 March. Let&#x27;s wait for its decision, which I am sure will be fair.&quot; On 3 March 2020, the Semey City Court upheld the motion to grant parole to Dzhakishev. He served a 14-year prison sentence since 2009.

On 2 May 2020, Nazarbayev&#x27;s daughter Dariga Nazarbayeva was removed from the Senate and her role as the chair by Tokayev. Many theories arose that this was a sign of either Tokayev was expanding his political influence or a growing feud between the ruling elite.

In his second State of the Nation Address on 1 September 2020, Tokayev unveiled seven reforms with most focus on economic recovery. From there, he spoke of optimizing Kazakhstan&#x27;s social system, increasing productivity and a greener economy, leveling business conditions, investing more in education and overseeing the state&#x27;s administration as it becomes more sensitive and accountable.

==== 2021 ====
In autumn 2020, Tokayev announced date for 2021 legislative elections, where he asserted that the electoral and political process had been liberalised to allow for greater involvement in civil society and that the newly incoming parliament convocation will focus on support for socio-economic reforms. During election day, Tokayev said that the government would resign in accordance with law and that he would consult with newly elected MPs and party leaders in regard to the appointments of prime minister and cabinet members. In the aftermath of vote, the ruling Nur Otan despite losing dozen seats, topped the results in which the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) citied that the elections &quot;lacked genuine competition&quot;. At the opening session of the 7th Parliament held on 15 January 2021, Tokayev reappointed Asqar Mamin as the prime minister.

On 28 April 2021, former president Nazarbayev resigned from the post as the chairman of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan (QHA). From there, he proposed Tokayev to succeed him which was supported by the QHA members. Tokayev, in turn, suggested Nazarbayev to be named as the &quot;Honorary Chairman&quot;, saying that the status should &quot;rightfully belong&quot; to him due to a &quot;historical merit.&quot;

On 23 November 2021, Kazakhstan&#x27;s First President Nursultan Nazarbayev&#x27;s spokesperson, Aidos Ukibay, announced that the former president will hand over the powers of the Nur Otan party chair to current President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.

==== 2022 ====

Following the 2022 Kazakh unrest, Tokayev dismissed Prime Minister Asqar Mamin as well as his cabinet. While initially attempting to calm the public in early stages of the protests by promising to unveil his new proposed reforms and introduced price controls for liquefied natural gas, diesel and gasoline, as well as for socially significant goods, Tokayev issued orders for the army to use lethal force against protesters, and to &quot;shoot to kill, without warning.&quot; He also appointed Alihan Smaiylov, who served as deputy prime minister and finance minister prior, as the new PM.

On 16 March 2022, Tokayev proposed constitutional reforms to limit the powers of his office, saying the country needed to switch from &quot;superpresidential&quot; rule to a presidential republic with a strong parliament. On April 26, 2022, Tokayev left the Amanat party, ending the dominant party system in the nation. Subsequently, during the referendum on June 5, 2022, a provision was introduced into the Constitution according to which, during the period of exercise of his powers, the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan must not be a member of any political party.

Early elections for the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan were held on November 20, 2022, in which Kassym-Jomart Tokayev won with 81.31% of the votes.

===Domestic actions===
After assuming office, Tokayev outlined main directions for Kazakhstan which were increasing the incomes of population, eradication of corruption, judicial reforms, creating new jobs with decent wages, solving housing issues, fair social policies, regional developments, spiritualism, foreign national interests and youth opportunities. In his first month of presidency, Tokayev made several reorganisations and appointments within the administration and the ministerial cabinet with some top officials such as Presidential Administration head Bakhytzhan Sagintayev and National Security Committee chairman Karim Massimov keeping their posts while others being reshuffled or forced to stepped down.

====Political reforms====
In May 2020, Tokayev signed the laws &quot;On the procedure for organizing and holding peaceful assemblies in the Republic of Kazakhstan&quot;, &quot;On introducing amendments to the Constitutional Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan&quot;, &quot;On Elections in the Republic of Kazakhstan&quot;, and &quot;On introducing amendments and additions to the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan &quot;On Political Parties&quot;. The new laws are an important part of the measures to strengthen the state&#x27;s democratic foundations, and enhance the role of civil society. In his State of the Nation Address, he emphasised that &quot;Kazakhstan must create a multi-party system to build a modern, effective state&quot;, also saying that the ruling Nur Otan party should collaborate more with other parties.

===== The &quot;Listening State&quot; =====
One of the significant elements of the President&#x27;s public policy was to propose the concept of a &quot;Listening State&quot;, where the public administration would follow the basic principle of &quot;not a citizen for the state, but a state for the citizen&quot;. Tokayev advocated political reforms that would promote the concept of a &quot;state that listens&quot; to civil society creating a constructive dialogue. Tokayev initiated the establishment of the new National Council of Public Trust to facilitate this dialogue. He also called for direct elections for the äkıms (local heads) of rural districts, townships, and villages to be held in 2021 to which he signed decree on 14 September 2020 of the implementation of National Plan of Measures which set tasks for the drafting of constitutional amendments that would allow for rural äkım direct elections as well as the development of local government and its functions.

After the 2021 legislative elections which saw three of five contesting parties retain their seats in the Mazhilis, Tokayev at the opening first session of the 7th Parliament proposed to reduce the electoral threshold from 7% to 5%, stating it would encourage more registered parties to participate in the future parliamentary elections as well as the vote option &quot;Against all&quot; to be re-included in the ballots once again. As the Parliament ratified Tokayev&#x27;s proposed constitutional amendments, he signed the laws into place on 25 May 2021.

===== Resignation from the Amanat party =====
On 26 April 2022, he resigned from the Amanat party. Later, in a referendum held on 5 June 2022, a norm was introduced in the Constitution which stated that the President of Kazakhstan must not belong to a political party while exercising his powers.

On 14 June 2022, the President signed a decree establishing the National Kurultai, a new civic institution with more relevant and broader functions to replace the National Council of Public Trust (NCPT). On 16 June 2022, the first meeting of the National Kurultai was held in Ulytau.

===== Early presidential election, 20 November 2022 =====

==== Capital punishment ====

In December 2019, Tokayev announced that Kazakhstan would join the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, after the issue was raised by Kazakh human rights activists and experts during discussions at the meetings of the National Council of Public Trust. From there, Tokayev set the task for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to start the process of joining the Second Optional Protocol which would set measures in abolishing of death penalty in the country.

On 2 January 2021, Tokayev signed decree approved by the Parliament in abolishing death penalty in Kazakhstan.

==== Economic reforms and policies ====

In 2020, the salaries for teachers, doctors and social workers were increased.

In amidst of the worsening economic situation worldwide as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, Tokayev instructed the government to form an anti-crisis plan which would fulfill &quot;all social obligations&quot;. A series of packages were unveiled in response, which aimed at easing burden for private sector by providing cheaper credit, tax incentives, cutting back on audits and promoting employment. As the pandemic progressed, inflation for goods began to grow leading to an increase in social and labour discontent particularly in western Kazakhstan. Tokayev, in response, blamed the government and the central bank for being too &quot;powerless&quot; and from there, urged them to reduce the inflation rate, noting the surplus amount of the money supply that exists in the state budget.

In September 2021, Tokayev called for an increase of the national minimum wage for the first time since 2018, citing the global pandemic that affected the purchasing power for citizens and asserted that it would lead to growth in domestic consumption. In terms of wage fund, Tokayev instructed the government to implement soft measures in encouraging businesses to raise salaries for employees by pledging for state-supported benefits.

Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 in Kazakhstan in March 2020, Tokayev enacted a state of emergency in the country on 15 March. During his national televised address, Tokayev stressed that he had signed a special decree on measures to ensure the stability of the state functioning, citing that the documents allow an increase the efficiency of state bodies, strengthen the vertical of power and make all necessary decisions promptly in a manual mode. In an attempt to curb the spread of the virus, Tokayev ordered the cancellations of both the Nowruz celebrations as well as the Victory Day military parade in honour of the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. During the period, the nationwide lockdowns were prolonged twice before being lifted in May 2020. Just a month later in July 2020, Tokayev reintroduced restrictions in Kazakhstan which lasted until August 2020. In autumn 2020, Tokayev assessed that the lockdowns would be avoided depending on the levels of public mask and social distancing compliance.

As a proponent of COVID-19 vaccination, Tokayev blamed Healthcare Ministry and the entire government as during a slow jab pace in the early months of the vaccine administering. In an effort to boost public confidence, Tokayev received his dose of a Kazakh-manufactured Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine in April 2021, to which according to a spokesperson that Tokayev felt no side effects in result. Tokayev also vowed to crackdown on fraudulent vaccine passports and provide Kazakh citizens broader options for different vaccine manufacturers.

==== Energy and cryptocurrency ====

Tokayev expressed the need for Kazakhstan to have a nuclear power plant in April 2019, claiming that the country would face an electricity deficit by 2030. From early 2021, energy consumption in Kazakhstan sharply rose by 8% as a result of increase in cryptocurrency mining from miners fleeing China.

In May 2021, Tokayev announced the Low-Carbon Development Concept, a national project which seeks to reduce Kazakhstan&#x27;s dependency on coal by development electric power industry and the country&#x27;s energy balance by 2035.

==== Environment ====

In his inaugural speech, Tokayev called environmental issues &quot;concerning&quot; and proposed a unified policy by adopting a new code which would protect the environment. On 17 June 2019, he signed a decree forming the Ministry of Ecology, Geology and Natural Resources, appointing Magzum Myrzagaliev to the post. The Ministry was given the authority to protect the environment, oversee the rational use of natural resources, geology and reproduction of the mineral and raw materials base, as well as the treatment of solid household waste, water and wastewater, and forestry.

Tokayev addressed the problems regarding the air pollution in Almaty. He instructed the government, city äkımat, and Samruk-Energy to implement final decision in the transformation of the Almaty-2 thermal power station to natural gas in order to limit harmful emissions that come from the plant which is estimated to be 30% of all other sources, warning that any delay would be &quot;absolutely unacceptable.&quot;

On 4 October 2021, Tokayev signed a bill aimed at protecting the ecosystem of the Caspian Sea by establishing a regular assessment for the state of marine environment and coastal areas of the sea, and an assessment to the level of sea pollution along the coastline.

==== Healthcare ====

On 7 July 2020, Tokayev signed the new code &quot;On public health and healthcare system&quot; and law &quot;On amendments and additions to certain legislative acts on healthcare issues&quot; into place, which strengthened legal protection for medical personnel, introduced a differentiated approach to medical errors, and redefined a citizen&#x27;s rights regarding vaccination. The code also restricted the consumption of e-cigarettes and introduced a ban on the import, production and distribution of snus and other non-smoking tobacco products, as well as introduced administrative responsibility for the sale of tobacco products to persons under the age of 21.

==== Infrastructure ====
Tokayev pledged for the government to continue in investing for the development of infrastructure so that Kazakh citizens would have an access for clean drinking water, natural gas and public transport and continue in monitoring the implementation of the Nurly Zhol programme, of which was enacted by Nazarbayev. He called for the officials along with the Parliament and Accounts Committee to ensure the efficient use of budget funds.

During a visit to Almaty in May 2020, Tokayev was presented with plans for the reconstruction of the Almaty International Airport which included a new terminal, from there he expressed his desire that the Almaty Airport would become largest aviation hub in Central Asia.

===Foreign policy===
Tokayev pledged continuity of foreign policy initiated by his predecessor Nursultan Nazarbayev. This means the continuation of measures to attract foreign investments, multi-vector foreign policy and ensuring security in the region. During his first month in office, he had met 4 world leaders, 2 of them abroad and the other two in Nur-Sultan.

In April 2021, Tokayev signed a decree forming the Special Representative for International Cooperation, claiming that such post would increase attention of Kazakhstan&#x27;s leadership to international cooperation concerns in the light of the dynamically changing global and regional agenda. He appointed Erzhan Kazykhanov to the post, whom was instructed to deal with issues of expanding international cooperation in the humanitarian sphere, climate diplomacy, as well as promoting Kazakhstan&#x27;s key foreign policy initiatives.

During the sixth meeting of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia held on 10–11 October 2021, Tokayev proposed turning the intergovernmental forum into a full-fledged organisation, outlining that the transformation would emphasise Asia&#x27;s new role in global affairs which in turn give the member states commitment to create &quot;a truly common, indivisible, and comprehensive security architecture on the largest continent&quot;.

==== Afghanistan ====

Following the 2021 Taliban offensive, Tokayev urged to take measures in ensuring safety of Kazakhstani citizens and diplomats within Afghanistan, in which Kazakhstan would closely follow its developments. During a meeting with the EU Special Representative for Central Asia Tehri Hakala, Tokayev expressed concern in regards to the stability in Afghanistan, warning that entire region of Central Asian is facing a risk due to the conflict. On 18 August 2021, he instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attempt to provide a maximum assistance in returning ethnic Kazakhs residing in Afghanistan, while noting that the issue of accepting Afghan refugees would not be considered.

==== Russia ====
According to political analyst Rico Isaacs, the decision in Tokayev replacing Nursultan Nazarbayev was due to his own full will to not rapidly implement democratic reforms, which would hurt Nazarbayev&#x27;s legacy of stability and relations with Russia. Just two weeks after taking office, Tokayev visited Moscow in his first foreign state visit on 4 April 2019, meeting with Putin alongside other Russian officials. During the visit, Putin offered Russian assistance to Tokayev in the construction of a proposed nuclear power plant in the country. In June 2019, Tokayev stated that the decision of constructing a nuclear power plants would be made on decision by local matter, if by means of a referendum.

In late 2020, Russian lawmakers Vyacheslav Nikonov and Yevgeny Fyodorov made remarks on how the entire Kazakhstani territory was a gift given by the Soviet Union and that was currently being leased by Russia. This sparked backlash from the Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs which warned about severing relations between both nations due to &quot;provocative attacks&quot;. In response to controversial statements, Tokayev in response on &quot;Egemen Qazaqstan,&quot; wrote that such words from &quot;some foreign citizens&quot; are aimed at &quot;spoiling&quot; relations between two states, insisting that &quot;nobody from outside gave Kazakhs this large territory as a gift.&quot;

After Russia invaded its neighboring Ukraine, Tokayev and Kazakh foreign minister Mukhtar Tleuberdi refused to recognize the Russian puppet states of Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic. He said that &quot;we recognize neither Taiwan, nor Kosovo, nor South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In all likelihood, this principle will be applied to quasi-state entities, which, in our opinion, are Luhansk and Donetsk.&quot; He refused to accept the Order of Alexander Nevsky from Putin.
Tokayev also emphasized that Kazakhstan would comply with Western sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, and that the country &quot;will abide by the restrictions imposed on Russia and Belarus.&quot; In September 2022, Kazakhstan closed a loophole through which Russian and Belarusian trucks were able to import goods from the European Union into the country without the necessary paperwork.

Following Tokayev’s electoral victory in November 2022, international observers expect him to maintain Kazakhstan&#x27;s pivot towards the EU and China, and away from Russia.

In September 2022, Tokayev said that Kazakhstan would help Russians fleeing the mobilization and war in Ukraine, saying that &quot;most of them are forced to leave because of the current hopeless situation.&quot; However, in December 2022, Kazakhstan deported back to Russia a Russian citizen who fled mobilization. In January 2023, Kazakhstan announced they were tightening visa rules, a move that is expected to make it more difficult for Russians to remain in the country.

On 9 May 2023, he attended the Victory Day parade in Moscow and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

==== China ====
Tokayev made a state visit to China in September 2019. There, he met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing of which both leaders agreed to form a permanent comprehensive strategic partnership. Tokayev vowed to triple wheat exports to China to 2 million tonnes possibly including salt, dairy products, meat and poultry as well. During a visit to Peking University, he met with his long-term intern language teacher Liu Shiqing as well as Kazakhstani students. Shiqing described Tokayev as &quot;sociable, active, quick&quot; who became fluent in Chinese and as &quot;one of the best students.&quot;

Tokayev embraces ties with China, which as of 2024 is Kazakhstan&#x27;s most important trading partner and foreign investor.

==== Former Soviet republics ====
On 14 April 2019, Tokayev visited neighboring Uzbekistan for talks with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev. On 16–17 May, Tokayev hosted foreign leaders such as Armen Sarkissian and Mamuka Bakhtadze in the capital for the 12th annual Astana Economic Forum, the first to be hosted by its pioneer, President Nazarbayev. He also hosted the regional leaders of Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Tajikistan, Armenia and Moldova for the Eurasian Economic Union and Supreme Eurasian Economic Council summit on 29 May.

During a visit to Kyrgyzstan in late 2019, he visited the House-Museum of Kyrgyz writer Chingiz Aitmatov in Bishkek, where he met with the late writer&#x27;s wife and reminisced about his first encounters with Aitmatov in Beijing in 1989.

Following the breakout of the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Tokayev called on Armenia to withdraw from the disputed territory, citing the United Nations Security Council accordance to which he claimed that the Armenian government failed to fulfill for its past 30 years.

==== Europe ====

As a foreign minister, Tokayev visited Berlin, Germany on 3–4 October 2006, where he addressed the European Parliament&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Committee on 3 October in an attempt to gain support amongst members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for Kazakhstan&#x27;s bid to lead the organisation in 2009. In his address he discussed the &quot;fierce&quot; competition between the European Union, China, and India to secure energy sources, saying that Kazakhstan is &quot;one of the very few countries capable of boosting its oil production and thus becoming an important alternative energy supplier to global and European markets.&quot; He expressed interest in the Burgas-Alexandroupoli and Odesa-Brody-Gdansk pipeline projects, asking the EU for $80 billion in investment from 2006 to 2021. Tokayev criticised Lithuania for opposing a Russian offer for its Mažeikių oil refinery. He also reaffirmed Kazakhstan&#x27;s desire to join the European Neighbourhood Policy. Tokayev also rejected the proposed construction of the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline to Azerbaijan, in which the EU officials desired due to the likelihood of opposition from other nations bordering the Caspian Sea. Gernot Erler, an official in the German Federal Foreign Office, announced his support for Kazakhstan leading the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) for 2009. Portuguese Socialist MP Ana Gomes said to Tokayev, &quot;Minister, you&#x27;re bidding for the presidency of the OSCE. Yet, the OSCE gave a report on your last elections, on the observation of the elections, which said they failed to meet international standards for genuine elections in many important points. And we hear about political dissent being crushed, we hear even about religious groups being crushed.&quot; Tokayev replied that political opposition forces in Kazakhstan &quot;cannot challenge the government&quot; because of their own weaknesses, and that Kazakhstanis need to be &quot;educated&quot; about democracy because the concept is foreign, and the government considers religious tolerance a priority. He criticized the OSCE&#x27;s election report for &quot;technical irregularities&quot; and biased targeting while calling for more of a &quot;mutual understanding.&quot; He further stated that his government believes it would &quot;contribute a lot as a representative, as a country which is located in Central Asia. The geographical dimension of the OSCE has changed [since Kazakhstan joined], this is a unique Eurasian, as well as Pan-American organization. So, the leadership, the presidency of this organization also must reflect this unique character, [this] unique dimension of the organization.&quot; He cited efforts to reform Kazakhstan&#x27;s election process that included a &quot;special program&quot; to modernize the system and establishing &quot;party dominance&quot; in the Parliament so that &quot;parties [that] win the parliamentary elections, obtain [a] majority in the parliament&quot; and &quot;will be able to establish their own governments.&quot; He called creating a multi-party system in Kazakhstan a &quot;huge step forward in the process of democratization.&quot;

On 4 December 2019, on the eve of a state visit to Germany, he gave an interview to &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot;, in which he called Germany a &quot;key European partner for Kazakhstan&quot;. In that same interview, he drew controversy by saying that he did not believe that the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation was an invasion while also saying that he believed in the &quot;wisdom of the Russian leadership&quot;, drawing condemnation from the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who issued a demarche in response.

==== United States ==== 

Tokayev met with United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Barry Lowenkron, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, on 25 September 2006 in Rice&#x27;s suite at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel. According to Anne Gearan, a diplomatic writer for the &quot;Associated Press&quot;, the U.S. wanted to improve its relations with Kazakhstan. Kazakh oil output was expected to significantly increase, along with other Central Asian countries whom were &quot;more authoritarian, too unstable, too poor, or a combination of all three.&quot; Prior to her meeting with Tokayev, when Rice was asked whether human rights or energy &quot;would top the agenda&quot; for the meeting with Tokayev, she refused to answer. The United States State Department released a statement saying the diplomats discussed Kazakhstan&#x27;s cooperation in Afghanistan and Iraq and expressed hope for &quot;a multidimensional relationship with Kazakhstan, which includes U.S. encouragement for continuing reforms.&quot;
After becoming president, Tokayev maintained strong relations with Kazakhstan&#x27;s strategic allies, including the United States. On 2 February 2020, he met with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during his visit to Astana where both sides expressed the importance of deepening bilateral ties across the entire spectrum of cooperation, including trade, investment, IT technologies, promoting democratic values and combating international terrorism. Pompeo wished for Tokayev in his success in implementing political reforms with an open skies agreement being signed which created a legal basis for launching direct regular flights between Kazakhstan and U.S. According to some analysists, Pompeo&#x27;s visit to Kazakhstan was seen as an attempt to counter China&#x27;s influence within the country as he had met with ethnic Kazakh families of whom were victims of the Xinjiang internment camps and urged for Tokayev to pressure China over its persecution of ethnic Uyghur and Kazakhs.

In June 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump congratulated President Tokayev on his one-year anniversary of presidency. In his congratulatory letter, Trump expressed his support for the reforms that had been undertaken in Kazakhstan, and reaffirmed his intention to further develop strategic partnership between the two countries.

== Political positions ==
Tokayev is described as a &quot;moderate conservative&quot; with years of political experience domestically and internationally. Nevertheless, in an interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Tokayev referred himself as a &quot;reformer&quot;, stressing that without political reforms, there wouldn&#x27;t be progress in economic reforms.

According to &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, Tokayev&#x27;s political capital was seen to not extend beyond the support by Nazarbayev, which enabled him to garner support and trust from business elites, civil servants, and political institutions. Because of that, Tokayev has been described as &quot;Nazarbayev&#x27;s political birthchild&quot;, while his opponents and critics referred him as &quot;furniture&quot; (Russian: мебель, &quot;mebel&quot;), a ridicule term first coined by exiled Kazakh businessman Mukhtar Ablyazov in 2019.

=== Authoritarianism ===
Tokayev expressed his point of view on the political system of Kazakhstan in which he favoured a &quot;strong President, authoritative Parliament, accountable Government.&quot;

In 2005, at the business conference of the Asian Society held in Almaty, Tokayev clashed with George Soros after his remarks about Kazakhstan sliding towards authoritarianism, calling it &quot;unreasonable to demand from a country that recently celebrated its 13th anniversary to achieve the democratic values inherent in states with centuries-old traditions of building a free society.&quot;

=== Climate change ===

Tokayev expressed support for the tackling of climate change, calling it &quot;urgent and existential.&quot; At the Climate Ambitions Summit in which was held remotely on 12 December 2020, Tokayev pledged for Kazakhstan to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 with a development and adoption of a long-term development strategy to lower emissions and de-carbonisation of the economy. He said that Kazakhstan is &quot;highly vulnerable to climate change as a landlocked and developing state&quot; with a heavy reliance on fossil fuels and proposed for the planting for two billion trees within the country in order increase carbon absorption and curb looming desertification problems.

=== Corruption ===

Tokayev described his vision regarding corruption, calling it a &quot;direct damage to national security&quot; and advocated for the need of accountability for implementation of state programs and the use of budget funds by äkıms. On 28 November 2019, he signed the &quot;On Amendments and Additions to Certain Legislative Acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Civil Service and Anti-Corruption Issues&quot; law into place, which obliged government ministers and äkıms to resign if the top officials within institutions are found guilty of corruption.

=== Islam ===
In the aftermath of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting event, Tokayev proclaimed the incident as a &quot;signature dish&quot;, calling it &quot;another manifestation of Islamic radicalism.&quot;

At the Forum of Muslim Scientists of Eurasia which was held in Astana in March 2018, Tokayev addressed the audience the need for the country to have &quot;enlightened Islam&quot; by strengthening science and cultural traditions in the Islamic civilization.

=== Middle-Eastern Affairs ===

=== Jordan ===
On February 19, 2025, His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan met with President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev of Kazakhstan in Astana. During their discussions, both leaders agreed to expand mutual investments and enhance trade relations between their countries. President Tokayev congratulated King Abdullah II on the 25th anniversary of his reign, commending his efforts in promoting sustainable growth and elevating Jordan&#x27;s international standing.

This meeting followed President Tokayev&#x27;s official visit to Jordan from February 18 to 19, 2025, at the invitation of King Abdullah II. The visit aimed to strengthen cooperation in trade, economic, and cultural-humanitarian sectors. The meeting commenced with President Tokayev extending his congratulations to Abdullah II of Jordan on the occasion of the 25th year of the latter’s reign, wishing him continued success in creative initiatives aimed at ensuring sustainable growth and prosperity of the people of Jordan and increasing the authority of the country on the global scene.

The Kazakh President expressed gratitude to the Jordanian leader for his contribution to enhancing friendship and cooperation ties between the two nations.

=== Russian language ===
As president, Tokayev encouraged the Kazakhstani public to learn Kazakh, calling it a &quot;duty of every citizen of Kazakhstan&quot;. At the same time, he believed that strengthening the role of the Kazakh language shouldn&#x27;t infringe on the Russian language, warning that improper handling of the issue would lead to &quot;irreparable consequences&quot; in which he compared to Ukraine that faced interethnic conflicts.

During the 2021 State of the Nation Address, Tokayev noted that Russian is an official language within Kazakhstan, adding that its use can&#x27;t be hindered in accordance to the law and from there, he obliged to punish to any person taking part in discriminating on the basis of &quot;linguistic and national grounds&quot;, a move that was viewed to have occurred in result of a backlash by Russian officials after a viral incident on YouTube showing Kostanay native Quat Ahmetov visiting places and forcing employees to speak Kazakh which led to a series of criminal cases by security agencies and Ahmetov fleeing the country.

=== Nationalism ===
In a written article for &quot;The Astana Times&quot;, Tokayev warned against nationalism becoming &quot;a resurgent and dominant global phenomenon&quot;, upon which he cited Donald Trump&#x27;s victory in the 2016 United States presidential election, suggesting it would result in a strong impact on world politics, as well as on the domestic situation in many nations including European nations.

Tokayev expressed a negative attitude towards nationalism which he claimed to have gained traction in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, criticising the ideology for provoking conflict between nations that would result in economic losses for Kazakhstan.

<text>Inigo Montoya is a fictional character in William Goldman&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;The Princess Bride.&quot; In Rob Reiner&#x27;s 1987 film adaptation, he was portrayed by Mandy Patinkin. In both the book and the movie, he was originally from Spain and resided in the fictional country of Florin.

==Character background==
In &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, Inigo Montoya is portrayed as a Spanish fencer and henchman to the Sicilian criminal Vizzini. Inigo&#x27;s father Domingo was a great swordsmith, but he remained obscure because he disliked dealing with the rich and privileged. When Count Rugen, a nobleman with a six-fingered right hand, asked him to forge a sword to accommodate his unusual grip, Domingo labored over the sword for a year. When Rugen returned, he would not pay his promised price. Thus, Domingo refused to sell him the sword, not as a matter of money, but because Count Rugen could not appreciate the great work of the sword. He proclaimed that the sword would now belong to Inigo. Rugen then promptly killed Domingo. Eleven-year-old Inigo witnessed the crime and challenged Rugen to a fight, wherein Rugen disarmed Inigo in under a minute, but was genuinely disconcerted by the boy&#x27;s skill at fencing; recognizing Inigo&#x27;s talent, Rugen spared his life and allowed him to keep the sword, but gave him two scars, one on each cheek.

Inigo then went to live with his father&#x27;s friend and fellow swordmaker Yeste for two years; devastated by the loss, he devoted himself to becoming a great swordsman to be able to avenge his father. His training included tutelage under the most skilled fencing masters of his time. In the 30th anniversary version of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, it is revealed that, while training for his revenge against Count Rugen, Inigo falls in love with a servant girl, Giulietta. He woos her, and she reveals that she is a Countess and is in love with him as well. The two dance, and it is implied that Inigo leaves the next day. After ten years of training, Inigo becomes the greatest swordsman of his generation and the only living man to hold the rank of &quot;wizard&quot; (a fictional fencing rank above &quot;master&quot;).

==In &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; film==

Unable to find his father&#x27;s killer and fearing that he would never fulfill his quest, Inigo sinks into depression and alcoholism before the criminal Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) finds him. Vizzini, Inigo, and a Turk named Fezzik (Andre the Giant) are hired by an unknown man to kidnap and kill the &quot;princess bride&quot;, Buttercup. Subsequent events lead to Inigo&#x27;s duel with the &quot;Man in Black&quot; (Westley), an extended sequence in both the book and the movie, in which both contestants begin fencing left-handed and eventually convert to their dominant right hands as the contest intensifies. Westley eventually bests Inigo in the battle, but spares his life (knocking Inigo unconscious instead) out of respect for his abilities.

When Inigo regains consciousness, he enters the Thieves&#x27; Quarter of Florin City, falls into depression, and becomes a useless drunkard once more. Eventually, Fezzik finds him and helps him regain his health. They eventually rescue Westley from Rugen&#x27;s torture chamber but find, to their chagrin, that he appears to be dead. In desperation, they take him to Miracle Max, the late king&#x27;s former &quot;miracle man&quot;, who tells them that Westley is only &quot;mostly dead&quot;. Inigo persuades Max to help by appealing to Max&#x27;s hatred of Prince Humperdinck, who had fired him, and they bring Westley back to life.

That night, Inigo joins Westley to fight Humperdinck, and finally confronts his father&#x27;s killer with the words he had waited half his life to say:

Rugen runs away. Inigo chases him throughout the castle until Rugen suddenly throws a knife at him and seriously wounds him, mocking his quest as he prepares to deliver the fatal blow. At the last second, Inigo recovers his strength and duels his father&#x27;s murderer, repeating his fateful words as he corners Rugen, inflicting on him the same dueling scars. Rugen begs for his life and offers to give Inigo anything he wants before trying to attack him again; Inigo catches Rugen&#x27;s sword arm and replies, &quot;I want my father back, you son of a bitch,&quot; as he kills him.

That scene from the film was ranked #86 by IGN in their list of &quot;Top 100 Movie Moments&quot;. Mandy Patinkin has said that his inspiration for the scene was the real-life loss of his father to cancer and the feeling that his character killing Rugen would bring him back.

The film and the novel have slightly different endings for Inigo. At the end of the film, having avenged his father and thus no longer in &quot;the revenge business&quot;, Inigo ponders what he will do with the rest of his life. In response, Westley offers Inigo a position as successor to &quot;The Dread Pirate Roberts&quot;. The novel ends with Inigo&#x27;s wounds reopening while he is on the run from the Brute Squad, leaving his future in doubt, although the narrator speculates he managed to escape.

==Plot==

===&quot;Daughter of the Blood&quot;===
&quot;Seven hundred years ago, a Black Widow witch saw an ancient prophecy come to life in her web of dreams and visions. Now the Dark Realm readies itself for the arrival of its Queen, a Witch who will wield more power than even the High Lord of Hell himself. But she is still young, still open to influence - and corruption. Whoever controls the Queen controls the darkness. Three men—sworn enemies—know this. And they know the power that hides behind the blue eyes of an innocent young girl. And so begins a ruthless game of politics and intrigue, magic and betrayal, where the weapons are hate and love—and the prize could be terrible beyond imagining.&quot;

&quot;Jaenelle is destined to rule the Blood, if she can reach adulthood. Saetan, High Lord of Hell and most powerful of the Blood males, becomes Jaenelle&#x27;s surrogate father and teacher. He cannot protect her outside Hell, where he rules. She refuses to leave Terreille, risking herself to protect or heal other victims of violence. Can Daemon, Saetan&#x27;s estranged son, keep her safe from the machinations of the evil High Priestess?&quot;

===&quot;Heir to the Shadows&quot;===
Jaenelle&#x27;s adoptive father, Saetan, and her foster-family of demons shelter her. To restore her memory and emotional balance, they move to Kaeleer, where Jaenelle gathers a circle of young Queens. She also heals Lucivar, Daemon&#x27;s half-brother, who offers a brother&#x27;s love and a warrior&#x27;s fealty. As she recovers strength and memory, Jaenelle resolves to restore Daemon and cleanse Terreille. She claims her place as Queen of Ebon Askavi and secures Kaeleer from the growing threat of Tereille and the corruption that exists there.
===&quot;Queen of the Darkness&quot;===
Jaenelle Angelline now reigns as Queen-protector of the Shadow Realm. No longer will the corrupt Blood slaughter her people and defile her lands. But where one chapter ends, a final, unseen battle remains to be written, and Jaenelle must unleash the terrible power that is Witch to destroy her enemies once and for all.

Even so, she cannot stand alone. Somewhere, long lost in madness, is Daemon, her promised Consort. Only his unyielding love can complete her Court and secure her reign. Yet, even together, their strength may not be enough to hold back the most malevolent of forces.

===&quot;The Invisible Ring&quot;===
A powerful warlord named Jared, who has been a pleasure slave for nine years, goes up for sale at a slave auction. He expects to end up working in the salt mines, but instead is purchased by a mysterious, powerful and feared witch, the Gray Lady.

Dorothea SaDiablo, High Priestess of Hayll, is a member of a long-lived race who is working to rule or control the entirety of the world of Terreille. The Gray Lady has been fighting her and so Dorothea decides to have her assassinated as she travels to her home territory from the slave auction.

The Gray Lady receives a mysterious warning about the attempt to kill her so she buys a wagon and horses and sets off cross-country with her new slaves, hoping to elude her killers. During the trip, Jared discovers that they are traveling not with the Grey Lady but rather her granddaughter, Lady Arabella Ardelia. He also discovers that he is in love with her.

The chase leads them to Jared&#x27;s boyhood home where he discovers that Dorothea&#x27;s forces have already killed all of the witches in the area and most of his family, including his parents. With the help of the few who remain, they defeat Dorothea&#x27;s army and escape into the Gray Lady&#x27;s territory. Jared is encouraged by Daemon Sadi to follow his heart and to help Lady Ardelia in her fight against Dorothea to preserve as much as possible that is good for the eventual coming of The prophesied Witch who will have the power to defeat Dorothea and cleanse the blood of the taint she has spread.

===&quot;Dreams Made Flesh&quot;===
Dreams Made Flesh consists of four stories.

The first tells the story of how the Arachnids became the first race to possess Craft after the Dragons.

The second story tells of how Lucivar Yaslana meets, courts, and marries his wife. It takes place after the events in Heir to the Shadows and before Queen of the Darkness.

The third story tells some of the backstory of Saetan Daemon SaDiablo, and how his then-wife Hekatah tried to manipulate him, including sacrificing his newborn son. It concludes with the terrible retribution he exacted.

The fourth story tells of Daemon Sadi and Jaenelle and how they began to rebuild their lives after the conclusion of Queen of the Darkness.

==Characters==

* Jaenelle Angelline is the main character, (though the story is never told from her point of view) the young witch destined to become Queen of the Darkness, aka &quot;Witch&quot;. (Witch is Dreams Made Flesh—the incarnation of dreams heard and then woven into tangled webs by the Weaver of Dreams, or the Queen Weaver, a small spider found on Arachnia) She has 12 uncut Jewels, one of every color, for her Birthright, along with the 13 uncut Black Jewels. After her offering, that she offered only 6 of her black jewels, she came away with the Ebony Jewels. She lost most of her power after the war, but was granted another new Jewel: Twilight&#x27;s Dawn. With Twilight&#x27;s Dawn, she is able to do the simple craft that she was not able to do before like call in her own shoes.
* Daemon Sadi (SaDiablo) is the son of Saetan and the broken Black Widow, Tersa, and fiercely loves Jaenelle/Witch to whom he proclaims being destined to be Witch&#x27;s lover. He, like his father and brother, is a Warlord Prince with Birthright Red Jewels. He later descended to Black Jewels after his offering to the Darkness. He and his father are the only known Black Widow males in history. His father became one through craft, while Daemon is the only natural Black Widow male in the history of the blood. He is also known as &quot;the Sadist&quot; for enjoyment and use of pain in the bedroom during his years as a pleasure slave in the courts of queens tainted by Dorothea and Dorothea herself. He is the strongest male in the history of the Blood.
* Saetan Daemon SaDiablo is the High Lord of Hell, High Priest of the Hourglass, and Warlord Prince of Dhemlan. He is Jaenelle&#x27;s spiritual and adopted father. He received an uncut Birthright Red Jewel, and received an uncut Black Jewel after his Offering to the Darkness. He is the second strongest Male in all the realms, after his son, Daemon.
* Lucivar Yaslana (SaDiablo) is the son of Saetan and the Eyrien Luthvian. Lucivar, a half-Eyrien, has batlike wings, and has a strong brotherly love for Jaenelle. His Jewels are the birthright Red, then later descended to Ebon Gray. Like his brother, Daemon, he was enslaved as an adolescent and forced to serve in the courts of Dorothea and her followers. His explosive temper sent him to the salt mines of Pruul. He is the third strongest male in the Realms, after Sadi and Saetan.
* Surreal SaDiablo is a prostitute and assassin. Her Jewels are birthright Green, and later descended to Gray. She is the daughter of Titian, the result of her mother&#x27;s rape by Kartane SaDiablo, making Surreal a Hayllian and Dea al Mon half-breed.
*Dorothea SaDiablo is the incestuous High Priestess of Hayll. She is a member of the Hourglass Black Widow coven. Birthright jewel Blood Opal/later descended to Red.
*Kartane SaDiablo is the son of Dorothea SaDiablo. He was also once a close friend of Daemon Sadi. He is also Surreal&#x27;s father, having raped Titian. He was also one of Briarwood&#x27;s &quot;uncles.&quot; Birthright Blood Opal/descended to Red.
*Hekatah is the demon dead, self-proclaimed High Priestess of Hell, and the former wife of Saetan SaDiablo. She instigated the wars between Kaeleer and Terreille. Birthright jewel Blood Opal/descended to Red. Hayllian born, and died in the great war between Terreille and Kaeleer. She is also the mother of Mephis, Peyton and another son which she killed in order to manipulate Saetan SaDiablo. Hekatah also gave birth to Andulvar Yaslana&#x27;s child, Ravenar. She is behind many of Dorothea&#x27;s plots in an ultimate attempt to make herself ruler of all the Realms.
*Robert Benedict claims to be the father of Jaenelle Angeline. He participates as an &#x27;uncle&#x27; of the hospital known as Briarwood, helping to fund it. There Blood males subject underage Blood females to perverse tortures, including rape. He is also an influential member of the male council in Chaillot, the goals of which undermine the power of the matriarchal system and thus his mother-in-law, the Queen of Chaillot. Birthright unknown descended to Yellow.
*Jarvis Jenkell is a newly discovered Blood male who attempts, in the novel &quot;Tangled Webs&quot;, to disclose his nature through his writing. When his semi-autobiographical &quot;Landry Langston&quot; novels are mocked by the Blood, he and three Black Widows, including an unwitting Tersa, create a haunted house intended to punish and ultimately kill members of the SaDiablo family and Blood who made a mockery of his book.

===Kindred===
The Kindred are animals who have been granted their own Jewels and are fully Blood. Jaenelle reestablishes the connection between Kindred and human Blood, which was broken in the war between Terreille and Kaeleer started by Hekatah. Most humans discount Kindred&#x27;s power and intelligence as myth, and need personal experience with one to accept them.

==Jewels and Blood hierarchy/castes==
There are two main, interconnected hierarchical systems among the Blood. The first is the Jewel system. In a society with a high tolerance for violence, Jewel ranking gives an immediate sense of innate power. The darker a person&#x27;s Jewel, the more dangerous they are. They have greater Craft (magic) abilities and higher metabolisms, as well as significant political advantages over lighter Jeweled Blood. The Jewels themselves act as reservoirs of power. The Blood are able to use some Craft without tapping into their Jewels but the vast majority of their abilities require them. Using too much Craft and draining a reservoir can potentially shatter a Jewel and permanently render a person unable to access that power. Adult members of the Blood typically have two full sets of Jewels, a Birthright and the one they &quot;wear&quot;. While Jewels are typically worn out in the open, the Blood are able to sense Jewel rank to a certain extent (multiple instances show that this ability is easy to confuse, especially if the bearer wears their Birthright instead of their actual Jewel).

Jewels fall into thirteen ranks with darker colors being stronger. They are: White, Yellow, Tiger Eye, Rose, Summer-sky, Purple Dusk, Opal, Green, Sapphire, Red, Gray, Ebon-gray and Black. 

Members of the Blood undergo two ceremonies to determine their innate strength. The darker the Jewel, the stronger the person is. During the Birthright Ceremony, which occurs in childhood, they may or may not walk away with a Jewel. It is unheard of to receive anything darker than Red as Birthright. The only known exception to this being Jaenelle Angelline. A second ceremony is done at the age of majority. Called the Offering to the Darkness, it lasts from sunset to sunrise. When making the Offering to the Darkness, a person can descend a maximum of three ranks from his/her Birthright Jewel. Example: Birthright White could descend to Rose. If a darker Jewel is received, both sets of Jewels are kept after the ceremony. The new Jewel is used as the day to day Jewel and becomes the person&#x27;s rank, while the Birthright is kept as an additional reservoir. It is considered especially fortuitous for a person to receive an uncut Jewel (i.e., one never used before). Uncut Jewels are large enough to make a ring, a pendant, and shards, all of which are kept and used. In the case of a cut Jewel, the recipient will receive the same amount of Jewel.

It is possible for a person who did not receive a Jewel during the birthright ceremony to receive a White, Yellow, or Tiger-Eye Jewel during their offering to darkness ceremony, since they can &#x27;descend&#x27; a maximum of three power ranks at this time. Rank can only decrease when a person has been &quot;broken&quot;. When a person is broken, one or more of their Inner Webs are pierced and they are permanently separated from the power in their Jewels. This can be done either during a Virgin Night when a woman is especially vulnerable or through a blast of power. The former is far more common than the latter. Breaking a virgin is a widespread act used for profit and enjoyment and is part of the recurring theme of sexual violence in the series. Broken individuals are still able to use some Craft. If the woman conceives a child from the rape they still have the ability through craft to abort the child, but will be rendered infertile after they do. They do not lose their caste. The other layer of innate hierarchy among the Blood is the Blood Hierarchy/Castes. 

;Males:
* Landen - non-Blood of any race
* Blood male - a general term for all males of the Blood; also refers to any Blood male who doesn&#x27;t wear Jewels
* Warlord - a Jeweled male equal in status to a witch
* Prince - a Jeweled male equal in status to a Priestess or a Healer; also used as a form of address for Warlord Princes
* Warlord Prince - a dangerous, extremely aggressive Jeweled male; in status, slightly lower than a Queen

;Females:
* Landen - non-Blood of any race
* Blood female - a general term for all females of the Blood; mostly refers to any Blood female who doesn&#x27;t wear Jewels
* Witch - a Blood female who wears Jewels but isn&#x27;t one of the other hierarchical levels; also refers to any Jeweled female
* Healer - a witch who heals physical wounds and illnesses; equal in status to a Priestess and a Prince
* Priestess - a witch who cares for altars, Sanctuaries, and Dark Altars; witnesses handfasts and marriages; performs offering; equal in status to a Healer and a Prince
* Black Widow - a witch who heals the mind; weaves the tangled webs of dreams and visions; is trained in illusions and poisons; in extremely rare cases, may be male
* Queen - a witch who rules the Blood; is considered to be the land&#x27;s heart and the Blood&#x27;s moral center; as such, she is the focal point of their society

The basic unit of Blood society and government is a Queen and her Court. To create a Court, she must be at the age of majority and have twelve males who agree to be in her First Circle. While Queens are the rarest females, they are not uncommon and most Territories have a Territory Queen who rules over Province Queens, who in turn rule over District Queens. Warlords and Warlord Princes are occasionally appointed to act as rulers of small areas under the auspices of a Queen. It is highly unorthodox for a witch who is not a Queen to rule. The Blood possess some ability to sense and mask their psychic scent (the combination of their Jewel ranking, caste, and personal &quot;scent&quot;). It seems that darker Jewels are better able to both sense and mask psychic scents. Jewel rank is considered less important than overall caste. A low-ranking Queen in term of Jewels outranks a high-ranking witch and a low-ranking Warlord Prince outranks a Prince. Within caste, the higher ranking the Jewel, the higher ranking the person. A lighter Jeweled Queen is unlikely to become a Territory Queen if there are darker Jeweled Queens available. Within caste, males automatically defer to the darkest Jeweled male. In addition, the Blood are a matriarchal society. Males are supposed to defer to females. Because of physical and Jewel discrepancies in strength, Protocol is used to keep a precarious balance.

<text>The Community Broadcasting Association of Australia (CBAA) is the peak body and the national representative organisation for community radio and television stations in Australia. The CBAA provide leadership, advocacy and support for members to actively provide independent broadcasting services and to build and strengthen local communities. The organisation provides advice and support to community broadcasters regarding a variety of issues.

The CBAA runs the Community Radio Network, offers a national satellite network, that allows community broadcasters to share and syndicate their content, manages the Australian Music Radio Airplay Project (Amrap), CBOnline, a sector information and research unit, runs the digital radio project and publishes CBX magazine. As the peak body for the sector, the CBAA represents the sector through policy submissions, advocacy and campaigns.

The Community Radio Network service has been expanded in recent years with the addition of the Digital Delivery Network (DDN). This project has allowed community radio stations to record and replay programs, interviews, and music from contributing stations within the network.

Recently the association has launched a podcast hosting service, C pod.

The organisation also runs an annual Conference, which brings together representatives from around Australia.

== Member stations ==
The CBAA, as the recognised peak body for community broadcasting in Australia, has members from a diverse range of independently operated not-for-profit community based radio stations.

The station types include:

* General Community (Geographical Area based stations)
* Christian / Religious (Religious stations, usually Christian, now includes Muslim services)
* Youth (Student and general youth stations)
* Indigenous (Indigenous / Aboriginal / Torres Strait Islands)
* Print Handicapped (RPH and affiliates)
* Specialist Music (Broad or specific genre stations - e.g.: Classical, jazz etc.)
* Progressive (used to describe Left leaning, mainly talk based radio services)
* Senior Citizens (Over 60&#x27;s - oldies music for senior citizens)
* Sport

In most cases, each licensee is the operator of a single station, in some cases with translators and repeaters to provide services in otherwise poor reception areas.

==First Sounds==
First Sounds is a collaborative effort by the CBAA and First Nations Media Australia to get more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists played and heard in the Australian radio music industry.

== Member services ==

The CBAA operates to provide advice and representation to the members. It also offers insurance plans for volunteers, music broadcasting rights and news copyright fees at discounted rates for its members.

The CBAA also consults with its members on matters including broadcast licensing, the relevant Code of Practice (Community Radio), and provides training and legal advice.

== History ==
The CBAA was born out of the Public Broadcasting Association of Australia (PBAA). That organisation was founded during the 1970s in response to the rapidly developing sector.

However, changes in funding for the sector during the 1980s sparked a crisis. As government funding was re-directed, the stations were less able to support themselves, or the peak body. This pressure culminated in near bankruptcy for the PBAA.

In 1988 the PBAA was dissolved and from its ashes, the new CBAA arose, under strict financial management, and a focus on membership support.

<text>The Portuguese people ( – masculine – or &quot;Portuguesas&quot;) are a Romance-speaking ethnic group and nation indigenous to Portugal, a country that occupies the west side of the Iberian Peninsula in south-west Europe, who share culture, ancestry and language.

The Portuguese state began with the founding of the County of Portugal in 868. Following the Battle of São Mamede (1128), Portugal gained international recognition as a kingdom through the Treaty of Zamora and the papal bull Manifestis Probatum. This Portuguese state paved the way for the Portuguese people to unite as a nation.

The Portuguese explored distant lands previously unknown to Europeans—in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania (southwest Pacific Ocean). In 1415, with the conquest of Ceuta, the Portuguese took a significant role in the Age of Discovery, which culminated in a colonial empire. It was one of the first global empires and one of the world&#x27;s major economic, political and military powers in the 15th and 16th centuries, with territories that became part numerous countries. Portugal helped to launch the spread of Western civilization to other geographies.

During and after the period of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese diaspora spread across the world.

== Ancestry ==

The Portuguese people&#x27;s heritage largely derives from the Indo-European (&quot;Lusitanians, Conii&quot;), and Celtic peoples (&quot;Gallaecians, Turduli and Celtici&quot;). They were later Romanized after the Roman conquest. The Portuguese language–the native language of the overwhelming majority of Portuguese people–stems from Vulgar Latin.

A number of male Portuguese lineages descend from Germanic tribes who arrived as ruling elites after the Roman period, starting in 409. These included the Suebi, Buri, Hasdingi Vandals and Visigoths. The pastoral North Caucasus&#x27; Alans left traces in a few central-southern areas (e.g. Alenquer, from &quot;Alen Kerke&quot; or &quot;Temple of the Alans&quot;).

The Umayyad conquest of Iberia, between the early 8th century until the 12th century, also left small Moorish, Jewish and Saqaliba genetic contributions. Other minor – as well as later – influences include small Viking settlements between the 9th and 11th centuries, made by Norsemen who raided coastal areas mainly in the northern regions of Douro and Minho. Low-incidence, pre-Roman influence came from Phoenicians and Greeks in southern coastal areas.

== Name ==
The name Portugal is a portmanteau that comes from the Latin word &quot;Portus&quot; (meaning port) and a second word &quot;Cale&quot;, whose meaning and origin are unclear. &quot;Cale&quot; is probably a reminder of the Gallaeci (also known as Callaeci), a Celtic tribe that lived in part of Northern Portugal.

Alternatively the name may have come from the early settlement of Cale (today&#x27;s Gaia), situated on the mouth of the Douro River on the Atlantic coast (&quot;Portus Cale&quot;). The name Cale seems to come from the Celts – perhaps from one of their specifications, &quot;Cailleach&quot; – but which, in everyday life, was synonymous with shelter, anchorage or door. Among other theories, some suggest that Cale may stem from the Greek word for &quot;kalós&quot; (beautiful). Another theory for Portugal postulates a French derivation, &quot;Portus Gallus&quot; &quot;port of the Gauls&quot;.

During the Middle Ages, the area around Cale became known through the Visigoths as &quot;Portucale&quot;. Portucale could have evolved in the 7th and 8th centuries, to become &quot;Portugale&quot;, or Portugal, from the 9th century. The term denoted the area between the Douro and Minho rivers.

== Early inhabitants ==
Portuguese origins are predominantly from Southern and Western Europe. The earliest modern humans inhabiting Portugal are believed to have arrived in the Iberian Peninsula 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. Y-chromosome and mtDNA data suggest that modern Portuguese trace a proportion of these lineages to the paleolithic peoples who began settling the European continent at the end of the last glaciation around 45,000 years ago.
Northern Iberia is believed to have been a major Ice age refuge from which Paleolithic humans later colonized Europe. Migrations from northern Iberia during the Paleolithic and Mesolithic link modern Iberians to much of Western Europe, particularly the British Isles and Atlantic Europe.

Y-chromosome haplogroup R1b is the most common haplogroup in the Iberian peninsula and western Europe. One of the best-characterized of Iberian haplotypes is the Atlantic Modal Haplotype (AMH). This haplotype reaches the highest frequencies there and in the British Isles. In Portugal it reckons generally 65% in the South, ranging from 87-96% northwards.

=== Neolithic ===

The Neolithic colonization of Europe from Western Asia and the Middle East, beginning around 10,000 years ago, reached Iberia after reaching the rest of the continent. According to the demic diffusion model its impact was greatest in the southern and eastern regions.

=== Celts and Indo-Europeans ===
In the 3rd millennium BC, during the Bronze Age, the first wave of migrations by Indo-European language speakers into Iberia occurred. The expansion of haplogroup R1b in Western Europe, most common in many areas of Atlantic Europe, was primarily due to massive migrations from the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Eastern Europe during the Bronze Age, along with carriers of Indo-European languages like proto-Celtic and proto-Italic. Unlike older studies on uniparental markers, large amounts of autosomal DNA were analyzed in addition to paternal Y-DNA. An autosomal component was detected in modern Europeans that was not present in the Neolithic or Mesolithic, and which entered Europe with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as the Indo-European languages.
The first immigrations of Indo-European language speakers were followed by waves of Celts. The Celts arrived in Portugal about 3,000 years ago. Migration was particularly intense from the 7th to the 5th centuries BC.

These two processes defined Iberia&#x27;s cultural landscape &quot;Continental in the northwest and Mediterranean towards the southeast&quot;, as historian José Mattoso described.

The northwest–southeast cultural shift also shows in genetic differences: based on 2016 findings, haplogroup H, a cluster within the haplogroup R category, is more prevalent along the Atlantic façade, including the Cantabrian Coast and Portugal. Its highest frequency is in Galicia (northwestern corner of Iberia). The frequency of haplogroup H shows a decreasing trend from the Atlantic façade toward the Mediterranean.

This finding adds strong evidence that Galicia and Northern Portugal was a cul-de-sac population, a kind of European edge for a major ancient central European migration. An interesting pattern of genetic continuity exists along the Cantabria coast and Portugal, a pattern observed previously when minor sub-clades of the mtDNA phylogeny were examined.

Given the Paleolithic and Neolithic origins, as well as Bronze Age and Iron Age Indo-European migrations, the Portuguese ethnic origin was mainly a mixture of pre-Celts or para-Celts, such as the Lusitanians of Lusitania, and Celtic peoples such as Gallaeci of Gallaecia, the Celtici and the Cynetes of Alentejo and the Algarve.

== Pre-Roman populations ==

===Lusitanians===
The Lusitanians (or Lusitānus – singular – Lusitani – plural – in Latin) were an Indo-European people living in the Western Iberian Peninsula long before it became the Roman province of Lusitania (modern Portugal, Extremadura and part of Salamanca). They spoke Lusitanian, of which only a few short written fragments survive. Most Portuguese consider Lusitanians as their ancestors, although the northern regions (Minho, Douro, Trás-os-Montes) identify more with Gallaecians. Linguists such as Ellis Evans claimed that Gallaecian-Lusitanian was one language (thus not separate languages) of the &quot;p&quot; Celtic variant. They were a large tribe who lived between Douro and Tagus rivers.

The Lusitanians may have originated in the Alps and settled in the region in the 6th century BC. Scholars such as Dáithí Ó hÓgáin consider them to be indigenous. He claimed they were initially dominated by the Celts, before gaining full independence. Romanian archaeologist , active in Portugal for many years, proposed that they were originally a tribal Celtic group, related to the Lusones.

The first area settled by the Lusitanians was probably the Douro Valley and the region of Beira Alta; they subsequently moved south, and expanded on both sides of the Tagus river, before the Roman conquest.

The Lusitanians originated from either Proto-Celtic or Proto-Italic populations who spread from Central Europe into western Europe after Yamnaya migrations into the Danube Valley, while Proto-Germanic and Proto-Balto-Slavic may have developed east of the Carpathian Mountains, in present-day Ukraine, moving north and spreading with the Corded Ware culture in Middle Europe (third millennium BCE). One theory claimed that a European branch of Indo-European dialects, termed &quot;North-west Indo-European&quot; and associated with the Bell Beaker culture, may have been ancestral to Celtic, Italic, Germanic, and Balto-Slavic lanaguages.

The Lusitanians&#x27; Celtic root, is further emphasized by research by the Max Planck Institute on the origins of Indo-European languages. One study identified one common Celtic branch of peoples and languages spanning most of Atlantic Europe, including Lusitania, at around 7,000 BC. This work contradicts previous theories that excluded Lusitanian from the Celtic linguistic family.

In Roman times, the Roman province of Lusitania was extended north of the areas occupied by the Lusitanians to include the territories of Asturias and Gallaecia, but these were soon ceded to the jurisdiction of the &quot;Provincia Tarraconensis&quot; in the north, while the south remained the &quot;Provincia Lusitania et Vettones&quot;. After this, Lusitania&#x27;s northern border was along the Douro river, while its eastern border passed through &quot;Salmantica&quot; and &quot;Caesarobriga&quot; to the &quot;Anas&quot; (Guadiana) river.

===Other Pre-Roman groups===
As the Lusitanians fought the Romans, the name Lusitania was adopted by the Gallaeci, tribes living north of the Douro, and other surrounding tribes, eventually spreading as a label to the nearby peoples fighting Roman rule in western Iberia. This led the Romans to name their original province in the area, which initially covered the entire western side of the Iberian peninsula, Lusitania.
==Romanization==

Rome conquered the peninsula during the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C. from Carthage during the Punic Wars.

After 193 B.C., the Lusitanians fought Rome&#x27;s expansion peninsula following the defeat and occupation of Carthage in North Africa. They fought for years, repeatedly defeating the Roman invaders. In the end they were punished by Praetor Servius Galba in 150 B.C. He killed 9,000 Lusitanians and later sold 20,000 more as slaves to the Roman provinces in Gaul (modern France).

Three years later (147 B.C.), Viriathus became the leader of the Lusitanians and attacked Roman rule in Lusitania and beyond. He commanded a confederation of Celtic tribes and prevented Roman expansion with guerrilla warfare. In 139 B.C. Viriathus was betrayed and killed in his sleep by his companions (emissaries to the Romans), Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus, bribed by Marcus Popillius Laenas. However, when Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus returned to receive their reward, Consul Quintus Servilius Caepio ordered their execution, declaring, &quot;Rome does not pay traitors&quot;. Viriathus was the first Portuguese &#x27;national hero&#x27; . After Viriathus&#x27; rule, the celticized Lusitanians largely adopted romanized culture and the Latin language.

Lusitanian inhabitants, following the rest of the Roman-Iberian peninsula, eventually gained the status of &quot;Citizens of Rome&quot;. Many saints emerged from the territory. These include Saint Engrácia, Saint Quitéria, and Saint Marina of Aguas Santas.

The Romans impacted the population, both genetically and culturally; the Portuguese language derives mostly from Latin, mostly a later evolution of the Roman language after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. According to Mario Pei, the phonetic distance found between Portuguese and Latin stands at 31%. Roman domination lasted from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD.

== Middle Ages ==
After the Romans, Germanic peoples, namely the Suebi, the Buri, and the Visigoths (an estimated 2–3% of the population), ruled the peninsula for centuries and assimilated into the local population. Some of the Vandals (Silingi and Hasdingi) and Alans lingered. The Suebians were the most numerous Germanic tribes. Portugal and Galicia, (along with Catalonia which was part of the Frankish Kingdom), are the regions with the highest ratios of Germanic Y-DNA.

Other influences include small Viking settlements between the 9th and 11th centuries, made by Norsemen who raided coastal areas mainly in Douro and Minho.
The Moors occupied what is now Portugal from the 8th century until the Reconquista movement expelled them in 1249. Some 2.000 of their population, mainly Berbers and Christian Jews became New Christians (&quot;Cristãos novos&quot;); some descendants of these people are still identifiable by their new surnames. Several genetic studies, including the most comprehensive genome-wide studies published on historical and modern populations of the Iberian Peninsula, conclude that the Moorish occupation left few to no Jewish, Arab and Berber genetic influences throughout Iberia, with higher incidence in the south and west, and ower incidence in the northeast, and almost none in Basque Country.

Following the end of the Reconquista and the Conquest of Faro, religious and ethnic minorities such as the so-called &quot;new Christians&quot; or the &quot;Ciganos&quot; (Roma gypsies) later suffered persecution from the state and the Inquisition. As a consequence, many were expelled, condemned, and subjected to auto-da-fé, or fled the country, creating a Jewish diaspora in the Netherlands, England, US, Brazil, Balkans, and beyond.

== Portuguese Nation (868-) ==

The political origin of the Portuguese state is in the founding of County of Portugal in 868 (; in period documents the name used was Portugalia). It was the first time that a cohesive nationalism emerged there, as even during the Roman Era, the indigenous populations were from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds.

Although the country began as a county, after the Battle of São Mamede on 24 June 1128 Portugal was officially recognised as a kingdom via the Treaty of Zamora and the papal bull Manifestis Probatum of Pope Alexander III. The establishment of the Portuguese state in the 12th century led the Portuguese to group together as a nation.

A subsequent turning point in Portuguese nationalism was the Battle of Aljubarrota in 1385, linked to Brites de Almeida, thereby putting an end to Castilian ambitions to take over the Portuguese throne.

== Genetic comparisons ==

The Portuguese share some DNA with the Basques. The results of the present HLA study in Portuguese populations show that they have features in common with Basques and some Madrid-area Spaniards: a high frequency of the HLA-haplotypes A29-B44-DR7 (ancient Western Europeans) and A1-B8-DR3 are common characteristics. Many Portuguese and Basques do not show the Mediterranean A33-B14-DR1 haplotype, confirming a lower admixture with Mediterraneans.

The Portuguese have one unique characteristic: a high frequency of HLA-A25-B18-DR15 and A26-B38-DR13, which may reflect a founder effect from ancient Portuguese, i.e., Oestriminis and Cynetes. According to an early genetic study, the Portuguese are a relatively distinct population according to HLA data, as they have a high frequency of the HLA-A25-B18-DR15 and A26-B38-DR13 genes, the latter is a unique Portuguese marker. In Europe, the A25-B18-DR15 gene is found only in Portugal; it also observed in some North Americans and in Brazilians (very likely of Portuguese ancestry).

The pan-European haplotype A1-B8-DR3 and the western-European haplotype A29-B44-DR7 are shared by Portuguese, Basques, and Spaniards. The latter is also common in Irish, southern English, and western French populations.

Men from mainland Portugal, the Azores and Madeira belonged to 78–83% of the &quot;Western European&quot; haplogroup R1b, and Mediterranean J and E3b.

The comparative table shows statistics by haplogroups of Portuguese men with men of European countries, and communities.

Culturally and linguistically, the Portuguese are close to Galicians. The similarities among the two groups are pronounced. Galician and Portuguese may be the same language (&quot;see also: Reintegrationism&quot;).

== Demography ==

===Demographics===

Around 9.15 million (87%) Portuguese-born people live in the country, out of a total population of 10.467 million.

About 782,000 foreigners live legally in the country (7%), thus approximately 9.685 million people living in Portugal hold Portuguese citizenship or legal residency.

The median age stood at 46.8 years (versus 44.4 in the EU as a whole) as of 2023. People aged 65 or more accounted for 23%. The total fertility rate is 1.35 against the EU average of 1.53. Life expectancy at birth is 83. Due to the high percentage of senior citizens, the crude mortality rate (12%) is well in excess of the crude birth rate (8%).

Portugal boasts one of the world&#x27;s lowest infant mortality rates (3%), down from 9% in 1961. The average age of women at first childbirth was at 30 years, in contrast to the EU average of 28.

About 67% live in urban settings, concentrated along the coast and in the Lisbon metropolitan area, which hosts 2,883,645, or 28%.

About 65% of the national population, or 6,760,989 people, live in the 56 municipalities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, about 18% of all national municipalities. The country hosts 122 municipalities, about 40% of all national municipalities, with a population of 10,000 inhabitants or less, totaling 678,855 inhabitants, about 7% of the national population.

===Native minority languages===
The main language spoken as first language is Portuguese. Other autochthonous languages include:
* &quot;Caló&quot; (&quot;see also Caló language&quot;), the language of the Portuguese-Romani community. Some 52,000 Romani people live in Portugal.
* &quot;Mirandês&quot; (&quot;see also Mirandese language&quot;) is an officially recognised language. It enjoys special protection in the areas of Miranda do Douro, Vimioso, and Mogadouro. About 15,000 people speak the language (0.14%). The language is part of the Asturian-Leonese linguistic group which includes the Asturian and Leonese minority languages of Northwestern Spain. All of its speakers are bilingual and speak Portuguese: code-switching is common.
* &quot;Barranquenhu (see also Barranquenho)&quot; is spoken in the town of Barrancos (in the border between Extremadura and Andalusia, in Spain). Some 3,000 speak the language (0.03%). It is a Portuquese dialect influenced by Extremaduran and, later, southern Spanish.
* Minderico – a sociolect or argot spoken in Minde, which is practically extinct (150 remaining speakers).
* Portuguese Sign Language, the official language for the deaf community. About 30,000 deaf people (0.29%) use the language. The first teacher of deaf-mutes in France was Portuguese-Jew Jacob Rodrigues Pereira.

=== Ethnic minorities ===

People from Portugal&#x27;s former colonies, particularly Brazil, Portuguese Africa (especially Afro-Portuguese), Macau, Portuguese India and Timor-Leste, have been migrating to Portugal since the 1900s.

Many Slavs, especially Ukrainians (now one of the biggest ethnic minorities) and Russians, as well as Moldovans, Romanians, Bulgarians and Georgians, have been migrating to Portugal since the late 20th century. A wave of Ukrainians arrived in Portugal after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, approximately 60,000, making them the second largest migrant community after Brazilians.

A Chinese minority of Macau Cantonese origin as well as of Chinese mainlanders are present.

Other relevant Asian communities include Indians, Nepalis, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis while, dealing with Latin Americans, Venezuelans – numbering about 27,700 – are present.

A small minority of Romani live–about 52,000.

Portugal is home to other EU and EEA/EFTA nationals (French, Germans, Dutch, Swedes, Spaniards). The UK and France represented the largest senior resident communities as of 2019. They are part of a larger expatriate community including Germans, Dutch, Belgians and Swedes.

Officially registered foreigners amount to 7% of the population. Descendants of immigrants are excluded (Portugal, like many European countries, does not collect data on ethnicity) and those who, regardless of place of birth or citizenship at birth, were Portuguese citizens.

Some 100,000 Muslims and 5,000–6,000 Jews (mostly Sephardi such as the Belmonte Jews, and Ashkenazi).&lt;gallery widths=&quot;140&quot; heights=&quot;230&quot; caption=&quot;Flag maps for each Portuguese district as of January 2022&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;&gt;

== Surnames ==

A Portuguese surname is typically composed of a variable number of family names (rarely one, often two or three or more). The first additional names are usually the mother&#x27;s surname(s) and the father&#x27;s family surname(s). For practicality, usually only the final surname (excluding prepositions) is used in greetings.

Portugal&#x27;s adaptable naming system complies with the country&#x27;s legal framework. The law mandates that a child must be given at least one personal name and one surname from a parent. The limit is two personal names and four surnames.

In pre-Roman times, inhabitants had either a single name or a name followed by a patronym, which reflected their ethnicity or their tribe/region. These names could be Celtic, Lusitanian, Iberian, or Conii. However, the Roman onomastic system began to slowly gain popularity after the first century AD. This system involved adopting a Roman name (&quot;tria nomina&quot;), which consisted of a &quot;praenomen&quot; (given name), &quot;nomen&quot; (gentile), and &quot;cognomen&quot;. Today, most Portuguese surnames have a Germanic patronymic (such as Henriques, Pires, Rodrigues, Lopes, Nunes, Mendes, Fernandes etc. where the ending -es means &quot;son of&quot;), locative (Gouveia, Guimarães, Lima, Maia, Mascarenhas, Serpa, Montes, Fonseca, Barroso), religious origin (Cruz, Reis, De Jesus, Moysés, Nascimento), occupational (Carpinteiro (carpenter), Malheiro (wool-maker, thresher), Jardineiro (gardener), or derived from physical appearance (Branco (white), Trigueiro (brown, tanned), Louraço (blond). Toponymic, locative, and religion-derived surnames are often preceded by the preposition &#x27;of&#x27; in its varying forms: (&quot;De, de&quot;), (&quot;Do, do&quot;- masculine), (&quot;Da, da&quot;- feminine) or &#x27;of the&#x27; (&quot;dos, Dos, das, Das&quot; – plural) such as &quot;De Carvalho&quot;, &quot;Da Silva&quot;, &quot;de Gouveia&quot;, &quot;Da Costa&quot;, &quot;da Maia&quot;, &quot;do Nascimento&quot;, &quot;dos Santos&quot;, &quot;das Mercês&quot;. If the preposition is followed by a vowel, sometimes apostrophes are used in surnames (or stage names) such as D&#x27;Oliveira, d&#x27;Abranches, d&#x27;Eça. In some previous Asian colonies (India, Malaysia, East Timor) alternative spellings are used such as &#x27;D&#x27;Souza, Desouza, De Cunha, Ferrao, Dessais, Balsemao, Conceicao, Gurjao, Mathias, Thomaz.

The majority of Portuguese have multiple surnames.

Note: Percentages total &gt; 100 because of individuals with multiple surnames.

== Diaspora ==

Portugal was traditionally a land of emigration: according to estimates, more than one hundred million people could have recognizable Portuguese ancestors, with Portuguese diasporas found in diverse regions in all continents. However, poor sources for statistics dating hundreds of years ago complicate any estimates.

Explorations in the 15th and 16th centuries and colonial expansion encouraged worldwide emigration to South Asia, the Americas, Macau, East-Timor, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar and Africa, particularly to former colonies (&quot;see Luso-Africans&quot;). Portuguese emigration contributed to the settlement of the Atlantic islands, Brazil (where the majority of the population is of Portuguese descent), Goa Catholic Goans, Portuguese Burghers in Sri Lanka, in Malacca the Kristang and in Macau the Macaense. The Portuguese Empire, which lasted nearly 600 years, ended when Macau returned to China in 1999. During the period, millions left Portugal. Inter-ethnic marriage and cultural influences, produced dialects based on Portuguese in the former colonies (e.g. Forro) and in other countries (e.g. Papiamentu).

In addition, a considerable segment of the diaspora is due to recent mass emigration, mainly for economic reasons. Between 1886 and 1966 Portugal had more emigrants than any Western European country save Ireland. Nearly two million left to live mainly in Brazil, but also significant numbers settled in the US, Canada, and the Caribbean. About 1.2 million Brazilian citizens are native Portuguese.

By 1989 some 4,000,000 Portuguese citizens were living abroad, mainly in France, Germany, Brazil, South Africa, Canada, Venezuela, and the US. Estimates from 2021 are that as much as 5 million Portuguese citizens (not descendants or citizens registered within the Portuguese consular authorities) may be living abroad.

Within Europe, many Portuguese live in Francophone countries like France, Luxembourg and Switzerland, spurred in part by the linguistic proximity of Portuguese and French. In fact, according to data from the General Directorate of Consular Affairs and Portuguese Communities of the Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the countries with the largest Portuguese communities are, in ascending order, France, the UK and Switzerland.

=== Sephardi Jews ===
Descendants of Portuguese Sephardi Jews established many communities around the world, including in significant numbers in Israel, the Netherlands, the United States, France, Venezuela, Brazil and Turkey.

====Expulsion====

The Portuguese Jewish diaspora was mainly a result of the expulsion decree issued in 1496 by the Portuguese monarchy, which targeted Portuguese-Jews. This decree forced many Jews to either convert to Christianity (leading to the emergence of &quot;Cristão-novos&quot; and of &quot;Crypto-Judaism&quot; practices) or to leave, leading Portuguese Jews to settle throughout Europe and Brazil. In Brazil many of the early colonists were originally Sephardi Jews who, following their conversion, were known as New Christians &quot;(see Anusim)&quot;.

==== Emigration ====
Up to 10,000 Portuguese-Jews might have migrated to France from 1497; this phenomenon remained noticeable until the 1600s, when the Netherlands became a favorite choice.

The Netherlands and England became top destinations for these emigrants because those places had no Inquisition. Adding to the economical and cultural aspects of their host countries, Portuguese-Jews established institutions that continue, such as the Esnoga, in Amsterdam, Congregation Shearith Israel (America&#x27;s oldest Jewish congregation), Bevis Marks Synagogue (the UK&#x27;s oldest synagogue) – the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue of Montreal – (Canada&#x27;s oldest synagogue) – , Mount Sinai Hospital, City Lights Booksellers, and David Cardozo Academy in Jerusalem.

Smaller communities thrived in the Balkans, Italy, the Ottoman Empire and Germany, especially in Hamburg (&quot;see Elijah Aboab Cardoso Joan d&#x27;Acosta and Samuel ben Abraham Aboab&quot;).

Portuguese-Jews were responsible for the appearance of Papiamentu (a 300,000 strong Portuguese-based creole now the official language in Aruba, Curaçao and Bonaire) and of Sranan Tongo, a Portuguese-influenced, English-based creole by spoken by more than 500,000 in Suriname.

==== Shoah ====
During the Shoah, nearly 4,000 Jews of Portuguese descent residing in the Netherlands lost their lives, making up the largest group of casualties with a Portuguese background. Among famous Portuguese-Jewish victims of the Shoah is painter Baruch Lopes Leão de Laguna. Although officially neutral, the Portuguese regime at that time, Estado Novo, aligned with Germany&#x27;s ideology and failed to protect its citizens and other Jewish people living overseas. Despite the lack of support by the Portuguese authorities, Jews of both Portuguese and other descent were saved thanks to individuals such as Carlos Sampaio Garrido, Joaquim Carreira, José Brito Mendes and Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who alone helped 34,000 Jews

==== Twenty-first century ====
Over 500 years after the expulsion decree, in 2015 the Portuguese parliament officially acknowledged that the expulsion of its citizens of Jewish descent was wrong. The government then passed a Law of Return that aimed to address the wrongs of the Portuguese Inquisition. The law grants citizenship to any descendants of those persecuted Jews able to confirm their Sephardic Jewish ancestry and a &quot;connection&quot; to Portugal.

Thereafter, more than 140,000 people of Sephardic descent, from 60 countries (mostly Israel and Turkey) applied for Portuguese citizenship. Thereafter, foreigners with no legitimate links were granted Portuguese and thus EU citizenship, including Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich. Such abuse prompted the judiciary to review the law.

Notable people of Portuguese-Jewish descent include:
* Amatus Lusitanus (1511–1568): Jewish physician said to have discovered the valves in the azygos vein.
* Gracia Mendes Nasi (1510–1569): Philanthropist and one of the wealthiest Jewish women of Renaissance Europe
* Leonora Duarte (1610–1678): a Flemish composer and musician
* Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677): Dutch philosopher of Portuguese-Jewish origin
* Catherine da Costa (1679–1756): English miniaturist
* David Ricardo (1772–1823): a British political economist
* Rehuel Lobatto (1797–1866): Dutch mathematician whose notable contributions include Gauss-Lobatto quadrature method and the Lobatto polynomials
* Isaäc da Costa (1798–1860): a Jewish poet.
* Pereire brothers (19th century): major figures in the development of France&#x27;s finance and infrastructure
* Samuel Sarphati (1813–1866): Dutch physician and Amsterdam city planner
* Solomon Nunes Carvalho (1815–1897): American painter, photographer, author and inventor
* Grace Aguilar (1816–1847): English novelist, poet and writer on Jewish history and religion
* Camille Pissarro (1830–1903): a Danish-French Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painter considered the &quot;dean of the Impressionist painters&quot;
* Francis Lewis Cardozo (1836–1903): American clergyman, politician, and educator. When elected in South Carolina as Secretary of State in 1868, he was the first African American to hold a statewide office in the United States
* Maud Nathan (1862–1946): American social worker, labor activist and women&#x27;s suffragist
* Federigo Enriques (1871–1946): Italian mathematician, now known principally as the first to give a classification of algebraic surfaces in birational geometry, and other contributions in algebraic geometry
* Frieda Belinfante (1904–1995): Dutch cellist, philharmonic conductor, a prominent lesbian, and a member of the Dutch resistance during World War II
* William Leonard Pereira (1909–1985): American architect
* Abraham Pais (1918–2000): Dutch-American physicist and science historian
* Louisa Benson Craig (1941–2010): Burmese-born two-time beauty pageant winner and Karen rebel leader of Portuguese-Jewish descent
* Alberto Portugheis (1941): Argentine pianist
* Henrique Cymerman (1959): Israeli journalist
* Shon Weissman (1996): Israeli footballer

=== Americas outside of Brazil ===

==== United States ====
The US established bilateral relations with Portugal when Portugal became the first neutral country to acknowledge the United States.

Despite Portugal never attempting to colonize any territory that became part of the US, navigators such as João Fernandes Lavrador, Miguel Corte-Real and João Rodrigues Cabrilho are among its earliest documented European explorers. Dighton Rock, in Southeastern Massachusetts, is a marker of early Portuguese presence.

Mathias de Sousa, who was potentially a Sephardic Jew of mixed African background, is believed to be the first documented Portuguese resident of colonial United States. Another Portuguese Jew, Isaac Touro, is commemorated in the name of the US&#x27; oldest synagogue, the Touro Synagogue.

Portuguese started to settle in significant numbers only in the 19th century, with major migration waves occurring in the first half of the 20th century, especially from the Azores. Of the 1,4 million Portuguese Americans found in the US (0.4% of its population) the majority are originally from the Azores. The arrival of Azorean emigrants was easier because of geographic proximity and was encouraged by the Azorean Refugee Act of 1958, sponsored by then-Senator John F. Kennedy and John Pastore to help the population affected by the 1957–58, the Capelinhos volcano eruption. Moreover, the 1965 Immigration Act stated that if someone had legal or American relatives in the US who would serve as a sponsor, they could obtain the status of legal aliens. This act dramatically increased Portuguese immigration in the 1970s and 1980s.

Major Portuguese communities arose in New Jersey (particularly in Newark), the New England states, California and along the Gulf Coast (Louisiana). Springfield, Illinois once hosted the largest Portuguese community in the Midwest. In the Pacific, Hawaii (&quot;see Portuguese immigration to Hawaii&quot;) sports a sizable Portuguese population, encouraged by the availability of labor contracts 150 years ago. Elements of Hawaiian cuisine, such as malasadas, originate from Portuguese immigrants to Hawaii.

==== Canada ====
Canada, particularly Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, developed a significant Portuguese community since the 1940s. The availability of more job opportunities in Canada attracted Portuguese migrants, leading to Portuguese culture to flourish. Many Portuguese residents took the initiative to purchase homes and establish businesses.

According to the 2016 Census, 482,610, or 1.4% of Canadians claimed Portuguese ancestry.

Two major neighbourhoods where Portuguese are notable include the Little Portugals in Toronto and Montréal. Montréal&#x27;s Little Portugal, known as &quot;&quot;Petit Portugal&quot; in French, hosts Portuguese shops, restaurants, and cafes, and is also home to &quot;Parc du Portugal&quot;&quot; (Portugal&#x27;s park), featuring vibrant murals and elements inspired by Portuguese design.

The Portuguese language is spoken by over 330,000 Canadians, making up around 1% of the population.

Significant testimonies of the Portuguese presence in Canada include the name of one of the 10 provinces of Canada: Newfoundland and Labrador. King Henry VII coined the name &quot;New found land&quot; for the territory explored by Sebastian and John Cabot. In Portuguese, the land is known as &quot;Terra Nova&quot;, which translates to &quot;new land,&quot; and is also referred to as &quot;Terre-Neuve&quot; in French, the name for the province&#x27;s island region. The name Terra Nova is commonly used on the island, including in the name of Terra Nova National Park. The influence of early Portuguese exploration is also evident in the name of Labrador, which is derived from the surname of Portuguese navigator João Fernandes Lavrador. Other remnants of early Portuguese exploration include toponyms such as Baccalieu (from &quot;bacalhau&quot;, Portuguese for codfish) and Portugal Cove. Portuguese cartographer Diogo Ribeiro is responsible for one of the earliest maps depicting the territory of modern-day Canada.

==== Caribbean ====
The first Portuguese who settled in the Caribbean were merchants or Portuguese-Jews fleeing the Portuguese Inquisition. Migrants from the 1830s came as indentured labourers, especially from Madeira. The 19th century migration coincided with the abolition of slavery in the British colonies. As a result, the Portuguese, along with Indians and Chinese, arrived to replace the slave labor. The Portuguese took a prominent part in shaping the population of the West Indies. Their descendants form an active minority in many countries.

As part of a larger system of low-wage labour, about 2,500 Portuguese left for Antigua and Barbuda (where, more than 1,000 people still speak the language), 30,000 to Guyana (4.3% of the population in 1891) and another 2,000 settled in Trinidad and Tobago between the mid-1800s and the mid-1900s. Portuguese culture survives in the enterprises established by community members. In 2016 the second international airport of the country was renamed after a Portuguese Guyanese individual.

Portuguese fishermen, farmers and indentured labourers inhabited other Caribbean countries, especially Jamaica (about 5,700 people, primarily of Portuguese-Jewish descent), St. Vincent and the Grenadines (0.7% of the population), and Suriname, whose first capital, Torarica (literally &quot;rich Torah&quot; in Portuguese), was established by Portuguese-Jewish settlers. Minor communities exist in Grenada, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Cayman Islands

About 4,000 Portuguese people live in the Caribbean territories of Overseas France, especially in Saint Barthélemy (where they constitute about a third of the population), Guadeloupe and Martinique.

Portuguese heritage lives on in Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao. In the three territories, the official language, Papiamentu, includes numerous Portuguese elements.

The North Atlantic archipelago of Bermuda (10% to 25% of the population) experienced sustained immigration especially from the Azores, as well as from Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands since the 1840s.

Portuguese communities are also present in countries such as Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. Notable members of the community include activist Ada Bello, businesswoman Alexis Victoria Yeb, former Nicaraguan First Lady Lila Teresita Abaunza and Felipa Colón de Toledo.

==== Latin America (excluding Brazil) ====

Mexico had flows of Portuguese immigration from the colonial period through the early 20th century, most importantly in northeastern cities such as Saltillo, Monterrey, Durango and Torreon. Santiago Tequixquiac, due to its lime and stone mining deposits, was a place of settlement for Portuguese Crypto-Jews during the colonial period. They were brought there together with the Tlaxcalans and peninsular Spaniards to appease the Otomi indigenous people in that town. Many Lusitanian cultural traits were preserved through the 19th century, such as forcados, gastronomy, some Sephardic customs and its inhabitants&#x27; surnames. Bullfighting is a Portuguese tradition that continues in Mexico. A notable Portuguese-Mexican Jew was Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal, executed by burning at the stake by the Inquisition for judaizing in 1596.

Venezuela has the most Portuguese people in Latin America after Brazil. Portuguese started arriving to Venezuela in the early and middle 20th century as economic immigrants, particularly from Madeira. Some 1.3 million people (4.61%) are of Portuguese descent. Migration occurred mainly in the 1940s and 1950s. The extensive Luso-Venezuelan community includes personalities such as María Gabriela de Faría, Marjorie de Sousa, Vanessa Gonçalves, Kimberly Dos Ramos and Laura Gonçalves.

Colombia did not welcome mass Portuguese immigration. Although Portuguese may have explored the area, they did not establish communities there. Colombia became a Spanish colony, as defined by the Treaty of Tordesillas. The Portuguese embassy in Bogota estimated that around 800 Portuguese nationals live there. The number with Portuguese ancestry is not known, but they left little mark on the culture, except for some surnames.

In Peru, a modest migration began at the time of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Sailors who traveled along the Peruvian coast, and later entered the country from the Atlantic via the Amazon River settled there. Records of Luso-Brazilians survive in the cities surrounding the Brazil-Peru border. Portuguese citizens in Peru number about 2,000, Peruvians with Portuguese ancestry could approach 1 million, including direct and indirect descendants, or about 3% of the total. A famous Peruvian of Portuguese descent is popular TV presenter .

The Cono Sur region had Portuguese immigration beginning in the early 20th century. The Portuguese and Cape Verdean community in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile numbers around 255,000 people combined (0.37% of the region&#x27;s population).

Portuguese Uruguayans are mainly of Azorean descent. Portuguese presence in the country dates to colonial times, in particular to the establishment of Colonia del Sacramento by the Portuguese in 1680, which eventually turned into a regional smuggling center. Other Portuguese entered Uruguay from Brazil. During the second half of the 19th century and part of the 20th, several additional Portuguese immigrants arrived; the last wave came during 1930–1965. As of 2021, 3,069 Portuguese citizens had registered as residing in Uruguay. Many luso-descendants also reside there, but numbers are lacking.

Argentina-Portugal relations date back to the early explorers, as the Río de la Plata (literally, silver river) was first explored by the Portuguese in the 1510s. In Argentina, Portuguese immigration remained limited due to a preference for Brazil. However, the Portuguese constituted the second-largest immigrant group after the Spanish before 1816 and continued to arrive throughout the 19th century. While a significant number settled in the interior, the primary destination was Buenos Aires. Many men from Lisbon, Porto, and coastal regions of Portugal, predominantly in maritime professions, were already present. During the 1970s, they began to organize ethnically, and community life developed. A popular member of the Portuguese community in Argentina was best-selling author Silvina Bullrich.

=== Africa ===
In the early twentieth century the Portuguese government encouraged migration to Angola and Mozambique, and by the 1970s, up to 1 million Portuguese settlers were living in Portugal&#x27;s overseas African provinces. Minor communities settled in Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe, Portuguese influences continue there: Portuguese enjoys the status of official language.

Following the Carnation Revolution, as the country&#x27;s African possessions gained independence in 1975, an estimated 800,000 Portuguese emigrated from the former colonies. Returnees to Portugal are often referred as &quot;Retornados&quot; (literally, those who came back).

Some Portuguese moved to South Africa, Botswana, and Algeria. In particular, South Africa hosts the largest Portuguese community in the continent, numbering about 700,000 (more than Lisbon).

Portuguese descendants make up a significant minority in the former colonies where, they make up the bulk of &quot;Mestiços&quot; (Mixed African-European people).

=== Europe outside of Portugal ===

==== France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, Andorra and Switzerland ====


Due to the linguistic similarity between Portuguese and French and the many schools in Portugal that promote French as foreign language, many Portuguese nationals started migrating to France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco and the French-speaking part of Switzerland in the 1960s, for economic reasons, and to avoid conscription to fight in Portuguese colonies. Interestingly, migration to Andorra - where, although Catalan is the official language, French is widely spoken - made the Portuguese the third largest ethnic group in the state, after Andorrans and Spaniards.

Around 15% of Portuguese people are fluent in French. French has been dwindling, often replaced by English. In 2005 French fluency stood at 24%. Nevertheless, 70% of middle school students study French. French media are widely available in Portugal (newspapers, magazines, radio stations and TV channels) and many libraries offer a French-language section.

Portuguese migration to the more affluent French speaking countries in Europe continues, although at a lower rate.

More than 2,260,000 Portuguese citizens live in these countries. In addition, France alone hosts 450,000 Luso-descendants&quot;.&quot;

Records of Portuguese living in France date to the early centuries of the Portuguese kingdom, notably merchants, Portuguese-Jews and Portuguese nobles: Louis XIV was of Portuguese descent through his grandfather Philip II. Despite a centuries-long presence, Portuguese nationals only started to move to France in large numbers following World War 2.

From the 1960s, Brazil&#x27;s economic stagnation, French efforts to attract Portuguese workers, and António de Oliveira Salazar&#x27;s dictatorship and the colonial wars were factors that contributed to 1,000,000 people migrating to France from 1960 to 1974. After 1974, Portuguese nationals started moving to Luxembourg and Monaco (1980s), Switzerland (1990s) and – Belgium and Andorra (2000s). This is also due to France&#x27;s tightened immigration control.

Portuguese constitute 23.4% of Luxembourg&#x27;s population, second to native Luxembourgers&quot;.&quot; Andorra is inhabited by 16,300 Portuguese nationals (19.4% of the population)&quot;,&quot; Monaco hosts around 1,000 (3.3% of the Population), while Belgium is home to around 80,000 (0.7% of the population).

In Switzerland, Portuguese settled mainly in Romandy. Official figures suggest that Portuguese is spoken by 5% of the population at home and 10.1% in French speaking Switzerland, thus making Portuguese second only to French.

Notable Portuguese Swiss include snooker player Alexander Ursenbacher, models Pedro Mendes and Nomi Fernandes, actress Yaël Boon and Olympic medalist Stéphane Lambiel.

Notable Portuguese Belgians include – nobles such as Queen Elizabeth or King Leopold III, fashion designer Veronique Branquinho, footballer Yannick Carrasco, actress Rose Bertram, sprinter Jonathan Sacoor, and actress Helena Noguerra.

Portuguese migration towards these countries has steadily declined over the years, although from 2003 to 2022 around 615,000 Portuguese nationals migrated there, especially following the 2008 financial crisis. As of 2021 around 40% had returned to Portugal, as the economic outlook improved.
==== Germany ====
After WWII hundreds of thousands of Portuguese settled as guest workers in Western European countries. On 17 March 1964, the recruitment agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and Portugal was signed under the Erhard I cabinet. Armando Rodrigues de Sá was officially welcomed in 1964 as the millionth &quot;guest worker&quot; in Germany and was given a certificate and a two-seater Zündapp Sport Combinette – Mokick. The number of Portuguese citizens living in Germany was estimated at 245,000 as of 2021. The largest Portuguese community is located in Hamburg numbering about 25,000. A &quot;Portugiesenviertel&quot; (Portuguese quarter) in Hamburg sits near the Port of Hamburg and between the subway stations of Landungsbrücken and Baumwall.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, people of Portuguese origin were estimated at 400,000 in 2021. Other sources claim as many as 500,000 Portuguese there, considerably higher than the estimated 170,000 Portuguese-born people residing in the country in 2021 (excluding British-born people of Portuguese descent).

In areas such as Thetford and the crown dependencies of Jersey and Guernsey, Portuguese form the largest ethnic minority groups at 30%.

London is home to the largest group of Portuguese in the UK, with the majority settling in the Western boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth and Westminster.

===Brazil===

==== Colonial period ====

Portuguese are the largest European immigrant group in Brazil. In colonial times, over 700,000 Portuguese settled there, mostly during the 18th century gold rush. Brazil received more European settlers during its colonial era than any other country in the Americas. Between 1500 and 1760, about 700,000 Europeans immigrated to Brazil, compared to 530,000 to the US. They were the only significant migrants to the country during the colonial era, despite French and Dutch invasions. The Portuguese migration was predominantly men. The Jesuits asked the Portuguese King to send any kind of Portuguese women to Brazil, even the socially undesirable (e.g. prostitutes or women with mental maladies), if necessary. The Crown responded by sending groups of orphans to marry nobles and peasants alike.

They included many &quot;Órfãs do Rei&quot; (orphans of the king) of what was considered &quot;good birth&quot;. They were noble and non-noble maidens, often daughters of soldiers killed in battle or noblemen who died overseas and whose upbringing was paid by the Crown. Bahia&#x27;s port in the East received one of the first groups of orphans in 1551. Portuguese men also competed successfully for local women with slaves and indigenous peoples. Their better quality of life and lower mortality rate were important advantages. Then, even though the 700,000 Portuguese colonial migration was smaller than 3.2 million indigenous inhabitants and the 4.8million Africans, their descendants numbered as many as the &quot;non-white&quot; population in the early 19th century. After independence from Portugal in 1822, around 1.7 million additional Portuguese immigrants settled there.

==== Post-independence ====
Portuguese immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries was marked by its concentration in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The immigrants opted mostly for urban centers. Portuguese women began to migrate independently, although even at the turn of the 20th century, 319 men came each 100 women. The Portuguese were different from Germans or Italians who brought many more women with them. Despite the small female proportion, Portuguese men typically chose Portuguese women, while female immigrants rarely married indigenous men. Portuguese endogamy was higher than any other European immigrant community, behind only the Japanese.

Many Portuguese-Brazilians identified as Brazilian, perhaps encouraged by the dominance of Portuguese culture there.

In 1872, 3.7 million Whites lived in Brazil (the vast majority of Portuguese ancestry), along with 4.1 million mixed-race people (mostly of Portuguese-African-Amerindian ancestry) and 1.9 million Blacks. Thus 80% of Brazilians had at least partial Portuguese ancestry in the 1870s.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a new large wave of Portuguese immigrants arrived, including over 1.5 million Portuguese from 1881 to 1991. In 1906, for example, 133,393 Portuguese-born people lived in Rio de Janeiro, comprising 16% of the city&#x27;s population. Rio remains the largest &quot;Portuguese city&quot; outside of Portugal, with 1% Portuguese natives.

==== Genetic evidence ====
Genetic studies confirm the strong Portuguese genetic influence. At least half of the Brazilian population&#x27;s male inheritance (based on Y chromosomes) comes from Portugal. Black Brazilians have an average of 48% non-African genes, mostly with Portuguese ancestors. By contrast, 33% Amerindian and 28% African contribution to the total female inheritance (mtDNA) of white Brazilians was found.

An autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from across Brazil, found a predominant degree of Portuguese ancestry. European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values from 51% to 74%, increasing northern to southern Brazil). Northern populations included a significant proportion of indigenous ancestry, twice the African contribution. In the northeast, centerwest and southeast, African ancestry exceeded them. All urban populations were highly admixed, and most of the variation was observed between individuals within each population.

A large, community-based multicenter autosomal study considered representative samples from three urban communities Salvador, Bambuí, and Pelotas, estimated European, mostly Iberian, ancestry to be 42.4%, 83.8% and 85.3%, respectively.

An estimated 5 million Brazilians (2.3% of the total) were eligible for Portuguese citizenship.

=== Oceania ===
==== Australia ====

In Australia, although their numbers are smaller than the Greek and Italian communities, Portuguese are an active community. They were among the early European settlers, and might have discovered Australia. Portuguese immigration to Australia experienced a boom after the Carnation Revolution and the Indonesian Invasion of Timor-Leste. Portuguese spread across the country and even have a designated Portuguese neighborhood. The 74,000 people of Portuguese descent constitute about 0.28% of the population. Portuguese cuisine is popular, exemplified by restaurants such as Nando&#x27;s, Oporto, and Ogalo. &quot;Pastel de nata&quot; is widely consumed. Many Portuguese are from Madeira. Notable Portuguese Australians include Naomi Sequeira, Kate DeAraugo, Junie Morosi, Lyndsey Rodrigues, Sophie Masson and Irina Dunn.

==== New Zealand ====
The community in New Zealand is much smaller and the 1,500 Portuguese people living there (although the numbers could be significantly higher) constitute about 0.03% of the population. On 22 April 2010, the Office of Ethnic Affairs officially recognized Portuguese New Zealanders as a distinct community, marked by tying the 70th ribbon to Parliament&#x27;s mooring stone in the Parliament House Galleria. The Portuguese community organizes annual gatherings and celebrations, such as Portugal Day, and maintains a friendship association. Portuguese individuals were among the early settlers in New Zealand, although immigration declined gradually until the 1960s. After the Carnation Revolution, the community started to increase again.

==== New Caledonia ====
About 900 Portuguese live in the French collectivity of New Caledonia (0.38% of the population).

=== Asia ===

Portuguese influences are found throughout Asia, especially in Macau, Timor-Leste and India&quot;,&quot; all territories where the Portuguese maintained colonies.

==== Southeast Asia ====

Luso-Asian communities have had a presence in Southeast Asia since the 15th century. As a result of inter-ethnic marriage, Portuguese-based dialects have emerged in Malaysia and Singapore. Notable Kristangs include Kimberley Leggett, , Joan Margaret Marbeck, , , Melissa Tan, Andrea Fonseka, and . People of Portuguese descent from Singapore include Pilar Arlando, Mary Klass and Vernetta Lopez.

Other communities are found in Indonesia, with significant populations living in Lamno (the so-called &quot;mata biru&quot; or blue-eyed people), Aceh, Maluku Islands and Kampung Tugu. Portuguese vestiges include dozens of loanwords as well as the introduction of Roman Catholicism (3.12% of the population, but still the major religion in NTT) and &quot;Keroncong&quot;, similar to &quot;Portuguese cavaquinho.&quot; In recent years many Indonesians of Portuguese descent have been active in the entertainment industry such as Puteri Indonesia Elfin Pertiwi Rappa or actress . In the Philippines, actress Sophie Albert is another Portuguese-South Asian.

Communities of Portuguese descent are found in Myanmar and Thailand. In Thailand, during the reign of King Narai the Great the Portuguese community in Ayutthaya is thought to have peaked at 6,000 people. Notable Thai of Portuguese descent include Francis Chit, Maria Guyomar de Pinha, , Krystal Vee, and .

==== Indian Subcontinent ====
Sri Lanka is home to around 40,000 Portuguese Burghers. A notable example is Rosemary Rogers. In addition, as a consequence of the Portuguese invasion of Sri Lanka, during the 16th and 17th centuries, many Portuguese language surnames were adopted among the Sinhalese. As a result, Perera and Fernando eventually became the most common surnames. Afro Sri-Lankans also retain a Portuguese identity. Major Portuguese contributions to Sri Lanka include 1,000 loanwords in Sinhala, Baila music (from the Portuguese &quot;bailar&quot;, meaning &quot;to dance&quot;), culinary innovations such as &quot;&quot;Bolo di amor&quot;&quot; (literally Love cake) or &quot;Bolo Folhado&quot; (literally Puff Pastry) as well as Roman Catholicism (approximately 6.1% of the population identifies as Catholic) and the endangered Sri Lankan Portuguese creole.

In Pakistan a small Portuguese community numbers about 64 people, even though other estimates point to 400 in Karachi. Notable Portuguese Pakistani include Dilshad Vadsaria and Bernadette Louise Dean. Before partition, it is estimated that the Goan community in Karachi numbered up to 15,000. The majority returned to Goa, to other Portuguese territories, or to the UK. The Portuguese community contributed to the musical scene of pre-partition Karachi. As of today, about 6,000 Goans remain in Pakistan, mainly in that city.

Portuguese heritage continues in Bangladesh: they were the first Europeans. The Portuguese introduced Catholicism, now professed by about 375,000 Bangladeshis. This heritage added more than 1,500 words to Bengali. In colonial times, the population may have reached 40,000 people before most resettled elsewhere. Those who remained integrated in Bangladeshi society. Notable examples of Portuguese influence in Bangladesh are their surnames, as well as Bangladesh&#x27;s oldest church, the Holy Rosary Church in Dhaka. As of now, the Portuguese community in Bangladesh consists of a few expatriates and some descendants of the early settlers.

==== East Asia ====

A small but growing Portuguese community – consisting mainly of recent expats and numbering about 3,500 people – is found in Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan, whose name in European texts until the 20th century – &quot;Formosa&quot;, meaning &quot;beautiful (island)&quot; – is Portuguese.

== Governance ==

Portuguese politics is defined within the framework of a parliamentary, representative multy-party democratic republic, where the Prime Minister is the head of government.

The President is the head of the country and has significant political power. He is elected for a 5-year term by direct vote, and he is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. His powers include the election of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, in accordance with general elections results. The Council of State is a presidential oversight body, composed of six senior civilian officers, any former president elected since 1976, five members elected by the Assembly, and five directly appointed by the President.

Executive power is assigned to the Council of Ministers. Both the Government and the Portuguese Parliament (&quot;Assembleia da República&quot;) are equipped with legislative rights. The Assembly is elected by universal suffrage via proportional representation. Deputies serve a four-year term. Given extreme unrest or of inability to form a government, the President can dissolve the Assembly and call for new elections.

Since 1976, the Socialist Party (PS) and Social Democratic Party (PSD) have dominated the political landscape.

The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative branches and the national Supreme Court is the court of last appeal. Military, administrative and fiscal courts are independent systemsce. A nine-member Constitutional Court verifies the constitutionality of legislation.

== Education ==

Education has been gradually modernized and expanded since the 1970s. According to the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2015, 15-year-old students were significantly above the OECD average for reading skills, mathematics and science. Portugal has recognized universities and business schools that have contributed international leaders and which attract an increasing number of foreign students. Portugal is among the top senders and receivers country within the Erasmus+ programme, with more student entering than leaving.

== Economy ==

Portugal&#x27;s economy ranked 34th on the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Global Competitiveness Report in 2019.

The majority of its trade is with the EU, the source and destination of more than 70% of the 2020 total. International trade amounted to approximately 153.3 billion Euros in 2022.

== Cuisine ==

The oldest cookbook on Portuguese cooking is from the 16th century, &quot;Livro de Cozinha da Infanta D. Maria de Portugal&quot; (Crown-Princess Maria&#x27;s cookbook). It describes recipes made of beef, fish, fowl, and other traditional ingredients. Even in the High Middle Ages, agriculture had already a regional character. Small peasant allotments and large latifundia were cultivated. The latter are particularly characteristic of southern regions, which were annexed as a result of the Reconquista and distributed among feudal lords, whereas further north, agricultural lots were typically smaller.

In modern times, fruit and grapes began to play an important role. Portugal is a world leader in fortified red and dry white wines. Port wine and Madeira wine come from there. Portuguese farmers grow pears, apples, plums, cherries, olives, citrus fruits and grain crops such as wheat, rye, corn, oats, and vegetables such as legumes.

Portuguese cuisine relies on meats (pork, cattle, chicken and game among others).

High seafood (fish, crustaceans including lobster, crab, shrimp, prawns, and octopus) consumption is supported by rich fisheries along Portugal&#x27;s 1,800 km of coastline (1,115 miles). This is balanced by vegetables, legumes, and sweets (notably, cakes). The diet is rich in carbohydrates that often includes fresh breads like &quot;broa&quot;, rice, and potatoes. The Portuguese lead the Europeans in rice consumption per capita, 16.1 kg per year. Rice specialities include, &quot;Arroz de Tamboril&quot; (Monkfish rice), &quot;Arroz de Pato&quot; (duck rice) and &quot;Arroz de Cabidela&quot; (rooster rice) enjoy high popularity. Portuguese are among the largest European potato consumers, consuming 62 kg potatoes per capita per year. Portugal has one of the largest livestock EU populations.

António-Maria De Oliveira Bello, also known as Olleboma, wrote &quot;Culinária Portuguesa&quot; (Portuguese Cuisine) in 1936. Portuguese cuisine also draws from Mediterranean sources – Portugal is among the countries recognised by UNESCO for its Mediterranean diet – and from all over the world, especially from the onetime Portuguese Empire.

Portugal&#x27;s role in the spice trade influenced its cuisine, particularly in the broad variety of spices used. These spices include &quot;piri piri&quot; (tiny, spicy chili peppers), white and black pepper, saffron, paprika, clove, allspice, cumin, and nutmeg.

Many dishes contain cinnamon, vanilla, lemon, orange, anise, clove, and allspice. Portuguese merchants introduced oranges in Middle Eastern countries. Today the Turkish (&quot;Portakal&quot;), Farsi (نارنجی or &quot;portaqal&quot;) and Arabic (البرتقالي or &quot;lburtuqaliiu&quot;) words for orange all reflect a Portuguese origin. This term extended to the Ottoman Empire and beyond, today appearing in languages such as Romanian (portocale), Albanian (portokalli), Greek (πορτοκάλι-portokáli) and Georgian (ფორთოხალი-portokhali).

One popular dish is &quot;Feijoada&quot;. &quot;Feijão&quot; is Portuguese for bean. With &quot;feijoada&quot; &quot;salada de tomate&quot; and &quot;vinagrete&quot; or &quot;molho vinagrete&quot; are sometimes served. The Portuguese have 365 ways of cooking cod (&quot;bacalhau&quot;). Other emblematic Portuguese traditional dishes are &quot;Cozido à portuguesa&quot; (Portuguese stew) and &quot;Caldo verde&quot; (green soup). The most globally appreciated pastry is &quot;pastel de nata&quot;, sometimes known as &quot;Natas&quot; or &quot;Portuguese custard tarts&quot;.

Portugal has 19 named wine regions &quot;Denominação de Origem Controlada&quot;: Alenquer, Arruda, Bairrada, Beira Interior, Bucelas, Carcavelos, Colares, Dão, Douro, Encostas d&#x27;Aire, Lagoa, Lagos, Óbidos, Palmela, Portimão, Setúbal, Tavira, Távora-Varosa, and Torres Vedras. The most famous Portuguese wine is&quot;Vinho do Porto&quot; (port), which is grown only in the &quot;região demarcada do Douro&quot;. Several unique types of Port wine are made, namely &quot;Porto Branco&quot;, &quot;Porto Ruby,&quot; and &quot;Porto Tawny&quot;. Also famous is the slightly sparkling &quot;Vinho Verde&quot; (green wine), from the Minho region.

Notable Portuguese chefs include , Louise Bourrat and .

== Architecture ==
Portuguese architecture encompasses work in Portugal and its former colonies, reflecting these diverse cultures. Romans and Moors each left marks. Epitomes of the Portuguese architectural style are Romanesque, Gothic and, above all, Manueline style. Baroque and Rococo were influential. After the 1755 Lisbon earthquake the Pombaline style (now candidate to become a listed UNESCO heritage site) took over and is still visible, especially in Estremadura (the region of the capital city, Lisbon). Other influences include Romanesque evolving into contemporary styles. The Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, built in the 1960s is one of defining examples of 20th-century Portuguese architecture.
19th century architects include Maria José Marques da Silva, Helena Roseta, Miguel Ventura Terra and José Marques da Silva. Modern architects include Pritzker Architecture Prize winners Eduardo Souto de Moura and Siza Vieira. Others include Raul Lino, Fernando Távora and Álvaro Siza Vieira. Tomás Taveira is noted particularly for stadium design. Other Portuguese architects include Diogo de Arruda (chapter house window at the Convent of Christ, in Tomar), Pedro Nunes Tinoco and Filippo Terzi (Monastery of São Vicente de Fora), André Soares (Falperra Church), José António Caldas (dark room pioneer in Brazil), Carlos Amarante (Bom Jesus do Monte), João Luís Carrilho da Graça, José da Costa e Silva (established Neoclassical architecture in Portugal and Brazil), José Luis Monteiro, João Abel Manta, Huguet and Mateus Fernandes (Monastery of Batalha)

Portuguese architects who made contributions abroad include Alfredo Azancot in Chile, Emanuele Rodriguez Dos Santos in Italy, and Jo Palma in Canada.

== Music ==
From folk music to classical, music has always played an important role in Portuguese culture. From traditional songs from the north of the country to the rhythms of Portuguese-influenced samba, from &quot;fado&quot; to Portuguese pop-rock, Portuguese music has delighted listeners all over the world.

Portuguese music dates back to the Middle Ages, when troubadours, poets and musicians sang love songs throughout the country.

The 16th century brought musical influences such as the stringed instrument, the Krencong, which traveled from Portugal to Indonesia and made a lasting contribution to Indonesian culture. Another instrument of Portuguese origin that gained acclaim in Hawaiian music is the ukulele, which originated on Madeira Island.

&quot;Fado&quot; is the leading modern genre. Originating in Lisbon in the 19th century, it symbolizes Portuguese culture. &quot;Fado&quot; songs often express love, &quot;saudade&quot; (longing) and difficulties in life. The great ambassador of Portuguese fado, Amália Rodrigues, had carried the music across the world during the 1950s and 1960s. Musicians such as Mariza, Ana Moura and Cristina Branco, Katia Guerreiro modernized and invigorated this musical art alive. The genre is one of two Portuguese music traditions in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists, along with &quot;Cante Alentejano&quot;.

Besides &quot;fado&quot;, the country produced other popular music, including Portuguese Pop Rock, developed in the 1980s and 1990s by artists such as Xutos &amp; Pontapés, Rui Veloso, and the Madredeus. The latter are noted for their innovative use of the traditional Portuguese guitar.

Other popular imported genres include dance, house, &quot;kizomba&quot;, &quot;pimba&quot;, pop, reggae, ska and &quot;zouk&quot;. World music stars include Waldemar Bastos. A notable Portuguese &quot;kizomba&quot; author is Soraia Ramos.

Ângelo César do Rosário Firmino and Diana De Brito are important rap artists. Hip hop arrived in the early 1990s. The first artist to sign a major record deal was General D. Other important artists from the Hip hop tuga genre include Sam the Kid and Regula.

In jazz, notable Portuguese performers include Carmen Souza, Marta Dias, Vânia Fernandes, Maria João and Luísa Sobral. while in the &quot;kuduro&quot; musical genre in Portugal Keidje Torres Lima is notable. Other authors are Lura, Georgina Ribas, Filipa Azevedo, Nenny, Ana Free, and Bárbara Bandeira.

== Cinema ==

Portuguese cinema appeared at the end of the 19th century, via silent films. In the 1920s that cinema became an important cultural and artistic element. The first Portuguese film, shot in Porto, was directed by in 1896. In homage to the Departure of the Workers from the Lumière Factory (&quot;La Sortie de l&#x27;usine Lumière à Lyon&quot;) by Auguste and Louis Lumière shot in 1895, he filmed the Departure of the Workers from the Confiança Factory (&quot;Saída do Pessoal Operário da Fábrica Confiança&quot;).

José Leitão de Barros pioneered the Portuguese film industry, producing and directing silent films starting in the 1910s. One of the first notable female actresses was Cremilda de Oliveira. Manoel de Oliveira extended de la Velle&#x27;s legacy. His film &quot;&quot;Aniki-Bóbó&quot; (1942), is notable for its innovation and vision of adolescence. Manoel de Oliveira made more than 30 films, including &quot;I&#x27;m Going home&quot; (2001), produced at age 93.

In the 1950s, attention pivoted to technically advanced Hollywood films. In the 1960s, attention returned home. In the 1960s innovative cinema flourished, notably with director Fernando Lopes. He made films that touched on themes of politics and religion, generating debate and controversy at the time. His film &quot;Belarmino&quot; (1964), won the Golden Lion at that year&#x27;s Venice exhibition.

Fernando Lopes led a new generation of directors in the 70s and 80s. This period saw films like &quot;Mudar de Vida&quot; (1966) by Paulo Rocha. In the 70s the School of Reis – a concept related to the teachings of Portuguese director António Reis and Margarida Cordeiro – emerged. Notable proponents are João Pedro Rodrigues and Pedro Costa.

Despite national success, Portuguese films were largely ignored by international festivals until the emergence of directors such as Marco Martins.

In 1989, the first of a new wave of filmmakers, Pedro Costa, presented &quot;O Sangue&quot;. This film, along with its follow-up efforts in the 90s, &quot;Ossos&quot; and &quot;Casa de Lava&quot;, shaped a distinctive style.

Portuguese directors have influenced the international film industry. Manoel de Oliveira was the first Portuguese director to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes in 1985. Since then, other Portuguese filmmakers have competed at major international festivals.

The &quot;telenovela&quot; is a popular genre, brought from Brazil, and the country is a major producer and consumer. Many Portuguese telenovelas have reached international audiences, such as &quot;A Única Mulher&quot;, &quot;Floribella&quot;, &quot;Morangos com Açúcar&quot;, &quot;Laços de Sangue&quot; and &quot;Conta-me como foi&quot;. Telenovela stars include Liliana Santos, Lúcia Moniz, Diogo Morgado, Vera Kolodzig, Sílvia Alberto, Diogo Amaral, Rita Pereira, Joana Ribeiro, Ricardo Pereira, Mariana Monteiro, and Luciana Abreu.

Portuguese authors have participated in international productions; among them Daniela Melchior, Nuno Lopes, Cris Huerta, Helena D&#x27;Algy and Rafael Morais.

Nuno Sá Pessoa and Diana Andringa are known for documentaries, Nuno Markl, Rita Camarneiro, Ricardo Araújo Pereira, Filomena Cautela and Eduardo Serra are TV hosts (&quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2)&quot;.

<text>Specific absorption rate (SAR) is a measure of the rate at which energy is absorbed per unit mass by a human body when exposed to a radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic field. It is defined as the power absorbed per mass of tissue and has units of watts per kilogram (W/kg).

SAR is usually averaged either over the whole body, or over a small sample volume (typically 1 g or 10 g of tissue). The value cited is then the maximum level measured in the body part studied over the stated volume or mass.

== Calculation ==
SAR for electromagnetic energy can be calculated from the electric field within the tissue as

:formula_1

where
:formula_2 is the sample electrical conductivity,
:formula_3 is the RMS electric field,
:formula_4 is the sample density,
:formula_5 is the volume of the sample.
SAR measures exposure to fields between 100 kHz and 10 GHz (known as radio waves). It is commonly used to measure power absorbed from mobile phones and during MRI scans. The value depends heavily on the geometry of the part of the body that is exposed to the RF energy and on the exact location and geometry of the RF source. Thus tests must be made with each specific source, such as a mobile-phone model and at the intended position of use.

=== Mobile phone SAR testing ===

When measuring the SAR due to a mobile phone the phone is placed against a representation of a human head (a &quot;SAR Phantom&quot;) in a talk position. The SAR value is then measured at the location that has the highest absorption rate in the entire head, which in the case of a mobile phone is often as close to the phone&#x27;s antenna as possible. Measurements are made for different positions on both sides of the head and at different frequencies representing the frequency bands at which the device can transmit. Depending on the size and capabilities of the phone, additional testing may also be required to represent usage of the device while placed close to the user&#x27;s body and/or extremities. Various governments have defined maximum SAR levels for RF energy emitted by mobile devices:
* United States: the FCC requires that phones sold have a SAR level at or below 1.6 watts per kilogram (W/kg) taken over the volume containing a mass of 1 gram of tissue that is absorbing the most signal.
* European Union: CENELEC specify SAR limits within the EU, following IEC standards. For mobile phones, and other such hand-held devices, the SAR limit is 2 W/kg averaged over the 10 g of tissue absorbing the most signal (IEC 62209-1).
* India: switched from the EU limits to the US limits for mobile handsets in 2012. Unlike the US, India will not rely solely on SAR measurements provided by manufacturers; random compliance tests are done by a government-run Telecommunication Engineering Center (TEC) SAR Laboratory on handsets and 10% of towers. All handsets must have a hands-free mode.

SAR values are heavily dependent on the size of the averaging volume. Without information about the averaging volume used, comparisons between different measurements cannot be made. Thus, the European 10-gram ratings should be compared among themselves, and the American 1-gram ratings should only be compared among themselves.
To check SAR on your mobile phone, review the documentation provided with the phone, dial *#07# (only works on some models) or visit the manufacturer&#x27;s website.

=== MRI scanner SAR testing ===
For magnetic resonance imaging the limits (described in IEC 60601-2-33) are slightly more complicated:
: Note: Averaging time of 6 minutes.
: (a) Local SAR is determined over the mass of 10 g.
: (b) The limit scales dynamically with the ratio &quot;exposed patient mass / patient mass&quot;:
:: Normal operating mode: Partial body SAR = 10 W/kg − (8 W/kg × exposed patient mass / patient mass).
:: 1st level controlled: Partial body SAR = 10 W/kg − (6 W/kg × exposed patient mass / patient mass).
: (c) In cases where the orbit is in the field of a small local RF transmit coil, care should be taken to ensure that the temperature rise is limited to 1 °C.

== Criticism ==

SAR limits set by law do not consider that the human body is particularly sensitive to the power peaks or frequencies responsible for the microwave hearing effect. Frey reports that the microwave hearing effect occurs with average power density exposures of 400 μW/cm2, well below SAR limits (as set by government regulations).

Notes:

In comparison to the short term, relatively intensive exposures described above, for long-term environmental exposure of the general public there is a limit of 0.08 W/kg averaged over the whole body. A whole-body average SAR of 0.4 W/kg has been chosen as the restriction that provides adequate protection for occupational exposure. An additional safety factor of 5 is introduced for exposure of the public, giving an average whole-body SAR limit of 0.08 W/kg.

=== FCC advice ===
The FCC guide &quot;Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) For Cell Phones: What It Means For You&quot;, after detailing the limitations of SAR values, offers the following &quot;bottom line&quot; editorial:
=== MSBE (minimum SAR with biological effect) ===
In order to find out possible advantages and the interaction mechanisms of electromagnetic fields (EMF), the minimum SAR (or intensity) that could have biological effect (MSBE) would be much more valuable in comparison to studying high-intensity fields. Such studies can possibly shed light on thresholds of non-ionizing radiation effects and cell capabilities (e.g., oxidative response). In addition, it is more likely to reduce the complexity of the EMF interaction targets in cell cultures by lowering the exposure power, which at least reduces the overall rise in temperature. This parameter might differ regarding the case under study and depends on the physical and biological conditions of the exposed target.

== FCC regulations ==
The FCC regulations for SAR are contained in 47 C.F.R. 1.1307(b), 1.1310, 2.1091, 2.1093 and also discussed in OET Bulletin No. 56, &quot;Questions and Answers About the Biological Effects and Potential Hazards of Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields.&quot;

== European regulations ==

Specific energy absorption rate (SAR) averaged over the whole body or over parts of the body, is defined as the rate at which energy is absorbed per unit mass of body tissue and is expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg).

Whole body SAR is a widely accepted measure for relating adverse thermal effects to RF exposure.

Legislative acts in the European Union include directive 2013/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields) (20th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) and repealing Directive 2004/40/EC) in its annex III &quot;THERMAL EFFECTS&quot; for &quot;EXPOSURE LIMIT VALUES AND ACTION LEVELS IN THE FREQUENCY RANGE FROM 100 kHz TO 300 GHz&quot;.

<text>Silicon Alley is an area of high tech companies centered around southern Manhattan&#x27;s Flatiron district in New York City. The term was coined in the 1990s during the dot-com boom, alluding to California&#x27;s Silicon Valley tech center. The term has grown somewhat obsolete since 2003 as New York tech companies spread outside of Manhattan, and New York as a whole is now a top-tier global high technology hub. Silicon Alley, once a metonym for the sphere encompassing the metropolitan region&#x27;s high technology industries, is no longer a relevant moniker as the city&#x27;s tech environment has expanded dramatically both in location and in its scope. New York City&#x27;s current tech sphere encompasses a universal array of applications involving artificial intelligence, the internet, new media, financial technology (&quot;fintech&quot;) and cryptocurrency, biotechnology, game design, and other fields within information technology that are supported by its entrepreneurship ecosystem and venture capital investments.

== Origin ==

The term Silicon Alley was derived from the long-established Silicon Valley in California. It was originally centered in the Flatiron District, in the vicinity of the Flatiron Building at Fifth Avenue near Broadway and 23rd Street, straddling Midtown and Lower Manhattan. Silicon Alley initially also used to extend to Dumbo, a neighborhood in Brooklyn. Columbia University and NYU&#x27;s leaderships were especially important in the alley&#x27;s early development.

The term Silicon Alley may have originated in 1995 by a New York staffing recruiter, Jason Denmark, who was supporting clients in the newly dubbed technical hub in downtown Manhattan; in an effort to attract candidates who, at that time, were focusing on positions in Silicon Valley, he posted in public usenet postings of Object Technology Developers, job ads with the Silicon Alley label. &quot;Subject: NYC - silicon ALLEY&quot; shows up in an internet post by Jason Denmark on February 16, 1995; another Jason Denmark post on June 16, 1995, is &quot;Subject: SILICON &#x27;ALLEY&#x27; POSITIONS.&quot;

The first publication to cover Silicon Alley was @NY, an online newsletter founded in the summer of 1995 by Tom Watson and Jason Chervokas. The first magazine to focus on venture capital opportunities in Silicon Alley, AlleyCat News co-founded by Anna Copeland Wheatley and Janet Stites, was launched in the fall of 1996. Courtney Pulitzer branched off from her @The Scene column with @NY and created Courtney Pulitzer&#x27;s Cyber Scene and her popular networking events Cocktails with Courtney. First Tuesday, co-founded by Vincent Grimaldi de Puget and John Grossbart, became the largest gathering of Silicon Alley, welcoming 500 to 1000 venture capitalists and entrepreneurs every month. It was an initiative of law firm Sonnenschein and the Kellogg School of Management, as well as other corporate founders, including Accenture (then Andersen Consulting), AlleyCat News and Merrill Lynch. Silicon Alley Reporter started publishing in October 1996. It was founded by Jason Calacanis and was in business from 1996 to 2001. @NY, print magazines, and the attending media coverage by the larger New York press helped to popularize both the name, and the idea of New York City as a dot-com center.

In 1997, over 200 members and leaders of Silicon Alley joined NYC entrepreneurs, Andrew Rasiej and Cecilia Pagkalinawan to help wire Washington Irving High School to the Internet. This response and the Department of Education&#x27;s growing need for technology integration marked the birth of Making Opportunities for Upgrading Schools and Education (MOUSE), an organization that today serves tens of thousands of underserved youth in schools in five states and over 20 countries.

== Dot-com bust ==

The rapid growth of internet companies during the 1990s, known as the dot-com bubble, came to a rapid halt during the early 2000s recession. During this economic contraction, many internet companies in Silicon Alley folded. The recession also affected publications that covered the sector. After the dot-com bust, the &quot;Silicon Alley Reporter&quot; was rebranded as &quot;Venture Reporter&quot;, in September 2001, and sold to Dow Jones. Self-financed AlleyCat News ceased publication in October 2001.

== Recovery ==

A couple of years after the dot-com bust, Silicon Alley began making its comeback with the help of NY Tech Meetup, and NextNY. On December 19, 2011, then Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced his choice of Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to build a US$2 billion graduate school of applied sciences on Roosevelt Island, with the goal of transforming New York City into the world&#x27;s premier technology capital. As of 2013, Google&#x27;s second largest office by number of employees, 111 Eighth Avenue, is located in New York. Verizon Communications, headquartered at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was in 2014 in the final stages of completing a US$3 billion fiber-optic telecommunications upgrade throughout New York City.

This revival was not restricted to Lower Manhattan, but was spread throughout New York City. Hence &quot;Silicon Alley&quot; has been considered by some observers to be an obsolete term.

<text>NGC 3115 (also called the Spindle Galaxy or Caldwell 53) is a field lenticular (S0) galaxy in the constellation Sextans. The galaxy was discovered by William Herschel on February 22, 1787. At about 32 million light-years away from Earth, it is several times bigger than the Milky Way. It is a lenticular (S0) galaxy because it contains a disk and a central bulge of stars, but without a detectable spiral pattern. NGC 3115 is seen almost exactly edge-on, but was nevertheless mis-classified as elliptical. There is some speculation that NGC 3115, in its youth, was a quasar.

One supernova has been observed in NGC 3115: SN 1935B (type and mag. unknown).

==Star formation==
NGC 3115 has consumed most of the gas of its youthful accretion disk. It has very little gas and dust left that would trigger new star formation. The vast majority of its component stars are very old.

==Black hole==
In 1992 John Kormendy of the University of Hawaii and Douglas Richstone of the University of Michigan announced what was observed to be a supermassive black hole in the galaxy. Based on orbital velocities of the stars in its core, the central black hole has mass measured to be approximately one billion solar masses (). The galaxy appears to have mostly old stars and little or no activity. The growth of its black hole has also stopped.

In 2011, NASA&#x27;s Chandra X-ray Observatory examined the black hole at the center of the large galaxy. A flow of hot gas toward the supermassive black hole has been imaged, making this the first time clear evidence for such a flow has been observed in any black hole. As gas flows toward the black hole, it becomes hotter and brighter.
The researchers found the rise in gas temperature begins at about 700 light years from the black hole, giving the location of the Bondi radius. This suggests that the black hole in the center of NGC 3115 has a mass of about two billion , supporting previous results from optical observations. This would make NGC 3115 the nearest billion-solar-mass black hole to Earth.

<text>William John &quot;Pete&quot; Knight (November 18, 1929 – May 7, 2004) (Col, USAF) was an American aeronautical engineer, politician, Vietnam War combat pilot, test pilot, and astronaut. He was one of twelve pilots who flew the North American X-15, an experimental spaceplane jointly operated by the U.S. Air Force and NASA. He was also selected for participation in the X-20 Dyna-Soar program.

On October 3, 1967, Knight piloted X-15 Flight 188, the program&#x27;s fastest flight. Flying at a maximum Mach of 6.7 and a maximum speed of 4,520 mph (7,274 km/h), he set a speed record for flight in a winged, powered aircraft. The flight was made in the X-15A-2, the second of three planes in the X-15 fleet.

Two weeks later on October 17, Knight flew X-15 Flight 190, reaching a maximum altitude above 50 miles. This qualified him as an astronaut according to the United States definition of the boundary of space. However, this altitude did not surpass the Kármán line, the internationally accepted boundary of 100 kilometers (62 miles).

==Early life and education==
Knight was born November 18, 1929, in Noblesville, Indiana, to parents William T. Knight (1906–1968) and Mary Emma Knight (1909–1959). Following high school, Knight attended Butler University and Purdue University. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology in 1958.

==Personal==
Knight was married to Helena Stone and they had three sons, Steve, Peter, and David. Helena predeceased Knight. Knight remarried and at his death in 2004 he was survived by his widow Gail, a brother, three sons, four stepchildren and 15 grandchildren.

==Air Force career==
Knight joined the United States Air Force in 1951. While only a second lieutenant, he flew an F-89 at the National Air Show in 1954 and won the Allison Jet Trophy.

Starting in 1958, following his graduation from both U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology and the Air Force Experimental Flight Test Pilot School (Class 58C), Knight served as a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base, California. He was a project test pilot for the F-100 Super Sabre, F-101 Voodoo, F-104 Starfighter and later, T-38 Talon and F-5 Freedom Fighter test programs. In 1960, he was one of six test pilots selected to fly the X-20 Dyna-Soar, which was slated to become the first winged orbital space vehicle capable of lifting reentries and conventional landings. After the X-20 program was canceled in 1963, he completed the astronaut training curriculum through the Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class 63A) at Edwards AFB and was selected to fly the North American X-15.

He had more than his share of eventful flights in the X-15. While climbing through at Mach 4.17 on June 29, 1967, he suffered a total electrical failure and all onboard systems shut down. After reaching a maximum altitude of , he calmly set up a visual approach and, resorting to old-fashioned &quot;seat-of-the-pants&quot; flying, he glided down to a safe emergency landing at Mud Lake, Nevada. For his remarkable feat of airmanship that day, he earned a Distinguished Flying Cross.
On October 3, 1967, Knight set a world aircraft speed record for manned aircraft by piloting the X-15A-2 to (Mach 6.70), a record that still stands today. During 16 flights in the aircraft, Knight also became one of only five pilots to earn their Astronaut Wings by flying an airplane in space, reaching an altitude of .

After nearly ten years of test flying at Edwards AFB, he went to Southeast Asia in 1968, where he completed a total of 253 combat missions in the F-100 during the Vietnam War. Following his combat tour, he served as test director during development of the F-15 Eagle at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. He also was the program director for the International Fighter (F-5) Program at Wright-Patterson. In 1979, he returned to Edwards AFB, and served as a test pilot for the F-16 Fighting Falcon.

After 32 years of service and more than 6,000 hours in the cockpits of more than 100 different aircraft, he retired from the U.S. Air Force as a colonel in 1982.

==Political career==
In 1984, he was elected to the city council of Palmdale, California, and four years later became the city&#x27;s first elected mayor. In 1992, he was elected to serve in the California State Assembly representing the 36th District. He served in the State Senate representing the 17th District from 1996 until his death on May 7, 2004. Knight&#x27;s youngest son, Steve Knight served as assemblyman for the 36th Assembly District from 2008 to 2012, the seat previously held by his father.

===Proposition 22===

Knight&#x27;s brother and son came out as gay, and Knight pursued anti-LGBT legislation in his political work. During his term in the Senate, Knight gained statewide attention in 2000 as the author of Proposition 22, a.k.a. the &quot;Knight Initiative&quot;, the purpose of which was to ban same-sex marriage: &quot;Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.&quot; The proposition passed with 61.4% approval and 38.6% against. On March 9, 2004, Knight&#x27;s son, David Knight, who is gay, married his partner during the period when San Francisco registered same-sex marriages in defiance of state law. These marriages were nullified by the California Supreme Court in 2004. The Court later found Proposition 22 to be unconstitutional in &quot;In re Marriage Cases&quot; (2008).

Knight&#x27;s younger brother died of AIDS-related complications in 1995 at age 60. Of his younger brother&#x27;s homosexuality, Knight said &quot;We never talked about it.&quot;

<text>General Sir Edward Pellew Quinan (9 January 1885 – 13 November 1960) was a British Army commander during the Second World War. In the early part of his career, he was involved in Indian Army campaigns in Afghanistan and Waziristan on the North West Frontier of the Indian Empire, in the days of the British Raj. During the First World War he served with the Indian Army forces in France and Mesopotamia, and was wounded. During the Second World War, Quinan commanded the British and Indian Army forces in the Anglo-Iraqi War, the Syria–Lebanon campaign, and the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. He continued serving in the Middle East until 1943, when he returned to India to command the North West Army, but retired later the same year due to a downgrading of his fitness status.

==Early years and career in Indian Army==
Quinan was of Anglo-Irish descent and was born in Calcutta on 9 January 1885; his father died when he was ten years old. Although his mother later remarried, he was brought up and educated in Dublin by his grandparents and aunts, until he entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1903.

Commissioned a second lieutenant on 9 January 1904, Quinan joined the Indian Army (27th Punjabis) on 25 March 1905. He was promoted to lieutenant on 9 April of the following year. Before the First World War, he saw active service on the North West Frontier of the British Indian Empire and was promoted to captain on 9 January 1913. During the war he fought in France and Mesopotamia, and was appointed a provost marshal on 7 March 1915. He served at the battles of Neuve Chapelle, Loos and the attempt to relieve Kut al Amara; he was wounded at Beit Aisa. Appointed a GSO 3rd Grade on 10 May 1917, he was brevetted to major on 1 January 1918 and promoted to acting major on 2 November.

He returned to India and the Frontier and was a staff officer in the 1919 Afghan War and the subsequent campaign in Waziristan. On one occasion, the aircraft in which he was conducting reconnaissance crashed but he survived unhurt. He wrote the official history of the Waziristan campaign which is considered by military experts to be the model of a campaign history. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his staff work during this campaign. In 1920, he attended Indian Army Staff College in Quetta which is now in Pakistan and served as DAQMG Meerut from 1923 to 1926. After attending the Senior Officers&#x27; School, Belgaum in 1927, he was posted to 3rd Battalion 8th Punjab Regiment (now 3 Baloch) in 1928.

In 1930, he rose to the command of 3rd Battalion 8th Punjab Regiment and was selected to attend the Imperial Defence College, an indication of his suitability for high command. While he was in command at Jhansi in 1930, Amy Johnson, the famous British pilot, made a heavy landing on the parade ground during her epic flight from London to Australia. Quinan was instrumental in getting her Gypsy Moth repaired.

As a colonel in 1933, he was appointed an instructor at the Staff College in Quetta. Among his immediate predecessors at the college was Auchinleck and his successor in 1934 was Montgomery. He then returned to Jhansi as a brigadier to command the 9th (Jhansi) Brigade.

In 1936, during the short reign of King Edward VIII, Quinan was appointed Aide-de-camp Brigadier to the King Emperor and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He was posted to Dacca to assist in anti-terrorist operations against those fighting for Indian independence. In 1937, he commanded his troops in the campaign against the Faqir of Ipi in Waziristan and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. He was promoted to major-general at the end of 1937 but in March 1938 he was forced to take sick leave due to high blood pressure and convalesced in Osborne House before being declared fit again for active service in July 1938 to take up command of the Western Independent District.

==Second World War service in the Middle East==
Quinan spent the early years of the Second World War on the North West Frontier but in March 1941, he was promoted to lieutenant-general, consulted General Sir Archibald Wavell in Cairo and was sent to command the Indian Army Corps in the landing at Basra, Iraq, and was appointed GOC British Troops in Iraq (Iraqforce).

At that time, the pro-German government of Iraq led by Rashid Ali al-Kaylani had tried to capture the RAF base at Habbaniya and force the British to leave the country. During the short Anglo-Iraqi War, Quinan&#x27;s invasion from the south, supported by British troops from Trans-Jordan overthrew the Axis-leaning Iraqi government and replaced it with a pro-British one. He became GOC 10th Army in Persia and Iraq Command. As the Luftwaffe had used bases in Syria to support the Iraqis, an operation was planned to invade Syria from Palestine, supported by Quinan&#x27;s troops in Iraq and replace the Vichy French government of Syria and Lebanon with a Free French one. This was completed successfully. Later in 1941, he planned and executed the invasion of Persia. The principal reason for this was to secure the supply lines to the Soviet Union and to protect British oil installations in Abadan.
Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran, was considered to be pro-German so he was deposed and replaced by his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

 Quinan&#x27;s command, designated Tenth Army in February 1942 was built up as German forces advancing into the Soviet Union began to pose a threat. By the end of 1942 he had 8 divisions and two independent brigades under command (organised into two Corps) as well as the nascent Polish Corps being formed with Polish PoWs released by the Russians. He was knighted in the birthday honours of 1942 and made Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire and in August 1942, he was promoted to be a full general.

The German threat receded following their defeat at Stalingrad and Quinan&#x27;s command began to shrink. By the second quarter of 1943 an Army headquarters was no longer required to control the reduced fighting contingent and Tenth Army HQ was closed. In his War Diaries, the CIGS, General Sir Alan Brooke wrote on 4 August 1942, while working on reorganizing the Middle East and Persia and Iraq Commands, &quot;Quinan unsuitable for 10th Army to be replaced...&quot;

However, it was not until April 1943 that Quinan left the Middle East and was appointed GOC-in-C North Western Army, India. On 16 November 1943, he retired for medical reasons, a recurrence of his previous problem of high blood pressure, and returned to Britain. In November 1945, he was appointed as Colonel of the 8th Punjab Regiment. In the 1946 New Year&#x27;s Honours, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He retired to Barrington, Somerset, and died on 13 November 1960.

==Assessment==
Quinan&#x27;s renowned attention to detail was noted in his Times obituary which recorded that he &quot;astonished, and sometimes appalled his subordinates by his meticulous attention to the duties of the smallest units under his command&quot;.

<doc id="970684" wikidata="Q1182418" url="?curid=970684" title="Deep Space Climate Observatory">
<text>Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR; formerly known as Triana, unofficially known as GoreSat) is a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) space weather, space climate, and Earth observation satellite. It was launched by SpaceX on a Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle on 11 February 2015, from Cape Canaveral. This is NOAA&#x27;s first operational deep space satellite and became its primary system of warning Earth in the event of solar magnetic storms.

DSCOVR was originally proposed as an Earth observation spacecraft positioned at the Sun-Earth Lagrange point, providing live video of the sunlit side of the planet through the Internet as well as scientific instruments to study climate change. Political changes in the United States resulted in the mission&#x27;s cancellation, and in 2001 the spacecraft was placed into storage.

Proponents of the mission continued to push for its reinstatement, and a change in presidential administration in 2009 resulted in DSCOVR being taken out of storage and refurbished, and its mission was refocused to solar observation and early warning of coronal mass ejections while still providing Earth observation and climate monitoring. It launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle on 11 February 2015, and reached on 8 June 2015, joining the list of objects orbiting at Lagrange points.

NOAA operates DSCOVR from its Satellite and Product Operations Facility in Suitland, Maryland. The acquired space data that allows for accurate weather forecasts are carried out in the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado. Archival records are held by the National Centers for Environmental Information, and processing of Earth sensor data is carried out by NASA.

== History ==
DSCOVR began as a proposal in 1998 by then-Vice President Al Gore for the purpose of whole-Earth observation at the Sun-Earth Lagrange point, from Earth. Originally known as Triana, named after Rodrigo de Triana, the first of Columbus&#x27;s crew to sight land in the Americas, the spacecraft&#x27;s original purpose was to provide a near-continuous view of the entire Earth and make that live image available via the Internet. Gore hoped not only to advance science with these images, but also to raise awareness of the Earth itself, updating the influential &quot;Blue Marble&quot; photograph that was taken by Apollo 17. In addition to an imaging camera, a radiometer would take the first direct measurements of how much sunlight is reflected and emitted from the whole Earth (albedo). This data could constitute a barometer for the process of global warming. The scientific goals expanded to measure the amount of solar energy reaching Earth, cloud patterns, weather systems, monitor the health of Earth&#x27;s vegetation, and track the amount of UV light reaching the surface through the ozone layer.

In 1999, NASA&#x27;s Inspector General reported that &quot;the basic concept of the Triana mission was not peer reviewed&quot;, and &quot;Triana&#x27;s added science may not represent the best expenditure of NASA&#x27;s limited science funding&quot;. Members of the U.S. Congress asked the National Academy of Sciences whether the project was worthwhile. The resulting report, released March 2000, stated that the mission was &quot;strong and scientifically vital&quot;.

The Bush administration put the project on hold shortly after George W. Bush&#x27;s inauguration in January 2001. Triana was removed from its original launch opportunity on STS-107 (the ill-fated &quot;Columbia&quot; mission in 2003). The US$150 million spacecraft was placed into nitrogen blanketed storage at Goddard Space Flight Center in November 2001 and remained there for the duration of the Bush administration. NASA renamed the spacecraft Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) in 2003 in an attempt to regain support for the project, but the mission was formally terminated by NASA in 2005.

In November 2008, funded by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Air Force, the spacecraft was removed from storage and underwent testing to determine its viability for launch. After the Obama administration took presidency in 2009, that year&#x27;s budget included US$9 million marked for refurbishment and readiness of the spacecraft, resulting in NASA refurbishing the EPIC instrument and recalibrating the NISTAR instrument. Al Gore used part of his book &quot;Our Choice&quot; (2009) as an attempt to revive debate on the DSCOVR payload. The book mentions legislative efforts by senators Barbara Mikulski and Bill Nelson to get the spacecraft launched. In February 2011, the Obama administration attempted to secure funding to re-purpose the DSCOVR spacecraft as a solar observatory to replace the aging Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft, and requested US$47.3 million in the 2012 fiscal budget toward this purpose. Part of this funding was to allow the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) to construct a coronal mass ejection imager for the spacecraft, but the time required would have delayed DSCOVR&#x27;s launch and it was ultimately not included. NOAA allocated US$2 million in its 2011 budget to initiate the refurbishment effort, and increased funding to US$29.8 million in 2012.

In 2012, the Air Force allocated US$134.5 million to procure a launch vehicle and fund launch operations, both of which were awarded to SpaceX for their Falcon 9 rocket. In September 2013, NASA cleared DSCOVR to proceed to the implementation phase targeting an early 2015 launch, which ultimately took place on 11 February 2015. NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center is providing management and systems engineering to the mission.

In the 2017 documentary, &quot;An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power&quot;, Al Gore speaks of the history of the DSCOVR spacecraft and its relation to climate change.

== Spacecraft ==
DSCOVR is built on the SMEX-Lite spacecraft bus and has a launch mass of approximately . The main science instrument sets are the Sun-observing Plasma Magnetometer (PlasMag) and the Earth-observing NIST Advanced Radiometer (NISTAR) and Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC). DSCOVR has two deployable solar arrays, a propulsion module, boom, and antenna.

The propulsion module had 145 kg of N2H4 propellant. 

From its vantage point, DSCOVR monitors variable solar wind conditions, provides early warning of approaching coronal mass ejections and observes phenomena on Earth, including changes in ozone, aerosols, dust and volcanic ash, cloud height, vegetation cover and climate. At its Sun-Earth location it has a continuous view of the Sun and of the sunlit side of the Earth. After the spacecraft arrived on-site and entered its operational phase, NASA began releasing near-real-time images of Earth through the EPIC instrument&#x27;s website. DSCOVR takes full-Earth pictures about every two hours and is able to process them faster than other Earth observation satellites.

The spacecraft is in a looping halo orbit around the Sun-Earth Lagrange point L1 in a six-month period, with a spacecraft–Earth–Sun angle varying from 4° to 15°.

=== Instruments ===
==== PlasMag ====
The Plasma-Magnetometer (PlasMag) measures solar wind for space weather predictions. It can provide early warning detection of solar activity that could cause damage to existing satellite systems and ground infrastructure. Because solar particles reach about an hour before Earth, PlasMag can provide a warning of 15 to 60 minutes before a coronal mass ejection (CME) arrives. It does this by measuring &quot;the magnetic field and the velocity distribution functions of the electron, proton and alpha particles (helium nuclei) of solar wind&quot;. It has three instruments:
* Magnetometer measures magnetic field
* Faraday cup measures positively charged particles
* Electrostatic analyzer measures electrons

==== EPIC ====
The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) takes images of the sunlit side of Earth for various Earth science monitoring purposes in ten different channels from ultraviolet to near-infrared. Ozone and aerosol levels are monitored along with cloud dynamics, properties of the land, and vegetation.

EPIC has an aperture diameter of , a focal ratio of 9.38, a field of view of 0.61°, and an angular sampling resolution of 1.07 arcseconds. Earth&#x27;s apparent diameter varies from 0.45° to 0.53° full width. Exposure time for each of the 10 narrowband channels (317, 325, 340, 388, 443, 552, 680, 688, 764, and 779 nm) is about 40 ms. The camera produces 2048 × 2048 pixel images, but to increase the number of downloadable images to ten per hour the resolution is averaged to 1024 × 1024 on board. The final resolution is .

==== NISTAR ====
The National Institute of Standards and Technology Advanced Radiometer (NISTAR) was designed and built between 1999 and 2001 by NIST in Gaithersburg, MD and Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies in Boulder, Colorado. NISTAR measures irradiance of the sunlit face of the Earth. This means that NISTAR measures if the atmosphere of Earth is taking in more or less solar energy than it is radiating back towards space. This data is to be used to study changes in Earth&#x27;s radiation budget caused by natural and human activities.

Using NISTAR data, scientists can help determine the impact that humanity is having on the atmosphere of Earth and make the necessary changes to help balance the radiation budget. The radiometer measures in four channels:
* For total radiation in ultraviolet, visible and infrared in the range 0.2–100 μm
* For reflected solar radiation in the ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared in the range 0.2–4 μm
* For reflected solar radiation in infrared in the range 0.7–4 μm
* For calibration purposes in the range 0.3–1 μm

== Launch ==
The DSCOVR launch was conducted by launch provider SpaceX using their Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket. The launch of DSCOVR took place on 11 February 2015, following two scrubbed launches. It took DSCOVR 110 days from when it left Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), Florida, to reach its target destination away from Earth at the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point.

=== Launch attempt history ===
== Operation ==
On 6 July 2015, DSCOVR returned its first publicly released view of the entire sunlit side of Earth from away, taken by the EPIC instrument. EPIC provides a daily series of Earth images, enabling the first-time study of daily variations over the entire globe. The images, available 12 to 36 hours after they are made, have been posted to a dedicated web page since September 2015.

DSCOVR was placed in operation at the L1 Lagrange point to monitor the Sun, because the constant stream of particles from the Sun (the solar wind) reaches L1 about 60 minutes before reaching Earth. DSCOVR will usually be able to provide a 15- to 60-minute warning before a surge of particles and magnetic field from a coronal mass ejection (CME) reaches Earth and creates a geomagnetic storm. DSCOVR data will also be used to improve predictions of the impact locations of a geomagnetic storm to be able to take preventative action. Electronic technologies such as satellites in geosynchronous orbit are at risk of unplanned disruptions without warnings from DSCOVR and other monitoring satellites at L1.

On 16–17 July 2015, DSCOVR took a series of images showing the Moon during a transit of Earth. The images were taken between 19:50 and 00:45 UTC. The animation was composed of monochrome images taken in different color filters at 30-second intervals for each frame, resulting in a slight color fringing for the Moon in each finished frame. Due to its position at Sun–Earth L1, DSCOVR will always see the Moon illuminated and will always see its far side when it passes in front of Earth.

On 19 October 2015, NASA opened a new website to host near-live &quot;Blue Marble&quot; images taken by EPIC of Earth. Twelve images are released each day, every two hours, showcasing Earth as it rotates on its axis. The resolution of the images ranges from , and the short exposure times renders points of starlight invisible.

On 27 June 2019, DSCOVR was put into safe mode due to an anomaly with the laser gyroscope of the Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU), part of the spacecraft&#x27;s attitude control system. Operators programmed a software patch that allows DSCOVR to operate without a laser gyroscope, using only the star tracker for angular rate information. DSCOVR came out of the safe hold on 2 March 2020, and resumed normal operations.

<text>Vera Francevna Mencikova (, &quot;Vera Frantsevna Menchik&quot;; ; 16 February 1906 – 26 June 1944), was a Russian-born Czechoslovak chess player who primarily resided in England. She was the first and longest-reigning Women&#x27;s World Chess Champion from 1927 to 1944, winning the championship a record eight times primarily in round-robin tournaments. In an era when women primarily competed against other women, Menchik was the first and only woman competing in master-level tournaments with the world&#x27;s best players.

Menchik was born in Moscow to a Czech father and English mother. She began playing chess competitively in school at age 14 not long before the Russian Revolution led her family to leave Russia and move to England in 1921. She joined the Hastings Chess Club in 1923, where she began training with James Drewitt and Géza Maróczy. Menchik established herself as the best female player in the country in 1925 by defeating the British women&#x27;s champion Edith Price in two matches, and then the world by winning the inaugural Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship in 1927.

Menchik began competing in master-level tournaments in 1928. Following her first big success at Ramsgate in 1929 when she shared second place with Akiba Rubinstein, she was regularly invited to these elite events for the next decade, including the local Hastings Congress. Her best result in the Hastings Premier tournament was in 1931/32 when she defeated future world champion Max Euwe and Mir Sultan Khan. Late in her career, Menchik won a lone Women&#x27;s World Championship match against Sonja Graf, the next-leading female player of her era. Menchik was active up until her death in 1944, when she was killed in a German air raid that destroyed her home during the Second World War.

Menchik was the dominant female chess player before the war, winning at least 59 games in a row at the Women&#x27;s World Championship tournaments. Highlights of her successes against male players included two victories and a positive score against Euwe and a positive score in 29 known games against George Thomas, who received the International Master (IM) title. Master-level players that Menchik defeated were said to be members of the Vera Menchik Club, which included six players who received the Grandmaster (GM) title or the honorary equivalent. The trophy for the winning team at the Women&#x27;s Chess Olympiad is named the Vera Menchik Cup in her honour.

==Early life and background==

Vera Mencikova was born on 16 February 1906 in Moscow to Olga () and František Menčík, who were English and Czech respectively. She had a younger sister Olga who was born a year or two later and also became a chess player. Her mother and father both worked for estate owners who were members of the Russian nobility. Her mother was a governess who acted as a private tutor for the owners&#x27; children while her father was the manager of their estates. Her mother&#x27;s parents already lived in Russia, where her mother&#x27;s father Arthur worked as a cotton manufacturer. Vera&#x27;s father came to Russia in 1904 after an invite from his uncle to work as a mechanic at his textile factory. Her father later owned a mill and resumed working as a mechanic. Menchik and her family lived in a large six-room flat and had an above-average standard of living.

Menchik was taught how to play chess by her father at age nine. When she was eleven, the Russian Revolution that started in 1917 began to reshape her life. Her family was forced to share the extra space in their flat with the impoverished residents from the lower floors of their building. Menchik switched her education from a private girls&#x27; school to a Soviet public school, and her father&#x27;s mill was seized. At her new school, the students started a chess club in her last year in Moscow. Menchik joined the club and played her first tournament there at age 14 with other students and teachers, none of whom were women or girls. Although the tournament was not completed, Menchik would have finished in second or third place. She stated that the tournament &quot;gave birth to [her] sporting spirit&quot;. Not long after, Menchik left Russia in 1921 amidst her parents splitting up and their family having already been forced to move into a different home. She and her sister stayed with their mother and moved to Hastings on the southeastern coast of England to live with their maternal grandmother Marie, who had already left Moscow for Hastings because of the war. Meanwhile, her father moved back to Bohemia to live in his childhood home in Bystrá nad Jizerou.

When Menchik arrived in England, she could only speak Russian. She began to focus more on chess in part because she did not need to know English well to play. Menchik joined the Hastings Chess Club in March 1923 at age 17. The club was highly-renowned, having already begun to host the Hastings International Chess Christmas Congress, an annual tournament that featured some of the best players in the world. She had considered joining the club for over a year before finally doing so. Menchik&#x27;s first coach at the club was James Drewitt, the club champion that year. In the later part of the year, she began taking private lessons with Géza Maróczy, a Hungarian who later became one of the inaugural players to be awarded the Grandmaster (GM) title in 1950. This coaching made her one of the only female chess players at the time to partake in formal training. Menchik was only able to work with Maróczy until early 1924 when he left England to go to the United States. At this point, she resumed training with Drewitt. Although she only trained with Maróczy for a short time, she credited him with inspiring her to try and compete at a higher level.

==Chess career==
===1923–27: Price rivalry, Women&#x27;s World Champion===

Menchik began competing regularly in chess tournaments in her first few months at the Hastings Chess Club in 1923, starting with an intra-club match between the ladies team and a team of third class players. She first represented Hastings in the Sexton Cup inter-club competition that June, playing on the 28th and final board. A few months later in September, she began playing at the county level for East Sussex on the 39th board out of 60. The most significant tournament she entered that year was a first class section of the 1923/24 Hastings Christmas Congress, which was above the level of second class at which she had been playing in the prior months and two levels below the renowned highest international level. Although she finished in joint seventh place out of ten players with a score of 3½/9, she made a draw against Edith Price, the two-time reigning British women&#x27;s champion.

A year later, Menchik began facing Price regularly to determine who was the better player. Both of them finished in second place in their respective sections at the first class level in the 1924/25 Hastings Christmas Congress. They played a playoff to decide the top first class woman, but the game ended in a draw. Because of this draw as well as Menchik being unable to compete in the British Women&#x27;s Chess Championship because she wasn&#x27;t a citizen, Price challenged Menchik to a match. They ended up playing two five-game matches, one in April and one in June. Menchik won both matches 3–2 (+2–1=2 and +3–2=0), establishing herself as the best female player in the country. Menchik had another big success that August at the Stratford tournament, where she finished runner-up to George Thomas. She won her game against Thomas and earned a prize of £8 (equivalent to about £ in 2022). At some point during the year, the Sussex Chess Association formally recognized Menchik as a first class player before she made it to the semifinals of the county championship. Menchik ended 1925 by playing the Major section of the Christmas Congress, the first time there was a female player in that section. She finished in joint last with three others, despite drawing against four of the five players who came in second place through joint fifth place.

Menchik began to receive media attention prior to the London Girls&#x27; Championship, where she won the first two editions with perfect scores in 1926 and 1927. There were over 30 photographers from the press present on the day of the opening ceremonies at the inaugural edition primarily to report on Menchik. She also had the opportunity to speak on BBC Radio. Her sister finished in joint second and runner-up at these two championships. In-between these tournaments, Menchik won the Major-level reserve section at the Christmas Congress, her first notable tournament victory at a high-level open tournament. The following year at the tournament at the end of 1927, she defeated Abraham Baratz, a game recognized as her first victory over an established master.

Menchik&#x27;s biggest triumph in 1927 was becoming the inaugural Women&#x27;s World Champion at age 21. The International Chess Federation (FIDE) hosted the first Chess Olympiad in July 1927 and decided to have a women&#x27;s tournament in conjunction with the event. The event organizers wanted and were able to convince FIDE to retroactively declare the winner of the women&#x27;s tournament the first FIDE Women&#x27;s World Champion. The tournament was a 12-player round-robin featuring representatives of eight European countries. Menchik won the tournament with a dominant score of 10½/11, only drawing once against Edith Michell. She finished 1½ points ahead of the runner-up Katarina Beskow, and 5 points ahead of Price, who came in sixth place with an even score.

===1928–29: First master events, Ramsgate success===
Menchik started playing master-level events in 1928, beginning with Scarborough in May where she was included in the Premier section after two invited American players became unavailable. She demonstrated she could compete at the Premier level, achieving an even score of 4½/9 to finish in joint seventh place out of ten. Alexander Alekhine, the World Champion at the time, commented, &quot;She is without a doubt a phenomenon, and her victory over [Fred] Yates in the first round will be historical.&quot; Menchik also made her Premier debut in the reserve section of the Hastings Christmas Congress that year, and regularly played in the main Premier tournament thereafter until 1937.
During 1929, Menchik had the most successful open tournament of her career in the Kent Congress at Ramsgate, a Scheveningen team event between a British team and a foreign team, each with seven players. Menchik played on the foreign team, which also included former World Champion José Raúl Capablanca and her former coach Maróczy. The British team included Thomas and Yates. The foreign team won the tournament by a wide margin, and Menchik scored an unbeaten 5/7 (+3–0=4) to share second place on her team and in the tournament overall with Akiba Rubinstein, who previously had a chance to challenge for the World Championship. She was a ½ point behind Capablanca and a ½ point ahead of Maróczy. Menchik&#x27;s performance drew widespread attention and resulted in her regularly receiving invitations to play international tournaments in the years to come, the first two of which were in Paris and Carlsbad in Czechoslovakia later that year. The 22-player Carlsbad event featured nearly all of the world&#x27;s top players. Although Menchik did not fare well at either tournament, finishing in second-to-last and last place respectively with scores of 3/11 and 3/21, she notably won games against Edgard Colle in Paris and both Albert Becker and Friedrich Sämisch in Carlsbad. Sämisch was one of the inaugural players to receive the Grandmaster title. The victory over Becker came after he had suggested earlier in the tournament that any player Menchik defeated would be deemed a member of the &quot;Vera Menchik Club&quot;. Despite Menchik&#x27;s low score, Alekhine reaffirmed that she demonstrated talent and potential. At her next tournament in Barcelona, Menchik finished in eighth place out of fifteen participants, narrowly earning one of the prizes allocated to the top eight.

===1930–32: Two title defenses, two victories over Euwe===
Menchik defended the Women&#x27;s World Championship title for the first two times in 1930 and 1931 at the Olympiads in Hamburg and Prague respectively. She won both editions, each of which was played as a double round-robin featuring the same five players. She scored 6½/8 in 1930 and a perfect 8/8 in 1931. In the 1930 edition, she won by 1 point, having drawn a game against the runner-up Paula Wolf-Kalmar and lost a game to the third-place finisher Wally Henschel, her only loss at any of the Women&#x27;s World Championship tournaments. The 1931 edition was the first of four consecutive world championships in which she had a perfect score, a run that spanned 45 games in total.

Menchik&#x27;s best results at the Hastings Christmas Congress came in the early 1930s. At the 1930/31 edition, she defeated Max Euwe, the winner of the tournament. Euwe was already well-established as one of the best chess players in the world and ultimately became World Champion a few years later in 1935. Her victory over Euwe attracted global press coverage. Menchik next faced Euwe at the following edition and won again. She also defeated Mir Sultan Khan, who finished in fourth place, at the same tournament. Overall, Menchik scored 4/9 to earn joint fifth place out of ten at that 1931/32 tournament, the best result of her career at the Christmas Congress. Her next-best result came the following year when she finished in joint sixth place.

Most of Menchik&#x27;s other biggest successes in the early 1930s also happened in England. She became the Hastings Club champion for the first and only time in 1930. The following year, she had one of the most significant tournament victories of her career, winning the Major Open section at the 1931 British Championship. The Major section was held in conjunction with the national championship, which she still could not enter because of her lack of citizenship, and was for high-level international players. Menchik won the section with an undefeated score of 9/11, one point ahead of Edward Jackson. Two of her seven wins came against Jackson and Harry Golombek.

===1933–37: Two matches with Graf, Maribor success===

The year after Menchik defended the Women&#x27;s World Championship title a third time in 1933 in Folkestone, England, she was challenged to an informal four-game match by Sonja Graf, a German player she had never played against who also regularly competed in open tournaments. The match was hosted by Max Euwe in his home. Graf won the first game with the black pieces before Menchik recovered to win the last three games and the match. Graf&#x27;s performance was good enough for the two to discuss the possibility of a match for the Women&#x27;s World Championship in London. It never materialised, however, in part because Graf hurt her reputation by losing a match 0–6 to Paul Heuäcker, who was better regarded as a chess composer than a competitive chess player. After Menchik&#x27;s fourth Women&#x27;s World Championship title defence in 1935 in Warsaw, Menchik and Graf finally did play a second match a month before the next Women&#x27;s World Championship tournament in 1937. Like the previous match, it was privately organized, this time with the help of William Zimdin, an Estonian luxury hotel owner who sponsored the match to be held at his Panhans Hotel in Semmering, Austria. Unlike the previous match, it was recognized by FIDE at the time as for the world championship title, albeit not for the Women&#x27;s World Championship trophy. Menchik won the match convincingly by a score of 11½–4½ (+9–2=5). While Graf had an even 4/8 score with the white pieces, she lost her first seven games with the black pieces. Graf did not come close to challenging Menchik at the 1937 World Championship either, finishing in joint third place with 9/14 in her tournament debut, five points behind Menchik.

Two of the most notable open international tournaments Menchik in which participated in the 1930s were in Maribor in Yugoslavia and in Moscow. The Maribor tournament in August 1934 was one of Menchik&#x27;s biggest successes in open international tournaments. Menchik finished in third place out of nine with a score of 5/8 behind only Vasja Pirc and Lajos Steiner, both of whom would be named inaugural International Masters by FIDE in 1950. The players she finished ahead of included Josef Rejfíř, Lajos Asztalos, and Milan Vidmar Jr., who all received the International Master title, and Rudolf Spielmann. On New Year&#x27;s Day the next year, Menchik made a draw against Euwe at the Christmas Congress, their last encounter. The Moscow tournament in 1935 was similar to Carlsbad in 1929 in terms of the size and in that it featured many of the world&#x27;s top players. It was also an opportunity for Menchik to return to her hometown. She did not fare well, scoring 1½/19 with no wins and three draws. Her best game result was a draw against Salo Flohr, who finished in joint first place with Mikhail Botvinnik. This draw was well-received by the Moscow public, in part because it helped the Soviet player Botvinnik finish in joint first instead of second to Flohr. Menchik attributed her general poor results at the tournament to spending her free time exploring the city.

Other international tournaments Menchik participated in during the mid-1930s were the Czechoslovakian Championship and the international section of the British Championship. In the Czechoslovakian Championship, she finished in joint last place with four others who scored 4½/11 in the 1933 tournament in Mnichovo Hradiště. Menchik&#x27;s next Czechoslovakian Championship was in 1936 in Poděbrady, where she finished in thirteenth place out of eighteen with a score of 7/13 and the tournament also included international players. In-between those tournaments, Menchik fared better at the 1935 Major Open at the British Championship in Yarmouth, scoring 7/11 to finish in third place behind Samuel Reshevsky and Adolf Seitz. She won her game against the tournament winner Reshevsky, who lost on time and had a perfect score in the rest of the tournament. Menchik also defeated Graf, who finished in joint seventh place with 5/11. This was the only time Menchik played Graf in an open tournament.

===1938–44: Competitive Women&#x27;s World Championship===
After Menchik got married in 1937, she was able to become a British citizen and represent England in competitions. She participated in a 1938 match between Britain and Holland, drawing both her games on the eighth board out of ten against Willem Mühring. Britain won the match by one point. Later that year, Menchik became the first woman to compete in the British Championship, her only appearance at the event. She scored an even 5½/11 to finish in seventh place out of twelve. She drew all of the players who placed above her except for Golombek. Menchik defended her world championship title for the last time in 1939 in Buenos Aires. The tournament was played as a 20-player round-robin. Menchik&#x27;s nine-year win streak of at least 59 games at these tournaments came to an end when she was held to a draw in Round 11 by Milda Lauberte. The next round, Menchik nearly lost to Graf but was able to recover and win the game even though Graf at one point had a winning endgame. After another draw in the following round, Menchik did not lose or draw any of her remaining games and won the tournament with a score of 18/19, two points ahead of Graf. Had Graf won their game and all else was the same, they would have shared first place.

The 1939 Women&#x27;s World Championship was the last time Menchik was able to leave Britain due to the Second World War, which began during the tournament. She was still able to play in some tournaments in England. She had a good result at the London Easter Congress in 1940 in which she finished in third place with a score of 6/9, behind only Golombek and Paul List, and ahead of Thomas. Two years later, Menchik played a match against Jacques Mieses, who was still an active competitor at 77 years old. Mieses had previously been one of the top ten players in the world around 1900 and later would be one of the inaugural players to receive the Grandmaster title. This match was the first between a woman and someone who had been an established top men&#x27;s player. Menchik defeated Mieses in the match 6½–3½ (+4–1=5). Menchik was still competing right up to her death in 1944. Her team had qualified for the semifinals at the Southern Counties Chess Union Championship, her last tournament, but died the day before her next game was scheduled to take place.

==Playing style==

Menchik was a positional player. Chess author E. G. R. Cordingley described her style of play as, &quot;Her game was characterised by solid position-play, with the definite aim of bringing about a favourable end-game and of avoiding wild complications.&quot; He compared her style of play to that of Samuel Reshevsky and Salo Flohr, but stated that she was not as accomplished as them because she lacked their imagination. Menchik&#x27;s style also resembled that of her coach Géza Maróczy. Other players such as Harry Golombek and Julius du Mont likewise pointed out her lack of imagination as the reason she was not a higher-level player. On the other hand, Alekhine and Capablanca, the two World Champions who played against her the most often, did not see such a deficiency and believed she had more potential. Menchik played chess with a calm demeanor at the board. She was described as sitting &quot;all game with her hands in front without even moving a muscle in her face.&quot; Gideon Ståhlberg, one of the inaugural grandmasters, praised her sportsmanship, saying, &quot;Vera Menchik was relaxed in both her wins and losses. When an opponent won a good game, she was the first to congratulate him.&quot; Menchik&#x27;s passive style of play was regarded as resembling her passive personality.

Menchik had a preference for playing 1.d4 (the Queen&#x27;s Pawn Game) with the white pieces over other first moves. With the black pieces, she commonly defended against 1.e4 (the King&#x27;s Pawn Game) with the French Defence (1.e4 e6). She regularly defended against 1.d4 with the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6). The French Defence was the opening most associated with Menchik. She gave a lecture on this opening at the Hastings Chess Club as early as 1928. Hugh Storr-Best, a player who took lessons with Menchik, stated that the French Defence was the focus of her instruction on playing with the black pieces. Menchik credited James Drewitt with improving her understanding of closed openings, while crediting Maróczy with improving the theory aspects of her game. Golombek commented that Menchik &quot;knew her theory very well: openings as well as endgames&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Achievements===
Menchik was undoubtably the best female chess player before the Second World War. She was the inaugural Women&#x27;s World Chess Champion from 1927 until her death in 1944. Her nearly 17-year reign as Women&#x27;s World Champion is the longest in chess history, ahead of the next-longest 16-year reign of Nona Gaprindashvili from 1962 to 1978 and the 13-year reign of Maia Chiburdanidze from 1978 to 1991. Emanuel Lasker, the World Chess Champion for 27 years from 1894 to 1921, was the only player with a longer reign as world champion. Alexander Alekhine was also world champion for 17 years, split between two reigns.

Menchik was the first and only woman accepted as a master in the period she was competing. The closest any other woman came to challenging Menchik while she was Women&#x27;s World Champion was Sonja Graf, the only other woman primarily competing in high-level open tournaments at the time, albeit not at as high of a level as Menchik. Graf established herself as a capable competitive player in 1931 when she began working with Eduard Dyckhoff and Siegbert Tarrasch. Graf had an attacking tactical playing style completely opposite to Menchik&#x27;s passive style. Menchik had a dominant record against Graf of +15–3=5. Beyond Graf, Price was the only other female player to have multiple known wins against Menchik, albeit before she became world champion. The only other women to have any recorded wins against Menchik are Wally Henschel in the Women&#x27;s World Championship and Elaine Saunders.

Menchik never had a FIDE title because FIDE did not establish the Grandmaster or International Master titles until 1950 after her death and they have never awarded a title to anyone posthumously. Menchik had a record of about 25% against GM-level players and a record of nearly 50% against IM-level players. As such, she is generally recognized as an IM-strength level player. Max Euwe was the only World Champion she won or drew a game against, although she achieved this (in 1930 and 1931) before Euwe became World Champion. The only other World Champions she faced regularly were Capablanca and Alekhine, who won all of their nine and eight games against her respectively. Nonetheless, both Capablanca and Alekhine regularly praised Menchik&#x27;s ability. When asked &quot;are there any women who played good chess&quot; in 1932, Capablanca replied, &quot;One. Her name is Vera Menchik... She played against me and she is very strong.&quot;

===Vera Menchik Club===

Master-level players who lost to Menchik were said to be &quot;members&quot; of the &quot;Vera Menchik Club&quot;, a term that was used by both these high-level players and the press. This concept originated at the Carlsbad tournament in 1929 when Albert Becker suggested the idea as a means of ridicule after Menchik lost her opening-round game. He also suggested players who drew against Menchik be deemed &quot;candidate members&quot;. Before the same tournament, chess journalist Hans Kmoch also mocked Menchik by stating he would &quot;go on stage as a ballerina&quot; if Menchik scored more than three points. Becker himself became the first member of the club when he lost to Menchik in the third round. Although Menchik only scored exactly three points in Carlsbad, Kmoch expressed regret over his declaration and his behavior in light of Menchik&#x27;s performance midway through the tournament. The notion of the club grew in popularity after the tournament and was routinely mentioned in the press thereafter. Max Euwe and George Thomas, both of whom had negative scores against Menchik, were each declared to be &quot;president&quot; of the club by the press or other master-level players on different occasions.

Out of the inaugural 27 players to be awarded the Grandmaster title by FIDE in 1950, four of them were members of the Vera Menchik Club, eight of them were candidate members, six played Menchik but never lost or drew against her in two games each on average, while the remaining nine never faced her. The inaugural GM members were: Max Euwe (+2–1=1), Jacques Mieses (+5–3=6), Samuel Reshevsky (+1–1=0), and Friedrich Sämisch (+1–0=0), where Menchik&#x27;s records against each player are given in parentheses. The inaugural GM candidate members of the club were Salo Flohr (+0–7=3), Ernst Grünfeld (+0–0=2), Andor Lilienthal (+0–1=2), Géza Maróczy (+0–1=3), Miguel Najdorf (+0–0=2), Akiba Rubinstein (+0–1=1), Saviely Tartakower (+0–3=2), and Milan Vidmar (+0–1=2).

Other members of the club included two players awarded the Honorary Grandmaster title by FIDE, namely Eero Böök (+1–0=0) and Harry Golombek (+1–4=4). The players who received the International Master title in the club included Conel Hugh O&#x27;Donel Alexander, Albert Becker, Stefan Fazekas, Josef Rejfíř, Lajos Steiner, George Thomas, and William Winter, among others. Menchik also faced many master-level players who were never considered for any FIDE titles, typically because they had already died before FIDE began awarding titles. Edgard Colle and Mir Sultan Khan were members of the club who are generally recognized to be GM-strength. Reginald Michell and Fred Yates were members of the club generally recognized to be IM-strength that Menchik defeated multiple times. George Thomas was Menchik&#x27;s most frequent opponent among master-level players and she had a positive score against him of +10–6=13 in their known results.

===Women&#x27;s chess===
When Menchik first arrived in England, male chess players greatly outnumbered female chess players, particularly in competitions. Women primarily competed against other women, and it was still common for chess clubs to not allow women to join. There were some women competing at the second-class level, and the very best were competing at the first-class level. At the Hastings Christmas Congress in particular, Menchik was the first player to go past the first-class level and play in the Major section in 1925, subsequently reaching the reserves of international-level Premier section in 1928 and the main Premier section the following year.

Although Menchik had ties to England, Czechoslovakia, and Russia, she was never fully recognized as belonging to any of these countries. She could not become a British citizen until 1937. Even though she represented Czechoslovakia in her most successful years, she did not speak Czech and was rarely able to visit the country. The Moscow tournament in 1935 was the only time she was able to return to Russia after leaving. After Menchik&#x27;s death, none of the countries she represented made a strong effort to sustain her legacy. The country that sought to carry on her legacy the most in the near-term was the Soviet Union. Part of the reason Menchik was invited to the Moscow tournament was the hope that her appearance in the event would help bolster Soviet women&#x27;s chess. A little over two decades later, Soviet player and former Women&#x27;s World Champion Elisaveta Bykova wrote the first biography about Menchik. Bykova stated that Menchik&#x27;s visit to Moscow was the inspiration for her taking a serious interest in the game.

The Soviet Union was successful in becoming the leading country in women&#x27;s chess after Menchik&#x27;s death. They began holding women&#x27;s championships in 1932 and after Menchik&#x27;s appearance in Moscow in 1935, there were 5000 women competing to qualify for these championships the following year. Over a span of nearly 40 years, Soviet players won the next 15 Women&#x27;s World Championships, which were reorganized primarily as matches after Lyudmila Rudenko won the vacant title in 1950. The majority of that success was by Georgian players Gaprindashvili and Chiburdanidze. Only Bykova and Olga Rubtsova, the champions from 1953 to 1962, were Russian. Rudenko was born in the Ukrainian part of the Russian Empire, but later lived in Moscow. The initial three champions were the top three finishers at the 1949/50 Women&#x27;s World Championship tournament to decide Menchik&#x27;s successor. Rudenko did not dominate the tournament in the way Menchik always did as her winning score of 12/15 was lower than any of Menchik&#x27;s percentage scores, even though Rudenko defeated both of her closest competitors. None of these three champions were regarded as being as good as Menchik, albeit it was difficult to make a proper comparison because all three were at least age 40 when they became champion and because none of them competed against the top male players. Rudenko was the first woman to receive the International Master title in 1950. Bykova and Rubtsova also were awarded the IM title when they became the Women&#x27;s World Champion. Gaprindashvili and Chiburdanidze were regarded as the next dominant women&#x27;s champions after Menchik, owing to both of them holding the title for over a decade and their success in open tournaments. They were the first and second women respectively to receive the Grandmaster title.

Because Vera Menchik was the easily the best female chess player, her passive positional playing style led to the stereotype that women could not be good attacking tactical players. In modern chess, the opposite stereotype exists and it is believed that the strongest female chess players tend to have attacking styles. These more aggressive styles became associated with Gaprindashvili and later Judit Polgár, the latter of whom is widely acknowledged as the best female chess player in history. Polgár herself is also capable of a more long-term strategic style of play.

===Honours===

Menchik was inducted into the World Chess Hall of Fame in 2011. She was the 16th inductee and the first woman to be inducted. When FIDE began hosting the Women&#x27;s Chess Olympiad in 1957, they named the championship trophy for the gold medal team the Vera Menchik Cup. FIDE commemorated the 50th anniversary of her death by making 1994 the &quot;Year of Vera Menchik&quot;. Menchik has been featured on postage stamps in a few different countries, including the Czech Republic in 1996.

Various memorial tournaments have been held in Menchik&#x27;s honour. In the 1960s, the Hastings Chess Club hosted a junior tournament for at least a few years for local players under age 15 at the insistence of an anonymous donor. The DPP chess club in Prague in the Czech Republic has hosted the Vera Menchik Memorial, an annual or biannual open rapid tournament that began in 2016 and has been held five times as of 2022. The English Chess Federation began hosting the Caplin Menchik Memorial in London in 2022, named for Menchik and the sponsor Caplin Systems. The inaugural edition was a ten-player women&#x27;s round-robin tournament designed to give lower-titled and untitled players the opportunity to earn norms for the Woman International Master (WIM) and Woman Grandmaster (WGM) titles. It was the first memorial tournament for Menchik that England hosted since an open tournament in Maidstone in 1994 for the Year of Vera Menchik.

Because of the circumstances of Menchik&#x27;s death, few of her awards have survived. The Hastings Chess Club displays Menchik&#x27;s gold medal that honours her long reign as Women&#x27;s World Champion. The medal had been in the possession of her sister&#x27;s husband. &quot;The New York Times&quot; featured Menchik in their obituary series &quot;Overlooked&quot; in September 2022.

==Personal life==

===Family===
Menchik married Rufus Henry Streatfield Stevenson in October 1937 when she was age 31 and he was age 59. She changed her name to Vera Stevenson, but still used her birth name in competitions. Stevenson had previously been married to Agnes Lawson, another high-level chess player who competed in the Women&#x27;s World Championship tournaments, until her death in 1935. During Menchik&#x27;s marriage, she lived with her husband in London, having already moved to the Bayswater area of the city after taking a coaching position at the Empire Social Club there in 1931. Stevenson worked as a pharmacist and was a prominent chess administrator who had some experience as a competitive chess player, having won the Kent County championship. He served as the honorary secretary of the Southern Counties Chess Association for 26 years and later became the honorary secretary of the British Chess Federation beginning in 1938. In these roles, he started county competitions, raised funds, and sought to welcome less experienced players into the game. He was also a news editor and subscriptions manager for &quot;British Chess Magazine&quot;. While her husband was an editor, Menchik influenced the magazine to include more coverage of women&#x27;s chess tournaments and other topics related to women&#x27;s chess. Menchik and Stevenson were married for a little over five years until his death in February 1943. By 1940, his health had already began to deteriorate. Menchik and Stevenson were believed to have had a strong marriage.

Menchik&#x27;s sister Olga was also an accomplished chess player. She finished in equal first at the London Girls&#x27; Championship in 1928 the year after Vera became too old to participate, ending up as the runner-up after losing the playoff. Olga participated in the Women&#x27;s World Championship competitions alongside Vera twice. Her best result was in 1935 when she finished in fourth place out of ten with a score of 5½/9, a ½ point behind the bronze medallist. She defeated the three lowest-finishers, lost to her sister, and drew against her other five opponents. Olga&#x27;s only other appearance was at the next Women&#x27;s World Championship in 1937 when she finished in joint 17th place out of 26 players with a score of 6½/14. She did not face Vera this time due to the Swiss format used in this edition.

===Work===
Menchik earned a living primarily through chess-related positions. Although she was not a full-time professional player, she supplemented the limited prize money she earned in competition by giving chess lessons, serving as a chess editor for different journals, and serving as a host at different chess clubs. She also earned money by giving simultaneous exhibitions. Menchik was an editor for the &quot;Social Chess&quot; journal with William Winter and later served as the opening columnist and games editor for &quot;Chess&quot; magazine during the Second World War. Also during the war, Menchik became the director of the British National Chess Centre in London in September 1939. She held the position for about a year until the building was destroyed by a fire when the German Luftwaffe bombed London during The Blitz early in the Second World War. After this bombing, Menchik joined the West London Chess Club. When chess lessons became less popular during the war, another way Menchik earned money was by giving lessons in the card game bridge.

===Character===
Menchik was generally well-liked for her personable character and her interest in other people. Her popularity was one of the reasons she regularly received invitations to tournaments. Menchik, like most other players of IM-strength, did not aim to be fully dedicated on chess compared to the majority of the world&#x27;s top players and those of GM-strength. The two strongest events of Menchik&#x27;s career in Carlsbad and Moscow were both located in the two other countries where she had ties. At these tournaments, Menchik took the opportunity to visit her father at the former and visited various attractions in the city at the latter, factors that may have contributed to her last-place finishes at these events. Some of Menchik&#x27;s other recreational interests were seeing plays and films, playing tennis, and modelling clay.

==Death==
Menchik was killed on 26 June 1944 when her house in south London was destroyed in a direct hit by one of the earliest V-1 flying bomb attacks during the Second World War. Her sister and her mother were also killed in the attack as the entire family had sought shelter in the basement of their home. They had the option to hide in a bomb shelter in their backyard or a shelter underneath the nearby Clapham North tube station, both of which survived the attack. Nonetheless, they would not have known whether they had enough time to reach either shelter. These flying bombs were guided missiles that the German Luftwaffe launched from occupied land across the English Channel for several months from 13 June just two weeks before Menchik&#x27;s death through October. They had an intermediate range of 160 miles, but were too imprecise to be aimed at a specific target. Because of that limitation, they were used with the intent of killing random civilians from afar and inciting terror amongst the general population. The Menchiks were among a little over 6000 casualties during the almost half a year of bomb attacks. As the bomb destroyed the Menchik family&#x27;s home, most of the records of Vera&#x27;s life were also lost in the attack, including game records, her writings, and her trophies. One of the few surviving awards was a damaged gold medal Menchik had received to honour her then twelve-year reign as world champion in 1939.

==Results==
===Hastings Congress===
Menchik was an annual participant in the Hastings Christmas Congress, which comprised different-level round-robin sections, for most of her career.


===Women&#x27;s World Championship tournaments===
Menchik played seven Women&#x27;s World Championship tournaments, winning all of them.


===Matches with Graf===
Menchik won two matches against Sonja Graf, the second of which in 1937 was a FIDE-sanctioned match for the Women&#x27;s World Championship.

==Notable games==
===Menchik vs. Euwe, Hastings 1931/32===

Vera Menchik – Max Euwe, 1931/32 Hastings International Christmas Congress: Round 2; Slav Defence, . Menchik defeated Euwe at the Hastings tournament for the second year in a row. Some of the annotations of the game from the August 1944 edition of &quot;Chess&quot; magazine, a few of which are attributed to chess journalist W. Ritson Morry (WRM), are included below.
:&quot;1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6&quot; (&quot;Probably no player had more experience with the Slav than Euwe who played both sides of it in no less than 19 world championship games. Despite being played by many top players it is rare for the second player to gain an advantage with it against strong competition.&quot;) &quot;3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.a4 Bf5 6.e3 Na6 7.Bxc4 Nb4 8.0-0 e6 9.Ne5 Bd6 10.Qe2 c5&quot; (&quot;A rare blunder for a future world champion.

In addition to the passed pawn, White has trapped Black&#x27;s rook.&quot;) &quot;42... Kf6 43.Ba6 g4 44.Bc4 Rxd2 45.Kxd2 gxf3 46.Nc5 Kxf5 47.Bxf7 Bd8 48.Be6+ Kf6 49.Bg4 Nd5 50.Bxf3 Nxb4 51.Be4 Be7 52.Nd3 Na2 53.Rc6+ Kg5 54.Rg6+ Kh4 55.Nxe5 Nc3 56.Kd3 1–0&quot;

===Khan vs. Menchik, Hastings 1931/32===

Mir Sultan Khan – Vera Menchik, 1931/32 Hastings International Christmas Congress: Round 6; Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, . W. Ritson Morry regarded the encounter as &quot;a masterly game&quot; in his annotations for &quot;British Chess Magazine&quot; when it was played. Some of his annotations for the game are included below.
: &quot;1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 d5 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Nf3&quot; (&quot;The omission of 5. Bg5 and the subsequent shutting in of the queen&#x27;s bishop by e3 only helps Black to obtain a good position, but Sultan Khan never studied the openings very profoundly, preferring to rely on his natural gift for middle-game complications.&quot;) &quot;5... c6 6.Qc2 Bd6 7.e3 Nbd7 8.Bd3 0-0 9.Bd2 Re8 10.h4&quot; (&quot;With this move White embarks upon a risky attempt to attack the Black king which is strategically completely unjustifiable.&quot;) &quot;Nf8&quot; (&quot;A good move making safe the kingside.

The game was in fact lost in any case.&quot;) &quot;30... cxd4 31.Bd3 Rb8 32.Ka1 Rb4 33.Rhe1 Be6 34.Re5 a3 35.b3 Rxb3 36.Bc4 Rb2 37.Bxe6 fxe6 38.Ra5 d3 39.Rxa3 d2 40.Rd1 Rc2 0–1&quot;

===Menchik vs. Graf, Semmering 1937===

Vera Menchik – Sonja Graf, 1937 Women&#x27;s World Championship match: Game 14; Semi-Slav Defense, . The last of Menchik&#x27;s nine wins against Graf in their 1937 match, this game is noted for Menchik&#x27;s final move, a brilliant tactic offering to sacrifice a rook with the threat of sacrificing the queen for a forced checkmate. Robert Tanner, the author of a biography on Menchik, provides annotations for the game, some of which are included below.
: &quot;1.c4 e6 2.Nc3 d5 3.d4 Nf6 4.Nf3 Nbd7 5.e3 c6 6.Bd3 Be7 7.0-0 0-0 8.e4 dxe4 9.Nxe4 Nxe4 10.Bxe4 Nf6 11.Bc2 c5 12.dxc5 Qa5 13.Be3 Bxc5 14.Bd2 Qc7 15.Bc3 Be7 16.Qe2 b6 17.Ng5 g6 18.Qf3 Bb7 19.Qh3 h5 20.Rad1 Ng4 21.Rd7&quot; (&quot;The point is 21. Qxh5 fails due to 21. Qxh2+ and the material evaporates. In the game, if 21... Qxd7 22. Qxh5! with mate on h7 or h8 using the bishop or queen as necessary. If 21... Qc6 White plays 22. Rxe7 and threatens 23. Rxb7, renewing the threat. In the face of one of the pretttiest combinations ever, Black resigned.&quot;) &quot;1–0&quot;

<text>Karl Wilhelm Gottlob Kastner (31 October 1783 – 13 July 1857) was a German chemist, natural scientist and a professor of physics and chemistry.

==Biography==
Kastner received his doctorate in 1805 under the guidance of Johann Göttling and began lecturing at the University of Jena. He moved on to become professor at the University of Halle in 1812. In 1818 he relocated to the University of Bonn, where he would mentor famous chemist Justus Liebig. He then moved on to the University of Erlangen in the summer of 1821, where he would remain for the rest of his professional life.

Karl Wilhelm Gottlob Kastner was born in Greifenberg in Pommern as the son of Johann Friedrich Gottlob Kastner, who was teacher and headmaster at the school of Greifenberg and a Protestant pastor. After his father had been displaced to Swinemünde, Kastner started his vocational education at a pharmacy in 1798. Three years later, he travelled to Berlin, to work as assistant of a pharmacist and to visit lectures at the University of Berlin. In 1802 Kastner became an assistant of professor Bourgnet’s lectures of experimental physics and experimental chemistry. In 1804 he began studying natural sciences at the University of Jena. During his studies he already lectured chemistry. Kastner received his doctorate in 1805 under the guidance of Johann Göttling and began lecturing at the University of Jena. In the same year he moved on to the University of Heidelberg to lecture physics and chemistry. He became professor at the University of Halle in 1812. In 1812 to 1813 he interrupted his teaching activities to make voluntary military service as supervisor and doctor of four hospitals. In 1818 he relocated to the University of Bonn. There he became elected dean of the philosophical faculty. In 1821 he moved on again, partly for political reasons, to the University of Erlangen, where he remained for the remainder of his professional life. There he also lectured physics and chemistry. Liebig, who had come to Bonn to study with Kastner, followed him to Erlangen and received his doctorate in 1822. Kastner also helped Liebig receive a grant from Ludwig I, the Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt, to study under Gay-Lussac in Paris.

Many of Kastner&#x27;s academic positions required not only the teaching of chemistry, but also mathematics, zoology, physics, mineralogy, geology, and pharmacy.

Kastner is best known today as the teacher of chemist Justus von Liebig.

<text>The Petawawa River is a river in the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin in Nipissing District and Renfrew County in eastern and northeastern Ontario, Canada. The river flows from Algonquin Provincial Park to the Ottawa River at the town of Petawawa, and is only one of two major tributaries of the Ottawa River to flow completely freely (the other being the Dumoine River). The river&#x27;s name comes from the Algonquian for &quot;where one hears a noise like this&quot;, which refers to its many rapids.

==Course==
The river starts at Ralph Bice Lake (formerly Butt Lake) in northern Algonquin Provincial Park in the geographic township of Butt in the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District. It flows south to Daisy Lake then east to Big Trout Lake. The river heads north out the lake over Big Trout Lake Dam, takes in the left tributary Tim River, flows over the Portal Rapids, Cedar Rapids, Snowshoe Rapids, Catfish Rapids, and Stacks Rapids to reach Cedar Lake, the location of the community of Brent, where it takes in the left tributary Nipissing River. The river exits the lake over a dam, heads through the Devil&#x27;s Chute, reaches Radiant Lake, where it takes in the left tributary North River and right tributary Little Madawaska River, and passes through the Squirrel Rapids, Big Sawyer Rapids, Battery Rapids Cascade Rapids and White Horse Rapids, and takes in the right tributary Crow River. The river then continues through a series of rapids including the Devil&#x27;s Cellar Rapids, passes the Algonquin Radio Observatory, and reaches Lake Travers. The Petawawa River enters a canyon and passes through numerous rapids including the Big Thompson Rapids, Little Thompson Rapids, Grillade Rapids, Crooked Chute, Rollway Rapids, The Natch, Schooner Rapids, Five Mile Rapids to arrive at Whitson Lake adjacent to the Petawawa Hills. It leaves Algonquin Provincial Park and enters the municipality of Laurentian Hills in Renfrew County, continues southeast past CFB Petawawa, passes through the Crooked Rapids, Race Horse Rapids, White Horse Rapids and Halfmile Rapids, and reaches Lac du Bois Dur, where it takes in the right tributary Barron River. The river enters the town of Petawawa, heads under Ontario Highway 17, through the Big Eddy Rapids, under the Canadian Pacific Railway main line, and empties into Black Bay on the Ottawa River.

The river is in length and drains an area of , with a mean discharge of per second.

==Economy==
From the late 19th century until the 1960s, the river was used for log driving of the timber from the forested areas surrounding the river. The river is visited by canoeing and kayaking enthusiasts - both for its white water rapids and its views.

In 2009, based on subsidized power-generation rates in the Ontario Green Energy Act&#x27;s Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) program, there were plans to build a 5.3 MW hydro-electric generating station at Big Eddy Rapids, about upstream from the river&#x27;s mouth. The project involved building a concrete and boulder weir that would direct a portion of the water to a new long intake channel and powerhouse, as well as a fish ladder. It was scheduled to be operational by 2015, but the project raised opposition from the local communities, paddlers, and environmental groups. Both Big Eddy Rapids and Half Mile Rapids would have been affected.

The project was among nineteen FIT hydro projects on ten rivers that were cancelled in 2015 after their FIT contracts were terminated following the opposition by groups like the Ontario Rivers Alliance.

==Geology==
Part of the Petawawa River lies in the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben, a 175 million year old rift valley.

<text>Miguel José Ferrer (February 7, 1955 – January 19, 2017) was an American actor. His breakthrough role was as Bob Morton in the 1987 film &quot;RoboCop&quot;. Other film roles include Harbinger in &quot;Hot Shots! Part Deux&quot; (1993), Quigley in &quot;Blank Check&quot;, Eduardo Ruiz in &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000) and Vice President Rodriguez in &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; (2013). Ferrer&#x27;s notable television roles include FBI Agent Albert Rosenfield on &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–1991, 2017), Dr. Garret Macy on &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; (2001–2007) and NCIS Assistant Director Owen Granger on &quot;&quot; (2012–2017).

Ferrer also performed voice acting in animated projects, including Shan Yu in &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998), Tarakudo on &quot;Jackie Chan Adventures&quot; (2000–2005), and Vandal Savage in &quot;Young Justice&quot; (2010–2012).

==Early life==
Ferrer was born on February 7, 1955, in Santa Monica, California. He was the oldest of five children born to Puerto Rican actor José Ferrer and American singer Rosemary Clooney.

Ferrer&#x27;s siblings were sisters Maria and Monsita, and brothers Gabriel (later the husband of singer Debby Boone) and actor Rafael. He also had an older half-sister, Letty (Leticia) Ferrer, from his father José&#x27;s prior marriage to Uta Hagen. Ferrer was a cousin of actor George Clooney and nephew of journalist Nick Clooney.

Ferrer was raised in Hollywood and Beverly Hills and attended Beverly Hills High School. As a teenager, his interests tended toward music; he played the drums on Keith Moon&#x27;s &quot;Two Sides of the Moon&quot;. After high school, Ferrer studied acting at the Beverly Hills Playhouse.

==Career==
Ferrer&#x27;s friend Bill Mumy cast him as a drummer in the series &quot;Sunshine&quot;, his first television role. Ferrer was also Mumy&#x27;s bandmate in Seduction of the Innocent, a band that also consisted of Steve Leialoha, and Max Allan Collins. Sharing a love of comics Ferrer and Mumy co-created Comet Man and Trypto the Acid Dog plus co-wrote the Marvel Graphic Novel &quot;The Dreamwalker&quot;.

Ferrer began his acting career in the early 1980s, making guest appearances on episodic television. He played the younger version of his father&#x27;s character on &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; in 1981. In 1983, he was given a small part as a waiter in &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot;. He also had a minor role in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984) as the &quot;U.S.S. Excelsior&quot; first officer. In 1984, he directed the Mark Medoff play “When Ya Coming Back, Red Ryder?” at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami, Florida. He had a major role in the 1987 action film &quot;RoboCop&quot; as the corporate executive Bob Morton, the young, ambitious executive of Omni Consumer Products&#x27; Security Concepts and project leader of the RoboCop program.

Ferrer&#x27;s notable later roles include a sinister biker in &quot;Valentino Returns,&quot; an overzealous engineer in &quot;DeepStar Six&quot; (1989), a resourceful vigilante in &quot;Revenge&quot; (1990), Commander Arvid Harbinger in the comedy &quot;Hot Shots! Part Deux&quot; (1993), Lloyd Henreid in the Stephen King miniseries &quot;The Stand&quot; (1994), and a drug informant in &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000). He occasionally took on lead parts as well, such as &quot;The Harvest&quot; and &quot;The Night Flier.&quot;

In the early 1990s, Ferrer appeared on three primetime TV series simultaneously: as D.A. Todd Spurrier in &quot;Shannon&#x27;s Deal&quot; (1989–1991), as Cajun cop Beau Jack Bowman in &quot;Broken Badges&quot; (1990–1991), and as cynical, wittily abrasive FBI forensics specialist Albert Rosenfield in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–91). Ferrer reprised the role of Rosenfield in the film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992). Ferrer played a super-villain called &quot;The Weatherman&quot; in the failed 1997 TV pilot, &quot;Justice League of America&quot;. Later in the same year, he provided the voice for a similar character, the Weather Wizard, in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Speed Demons&quot;. In 1999, Ferrer voiced Aquaman in another &quot;Superman: Animated&quot; episode, &quot;A Fish Story.&quot; The same year, at the 41st Grammy Awards, Ferrer was nominated for &quot;Best Spoken Word Album for Children&quot; in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King II&quot;, &quot;Simba&#x27;s Pride Read-Along.&quot; He was also the protagonist of the American rock band Toto&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;I Will Remember&quot;, appearing alongside actor Edward James Olmos.

Ferrer again played a medical examiner on the small screen, Dr. Garret Macy, in the television crime/drama series &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; (2001–07). In August 2003, Ferrer made his New York stage debut in the off-Broadway production of &quot;The Exonerated&quot;. In 2004, Ferrer performed as the voice of the Heretic leader in the video game &quot;Halo 2&quot;. Ferrer took voice-over roles in the TV series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; (2006) and &quot;American Dad!&quot; (2007). He played Jonas Bledsoe on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Bionic Woman&quot; series and in 2009 also starred in another NBC series, &quot;Kings,&quot; as a military commander of Gath.

Ferrer played Los Angeles Police Lieutenant Felix Valdez in the 2011 Lifetime police procedural drama, &quot;The Protector&quot;. Also, in 2011, he had a multiple-episode guest role on the final season of &quot;Desperate Housewives.&quot; Signed to a recurring role in &quot;&quot; as Naval Criminal Investigative Service Assistant Director Owen Granger, Ferrer was promoted to a series regular for the fifth season on February 6, 2013. He also appeared in the 2013 film &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; as the Vice President. Ferrer reprised his role of Albert Rosenfield in the 2017 revival of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

==Death ==
On January 19, 2017, Ferrer died at his Santa Monica home from heart failure and complications of throat cancer at the age of 61. At the time of his death, Ferrer was married to producer Lori Weintraub. He had two sons and two stepsons.

==Legacy==
Miguel O&#x27;Hara, the alter ego of the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man 2099, was named after Ferrer by his friend, writer Peter David, who co-created the character.

The seventh episode of &quot;Young Justice: Outsiders&quot; was dedicated to him. Ferrer had voiced the character Vandal Savage in the first two seasons of &quot;Young Justice&quot;. As a result of his death, David Kaye took over Ferrer&#x27;s role as Savage as well as his role as Jonathan Rook/Stretch Monster in &quot;Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters&quot;.

<text>The Horeke basalts is a disused formation that contained Miocene-Pliocene basalt lava flows that covered a large area in central Northland Region of New Zealand, and in places forms a high plateau around Okaihau.

Wairere Boulders is a nature park providing walkways through boulders of basalt, derived by erosion of one of these older basalt flows that used to be included in the Horeke Basalt and are now included in the Kerikeri Volcanic Group.

== Origin ==
The boulders in the Wairere valley are the erosional remnants of a lava flow out of a volcano near Lake Ōmāpere (near Kaikohe) that has been dated as approximately 2.8 million years old. There are two dates for these Horeke basalts: one at 2.84 and the other at 2.67 million years. There is a slight difference in chemistry in the two rocks that have been dated suggesting that the eruption took the form of several flows that once blanketed the high ground to the east of Horeke.

== Formation ==

Erosion of the clay underlay of the basalt plateau (cap) started to create a v-valley. The edges of the cap broke off. These blocks travelled downwards along the hill sides towards the bottom of the valley, where they accumulated. They fill now a portion of the valley which is about 1.4 km long and up to 350 m wide.

== Surface erosion ==

Some of the channels discovered in the basalt are 1000 mm deep and up to 300 mm wide, which is highly unusual for basalts. It is the result of chemical by acidic seepage from the humus on top of the boulders.

<text>Lamport Hall in Lamport, Northamptonshire is a fine example of a Grade I listed building. It was developed from a Tudor manor but is now notable for its classical frontage. The Hall contains an outstanding collection of books, paintings and furniture. The building includes The High Room with a magnificent ceiling by William Smith. It also has a library with 16th-century volumes and an early 19th-century cabinet room with Neapolitan cabinets which depict mythological paintings on glass. It is open to the public.

Lamport Hall was the home of the Isham family from 1560 to 1976. Sir Charles Isham, 10th Baronet is credited with beginning the tradition of garden gnomes in the United Kingdom when he introduced a number of terracotta figures from Germany in the 1840s.

==History==

In 1568 John Isham, a wealthy wool merchant, built a manor house on the Lamport Estate. His grandson, also named John, became the first baronet in 1627 during the reign of Charles I. He extended the house considerably. However, the only remains of this structure is a section of the present stable wing.

It was Sir Justinian Isham who built the main existing building. In 1655 he commissioned John Webb, a pupil of Inigo Jones, to design a large two-story home. The next major additions were to the south-west front and the north. These were completed in 1741. The gates on the main road date from 1824 and were designed by Henry Hakewill

In 1842 further major rebuilding of the south east front was completed, and later Sir Charles Isham commissioned the building of a new façade with porch to the north-west front, which is now the distinctive main entrance to the Hall. This was completed in 1862. The tower was built about the same time.

By about 1950 the house had considerably deteriorated, and the then owner Sir Gyles Isham undertook major renovation works and allowed the ground floor to be opened to the public in 1974. When he died in 1976 he left the building and its contents to the Lamport Hall Preservation Trust, who care for the Hall and Gardens today.

In 2021 the trust caused controversy by advertising for musicians to perform for no fee at a dining event in the garden, although they did offer the musicians a hamper for performing. The hall trust released an official apology, explaining it was meant as a showcase for amateur musicians.

==Sir Charles Isham==
Charles Isham inherited Lamport Hall at about the age of 26 in 1846 when his elder brother Justinian died. He had a particular interest in gardening and his garden featured in many of the journals of that day. Of particular interest to many of the journalists was the rockery which still exists today. Some of the descriptions of this feature were as follows.

In 1872 the &quot;Journal of Horticulture, Cottage Gardener and Country Gentleman&quot; made the following comment.

In 1897 the &quot;Gardeners Chronicle&quot; said

This rockery was particularly noted for the gnomes that it housed. The magazine called &quot;The Garden&quot; contained the following description of them.

Photos of the rockery and gnomes are shown in the gallery below.

One of the gnomes in this remarkable rockery survives and is on view at Lamport Hall today. A photo of the replica of this gnome is shown below.

==The Library==

In 1867 a number of rare volumes of Elizabethan prose and poetry were found in an attic. The story of the discovery was told on its centenary in the words of bookseller, Charles Edmond who observed the discovery would &quot;warm the heart of the most cold-blooded bibliomaniac.&quot; These included first editions of John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and &quot;Paradise Regained.&quot; bound in sheepskin.

==In popular culture==
Lamport Hall was used to depict Clarence House in the Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot;. The exterior was also used to double for the stables at Windsor Castle.

<doc id="970745" wikidata="Q1807570" url="?curid=970745" title="Alan Kalter">
<text>Alan Robert Kalter (March 21, 1943 – October 4, 2021) was an American television announcer from New York City. He is best known as the announcer for the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, a role he held from September 4, 1995, until Letterman&#x27;s retirement on May 20, 2015. He also hosted &quot;Alan Kalter&#x27;s Celebrity Interview&quot; that ran concurrently with &quot;The Late Show&quot;.

==Career==
Kalter, nicknamed &quot;Big Red&quot; and &quot;TV&#x27;s Uncle Jerry&quot; by Letterman, began his stint as the &quot;voice&quot; of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on September 4, 1995, replacing the retiring Bill Wendell. He announced the guests at the top of each show and the one-liner during the Worldwide Pants title card after the credits and regularly acted in comedic sketches.

Kalter did hundreds of voiceovers for national radio and television commercials and was also the lead continuity voice for the USA Network throughout much of the 1980s and most of the 1990s (his voice was still heard on USA into the mid-2010s for the network&#x27;s paid programming disclaimer, until a universal disclaimer for all NBCUniversal Cable Networks was instituted in 2017). He voiced promos for SportsChannel America in the early 1990s.

Kalter (credited as Alan Roberts) also filmed two game show pilots for CBS - &quot;The Challengers&quot; by Ron Greenberg Productions/Universal Television in April 1974, and &quot;The Finish Line&quot; by Bob Stewart Productions in October 1975. Both pilots went unsold.

Previously, he had been the announcer for many New York-based television shows, including &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot;, &quot;The Money Maze&quot;, and &quot;The $128,000 Question&quot;.

All of those series (except &quot;The Money Maze&quot;) were taped at some point in the Ed Sullivan Theater, where the &quot;Late Show&quot; is now produced. Additionally, episodes of &quot;Truth&quot; announced by Kalter were taped in NBC Studio 6A, where Letterman later originated &quot;Late Night&quot;. Kalter would replace Bill Wendell as announcer on both &quot;Truth&quot; and the &quot;Late Show&quot;. Kalter was also the announcer for the 45th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, held in New York in 2003.

===&quot;Late Show&quot;===
On the &quot;Late Show,&quot; Kalter regularly performed in scripted comedy bits in addition to his announcing duties. He was often portrayed alternately as a sexual deviant (often while grinning mischievously), a powerless sap who was beaten to within an inch of his life and left rolling on the ground writhing in pain, or frustrated at having guests for his own interview segment stolen by host David Letterman. He was also often compelled to arbitrarily sing, rant in hysteria, or disrobe as he walked offstage. In many of the sketches, Kalter&#x27;s antics left host Letterman in a state of shock, amusement, disgust, or total confusion. A memorable series of sketches in the early 2000s saw Kalter reenacting movie scenes originally performed by Fred MacMurray.

==Personal life==
Kalter was born in Brooklyn in 1943 and raised in Little Neck and Cedarhurst, New York. His family was Jewish. He was an English and Public Speaking teacher at Baldwin High School on Long Island in the late 1960s and was also the voice of the Michelin Man. He attended Hobart College in Geneva, New York, and began his broadcasting career on local radio stations.

Kalter lived in Stamford, Connecticut. He married Carol Cepler and they had two children, Lauren Hass and Diana Binger. After his longtime marriage to Carol Cepler ended in divorce, he married his second wife Peggy Masterson in 2003. He had five grandchildren. 

Kalter died at Stamford Hospital on October 4, 2021, aged 78.

<text>LinkedIn () is a business and employment-focused online professional platform that works through websites and mobile apps. It was launched on May 5, 2003 by Reid Hoffman and Eric Ly. Since December 2016, LinkedIn has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft. The platform is primarily used for professional networking and career development, and allows jobseekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs. From 2015, most of the company&#x27;s revenue came from selling access to information about its members to recruiters and sales professionals and has also introduced their own ad portal named LinkedIn Ads to let companies advertise in their platform. LinkedIn has more than 1 billion registered members from over 200 countries and territories.

LinkedIn allows members (both employees and employers) to create profiles and connect with each other in an online social network which may represent real-world professional relationships. Members can invite anyone (whether an existing member or not) to become a connection. LinkedIn can also be used to organize offline events, join groups, write articles, publish job postings, post photos and videos, and more.

== Company overview ==
Founded in Mountain View, California, LinkedIn is currently headquartered in Mountain View, with 36 global offices as of February 11, 2024. In February 2024, the company had around 18,500 employees.

LinkedIn&#x27;s current CEO is Ryan Roslansky. Jeff Weiner, previously CEO of LinkedIn, is now serving as the Executive Chairman. Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, is chairman of the board. It was funded by Sequoia Capital, Greylock, Bain Capital Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and the European Founders Fund. LinkedIn reached profitability in March 2006. Since January 2011, the company had received a total of $103 million (about $ in ) of investment. LinkedIn filed for an initial public offering in January 2011 and traded its first shares in May, under the NYSE symbol &quot;LNKD&quot;.

== History ==
=== Founding from 2002 to 2011 ===

The company was founded in December 2002 by Reid Hoffman and the founding team members from PayPal and Socialnet.com (Allen Blue, Eric Ly, Jean-Luc Vaillant, Lee Hower, Konstantin Guericke, Stephen Beitzel, David Eves, Ian McNish, Yan Pujante, Chris Saccheri). In late 2003, Sequoia Capital led the Series A investment in the company. In August 2004, LinkedIn reached 1 million users. In March 2006, LinkedIn achieved its first month of profitability. In April 2007, LinkedIn reached 10 million users. In February 2008, LinkedIn launched a mobile version of the site.

In June 2008, Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners, and other venture capital firms purchased a 5% stake in the company for $53 million, giving the company a post-money valuation of approximately $1 billion. In November 2009, LinkedIn opened its office in Mumbai and soon thereafter in Sydney, as it started its Asia-Pacific team expansion. In 2010, LinkedIn opened an International Headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, received a $20 million investment from Tiger Global Management LLC at a valuation of approximately $2 billion, announced its first acquisition, Mspoke, and improved its 1% premium subscription ratio. In October of that year, Silicon Valley Insider ranked the company No. 10 on its Top 100 List of most valuable startups. By December, the company was valued at $1.575 billion in private markets. LinkedIn started its India operations in 2009 and a major part of the first year was dedicated to understanding professionals in India and educating members to leverage LinkedIn for career development.

=== 2011 to present ===

LinkedIn filed for an initial public offering in January 2011. The company traded its first shares on May 19, 2011, under the NYSE symbol &quot;LNKD&quot;, at $45 (~$ in ) per share. Shares of LinkedIn rose as much as 171% on their first day of trade on the New York Stock Exchange and closed at $94.25, more than 109% above IPO price. Shortly after the IPO, the site&#x27;s underlying infrastructure was revised to allow accelerated revision-release cycles. In 2011, LinkedIn earned $154.6 million in advertising revenue alone, surpassing Twitter, which earned $139.5 million. LinkedIn&#x27;s fourth-quarter 2011, earnings soared because of the company&#x27;s increase in success in the social media world. By this point, LinkedIn had about 2,100 full-time employees compared to the 500 that it had in 2010.

In April 2014, LinkedIn announced that it had leased 222 Second Street, a 26-story building under construction in San Francisco&#x27;s SoMa district, to accommodate up to 2,500 of its employees, with the lease covering 10 years. The goal was to join all San Francisco-based staff (1,250 as of January 2016) in one building, bringing sales and marketing employees together with the research and development team. In March 2016 they started to move in. In February 2016 following an earnings report, LinkedIn&#x27;s shares dropped 43.6% within a single day, down to $108.38 per share. LinkedIn lost $10 billion of its market capitalization that day.

In 2016, access to LinkedIn was blocked by Russian authorities for non-compliance with the 2015 national legislation that requires social media networks to store citizens&#x27; personal data on servers located in Russia.

In June 2016, Microsoft announced that it would acquire LinkedIn for $196 a share, a total value of $26.2 billion. It was the largest acquisition made by Microsoft, until the acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2022. The acquisition would be an all-cash, debt-financed transaction. Microsoft would allow LinkedIn to &quot;retain its distinct brand, culture and independence&quot;, with Weiner to remain as CEO, who would then report to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Analysts believed Microsoft saw the opportunity to integrate LinkedIn with its Office product suite to help better integrate the professional network system with its products. The deal was completed on December 8, 2016.

In late 2016, LinkedIn announced a planned increase of 200 new positions in its Dublin office, which would bring the total employee count to 1,200. Since 2017 94% of B2B marketers use LinkedIn to distribute content.

Soon after LinkedIn&#x27;s acquisition by Microsoft, LinkedIn&#x27;s new desktop version was introduced. The new version was meant to make the user experience similar across mobile and desktop. Some changes were made according to the feedback received from the previously launched mobile app. Features that were not heavily used were removed. For example, the contact tagging and filtering features are not supported anymore.

Following the launch of the new user interface (UI), some users complained about the missing features which were there in the older version, slowness, and bugs in it. The issues were faced by free and premium users and with both the desktop and mobile versions of the site.

In 2019, LinkedIn launched globally the feature Open for Business that enables freelancers to be discovered on the platform. LinkedIn Events was launched in the same year.

In June 2020, Jeff Weiner stepped down as CEO and become executive chairman after 11 years in the role. Ryan Roslansky stepped up as CEO from his previous position as the senior vice president of product. In late July 2020, LinkedIn announced it laid off 960 employees, about 6 percent of the total workforce, from the talent acquisition and global sales teams. In an email to all employees, CEO Ryan Roslansky said the cuts were due to effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic.
In April 2021, CyberNews claimed that 500 million LinkedIn&#x27;s accounts have leaked online. However, LinkedIn stated that &quot;We have investigated an alleged set of LinkedIn data that has been posted for sale and have determined that it is actually an aggregation of data from a number of websites and companies&quot;.

In June 2021, PrivacySharks claimed that more than 700 million LinkedIn records were on sale on a hacker forum. LinkedIn later stated that this is not a breach, but scraped data which is also a violation of their Terms of Service.

Microsoft ended LinkedIn operations in China in October 2021.

In 2022, LinkedIn earned $13.8 billion in revenue, compared to $10.3 billion in 2021.

In May 2023, LinkedIn cut 716 positions from its 20,000 workforce. The move, according to a letter from the company&#x27;s CEO Ryan Roslansky, was made to streamline the business&#x27;s operations. Roslansky further stated that this decision would result in the creation of 250 job opportunities. Additionally, LinkedIn also announced the discontinuance of its China local job apps.

In June 2024, Axios reported LinkedIn was testing a new AI assistant for its paid Premium users.

In September 2024, LinkedIn suspended its use of UK user data for AI model training after concerns were raised by the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO). The platform had quietly opted in users globally for data use in AI training. However, following ICO feedback, LinkedIn paused this practice for UK users. A company spokesperson stated that LinkedIn has always allowed users to control how their data is used and has now provided UK users with an opt-out option.

In November 2024, Linkedin challenged Australian legislation which sought to ban under-16&#x27;s from social media platforms on the grounds that it does &#x27;not have content interesting and appealing to minors.&#x27;

In July 2012, LinkedIn acquired 15 key Digg patents for $4 million including a &quot;click a button to vote up a story&quot; patent.

=== Perkins lawsuit ===
In 2013, a class action lawsuit entitled &quot;Perkins vs. LinkedIn Corp&quot; was filed against the company, accusing it of automatically sending invitations to contacts in a member&#x27;s email address book without permission. The court agreed with LinkedIn that permission had in fact been given for invitations to be sent, but not for the two further reminder emails. LinkedIn settled the lawsuit in 2015 for $13 million (~$ in ). Many members should have received a notice in their email with the subject line &quot;Legal Notice of Settlement of Class Action&quot;. The Case No. is 13-CV-04303-LHK.

=== &quot;hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn&quot; ===
In May 2017, LinkedIn sent a Cease-And-Desist letter to hiQ Labs, a Silicon Valley startup that collects data from public profiles and provides analysis of this data to its customers. The letter demanded that hiQ immediately cease &quot;scraping&quot; data from LinkedIn&#x27;s servers, claiming violations of the CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) and the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act). In response hiQ sued LinkedIn in the Northern District of California in San Francisco, asking the court to prohibit LinkedIn from blocking its access to public profiles while the court considered the merits of its request. The court served a preliminary injunction against LinkedIn, which was then forced to allow hiQ to continue to collect public data. LinkedIn appealed this ruling; in September 2019, the appeals court rejected LinkedIn&#x27;s arguments and the preliminary injunction was upheld. The dispute is ongoing.

== Membership ==

In 2015, LinkedIn had more than 400 million members in over 200 countries and territories, which was significantly more than competitor Viadeo (50 million as of 2013.) In 2011, its membership grew by approximately two new members every second. In 2020, LinkedIn&#x27;s membership grew to over 690 million LinkedIn members. As of September 2021, LinkedIn had 774+ million registered members from over 200 countries and territories. In November 2023, LinkedIn reached a member count of one billion.

== Platform and features ==

=== User profile network ===
====Basic functionality====

The basic functionality of LinkedIn allows users to create profiles, which for employees typically consist of a curriculum vitae describing their work experience, education and training, skills, and a personal photo. Employers can list jobs and search for potential candidates. Users can find jobs, people and business opportunities recommended by someone in one&#x27;s contact network. Users can save jobs that they would like to apply for. Users also have the ability to follow different companies.

The site also enables members to make &quot;connections&quot; to each other in an online social network which may represent real-world professional relationships. Members can invite anyone to become a connection. Users can obtain introductions to the connections of connections (termed &quot;second-degree connections&quot;) and connections of second-degree connections (termed &quot;third-degree connections&quot;).

A member&#x27;s list of connections can be used in a number of ways. For example, users can search for second-degree connections who work at a company they are interested in, and then ask a specific first-degree connection in common for an introduction. The &quot;gated-access approach&quot; (where contact with any professional requires either an existing relationship, or the intervention of a contact of theirs) is intended to build trust among the service&#x27;s users. LinkedIn participated in the EU&#x27;s International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.

Users can interact with each other in a variety of ways:
* Connections can interact by choosing to &quot;like&quot; posts and &quot;congratulate&quot; others on updates such as birthdays, anniversaries and new positions, as well as by direct messaging.
* Users can share video with text and filters with the introduction of LinkedIn Video.
* Users can write posts and articles within the LinkedIn platform to share with their network.

Since September 2012, LinkedIn has enabled users to &quot;endorse&quot; each other&#x27;s skills. However, there is no way of flagging anything other than positive content. LinkedIn solicits endorsements using algorithms that generate skills members might have. Members cannot opt out of such solicitations, with the result that it sometimes appears that a member is soliciting an endorsement for a non-existent skill.

=== Applications ===
LinkedIn &#x27;applications&#x27; often refer to external third-party applications that interact with LinkedIn&#x27;s developer API. However, in some cases, it could refer to sanctioned applications featured on a user&#x27;s profile page.

==== External, third party applications ====
In February 2015, LinkedIn released an updated terms of use for their developer API. The developer API allows both companies and individuals the ability to interact with LinkedIn&#x27;s data through creation of managed third-party applications. Applications must go through a review process and request permission from the user before accessing a user&#x27;s data.

Normal use of the API is outlined in LinkedIn&#x27;s developer documents, including:
* Sign into external services using LinkedIn
* Add items or attributes to a user profile
* Share items or articles to user&#x27;s timeline

==== Embedded in profile ====
In October 2008, LinkedIn enabled an &quot;applications platform&quot; which allows external online services to be embedded within a member&#x27;s profile page. Among the initial applications were an Amazon Reading List that allows LinkedIn members to display books they are reading, a connection to Tripit, and a Six Apart, WordPress and TypePad application that allows members to display their latest blog postings within their LinkedIn profile. In November 2010, LinkedIn allowed businesses to list products and services on company profile pages; it also permitted LinkedIn members to &quot;recommend&quot; products and services and write reviews. Shortly after, some of the external services were no longer supported, including Amazon&#x27;s Reading List.

=== Mobile ===
A mobile version of the site was launched in February 2008 and made available in six languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese and Spanish. In January 2011, LinkedIn acquired CardMunch, a mobile app maker that scans business cards and converts into contacts. In June 2013, CardMunch was noted as an available LinkedIn app. In October 2013, LinkedIn announced a service for iPhone users called &quot;Intro&quot;, which inserts a thumbnail of a person&#x27;s LinkedIn profile in correspondence with that person when reading mail messages in the native iOS Mail program. This is accomplished by re-routing all emails from and to the iPhone through LinkedIn servers, which security firm Bishop Fox asserts has serious privacy implications, violates many organizations&#x27; security policies, and resembles a man-in-the-middle attack.

=== Groups ===
LinkedIn also supports daily the formation of interest groups. In 2012, there were 1,248,019 such groups whose membership varies from 1 to 744,662. Groups support a limited form of discussion area, moderated by the group owners and managers. Groups may be private, accessible to members only or may be open to Internet users in general to read, though they must join in order to post messages. Since groups offer the functionality to reach a wide audience without so easily falling foul of anti-spam solutions, there is a constant stream of spam postings, and there now exists a range of firms who offer a spamming service for this very purpose. LinkedIn has devised a few mechanisms to reduce the volume of spam, but recently decided to remove the ability of group owners to inspect the email address of new members in order to determine if they were spammers. Groups also keep their members informed through emails with updates to the group, including most talked about discussions within your professional circles.

In December 2011, LinkedIn announced that they are rolling out polls to groups. In November 2013, LinkedIn announced the addition of Showcase Pages to the platform. In 2014, LinkedIn announced they were going to be removing Product and Services Pages paving the way for a greater focus on Showcase Pages.

=== Knowledge graph ===
LinkedIn maintains an internal knowledge graph of entities (people, organizations, groups) that helps it connect everyone working in a field or at an organization or network. This can be used to query the neighborhood around each entity to find updates that might be related to it.
This also lets them train machine learning models that can infer new properties about an entity or further information that may apply to it for both summary views and analytics.

=== Discontinued features ===
In January 2013, LinkedIn dropped support for LinkedIn Answers and cited a new &#x27;focus on development of new and more engaging ways to share and discuss professional topics across LinkedIn&#x27; as the reason for the retirement of the feature. The feature had been launched in 2007 and allowed users to post questions to their network and allowed users to rank answers.

In 2014, LinkedIn retired InMaps, a feature which allowed you to visualize your professional network. The feature had been in use since January 2011.

According to the company&#x27;s website, LinkedIn Referrals will no longer be available after May 2018.

In September 2021, LinkedIn discontinued LinkedIn stories, a feature that was rolled out worldwide in October 2020.

== Usage ==

===Personal branding===
LinkedIn is particularly well-suited for personal branding, which, according to Sandra Long, entails &quot;actively managing one&#x27;s image and unique value&quot; to position oneself for career opportunities. LinkedIn has evolved from being a mere platform for job searchers into a social network which allows users a chance to create a personal brand. Career coach Pamela Green describes a personal brand as the &quot;emotional experience you want people to have as a result of interacting with you,&quot; and a LinkedIn profile is an aspect of that. A contrasting report suggests that a personal brand is &quot;a public-facing persona, exhibited on LinkedIn, Twitter and other networks, that showcases expertise and fosters new connections.&quot;

LinkedIn allows professionals to build exposure for their brand within the site itself and on the World Wide Web as a whole. With a tool that LinkedIn dubs a &quot;Profile Strength Meter&quot;, the site encourages users to offer enough information in their profile to optimize visibility by search engines. It can strengthen a user&#x27;s LinkedIn presence if they belong to professional groups on the site. The site enables users to add a video to their profiles. Some users hire a professional photographer for their profile photo. Video presentations can be added to one&#x27;s profile. LinkedIn&#x27;s capabilities have been expanding so rapidly that a cottage industry of outside consultants has grown up to help users navigate the system. A particular emphasis is helping users with their LinkedIn profiles.

In October 2012, LinkedIn launched the LinkedIn Influencers program, which features global thought leaders who share their professional insights with LinkedIn&#x27;s members. As of May 2016, there are 750+ Influencers. The program is invite-only and features leaders from a range of industries, including Richard Branson, Narendra Modi, Arianna Huffington, Greg McKeown, Rahm Emanuel, Jamie Dimon, Martha Stewart, Deepak Chopra, Jack Welch, and Bill Gates.

===Job seeking===
Job seekers and employers widely use LinkedIn. According to Jack Meyer, the site has become the &quot;premier digital platform&quot; for professionals to network online. In Australia, which has approximately twelve million working professionals, ten million of them are on LinkedIn, according to Anastasia Santoreneos, suggesting that the probability was high that one&#x27;s &quot;future employer is probably on the site.&quot; According to one estimate based on worldwide figures, 122 million users got job interviews via LinkedIn and 35 million were hired by a LinkedIn online connection.

LinkedIn also allows users to research companies, non-profit organizations, and governments they may be interested in working for. Typing the name of a company or organization in the search box causes pop-up data about the company or organization to appear. Such data may include the ratio of female to male employees, the percentage of the most common titles/positions held within the company, the location of the company&#x27;s headquarters and offices, and a list of present and former employees. In July 2011, LinkedIn launched a new feature allowing companies to include an &quot;Apply with LinkedIn&quot; button on job listing pages. The new plugin allowed potential employees to apply for positions using their LinkedIn profiles as resumes.

LinkedIn can help small businesses connect with customers. In the site&#x27;s parlance, two users have a &quot;first-degree connection&quot; when one accepts an invitation from another. People connected to each of them are &quot;second-degree connections&quot; and persons connected to the second-degree connections are &quot;third-degree connections.&quot; This forms a user&#x27;s internal LinkedIn network, making the user&#x27;s profile more likely to appear in searches.

LinkedIn&#x27;s Profinder is a marketplace where freelancers can (for a monthly subscription fee) bid for project proposals submitted by individuals and small businesses. In 2017, it had around 60,000 freelancers in more than 140 service areas, such as headshot photography, bookkeeping or tax filing.

The premise for connecting with someone has shifted significantly in recent years. Before the 2017 new interface was launched, LinkedIn encouraged connections between people who&#x27;d already worked, studied, done business, or the like. Since 2017, that step has been removed from the connection request process - and users are allowed to connect with up to 30,000 people. This change means LinkedIn is a more proactive networking site for job applicants trying to secure a career move or for salespeople wanting to generate new client leads.

=== Top Companies ===
LinkedIn Top Companies is a series of lists published by LinkedIn, identifying companies in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, and the United Kingdom that are attracting the most intense interest from job candidates. The 2019 lists identified Google&#x27;s parent company, Alphabet, as the most sought-after U.S. company, with Facebook ranked second and Amazon ranked third. The lists are based on more than one billion actions by LinkedIn members worldwide. The Top Companies lists were started in 2016 and are published annually. The 2021 top list identified Amazon as the top company, with Alphabet ranked second and JPMorgan &amp; Chase Co. ranked third.

=== Top Voices and other rankings ===
Since 2015, LinkedIn has published annual rankings of Top Voices on the platform, recognizing &quot;members that generated the most engagement and interaction with their posts.&quot; The 2020 lists included 14 industry categories, ranging from data science to sports, as well as 14 country lists, extending from Australia to Italy.

LinkedIn also publishes data-driven annual rankings of the Top Startups in more than a dozen countries, based on &quot;employment growth, job interest from potential candidates, engagement, and attraction of top talent.&quot;

=== Advertising and for-pay research ===
In 2008, LinkedIn launched LinkedIn DirectAds as a form of sponsored advertising. In October 2008, LinkedIn revealed plans to open its social network of 30 million professionals globally as a potential sample for business-to-business research. It is testing a potential social network revenue model – research that, to some, appears more promising than advertising. On July 23, 2013, LinkedIn announced its Sponsored Updates ad service. Individuals and companies can now pay a fee to have LinkedIn sponsor their content and spread it to their user base. This is a common way for social media sites such as LinkedIn to generate revenue.

LinkedIn launched its carousel ads feature in 2018, making it the newest addition to the platform&#x27;s advertising options. With carousel ads, businesses can showcase their products or services through a series of swipeable cards, each with its unique image, headline, and description. They can be used for various marketing objectives, such as promoting a new product launch, driving website traffic, generating leads, or building brand awareness.

=== Business Manager ===
LinkedIn today announced the creation of Business Manager. The new Business Manager is a centralized platform designed to make it easier for large companies and agencies to manage people, ad accounts, and business pages.

=== Publishing platform ===
In 2015, LinkedIn added an analytics tool to its publishing platform. The tool allows authors to better track the traffic that their posts receive. In relation to this functionality, LinkedIn has gained more users over the years in the interest of clearly monitoring users&#x27; posts through post-performance analytics

== Future plans ==
=== Economic graph ===
Inspired by Facebook&#x27;s &quot;social graph&quot;, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner set a goal in 2012 to create an &quot;economic graph&quot; within a decade. The goal was to create a comprehensive digital map of the world economy and the connections within it. The economic graph was to be built on the company&#x27;s current platform with data nodes including companies, jobs, skills, volunteer opportunities, educational institutions, and content. They have been hoping to include all the job listings in the world, all the skills required to get those jobs, all the professionals who could fill them, and all the companies (nonprofit and for-profit) at which they work. The ultimate goal is to make the world economy and job market more efficient through increased transparency. In June 2014, the company announced its &quot;Galene&quot; search architecture to give users access to the economic graph&#x27;s data with more thorough filtering of data, via user searches like &quot;Engineers with Hadoop experience in Brazil.&quot;

LinkedIn has published blog posts using economic graph data to research several topics on the job market, including popular destination cities of recent college graduates, areas with high concentrations of technology skills, and common career transitions. LinkedIn provided the City of New York with data from economic graph showing &quot;in-demand&quot; tech skills for the city&#x27;s &quot;Tech Talent Pipeline&quot; project.

== Role in networking ==
LinkedIn has been described by online trade publication &quot;TechRepublic&quot; as having &quot;become the de facto tool for professional networking&quot;. LinkedIn has also been praised for its usefulness in fostering business relationships. &quot;LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today&quot;, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;. LinkedIn has inspired the creation of specialised professional networking opportunities, such as co-founder Eddie Lou&#x27;s Chicago startup, Shiftgig (released in 2012 as a platform for hourly workers).

== Criticism and controversies ==

=== Controversial design choices ===

==== Endorsement feature ====
The feature that allows LinkedIn members to &quot;endorse&quot; each other&#x27;s skills and experience has been criticized as meaningless, since the endorsements are not necessarily accurate or given by people who have familiarity with the member&#x27;s skills. In October 2016, LinkedIn acknowledged that it &quot;really does matter who endorsed you&quot; and began highlighting endorsements from &quot;coworkers and other mutual connections&quot; to address the criticism.

==== Use of e-mail accounts of members for spam sending ====
LinkedIn sends &quot;invite emails&quot; to Outlook contacts from its members&#x27; email accounts, without obtaining their consent. The &quot;invitations&quot; give the impression that the e-mail holder themself has sent the invitation. If there is no response, the answer will be repeated several times (&quot;You have not yet answered XY&#x27;s invitation.&quot;) LinkedIn was sued in the United States on charges of hijacking e-mail accounts and spamming. The company argued with the right to freedom of expression. In addition, the users concerned would be supported in building a network.

The sign-up process includes users entering their email password (there is an opt-out feature). LinkedIn will then offer to send out contact invitations to all members in that address book or that the user has had email conversations with. When the member&#x27;s email address book is opened, it is opened with all email addresses selected, and the member is advised invitations will be sent to &quot;selected&quot; email addresses, or to all. LinkedIn was sued for sending out another two follow-up invitations to each contact from members to link to friends who had ignored the initial, authorized invitation.

In November 2014, LinkedIn lost a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, in a ruling that the invitations were advertisements not broadly protected by free speech rights that would otherwise permit use of people&#x27;s names and images without authorization. The lawsuit was eventually settled in 2015 in favor of LinkedIn members.

==== Moving emails to LinkedIn servers ====
At the end of 2013 it was announced that the LinkedIn app intercepted users&#x27; emails and quietly moved them to LinkedIn servers for full access. LinkedIn used man-in-the-middle attacks.

=== Security incidents ===

==== 2012 hack ====

In June 2012, cryptographic hashes of approximately 6.4 million LinkedIn user passwords were stolen by Yevgeniy Nikulin and other hackers who then published the stolen hashes online. This action is known as the 2012 LinkedIn hack. In response to the incident, LinkedIn asked its users to change their passwords. Security experts criticized LinkedIn for not salting their password file and for using a single iteration of SHA-1. On May 31, 2013, LinkedIn added two-factor authentication, an important security enhancement for preventing hackers from gaining access to accounts. In May 2016, 117 million LinkedIn usernames and passwords were offered for sale online for the equivalent of $2,200 (~$ in ). These account details are believed to be sourced from the original 2012 LinkedIn hack, in which the number of user IDs stolen had been underestimated. To handle the large volume of emails sent to its users every day with notifications for messages, profile views, important happenings in their network, and other things, LinkedIn uses the Momentum email platform from Message Systems.

==== 2021 breaches ====
A breach disclosed in April 2021 affected 500 million users. A breach disclosed in June 2021 was thought to have affected 92% of users, exposing contact information, employment information. LinkedIn asserted that the data was aggregated via web scraping from LinkedIn as well as several other sites, and noted that &quot;only information that people listed publicly in their profiles&quot; was included.

=== Malicious behavior on LinkedIn ===

==== Phishing ====
In what is known as Operation Socialist, documents released by Edward Snowden in the 2013 global surveillance disclosures revealed that British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) (an intelligence and security organisation) infiltrated the Belgian telecommunications network Belgacom by luring employees to a false LinkedIn page.

In 2014, Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) discovered that Threat Group-2889, an Iran-based group, created 25 fake LinkedIn accounts. The accounts were either fully developed personas or supporting personas. They use spearphishing and malicious websites against their victims.

According to reporting by &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, France&#x27;s General Directorate for Internal Security and Directorate-General for External Security believe that Chinese spies have used LinkedIn to target thousands of business and government officials as potential sources of information.

In 2017, Germany&#x27;s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) published information alleging that Chinese intelligence services had created fake social media profiles on sites such as LinkedIn, using them to gather information on German politicians and government officials.

In 2022, the company ranked first in a list of brands most likely to be imitated in phishing attempts.

In August 2023, several Linkedin users were targeted by hackers in hijacking and phishing bid. Users were locked out of their accounts and threatened with permanent account deletion if they did not pay a ransom.

==== False and misleading information ====
LinkedIn has come under scrutiny for its handling of misinformation and disinformation. The platform has struggled to deal with fake profiles and falsehoods about COVID-19 and the 2020 US presidential election.

=== Policies ===

==== Privacy policy ====
The German Stiftung Warentest has criticized that the balance of rights between users and LinkedIn is disproportionate, restricting users&#x27; rights excessively while granting the company far-reaching rights. It has also been claimed that LinkedIn does not respond to consumer protection center requests.

===Research on labor market effects===

In 2010, &quot;Social Science Computer Review&quot; published research by economists Ralf Caers and Vanessa Castelyns who sent an online questionnaire to 398 and 353 LinkedIn and Facebook users respectively in Belgium and found that both sites had become tools for recruiting job applicants for professional occupations as well as additional information about applicants, and that it was being used by recruiters to decide which applicants would receive interviews. In May 2017, &quot;Research Policy&quot; published an analysis of PhD holders use of LinkedIn and found that PhD holders who move into industry were more likely to have LinkedIn accounts and to have larger networks of LinkedIn connections, were more likely to use LinkedIn if they had co-authors abroad, and to have wider networks if they moved abroad after obtaining their PhD.

Also in 2017, sociologist Ofer Sharone conducted interviews with unemployed workers to research the effects of LinkedIn and Facebook as labor market intermediaries and found that social networking services (SNS) have had a filtration effect that has little to do with evaluations of merit, and that the SNS filtration effect has exerted new pressures on workers to manage their careers to conform to the logic of the SNS filtration effect. In October 2018, Foster School of Business professors Melissa Rhee, Elina Hwang, and Yong Tan performed an empirical analysis of whether the common professional networking tactic by job seekers of creating LinkedIn connections with professionals who work at a target company or in a target field is actually instrumental in obtaining referrals and found instead that job seekers were less likely to be referred by employees who were employed by the target company or in the target field due to job similarity and self-protection from competition. Rhee, Hwang, and Tan further found that referring employees in higher hierarchical positions than the job candidates were more likely to provide referrals and that gender homophily did not reduce the competition self-protection effect.

In July 2019, sociologists Steve McDonald, Amanda K. Damarin, Jenelle Lawhorne, and Annika Wilcox performed qualitative interviews with 61 human resources recruiters in two metropolitan areas in the Southern United States and found that recruiters filling low- and general-skilled positions typically posted advertisements on online job boards while recruiters filling high-skilled or supervisor positions targeted passive candidates on LinkedIn (i.e. employed workers not actively seeking work but possibly willing to change positions), and concluded that this is resulting in a bifurcated winner-takes-all job market with recruiters focusing their efforts on poaching already employed high-skilled workers while active job seekers are relegated to hyper-competitive online job boards. In December 2001, the &quot;ACM SIGGROUP Bulletin&quot; published a study on the use of mobile phones by blue-collar workers that noted that research about tools for blue-collar workers to find work in the digital age was strangely absent and expressed concern that the absence of such research could lead to technology design choices that would concentrate greater power in the hands of managers rather than workers.

In a September 2019 working paper, economists Laurel Wheeler, Robert Garlick, and RTI International scholars Eric Johnson, Patrick Shaw, and Marissa Gargano ran a randomized evaluation of training job seekers in South Africa to use LinkedIn as part of job readiness programs. The evaluation found that the training increased the job seekers employment by approximately 10 percent by reducing information frictions between job seekers and prospective employers, that the training had this effect for approximately 12 months, and that while the training may also have facilitated referrals, it did not reduce job search costs and the jobs for the treatment and control groups in the evaluation had equal probabilities of retention, promotion, and obtaining a permanent contract. In 2020, &quot;Applied Economics&quot; published research by economists Steffen Brenner, Sezen Aksin Sivrikaya, and Joachim Schwalbach using LinkedIn demonstrating that high status individuals self-select into professional networking services rather than workers unsatisfied with their career status adversely selecting into the services to receive networking benefits.

== International restrictions ==
In February 2011, it was reported that LinkedIn was being blocked in China after calls for a &quot;Jasmine Revolution&quot;. It was speculated to have been blocked because it is an easy way for dissidents to access Twitter, which had been blocked previously. After a day of being blocked, LinkedIn access was restored in China.

In February 2014, LinkedIn launched its Simplified Chinese language version named &quot;&quot; (), officially extending their service in China. LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner acknowledged in a blog post that they would have to censor some of the content that users post on its website in order to comply with Chinese rules, but he also said the benefits of providing its online service to people in China outweighed those concerns. Since Autumn 2017 job postings from western countries for China aren&#x27;t possible anymore.

In 2016, a Moscow court ruled that LinkedIn must be blocked in Russia for violating a data retention law which requires the user data of Russian citizens to be stored on servers within the country. The relevant law had been in force there since 2014. This ban was upheld on November 10, 2016, and all Russian ISPs began blocking LinkedIn thereafter. LinkedIn&#x27;s mobile app was also banned from Google Play Store and iOS App Store in Russia in January 2017. In July 2021 it was also blocked in Kazakhstan.

In October 2021, after reports of several academicians and reporters who received notifications regarding their profiles will be blocked in China, Microsoft confirmed that LinkedIn will be shutting down in China and replaced with InJobs, a China exclusive app, citing difficulties in operating environments and increasing compliance requirements. In May 2023, LinkedIn announced that it would be phasing out the app by 9 August 2023.

==Account banning==
Without giving its users any prior notice, Linkedin has been removing accounts that do not follow its criteria since 2022.

== Open-source contributions ==
Since 2010, LinkedIn has contributed several internal technologies, tools, and software products to the open source domain. Notable among these projects is Apache Kafka, which was built and open sourced at LinkedIn in 2011.

== Research using data from the platform ==
Massive amounts of data from LinkedIn allow scientists and machine learning researchers to extract insights and build product features. For example, this data can help to shape patterns of deception in resumes. Findings suggested that people commonly lie about their hobbies rather than their work experience on online resumes.

<text>[[Ecoregion]]s in [[Australia]] are geographically distinct plant and animal communities, defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature based on geology, soils, climate, and predominant vegetation.

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) identified 825 terrestrial ecoregions that cover the Earth&#x27;s land surface, 40 of which cover Australia and its dependent islands. The WWF ecoregions are classified by biome type (tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, tundra, etc.), and into one of eight terrestrial realms. Australia, together with New Zealand, New Guinea and neighboring island groups, is part of the Australasian realm. The IBRA bioregions informed the delineation of the WWF ecoregions for Australia, and the WWF ecoregions generally follow the same ecoregion boundaries, while often clustering two or more similar bioregions into a larger ecoregion. The ecoregion articles in Wikipedia generally follow the WWF scheme.

The WWF ecoregions are based heavily upon the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) regionalisation. Like the IBRA, it was developed for use as a planning tool for conservation science, with the goal of establishing a system of nature reserves in each of the ecoregions or bioregions sufficient to preserve biodiversity. Both systems also have a prioritization system for establishing preserves; the WWF designated its Global 200 ecoregions as priorities for conservation, and the Department of Environment and Heritage ranks its bioregions high, medium, or low priority, based on &quot;the potential value land reservation in those regions would add to the development of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system for Australia.&quot;

===WWF terrestrial ecoregions and IBRA bioregions===
This table shows which IBRA bioregions correspond to which WWF ecoregions.

==WWF freshwater ecoregions==
The WWF published Freshwater Ecoregions of the World, a global map of freshwater ecoregions. The WWF team identified ten freshwater ecoregions for Australia and Tasmania. A major habitat type, or biome, was identified for each ecoregion. The four major habitat types present in Australia are tropical and subtropical coastal rivers, temperate coastal rivers, temperate floodplain rivers and wetlands, 
and xeric freshwaters and endorheic (closed) basins. The Australian freshwater ecoregions were adapted from the freshwater fish biogeographic provinces identified by Peter Unmack and G.R. Allen, S.H. Midgley, and M. Allen, who were also part of the WWF team. The freshwater fish provinces &quot;were derived through similarity analyses, parsimony analysis, and drainage-based plots of species ranges&quot;.

<text>Dhammayuttika Nikāya (Pali; ; ; , ), or Dhammayut Order (), is an order of Theravada Buddhist &quot;bhikkhus&quot; (monks) in Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma, with significant branches in the Western world. Its name is derived from Pali &quot;dhamma&quot; (&quot;teachings of the Buddha&quot;) + &quot;yutti&quot; (in accordance with) + &quot;ka&quot; (group).

The order began in Thailand as a reform movement led by a prince who would later become King Mongkut of Siam, before also spreading to Cambodia and Burma. Initially, King Mongkut was frustrated because he could not find monks who understood the original teachings of the Buddha and truly adhered to the rules of the monks. This happened because of the syncretism of Buddhism with Thai folk religion. Consequently, King Mongkut emphasized the use of the Pali Canon as the primary authority for monastic practices, and sought to eliminate all of the syncretic elements. The movement became formally recognized as its own monastic order by the Thai government in 1902, with any Thai Theravada &quot;bhikkhus&quot; not within the order being referred to as part of the Maha Nikaya order.

The Dhammayuttika Nikaya plays a significant political role in Thailand. The order has historically been favored by the Thai government and monarchy, with the order holding the majority of all royal monastic titles in Thailand and most of the Supreme Patriarchs (the head of the Thai monastic community) since its founding having come from the Dhammayuttika Nikaya, despite the order making up less than ten percent of all &quot;bhikkhus&quot; in Thailand.

== History ==
Dhammayuttika Nikaya (Thai: &quot;Thammayut&quot;) began in 1833 as a reform movement led by Mongkut (later King Rama IV), son of King Rama II of Siam. It remained a reform movement until passage of the Sangha Act of 1902, which formally recognized it as the lesser of Thailand&#x27;s two Theravada denominations, the other being Maha Nikaya.

Prince Mongkut was a &quot;bhikkhu&quot; (religious name: Vajirañāṇo) for 27 years (1824–1851) before becoming King of Thailand (1851–1868). The then 20 year-old prince entered monastic life in 1824. Over the course of his early meditation training, Mongkut was frustrated that his teachers could not relate the meditation techniques they were teaching to the original teachings of the Buddha. Also, he described what he saw as serious discrepancies between the vinaya (monastic rules) and the actual practices of Thai &quot;bhikkhus&quot;. Mongkut, concerned that the ordination lines in Thailand were broken by a lack of adherence to this monastic code, sought out a different lineage of &quot;bhikkhus&quot; with practice that is more in line with the &quot;vinaya&quot;.

There are several rules in the Theravada monastic code by which a &quot;bhikkhu&quot; is &quot;defeated&quot; - he is no longer a &quot;bhikkhu&quot; even if he continues to wear robes and is treated as one. Every ordination ceremony in Theravada Buddhism is performed by ten &quot;bhikkhus&quot; to guard against the possibility of the ordination being rendered invalid by having a &quot;defeated &quot;bhikkhu&quot;&quot; as preceptor. Despite this, Mongkut was concerned that the area&#x27;s lineages of regional traditions were broken. He made every effort to commission a phalanx of &quot;bhikkhus&quot; in Thailand with the highest probability of an unbroken lineage traceable back to the Buddha.

Mongkut eventually found a lineage among the Mon people in Thailand who had a stronger practice. He reordained in this group and began a reform movement that would become the Thammayut order. In founding the Thammayut order, Mongkut made an effort to remove all non-Buddhist, folk religious, and superstitious elements which over the years had become part of Thai Buddhism. He emphasized the use of the Pali Canon as the primary authority as the basis for monastic practices. Additionally, Thammayut &quot;bhikkhus&quot; are expected to eat only one meal a day (not two) and the meal was to be gathered during a traditional alms round.

In 1836, Mongkut became the first abbot of the new Wat Bowonniwet Vihara, and it would become the administrative center of the Thammayut order to the present day.

Soon after, Mongkut had other &quot;bhikkhus&quot; who were close to him reordain in this lineage of Mon &quot;bhikkhus&quot;. Among these were Mongkut&#x27;s son Vajirañāṇavarorasa and Somdet Phra Wannarat &quot;Thap&quot;, a grade nine Pali scholar.

According to anthropologist Jim Taylor, Vajirañāṇavarorasa&#x27;s autobiography tells how &quot;Thap had differences with the somewhat more &quot;worldly&quot; &quot;bhikkhus&quot; at Wat Bowornniwet, which led to dissension and the movement&#x27;s eventual division into four primary competing factions (monastic lines or &quot;stems&quot;).&quot; In the mid-19th century these branches became so estranged that each one developed its own style of chanting, interpretation, and translation of Pali texts, and differed on issues related to the monastic code.

It wasn&#x27;t until Vajirañāṇavarorasa took control of a new phase of sangha reforms in 1892 that the administrative Thammayut hierarchy would begin to form a cohesive vision. Officially Pusso Saa was the sangharaja; however, he was only a figurehead. Thanissaro, a Thai-ordained forest &quot;bhikkhu&quot;, notes though that in the early-20th century, Ajahn Mun&#x27;s kammaṭṭhāna lineage formed a distinct camp within the Thammayut order which was at odds with Vajirañāṇavarorasa&#x27;s reforms.

== Political role in Thailand ==
While the Dhammayuttika Nikaya originally started as a Buddhist reform movement in Thailand, later leading to the development of the Thai forest tradition, the order has played a significant political role in Thailand as well.

Since its origins, the Dhammayuttika Nikaya has historically been the preferred choice of the Thai government and the monarchy. Having been started by a Thai prince, the order has always had close ties to the monarchy and has historically played a key role in ensuring public support for the palace. Journalist Paul Handley writes that:Although the doctrinal differences between the schools had become less significant, putting Thammayut on top ensured that the sangha remained closely allied with the palace. This favoritism by Thai elites for the Dhammayuttika order is most apparent in the proportion of monastic titles given to senior &quot;bhikkhus&quot;. While taking up only about six percent of the &quot;bhikkhus&quot; in Thailand, over half of Thailand&#x27;s monastic titles and privileges have gone to Dhammayuttika &quot;bhikkhus&quot;, and nine of the past thirteen Supreme Patriarchs of Thailand have belonged to the Dhammayuttika order.

The preference by the Thai government and palace for Dhammayuttika has even led to the persecution of some high ranking Maha Nikaya &quot;bhikkhus&quot; who were seen as a threat to the Dhammayuttika hierarchy or the Thai government. The most famous case was the case of Phra Phimontham, a high ranking Maha Nikaya &quot;bhikkhu&quot; known for his pro-democracy views and opposition to Dhammayuttika elitism, who was likely to become the next Supreme Patriarch of Thailand at the time. In 1962, Phra Phimontham was imprisoned and defrocked by Thailand&#x27;s then military junta and widely defamed in the Thai media over several criminal charges. The scandal allowed the military junta to pass a Sangha reform act that further centralized the Thai Sangha&#x27;s administration under Dhammayuttika control. Following a change in government, the various criminal charges against Phra Phimontham were later determined to have been false all along. In reality, the military junta persecuted Phra Phimontham for his political views and disseminated the false charges in the media in order to arrest him and limit his influence, and to consolidate its power over the Sangha.

More recently, news analysts have described the actions of the 2014 military junta against Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Wat Paknam Bhasichareon as also being about the politics of these two Nikayas. From 2013-2017 the &quot;bhikkhu&quot; who was next in line for Supreme Patriarch was the Maha Nikaya &quot;bhikkhu&quot; Somdet Chuang Varapuñño of Wat Paknam Bhasicheroen. However, lawsuits involving Somdet Chuang and the affiliated Wat Phra Dhammakaya caused his appointment to be postponed and eventually withdrawn, with another candidate from the Dhammayuttika fraternity appointed instead. The lawsuits against Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Somdet Chuang were, in fact, eventually used as reasons by the junta to withdraw his nomination. Wat Paknam was later cleared of all charges two days after Somdet Chuang&#x27;s nomination was officially withdrawn.

On 7 February 2017, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha confirmed the appointment of Somdet Phra Maha Muniwong as the 20th Supreme Patriarch of Thailand in a televised address. He was the abbott of Wat Ratchabophit and a leading member of the Dhammayuttika Nikaya order. The prime minister stated: &quot;I submitted the names of five qualified monks for His Majesty to consider. On Monday night, I was informed His Majesty chose Somdet Phra Maha Muniwong.&quot;

During the 2017–18 Thai temple fraud investigations, Anthropologist Jim Taylor described the arrests made during the investigations as the &quot;ruling palace regime&quot; trying to consolidate traditional, central royalist power by eliminating several high-ranking Maha Nikaya &quot;bhikkhus&quot; and members of the Sangha Supreme Council. Taylor argues that this was done in order to ensure that the next supreme patriarch is also from the Dhammayuttika Nikaya, pointing to the junta&#x27;s previous interference with the position in 2017 and that the suspects were all high-ranking non-royalist &quot;bhikkhus&quot;. In fact, in July 2018, the junta passed a law giving the Thai King the ability to select members of the Sangha Supreme Council instead of the monks. The alleged corruption within the Sangha from these investigations were cited as the reason for the change.

== International influences ==

=== Cambodia ===
In 1855, King Norodom of Cambodia invited Preah Saukonn Pan, also referred to as Maha Pan, a Khmer bhikkhu educated in the Dhammayuttika Nikaya, to establish a branch of the Dhammayuttika order in Cambodia. Maha Pan became the first Sangharaja of the Dhammayuttika lineage, residing at Wat Botum, a new temple erected by the king specifically for Dhammayuttika &quot;bhikkhus&quot;. The Cambodian order benefited from royal patronage but was also sometimes regarded with suspicion due to its ties to the Thai monarchy.

The Dhammayuttika order in Cambodia suffered greatly under the Khmer Rouge, being particularly targeted because of its perceived ties to monarchy and a foreign nation, in addition to the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s general repression of the Buddhist hierarchy in Cambodia. Between 1981 and 1991, the Dhammayuttika Nikaya was combined with the Cambodian Mohanikay in a unified sangha system established under Vietnamese domination. In 1991, King Norodom Sihanouk returned from exile and appointed the first new Dhammayuttika Sangharaja in ten years, effectively ending the policy of official unification. The Dhammayuttika continues to exist in Cambodia, though its &quot;bhikkhus&quot; constitute a very small minority. On issues such as the role of bhikkhu in HIV/AIDS treatment and education, the current Sangharaja, Bour Kry has adopted a more liberal position than the Mohanikay head Tep Vong, but is less radical than that of certain Engaged Buddhist elements of the Mohanikay order.

=== Burma ===
The Dhammayutti Nikaya Mahayin Gaing (; from &quot;group, association&quot;) has its origins as &quot;a late nineteenth-century Mon reform tradition [that] traces its lineage to the Thai Thammayut (sic) order.&quot; It is one of 9 legally sanctioned monastic orders (nikaya) in Myanmar (Burma), under the 1990 Law Concerning Sangha Organizations.

According to 2016 statistics published by the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, 823 monks belonged to this monastic order, representing 0.15% of all monks in the country, making it the second smallest legally-sanctioned monastic order. With respect to geographic representation, the majority of Mahayin monks are based in Mon State (76.91%), followed by neighboring Kayin State (13.61%).

=== Indonesia ===
On October 23, 1976, Saṅgha Theravāda Indonesia (&quot;Indonesian Theravāda Saṅgha&quot;) was formed at the Mahā Dhammaloka Vihāra (now Tanah Putih Vihāra), Semarang, Central Java. The Indonesian Theravāda Saṅgha was formed by monks who were not members of the Sangha that already existed in Indonesia at that time. The sangha organization was founded by five Indonesian monks who came from the ordination line of the Thai Dhammayuttika Nikāya order, Bhikkhu Aggabalo, Bhikkhu Khemasarano, Bhikkhu Sudhammo, Bhikkhu Khemiyo, and Bhikkhu Ñaṇavutto. The historic event was also witnessed by two Thai Dhammadutas, namely Bhante Suvirayan (now Phra Dhamchetiyachan) and Bhante Sombat Pavitto (now Phra Vidhurdhammabhorn) who were ordained at Wat Bowonniwet, that is the center of the Dhammayuttika order.

In addition, there is also the Sangha Theravāda Dhammayut Indonesia that shelters native Thai monks of the Dhammayuttika ordination line.

<text>Richard Selig Réti (28 May 1889 – 6 June 1929) was an Austro-Hungarian, later Czechoslovak, chess player, chess author, and composer of endgame studies.

He was one of the principal proponents of hypermodernism in chess. With the exception of Nimzowitsch&#x27;s book &quot;My System&quot;, he is considered to be the movement&#x27;s foremost literary contributor.

==Early life==
Réti was born to a Jewish family in Bazin, Austria-Hungary (now Pezinok, Slovakia), where his father worked as a physician in the service of the Austrian military.

His older brother Rudolph Reti (who did not use the acute accent) was a noted pianist, musical theorist, and composer. He is the great-grandfather of the German painter . Réti came to Vienna to study mathematics at Vienna University.

==Chess career==
One of the top players in the world during the 1910s and 1920s, he began his career as a combinative classical player, favoring openings such as the King&#x27;s Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.f4). After the end of the First World War, however, his playing style changed, and he became one of the principal proponents of hypermodernism, along with Aron Nimzowitsch and others. He had his greatest early successes in the period 1918 through 1921, in tournaments in Kaschau (Košice; 1918), Rotterdam (1919), Amsterdam (1920), Vienna (1920), and Gothenburg (1921). 

In 1925 Réti set a world record for blindfold chess with 29 games played simultaneously. He won 21, drew 6, and lost 2. 

Réti was also a notable composer of endgame studies.

==Death==
Réti died on 6 June 1929 in Prague of scarlet fever. His ashes are buried in the grave of Réti&#x27;s father, Dr. Samuel Réti, in the Jewish section of Zentralfriedhof cemetery in Vienna, in Section T1, Group 51, Row 5, Grave 34.

==Legacy==

The Réti Opening (1.Nf3 d5 2.c4) is named after him.

Réti defeated World Champion José Raúl Capablanca in the New York 1924 chess tournament in 31 moves – Capablanca&#x27;s first defeat in eight years, his only loss to Réti, and his first since becoming world champion. This tournament was also the only occasion in which Réti beat future world champion Alexander Alekhine, accomplishing this feat in the same number of moves.

Réti&#x27;s writings have become classics of chess literature. &quot;Modern Ideas in Chess&quot; (1923) and &quot;Masters of the Chess Board&quot; (1933) are studied today.

===Famous endgame study===
Réti composed one of the most famous chess studies, shown in this diagram. It was published in &quot;Ostrauer Morgenzeitung&quot; 4 December 1921. It seems impossible for the white king to catch the advanced black pawn, while the white pawn can be easily stopped by the black king. The idea of the solution is to move the king to advance on both pawns at the same time using specific properties of the chess geometry.

:1. Kg7 h4 2. Kf6 Kb6 
:Or 2...h3 3.Ke7 and the white king can support its own pawn.
:3. Ke5
:And now the white king comes just in time to the white pawn, or catches the black one.
:3... h3 4. Kd6 and draws.

<text>Longmen () is a town of 7000 in Fuyang District, Hangzhou, northwestern Zhejiang province, People&#x27;s Republic of China, located south of the center of Fuyang District. The town lies south of the Fuchun River, at the foothills of the Xianxia Range, and oversees 11 administrative villages. Over 90% of its people are surnamed Sun.

==Cultural history==

According to tradition, the Suns of Longmen are descendants of the third century warlord Sun Quan, who became emperor of the Three Kingdoms state of Wu. Sun Quan himself is said to have been born a short distance from Longmen, on an islet in the Fuchun River. A 1939 genealogy traces their lineage continuously back twenty six generations to a Song dynasty official. In the past, the Suns of Longmen were divided into ten sub-lineages and held joint grand ceremonies honouring their ancestors every spring and autumn, but this practice stopped after 1949.

Fifty years ago there were some sixty heritage buildings in Longmen, and about half of those are still standing today. Among them are ancestral halls, homes, pagodas and memorial arches - most of which have a history of over three hundred years. These structures are good examples of classical southern architecture and feature intricate wood carvings from Zhejiang folklore. The favourite decorative motifs used are from Three Kingdoms stories popular since the Song dynasty.
The local theatrical performances, called the &quot;Bamboo Horse Dance&quot; are unique for their portrayal of Sun Quan as a hero. In traditional Three Kingdoms folklore, Sun Quan is normally seen as an ambivalent and often frustrated leader who is time and again bested by Liu Bei and his cunning strategist Zhuge Liang. At Longmen, the favourite plays are &quot;Burning Red Cliffs&quot;, showing Sun Quan&#x27;s defeat of Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs and &quot;Burning the Linked Encampments&quot;, showing Sun Quan&#x27;s defeat of Liu Bei at the Battle of Yiling.

Curiously, the great revolutionary statesman Sun Yat-sen, born in southern Guangdong province, can trace his ancestry to Longmen. His ancestors moved from Zhejiang to Fujian and then finally to Guangdong. The Sun clan genealogy in his native Cuiheng bears the title &quot;Genealogical Register of the Sun Clan of Fuchun&quot;.

<doc id="970780" wikidata="Q832428" url="?curid=970780" title="Nimzowitsch Defence">
<text>The Nimzowitsch Defence (named after Aron Nimzowitsch) is a somewhat uncommon chess opening characterised by the moves:

:1. 

This opening is an example of a hypermodern opening in which Black invites White to occupy the of the board at an early stage with pawns. Black&#x27;s intent is to block or otherwise restrain White&#x27;s central pawns and, if allowed to do so by inaccurate play by White, eventually undermine the White pawn centre by well-timed pawn advances of their own or by attacking the white pieces defending the centre. World Champion Garry Kasparov and Grandmaster Raymond Keene wrote that it &quot;has never been fully accepted as a dependable opening. Nevertheless it is sound and offers the maverick spirit a great deal of foreign territory to explore.&quot;

The Nimzowitsch is included under code B00 in the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot;.
==Main line: 2.d4 ==
White takes the initiative in the centre. Black&#x27;s main continuations are 2...d5 or 2...e5.

===2...d5===
The line that Aron Nimzowitsch, the originator of the opening, usually preferred. Now White can choose among:
*3.e5, which Black usually meets with 3...Bf5, (although 3...f6 is also a decent, though more complex, variation) followed by playing ...e6 (which no longer locks in the ) and later attacking White&#x27;s central with moves such as ...f6 and ...c5. 
*3.exd5 Qxd5, followed by 4.Nf3, seeking to gain time by attacking the queen with Nc3, but enabling Black to put pressure on White&#x27;s centre with 4...Bg4 or 4...e5.
*3.Nc3 dxe4 (3...e6 leads to a type of French Defence) 4.d5 Ne5, when White usually continues with 5.Qd4 or 5.Bf4 Ng6 6.Bg3.

===2...e5===
A line favoured by the late British grandmaster Tony Miles. White can transpose to the Scotch Game with 3.Nf3, or play 3.d5 Nce7 (with the intentions of 4. -- Ng6 - Black Knight&#x27;s Tango) (3...Nb8, although perhaps not as bad as it looks, is considered inferior), which gives White only a slight plus score in practice. Another approach is 3.dxe5 Nxe5, when White can seek a quiet advantage with 4.Nf3 or play the more aggressive (but potentially weakening) thrust 4.f4.

==2.Nf3==
Shown by some databases to be the most common move, 2.Nf3 is often played by White players not eager for a theoretical battle on their opponent&#x27;s turf. 
*2...e5, transposing to a double king-pawn opening, may be the best move, but is unlikely to appeal to the hard-core Nimzowitsch player. 
*The sharp 2...f5, the Colorado Gambit, although somewhat dubious, was played with some success by the American International Master Doug Root, and more recently by the Finnish International Master Olli Salmensuu and others. It may lead to wild complications, e.g. 3.exf5 d5 4.Nh4 e5!? 5. Qh5+ g6 6.fxg6 Nf6 7.g7+ Nxh5 8.gxh8=Q Qxh4 9.Qxh7 Nd4, when White is an exchange up, but Black has a huge lead in and White&#x27;s king is in jeopardy. Naiditsch–Doettling, Dortmund 2000, ended in a draw after further complications: 10.Qg6+ Kd8 11.d3 Nf4! 12.Qf7 Bb4+ 13.c3 Bg4! 14.Qg8+ Kd7 15.Qg7+ Kc6 16.g3 Nf3+ 17.Kd1 Nd4+ 18.Kd2 Nf3+ 19.Kd1 Nd4+ . The British International Master Gary Lane advocates the more solid 4.d4 Bxf5 5.Bb5 (trying to control the weakened e5-square) Qd6 6.Ne5 Nf6 7.0-0 Nd7 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.Qf3! Nxe5 (or 9...e6 10.g4 Bg6 11.Nxg6 hxg6 12.Bf4 Qb4 13.Qd3) 10.Qxf5 Nf7 11.Bf4 Qd7 12.Qxd7+ Kxd7 13.Nd2 when Black&#x27;s inferior pawn structure gave White a small advantage in Shaw–Salmensuu, European Team Championship, León 2001 (, 63).
*2...d6, the Williams Variation, is known to be a solid option for Black, but is less dynamic than the former options and can lead to an inferior version of the Pirc Defense. The main line continues 3.d4 Bg4, but 3...Nf6 is completely . The line usually continues 4.Bb5 a6 5.Bxc6+, leading to a fairly equal position, but a sharper try for white is 4.d5 Ne5 5.Nxe5!?, the Keene Attack, named after Raymond Keene, who played it in a 1964 game against E. Fielder. While this attack sacrifices the queen, White can gain it back after 5...Bxd1 6.Bb5+ c6 7.dxc6 Qa5+ 8.Nc3 0-0-0 9.Nc4 Qc7 10.Nd5.
*Other moves, including 2...e6, 2...Nf6, 2...d5, and 2...g6 are but tend to lead to inferior variations of, respectively, the French Defence, Alekhine&#x27;s Defence, Scandinavian Defense, or Robatsch Defence.
**After 2...Nf6 3.e5 Ng4?! is possible, invented by Spanish GM Marc Narciso Dublan, who called it &quot;El Columpio&quot; (&quot;The Swing&quot;). After 4.d4 d6 5.h3 Nh6 both the Exchange Variation (6.exd6) and the Pin Variation (6.Bb5) give White the edge. Worth exploring is the El Columpio Gambit (The Swing Gambit): 6.e6?!

<text>Emil Abderhalden (9 March 1877 – 5 August 1950) was a Swiss biochemist and physiologist. His main findings, though disputed already in the 1910s, were not finally rejected until the late 1990s. Whether his misleading findings were based on fraud or simply the result of a lack of scientific rigour remains unclear. Abderhalden&#x27;s drying pistol, used in chemistry, was first described by one of his students in a textbook Abderhalden edited.

==Biography==
Emil Abderhalden was born in Oberuzwil in the Canton of St. Gallen in Switzerland. He moved to Basel to study at the University of Basel.

During his time in Basel, he joined the rowing club and was a founding member of FC Basel. Eleven men attended the meeting of founding Fussball Club Basel on 15 November 1893. Abderhalden played his first game for the club in the home game in the Stadion Schützenmatte on 22 September 1894 as Basel won 2–0 against FC Gymnasia.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcb-achiv-fcb-gymnasia-1894/95&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Abderhalden left the club in January 1895.

Abderhalden studied medicine at the University of Basel and received his doctorate in 1902. He then studied in the laboratory of Emil Fischer and worked at the University of Berlin. In 1911 he moved to the University of Halle and taught physiology in the medical school. From 1931 to 1950, he was president of the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina. In 1936 he was appointed member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.

During World War I, he established a children&#x27;s hospital and organized the removal of malnourished children to Switzerland. Subsequently, he resumed his research into physiological chemistry and began to study metabolism and food chemistry.

After World War II, Abderhalden returned to Switzerland in 1945 and lectured physiological chemistry at the University of Zurich as the replacement of Bonifaz Flaschenträger, who had to leave due to his membership in the NSDAP. He died there at age 73. The minor planet 15262 Abderhalden was named in his honour.

== Scientific work and controversy ==
Abderhalden is known for a blood test for pregnancy, a test for cystine in urine, and for explaining the Abderhalden–Kaufmann–Lignac syndrome, a recessive genetic condition. He did extensive work in the analysis of proteins, polypeptides, and enzymes. His &quot;Abwehrfermente&quot; (&quot;defensive enzymes&quot;) theory stated that immunological challenge will induce the production of proteases. This was seemingly &quot;proven&quot; by many collaborators in Europe, although attempts to verify the theory abroad failed.

The pregnancy test was determined to be unreliable a few years after its inception. In late 1912 Abderhalden&#x27;s &quot;defensive ferments reaction test&quot; was applied to the differential diagnosis of dementia praecox from other mental diseases and from normals by Stuttgart psychiatrist August Fauser (1856–1938), and his miraculous claims of success were soon replicated by researchers in Germany and particularly in the United States. However, despite the worldwide publicity this &quot;blood test for madness&quot; generated, within a few years the &quot;Abderhalden–Fauser reaction&quot; was discredited and only a handful of American psychiatric researchers continued to believe in it. Certainly by 1920 the test was all but forgotten in the USA. Abderhalden&#x27;s reputation continued to grow in Germany, however, where collaborators managed to &quot;replicate&quot; his results, usually by simply repeating experiments until they succeeded and discarding the negative results. As Abderhalden was seen as the founder of scientific biochemistry in Germany, questioning his work could harm one&#x27;s career, as Leonor Michaelis, who had been a collaborator with Abderhalden, discovered when he reported inability to reproduce Abderhalden&#x27;s claims for his pregnancy test; by 1922, Michaelis&#x27;s situation in Germany was so tarnished that he had to leave the country to embark on an outstanding career of scientific success abroad. Otto Westphal described Abderhalden&#x27;s work in conversation with Ute Deichmann as follows:

Abderhalden&#x27;s work was strongly ideologically slanted: his theory was put to use for human experiments by Otmar von Verschuer and Josef Mengele to develop a blood test for separating &quot;Aryan&quot; from &quot;non-Aryan&quot; individuals. While Abderhalden himself did not take part in this work, evidence suggests that he was instrumental in ideologically streamlining the German Academy of Natural Scientists &quot;Leopoldina&quot; by having the Jewish members purged and replaced by Nazi sycophants.

In another research project of the KWI-A Berlin, Mengele worked officially in his role as a camp doctor at Auschwitz. Biochemist Emil Abderhalden had turned in 1940 to Verschuer, because he needed the blood of twins to check the &quot;Abderhalden reaction named after him&quot; on identical twins. Abderhalden asserted here, that certain reactions of the immune system are stimulated by the production of each specific protease. Due to the detection of such enzymes in the blood - Abderhalden called it &quot;Defensive enzymes&quot; - the detection of diseases such as mental illness or cancer through blood tests should be possible. Abderhalden also believed that racial characteristics were included in the proteins of the tissue and blood. These suggestions were taken up by Verschuer and developed into a research project on the inheritance of &quot;specific white type bodies&quot;, from which he obviously hoped, to be able to develop a blood test for the determination of the human race. In an interim report of the KWI-A at the German Research Foundation, which funded the project, Verschuer explained that his assistant was posted as a camp doctor in Auschwitz, Mengele, who was entered as an employee in this branch. &quot;With the permission of the Reichsführer-SS be conducted anthropological studies of the various racial groups in this concentration camp and sent the blood samples to my laboratory for processing.&quot; Also, the biochemist Günther Hillmann was included in the project, and was established as a specialist for protein research by the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biochemistry under Adolf Butenandt. Verschuer spoke in this context of 200 studied blood samples from family members of different &quot;races&quot; which substrates are made of.

Despite his theories being rejected as early as the mid-1910s, Abderhalden still loomed large as a kind of &quot;father figure&quot; in parts of the German scientific community and only by Deichmann and Müller-Hill&#x27;s scathing 1998 review, the entire extent of the rejection was revealed. However, in Abderhalden&#x27;s days, the science of immunology was all but non-existent. That his experiments indeed seemed to &quot;work&quot; on occasion was probably due to immunoprecipitation. The crucial difference between this and Abderhalden&#x27;s theory is that the former is an effect of antibodies, whereas the fictitious &quot;Abwehrfermente&quot; were presumed to be proteases; a difference that has large implications for biochemistry and immunology.

The most comprehensive analysis of the issue as to whether Abderhalden was simply grossly mistaken or perpetuated deliberate fraud can be found in Kaasch.

== Personal life ==
Emil Abderhalden had a son, Rudolf Abderhalden who also was a chemist and moved to Switzerland after World War II. His son found employment under Tadeusz Reichstein at the University of Basel. From 1946, he had requested for his German degree, (he was a lecturer at the University of Halle) to be acknowledged by Switzerland. But this request was only considered in 1949 after the successor for the chair for physiological chemistry was found. As a former member of the NSDAP in Germany, he was not permitted to pursue his career at the University. Rudolf Abderhalden then transferred to industry and opened a private laboratory.

<doc id="970792" wikidata="Q2356615" url="?curid=970792" title="The World Inside">
<text>The World Inside is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert Silverberg, published in 1971. The novel originally appeared as a series of shorter works in 1970 and 1971, all but one published in &quot;Galaxy&quot;, including the Hugo nominated novella &quot;The World Outside&quot;. &quot;The World Inside&quot; was nominated for a Hugo Award in 1972, although Silverberg declined the nomination.

On March 2, 2010, Orb Books published this title as a trade paperback edition.

==Plot introduction==
The novel is set on Earth in the year 2381, when the population of the planet has reached 75 billion people. Population growth has skyrocketed due to a quasi-religious belief in human reproduction as the highest possible good. Most of the action occurs in a massive three-kilometer-high city tower called &quot;Urban Monad 116&quot;.

==Plot summary==
War, starvation, crime and birth control have been eliminated. Life is now totally fulfilled and sustained within Urban Monads (Urbmons), mammoth thousand-floor skyscrapers arranged in &quot;constellations&quot;, where the shadow of one building does not fall upon another. An Urbmon is divided into 25 self-contained &quot;cities&quot; of 40 floors each, in ascending order of status, with administrators occupying the highest level. Each building can hold approximately 800,000 people, with excess population totalling three billion a year transferred to new Urbmons, which are continually under construction.

The Urbmon population is supported by the conversion of all of the Earth&#x27;s habitable land area not taken up by Urbmons to agriculture. The theoretical limit of the population supported by this arrangement is estimated to be 200 billion. The farmers live a very different lifestyle, with strict birth control. Farmers trade their produce for technology and the two societies rarely have direct contact; even their languages are mutually unintelligible.

The Urbmons are a world of total sexual license where men are expected to engage in &quot;nightwalking&quot;; it is considered very rude to refuse an invitation for sex. In this world it is a blessing to have children: most people are married at 12 and parents at 14. Just thinking of controlling families is considered a faux pas. Privacy has been dispensed with due to the limited area. Because the need to be outdoors and to travel has been eliminated, thoughts of wanderlust are considered perverse.

The dwellers of the Urban Monad share scant resources and believe that sharing of everything is required in order for people to peacefully coexist in close quarters. The sharing extends to wives and husbands.

Although great effort is spent to maintain a stable society, the Urban Monad lifestyle causes mental illness in a small percentage of people, and this fate befalls two of the book&#x27;s main characters. &quot;Moral engineers&quot; reprogram those who are approaching an unacceptable level of behavior.

Given the extremes of life in the Urban Monads, law enforcement and the concept of justice employ a zero tolerance policy. There are usually no trials, and punishment is swift; anyone who threatens the stability of the Urbmon society (a &quot;flippo&quot;) is &quot;erased&quot; by being thrown into a shaft that terminates in the building&#x27;s power generator. This gives one of the book&#x27;s characters the idea that humanity has been selectively bred for life within the Urbmons.

<text>Arthur Peter König (1856 – 1901) is a German physicist specialized in optics. In 1886, he published an empirical determination of the spectral sensitivity of the human rod and cone sensors with Conrad Dietrici.

== Biography ==
Born with congenital kyphosis, he devoted his short life to physiological optics. he studied in Bonn and Heidelberg, later moved to Berlin in the fall of 1879 where he studied under Hermann von Helmholtz, whose assistant he became in 1882. After obtaining a doctoral degree in 1882, he qualified for a professorial position in 1884. In 1890, he became director of the physical department of the Physiological Institute of the University of Berlin. In the same year he married Laura Köttgen with whom he had a son, Arthur, who became an astronomer. Circulatory problems caused by his kyphosis resulted in his premature death in 1901.

== Career ==
Originally working in physics, he began in 1883 to concentrate on physiological optics where he published over thirty papers, some of seminal importance. Among these are the 1886 paper (together with Conrad Dietrici) &quot;Fundamental sensations and their sensitivity in the spectrum&quot;, an empirical determination of what in fact is the spectral sensitivity of the human rod and cone sensors of vision.

Earlier attempts at such measurements, but based on much simpler technology, had been made in 1860 by the English physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879). Using newly developed spectrophotometric equipment and modifications of the experimental procedure König and Dieterici published a more detailed paper in 1892, determining the &quot;fundamental sensations&quot; not only of subjects with normal color vision (trichromats) but also of dichromats and monochromats.

With these measurements König provided evidence for the conjecture that the most common form of color blindness, dichromacy, is due to the absence of one cone type in the eye. Averaged König functions were widely used in psychophysical color stimulus calculations until new data based on a slightly different method were determined by John Guild and William David Wright in 1920s, resulting in the recommendations of standard observer data by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE, German:Commission Internationale de l&#x27;Eclairage) in 1931.

Other important investigations involve the sensitivity of the normal eye for differences in wavelength of light, dependence of the Newton/Grassmann laws of color mixture on light intensity, validity of Fechner&#x27;s law at different light intensities, brightness of spectral hues at different light intensities,
 and the similarity between the perceptual sensitivity of the rod cells and the absorption spectrum of the rod photopigment, rhodopsin.

König was an active editor. In 1889 he became the sole editor of Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft. From 1891 on, together with the psychologist H. Ebbinghaus, he edited the journal Zeitschrift für Psychologie und Physiologie der Sinnesorgane. After Helmholtz&#x27;s death in 1894, König took on the task of completing preparations for the second edition of the former&#x27;s Treatise on physiological optics (1896, German:Handbuch der physiologischen Optik) to which he added a bibliography of vision consisting of nearly 8,000 titles.

König&#x27;s 32 papers on physiological optics were published posthumously in book form in 1903.

<text>Deborah Ann Conway (born 8 August 1959) is an Australian rock singer-songwriter and guitarist, and had a career as a model and actress. She was a founding member of the 1980s rock band Do-Ré-Mi with their top-5 hit &quot;Man Overboard&quot;.

Conway performs solo and has a top-20 hit single with &quot;It&#x27;s Only the Beginning&quot; (1991). The associated album, &quot;String of Pearls&quot;, also peaked in the top 20. She won the ARIA Award for Best Female Artist at the 1992 awards. Her next album, &quot;Bitch Epic&quot;, reached the top 20 in November 1993. Conway organised and performed on the Broad Festivals from 2005 to 2008—show-casing contemporary Australian female artists.

== Early life and education ==
Deborah Ann Conway was born on 8 August 1959 in Melbourne, Victoria. Her father Carl was a lawyer, entrepreneur, realtor and stockbroker in Toorak (died 2011). Conway attended Lauriston Girls&#x27; School—photos of her as a schoolgirl were displayed at the Sydney Jewish Museum.

She started Media Studies at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) but left in 1979. Next, she attended University of Melbourne for an arts degree with modelling and singing to support her way through. A billboard campaign for Bluegrass jeans featured Conway&#x27;s nude backside and the phrase &quot;Get yours into Bluegrass&quot;. Other ads with Conway as a model include Big M and Crunchie.

==Career==
===1959–1980: Early years and The Benders===
At the age of 18, Conway started playing guitar, and in 1980 she joined the Benders as a vocalist whilst still at university. Her father was so concerned when she joined the pop band that he sent her to a psychiatrist. Other members of The Benders included Neville Aresca (bass guitar), Les Barker (guitars, vocals), Dorland Bray (drums, vocals), John Campbell, Daniel Solowiej and Greg Thomas (guitar, keyboards). They performed mostly in Melbourne pubs playing original material—mostly written by Conway and Thomas as well as Blondie and Devo cover versions. Conway also wrote songs with Bray.

Conway had minor roles in the films &quot;Mallacoota Stampede&quot; (1979) and &quot;Hard Knocks&quot; (1980).

===1981–1991: Do-Ré-Mi to Rose Amongst Thorns===
In 1981, Conway and Bray relocated to Sydney and formed pop rock band Do-Ré-Mi, with Helen Carter on bass guitar and Stephen Philip on guitar. They recorded two albums, &quot;Domestic Harmony&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Happiest Place in Town&quot; (1988), and eight singles. Their best performed hit, &quot;Man Overboard&quot;, peaked at No. 5 on the Australia Kent Music Report Singles Chart and became the eighth-highest-positioned Australian song on the 1985 End of Year Chart. In the early 1980s, Conway was the domestic partner of Paul Hester—drummer for Deckchairs Overboard and then Split Enz—before he left for Los Angeles in 1985 and formed Crowded House there.

Conway played the lead role of &quot;Julie&quot; in an Australian teenage road movie called &quot;Running on Empty&quot;, which was released in 1982.

In late 1983, Conway supplied vocals for actor Tracy Mann&#x27;s singing in the ABC Television series &quot;Sweet and Sour&quot; (1984), including the hit title song, &quot;Sweet and Sour&quot;. Two soundtrack albums and three singles from the series were credited to The Takeaways (and various artists). Conway sang lead vocals on half the songs and backing vocals on almost all the rest. Conway had a minor role in &quot;The Coca-Cola Kid&quot; (1985).

In 1986 Conway performed with The Rock Party, a charity project initiated by The National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, which included many Australasian musicians: Neil Finn, Eddie Rayner, Tim Finn, Nick Seymour and Hester (all from Crowded House); Geoff Stapleton, Robbie James and Mark Callaghan (all from GANGgajang); Reg Mombassa and Martin Plaza (both from Mental As Anything); Andrew Barnum and Lissa Barnum (Vitabeats); Mary Azzopardi (Rockmelons), Michael Barclay, Peter Blakeley, Jenny Morris, Danny De Costa, Greg Herbert (The Promise), Spencer P Jones, Sean Kelly (Models), John Kennedy, Paul Kelly, Robert Susz (Dynamic Hepnotics) and Rick Swinn (The Venetians). The Rock Party released a 12&quot; single &quot;Everything to Live For&quot;, which was produced by Joe Wissert, Phil Rigger and Phil Beazley.

Do-Ré-Mi disbanded in 1988 not long after their second album was released. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (Australia) named Conway &#x27;Best Australian Female Singer&#x27; for that year.

While Do-Ré-Mi were working in England in 1988, Conway became involved in Pete Townshend&#x27;s project &quot;The Iron Man: The Musical by Pete Townshend&quot;. Shortly afterwards she recorded an album of dance music in Los Angeles which was not released except for a solo single, a cover of Bad Company&#x27;s &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot; (1990), produced by Scott Cutler.

In 1990, Conway formed &quot;Drawcards&quot; as a semi-acoustic band with Vika and Linda, Stephen Cummings, Dror Erez, Tim Finn, Ross Hannaford, Peter Jones, Shane O&#x27;Mara and Chris Wilson. Almost immediately it split with half its members—Conway, Hester, Erez, Jones and Wilson—forming Rose Amongst Thorns as a pub rock band from 1990 to 1991.

===1991–1996: &quot;String of Pearls&quot; &amp; &quot;Bitch Epic&quot;===

In 1991, Conway played Juno in Peter Greenaway&#x27;s &quot;Prospero&#x27;s Books&quot;, singing a setting of William Shakespeare&#x27;s masque from &quot;The Tempest&quot; to music by Michael Nyman.

Deborah Conway&#x27;s debut solo album was released in October 1991, titled &quot;String of Pearls&quot;, which peaked at No. 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The album was produced by Richard Pleasance, Joe Hardy and Michael den Elzen. Singles from the album include &quot;It&#x27;s Only the Beginning&quot; which reached No. 19 on the ARIA Singles Chart in August, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; (December) and &quot;Release Me&quot; (February 1992), all three of which were co-written with Scott Cutler. For her work on the album, she won ARIA Award for Best Female Artist at the ARIA Music Awards of 1992. To support the releases, Deborah Conway and the Mothers of Pearl was formed with Alan Harding (keyboards), Peter Jones (drums, ex-Drawcards and Rose Amongst Thorns), Bill McDonald (bass guitar) and Willy Zygier (guitar). Conway and Zygier became domestic partners and have written and performed much of Conway&#x27;s subsequent material.

Conway released her second album &quot;Bitch Epic&quot; in 1993, which peaked at No. 18 and was produced by Jim Rondinelli and Zygier. The cover features an upper body shot of a topless Conway, covered in Nutella and cream, as she is about to eat a slice of cake thereby illustrating the concept of Gluttony for ABC TV mini-series &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot; (1993). Conway, Paul Kelly, Vika Bull and Renée Geyer provided vocals and song writing for the related soundtrack. An eight-track extended play of live songs was added to &quot;Bitch Epic&quot; to form 1994&#x27;s &quot;Epic Theatre&quot;, which was produced by Zygier. Her backing band were Zygier, Harding, McDonald and Hughie Benjamin (ex-Yothu Yindi) on drums.

Ultrasound, an experimental band, with Conway, Zygier, McDonald and Hester, recorded and produced their self-titled album, &quot;Ultrasound&quot; (1995).

===1997–2003: &quot;My Third Husband&quot; to &quot;Only the Bones&quot;===

Conway recorded a new album &quot;My Third Husband&quot; with Dave Anderson producing and, after returning to Australia in mid-1997, it was released in October 1997.

In May 2000, Conway released her fourth studio album, &quot;Exquisite Stereo&quot;, on Shock Records. Her backing band, Deborah Conway and the City of Women, was Zygier, Cameron Reynolds (samples), Edmond Amendola (bass guitar) and Dave Williams (drums)—the latter two are members of Augie March. This was much more of a rock record than previous releases, it &quot;was a mature album featuring a wide variety of styles, from acoustic love song (&quot;You Come to Earth&quot;) and Radiohead-styled epics (&quot;Interzone&quot;) to full tilt rockers (&quot;I Lay Down on My Pillow and Cried All Night&quot;)&quot;.

Following &quot;Exquisite Stereo&quot;, Conway played the lead role of Patsy Cline in the Australian stage production of &quot;Always... Patsy Cline&quot; and recorded a covers album of Cline&#x27;s songs, called &quot;&quot; (2001), which was produced by Zygier and Reynolds. She supported the release by touring as Deborah Conway and the Patsy Clones which contained Zygier and Reynolds, and Gerry Hale.

&quot;Only the Bones&quot; is Conway&#x27;s compilation album which was released in 2002. The cover showed Conway at a table picking over a meal. The album was re-titled &quot;Definitive Collection&quot;, with a different cover, and re-released in 2004.

Conway performed &quot;Dreaming Transportation: Voice Portraits of the First Women of White Settlement at Port Jackson&quot; which was scripted and directed by Andrée Greenwell. The performance premiered at the Sydney Festival in 2003 and a year later was staged again, at the Sydney Opera House. Performing with Conway were Susan Prior, Christine Douglas, Amie McKenna and Jeannie Van de Velde and musicians, Hope Csuturos (violin), James Nightingale (clarinet, saxophone), Jane Williams (cello), Kim Poole (guitar/mandolin), Denise Papaluca (piano), Mardi Chillingworth (double bass) and Jared Underwood (percussion). The work was inspired by a series of poems by Jordie Albiston.

===2004–2016: Conway and Zygier===

In August 2004, Conway released &quot;Summertown&quot;, under the name of Conway and Zygier on the Another Intercorps label and was produced by Conway, Zygier and Hale. It has a 1960s folk-pop sound to it. Conway and Zygier supported sales by appearing in fans&#x27; homes. Brisbane group, &quot;george&quot;, recorded Do-Ré-Mi&#x27;s hit single &quot;Man Overboard&quot;, with Conway providing vocals, on their 2004 single &quot;Still Real&quot;. Katie Noonan from &quot;george&quot; also performed with Conway in 2005. In 2005, Conway provided vocals for Man Bites God&#x27;s single &quot;Bride of the Dragon&quot; from their album &quot;The Popular Alternative&quot;.

From 2005 to 2008, Conway collaborated with different female artists to tour Australia as part of the Broad Festival project. Each year&#x27;s roster performed their own and each other&#x27;s songs: Sara Storer, Katie Noonan, Ruby Hunter, Conway, and Clare Bowditch in 2005; Melinda Schneider, Mia Dyson, Kate Miller-Heidke, Conway, and Ella Hooper in 2006; Anne McCue, Sally Seltmann, Conway, Jade Macrae, and Abbe May in 2007; and Laura Jean, Elana Stone, Liz Stringer, Dianna Corcoran, and Conway in 2008.

In 2008, Conway was appointed artistic director of the Queensland Music Festival, which runs biennially in late July in odd-numbered years.

In May 2010, Conway and Zygier released &quot;Half Man Half Woman&quot;, which was produced by James Black (from stage band for &quot;RocKwiz&quot;) who also provided keyboards. The album included a track, &quot;Into the Blue&quot; recorded with Conway and Zygier joined by their three daughters, Syd, Alma and Hettie on vocals. &quot;The Age&quot;″s Michael Dwyer observed that Conway and Zygier did not compromise, &quot;from [Zygier&#x27;s] jaunty Wes Montgomery-styled instrumental overture to a charming banjo lullaby featuring their three daughters, it fairly saunters with a relaxed resolve to be whatever it wants to be&quot;.

&quot;Stories of Ghosts&quot;, released in February 2013, explored Old Testament themes, and received positive reviews in the Australian music press.

In August 2016, Conway announced the release of her ninth studio album &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Begging&quot; on 2 September 2016. The album is a collection of mainly acoustic songs about an unbeliever&#x27;s take on Old Testament themes from a Jewish perspective. This was accompanied by a tour in August and September.

===2023: &quot;Book of Life&quot;===
In September 2023, Conway and Zygier premiered their musical theatrical show, &quot;Songs From The Book of Life&quot;, at the Brisbane Festival, based on Conway&#x27;s forthcoming memoir. On 3 October 2023, Conway published her memoir, &quot;Book of Life&quot;. It was shortlisted for the 2024 Nib Literary Award.

==Portraits and other recognition==
In 1996, a portrait of Conway as Medusa, painted by Rosemary Valadon, was a finalist in the Archibald Prize. The prize is awarded for the &quot;best portrait painting preferentially of some man or woman distinguished in Art, Letters, Science or Politics&quot;.

A portrait of Conway by Lewis Miller was a finalist in the 2022 Archibald Prize.

==Personal life==
Conway was in a relationship with Paul Hester before he moved to Los Angeles in 1985. Conway is married to guitarist and musical collaborator Willy Zygier. The pair had met in 1991 when Conway was vetting guitarists for her touring band, they formed a domestic partnership in that decade and married in 2007. As of September 2016, they have three adult daughters, Syd, Alma and Hettie, who are all musicians.

<doc id="970822" wikidata="Q8060739" url="?curid=970822" title="Yukio Hattori">
<text>was a Japanese television personality who was best known as an expert commentator on the television show &quot;Iron Chef&quot;. Hattori was also the fifth president of the Hattori Nutrition College; the &quot;Iron Chef&quot; end credits mention that the program is &quot;produced in cooperation with&quot; the College. Hattori received a PhD from Showa University.

==Life and career==
In the English-dubbed version of &quot;Iron Chef&quot;, shown on the U.S. Food Network and Australia&#x27;s SBS network, Hattori was often referred to as &quot;Doc&quot; by the show&#x27;s announcer, Kenji Fukui. After being introduced, Hattori typically responded, &quot;Always a pleasure.&quot; While his main role on the show was as a commentator, Hattori took the place of Chairman Takeshi Kaga at least once when the chairman &quot;boycotted&quot; Kitchen Stadium to protest the poor performance of his Iron Chefs. (The boycott was scripted in the show, as Kaga had another taping schedule that night.) Hattori also challenged the Iron Chefs at least twice. His first battle, in 1994, was against Iron Chef Japanese Rokusaburo Michiba; truffles were the theme ingredient. In his second battle, in 1998, he faced off against Iron Chef Japanese Koumei Nakamura over tuna. Hattori lost both battles.

His voice in the English-dubbed version of &quot;Iron Chef&quot; is supplied by Canadian-born voice actor Scott Morris. Hattori taped an appearance in season 2 of &quot;The Next Iron Chef&quot;.

He also served as an expert commentator on the TV series , a show where celebrities would attempt to make dishes, do so either successfully or horribly, and be judged on their food.

Hattori appeared as a special guest of one of the judges in the baking contest in &quot;Yakitate!! Japan&quot; (episode 7).

Hattori died on 4 October 2024, at the age of 78.

<text>Mursili I (also known as Mursilis; sometimes transcribed as Murshili) was a king of the Hittites 1620-1590 BC, as per the middle chronology, the most accepted chronology in our times (or alternatively c. 1556–1526 BC, short chronology), and was likely a grandson of his predecessor, Hattusili I. His sister was Ḫarapšili and his wife was queen Kali.

== Accession ==
Mursili came to the throne as a minor. Having reached adulthood, he renewed Hattusili I&#x27;s warfare in northern Syria.

== Campaigns ==
=== Conquest of Yamhad (Aleppo) ===
He conquered the kingdom of Yamhad and its capital, Aleppo, which had eluded Hattusili. He then led an unprecedented march of 2,000 km south into the heart of Mesopotamia, where in 1595 BC he sacked the city of Babylon. Mursili&#x27;s motivation for attacking Babylon remains unclear, though William Broad has proposed that the reason was obtaining grain because the clouds from the Thera eruption decreased the Hittites&#x27; harvests.

=== Sack of Babylon ===
The raid on Babylon could not have been intended to exercise sovereignty over the region; it was simply too far from Anatolia and the Hittites&#x27; center of power. It is thought, however, that the raid on Babylon brought an end to the Amorite dynasty of Hammurabi and allowed the Kassites to take power, and so might have arisen from an alliance with the Kassites or an attempt to curry favor with them. It might also be that Mursili undertook the long-distance attack for personal motives, namely as a way to outdo the military exploits of his predecessor, Hattusili I.

== Assassination ==
When Mursili returned to his kingdom, he was assassinated in a conspiracy led by his brother-in-law, Hantili I (who took the throne), and Hantili&#x27;s son-in-law, Zidanta I. His death inaugurated a period of social unrest and decay of central rule, followed by the loss of the conquests made in Syria.

==In popular culture==
Mursili I is a playable leader (as the Latinized form &quot;Mursilis&quot;) of the Hittite state in the 2001 video game &quot;Civilization III&quot;.

<text>The Aero A.30 was a biplane light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. It was built in Czechoslovakia in the late 1920s. It originated as an attempt by Aero to improve the performance of the Aero A.11, but soon evolved into quite a different aircraft, larger and more powerful than its predecessor. The aircraft is readily distinguished from other related types, through the difference in spans between its wings – the upper set being of much greater span than the lower.

==Development==
In 1926, the Ministry of National Defense (MNO) issued a request for a long-range reconnaissance and medium bomber aircraft. Aero entered the competition with the A.30, based on the Aero A.11, designed by Antonín Husník. The A.11 airframe was enlarged and strengthened, and fitted with a Lorraine 12E Courlis engine. Prototype test flights continued until the spring of 1927. This led to redesigns, including the tail surface, wing reinforcement system and landing gear, so that prototypes weren&#x27;t considered complete until the summer of 1927.

Prototypes of the A.30 were retrospectively designated A.130, with the A.230 being the main production version. The A.330 and A.430 featured different, more powerful engines, but the latter of these did not enter production, serving instead as the prototype for the Aero A.100.

The public unveiling, organized by the Aeroclub of the Czechoslovak Republic, took place at the 4th International Air Show in Prague on 4–19 July 1927. On 10 August 1927, Josef Novák, the chief pilot at Aero, set several records in the A.30. This included nine national endurance records as well as speed records. Several of those were broken by Alois Ježek on 12 October 1927 in a Letov Š-16. Antonín Duchek set a national record flying an A.30 equipped with a Skoda L 500 hp (367 kW) engine on 23 July 1929.

==Variants==
;A-30: Early model. Three prototypes with Lorraine Dietrich 12Cc engines (450hp) were completed in the manufacturing plant between 1926 and 1927. About five production models with Skoda L engines (500hp) were built between 1928 and 1929.
;Ab-30: with split landing gear and characteristic drop-shaped covers of rubber shock absorbers. Škoda L engine with an output of 367 kW (500 hp). 12 Ab 30s produced in 1931 and 1932.
;A-130: Walter Jupiter ( Bristol Jupiter ) radial engine prototype . 1 piece made.
;A-230: serial type with licensed Praga three-row engine (Lorraine-Dietrich 12Ccs). The type called &quot;Lochneska&quot; produced in series in 1930–1931 was a modification of the A-30 type and an improvement of the A-130. 25 A-230s produced.
;A-330: due to constant problems with the Škoda L engines, the A-30 and Ab-30 types (18 units) were rebuilt and the 478/551 kW (650/750 hp) Praga ESV engine was used. These machines were armed with machine guns vz. 28 and vz. 30
;A-30HS: one converted A-30 with 441 kW (600 hp) Hispano Suiza 12Ybrs engine
;A-430: redesigned Avia Vr-36 powered aircraft project completed as Aero A-100

<doc id="970837" wikidata="Q7130104" url="?curid=970837" title="Panasonic M2">
<text>Panasonic M2, earlier known as 3DO M2, is a multimedia terminal and cancelled video game console. It was initially developed by The 3DO Company as a peripheral chip for the 3DO hardware before turning into a standalone successor system. In January 1996, the technology was acquired by Matsushita (Panasonic) who continued development as their own game console before cancelling it altogether in 1997. The M2 technology was then incorporated into commercial-oriented devices including a Konami arcade board and in interactive kiosks.

==History==
As with the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, the M2 hardware was co-designed by Dave Needle and RJ Mical. First announced as a peripheral chip for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer with a custom PowerPC microprocessor, the M2 eventually became a standalone console and was exhibited and demonstrated at the 1995 Electronic Entertainment Expo. For a time, the M2 was scheduled to be released both as a standalone unit and as an add-on chip. In 1996, an M2 developer stated that he did not think an M2 add-on chip was possible because the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer and M2 architectures were too vastly different from each other.

=== Matsushita sale ===
Initially the plan was for the 3DO Company to license the console to multiple manufacturers, as it had done with the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, and both Matsushita (Panasonic) and GoldStar were signed on to produce M2 units. However, 3DO later sold exclusive rights to the M2 to Panasonic for a sum of $100 million agreed in October 1995, and relinquished their involvement with the console over the next several months. Matsushita formed a new division in April 1996 named Panasonic Wondertainment Inc. headquartered in Tokyo to be their in-house software developer for the M2. Several of the M2&#x27;s third-party developers expressed concern that Panasonic would be unable to give them the same high quality development support that they had been receiving from 3DO and said that in light of this they were reconsidering whether it would be worth the effort of learning how to develop for the M2. For several months Panasonic and Sega were discussing a partnership over the M2, but talks between the two companies broke down in the second quarter of 1996. According to 3DO president Trip Hawkins, &quot;The deal was virtually done. It only fell apart at the last minute.&quot;

According to Omid Kordestani, a 3DO spokesperson, the M2 could generate 1 million polygons per second with the graphics features turned off and 700,000 polygons per second with the features turned on. There were plans to make M2 models with built-in DVD players, similar to the later PlayStation 2. According to 3DO senior vice president of hardware engineering Toby Farrand, &quot;M2 was designed knowing that we would make it a DVD capable player.&quot;

A preview in &quot;Next Generation&quot; published well before the console&#x27;s planned release gave it four out of five stars, claiming that the M2 was several times as powerful as any gaming console then on the market. They also praised the 3DO Company&#x27;s strategies for securing third-party support for the system, and concluded that &quot;M2 has crossed the line from being a collection of fanciful tech specs to hard silicon that people can work on and believe in.&quot;

The M2 failed to appear at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo; a Panasonic spokesperson at the show said they were still undecided on how they were going to use the M2 technology, and that it was no longer certain that they would be using it as a gaming platform. By the end of 1996 a release date was not yet set for the console, and third-party developers were stating that in practice the M2 was not significantly more powerful than the Nintendo 64. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; summarized the M2 situation at this time: &quot;Some months, it seems the boat is still afloat: Rumors crop up of a public showing, new demos come out or a Matsushita official doles out some tantalizing hints. Other months, it seems the boat has capsized, with developers scrambling to get off the boat while they still can.&quot;

=== Cancellation of console ===
Matsushita cancelled the project in mid-1997, unwilling to compete against fellow Japanese electronics giant Sony&#x27;s PlayStation and Nintendo&#x27;s Nintendo 64, both of which had recently had several top-selling games released for them. Word of this leaked in late May, but it was not until July that the console&#x27;s cancellation was made public, via an announcement by Matsushita president Yoichi Morishita. The M2 was canceled so close to release, marketing had already taken place in the form of flyers, and several of its prospected launch titles had gameplay screens in circulation.

In October 1997 Matsushita announced that they were marketing the M2 hardware as an industrial system capable of custom multimedia applications for simulations.

=== Use in other hardware ===
Development kits and prototypes of the machine became very valuable pieces among collectors. M2&#x27;s technology was integrated in the multimedia players FZ-21S and FZ-35S, both released in 1998. Both products were aimed at professionals working in medicine, architecture, and sales, not home users. The M2 also became a short-lived arcade board by Konami. The agreement to develop the board was made well in advance of the M2 console&#x27;s planned release date, with the understanding that games using the arcade board would be ported to the home console, similar to the relationship between the PlayStation and Namco System 11. Because games ran straight from the CD-ROM drive, it suffered from long load times and a high failure rate, so only five games were developed for it.

In the late 1990s and from 2000 on, the system was also sold in the interactive kiosk market. In 2000, PlanetWeb, Inc. began offering software to allow the M2 to be used as an Internet appliance. All of the software released for the M2 kiosks was developed with the &quot;CDMotion for M2/M2X&quot; software, which was a point and click &quot;codeless&quot; SDK for M2. None of the applications utilized the Macintosh based SDK in conjunction with Macintosh Programmers Workbench. The M2 technology was later used in automated teller machines, and in Japan in coffee vending machines.

==Accessories==
The M2 console gamepad was to have six buttons positioned by the right thumb and two shoulder buttons, much like the standard Sega Saturn gamepad, and a D-pad surrounded by a rotating analog wheel.

==Games==
In late 1995 four M2 games in development had been shown to the public: &quot;ClayFighter III&quot;, &quot;Descent&quot;, &quot;Ironblood&quot; (later released for the PlayStation as &quot;Iron &amp; Blood: Warriors of Ravenloft&quot;), and an untitled racing game by Studio 3DO (presumably &quot;IMSA Racing&quot;). A fifth game, &quot;D2&quot; (a sequel to &quot;D&quot;), was previewed early the following year. Studio 3DO also claimed to be working on a version of &quot;BattleSport&quot; for M2. Other confirmed M2 projects include &quot;Return Fire 2&quot;; &quot;Power Crystal&quot;, an RPG by British developer Perceptions; a rail shooter developed by Genki; and &quot;NFLPA Superstars&quot;, a 6v6 backyard football game by Condor (later renamed Blizzard North), whose budget of nearly $1m helped the company financially during the development of &quot;Diablo&quot;. A game based on the film &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; was announced in 1996, but may not have entered development.

In 1996, a &quot;Top Gun&quot; game was in development by Spectrum Holobyte but was never released.

Capcom and Konami were both later confirmed to be licensed M2 developers.

&quot;Ultra Game Players&quot; magazine reported in its July 1997 issue that, according to a former 3DO employee, nearly 80 games were in development for the M2.

In 2008, the now-defunct website Games That Weren&#x27;t 3DO/M2 released a 2d shooter that was originally part of &quot;IMSA Racing&quot; as a hidden mini game but was made bootable to work as a stand-alone game on any 3DO M2 hardware.

In 2010 the only completed M2 game, &quot;IMSA Racing&quot;, was made available to the public.

In 2017, two fully playable builds of Ironblood were released by a German collector and are available for download to this day.

In January 2020, a compilation demo disc was released by the YouTube channel “Video Game Esoterica”. The disc contains twelve diverse demos from the development period of M2 and includes the only known playable files of the M2 version of D2.

<doc id="970846" wikidata="Q1534298" url="?curid=970846" title="Grand Prix (1966 film)">
<text>Grand Prix is a 1966 American sports drama film directed by John Frankenheimer, produced by Edward Lewis, and written by Robert Alan Aurthur with uncredited story contributions by Frankenheimer and rewrites by William Hanley. It stars an international ensemble cast, including James Garner, Eva Marie Saint, Yves Montand, Brian Bedford, Jessica Walter, Françoise Hardy and Antonio Sabàto. Toshiro Mifune has a supporting role as a race team owner, inspired by Soichiro Honda. The picture was photographed in Super Panavision 70 by Lionel Lindon, and presented in 70mm Cinerama in premiere engagements. Its unique racing cinematography is one of the main draws of the film.

The film includes real-life racing footage and cameo appearances by drivers including Formula One World Champions Phil Hill, Graham Hill, Juan Manuel Fangio, Jim Clark, Jochen Rindt and Jack Brabham. Other drivers who appeared in the film include Dan Gurney, Lorenzo Bandini, Bob Bondurant, Ludovico Scarfiotti, Richie Ginther, Joakim Bonnier, Bruce McLaren and Jo Siffert.

One of the ten highest-grossing films of 1966, &quot;Grand Prix&quot; won three Academy Awards for its technical achievements.

==Plot==
The story follows the fate of four Formula One drivers through a fictionalized version of the 1966 Formula One season:
* Jean-Pierre Sarti (Ferrari) – A Frenchman who has been World Champion twice, is nearing the end of his career and is feeling increasingly cynical about racing itself.
* Pete Aron (first Jordan BRM, then Yamura) – An American attempting to repeat past successes and overcome his reputation as a reckless, second-tier driver; he signs with the newcomer Yamura Motors.
* Scott Stoddard (Jordan BRM) – A British driver recuperating from a bad crash that left him hospitalized; he becomes dogged by recurrent pains while dealing with the emotional turmoil of his rocky marriage.
* Nino Barlini (Ferrari) – A charismatic yet arrogant Italian racer, he&#x27;s Ferrari&#x27;s No. 2 driver, being a promising rookie and former world motorcycle champion.

The film&#x27;s subplots revolve around the women who try to live with or love the racers with dangerous lifestyles. The married Sarti begins an affair with American magazine writer Louise Frederickson, who initially has little interest in motorsports. Aron has a brief romance with Stoddard&#x27;s unhappy wife Pat while Stoddard deals with living in the shadow of his family&#x27;s history, being unsure if he can live up to the prestigious racing legacy of his late brother.

The story concludes at the Italian Grand Prix, its winner likely to become World Champion. Sarti&#x27;s wife Monique shows up just before it begins; she comes face-to-face with Louise and tells Sarti that she&#x27;ll never grant him a divorce, even as Sarti wishes to end their unhappy union. Sarti&#x27;s car has technical difficulties at the race&#x27;s start, with the other drivers facing a close contest for first. Sarti is killed in a spectacular crash. In recognition, his Ferrari teammate, Barlini, is flagged off the course by team leader Manetta, resulting in a tight race between Aron and Stoddard to the finish line, Aron getting the checkered flag. While a jubilant Aron magnanimously invites Stoddard to the winner&#x27;s platform to join him, the shock of Sarti&#x27;s death takes its toll on the celebration. The film ends with Aron alone, walking along the circuit of the final racetrack.

==Production==

Director John Frankenheimer later said when he made the film he had the &quot;choice of making a &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; type picture or a &quot;Test Pilot&quot; type picture&quot; and he chose the former. Swedish actress Harriet Andersson was originally cast as the female lead, but was replaced by Eva Marie Saint after the first week of filming.

The making was a race itself as fellow Hollywood icons Steve McQueen and John Sturges planned to make a similar movie exploring the life of racers, with the McQueen/Sturges team initially using the title &quot;Day of the Champion&quot;. Due to the McQueen/Sturges production&#x27;s exclusivity contract with the German Nürburgring race track, Frankenheimer had to turn over 27 reels shot there to Sturges. Frankenheimer got ahead in schedule terms anyway, however, and McQueen&#x27;s project ran into a wide variety of problems. His racing film, entitled &quot;Le Mans&quot;, was released in 1971.

The production team began by using connections to Grand Prix drivers such as Dan Gurney, Carroll Shelby and former Grand Prix World Champion Phil Hill, who all assisted them in trying to break through an otherwise reluctant European establishment. The filming process meant disrupting vital practice runs and otherwise getting in the way of the actual racers&#x27; activities. The &quot;Grand Prix&quot; team initially faced a particularly lukewarm response from Ferrari, with the firm concerned that the movie would overly sensationalize their work. Frankenheimer spliced together approximately thirty minutes of detailed footage after filming in Monte Carlo, temporarily halted the movie&#x27;s production, and sent the short piece over to the company&#x27;s management. He received such a positive response that he gained unprecedented access, being allowed to shoot inside Ferrari&#x27;s production floor alongside the real racing vehicles. The director used this budding relationship to push other entities to help with the film-making process. Many real-life drivers of the era ended up making cameo appearances in &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, several even briefly speaking alongside the actors.

The F1 cars in the film are mostly mocked-up Formula Three cars made to look like contemporary Formula One models, although the film also used footage from actual F1 races. Because Yamura Motors is a fictional race team, the producers struck a deal with Bruce McLaren&#x27;s newly formed McLaren team to have his car, the McLaren M2B, painted with Yamura&#x27;s colors. The paint scheme used was designed to resemble that used on the contemporary Honda RA272 cars competing during this period. On two occasions, because the McLaren could not take part in these races, another car was painted in the same colours: Bob Bondurant&#x27;s BRM at Spa, and at Zandvoort for the Dutch GP, the Lotus 25 BRM entered by Reg Parnell for Mike Spence.

Some of the footage was captured by Phil Hill, the 1961 World Champion, who drove a modified camera car in some sessions during the actual Monaco and Belgian Grands Prix. In order to realistically film the racing cars at speed, the camera car used for much of this filming was a Ford GT40, a fast and powerful endurance racing car of the same type that dominated races such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans during the last half of the 1960s. This was some of the earliest experimentation with in-car cameras for F1, particularly in terms of first-person shots aimed at putting the audience in the position of the racers.

The actual level of driving ability possessed by the movie&#x27;s actors varied wildly. Bedford could not drive at all and was only ever in the car for close-up type shots, with the production&#x27;s driving instructor calling the actor&#x27;s situation &quot;hopeless&quot;. Montand and Sabàto faced significant challenges, both of them struggling with even basic skills. Garner, on the other hand, proved competent enough that he trained exclusively with iconic Shelby Cobra driver Bob Bondurant, with the actor&#x27;s interest in cars growing greatly as a direct result of his involvement in the film. Garner&#x27;s talents on the road became strong enough that some of the professional drivers, including Bondurant, remarked that the actor could have been a successful Grand Prix driver if he had not gone into making films; in fact, Garner went on to sponsor his own Formula racing team, captured in the 1969 documentary &quot;The Racing Scene&quot;. His devotion to the part in &quot;Grand Prix&quot; caused him to do his own stunt in the scene in which a fuel leak in his vehicle sets it on fire. Garner&#x27;s car was fitted with a higher rollbar and had no seat, since he was too tall to fit in a contemporary F3 car.

The blue and red helmet design that James Garner&#x27;s character uses is often confused with that of then-Grand Prix race driver Chris Amon from New Zealand; the colours are reversed. Brian Bedford&#x27;s character’s design was the same as real life 1966 BRM driver Jackie Stewart. As Bedford couldn&#x27;t drive, this was done so that they could shoot footage of Stewart driving the BRM (with a balaclava over his face to hide that it wasn&#x27;t Bedford). Sarti&#x27;s helmet was John Surtees&#x27;, and Barlini&#x27;s was Lorenzo Bandini&#x27;s.

Circuits featured in the film include Circuit de Monaco (Monaco), Clermont-Ferrand (France), Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (Belgium), Circuit Park Zandvoort (Netherlands), Brands Hatch (United Kingdom), and Autodromo Nazionale Monza (Italy). The Nürburgring (West Germany), Watkins Glen International (USA), and the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez (Mexico) were all mentioned in the film but there was no footage shown.

The camera cars used during actual GP races were a Lotus 25 Climax at Monaco and a McLaren M2B Ford at Spa, both driven by 1961 F1 World Champion Phil Hill. A camera was mounted at the front only at Monaco, and an additional one filming the driving wheel was in place at Spa. Aerial shots were filmed from an Alouette III helicopter. These shots were taken so close to the actual roads that the cameraman&#x27;s shoes became stained with bits of greenery from the tips of nearby trees. Several other camera cars were used during the shooting of staged races, including a modified Ford GT40 and an AC Cobra.

Although making various technological innovations in their filmmaking, numerous difficulties bogged down the movie&#x27;s production. During filming with wet roads, several cars lost control to the point that one driver broke his shoulder bone and another nearly careened into the upstairs window of a house. The production team often decided to include unplanned accidents caught on film in the final movie, coming back hours later to shoot before-and-after scenes so that things fit in the final cut. For major accidents that were part of the story-line, the crew constructed a special cannon-like device that could fire gutted cars a considerable distance.

Title designer Saul Bass was credited as visual consultant, montages and titles. He made extensive use of multiple split screens. During the making of the film, both Frankenheimer and Garner were interviewed by television personality Alan Whicker for the BBC series &quot;Whicker&#x27;s World&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===

The film grossed $20.8 million in the United States and Canada. It was one of the ten highest-grossing films of 1966. Theatrical rentals generated $9.3 million for the studio.

===Critical===
Upon its 1966 release, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther called the film &quot;a smashing and thundering compilation of racing footage shot superbly at the scenes of the big meets around the circuit, jazzed up with some great photographic trickery ... Mr. Frankenheimer belts you with such a barrage of magnificent shots of the racing cars, seen from every angle and every possible point of intimacy, that you really feel as though you&#x27;ve been in it. The octane pace race editing, interspersed with proper high speed car-to-car camera angles; long drivers&#x27; Point-of-View (POV) angles (try to stop your head moving in sync with the turns...); and a revolutionary split-screen device motif, further introducing car racing footage not seen before in modern film. Furthermore, the director and Saul Bass fill that mammoth screen from time to time with these split-screens and montages that made the racing sequences fairly jump with pure octane . Triple and quadruple panels and even screen-filling checkerboards ... hit the viewer with stimulations that optically generate a sort of intoxication with racing. It&#x27;s razzle-dazzle of a random sort, but it works.&quot; However, Crowther concluded &quot;the big trouble with this picture ... is that the characters and their romantic problems are stereotypes and clichés... You come away with the feeling that you&#x27;ve seen virtually everything there is to see in grand-prix racing, except the real guys who drive those killer cars.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;one of those rare pictures that draws its basic strength, excitement and interest-arresting potential through the visual (the pure art of cinema) and if it lacked brilliant virtuosity in the action department it would be just another flimflam.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;the new, definitive, great film about auto racing&quot;, adding that after three hours &quot;if one emerged with the feeling that maybe there has been just too much, here is one case in which I can state happily that it is better than too little.&quot; Leo Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;John Frankenheimer&#x27;s &#x27;Grand Prix&#x27; is brought alive with cinematic innovations and is frequently set ablaze with excitement.&quot; Brendan Gill of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described the film as &quot;big, brave, eye-bedazzling, earsplitting, and sometimes almost heart-stopping.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;The cars, of course, steal all the thunder, but one is a little disappointed to find the drivers and their private lives so little elevated beyond the level of pulp fiction. Still, as a spectacle &quot;Grand Prix&quot; is on the whole such a success that the fact it isn&#x27;t anything more than a spectacle hardly matters.&quot;

Forty-five years later, upon its release on Blu-ray Disc, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the film again, with Dave Kehr saying in 2011 &quot;considered purely from a technical point of view, the new disc is a beauty, with crisp, richly textured images that do justice to the original 65-millimeter Super Panavision format, and a roaringly dimensional soundtrack ... As a movie, though, &quot;Grand Prix&quot; was never that grand. First shown as a reserved-seat, road-show attraction in Cinerama theaters, it is little more than a 176-minute version of the roller-coaster ride &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; that introduced the format in 1952, a high-speed tour of the principal stops on the Formula One tour, with the spectator, as often as possible, strapped into the driver&#x27;s seat.&quot;

==Accolades==
At the 39th Academy Awards, &quot;Grand Prix&quot; won Oscars for Best Sound Effects (Gordon Daniel), Best Film Editing and Best Sound (Franklin Milton). John Frankenheimer was nominated for Outstanding Directing by the Directors Guild of America.

<doc id="970870" wikidata="Q5524192" url="?curid=970870" title="Garry Moore (mayor)">
<text>Garry Anthony Moore (born 8 January 1951) is a former mayor of Christchurch, New Zealand, serving from 1998 to 2007. Subsequently, he was a board member of the NZ Transport Agency. He is a &#x27;South Island enthusiast&#x27;.

==Early life==
Moore was born in Palmerston North in 1951 and received his schooling there. He trained as an accountant; first at Palmerston North Technical Institute and then at Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology. He had come to Christchurch through his love for vintage cars; the Vintage Car Club was founded in the city and rural roads around Christchurch are ideal for excursions in old cars. He met his wife, Pam Sharpe, while they were both studying at Christchurch Polytechnic. They were married in 1977 and have two girls and two boys. In the 1980s, he was involved in several schemes helping unemployed people. Whale Watch Ltd in Kaikōura is one such company that he helped set up.

==Political career==

In 1989, Moore was elected to the Area Health Board, which can be seen as early predecessors of the District Health Boards. Starting in 1992, he served two terms as councillor, before he was elected mayor in the 1998 local body elections. He announced that he would not stand for re-election in the 2007 local body elections. Former television host Bob Parker succeeded Moore as mayor of Christchurch in October 2007.

==Post politics==
In 2008 Moore was appointed a board member of the newly amalgamated NZ Transport Agency. Post-earthquake, Moore was a strong critic of the government agency Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority.

Moore founded a blog and related speaking group called the Tuesday Club.

In 2024 Moore experienced a stroke, and he was recovering well. Moore revealed he had experienced a brain seizure and three &quot;mini-strokes&quot; before the major stroke in May.

==Honours and awards==
In 1990, Moore was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 2008 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to local-body affairs.

<doc id="970872" wikidata="Q7751253" url="?curid=970872" title="The Michigan Review">
<text>The Michigan Review is a news publication in Ann Arbor, Michigan. &quot;The Review,&quot; published biweekly, is funded primarily by grants from the Collegiate Network, donations, and by advertising revenue.

== History ==
&quot;The Review&quot; was founded by Thomas Fous and Ronald J. Stefanski, in response to an editorial in &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; attacking Fous, who was then the chairman of the university&#x27;s College Republicans. Fous consulted with editors of &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot;, as well as &quot;Detroit News&quot; writer Alan Miller to help direct the formation of the paper. The nascent group secured 501(c)(3) status for &quot;The Review&quot;, and empaneled an honorary advisory board, which included Paul W. McCracken, Russell Kirk, Irving Kristol, and R. Emmett Tyrrell.

In late November 1982, the first issue of &quot;The Review&quot; debuted on the campus of the University of Michigan, as well as on campuses across the state of Michigan. The issue&#x27;s founding editorial, entitled &quot;In Response to Needs and Demands,&quot; laid out the history and mission of &quot;The Review&quot;. A copy of this editorial was reprinted in the April 16, 2007, issue.

Since its founding issue, &quot;The Review&quot; has gone through numerous incarnations, from a long-form magazine format, to an opinion journal format, to more traditional newspaper format. The current publication resembles a more traditional newspaper format than anything else. Though its paper size is that of a tabloid, its content and presentation is more traditional than stereotypical tabloids, which tend to sensationalize stories.

&quot;The Review&quot; has gained national attention during its history. It was an important voice on campus against the University of Michigan&#x27;s speech code, which was eventually struck down as unconstitutional by federal courts. Additionally, &quot;The Review&quot; has long been engaged in a fight against U-M&#x27;s use of affirmative action policies in its admissions processes. Its work on this issue has brought the journal national press exposure, including interviews on national and international news, as well as numerous articles by &quot;Review&quot; editors published in national outlets, like the &quot;National Review&quot;, the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, and &quot;The American Spectator&quot;. &quot;The Review&quot; also played an important role in its coverage of the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, a ballot initiative passed in 2006 that bans the use of racial and gender preferences in the state of Michigan.

&quot;Review&quot; alumni have achieved some measure of success in the national arena, working for such media outlets as the &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Hill&quot;, and &quot;Investor&#x27;s Business Daily&quot;, and writing speeches for President George W. Bush.

<doc id="970884" wikidata="Q6849213" url="?curid=970884" title="Mike Ward (New Zealand politician)">
<text>Michael Grahame Ward (born 18 July 1942) is a former Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand politician. He was an MP for one term from 2002 to 2005. He was co-leader of the Values Party (a predecessor to the modern Greens) from 1985 to 1988. In 2006, Ward was an unsuccessful candidate for male co-leader of the Green Party, following the death of Rod Donald in 2005.

==Early life==
Born in 1942, Ward was educated at Nelson College from 1956 to 1959. He attended Christchurch Teachers College from 1962 to 1963, gaining a Diploma of Teaching, and worked as a primary school teacher in 1964. He then studied at the University of Canterbury from 1965 to 1968 and was awarded a Diploma of Fine Arts majoring in sculpture. He worked as a secondary school teacher between 1969 and 1977.

==Political career==
Ward joined the Values Party in 1975 after a visit by the then leader of the party, Reg Clough, to Tokoroa High School where Ward was working as an art teacher. Ward was a Values Party candidate in the 1981, 1984 and 1987 elections. In 1984 he was elected co-leader of the party.

He was a Green Party candidate in the 1990 election. He was an Alliance candidate in the 1993 and 1996 elections. He was a Green Party candidate in the 1999, 2002 and 2005 elections.

===Member of Parliament===

Ward was an unsuccessful candidate at seven New Zealand general elections before being elected in the 2002 general election at No. 9 on the Green party list, after the counting of special votes. Although he moved up one place on the list for the 2005 election he lost his seat as the Green vote fell. When he was in Parliament, he was the Green Party spokesperson on Arts and Culture, Older Persons, Small Business, Sports, Fitness and Leisure, Tourism and Waste-free. These portfolios were taken over by the remaining six Green MPs after Ward lost his seat.

Following the death of Rod Donald, shortly after the 2005 election, Ward put his name forward as a contender for the male co-leader position. He lost the position on 3 June 2006 at the annual meeting to Russel Norman in an STV vote by delegates from electorates around the country. Ward was next on the Green party list to re-enter parliament when Nándor Tánczos resigned in 2008. Ward initially declined to stand aside so that Russel Norman, the now co-leader, could take Tánczos&#x27;s list seat when he resigned from Parliament. Ward changed his mind, because of the advantages in having the party co-leader in Parliament during an election year, and Norman became an MP on 27 June.

===Nelson City Council===
Ward served as a Nelson City Councillor from 1983 to 1989, from 1992 to 1998 and from 2011 to 2016. He stood as a candidate for Mayor of Nelson in 1986, 1989 and in 2007. He came a close second in 1989 and came fourth in 2007. He unsuccessfully stood for mayor in 2010. and stood again for mayor in 2019, coming fifth.

=== Creative Alliance ===
In May 2017, Ward announced the formation of a new political party called Creative Alliance. However, as of July 2019 the party has not stood in any elections and is not registered.

==Other activities==

In 2005, shortly after that year&#x27;s general election, Ward won the Montana World of Wearable Art Supreme Award. Ward is the only person who completed all the first 28 Coast to Coast races. Ward is also an appointed Justice of the Peace.

<text>2SER is a not-for-profit radio station in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, broadcasting on the frequency 107.3 FM. It is operated by Sydney Educational Broadcasting Ltd, and co-funded by two Universities, University of Technology Sydney and Macquarie University. It is a member of the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia. The station has a metro-wide license and broadcasts a mix of programming styles - specialist music, general magazines, and specialist talks.

== Programming ==
2SER broadcasts a wide range of music and talk shows. Talk show topics include science, current affairs, health, conservation, publishing, gender and queer culture, music, arts and theatre. Music genres include experimental, metal, pop and spatial audio.

Some programs have been on air for more than 30 years, including &quot;Back To Funk&quot;, &quot;Static&quot; and &quot;The Phantom Dancer&quot;. &quot;Gaywaves&quot;, an LGBTQIA+ program, aired from November 1979 to 2005. Gaywaves returned to air in 2022 after 17 years. 

The station is also one of few media outlets that has a special program for prisoners, &quot;Jailbreak&quot;.

==History==
On 1 October 1979 2SER was opened by the Federal Minister for Education, Senator John Carrick.

In the mid-1990s the station expanded its programming to emphasise underground dance music. This caused friction within the station but 2SER organised a series of highly lucrative fund raising events called Freaky Loops in association with Sydney promoters such as Cryogenesis, Clan Analogue, Club Kooky and Elefant Traks which sustained the move to a new musical format for several years until 2001.

The station worked on improving its brand across the 2003-2005 period, incorporating a new logo, while the station&#x27;s online presence and content experience was also redesigned.

In late 2004, the station was faced with a projected budget shortfall of up to $100,000 that financial year. Management addressed the situation by reducing the number of paid staff, putting forward proposals to scale down the use of its studio at Macquarie University and attempting to cater for a slightly older audience. These ideas were met with frustration from some volunteers. Internal activism resulted in a softening of policy and in early 2005, the new program grid was launched. Despite the controversy in its lead-up, it proved to be a simple reshuffle of the existing grid rather than a dramatic overhaul.

From the late 2000s and into the 2010s, 2SER has continued to expand its offerings across broadcast and digital, as well as with podcasting. It has won international awards for its collaborations, including a Silver Radio Prize at the New York Festivals Radio Awards for History Lab (with Impact Studios). 

The station celebrated its 40th anniversary in October 2019 with a podcast series, exhibition and book, &quot;An Incomplete History of Community Radio: 2SER&#x27;s 46 Boxes of Stuff.&quot; The station&#x27;s long-term publication, Listening Post, was also digitised in full and placed in the Australian open access archive Trove.

Today it runs out of UTS as well as Macquarie University. 

== People ==
The station helped launch the broadcasting careers of Julie McCrossin, Robbie Buck, Richard Kingsmill, Helen Razer, Eleanor Hall, Fenella Kernebone, Steve Ahern, Jess Scully, Barbara Morison and Jonathan Harley - all of whom started out on the station as volunteers.

The founding station manager was Keith Jackson. Former station managers include Kaye Blackman, Melanie Withnall, and Paula Kruger. The current station manager is Cheryl Northey.
