<doc id="494904" wikidata="Q171965" url="?curid=494904" title="Luhansk Oblast">
<text>Luhansk Oblast (; ), also referred to as Luhanshchyna (), is the easternmost oblast (province) of Ukraine. Its administrative center is the city of Luhansk. The oblast was established in 1938 and bore the name &quot;Voroshilovgrad Oblast&quot; until 1958 and again from 1970 to 1991. It has a population of 

Important cities in Luhansk Oblast include Alchevsk, Antratsyt, Brianka, Kadiivka, Kirovsk, Krasnodon, Khrustalnyi, Luhansk, Lysychansk, Pervomaisk, Rovenky, Rubizhne, Sievierodonetsk and Sverdlovsk. All of the oblast is in the Donbas region. 

In 2014, large parts of the oblast, including the capital Luhansk, came under the control of Russian-backed separatists who declared the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic, leading to a war against Ukrainian government forces. Since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the oblast has come almost entirely under Russian occupation and has been the scene of heavy fighting, which continues in some places. In late September 2022, Russia declared the annexation of the entire oblast, along with three others, though the annexation remains internationally unrecognized. As of September 2024, Ukraine is in control of 1.5% of the region, including a few settlements, such as Hrekivka and Tverdokhlibove. These areas continue to see active conflict.

==Geography==
Luhansk Oblast is in far eastern Ukraine. Its north–south length is 250 km, and east–west width 190 km. It covers an area of 26,700 km2, 4.42% of the total area of Ukraine.

The oblast has the longest segment of Ukraine&#x27;s international border with Russia among other regions (&quot;see State Border of Ukraine&quot;), consisting of . The abutting Russian oblasts are Belgorod Oblast to the north, Voronezh Oblast to the northeast, Rostov Oblast to the east. Abutting Ukrainian oblasts are Kharkiv Oblast to the west, and Donetsk Oblast to the south.

The region is located in the valley of the Siversky Donets river, which flows west to east through the oblast and splits it approximately in half. The southern portion of the region is elevated by the Donetsk Ridge, which is close to the southern border. The highest point is Mohyla Mechetna (), the highest point of Donetsk Ridge. The left bank of the Siversky Donets is part of the Starobilsk Plain. To the north this transforms into the Central Russian Upland.

==History==

The territory was formerly part of the Wild Fields, and former administrative units in the territory of the current oblast included Sloboda Ukraine, Slavo-Serbia, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Donets Governorate and Donetsk Oblast.

=== Soviet Ukraine (1938–1991) ===
The oblast originated in 1938 as Voroshylovhrad (Russian: Voroshilovgrad) Oblast () after the Donetsk Oblast was split between Voroshylovhrad and Stalino (today Donetsk Oblast) oblasts. Following the Soviet invasion of Poland, Starobilsk was the location of a prisoner of war camp for Poles, who were then massacred in the Katyn massacre in 1940. After the invasion by Nazi Germany in 1941, the region came under a German military administration, due to its proximity to frontlines. It was occupied at the end of 1942 as part of Case Blue German offensive directed towards Stalingrad.

Soon after the battle of Stalingrad, the Luhansk (at that time Voroshilovgrad in honor of Kliment Voroshilov) region again became the center of military operations during the Soviet counter-offensive operation Little Saturn in the spring of 1943. In the summer of 1943, the region was liberated from the Nazi Germany Armed Forces. During the Soviet era, the Oblast bore its current name between 1958 and 1970.

In the December 1991 referendum, 83.86% of votes in the oblast were in favor of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine.

=== Independent Ukraine (1991–2014) ===

==== Pro-Russian insurgency (2014–2022) ====

On 8 April 2014, following the annexation of Crimea by Russia, pro-Russian separatists occupying the Luhansk Oblast administrative building planned to declare the independence of the region as the Luhansk Parliamentary Republic, after other pro-Russian separatists declared Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic in the Donetsk Oblast (7 April 2014). When the Luhansk Parliamentary Republic ceased to exist, the separatists declared the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic on 27 April 2014. They held a disputed referendum on separating from Ukraine on 11 May 2014. The legitimacy of the referendums was not recognized by any government. Ukraine does not recognize the referendum, while the EU and US said the polls were illegal and fraudulent. Subsequently, the war in Donbas began.

As a result of the war in Donbas, Luhansk insurgents control the southern third of the oblast, which includes the city of Luhansk, the region&#x27;s most populous city and the capital of the oblast. Due to this, most oblast government functions have moved to Sievierodonetsk, which forces of the Government of Ukraine recaptured in July 2014. Many universities located in the occupied areas have moved to government-controlled cities such as Sievierodonetsk, Starobilsk or Rubizhne. A survey conducted in December 2014 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that 5.7% of the oblast&#x27;s population supported their region joining Russia, 84.1% did not support the idea, and the rest were undecided or did not respond. Insurgent-controlled areas were not polled.

==== Russian occupation (2022–present) ====

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian ground forces entered the occupied territory of Luhansk Oblast by crossing the Russian border on 22 February 2022. They invaded government-controlled territory across the line of contact and the Russian border on 24 February. As of 26 May 2022 they had occupied all but 5% of the region.

During the mid-2022 battle of Donbas, Russian troops attacked and eventually captured the cities of Sieverodonetsk and Lysychansk during May and June 2022 in two of the most significant and most intense battles of the Eastern Ukraine offensive. By 3 July 2022, Russian and allied troops controlled all cities in the oblast. On 4–5 July 2022, during the international Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC 2022) in Lugano, Finland, Sweden, and the Czech Republic pledged to support the postwar rebuilding of the Luhansk region. On 11 September 2022, there were unconfirmed reports that Bilohorivka near Lysychansk, was recaptured. On 19 September 2022, Ukrainian forces confirmed this.

In late September 2022, an annexation referendum was held in Luhansk on joining the Russian Federation, although Ukraine along with the United Nations and most observers declared the referendum to be illegitimate and fraudulent. Following the staged victory in the voting, the region and the so-called Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic were absorbed into Russia. The United Nations General Assembly subsequently passed a resolution calling on countries not to recognise what it described as an &quot;attempted illegal annexation&quot; and demanded that Russia &quot;immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw&quot;.

, nearly all of the oblast is occupied by Russia, which claims the oblast as the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic (LPR), a self-declared state turned Russian federal subject. The war in Donbas and the subsequent 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine saw heavy fighting in the oblast, with Sievierodonetsk captured in June by Russian and LPR forces after an assault lasting several weeks, and the oblast&#x27;s last major settlement under Ukrainian control, Lysychansk, captured by Russian and Russia-backed forces on 2 July. The next day, Russia&#x27;s Minister of Defence announced that the entire territory of the oblast had been &quot;liberated&quot;, but three weeks later the governor of the oblast reported heavy fighting was still ongoing. On 4 September, Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive in eastern Ukraine and recaptured small parts of Donetsk Oblast and, on 1 October, Lyman. Ukrainian forces also pushed through the stalemate at the Luhansk Oblast border and, most notably, recaptured Bilohirivka while engaging LPR forces in Lysychansk. Since then, there has been continued fighting in the western parts of the region in a renewed Luhansk Oblast campaign.

==Administrative subdivisions==


Like the other provinces of Ukraine, Luhansk Oblast has a double jurisdiction. The oblast is predominantly administrated by the Luhansk Oblast State Administration, headed by the governor of the oblast, who is appointed by the President of Ukraine. The province has a representative body, the provincial council, which is headed by its chairman and elected by popular vote.

The province is primarily divided into 18 &quot;raions&quot; (districts), and 37 cities, including 14 cities of regional significance. The administrative center is Luhansk. These raions are listed below with their areas and populations.

The province&#x27;s secondary division consists of various municipalities. Those municipalities may consist of one or more populated places. The municipalities are administratively subordinate to the raion in which they are located, with the exception of 14 cities subordinated directly to the oblast. The city of Luhansk is subdivided into its own four city-districts (boroughs).

All subdivisions are governed by their respective councils (&quot;radas&quot;).
===Cities===
==Demographics==

The population is largely Russian-speaking, although ethnic Ukrainians constitute a majority (58.0%). Among the minorities are native Russians (39.1%), Belarusians (0.8%), and others (1.4%). Ukrainians constitute the majority in all raions except for Stanytsia-Luhanska Raion and Krasnodon Raion, both of which are east of Luhansk. Ethnic Russians also constitute the majority in regionally significant cities, such as Krasnodon, Sverdlovsk, Khrustalnyi and Kadiivka.

In the 2001 Ukrainian Census, more than 68.8% of the population considered themselves Russian speakers, while 30.0% considered themselves Ukrainian speakers. The Russophone population predominates in the southern portion of the region and around the city of Luhansk, while the northern region is less populated, mostly agricultural and Ukrainophone.

Its population (as of 2004) of 2,461,506 constitutes 5.13% of the overall Ukrainian population. The Luhansk Oblast rates fifth in Ukraine by the number of its inhabitants, having an average population density of 90.28/km2. About 87% of the population lives in urban areas, while the remaining 13% reside in agricultural areas.

<text>Chernihiv Oblast (), also referred to as Chernihivshchyna (), is an oblast (province) in northern Ukraine. The administrative center of the oblast is the city of Chernihiv. There are 1,511 settlements in the oblast, with a total population of 

==Geography==
The total area of the province is around 31,900 km².

On the west, the oblast is bordered by the Kyiv Reservoir of the Dnieper River and Kyiv Oblast, which has a enclave known as Slavutych, which was created from Chernihiv Oblast for the inhabitants of Chernobyl following the Chernobyl disaster. It is bordered by Sumy Oblast to the east and Poltava Oblast to the south. The northern border of the oblast is part of Ukraine&#x27;s international border abutting Belarus&#x27;s Gomel Region in the north-west and the Russian Bryansk Oblast in the north-east, respectively.

The oblast is bisected into northern and southern sections by the Desna River, which enters the Dnieper just north of the Kyiv city limits.

==History==

Chernihiv Oblast was created as part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on 15 October 1932.

The capital city of Chernihiv has known human settlement for over 2,000 years, according to archaeological excavations. Chernihiv Oblast comprises a very important historical region, notable as early as the Kievan Rus&#x27; period, when the cities of Chernihiv and Novhorod-Siverskyi were frequently mentioned. The city of Chernihiv was the second most important Ukrainian city during the Rus&#x27; period of Ukrainian history, often serving as a major regional capital. Danylo of Chernihiv wrote of his pilgrimage to Jerusalem during this era. The region at various times was ruled by the Kievan Rus&#x27;, Mongol Empire, Lithuania, Poland and Russia. Numerous tragic events have taken place in the region, such as the Battle of Kruty and the Koriukivka massacre. During World War II, the province was occupied by Germany in 1941–1943.

During the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chernihiv Oblast was one of the first regions where Russian and Ukrainian forces clashed. On 4 April 2022 Governor of Chernihiv Oblast Vyacheslav Chaus stated that the Russian military had left Chernihiv Oblast, but that it had planted mines in many areas. On 4 and 5 April 2022 units of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine retook control of their border crossing in Chernihiv Oblast. But the Russian troops crossed the border and entered Chernigov, capturing three Towns, The video shows the Russian soldier placing the Russian flag on the destroyed bridge in the Chernigov region.

Chernihiv Oblast was famous for its specific style of folk icon-painting. Brightness and realistic depictions of the saints were typical for it, with red and hot yellow paints used. The icons were decorated by flowers in a manner reminiscent of Slavonic pre-Christian traditions. The icons from Chernihiv Oblast were spread outside its territory. Many of them are preserved in the Museum of Ukrainian home icons of the Radomysl Castle.

==Nomenclature==
Most of Ukraine&#x27;s oblasts are named after their capital cities, officially referred to as &quot;oblast centres&quot; (, translit. &quot;oblasnyi tsentr&quot;). The name of each oblast is a relative adjective, formed by adding a feminine suffix to the name of respective centre city: &quot;Chernihiv&quot; is the centre of the &quot;Chernihivs&#x27;ka oblast&quot;&#x27; (Chernihiv Oblast). Most oblasts are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix &quot;-shchyna&quot;, as is the case with the Chernihiv Oblast, &quot;Chernihivshchyna&quot;.

<text>Dnipropetrovsk Oblast (), is an oblast (province) in simultaneously southern, eastern and central Ukraine, the most important industrial region of the country. It was created on February 27, 1932. Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has a population of about approximately 80% of whom live centering on administrative centers: Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Kamianske, Nikopol and Pavlohrad. The Dnieper River runs through the oblast.

==Geography==
Most of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, including Dnipro Raion, is located in eastern Ukraine, though some parts are in central and southern Ukraine, such as Kamianske Raion and Nikopol Raion, respectively. The area of the oblast (31,974 km2) comprises about 5.3% of the total area of the country. Its longitude from north to south is 130 km, from east to west – 300 km. The oblast borders the Poltava and Kharkiv oblasts on the north, the Donetsk Oblast on the east, the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts on the south, and the Mykolaiv and Kirovohrad oblasts on the west. Historically, it is located in the region of Zaporizhzhia.

The Black Sea Lowland covers about half of the territory of the oblast, where it lies only within the west bank of the Dnieper. In Terny, a Ternivsky meteorite crater is located. It is in diameter and its age is estimated at 280 ± 10 million years (Permian). The crater is not exposed at the surface. The Dnieper Upland contains a number of minerals including iron, manganese, granite, graphite, brown coal, and kaolin. Kryvbas is an important economic region, specializing in iron ore mining and the steel industry. It is arguably the main iron ore region of Eastern Europe. Named after the city of Kryvyi Rih, the mining base of the region occupies the southwestern part of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, as well as the small neighboring parts of the Kirovohrad and Kherson Oblasts.

The region possesses major deposits of iron ore and some other metallurgical ores. To exploit them, several large mining companies were founded here in the middle of the 20th century. Most of them are located in Kryvyi Rih itself, which is the longest city in Europe (roughly in a straight line from one end to another).

=== Geology ===
Much of the Dnipropetrovsk oblast is located within the boundaries of the Ukrainian Shield and only the northern regions and the extreme eastern part of the territory are confined to the south-eastern side of the Dnipro-Donets depression.

In the geological structure of the region, the breeds come from the archaea, the Proterozoic, the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic.

==History==

In the 6th to 8th centuries AD the first settlements of Slavs appeared on the banks of the Dnieper within the region. During the period of Kievan Rus&#x27; (9th to 12th centuries AD) the Dnieper River functioned as one of the main trade corridors of medieval Eastern Europe, part of the route &quot;from the Varangians to the Greeks&quot;, which connected the Baltic Sea region with the Crimea and with the capital of Byzantium, Constantinople. The Dnieper also served as a major route for transporting the armies of Kyiv princes on their way to the Byzantine coastal cities in the early 9th and late 9th centuries.

At the beginning of the 15th century, Tatar tribes inhabiting the right bank of the Dnieper were driven away by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, by the mid-15th century, the Nogai (who lived north of the Sea of Azov) and the Crimean Khanate invaded these lands. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crimean Khanate agreed to a border along the Dnieper, and farther east along the Samara River, i.e. through what is today the city of Dnipro. At this time there appeared a new force, the Cossacks - armed free men not subject to any feudal lord - who soon came to dominate the region. They later became known as Zaporozhian Cossacks, from Zaporizhzhia, the lands south of Naddniprianshchyna (Zaporizhzhia translates to &quot;the Land Beyond the Rapids&quot;). This period of raids and fighting caused considerable devastation and depopulation in the Pontic steppe; the area became known as the &quot;Wilderness&quot; or the &quot;Wild Fields&quot;.

In 1635, the Polish government built the Kodak fortress above the Dnieper Rapids at &quot;Kodaky&quot;, partly as a result of rivalry in the region between Poland, Turkey and the Crimean Khanate, and partly to maintain control over Cossack activity (i.e. to suppress the Cossack raiders and to prevent peasants moving out of the area). On the night of 3 or 4 August 1635, the Cossacks of Ivan Sulyma captured the fort by surprise, burning it down and butchering the garrison of about 200 West European mercenaries under Jean Marion. The fort, rebuilt by French engineer Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan for the Polish government in 1638, had a mercenary garrison. &quot;Kodak&quot; was captured by Zaporozhian Cossacks on 1 October 1648, and was garrisoned by the Cossacks until its demolition in accordance with the Treaty of the Pruth in 1711.

Under the Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1654, the territory came within the sphere of influence of the Moscow-based Tsardom of Russia. In 1774 Prince Grigori Potemkin was appointed governor of Novorossiysk Governorate, and after the destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich in 1775, he started founding cities in the region and encouraging foreign settlers. The city of &quot;Yekaterinoslav&quot; (present-day Dnipro) was founded in 1776, not in its current location, but at the confluence of the River Samara with the River Kil&#x27;chen&#x27; at Loshakivka, north of the Dnieper. On May 8, 1775, after the end of the Russian-Turkish War of 1768 to 1774, Russian authorities opened a postal station and track which linked Kremenchuk city, the Kinburn foreland and Ochakiv, all locations of the Imperial Russian Army.

In December 1796, Emperor Paul I re-established the Novorossiysk Governorate, mostly with land from the former Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty. In 1802, this province was divided into the Nikolayev Governorate (known as the Kherson Governorate from 1803), Yekaterinoslav Governorate, and the Taurida Governorate. The capital of the Yekaterinoslav Governorate was the city of Yekaterinoslav (modern Dnipro). It was located within the former lands of the Zaporizhian Sich. The governorate bordered to the north with the Kharkov Governorate and Poltava Governorate, to the west and southwest with the Kherson Governorate, to the south with the Taurida Governorate and Sea of Azov, and to the east with the Don Host Oblast.

Olexander Paul (1832–1890) discovered iron ore and initiated smelting, and this became the core of a developing a mining district. In 1874 Emperor Alexander II initiated the founding project of a railway, running . This enabled transportation directly to the nearest factories and greatly sped up the development of the region.
On 1 August 1925, the Yekaterinoslav Governorate administration was discontinued, and in 1926 the city of Yekterinoslav was renamed Dnipropetrovsk after Ukrainian Soviet leader Grigory Petrovsky. Before the introduction of oblasts in 1932, the Ukrainian SSR comprised 40 okrugs, which had replaced the former Russian Imperial &quot;guberniya&quot; (governorate) subdivisions. In 1932 the territory of the Ukrainian SSR was re-organized into oblasts. The first oblasts were Vinnytsia Oblast, Kyiv Oblast, Odesa Oblast, Kharkiv Oblast, and Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Soon after that, in the summer of 1932, Donetsk Oblast was formed out of eastern parts of Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts.

During the Holodomor in the 1930s, more than 200 collective farms in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast were put on &quot;Blackboards&quot; which implied a complete blockade of trade and food-aid to villages under-performing in fulfilling grain-procurement quotas; a number representing more than half of all such &quot;Blackboards&quot; throughout all of the Ukrainian SSR.

During the 1991 referendum, 90.36% of votes in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast favored the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine. A survey conducted in December 2014 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 2.2% of the oblast&#x27;s population supported their region joining Russia, 89.9% did not support the idea, and the rest were undecided or did not respond.

The city of Dnipropetrovsk was renamed &quot;Dnipro&quot; in May 2016 as part of the decommunization laws enacted a year earlier. Dnipropetrovsk Oblast was not renamed because it is mentioned by name in the Constitution of Ukraine, and the oblast can only be renamed by a constitutional amendment. In April 2018 a group of over a hundred deputies formally initiated a proposal in the Ukrainian Parliament to change the name to &quot;Sicheslav Oblast&quot;; in February 2019, the Verkhovna Rada voted to officially amend the Constitution, thus granting state sanction to the name change. Later that year the Constitutional Court officially approved the change. The oblast&#x27;s administrative centre and largest city, Dnipro, had had the unofficial name &quot;Sicheslav&quot; (commemorating the Zaporizhian Sich) in 1918–21 during the Ukrainian War of Independence. Since then, the renaming process has stalled (), for reasons such as the 2019 presidential and parliamentary elections, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022 onwards).

During the Russian invasion, the cities of Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, and Nikopol, among other locations in the region, were bombed by Russia. It was also reported that Russian troops were pushed from areas near Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and Kherson Oblast, near the border. Hannivka was occupied, liberated, and shelled
during the invasion. However, , there has been no further ground fighting and the oblast remains completely under Ukrainian control.

==Culture==
Historically, Dnieper Ukraine comprised territory that roughly corresponded to the area of Ukraine within the expanding Russian Empire. Ukrainians sometimes call it Great Ukraine (Velyka Ukraina). Historically, this region is tightly entwined with the history of Ukraine and is considered the heart of the country.

Ukrainian (67,0%) and Russian (31,9%) language are both used, with Russian being more common in cities, while Ukrainian is the dominant language in rural communities. These details result in a significant difference across different survey results, as even a small restating of a question switches responses of a significant group of people. The speaking of Surzhyk instead of Russian or Ukrainian is wide and viewed negatively by nationalist language activists. Because it is neither the one nor the other, they regard Surzhyk as a threat to the uniqueness of Ukrainian culture.

Petrykivka painting, originating from the village of Petrykivka, is known for its distinctive features such as patterns, unusual technique and white background. It was included to the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

==Landmarks==

The following historical-cultural sites were nominated to the Seven Wonders of Ukraine.
* Tomb of kosh otaman Sirko
* Troitsk Cathedral
* Church of Virgin Mary Birth
* The walls of Ukrainian defensive line
* Kurgan stelae or Balbals are anthropomorphic stone stelae, images cut from stone, installed atop, within or around kurgans (i.e. tumuli), in kurgan cemeteries, or in a double line extending from a kurgan. The stelae are also described as &quot;obelisks&quot; or &quot;statue menhirs&quot;. Spanning more than three millennia, they are clearly the product of various cultures. The earliest are associated with the Pit Grave culture of the Pontic–Caspian steppe (and therefore with the Proto-Indo-Europeans according to the mainstream Kurgan hypothesis). There are Iron Age specimens are identified with the Scythians and medieval examples with Turkic peoples. Such stelae are found in large numbers in Dnipro, Kherson and Nikolaev.
* Kodak fortress was a fort built in 1635 by the order of Polish king Władysław IV Vasa and the Sejm over the Dnieper River, near what was to become the town of Stari Kodaky (by modern day: Dnipro). It was constructed by Stanisław Koniecpolski to control Cossacks of Zaporizhian Sich, prevent Ukrainian peasants from joining forces with the Cossacks and guard the southeastern corner of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Poles tried to establish order in that area, and commissioned French military cartographer and engineer William le Vasseur de Beauplan to construct it. The fortress cost around 100,000 Polish zlotys. The dragoon garrison was commanded by the French officer Jean de Marion. Soviet government attempted to destroy the remnants of the fortress in order to eradicate traces of Polish influences on Ukraine by setting a quarry on that site in 1944. The quarry was closed in 1994, but at that time two-thirds of the fortress had been destroyed. Today the site is just ruins, but it is a popular tourist attraction.
* The Saviour&#x27;s Transfiguration Cathedral (Ukrainian: Спасо-Преображенський кафедральний собор) is the main Orthodox church of Dnipro, Ukraine. The foundation stone was laid in 1786 by Catherine II of Russia and Emperor Joseph II. The event is described in the memoirs of comte de Ségur. Prince Grigory Potemkin envisioned the church as one of the spiritual centres of New Russia. Ivan Starov submitted to Potemkin his designs for a Roman-style basilica, but construction was postponed until the end of the Russo-Turkish War.

==Symbols==

A Cossack with a musket was an emblem of the Zaporizhian Host and later the state emblem of the Hetmanate and the Ukrainian State. The origin of the emblem is uncertain, while its first records date back to 1592. On the initiative of Pyotr Rumyantsev the emblem was phased out and replaced by the Russian double-headed eagle in 1767.

A Cossack with a rifle was restored by the Hetman of Ukraine Pavlo Skoropadsky in 1918. However, later the emblem disappeared again until in 2005 it reappeared on the proposed Great Seal of Ukraine. In 2002 was adopted flag and identical coat of arms of Oblast, which consists of cossack with musket and nine yellow eight-pointed stars. Stars represent coat of arms of Yekaterinoslav Governorate which also consisted of imperial monogram of Catherine the Great.

The official plants are wheat, acanthus and oak. The motto of the oblast is Per aspera ad astra.

<text>The British Sub-Aqua Club or BSAC has been recognised since 1954 by UK Sport as the national governing body of recreational diving in the United Kingdom.

The club was founded in 1953 and at its peak in the mid-1990s had over 50,000 members declining to over 30,000 in 2009. It is a diver training organization that operates through its associated network of around 1,100 local, independent diving clubs and around 400 diving schools worldwide. The old logo featured the Roman god Neptune (Greek god Poseidon), god of the sea. The new logo, as of 2017, features a diver with the updated BSAC motto &quot;Dive with us&quot;.

BSAC is unusual for a diver training agency in that most BSAC instructors are volunteers, giving up their spare time to train others, unlike many other agencies, in which instructors are paid employees, or self-employed.

Given that UK waters are relatively cold and have restricted visibility, BSAC training is regarded by its members as more comprehensive than some. Specifically it places emphasis on rescue training very early in the programme. BSAC also maintains links with other organisations, such as NACSAC.

Science writer and science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke was a famous member of BSAC.

The current President of BSAC is William, Prince of Wales. His father Charles III, and grandfather Philip also held that position and his brother Harry, Duke of Sussex also trained with BSAC.

==Recognition==

BSAC is the National Governing Body (NGB) for sub-aqua within the United Kingdom, a role it has held since 1954. The body is recognised by Sport England as the NGB for sub-aqua in England, and by Sport Wales as the NGB for sub-aqua in Wales.

===Regional bodies===

The Scottish Sub Aqua Club, formed in 1953 (the same year as BSAC) is recognised by sportscotland as the NGB for sub-aqua in Scotland.

The Northern Ireland Federation of Sub-Aqua Clubs is recognised by Sport Northern Ireland as the NGB for sub-aqua in Northern Ireland.

Sport Wales previously recognised the Welsh Association of Sub Aqua Clubs as the NGB for sub-aqua in Wales until January 2016.

===Competitive sub-aqua===
While forms of sub-aqua, many competitive forms of sub-aqua are not governed by BSAC, as BSAC is not a member of the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) who is the global governing body for competitive sub-aqua.

Underwater hockey in Great Britain was governed directly by BSAC with the sport being invented by one of its branches in 1954. BSAC remain the NGB until 1977 when they recognised the British Octopush Association (BOA), who formed a year prior, as the new NGB. BSAC remained a governing body for a limited number clubs who didn&#x27;t switch to BOA governance. In 2013 the BOA affiliated itself to BSAC to legitimaise its safeguarding procedure. The BOA is recognised by CMAS as the NGB for underwater hockey in Great Britain.

BSAC was the first body to govern underwater rugby in the United Kingdom, though only two clubs are affiliated to the body. The British Underwater Rugby Association (BURA) is the UK&#x27;s governing body affiliated with CMAS.

==Diver Training Programme==

===Diving Qualifications===
BSAC currently has seven diver qualifications (five standard and two intermediary): 
* : Basic skills, supervised diving (depth limit 12 m).&quot;&quot;
* : Basic skills, non-decompression diving (depth limit 20 m).
* : Further Basic skills training, navigation, nitrox (up to Nitrox 36%), non-decompression diving (depth limit increased to 30 m with a series of 5 m progression dives).&quot;&quot;
* : Rescue, navigation, nitrox and decompression diving (depth limit increased to 40 m with a series of 5 m progression dives).
* : Dive leading, dive planning and management, and rescue management (depth limit increased to 50 m by completing a selection of experience dives).
* : Fully trained diver capable of leading a group of divers in normal club activities.
* : Trained to lead a group of divers carrying out a project. This is nationally examined with a two-day practical test.

===Instructor Qualifications===
BSAC has eight instructor grades: 
* : Trained but unqualified. Must be supervised when instructing.
* : Qualified to instruct unsupervised in the classroom.
* : Qualified to teach open water under supervision.
* : Qualified to instruct unsupervised in open water.
* : Qualified to supervise other instructors in classroom and open water training.
* : Trained to teach advanced skills, such as boat based skills and group diving techniques.
* : Qualified to staff Instructor events.
* : Leads Instructor Training courses and BSAC National exams.

===Grades no longer awarded===
The following grades which are no longer awarded may still be encountered:
* : A diver who has completed the extensive sheltered-water (i.e. pool) training of the BSAC syllabus of the time, but has not yet dived in open water.
* : A Novice I diver who has completed two open-water assessment dives.
The distinction between Novice I and Novice II was mostly for practical reasons to do with the difference between hiring a pool and travelling to the coast. A Novice I diver would normally complete the two open-water dives as soon as possible, but if this were not possible straight away (perhaps over winter) they would at least have a specific grade within the club. The lengthy and club-oriented Novice syllabus was replaced with the Club Diver and Ocean Diver syllabuses in the late 1990s. (However, some argue the Novice description was usefully accurate and aided diver safety because nobody with such a qualification would attempt dives beyond their capabilities).
* : This is more or less the same as Ocean Diver; originally the two were operated in parallel with Ocean Diver awarded at schools and Club Diver at clubs.
* : An instructor grade junior to Open Water Instructor, but allowing the holder to instruct practical and theory lessons without supervision.
* : This was the entry-level grade prior to the splitting of its syllabus during the mid-1980s to create the Novice and Sports Diver grades. Divers who held this grade at the time were awarded the Sports Diver grade.
* : This was the immediate grade prior to the splitting of its syllabus during the mid-1980s to create the Dive Leader and Advanced Diver grades. Divers who held this grade at the time were awarded the Advanced Diver grade.

===CMAS equivalencies===
The following CMAS equivalencies have been agreed with the Sub-Aqua Association.

<text>Khmelnytskyi Oblast (), also known as Khmelnychchyna (), is an oblast (province) in western Ukraine covering portions of the historical regions of western Podolia and southern Volhynia. The administrative center of the oblast is the city of Khmelnytskyi.

The current estimated population is around 

Created in 1937 out of border okrugs of Vinnytsia Oblast, in 1941–44 it was under Nazi Germany occupation and part of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine (Wolhynien und Podolien general district). Following the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket in spring of 1944 as part of the Proskurov-Chernovtsy operation, Soviet troops removed the German occupation in the region. Until 4 February 1954 it was called Kamianets-Podilskyi Oblast () and was centered in Kamianets-Podilsky until 1941. The region rebranding took place after the official renaming of the region&#x27;s administrative center to Khmelnytskyi.

==Geography==
Khmelnytskyi Oblast has a total area of (3.4% of the total area of Ukraine) and is located between 48°27&#x27; and 50°37&#x27; north latitude and between 26°09&#x27; and 27°56&#x27; east longitude. It is long when measured from north to south, and is in length when measured from east to west. It is associated with a historical region of Podolia, yet in reality its territory is split almost in half, the northern in Volhynia, and the southern in Podolia. Its Volhynian region contains smaller cities like Iziaslav, Starokostiantyniv, Shepetivka, while its Podolian portion more developed cities of Khmelnytskyi and Kamianets-Podilskyi.

The oblast borders the Rivne Oblast to the northwest, the Zhytomyr Oblast to the northeast, the Vinnytsia Oblast to the east, the Chernivtsi Oblast to the south, and the Ternopil Oblast to the west.

===Elevations===

The Podolian Upland (270–370 meters above sea-level) occupies the central area of the Khmelnytskyi Oblast. The northwestern areas of the oblast are part of the Volyn highland (highest point — 329 m above sea-level), while to the north, the oblast claims a part of the historic region of Polissia (highest point — 200–250 m above sea-level). The southwestern territory of the Khmelnytskyi Oblast is crossed by the Tovtry range (), which includes Mount Velyka Buhaikha (), the highest point of the oblast at 409 m above sea-level. The extreme south of the oblast has a surface with canyon-like river valleys. The Dniester Reservoir located there is the lowest point of the oblast (121 m above sea level).

<doc id="494922" wikidata="Q910924" url="?curid=494922" title="Japanese pottery and porcelain">
<text>is one of the oldest Japanese crafts and art forms, dating back to the Neolithic period. Types have included earthenware, pottery, stoneware, porcelain, and blue-and-white ware. Japan has an exceptionally long and successful history of ceramic production. Earthenwares were made as early as the Jōmon period (10,500–300BC), giving Japan one of the oldest ceramic traditions in the world. Japan is further distinguished by the unusual esteem that ceramics hold within its artistic tradition, owing to the enduring popularity of the tea ceremony. During the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1573–1603), kilns throughout Japan produced ceramics with unconventional designs. In the early Edo period, the production of porcelain commenced in the Hizen-Arita region of Kyushu, employing techniques imported from Korea. These porcelain works became known as Imari wares, named after the port of Imari from which they were exported to various markets, including Europe.

Japanese ceramic history records the names of numerous distinguished ceramists, and some were artist-potters, e.g. Hon&#x27;ami Kōetsu, Ninsei, Ogata Kenzan, and Aoki Mokubei. Japanese anagama kilns also have flourished through the ages, and their influence weighs with that of the potters. Another important Japanese constituent of the art is the continuing popularity of unglazed high-fired stoneware even after porcelain became popular. Since the 4th century AD, Japanese ceramics have often been influenced by the artistic sensibilities of neighbouring East Asian civilizations such as Chinese and Korean-style pottery. Japanese ceramists and potters took inspiration from their East Asian artistic counterparts by transforming and translating the Chinese and Korean prototypes into a uniquely Japanese creation, with the resultant form being distinctly Japanese in character. Since the mid-17th century when Japan started to industrialize, high-quality standard wares produced in factories became popular exports to Europe. In the 20th century, a homegrown cottage ceramics industry began to take root and emerge. Major Japanese ceramic companies include Noritake and Toto Ltd.. 

Japanese pottery is distinguished by two polarized aesthetic traditions. On the one hand, there is a tradition of very simple and roughly finished pottery, mostly in earthenware and using a muted palette of earth colours. This relates to Zen Buddhism and many of the greatest masters were priests, especially in early periods. Many pieces are also related to the Japanese tea ceremony and embody the aesthetic principles of . Most raku ware, where the final decoration is partly random, is in this tradition. The other tradition is of highly finished and brightly coloured factory wares, mostly in porcelain, with complex and balanced decoration, which develops Chinese porcelain styles in a distinct way. A third tradition, of simple but perfectly formed and glazed stonewares, also relates more closely to both Chinese and Korean traditions. In the 16th century, a number of styles of traditional utilitarian rustic wares then in production became admired for their simplicity, and their forms have often been kept in production to the present day for a collectors market.

== Ceramics types==
The types of ceramics can be divided into five groups: 
* unglazed earthenware

* glazed earthenware (施和的器 &quot;seyūtōki&quot; or 低火度前 &quot;teikadoyū&quot;): fired at relatively low temperatures 800–900°C using lead as the medium, the technique was introduced from the Korean peninsula in the 7th century. &quot;Sansai&quot; (三彩) is another type of technique using lead glaze. 

* unglazed stoneware (焼き締め陶窓 &quot;yakishime tōki&quot;): fired at high temperatures without applying a coat of glaze. In the Middle Ages, it was used for living utensils such as vases, pots and other everyday items, and in the Azuchi-Momoyama period, it was modified for use in tea rooms due to its simple taste.

* glazed stoneware (施和陶器 &quot;seyūtōki or 高火度和 kōkadoyū&quot;): fired at temperatures of 1250°C or higher. In many cases, the base is not pure white, but grey or brown in colour. It has a softer texture than porcelain and absorbs some water.

* porcelain (磁器 &quot;jiki&quot;): a white colour with a high silica content and few impurities. Hard ware made by firing clay at high temperatures. The technique was introduced from the Korean peninsula at the beginning of the Edo period and production began in Arita, Hizen Province, Kyushu.

== Vessel types==
Some of the typical vessel (器 &quot;utsuwa&quot;) types are: 
* tea bowl (茶碗 &quot;chawan&quot;) 
* jar (壷 &quot;tsuba&quot;) 
* bowl (鉢 &quot;hachi&quot;) 
* tea caddy (茶入 &quot;chaire&quot;)

The various features of a vessel such as the opening, rim, neck, wall, inside, foot, surface markings, etc. all have standardised names in Japanese.

==History==
=== Jōmon period ===
In the Neolithic period ( millenniumBC), the earliest soft earthenware was made.

During the early Jōmon period in the 6th millenniumBC typical coil-made ware appeared, decorated with hand-impressed rope patterns. Jōmon pottery developed a flamboyant style at its height and was simplified in the later Jōmon period. The pottery was formed by coiling clay ropes and fired in an open fire.

=== Yayoi period ===
In about the 4th–3rd centuriesBC Yayoi period, Yayoi pottery appeared which was another style of earthenware characterised by a simple pattern or no pattern. Jōmon, Yayoi, and later Haji ware shared the firing process but had different styles of design.

=== Kofun period ===
In the 3rd to 4th centuriesAD, the anagama kiln, a roofed-tunnel kiln on a hillside, and the potter&#x27;s wheel appeared, brought to Kyushu island from the Korean peninsula.

The anagama kiln could produce stoneware, Sue pottery, fired at high temperatures of over , sometimes embellished with accidents produced when introducing plant material to the kiln during the reduced-oxygen phase of firing. Its manufacture began in the 5th century and continued in outlying areas until the 14th century. Although several regional variations have been identified, Sue was remarkably homogeneous throughout Japan. The function of Sue pottery, however, changed over time: during the Kofun period (AD300–710) it was primarily funerary ware; during the Nara period (710–94) and the Heian period (794–1185), it became an elite tableware; and finally it was used as a utilitarian ware and for the ritual vessels for Buddhist altars.

Contemporary Haji ware and funerary objects were earthenware like Yayoi.

=== Heian period ===

Although a three-color lead glaze technique was introduced to Japan from the Tang dynasty of China in the 8th century, official kilns produced only simple green lead glaze for temples in the Heian period, around 800–1200.

Kamui ware appeared in this time, as well as Atsumi ware and Tokoname ware.

=== Kamakura period ===
Until the 17th century, unglazed stoneware was popular for the heavy-duty daily requirements of a largely agrarian society; funerary jars, storage jars, and a variety of kitchen pots typify the bulk of the production. Some of the kilns improved their technology and are called the &quot;Six Old Kilns&quot;: Shigaraki (Shigaraki ware), Tamba, Bizen, Tokoname, Echizen, and Seto.

Among these, the Seto kiln in Owari Province (present day Aichi Prefecture) had a glaze technique. According to legend, Katō Shirozaemon Kagemasa (also known as Tōshirō) studied ceramic techniques in China and brought high-fired glazed ceramic to Seto in 1223. The Seto kiln primarily imitated Chinese ceramics as a substitute for the Chinese product. It developed various glazes: ash brown, iron black, feldspar white, and copper green. The wares were so widely used that became the generic term for ceramics in Japan. Seto kiln also produced unglazed stoneware. In the late 16th century, many Seto potters fleeing the civil wars moved to Mino Province in the Gifu Prefecture, where they produced glazed pottery: , Shino, , and Oribe ware.

=== Muromachi period ===
According to chronicles in 1406, the Yongle Emperor (1360–1424) of the Ming dynasty bestowed ten Jian ware bowls from the Song dynasty to the Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358–1408), who ruled during the Muromachi period. A number of Japanese monks who traveled to monasteries in China also brought pieces back home. As they became valued for tea ceremonies, more pieces were imported from China where they became highly prized goods. Five of these vessels from the southern Song dynasty are so highly valued that they were included by the government in the list of National Treasures of Japan (crafts: others). Jian ware was later produced and further developed as and was highly priced during tea ceremonies of this time.

=== Azuchi-Momoyama period ===
From the middle of the 11th century to the 16th century, Japan imported much Chinese celadon greenware, white porcelain, and blue-and-white ware. Japan also imported Chinese pottery as well as Korean and Vietnamese ceramics. Such were regarded as sophisticated items, which the upper classes used in the tea ceremony. The Japanese also ordered custom-designed ceramics from Chinese kilns.

Highly priced imports also came from the Luzon and was called or &quot;Luzon ware&quot;, as well as from Annam, northern Vietnam.

=== Sengoku period ===

With the rise of Buddhism in the late 16th century, leading tea masters introduced a change of style and favored humble Korean tea bowls and domestic ware over sophisticated Chinese porcelain. The influential tea master Sen no Rikyū (1522–1591) turned to native Japanese styles of simple rustic pottery, often imperfect, which he admired for their &quot;rugged spontaneity&quot;, a &quot;decisive shift&quot; of enormous importance for the development of Japanese pottery. The Raku family (named after the pottery rather than the other way round) supplied brown-glazed earthenware tea bowls. Mino, Bizen, Shigaraki (Shigaraki ware), Iga (similar to Shigaraki), and other domestic kilns also supplied tea utensils. The artist-potter Hon&#x27;ami Kōetsu made several tea bowls now considered masterpieces.

During Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s 1592 invasion of Korea, Japanese forces brought Korean potters as slaves to Japan, According to tradition, one of the kidnapped, Yi Sam-pyeong, discovered a source of porcelain clay near Arita and was able to produce the first Japanese porcelain. These potters also brought improved kiln technology in the or rising kiln, running up a hillside and enabling temperatures of to be reached. Soon the Satsuma, Hagi, Karatsu, Takatori, Agano and Arita kilns were begun.

=== Edo period ===

In the 1640s, rebellions in China and wars between the Ming dynasty and the Manchus damaged many kilns, and in 1656–1684 the new Qing dynasty government stopped trade by closing its ports. Chinese potter refugees were able to introduce refined porcelain techniques and enamel glazes to the Arita kilns. From 1658, the Dutch East India Company looked to Japan for blue-and-white porcelain to sell in Europe (see Imari porcelain). At that time, the Arita kilns like the Kakiemon kiln could not yet supply enough quality porcelain to the Dutch East India Company, but they quickly expanded their capacity. From 1659 to 1740, the Arita kilns were able to export enormous quantities of porcelain to Europe and Asia. Gradually the Chinese kilns recovered, and developed their own styles of the highly coloured enamelled wares that Europeans found so attractive, including famille rose, famille verte and the rest of that group. From about 1720 Chinese and European kilns also began to imitate the Imari enamelled style at the lower end of the market, and by about 1740 the first period of Japanese export porcelain had all but ceased. The Arita kilns also supplied domestic utensils such as the so-called Ko-Kutani enamelware.

Porcelain was also exported to China, much of which was resold by Chinese merchants to the other European &quot;East Indies Companies&quot; which were not allowed to trade in Japan itself. It has been suggested that the choice of such items was mainly dictated by Chinese taste, which preferred Kakiemon to &quot;Imari&quot; wares, accounting for a conspicuous disparity in early European collections that can be reconstructed between Dutch ones and those of other countries, such as England, France and Germany. Because Imari was the shipping port, some porcelain, for both export and domestic use, was called . The European custom has generally been to call blue and white wares &quot;Arita&quot; and blue, red and gold ones &quot;Imari&quot;, though in fact both were often made in the same kilns arong Arita. In 1759 the dark red enamel pigment known as became industrially available, leading to a reddish revival of the orange 1720 style.

In 1675, the local Nabeshima family who ruled Arita established a personal kiln to make top-quality enamelware porcelain for the upper classes in Japan, which is called Nabeshima ware. This uses mainly decoration in traditional Japanese styles, often drawing from textiles, rather than the Chinese-derived styles of most Arita ware. Hirado ware was another kind of porcelain initially reserved for presentation as political gifts among the elite, concentrating on very fine painting in blue on an unusually fine white body, for which scroll painters were hired. These two types represented the finest porcelain produced after the export trade stalled by the 1740s. Unlike Nabeshima ware, Hirado went on to be a significant exporter in the 19th century.
During the 17th century, in Kyoto, then Japan&#x27;s imperial capital, kilns produced only clear lead-glazed pottery that resembled the pottery of southern China. Among them, potter Nonomura Ninsei invented an opaque overglaze enamel and with temple patronage was able to refine many Japanese-style designs. His disciple Ogata Kenzan invented an idiosyncratic arts-and-crafts style and took (Kyoto ceramics) to new heights. Their works were the models for later . Although porcelain bodies were introduced to by Okuda Eisen, overglazed pottery still flourished. Aoki Mokubei, Ninami Dōhachi (both disciples of Okuda Eisen) and Eiraku Hozen expanded the repertory of .

In the late 18th to early 19th century, white porcelain clay was discovered in other areas of Japan and was traded domestically, and potters were allowed to move more freely. Local lords and merchants established many new kilns (e.g., Kameyama kiln and Tobe kiln) for economic profit, and old kilns such as Seto restarted as porcelain kilns. These many kilns are called &quot;New Kilns&quot; and they popularized porcelain in the style of the Arita kilns among the common folk.

=== Meiji period ===

During the international openness of the Meiji period, Japanese arts and crafts had a new audience and set of influences. Traditional patrons such as the class broke away and many of the artisans lost their source of income. The government took an active interest in the art export market, promoting Japanese arts at a succession of world&#x27;s fairs, beginning with the 1873 Vienna World&#x27;s Fair. The Imperial Household also took an active interest in arts and crafts, appointing Imperial Household Artists and commissioning works (&quot;presentation wares&quot;) as gifts for foreign dignitaries. Most of the works promoted internationally were in the decorative arts, including pottery.

Satsuma ware was a name originally given to pottery from Satsuma province, elaborately decorated with overglaze enamels and gilding. These wares were highly praised in the West. Seen in the West as distinctively Japanese, this style actually owed a lot to imported pigments and Western influences, and had been created with export in mind. Workshops in many cities raced to produce this style to satisfy demand from Europe and America, often producing quickly and cheaply. So the term &quot;Satsuma ware&quot; came to be associated not with a place of origin but with lower-quality ware created purely for export. Despite this, there were artists such as Yabu Meizan and Makuzu Kōzan who maintained the highest artistic standards while also successfully exporting. These artists won multiple awards at international exhibitions. Meizan used copper plates to create detailed designs and repeatedly transfer them to the pottery, sometimes decorating a single object with a thousand motifs.

Japan&#x27;s porcelain industry was well-established at the start of the Meiji period, but the mass-produced wares were not known for their elegance. During this era, technical and artistic innovations turned porcelain into one of the most internationally successful Japanese decorative art forms. A lot of this is due to Makuzu Kōzan, known for Satsuma ware, who from the 1880s onwards introduced new technical sophistication to the decoration of porcelain, while committed to preserving traditional artistic values. During the 1890s he developed a style of decoration that combined multiple underglaze colours on each item. The technical sophistication of his underglazes increased during this decade as he continued to experiment. In the decade from 1900 to 1910 there was a substantial change in the shape and decoration of his works, reflecting Western influences. His work strongly influenced Western perceptions of Japanese design.

=== Taishō period ===
Japanese pottery strongly influenced British studio potter Bernard Leach (1887–1979), who is regarded as the &quot;Father of British studio pottery&quot;. He lived in Japan from 1909 to 1920 during the Taishō period and became the leading western interpreter of Japanese pottery and in turn influenced a number of artists abroad.

=== Shōwa period ===

During the early Shōwa period, the folk art movement developed, starting in the late 1920s and 1930s. Its founding father was Yanagi Sōetsu (1889–1961). He rescued lowly pots used by commoners in the Edo and Meiji period that were disappearing in rapidly urbanizing Japan. Shōji Hamada (1894–1978) was a potter who was a major figure of the movement, establishing the town of Mashiko as a renowned centre for Mashiko ware. Another influential potter in this movement was Kawai Kanjirō (1890–1966) and Tatsuzō Shimaoka (1919–2007). These artists studied traditional glazing techniques to preserve native wares in danger of disappearing.

One of the most critical moments was during the Pacific War when all resources went towards the war efforts, and production and development became severely hampered and the markets suffered.

=== Heisei period to present ===
A number of institutions came under the aegis of the Cultural Properties Protection Division.

The kilns at Tamba, overlooking Kobe, continued to produce the daily wares used in the Tokugawa period, while adding modern shapes. Most of the village wares were made anonymously by local potters for utilitarian purposes. Local styles, whether native or imported, tended to be continued without alteration into the present. In Kyūshū, kilns set up by Korean potters in the 16th century, such as at Koishiwara, Fukuoka and its offshoot at Onta ware, perpetuated 16th-century Korean peasant wares. In Okinawa, the production of village ware continued under several leading masters, with Kinjo Jiro honored as a .

The modern potters operate in Shiga, Iga, Karatsu, Hagi, and Bizen. Yamamoto Masao (Toushuu) of Bizen and Miwa Kyusetsu of Hagi were designated . Only a half-dozen potters had been so honored by 1989, either as representatives of famous kiln wares or as creators of superlative techniques in glazing or decoration; two groups were designated for preserving the wares of distinguished ancient kilns.

In the old capital of Kyoto, the Raku family continued to produce the rough tea bowls that had so delighted Hideyoshi. At Mino, potters continued to reconstruct the classic formulas of Momoyama period Seto-type tea wares of Mino, such as the Oribe ware copper-green glaze and Shino ware&#x27;s prized milky glaze. Artist potters experimented at the Kyoto and Tokyo arts universities to recreate traditional porcelain and its decorations under such ceramic teachers as Fujimoto Yoshimichi, a . Ancient porcelain kilns around Arita in Kyūshū were still maintained by the lineage of Sakaida Kakiemon XIV and Imaizumi Imaemon XIII, hereditary porcelain makers to the Nabeshima clan; both were heads of groups designated .

British artist Lucie Rie (1902–1995) was influenced by Japanese pottery and Bernard Leach, and was also appreciated in Japan with a number of exhibitions. British artist Edmund de Waal (b. 1964) studied Leach and spent a number of years in Japan studying style. Thomas Bezanson from Canada was influenced by it.

In contrast, by the end of the 1980s, many studio potters no longer worked at major or ancient kilns but were making classic wares in various parts of Japan. In Tokyo, a notable example is Tsuji Seimei, who brought his clay from Shiga but potted in the Tokyo area. A number of artists were engaged in reconstructing Chinese styles of decoration or glazes, especially the blue-green celadon and the watery-green . One of the most beloved Chinese glazes in Japan is the chocolate-brown glaze that covered the peasant tea bowls brought back from southern Song China (in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries) by Zen monks. For their Japanese users, these chocolate-brown wares embodied the Zen aesthetic of (rustic simplicity). In the United States, an example of the use of glazes are pots thrown by Japanese-born artist Hideaki Miyamura.

==Raw materials==
Raw materials are chosen largely based on local availability. There is an abundance of many basic in Japan. Due to naturally occurring kaolin deposits, many clays are found in Kyushu. Kilns were traditionally built at the sites of clay deposits, and most studio potters still use local clays, having developed a range of glazes and decoration techniques especially suited to that clay. Raw materials found in the Japanese archipelago range from those suitable for earthenwares to more refractory kaolins. From the Jōmon period to the Yayoi period, Japanese potters relied on high plastic iron-bearing shale and alluvial clays. Organic materials appear in much of the early Jōmon period work, but sand or crushed stone predominates thereafter.

Further refinements came about under the Chinese influence in the 8th and 9th centuries AD, when creators of Nara three-color wares and Heian ash glazed wares sought out white, refractory clays and enhanced their fineness through levigation.

== Traditional shaping methods ==

The earliest pieces were made by pressing the clay into shape. This method continued to be employed after the invention of the wheel, such as when producing Rengetsu ware. Coiled methods developed in the Jōmon period. Production by kneading and cutting slabs developed later, for example, for clay figures.

===Coil and throw===
At Koishibara, Onda, and Tamba, large bowls and jars are first roughly coil-built on the wheel, then shaped by throwing, in what is known as the &quot;coil and throw technique&quot;. The preliminary steps are the same as for coil building, after which the rough form is lubricated with slip and shaped between the potter&#x27;s hands as the wheel revolves. The process dates back 360 years to a Korean technique brought to Japan following Hideyoshi&#x27;s invasion of Korea.

=== Tools ===
Generally fashioned out of fast-growing bamboo or wood, these tools for shaping pottery have a natural feel that is highly appealing. While most are Japanese versions of familiar tools in the West, some are unique Japanese inventions.

* or &quot;cows&#x27; tongues&quot; are long sled-shaped bamboo ribs used to compress the bottoms and shape the sides of straight-sided bowls. They are a traditional tool from Arita, Kyushu.
* are round, shallow clam shell-shaped bamboo ribs used to shape the sides of curved bowls. They can also be used to compress the bottoms of thrown forms.
* , similar to wooden ribs, are leaf-shaped bamboo ribs used to shape and smooth the surfaces of a pot.
* are bamboo trimming and modeling &quot;knives&quot; available in several different shapes for carving, cleaning up wet pots, cutting, and for producing sgraffito effects.
* , &quot;dragonflies&quot;, are the functional equivalent of Western calipers with an added feature. Suspended from a or balanced on the rim of a pot, these delicate bamboo tools are used for measuring both the diameter and the depth of thrown forms.
* are wire and bamboo trimming harps that double as a fluting tool. They are used to cut off uneven or torn rims as well as to facet leather-hard forms.
* , &quot;cranes&#x27; necks&quot;, are s-curved Japanese wooden throwing sticks used to shape the interiors of narrow-necked pieces such as bottles and certain vases.
* are cutting, carving and incising tools made of iron and used to trim pieces, for carving, sgraffito and for scraping off excess glaze.
* A is a large looped ribbon tool made of iron that can be used for trimming as well as carving.
* An is a trimming harp used to level flat, wide surfaces, such as the bottom of a shallow dish or plate.
* are not strictly throwing tools; these combs are used to score a minimum of two decorative parallel lines on pot surfaces. The largest combs have about 20 teeth.
* A is also not a throwing tool, but a Japanese slip-trailer. A is a high-capacity bamboo bottle with a spout from which slip and glaze can be poured out in a steady, controlled stream so the potter can &quot;draw&quot; with it.

== Wares ==
Hundreds of different wares and styles have existed throughout its history. The most historic and well-known ones have received recognition from the government. For more information see the list of Japanese ceramics sites.
== Museums and collections ==

A number of museums in Japan are dedicated entirely only to ceramics. Amongst the most well-known ones are the Aichi Prefectural Ceramic Museum close to Nagoya, the Arita Porcelain Park, the Fukuoka Oriental Ceramics Museum, the Kyushu Ceramic Museum, the Noritake Garden, the Museum of Oriental Ceramics, Osaka, the Okayama Prefectural Bizen Ceramics Museum, and the Ōtsuka Museum of Art. Public museums such as the Kyushu National Museum, Kyoto National Museum, Nara National Museum, Tokyo National Museum and Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Art have important ceramic collections. A number of private museums also have important items such as the MOA Museum of Art, Mitsui Memorial Museum, Seikadō Bunko Art Museum, Fujita Art Museum and Kubosō Memorial Museum of Arts, Izumi. A number of important ceramic items are also owned and kept in various temples in Japan such as the Ryūkō-in, Kohō-an and Shōkoku-ji, however the items are not exhibited publicly.

Most ceramic museums around the world have collections of Japanese pottery, many very extensive. Japanese modern ceramic works are often very sought-after and expensive. Apart from traditional styles art and studio pottery in contemporary art styles are made for the international market.

<text>William James Farrer (3 April 184516 April 1906) was a leading English Australian agronomist and plant breeder. Farrer is best remembered as the originator of the &quot;Federation&quot; strain of wheat, distributed in 1903. His work resulted in significant improvements in both the quality and crop yields of Australia&#x27;s national wheat harvest, a contribution for which he earned the title &#x27;father of the Australian wheat industry&#x27;.

==Early years==

Farrer was born on 3 April 1845 in the town of Docker, Westmorland in the English north west (now Cumbria). The son of Thomas Farrer, a tenant farmer, and his wife Sarah William, William Farrer was selected for a scholarship at Christ&#x27;s Hospital, London where he was awarded a gold and silver medal for mathematics and soon earned a scholarship to Pembroke College where, after earning a B.A. at Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1868, Farrer emigrated to Australia in 1870. A sufferer of tuberculosis, Farrer hoped to find Australia&#x27;s drier warmer climate more agreeable to his then delicate medical condition.

Initially, Farrer lived with friends at Parramatta but was later employed as a tutor in Duntroon, then in regional New South Wales (now part of the Australian Capital Territory). In 1873 he published &quot;Grass and Sheep-farming A Paper: Speculative and Suggestive&quot; which dealt with the suitability of various soils for grasses and the scientific side of sheep-farming. After working as a tutor on George Campbell&#x27;s sheep station at Duntroon, he qualified as a surveyor in 1875. Farrer worked for the Department of Lands in wheat growing districts of NSW from 1875 to 1886.

In 1882 Farrer married Henrietta Nina, the only daughter of Leopold Fane de Salis, the then Member of Parliament for Queanbeyan, NSW. Four years later De Salis gifted to Nina alone, 97 hectares of land. A farm rather than a station &quot;Lambrigg&quot; (named for Farrer&#x27;s home district), formerly part of &quot;Cuppacumbalong&quot;&quot;, was located on the Murrumbidgee River, near Tharwa in the present day Australian Capital Territory. Farrer&#x27;s initial attempts at establishing a vineyard were thwarted as the soil proved unsuitable and he turned his attention to wheat cultivation. His goal was to produce a good loaf of bread. He would consider himself a scientific gardener.

==Lambrigg experiments==

The Wheat leaf rust disease had a major impact on both the quality and yields of wheat harvests throughout the colonies. Farrer applied his scientific knowledge to developing wheat hybrids, initially applying cross-pollination techniques to create rust immune strains of wheat. He readily improvised using hairpins to transfer pollen until he could obtain forceps. His scientific experiments continued over 20 years, and consisted of long days of planting and developing wheat strains. He used Gregor Mendel&#x27;s methods in his work. Frederick Bickell Guthrie developed small-scale procedures that emulated a flour-mill and bakehouse; Farrer used these to assess the yield from the wheat strains. The results of his experiments are recorded in handwriting notebooks.
To add to his knowledge of other breeders work he corresponded all over the world. He kept up a connection with a French wheat breeder, Henri Vilmorin, who was breeding wheat for dry areas. He also corresponded with plant breeders working in India.

Concurrently, Farrer worked on developing a strain of wheat that could resist bunt or smut-ball, another devastating enemy of wheat.

By selective breeding of varieties such as &quot;Professor Blount&#x27;s Hybrid No.38, Gypsum&quot;, Canadian Fife, Etawah and Purple Straw, Farrer aimed to produce a wheat cultivar that had the best qualities of each. Success in developing a rust-resistant, high-yielding strain greeted him in 1900, when a satisfactory series of wheat was finally obtained – the Federation strain, named after the imminent Federation of Australia. He then developed a series of other strains such as Canberra, Firbank, Cleveland, Pearlie White (named after a child in the neighbourhood who was very interested in his work) and Florence (resistant to flag smut). His successes led Farrer to become a wheat experimentalist with the NSW Department of Agriculture in 1898.

These wheat strains led to a major improvement to Australia&#x27;s wheat industry within a few years. The Federation strain was released to Australian farmers in 1903 and resulted in a trebling of Australia&#x27;s wheat harvest over a period of twenty years. Wheat export was to become a world class enterprise.

==Death and legacy==

Farrer died at his home &quot;Lambrigg&quot; near Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory on 16 April 1906 after suffering a major heart attack, and was buried on his property at dusk the next day.

In 1911 the Farrer Memorial Trust was established in his memory, initially providing scholarships for Agricultural studies. In 1936 the trust commenced awarding a medal for outstanding service to agricultural science. The first recipient of the medal was then Prime Minister of Australia and Tasmanian farmer, Joseph Lyons. A statue of Farrer was erected in Queanbeyan by the Federal government in 1935 and another at Lambrigg in 1938.

A suburb and a primary school in Canberra have been named in his honour. The school&#x27;s logo is a wheat sheaf and the sports houses are named after his most famous types of wheat. An Australian electoral division has been named after him, and Farrer was also remembered on the reverse of the Australian two-dollar banknote issued in 1966 (now withdrawn). A specialist agricultural high school (Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School, Tamworth NSW) was named in his honour and continues to provide specialist agricultural education. There is also a hall of residence at Monash University named in his honour.

William Farrer is also remembered in Wagga Wagga with the Farrer Hotel and the Farrer Football League (Australian rules football).

<text>Kirovohrad Oblast (), also known as Kirovohradshchyna (), is an oblast (&quot;province&quot;) in central Ukraine. The administrative center of the oblast is the city of Kropyvnytskyi. Its population is It is Ukraine&#x27;s second least populated oblast, behind Chernivtsi.

In 2019, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine approved the change of the oblast&#x27;s name to Kropyvnytskyi Oblast (, unofficially Kropyvnychchyna ()). The change is not yet implemented. The largest cities of the region are Kropyvnytskyi, Oleksandriia, Znamianka and Svitlovodsk.

==Geography==

The area of the province is .

The city of Dobrovelychkivka is the geographical center of Ukraine.

Most of the region is located within historic Right-bank Ukraine and Zaporizhzhia, and the western outskirts are part of historic Podolia.

==History==

The lands of the modern Kirovohrad Oblast were first inhabited by Scythians. In the Middle Ages, during the time of Kyivan Rus&#x27;, the East Slavic tribe of Ulichis lived here. After the liberation of the former Kyivan Rus&#x27; from the Tatars in the Battle of Blue Waters and the unification of the principalities of Kyiv, Pereyaslav, and Chernihiv with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, there was a need to protect the southeastern borders from attacks by the Crimean Khanate and Moscovy - states that were formed after the collapse of the Golden Horde at the end of the 15th century. For this, Dmytro Vyshnevetsky founded the first Zaporozhian Sich on the island of Khortytsia, thus the Ukrainian Cossacs appeared. On the territory of the modern Kirovohrad region the Zaporozhians founded many villages. From 1569, the territory formed of the Kingdom of Poland within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

These lands were under the rule of the Ukrainian Cossacks of Hetmanate and Zaporozhian Sich from XV to XVIII century.
As a result of the destruction of Ukrainian Cossacks and the enslavement of Ukrainians by the Russian government at the end of the 18th century, these lands came under the direct power of Russia. In 1752, the territory of New Serbia was founded with the capital in Novomyrhorod.

In the 1800s, majority of the landed was owned by the noble Skarżyński family. They played a large role in the development of the region. An emphasis was placed on the development of its agriculture and the Skarzynskis opened a school in Migeya dedicated to this.

The oblast was created as part of the Ukrainian SSR on January 10, 1939 out of the northern raions of Mykolaiv Oblast. Before establishment, its territory was part of Kherson Governorate (most of it) and Podolia Governorate (smaller portion) until 1925. Earlier before occupation of Ukraine in 1920s, in 1918 there were plans to introduce own Ukrainian administrative territorial division with territory of modern Kirovohrad Oblast being split between lands of Nyz (Lower land), Pobozhia (Boh land), and Cherkasy.

During the Soviet repressions, over 40,000 residents of the region were killed. 
During World War II, the oblast was under Nazi occupation from 1941 to 1944 and was liberated as a result of Kirovograd offensive.

In 1954, the oblast lost some raions to the newly created Cherkasy Oblast, but later that year received its western raions from the Odesa Oblast.

Between 1939 and 2016, the oblast administrative center, Kropyvnytskyi, was called Kirovohrad and was named after the First Secretary of the Leningrad City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Sergei Kirov. Due to decommunization laws (on 14 July 2016) the name of the city was changed to Kropyvnytskyi. Kirovohrad Oblast was not renamed because as such it is mentioned in the Constitution of Ukraine, and the Oblast can only be renamed by a constitutional amendment by the Verkhovna Rada.

On 20 June 2018, the Committee on State Building, Regional Policy and Local Self-Government of the Ukrainian parliament backed the proposal to rename Kirovohrad Oblast to Kropyvnytskyi Oblast. In February 2019, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine declared constitutional the bill on renaming Kirovohrad Oblast to Kropyvnytskyi Oblast. The renaming was supported by the local Oblast Council in March 2021. The process then stalled in the parliament, with the oblast council asking the Verkhovna Rada to speed up the process in September 2022.

==Points of interest==
The following sites were nominated for the Seven Wonders of Ukraine:
* Khutir Nadiia, outskirts of Mykolaivka village
The oblast also has a number of archaeological sites, such as Nebelivka site and Melgunov Kurgan.

==Administrative divisions==

Before the July 2020 reform, Kirovohrad Oblast was administratively subdivided into 21 raions (districts) as well as 4 cities (municipalities) which were directly subordinate to the oblast government: Oleksandriia, Svitlovodsk, Znamianka, and the administrative center of the oblast, Kropyvnytskyi.

==Demographics==
=== Language ===
According to the 2001 Ukrainian census, Ukrainian was the mother tongue of 88.9% of the population, for 10.0% it was Russian, and for 1.1% it was another language.

According to a survey &quot;Is the language (ir)relevant?&quot; (), which took place in Kirovohrad Oblast from 12 to 22 October 2023, 96.7% of respondents named Ukrainian as their mother tongue, while 2.6% named Russian as their mother tongue. In everyday life, 66.4% of respondents spoke Ukrainian, 29.4% spoke Surzhyk, and 3.4% spoke Russian.

===Age structure===
: &quot;0-14 years:&quot; 14.3% (male 72,646/female 68,970)
: &quot;15-64 years:&quot; 68.7% (male 324,698/female 355,058)
: &quot;65 years and over:&quot; 17.0% (male 55,718/female 111,666) (2013 official)

===Median age===
: &quot;total:&quot; 41.2 years 
: &quot;male:&quot; 37.7 years 
: &quot;female:&quot; 44.5 years (2013 official)

==Nomenclature==

Most of Ukraine&#x27;s oblasts are named after their capital cities, officially referred to as &quot;oblast centers&quot; (, translit. &quot;oblasnyi tsentr&quot;). The name of each oblast is a relative adjective, formed by adding a feminine suffix to the name of the respective center city: &quot;Kirovohrad&quot; was the former name of the center of the &quot;Kirovohrads’ka oblast’&quot; (Kirovohrad Oblast). Most oblasts are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix &quot;-shchyna&quot;, as is the case with the Kirovohrad Oblast, &quot;Kirovohradshchyna&quot;.

==History==

Historically, at various times, the territory was ruled either entirely or partly by Scythia, ancient Greeks, Old Great Bulgaria, Khazars, Kipchaks, the Mongol Empire, Lithuania, the Crimean Khanate, the Ottoman Empire, Poland, and Russia. Historic cities of greatest importance were ancient Olbia and the late medieval port city of Ochakiv. In the late 17th and 18th centuries the tripoint of three early modern great powers, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Ottoman Empire and Russia, was located at the site of the current second-largest city of Mykolaiv Oblast, Pervomaisk, a city formed by the merger of the former Polish town of Bohopol, Russian town of Olviopol and Ottoman village of Holta.

The oblast was established within Soviet Ukraine in 1937. During World War II, it was occupied by Germany in 1941–1944.
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian army invaded the province from Kherson Oblast, attacking as far northwest as Voznesensk. They were repulsed at Voznesensk, and their attempt to take Mykolaiv failed. From April 2022, almost all of the province was under Ukrainian control, apart from the extreme south-east and the Kinburn peninsula. When Russia annexed Kherson Oblast in September 2022, it incorporated the occupied areas of Mykolaiv Oblast. A Ukrainian military official announced a Russian withdrawal from Mykolaiv Oblast on 10 November 2022.

On 4–5 July 2022 during an international Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC 2022) in Lugano, Switzerland pledged to support the rebuilding of Mykolaiv region.

Most of Ukraine&#x27;s oblasts are named after their capital cities, officially referred to as &quot;oblast centers&quot; (, translit. &quot;oblasnyi tsentr&quot;). The name of each oblast is a relative adjective, formed by adding a feminine suffix to the name of respective center city: &quot;Rivne&quot; is the center of the &quot;Rivnens’ka oblast’&quot; (Rivne Oblast). Most oblasts are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix &quot;-shchyna&quot;, as is the case with the Rivne Oblast, &quot;Rivnenshchyna&quot;.

Before 1992, under the policy of Russification, the region was officially known under its Russian name of Rovno Oblast.

<text>Ternopil Oblast (), also referred to as Ternopilshchyna () or Ternopillia (), is an oblast (province) of Ukraine. Its administrative center is Ternopil, through which flows the Seret, a tributary of the Dniester. Population: 

One of the natural wonders of the region are its cave complexes. Although Ternopil Oblast is among the smallest regions in Ukraine, over 100 caves have been discovered there. Scientists believe these are only 20% of all possible caves in the region. The biggest cave is Optymistychna Cave. Measuring in total length, it is the longest cave in Eurasia and the fifth-longest in the world. Twenty percent of the land in the region is chernozem soil.

Among its attractions, Ternopil Oblast has 34 castles. By at least one account, the most prominent is the Zbarazh Castle with fortifications that expand over and was the center of a 17th-century standoff between troops of Bohdan Khmelnytsky and the army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Dniester Canyon passes through the oblast; it is considered one of the wonders of Ukraine, stretching for .

==Geography==

The oblast is located in Western Ukraine and has an area of . It is situated at the western part of the Podilian Upland, which is known for its rocky terrain. Among noticeable mountains there are the Kremenets Mountains. The oblast is also famous for its caves.

One of the major rivers in the country Dniester forms southern and southwestern borders of Ternopil Oblast with the adjacent Chernivtsi Oblast and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. Its tributaries that flow through the oblast include Zbruch, Seret, and Strypa among just a few of them. The Seret River (not to be confused with Siret nor Seret) is a left tributary of the Dniester flowing through the oblast administrative center, i.e. Ternopil.

Ternopil Oblast is one of two oblasts in West Ukraine that do not have an international border. It is surrounded by five other oblasts of Ukraine: Chernivtsi Oblast – to the south, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast – to the southwest, Lviv Oblast – to the northwest, Rivne Oblast – to the north, and Khmelnytskyi Oblast – to the east.

From the 12th century the area belonged to Galicia–Volhynia until Galicia–Volhynia was incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 14th century.

In 1569 Poland and Lithuania united into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

From the First Partition of Poland in 1772 until the end of World War I the area which would become Ternopil Oblast was mostly part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, a possession of the Habsburg Monarchy, Austrian Empire and finally Austria-Hungary. In Ukraine today, there are three oblasts (provinces) that largely formed the eastern part of Galicia and Lodomeria until 1918. Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast was entirely contained in the kingdom, as was the vast majority of Lviv Oblast (only a few small areas and villages near Sokal were not). The southern and central parts of Ternopil Oblast were within the kingdom while the northern parts (pre-2020 raions: Kremenets, Shumsk, Lanivtsi and the northern half of Zbarazh; post-2020: Kremenets Raion and small parts of Ternopil Raion) remained with Poland Lithuania; from 1795 (Third Partition) they belonged to the Russian Volhynian Governorate (specifically the Kremenetsky Uyezd). During the Napoleonic wars the area around Ternopil was annexed by Russia in the 1809 Treaty of Schönbrunn becoming the ; it was ceded back to Austria in 1815 (Congress of Vienna). The Tarnopolsky Krai roughly covered the eastern two-thirds of the post-2022 Ternopil Raion and the Chortkiv Raion up to the Strypa; in pre-2020 terms it corresponded with the cities of Ternopil and Chortkiv and the Borshchiv, Chortkiv, Husiatyn, Pidvolochysk, Terebovlia, Ternopil and Zalishchyky raions, the southern half of Zbarazh raion, the eastern and northern parts of Buchach raion and some eastern parts of Zboriv and Kozova raions.

From 1917 the formerly Russian part came under the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (Ukrainian State April–December 1918; also claimed by the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic of Soviets/Ukrainian Soviet Republic December 1917–April 1918 and the Ukrainian SSR from March 1919); from 1918 the formerly Austrian part was controlled by the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (nominally part of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic from 22 January 1919) but ultimately the whole area fell to the Second Polish Republic in 1921 following the Ukrainian War of Independence, Polish–Ukrainian War and Polish–Soviet War. The formerly Austrian parts became part of the Tarnopol Voivodeship, while the formerly Russian parts became part of the Volhynian Voivodeship, specifically the . The southern pre-2020 raions of Ternopil Oblast were partially coterminous with Galicia and Lodomeria&#x27;s districts/counties and Interwar Poland&#x27;s counties.

The oblast was created during the Second World War when both Nazi Germany and later the Soviet Union invaded Poland. Due to the Polish national policy in the area (Pacification action), many people favored the Soviet invasion of Eastern Galicia at first. However, soon thereafter, the Soviet security agencies started a witch hunt among nationally oriented members of Ukrainian resistance who emigrated to Poland after the Soviet-Ukrainian War as well as other reasons. Many of local population were exiled to Siberia regardless of their ethnic background. On December 4, 1939, the voivodeship division in the West Ukraine was abolished and replaced with the existing Soviet administrative division oblast. Ternopil Oblast (originally Tarnopol Oblast) was established based mostly on the Tarnopol Voivodeship and southern portions of the Volhynian Voivodeship.

During the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany, Ternopil became an object of fierce fighting between Soviet and German forces because of its importance as a rail transportation hub. During German occupation, the region (except for its Volhynian portion) became part of the District of Galicia and transferred to administration by the General Government. After the war, a destroyed residential section of Ternopil, near the river, was turned into an artificial lake rather than being rebuilt. Additionally, upon annexation to the Soviet Union&#x27;s Ukrainian SSR, most ethnic Poles in the region were forcibly relocated to Poland, whose national borders had shifted far to the west. The area of the former Polish voivodeship was expanded by adding territory in the north, though the westernmost parts were transferred to the Lviv oblast. After 1945 Soviet authorities also encouraged ethnic Russians to settle in territories newly annexed to the Soviet Union, including the Ternopil oblast, though western Ukraine remained considerably less Russian than eastern Ukraine.

As Ukraine achieved independence in the 1990s, western Ukraine remained the heartland of Ukrainian political and cultural nationalism, and the political affiliations of Ternopil voters reflected that viewpoint. In the first elections after independence, the People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine was the leading party in the oblast. A majority of oblast voters supported the Ukrainian nationalist-oriented Electoral Bloc Yuliya Tymoshenko in the 2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election. Over 88% of voters supported Yulia Tymoshenko of the All-Ukrainian Union &quot;Fatherland&quot; in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election.

By 2005, the population of the oblast had grown to roughly 225,000, consisting primarily of ethnic Ukrainians with a large Russian or Russian-speaking minority. The city of Ternopil has important institutions of higher education, including two teacher&#x27;s colleges, an international medical school with instruction in English, and one of three economics institutes in Ukraine.
The religion of the majority is Ukrainian Greek Catholic, though there is a notable Orthodox presence and a small Protestant minority. Many churches which were closed or destroyed under Soviet rule have rebuilt since independence. The local Jewish community, which was very large before 1939, disappeared in the Holocaust and was not reestablished after 1945. There are no active synagogues in the oblast and only a few isolated individuals affiliating with the Jewish faith.

==Points of interest==
The oblast is known for its castles and fortresses. Due to the underfunding of the state program for the preservation of cultural heritage, many of objects of historical significance are in poor condition.

<text>Vinnytsia Oblast (, ), also referred to as Vinnychchyna (), is an oblast in central Ukraine. Its administrative center is Vinnytsia. The oblast has a population of 

==History==
Vinnytsia Oblast, first established on February 27, 1932, originally comprised raions (regions) of the following former okruhas of Ukraine (districts of Soviet Ukraine):
* Uman Okruha
* Berdychiv Okruha
* Vinnytsia Okruha
* Mohyliv Okruha
* Tulchyn Okruha
* Shepetivka Okruha
* Proskuriv Okruha
* Kamianets Okruha

In 1935 bordering territories of the oblast were transformed into Soviet border districts: Shepetivka Okrug, Proskuriv Okrug, and Kamianets Okrug. In 1937 the Kamianets Oblast, based on the border districts, was formed (it later became Khmelnytsky Oblast).

During World War II the occupying Axis powers split the territory of Vinnytsia Oblast between the General District Shitomir (Zhytomyr in Reichskommissariat Ukraine) and the Transnistria Governorate of the Kingdom of Romania.
In October 1941 the Romanians established a concentration camp in the oblast, it detained mostly Jews.

==Geography==

The oblast is located in the historic regions of Podolia and Right-bank Ukraine and borders seven other administrative oblasts of Ukraine. Along the southwest of the oblast the Dniester river passes. A long section of the state border with Moldova.

The Vinnytsia oblast has appreciable mineral deposits and other exploitable raw materials. There are 1,159 deposits and other various mineral resources, tens of peat deposits, unique deposits of granite and kaolin, garnet and fluorite that have been explored. The raw kaolin deposits are the world largest, containing 800 million tons. Furthermore, a number of medicinal mineral springs have been found in the oblast, with health benefits comparable to the radon springs found in the town of Khmilnyk.

The unique decorative qualities of Vinnytsia&#x27;s granites, sorbites, vinnytsites, and charnockites are used to manufacture stone, facing slabs, window sills, monuments, etc. Three granite deposits (consisting of 10 million cubic metres; 13 million cubic yards) have been explored and are mined, and experimental mining is carried out in eight other deposits. Multiple enterprises have been utilizing these resources for more than a century. 

The Vinnytsia oblast is the only oblast of Ukraine containing large pelicanite resources (39 deposits with the total inferred resources of about 170 million tons).

The lignite, commonly known as brown coal, found in Vinnytsia is similar in quality to the well-known lignite of Dniprobas and can be used for energy purposes utilizing the semi-coking and hydrogenation methods. Three lignite deposits in the oblast, containing about 50 million tons, have been preliminarily explored and an additional three deposits are in the exploration stage.

The building materials industry widely uses local sand and gravel. There are five sand deposits, all of which are exploited, of which one is used for silicate bricks, three for building mortars and one for ballast.

The town of Khmilnyk in Vinnytsia is home to a popular radon mineral spring, whose therapeutic properties have been ascertained and utilized for numerous health benefits. Also 21 table water springs have been prospected, ten of which have been certified and at five filling has already been arranged (&quot;Rehina&quot;, &quot;Kniazhna&quot;, &quot;Shumylivska&quot;, &quot;Podilska&quot; and &quot;Rosiana&quot;). Also, &quot;Myrhorodska&quot; type mineral water has been found. It is probable that there are many more radon deposits in the oblast that, once found, can be exploited.

Bauxite, the ore used aluminum manufacturing, has recently been discovered in Podolia. Geologists estimate that this deposit contains about 3 million tons of ore.

==Historical sites==

The old historical castles in Bar attract a big number of domestic visitors and foreign tourists every year, including: 
* St. Pokrovsky Orthodox Church;
* St. Anna Roman Catholic Cathedral;
* St. Pokrovsky Monastery;
* Old Fortress.

The city of Bar is a popular tourist location because it is where the mathematician Viktor Bunyakovsky was born.

The following sites were nominated for the Seven Wonders of Ukraine.
* The Villa of Mykola Pyrogov
* Nemyriv Scythian settlement
* Ancient Slavic cave temple (Bushi relief)

The Podillya&#x27;s folk icon-painting tradition is well known in Ukraine. Its manifestation are long home iconostases painted on canvas in the end of the 19th - beginning of the 20th cc. Red, green and yellow colours are prevailing, the faces of the saints depicted are a little bit long, their eyes are almond-like. On these iconostases, the most worshipped family saints were painted. The collections of Podillya&#x27;s folk iconostases are possessed by Vynnytsya Art Museum and The Museum of Ukrainian Home Icons in the Radomysl Castle.
There are several palaces in the province, the most notable in Tulchyn, Voronovytsia, Khmilnyk, Nemyriv and Cherniatyn.

72 machine building enterprises are specialized in manufacture of products in 12 industrial sectors, the main of which are electrical engineering, machine tool and toolmaking, instrument engineering, bearing, tractor and farm machinery industries. The Vinnytsia oblast&#x27;s machine building products include metal cutting tools, pumps, rolling bearings, water, gas and heat flow meters, electric motors, electric spindles, computer facilities, production equipment for processing industries, farm machinery for plant growing and animal husbandry, integrated circuits, semiconductor and vacuum electronic devices, high economy luminescent lamps, stereoanagraphs, scales, automobile lifters, mills, milking equipment, etc.

The share of consumer goods output in the oblast in their total production in Ukraine is of 5.7% (1996). They are manufactured by 359 enterprises.

The oblast specializes in production of foodstuffs. The total output of consumer goods in 1996 made 81.1%, domestic and recreational purpose goods 9.0% and light industry products 6.4%.

In the output of consumer foodstuffs in 1996 the Vinnytsia oblast was the second and of non food goods took the 11th place among the oblasts of Ukraine.

Main positions in the structure of production of domestic and recreational goods are held by products manufactured at enterprises of the machine building complex, chemical and defense industries: complex domestic facilities, small mechanization means for household plots and small holdings, domestic chemistry goods.

Among the light industry enterprises is of great use concluding agreements with foreign firms to manufacture goods from the raw material supplied by the customer of the products. Cooperation with firms of Germany, USA, Slovakia, Czech, Hungary, India and others has been established. In 1996 the Vinnytsia joint-stock company &quot;Podillia&quot;, public joint stock company &quot;Khmilnyk Garment Factory &#x27;Lileia&#x27;&quot;, Vinnytsia public joint stock company &quot;Volodarka&quot;, joint stock company &quot;Tulchin Garment Factory&quot; and others worked on raw materials supplied by the foreign firm&#x27;s customers.

The electric power generating capacity of power plants at the oblast&#x27;s territory is 10,523,400 kWh per year. At present, they are under loaded. The electric power generation in 1996 produced 3,548 kWh, while its consumption in the same year was 5,041,000 kWh.

The oblast has 39 sugar factories and 13 distilleries. A quite good base for processing sunflower seeds and groats crops has been formed.

===Agriculture===

The total farmland area is 19,605 square kilometres (7570 sq. mi.); of them, arable lands occupy 16,940 km² (6540 sq. mi.), and perennial plantations, 512 km² (198 sq. mi.).

As of 1 January 1997 in the oblast there were functioning 749 collective agricultural enterprises, 56 state farms of all systems, 25 inter farm agricultural enterprises, and 818 private (peasant&#x27;s) farms.

Agricultural enterprises of all forms of ownership are primarily specialized in growing of cereal crops and sugar beets, the animal husbandry, meat and milk production. In the overall structure of sown areas, winter wheat crops occupy 18%, barley 14% and sugar beets 10%.

In 1996 the oblast produced 7% of grain, 14.3% of sugar beets, 7.5% of fruits and berries, 6.1% of meat in live weight, 5.4% of milk and 4.0% of eggs of their total production in Ukraine.

===Transport and Communications===

Three trunk pipelines cross the oblast&#x27;s territory: Urengoi-Pomary-Uzhhorod, &quot;Soiuz&quot; and Dashava-Kyiv. 3,299.8 km (2050 miles) of gas distributing networks are in service. It was planned to put of gas networks in operation in 1997.

===Foreign Economic Relations===

In 1996 enterprises and organizations of the oblast executed foreign trade operations with partners from 73 countries of the world. The total foreign trade volume for this period made $397,500,000, including export ($280,900,000) and import ($116,600,000), which resulted in positive balance ($164,300,000).

The oblast&#x27;s foreign trade with CIS and Baltic countries in this time reached 58.2% of the total foreign trade turnover. The largest export deliveries are to the Russian Federation (42.6%), Belarus (5.4%), Belgium (7.2%) and Germany (7.45%).

No considerable changes have taken place in the structure of commodity exports. As before, leading in this field are the food industry (47.5%), light industry (14.18%), machine building (10.96%), chemical industry (5.09%) and agriculture (6.36%).

Enterprises of the Vinnytsia oblast seek to import urgently needed products which are in short supply. Main items of import in 1996 were mineral fertilizers (2.68%), petroleum products (10.27%), equipment (11.63%), surface transport facilities (3.82%), inorganic chemistry products, electrical machines, fabrics and yarn.

Taking into account main lines of production, considerable quantities of farm machinery and equipment for processing and building materials industries are brought to its territory. Owing to this agricultural enterprises of the oblast managed in 1996 to perform a full range of fieldwork and obtained a good harvest of cereal and industrial crops.

At the same time large quantities of products that are not in demand of population as well as goods manufactured in sufficient quantities by the oblast&#x27;s enterprises are brought to the oblast. Moreover, a considerable amount of valuable raw leather is brought out on so called &quot;tolling&quot; terms in exchange of poor quality semi manufactures, footwear, leather jackets, etc.

Of special concern is the fact that enterprises of the oblast are steeply reducing import of the equipment, spare parts, completing items, while import of alcoholic drinks, juices, and other low grade consumer goods is rising. As shown by calculations, the oblast, having a considerable export/import potential, has real opportunities through an effective use of the foreign trade to increase revenues both of the local and of the state budget and to provide itself with the necessary &quot;critical&quot; products.

The oblast&#x27;s enterprises seek to attract foreign investments for increasing the output of products. Since 1991 till December 1997 about 300 joint enterprises with foreign investments amounting to $23,300,000 were established in the Vinnytsia oblast. Enterprises and citizens from 41 countries of the world participated in organization of the enterprises. The largest amount of investments came from the United States, Germany, Poland, Israel and some other countries.

Oblast is one of the founding members of Euroregion Dniester.

==Nomenclature==

Most of Ukraine&#x27;s oblasts are named after their capital cities, officially referred to as &quot;oblast centers&quot; (, translit. &quot;oblasnyi tsentr&quot;). The name of each oblast is a relative adjective, formed by adding a feminine suffix to the name of respective center city: &quot;Vinnytsia&quot; is the center of the &quot;Vinnyts&#x27;ka oblast&quot;&#x27; (Vinnytsia Oblast). Most oblasts are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix &quot;-shchyna&quot; or &quot;chyna&quot;, as is the case with the Vinnytsia Oblast, &quot;Vinnychchyna&quot;.

<text>Zaporizhzhia Oblast (), commonly referred to as Zaporizhzhia (), is an oblast (region) in south-east Ukraine. Its administrative centre is Zaporizhzhia. The oblast covers an area of , and has a population of 

This oblast is an important part of Ukraine&#x27;s industry and agriculture. Most of the area of the oblast has been under Russian military occupation since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, including all of the coast, although the capital and the majority of the population remains under Ukrainian administration.

On 30 September 2022, Russia declared it had annexed the Donetsk (Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic), Luhansk (Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic), Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, despite having failed to occupy all of these Ukrainian territories. However, the disputed referendums and subsequent annexations are not internationally recognized.

To the south, Zaporizhzhia Oblast covers roughly of coastline of the Sea of Azov, as part of a coastal region known as Pryazovia, also including the coastal regions of Kherson Oblast and Donetsk Oblast, to the west and east, respectively.

==Geography==
The area of the oblast is 27,183 km2; its population (estimated as of 1 January 2013) was 1,785,243.

Donetsk Oblast is located within the regions of Zaporizhzhia (northern part) and Pryazovia (southern part).

=== Cities ===
The largest cities by priority:

# Zaporizhzhia
# Melitopol – under Russian occupation
# Berdiansk – under Russian occupation
# Enerhodar (location of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant) – under Russian occupation
# Tokmak – under Russian occupation
# Polohy – under Russian occupation
# Dniprorudne – under Russian occupation
# Vilniansk
# Orikhiv
# Huliaipole
# Vasylivka – under Russian occupation

=== Relief ===
Zaporizhzhia Oblast is characterized by a flat landscape. Soils are mostly chernozem. Knowledge of the relief of the Zaporizhzhia Oblast today is especially important because of the problem of land reclamation and its more intensive use.

The territory of Zaporizhzhia Oblast as a whole has a flat topography, but there are markedly elevated and depressed areas, which differ in shape, origin, and age.

The highest central-eastern part of the oblast is the Azov Upland. It extends to the east and to the territory of Donetsk Oblast, where it meets the Donetsk ridge. In the south, between the Azov Upland and the Sea of Azov, is the western part of the Azov coastal plain, which flows into the Black Sea west of the Molochna River. The northeastern end of the coastal plain merges with the Zaporizhzhia inner plain, which borders the southeastern outskirts of the Dnieper Upland. Thus, the territory of Zaporizhzhia Oblast consists of two distinct geomorphological parts: the outskirts of the Azov and Dnipro uplands, which structurally correspond to the southeastern part of the Ukrainian crystalline massif and the outskirts of the coastal Pryazov and Black Sea plains, which are located within the Black Sea basin.

==History==
The area corresponding approximately to the modern Zaporizhzhia Oblast—according to Herodotus—was called in antiquity as the land of Gerrhos. This area was the burial place of the kings of the &quot;Royal Scythians&quot;.

Historically, at various times, the territory was ruled either entirely or partly by Scythia, Old Great Bulgaria, Khazars, the Mongol Empire, Lithuania, the Crimean Khanate, Poland, and Russia. Khortytsia, former fortress of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, is located in the province. In 1917–1920 the territory passed subsequently between the Bolsheviks, Ukrainians, White Russians, Makhnovists, the Bolsheviks once again, White Russians once again, and eventually fell to the Bolsheviks in late 1920.

The modern Zaporizhzhia Oblast was created as part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on 10 January 1939 out of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

During the 1991 Ukrainian independence referendum, 90.66% of votes in the oblast were in favor of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine.

=== Russian invasion ===
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian armed forces occupied the southern part of the oblast, defeating the Ukrainian armed forces at Melitopol and at Enerhodar. Ukrainian forces conducted an attack that destroyed a Russian ship and damaged two others in the port of Berdiansk. the northern parts of the oblast, including its capital city, Zaporizhzhia, are controlled by Ukraine.

On 4–5 July 2022 during the international Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC 2022) hosted in the Swiss city Lugano, the Czech Republic, Finland and Sweden pledged to support the rebuilding of Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

On 23–27 September 2022, the Russian Federation held a referendum in the occupied territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts for &quot;independence and subsequent entry into the Russian Federation&quot;. These referendums are recognized by most states to be staged and against international law. On 29 September 2022, the Russian Federation recognized Zaporizhzhia Oblast as an independent state. On 30 September, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of the Zaporizhzhia Oblast and three other Ukrainian territories, and signed &quot;accession decrees&quot; that are widely considered to be illegal. At that time, Russia was only in control of about 70% of the province as a whole. The United Nations General Assembly subsequently passed a resolution calling on countries not to recognise what it described as an &quot;attempted illegal annexation&quot; and demanded that Russia &quot;immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw&quot;.

==Points of interest==
The following sites were nominated for the Seven Wonders of Ukraine.
* Kamyana Mohyla, prehistoric &quot;Stone Tomb&quot; site (museum-preserve)
* Khortytsia, island in the River Dnieper
* Dnieper Hydroelectric Station

==Subdivisions==

Following the reforms of 2020, the oblast is divided into five new raions, which is reduced from 25. The system of municipalities (cities of regional significance) that were directly subordinate to the oblast government was discontinued. All populated places were subordinated to raion (district) government.

===Russian occupation===

Since March of 2022, the armed forces of the Russian Federation control bigger portion of the Zaporizhia Oblast. The city of Melitopol is serving as a temporary administration center for the occupied territories. Frontlines stretch through Vasylivka and Polohy raions and just north of both cities of Vasylivka and Polohy.

==Demographics==
According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census, the population of the oblast was 1,929,171. Some 70.8% considered themselves Ukrainians, while 24.7% were Russians, the rest nationalities were Bulgarians (1.4%), Belarusians (0.7%), and others (1.6%). Almost half the population (48.2%) considered the Russian language their native.

== Education ==

679 daytime and 11 evening state schools plus 6 daytime schools that are non-budget supported secondary schools involved 271,400 pupils in 2001. 22 classical schools, 8 lyceums, a Sichovy collegium and 54 education-breeding complex bodies aren&#x27;t out of reach to gifted children. New style 38 complex kindergarten-schools work too.

Over 60,000 children develop their talents through out-of-school institutions. They attend 30 creative centres, 6 science-technical stations and four young naturalists&#x27; stations, five tourist clubs, three training flotillas, 11 children&#x27;s sports clubs and 20 sports schools. The extra-scholastic education system has such a unique body as the Small Academy of Science. Boys and girls work there in six main disciplines: physics-mathematics, chemistry-biology, history-geography, philology, industrial and information technologies. The Small Academy young members maintain close friendly relations with scientists of big institutes and universities. 26 youngsters became winners of the All-Ukrainian Academy contest, so the Zaporizhzhia oblast team gained the 1st place.

325 secondary schools, five classical schools, a collegium, and three comprehensive schools use the Ukrainian language. Nevertheless, the minorities have a free choice—193 schools are Russian, a large Jewish school «Alef» works in Zaporizhzhia and smaller ones exist in other points, a Ukrainian-Bulgarian Lyceum is in Primorsky district. The Greek, Czech, Bulgarian languages are very popular in Yakimivsky, Berdyansky, Priazovsky and Melitopole rural districts. One may learn Hebrew, Yiddish, German, Polish, Tatar and other languages attending option courses anywhere.

Specialists keep on looking for an adaptive school model. 26 institutions develop the humanization process using new teaching technologies. The Khortitsky multi-profile teaching-rehabilitation centre has worked out methods for complete support of sanatorium-boarding-schools&#x27; children. Berdiansk is the town where a regional boarding school for orphans works out active socialization programs.

42 institutions provide vocational education. This system distributes well-trained workers to regional industries and businesses. The list of specialties includes over 100 names. Vocational schools give courses for improving qualifications in cooperation with unemployment centres. More than 1,500 jobless persons get new professions every year due to it.

The higher education system is the most flexible and advanced. Today, 25 state-controlled technical colleges have I-II class rank and 8 higher institutions have III-IV class certificates. These are the university and the Zaporizhzhia Politechnic, the Medical University and the Institute of Law with Ministry of Internal Affairs in Zaporizhzhia City, the Pedagogical University, the Agricultural Academy in Melitopol and the Pedagogical Institute in Berdiansk. There are also five higher-education private bodies—the Institute of Economics and Information Technologies, the State and Municipal Government Institute and the others. Over 65,000 people are students in this oblast. There are 212 Doctors of Science and 1,420 Candidates of Science among their lecturers. The city of Zaporizhzhia is one of the biggest centres for foreigners&#x27; education in Ukraine.

The International Astronomical Union named two minor planets 5936 Khadzhinov and 19082 Vikchernov in honor of Ukrainians from Zaporizhizhia Oblast who made a significant contribution in science and education.

== Economics ==
=== Gross regional product ===
The volume of the gross regional product (GRP) of the oblast in 2016 amounted to ₴104,323 million (9th place among the regions). The total contribution of the oblast to the GRP of Ukraine was 4.4%.

<doc id="494944" wikidata="Q11249980" url="?curid=494944" title="Rose of Sharon">
<text>Rose of Sharon (in Hebrew: חֲבַצֶּלֶת הַשָּׁרוֹן) is a biblical expression, though the identity of the plant referred to is unclear and is disputed among biblical scholars. It has become a common name for several species of flowering plants that are valued in different parts of the world. In no case does it refer to actual roses. The name&#x27;s varied colloquial application has been used as an example of the lack of precision of common names, which can potentially cause confusion. &quot;Rose of Sharon&quot; has become a frequently used catch phrase in poetry and lyrics.
==Biblical origins==
The name &quot;Rose of Sharon&quot; first appears in Hebrew in the Tanakh. In the Shir Hashirim (&#x27;Song of Songs&#x27;) 2:1, the speaker (the beloved) says, &quot;I am the rose of Sharon, a rose of the valley&quot;. The Hebrew phrase was translated by the editors of the King James Version (KJV) as &quot;rose of Sharon&quot;; however, previous translations had rendered it simply as &quot;the flower of the field&quot; (Septuagint , Vulgate , Wycliffe &quot;a flower of the field&quot;). Contrariwise, the Hebrew word occurs two times in the scriptures: in the Song, and in Isaiah 35:1, which reads, &quot;the desert shall bloom like the rose.&quot; The word is translated &quot;rose&quot; in the KJV, but is rendered variously as &quot;lily&quot; (Septuagint , Vulgate , Wycliffe &quot;lily&quot;), &quot;jonquil&quot; (Jerusalem Bible) and &quot;crocus&quot; (RSV).

Varying scholars have suggested that the biblical &quot;rose of Sharon&quot; may be one of the following plants:

* A crocus: &quot;a kind of crocus growing as a lily among the brambles&quot; (&quot;Sharon&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bible Dictionary&quot;) or a crocus that grows in the coastal plain of Sharon (&quot;New Oxford Annotated Bible&quot;);
* A tulip: &quot;a bright red tulip-like flower[...] today prolific in the hills of Sharon&quot; &quot;rose&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bible Dictionary&quot;);
** &quot;Tulipa agenensis&quot;, the Sharon tulip, a species of tulip suggested by a few botanists, or;
** &quot;Tulipa montana&quot;
* A lily: &quot;Lilium candidum&quot;, more commonly known as the Madonna lily, a species of lily suggested by some botanists, though likely in reference to the lilies of the valley mentioned in the second part of Song of Solomon 2:1.
* Narcissus (&quot;rose&quot;, &quot;Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological and Ecclesiastical Literature&quot;)

According to an annotation of &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; 2:1 by the translation committee of the New Revised Standard Version, &quot;rose of Sharon&quot; is a mistranslation of a more general Hebrew word for crocus.

Etymologists have tentatively linked the biblical to the words , meaning &#x27;bulb&#x27;, and , which is understood as meaning either &#x27;pungent&#x27; or &#x27;splendid&#x27; (&quot;The Analytical Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon&quot;).

A possible interpretation for the biblical reference is &quot;Pancratium maritimum&quot;, which blooms in the late summer just above the high-tide mark. The modern Hebrew name for this flower is or ( or , coastal lily). Some identify this flower with the &quot;rose of Sharon&quot; mentioned in the Song of Songs, but not all scholars accept this.

Recently, some scholars have translated as &#x27;a budding bulb&#x27; in consideration of the genealogical research of multilingual versions and lexicons.

==Modern usage==
The name &quot;rose of Sharon&quot; is also commonly applied to several horticultural plants, all originating outside the Levant and not likely to have been the plant from the Bible:

* &quot;Hypericum calycinum&quot;, the usual plant known by this name in British English. It is an evergreen flowering shrub native to southeast Europe and southwest Asia.
* &quot;Hibiscus syriacus&quot;, the usual plant known by this name in North America. It is a deciduous flowering shrub native to east Asia, and the national flower of South Korea (also known as &quot;Mugunghwa&quot; and &quot;Althaea&quot;).
* &quot;Hibiscus rosa-sinensis&quot; (var. &#x27;Vulcan&#x27;), the national flower of Malaysia.

==As a human name==
Rose of Sharon, pronounced &quot;Rosasharn,&quot; is occasionally a personal name. Most famously, a character named Rose of Sharon Joad appears in John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.

<doc id="494965" wikidata="Q300495" url="?curid=494965" title="Bathtub hoax">
<text>The bathtub hoax was a famous hoax perpetrated by the American journalist H. L. Mencken involving the publication of a fictitious history of the bathtub. 

== Content of hoax ==
On December 28, 1917, an article titled &quot;A Neglected Anniversary&quot; by H. L. Mencken was published in the &quot;New York Evening Mail&quot;. Mencken claimed that the actual anniversary of the first American bathtub, the alleged 75th, had gone unnoticed the previous week. This was supposedly in spite of the fact that the Public Health Service of Washington, D.C., had prepared for celebrations several months prior, which were ultimately quashed by the intervening enactment of Prohibition in that city.

The article claimed that the bathtub had been invented by Lord John Russell of England in 1828, and that Cincinnatian Adam Thompson became acquainted with it during business trips there in the 1830s. Thompson allegedly went back to Cincinnati and took the first bath in the United States on December 20, 1842. The invention purportedly aroused great controversy in Cincinnati, with detractors claiming that its expensive nature was undemocratic and local doctors claiming it was dangerous. This debate was said to have spread across the nation, with an ordinance banning bathing between November and March supposedly narrowly failing in Philadelphia and a similar ordinance allegedly being effective in Boston between 1845 and 1862. After Brooklynite John F. Simpson was claimed to have invented the zinc tub in 1847, the price of bathtubs was said to have plummeted and much of the criticism against them was said to have abated. Around the same time, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. was claimed to have campaigned for the bathtub against remaining medical opposition in Boston; the American Medical Association supposedly granted sanction to the practice in 1850, followed by practitioners of homeopathy in 1853.

According to the article, then-Vice President Millard Fillmore visited the Thompson bathtub in March 1850 and having bathed in it became a proponent of bathtubs. Upon his accession to the presidency in July of that year, Fillmore was said to have ordered the construction of a bathtub in the White House, which allegedly refueled the controversy of providing the president with indulgences not enjoyed by George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. Nevertheless, the effect of the bathtub&#x27;s installation was said to have obliterated any remaining opposition, such that it was said that every hotel in New York had a bathtub by 1860. Fillmore&#x27;s bathtub was said to have remained in operation until the first administration of Grover Cleveland, when it was supposedly replaced by a bathtub that was still in operation at the time of the article&#x27;s publication.

==Legacy==
Mencken grew concerned of people taking his article seriously, comparing it in acceptance to the Norman conquest.

In 1949 Mencken wrote:

The success of this idle hoax, done in time of war, when more serious writing was impossible, vastly astonished me. It was taken gravely by a great many other newspapers, and presently made its way into medical literature and into standard reference books. It had, of course, no truth in it whatsoever, and I more than once confessed publicly that it was only a jocosity ... Scarcely a month goes by that I do not find the substance of it reprinted, not as foolishness but as fact, and not only in newspapers but in official documents and other works of the highest pretensions.
Fillmore&#x27;s birthplace of Moravia, New York, has annual &quot;Fillmore Days&quot; where people race in modified bathtubs. After a 20-year hiatus the Fillmore Days were revived in 2019.

<text>The National Council of the Slovak Republic (, abbreviated to &quot;NR SR&quot;) is the national parliament of Slovakia. It is unicameral and consists of 150 members, who are elected by universal suffrage under proportional representation with seats distributed via largest remainder method with Hagenbach-Bischoff quota every four years.

Slovakia&#x27;s parliament has been called the &#x27;National Council&#x27; since 1 October 1992. From 1969 to 1992, its predecessor, the parliament of the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia, was called the Slovak National Council ().

The National Council approves domestic legislation, constitutional laws, and the annual budget. Its consent is required to ratify international treaties, and is responsible for approving military operations. It also elects individuals to some positions in the executive and judiciary, as specified by law.

The parliament building is in Bratislava, Slovakia&#x27;s capital, next to Bratislava Castle in Alexander Dubček Square.

==Functions==
The 150-seat unicameral National Council of the Slovak Republic is Slovakia&#x27;s sole constitutional and legislative body. It considers and approves the constitution, constitutional amendments, and other legislation. It approves the state budget. It elects some officials specified by law, as well as justices of the Constitutional Court and the prosecutor general. Prior to their ratification, the parliament also should approve all important international treaties. Moreover, it gives consent for dispatching of military forces outside of Slovakia&#x27;s territory and for the presence of foreign military forces on the territory of the Slovak Republic.

==Decision-making==
The parliament may vote only if a majority of all its members (76) are present. To pass a decision, the approval of a simple majority of all MPs present is required. Almost all legal acts can be adopted by this relative majority. An absolute majority (76 votes) is required to pass a vote of no-confidence in the cabinet or its members, or to elect and recall the Council&#x27;s speaker or the deputy speakers. A qualified majority of 3/5 of all deputies (at least 90 votes) is required for the adoption of a constitution or a constitutional statute.

== Committees of the National Council ==
Standing committees and current leadership are listed below.

==Speakers==
The National Council of the Slovak Republic currently has no speaker. The last speaker, Peter Pellegrini, lost his mandate upon being elected to the presidency on April 7, 2024. Since then Deputy Speaker Peter Žiga has been acting speaker.

==Structure of former legislatures==
The length of the bars underneath represents each party&#x27;s electoral performance. The difference in the total width of the bars is due to the election threshold of 5%; this threshold prevents a varying number of small parties from entering the National Council (most notably, after the 1994 election).

==Elections==
Members of the parliament are elected directly for a 4-year term, under the proportional system. Although the suffrage is universal, only a citizen who has the right to vote, has attained 18 years of age and has permanent residency in the Slovak Republic is eligible to be elected. Similarly to the Netherlands and Israel, the whole country forms one multi-member constituency. The election threshold is 5%. Voters may indicate their preferences within the semi-open list. Parliamentary elections were last held in 2023.

==Buildings==
The main parliament building is situated next to the Bratislava Castle on the castle hill. The building is insufficiently large to accommodate all officials and representatives. The construction started in 1986 when Slovakia was part of Czechoslovakia as a building for the Federal Parliament, which usually met in Prague. The secondary parliament building, the Zhupa house, which was the main building until 1994, is situated at Župné square next to the Trinitarian Church below the castle hill in Bratislava.

<text>Gabriel Francis Marshall Thomson (born 27 October 1986) is an English actor, best known for his role as Michael Harper in the British situation comedy series &quot;My Family&quot;.

==Career==
Thomson began his acting career at the age of four, performing in plays with a company called &quot;the Goliards&quot; while his family holidayed in Devon. At the age of five, he gave his first TV performance in an advert for &quot;Frosties&quot; which he later said he&#x27;d &quot;rather forget.&quot; In 1995, he appeared in a television version of &quot;The Bible: Joseph&quot;. He followed this up with a small role in another television mini-series called &quot;Painted Lady&quot;.

It was in 1999 that Thomson secured his first major acting role, playing Young Pip in a BBC adaption of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. It was through his role on &quot;Painted Lady&quot; that he was cast in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, as the casting director of &quot;Painted Lady&quot; thought he would be perfect as Pip. The same year, Thomson made his big screen debut as he had replaced Jonathan Taylor Thomas&#x27; live-action and voice role as Pinocchio in &quot;The New Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;.

From 2000 until 2011, Thomson played Michael Harper in the British BBC sitcom &quot;My Family&quot;, starring alongside Robert Lindsay, Zoë Wanamaker, Daniela Denby-Ashe and Kris Marshall. He is the only one out of the Harper children to have appeared in every series as Daniela Denby-Ashe left the series in 2002, later returning in 2004 and Kris Marshall left the series in 2005. He is also remembered for acting alongside Jude Law, Rachel Weisz and Ed Harris in the 2001 film &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; as Soviet spy Sasha Filippov.

He was at one time rumoured to play Harry Potter in the series of films based on the popular books by J.K. Rowling; however, just days later Warner Brothers announced that the part was to be portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe.

Thomson portrayed Lysander in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and Claudio in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; with the British Shakespeare Company on their 2009 tour of the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Norway and the Czech Republic.

Also starred in the British film &quot;13Hrs&quot;. In 2010, Gabriel joined the cast of GB Theatre Company, playing Orlando in &quot;As You Like It&quot; and Dr Caius in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;. The tour included the Republic of Ireland, Norway, the Czech Republic and the UK.

Gabriel also starred in the film, &quot;The Lost Choices&quot;, released by Metrodome in the UK on 14 September 2015.

On 20 August 2015, Thomson had announced on his Facebook page that he was leaving acting to return to university, and on 15 September the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that he was to attend King&#x27;s College in London for three years to study for a degree in philosophy, with the aim of becoming a human rights lawyer.

In 2017 he returned to acting

<text>Wyandot (also Wyandotte, Wendat, Quendat or Huron) is the Iroquoian language traditionally spoken by the people known as Wyandot or Wyandotte, descended from the Tionontati. It is considered a sister to the Wendat language, spoken by descendants of the Huron-Wendat Confederacy. It was last spoken, before its revival, by members located primarily in Oklahoma, United States, and Quebec, Canada. Linguists have traditionally considered Wyandot as a dialect or modern form of Wendat, even though the two are no longer mutually intelligible.

Wyandot essentially died out as a spoken language with the death of the last native speaker in 1972, though there are now attempts at revitalization:
*The Wyandotte Nation is offering Wyandot language classes in the Wyandotte Public Schools grades K–4, at the Wyandotte Nation&#x27;s preschool &quot;Turtle-Tots&quot; program in Oklahoma and has created online language lessons for self-study.
*The Huron-Wendat Nation of Quebec is offering adult and children&#x27;s classes in the Wendat language at its village school in Wendake.

==History==
===Relationship to Wendat===
Although linguistics have equated with or seen as a dialect of the Iroquoian Wendat (Huron), Wyandot became so differentiated as to be considered a distinct language. This change appears to have happened sometime between the mid-18th century, when the Jesuit missionary Pierre Potier (1708–1781) documented the Petun dialect of Wendat in Canada, and the mid-nineteenth century. By the time the ethnographer Marius Barbeau made his transcriptions of the Wyandot language in Wyandotte, Oklahoma, in 1911–1912, it had diverged enough to be considered a separate language.

Significant differences between Wendat and Wyandot in diachronic phonology, pronominal prefixes, and lexicon challenge the traditional view that Wyandot is modern Wendat. History suggests the roots of this language are complex; the ancestors of the Wyandot were refugees from various Huronian tribes who banded together to form one tribe. After being displaced from their ancestral home in Canada on Georgian Bay, the group traveled south, first to Ohio and later to Kansas and Oklahoma. As many members of this group were Petun, some scholars have suggested that Wyandot is more influenced by Petun than by its descent from Wendat.

The work of Barbeau was used by linguist Craig Kopris to reconstruct Wyandot; he developed a grammar and dictionary of the language. This work represents the most comprehensive research done on the Wyandot language as spoken in Oklahoma just prior to its extinction (or its dormancy as modern tribal members refer to it).

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
The phonemic inventory of the consonants is written by using the orthography used by Kopris in his analysis, which was based on Barbeau&#x27;s transcriptions. The orthographic symbol is written in angled brackets where it differs from the IPA. Kopris listed places of articulation for the consonants but noted that the distinction had not been made by Barbeau. 

 is placed in parentheses because it appears as an allophone of in nearly all cases, but that cannot always explain its presence. The presence of a single voiced stop, , contrasting with the voiceless stop , makes Wyandot unusual among Iroquoian languages, as it is the only one with a phonemic voicing distinction. The sound is pronounced as rather than , according to researchers who phonetically transcribed directly from fluent speakers and described it as &quot;corresponding to the English &quot;r&quot;&quot; and as &quot;the smooth English sound, never vibrant.&quot; The Wyandot and are both cognate with in other Northern Iroquoian languages. Although the two largely appear to be in free variation, they clearly contrast in some cases (as in the minimal pairs and . The ambiguity of the relationship between and seems to indicate that the two are in the process of a phonemic split that was not yet complete by the early 20th century.

Another unique feature of Wyandot is the presence of the voiced fricative , creating an - contrast, but there is no corresponding - contrast. The phoneme also has no voiced counterpart.

Consonants may appear in clusters. Word-initial consonant clusters can be up to three consonants long, medial clusters up to four consonants long, and final clusters up to two consonants long.

===Vowels===
Barbeau&#x27;s original transcriptions contained great detail and a complex system of diacritics, resulting in 64 different vowel characters. By eliminating allophones, Kopris found six phonemes, in addition to the marginal phoneme .

Other analysis of the same Barbeau data suggests that vowel length is contrastive in Wyandot, like in other Iroquoian languages.

===Phonototactics===
A Wyandot syllable consists of a vowel as the nucleus, a coda, and an optional onset. Onset clusters of two consonants are possible, with a single triconsonantal cluster () occurring only in the first syllable of a word. Codas may consist of up to two consonants. This gives a maximal Wyandot syllable structure of CCCVCC, where C represent a consonant, and V represents a vowel.
==Orthography==
Wyandot is written in the Latin script, with the additional character representing a glottal stop. The majority of characters represent their IPA values, with a few exceptions. The fricatives /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ are indicated with a hachek, as and , and nasal vowels are indicated by a nasal hook (e.g., , ). A colon indicates a long vowel (e.g., ). As in the IPA, a raised indicates prenasalization of stops (e.g., , ). Some allophones of consonants are explicitly indicated (e.g. , ).

Wendat use a similar orthography, with some differences. Although based on the 17th-century orthography of the Jesuit missionaries, the current orthography no longer uses the Greek letters θ for , χ for , ͺ for , or ȣ (or 8) for and . Pre-nasalization of stops is indicated by (e.g., ). Nasal vowels are indicated as in French by (e.g., , ). To disambiguate nasal vowels from oral vowels followed by /n/, the latter have diaeresis over the vowel (e.g., , ). Glottal stops are written with an apostrophe. The fricative /ʃ/ is written as . Consonantal allophones are not explicitly indicated.

==Sample vocabulary==

*&quot;Seten&quot; - Stop, used on road signs (with &quot;arrêt&quot;) in some Huron reserves, such as Wendake in Quebec.
*&quot;Skat&quot; - One
*&quot;Tindee&quot; - Two
*&quot;Shenk&quot; - Three
*&quot;Anduak&quot; - Four
*&quot;Weeish&quot; - Five
*&quot;Sandustee&quot; - Water
*&quot;Kanata&quot; - Village 
*&quot;änen&#x27;enh&quot; [a-NEN&#x27;-enh] - Mother

==Wyandot and Wendat today==
Citizens of the Wyandotte Nation, whose headquarters is in Wyandotte, Oklahoma, are promoting the study of Wyandot as a second language among its people as part of a cultural revival. Since 2005, Richard Zane Smith of the Wyandot Nation of Kansas (an unrecognized non-profit organization that identifies as a Native American tribe) has been volunteering and teaching in the Wyandotte schools with the aid of the linguist Kopris.

Linguistic work is also being done on the closely related Wendat. The anthropologist John Steckley was reported in 2007 as being &quot;the sole speaker&quot; (non-native) of Wendat. Several Wendat scholars have master&#x27;s degrees in Wendat language and have been active as linguists in the Wendat community in Quebec. In Wendake, Quebec, the First Nations people are working on a revival of Wendat language and culture. The language is being introduced in adult classes and into the village primary school. The Wendat linguist Megan Lukaniec has been instrumental in helping to create curriculum, infrastructure, and materials for Wendat language programs.

The Wyandot language is used in the television series &quot;Barkskins&quot;.

<text>D-D-Don&#x27;t Don&#x27;t Stop the Beat is the debut studio album by Danish pop duo Junior Senior. Originally released in March 2002 in Denmark, an altered edition became available later in the year for the rest of continental Europe, and in 2003, the album was released in both the UK and US. It is most widely known for the song &quot;Move Your Feet&quot;, the duo&#x27;s first and most successful single. The United States release of the album received the Parental Advisory rating on its release.

The album received positive reviews from music critics upon release. Based on 18 reviews, Metacritic calculated an average score of 79 for &quot;D-D-Don&#x27;t Don&#x27;t Stop the Beat&quot;, with the summary, &quot;This party album from the Danish band Junior Senior has garnered attention throughout Europe with its mix of garage rock, pop and disco.&quot;

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed the album at number 36 on their &quot;Top 50 Albums of 2003&quot; list.

==Release history==
The album was first released on 4 March 2002 in Denmark by the independent Crunchy Frog Records. Universal Music Group acquired the licenses to release the album in Europe outside of Denmark. In the UK, the album was released through Universal&#x27;s Mercury Records on 10 March 2003. For North America, the duo asked labels to &quot;pony up a high six-figure advance and make a strong marketing commitment.&quot; After a bidding war, Junior Senior made a deal with Atlantic Records, who planned for a 29 July release, but was pushed back to 5 August.

At one point, &quot;Move Your Feet&quot; was the most played song on Danish radio and made the charts in thirteen countries including Australia, France and Denmark. The follow-up EP &quot;Rhythm Bandits&quot; was much less successful, but briefly appeared on the charts in the United Kingdom and Australia.

&quot;D-D-Don&#x27;t Don&#x27;t Stop the Beat&quot; was rated among the best albums of the year by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;Blender&quot;. San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Chronicle&quot; named &quot;Move Your Feet&quot; as the single of the year, declaring it &quot;the best song ever&quot;.

Later editions of the album feature a slightly longer remix of &quot;Rhythm Bandits&quot;, an alternate mix of &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot; and, depending on the edition, either a shorter or longer take of &quot;Shake Me Baby&quot; (which was titled &quot;Just Shake It Brother&quot; on the original Danish edition).

==Use in media==
The third single, &quot;Shake Your Coconuts&quot;, can be found on the &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, soundtrack alongside &quot;Move Your Feet&quot;, and as background menu music in the video game &quot;Worms 3D&quot;.

The song &quot;White Trash&quot; was used in an advert for &quot;Popworld&quot;, a UK television show. The dance that accompanied it achieved some cult status and was mimicked many times on YouTube.

The song &quot;Good Girl, Bad Boy&quot; can be heard in the film &quot;She&#x27;s the Man&quot; when Viola arrives at the private school masquerading as her brother.

The song &quot;C&#x27;mon&quot; can be heard in the 2002 video game &quot;The Getaway&quot; when Sparky tortures a Chinese man with an electric wire. The song is also featured in the American version of the TV series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; in the episode &quot;Stand Up for Ourselves&quot;.

&quot;Move Your Feet&quot; was also featured in the 2004 comedy film &quot;White Chicks&quot; and the 2008 comedy film &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&quot;.

The song &quot;Shake Me Baby&quot; was featured as the opening and closing theme for Chilean TV show &quot;&quot;.

The song &quot;Rhythm Bandits&quot; was featured on the soundtrack for &quot;FIFA 2004&quot;.

<doc id="494979" wikidata="Q714006" url="?curid=494979" title="Republic of Ezo">
<text>The  was a short-lived separatist state established in 1869 on the island of Ezo, now Hokkaido, by a part of the former military of the Tokugawa shogunate at the end of the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot; period in Japan. It was the first government to attempt to institute democracy in Japan, though voting was allowed only to the samurai caste. The Republic of Ezo existed for five months before being annexed by the newly established Empire of Japan.

==Background==

After the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate (&quot;bakufu&quot;) in the Boshin War by the Meiji Restoration, a part of the former &quot;shōgun&quot;″s navy, led by Admiral Enomoto Takeaki, retreated from the capital Edo (Tokyo) in October 1868, sailing north to continue the fight against the advancing Imperial army. Along with Enomoto were many other former Tokugawa officers, including the Commander-in-Chief of the shogunate&#x27;s army, Matsudaira Tarō, and French officers Jules Brunet and André Cazeneuve, former members of a military training mission to Japan, who had refused to leave the country after being recalled to France in late September.

Shortly before midnight on 4 October, the ships left the port of Shinagawa in Tokyo Bay. Enomoto&#x27;s fleet consisted of four warships (&quot;Kaiyō maru&quot; (flagship), &quot;Kaiten maru&quot;, &quot;Banryū maru&quot; and &quot;Chiyodagata maru&quot;) and four transport ships (&quot;Kanrin maru&quot;, &quot;Shinsoku maru&quot;, &quot;Chōgei maru&quot; and &quot;Mikaho maru&quot;).
The fleet first arrived in Sendai, where they were joined by three more French defectors, Arthur Fortant, François Bouffier and Jean Marlin. Enomoto&#x27;s goal was to gather military support from the clans of the disbanded &quot;Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei&quot; (also known as &quot;Northern Alliance&quot;), but this ended in failure after a major clan defected to the Imperial side. After one month in Sendai the fleet sailed further north, arriving in Hakodate, Ezo, on 3 December, which was captured five days later by a force of 4,000 shogunate troops.

With support from the French advisers led by Brunet, Enomoto&#x27;s army continued the conquest of Ezo, capturing Matsumae Castle (18 December) and Esashi (28 December), and by the end of the year the region was under full control of the rebels. Enomoto made a last effort to petition the Imperial Court to be allowed to develop Hokkaido and maintain the traditions of the samurai unmolested, but his request was denied.

==History==
On January 27, 1869, the independent &quot;Republic of Ezo&quot; was proclaimed, with its government structure based on the United States. Suffrage was limited to the samurai class. Votes were cast through open ballots and resulted in the election of Enomoto Takeaki as &quot;sosai&quot;, an office variously translated as president or director-general, and Matsudaira Tarō as &quot;fuku-sosai&quot; (vice-president or assistant governor-general). Some cabinet members were elected by the troops as well; Arai Ikunosuke was chosen as &quot;kaigun-bugyō&quot; (Navy minister) and Ōtori Keisuke as &quot;rikugun-bugyō&quot; (Army minister). This was the first election ever held in Japan, where a feudal structure under an Emperor with military warlords was the norm. Through Hakodate magistrate Nagai Naoyuki, attempts were made to reach out to foreign legations present in Hakodate to obtain international diplomatic recognition. Notably, due to the United States&#x27; involvement through Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s expedition to forcefully end Japan&#x27;s 220-year-old policy of isolation and open ports to American trade, the Western world had limited interest in supporting a breakaway state over the new Meiji government, which offered more stability and potential cooperation.

On the same day, a celebration of the Ezo territory all-island settlement (Ezo territory declaration ceremony) was held, proclaiming the establishment of a provisional government with Enomoto as president.

The treasury included 180,000 gold &quot;ryō&quot; coins Enomoto retrieved from Osaka Castle following &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Yoshinobu&#x27;s precipitous departure after the Battle of Toba–Fushimi in early 1868.
During the winter of 1868–1869, the defences around the southern peninsula of Hakodate were enhanced, with the star fortress of Goryōkaku at the centre. The land force was organised under a joint Franco-Japanese command, commander-in-chief Ōtori Keisuke being seconded by the French captain Jules Brunet. The troops were divided into four brigades, each commanded by a French officer (Fortant, Marlin, Cazeneuve and Bouffier). Each brigade was in turn divided into two battalions, and these into four companies.

Brunet demanded (and received) a signed personal pledge of loyalty from all officers and insisted they assimilate French ideas. An anonymous French officer wrote that Brunet had taken charge of everything:
==Defeat by Imperial forces and aftermath==
Imperial troops soon consolidated their hold on mainland Japan, and in April 1869 dispatched a fleet and an infantry force of 7,000 men to Hokkaido. The Imperial forces progressed swiftly, won the Battle of Hakodate, and surrounded the fortress at Goryōkaku. Enomoto surrendered on June 26, 1869, turning the Goryōkaku over to Satsuma staff officer Kuroda Kiyotaka on June 27, 1869. Kuroda is said to have been deeply impressed by Enomoto&#x27;s dedication in combat and is remembered as the one who spared the latter&#x27;s life from execution. On September 20 of the same year, the island was given its present name, Hokkaido (&quot;Hokkaidō&quot;, literally &quot;Northern Sea Region&quot;).

Enomoto was sentenced to a brief prison sentence, but was freed in 1872 and accepted a post as a government official in the newly renamed Hokkaido Land Agency. He later became ambassador to Russia and held several ministerial positions in the Meiji Government

The rebels&#x27; French allies, some of them wounded, sailed from Hakodate on 9 June aboard the French vessel &quot;Coëtlogon&quot; to Yokohama, where Cazeneuve was admitted to the local naval hospital. Their leader Jules Brunet returned to France in September 1869. He was suspended from active duty in the French army in October, and was later put on trial but received only a light sentence of minor loss in seniority. In February 1870 Brunet was recalled to service, and back as a captain fought in the Franco-Prussian War later that year. In 1871, Arthur Fortant, Jean Marlin, and François Bouffier signed an employment contract with professor Harada Ichido (father of Harada Naojirō) and returned to Japan as civilians to teach at the military school of Osaka.

==Perspectives==
While later history texts were to refer to May 1869 as being when Enomoto accepted Emperor Meiji&#x27;s rule, the Imperial rule was never in question for the Ezo Republic, as made evident by part of Enomoto&#x27;s message to the at the time of his arrival in Hakodate:
Thus from Enomoto&#x27;s perspective, the efforts to establish a government in Hokkaido were not only for the sake of providing for the Tokugawa clan on the one hand (burdened as it was with an enormous amount of redundant retainers and employees) but also as developing Ezo for the sake of defence for the rest of Japan, something which had been a topic of concern for some time. Recent scholarship has noted that for centuries, Ezo was not considered a part of Japan the same way that the other &quot;main&quot; islands of modern Japan were, so the creation of the Ezo Republic, in a contemporary mindset, was not an act of secession, but rather of &quot;bringing&quot; the sociopolitical entity of &quot;Japan&quot; formally to the island of Hokkaido.

He is part of the group with Junichi Suwabe, Daisuke Kishio, Hiroki Takahashi, Hiroyuki Yoshino, Makoto Yasumura, and Kohsuke Toriumi. His younger brother is stunt coordinator, stuntman and actor Masaki Suzumura.

==Career==
Suzumura was born in Niigata Prefecture. Having grown up in a family with many job transfers, he has lived in Okayama in Okayama Prefecture and Moji-ku, Kitakyūshū in Fukuoka Prefecture, in addition to Niigata Prefecture. Later, from the age of 15 to 19, he lived in Toyonaka, Osaka Prefecture, where he entered and graduated from Senri Seiun High School after attending Daini Junior High School from the third year of junior high school. The reason why he decided to become a voice actor was because he initially wanted to be a chef and had even ordered an application form to go to a Japanese culinary school, but a friend of Suzumura&#x27;s brought him a newspaper clipping that asked if he wanted to be a voice actor, so they went to an audition together and Suzumura passed.

After studying at Yoyogi Animation Academy and the Japan Narration Actor Institute, Suzumura made his debut in 1994 as Morley in the TV anime series &quot;Macross 7&quot;. Since then, he has been active in a variety of fields including animation, games, radio and music.

In 2008, he won the Best Personality award and the Synergy Award (for &quot;Kamen Rider Den-O&quot;) at the 2nd Seiyu Awards. On October 8 of the same year, he made his major label debut with Lantis.

On August 13, 2011, he reported on his official blog that he and fellow voice actress, actress and singer Maaya Sakamoto got married on August 8, 2011. In the same year, he won the second prize at the first Music Jacket Awards 2011 (for his album &quot;CHRONICLE to the future&quot;).

In 2012, Suzumura won the Best Musical Performance as part of ST☆RISH at the 6th Seiyu Awards. In April of the same year, he left Arts Vision, to which he had belonged for many years, and on May 1 of the following month, he reported that he had launched Intention Inc. with Atsushi Kuwahara, his manager from Arts Vision.

In 2016, he won the double award for Best Actor in Supporting Role and Personality Award at the 10th Seiyu Awards. In the same year, he won a special award at the sixth Music Jacket Awards 2016 (for his album &quot;Tsuki to Taiyou no Uta&quot;).

A national survey on the popularity of voice actors conducted in March 2010 revealed Suzumura and Mamoru Miyano as the most famous voice actors. In the following year, 2011, TBS Rank Ōkoku listed Suzumura as 3rd of the five most popular voice actors.

Suzumura&#x27;s favorite motto is, &quot;Life is what you make of it.&quot;

On December 27, 2021, Suzumura and Sakamoto announced that they were expecting their first child. On April 21, 2022, the couple announced the birth of their first child.

On May 16, 2024, it was announced that Suzumura would be taking a break due to his poor health, and that his agency would announce his return at a later date. On July 31, 2024, it was announced that he planned to gradually return to his career while taking his health into consideration.

In addition to performing many different character songs throughout his voice acting career, Suzumura is also a singer signed to the Lantis label. As a solo artist, he writes all his songs. In 2008, the debut year of his music career, Suzumura became one of the main hosts of the annual live music event Original Entertainment Paradise (OrePara), along with Lantis artists Showtaro Morikubo, Daisuke Ono, and Mitsuo Iwata.

In January, 2010, he gave his first solo concert tour in Osaka (January 10), Nagoya (January 11), Yokohama (January 23) and Tokyo (January 30). His second live tour, in 2011, was held in the same stops, Osaka (April 9), Nagoya (April 10), Tokyo (April 17) and Yokohama (May 1). Part of the proceeds from the concert were donated to help the victims of the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. As a result of a power shortage, the concert was simple to save power and Suzumura performed acoustic versions of songs.

In 2012, a poll on singing ability placed Suzumura as the third best voice actor singer, behind Kishō Taniyama (1st) and Mamoru Miyano (2nd).

<text>Trenton Doyle Hancock (born 1974) is an American artist working with prints, drawings, and collaged-felt paintings. Through his work, Hancock mainly aims to tell the story of the Mounds, mystical creatures that are part of the artist&#x27;s world. In this sense, each new artwork is the artist&#x27;s contribution to the development of Mounds.

==Early life and education==
Hancock was born in 1974 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and grew up in Paris, Texas. He received a BFA from Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce. As an undergrad, Doyle worked as a cartoonist for the school newspaper. At the time, he thought he would become a professional cartoonist following graduation. The influence of Hancock&#x27;s early interest in cartoons is still visible in his current work. Following his studies at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce, Hancock earned an MFA from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University, Philadelphia. Hancock&#x27;s art was also significantly influenced by his upbringing in Paris, Texas. Church was a fundamental focal point of his childhood, as his stepfather was a minister. Thus, religious tropes and themes are abundant in his works, such as recurring references to Redemption and the Eucharist.

== Work ==

Hancock makes prints, videos, drawings, sculptures, individual performances, and collaged felt paintings. His influences include comics, graphic novels, cartoons, music, and film.

Hancock is known for his visual work that focuses on the Mounds and the Vegans, two forces that are constantly dueling with one another and serve as a representation of the eternal battle between good and evil. This extended series also serves to explore Hancock&#x27;s mythology of the two forces, which gives him the opportunity to develop his concepts at length. He has structured this world to be one he can both occupy and continuously rework, depicting the life stages of a variety of characters, such as the Mounds: ancient half-human and half-plant creatures which were created thousands of years ago when a human male ejaculated into a field of flowers. The Vegans are malevolent beings who seek to destroy all Mounds, especially &quot;The Legend&quot;: the original Mound, and the most despised among Vegans. The Vegans are meant to symbolize those who are determined to force their beliefs on others, whereas the Mounds symbolize the Earth, acceptance, love, and progressive behaviors. Other key characters in Hancock&#x27;s works are Painter, a maternal spirit who governs color, Loid, a paternal energy focused on words, and Torpedo Boy, an unheroic super hero alter ego that Hancock created as a child. Torpedo Boy has superhuman strength, but his human emotions—especially his pride—prevent him from performing his heroic duties to their fullest extent. Additional characters that appear in the work alongside him include Junior Mound, Bringback, Baby Curt, and Shy Jerry.

Trenton Doyle Hancock is known for taking risks in his art, and has stated that he is typically the most interested in his art when he feels he has done something daring with it: whether it deals with social issues, universal dilemmas, or personal matters. Regarding whether Torpedo Boy and the Vegans are meant to symbolize good and evil in his works, Hancock states: &quot;Hopefully there&#x27;s a range of what the Vegans are, and what Torpedo Boy is. You can choose to identify with that range or not. I came from a household where there were very strict ideas about what good and evil are. When I left home, I realized that didn&#x27;t really work for me, that life was a huge grey area. That became more interesting.&quot;

In 2013 his work was translated to Cult of Color: Call to Color, a ballet created in collaboration with Ballet Austin&#x27;s Artistic Director Stephen Mills.

==Awards and fellowships==
Among the honors that Hancock has earned are an Artadia Award (2003), The Greenfield Prize at the Hermitage Artist Retreat (2013), a two-year residency and commission of original work, Art League Houston&#x27;s Texas Artist of the Year (2017), and Texas Medal of Arts Awards in Visual Arts (2019). Hancock was also one of the youngest artists to be featured in the Whitney Biennial, being selected for two consecutive exhibitions in 2000 and 2002. He was a Core Artist in Residence at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston in 2002.

<text>Let formula_1 be a smooth map between smooth manifolds formula_2 and formula_3. Then there is an associated linear map from the space of 1-forms on formula_3 (the linear space of sections of the cotangent bundle) to the space of 1-forms on formula_2. This linear map is known as the pullback (by formula_6), and is frequently denoted by formula_7. More generally, any covariant tensor field – in particular any differential form – on formula_3 may be pulled back to formula_2 using formula_6.

When the map formula_6 is a diffeomorphism, then the pullback, together with the pushforward, can be used to transform any tensor field from formula_3 to formula_2 or vice versa. In particular, if formula_6 is a diffeomorphism between open subsets of formula_15 and formula_15, viewed as a change of coordinates (perhaps between different charts on a manifold formula_2), then the pullback and pushforward describe the transformation properties of covariant and contravariant tensors used in more traditional (coordinate dependent) approaches to the subject.

The idea behind the pullback is essentially the notion of precomposition of one function with another. However, by combining this idea in several different contexts, quite elaborate pullback operations can be constructed. This article begins with the simplest operations, then uses them to construct more sophisticated ones. Roughly speaking, the pullback mechanism (using precomposition) turns several constructions in differential geometry into contravariant functors.

==Pullback of smooth functions and smooth maps==

Let formula_1 be a smooth map between (smooth) manifolds formula_2 and formula_3, and suppose formula_21 is a smooth function on formula_3. Then the pullback of formula_23 by formula_6 is the smooth function formula_25 on formula_2 defined by formula_27. Similarly, if formula_23 is a smooth function on an open set formula_29 in formula_3, then the same formula defines a smooth function on the open set formula_31. (In the language of sheaves, pullback defines a morphism from the sheaf of smooth functions on formula_3 to the direct image by formula_6 of the sheaf of smooth functions on formula_2.)

More generally, if formula_35 is a smooth map from formula_3 to any other manifold formula_37, then formula_27 is a smooth map from formula_2 to formula_37.

==Pullback of bundles and sections==

If formula_41 is a vector bundle (or indeed any fiber bundle) over formula_3 and formula_1 is a smooth map, then the pullback bundle formula_44 is a vector bundle (or fiber bundle) over formula_2 whose fiber over formula_46 in formula_2 is given by formula_48.

In this situation, precomposition defines a pullback operation on sections of formula_41: if formula_50 is a section of formula_41 over formula_3, then the pullback section formula_53 is a section of formula_44 over formula_2.

==Pullback of multilinear forms==

Let be a linear map between vector spaces &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; (i.e., Φ is an element of , also denoted ), and let

formula_56

be a multilinear form on &quot;W&quot; (also known as a tensor – not to be confused with a tensor field – of rank , where &quot;s&quot; is the number of factors of &quot;W&quot; in the product). Then the pullback Φ∗&quot;F&quot; of &quot;F&quot; by Φ is a multilinear form on &quot;V&quot; defined by precomposing &quot;F&quot; with Φ. More precisely, given vectors &quot;v&quot;1, &quot;v&quot;2, ..., &quot;v&quot;&quot;s&quot; in &quot;V&quot;, Φ∗&quot;F&quot; is defined by the formula

formula_57

which is a multilinear form on &quot;V&quot;. Hence Φ∗ is a (linear) operator from multilinear forms on &quot;W&quot; to multilinear forms on &quot;V&quot;. As a special case, note that if &quot;F&quot; is a linear form (or (0,1)-tensor) on &quot;W&quot;, so that &quot;F&quot; is an element of &quot;W&quot;∗, the dual space of &quot;W&quot;, then Φ∗&quot;F&quot; is an element of &quot;V&quot;∗, and so pullback by Φ defines a linear map between dual spaces which acts in the opposite direction to the linear map Φ itself:

formula_58

From a tensorial point of view, it is natural to try to extend the notion of pullback to tensors of arbitrary rank, i.e., to multilinear maps on &quot;W&quot; taking values in a tensor product of &quot;r&quot; copies of &quot;W&quot;, i.e., . However, elements of such a tensor product do not pull back naturally: instead there is a pushforward operation from to given by

formula_59

Nevertheless, it follows from this that if Φ is invertible, pullback can be defined using pushforward by the inverse function Φ−1. Combining these two constructions yields a pushforward operation, along an invertible linear map, for tensors of any rank .

==Pullback of cotangent vectors and 1-forms==

Let formula_1 be a smooth map between smooth manifolds. Then the differential of formula_6, written formula_62, formula_63, or formula_64, is a vector bundle morphism (over formula_2) from the tangent bundle formula_66 of formula_2 to the pullback bundle formula_68. The transpose of formula_62 is therefore a bundle map from formula_70 to formula_71, the cotangent bundle of formula_2.

Now suppose that formula_73 is a section of formula_74 (a 1-form on formula_3), and precompose formula_73 with formula_6 to obtain a pullback section of formula_70. Applying the above bundle map (pointwise) to this section yields the pullback of formula_73 by formula_6, which is the 1-form formula_81 on formula_2 defined by
formula_83
for formula_46 in formula_2 and formula_86 in formula_87.

==Pullback of (covariant) tensor fields==
The construction of the previous section generalizes immediately to tensor bundles of rank formula_88 for any natural number formula_50: a formula_88 tensor field on a manifold formula_3 is a section of the tensor bundle on formula_3 whose fiber at formula_93 in formula_3 is the space of multilinear formula_50-forms
formula_96
By taking formula_6 equal to the (pointwise) differential of a smooth map formula_6 from formula_2 to formula_3, the pullback of multilinear forms can be combined with the pullback of sections to yield a pullback formula_88 tensor field on formula_2. More precisely if formula_103 is a formula_88-tensor field on formula_3, then the pullback of formula_103 by formula_6 is the formula_88-tensor field formula_109 on formula_2 defined by
formula_111
for formula_46 in formula_2 and formula_114 in formula_87.

==Pullback of differential forms==
A particular important case of the pullback of covariant tensor fields is the pullback of differential forms. If formula_73 is a differential formula_117-form, i.e., a section of the exterior bundle formula_118 of (fiberwise) alternating formula_117-forms on formula_120, then the pullback of formula_73 is the differential formula_117-form on formula_2 defined by the same formula as in the previous section:
formula_124
for formula_46 in formula_2 and formula_114 in formula_87.

The pullback of differential forms has two properties which make it extremely useful.

# It is compatible with the wedge product in the sense that for differential forms formula_73 and formula_130 on formula_3, formula_132
# It is compatible with the exterior derivative formula_133: if formula_73 is a differential form on formula_3 then formula_136

==Pullback by diffeomorphisms==
When the map formula_6 between manifolds is a diffeomorphism, that is, it has a smooth inverse, then pullback can be defined for the vector fields as well as for 1-forms, and thus, by extension, for an arbitrary mixed tensor field on the manifold. The linear map
formula_138

can be inverted to give
formula_139

A general mixed tensor field will then transform using formula_140 and formula_141 according to the tensor product decomposition of the tensor bundle into copies of formula_120 and formula_74. When formula_144, then the pullback and the pushforward describe the transformation properties of a tensor on the manifold formula_2. In traditional terms, the pullback describes the transformation properties of the covariant indices of a tensor; by contrast, the transformation of the contravariant indices is given by a pushforward.

==Pullback by automorphisms==

The construction of the previous section has a representation-theoretic interpretation when formula_6 is a diffeomorphism from a manifold formula_2 to itself. In this case the derivative formula_63 is a section of formula_149. This induces a pullback action on sections of any bundle associated to the frame bundle formula_150 of formula_2 by a representation of the general linear group formula_150 (where formula_153).

==Pullback and Lie derivative==

See Lie derivative. By applying the preceding ideas to the local 1-parameter group of diffeomorphisms defined by a vector field on formula_2, and differentiating with respect to the parameter, a notion of Lie derivative on any associated bundle is obtained.

==Pullback of connections (covariant derivatives)==

If formula_155 is a connection (or covariant derivative) on a vector bundle formula_41 over formula_3 and formula_6 is a smooth map from formula_2 to formula_3, then there is a pullback connection formula_161 on formula_44 over formula_2, determined uniquely by the condition that
formula_164

<text>:This is a list of [[public holidays]] in [[Chad]].

December 1, &quot;Freedom and Democracy Day&quot;, remembers December 1, 1990 and celebrates the ascent of President Idriss Déby to power.

March 8 is celebrated as &quot;International Women&#x27;s Day&quot;—La Journee Internationale de la Femme—and marks the culmination of a national week of activities (la Semaine Nationale de la Femme Tchadienne, or &quot;SENAFET&quot;) celebrating women. Observations of &quot;huit mars&quot;, as it is known locally in French, vary from town to town, ranging from small ceremonies or a day off school for girls only to a week of events that includes races, contests and expositions by women’s groups and ends with parades and community-wide celebrations.

<text>The following is a list of public holidays in [[Armenia]].

== Legal holidays and remembrance days ==

=== Non-working legal holidays and remembrance days ===
Per Armenian law, 12 days are declared as non-working days. Non-working days include:
=== Other legal holidays ===
The following days are mentioned in relevant laws, but are not specified as non-working days:
Other traditional, international and professional holidays, as well as religious holidays, can also be celebrated in Armenia. National minorities can also celebrate their national holidays.

== Reshuffling by government ==
The Government of Armenia is allowed to swap working and non-working days. It usually makes use of this e.g. declaring Easter Monday non-working, while the next Saturday becomes a working day instead.

== Other memorable days ==

=== Vardavar ===
Every year, 14 weeks after Easter, Armenians celebrate &quot;Vardavar&quot; (Վարդավար), a lively festival where people soak each other with water using hoses, buckets, spray guns, and other tools. Regardless of who you are or where you are, you will get wet if you are out and about during Vardavar. 

The origins of Vardavar trace back to ancient Armenian pagan traditions. Historically, on this day known as Water Day, Armenians made offerings of red roses to Astłik, the goddess of water, beauty, love, and fertility. The name &quot;Vardavar&quot; itself is a blend of the words &quot;vard&quot; (meaning &quot;rose&quot;) and &quot;var&quot; (meaning &quot;burn&quot;) in Armenian.

Despite its pagan roots, Vardavar has been seamlessly integrated into Christian Armenian culture. Following Armenia&#x27;s conversion to Christianity in 301 AD, the explicit pagan elements were removed from the celebration. However, the festival&#x27;s essence, symbolized by the joyous and communal water splashing, remains a beloved tradition.

=== Armenian Earthquake Memorial Day ===
Armenian Earthquake Memorial Day is a day of remembrance in Armenia for the earthquake of magnitude 6.9 on the Richter scale that struck in northwest Armenia (then part of the Soviet Union) on 7 December 1988. The earthquake damaged much of the country&#x27;s infrastructure, especially in the cities of Spitak, Leninakan (now Gyumri), Kirovakan (now Vanadzor), and Stepanavan, along with other small towns and villages near the epicenter.

Each year, 7 December is recognized by the government of Armenia (and the de facto government of Nagorno-Karabakh) as a day of remembrance of the tragedies that stemmed from the earthquake in 1988.

=== Motherhood and Beauty Day ===
Motherhood and beauty day () is an official holiday in Armenia dedicated to women. While March 8 celebrates all women, April 7 is mother&#x27;s day. April 7 is the Feast of the Annunciation in the calendar of the Armenian Apostolic Church. It is expected to give presents to one&#x27;s own mother. Celebrating each woman as beautiful in her own way, mothers are particularly happy to receive flowers.

<text>Public holidays in the Philippines are of two types: regular holidays and special non-working days.

== History ==
On July 25, 1987, President Corazon Aquino promulgated the Administrative Code of the Philippines. Chapter 9 of this code specified a list of ten nationwide regular holidays and two nationwide special days and provided that the President may proclaim any local special day for a particular date, group or place. Seven of the regular holidays were specified with fixed dates, two with movable dates, and one was specified to fall on the last Sunday in August. The code did not specify how the movable dates were to be determined

In 2001, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo decided to include holiday manipulation, also known as &quot;Holiday Economics&quot; as part of the then-new government&#x27;s list of principal economic policies, moving the celebration dates for holidays occurring on midweek days to weekend days. This was codified by Republic Act. No. 9492, approved on July 25, 2007, which replaced the list of holidays and special days. This act had been specified by the Administrative Code with a new list of eleven national holidays and three nationwide special days. The act also provided that Eidul Adha shall be celebrated as a regional holiday in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. The act specified two of the holidays and one special day with fixed dates, five of the holidays and two special days as occurring on a Monday nearest to or preceding specified dates, and two of the holidays as having movable dates. The act mandated that the President shall issue a proclamation for specifying the specific date movable holidays at least six months prior to the holiday concerned. The act specified that holidays falling on a Wednesday will be observed on the Monday of that week, that holidays falling on a Sunday will be observed on the Monday that follows, and provided that regular holidays and special days may be modified by order or proclamation.

Presidential Proclamations issued subsequent to the promulgation of Republic Act No. 9492 established celebration dates for national holidays and special days, and established new holidays and special days, some nationwide and some local to specified localities.

==Holiday types==

The Labor Code of the Philippines specifies two types of holidays: the &quot;regular holiday&quot; and the &quot;special non-working day&quot;. There is a difference in the pay that employers are required to pay between the two type of holidays. There is also a difference in what is closed and in how the days are declared.

On top of these pay rules, an employee shall be given an additional 30% if the holiday falls on their rest day, and an additional 30% if they work overtime.

On a regular holiday, if the employee did not work, they are entitled 100% of their daily wage. However, a special non-working day usually follows a &#x27;No Work, No Pay&#x27; principle. Therefore, the employee is not entitled to any compensation if they did not work that day. If the employee works on the special non-working day, they shall be entitled to an additional compensation of 30% of the regular daily wage.

==Former holidays==
Independence Day was formerly celebrated on July 4—the date of the Philippine independence from the United States in 1946, a date chosen because it was also American Independence Day. On May 12, 1962, President Diosdado Macapagal issued Presidential Proclamation No. 28, which declared Tuesday, June 12 a special public holiday throughout the Philippines, &quot;... in commemoration of our people&#x27;s declaration of their inherent and inalienable right to freedom and independence.&quot; On August 4, 1964, Republic Act No. 4166 renamed July 4 holiday as &quot;Philippine Republic Day&quot;, proclaimed June 12 as &quot;Philippine Independence Day&quot;, and enjoined all citizens of the Philippines to observe the latter with befitting rites.

In 1955, President Ramón Magsaysay issued Presidential Proclamation No. 212, s. 1955, which established the observance of Philippine–American Day every November 15, which was the anniversary of the 1935 inauguration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Sometime during the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos, Philippine–American Day was renamed &quot;Philippine–American Friendship Day&quot; and moved to July 4, overshadowing the observance of the date as Republic Day. After the Third Republic and the abolition of the 1935 Constitution under Martial Law, it was impolitic to remind the public of the old republic. This is why, when President Marcos issued Presidential Proclamation No. 2346 s. 1984, reference was made to Philippine–American Friendship Day, which was relegated to a working holiday without mention of Republic Day.

During the administration of President Corazon C. Aquino, the practice of celebrating July 4 as both Philippine–American Friendship Day and Republic Day as a non-working holiday was formally abolished. Section 26 of the Administrative Code of 1987 specified a list of regular holidays and nationwide special days that did not include July 4.

==Nationwide observance==
Originally, there were only regular and special holidays. On February 26, 2021, former President Rodrigo Duterte announced the certain special holidays as special working holidays in 2021 under Proclamation No. 1107. This new measure is intended to boost productivity and economic recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On October 13, 2023, President Bongbong Marcos announced that February 25 will no longer be a holiday in 2024 under Proclamation No. 368. The Malacañang stated that the event has &quot;minimum socioeconomic impact&quot; as it falls on a Sunday.

=== Non-working holidays ===

===Working holidays===
==Local observance==
Philippine cities, municipalities, or barangays, often observe one or more holidays. Being a predominantly Catholic country, these are usually the feasts of the locale&#x27;s one or more patron saints.

Secular observances usually mark a government&#x27;s founding day or the birth or death of a prominent native. These are often celebrated with parades, processions, entertainment, and feasting, as well as whatever local customs are traditional.

Local holidays for the most part are applicable only to the immediate area concerned, and barangay fiestas do not usually warrant a public holiday for the area unless otherwise ordered. Such holidays are usually declared as special non-working day and is proclaimed by the President.

==Proposal==
The Senate is considering to consolidate holidays that honor former presidents into a single holiday, similar to the U.S. Presidents&#x27; Day, to enhance the competitiveness of Filipino companies. Senate President Francis Escudero emphasized the need to reduce the number of holidays in the levels of cities, municipalities,and provinces, including those of national level (besides religious), noting that the current total of more than one month hampers productivity. However, labor groups oppose reducing holidays, arguing that it would deprive employees of valuable benefits and that there is no direct link between holidays and productivity. They contend that the move would primarily benefit employers by lowering costs through the reduction of holiday pay.

<text>Iran uses three official calendar systems, including the Solar Hijri calendar as the main and national calendar, the Gregorian calendar for international events and Christian holidays, and the Lunar Hijri calendar for Islamic holidays.

In 2008, the Iranian government&#x27;s English-language newspaper &quot;Iran Daily&quot; wrote that &quot;[the] problem of too many annual public holidays has perpetually been a subject of concern,&quot; pointing out that the government would often declare &quot;unofficial holidays [...] to allow extended weekends&quot; around the national holidays. &quot;[I]f official and unofficial holidays are added to weekends, almost half the year the country is holidaying! The serious issue of so many holidays should not be tolerated [...]&quot;

Iran is one of the countries with the most public holidays in the world, with 28 holidays. Many holidays&#x27; exact dates are determined by the Islamic calendar, and therefore their Gregorian dates vary from year to year.

<text>Herbert James Sanborn, Jr. (born November 14, 1945, in Washington, D.C.) is an American sculptor. He is best known for creating the encrypted &quot;Kryptos&quot; sculpture at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

==Biography==
Sanborn&#x27;s father was the head of exhibitions at the Library of Congress, and his mother was a concert pianist and photo researcher. He grew up in Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia, attending Burgundy Farm Country Day School, followed by JEB Stuart High School—both in Fairfax County—and then attended Randolph-Macon College, receiving a degree in paleontology, fine arts, and social anthropology in 1968, followed by a Master of Fine Arts degree in sculpture from the Pratt Institute in 1971. He taught at Montgomery College in Rockville, Maryland, and then for nine years was the artist-in-residence at Glen Echo Park.

==Art==
Sanborn&#x27;s artwork has been displayed at the High Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. He has created sculptural works for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Themes in his work have included &quot;making the invisible visible&quot;, with many sculptures focusing on topics such as magnetism, the coriolis effect, secret messages, and mysteries of atomic reactions.

===Sculptures===
While in England studying archaeology, Sanborn endeavored to create a structure out of stone to gain a better insight on Romanesque sculptures. From this he has created many works of art that deal with invisible forces. These include the coriolis effect and its use of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion that govern the motion of an object in an inertial frame of reference. He has also worked on pieces that implemented the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field using lodestones. Other sculptures have featured the science of cryptography. One of Sanborn&#x27;s most famous cryptographic works, entitled &quot;Kryptos&quot;, is featured in Dan Brown&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot;. The novel is one of books which includes Robert Langdon, the symbologist.

====&quot;Kryptos&quot;====

&quot;Kryptos&quot; was the first cryptographic sculpture made by Sanborn. It was presented to the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Virginia on November 3, 1990.

The sculpture has been both a puzzle and a mystery for those who hope to crack the cyphered messages contained within the sculpture&#x27;s 2,000 alphabetic letters. Since &quot;Kryptos&quot; was erected, three of the four sections have been confirmed to have been solved. No one has yet been able to solve the remaining 97-character message. He has also said that should he die before the sculpture&#x27;s code is cracked, there will be a &quot;sort of historic record&quot; left to verify the claim.

==== &quot;Ex Nexum&quot; ====
As part of its 1994–1997 renovations, Sanborn was commissioned to create a sculpture. The sculpture is entitled &quot;Ex Nexum&quot;; it was installed in 1997 at Little Rock Old US Post Office &amp; Courthouse.

====&quot;Lux&quot;====
&quot;Lux&quot; was built in 2001 at the Old Post Office Building in Fort Myers, Florida. Both cylinders are made of bronze and they stand as high as 8&#x27; with a diameter of 5&#x27;. Another work, &quot;Caloosahatchee Manuscripts&quot;, is in the same location.

===Exhibits===
Sanborn has also created works of art that reach into the realms of atomic energy and experimental physics. In &quot;Atomic Time: Pure Science and Seduction&quot;, he presented a &quot;life-size re-creation of a hypothetical atomic lab.&quot; The exhibit featured the sculpture &quot;Critical Assembly&quot;, a three-dimensional representation of the components of an atomic bomb. The sculpture included a disassembled sphere that had been designed to hold the nuclear payload of plutonium and uranium.

His next exhibit &quot;Terrestrial Physics&quot;, was to displayed in June 2010 as part of Denver, Colorado&#x27;s Biennial of the Americas. It included a sculpture that is able to generate a 1 million volt potential difference. Utilizing a recreated Van de Graaff generator, Sanborn created a fully functional particle accelerator capable of creating nuclear fission.

===Large-scale outdoor projects===
In addition to designing intricate sculptures and exhibits, Sanborn has also turned some of his large-scale outdoor art into an interactive experience. &quot;Coastline&quot; located at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, is one such piece. A recreation of a portion of Atlantic coastline, the waves experienced here are transferred in &quot;real time&quot; from a monitoring station at Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

Sanborn designed &quot;Indian run park&quot; located adjacent to the U.S. Federal Courthouse in Beltsville, Maryland, with inspiration from the Iroquois Nations that inhabited the area nearly 900 years ago. On this site, hundreds of artifacts by the Iroquois have been discovered, and it is estimated that thousands still remain. The artist himself has also &quot;seeded&quot; 10,000 arrowheads within the grounds, allowing visitors the opportunity of taking a piece of this work of art with them. The park, named after the original Indian Run river that once existed there, includes a waterfall and walkway resembling the snaking waterway. Also, located within the park is a bronze cylindrical sculpture written in Onondaga language and &quot;transcribed from the ancient oral tradition of the five Iroquois nations.&quot; At night it is illuminated with a pinpoint light that emits its text upon the surrounding environment.

==Literature==
Sanborn&#x27;s 2004 book, &quot;Atomic Time: Pure Science and Seduction&quot;, includes images detailing his exhibit &quot;Atomic Time: Pure Science and Seduction&quot; inspired by the Manhattan Project.

==Selected works==

<text>This is a list of public holidays in North Korea. See also the Korean calendar for a list of traditional holidays. , the North Korean calendar has 71 official public holidays, including Sundays. In the past, North Koreans relied on rations provided by the state on public holidays for feasts. Recently, with marketization people are able to save up money and buy the goods they need.

The Day of the Sun, the birthday of its founder and first leader Kim Il Sung, on 15 April is the most important holiday in the country. The second most important is the Day of the Shining Star on 16 February, the birthday of Kim Jong Il. , Kim Jong Un&#x27;s birthday is still not a public holiday. Other holidays of great importance are the Party Foundation Day (10 October) and the Day of the Foundation of the Republic (9 September). North Koreans often schedule their wedding days on important national holidays.

North Korea regularly carries out missile and nuclear tests on such important anniversaries.

==List of annual holidays==

==Momentous changes in political holidays in North Korean calendars==
During some years, certain dates related with the Kim regime are additionally designated as public holidays for propaganda purposes.

In the 2014 version of the North Korean calendar, &quot;Generalissimo Day&quot; (대원수추대일) briefly became a holiday that honors when Kim Jong Il posthumously received the title &quot;Generalissimo of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea&quot; in 2012.

In the 2015 calendar, a new public
holiday was to be celebrated on June 19, marking the date in 1964 when Kim Jong Il graduated from Kim Il Sung University and began working as part of the Party’s organizational leadership. Various events related to the commemorative day take place every year on this date in North Korea, but this was the first time it has been recognized as a national holiday. 

In the 2017 calendar, July 3 became a public holiday called &quot;Day of the Strategic Forces&quot; (전략군절).

<text>Susan Denise Atkins (May 7, 1948 – September 24, 2009) was an American convicted murderer who was a member of Charles Manson&#x27;s &quot;Family&quot;. Manson&#x27;s followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in California over a period of five weeks in the summer of 1969. Known within the Manson family as Sadie, Sadie Glutz, Sadie Mae Glutz or Sexy Sadie, Atkins was convicted for her participation in eight of these killings, including the most notorious, the Tate murders in 1969. She was sentenced to death, which was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment when the California Supreme Court invalidated all death sentences issued prior to 1972. Atkins was incarcerated until her death in 2009. At the time of her death, she was California&#x27;s longest-serving female inmate, long since surpassed by fellow Manson family members Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel.

==Early life==

Atkins was born on May 7, 1948, in San Gabriel, California. She was of English, Irish, Scottish, and German descent. The second of three children, she grew up in northern California. According to Atkins, her parents, Jeanne (née Jett) and Edward John Atkins, were alcoholics. Her mother died of cancer in 1964. Over the next three years, Susan&#x27;s life was disrupted by the gradual breakup of her family, frequent relocations, and her leaving home to live independently. Until she was 13 years old, Atkins and her family lived in a middle class home in the Cambrian Park area of San Jose, California. She was described by those who knew her as a quiet, self-conscious girl who belonged to her school&#x27;s glee club and the local church choir. Two weeks before her mother was hospitalized for the final time, Susan arranged for members of the church choir to sing Christmas carols under her bedroom window. After Jeanne Atkins&#x27;s death, relatives were asked to help look after Susan and her two brothers.

Edward Atkins eventually moved to Los Banos, California, with Susan and her younger brother Steven. When he found work on the San Luis Dam construction project, Edward left the two children behind to fend for themselves. Susan took a job during her junior year in school to support herself and Steven. Atkins had been an average student in Leigh High School in San Jose, but her grades deteriorated when she entered Los Banos High School. During this time, she lived with various relatives.

In December 1966, Atkins asked two classmates to go to San Francisco with her over the Christmas school break. In early 1967 she was working as a stripper in Los Angeles, and Anton LaVey hired her for a performance. Later in 1967, Atkins met Manson when he played guitar at the house where she was living with several friends. When the house was raided several weeks later by the police and Atkins was left homeless, Manson invited her to join his group, who were embarking on a summer road trip in a converted school bus painted completely black. She was nicknamed &quot;Sadie Mae Glutz&quot; by Manson and a man who was creating a fake ID for her at the time. Atkins later claimed to have believed Manson was Jesus. The growing &quot;Manson Family&quot; settled at the Spahn Ranch in the San Fernando Valley in southern California, where, on October 7, 1968, Atkins bore a son by Bruce White, whom Manson called Zezozose Zadfrack Glutz. Atkins&#x27;s parental rights were terminated once she was convicted of the murders, and no one in her family would assume responsibility for the child. Her son was adopted and renamed from the time of her incarceration in 1969. She had no further contact with him.

==Murder of Gary Hinman==
During the summer of 1969, Manson and his commune at Spahn&#x27;s Ranch were attracting the attention of the police, who suspected them of auto thefts and were suspicious of the high number of underage runaways. In an attempt to raise money to move away to the desert, Manson encouraged drug dealing. Purportedly, a botched drug scam by Family member Charles &quot;Tex&quot; Watson led Manson to confront and shoot a man named Bernard &quot;Lotsapoppa&quot; Crowe. Manson believed he had killed Crowe, and he further believed Crowe was a Black Panther. Neither was true. Nonetheless, Manson feared retaliation from the Black Panthers and pressured his followers for more money.

During this time someone suggested that Family acquaintance Gary Hinman had just inherited a large sum of money. Manson hoped Hinman could be persuaded to join the commune and contribute his purported new inheritance.

Manson sent Atkins, Bobby Beausoleil, and Mary Brunner to Hinman&#x27;s home on July 25, 1969. When Hinman said that he had not inherited any money, Beausoleil beat him severely. When Hinman still insisted that he had no inheritance, Manson showed up in person and swung at his head with a sword, slicing his face and severely cutting his ear. Manson directed Atkins and Brunner to stay behind and tend to Hinman&#x27;s wounds. Two days later, and after a phone call from Manson, Beausoleil had Hinman sign over the registrations to his cars and then fatally stabbed him twice. Beausoleil left a bloody hand print on the wall along with the words &quot;Political Piggy&quot; reportedly placed there in hopes of implicating the Black Panthers. Beausoleil was arrested on August 7, 1969, when he was found asleep in one of Hinman&#x27;s vehicles. He was still wearing the bloodstained clothing he wore during the crime. The murder weapon was hidden in the tire well of the car&#x27;s trunk.

== Sharon Tate and LaBianca murders ==

On the evening of August 8, 1969, Manson gathered Atkins, Linda Kasabian, and Patricia Krenwinkel in front of Spahn&#x27;s Ranch and told them to go with Charles &quot;Tex&quot; Watson and do as they were told. In Atkins&#x27;s grand jury testimony, she stated that while in the car, Watson told the group they were going to a home to get money from the people who lived there and to kill them.

On the night of August 10, 1969, Manson, Atkins, Krenwinkel, Watson, Linda Kasabian, Leslie Van Houten, and Steve &quot;Clem&quot; Grogan, went to the home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. Manson and Watson entered the home and tied the couple up. He then went back to the car and sent Krenwinkel and Van Houten inside to do as Watson said. Atkins wrote &quot;PIG&quot; on the front door in Sharon Tate&#x27;s blood.

==Motivation==
In later years, prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi stated that he believed the murders had numerous, disparate motives, all of which he believed served to benefit Manson. Atkins stated that she wanted to commit a crime that would shock the world.

==Arrest and jailhouse confession==
On August 16, 1969, the police raided Spahn&#x27;s Ranch in connection with auto thefts. The charges were later dropped and everyone was released. Soon after their release, Manson and his followers left Spahn Ranch for Barker Ranch, another isolated location. However, the authorities were still suspicious of the group, raided the new location in October 1969, and arrested the group again on auto theft charges. It would be the last time many of them would be free. Just after this arrest, another member of the group implicated Atkins in the Hinman murder and she was charged with that crime.

While in jail, Atkins befriended two middle-aged career criminals, Virginia Graham and Veronica &quot;Ronnie&quot; Howard, to whom she confessed her participation in the Tate/LaBianca murders (for example, telling the women that she had stabbed Tate and tasted Tate&#x27;s blood). They subsequently reported her statements to the authorities. This, combined with information from other sources, led to the arrests of Atkins and others involved in the Tate/LaBianca murders (Van Houten, Krenwinkel, Kasabian, and Watson).

Virginia Graham and Ronnie Howard later received the bulk of the $25,000 reward offered by Roman Polanski for solving the murder case. Their testimony was corroborated by extensive forensic evidence, the testimony of Linda Kasabian, and the grand jury testimony of Atkins herself.

==Grand jury testimony==

Atkins agreed to testify for the prosecution, in exchange for the State of California not seeking the death penalty against her. Atkins appeared before a grand jury, and provided extensive testimony concerning the events on the nights of August 8 and 9, 1969.

When asked if she were willing to testify, knowing that she was not being given immunity, and might incriminate herself in her trial testimony, she responded, &quot;I understand this, and my life doesn&#x27;t mean that much to me. I just want to see what is taken care of.&quot;

Atkins&#x27;s grand jury testimony was extremely lurid, and provides remarkable details concerning the Tate murders. Atkins told the grand jury that she stabbed Frykowski in the legs and held Tate down while Watson stabbed her. She also testified that Tate had pleaded for her life and that of her unborn child. In response, Atkins replied, &quot;Woman, I have no mercy for you.&quot; She told the grand jury that her words were intended to reassure herself, and not addressed to Tate. Atkins also denied her earlier statement to Howard and Graham that she had tasted Tate&#x27;s blood.

Prior to the trial, Atkins repudiated her grand jury testimony in a written statement filed with the court, and discontinued her cooperation with the prosecution. As a result, the State of California sought the death penalty in her case.

Atkins alleged that the reason that she repudiated her grand jury testimony was that &quot;Manson sent his followers to suggest that it might be better for me and my son if I decided not to testify against him&quot;.

There is an ongoing debate as to the exact details of the killings, and the accuracy of Atkins&#x27;s grand jury testimony. In the book, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, the prosecutor, Vincent Bugliosi wrote that he viewed Atkins&#x27;s testimony as &quot;substantially truthful,&quot; with a few omissions concerning the events of the second night.

However, Atkins herself later gave a slightly different account of the crimes. In a 1976 interview, after she had become a born-again Christian, Atkins claimed that she did not actually stab anyone during the Tate murders, and that Watson was responsible for the murder of Sharon Tate. In his 1978 memoir, Watson declared himself responsible for all of Tate&#x27;s injuries, characterizing Atkins&#x27;s initial confessions as exaggeration, jail house bragging, and a bid for attention.

From the early 1970s onward however, Atkins had told parole boards that her original grand jury testimony was truthful and accurate as to what transpired in the Tate home; however, it didn&#x27;t completely match the forensics and autopsy reports.

== Tate–LaBianca trial ==

Manson, Krenwinkel, Van Houten, and Atkins went on trial on June 15, 1970. Watson was later tried separately as he was at the time in Texas fighting extradition. Kasabian, who had no direct involvement in the murders, was offered, and accepted, legal immunity.

During the sentencing phase of the trial, Atkins testified that she stabbed Tate. She stated that she had stabbed Tate because she was &quot;sick of listening to her, pleading and begging, begging and pleading&quot;. Little credibility was given to Atkins&#x27;s testimony in general, as it frequently contradicted known facts. She claimed &quot;(Manson) told us that we were going to have to get on the stand and claim we had deliberately and remorselessly, and with no direction from him at all, committed all the murders ourselves&quot;.

Throughout the trial, Atkins and her co-defendants attempted to disrupt proceedings and were noted for both their lack of remorse for their victims and lack of concern for their own . They sang Manson-penned songs while being led to the courtroom. All four defendants were sentenced to death on March 29, 1971. Atkins was transferred to California&#x27;s new women&#x27;s death row in April 1971.

==Hinman trial==
After the Tate/LaBianca trial, Atkins was convicted for the Hinman murder. She pleaded guilty to the charges against her. She testified she had not known Hinman was to be robbed or killed, although Atkins subsequently contradicted herself on this point in her 1977 autobiography.

==Imprisonment==
Atkins arrived on California&#x27;s death row on April 23, 1971, but her death sentence was automatically commuted to life in prison the next year following the California Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;People v. Anderson&quot; decision, which invalidated all death sentences imposed in California prior to 1972. In 1977, Atkins published her autobiography, &quot;Child of Satan, Child of God&quot;, in which she recounted the time she spent with Manson and the family, her religious conversion, and her prison experiences.

From 1974 onward, Atkins said she was a born-again Christian after seeing a vision of Jesus Christ in her cell. She became active in prison programs, teaching classes and received two commendations for assisting in emergency health interventions with other inmates, one of which was a suicide attempt.

Atkins married twice while in prison. Her first marriage was to inaccurately self-claimed millionaire Donald Lee Laisure on September 2, 1981, who she had met by mail. Atkins became Laisure&#x27;s 36th wife, but the two divorced after he sought to marry yet again.

In 1987, she married James W. Whitehouse, a graduate of Harvard Law School who was 15 years her junior. Whitehouse represented Atkins at her 2000 and 2005 parole hearings and maintained a website dedicated to her legal representation.

During Atkins&#x27;s 2000 parole hearing, Sharon Tate&#x27;s sister, Debra, read a statement written by their father, Paul, which said in part, &quot;Thirty-one years ago I sat in a courtroom with a jury and watched with others. I saw a young woman who giggled, snickered and shouted out insults; even while testifying about my daughter&#x27;s last breath, she laughed. My family was ripped apart. If Susan Atkins is released to rejoin her family, where is the justice?&quot;

In April 2002, Atkins told a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter of her work to discourage teenagers from idolizing Manson and her hope of someday leaving prison to live in Laguna Beach, California.

In 2003, Atkins filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that she was a &quot;political prisoner&quot; due to the repeated denials of her parole requests regardless of her suitability.

On June 1, 2005, Atkins had her 17th parole hearing; this resulted in a three-year denial. She was given less than six months to live and subsequently requested a &quot;compassionate release&quot; from prison. Atkins&#x27;s attorney, Eric P. Lampel, stated that Atkins&#x27;s condition had deteriorated to the point that she was paralyzed on one side, could only talk &quot;a little bit&quot;, and could not sit up in bed without assistance. The hearing was attended by various family members of the victims, including Debra Tate and members of the Sebring family, and they requested that her parole be denied. She received a four-year denial.

In April 2008, it was revealed that Atkins had been hospitalized for more than a month with an undisclosed illness that was subsequently reported to be terminal brain cancer. Her left leg had been amputated.

===Opinions on Atkins&#x27;s release request===
Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Atkins, said he was not opposed to her release given her current condition, adding that she had paid &quot;substantially, though not completely, for her horrendous crimes. Paying completely would mean imposing the death penalty.&quot; Bugliosi stated he supported her release to save the state money. The cost for Atkins&#x27;s medical care since she was hospitalized on March 18, 2008, &quot;reportedly surpassed $1.15 million with additional cost of over $300,000 to guard her hospital room.&quot; Bugliosi stated he was challenging the notion that &quot;just because Susan Atkins showed no mercy to her victims, we therefore are duty-bound to follow her inhumanity and show no mercy to her.&quot;

Former prosecutor Stephen R. Kay, who prosecuted Manson supporters, opposed Atkins&#x27;s release, stating:

Kay also stated that he had attended about 60 parole hearings related to the murders and spent considerable time with the victims&#x27; families, witnessing their suffering.

Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley stated that he was strongly opposed to the release, saying in a letter to the board it would be &quot;an affront to people of this state, the California criminal justice system and the next of kin of many murder victims.&quot; Cooley wrote that Atkins&#x27;s &quot;horrific crimes alone warrant a denial of her request&quot; and that she &quot;failed to demonstrate genuine remorse and lacks insight and understanding of the gravity of her crimes.&quot; Suzan Hubbard, director of adult prisons in California, also recommended against granting Atkins&#x27;s request. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposed Atkins&#x27;s release, stating: 

Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas also opposed Atkins&#x27;s release, stating that &quot;It would be a grave miscarriage of justice to burden the citizens of Orange County by paroling her to Orange County, where she can enjoy the comforts of her husband, home and mercy she did not show Sharon Tate [or] her unborn baby.&quot;

===Release hearing and results===

The Board of Parole Hearings considered Atkins&#x27;s request for compassionate release during its monthly meeting on July 15, 2008. During the 90-minute hearing, emotional pleas were made by both supporters and opponents of Atkins&#x27;s release. The public hearing limited speakers&#x27; comments to five minutes each. After the board heard the case (as well as other agenda items), it retired to closed session for final deliberations. Due to her failing health, Atkins herself did not attend the hearing.

Debra Tate, by this point the only surviving immediate relative of murder victim Sharon Tate, spoke in opposition to a compassionate release for Atkins, stating, &quot;She will be set free when judged by God. It&#x27;s important that she die in incarceration.&quot; Pam Turner, a niece of Sharon Tate, also opposed Atkins&#x27;s release, stating, &quot;If she were capable of comprehending what our family&#x27;s been through, she would be ashamed to come before this parole board and ask such a request.&quot; Anthony DiMaria, the nephew of murder victim Thomas Jay Sebring, also opposed Atkins&#x27;s release, stating, &quot;You will hear various opinions with respect to this today, but you will hear nothing from the nine people who lie in their graves and suffered horrendous deaths at the hands of Susan Atkins.&quot;

Gloria Goodwin Killian, director of ACWIP (Action Committee for Women in Prison) and a Pasadena legal researcher and prisoner advocate, spoke in support for Atkins&#x27;s compassionate release, arguing, &quot;Susan has been punished all that she can be. Short of going out to the hospital and physically torturing her, there is nothing left anyone can do to her. The people who are suffering are the people you see in this room today.&quot; In July 2008, Atkins&#x27;s husband, James W. Whitehouse, told the board, &quot;They tell me we&#x27;re lucky if we have three months. It&#x27;s not going to be fun. It&#x27;s not going to be pretty.&quot;

Ultimately, after final deliberations the 11 members of the California Board of Parole Hearings unanimously declined to refer Atkins&#x27;s request for compassionate release to the sentencing court. The decision—posted on its website—meant that Atkins&#x27;s request would not be forwarded to the Los Angeles Superior Court that sentenced her, which would have had the final say as to whether she would be released. On September 24, 2008, Atkins was transferred back to the Central California Women&#x27;s Facility in Chowchilla, California, to the facility&#x27;s skilled nursing center.

Atkins&#x27;s minimum eligible parole date was October 6, 1976. Her initial parole consideration hearing was on September 14, 1976, at which time she was denied parole. Prior to her 2009 parole hearing, a website maintained by Atkins&#x27;s husband claimed that she was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and unable to sit up or be transferred to a wheelchair. For the final time, Atkins was denied parole on September 2, 2009.

===Death===
Atkins died of brain cancer on September 24, 2009, at the Central California Women&#x27;s Facility in Chowchilla. A prison spokesperson announced to reporters that her cause of death was listed as &quot;natural causes&quot;. Her husband, James Whitehouse, subsequently released a statement saying that &quot;Her last whispered word was &#x27;Amen&#x27;.&quot;

==Media portrayals==
Atkins was portrayed by Nancy Wolfe in the 1976 made-for-TV film &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, and by Marguerite Moreau in that film&#x27;s 2004 remake. She was played by Maureen Allisse in &quot;The Manson Family&quot; (2003), by Anjelica Scannura in &quot;Manson, My Name Is Evil&quot; (2009), by Devanny Pinn in &quot;House of Manson&quot; (2014), by Ambyr Childers in the 2015 TV series &quot;Aquarius&quot;, by Sarah Paulson in &quot;American Horror Story: Cult&quot;, by Kristine Hayworth in &quot;Prettyface&quot;, by Marianne Rendon in &quot;Charlie Says&quot;, and by Mikey Madison in &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;.

<text>Namie Amuro ( ; ; born September 20, 1977) is a retired Japanese singer. She rose to prominence as a teen idol, and transitioned into a leading pop artist due to her versatility across music styles and visual presentation. Due to her career reinventions and longevity, she is known as an icon across Japan and Asia. She has been referred to as the &quot;Queen of Japanese Pop&quot;, and her influence domestically has drawn equivalent comparisons to artists such as Janet Jackson and Madonna in Western pop culture. 

Born in Naha, Okinawa, Amuro debuted as the lead singer of the idol group Super Monkey&#x27;s in 1992 when she was 14 years old. Despite early sales disappointments, Amuro&#x27;s rising popularity helped to score a major hit with the 1995 Eurobeat single &quot;Try Me (Watashi o Shinjite)&quot;. Signing to Avex Trax for her solo career, Amuro catapulted to fame with a string of number one singles including &quot;Chase the Chance&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Cry&quot;. A close partnership with renowned producer Tetsuya Komuro resulted in a dance-pop sound with Western influences. Her first four releases, including &quot;Sweet 19 Blues&quot; (1996) and &quot;Concentration 20&quot; (1997), each received multi-million certifications. Her 1997 single &quot;Can You Celebrate?&quot; remains as the best selling single by a solo female artist in Japanese music history. 

In the early 2000s, &quot;Never End&quot; became Amuro&#x27;s last successful single before a decline in sales, and her music began evolving from pop to R&amp;B as she reined in creative control of her career. This transition was marked by the Suite Chic project in 2002 and her sixth studio album &quot;Style&quot; (2003). Amuro&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Play&quot; (2007), with the hit single &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, began a period of commercial resurgence. Her comeback was solidified with the 2008 single &quot;60s 70s 80s&quot; and its parent release &quot;Best Fiction&quot;. She continued to experiment musically in the 2010s, dabbling in EDM and recording in English, beginning with her tenth studio album &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; (2012). It featured the million-certified single &quot;Love Story&quot;. She later founded her own management company, Stella88, and record label, Dimension Point. 

Amuro finished her career with the 2017 greatest hits album &quot;Finally&quot;, which became the best selling album of the decade and made her the only artist to achieve a million-seller in each of their teens, 20s, 30s and 40s. She officially retired from the music industry on September 16, 2018. As it coincided with the closure of the Heisei era (1989–2019), she became labelled as the representative &quot;Heisei diva&quot; with many calling it the &quot;end of an era&quot;, in both senses. 

Having sold more than 40 million records, Amuro is recognized as one of the best-selling artists in Japan by &quot;Oricon&quot;. She has received accolades from the Japan Record Awards, Japan Gold Disc Awards, MTV Video Music Awards Japan and the World Music Awards.

==Life and career==

===1977–1995: Early life and career beginnings===
Namie Amuro was born on September 20, 1977, at Okinawa Red Cross Hospital in Naha, Okinawa. She is one of four children of Emiko Taira. Through her mother, Amuro is a quarter Italian. Having divorced when Amuro was only 4 years old, Taira raised her children solely in Okinawa – she worked as a nursery school employee and a bar hostess to support her family. Although Amuro had no ambition to become a singer, she was discovered at age 12, while visiting a friend. One year later, Amuro was scouted by Masayuki Makino, the owner of Okinawa Actors School, and eventually she was enrolled there. In 1991, Makino placed her in an idol group named Super Monkey&#x27;s, with four other girls: Anna Makino, Hisako Arakaki, Minako Ameku and Nanako Takushi. The sixth member, Rino Nakasone, joined the group one year later. On September 16, 1992, Super Monkey&#x27;s released their debut single, &quot;Koi no Cute Beat/Mr USA&quot;. However, Anna Makino left the group at the end of that year. In 1993, the remaining members of Super Monkey&#x27;s moved to Tokyo.

Super Monkey&#x27;s did not gain much success and the group went through constant lineup changes. In 1994, the group changed their name to Namie Amuro with Super Monkey&#x27;s to reflect Amuro&#x27;s rising popularity as an upcoming actress and fashion model. Aside from group&#x27;s musical activities, Amuro had bit parts in Japanese television series and small films. Super Monkey&#x27;s experienced a large amount of success with their single &quot;Try Me (Watashi o Shinjite)&quot;, produced by Italian eurobeat producer Dave Rodgers, and Japanese businessman Max Matsuura. Released on January 25, 1995, the song reached number eight on the Oricon Singles Chart, and stayed in the top 200 chart for 25 weeks. Despite the beginning success as a group, the other four members of the Super Monkey&#x27;s formed their own sub-group, MAX, under the Japanese record label Avex Trax. As a result, Amuro released two more solo singles under Toshiba-EMI before moving to Avex Trax herself.

After signing with Avex Trax in 1995, the corresponding record company Avex Group enlisted Japanese musician Tetsuya Komuro to work with Amuro on her then-upcoming album. Amuro made her solo debut with Avex, releasing the single &quot;Body Feels Exit&quot; on October 25, 1995. It became a huge success in Japan, peaking at number three on the Oricon Singles Chart and sold over 882,000 units in Japan. Amuro&#x27;s second single with Komuro, &quot;Chase the Chance&quot;, became her first number-one single on the Oricon Singles Chart and her first single to sell over 1 million units in Japan. For Amuro&#x27;s success with those singles, she won the Golden Arrow Award in 1995.

===1996–1998: &quot;Sweet 19 Blues&quot;, &quot;Concentration 20&quot;, pregnancy, marriage, breakthrough, &quot;181920&quot; and motherhood===

After a brief hiatus, Amuro released two more singles in 1996: &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Cry&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re My Sunshine&quot;. Both singles were successful in Japan, bringing her second and third consecutive number one singles, and both sold over one million units there. Amuro achieved huge success after the release of her first solo studio album, &quot;Sweet 19 Blues&quot; (1996). Released on July 22, it reached number one on the Oricon Albums Chart in Japan, and has sold over 3.6 million units. She released the album&#x27;s final single, the title track, on August 21, 1996; it achieved success by peaking at number two on the Oricon Singles Chart, and shifted over 400,000 units in Japan. On November 27, 1996, she started work on her second solo studio album with Komuro, and released its lead single &quot;A Walk in the Park&quot;. It gave Amuro her fourth number one single on the Oricon Singles Chart, and her fourth single to sell over one million units there. At the end of 1996, she was awarded the Grand Prix Award for her song &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Cry&quot;, the highest honor at the Japan Record Awards, making her the youngest artist to have won the award. On February 19, 1997, she released her single &quot;Can You Celebrate?&quot;, which became her fifth number one single. The single became a huge success in Japan, eventually selling 2,750,000 units there, making it the best-selling single by a solo female artist in Japan. After releasing her sixth consecutive number one single &quot;How to Be a Girl&quot; on May 21, 1997, Amuro released her second album &quot;Concentration 20&quot; in July of that year. It became her third number one album in Japan, and sold over 1.9 million units there. For additional promotion, she embarked her Concentration 20 Dome Tour in Japan, which achieved commercial success. By early August 1997, the total sales of Amuro&#x27;s records reached 20 million units in Japan. During a press conference on October 22 of that year, Amuro confirmed her marriage to Japanese musician and TRF band member Masaharu &quot;Sam&quot; Maruyama. During the conference, she announced that she was three months pregnant with their first child. At the end of the year, she won the Grand Prix Award at the Japan Record Awards again for &quot;Can You Celebrate?&quot; and made her final appearance on the annual Japanese television music show 48th Kōhaku Uta Gassen before beginning her one-year hiatus from the music industry. She legally changed her name to Namie Maruyama, but continued to use her maiden name as her professional name.

Amuro&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;181920&quot;, was released on January 28, 1998, and covers twelve singles which were released prior to her hiatus. The total sales of the album were around 2 million units in Japan. Four months later, on May 19, Amuro gave birth to her son, Haruto Maruyama at Maruyama Memorial General Hospital. She returned to the music industry by releasing the single &quot;I Have Never Seen&quot; on December 23, 1998. It became her eighth number one single on Oricon, and sold over 650,000 units in Japan. She made her first televised appearance on 49th Kōhaku Uta Gassen days later, performing a tearful rendition of her single &quot;Can You Celebrate?&quot;.

===1999–2001: Personal struggles, &quot;Genius 2000&quot; and &quot;Break the Rules&quot;===
Working on the album &quot;Genius 2000&quot; with Komuro and American producer Dallas Austin, after releasing its first single &quot;I Have Never Seen&quot; in 1998, Amuro released its second single &quot;Respect the Power of Love&quot; on March 17, 1999. On the same day, news publications in Amuro&#x27;s hometown, Okinawa, reported that her mother, Emiko Taira, had been murdered. According to staff editors at &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, Emiko and her second husband, Tatsunobu Taira, were hit by an axe, owned by Kenji Taira, Emiko&#x27;s ex-husband&#x27;s brother. While her second husband survived with moderate injuries, Emiko was taken to hospital, and pronounced dead after noon on March 17. Kenji was then found dead in his car, after consuming insecticide. Upon hearing the news, Amuro postponed all promotional activities and flew back to Okinawa in order to identify her mother&#x27;s body. A week later, the single debuted at the number two on the Oricon Singles Chart, beaten by the single &quot;Dango 3 Kyodai&quot;. A third single, &quot;Toi et Moi&quot;, was used for the Japanese animation movie &quot;Pokémon: The Movie 2000&quot;. Both singles proved successful, selling over 400,000 and 200,000 units in that region, respectively. Amuro made her first single debut with Austin on &quot;Something &#x27;Bout the Kiss&quot;, released on September 1, 1999. It became a success in Japan, reaching number three on the Oricon Singles Chart and sold over 390,000 units there. In January 2000, Amuro released her fourth studio album &quot;Genius 2000&quot;; it reached number one on the Oricon Albums Chart, and shifted over 800,000 units there. That same month, Amuro confirmed her separation from husband Masaharu. For the first half of 2000, Amuro embarked on her Genius 2000 Tour throughout Japan. She then released the single &quot;Never End&quot;, in July, confirming work on her fifth studio album with Komuro and Austin. The single was used as part of the G8 Summit taking place in Okinawa, Japan that year. It was commissioned by late Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi, who asked Tetsuya Komuro to write a song conveying &quot;a vision of harmony and interaction in the world in the 21st century&quot;. Obuchi later asked Amuro to perform the single at the summit.

Amuro&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Break the Rules&quot; was released on December 20, 2000, and is her final full-length produced album with Komuro. It became her first studio album to miss the top spot, peaking at number two on the Oricon Albums Chart. Amuro&#x27;s sales started to decline from this release, as the album only shifted 335,000 units in Japan. To promote the studio album, Amuro toured Japan in March 2001, and finished in May that same year. In August, she released the single &quot;Say the Word&quot;; it was her first single that she contributed to songwriting. This was her first single to be released after departing with Komuro, until years later, and was released in part of her upcoming greatest hits album. Since then, she started to produce her own activities. However, in December she worked with Komuro for the last time on &quot;Lovin&#x27; It&quot;, a single released as part of Avex&#x27;s Song+Nation charity project. The single featured Japanese rapper Verbal from the music group M-Flo.

===2002–2004: &quot;Love Enhanced Single Collection&quot;, decline in sales and popularity, Suite Chic project and &quot;Style&quot;===

Amuro released her second compilation album, &quot;Love Enhanced Single Collection&quot;, on March 13, 2002. The album reworked nearly every single released after her return from hiatus in 1998, with new vocals, mixes or rearrangements. The single &quot;I Will&quot; was released a month before the album and became Amuro&#x27;s first single below 100,000 units in sales. Although the album was moderately successful, peaking at number three and shifting over 300,000 units, it only sold a fraction of its predecessor &quot;181920&quot; (1998). In July 2002, Amuro divorced Maruyama, and legally changed her name back to Namie Amuro, having cited irreconcilable differences. According to reports, her divorce was due to her personal issues with Maruyama&#x27;s family. Retrospectively, &quot;The Times&quot; attributed her loss in popularity during this era to the attention surrounding her personal struggles, while &quot;The Japan Times&quot; cited the rise of newer artists Hikaru Utada and Ayumi Hamasaki, who achieved great success in the wake of her hiatus. In a 2005 interview, Amuro said: &quot;Even my closest friend said I was finished, but I think I may be a little different from the others. My popularity plunged three years ago and I didn’t try to court publicity. It was a real challenge forcing myself to be consistent in not playing up to my fans.&quot; Amuro started work on her sixth studio and third collaboration album with Dallas Austin, releasing Diane Warren-written single &quot;Wishing on the Same Star&quot; on September 11, 2002. The single saw a large slip in Amuro&#x27;s sales, only shifting 95,000 units by the end of the year. In December 2002, Amuro was part of the musical project Suite Chic, involving several Japanese artists like Verbal, Zeebra, Dabo and DJ Muro. The project released two singles, one studio album and one remix album before dissolution in 2003.

Amuro returned to solo activities in mid-2003, releasing the singles &quot;Shine More&quot;, &quot;Put &#x27;Em Up&quot;, and the double A-side singles: &quot;So Crazy&quot; and &quot;Come&quot;. The single&#x27;s saw an exploration of westernised musical styles with American producers, including R&amp;B producers Full Force and the work of Austin. &quot;Come&quot; was used for the Japanese anime &quot;InuYasha&quot;, and is a re-arranged song that was originally recorded by Australian recording artist and TV personality Sophie Monk. At the end of the year, she released her sixth studio album and first album in three years, &quot;Style&quot;. The album became her lowest chart album on the Oricon Albums Chart, peaking at number four. It is also her lowest selling studio album, shifting only 222,000 units in that region. To promote the studio album, Amuro conducted her So Crazy Tour Featuring Best Singles on November 29. The tour concluded in Japan on April 11, 2004. She extended the concert tour, marked as a promotional appearance, in Taiwan, and South Korea. Shortly after the tour, she released the single &quot;All for You&quot; on July 22, 2004, confirming work on her seventh studio album. This was followed by the double A-side single &quot;Girl Talk&quot; and &quot;Girl Talk/The Speed Star&quot;, released on October 14, 2004. It was successful in Japan, peaking at number two, and sold over 107,000 units in that region; it became her first top three single in two years. Amuro decided not to appear on 55th Kōhaku Uta Gassen, although she had been invited to perform at the event. She had previously attended the event nine years in a row.

===2005–2006: &quot;Queen of Hip-Pop&quot; and expansion into Asia===

In April 2005, Amuro released the single &quot;Want Me, Want Me&quot;. The song was a success in Japan, reaching number two on Oricon Singles Chart, and sold over 103,000 units in that region. In May, following a three-year split from Maruyama, Japanese publications reported that she would take back full custody of their child, Haruto. In August, she was granted full custody of Haruto with visitation rights by Maruyama. On May 29, Amuro performed at MTV Video Music Awards Japan for the fourth consecutive year in a row. She won two awards, &quot;Best R&amp;B Video&quot; and &quot;Most Impressive Performing Asian Artist&quot;, making her the first artist to win MTV VMAJ awards four years in a row (she won &quot;Inspiration Award&quot; in 2002, &quot;Best Collaboration&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Best R&amp;B Video&quot; in 2004). Amuro released her seventh studio album &quot;Queen of Hip-Pop&quot; in July 2005. The album includes four singles: &quot;Alarm&quot;, &quot;All For You&quot;, &quot;Girl Talk/The Speed Star&quot; and &quot;Want Me, Want Me&quot;. &quot;Queen of Hip-Pop&quot; was a success, reaching number two on the Oricon Albums Chart, and sold over 455,000 units in Japan. In collaboration with MGM Studios, Amuro was granted permission to use Pink Panther in the album. A female panther counterpart was created for the album as well. Both panther characters appeared in the music video of &quot;WoWa&quot;. In September 2005, Amuro embarked on her Space of Hip-Hop concert tour in Japan. Shortly after the commencement of the tour, she announced that she would contribute to the Japanese theatrical release of the film &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005). After viewing the movie, Amuro made an offer to the Japanese distribution company to sing its theme song; the company, feeling that her image fit the movie, accepted her offer. The theme song, &quot;Violet Sauce&quot;, was later released as part of a double A-side single, &quot;White Light/Violet Sauce&quot;, in November 2005. It achieved moderate success in Japan, reaching number seven on the Oricon Singles Chart, and sold over 72,000 units there. The movie&#x27;s director, Robert Rodriguez, was impressed by the song and asked to be a part of it; he can be heard saying &quot;Welcome to Sin City&quot; towards the end of the song. Shortly after the single, she released &quot;Filmography 2001–2005&#x27; (2006)&quot;, a compilation of twelve of her music videos between the years 2001 to 2005. Amuro collaborated with Japanese recording artists Zeebra, Ai, and Mummy-D on Zeebra&#x27;s album, &quot;The New Beginning&quot;, released in February 2006, in a song called &quot;Do What U Gotta Do&quot;. In May, she released the double A-side single &quot;Can&#x27;t Sleep, Can&#x27;t Eat, I&#x27;m Sick/Ningyo&quot;, which peaked at number two on the Oricon Singles Chart and shifted over 80,000 units in Japan. In August 2006, Amuro conducted her first annual tour Best Tour Live Style 2006, spanning between August and November 2006. Released in February 2007, the Live DVD of the tour was placed on the second position by Oricon. Its total sales exceeded 90,000 units in Japan.

===2007–2009: Resurgence of sales, revived popularity, &quot;Play&quot;, &quot;Best Fiction&quot; and &quot;Past&lt;Future&quot;===

Amuro released the third single from her upcoming eight studio album, &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; on January 24, 2007; it was used as the theme song for the Japanese television series &quot;Himitsu no Hanazono&quot;. It was successful in Japan, reaching number three on the Oricon Singles Chart, and sold over 144,000 units in that region, her highest selling single since &quot;Say the Word&quot;. Based on ringtone sales, it became her first single to shift over one million units since &quot;How to Be a Girl&quot;. Alongside this, she achieved the distinction in having a top ten single each year for 13 consecutive years, breaking the solo female artist&#x27;s record in Japan by Kyōko Koizumi and Shizuka Kudō. At the end of 2007, it ranked at number seven on the RIAJ yearly ringtone sales charts. She then released the fourth and final single, &quot;Funky Town&quot;, on April 4, 2007. It achieved moderate success on the Oricon Singles Chart, peaking at number seven, and shifted over 54,000 units. She was also featured on Japanese group, M-Flo&#x27;s album, &quot;Cosmicolor&quot;, in a song titled &quot;Luvotomy&quot;. Her eighth studio album, &quot;Play&quot;, was released on June 27, 2007. The album charted atop of the Oricon Albums Chart, becoming Amuro&#x27;s first number-one album in more than 7 years. To promote the album, Amuro conducted her concert tour in Japan, titled Play Tour 2007, spanning between August 18, 2007, and February 27, 2008. Originally consisting of 53 performances, it increased by 12 performances to 65 performances, making this Amuro&#x27;s longest spanning tour. On the day when Play Tour 2007 concluded, Amuro released the Live DVD of the tour. It was placed on the second position by Oricon.

In early 2008, Amuro confirmed that she would promote Japanese hair company Vidal Sassoon through their new marketing campaign &quot;Fashion x Music x VS&quot;, with a new single. The single, though marketed as an extended play, was titled &quot;60s 70s 80s&quot;, and consisted of three songs: &quot;New Look&quot;, &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, and &quot;What A Feeling&quot;. The songs feature samples from The Supremes&#x27;s &quot;Baby Love&quot; (1964), Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Rock Steady&quot; (1971) and Irene Cara&#x27;s &quot;What A Feeling&quot; (1983), respectively. &quot;60s 70s 80s&quot; became a huge success in Japan, reaching number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, and sold over 293,000 units in that region, becoming Amuro&#x27;s first number-one single since &quot;I Have Never Seen&quot; and her highest selling single since &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. On March 25, 2008, Amuro was awarded &quot;Best Female Video&quot; for &quot;Hide &amp; Seek&quot; (from the album &quot;Play&quot;) at Space Shower Music Video Awards. &quot;Hide &amp; Seek&quot; also won the award for &quot;Best R&amp;B Video&quot; at MTV Video Music Awards, which was held at the Saitama Super Arena on May 31. In the same month, Amuro recorded a collaboration with Japanese musician Double in a song called &quot;Black Diamond&quot;. Despite lacklustre success on the Oricon Singles Chart, it sold over 500,000 ringtone units. On July 26, Amuro participated at the 2008 A-nation music concert; an estimated 25,000 people attended her performance. This was the first time she was invited to perform in seven years. On July 30, she released her third greatest hits album, &quot;Best Fiction&quot;. Featuring tracks between 2003 and 2008, &quot;Best Fiction&quot; sold 681,000 copies in the first week and debuted at number one on the Oricon Albums Chart. Within its third week, &quot;Best Fiction&quot; sold over one million units, making her the first artist to have one million certified album in three consecutive decades. &quot;Best Fiction&quot; eventually spent six consecutive weeks at the number-one position, becoming the first album to do so in more than 14 years since the Dreams Come True&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Magic&quot;. By the end of 2008, &quot;Best Fiction&quot; became the second best-selling album behind Exile&#x27;s &quot;Exile Love&quot;. In addition, it became the second best selling digital-format album by a Japanese artist behind Hikaru Utada&#x27;s &quot;Heart Station&quot;. &quot;Best Fiction&quot; was awarded the Album of the Year award at the 50th Japan Record Awards. To promote the album, Amuro conducted her Best Fiction Tour, spanning between October 25, 2008, and July 12, 2009. The Live DVD and Blu-ray of the tour were released on September 9, 2009. Amuro was invited again to the 59th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen, but she declined.

On January 20, 2009, Amuro begun working on her ninth studio album, and featured a new track entitled &quot;Dr.&quot; through a Vidal Sassoon commercial. She then released the album&#x27;s lead double A-side singles, &quot;Wild/Dr.,&quot; on March 18, 2009. The song was a success, peaking at number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, and sold over 119,000 units in that region. As a result, she also broke her own record of having all of her singles debut in the top 10 (on the Oricon Daily Singles Chart) for the last 15 years. Amuro collaborated with Japanese music group Ravex on a song for their album &quot;Trax&quot; (2008), entitled &quot;Rock U&quot;. On October 1, Vidal Sassoon released new commercials featuring Amuro, and two tracks from her ninth studio album, &quot;My Love&quot; and &quot;Copy That&quot;. On December 16, 2009, Amuro released her ninth studio album, &quot;Past&lt;Future&quot;. The album was a success on the Oricon Albums Chart, reaching number one, and sold over 600,000 units in that region, slightly higher than the sales of &quot;Play&quot;.

===2010–2012: Award at WMA 2010, &quot;Checkmate!&quot;, &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; and 20th anniversary commemoration===

To promote &quot;Past&lt;Future&quot;, Amuro travelled throughout 26 cities in Japan to conduct her Past&lt;Future Tour 2010, which began on April 3, 2010, in Ichihara, Chiba and concluded on December 15, 2010, in Nagoya, Aichi. On the day when Past&lt;Future Tour 2010 ended, Amuro released the Live DVD and Blu-ray of the tour, which reached the top spot on the Oricon DVD charts and shifted over 100,000 copies. On May 18, 2010, Amuro won the Best Asian Artist award at World Music Awards in Monte Carlo, Monaco. There, she performed her track &quot;Hide &amp; Seek&quot; from her album &quot;Play&quot;. Two months later, she released her double A-side single &quot;Break It/Get Myself Back&quot;, which performed well on several record charts in Japan. On December 15, 2010, together with the premiere of Live DVD and Blu-ray of Past&lt;Future Tour 2010, the Blu-rays of Space of Hip-Pop, BEST Tour Live Style 2006 and PLAY Tour 2007 were also released.

On April 27, 2011, Amuro published her fifth compilation and second collaboration album &quot;Checkmate!&quot;, her first musical release of the year. The album featured nine collaborative tracks Amuro had participated in throughout her career and four new recordings: &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;Make It Happen&quot;, &quot;Unusual&quot; and &quot;#1&quot;. &quot;Checkmate!&quot; was a commercial success, reaching the top spot on Oricon and distributed over 500,000 units in Japan. On July 27, Amuro released her first triple A-side single, &quot;Naked/Fight Together/Tempest&quot;. Although it reached number two on Oricon Singles Chart, &quot;Fight Together&quot; was used as the theme song of the anime series &quot;One Piece&quot;. &quot;Naked/Fight Together/Tempest&quot; achieved better sales through digital store and certified double platinum by RIAJ. At the end of July 2011, Amuro conducted her first arena tour Live Style 2011 to promote &quot;Checkmate!&quot; and some new materials taken from her then-upcoming studio record. &quot;Sit! Stay! Wait! Down!/Love Story&quot; was the next double A-side single from Amuro&#x27;s upcoming studio album, released on December 7, 2011. While the physical release of the single exceeded 100,000 units in Japan, &quot;Love Story&quot; shifted over 3 million digital copies throughout Japan, becoming one of Amuro&#x27;s highest-selling singles to date. The single also featured two unreleased tracks: &quot;Higher&quot; and &quot;Arigatou&quot;. &quot;Higher&quot; made an appearance on her Live Style 2011, whereas &quot;Arigatou&quot; was made available as a free download on Amuro&#x27;s official Facebook page. The Live DVD and Blu-ray of the tour were released on December 21, 2011.

The final single, &quot;Go Round/Yeah-Oh!&quot;, was released on March 21, 2012, and continued the 100,000 sales streak in Japan. In April, the singer confirmed the release of her 10th studio and first bilingual album &quot;Uncontrolled&quot;, which premiered on June 27, 2012. The album proved to be commercially successful, reaching the top spot on the Oricon Albums Chart and shifted 500,000 units throughout Japan. &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; also gave her the highest first-week sales of the year, and her 10th overall number one in the region. On September 16, Amuro was scheduled to host a special concert tour in her hometown Okinawa, commemorating her 20th anniversary in the music business. However, due to typhoon warnings in the region, the tour was cancelled and never rescheduled. After debuting her first digital single &quot;Damage&quot; on October 31, Amuro finished the year by conducting her 5 Major Domes Tour 2012 in Japan, spanning between November 24 and December 21, 2012, attended by around 340,000 people. Released on February 27, 2013, the Live DVD and Blu-ray of the tour were placed on the first position by Oricon. Their total sales exceeded 300,000 units in Japan.

===2013–2015: &quot;Feel&quot;, &quot;Ballada&quot; and &quot;Genic&quot;===

On March 6, 2013, Amuro released her double A-side single &quot;Big Boys Cry/Beautiful&quot;. Although both tracks appeared in the commercials for the make-up brand Kosé, its commercial experience resulted in being the singer&#x27;s worst-performing single to date, barely shifting 30,000 units in Japan. Amuro returned to sole-digital releases with her single &quot;Contrail&quot;, which was used as the theme song for the Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) series &quot;Flying Public Relations Office&quot;, and sold over 250,000 digital copies in Japan. Additionally, two more songs were released on the iTunes Store to promote her then-upcoming album: &quot;Hands on Me&quot; and &quot;Heaven&quot;. On July 10, 2013, Amuro released her 11th studio and second bilingual album &quot;Feel&quot;. This was her first studio release through her own record label Dimension Point, which was operated under Avex Trax. Despite offering the track &quot;Beautiful&quot; as a single, it did not appeal on the final track list of the album. It was commercially successful on the Oricon Albums Chart, debuting at the top spot and was certified platinum by RIAJ. In support of the album, Amuro conducted her FEEL Tour 2013, spanning between August 16 and December 23, 2013. The Live DVD and Blu-ray of the tour were released on February 26, 2014. During the course of Amuro&#x27;s digital releases, she was offered to feature in the remake of &quot;Waterfalls&quot;, a song originally recorded by American girl-group TLC. Amuro—who knew the group during the singer&#x27;s sessions with producer Dallas Austin, and whose fellow Okinawa Actors School alumni Speed had been huge fans of TLC—accepted the role, and re-recorded the rap segment as a homage to previous member Lisa &#x27;Left Eye&#x27; Lopes, who had died in a car accident in La Ceiba, Honduras in 2002. Despite being a Japan-only release, Amuro&#x27;s version was criticized due to the announcement of her involvement without the knowledge of Lopes&#x27; family, though Lopes&#x27; sister later stated she had no objections to Amuro&#x27;s inclusion. However, TLC defended Amuro&#x27;s involvement as neither member had access to Lopes&#x27; master recording rights and they &quot;were forced to use creative ways to honor Lisa&#x27;s memory and celebrate this milestone with the fans&quot;.

In 2014, Amuro released her single &quot;Tsuki&quot;, including the title track and two previous digital compositions – &quot;Ballerina&quot; and &quot;Neonlight Lipstick&quot;. The physical single was successful in sales, while the title song achieved a platinum award by the RIAJ. On June 4, 2014, Amuro released &quot;Ballada&quot;, her first conceptual greatest hits compilation. 15 tracks were all selected via a fan poll on the singer&#x27;s website, and a few selection were re-recorded with new vocals and arrangements by Amuro. Additionally, a bonus DVD package included new music videos for her 1990&#x27;s singles &quot;Sweet 19 Blues&quot; and &quot;Can You Celebrate?&quot;, and two newly established videos for &quot;Himawari&quot; and &quot;Four Seasons&quot;. It was placed on the first position by Oricon, and shifted under 500,000 units in Japan. In support of the album, Amuro conducted her second nationwide tour Live Style 2014, spanning between August 22 and December 23, 2014. The Live DVD and Blu-ray of the tour were released on February 11, 2015, through her label Dimension Point. In November 2014, Amuro released her first stand-alone single titled &quot;Brighter Day&quot;, which featured a total of three different tracks and instrumentals. It was moderately successful on the Oricon Singles Chart, whereas the titular track sold over 250,000 digital copies in Japan. That same month, Amuro collaborated with Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai on a song titled &quot;I&#x27;m Not Yours&quot;, which was released as a track on Tsai&#x27;s album &quot;Play&quot; (2014). The music video of the song was published on YouTube on February 2, 2015.

On June 10, 2015, Amuro released her 12th studio and third bilingual album &quot;Genic&quot;. It marked her first record with her own management company Stella88, which she founded after leaving Vision Factory. Despite there being five music videos from the record, the entire collection of tracks were newly recorded and featured no singles. However, it was a commercial success, peaking atop of Oricon Albums Chart and sold 250,000 copies in Japan alone. In collaboration with Google, the music video of &quot;Anything&quot;, one of the songs from &quot;Genic&quot;, was produced as an extension of Google Chrome. To promote the album, Amuro conducted her Livegenic 2015–2016 tour, spanning between September 5, 2015, and February 10, 2016. During the course of her December concert dates, Amuro released her second independent maxi-single &quot;Red Carpet&quot; on December 2, 2015. The B-side track of the single, &quot;Black Make Up&quot;, was used as the ending soundtrack of the anime series &quot;One Piece&quot;. Despite reaching number two on Oricon Singles Chart, the sales of &quot;Red Carpet&quot; slumped and only shifted 36,000 units in Japan, making it one of Amuro&#x27;s lowest-selling singles to date. The Live DVD and Blu-ray of LIVEGENIC 2015–2016 were released on March 2, 2016.

===2016–2018: Return of maxi-single releases, 25th anniversary commemoration, &quot;Finally&quot; and retirement===

On May 18, 2016, Amuro released her third independent maxi-single &quot;Mint&quot;, which was used as the theme song of Fuji TV series &quot;Bokuno Yabai Tsuma&quot; (2016). Despite reaching number four on the region&#x27;s single chart, the digital sales skyrocketed with the music video of the song, and achieved platinum status months later. The same year in June, Amuro accepted an offer by NHK to record the theme song for the Japanese broadcast of 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro. The single was titled &quot;Hero&quot; and saw a rise in its physical sales, achieving a gold certification by RIAJ. On October 26, 2016, Amuro released two songs &quot;Dear Diary&quot; and &quot;Fighter&quot; as a double A-side single &quot;Dear Diary/Fighter&quot;. Both songs were used in &quot;Death Note: Light Up the New World&quot;, a 2016 movie adaption of the manga of the same name.

Amuro conducted her fourth annual tour Live Style 2016–2017, spanning between August 19, 2016, and May 3, 2017. The tour initially scheduled 88 dates, but due to a higher demand and further promotional activities with singles and the unreleased track &quot;Christmas Wish&quot;, Amuro added 13 dates. The Live DVD and Blu-ray of the tour were released on May 3, 2017, and certified gold by RIAJ. On May 31, 2017, Amuro released her single &quot;Just You and I&quot;, which sold over 100,000 digital units according to RIAJ. The following month, Amuro announced her 25th anniversary concert in her hometown Okinawa, which redeemed her cancelled 20th anniversary concert on September 16, 2012, due to typhoon warnings in the region. She opened the show on September 16 and 17, with 52,000 attenders totally (26,000 attenders each day), resulting in being one of the largest for a Japanese concert. Additionally, Amuro announced her third-time collaboration with &quot;One Piece&quot;. The anime&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Hope&quot;, premiered on October 1, 2017.
On September 20, 2017, Amuro&#x27;s 40th birthday, she announced her plan to retire from the music industry on September 16, 2018. Her final compilation album, &quot;Finally&quot;, was released on November 8, 2017. The album includes new recordings and re-recordings of her selected singles from 1992 to 2017. &quot;Finally&quot; became a huge success in Japan – it was placed on the first position by Oricon and sold in 2,250,000 units by the end of 2017. In support of the album, Amuro conducted Final Tour 2018 ~Finally~ as her farewell tour, spanning between February 17 and June 3, 2018. The tour took place in Nagoya Dome, Fukuoka Dome, Sapporo Dome, Osaka Dome and Tokyo Dome. During this tour, Amuro conducted another tour, named Final Tour 2018 ~Finally~ In Asia, to perform in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Taking place in Shenzhen Bay Sports Center, Hong Kong Coliseum and Taipei Arena, Final Tour 2018 ~Finally~ In Asia began on March 17 and concluded on May 20, 2018.

On May 23, 2018, Amuro was awarded &quot;Okinawa&#x27;s National Honor Award&quot; at Okinawa Prefecture Government Office in Naha. By August 21, the total number of pre-ordered Live DVD and Blu-ray of Final Tour 2018 (the concerts in Japan only) exceeded 1 million units in Japan. On August 25, &quot;One Piece&quot; featured the anime version of Amuro at the end of one of its episodes to bid a farewell to her. The Live DVD and Blu-ray of Final Tour 2018 (the concerts in Japan only) were released on August 29, 2018. On September 15, Amuro made her final appearance as an entertainer at the &quot;We ♥ Namie Hanabi Show: I ♥ Okinawa / I ♥ Music&quot; at the Okinawa Convention Center, a commemoration of Amuro&#x27;s career and other cultural and musical aspects in Okinawa. She officially retired from the entertainment industry on September 16, 2018. On September 30, 2018, her official website, official fanclub, official Facebook page, and official online store officially terminated service. On June 16, 2019, Amuro released her entire music collection onto the iTunes store (most of which was previously restricted to Japan), through her label Dimension Point. Her records published by her own label were also released through Apple Music, Apple&#x27;s streaming service, on the same day. In November 2023, 5 years after her continued silence after her retirement, Amuro&#x27;s creative content including her full discography on streaming services, music videos, online stores, and her official YouTube channel were removed from official internet sites. As of January 2025, her official content is still absent from streaming services.

==Artistry==

Amuro has a mezzo-soprano vocal range. By 2000, the English language started to heavily mix in with her music, starting with &quot;Genius 2000&quot;. In several tracks, Amuro would record her vocals in Japanese (and additionally in English), whereas back-up vocalists would provide English translations and marry the two together. By &quot;Play&quot;, the singer would start to record tracks with less electronic synths and beats, particularly with the album track &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. According to Mills, he felt that the song focused more on her vocals than the production. Her final three studio albums, &quot;Uncontrolled&quot;, &quot;Feel&quot; and &quot;Genic&quot;, had multiple full-length English tracks and, although it received positive remarks for experimentation, she was frequently lambasted for her incomprehensible deliveries in most songs.

Throughout her career, Amuro has covered a wide range of musical styles and genres. Her music through the 1990s were influenced by eurobeat and the rise of J-pop music. Additionally, she identifies Madonna and Janet Jackson as her inspirations, despite constant comparisons with sound and imagery by critics and publications alike. &quot;Sweet 19 Blues&quot; stuck with J-pop elements, but she began to experiment with Western genres such as R&amp;B, jungle, acid house, house and jazz. From &quot;Genius 2000&quot;, she worked with American producer Dallas Austin, resulting in a fully adapted hip hop record with elements of J-pop. She carried this sound on with &quot;Style&quot; (2003), another record produced by Austin, and eventually onto &quot;Queen of Hip-Pop&quot; (2005). Amuro&#x27;s transition from J-pop to &quot;more mature, transatlantic&quot; R&amp;B was noted by critics, and the aforementioned title &quot;Queen of Hip-Pop&quot; was used by the Japanese media to identify her (the term &quot;Hip-Pop&quot; is Amuro&#x27;s combination of hip-hop and pop).

In 2007, Amuro released &quot;Play&quot;, which was highlighted as one of her key re-inventions of her entire career. Sonically, the record relied on R&amp;B and hip hop elements, but started to involve contemporary dance-pop music. To an extent, Tills from AllMusic compared the effort to the works of Jennifer Lopez and En Vogue. &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; (2012) saw yet another transition with her sound, leaving R&amp;B and focusing on electronic dance music. Additionally, this saw her first experimentation with full-length English language tracks. Unlike her previous records, &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; ventured into Western practitioners to helm the collection, including the likes of The Nervo Twins, Henrik Nordenback, Christian Fast and Peter Mansson. This trend also moved onto her follow-up album &quot;Feel&quot;, where she worked with artists such as Hook n Sling, Dsign Music and Zedd. Her final studio album, &quot;Genic&quot; (2015), was her first record not handled by Japanese producers, and her second record to include almost all tracks entirely in English (after her 2013 album &quot;Feel&quot;).

==Legacy==

Ever since her debut, Amuro has been classified as one of Japan&#x27;s most prominent and successful singers. In an opined article published by &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, writer Ian Martin encompassed the singer alongside superlatives Yumi Matsutoya, Hikaru Utada, Seiko Matsuda and Hibari Misora as the leading female figures in Japanese music history. Although Martin identified Utada as one of the &quot;only contemporaries&quot; to break the Western society, he felt Amuro was her &quot;most immediate predecessor,&quot; based solely on the fact that &quot;[Amuro] represented a period when Japanese pop was learning to see itself as something that could stand alongside the Western music from which it took many cues.&quot; Additionally, Amuro&#x27;s career has been constantly compared to the likes of Matsuda&#x27;s, both whom grew up in the idol routine and having achieved commercial resilience ever since; music author Motti Regev regarded the musicians as part of the &quot;golden age of J-Pop&quot;, before records declined due to the rise of the digital market in the mid-2000s. Because of her longevity and the numerous musical and imagery re-inventions, numerous publications have referred her as the &quot;Queen of Japanese Pop&quot; and the Japanese equivalent to American singers Janet Jackson and Madonna.

Throughout her years active as a singer, Amuro has sold more than 36 million records in Japan according to Oricon. According to a report by Entertainment Weekly announcing her retirement, she has sold more albums in Japan than Lady Gaga, Katy Perry or Kesha have in the United States combined. As of 2017, this makes her the fifth highest-selling female act, and fourth best-selling female solo act overall, just behind Yumi Matsutoya, Ayumi Hamasaki, Hikaru Utada, and Japanese all-girl idol group AKB48 (see total list here). Additionally, Amuro was ranked the 12th best-selling digital artist according to Japanese digital site Recochoku. The singer has achieved nine number-one studio albums with an additional five compilation/collaborative inclusions, and 10 number-one singles. She is one of the only female solo artists to achieve the most accumulations of million-certified physical singles, with a total of five (&quot;Chase the Chance&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Cry&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re My Sunshine&quot;, &quot;A Walk in the Park&quot; and &quot;Can You Celebrate?&quot; – see her discography for more). &quot;Can You Celebrate?&quot; still remains the best-selling physical release by a female singer—with estimate sales of 2.750 million copies sold in Japan alone. For a brief period in 1996, her second studio album &quot;Sweet 19 Blues&quot; was the best-selling album in Japanese music history. Additionally, she held the record for the highest-opening sales for a female or solo artist until it was challenged by Hikaru Utada&#x27;s 1999 studio album &quot;First Love&quot;, which to this day stands as the best-selling album in Japan.

With her sudden rise to stardom, Amuro was noted by journalists and commentators as a trendsetter to the Japan and across Asia. She eventually became the most prominent figure in fashion magazines and the general press for changing the typical Japanese idol image and styles of women in Japan, in favour of &quot;dyeing their hair brown, plucking their eyebrows... thick-soled/long boots, a miniskirt, tanned-skin and tattoos&quot;. This made her a fashion icon, and created a phenomenon fan base known as Amuraa in the 1990s, with many young girls and women looked up to her fashion, hairstyle and makeup. Additionally, her style has been noted for paving the way for &quot;kogal&quot; fashion trends in Japan, as well as for the &quot;gyaru&quot; subculture. Anthropologist Hiroshi Aoyagi said in 2003 that Amuro changed the stereotypical idol culture. Writer Marwan Kraidy described Amuro in 2005 as part of &quot;Japan&#x27;s rising cultural power&quot; towards the world. Nichi-Bei Josei Jānaru, writing for the &quot;U.S.-Japan Women&#x27;s Journal&quot;, believed the success of &quot;Sweet 19 Blues&quot; was the reason many people emulated her as a role model between 1996 and 1997.

<text>Virginia&#x27;s New River Valley region, colloquially named, is a four-county area along the New River in Southwest Virginia in the United States, including such major features as Claytor Lake, part of the Jefferson National Forest, the city of Radford, the town of Blacksburg, and the river itself, including the Pulaski terminus of the New River Trail State Park.

Local TV stations and tourism marketing promoters use the phrase to mean the counties of Giles, Pulaski, Montgomery and Floyd, the towns within them (e.g., Blacksburg), and the independent City of Radford, all located in the New River watershed. While Floyd County is not on the New River itself, it shares the Little River (New River tributary) with Montgomery and Pulaski.

Radford is nicknamed &quot;The New River City,&quot; as it and the nearby Radford Arsenal are wrapped by bold loops in the river where it turns from flowing northeast to flowing northwest into West Virginia.

The &quot;New River Valley&quot; name is also used by other institutions in the region, including the New River Valley Community College and New River Valley Regional Jail, both in the Pulaski County town of Dublin, although they serve a wider region than the tourism-centered &quot;NRV&quot; promotions. With the exception of Floyd, the communities in the NRV promotion area comprise the statistical Blacksburg–Christiansburg metropolitan area.

Further south in Virginia, outside the &quot;Visit NRV&quot; marketing campaign, the New River also flows through Wythe, Carroll, and Grayson Counties, and its physical watershed includes parts of Tazewell and Bland Counties, and small portions of Smyth and Craig Counties. Outside of Virginia, the New River continues upstream into North Carolina and downstream into West Virginia.

Geologically part of the Great Appalachian Valley, the New River Valley became a contested frontier area in colonial times, and continued during the westward expansion of the United States. The first European to explore the valley was Abraham Wood of Fort Henry in 1671 and settlements began to develop in the 18th century. A branch of the Great Wagon Road led through the valley. The area was the location of several small American Civil War battles.

While the U S. census does not count the &quot;New River Valley&quot; as a region, the government-recognized Blacksburg–Christiansburg metropolitan area includes the three larger counties and the city of Radford; adding Floyd County, population 15,000, puts the &quot;NRV&quot; region&#x27;s population over 190,000. 
The New River Valley has several institutions of higher learning, including Virginia Tech, Radford University, Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine and New River Community College.

<doc id="495027" wikidata="Q209961" url="?curid=495027" title="Chunichi Dragons">
<text>The are a professional baseball team based in Nagoya, the chief city in the Chūbu region of Japan. The team plays in the Central League of Nippon Professional Baseball. They have won the Central League pennant nine times (most recently in 2011) and the Japan Series twice (in 1954 and 2007). They were also champions in the 2007 Asia Series.

==Franchise history==
The Chunichi Dragons were formed in 1936 as the Nagoya Club. The franchise was acquired by the &quot;Chunichi Shimbun&quot; newspaper company in 1946. They became the &quot;Dragons&quot; in 1947, but experimented with a number of variations on their team name before settling on Chunichi Dragons in 1954.

The Dragons&#x27; most famous player, Michio Nishizawa, played for the team from 1936 to 1958. He entered the league as a 15-year-old pitcher. He developed into a 20-game winner by 1939. Nishizawa&#x27;s most memorable pitching feats occurred in 1942. On May 24 of that year, Nishizawa pitched a remarkable twenty-eight complete innings, totalling 311 pitches in a 4–4 tie against the Taiyō Whales at Korakuen Stadium. Later that year, he tossed his first and only no-hitter, accomplishing the feat against the Hankyu team. Despite a career ERA of 2.22, the heavy workload combined with injuries sustained during two years of service in World War II forced him to switch positions to first base, and later the outfield. After early struggles with the bat, Nishizawa developed into a feared hitter. He swatted a then-league record 46 home runs in 1950. His best season came in 1952, when he led the league in both batting average and runs batted in. Altogether, Nishizawa appeared in five All Star Games and won the Best Nine Award three times.

Forkball-specialist Shigeru Sugishita dominated the Central League for the Dragons from 1950 to 1955, winning more than 30 games twice (winning at least 23 games each season), and garnering three Eiji Sawamura Awards.

Led by Sugishita and an aging Nishizawa, the Dragons won their first Japan Series championship in 1954, defeating the Nishitetsu Lions 4-games-to-3.

In 1962, the Dragons became one of the first NPB teams to sign established MLB players when they brought on former stars Larry Doby and Don Newcombe.

Michio Nishizawa went on to manage the team from 1964 to 1967. He was elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977 and his number 15 jersey is one of only two retired by the team.

The Dragons were the first Japanese team to hire a foreigner as manager, Wally Yonamine, who led the team from 1972 to 1977. (Yonamine spoke fluent Japanese, and was later elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame.)

In 1974, the team won the Central League title for the first time in 20 years, and this victory stopped the Yomiuri Giants from winning the league for the tenth consecutive year. Another league title came in 1999, and in that year, Dragons set a record by winning 11 consecutive games at the opening of the season.

In the 2004 season the team reached the Japan Series, but lost to the Seibu Lions, the Pacific League Champions, and in 2006 they lost the Japan Series to the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. At that point the team had won the Central League pennant seven times since 1950, but their last Japan Series victory was in 1954, the longest such drought in Nippon Professional Baseball.

=== 2007 Japan Series title ===

In early 2007, the NPB playoff rules were changed: The top team in the league would advance automatically, while the second and third teams in the league would play a best-of-three series. The winner would face the first-place team in a best-of-five series to see who would advance to the Japan Series finals.

The Dragons took advantage of the new playoff system, and after finishing second in the season standings, swept the Hanshin Tigers in a best-of-three series, then, in a huge upset, swept the heavily favoured Yomiuri Giants in a best-of-five series to advance to the Japan Series against the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. In an exact reversal of the 2006 Japan Series, Hokkaido won game 1 of the series, but the Dragons won the next four straight games, including a combined perfect game from Daisuke Yamai and star closer Hitoki Iwase in the deciding Game 5, to become the 2007 Japan Series Champions, ending 53 years of frustration and the longest Japan Series drought in NPB history. The Japan Series victory allowed the Dragons to advance to the 2007 Asia Series, in which they went 2–1 in the round robin, then defeated the SK Wyverns, 6–5.

=== Since the 2007 Japan Series title ===
Three years later, they faced the Chiba Lotte Marines in the 2010 Japan Series, but lost to the Marines in seven games, including a 2–2 tie in the longest Japan Series game ever, which lasted 15 innings. A year later, the Dragons were back in the 2011 Japan Series, but fell to the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in seven games. In 2012, they made the Central League Climax Series, by first defeating the Tokyo Yakult Swallows in 3 games in the first stage, but lost to the eventual Japan Series champion Yomiuri Giants in 6 games in the final stage, while the Giants also had a 1-game advantage. As of 2022, this was the last time the Dragons made the playoffs; they have had only one winning season since, which came in the pandemic-abbreviated 2020 season.

==Franchise regular season record ==
===Key===


==Uniform==

The Dragons uniforms were based on the Brooklyn (now Los Angeles) Dodgers. The team&#x27;s colors (blue and white) are the same colors worn by the Dodgers (both in Brooklyn and Los Angeles). From the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, the stylized lettering on the Dragons&#x27; jerseys and caps was virtually identical to the Dodgers&#x27; uniforms during that same period.

==Current roster==

==In popular culture==
* The Dragons became known to audiences in the U.S. through the 1992 movie &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot;, starring Tom Selleck and Ken Takakura. The film is based around a difficult season in the career of aging New York Yankees first baseman Jack Elliot (Selleck), who is traded to the Chunichi Dragons during spring training, and is forced to deal with high expectations and cultural differences during the Dragons&#x27; pennant run.
* In Haruki Murakami&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;Kafka on the Shore&quot;, one of the characters, Hoshino, is a devoted fan of the Chunichi Dragons, wearing the team&#x27;s cap everywhere he goes.
* In 2009 a Wii game aimed at children, &quot;Doala de Wii&quot;, was released. The game is based on the team mascot &quot;Doala&quot;.
* The 2012 video game &quot;Yakuza 5&quot; features a team called the &quot;Nagoya Wyverns&quot;, which is a reference to the Dragons. One of the main characters briefly played for the team, and it features heavily in the game&#x27;s plot.

== Mascots ==
The team has 3 mascots, Doala, Shaolon, and Paolon. Doala is the main mascot of the team, and he was introduced in 1994, replacing their former mascot, Gaburi. Doala is a koala because Nagoya was home to Japan&#x27;s first koala due to its sister city status with Sydney. Doala is quite known for his stunts. Shaolon is the team&#x27;s second mascot and was introduced in 1997. He is a blue dragon and he has appeared on the logo for a long while now. Paolon is the team&#x27;s third mascot and she was introduced in 2000. She is a pink dragon.

<doc id="495028" wikidata="Q7257772" url="?curid=495028" title="Public holidays in Chile">
<text>This is a list of public holidays (national or otherwise) in Chile; about half of them are Christian holidays.

== Dates for the year 2025 ==
== History ==
On January 28, 1915, President Ramón Barros Luco promulgated Law 2,977, which organized all available information regarding holidays celebrated in Chile. It established or retained the following holidays:

# Sundays year-round.
# January 1 (Feast of the Circumcision of Christ at the time; New Year in the late 20th and 21st centuries), June 29 (Feast of Saints Peter and Paul), August 15 (Assumption of Mary), December 8 (Immaculate Conception), December 25 (Christmas Day), and the movable holidays of the Ascension of Jesus Christ and Corpus Christi.
# Fridays and Saturdays during Holy Week.
# September 18, Establishment of the First Government Junta in 1810.
# September 19 and May 21, in celebration of the achievements of the Army and the Navy.
# The day of election of electors of the President of the Republic.

The same law abolished, by omission, four religious holidays: Epiphany (&quot;Adoración de los Santos Reyes&quot;, January 6), Carnival (&quot;Carnaval&quot;, movable), Annunciation (&quot;Anunciación del Señor&quot;, March 25), and Nativity of the Virgin Mary (&quot;Natividad de la Virgen&quot;, September 8). It also shortened the national independence holiday to two days (until 1914, they occupied September 18, 19, and 20).

On November 14, 1921, President Arturo Alessandri Palma promulgated Law 3,810, designating October 12 (Columbus Day) as a holiday. On April 30, 1931, President Carlos Ibáñez del Campo promulgated the Decree Enforceable as Law (&quot;Decreto con Fuerza de Ley&quot;) 130, marking May 1 (May Day) as a holiday.

In 1932, Provisional President Bartolomé Blanche reinstated the September 20 holiday, which remained in effect until 1944. In 1968, the holidays of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Ascension of Jesus Christ, and Corpus Christi were eliminated by Article 144 of Law 16,840. The Catholic Church agreed to celebrate them on the nearest Sunday. September 11 (the day of the military coup in 1973) was established as a holiday (&quot;Día de la Liberación Nacional&quot;, &quot;Day of National Liberation&quot;) by the military regime in 1981. In 1998, it was replaced by the &quot;Día de la Unidad Nacional&quot; (&quot;Day of National Unity&quot;), observed on the first Monday in September. In March 2002, the latter was abolished. The holiday on June 29 (Feast of Saints Peter and Paul) was reinstated in September 1985. In 1987, during a visit by Pope John Paul II, Corpus Christi was reinstated (although the Church continued to observe the holiday on the nearest Sunday).

On March 10, 2000, Law 19,668 moved the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, Columbus Day, and Corpus Christi holidays to the preceding Monday if they fell on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, or to the following Monday if they fell on a Friday. Additionally, the designation of Columbus Day was changed from &quot;Aniversario del Descubrimiento de América&quot; to &quot;Día del Descubrimiento de Dos Mundos&quot; (&quot;Discovery of Two Worlds&#x27; Day&quot;), which was an obvious adaptation of the then-recent ubiquitous &quot;Encuentro de dos mundos&quot; (&quot;The Meeting of Two Worlds&quot;) slogan.

On January 6, 2007, Law 20,148 replaced Corpus Christi with Our Lady of Mount Carmel, to be observed on July 16, starting that year. On September 14, 2007, Law 20,215. declared holidays for all September 17s falling on a Monday and all September 20s falling on a Friday. On October 11, 2008, Law 20,299 established Reformation Day on October 31 as a national holiday, starting that year. This holiday is moved to the preceding Friday if it falls on a Tuesday or to the following Friday if it falls on a Wednesday. On April 30, 2013, Law 20,663 established the regional Battle of Arica holiday, to be observed only in the Arica and Parinacota region. On December 30, 2016, Law 20,983 declared as holidays those days that are Monday, January 2, or Friday, September 17. On June 19, 2021, Law 21,357 declared the Winter Solstice as a holiday, honoring Chile&#x27;s aboriginal peoples (&quot;pueblos originarios&quot;).

In addition to yearly holidays, presidential elections have been declared holidays since 1901, as mandated by successive versions of the General Elections law (Law 18,700, being the current one; see laws 1,464, 1,752, 2,977, decree-law 542, 6,250, 6,834, 9,334, and 12,891). Since the late 20th century, parliamentary and municipal elections are also public holidays (see Law 18,700). Censuses, held every ten years, have been declared holidays since 1982; that year&#x27;s census and 1992&#x27;s were so due to ad-hoc laws; censuses taken from 1992 onwards are declared holidays due to a reform in the Census law. (This did not occur in 2012, where the census was carried out over two months, using a different methodology.)

=== Meaning of the January 1 holiday ===

Shortly after Chile&#x27;s independence, an 1824 (government-approved) Church decree reduced the number of religious holidays, enumerating the surviving holidays, including the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ, observed on January 1. Law 2,977 (passed in 1915, still in effect) lists this holiday by date only, without using any name, but it does treat it as a religious one. However, as of 2009, it is widely celebrated as the (civic) New Year holiday. In fact, there are no known regulations later than 1915 that use the name &quot;Circumcision of Christ,&quot; while &quot;New Year&quot; is used in numerous regulations of all types (laws (19.925), decree-laws (&quot;decretos ley&quot;) (1.299, 1.613 and 2,408), decrees enforceable as law (&quot;decretos con fuerza de ley&quot;) (D.F.L. 338 of 1960), ministerial decrees and resolutions (decree 6234 of 1929 of the Public Education Ministry (the oldest such regulation), decree 83 of 1985 of the Labor Ministry, decree 48 of 2007 of the Labor Ministry, and so on) and municipal decrees and ordinances (decree 1316 of 2004 of the Las Condes Municipality, decree 23 of 2006 of the Padre Las Casas Municipality, decree 23 of 2009 of the San Carlos Municipality, and so forth).

<text>Public holidays in South Korea each belong to one or more of three categories: 
*National day ()
*National flag raising day ()
*Public holiday ()
Each category has a different legal basis. All national days are also flag-raising days.

== List of public holidays in South Korea ==

==National celebration days==

These days celebrate events considered joyous to Korea. In the beginning, Independence Declaration Day (March 1) was first stipulated in 1946. After the establishment of the Government of the Republic of Korea in 1948, four major National Celebration Days (Independence Declaration Day, Constitution Day, Liberation Day, National Foundation Day) were provided by &quot;The Law Concerning the National Celebration Days&quot; (국경일에관한법률) in 1949. 
In 2005, Hangul Day became the 5th National Celebration day.

==National flag raising days==

All the National Celebration Days, Memorial Day (half staff), Armed Forces Day are provided by Article 8 of the &quot;National Flag Law&quot; (대한민국국기법 제8조). On these days, the raising of the taegukgi at every house and along every roadside is promoted.

==Public days off==

They are provided by the &quot;Regulations on Holidays of Public Agencies&quot; (관공서의 공휴일에 관한 규정) This Regulation originally applied only to government and public offices, but most individual business offices also follow it.

<doc id="495031" wikidata="Q242049" url="?curid=495031" title="Public holidays in Poland">
<text>[[Holiday]]s in [[Poland]] are regulated by the Non-working Days Act of 18 January 1951 (Ustawa z dnia 18 stycznia 1951 o dniach wolnych od pracy; Journal of Laws 1951 No. 4, Item 28). The Act, as amended in 2010, currently defines thirteen public holidays.

== Public holidays ==

Note: &quot;The table below lists only public holidays, i.e. holidays which are legally considered to be non-working days.&quot;

=== May holidays ===
Under communist rule, 1 May was celebrated as Labour Day with government-endorsed parades, concerts and similar events. The holiday carried over to present day Poland as State Holiday, albeit without any formal connection to International Workers&#x27; Day. In addition, 3 May was reinstated as 3 May Constitution Day. The May holidays (1, 2 and 3 May) are called &quot;majówka&quot; in Polish (roughly translated as &quot;May-day picnic&quot;).

==National and state holidays==
The following are national and state holidays in Poland, although they are normally working days unless declared a public holiday.
* 19 February - Polish Science Day (&quot;Dzień Nauki Polskiej&quot;), established in 2020
* 1 March - National Cursed Soldiers Remembrance Day (&quot;Narodowy Dzień Pamięci „Żołnierzy Wyklętych”&quot;), established in 2011
* 24 March - National Day for the Remembrance of Poles Rescuing Jews under German Occupation (&quot;Narodowy Dzień Pamięci Polaków ratujących Żydów pod okupacją niemiecką&quot;), established in 2018

* 8 May - National Victory Day (&quot;Narodowy Dzień Zwycięstwa&quot;), established in 2015 to replace the old National Victory and Freedom Day

==Former national and state holidays==
In the past, there were public holidays newly established by the communist authorities after the Second World War. These were intended to replace discontinued original national holidays such as the National Independence Day and the 3 May Constitution Day and to serve propaganda purposes. All were canceled after the fall of communism in Poland.
* 9 May - National Victory and Freedom Day (&quot;Narodowe Święto Zwycięstwa i Wolności&quot;), established in 1945, disestablished in 1951 although still celebrated annually by communist authorities (celebrated for the last time in 1989)
* 22 July - National Day of the Rebirth of Poland (&quot;Narodowe Święto Odrodzenia Polski&quot;), set on the anniversary of the PKWN Manifesto&#x27;s signing, established in 1945, abolished in 1990 (celebrated for the last time in 1989)
* 7 November - Great October Socialist Revolution Day (&quot;Wielka Październikowa Rewolucja Socjalistyczna&quot;), although it wasn&#x27;t an official non-working state holiday it was celebrated by communist authorities (celebrated for the last time in 1989)

<text>==Public holidays==
Public holidays in Vietnam are days when workers get the day off work. Prior to 2007, Vietnamese workers observed 8 days of public holiday a year, among the lowest in the region. On 28 March 2007 the government added the traditional holiday commemorating the mythical Hùng kings to its list of public holidays, increasing the number of days to 10. From 2019, Vietnamese workers have 13 public holidays a year. As in most other nations, if a holiday falls during the weekend, it is observed on the following Monday.

== Public holidays in Vietnam 2025 ==
== Other holidays and festivals ==
There are also many other holidays and festivals that are held in Vietnam either nationally or locally. These holidays and festivals do not involve days off but are widely observed and celebrated across the country.

<text>Roger Thomas Staubach (, -; , -; born February 5, 1942), nicknamed &quot;Roger the Dodger&quot;, &quot;Captain America&quot;, and &quot;Captain Comeback&quot;, is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys. He attended the U.S. Naval Academy, where he played college football for the Navy Midshipmen and won the 1963 Heisman Trophy. After graduation, he served in the U.S. Navy, including a tour of duty in Vietnam.

Staubach joined the Dallas Cowboys in 1969, becoming the team&#x27;s second major franchise quarterback after the retirement of Don Meredith in 1968. Staubach played with the Cowboys during his entire career. He led the team to the Super Bowl five times, four as the starting quarterback. He led the Cowboys to victories in Super Bowl VI and Super Bowl XII. Staubach was named Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl VI, becoming the first of four players to win both the Heisman Trophy and Super Bowl MVP, along with Jim Plunkett, Marcus Allen, and Desmond Howard. He was named to the Pro Bowl six times during his 11-year NFL career. Staubach is one of ten players to both win the Heisman Trophy and be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and the only quarterback.

Upon his retirement Staubach founded The Staubach Group, a commercial real estate firm that he later sold to Jones Lang LaSalle for $613 million in 2008. He then became executive chairman of the Americas region of Jones Lang LaSalle until his retirement in 2018. That same year, he received a Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early life==
Staubach was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the only child of Elizabeth (née Smyth) and Robert Staubach. His father was a shoe and leather salesman and his mother worked as a secretary for General Motors. He is of partial German descent, and grew up in Silverton, a northeastern suburb of Cincinnati. He was a Boy Scout as a youth, attended St. John the Evangelist Catholic School, and graduated from the Catholic high school Purcell High School in Cincinnati (now named Purcell Marian High School) in 1960.

==U.S. Naval Academy==
To prepare for his naval career, Staubach spent one year at New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, where he set a school record for passing yards and scored 18 total touchdowns. Staubach entered the U.S. Naval Academy in 1961, and played quarterback for the Midshipmen. As a third-class midshipman (sophomore) in 1962, he got his first opportunity to play, in the third game of the season, against the University of Minnesota on October 6. He relieved starter Ron Klemick as the Minnesota defense, led by Bobby Bell and Carl Eller, was stifling in its 21–0 victory. Staubach was 0–2 passing and was sacked twice for -24 yards.
A week later, playing against Cornell University, with the offense failing, coach Wayne Hardin decided to put Staubach into the game to see if he could improve the team&#x27;s offense. He led Navy to six touchdowns, throwing for 99 yards and two touchdowns, while running for 88 yards and another score as Navy won 41–0.

A few weeks later, Staubach started again in the famous Army–Navy game. President John F. Kennedy attended the game, performing the coin toss. Staubach led the team to a 34–14 upset over Army, throwing for two touchdowns and running for another.

In his second class (junior) season of 1963, he won the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, and the Walter Camp Memorial Trophy while leading the Midshipmen to a 9–1 regular season record and a final ranking of No. 2 in the nation. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; in October; he would also have been on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s November 29, 1963 issue, but for the assassination of President Kennedy.

On New Year&#x27;s Day, the Midshipmen lost the national championship to the No. 1 team, the University of Texas, in the 1964 Cotton Bowl. Earlier that season, Staubach led Navy to a 35–14 road victory in its annual rivalry with Notre Dame. Navy did not beat Notre Dame again until 2007, 43 years later.

During three seasons at Navy, Staubach completed 292 of 463 passes with 18 touchdowns and 19 interceptions, while gaining a school-record 4,253 yards of total offense. Staubach is the last player from a military academy to win the Heisman Trophy. As a senior in 1964, he injured his left heel in the opening game victory over Penn State and missed the next four games, and Navy finished the season at 3–6–1.

The Naval Academy retired Staubach&#x27;s jersey number (12) during his graduation ceremony after his senior season. In 1981, Staubach was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. In 2007, Staubach was ranked No. 9 on ESPN&#x27;s Top 25 Players In College Football History list.

===Statistics===
When his collegiate football career ended, Staubach finished his Academy sports career as captain of the academy&#x27;s 1965 baseball team, and also played for the school&#x27;s basketball team.

==U.S. Navy officer==
During his junior year at the Naval Academy, Staubach&#x27;s color-blindness was detected and he was commissioned directly into the Supply Corps, which did not necessitate being able to tell the difference between red (port) and green (starboard) lights or to discern the color differences in electrical circuitry.

After graduating from the Naval Academy in June 1965, Staubach could have requested an assignment in the United States, but he chose to volunteer for a one-year tour of duty in South Vietnam. He served as a Supply Corps officer for the Navy at the Chu Lai Base Area until 1967. Staubach supervised 41 enlisted men.

Staubach returned from South Vietnam in September 1967, and spent the rest of his naval career in the United States. He played football on various service teams to prepare for his future career in the National Football League. During his tour at the naval air station in Pensacola, Florida, he quarterbacked the Goshawks, a team consisting of fellow U.S. Navy officers like himself, and played games against college football teams. He had access to the Dallas Cowboys playbook, and the Goshawks defeated many of the college teams they played against.

==Professional career==
Staubach was a tenth-round &quot;future&quot; selection in the 1964 NFL draft by the Cowboys. The NFL allowed the Cowboys to draft him one year before his college eligibility was over because he was four years out of high school, although due to his four-year military commitment, he would not play professionally until 1969 as a 27-year-old rookie. He was also drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 16th round (122nd choice overall) of the 1964 American Football League draft, also with a future selection.

While still in the Navy during 1968, he went to the Cowboys&#x27; rookie camp, using most of his annual military leave. During 1969, Staubach resigned his naval commission just in time to join the Cowboys training camp. The Cowboys won their first NFC title in 1970 with Craig Morton starting at quarterback, but lost to the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl V, losing by three points on a last-second field goal.

In 1971, Morton began the season as the starter, but after a loss to the New Orleans Saints, Staubach assumed the role. However, in a game against the Chicago Bears during the seventh week of that season, coach Tom Landry alternated Staubach and Morton on each play, sending in the quarterbacks with the play call from the sideline. Dallas gained almost 500 yards of offense but committed seven turnovers that resulted in a 23–19 loss to a mediocre Bears squad that dropped the Cowboys to 4–3 for the season, two games behind the Washington Redskins in the NFC East race.

Staubach assumed the full-time quarterbacking duties in week eight with a victory over the St. Louis Cardinals and led the Cowboys to 10 consecutive victories, including their first Super Bowl victory, 24–3 over the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI in January 1972. He was named the game&#x27;s MVP, completing 12 out of 19 passes for 119 yards and two touchdowns and rushing for 18 yards. After the season, he negotiated his own contract, a three-year deal at about $75,000 per year.

In 1972, Staubach missed most of the season with a separated shoulder after a collision in a August preseason game. Even when he was ready to play in late season, Landry went with Morton, who ultimately led Dallas to a 11–3 record where Staubach threw just twenty passes the whole season. However, he would relieve Morton in a divisional playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers that saw him go 12-for-20 for 174 yards and throw two touchdown passes in the last 90 seconds to turn a 15-point 4th quarter deficit into a 30–28 victory to send Dallas back to the NFC Championship Game. With that performance, he won back his regular job and did not relinquish it again during his career.

Staubach led the Cowboys to a second Super Bowl win in the 1977 season. He threw for 183 yards, a touchdown, and no interceptions in Dallas&#x27; 27–10 victory in Super Bowl XII over the Denver Broncos, led by his former teammate Morton. Staubach also led the Cowboys to appearances in Super Bowl X and Super Bowl XIII, where they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers both times by a total of eight points.

Staubach&#x27;s offensive teammates included standout receivers &quot;Bullet&quot; Bob Hayes, Lance Alworth, Drew Pearson, and Golden Richards, tight ends Mike Ditka, Billy Joe Dupree, and Jackie Smith, tackle Rayfield Wright, and running backs Robert Newhouse, Calvin Hill, and Tony Dorsett. Dorsett, Hayes, Pearson, and Wright are in the Hall of Fame, as are Alworth, Ditka, and Smith (although those three were all with the Cowboys only at the end of their careers).

During his final NFL season in 1979, Staubach had career highs in completions (267), passing yards (3,586), and touchdown passes (27), with just 11 interceptions. He retired at the conclusion of the season in order to protect his long-term health, declining the Cowboys&#x27; offer for two more seasons. He suffered 20 concussions in his playing career, including six in which he said he was &quot;knocked out&quot;. After suffering two concussions in 1979, a doctor at Cornell told Staubach that while his brain tests were fine at the moment, another concussion could have life-altering consequences. He chose to retire and was replaced as the Cowboys starting quarterback by Danny White.

Overall, Staubach finished his 11 NFL seasons with 1,685 completions for 22,700 yards, 153 touchdowns, and 109 interceptions. He also gained 2,264 rushing yards and scored 21 touchdowns on 410 carries. For regular-season games, he had a .750 winning percentage. Staubach recorded the highest passer rating in the NFL in four seasons (1971, 1973, 1978, 1979) and led the league with 23 touchdown passes in 1973. He was an All-NFC choice five times and selected to play in six Pro Bowls (1971, 1975–1979).

==Legacy and accolades==
Staubach retired from football in March 1980 with the highest career passer rating in NFL history at the time, 83.4, and was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985. In 1999, he was ranked No. 29 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the second-ranked Cowboy behind Bob Lilly.

Staubach was one of the most famous NFL players of the 1970s. Known as &quot;Roger The Dodger&quot; for his scrambling abilities, &quot;Captain America&quot; as quarterback of America&#x27;s Team, and also as &quot;Captain Comeback&quot; for his fourth-quarter game-winning heroics, Staubach had a penchant for leading scoring drives which gave the Cowboys improbable victories. He led the Cowboys to 23 game-winning drives (15 comebacks) during the fourth quarter, with 17 of those in the final two minutes or in overtime.

In the television show &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, Staubach&#x27;s name has been used for the elementary school in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas.

Staubach&#x27;s most famous moment was the &quot;Hail Mary pass&quot; in the 1975 playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings. With seconds on the clock and the Cowboys trailing 14–10, Staubach launched a 50-yard pass to wide receiver Drew Pearson, who caught the pass and strode into the end zone for a 17–14 victory. After the game, Staubach said he threw the ball and said a &quot;Hail Mary&quot;. Since then, any last-second pass to the end zone in a desperate attempt to score a game-winning or tying touchdown is referred to as a &quot;Hail Mary&quot; pass.
In 1976, Staubach received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Staubach was named The Walter Camp &quot;Man of the Year&quot; in 1983, and was awarded the Davey O&#x27;Brien Legends Award in 2001.

On January 25, 2007, Staubach was named chairman of the North Texas Super Bowl XLV Bid Committee, whose goal was to have the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex host the Super Bowl in 2011. On May 23, 2007, the NFL chose Dallas as the host city of Super Bowl XLV.
In 2010, Staubach was named the No. 1 Dallas Cowboy of all time according to a poll conducted by the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;.

In November 2018, Staubach was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Donald Trump, becoming one of only four recipients associated with American Football to receive the distinction. He was the first player to receive the award, given it at the same time as Minnesota Vikings defensive tackle Alan Page. The other two recipients, Earl Blaik and Bear Bryant, were both head coaches.

On Friday, August 18, 2023, Staubach&#x27;s alma mater, Purcell Marian High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, opened its new athletic complex, named Staubach Stadium in honor of Staubach.

==Personal life==

===Family life===
Staubach married his wife Marianne on September 4, 1965. Together they had five children. He and Marianne reside in Dallas, Texas. As of 2017, they have 15 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

===Real estate===
In 1977, he started a commercial real estate business, The Staubach Company, in partnership with Robert Holloway Jr., an associate of Henry S. Miller. He had prepared by working in the off-seasons from 1970 until 1977 for the Henry S. Miller Company. Staubach began working with real estate because &quot;I couldn&#x27;t have retired at my age and just played golf. First of all, they didn&#x27;t pay quarterbacks what they do today. And I was 37 with three kids. I kept thinking about [what would happen] if some linebacker takes off my head and I can&#x27;t play anymore.&quot; He said &quot;Henry Miller Jr. was a lot like [legendary Cowboys coach Tom] Landry. They both had similar haircuts ... they both had phenomenal integrity, great work ethic, and they could transfer their strengths to other people.&quot;

The Staubach Company has been his primary endeavor since retirement from football. The company first developed several office buildings; Holloway managed construction while Staubach found tenants. In 1982, Staubach bought out Holloway and shifted the company&#x27;s emphasis from commercial development to representing corporate clients seeking to lease or buy space. This proved fortuitous as a boom in Dallas office construction followed by a recession in the Texas oil industry left the city with excess office space, so companies representing tenants wielded greater influence. The company has worked with major businesses including AT&amp;T, McDonald&#x27;s Corporation, Hospital Corporation of America and K Mart Corporation. The company was also involved with residential development, with ownership stakes in 27 apartments and other real estate projects in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Some of these were in partnership with Cowboys teammate Bob Breunig through S.B.C. Development Corporation, then a subsidiary of the Staubach Company. Others were collaborations with local developers and investors, including Ross Perot. He served as its chairman and CEO until June 20, 2007, when he announced he would resign as CEO of the multibillion-dollar real estate company he started 30 years earlier.

On July 11, 2008, The Staubach Company was sold to Jones Lang LaSalle for $613 million. Staubach and his children&#x27;s trust would gross more than $100 million from the sale by 2013. The sale provided an initial payment of $9.27 per Staubach share with additional payments due during the ensuing five years for a total of approximately $29/share. Staubach took half of his first payment in Jones Lang LaSalle stock which was then trading at approximately $59.50/share. Staubach served as executive chairman of the Americas region of Jones Lang LaSalle until his retirement in 2018.

===Other work===

During the 1970s and early 1980s, he was a spokesperson for the men&#x27;s clothing retailer Anderson-Little, appearing in both print and television advertisements. Later, he did television advertisements for Rolaids as well.

Staubach served as the president of the philanthropic organization No Greater Love in 1981.

During the early 1980s, Staubach worked for a brief time as a color commentator for CBS Sports&#x27; NFL telecasts. On November 9, 1980, during a close game between the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys, Staubach broadcast a nostalgic comment by exclaiming he would like to be &quot;right down there in the middle of it&quot;. The Cowboys lost 38–35.

Staubach jointly owned Hall of Fame Racing, a NASCAR Nextel Cup Series team, with fellow former Cowboy and hall-of-famer Troy Aikman, which began racing for the 2006 season.

In 2009, Staubach was honored with the &quot;Lombardi Award of Excellence&quot; from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor coach Lombardi&#x27;s legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the &quot;spirit&quot; of the coach.

On December 27, 2011, Staubach wrote the foreword for a book titled &quot;The Power in a Link&quot;, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, authored by United States Military Academy graduate, David Gowel.

<text>Cambodia has numerous public holidays, including memorial holidays and religious holidays of Buddhist origin. The Khmer traditional calendar, known as &quot;Chântôkôtĕ&quot;, is a lunisolar calendar although the word itself means lunar calendar. While the calendar is based on the movement of the moon, calendar dates are also synchronized with the solar year to keep the seasons from drifting.

Therefore, some public holidays are subject to change every year based on the lunar calendar.

<doc id="495045" wikidata="Q128711" url="?curid=495045" title="Epitope">
<text>An epitope, also known as antigenic determinant, is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system, specifically by antibodies, B cells, or T cells. The part of an antibody that binds to the epitope is called a paratope. Although epitopes are usually non-self proteins, sequences derived from the host that can be recognized (as in the case of autoimmune diseases) are also epitopes.

The epitopes of protein antigens are divided into two categories, conformational epitopes and linear epitopes, based on their structure and interaction with the paratope. Conformational and linear epitopes interact with the paratope based on the 3-D conformation adopted by the epitope, which is determined by the surface features of the involved epitope residues and the shape or tertiary structure of other segments of the antigen. A conformational epitope is formed by the 3-D conformation adopted by the interaction of discontiguous amino acid residues. In contrast, a linear epitope is formed by the 3-D conformation adopted by the interaction of contiguous amino acid residues. A linear epitope is not determined solely by the primary structure of the involved amino acids. Residues that flank such amino acid residues, as well as more distant amino acid residues of the antigen affect the ability of the primary structure residues to adopt the epitope&#x27;s 3-D conformation. 90% of epitopes are conformational.

==Function==

=== T cell epitopes ===
T cell epitopes are presented on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell, where they are bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. In humans, professional antigen-presenting cells are specialized to present MHC class II peptides, whereas most nucleated somatic cells present MHC class I peptides. T cell epitopes presented by MHC class I molecules are typically peptides between 8 and 11 amino acids in length, whereas MHC class II molecules present longer peptides, 13–17 amino acids in length, and non-classical MHC molecules also present non-peptidic epitopes such as glycolipids.

=== B cell epitopes ===
The part of the antigen that immunoglobulin or antibodies bind to is called a B-cell epitope. B cell epitopes can be divided into two groups: conformational or linear. B cell epitopes are mainly conformational. There are additional epitope types when the quaternary structure is considered. Epitopes that are masked when protein subunits aggregate are called cryptotopes. Neotopes are epitopes that are only recognized while in a specific quaternary structure and the residues of the epitope can span multiple protein subunits. Neotopes are not recognized once the subunits dissociate.

===Cross-activity===
Epitopes are sometimes cross-reactive. This property is exploited by the immune system in regulation by anti-idiotypic antibodies (originally proposed by Nobel laureate Niels Kaj Jerne). If an antibody binds to an antigen&#x27;s epitope, the paratope could become the epitope for another antibody that will then bind to it. If this second antibody is of IgM class, its binding can upregulate the immune response; if the second antibody is of IgG class, its binding can downregulate the immune response.

==Epitope mapping==
=== T cell epitopes ===
MHC class I and II epitopes can be reliably predicted by computational means alone, although not all in-silico T cell epitope prediction algorithms are equivalent in their accuracy. There are two main methods of predicting peptide-MHC binding: data-driven and structure-based. Structure based methods model the peptide-MHC structure and require great computational power. Data-driven methods have higher predictive performance than structure-based methods. Data-driven methods predict peptide-MHC binding based on peptide sequences that bind MHC molecules. By identifying T-cell epitopes, scientists can track, phenotype, and stimulate T-cells.

=== B cell epitopes ===
There are two main methods of epitope mapping: either structural or functional studies. Methods for structurally mapping epitopes include X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron microscopy. X-ray crystallography of Ag-Ab complexes is considered an accurate way to structurally map epitopes. Nuclear magnetic resonance can be used to map epitopes by using data about the Ag-Ab complex. This method does not require crystal formation but can only work on small peptides and proteins. Electron microscopy is a low-resolution method that can localize epitopes on larger antigens like virus particles.

Methods for functionally mapping epitopes often use binding assays such as western blot, dot blot, and/or ELISA to determine antibody binding. Competition methods look to determine if two monoclonal antibodies (mABs) can bind to an antigen at the same time or compete with each other to bind at the same site. Another technique involves high-throughput mutagenesis, an epitope mapping strategy developed to improve rapid mapping of conformational epitopes on structurally complex proteins. Mutagenesis uses randomly/site-directed mutations at individual residues to map epitopes. B-cell epitope mapping can be used for the development of antibody therapeutics, peptide-based vaccines, and immunodiagnostic tools.

==Epitope tags==

Epitopes are often used in proteomics and the study of other gene products. Using recombinant DNA techniques genetic sequences coding for epitopes that are recognized by common antibodies can be fused to the gene. Following synthesis, the resulting epitope tag allows the antibody to find the protein or other gene product enabling lab techniques for localisation, purification, and further molecular characterization. Common epitopes used for this purpose are Myc-tag, HA-tag, FLAG-tag, GST-tag, 6xHis, V5-tag and OLLAS. Peptides can also be bound by proteins that form covalent bonds to the peptide, allowing irreversible immobilisation. These strategies have also been successfully applied to the development of &quot;epitope-focused&quot; vaccine design.

== Epitope-based vaccines ==

The first epitope-based vaccine was developed in 1985 by Jacob et al. Epitope-based vaccines stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses using isolated B-cell or T-cell epitopes. These vaccines can use multiple epitopes to increase their efficacy. To find epitopes to use for the vaccine, in silico mapping is often used. Once candidate epitopes are found, the constructs are engineered and tested for vaccine efficiency. While epitope-based vaccines are generally safe, one possible side effect is cytokine storms.

==Neoantigenic determinant==
A neoantigenic determinant is an epitope on a neoantigen, which is a newly formed antigen that has not been previously recognized by the immune system. Neoantigens are often associated with tumor antigens and are found in oncogenic cells. Neoantigens and, by extension, neoantigenic determinants can be formed when a protein undergoes further modification within a biochemical pathway such as glycosylation, phosphorylation or proteolysis. This, by altering the structure of the protein, can produce new epitopes that are called neoantigenic determinants as they give rise to new antigenic determinants. Recognition requires separate, specific antibodies.

<text>Nathan Beverly Stubblefield (November 22, 1860 – March 28, 1928) was an American inventor best known for his wireless telephone work. Self-described as a &quot;practical farmer, fruit grower and electrician&quot;, he received widespread attention in early 1902 when he gave a series of public demonstrations of a battery-operated wireless telephone, which could be transported to different locations and used on mobile platforms such as boats. While this initial design employed conduction, in 1908 he received a U.S. patent for a wireless telephone system that used magnetic induction. However, he was ultimately unsuccessful in commercializing his inventions. He later went into seclusion, and died alone in 1928.

Disagreement exists whether Stubblefield&#x27;s communications technology can be classified as radio, and if his 1902 demonstrations could be considered the first &quot;radio broadcasts&quot;. Most reviews of his efforts have concluded that they were not radio transmissions, because his devices, although they used a form of &quot;wireless&quot;, employed conduction and inductive fields, while the standard definition of radio is the transmission of electromagnetic radiation. However, Stubblefield may have been the first to simultaneously transmit audio wirelessly to multiple receivers, albeit over relatively short distances, while predicting the eventual development of broadcasting on a national scale.
==Biography==

===Early years and family life===
Stubblefield was the second of seven sons of William &quot;Captain Billy&quot; Jefferson Stubblefield (1830–1874), a Confederate Army veteran and lawyer, and Victoria Bowman (1837–1869), who died of scarlet fever. Stubblefield grew up in Murray, Kentucky, and his education included tutoring by a governess, followed by attendance at a boarding school in nearby Farmington called the &quot;Male and Female Institute&quot;. His formal education ended in 1874, at the age of 14, with his father&#x27;s death, which left Stubblefield an orphan in the care of his step-mother. However, he continued to develop his technical knowledge by reading contemporary scientific publications, such as &quot;Scientific American&quot; and &quot;Electrical World&quot;.

In 1881 he married Ada Mae Buchannan, by whom he had nine children, two dying in infancy. Six of Nathan&#x27;s surviving children left no descendants. The seventh, Oliver (RayJack), married Priscilla Alden, who gave birth to two daughters and Nathan&#x27;s only grandson, Keith Stubblefield, who would become a television and recording personality under the professional name Troy Cory.

Initially Stubblefield supported his family by farming. (His farm land later became part of the campus of Murray State University.) From 1907 to 1911, he operated a home school called &quot;The Nathan Stubblefield Industrial School,&quot; or &quot;Teléph-on-délgreen Industrial School&quot;.

==Inventions==
Despite very limited finances, in his spare time Stubblefield worked on developing a series of inventions. His first patent, , was issued on November 3, 1885, for a tool for lighting coal oil lamps without having to remove the glass chimney.

===Acoustic telephone===
In late 1886, Stubblefield began to sell and install acoustic telephones—an early and somewhat limited form of the telephone, which, instead of using electricity, employed a taut wire to carry sound vibrations directly between two soundboxes which were located at the far ends of the wire. Although most installations were around Murray, he also made sales as far away as Mississippi and Oklahoma. On February 21, 1888, Stubblefield and partner Samuel Holcomb received for their &quot;mechanical telephone&quot; design. However, the establishment of a local Bell Telephone franchise, whose electric telephones were far superior to Stubblefield&#x27;s offerings, ended most of the acoustic sales by 1890.

===Earth battery===
In 1898, Stubblefield was issued for an &quot;electric battery&quot;, which was an electrolytic coil of iron and insulated copper wire that was immersed in liquid or buried in the ground. Stubblefield made the unsubstantiated claim that, combined with normal battery operation, his device also drew additional power from the earth. However, it did successfully serve as both a power source and ground terminal for wireless telephony.

===Wireless telephony===
After the winding-down of his acoustic telephone business, Stubblefield reviewed possible alternatives that would avoid infringing on the Bell telephone patents, and began researching wireless options. Because he never filed for a patent for his early work, the technical details of his experiments are largely unknown. But, based on contemporary descriptions, it appears that they initially employed induction, similar to a wireless telephone developed by Amos Dolbear, which was issued in 1886. Information for this period is very limited, but in 1935 a former neighbor, Rainey T. Wells, reported that in 1892 Stubblefield gave him a telephone receiver, and had Wells walk a short distance away from Stubblefield&#x27;s shack, after which he was amazed to distinctly hear the words &quot;Hello, Rainey&quot;, followed by additional speech from Stubblefield.

Because later references refer to earth connections, it appears that Stubblefield subsequently switched to using ground currents instead of induction. Following a decade of research and testing, he felt that his wireless telephone had now been perfected to the point that it was ready for commercialization, and began a series of demonstrations to publicize his work and attract investment. On Christmas Eve, December 24, 1901, he successfully transmitted ¼ mile (400 meters) to his home, where &quot;A party of children were gathered there and at the receiver obtained messages from Santa Claus&quot;, and had local residents sign affidavits attesting to the success of his tests.

A much more ambitious demonstration was given on January 1, 1902. Assisted by his 14-year-old son, Bernard, &quot;hundreds of people&quot; in Murray witnessed a test where &quot;From a station in the law office of a friend over a transmitter of his own invention [Stubblefield] gave his friends a New Year&#x27;s greeting by wireless telephony, and at seven stations, located in different business houses and offices in the town, the message was simultaneously delivered. Music, songs, whispered conversations could be heard with perfect ease.&quot; This in turn attracted the attention of the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, which sent a reporter to Murray to personally review Stubblefield&#x27;s wireless telephone. A detailed, and positive, account appeared in the newspaper, which quoted an optimistic Stubblefield as saying that, in addition to point-to-point private communication, his system was &quot;capable of sending simultaneous messages from a central distributing station over a very wide territory. For instance, anyone having a receiving instrument, which would consist merely of a telephone receiver and a signalling gong, could, upon being signalled by a transmitting station in Washington, or nearer, if advisable, be informed of weather news. My apparatus is capable of sending out a gong signal, as well as voice messages. Eventually, it will be used for the general transmission of news of every description.&quot;

However, the unrestricted reception of signals from Stubblefield&#x27;s device meant that there was still a major limitation in its intended use for personal communication. Although he exuberantly declared: &quot;The possibilities of the invention seem to be practically unlimited, and it will be no more than a matter of time when conversation over long distances between the great cities at the country will be carried on daily without wires&quot;, he also admitted: &quot;I have as yet devised no method whereby it can be used with privacy. Wherever there is a receiving station the signal and message may be heard simultaneously. Eventually I, or some one, will discover a method of tuning the transmitting and receiving instruments so that each will answer only to its mate.&quot;
At this point a promoter, Gerald Fennel, traveled to Murray from New York City to enlist Stubblefield in a commercial venture. While negotiating, Stubblefield next embarked on his most publicized promotional trip. On March 20, 1902, he demonstrated his system in Washington, D.C., where voice and music transmissions were made over a third of a mile (535 meters) from the steamer &quot;Bartholdi&quot;, anchored in the Potomac River, to shore. This particular test was reported in prestigious scientific publications, including &quot;Scientific American&quot;, which claimed that Stubblefield&#x27;s invention would be installed by the &quot;Gordon Telephone Company, of Charleston, S. C., for the establishment of telephonic communication between the city of Charleston and the sea islands lying off the coast of South Carolina&quot;, and &quot;Nature&quot;, which noted: &quot;The system used is an earth-conduction one, and is, therefore, similar in principle to, though doubtless differing in detail from, many other wireless telephony systems which are being tried in various countries.&quot;

In early 1902 three New York City residents, J. B. Green, W. B. Whelpley, and Wm. T. Quinn, incorporated, in the Territory of Arizona, the Wireless Telephone Company of America. The firm had a $5,000,000 capitalization, with shares set at a par value of $1 each. Gerald Fennel offered Stubblefield 500,000 shares of stock in exchange for the rights to his wireless telephone technology. A June 1902 stock-promotion advertisement for the company, echoing the excessive claims of contemporary wireless telegraph companies, proclaimed: &quot;With the vast savings made in cost and maintenance by the Stubblefield system, it is not unreasonable to expect that the earnings of Bell Telephone will be easily equalled by those of this company. Its stock at 25c. places the subscriber on the same basis as the earliest investors in Bell, whose profits have amounted to over 2,000%&quot;. This advertisement also stated that regional sub-companies would be established throughout the United States.

With travel expenses financed by Fennel, Stubblefield made additional successful demonstrations in Philadelphia from May 30 to June 7, 1902, spanning a distance of around a mile (1600 meters). Tests followed in New York City beginning on June 11, 1902, which were less successful, with the explanation for the difficulties encountered including the rocky soil in Battery Park, and electrical interference from local alternating current power distribution.

Stubblefield quickly became distrustful of the promoters behind the Wireless Telephone Company of America, and, in a letter dated June 19, 1902, severed his connections as a director after expressing his concern that the company was being fraudulently run. Two months later, the company announced that it had merged its operations with the Collins Wireless Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, a company that had been organized to promote the work of Archie Frederick Collins, who had been doing research on conductive and inductive wireless telephone systems very similar to Stubblefield&#x27;s. The fanciful stock solicitations now claimed that there were plans to &quot;license subsidiary companies in each state of the Union&quot;.

Stubblefield returned to Murray, where he faced considerable skepticism—a March 1903 review of his &quot;earth battery&quot; and wireless telephony endeavors stated: &quot;...the people in this section of the country are yet wondering whether he is simply a crank or will yet emerge some day from his obscurity to astonish the whole civilized world with a great discovery&quot;. Later that same year, he posted a Public Notice in the &quot;Murray Ledger&quot; stating that the Wireless Telephone Company of America had &quot;gone out of existence&quot;, and &quot;My inventions have reverted back to me.&quot; He also noted that he was continuing his wireless telephone research, using the &quot;over two thousand dollars&quot; he had received from that company&#x27;s promoter.

Stubblefield returned once again to investigating using induction, rather than conduction, for his wireless telephone system. This approach employed large circular induction coils, that no longer needed ground connections. He carefully documented his progress, preparing affidavits that in 1903 he had transmitted , and in 1904 reached . The total wire required for the transmitting and receiving coils was greater than the distance between the transmitter and receiver, but the invention allowed mobility. Bernard Stubblefield reported that in 1907, using a coil, transmitting and receiving spanned &quot;¼ mile (400 meters) nicely.&quot;

Encountering difficulty in obtaining a patent, Nathan Stubblefield moved for a time to Washington, D.C. to speed up the process. On May 12, 1908, he was granted U.S. patent for his new version of a wireless telephone. The patent application stated that it would be usable for &quot;securing telephonic communications between moving vehicles and way stations&quot;. An accompanying diagram shows wireless telephony from a fixed location to passing trains, boats, and wagons.

Despite receiving a patent and some financial backing from Murray residents, and the assertion that &quot;while messages have been sent for distances less than ten miles, he is confident that with his machine he can talk across the Atlantic&quot;, Stubblefield made no headway in commercializing his latest invention. By now continuous-wave arc and alternator radio transmitters had been developed, which were capable of wireless telephone communication over distances that dwarfed the short ranges attainable by induction wireless systems, in addition to being able to be tuned to multiple transmitting frequencies. The invention of vacuum-tube radio transmitters in the mid-1910s would make possible, in the early 1920s, the nationwide broadcasting that Stubblefield had envisioned in 1902. But Stubblefield himself made no further progress beyond his previous work.

==Final years==
Stubblefield later lived in self-imposed isolation in a crude shelter near Almo, Kentucky and died around March 28, 1928, although his body, &quot;gnawed by rats&quot;, was not discovered until a couple days later. Although many later accounts state that he died of starvation, at the time of his death a coroner was quoted as saying &quot;he apparently was a victim of heart disease&quot;. He was initially buried in an unmarked grave in the Bowman family cemetery in Murray, Kentucky.

==Legacy==
Although Stubblefield&#x27;s inventions did not lead directly to the development of radio technology, the public demonstrations in 1902 and the extensive press coverage may have helped spur interest in the possibilities of wireless transmission of voice and music, as most prior inventors had merely sought to provide point-to-point communication, to compete with telephone and telegraph companies.

Since his death, various individuals and groups in Murray, Kentucky, have promoted Murray as the Birthplace of Radio, and Stubblefield as the Father of Broadcasting. Loren J. Hortin, Journalism Professor at Murray State, organized his students to investigate Stubblefield&#x27;s work, leading to the dedication of a monument on the campus in 1930. Hortin, adopting an expanded definition of &quot;radio&quot; to include wireless transmissions that did not employ electromagnetic radiation, later contended: &quot;Radio is a device that transmits and receives voice over considerable distance without connecting wires. Stubblefield invented, manufactured, and demonstrated such a device and did so before anyone else on the planet.&quot; However, there had actually been earlier audio wireless transmissions, including, beginning in 1880, the photophone, invented by Alexander Graham Bell and Charles Sumner Tainter, which employed light beams, and Amos Dolbear&#x27;s &quot;electrostatic telephone&quot;, for which it was noted in 1884 that &quot;with this instrument we can telephone, not only without wires, but without even a beam of light&quot;.

In 1948, Murray, Kentucky&#x27;s first radio station began broadcast operations, and in honor of Nathan B. Stubblefield, the owners selected WNBS as the station&#x27;s call letters. In 1952, his family installed a memorial headstone at his gravesite, which credits him as the &quot;Inventor of Wireless Telephony, or Radio&quot;. The Murray State University physics club is also named in his honor.

In 1991, Kentucky Governor Wallace G. Wilkinson issued a proclamation declaring that Stubblefield &quot;is the true inventor of radio&quot; and proclaimed 1992 as &quot;Nathan Beverly Stubblefield Year&quot; in Kentucky.

<doc id="495055" wikidata="Q734523" url="?curid=495055" title="Ricardo Sanchez">
<text>Ricardo Sanchez (born September 9, 1953) is a former lieutenant general in the United States Army.

==Early life and education==
Sánchez was born into a Mexican American family in Rio Grande City, Texas. He spent one year at the University of Texas at Austin on an ROTC scholarship, eventually transferring to Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, where he graduated in 1973 with a double major in mathematics and history. Sánchez was named a Distinguished Military Graduate (DMG), meaning he was in the top 20% of all ROTC cadets in the nation. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army.

==Career==

Sánchez became a platoon leader in the 82nd Airborne Division, stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. By 1977, he had transferred from the infantry to armor. He received promotions regularly and was stationed at posts in the United States, South Korea, Panama and Germany.

In 1991, then Lieutenant Colonel Sánchez served as a battalion commander during Operation Desert Storm, successfully leading his unit of the 197th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) to Basra without suffering any casualties. Shortly after the Gulf War, Sánchez was promoted to colonel and given command of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division. Afterwards, he served on the staff of U.S. Southern Command, first as deputy chief of staff then as director of operations.

On July 10, 2001, by then a general, Sánchez became commander of 1st Armored Division under V Corps. He held that position for nearly two years, including commanding the division during the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, before assuming command of V Corps on June 14, 2003. On this date he also became commander of Combined Joint Task Force 7, the coalition ground forces in the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq. Much of Sánchez&#x27;s time commanding 1st Armored Division had been as a brigadier general.

===Commander of Coalition Ground Forces in Iraq===

====June 2003 to June 2004====
Sánchez held the top military position in Iraq during what was arguably one of the most critical periods of the war—the year after the fall of the Hussein regime, and the time the insurgency took root and began its counterattack. Highlights during his tenure as commander in Iraq include the killing of Uday and Qusay Hussein, and the capture of Saddam Hussein.

He was in command when the abuse of prisoners occurred most notably at Abu Ghraib prison. Some have been highly critical of the U.S. military&#x27;s failure to hold senior officers accountable, as blame for abuses at Abu Ghraib and other detention centers was placed only on a few individuals of the lowest rank.

Sánchez was succeeded as commander of coalition ground forces in Iraq by a four-star general: former Army Vice Chief of Staff George Casey. This changeover was part of a larger split in responsibilities as Sánchez&#x27;s former command, Combined Joint Task Force 7 under a three-star general, was superseded by Multi-National Force Iraq under a four-star general.

====Disunity in leadership====
L. Paul Bremer was the leader of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. As the appointed authority, Bremer wanted national elections to take place only after the creation of a constitution that included basic principles about the election process. This led to the delay of the elections, which led to serious problems. It was during this time that the power vacuum within Baghdad was being filled by a Shi&#x27;a cleric, a factor that Bremer failed to take into account. Insurgency among Sunni civilians first became a problem when American troops first became a presence on Iraqi soil. This insurgency led to Bremer kicking all the Sunni Ba&#x27;thists out the Iraqi administration and the disbandment of the Iraqi army via Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2, which only prompted a harsh response from the American troops. This was a very poor decision on Bremer&#x27;s part, according to Sánchez, who viewed the insurgency as mostly provoked by Bremer. He is quoted as saying,

When you take a father in front of his family and put a bag over his head and put him on the ground, you have a significant adverse effect on his dignity and respect in the eyes of his family.

There was almost a complete failure to communicate between Bremer, the top civilian, and Sánchez, the military leader. According to journalist Thomas Ricks: &quot;It was very clear they hated each other. They lived in the same palace and didn&#x27;t talk to each other.&quot; This disunity in leadership has been cited as one of the major failures of the first year of the Iraq War.

====Abu Ghraib scandal====
Sánchez was commander of coalition forces during a period when abuse of prisoners occurred at Abu Ghraib and at other locations. In a memo signed by General Sánchez and later acquired by the ACLU through a Freedom of Information Act request, techniques were authorized to interrogate prisoners, included &quot;environmental manipulation&quot; such as making a room hot or cold or using an &quot;unpleasant smell&quot;, isolating a prisoner, disrupting normal sleep patterns and &quot;convincing the detainee that individuals from a country other than the United States are interrogating him.&quot;

On May 5, 2006, Sánchez denied ever authorizing interrogators to &quot;go to the outer limits&quot;. Sánchez said he had told interrogators: &quot;...we should be conducting our interrogations to the limits of our authority.&quot; Sanchez called the ACLU: &quot;...a bunch of sensationalist liars, I mean lawyers, that will distort any and all information that they get to draw attention to their positions.&quot;

Documents obtained by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and the ACLU showed that Sanchez authorized the use of military dogs, temperature extremes, reversed sleep patterns, and sensory deprivation as interrogation methods in Abu Ghraib. A November 2004 report by Brigadier General Richard Formica found that many troops at the Abu Ghraib prison had been following orders based on a memorandum from Sanchez, and that the abuse had not been carried out by isolated &quot;criminal&quot; elements. ACLU lawyer Amrit Singh said in a statement from the union that &quot;General Sanchez authorized interrogation techniques that were in clear violation of the Geneva Conventions and the army&#x27;s own standards.&quot;

===Military career after Iraq===
In June 2004, Sánchez relinquished command of the Multi-National Force Iraq (MNF-I) to General George Casey, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. Sánchez returned to Germany, where he continued as Commanding General, V Corps. He was briefly considered for promotion to four-star rank with assignment as Commander, Southern Command; nomination would have required Senate confirmation, which would have been contentious due to the Abu Ghraib scandal. He was not nominated; the position went to General Bantz Craddock.

On September 6, 2006, Sánchez relinquished command of V Corps in a ceremony at Campbell Barracks, Heidelberg, Germany. Sánchez had commanded the corps for more than 3 years; longer than any previous commander in the unit&#x27;s history. In deference to Sánchez&#x27; longevity, he relinquished command to General David McKiernan, Commanding General, US Army Europe and Seventh Army, his higher commander, instead of to a successor.

Sánchez retired on November 1, 2006, culminating 33 years of Army service. Sánchez now lives in his home state of Texas.

In May 2008 Sanchez&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Wiser in Battle: a Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot; was published by HarperCollins Publishers. The book focused mostly on Sanchez&#x27;s frustrations following his appointment to command coalition ground forces in Iraq in 2003.

===2012 U.S. Senate campaign===
In May 2011, Sánchez announced that he was considering a candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat held by Kay Bailey Hutchison in the 2012 elections. If he ran, Sánchez indicated that his campaign would be guided by the tenets of Catholic faith, as well as his experiences in growing up so poor that members of his family used cardboard to cover holes in their shoes. On December 16, 2011, he announced that he would not run, citing a fire that destroyed his home and other concerns. In a statement to his followers Sanchez stated:

I am very grateful for the strong support and encouragement I have received from supporters across the country and the wonderful Texans I have met in every part of our great state. However, pressing personal challenges, coupled with the recent loss of our home due to fire and lagging fundraising numbers make a statewide election campaign impractical for me at this time.

After extensive consultation with my family, Maria Elena and I have decided to put family first and I will therefore end my campaign for the 2012 U.S. Senate seat as of today.

I am blessed to have made friends with so many great Texans on this journey. Their personal stories and their love for our homeland will continue to inspire me as I look ahead and consider future opportunities for public service. I remain steadfast in the desire to serve both my country and the State of Texas to help bring new, responsible, and fair-minded leadership to our government. 
May God Bless Texas and May God Bless America.

===Criticism of the media and political leadership===
Speaking to a group of military reporters and editors in Washington, D.C., on October 12, 2007, Sanchez lambasted the media for &quot;sensationalist&quot; coverage and &quot;self-aggrandizement&quot; and expressing the belief that reporters were willing to &quot;compromise [their] integrity&quot; and &quot;display questionable ethics&quot; to get front page stories:
The death knell of your ethics has been enabled by your parent organizations who have chosen to align themselves with political agendas. What is clear to me is that you are perpetuating the corrosive partisan politics that is destroying our country and killing our servicemen who are at war.

My assessment is that your profession, to some extent, has strayed from these ethical standards and allowed external agendas to manipulate what the American public sees on TV, what they read in our newspapers and what they see on the web. For some of you, just like some politicians, the truth is of little to no value if it does not fit your preconceived notions, biases and agendas.

Sánchez went on to criticize the partisanship that has characterized America&#x27;s political leadership on Iraq:

There has been a glaring, unfortunate, display of incompetent strategic leadership within our national leaders. As a Japanese proverb says, &quot;Action without vision is a nightmare.&quot; There is no question that America is living a nightmare with no end in sight.

Since 2003, the politics of war have been characterized by partisanship as the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington. National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered the lives of our sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority than our national security objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure is the first step toward achieving victory in Iraq — without bipartisan cooperation we are doomed to fail. There is nothing going on in Washington that would give us hope.

Sánchez has become the most senior retired general to criticize American political leadership of the war.

<doc id="495056" wikidata="Q6678637" url="?curid=495056" title="Loplop">
<text>Loplop, or more formally, Loplop, Father Superior of the Birds, is the name of a birdlike character that was an alter ego of the Dada-Surrealist artist Max Ernst. Ernst had a ongoing fascination with birds, which often appear in his work. Loplop functioned as a familiar animal. William Rubin wrote of Ernst &quot;Among his more successful works of the thirties are a series begun in 1930 around the theme of his alter ego, Loplop, Superior of the Birds.&quot; Loplop is an iconic image of surrealist art, the painting &quot;Loplop Introduces Loplop&quot; (1930) appears on the front cover of the Gaëtan Picon&#x27;s book &quot;Surrealist and Surrealism 1919-1939&quot;, and the drawing and collage &quot;Loplop Presents&quot; (1932) was used as the frontispiece of Patrick Waldberg&#x27;s book &quot;Surrealism&quot;. 

== The series ==
Loplop first appeared in Ernst&#x27;s collage novels &quot;La Femme 100 Têtes&quot; and &quot;Une Semaine de Bonté&quot; in the role of a narrator and commentator, followed by a number of works into the mid 1930s, forming an informal series of collages, paintings, and mixed media works. 

Loplop&#x27;s image was not a fixed character, but highly variable in appearance and seldom depicted in the same way twice. Typically (but not always), Loplop had the head of a bird, which could be highly abstracted, often a bird with a crest, comb, or wattle. The body was a square or rectangular space (a canvas, frame, easel, or wall), with the arms and legs being zoomorphic or geometric abstraction in form. Within the &quot;body&quot;, an image, a piece of Max Ernst&#x27;s art is presented (a collage, frottage, painting, etc.) which could be equal to, or function independently from the rest of the work. See external links below, The Menil Collection, Houston, Texas: 3 Loplop drawings, for some typical examples. 

The German art historian Uwe M. Schneede offered his view —
By letting his pictures be presented through an intermediary — his art figure — rather than by himself, Ernst has changed his role, or, better still, he is showing more clearly where he stands in relation to his work. The artist-and-model iconography is adopted and, at the same time, twisted. The artist appears as his own exhibitor and intermediary: he shows his products and thus demonstrates their availability. This seems to indicate a basic change in Ernst relation toward his artistic activity — a kind of coming into the clear. At forty, he seems to have freed himself from the need to pictorialize oppressive childhood experiences and also from the rules of Surrealism, to the point where he can —with sovereign ease — make his liberating creative work (and thus the creative process itself) his main theme. 

Samantha Kavky stated in the abstract of her journal article &quot;Authorship and Identity in Max Ernst&#x27;s Loplop&quot; — 
I suggest that Ernst models Loplop on the father/totem, as defined by Sigmund Freud in his &quot;Totem and Taboo&quot; of 1913. An exploration of Ernst&#x27;s interpretation of Freudian theory in creating Loplop illuminates the character&#x27;s surprising complexity and centrality to Ernst&#x27;s oeuvre. As a totem, Loplop emerges from a primary oedipal conflict on which Ernst structures his artistic identity and practice. Equating traditional notions of creative authorship with various forms of patriarchal authority, Ernst&#x27;s constructed totem signifies his personal, aesthetic and political rejection of individual mastery in favour of his fraternal allegiance to the surrealist group and his embrace of surrealist automatist practices.
Ernst was familiar with Freud&#x27;s writing and titled one of his later paintings &quot;Totem and Taboo&quot; (1941, private collection).

* Rikki Ducornet&#x27;s novel &quot;Phosphor in Dreamland&quot; (1995) partially concerns the plight of the &quot;lôplôp&quot; bird, endemic to the fictionalized Caribbean island of Birdland. Perhaps deliberately to keep with the variability of Ernst&#x27;s loplop, Ducornet never describes the lôplôp in detail but instead emphasizes its shape-shifting capabilities, usually into that of a woman with animal body parts.

<text>The School of Brentano was a group of philosophers and psychologists who studied with and were influenced by Franz Brentano. While it was never a school in the traditional sense, Brentano tried to maintain some cohesion in the school. However, two of his most famous students, Alexius Meinong and Edmund Husserl, ultimately moved radically beyond his theories.

Among the School of Brentano are counted several founders of new schools and movements (place and period they studied with Brentano):
*Carl Stumpf (Würzburg, 1866–1870), taught Aron Gurwitsch and became the head of the Berlin School (Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, Wolfgang Köhler)
*Edmund Husserl (Vienna, 1884–1886), founded the phenomenological movement, influencing:
**Munich phenomenology (Johannes Daubert, Adolf Reinach)
**Existential phenomenology (Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Martin Heidegger)
*Alexius Meinong (Vienna, 1875–1878), was the head of the Graz School, and he influenced among others Stephan Witasek, Alois Höfler, Vittorio Benussi
*Christian von Ehrenfels, credited with the introduction of the notion of &quot;Gestalt&quot;, which led to the establishment of Gestalt psychology
*Kazimierz Twardowski (Vienna, 1885–1889), became father of the Lwów–Warsaw school of logic (Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Władysław Witwicki, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz and Alfred Tarski)
*Anton Marty (Würzburg, 1866–1870), developed a detailed theory of language with his disciple Karl Bühler, which influenced Reinach (who developed a theory of speech acts long before John Austin), whose lectures were attended by Franz Kafka 
*Sigmund Freud, founded psychoanalysis

Other students were:
*Alois Höfler
*Benno Kerry
*Tomáš Masaryk
*Rudolf Steiner

Scholars such as Roderick Chisholm, George Edward Moore, Gilbert Ryle, John Searle, Barry Smith, Kevin Mulligan, Peter Simons and Jan Woleński have propagated Brentano&#x27;s influence to analytic philosophy through their research, editions and publications.

Through the works and teachings of his pupils the philosophy of Franz Brentano has been spread far and wide and indirectly influenced many if not most of the debates in contemporary philosophy, cognitive science and philosophy of mind.

<doc id="495063" wikidata="Q703031" url="?curid=495063" title="Baby &amp; Me">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Marimo Ragawa. It was published in Hakusensha&#x27;s magazine &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; from 1991 to 1997. In North America, it was published by Viz Media. In 1995, &quot;Baby &amp; Me&quot; received the 40th Shogakukan Manga Award in the &quot;shōjo&quot; category.

The series was adapted into an anime television series in 1996. As of November 2021, the manga had over 17.7 million copies in circulation.

==Plot==
Takuya Enoki loses his mother, Yukako, when she dies in a car accident. Takuya now lives with his father, Harumi, and his baby brother, Minoru. Takuya&#x27;s baby brother is only two years old and requires much care. Although Takuya is only a fifth grader, he cooks, cleans, sews, scolds, and does everything that is normally a mother&#x27;s job. Between his housework and looking after his baby brother, Takuya begins to feel a helpless gap between his friends who have fun every day after school. The Kimura family blame him for Minoru&#x27;s constant crying. His stress gradually builds up and bursts at a point. Because of a mistake Minoru made, Takuya reacts violently. He cannot help feeling upset over Minoru, who is stressing him and taking up all his time.

One day, when Takuya picks Minoru up from preschool, he starts to walk faster imagining what it would be like to leave his little brother behind him. But soon, Takuya realizes what he has done and runs back. He finds Minoru with his eyes full of tears and a brutal dog is blocking Minoru&#x27;s way. Takuya dashes in full speed and saves his little brother. After coming home and seeing Minoru sobbing, Takuya realizes that Minoru cries because he is just lonely and becomes ashamed of himself. From then on, Takuya learns to love his little brother as family and his long life story of being a mother and a brother at once begins.

==Characters==
===Enoki family===
:
:The elder brother. 12 years old. Has taken up the burden of mothering his younger brother, Minoru. Due to his gentle, calm demeanor, good looks, and good grades, he is popular with the girls at school. Most likely to be mad when someone hurts or scares Minoru.
:He is kind, caring, hard working, responsible and sensitive though oblivious of the girls&#x27; feelings towards him.
:He is also good at short distance runs. However, he&#x27;s really bad at long running and handicrafts.
:On Valentine&#x27;s day, he receives 9 boxes of chocolate. In the long run, he comes up at 3rd place thanks to his extreme effort.
:
:Baby of the family. Super cute. Loved and overprotected by his older brother, Takuya. Loves to wear a bear hat. His favorite character is Zap, a superhero from a laundry detergent commercial. His hero in life is Takuya.
:He is in the same class as Hiro. Both Hiro and Ichika love him.

He is good looking and intelligent. He is also good at sports and is popular at school.

In Valentine&#x27;s Day, he receives 7 box of chocolate. He wins the 1st prize for the long run competition.
:Younger sister of Akihiro&#x27;s. Different class from Minoru. She has a crush on Minoru and often fights (verbal and physically) with love rival, Hiro. She is highly intelligent and sees Minoru as cute. Sharp tongued.
:Youngest son, sixth child, and youngest child in the Fujii family. Though younger than Minoru, his vocabulary is better than Minoru&#x27;s. Also very intelligent.
:Because of his gentle personality, he is often controlled by Ichika.

===Neighbors===
;The Kimuras:Lives across the street from the Enoki&#x27;s. Though both are old, they are very spirited. Their son recently came home.
Seiichi Kimura : the only son. He had a bad reputation, so he ran away from home to another city, and when he came back it turned out that he had married and had a son.

Tomoko Kimura : Seiichi&#x27;s wife.

Taichi Kimura : son of Seiichi.

===Others===
:A girl in Takuya&#x27;s class. She has a quick temper. Her reputation as a liar makes it hard for her to have friends. She often speaks too honestly, and words come out of her mouth before she thinks it through, leading her to hurt other&#x27;s feelings without meaning to.
:Gon&#x27;s crush. She is the class representative of Class 6-3. Takuya thinks she is weird. Gon probably likes her because she is pretty. She likes to dress very extravagantly (weird by Takuya&#x27;s taste). On her date with Gon, she chose to go to the kiddie rides. She sexually harasses Takuya and Gon by patting their behinds. When Takuya asked her to go on a date with Gon (from Gon&#x27;s orders) she told him that she liked someone else. After her date with Gon, she confesses to him that she liked Takuya. She commented to Takuya that she knew he would not tell Gon because he wants to protect his friends.

<doc id="495065" wikidata="Q711250" url="?curid=495065" title="Louis Essen">
<text>Louis Essen OBE FRS(6 September 1908 – 24 August 1997) was an English physicist whose most notable achievements were in the precise measurement of time and the determination of the speed of light. He was a critic of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, particularly as it related to time dilation.
==Early work==
Born in Nottingham, Essen earned his degree in physics from the University of London in 1928, having studied at University College Nottingham. He started work at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) the following year, under D. W. Dye, investigating the potential of tuning forks and quartz crystal oscillators for precise time measurement. His research led to his development of the quartz ring clock in 1938, the clock soon becoming a standard for time measurement at observatories throughout the world.

==The speed of light==

During World War II, Essen worked on radar and developed a number of instruments, including the cavity resonance wavemeter. It was this work that suggested to Essen the possibility of a more precise measurement of the speed of light. In 1946, in collaboration with A.C. Gordon-Smith, he used a microwave cavity, of precisely known dimensions, and exploited his expertise in time-measurement to establish the frequency for a variety of its normal modes. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light. Their result, 299,792±3 km/s, was substantially greater than that from the prevailing sequence of optical measurements that had begun around the start of the 20th century and Essen had to withstand some fierce criticism and disbelief. Even NPL director Sir Charles Galton Darwin, while supporting the work, observed that Essen would get the &quot;correct result&quot; once he had perfected the technique. Moreover, W.W. Hansen at Stanford University had used a similar technique and obtained a measurement which was more consistent with the conventional (optical) wisdom. However, a combination of Essen&#x27;s stubbornness, his iconoclasm and his belief in his own skill at measurement (and a little help with calculations from Alan Turing) inspired him to refine his apparatus and to repeat his measurement in 1950, establishing a result of 299,792.5±1 km/s. This was the value adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. Most subsequent measurements have been consistent with this value. In 1983, the 17th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures adopted the standard value, 299,792.458 km/s for the speed of light.

==Atomic clocks==
Essen earned his PhD (1941) and Doctor of Science (1948) from the University of London before becoming interested in the possibility of using the frequency of atomic spectra to improve time measurement. The feasibility of measuring time using caesium as an atomic reference had been demonstrated by the US National Bureau of Standards. In 1955, he developed, in collaboration with Jack Parry, the first practical atomic clock by integrating the caesium atomic standard with conventional quartz crystal oscillators to allow calibration of existing time-keeping.

==Time standards==

This work led Essen to champion the caesium spectrum as an international time standard. The ammonia molecule had already been proposed as such but Essen was convinced that caesium would prove more stable. However, the International Astronomical Union meeting in Rome in 1952 had adopted the ephemeris time scale, on a proposal by Gerald Clemence defining the time unit in terms of the Earth&#x27;s motion round the sun. The ephemeris second, based on a fraction of the tropical year derived from Simon Newcomb&#x27;s expression for the mean solar motion, became a standard in 1960, but in 1967, at the 13th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures, the second was redefined in terms of a value for the ephemeris second that had been precisely measured by Essen in collaboration with William Markowitz of the United States Naval Observatory in terms of the frequency of a chosen line from the spectrum of caesium.

==Later life==

Essen spent all his working life at the National Physical Laboratory.

In 1971 he published &quot;The Special Theory of Relativity: A Critical Analysis&quot;, questioning Special relativity, which apparently was not appreciated by his employers.
Essen said in 1978:

He retired in 1972 and died in Great Bookham, Surrey in 1997.

<doc id="495066" wikidata="Q444301" url="?curid=495066" title="Leslie Van Houten">
<text>Leslie Louise Van Houten (born August 23, 1949) is an American convicted murderer and former member of the Manson Family. During her time with Manson&#x27;s group, she was known by aliases such as Louella Alexandria, Leslie Marie Sankston, Linda Sue Owens and Lulu.

Van Houten was arrested and charged in relation to the 1969 murders of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. Van Houten was convicted and sentenced to death, but a 1972 California Supreme Court ruling found the death penalty unconstitutional, resulting in her sentence being commuted to life in prison. Her conviction was overturned in a 1976 appellate court decision which granted her a retrial. Her second trial ended with a deadlocked jury and a mistrial. At her third trial in 1978, she was convicted of two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy and sentenced to seven years to life in prison. After spending 53 years in prison that included two dozen parole hearings and parole rejections by two California governors, Van Houten was paroled in 2023. 

==Early life==
Van Houten was born on August 23, 1949, in the Los Angeles suburb of Altadena to Paul Van Houten and Jane (née Edwards). Her father is of Dutch descent, and her mother is of Irish, English, Scottish, and German descent. She grew up in a middle-class churchgoing family along with an older brother and two adopted siblings, a brother and a sister, who were Korean. Her mother and father divorced when she was 14. She began smoking marijuana, and around the age of 15, began taking LSD. At 17, she ran away with her boyfriend, but returned to complete high school, graduating from Monrovia High School (in Monrovia, California) in 1967.
According to Van Houten, she discovered that she was pregnant and was ordered by her mother to undergo an abortion and bury the fetus in their backyard. Van Houten stated that after that event, she felt very removed from her mother and harbored intense anger toward her. She had a period of interest in yoga and took a year-long secretarial course, but became a hippie, living at a commune.

== Manson Family ==

After a few months in a commune in Northern California, Van Houten met Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil and moved in with them and another woman during the summer of 1968. The four broke up after jealous arguments, and Share left to join Charles Manson&#x27;s commune. Van Houten, then aged 19, followed Share. At that time, she phoned her mother to say she was dropping out and would not be making contact again.

Manson decided when they would eat, sleep, and have sex, and with whom they would have sex. He also controlled the taking of LSD, giving followers larger doses than he himself took. According to Manson, &quot;When you take LSD enough times, you reach a state of nothing. Of no thought.&quot; According to Van Houten, she became &quot;saturated in acid&quot; and could not grasp the existence of those living a non-psychedelic reality.

From August 1968, Manson and his followers were based at the Spahn Ranch. Manson ostensibly ran his Family based on hippie-style principles of acceptance and free love. At the remote ranch, where they were isolated from any other influences, Manson&#x27;s was the only opinion heard. At every meal he would lecture repetitively. Van Houten said Manson&#x27;s attitude was that she &quot;belonged to Bobby&quot;. According to Van Houten she and other Manson followers looked to 14-year-old Family member Dianne Lake as the &quot;empty vessel&quot;, the epitome of what women were supposed to be in the Manson system of values. When Barbara Hoyt spoke at Van Houten&#x27;s parole hearing in 2013, she said that Van Houten was considered a &quot;leader&quot; in the Family.

== Murders ==
===Murders of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca===

On August 9, 1969, Van Houten, Tex Watson, Patricia Krenwinkel, Linda Kasabian, Susan Atkins, Clem Grogan and Manson went to the house of Rosemary and Leno LaBianca. Manson entered the house with Watson, then left with Kasabian, Atkins, and Grogan.

Van Houten and another woman held down Rosemary LaBianca as Watson stabbed Leno LaBianca. After stabbing Rosemary, Watson gave Van Houten a knife, and she stabbed the woman at least 14 more times. She testified in 1971, “And I took one of the knives, and Patricia [Krenwinkel] had one – a knife – and we started stabbing and cutting up the lady.”

=== Motive ===

Manson, who denied responsibility, never explained a motive for the murders. Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi suggested Manson was attempting to start a racial civil war. This motive was later noted by California Supreme Court Justice Manuel Ramirez, in his 2004 decision to deny review of a Court of Appeal ruling upholding Van Houten&#x27;s denial of parole.

==Trial==
Manson was accused of orchestrating both attacks, but the only defendants at the trial whose murder charges were for actually inflicting injuries on the LaBiancas were Van Houten and Krenwinkel. Unlike the others, Van Houten was not accused of the murders of Tate and her friends.

Manson opposed his three female co-defendants running a defense that he had asked them to commit killings. Van Houten did not appear to take the court seriously (later claiming to have been supplied with LSD during the trial) and giggled during testimony about the victims. She testified to committing the murders she was charged with and denied that Manson had been involved. An often-cited example of how he seemed to exert control over Van Houten and the others was when Manson carved an X on his forehead and she and the other two women defendants copied him. In the latter stages of the trial they stopped mimicking him, Bugliosi suggested, because they realized it was making the extent of his influence over them apparent.

Van Houten dismissed three defense lawyers in succession for claiming her actions were attributable to Manson&#x27;s control over her. When Ronald Hughes, her attorney, was asking an expert witness about the effect of LSD on judgment, Van Houten shouted that, &quot;This is all such a big lie. I was influenced by the war in Vietnam and TV.&quot;

On March 29, 1971, she was convicted of murder along with the other defendants. During the sentencing phase of the trial, in an apparent attempt to exonerate Manson, Van Houten testified that she had committed a killing in which she was not, in fact, involved. She told a psychiatrist of beating her adopted sister, leading him to characterize her as &quot;a spoiled little princess&quot; and a &quot;psychologically loaded gun&quot;, and was adamant that Manson had no influence over her thought processes or behavior. Van Houten also told the psychiatrist that she would have gone to jail for manslaughter or assault with a deadly weapon without ever meeting Manson. When her lawyer, attempting to show she felt remorse, asked if she felt sorrow or shame for the death of Rosemary LaBianca, Van Houten replied &quot;sorry is only a five-letter word&quot; and &quot;you can&#x27;t undo something that is done.&quot; In cross-examination, Van Houten aggressively implicated herself in inflicting wounds while the victim was living, and severely wounding the victim, severing her spine, which might have been fatal by itself. She vehemently denied acting on instructions from Manson, and said a court-appointed attorney who &quot;had a lot of different ideas on how to get me off&quot; had told her to claim Manson ordered the killings.

Van Houten was sentenced to be executed; she was the youngest woman ever condemned to death in California. No death row for female prisoners existed, and a special unit was built. The death sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison after the California Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;People v. Anderson&quot; decision resulted in the invalidation of all death sentences imposed in California prior to 1972. With a first degree murder conviction she was eligible for parole once she had served seven years. In order to be released after seven years, she would have had to have been granted parole at her first parole hearing. (The governor would not have been able to rescind that parole, since California governors did not gain that power until Proposition 89 was passed by the voters on November 8, 1988.) In his bestselling book &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi said that &quot;his guess&quot; was that all three women would be released after 15–20 years.

===Re-trial===

Van Houten was granted a retrial in 1977 due to the failure to declare a mistrial when Ronald Hughes, her lawyer, died. Her defense argued that Van Houten&#x27;s capacity for rational thought had been diminished due to LSD use and Manson&#x27;s influence. The jury could not agree on a verdict. According to what the jury foreman later told reporters, they thought it was difficult on the basis of the evidence to determine whether Van Houten&#x27;s judgment had been unimpaired enough for a verdict of first degree murder rather than manslaughter.

It was reported in the news media that because of time already served, Van Houten could go free that year if she was convicted of manslaughter. By law, prosecutors are not allowed to mention the possibility of the defendant being released on parole when arguing for a murder rather than manslaughter conviction because it is considered highly prejudicial to the defendant.

===Second re-trial===
The prosecution in 1970–71 had emphasized that the motive had nothing to do with robbery and the killers ignored valuable pieces of property. At Van Houten&#x27;s second re-trial in 1978, the prosecution, who were now being aided by a specialist in diminished responsibility, altered the charges by using the theft of food, clothing and a small sum of money taken from the house to add a charge of robbery, whereby the felony murder rule tended to undermine a defense of reduced capacity. She was on bond for six months before being found guilty of first-degree murder. Van Houten was given a life sentence that entailed eligibility for parole, for which the prosecutor said she would one day be suitable.

==Post-trial events==
After the first trial, Van Houten and her female co-conspirators Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel were housed in a special housing unit built at the California Institution for Women. They were initially kept separate from the prison population, because they were viewed as a threat to the other inmates.

In the early 1970s, Van Houten, Atkins and Krenwinkel worked with a social worker, Karlene Faith, who sought to help them re-establish their identities separate from the Manson Family. Faith later wrote a book about her work with the women, &quot;The Long Prison Journey of Leslie Van Houten&quot;. In the book, Faith tells how two of the women believed that they would &quot;grow wings and become fairies&quot; after the expected race war had occurred. The women told Faith that they obtained that belief from Manson. Faith viewed all three of the Manson women as victims, and lobbied for their early release from prison. Faith&#x27;s work with the Manson women was later portrayed in the feature film, &quot;Charlie Says&quot;.

Van Houten was also befriended by film director John Waters. He also campaigned for her early release from prison.

In 1975, the Manson women were moved to the general population at the California Institution for Women.

==Parole requests==
Under California law, some life sentences are eligible for parole, and a parole board rejection of an application does not preclude a different decision in the future. Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel (who were originally convicted along with Van Houten and Manson at the main trial) had both been found guilty of the most notorious crime, the murder of five people at 10050 Cielo Drive. In addition, Krenwinkel was also convicted of the murders of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, while Atkins was also convicted of murdering Gary Hinman.

Only one other member of the Manson Family has been convicted of murder and later released: Steve &quot;Clem&quot; Grogan. Grogan, convicted and given a death sentence by the jury for the torture-murder of Donald Shea with Manson, was freed in 1985. Bruce M. Davis, also an accomplice of Manson in the killing of Shea, and with a second conviction for the Gary Hinman killing, was given a parole board recommendation for release in 2010 although very few inmates with even a single conviction on a charge of murder had been able to obtain parole in California before 2011. In each case, the sitting governor ordered a review or reversed the decision. Tex Watson was denied parole for the 15th time on October 27, 2016.

After receiving her 13th rejection, in which the hearing concluded she posed &quot;an unreasonable risk of danger to society&quot;, Van Houten took legal action. Judge Bob Krug ordered the board to re-hear the application because their reasoning turned solely on the unalterable gravity of her offense and effectively gave her life without parole, &quot;a sentence unauthorized by law&quot;. The judgment was overturned by a higher court, which said although parole hearings must consider evidence for an inmate being rehabilitated, a hearing had discretion to deny parole based solely on a review of the circumstances of the crime, if &quot;some evidence&quot; supported their decision.

In 2013, Van Houten was denied parole for the 20th time at a hearing. In announcing a decision to deny parole, the commissioner of the hearing board said that she had failed to explain how someone of her good background and intelligence could have committed such &quot;cruel and atrocious&quot; murders.

On April 14, 2016, a two-person panel of the California Parole Board recommended granting Van Houten&#x27;s parole request, but California Governor Jerry Brown vetoed the release on the grounds that: &quot;Both her role in these extraordinarily brutal crimes and her inability to explain her willing participation in such horrific violence cannot be overlooked and lead me to believe she remains an unacceptable risk to society if released.&quot;

On September 29, 2016, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge William C. Ryan issued an 18-page ruling upholding the governor&#x27;s reversal earlier in the year of a parole board&#x27;s decision to release Van Houten. Ryan wrote that there was &quot;some evidence&quot; that Van Houten presents an unreasonable threat to society. On December 21, the California Supreme Court denied Van Houten&#x27;s petition to hear the case.

Van Houten has long since renounced Manson, who died in prison in November 2017. She has expressed remorse for her crimes, and at her 2013 parole hearing, her attorney argued that her value system was completely different from what it was in 1972. She expressed that she &quot;takes offense to the fact that Manson doesn&#x27;t own up&quot; to his role in the murders. She told Vincent Bugliosi, the man who sent her to prison, &quot;I take responsibility for my part, and part of my responsibility was helping to create him.&quot; She has written several short stories, once edited the prison newspaper and did some secretarial work at the prison.

Van Houten was again recommended for parole at her 21st parole hearing on September 6, 2017. The two-member panel found that Van Houten had radically changed her life in the more than 40 years she had been incarcerated. Governor Jerry Brown again denied her parole on January 19, 2018. Her legal team stated they would fight the decision. On June 29, 2018, Van Houten&#x27;s parole was once again vetoed. The judge was again William C. Ryan, who said: &quot;Unless the inmate can demonstrate that there is no evidence to support the governor&#x27;s conclusion that the inmate is a current danger to public safety, the petition fails to state a case for relief and may be summarily denied.&quot;

On January 30, 2019, during her 22nd parole hearing, Van Houten was recommended for parole for the third time. But on June 4, 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom overruled the parole board&#x27;s recommendation, claiming the then 69-year-old Van Houten was still a &quot;danger to society&quot; and that she had &quot;potential for future violence&quot;. She appealed the governor&#x27;s decision, but on September 21, 2019, the appeals court panel ruled 2–1 in the governor&#x27;s favor.

Van Houten was recommended for parole for the fourth time at a 23rd parole hearing on July 23, 2020, and a 120-day legal review period began. On November 28, Governor Newsom again rejected the board&#x27;s recommendation and vetoed Van Houten&#x27;s parole. Among his reasons for denial, Newsom stated the then 71-year-old Van Houten &quot;currently poses an unreasonable danger to society if released from prison&quot;.
Again, her lawyer, Rich Pfeiffer, said they would appeal the governor&#x27;s latest decision, but her request for review was rejected by the California Supreme Court on February 9, 2022.

On November 9, 2021, Van Houten was again recommended for parole by a parole board. On March 29, 2022, Governor Newsom again overruled the parole board&#x27;s recommendation.

On May 30, 2023, a California Court of Appeal in Los Angeles set aside Governor Newsom&#x27;s denial of Van Houten&#x27;s parole, thus making her the first Manson family member to have a court rule in her favor for a parole recommendation. On July 7, 2023, Governor Newsom announced that he would not file an appeal with the California Supreme Court to block her parole, paving the way for her release. Van Houten was released on parole on July 11, 2023, after serving over 52 years in prison. According to her attorney, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Van Houten was transferred to a &quot;transitional living facility&quot; while subject to parole supervision. Her parole would last up to a maximum of three years, with her first discharge review scheduled after the first year. Sharon Tate&#x27;s sister, Debra Tate, reacted to Van Houten&#x27;s release by stating during an interview on the ABC News program &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;Is she a nice girl? No. Is she an animal? I think she was then, and I fear that she still is.&quot; Krenwinkel and Watson remained imprisoned, with Krenwinkel having had a June 19, 2024 parole suitability hearing waived for one year. As of July 2023, Watson&#x27;s next parole hearing was scheduled for October 2026.

==In the media==
Van Houten&#x27;s parole hearings have appeared on Court TV and attracted nationwide media attention. They have featured comments from former prosecutors, relatives of her victims, and relatives of the victims of other killers. John Waters advocated for Van Houten&#x27;s parole.

Van Houten told her story on the podcast &quot;Ear Hustle&quot; in the 2021 episode &#x27;Home for Me Really is a Memory.&#x27; 

===Dramatic portrayals===
Van Houten was first portrayed by actress Cathey Paine in the 1976 made-for-TV film &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;. San Francisco-based actress Connie Champagne portrayed Van Houten in Dude Theater&#x27;s long-running 1989 stage play &quot;The Charlie Manson Story&quot;, first at Climate Theater and then Theatre Artaud, a black comedy directed by Christopher Brophy. The production was the first to de-glamorourize the Manson-myth and to question Manson&#x27;s belief in the so-called &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;.
The 2009 film &quot;Leslie, My Name Is Evil&quot; (released in some countries under the titles &quot;Manson Girl&quot; and &quot;Manson, My Name Is Evil&quot;) is partially based on Van Houten&#x27;s early life and stars actress Kristen Hager as Van Houten. In &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; (2004 remake of the 1976 film) Van Houten was portrayed by actress Catherine Wadkins. A year earlier, in 2003, Amy Yates portrayed Leslie Van Houten in the film &quot;The Manson Family&quot;. In the 2015 NBC fictional series &quot;Aquarius&quot;, which centers on the Los Angeles Police Department and the Manson murders, Emma Dumont portrays a character named &quot;Emma&quot;, who is loosely based on Van Houten. Tania Raymonde portrayed Van Houten in Susanna Lo&#x27;s 2016 film &quot;Manson Girls&quot;. Later in 2016, Greer Grammer portrayed Van Houten in Leslie Libman&#x27;s film &quot;Manson&#x27;s Lost Girls&quot;, which starred MacKenzie Mauzy as Kasabian. In 2018 she was portrayed by Gabrielle Klobucar in the made-for-TV documentary &quot;Inside the Manson Cult: The Lost Tapes.&quot; Also in 2018, English actress Hannah Murray played Van Houten in the feature movie &quot;Charlie Says&quot;. In 2019, Van Houten was played by Victoria Pedretti in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;.

<doc id="495069" wikidata="Q3348756" url="?curid=495069" title="Powai Lake">
<text>Powai Lake (Pronunciation: ) is an artificial lake, situated in Mumbai, in the Powai valley, where a Powai village with a cluster of huts existed. The city suburb called Powai shares its name with the lake.
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, one of the premier institutions of science and technology in India, is located to the east of the lake. Another famous institution, the National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE), is also located close to the lake. Housing complexes and plush hotels are developed all around the lake periphery. Population around the lake has thus substantially increased over the years.

When it was built, the lake had an area of about and the depth varied from about (at the periphery) to at its deepest.

The Powai Lake has gone through many stages of water quality degradation. The lake water which used to supply drinking water for Mumbai has been declared unfit to drink. The lake remains a tourist attraction.

==History==
Before the lake was built by the British, in 1799 AD, the estate where the lake is now was leased on a yearly rent to Dr. Scott. After his death in 1816, the government took control of the estate in 1826 and leased it to Framaji Kavasji, then the vice-president of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of Western India after whom the lake was named when it was built in 1891.

A stream tributary of the Mithi river, which served the Powai village&#x27;s water needs, was dammed in 1891, during the British period. It was initially to augment water supply to Bombay city (now called Mumbai), by constructing two dams of 10 m to store the rain water flowing from the lower slopes of the Western Ghats and streams from the eastern and northeastern slopes of hills. It was planned as an antiwater famine measure, to the southeast of Vihar Lake (a much larger lake) also for water supply to Mumbai city. The scheme was taken in hand in 1889. Though it was completed within a year at an initial cost of more than Rs. 6,50,000 and started providing two million gallons of water per day, it had to be abandoned due to the hue and cry against the quality of the water. Five lakhs of rupees more were spent on the scheme in 1919 in an attempt to restore the supply at least for the suburbs but this, too, was given up with the development of the Tansa works.

After the drinking water supply objective was abandoned in the early 1890s, in view of poor quality of the water due to pollution, water hyacinth and weeds, untreated sewage and large silt deposit, the lake was leased to the Western India Fishing Association, a quasi government organisation, who used it for fish culture and angling. Later, the Bombay Presidency Angling Association was formed in 1936. In 1955, under the Societies Registration Act 1860, it was registered as the Maharashtra State Angling Association (MSAA) and the lake is now under their control. Realising the gravity of the environmental pollution, the MSAA has revised its constitution &quot;to actively care for, clean, develop, maintain, and beautify the Environment at Powai Lake.&quot;

MSAA is now involved with
* removal of water hyacinth infestation
* supporting research with Fisheries Department for conservation of the Indian mahaseer
* water quality analysis
* augmenting security.

==Access==
The lake is about from Mumbai&#x27;s downtown by road and is approached via Kurla or through Santa Cruz and Andheri. Kanjurmarg on the Central Line (Mumbai Suburban Railway) of the Mumbai Suburban Railway is the nearest railway station to the lake. The airport is also nearby.

==Hydrology and water quality==

It is reported that the average rainfall at Powai is about , and the lake overflows for about sixty days each year. The overflow from the lake flows into the Mithi River. Silt studies conducted in 1995 estimates in that 4500 lakh cubic metres of silt has been deposited in the lake since its construction. It supplied two million gallons of water to Bombay (now Mumbai) when it was built. Following the construction of the Tansa dam and creation of the reservoir, in 1892, Powai waters were used for irrigation. The lake drains a catchment of 6.61 km2 (part of the Powai-Kanheri hill ranges which also drain into the adjoining Vihar Lake and Tulsi Lake). The dam, built in stone masonry has a height varying from 3 m to 6m with top level of the dam kept at E.L. 58.5 m (with Town hall datum). Government of Maharashtra reports that due to eutrophication of the lake water from untreated sewage and garbage from nearby residential and slum colonies, the lake water is unfit for drinking water use. Hence, the lake is now used for recreation, gardening, cattle washing and fishing. The water of the lake is also supplied to Aarey colony and Larsen &amp; Toubro for non domestic uses. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) level at the bottom of the lake is reported to be 0.71 mg/litre and at surface 4.11 mg/litre, average value of pH is 7.2 and COD is 42.70 mg/litre on the surface and 119 mg/litre at the bottom of the lake.

==Lake rejuvenation==
Appreciating the problem of silting, growth of water hyacinth, weed, and eutrophication of the lake, the IIT Bombay&#x27;s Class of 1980 launched a &quot;Revitalization of Powai Lake&quot; with the objective of restoring the lake to its original pristine and sustainable form by adopting Eco-friendly designs and materials for the restoration works.

Some of the tasks proposed to be undertaken with the funds donated by IIT, Bombay included:

*Removing water hyacinth and weeds from the lake in parts nearest to the campus
*Starting a publicity and an awareness program in the area
*Building embankments, walkways and pathways to the lake
*Constructing a large gazebo for an evening (or morning or afternoon) by the lake
*Planting trees, and creating a garden
*Installing docks, deploying boats and canoes
*Allocating funds for annual maintenance

The project was proposed to be professionally managed with a project manager working under directives of IIT Bombay with an &quot;Oversight Committee&quot; to monitor objectives set for the restoration work.

In 1995, the National Lake Conservation Plan (NLCP) of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoE&amp;F), Government of India, reviewed the condition of Powai Lake and included the Lake in its list of ten major lakes in the country for revival and improvements. The restoration/revival programme, fully funded by the NLCP, was launched in April 2002, and implemented by Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC) now called Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the Government of Maharashtra and as a result the status of the lake has undergone a major shift from the hypertrophic condition to mesotrophic condition by adopting a novel technique of aeration and bioremediation. This has resulted in the lake being used for fishing and recreational purposes.

==Desilting project==
The Lake&#x27;s water depth is reported to have reduced to as little as at some locations, on account of the large inflow of sewage, domestic waste water and silt from surrounding residential and industrial areas.

Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has therefore plans to desilt the Powai Lake at a cost of US$9 million.

==Fauna==
Many crocodiles have been seen on the lake side.
White-throated kingfisher, small blue kingfisher, Indian spot-billed duck, spotted dove, a few purple swamphens, purple-rumped sunbirds, bronze-winged and pheasant-tailed jacanas, ashy prinias, brahminy kite, red-vented, red-whiskered and white-browed bulbuls, cormorants, lesser whistling ducks, grey, purple and Indian pond herons, little, intermediate egret and great egrets, peregrine falcon, greater coucal, rose-ringed and Alexandrine parakeets, Eurasian marsh harrier (possibly winter visitor), woolly-necked stork (winter visitor) hoopoe and whiskered terns.
butterflies, honey bees, bumble bees and beetles have also been sighted.

==Flora==
Balsam bushes, in their full bloom, in pink-purple color are seen around the lake periphery, like a carpet.

<doc id="495073" wikidata="Q929531" url="?curid=495073" title="Sapporo Snow Festival">
<text>The is a festival held annually in Sapporo, Japan, over seven days in February. Odori Park, Susukino, and Tsudome are the main sites of the festival.

In 2007 (57th festival), about two million people visited Sapporo to see the hundreds of snow statues and ice sculptures at the Odori Park and Susukino sites, in central Sapporo, and at the Satoland site. An International Snow Sculpture Contest has been held at the Odori Park site since 1974, and 14 teams from various regions of the world participated in 2008.

The subject of the statues varies and often features an event, famous building or person from the previous year. For example, in 2004, there were statues of Hideki Matsui, the famous baseball player who at that time played for the New York Yankees. A number of stages made out of snow are also constructed and some events including musical performances are held. At the Satoland site, visitors can enjoy the long snow and ice slides as well as a huge maze made of snow. Visitors can also enjoy a variety of regional foods from all over Hokkaidō at the Odori Park and Satoland sites, such as fresh seafood, potatoes, corn, and fresh dairy products.

Every year the number of statues displayed is around 400 in total. In 2007, there were 307 statues created at the Odori Park site, 32 at the Satoland site and 100 at the Susukino site. A good view of the creations can be had from the TV Tower at the Odori Park site.

==History==
The Snow Festival began as a one-day event in 1950, when six local high school students built six snow statues in Odori Park. In 1955 the Japan Self-Defense Forces from the nearby Makomanai base joined in and built the first massive snow sculptures, for which the Snow Festival has now become famous. Several snow festivals existed in Sapporo prior to the Sapporo Snow Festival, however, all of these were suspended during World War II.

On 4 February 1966, a flight from Sapporo to Tokyo crashed into Tokyo Bay killing all 126 passengers and 7 crew on board. Many of the passengers were returning to Tokyo after visiting the snow festival. 

Owing to the Energy crisis of 1974, snow statues were built using drums. This was due to the shortage of gasoline caused by the crisis and unavailability of trucks used to transport snow to the site. In the same year, the International Snow Statue Competition started and since that year many snow statues built by teams from other countries have featured; especially from sister cities of Sapporo such as Munich.

In years when the accumulated snowfall is low, the Self-Defense Force, for whom participation is considered a training exercise, brings in snow from outside Sapporo. The Makomanai base, one of three main sites from 1965, hosted the largest sculptures, with an emphasis on providing play space for children. Use of the Makomanai site was suspended in 2005 and moved to the Sapporo Satoland site located in Higashi-ku from 2006. In 2009, the Satoland site was moved to the site. The Tsudome, located close to the Sapporo Satoland, is a dome for multiple sports events.

Nakajima Park was established as one of the festival sites in 1990. However, it was removed as a site in 1992. The third site, known as the , is situated in the night-life district of Susukino and includes predominantly ice carvings. The site was approved as one of the festival sites in 1983. Every year, the Susukino Queen of Ice, a female beauty contest, is held at the site.

On 7 February 2012 (63rd Festival), a snow sculpture of Snow Miku (Hatsune Miku) collapsed on the Odori Park 6th Venue, where a female tourist was injured. This accident was the first injury in the history of the Snow Festival from the collapse of a snow sculpture. The collapse was likely due to imbalance caused by disproportionately thin supporting legs to the main mass of the sculpture. Additionally, the temperature on February 6 was 3.3 degrees Celsius, and the temperature on 7th was 2.2 degrees Celsius, likely causing it to become brittle and more prone to collapse. In response to this, the executive committee demolished all or part of the heavy snow sculptures and ten civilian snow sculptures as there was a risk of collapse.

<text>William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham (c. 151012 January 1573) was an English diplomat and military leader. He served four monarchs, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I, in various official capacities, most notably on diplomatic missions and as Lord Admiral and Lord Chamberlain of the Household.

==Early life==
William Howard was born about 1510, the ninth son of Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, later 2nd Duke of Norfolk. He was the eldest son of Surrey by his second wife, Agnes Tilney.

Howard was brought to court at a young age after completing his education at Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

== Embassies ==
In 1531, Howard was sent on an embassy to Scotland by King Henry VIII, and accompanied the King to Boulogne in October 1532. In May 1533, as deputy to his half-brother, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, he served as Earl Marshal at the coronation of his niece, Anne Boleyn, the daughter of his half-sister, Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire. On 10 September 1533, Howard bore the canopy over his great-niece Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth I). In 1534, he went to Scotland. His instructions included getting the measurements of James V of Scotland from the Bishop of Aberdeen, Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. Then Howard&#x27;s tailor would make Henry VIII&#x27;s nephew a new suit of clothes as a present. Howard would then broach the subject of the two kings meeting in person. 

In February 1535, he was sent again to Scotland to invest James V with the Order of the Garter and brought a present of &quot;great horses&quot;. Howard met James V at Stirling Castle on Good Friday. They discussed a possible meeting of the two Kings at Newcastle at Michaelmas. Margaret Tudor praised his abilities and wrote that her son James V, &quot;lykkis hym right weill.&quot;

In June 1535, he was in France as a member of the English embassy authorized to negotiate with the French Admiral, Philippe de Chabot. In February 1536 he was again in Scotland, this time for the purpose of persuading James V to adopt Henry VIII&#x27;s religious policy. He returned to Scotland again in April when he heard rumours from Margaret Tudor and others that James V intended to marry his mistress, Margaret Erskine, Lady Lochleven. He was again in France in 1537. On 11 December 1539, he was among those who welcomed King Henry VIII&#x27;s fourth bride, Anne of Cleves at Calais.

While on an embassy to France in 1541, William Howard was charged with concealing the sexual indiscretions of his young niece, Katherine Howard, Henry VIII&#x27;s fifth wife, and was recalled to England to stand trial. On 22 December 1541, Howard, his wife, and a number of servants who had been alleged witnesses to the Queen&#x27;s misconduct were arraigned for misprision of treason, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment and loss of goods. He and most of the others were pardoned after Queen Katherine&#x27;s execution on 13 February 1542.

== Military career ==
In 1544, Howard accompanied the Earl of Hertford&#x27;s forces in the invasion of Scotland. It was reported that he was hurt in the cheek by an English arrow during fighting on Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Mile. In July of that year he took part in the siege of Boulogne. On 27 May 1545, the King&#x27;s Council ordered Howard to &quot;repayre to serve uppon the sees&quot;. Later orders show that he detained several foreign vessels while patrolling the English Channel. In May 1546, he was entrusted with the sum of £12,000 to pay the English army at Calais. In connection with these duties, he was referred to as &quot;vice-admiral&quot; to the then Lord Admiral, Viscount Lisle. When Lisle&#x27;s attendance was required in May 1546 at negotiations which resulted in the signing of the Treaty of Ardres on 7 June 1546, he turned command of the English fleet over to Howard.

Howard&#x27;s career received a check in 1547 with the downfall of his half-nephew Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. However, the setback was temporary. He was an ally of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, then Earl of Warwick, in his coup against the Protector Somerset in October 1549, and on 19 March 1551, received the manor of Effingham, Surrey, and other properties by way of reward. On 29 October 1552, Northumberland secured Howard&#x27;s appointment as Lord Deputy and Governor of Calais, and in the same month he was sworn of the Privy Council. When the young King Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, Howard held Calais for Queen Mary I against the supporters of her rival, Lady Jane Grey.

On 2 January 1554, he was appointed to meet the Spanish ambassadors who had come to London to negotiate a marriage between Queen Mary I and King Philip II of Spain. Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion broke out on 25 January, and Howard was among those who raised the militia to defend London. On 7 February 1554, he held Ludgate, preventing the rebels from entering the city and leading to their surrender a few hours later. He was appointed to Queen Mary&#x27;s Privy Council on 3 January 1554, and on 11 March, was created Baron Howard of Effingham. On 20 March 1554, he was granted a patent as Lord Admiral, replacing Lord Clinton. On 9 October of that year, he was made a Knight of the Garter. Around this date, there was a masque at court, featuring mariners&#x27; costumes made of gold and silver cloth, which Francis Yaxley thought was Howard&#x27;s production.

As Lord Admiral, Howard, with a fleet of 28 ships, met King Philip II on his arrival in England in 1555, and in August of that year escorted the King to Flanders. In 1557 Howard&#x27;s fleet transported a force under the command of the Earl of Pembroke to Calais. Lord Howard&#x27;s support for the accession of his great-niece, Elizabeth, exposed him to suspicion, although he was never considered disloyal by Queen Mary. In February 1558 Howard&#x27;s patent as Lord Admiral was revoked, and on 12 February 1558, the office was restored to Lord Clinton. Howard was compensated by a grant of the reversion of the office of Lord Chamberlain of the Household and an annuity of 200 marks, effective the previous September.

==Landholdings==
Howard inherited a number of manors and estates, some from the Howard family, some through his first wife Katherine, and others by gift of the Crown. These included lands at Broughton in Buckinghamshire; Billeshurst, Bletchingley, Kingswood, Little Bookham and Tillingdown in Surrey; Lowick in Northamptonshire; Shaw-cum-Donnington in Berkshire; and Tottenham in north London.

In 1566, Howard had some financial difficulties, and handed some of his Surrey estates to his great-nephew Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, retaining Little Bookham for his second wife, Margaret.

==Final years==
After Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s accession on 17 November 1558, Howard succeeded Edward Hastings as Lord Chamberlain and was appointed to the Privy Council. In early 1559 he was among those who negotiated the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis. In August 1564 he accompanied the Queen on a visit to Cambridge, where he was awarded the degree of Master of Arts; on 6 October 1566 he was awarded a similar degree by the University of Oxford. According to McDermott, he was a &quot;near constant attendee at privy council meetings during the 1560s&quot;, but by the latter part of 1572 he could no longer discharge his duties as Lord Chamberlain because of ill health, and the Queen appointed his nephew, the Earl of Sussex, to replace him, appointing Howard as Lord Privy Seal. Howard died at Hampton Court Palace on 12 January 1573, and was buried on 29 January at Reigate.

Whitgift School currently stands on the site of the former Howard estate in Croydon.

==Family==

William Howard married firstly, before 18 June 1531, Katherine (died 23 April 1535), the daughter of John Broughton (died 23 January 1518) of Toddington, Bedfordshire, by Anne Sapcote (died 14 March 1559), the daughter and heir of Sir Guy Sapcote by Margaret Wolston, daughter and heir of Sir Guy Wolston. They had one daughter, Agnes Howard, who married William Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester. Katherine (née Broughton) was buried in the parish church of St Mary at Lambeth, where there is a monument to her memory.
