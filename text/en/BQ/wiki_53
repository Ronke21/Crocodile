<text>Richard Francis Kneip (January 7, 1933March 9, 1987) was an American diplomat and politician who served as the 25th governor of South Dakota from 1971 until 1978 and the 6th United States Ambassador to the Republic of Singapore. He was a member of the Democratic Party and the first Catholic Governor of South Dakota.

==Early life and education==
Kneip was born on January 7, 1933, in Tyler, Minnesota, to Berniece and Frank Kneip, who lived in Elkton, South Dakota. He was of Luxembourgish ancestry. He attended South Dakota State University and St. John&#x27;s University. He served in the U.S. Air Force and then owned a wholesale dairy equipment distributorship in Salem, South Dakota. He married Nancy Lou Pankey.

==Early political career==
He served in the South Dakota Legislature as a State Senator from 1965 to 1971.

==Governor of South Dakota==
When Richard F. Kneip was elected governor of South Dakota in 1970, defeating the Republican incumbent Frank Farrar, he was only the fourth governor elected from the Democratic Party since statehood. Known to the state&#x27;s voters as &quot;Dick&quot;, Kneip gained popularity through his &quot;people to people&quot; campaigns. Kneip memorably did launch his 1970 campaign for governor with radio ads asking &quot;What is a Kneip?&quot;.

Taking office two days shy of his 38th birthday, Kneip is the youngest governor the state has ever elected. Kneip and his wife, Nancy, moved into the governor&#x27;s mansion, along with their eight sons.

Kneip&#x27;s first term was noted for major reform efforts. He successfully overhauled the organization of state government by creating a cabinet system. Kneip was re-elected in 1972, and became the last governor of South Dakota to serve a two-year term. He twice served two-year terms and then was elected to a final four-year term in 1974. This made Kneip the first governor to be elected three times.
Kneip appeared on the November 19, 1977, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as one of the five finalists in the show&#x27;s &quot;Anyone Can Host&quot; contest, which was won by Miskel Spillman.

===Educational efforts===
Some of Kneip&#x27;s most significant achievements was preventing the closure of South Dakota State University&#x27;s now-J. Lohr School of Engineering and opening the four-year University of South Dakota School of Medicine.

==Wounded Knee Incident of 1973==
At the start of Kneip&#x27;s second term in 1973, the state gained national attention because of a standoff between Native American activists and government agents at Wounded Knee, later known as the second Wounded Knee Incident.

==Foreign service==
Kneip resigned as governor on July 24, 1978, a few months before the expiration of his third term. He had been selected by President Jimmy Carter to become the United States ambassador to Singapore.

==Death and legacy==

Kneip sought to return to the governor&#x27;s mansion in 1986, but he narrowly lost his party&#x27;s nomination in the state Democratic Party primary to nominee Lars Herseth that June.

Although he had pondered yet another attempt at returning to public life, Kneip was diagnosed with cancer in early 1987. He died in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, on March 9, 1987, at the age of 54. He is the most recent Democrat elected to the Governorship of South Dakota.

In 1997, U.S. Highway 14 from Brookings to Elkton, was officially designated as the Richard Kneip Memorial Highway.

<doc id="498089" wikidata="Q1195404" url="?curid=498089" title="Murray Edwards College, Cambridge">
<text>Murray Edwards College is a women-only constituent college of the University of Cambridge. It was founded in 1954 as New Hall and renamed in 2008. The name honours a gift of £30 million by alumna Ros Edwards and her husband Steve, and the first President and woman Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, Rosemary Murray.

==History==


New Hall was founded in 1954, housing sixteen students in Silver Street where Darwin College now stands. Cambridge then had the lowest proportion of women undergraduates of any university in the United Kingdom and only two other colleges (Girton and Newnham) admitted female students. 

In 1962, members of the Darwin family gave their home, &quot;The Orchard&quot;, to the College. This new site was located on Huntingdon Road, about a mile from the centre of Cambridge. The architects chosen were Chamberlin, Powell and Bon, who are known for their design of the Barbican in London, and fundraising commenced. The building work began in 1964 and was completed by W. &amp; C. French in 1965. The new college could house up to 300 students.

In 1967, one of the college&#x27;s PhD students, Jocelyn Bell Burnell, a researcher in the university radio astronomy group, discovered the first four pulsars, leading to a Nobel Prize for her supervisor, and, ultimately, for Bell Burnell herself, a position as a research professor at the University of Oxford.

In 1975, the college&#x27;s President Rosemary Murray became the first woman to hold the post of vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge. Two subsequent presidents, Anne Lonsdale and Jennifer Barnes, have become pro-vice-chancellors of the University.

Following a 2005 donation of £30 million by alumna Rosalind Edwards () and her husband Steve Edwards to secure its future, in early 2008 New Hall was renamed Murray Edwards College, honouring the first President, Dame Rosemary Murray, and the benefactors. There was some opposition to this as the new name incorporated a man&#x27;s surname, despite the college being reserved for women students. Ros Edwards had attended the college in the 1980s and made a fortune with her partner when their software company Geneva Technology was sold to Convergys in 2001.

Men-only Cambridge colleges were converted into mixed-sex colleges in the 1970s and 1980s. Since the 2006 announcement that the University of Oxford&#x27;s last remaining women-only college, St Hilda&#x27;s, would also admit men, Cambridge is the only United Kingdom university that partially maintains a female-only student admissions policy, represented by Newnham and Murray Edwards. The fellowship and staff at Murray Edwards College are recruited from all genders. There is no bar to male students frequenting the college and many are taught there by Murray Edwards&#x27; fellows.

==Arms and logo==
New Hall received its Royal Charter in 1972. The Arms of the college are emblazoned as follows:

:&quot;Sable a Dolphin palewise head downwards to the dexter in chief three Mullets fesswise a Bordure embattled Argent&quot;

In plain English, this means: on a black background, place the following features in silver. Vertically in the centre, place a dolphin with head downwards to the left. On top, place three stars horizontally across. Bordering the arms, place a square wave representing the battlements of a castle.

The black castellation round the arms marks the college&#x27;s location on Castle Hill. The three stars are borrowed from the Murray coat of arms, while the heraldic dolphin symbolises a youthful spirit of exploration and discovery, and a kindly intelligence.

The college had designed a new logo to mark its transition from New Hall to Murray Edwards College. It was based on the design of the interior of the dining hall (the &quot;Dome&quot;) and was called the &#x27;spark&#x27;. However, on consultation with its alumnae, the college decided to continue to use its arms in official materials.

==Buildings==
Like many of the other Cambridge colleges, Murray Edwards College was not built all at one time but expanded as the need arose, over several time periods. The college therefore has several accommodation blocks of differing styles. In order of construction:
* Orchard Court (also known as Old Block) recalls the name of the grounds now occupied by the college, which was The Orchard, a large house part-owned by Norah Barlow, granddaughter of Charles Darwin. It is divided into the Wolfson, Nuffield and Spooner Wings, named after donors to New Hall during its first few decades. Part of the original structure was designed in the 1960s and completed in 1965. In 2009, part of this block was refurbished to improve fire safety and living standards. Some student rooms are split across two levels, meaning they have a bedroom upstairs and a separate living space downstairs. Many of the rooms have access to a shared balcony. 
* Pearl House (formerly known as New Block), named after Valerie Pearl, the second president of the college. The building was constructed with funding from the Kaetsu Foundation. All rooms are &quot;en suite&quot;. Wheelchair access is available to each floor via the central lift. Opened in 1994, this is where first year undergraduates are accommodated. Unlike most colleges at Cambridge, the building offers fully equipped kitchens, baths and a lift. 
* Buckingham House. The current building was a replacement for another building of the same name that stood on this site, and was opened in 2001. All rooms are &quot;en suite&quot;. The building is wheelchair accessible and has a lift. Contains a 142-seat auditorium which is used for lectures, film festivals and concerts.
* Canning and Eliza Fok House is named after the Hong Kong entrepreneur Canning Fok and his wife Eliza Fok, who donated the funds for constructing this accommodation block. All rooms are &quot;en suite&quot;. The building is wheelchair accessible and has a lift. Opened in 2008. Canning and Eliza Fok House is specifically built to accommodate the growing population of graduate students at Murray Edwards, and has a large shared kitchen/living area between 8 bedrooms. 
The first buildings of the college on Huntingdon Road were designed by the architects, Chamberlin, Powell and Bon, and are listed Grade II* (particularly important buildings of more than special interest). This includes:
* The Dome, which features some of the artwork the college is famed for, as well as a rising servery (a bar that rises from the floor for special events). This is where the cafeteria is located. Students take their meals here, including Saturday and Sunday brunch, often cited as the best brunch in Cambridge. Formals are held here, once a week on a Tuesday. 
* Fountain Court, which can be accessed from the bar and looks into the library, and features an illuminated fountain and waterways. Tables and chairs are put out there in warmer months as well as displays of flowers. 
* The Library, which was designed to reflect the interior of a Cathedral. Students can request heaters, blankets, tea, coffee and biscuits as they study. Yoga sessions, arts and craft and a variety of other welfare events are held here and it is open 24/7.

==Gardens==
The college gardens have an informal style, initially planned and planted by the first president, Dame Rosemary Murray. The gardens include a greenhouse originally belonging to the estate of the Darwin family, where banana plants are grown during the winter months.

In 2007, Murray Edwards College (then New Hall) became the first Cambridge College to participate in the RHS Chelsea Flower Show. The theme of the presented garden was the Transit of Venus, and was awarded a Bronze Flora medal in the Chic Garden Category. After the show, this garden was recreated in a slightly larger form beside the library.

As part of the Cambridge tradition of May Week, the college hosts an annual garden party that is popular with students from across the university. The garden party features a new theme each year and is well received by those in attendance. In Michaelmas (the Autumn/ Winter term), the college celebrates &#x27;Apple Day&#x27; in the gardens, a day of autumnal activities such as apple picking, cooking, crafting and bonfires. 

The students at Murray Edwards are encouraged to enjoy the gardens and walk on the lawns, meaning it is common to spot students sunbathing, studying, taking picnics or even relaxing on the small beach that is erected in the Summer. The gardens are maintained by professional staff, and recently also by fellows and students. Since 2012, gardening allotments have been provided for fellows, undergraduates and postgraduates for growing herbs and vegetables, in addition to the flowers and herbs already planted by the gardeners.

==Studentships==
The college maintains a fund for graduate research, including the Stephan Körner graduate studentship for studies in philosophy, classics or law.

==The Women&#x27;s Art Collection==

Murray Edwards is home to The Women&#x27;s Art Collection (known until 2022 as the New Hall Art Collection), the largest collection of women&#x27;s art in Europe, and the second largest in the world (the largest being the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C.).

The artwork can be seen throughout College, and students are encouraged to request pieces to be brought into their bedrooms as decoration. 

The New Hall Art Collection was started in the early 1990s, when New Hall had few pieces of art and most of them were portraits of old gentleman. The college president wrote to 100 women artists and asked each to donate one piece of art, and more than 75% of the artists approached agreed to give a piece of work. Donations have continued since, and the Art Collection now contains work by many famous women artists, including:

* Gillian Ayres
* Fiona Banner
* Wilhelmina Barns-Graham
* Sandra Blow
* Helaine Blumenfeld
* Judy Chicago
* Eileen Cooper

<doc id="498090" wikidata="Q463299" url="?curid=498090" title="Clorinda Matto de Turner">
<text>Clorinda Matto de Turner (11 November 1852 in Cusco – 25 October 1909) was a Peruvian writer who lived during the early years of Latin American independence. Her own independence inspired women throughout the region as her writings sparked controversy in her own culture. She was forced into exile to Argentina.

== Early life and education==
She was born and raised in Cuzco, Peru. Matto de Turner&#x27;s father was Ramón Mato Torres and her mother was Grimanesa Concepción Usandivares. When her mother died, she became known as &quot;Azucena de los Andes&quot; (&quot;Lily of the Andes&quot;) throughout the region. Matto de Turner was baptized Grimanesa Martina Mato, but was called Clorinda among her friends and family. She originally had one &quot;T&quot; in her last name, but after studying the Inca culture she added the extra &quot;T&quot; to give the name an Inca flavor.

Growing up in Cuzco, the former Inca capital, Matto spent most of her days on her family&#x27;s estate, Paullo Chico, which is near the village of Coya. As a teenager, Matto attended the school that is now known as the Escuela Nacional de Educandas (National Women&#x27;s Secondary School). There she took some very unconventional courses that were viewed as unfeminine in the culture. She majored in independent studies, which included Philosophy, Natural History, and Physics. Matto left school at the age of sixteen to spend more time taking care of her brother and father.

==Career==

In 1871, at the age of 19, Matto married an Englishman, Dr. Turner, a wealthy landowner. Shortly after their marriage they moved to Tinta, where they lived for 10 years. In Tinta, Matto de Turner became more aware of Peru&#x27;s two histories: the colonial and the Inca. She became very familiar with indigenous culture, and the more she learned, the more she embraced it. Much of her writing is inspired by what she learned from her acquaintance with this culture. She found work as a journalist, with local and foreign papers. In 1878, Matto de Turner founded &quot;El Recreo de Casco&quot;, a magazine offering literature, science, art and education. She became known for literary works that portrayed indigenous people in a positive light, in contrast to the mainstream views of her society. Even though she was of white ancestry, she did not agree with the oppressive treatment of Peru&#x27;s indigenous peoples, and she used her writings to speak out on their behalf. Matto de Turner also used her writings to campaign for better education for women.

In 1881, her husband died, leaving the estate bankrupt. Unable to improve her financial situation in Tinta, Matto de Turner moved to Arequipa where she worked as editor in chief at the newspaper &quot;La Bolsa Americana&quot;. While there she published two volumes of &quot;tradiciones cuzqueñas,&quot; one in 1884 and another in 1886. She also wrote the drama &quot;Himacc-Suacc&quot; (1884) and translated the four Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistle to the Romans into the Quechua language spoken by the indigenous people in the Cuzco Region of Peru. Besides her literary works she also got involved in politics, and raised money for the development of the battleship &quot;Almirante Grau&quot;.

Matto de Turner eventually moved from Tinta to live in Lima, although with her political and controversial writings she often thought it would be safer to live outside of Peru. In Lima she joined many different literary organizations and publications.

In 1887, Matto de Turner became director of &quot;El Peru Ilustrado&quot;, where she published many of her novels. She published three novels between 1889 and 1895: &quot;Aves Sin Nido&quot; (Birds Without a Nest), &quot;Indole&quot; (Character), and &quot;Herencia&quot; (Heredity). These novels talk about the indigenous people getting stripped of all their civil rights as well as getting persecuted by the community and the self-indulgent priests. Matto de Turner&#x27;s most famous novel was &quot;Aves Sin Nido&quot; (translated as &quot;Torn from the Nest&quot;)(1889). This novel was controversial because it was about a love affair between a white man and an indigenous woman, which was considered a disgrace among Latin American society during this time, and because it spoke of the immorality of the priests during that period. The reason the characters in the novel couldn&#x27;t marry was because they eventually learned that they were both fathered by the same philandering priest. &quot;Aves Sin Nido&quot; was not Matto de Turner&#x27;s only controversial work. She also published a controversial story written by a Brazilian writer by the name of Henrique Coelho Neto in her newspaper, &quot;El Perú Illustrado&quot;. Her controversial writings led to her excommunication by the Archbishop.

In 1895, she moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she continued her literary activities. In 1900, she wrote &quot;Boreales, Miniaturas y Porcelanas&quot; (Northerners, Miniatures, and Porcelain) a collection of essays which includes &quot;Narraciones históricas,&quot; an important historiographical contribution that shows her deep sorrow at being exiled from Peru and her longing to return. In Buenos Aires Matto de Turner founded &quot;Búcaro Americano&quot;; she also gave numerous public lectures and wrote many articles for the press. Matto de Turner spent most of her time teaching at a local university as a professor. In 1908, when she visited Europe for the first time in her life, she made sure to carefully document this in the book &quot;Viaje de Recreo&quot; (Trip of Amusement). The book was released in newspapers upon her death in 1909.

<text>The Township of Wellesley is the rural, north-western township of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. It encompasses and had a population of 11,260 in the Canada 2016 Census.

==History==


By 1805, many Mennonites from Pennsylvania had settled nearby in Berlin but Wellesley Township itself was not surveyed until 1842-43, due to being part of the Queen&#x27;s Bush a region with a large Black settler population.

In 1837, John Philip Schweitzer from Germany squatted at what is now Hawkesville, and had of land cleared over the following nine years. Then, John Hawke received government permission to buy the clearing for $700.00 on the condition that he build a grist mill (for flour) and a sawmill within two years.

The village of St. Clements was settled in 1840, by Michael Spiehlmacker. A post office opened in 1853. By 1864, there was a large Roman Catholic church, two stores, three hotels and some tradesmen, although the population was only about 100. By 1869, the population had increased to 200 and the post office was receiving mail daily.

Records from 1846 about the entire Township indicate that much of the land had been &quot;Queen&#x27;s Rush, crown land, where fifty acre lots were given away to actual settlers&quot;. The Population of the entire township in 1841, was only 254.

The area now the village of Wellesley on the Nith River was first settled in 1847, by John Smith and was originally called &quot;Schmidtsville&quot;. The post office opened in 1851 and the village was renamed &quot;Wellesley&quot; after Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, the eldest brother of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. The community quickly grew to be the largest economic centre in rural Waterloo County, with a wood mill, feed mill, a grain mill (which still stands after being constructed in 1856), leather tanner, cheese factory, restaurants and housing, and many other businesses that also brought much trade to the town from the nearby farms and farming villages. By 1864, the village also had two stores, a flour mill, three wagon makers, boot and shoe shops, a hotel two churches and a school with 78 students. By 1869, the population of the village of Wellesley was 400; the nearest rail station was away in Baden.

The village of Heidelberg was settled in the 1840s and had a post office by 1855, receiving mail three times a week. By 1864, it contained two stores, two hotels, a Lutheran Church, and a school; the population was about 250. The township had three Roman Catholic Separate schools. In 1869, the village of Bamberg had a population of 200; it was on the stagecoach line to St. Agatha.

When the Waterloo County boundaries were established in 1852 to include the townships of Waterloo, Wellesley, Wilmot, Woolwich, and North Dumfries, John Hawke was named the first reeve of Wellesley and the first township hall was built in Hawkesville. When the decision was being made for the location of a county seat, Hawkesville originally anticipated being chosen over Berlin and Galt. However, John Hawke had the deciding vote, and he cast it in favour of Berlin. With the railway and the county seat, Berlin began to grow rapidly and kept on growing; Hawkesville flourished only until the end of the century before diminishing.

At the end of the 1900s, the area was home to doctors, blacksmiths, and merchants, as well as a tannery, hotels, and churches. Into the early 1900s, the village carriage and wagon maker, George Diefenbacker (his preferred spelling) would entertain his grandson, John Diefenbaker, each summer.

The first library in Wellesley Village was incorporated in 1900, and except for the period between 1916 and 1921, there has been continuous public library service ever since. The current branch, now part of the Region of Waterloo Library system, is located in the former S.S. No. 16 Wellesley Township public school building. The school closed its doors in 1967. The building gradually came back to life as the library was placed in the left classroom on the main floor in July 1970.

A residential summer camp for children has been located on Paradise Lake, located near Bamberg, since 1924; Camp Ki-WaY was owned by the Kiwanis Club until 2009 when it was donated to the YMCA. The early settlers of Bamberg were from Germany and the village was initially named Weimar; it was changed to Bamberg in 1852. The first settlers were squatters, including the Moser and Kroetsch families. By 1904, Bamberg, had two general stores, various businesses, a brewery, and post office.

==Geography==
The country scenery and rolling hills, along with its small-town feel, have gradually transformed the township into a growing commuter town with a population mostly living in suburban developments, and travelling into the nearby cities of Kitchener and Waterloo for work.

Hawkesville never would get the railroad. On a hill itself, ringed by the flat of the Conestogo River, itself inside a ring of tall hills, it was deemed too difficult a task to bring the trains through town. Instead of progress, Hawkesville has maintained the charm of the surrounding sugar maple woods and the quiet river banks. Summer mornings are sure to find a few young fishermen reclined on the bank, reeling in northern pike, yellow perch, and rainbow trout.

To the south, the tall hills beyond the river plain shelters a large gravel pit and in the skies over the hills, the river, the village and the woods, are sure to be found the red-tailed hawk and the common sightings of cardinals, blue jays, robins, chickadees, nuthatch, and numerous song sparrow.

Paradise Lake is surrounded by cottages on private land; there is no public access to the water nor a public beach.

===Communities===
The township of Wellesley comprises the communities of Bamberg, Crosshill, Dorking, Hawkesville, Kingwood, Linwood, St. Clements, and Wellesley. The population was 576 in 2016.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Wellesley had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Economy==


Most of the earlier companies have left the town of Wellesley, but many historic buildings still remain that enrich the heritage of the downtown area. A notable business that had its beginning in Wellesley is Erb Transport, which moved to the nearby town of New Hamburg. Presently, the largest businesses in town are Wellesley Apple Products (founded in 1922), two hardware and lumber retailers, two feed retailers, a gas station, a bank, an arena, an accessible playground, a splash pad, a community centre, a grocery store, a drug store, a furniture store, a funeral home, retirement residences, three auto body shops, insurance brokerages, a veterinary clinic, a bakery, a flower shop, a pizza shop, a chiropractor, a catering business, three restaurants, a butcher shop, gourmet meats and deli, an art gallery, and numerous hair dressers.

Hawkesville is home to several small and medium size businesses including the larger Frey Building Contractors and the Country Lane Builders. The town is home to three furniture businesses: Chervin Custom Woodworks, Hawkwoods Custom Furniture, and Homestead Woodworks. Hawkesville was also home to Noah Martin and his famous summer sausage. Since his passing, Noah Martin&#x27;s summer sausage has been made outside of Hawkesville.

The largest employer in the township is Jones Feed Mill, located in Linwood. They manufacture a large array of livestock and pet feeds as well as edible grains out of four facilities. The mill has been family run for almost 100 years. Currently Jeff Jones, grandson of the founder, is the president and CEO. Linwood is also home to Linwood Veterinary Services, one of the largest farm animal veterinary clinics in southwestern Ontario.

Also, there are many small manufacturing companies in the township such as EMB Manufacturing, makers of the Wallenstein brand of forestry equipment.

==Arts and culture==
In celebration of some of the town&#x27;s most well-known exports, the Wellesley Apple Butter and Cheese Festival was first held in 1975, and has been held annually on the last Saturday in September ever since. The festivities include many street market venues, coach rides, remote-controlled boat races, open heritage sites and amusements, horseshoe-pitching contests, guided farm tours, live music, meals that can be purchased on the main street, and a classic car show, all of which now attract thousands of visitors each year.

Linwood hosted its first Elvis festival in August 2008. This features Elvis impersonators from throughout Ontario.

On June 24, 2006, the town held its first annual Art Around the Pond gala where artisans of all kind were able to exhibit and advertise their creations and expertise. Stalls and tables are organized around the north and south sides of the Wellesley Pond while visitors can navigate the trail on the east side to access both ends. Speeches by local governors are given and live music is played on the central island.

The Wellesley Fall Fair is held once every year on the second Tuesday and Wednesday of September following Labour Day. There is a parade at around noon on the Wednesday that the local public school participates in and there are also rides and activities located on the community centre grounds.

Wellesley has also held the Wellesley Santa Claus Parade early in December since 2005 which includes floats created by many local businesses, churches and other organizations from around the area mainly driving down Queen&#x27;s Bush Road, Nafziger Road, Maple Leaf Street, and Molesworth Street.

Though only the Hawkesville Mennonite Church and the Countryside Conservative Mennonite Fellowship remain, Hawkesville has been the birthplace of several congregations. A Presbyterian congregation worshipped in town from 1868 to 1946. Their old church building was dedicated as Hawkesville Mennonite Church on January 1, 1950.

A United Brethren church also existed in Hawkesville from 1865 until 1904. The gothic windows and rafters are still visible inside the shop of Hawkwoods Custom Furniture.

Another group started meeting in 1931 and completed the building of a Gospel Hall next door to the village&#x27;s cemetery in 1939. This group became the Hawkesville Bible Chapel, but their Hall became overcrowded and they moved into a new building in Wallenstein in 1968 where the Wallenstein Bible Chapel remains today.

The first Catholic Church built in the township was a log church built in St. Clements around 1840, in 1853, the log church was deemed too small and in 1858, a large brick church was completed. A brass band from Buffalo, New York gave a concert before the church dedication. At the time of its opening, it was said to be the largest and finest church west of Toronto.

The Region of Waterloo Library operates branches in St. Clements, Linwood and Wellesley Village, which host author readings, family storytimes, and a variety of other programs.

==Sports==

Wellesley is home to the Wellesley Applejacks, a junior hockey team that plays in the Provincial Junior Hockey League.

The Linwood Chiefs are the township&#x27;s main junior fastball club and play in the South Perth Men&#x27;s Fastball League.

The Wellesley Fishing Derby is an annual event, held on Labour Day Monday, also located on the pond in which fishers attempt to catch three tagged fish which cash prizes are awarded for.

On occasion, the Canadian Horseshoe Pitching Championships are held in Wellesley at the Kitchener-Waterloo Khaki Club. They&#x27;ve been in town the years of 1983, 1985, 1995, and 2001.

The community hosts an inter-township soap box derby, Wellesley Soap Box Classic that includes numerous teams and individual contestants who race their vehicles down the hill of Nafziger Road, just short of the downtown area.

<text>The Atlas Supervisor was the program which managed the allocation of processing resources of Manchester University&#x27;s Atlas Computer so that the machine was able to act on many tasks and user programs concurrently.

Its various functions included running the Atlas computer&#x27;s virtual memory (Atlas Supervisor paper, section 3, Store Organisation) and is ‘considered by many to be the first recognisable modern operating system’. Brinch Hansen described it as &quot;the most significant breakthrough in the history of operating systems.&quot;

<text>Erotic furniture, also known as sex furniture, is any form of furniture that is designed to act as an aid to sexual activity. This includes furniture and harnesses designed to aid positioning, assisting with comfort, penetration level and stimulation. Other types of erotic furniture are constructed to be an aid to erotic bondage. The functionality may be obvious or the erotic furniture may be designed to appear as conventional furniture. Some conventional items of furniture such as the four-poster bed and the chaise longue traditionally have erotic associations, but they are not considered to be erotic furniture as their primary use is not erotic. Erotic furniture can also be furniture decorated with erotic art.

==History==
In ancient Assyria, there are examples of furniture decorated with erotic reliefs dating to the 13th century BC.

According to an urban legend, the 18th-century Russian Empress Catherine the Great collected erotic furniture, including tables with penises for legs and other items carved in relief with penises and vulvas.

The 1791 French novel &quot;Les Délices de Coblentz&quot; describes beds that are designed to increase sexual pleasure by virtue of the elasticity of their springs.

The British king Edward VII, who was heavily overweight, used a specially constructed &quot;love chair&quot; () when he visited the famous brothel, Le Chabanais in Paris. The piece still exists and a replica is exhibited at the Musée de l&#x27;Erotisme in Pigalle.

Edward Gorey&#x27;s &quot;The Curious Sofa&quot;, (1961) is a neo-Victorian pseudo-porno satire described as a &quot;pornographic illustrated story about furniture&quot;. The book consists of euphemistic illustrations with strategically deployed objects, such as potted plants and tree branches, that block the reader&#x27;s view of sexual activities taking place on furniture.

The British pop artist Allen Jones has designed erotic furniture. His piece &quot;Hatstand, Table and Chair&quot;, consisting of scantily clad female mannequins converted to items of furniture, was first exhibited in 1970.

News reports during the 2024 Paris Olympics said that the bed bases provided for competing athletes were made from recycled cardboard to prevent them from having sex. However, the organisers said that the material was chosen for its environmental impact, and the manufacturer said they &quot;can support several people on top&quot;.

In modern times, erotic furniture continues to be produced mainly by small businesses rather than large scale manufacturers.

==Types==

Specifically designed furniture for erotic purposes can include:
* Devices to aid impact play activities such as erotic spanking and flagellation. This type of furniture includes spanking benches such as the Berkley Horse. Another example is the X-cross.
* Sex swings, either freestanding or temporarily installable in places such as doorways.
* Fisting slings
* Sex gliders (also known as monkey rockers) – rocking stools with built-in dildos
* Devices for using gravity to aid in lovemaking without the use of complicated slings.
* Various types of angled foam wedges or specially designed sex pillows that support various sex positions. Liberator Shapes are an example which can be used to improve g-spot and cervical stimulation. Another example are the ergonomically based Lovebumpers.
* Bondage equipment such as stocks, pillories and cages.
* Smotherboxes and other queening stools used for facesitting..
* Sex chairs and sex sofas, positioning furniture which in some cases have openings to allow for genital or anal access.
* The Love Chair, a chair made of curved tubular steel, articulated in several ways and designed to facilitate otherwise impossible sexual acts. This device was advertised in men&#x27;s magazines in the mid-1970s, and is seen in at least one of Nina Hartley&#x27;s &quot;Guide to&quot; videos, but it is no longer commercially available.
* Wooden horses, which are shaped much like the sawhorses used for carpentry, but have a sharpened edge and are primarily sat on to achieve a feeling similar to a crotch rope in bondage.
* Sybians, a type of sex machine consisting of a vibrating saddle-like seat with an upward-pointing shaft for internal stimulation.

<doc id="498103" wikidata="Q3567563" url="?curid=498103" title="Westwood One (1976–2011)">
<text>Westwood One was an American radio network that was based in New York City. At one time, it was managed by CBS Radio, and was later purchased by the private equity firm, The Gores Group. Due to purchases, mergers and other forms of consolidation in the 1980s and 1990s, at one time or another, it had ownership stakes in or syndication rights to some of the most famous brands in network radio, including CBS, NBC, Mutual, CNN, Fox, and Unistar. The company was one of the largest producers and distributors of radio programming in the United States. It broadcast entertainment, news, weather, sports, talk, and traffic programming to about 7,700 radio stations across the United States. The company was the top provider of local traffic reports in the U.S. through its subsidiaries, Metro Networks, Shadow Broadcast Services, SmartRoute Systems, and Sigalert.com. Westwood One also offers weather services; originally using Accuweather, Westwood switched to The Weather Channel in 2009.

Oaktree Capital Management, through its Triton Media Group division, merged with Westwood One in October 2011. Triton then folded Westwood One into its Dial Global subsidiary. The Westwood One name was initially retained for most sports programming. However, starting with the 2011–12 NFL playoffs, Westwood One&#x27;s sports programming was branded as &quot;Westwood One on the Dial Global Radio Network.&quot; After the NFL Playoffs concluded, the Westwood One name was removed altogether in favor of the Dial Global Sports Network, and the sports website was relocated to www.dialglobalsports.com.

On September 4, 2013, Dial Global announced that it was renaming itself Westwood One, citing greater brand recognition.

==History==
The company was founded by Norman J. Pattiz in 1976. At the time, he was a former advertising sales executive with KCOP-TV, a Los Angeles TV station. He was listening to a local radio station doing a Motown weekend and decided to syndicate &quot;The Sound of Motown&quot; to radio. The show was a success. He added several more shows during the 1970s, including Dr. Demento and Mary Turner&#x27;s &quot;Off The Record&quot;. In 1981 Pattiz started recording live concerts for broadcast with a Chuck Berry performance that January. The company was a leader in live broadcasts and concert recordings for radio until May 2011. By 1982, he was distributing his radio shows via satellite through an arrangement with idb Communications in Culver City. Pattiz took Westwood One public in 1984 and with the money raised by the IPO, he purchased the Mutual Broadcasting System the following year and the NBC Radio Network in 1987. Other highlights in the late 1980s include the purchase of three radio stations, the trade paper &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;, and the hiring of Casey Kasem from ABC.

Although Pattiz long remained a major shareholder and board chairman, control and management shifted to others in the early 1990s. In 1993, operations were shifted to radio station group owner Infinity Broadcasting, headed by Mel Karmazin, who also took over direct management of Westwood. With Infinity already owning and managing competing Unistar Radio Networks (formerly known as the RKO Radio Networks and later as United Stations Radio Networks, which merged with Transtar in the late 1980s), the two companies were combined under the Westwood name in 1994 (later spinning off Transtar in 2006). After the sale of his Infinity Broadcasting to Westinghouse, then parent of CBS, Karmazin went on to become COO of CBS and under his control, CBS took over management of Westwood. CBS also had a significant ownership stake in Westwood, which then purchased Metro Networks in 1999 in a three-way merger including Copter Acquisition Corp. and Westwood. On August 30, 2010, Pattiz was succeeded as chairman by Mark Stone, senior managing director of the Gores Group, which by then was the majority owner and controlled Westwood. A Westwood press release said Pattiz signed a new contract as a company consultant. Pattiz has now started &quot;PodcastOne,&quot; providing a hub for listeners to find their favorite radio personalities.

===Purchase of Mutual and NBC===
In 1985, Westwood One purchased the Mutual Broadcasting System, one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of the 1940s in American radio, continuing to operate it as a separate network into the 1990s. Thereafter, Mutual became a brand name for certain programming provided by Westwood One. CBS-run Westwood One retired Mutual in April, 1999 dropping it in favor of CNN Radio, to which Westwood One had syndication rights following its 1994 merger with Unistar.

Two years after the Mutual purchase, in 1987, Westwood One acquired the NBC Radio Network and licensed the use of the name NBC Radio Network News (later shortened to NBC Radio News) from General Electric, which was divesting all of the NBC radio properties of its former owner RCA. Like Mutual, NBC ceased operating as a radio network and merely became a brand name, even to the point of being merged into Mutual itself. NBC&#x27;s other services, The Source and NBC Talknet, would eventually be retired in the late 1990s.

Until the Dial Global merger, the NBC Radio brand was still occasionally used, including twice daily at the halfway point and conclusion of the early morning news magazine &quot;First Light&quot; (which has since revived the NBC branding throughout the program). In 2003, NBC News began contracting with Westwood One to produce a new radio news service, NBC News Radio, consisting of one-minute updates written by Westwood staffers and read by NBC News talent. Westwood One also distributed &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, monologues of NBC&#x27;s late night programming, CNBC radio reports, and localized forecasts for The Weather Channel, which effectively united all of NBC&#x27;s programming under one network.

Westwood One provided operational, sales, and marketing support for the CBS Radio Network, whose properties were owned by the CBS Corporation. In turn, CBS managed production of Mutual and NBC Radio newscasts from 1998 until the retirement of the original NBC Radio top-of-the-hour newscasts in June 2004. The CBS Radio news and sports broadcasts (the latter specifically branded as &quot;from Westwood One&quot;) were distributed from the CBS/Westwood One Master Control at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.

Westwood One also provided alternate feeds of NFL football games to Sirius Satellite Radio.

Westwood One expanded into digital media with the hiring of radio veteran Gary Krantz in 2006; he remained with the company until March 2008.

===Sale===
On May 4, 2007, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Westwood One had retained investment bank UBS to seek potential buyers for the network.

In October 2007, Westwood and CBS Radio signed a new contractual agreement by which Westwood would hire its own officers and directors, and CBS would use Westwood One programming and trademark licenses. Westwood also had use of CBS trademarks under the agreement, which was filed as part of the companies&#x27; public disclosures with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The agreement took effect on March 3, 2008, the same day that Gores Radio Group invested $12.5 million as part of a multi-stage investment takeover of Westwood One. The second stage of the Gores investment happened only two weeks later with another $12.5 million, giving Gores Radio direct ownership of more than 14 million shares of Westwood One stock.

Westwood One stock was traded on the New York Stock Exchange until November 21, 2008, when it was delisted for failing to maintain market capitalization requirements. Thereafter, shares of the company traded publicly on the Pink Sheets under the stock symbol WWON.PK. After further stock losses, the Gores Group bought the company outright in March 2009 and relisted it on NASDAQ later that year under the ticker symbol &quot;DIAL.&quot;

Westwood One announced its merger with Dial Global in August 2011, closing it on October 21, 2011.

On September 4, 2013, Dial Global, which had been bought by Cumulus Media, assumed the name Westwood One and absorbed Cumulus Media Networks (previously ABC Radio and Citadel Media).

==Overview==
The company was one of the largest producers and distributors of radio programming in the United States. It broadcast entertainment, news, weather, sports, talk, and traffic programming to about 7,700 radio stations across the USA. It is America&#x27;s top provider of local traffic reports through its subsidiaries Metro Networks, Shadow Broadcast Services, SmartRoute Systems, and Sigalert.com. Westwood One also offers weather services, originally using Accuweather before switching to The Weather Channel in 2009.

===Notable personalities===
Talk radio personalities distributed by Westwood One included at various times Don and Mike, Phil Valentine, Dennis Miller, Jim Bohannon, Billy Bush, Robert Wuhl, Drew Pinsky (&quot;Loveline&quot;), G. Gordon Liddy, Joe Scarborough, Kevin and Bean, Tom Leykis, Opie and Anthony, and Adam Carolla. The company syndicated these shows across AM and FM affiliates but did not provide the programs to satellite radio. Westwood One distributed the radio news operations of CNN and NBC as well as its corporate cousin, the CBS Radio Network.

In 1988, Casey Kasem moved from ABC Radio Networks to Westwood One after a contract dispute. Pattiz created &quot;Casey&#x27;s Top 40, Casey&#x27;s Countdown,&quot; and &quot;Casey&#x27;s Hot 20&quot; for him. Kasem stayed with the network for nine years, leaving in 1998 when AM/FM Radio Networks (now Premiere Radio Networks) allowed him to bring back &quot;American Top 40&quot;.

In the early 2000s, Westwood One handled the distribution of Fox News Radio; that has since moved to Premiere Radio Networks. One Fox program, &quot;The Radio Factor&quot;, hosted by Bill O&#x27;Reilly, continued to be distributed by Westwood One until his departure from the show in January 2009. The time slot was later filled by Fred Thompson and Douglas Urbanski.

&quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; was carried on Westwood One from 1993 until the controversy surrounding his remarks about the Rutgers women&#x27;s basketball team led to his firing in 2007. The program was then heard on Cumulus Media Networks until the show ended in June 2018.

In 2009, the network added several short-form features based on television series syndicated by CBS Television Distribution: &quot;The Doctors&#x27; Orders&quot;, &quot;Ask Dr. Phil&quot;, &quot;Rach on the Radio&quot;, and &quot;The Insider Radio Minute&quot;.

Westwood One attempted to secure the rights to &quot;The Savage Nation&quot;, but current syndicator Talk Radio Network refused to let host Michael Savage out of what apparently is a perpetual contract. By the time the dispute was settled in Savage&#x27;s favor, Westwood One had already dissolved.

Rick Dees moved from Citadel Media to Westwood One in 2011.

===24-hour radio formats via satellite to affiliate stations===
Until 2006, Westwood One distributed a number of 24-hour radio formats via satellite to affiliate stations. These formats included: Adult Rock &amp; Roll (classic rock), Adult Standards (formerly AM Only), Bright AC (hot adult contemporary), CNN Headline News, Hot Country, Mainstream Country, SAM - Simply About Music (variety hits), Soft AC, The Oldies Channel, and Westwood One 70s. The 24-hour formats, originally acquired through Westwood One&#x27;s purchase of Unistar in 1993, were spun off in 2006 and are currently distributed under the Dial Global brand.

The lone exception is the audio feed of CNN Headline News, which remains part of the CNN Radio branding under Westwood One.

===Music programs syndicated===
Westwood One syndicated several popular programs for a variety of music formats. Perhaps its most famous alumnus was Casey Kasem, who spent over nine years hosting a weekly radio countdown franchise for the network.

Other shows included &quot;The Beatle Years&quot; with Bob Malik (originally hosted by Elliot Mintz and later J. J. Jackson), &quot;Beatle Brunch&quot; with Joe Johnson, &quot;Country Countdown USA&quot;, &quot;Superstar Concert Series&quot;, &quot;Absolutely Live,&quot; &quot;Country Gold&quot; (in most markets, also known as &quot;Country Gold Saturday Night&quot;, but also available on Sunday), &quot;Randy Jackson&#x27;s Hit List&quot; with Randy Jackson and Kesha Monk, &quot;106 and Park Weekend Countdown&quot; with Terrence and Rocsi, MTV &quot;TRL Weekend Countdown&quot;, &quot;Off the Record&quot; with Mary Turner (and later Joe Benson), &quot;VH1 Concerts and Specials&quot;, &quot;Out of Order with Jed the Fish&quot;, and the &quot;Country Six Pack&quot; of holiday music specials. &quot;The Dr. Demento Show&quot; was carried from 1978 to 1992.

Many of these programs were not maintained in the Dial Global merger; Compass Media Networks picked up the rock-oriented programs, the country programs were split up among various networks, and the fate of the pop programs is unknown.

===Live concerts and sports broadcasts===
Westwood One was most notable for its coverage and location recording of live concerts and events for broadcast/distribution via LP and eventually satellite. They syndicated the summer solstice Grateful Dead concert on June 21, 1989, a service that currently conglomerated radio stations no longer do. Since the merger with Dial Global, the company no longer records live music and has shut down its mobile recording division.

The company holds exclusive national radio rights for many sporting events including National Football League and college football games, the Olympic Games, the NCAA basketball tournament (this and NFL coverage are co-produced with corporate sibling CBS TV), the Masters and U.S. Open golf, the Wimbledon tennis tournament, the Frozen Four of college hockey, and the GRAMMY Awards. For many years the network also aired Notre Dame football and National Hockey League games.

Westwood One has also handled sales and advertising for the Sports USA Radio Network since 2009. Notable sports announcers for Dial Global include: Scott Graham, Kevin Harlan, Brad Sham, Dave Sims, Kevin Kugler, John Tautges, John Sadak, Ian Eagle, Tom McCarthy, Chuck Cooperstein, Kevin Calabro, and Dave Ryan. Past personalities include Marv Albert, Howard David, Gary Cohen, and Harry Kalas.

===Syndicated news and traffic programming===
In 2005, Westwood One, Inc. and its traffic subsidiary, Metro Networks, sent several existing officers and directors of Westwood to Canada and Australia to unify a number of helicopter aviation companies that were already providing reports to Westwood One and Metro Networks&#x27; affiliates. The result was the formation of the Global Traffic Network, which began taking deliveries of Robinson R44 news helicopters in 2005. The companies signed a three-way content and data sharing agreement in November 2005.

<text>A short film is a film with a low running time. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) defines a short film as &quot;an original motion picture that has a running time of not more than 40 minutes including all credits&quot;. Other film organizations may use different definitions, however; the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, for example, currently defines a short film as 45 minutes or less in the case of documentaries, and 59 minutes or less in the case of scripted narrative films.

In the United States, short films were generally termed short subjects from the 1920s into the 1970s when confined to two 35 mm reels or less, and featurettes for a film of three or four reels. &quot;Short&quot; was an abbreviation for either term.

The increasingly rare industry term &quot;short subject&quot; carries more of an assumption that the film is shown as part of a presentation along with a feature film. Short films are often screened at local, national, or international film festivals and made by independent filmmakers with either a low budget or no budget at all. They are usually funded by one or more film grants, nonprofit organizations, sponsors, or personal funds. Short films are generally used for industry experience and as a platform to showcase talent to secure funding for future projects from private investors, a production company, or film studios. They can also be released with feature films, and can also be included as bonus features on some home video releases.

==History==
All films in the beginning of cinema were very short, sometimes running only a minute or less. It was not until the 1910s when films started to get longer than about ten minutes. The first set of films were presented in 1894 and it was through Thomas Edison&#x27;s device called a kinetoscope. It was made for individual viewing only. Comedy short films were produced in large numbers compared to lengthy features such as D. W. Griffith&#x27;s 1915 &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. By the 1920s, a ticket purchased a varied program including a feature and several supporting works from categories such as second feature, short comedy, 4–10 minute cartoon, travelogue, and newsreel.

Short comedies were especially common, and typically came in a serial or series (such as the &quot;Our Gang&quot; movies, or the many outings of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s Little Tramp character).

Animated cartoons came principally as short subjects. Virtually all major film production companies had units assigned to develop and produce shorts, and many companies, especially in the silent and very early sound era, produced mostly or only short subjects.

In the 1930s, the distribution system changed in many countries, owing to the Great Depression. Instead of the cinema owner assembling a program of their own choice, the studios sold a package centered on a main and supporting feature, a cartoon and little else. With the rise of the double feature, two-reel shorts went into decline as a commercial category.

The year 1938 proved to be a turning point in the history of film comedies. Hal Roach, for example, had discontinued all short-subject production except &quot;Our Gang&quot;, which he finally sold to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1938. The Vitaphone studio, owned by Warner Bros., discontinued its own line of two-reel comedies in 1938; Educational Pictures did as much that same year, owing to its president Earle W. Hammons unsuccessfully entering the feature-film field. With these major comedy producers out of the running, Columbia Pictures actually expanded its own operations and launched a second two-reel-comedy unit in 1938. Columbia and RKO Radio Pictures kept making two-reel comedies into the 1950s.

Theater managers found it easier and more convenient to fit shorter, one-reel (10-minute) subjects into their double-feature programs. In the live-action field, humorist Robert Benchley had been making short comedies since the dawn of sound; his various series for Fox, Vitaphone, MGM, and Paramount ran from 1928 to 1944. MGM&#x27;s &quot;Pete Smith Specialties&quot; had been a standard &quot;added attraction&quot; in moviehouse programming since 1935 and lasted through 1955. RKO&#x27;s &quot;Flicker Flashbacks&quot; revivals of silent films ran from 1943 to 1956, and Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Joe McDoakes&quot; comedies became a regular series in 1946 and lasted until 1956. By and large, however, the movies&#x27; one-reel subject of choice was the animated cartoon, produced by Walt Disney, Warner Bros., MGM, Paramount, Walter Lantz, Columbia, and Terrytoons.

One of the movies&#x27; oldest short-subject formats was the adventure serial, first established in 1912. A serial generally ran for 12 to 15 chapters, 15 to 20 minutes each. Every episode ended with the hero or heroine trapped in a life-threatening situation; audiences would have to return the following week to see the outcome. These &quot;chapter plays&quot; remained popular through the 1950s, although both Columbia and Republic Pictures were now making them as cheaply as possible, reusing action highlights from older serials and connecting them with a few new scenes showing identically dressed actors. Even after Republic quit making serials in 1955 and Columbia stopped in 1956, faithful audiences supported them and the studios re-released older serials through the mid-1960s. The 1964 revival of Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; serial resulted in a media frenzy, spurring a new &quot;Batman&quot; TV series and a wave of &quot;Batman&quot; merchandise.

With the rise of television, the commercial live-action short was virtually dead; most studios canceled their live-action series in 1956. Only The Three Stooges continued making two-reel comedies; their last was released in 1959. Short films had become a medium for student, independent, and specialty work.

Cartoon shorts had a longer life, due in part to the implementation of lower-cost limited animation techniques and the rise of television animation, which allowed shorts to have both theatrical runs and a syndication afterlife. Warner Bros., one of the most prolific of the golden era, underwent several reorganizations in the 1960s before exiting the short film business in 1969 (by which point the shorts had been in televised reruns for years). MGM continued &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; (first with a series of poorly-received Eastern European shorts by Gene Deitch, then a better-received run by Warner Bros. alumnus Chuck Jones) until 1967, and Woody Woodpecker lasted to 1972; the creative team behind MGM&#x27;s 1940s and 1950s cartoons formed Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1957, mainly focusing on television. &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; was the last regular theatrical cartoon short series, having begun in 1964 (and thus having spent its entire existence in the limited animation era) and ended in 1980. By the 1960s, the market for animated shorts had largely shifted to television, with existing theatrical shorts being syndicated to television.

==Modern era==
A few animated shorts continue within the mainstream commercial distribution. For instance, Pixar has screened a short along with each of its feature films during its initial theatrical run since 1995 (producing shorts permanently since 2001). Since Disney acquired Pixar in 2006, Disney has also produced animated shorts since 2007 with the Goofy short &quot;How to Hook Up Your Home Theater&quot; and produced a series of live-action ones featuring The Muppets for viewing on YouTube as viral videos to promote the 2011 movie of the same name.

In 2009 the horror short film, No Through Road, that would go viral was released, creating analog horror. The short film would spark 3 sequels, creating No Through Road (web series)

DreamWorks Animation often produces a short sequel to include in the special edition video releases of major features, and are typical of a sufficient length to be broadcast as a TV special, a few films from the studio have added theatrical shorts as well. Warner Bros. often includes old shorts from its considerable library, connected only thematically, on the DVD releases of classic WB movies. From 2010–2012, Warner Bros. also released new &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts before family films.

Shorts International and Magnolia Pictures organize an annual release of Academy Award-nominated short films in theatres across the US, UK, Canada and Mexico throughout February and March.

Shorts are occasionally broadcast as filler when a feature film or other work does not fit the standard broadcast schedule. ShortsTV was the first television channel dedicated to short films.

However, short films generally rely on film festival exhibition to reach an audience. Such movies can also be distributed via the Internet. Certain websites which encourage the submission of user-created short films, such as YouTube and Vimeo, have attracted large communities of artists and viewers. Sites like Omeleto, FILMSshort, Short of the Week, Short Films Matter, Short Central and some apps showcase curated shorts.

Short films are a typical first stage for new filmmakers, but professional actors and crews often still choose to create short films as an alternative form of expression. Amateur filmmaking has grown in popularity as equipment has become more accessible.

The lower production costs of short films often mean that short films can cover alternative subject matter as compared to higher budget feature films. Similarly, unconventional filmmaking techniques such as Pixilation or narratives that are told without dialogue, are more often seen in short films than features.

Tropfest claims to be the world&#x27;s largest short film festival. Tropfest now takes place in Australia (its birthplace), Arabia, the US and elsewhere. Originating in 1993, Tropfest is often credited as being at least partially responsible for the recent popularity of short films internationally. Also Couch Fest Films, part of Shnit Worldwide Filmfestival, claimed to be the world&#x27;s largest single-day short film festival.

Among the oldest film festivals dedicated to short films are Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival, France (since 1979), Tampere Film Festival, Finland (since 1969) and International Short Film Festival Oberhausen, Germany (since 1954). All of them are still considered the most important short film festival in the world to date.

<text>JOTX-DTV (channel 7), branded as is a Japanese television station that serves as the flagship of the TX Network. It is owned and operated by itself a subsidiary of the TV Tokyo Holdings Corporation, in turn controlled by Nikkei, Inc. It is headquartered in the Sumitomo Fudosan Roppongi Grand Tower in Roppongi, Minato, Tokyo. TV Tokyo is one of the five private broadcasters based in Tokyo, and the last to have started its broadcasts on VHF.

The predecessor of TV Tokyo was Tokyo Channel 12, which was broadcast using the bandwidth returned by the US military stationed in Japan. However, similar to Nihon Educational Television (NET TV), which was also a private educational television station, Tokyo Channel 12 faced a serious business crisis after its launch due to low ratings. Nikkei, Inc. took over the operation of Tokyo Channel 12 in 1969 and officially converted it into a comprehensive television station in 1973. In 1981, Tokyo Channel 12 was renamed TV Tokyo.

==History==
On July 2, 1960, the Japan Science and Technology Promotion Foundation applied to the Ministry of Post for a television broadcast license for the VHF12 channel returned by the U.S. military stationed in Japan. As part of the license application, the majority of programs were set to be science and technology education programs; the rest were to be general education and news programs. However, after this decision was issued, three other companies participating in the bidding, including Central Educational Broadcasting, raised objections to the Postmaster General, and the debate was not concluded until 1969.

=== 1960s ===
After the Science and Technology Promotion Foundation obtained the broadcasting license, it immediately invited Kurata, the then president of Hitachi Production Co., Ltd., to serve as the head of the television business headquarters and began preparations for the launch. At noon on April 12, 1964, Tokyo Channel 12 officially launched (broadcasting as ); the first program broadcast was the special program &quot;The Birth of Tokyo Channel 12&quot;, and the NHK Symphony Orchestra concert, the 90-minute TV series &quot;The Shore of Sorrow&quot; and variety shows such as &quot;Good Night 21st Century&quot; were broadcast. On the first day of broadcast, Tokyo Channel 12&#x27;s average full-day ratings were 2.1%, and the average prime-time ratings were 3.4%. When Tokyo Channel 12 was launched, its main programs were mainly industrial high school lectures, supplemented by news, social education, TV dramas, foreign movies and other programs. During the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Tokyo Channel 12 set aside all programs other than higher education for Olympic broadcasts, with the longest broadcast time among the flagship stations.

However, due to the extremely low ratings of Tokyo Channel 12’s educational programs (in the first year of its launch, the average daily ratings of Tokyo Channel 12 were only 1% and only 2% during prime time). as well as the Japanese economy being in a securities recession at the time, Tokyo Channel 12 fell into serious operating difficulties after it started broadcasting. In the first year of broadcasting, it recorded a deficit of 1.38 billion yen. In 1966, Tokyo Channel 12 decided to shorten daily broadcasting to five hours and thirty minutes, and attempts are made to rebuild by requesting donations from powerful financial companies, laying off employees, and suspending advertising business activities. However, Tokyo Channel 12 planned to lay off 200 people. This triggered a strong backlash from the labor union and led to a four-year dispute between the two. In 1967, Tokyo Channel 12 changed its reconstruction plan again, extending the daily broadcast time to 8 hours and 10 minutes, and requesting companies in the financial sector to donate funds for reconstruction and restart advertising activities. At the same time, four other private TV stations in Tokyo and NHK also formed the &quot;Science TV Coordination Committee&quot; to assist in the reconstruction of Tokyo Channel 12 and provide broadcasting parts Program. These measures halved the accumulated losses of Tokyo Channel 12 to approximately 1.743 billion yen in 1967. On March 28, 1968, Tokyo Channel 12 began broadcasting color programs.

As the operating conditions of Tokyo Channel 12 were in trouble again in 1968, the Science and Technology Promotion Foundation decided to abandon the previous method of soliciting donations from the financial sector and instead invited the financial sector to inject capital to rebuild the television department. On July 1 of the same year, twenty companies in the Japanese financial circle, including Mainichi Broadcasting, Hitachi Manufacturing Co., Ltd., and Nissan Motor, invested in the establishment of Tokyo Channel 12 Production Company (Tokyo Twelve Channel Co., Ltd.) with a capital of 1 billion yen. The Science and Technology Promotion Foundation has the television broadcasting license and facility management rights, while Tokyo Channel 12 Production is responsible for program arrangement and production, and advertising business. As Mainichi Broadcasting invested in the establishment of Tokyo Channel 12 Production Company, a network relationship was actually formed between Tokyo Channel 12 and Mainichi Broadcasting System during this period. Some programs of Tokyo Channel 12 were broadcast in Kinki through Mainichi Broadcasting. In 1969, Tokyo Channel 12 Production once again increased its capital by 1 billion yen, of which Nihon Keizai Shimbun invested 600 million yen, becoming the largest shareholder of Tokyo Channel 12 Production.

=== 1970s ===
In 1970, Tokyo Channel 12 achieved 100% colorization of evening prime-time programs and achieved profitability for the first time in the same year through business activities. On October 24, 1973, Tokyo Channel 12 Production Co., Ltd. changed its company name to Tokyo Channel 12 Co., Ltd. (Tokyo 12 Channel Co., Ltd.), officially taking over the operation of Tokyo Channel 12 from the Science and Technology Promotion Foundation. On November 1 of the same year, as the Ministry of Post and Post abolished the educational television license in the Keihin area, Tokyo Channel 12 was officially transformed into a comprehensive television station, and the program broadcast ratio was changed to 20% of educational programs, 30% of educational programs, and other programs 50%. In March 1975, due to Mainichi Broadcasting joining JNN, Tokyo Channel 12 terminated its relationship with Mainichi Broadcasting Network and strengthened cooperation with Kinki local independent stations SUN TV and Kinki Broadcasting.

In 1969, the &quot;Nikkei&quot; and MBS signed a memorandum of understanding which stipulated that Tokyo Channel 12 should share programs with Nihon Educational Television (NET, now TV Asahi), this arrangement lasted until 1975.

In October 1977 Tokyo Channel 12 Production was renamed ; and shortened the channel&#x27;s name to , dropping &quot;Science TV&quot; from its name. At the same time, the station moved to Shiba Park. A month later, it became a general-purpose TV station along with NET. On April 1, 1978, Tokyo launched a new production company, Softx.

=== 1980s ===
In 1981, it was again renamed, this time to Television Tokyo Channel 12, Ltd. d/b/a TV Tokyo; the current Japanese name of the company was also assumed in the same year.

In 1983, TV Tokyo formed the Mega TON Network (now TX Network) with TV Osaka, and Aichi Television Broadcasting. The company shifted its head offices from Shiba Park to Toranomon in December 1985. 

=== 1990s to present ===
On October 4, 1999, Tokyo&#x27;s production company Softx was renamed TV Tokyo MediaNet. In 2004, TV Tokyo MediaNet was shortened to MediaNet. On June 25, 2004, the company assumed its current English name TV Tokyo Corporation. After the digital transition, the channel began broadcasting on digital channel 7. On November 7, 2016, TV Tokyo moved its headquarters to the new building at Sumitomo Fudosan Roppongi Grand Tower from its old studios in Toranomon. The network initially used a Circle 7-style logo to broadcast animated programs. The station mascot is a cartoon banana with eyes, a nose, and a mouth which is bent into a 7, named Nanana ().

The network is part of the Japan Consortium, which covers the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup.

<text>Newnham College is a women&#x27;s constituent college of the University of Cambridge.

The college was founded in 1871 by a group organising Lectures for Ladies, members of which included philosopher Henry Sidgwick and suffragist campaigner Millicent Garrett Fawcett. It was the second women&#x27;s college to be founded at Cambridge, following Girton College. The College celebrated its 150th anniversary throughout 2021 and 2022.

==History==
The history of Newnham begins with the formation of the Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women in Cambridge in 1869. The progress of women at Cambridge University owes much to the pioneering work undertaken by the philosopher Henry Sidgwick, fellow of Trinity. Lectures for Ladies had been started in Cambridge in 1869, and such was the demand from those who could not travel in and out on a daily basis that in 1871 Sidgwick, one of the organisers of the lectures, rented a house at 74, Regent Street (Cambridge) to house five female students who wished to attend lectures but did not live near enough to the University to do so. He persuaded Anne Clough, who had previously run a school in the Lake District, to take charge of this house. The following year (1872), Clough moved to Merton House (built c. 1800) on Queen&#x27;s Road, then to premises in Bateman Street. Clough eventually became president of the college.

Demand continued to increase and the supporters of the enterprise formed a limited company to raise funds, lease land and build on it. in 1875 the first building for Newnham College was built on the site off Sidgwick Avenue where the college remains. In 1876 Henry Sidgwick married Eleanor Mildred Balfour who was already a supporter of women&#x27;s education. They lived at Newnham for two periods during the 1880s and 1890s.

The college formally came into existence in 1880 with the amalgamation of the Association and the Company. Women were allowed to sit University examinations as of right from 1881; their results were recorded in separate class-lists. Its name has occasionally been spelt phonetically as Newham College.

The demand from prospective students remained buoyant and the Newnham Hall Company built steadily, providing three more halls, a laboratory and a library, in the years up to the First World War. The architect Basil Champneys was employed throughout this period and designed the buildings in the Queen Anne style to much acclaim, giving the main college buildings an extraordinary unity. These and later buildings are grouped around beautiful gardens, which many visitors to Cambridge never discover, and, unlike most Cambridge colleges, students may walk on the grass for most of the year.

Many young women in mid-19th-century England had no access to the kind of formal secondary schooling which would have enabled them to go straight into the same university courses as the young men – the first principal herself had never been a pupil in a school. So Newnham&#x27;s founders allowed the young women to work at and to a level which suited their attainments and abilities. Some of them, with an extra year&#x27;s preparation, did indeed go on to degree-level work. And as girls&#x27; secondary schools were founded in the last quarter of the 19th century, staffed often by those who had been to the women&#x27;s colleges of Cambridge, Oxford and London, the situation began to change. In 1890 the Newnham student Philippa Fawcett was ranked above the Senior Wrangler, i.e. top in the Mathematical Tripos. By the First World War the vast majority of Newnham students were going straight into degree-level courses.

A new Pfeiffer Building was built in 1893, largely funded by £5,000 from a bequest by the poet Emily Jane Pfeiffer to support the education of women.
In tailoring the curriculum to the students, Newnham found itself at odds with the other Cambridge college for women, Girton, founded two years earlier. Emily Davies, Girton&#x27;s founder, believed passionately that equality could only be expressed by women doing the same courses as the men, on the same time-table. This meant that Girton attracted a much smaller intake in its early years. But the Newnham Council held its ground, reinforced by the commitment of many of its members to educational reform generally and a wish to change some of the courses Cambridge was offering to its men.

In 1948 Newnham, like Girton, attained the full status of a college of the university.

==Women in the university==

The university as an institution at first took no notice of these women and arrangements to sit examinations had to be negotiated with each examiner individually. In 1868 Cambridge&#x27;s Local Examinations Board (governing non-university examinations) allowed women to take exams for the first time. Concrete change within the university would have to wait until the first female colleges were formed, and following the foundation of Girton College (1869) and Newnham (1871) women were allowed into lectures, albeit at the discretion of the lecturer. By 1881, however, a general permission to sit examinations was negotiated.

A first attempt to secure for the women the titles and privileges of their degrees, not just a certificate from their colleges, was rebuffed in 1887 and a second try in 1897 went down to even more spectacular defeat. Undergraduates demonstrating against the women and their supporters did hundreds of pounds&#x27; worth of damage in the Market Square.

The First World War brought a catastrophic collapse of fee income for the men&#x27;s colleges and Cambridge and Oxford both sought state financial help for the first time. This was the context in which the women tried once more to secure inclusion, this time asking not only for the titles of degrees but also for the privileges and involvement in university government that possession of degrees proper would bring. In Oxford this was secured in 1920 but in Cambridge the women went down to defeat again in 1921, having to settle for the titles – the much-joked-about BA tit – but not the substance of degrees. This time the male undergraduates celebrating victory over the women used a handcart as a battering ram to destroy the lower half of the bronze gates at Newnham, a memorial to Anne Clough.

The women spent the inter-war years trapped on the threshold of the university. They could hold university posts but they could not speak or vote in the affairs of their own departments or of the university as a whole. Finally, in 1948 the women were admitted to full membership of the university, although the university still retained powers to limit their numbers.
National university expansion after the Second World War brought further change. In 1954, a third women&#x27;s college, New Hall, (now Murray Edwards College), was founded. In 1965 the first mixed graduate college, Darwin College, was founded. The 1970s saw three men&#x27;s colleges (Churchill, Clare and King&#x27;s) admit women for the first time. Gradually Cambridge was ceasing to be &quot;a men&#x27;s university although of a mixed type&quot;, as it had been described in the 1920s in a memorably confused phrase. Cambridge now has no all-male colleges and Girton is also mixed. Newnham and Murray Edwards retain all-female student bodies, whilst Lucy Cavendish College started admitting men in 2021.

With the conversion of the last men-only colleges into mixed colleges in the 1970s and &#x27;80s, there were inevitably questions about whether any of the remaining women-only colleges would also change to mixed colleges. The issue again became prominent as women-only colleges throughout the rest of the country began admitting men, and following the 2007 announcement that Oxford University&#x27;s last remaining women-only college, St Hilda&#x27;s, would admit men, Cambridge is the only university in the United Kingdom where colleges have admissions policies that discriminate on the basis of gender.

==College arms==
&quot;Argent, on a chevron azure between in chief two crosses botonny fitchy and in base a mullet sable, a griffin&#x27;s head erased or between two mascles of the field.&quot;

These arms, granted in 1923, were designed by the Revd Edward Earle Dorling to incorporate charges from the arms of those intimately connected with the founding of the college.

In the early years of the college Anne Clough was the Principal. She was a member of the landed gentry family of Clough of Plas Clough, Denbighshire, whose arms are blazoned &quot;Azure, between three mascles a greyhound&#x27;s head couped argent&quot;. The out-students were under the care of Marion Kennedy. Her arms were &quot;Argent, a chevron gules between in chief two crosses botonny fitchy sable and in base a boar&#x27;s head couped sable langued gules&quot; – slightly differing from the arms of Kennedy of Kirkmichael, which has crosses crosslet fitchy.

The other great benefactors of the college were Henry Sidgwick and Eleanor Mildred Balfour, who married in 1876. Mrs Sidgwick was Vice-Principal of one of the College&#x27;s Halls, later becoming Principal of the College in 1892. Their arms were – Sidgwick (assumed arms): Gules, a fess between three griffins&#x27; heads erased or; and Balfour (of Balbirnie): Argent, on a chevron engrailed between three mullets sable an otter&#x27;s head erased argent.

In the college arms the chevron links them with the coats of Balfour and Kennedy, while its colour and the mascles refer to Clough. The crosses come from Kennedy, the mullet from Balfour, and the griffin&#x27;s head from Sidgwick. No crest was granted, for although a corporate body may have a crest, it was thought that a crest and helm would be inappropriate to one composed entirely of women.

==College life==


Basil Champneys designed what was popularly said to be &quot;the second-longest continuous indoor corridor in Europe&quot; in order to prevent the women of the college stepping outside in the rain. The laboratory, which can be found near the sports field, now houses a space which hosts a range of cultural events, such as theatre productions, music recitals and art exhibitions.

Alongside a formal hall, there is also a modern buttery in which to eat and relax. The College is also home to the Grade II* listed 1897 Yates Thompson Library and the Horner Markwick building. The library was originally Newnham students&#x27; primary reference source since women were not allowed into the University Library. The library was built with a gift from Henry Yates Thompson and his wife, Elizabeth. It remains one of the largest college libraries in Cambridge with a collection of 100,000 volumes, including approximately 6,000 rare books.

The college has two official combination rooms that represent the interests of students in the college and are responsible for social aspects of college life. Undergraduates are members of the Junior Combination Room (JCR), whilst graduate students are members of the Middle Combination Room (MCR).

Newnham has many societies of its own including clubs for rowing, football, netball, tennis, and many other sports, as well as several choirs. As Newnham is a non-denominational foundation, it does not have its own chapel. Choral scholars at Newnham form part of Selwyn College&#x27;s chapel choir. Newnham College Boat Club was the university&#x27;s first women&#x27;s boat club.

<text>Baron Plunket, of Newtown in the County of Cork, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1827 for the prominent Irish lawyer and Whig politician William Plunket. He served as Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1830 and 1834 and again from 1835 to 1841. His eldest son, the second Baron, was Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry between 1839 and 1866. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baron. He was a barrister. His eldest son, the fourth Baron, served as Archbishop of Dublin between 1884 and 1897. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fifth Baron. He was a diplomat and held office as Governor of New Zealand between 1904 and 1910. His grandson, Patrick, the seventh Baron, was Equerry to both King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Robin who died in 2013 and was in turn succeeded by his nephew, Tyrone who was a Page of Honour to Queen Elizabeth II.
Two other members of the family have also gained distinction. The Hon. David Plunket, the second son of the third Baron, was a Conservative politician and was created Baron Rathmore in 1895. The Most Reverend the Hon. Benjamin Plunket, the second son of the fourth Baron, was Bishop of Meath from 1919 to 1925.

The seventh and eighth barons were related to the Marquesses of Londonderry. Their mother, the wife of the sixth baron, was the illegitimate daughter of the actress Fannie Ward and The 7th Marquess of Londonderry. After the sixth baron and his wife were killed in an air accident in 1938, the three Plunket brothers were raised by an aunt and uncle.

<text>Turlough Hill (), also known as Tomaneena (), is a mountain in County Wicklow in Ireland and site of Ireland&#x27;s only pumped-storage hydroelectricity plant. The power station is owned and operated by the ESB and can generate up to of electricity at times of peak demand.

==The mountain==
The historian Liam Price recorded that the mountain was known locally as Tomaneena; Turlough Hill is the name given to it by the ESB when they surveyed the site for the pumped-storage scheme. It is high and is the 136th highest summit in Ireland. The summit is located to the south-west of the upper reservoir and is easily reached via the tarmac access road that begins at the top of the Wicklow Gap. It is also possible to reach the summit from Glendalough or from the summits of neighbouring Camaderry and Conavalla mountains.

The underlying geology of the mountain is granite, covered with blanket bog, which is a habitat for heather, purple moor grass and moss. A number of alpine plants grow near the summit: dwarf willow, cowberry, crowberry, fir clubmoss and common bilberry. To the north-east of the summit, at the head of Glendasan valley, is Lough Nahanagan (), a corrie lake carved by a glacier at the end of the last ice age.
==The pumped-storage scheme==
The Turlough Hill Power Station is owned and operated by the Electricity Supply Board (ESB). Construction commenced in 1968, and the station became fully operational in 1974.

== Name ==
Whilst the original name is Tomaneena, renaming it ‘Turlough Hill’ has a certain validity. The pumped storage station draws water from the mountain top lake, which thus becomes a ‘dry lake’. There is a geological feature known as a Turlough; it is defined as &quot;(in Ireland) a low-lying area on limestone which becomes flooded in wet weather through the welling up of groundwater from the rock.
Origin late 17th cent.: from Irish &quot;turloch&quot;, from &quot;tur ‘dry’&quot; + &quot;loch ‘lake’.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="498120" wikidata="Q741880" url="?curid=498120" title="Homerton College, Cambridge">
<text>Homerton College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. Its first premises were acquired in Homerton, London in 1768, by an informal gathering of Protestant dissenters with origins in the seventeenth century. In 1894, the college moved from Homerton High Street, Hackney, London, to Cambridge. Homerton was admitted as an &quot;Approved Society&quot; of the university in 1976, and received its Royal charter in 2010, affirming its status as a full college of the university. The college celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2018.

With around 600 undergraduates, 750 postgraduates, and 90 fellows, it has more students than any other Cambridge college but, because only half of those are resident undergraduates, its undergraduate presence is similar to large colleges such as Trinity and St John&#x27;s. The college has particularly strong ties to public service, as well as academia, having educated many prominent dissenting thinkers, educationalists, politicians, and missionary explorers.

The college has extensive grounds which encompass sports fields, water features and beehives, and the focal point of the college, its Victorian Gothic hall. It also has a wide range of student clubs and societies, including Homerton College Boat Club, Homerton College Music Society and the Homerton College Rugby Football Club.

==History==

===Early history===

The college&#x27;s origins date back to the seventeenth century. In 1695, a Congregation Fund was created in London to educate Calvinist ministers. As non-conformists, they were barred by law from attending Oxbridge colleges, and so studied a modern curriculum, with particular emphasis on philosophy, science, and modern history. In 1730, a formal society – known as the King&#x27;s Head Society after the pub at the Royal Exchange where they held their meetings – was founded to sponsor young men to attend dissenting academies. Today, a secret society and discussion club at the college of the same name maintains some of its traditions. By 1768, the Society was large enough to need its own premises, so it purchased a large property in Homerton High Street, in London&#x27;s East End.

By 1817, the institution had become known as &quot;Homerton Academy Society&quot;, later &quot;Homerton College Society&quot;. At that time, it produced some of the nation&#x27;s foremost dissenting figures, many closely involved in the movements opposed to the slave trade and the Corn Laws. For several years, the college was affiliated to the University of London, but when its theological function was moved to New College London in 1850, it was re-founded by the Congregational Board of Education to concentrate on the study of education itself. It did so by transferring its theological courses to New College London, of which the Rev. John Harris DD was the Congregationalist Principal, and by extending and rebuilding the old mansion house and 1820s buildings of the academy, at a cost of £10,000. The college reopened in April 1852 as the Training Institution of the Congregational Board of Education, with Samuel Morley as its treasurer. Shortly afterwards, it began admitting women students. Then Principal John Horobin called an end to mixed education in 1896, shortly after the move to Cambridge, and the college remained all-women for 80 years thereafter.

Towards the end of the century, the growth of industry had turned the village of Homerton into a manufacturing centre, lowering the quality of life of the students and, between 1878 and 1885, there were seven deaths from tuberculosis, smallpox and typhoid. At the same time, increasing numbers of students required more space.

In 1881, former students of Homerton College who were members of Glyn Cricket Club formed a football section to help keep their players fit during the winter months. The football section continued to grow over the ensuing years and is now Leyton Orient Football Club – a fact acknowledged by an annual match between the college&#x27;s football team and that of the Leyton Orient Supporters Club.

===Move to Cambridge===
In 1894, the Congregational Board of Education were able to purchase the estate of Cavendish College, Cambridge (named after the then-Chancellor of the university and not to be confused with Lucy Cavendish College) which had become available. It had been founded to allow poorer students to sit Cambridge tripos exams without the expense of joining a true Cambridge college. It was briefly recognised as a &quot;Public Hostel&quot; of the university in 1882, but a lack of money had brought the venture to an end.

All its estates and furniture were bought for £10,000 by the Congregational Board, and students and staff moved from the old Hackney premises into the vacant college buildings at Cambridge. Initially taking the name of Homerton New College at Cavendish College, it shortly afterwards became just Homerton College, Cambridge. John Charles Horobin became the first Principal: his portrait hangs in the college&#x27;s Great Hall.

The first woman to head the college was Mary Miller Allan, who was responsible for Homerton&#x27;s national reputation as a trainer of women teachers. Her successor in 1935 was Miss Alice Skillicorn, a former HMI, who took the college through World War Two, during which time it was bombed. Dame Beryl Paston Brown was Principal in the 1960s, at a time when Homerton&#x27;s numbers doubled after the introduction of three-year training courses in 1960.

In December 1976, under the headship of Principal Alison Cheveley Shrubsole, Homerton was accepted as an Approved Society of the University of Cambridge following a 3–1 vote of the Regent House in favour of its admission. The possibility of introducing a Cambridge Bachelor of Education (BEd) degree had been given as one of the reasons for the original move into Cambridge. It was after the shake-up and governmental criticisms of teacher training in the early 1970s that the university admitted Homerton because, by then, all of its students were doing four-year honours courses.

In late 2000, the Regent House approved a proposal to &quot;converge&quot; Homerton with the rest of the university. Convergence involved the transfer of most of the college&#x27;s teaching and research activity to the new University of Cambridge Faculty of Education and the diversification of the college into a wide range of Tripos subjects. In September 2001, Homerton admitted its first non-education Tripos students. At the same time the old BEd degree was retired in favour of a three-year B.A. in Education, followed by a one-year Post Graduate Certificate of Education.

At the time of convergence, it was envisaged that Homerton would move from the status of Approved Society to that of Approved Foundation or full college. In December 2008 Homerton&#x27;s application to move to full college status was approved by the University Council. The change in status was completed with the grant of a Royal Charter on 11 March 2010.

==Buildings and grounds==

The original Victorian Cavendish College buildings were constructed in 1876 in the Gothic Revival style, using a combination of red Suffolk brick and Bath stone dressings. One of the most notable features is an oak doorway with an ogee arch flanked above by ornamental grotesques. Several years later, the Cambridge architect William Wren designed additions to the eastern end of the college buildings in the Neo-Gothic style – now occupied by the Principal&#x27;s office. The castellated tower is the tallest part of the original college buildings, and it is possible to see the spires of Ely Cathedral on a clear day from its uppermost floor.

The Great Hall is one of the largest and grandest dining halls in Cambridge. When it was built in 1889 it was the largest college hall in Cambridge. It now houses one of the college&#x27;s most notable works of art – the celebrated Pre-Raphaelite piece by Jane Benham Hay known as &#x27;The Florentine Procession&#x27;, painted in the 1860s and winning &#x27;Picture of the Year&#x27; in the 1867 &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. Also encircling the Hall are portraits of former Principals of the college, The Hall itself features a hammer-beam roof, American walnut panelling, a gallery, rose windows, a fleche, and a bell originating from the old college in London which sounds before the College Grace is read at Formal dinner. A new dining hall was designed by Feilden Fowles and opened in 2022; Rowan Moore named it as one of his five best buildings of the year.

Other notable buildings of the college include the Ibberson Building built in 1914 (named after its architect, Herbert George Ibberson) which is considered by many – including Nikolaus Pevsner in his &quot;Buildings of England&quot; – to be the college&#x27;s most significant building; a fact mirrored by its Grade Two listed status, the only listed building on the site. An example of arts and crafts style architecture, its present-day Combination Room was probably the only grade two listed gymnasium in the world. Also of interest is Trumpington House (completed in 1847, and which once held the college&#x27;s wine collection in its basement) built in the style of classical revival and currently leased to the Faculty of Education. Additionally, there is a science education centre named in honour of Professor Emeritus John Hammond OBE, who campaigned for the college to receive its Royal Charter, being elected as an Emeritus Fellow on the same day as the grant, passing away only a few weeks later.

Like the majority of Cambridge colleges, Homerton offers on-site accommodation for its students for all three years. This is provided by four purpose-built accommodation buildings: East House, West House, South Court (the latest addition to the college, opened in 2007), and Harrison House. Harrison House exclusively houses graduate students and fellows, and was opened in November 2006. Harrison House is named after Sir David Harrison. Other accommodation is provided in the ABC and D&amp;E blocks, both part of the main college buildings, as well as in Queen&#x27;s Wing (opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in 1957) which also contains the Homerton Union of Students and both the Undergraduate and Graduate Common Rooms. 

Outside of university terms, the accommodation attracts extensive use for conference purposes. 
Like the other colleges of the university, Homerton&#x27;s library includes thousands of books covering numerous academic disciplines. Unique to Homerton, however, is a children&#x27;s book collection, which contains early editions of many famous books from 1780 onwards.

Homerton has more green space around its buildings than many other Cambridge colleges. In its grounds are several rare examples of wild orchids and over 150 species of plants, which act as a rich habitat for various forms of wildlife – including grey squirrels, carrion crows, woodpeckers, stock doves, rabbits, the &#x27;College fox&#x27;, and in the summer a small colony of swifts, which nest under the eaves of the roof of the Cavendish building after their return from Africa. There is also a large orchard, where students relax in warm weather.

==Student life==
===Traditions===

Homerton has several unique traditions. At its Matriculation Dinner new undergraduates are made to form two lines and drink wine from the &#x27;Homerton Horn&#x27; – an African cow horn with silver mounts, whilst speaking several Anglo-Saxon phrases to one another (including the greeting &quot;Wassail!&quot;, and the response &quot;Frith and Freondship sae th&#x27;y&#x27;&quot; – &#x27;peace and friendship be with you&#x27;). In recent years, the tradition has been adapted so that undergraduates say these Anglo-Saxon phrases to the person sat across from them on the table, and take subsequent drinks from their own glasses, rather than every undergraduate drinking from the ceremonial horn, which has historically resulted in epidemics of &#x27;Freshers Flu&#x27;.

Because the college was all-female for much of its history, the design of the college gown is that of those traditionally worn by female undergraduates in early twentieth century Cambridge (this is shared by all the historically-female colleges: Girton, Newnham, and Murray Edwards). The gown is based on the original Cambridge black gown, still worn by undergraduates at Peterhouse, but has the slits in the sleeves closed up. As a homage to its all-female origins, or simply because the college has never had one re-designed, this gown is now worn by all undergraduates at the college regardless of sex.

=== Homerton Union of Students ===
The Homerton Union of Students is one of the most active student unions in the university. The President - the only paid, sabbatical Presidency of all the Cambridge colleges - manages, along with a Vice-President Internal and a Vice President External, a team of students on the executive committee and a team of &#x27;Liberation officers&#x27;. Together, they organise &#x27;Freshers Week&#x27;. Homerton&#x27;s Fresher&#x27;s week is longer than in most colleges, where students only have two to three days of &#x27;Freshers week&#x27; before the start of term. They also organise events throughout the year for students, as well as offer pastoral support.

From 2015 until 2020 the HUS organized an annual and immensely popular Harry Potter Formal Hall, at which students and staff would dress as characters from the books, sketches would be acted, and live owls were brought in for entertainment. Formal halls were suspended in 2021 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, but returned in 2022. Homerton&#x27;s Harry Potter Formal Halls were discontinued in 2023 when an incoming HUS president allegedly objected to their connection with J. K. Rowling and her gender critical views.

===May Ball===
The college holds an annual May Ball in Cambridge. In 2018, the ball was attended by over 1500 guests, the largest ever hosted on Homerton&#x27;s grounds, to celebrate the college&#x27;s 250th anniversary.

===Homerton Charter Choir===
The college&#x27;s Charter Choir sing evensong every Tuesday and is formed of choral scholars and volunteers from the college and the wider community. The choir tours abroad once a year, recently travelling to Portsmouth, Gibraltar and Iceland. The choir is directed by Daniel Trocmé-Latter, the Music Director of Studies at the college. 

===Boat Club===
Homerton College Boat Club (HCBC) is the rowing club of the college. HCBC colours are navy blue with white trim, although the club&#x27;s Zephyr (garment) is white with blue trim. The blade colour is white with a single blue (RAL-290-20-30) vertical stripe. It is traditional to wear a sock of each of the boat club&#x27;s colours when racing with a blue sock on the foot opposite the rigger.

The Men&#x27;s 1st VIII hold the Oxbridge record for the most places advanced during one series of bumps (either Mays, Lents, or Torpids/Eights for Oxford), advancing 13 places in the May Bumps 2001, where the crew moved up a division to division 3 and also won blades.

=== Widening participation ===
In 2022, Homerton made offers to five students, who are among more than 50 candidates from backgrounds of educational disadvantage to be offered a place on the University of Cambridge’s first-ever pre-degree foundation year.

== People associated with Homerton ==
Principals, treasurers, fellows (including honorary fellows) or students who studied at Homerton Academy or Homerton College before and after it officially became part of Cambridge University. Graduates of the college are collectively known as &quot;Homertonians&quot;.

<text>Tassilo, Baron von Heydebrand und der Lasa (known in English as Baron von der Lasa; 17 October 1818 – 27 July 1899) was a German chess master, chess historian and theoretician of the nineteenth century, a member of the Berlin Chess Club and a founder of the Berlin Chess School (the Berlin Pleiades).

==Name==
His name is usually abbreviated as &quot;von der Lasa&quot;, as this is how he signed his letters. However both contemporary and more recent writers have used other abbreviations, such as &quot;von Heydebrandt&quot; (which is a misspelling) and &quot;Der Lasa&quot;. The Prussian King (later Emperor) William I made a joke out of the confusion by saying, &quot;Good morning, dear Heydebrand. What is von der Lasa doing?&quot;

==Biography==
Von der Lasa was born 17 October 1818 in Berlin. He studied law in Bonn and Berlin. From 1845 he was a diplomat in the service of Prussia. His career took him to Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Rio de Janeiro, among other places. He retired from the diplomatic service in 1864, and thereafter devoted himself to the world of chess.

He played several matches and defeated the strongest masters in the period 1843–1853. He won against Henry Thomas Buckle 2-1 (1843), Adolf Anderssen 4-2 (1845), Johann Löwenthal 6-1 (1846), John William Schulten 4-1 (1850), Anderssen 10-5 (1851), and Howard Staunton 7-6 (1853).

To the modern chess world he is known above all as the main author of the &quot;Handbuch des Schachspiels&quot; (first published in 1843). His friend Paul Rudolf von Bilguer, responsible for the original plan, had died in 1840, with the work still in the early stages. Von der Lasa took over, and, in a noble gesture of friendship, put his friend&#x27;s name as author. In later editions of the &quot;Handbuch&quot;, in German commonly called &quot;der Bilguer&quot;, von der Lasa was named as co-author.

In 1850 von der Lasa published in the &quot;Deutsche Schachzeitung&quot; (&quot;German Chess Magazine&quot;) a call for an international chess tournament, the first ever, to be held in Trier. Instead the first such tournament was held in 1851 in London. Von der Lasa did not play in tournaments, being usually busy as an organizer, but played well in off-hand games against such leading masters as Howard Staunton and Adolf Anderssen. He was also a renowned chess investigator and theoretician, publishing numerous articles in the &quot;German Chess Magazine&quot; and, in 1897, his great work &quot;Zur Geschichte und Literatur des Schachspiels, Forschungen&quot; (&quot;Researches in the History and Literature of Chess&quot;). In the course of his researches he traveled extensively (including a trip around the world in 1887–88) and accumulated a comprehensive chess library, to which he published a catalog in 1896. In 1898 the German Chess Federation saluted his tireless efforts and accomplishments by conferring on him its first honorary membership.

One of von der Lasa&#x27;s last services was to encourage H. J. R. Murray to pursue further researches into the early history of chess. Von der Lasa died on 27 July 1899 in Storchnest bei Lissa, Posen (then in Prussia, now Osieczna in Poland). His library is still intact at Kórnik Castle near Poznań.

<text>Inward light, Light of God, Light of Christ, Christ within, That of God, Spirit of God within us, Light within, and inner light are related phrases commonly used within the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) as metaphors for Christ&#x27;s light shining on or in them. It was propagated by the founder of the Quaker movement, George Fox, who &quot;preached faith in and reliance on &#x27;inward light&#x27; (the presence of Christ in the heart)&quot;. The first Quakers were known to sit in silence and meditate on the words of the Bible until they felt the inward light of God shining upon them and the Holy Spirit speaking. The concept was highly important to early Quakers, who taught: &quot;God reveals Himself within each individual&#x27;s conscience and consciousness by the Holy Spirit, Christ Himself being the Light to illuminate man&#x27;s sinfulness and lead in the way of truth and righteousness. ... this light is in all men by the grace of God to lead them to Christ, and that the same light will give daily guidance to the Christian.&quot;

&quot;The Key to the Faith and Practice of the Religious Society of Friends&quot; states that the Inward Light is &quot;both the historical, living Jesus, and as the Grace of God extended to people that simultaneously makes us conscious of our sins, forgives them, and gives us the strength and the will to overcome them&quot; and &quot;teaches us the difference between right and wrong, truth and falseness, good and evil&quot;. As such, the word &quot;light&quot; is commonly used by Christians (including Quakers) as a metaphor for Christ, derived from many Biblical passages including , which states:

Quakers take this idea of walking in the Light of Christ to refer to God&#x27;s presence within a person, and to a direct and personal experience of God, although this varies to some extent between Quakers in different yearly meetings. Quakers believe not only that individuals can be guided by this light, but that Friends might meet together and receive collective guidance from God by sharing the concerns and leadings that he gives to individuals. This is often done in meeting for worship; Pierre Lacout, a Swiss Quaker, describes a &quot;silence which is active&quot; causing the Inner Light to &quot;glow&quot;, in his book &quot;God is silence&quot;. In a Friends meeting it is usually called &quot;ministry&quot; when a person shares aloud what the Inward Light is saying to him or her, which is revealed &quot;by the direct prompting of Christ through his Holy Spirit.&quot; The term &quot;inward light&quot; was first used by early Friends to refer to Christ&#x27;s light shining on them; the term &quot;inner light&quot; has also been used since the twentieth century to describe this Quaker doctrine. Rufus Jones, in 1904, wrote that: &quot;The Inner Light is the doctrine that there is something Divine, &#x27;Something of God&#x27; in the human soul&quot;. Jones argued that his interpretation of the Quaker doctrine of the inner light was something shared by George Fox and other early Quakers, but some Quaker theologians and historians, most notably Lewis Benson reject this viewpoint. For certain Conservative Friends, Evangelical Friends and Holiness Friends, Jones&#x27; definition represents &quot;modernistic thought&quot; rather than early Quaker teaching, which emphasizes the necessity of a personal conversion to be a child of God.&quot;

== Related terms ==
The term &quot;Inward light&quot; appears in early Quaker writings. Originally, Inward Light was used much more often than &quot;Inner Light&quot;. This term evokes an image of people being illuminated by the light of God or Christ. Although the terms are now often used interchangeably, according to Quaker historian Pink Dandelion the terms were not thought of as equivalents until Rufus Jones incorrectly used the terms as literal synonyms.

Synonyms for the Inward Light include &quot;Inner Light&quot;, &quot;Light of God&quot;, &quot;Light of Christ&quot;, &quot;Christ within&quot;, &quot;That of God&quot;, &quot;Spirit of God within us&quot;, and &quot;Light within&quot;. These are often used interchangeably by modern and arguably early Friends. Liberal Friends may identify it with the expression &quot;that of God in everyone&quot;. Conservative Friends, Evangelical Friends and Holiness Friends identify the Inward Light as &quot;the indwelling Holy Spirit as the Guide by whom the Scriptures are understood (I Cor. 2:10, 11) and the specific will of God for every man is made known (Rom. 8:14).&quot; At the same time, the Bible is &quot;the guide by which every spirit may be discerned (I Jn. 4:1-3) and every belief and practice tested (II Tim. 3:16).&quot;

== Basis ==

The Quaker belief that the Inward Light shines on each person is based in part on a passage from the New Testament, namely , which says, &quot;That was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.&quot; Early Friends took this verse as one of their mottos and often referred to themselves as &quot;Children of the Light&quot;. Moreover, Friends emphasize the part of the verse that indicates that the Light &quot;is extended to all people everywhere&quot;, even &quot;people who have never heard of Christianity in a meaningful way or at all can share in the Light, if they sincerely respond to God&#x27;s grace. &quot;For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or excuse them on the day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus&quot; (Romans 2:14–16).&quot;

The principal founder of what became the Religious Society of Friends, George Fox, claimed that he had a direct experience of God. Having explored various sects and listened to an assortment of preachers, he finally concluded that none of them were adequate to be his ultimate guide. At that point he reported hearing a voice that told him, &quot;There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition.&quot; He felt that God wanted him to teach others that they need not depend on human teachers or guides either, because each one of them could experience God directly and hear his voice within. He wrote in his journal, &quot;I was glad that I was commanded to turn people to that &quot;inward light&quot;, spirit, and grace, by which all might know their salvation, and their way to God; even that divine Spirit which would lead them into all Truth, and which I infallibly knew would never deceive any.&quot; Fox taught: that Christ, the Light, had come to teach his people himself; that &quot;people had no need of any teacher but the Light that was in all men and women&quot; (the anointing they had received); if people would be silent, waiting on God, the Light would teach them how to conduct their lives, teach them about Christ, show them the condition of their hearts; they loving the Light, it would rid them of the &quot;cause of sin&quot;; and soon after, Christ would return in his glory to establish his Kingdom in their hearts. Fox called the Light destroying sin within as the Cross of Christ, the Power of God.

Regarding this, Fox wrote, &quot;Now ye that know the power of God and are come to it—which is the Cross of Christ, that crucifies you to the state that Adam and Eve were in the fall, and so to the world—by this power of God ye come to see the state they were in before they fell, which power of God is the Cross, in which stands the everlasting glory; which brings up into the righteousness, holiness and image of God, and crucifies to the unrighteousness, unholiness and image of Satan.&quot; The Cross is no &quot;dead fact stranded on the shore of the oblivious years&quot;, but is to be a living experience deep in the heart of the believer, and changing his whole life. &quot;You that know the power and feel the power, you feel the Cross of Christ, you feel the Gospel, which is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.&quot; All real experience of the Cross must lead, he thought, to the same way of life that brought the Master there—to the way of humility and non-resistance, of overcoming evil by the sole force of love and goodness. To Fox it seemed that a high profession of Christianity often went with a way of life in flagrant opposition to this. He writes to the persecutors: &quot;Your fruits have manifested that you are not of this (wisdom from above); and so out of the power of God which is the Cross of Christ; for you are found in the world, out of the power of God, out of the Cross of Christ, persecuting.&quot;

== Contrast with other inner sources ==

Many Friends consider this divine guidance (or &quot;promptings&quot; or &quot;leadings of the Spirit&quot;) distinct both from impulses originating within oneself and from generally agreed-on moral guidelines. In fact, as Marianne McMullen pointed out, a person can be prompted to say something in meeting that is contrary to what he or she thinks. In other words, Friends do not usually consider the Inner Light the conscience or moral sensibility but something higher and deeper that informs and sometimes corrects these aspects of human nature.

== Contrast with rules and creeds ==

Historically, Friends have been suspicious of formal creeds or religious philosophy that is not grounded in one&#x27;s own experience. Instead one must be guided by the Inward Teacher, the Inner Light. This is not, however, a release for Friends to decide and do whatever they want; it is incumbent upon Friends to consider the wisdom of other Friends, as one must listen for the Inner Light of others as well as their own. Friends have various established procedures for collectively discerning and following the Spirit while making decisions.

Friends procedure is to collect together their best advice in a book of &quot;Faith and Practice&quot;, which is revised gradually over time. Many or most books of Faith and Practice contain the following, which was originally attached to a list of &quot;Advices&quot; published in 1656, and illustrates Friends&#x27; emphasis on the Inward Light:

: Dearly beloved Friends, these things we do not lay upon you as a rule or form to walk by, but that all, with the measure of light which is pure and holy, may be guided: and so in the light walking and abiding, these may be fulfilled in the Spirit, not from the letter, for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.

== In the Bible ==

Most Friends, especially in the past, have looked to the Bible as a source of doctrine, wisdom and guidance. Many, if not most of them, have considered the Bible a book inspired by God. Early Quakers, like George Fox and Robert Barclay, as well as most modern Quakers (including the Conservative Friends, Evangelical Friends, Gurneyite Friends and Holiness Friends) believed that promptings which were truly from the Holy Spirit would not contradict the Bible. They did, furthermore, believe that to correctly understand the Bible, one needed the Inward Light to clarify it and guide one in applying its teachings to current situations. 

In the United States, in the nineteenth century, Friends of the Orthodox branch concluded that a minority of those of their faith, especially those of the Liberal Friends tradition, were using the concept of the Inner Light to justify unbiblical views. These Orthodox Friends held that the revelations of the Inward Light would not be in contradiction to the teachings of the Bible: &quot;the Scriptures were foundational to Christian doctrine, and the indwelling Spirit was the immediate guide for holy living and worship.&quot; Friends remain formally, but usually respectfully, divided on the matter.

<doc id="498127" wikidata="Q494392" url="?curid=498127" title="Aldol reaction">
<text>The aldol reaction (aldol addition) is a reaction in organic chemistry that combines two carbonyl compounds (e.g. aldehydes or ketones) to form a new β-hydroxy carbonyl compound. Its simplest form might involve the nucleophilic addition of an enolized ketone to another:

These products are known as &quot;aldols&quot;, from the &quot;ald&quot;ehyde + alcoh&quot;ol&quot;, a structural motif seen in many of the products. The use of aldehyde in the name comes from its history: aldehydes are more reactive than ketones, so that the reaction was discovered first with them.

The aldol reaction is paradigmatic in organic chemistry and one of the most common means of forming carbon–carbon bonds in organic chemistry. It lends its name to the family of aldol reactions and similar techniques analyze a whole family of carbonyl α-substitution reactions, as well as the diketone condensations.

==Scope==
Aldol structural units are found in many important molecules, whether naturally occurring or synthetic. The reaction is well used on an industrial scale, notably of pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane, the plasticizer precursor 2-ethylhexanol, and the drug Lipitor (atorvastatin, calcium salt). For many of the commodity applications, the stereochemistry of the aldol reaction is unimportant, but the topic is of intense interest for the synthesis of many specialty chemicals.

===Aldol dimerization===
In its simplest implementation, base induces conversion of an aldehyde or a ketone to the aldol product. One example involves the aldol condensation of propionaldehyde:
Featuring the RCH(OH)CHR&#x27;C(O)R&quot; grouping, the product is an aldol. In this case . Such reactions are called aldol aldol dimerization.

===Cross-aldol===
With a mixture of carbonyl precursors, complicated mixtures can occur. Addition of base to a mixture of propionaldehyde and acetaldehyde, one obtains four products:
The first two products are the result of aldol dimerization but the latter two result from a crossed aldol reaction. Complicated mixtures from cross aldol reactions can be avoided by using one component that cannot form an enolate, examples being formaldehyde and benzaldehyde. This approach is used in one stage in the production of trimethylolethane, which entails crossed aldol condensation of butyraldehyde and formaldehyde:

===Reactions of aldols===
Aldols dehydrate:
Because this conversion is facile, it is sometimes assumed. It is for this reason that the aldol reaction is sometimes called the aldol condensation.

==Mechanisms==

The aldol reaction has one underlying mechanism: a carbanion-like nucleophile attacks a carbonyl center.

If the base is of only moderate strength such as hydroxide ion or an alkoxide, the aldol reaction occurs via nucleophilic attack by the resonance-stabilized enolate on the carbonyl group of another molecule. The product is the alkoxide salt of the aldol product. The aldol itself is then formed, and it may then undergo dehydration to give the unsaturated carbonyl compound. The scheme shows a simple mechanism for the base-catalyzed aldol reaction of an aldehyde with itself.

Although only a catalytic amount of base is required in some cases, the more usual procedure is to use a stoichiometric amount of a strong base such as LDA or NaHMDS. In this case, enolate formation is irreversible, and the aldol product is not formed until the metal alkoxide of the aldol product is protonated in a separate workup step.

When an acid catalyst is used, the initial step in the reaction mechanism involves acid-catalyzed tautomerization of the carbonyl compound to the enol. The acid also serves to activate the carbonyl group of &quot;another molecule&quot; by protonation, rendering it highly electrophilic. The enol is nucleophilic at the α-carbon, allowing it to attack the protonated carbonyl compound, leading to the aldol after deprotonation. Some may also dehydrate past the intended product to give the unsaturated carbonyl compound through aldol condensation.

==Crossed-aldol reactant control==

Despite the attractiveness of the aldol manifold, there are several problems that need to be addressed to render the process effective. The first problem is a thermodynamic one: most aldol reactions are reversible. Furthermore, the equilibrium is also just barely on the side of the products in the case of simple aldehyde–ketone aldol reactions. If the conditions are particularly harsh (e.g.: NaOMe/MeOH/reflux), condensation may occur, but this can usually be avoided with mild reagents and low temperatures (e.g., LDA (a strong base), THF, −78 °C). Although the aldol addition usually proceeds to near completion under irreversible conditions, the isolated aldol adducts are sensitive to base-induced retro-aldol cleavage to return starting materials. In contrast, retro-aldol condensations are rare, but possible. This is the basis of the catalytic strategy of class I aldolases in nature, as well as numerous small-molecule amine catalysts.

When a mixture of unsymmetrical ketones are reacted, four crossed-aldol (addition) products can be anticipated: Thus, if one wishes to obtain only one of the cross-products, one must control which carbonyl becomes the nucleophilic enol/enolate and which remains in its electrophilic carbonyl form.

The simplest control is if only one of the reactants has acidic protons, and only this molecule forms the enolate. For example, the addition of diethyl malonate into benzaldehyde produces only one product: 

If one group is considerably more acidic than the other, the most acidic proton is abstracted by the base and an enolate is formed at that carbonyl while the less-acidic carbonyl remains electrophilic. This type of control works only if the difference in acidity is large enough and base is the limiting reactant. A typical substrate for this situation is when the deprotonatable position is activated by more than one carbonyl-like group. Common examples include a CH2 group flanked by two carbonyls or nitriles (see for example the Knoevenagel condensation and the first steps of the malonic ester synthesis and acetoacetic ester synthesis).

Otherwise, the most acidic carbonyls are typically also the most active electrophiles: first aldehydes, then ketones, then esters, and finally amides. Thus cross-aldehyde reactions are typically most challenging because they can polymerize easily or react unselectively to give a statistical mixture of products.

One common solution is to form the enolate of one partner first, and then add the other partner under kinetic control. Kinetic control means that the forward aldol addition reaction must be significantly faster than the reverse retro-aldol reaction. For this approach to succeed, two other conditions must also be satisfied; it must be possible to quantitatively form the enolate of one partner, and the forward aldol reaction must be significantly faster than the transfer of the enolate from one partner to another. Common kinetic control conditions involve the formation of the enolate of a ketone with LDA at −78 °C, followed by the slow addition of an aldehyde.

== Stereoselectivity ==
The aldol reaction unites two relatively simple molecules into a more complex one. Increased complexity arises because each end of the new bond may become a stereocenter. Modern methodology has not only developed high-yielding aldol reactions, but also completely controls both the relative and absolute configuration of these new stereocenters.

To describe relative stereochemistry at the α- and β-carbon, older papers use saccharide chemistry&#x27;s &quot;erythro/threo&quot; nomenclature; more modern papers use the following &quot;syn&quot;/&quot;anti&quot; convention. When propionate (or higher order) nucleophiles add to aldehydes, the reader visualizes the &quot;R&quot; group of the ketone and the &quot;R&quot;&#x27; group of the aldehyde aligned in a &quot;zig zag&quot; pattern on the paper (or screen). The disposition of the formed stereocenters is deemed &quot;syn&quot; or &quot;anti&quot;, depending if they are on the same or opposite sides of the main chain:

The principal factor determining an aldol reaction&#x27;s stereoselectivity is the enolizing metal counterion. Shorter metal-oxygen bonds &quot;tighten&quot; the transition state and effects greater stereoselection. Boron is often used because its bond lengths are significantly shorter than other cheap metals (lithium, aluminium, or magnesium). The following reaction gives a &quot;syn:anti&quot; ratio of 80:20 using a lithium enolate compared to 97:3 using a dibutylboron enolate.

Where the counterion determines stereoinduction strength, the enolate isomer determines its direction. &quot;E&quot; isomers give &quot;anti&quot; products and &quot;Z&quot; give &quot;syn&quot;:

===Zimmermann-Traxler model===
If the two reactants have carbonyls adjacent to a pre-existing stereocenter, then the new stereocenters may form at a fixed orientation relative to the old. This &quot;substrate-based stereocontrol&quot; has seen extensive study and examples pervade the literature. In many cases, a stylized transition state, called the Zimmerman–Traxler model, can predict the new orientation from the configuration of a 6-membered ring.

==== On the enol ====
If the enol has an adjacent stereocenter, then the two stereocenters flanking the carbonyl in the product are naturally &quot;syn&quot;:

The underlying mechanistic reason depends on the enol isomer. For an &quot;E&quot; enolate, the stereoinduction is necessary to avoid 1,3-allylic strain, while a &quot;Z&quot; enolate instead seeks to avoid 1,3-diaxial interactions:
However, Fráter &amp; Seebach showed that a chelating Lewis basic moiety adjacent to the enol will instead cause &quot;anti&quot; addition.

==== On the electrophile ====
&quot;E&quot; enolates exhibit Felkin diastereoface selection, while &quot;Z&quot; enolates exhibit anti-Felkin selectivity. The general model is presented below:

Since the transition state for &quot;Z&quot; enolates must contain either a destabilizing &quot;syn&quot;-pentane interaction or an anti-Felkin rotamer, &quot;Z&quot;-enolates are less diastereoselective: 

==== On both ====
If both the enolate and the aldehyde contain pre-existing chirality, then the outcome of the &quot;double stereodifferentiating&quot; aldol reaction may be predicted using a merged stereochemical model that takes into account all the effects discussed above. Several examples are as follows:
==Oxazolidinone chiral auxiliaries==
In the late 1970s and 1980s, David A. Evans and coworkers developed a technique for stereoselection in the aldol syntheses of aldehydes and carboxylic acids. The method works by temporarily appending a chiral oxazolidinone auxiliary to create a chiral enolate. The pre-existing chirality from the auxiliary is then transferred to the aldol adduct through Zimmermann-Traxler methods, and then the oxazolidinone cleaved away.



Commercial oxazolidinones are relatively expensive, but derive in 2 synthetic steps from comparatively inexpensive amino acids. (Economical large-scale syntheses prepare the auxiliary in-house.) First, a borohydride reduces the acid moiety. Then the resulting amino alcohol dehydratively cyclises with a simple carbonate ester, such as diethylcarbonate.

The acylation of an oxazolidinone is informally referred to as &quot;loading done&quot;.

&quot;Anti&quot; adducts, which require an &quot;E&quot; enolate, cannot be obtained reliably with the Evans method. However, &quot;Z&quot; enolates, leading to &quot;syn&quot; adducts, can be reliably formed using boron-mediated soft enolization:

Often, a single diastereomer may be obtained by one crystallization of the aldol adduct.

Many methods cleave the auxiliary:

==Variations==
A common additional chiral auxiliary is a thioether group:

===Crimmins thiazolidinethione aldol===
In the Crimmins thiazolidinethione approach, a thiazolidinethione is the chiral auxiliary and can produce the &quot;Evans syn&quot; or &quot;non-Evans syn&quot; adducts by simply varying the amount of (−)-sparteine. The reaction is believed to proceed via six-membered, titanium-bound transition states, analogous to the proposed transition states for the Evans auxiliary.

=== &quot;Masked&quot; enols ===
A common modification of the aldol reaction uses other, similar functional groups as &quot;ersatz&quot; enols. In the Mukaiyama aldol reaction, silyl enol ethers add to carbonyls in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as boron trifluoride (as boron trifluoride etherate) or titanium tetrachloride.

In the Stork enamine alkylation, secondary amines form enamines when exposed to ketones. These enamines then react (possibly enantio­selectively) with suitable electrophiles. This strategy offers simple enantioselection without transition metals. In contrast to the preference for &quot;syn&quot; adducts typically observed in enolate-based aldol additions, these aldol additions are &quot;anti&quot;-selective.

In aqueous solution, the enamine can then be hydrolyzed from the product, making it a small organic molecule catalyst. In a seminal example, proline efficiently catalyzed the cyclization of a triketone:

This combination is the Hajos-Parrish reaction Under Hajos-Parrish conditions only a catalytic amount of proline is necessary (3 mol%). There is no danger of an achiral background reaction because the transient enamine intermediates are much more nucleophilic than their parent ketone enols.

A Stork-type strategy also allows the otherwise challenging cross-reactions between two aldehydes. In many cases, the conditions are mild enough to avoid polymerization: However, selectivity requires the slow syringe-pump controlled addition of the desired electrophilic partner because both reacting partners typically have enolizable protons. If one aldehyde has no enolizable protons or alpha- or beta-branching, additional control can be achieved.

===&quot;Direct&quot; aldol additions===
In the usual aldol addition, a carbonyl compound is deprotonated to form the enolate. The enolate is added to an aldehyde or ketone, which forms an alkoxide, which is then protonated on workup. A superior method, in principle, would avoid the requirement for a multistep sequence in favor of a &quot;direct&quot; reaction that could be done in a single process step.

If one coupling partner preferentially enolizes, then the general problem is that the addition generates an alkoxide, which is much more basic than the starting materials. This product binds tightly to the enolizing agent, preventing it from catalyzing additional reactants: 

One approach, demonstrated by Evans, is to silylate the aldol adduct. A silicon reagent such as TMSCl is added in the reaction, which replaces the metal on the alkoxide, allowing turnover of the metal catalyst: 

== Use in carbohydrate synthesis ==
Traditional syntheses of hexoses use variations of iterative protection-deprotection strategies, requiring 8–14 steps, organocatalysis can access many of the same substrates by a two-step protocol involving the proline-catalyzed dimerization of alpha-oxyaldehydes followed by tandem Mukaiyama aldol cyclization.

The aldol dimerization of alpha-oxyaldehydes requires that the aldol adduct, itself an aldehyde, be inert to further aldol reactions.
Earlier studies revealed that aldehydes bearing alpha-alkyloxy or alpha-silyloxy substituents were suitable for this reaction, while aldehydes bearing Electron-withdrawing groups such as acetoxy were unreactive. The protected erythrose product could then be converted to four possible sugars via Mukaiyama aldol addition followed by lactol formation. This requires appropriate diastereocontrol in the Mukaiyama aldol addition and the product silyloxycarbenium ion to preferentially cyclize, rather than undergo further aldol reaction. In the end, glucose, mannose, and allose were synthesized:

==Biological aldol reactions==
Examples of aldol reactions in biochemistry include the splitting of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate in the fourth stage of glycolysis, which is an example of a reverse (&quot;retro&quot;) aldol reaction catalyzed by the enzyme aldolase A (also known as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase).

In the glyoxylate cycle of plants and some prokaryotes, isocitrate lyase produces glyoxylate and succinate from isocitrate. Following deprotonation of the OH group, isocitrate lyase cleaves isocitrate into the four-carbon succinate and the two-carbon glyoxylate by an aldol cleavage reaction. This cleavage is similar mechanistically to the aldolase A reaction of glycolysis.

==History==
The aldol reaction was discovered independently by the Russian chemist (and Romantic composer) Alexander Borodin in 1869 and by the French chemist Charles-Adolphe Wurtz in 1872, which originally used aldehydes to perform the reaction.

Howard Zimmerman and Marjorie D. Traxler proposed their model for stereoinduction in a 1957 paper.

<text>A synthetic diamond or laboratory-grown diamond (LGD), also called a lab-grown diamond, laboratory-created, man-made, artisan-created, artificial, synthetic, or cultured diamond, is a diamond that is produced in a controlled technological process (in contrast to naturally formed diamond, which is created through geological processes and obtained by mining). Unlike diamond simulants (imitations of diamond made of superficially similar non-diamond materials), synthetic diamonds are composed of the same material as naturally formed diamonds—pure carbon crystallized in an isotropic 3D form—and have identical chemical and physical properties. the heaviest synthetic diamond ever made weighs 30.18 ct (6.0 g); the heaviest natural diamond ever found weighs 3167 ct (633.4 g).

Numerous claims of diamond synthesis were reported between 1879 and 1928 after English chemist Smithson Tennant demonstrated that diamonds are a form of carbon in 1797; most of these attempts were carefully analyzed but none was confirmed. In the 1940s, systematic research of diamond creation began in the United States, Sweden and the Soviet Union, which culminated in the first reproducible synthesis in 1953. Further research activity yielded the discoveries of the high pressure high temperature (HPHT) and [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) methods of diamond production. These two processes still dominate synthetic diamond production. A third method in which nanometer-sized diamond grains are created in a detonation of carbon-containing explosives, known as detonation synthesis, entered the market in the late 1990s. A fourth method, treating graphite with high-power ultrasound, has been demonstrated in the laboratory, but as of 2008 had no commercial application.
The properties of synthetic diamonds depend on the manufacturing process. Some have properties such as hardness, thermal conductivity and electron mobility that are superior to those of most naturally formed diamonds. Synthetic diamond is widely used in abrasives, in cutting and polishing tools and in heat sinks. Electronic applications of synthetic diamond are being developed, including high-power switches at power stations, high-frequency field-effect transistors and light-emitting diodes. Synthetic diamond detectors of ultraviolet (UV) light and of high-energy particles are used at high-energy research facilities and are available commercially. Due to its unique combination of thermal and chemical stability, low thermal expansion and high optical transparency in a wide spectral range, synthetic diamond is becoming the most popular material for optical windows in high-power lasers and gyrotrons. It is estimated that 98% of industrial-grade diamond demand is supplied with synthetic diamonds.

Both CVD and HPHT diamonds can be cut into gems, and various colors can be produced: clear white, yellow, brown, blue, green and orange. The advent of synthetic gems on the market created major concerns in the diamond trading business, as a result of which special spectroscopic devices and techniques have been developed to distinguish synthetic from natural diamonds.

== History ==

In the early stages of diamond synthesis, the founding figure of modern chemistry, Antoine Lavoisier, played a significant role. His groundbreaking discovery that a diamond&#x27;s crystal lattice is similar to carbon&#x27;s crystal structure paved the way for initial attempts to produce diamonds.
After it was discovered that diamond was pure carbon in 1797, many attempts were made to convert various cheap forms of carbon into diamond. The earliest successes were reported by James Ballantyne Hannay in 1879 and by Ferdinand Frédéric Henri Moissan in 1893. Their method involved heating charcoal at up to with iron inside a carbon crucible in a furnace. Whereas Hannay used a flame-heated tube, Moissan applied his newly developed electric arc furnace, in which an electric arc was struck between carbon rods inside blocks of lime. The molten iron was then rapidly cooled by immersion in water. The contraction generated by the cooling supposedly produced the high pressure required to transform graphite into diamond. Moissan published his work in a series of articles in the 1890s.

Many other scientists tried to replicate his experiments. Sir William Crookes claimed success in 1909. Otto Ruff claimed in 1917 to have produced diamonds up to in diameter, but later retracted his statement. In 1926, Dr. J. Willard Hershey of McPherson College replicated Moissan&#x27;s and Ruff&#x27;s experiments, producing a synthetic diamond. Despite the claims of Moissan, Ruff, and Hershey, other experimenters were unable to reproduce their synthesis.

The most definitive replication attempts were performed by Sir Charles Algernon Parsons. A prominent scientist and engineer known for his invention of the steam turbine, he spent about 40 years (1882–1922) and a considerable part of his fortune trying to reproduce the experiments of Moissan and Hannay, but also adapted processes of his own. Parsons was known for his painstakingly accurate approach and methodical record keeping; all his resulting samples were preserved for further analysis by an independent party. He wrote a number of articles—some of the earliest on HPHT diamond—in which he claimed to have produced small diamonds. However, in 1928, he authorized Dr. C. H. Desch to publish an article in which he stated his belief that no synthetic diamonds (including those of Moissan and others) had been produced up to that date. He suggested that most diamonds that had been produced up to that point were likely synthetic spinel.

=== ASEA ===

The first known (but initially not reported) diamond synthesis was achieved on February 16, 1953, in Stockholm by ASEA (Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget), Sweden&#x27;s major electrical equipment manufacturing company. Starting in 1942, ASEA employed a team of five scientists and engineers as part of a top-secret diamond-making project code-named QUINTUS. The team used a bulky split-sphere apparatus designed by Baltzar von Platen and Anders Kämpe. Pressure was maintained within the device at an estimated and a temperature of for an hour. A few small diamonds were produced, but not of gem quality or size.

Due to questions on the patent process and the reasonable belief that no other serious diamond synthesis research occurred globally, the board of ASEA opted against publicity and patent applications. Thus the announcement of the ASEA results occurred shortly after the GE press conference of February 15, 1955.

=== GE diamond project ===
In 1941, an agreement was made between the General Electric (GE), Norton and Carborundum companies to further develop diamond synthesis. They were able to heat carbon to about under a pressure of for a few seconds. Soon thereafter, the Second World War interrupted the project. It was resumed in 1951 at the Schenectady Laboratories of GE, and a high-pressure diamond group was formed with Francis P. Bundy and H. M. Strong. Tracy Hall and others joined the project later.

The Schenectady group improved on the anvils designed by Percy Bridgman, who received a Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in 1946. Bundy and Strong made the first improvements, then more were made by Hall. The GE team used tungsten carbide anvils within a hydraulic press to squeeze the carbonaceous sample held in a catlinite container, the finished grit being squeezed out of the container into a gasket. The team recorded diamond synthesis on one occasion, but the experiment could not be reproduced because of uncertain synthesis conditions, and the diamond was later shown to have been a natural diamond used as a seed.

Hall achieved the first commercially successful synthesis of diamond on December 16, 1954, and this was announced on February 15, 1955. His breakthrough came when he used a press with a hardened steel toroidal &quot;belt&quot; strained to its elastic limit wrapped around the sample, producing pressures above and temperatures above . The press used a pyrophyllite container in which graphite was dissolved within molten nickel, cobalt or iron. Those metals acted as a &quot;solvent-catalyst&quot;, which both dissolved carbon and accelerated its conversion into diamond. The largest diamond he produced was across; it was too small and visually imperfect for jewelry, but usable in industrial abrasives. Hall&#x27;s co-workers were able to replicate his work, and the discovery was published in the major journal &quot;Nature&quot;. He was the first person to grow a synthetic diamond with a reproducible, verifiable and well-documented process. He left GE in 1955, and three years later developed a new apparatus for the synthesis of diamond—a tetrahedral press with four anvils—to avoid violating a U.S. Department of Commerce secrecy order on the GE patent applications.

=== Further development ===

Synthetic gem-quality diamond crystals were first produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded at each end with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material was placed in the center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about . The crystals grow as they flow from the center to the ends of the tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.

The first gem-quality stones were always yellow to brown in color because of contamination with nitrogen. Inclusions were common, especially &quot;plate-like&quot; ones from the nickel. Removing all nitrogen from the process by adding aluminum or titanium produced colorless &quot;white&quot; stones, and removing the nitrogen and adding boron produced blue ones. Removing nitrogen also slowed the growth process and reduced the crystalline quality, so the process was normally run with nitrogen present.

Although the GE stones and natural diamonds were chemically identical, their physical properties were not the same. The colorless stones produced strong fluorescence and phosphorescence under short-wavelength ultraviolet light, but were inert under long-wave UV. Among natural diamonds, only the rarer blue gems exhibit these properties. Unlike natural diamonds, all the GE stones showed strong yellow fluorescence under X-rays. The De Beers Diamond Research Laboratory has grown stones of up to for research purposes. Stable HPHT conditions were kept for six weeks to grow high-quality diamonds of this size. For economic reasons, the growth of most synthetic diamonds is terminated when they reach a mass of to .

In the 1950s, research started in the Soviet Union and the US on the growth of diamond by pyrolysis of hydrocarbon gases at the relatively low temperature of . This low-pressure process is known as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). William G. Eversole reportedly achieved vapor deposition of diamond over diamond substrate in 1953, but it was not reported until 1962. Diamond film deposition was independently reproduced by Angus and coworkers in 1968 and by Deryagin and Fedoseev in 1970. Whereas Eversole and Angus used large, expensive, single-crystal diamonds as substrates, Deryagin and Fedoseev succeeded in making diamond films on non-diamond materials (silicon and metals), which led to massive research on inexpensive diamond coatings in the 1980s.

From 2013, reports emerged of a rise in undisclosed synthetic melee diamonds (small round diamonds typically used to frame a central diamond or embellish a band) being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade. Due to the relatively low cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal knowledge for identifying large quantities of melee efficiently, not all dealers have made an effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or synthetic origin. However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.

== Manufacturing technologies ==
There are several methods used to produce synthetic diamonds. The original method uses high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) and is still widely used because of its relatively low cost. The process involves large presses that can weigh hundreds of tons to produce a pressure of at . The second method, using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), creates a carbon plasma over a substrate onto which the carbon atoms deposit to form diamond. Other methods include explosive formation (forming detonation nanodiamonds) and sonication of graphite solutions.

=== High pressure, high temperature ===

In the HPHT method, there are three main press designs used to supply the pressure and temperature necessary to produce synthetic diamond: the belt press, the cubic press and the split-sphere (BARS) press. Diamond seeds are placed at the bottom of the press.
The internal part of the press is heated above and melts the solvent metal. The molten metal dissolves the high purity carbon source, which is then transported to the small diamond seeds and precipitates, forming a large synthetic diamond.

The original GE invention by Tracy Hall uses the belt press wherein the upper and lower anvils supply the pressure load to a cylindrical inner cell. This internal pressure is confined radially by a belt of pre-stressed steel bands. The anvils also serve as electrodes providing electric current to the compressed cell. A variation of the belt press uses hydraulic pressure, rather than steel belts, to confine the internal pressure. Belt presses are still used today, but they are built on a much larger scale than those of the original design.

The second type of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide pressure simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils to achieve the same pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.
The BARS apparatus is claimed to be the most compact, efficient, and economical of all the diamond-producing presses. In the center of a BARS device, there is a ceramic cylindrical &quot;synthesis capsule&quot; of about in size. The cell is placed into a cube of pressure-transmitting material, such as pyrophyllite ceramics, which is pressed by inner anvils made from cemented carbide (e.g., tungsten carbide or VK10 hard alloy). The outer octahedral cavity is pressed by 8 steel outer anvils. After mounting, the whole assembly is locked in a disc-type barrel with a diameter about . The barrel is filled with oil, which pressurizes upon heating, and the oil pressure is transferred to the central cell. The synthesis capsule is heated up by a coaxial graphite heater, and the temperature is measured with a thermocouple.

=== Chemical vapor deposition ===

Chemical vapor deposition is a method by which diamond can be grown from a hydrocarbon gas mixture. Since the early 1980s, this method has been the subject of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the mass production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under .

The CVD growth involves substrate preparation, feeding varying amounts of gases into a chamber and energizing them. The substrate preparation includes choosing an appropriate material and its crystallographic orientation; cleaning it, often with a diamond powder to abrade a non-diamond substrate; and optimizing the substrate temperature (about ) during the growth through a series of test runs. Moreover, optimizing the gas mixture composition and flow rates is paramount to ensure uniform and high-quality diamond growth. The gases always include a carbon source, typically methane, and hydrogen with a typical ratio of 1:99. Hydrogen is essential because it selectively etches off non-diamond carbon. The gases are ionized into chemically active radicals in the growth chamber using microwave power, a hot filament, an arc discharge, a welding torch, a laser, an electron beam, or other means.

During the growth, the chamber materials are etched off by the plasma and can incorporate into the growing diamond. In particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from the silica windows of the growth chamber or from the silicon substrate. Therefore, silica windows are either avoided or moved away from the substrate. Boron-containing species in the chamber, even at very low trace levels, also make it unsuitable for the growth of pure diamond.

=== Detonation of explosives ===
Diamond nanocrystals ( in diameter) can be formed by detonating certain carbon-containing explosives in a metal chamber. These are called &quot;detonation nanodiamonds&quot;. During the explosion, the pressure and temperature in the chamber become high enough to convert the carbon of the explosives into diamond. Being immersed in water, the chamber cools rapidly after the explosion, suppressing conversion of newly produced diamond into more stable graphite. In a variation of this technique, a metal tube filled with graphite powder is placed in the detonation chamber. The explosion heats and compresses the graphite to an extent sufficient for its conversion into diamond. The product is always rich in graphite and other non-diamond carbon forms, and requires prolonged boiling in hot nitric acid (about 1 day at ) to dissolve them. The recovered nanodiamond powder is used primarily in polishing applications. It is mainly produced in China, Russia and Belarus, and started reaching the market in bulk quantities by the early 2000s.

=== Ultrasound cavitation ===
Micron-sized diamond crystals can be synthesized from a suspension of graphite in organic liquid at atmospheric pressure and room temperature using ultrasonic cavitation. The diamond yield is about 10% of the initial graphite weight. The estimated cost of diamond produced by this method is comparable to that of the HPHT method but the crystalline perfection of the product is significantly worse for the ultrasonic synthesis. This technique requires relatively simple equipment and procedures, and has been reported by two research groups, but had no industrial use as of 2008. Numerous process parameters, such as preparation of the initial graphite powder, the choice of ultrasonic power, synthesis time and the solvent, were not optimized, leaving a window for potential improvement of the efficiency and reduction of the cost of the ultrasonic synthesis.

===Crystallization inside liquid metal===
In 2024, scientists announced a method that utilizes injecting methane and hydrogen gases onto a liquid metal alloy of gallium, iron, nickel and silicon (77.25/11.00/11.00/0.25 ratio) at approximately 1,025 °C to crystallize diamond at 1 atmosphere of pressure. The crystallization is a ‘seedless’ process, which further separates it from conventional high-pressure and high-temperature or chemical vapor deposition methods. Injection of methane and hydrogen results in a diamond nucleus after around 15 minutes and eventually a continuous diamond film after around 150 minutes.

== Properties ==
Traditionally, the absence of crystal flaws is considered to be the most important quality of a diamond. Purity and high crystalline perfection make diamonds transparent and clear, whereas its hardness, optical dispersion (luster), and chemical stability (combined with marketing), make it a popular gemstone. High thermal conductivity is also important for technical applications. Whereas high optical dispersion is an intrinsic property of all diamonds, their other properties vary depending on how the diamond was created.

=== Crystallinity ===
Diamond can be one single, continuous crystal or it can be made up of many smaller crystals (polycrystal). Large, clear and transparent single-crystal diamonds are typically used as gemstones. Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) consists of numerous small grains, which are easily seen by the naked eye through strong light absorption and scattering; it is unsuitable for gems and is used for industrial applications such as mining and cutting tools. Polycrystalline diamond is often described by the average size (or grain size) of the crystals that make it up. Grain sizes range from nanometers to hundreds of micrometers, usually referred to as &quot;nanocrystalline&quot; and &quot;microcrystalline&quot; diamond, respectively.

=== Hardness ===
The hardness of diamond is 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, the hardest known material on this scale. Diamond is also the hardest known natural material for its resistance to indentation. The hardness of synthetic diamond depends on its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the [111] direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice). Nanocrystalline diamond produced through CVD diamond growth can have a hardness ranging from 30% to 75% of that of single crystal diamond, and the hardness can be controlled for specific applications. Some synthetic single-crystal diamonds and HPHT nanocrystalline diamonds (see hyperdiamond) are harder than any known natural diamond.

=== Impurities and inclusions ===

Every diamond contains atoms other than carbon in concentrations detectable by analytical techniques. Those atoms can aggregate into macroscopic phases called inclusions. Impurities are generally avoided, but can be introduced intentionally as a way to control certain properties of the diamond. Growth processes of synthetic diamond, using solvent-catalysts, generally lead to formation of a number of impurity-related complex centers, involving transition metal atoms (such as nickel, cobalt or iron), which affect the electronic properties of the material.

For instance, pure diamond is an electrical insulator, but diamond with boron added is an electrical conductor (and, in some cases, a superconductor), allowing it to be used in electronic applications. Nitrogen impurities hinder movement of lattice dislocations (defects within the crystal structure) and put the lattice under compressive stress, thereby increasing hardness and toughness.

=== Thermal conductivity ===
The thermal conductivity of CVD diamond ranges from tens of W/m2K to more than 2000 W/m2K, depending on the defects, grain boundary structures. As the growth of diamond in CVD, the grains grow with the film thickness, leading to a gradient thermal conductivity along the film thickness direction.

Unlike most electrical insulators, pure diamond is an excellent conductor of heat because of the strong covalent bonding within the crystal. The thermal conductivity of pure diamond is the highest of any known solid. Single crystals of synthetic diamond enriched in (99.9%), isotopically pure diamond, have the highest thermal conductivity of any material, 30 W/cm·K at room temperature, 7.5 times higher than that of copper. Natural diamond&#x27;s conductivity is reduced by 1.1% by the naturally present, which acts as an inhomogeneity in the lattice.

Diamond&#x27;s thermal conductivity is made use of by jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip&#x27;s thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.

== Industrial applications ==
=== Machining and cutting tools ===
Most industrial applications of synthetic diamond have long been associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for machine tools and cutting tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond can be used to polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this ability include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. These are by far the largest industrial applications of synthetic diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT diamond is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.

The usual form of diamond in cutting tools is micron-sized grains dispersed in a metal matrix (usually cobalt) sintered onto the tool. This is typically referred to in industry as polycrystalline diamond (PCD). PCD-tipped tools can be found in mining and cutting applications. For the past fifteen years, work has been done to coat metallic tools with CVD diamond, and though the work shows promise, it has not significantly replaced traditional PCD tools.

=== Thermal conductor ===
Most materials with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond is used as a heat spreader for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices&#x27; high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting devices from overheating.

=== Optical material ===
Diamond is hard, chemically inert, and has high thermal conductivity and a low coefficient of thermal expansion. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace zinc selenide as the output window of high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10 cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique. Single crystal slabs of dimensions of length up to approximately 10 mm are becoming increasingly important in several areas of optics including heatspreaders inside laser cavities, diffractive optics and as the optical gain medium in Raman lasers. Recent advances in the HPHT and CVD synthesis techniques have improved the purity and crystallographic structure perfection of single-crystalline diamond enough to replace silicon as a diffraction grating and window material in high-power radiation sources, such as synchrotrons. Both the CVD and HPHT processes are also used to create designer optically transparent diamond anvils as a tool for measuring electric and magnetic properties of materials at ultra high pressures using a diamond anvil cell.

=== Electronics ===
Synthetic diamond has potential uses as a semiconductor, because it can be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one fewer valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235 nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500 cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favorable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50 GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.

Synthetic diamond transistors have been produced in the laboratory. They remain functional at much higher temperatures than silicon devices, and are resistant to chemical and radiation damage. While no diamond transistors have yet been successfully integrated into commercial electronics, they are promising for use in exceptionally high-power situations and hostile non-oxidizing environments.

Synthetic diamond is already used as radiation detection device. It is radiation hard and has a wide bandgap of 5.5 eV (at room temperature). Diamond is also distinguished from most other semiconductors by the lack of a stable native oxide. This makes it difficult to fabricate surface MOS devices, but it does create the potential for UV radiation to gain access to the active semiconductor without absorption in a surface layer. Because of these properties, it is employed in applications such as the BaBar detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator and BOLD (Blind to the Optical Light Detectors for VUV solar observations). A diamond VUV detector recently was used in the European LYRA program.

Conductive CVD diamond is a useful electrode under many circumstances. Photochemical methods have been developed for covalently linking DNA to the surface of polycrystalline diamond films produced through CVD. Such DNA-modified films can be used for detecting various biomolecules, which would interact with DNA thereby changing electrical conductivity of the diamond film. In addition, diamonds can be used to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic contaminants in water supplies. Because diamond is mechanically and chemically stable, it can be used as an electrode under conditions that would destroy traditional materials. As an electrode, synthetic diamond can be used in waste water treatment of organic effluents and the production of strong oxidants.

== Gemstones ==
Synthetic diamonds for use as gemstones are grown by HPHT or CVD methods, with the market share of synthetic jewelry-quality diamonds growing as advances in technology allow for larger higher-quality synthetic production on a more economical scale. According to a Gem &amp; Jewellery Export Promotional Council report, synthetic diamonds accounted for 0.28% of rough diamonds produced for use as gemstones in 2013, and synthetic diamonds represented approximately 2% of the gem-quality diamond market in the same year. 
By 2020, this had increased to just 3%, before climbing to 7% of the diamond jewelery market in 2022. As of 2023, synthetic diamonds&#x27; share had jumped to 17% of the overall diamond market. They are available in yellow, pink, green, orange, blue and, to a lesser extent, colorless (or white). The yellow comes from nitrogen impurities in the manufacturing process, while the blue comes from boron. Other colors, such as pink or green, are achievable after synthesis using irradiation. Several companies also offer memorial diamonds grown using cremated remains.

In May 2015, a record was set for an HPHT colorless diamond at 10.02 carats. The faceted jewel was cut from a 32.2-carat stone that was grown in about 300 hours. By 2022, gem-quality diamonds of 16–20 carats were being produced.

===Price===
Around 2016, the price of synthetic diamond gemstones (e.g., 1-carat stones) began dropping &quot;precipitously&quot;, by roughly 30% in one year, becoming clearly lower than that of mined diamond gems. As of 2017, synthetic diamonds sold as jewelry were typically selling for 15–20% less than natural equivalents; the relative price was expected to decline further as production economics improved. In April 2022, CNN Business reported that a synthetic one-carat round diamond commonly used in engagement rings was up to 73% cheaper than a natural diamond with the same features, and that the number of engagement rings featuring a synthetic or a lab grown diamond had increased 63% compared to the previous year, while the those sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. By the beginning of 2025 laboratory-grown diamonds had dropped in price by 74% since 2020, and prices were expected to continue decreasing. The drop was attributed largely to improvement in speed of laboratory growing of diamonds from weeks (and billions of years for natural stones) to hours.

===Marketing and classification===
Gem-quality diamonds grown in a lab can be chemically, physically, and optically identical to naturally occurring ones. The mined diamond industry has undertaken legal, marketing, and distribution countermeasures to try to protect its market from the emerging presence of synthetic diamonds, including price fixing. Synthetic diamonds can be distinguished by spectroscopy in the infrared, ultraviolet, or X-ray wavelengths. The DiamondView tester from De Beers uses UV fluorescence to detect trace impurities of nitrogen, nickel, or other metals in HPHT or CVD diamonds. Many other test instruments are available.

Diamond certification laboratories, equipped with instruments that can reliably distinguish laboratory-grown from natural diamonds, certify diamonds. Several laboratories, including GIA, IGI and GSI, inscribe every lab-grown diamond they certify with a laser inscription invisible to the naked eye that can be seen at ten times magnification. The report number is inscribed, with an indication that the stone is lab-grown.

In May 2018, De Beers announced that it would introduce a new jewelry brand called &quot;Lightbox&quot; that features synthetic diamonds, which was notable as the company was the world&#x27;s largest diamond miner and had previously been an outspoken critic of synthetic diamonds. In July 2018, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission approved a substantial revision to its Jewelry Guides, with changes that impose new rules on how the trade can describe diamonds and diamond simulants. The revised guides were substantially contrary to what had been advocated in 2016 by De Beers. The new guidelines remove the word &quot;natural&quot; from the definition of &quot;diamond&quot;, thus including lab-grown diamonds within the scope of the definition of &quot;diamond&quot;. The revised guide further states that &quot;If a marketer uses &#x27;synthetic&#x27; to imply that a competitor&#x27;s lab-grown diamond is not an actual diamond, ... this would be deceptive.&quot; In July 2019, the third party diamond certification lab GIA (Gemological Institute of America) dropped the word &#x27;synthetic&#x27; from its certification process and report for lab-grown diamonds, according to the FTC revision.

===Ethical and environmental considerations===
Traditional diamond mining has led to human rights abuses in several countries in Africa and other diamond mining countries. The 2006 Hollywood movie &quot;Blood Diamond&quot; helped to publicize the problem. Consumer demand for synthetic diamonds has been increasing, albeit from a small base, as customers look for ethically sound and cheaper stones.

Apart from the ethical aspect, three key environmental factors play a central role in the ecological comparison of laboratory diamonds and mine diamonds:

# Water Usage: Excavating one carat of rough-mined diamond requires approximately 96 liters of water per carat. In contrast, producing a one-carat lab-grown diamond requires only about 0 to 2 liters of water per carat.
# Mineral Waste Disposal and Land Disruption: Diamond mining generates significantly more mineral waste than other forms of mining, with up to 2 million tons of waste for every ton of diamonds produced, whereas other metals such as iron or gold typically produce less than 10 tons of waste per ton mined. Further, mining one carat of diamond disturbs approximately 9 m² of land and generates around 2600 kg of mineral waste, including highly toxic trace metals. In contrast, producing one carat of lab-grown diamond involves significantly less environmental impact, with only 0.0065 m² of land disruption and 0.5 kg of mineral waste.
# Energy Usage and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions: Lab-grown diamonds have been criticised for their energy consumption, however a 2021 journal article found that lab-grown diamonds produced via the HPHT method require between 28 and 36 kWh per carat, while the CVD method requires between 77 and 215 kWh per carat. For comparison, mined diamonds consume between 96 and 150 kWh per carat, based on reports from industry leaders ALROSA and DeBeers, which together represent over 50% of global diamond production. Thus, lab-grown HPHT diamonds use at least half the energy per carat than mined diamonds, while CVD produced diamonds can use less or more energy per carat than mined diamonds depending on the specific equipment and laboratory setup. Additionally, energy consumption alone does not fully determine the environmental impact. A critical factor to consider is the energy source. GHG emissions from electricity production (measured in grams of CO₂ equivalent per kWh, or g CO₂ e/kWh) are essential for evaluating the environmental footprint. On average, about 73% of the energy used by DeBeers for diamond mining comes directly from fossil fuels. Fossil fuels result in CO₂ emissions between 200 and 800 g CO₂e/kWh. The remaining 27% of their energy consumption relies on electricity. However, it can be generated from fossil fuels or renewable sources. Mining one ton of rough diamonds generates approximately 57000 tons of GHG emissions, which is twice the amount produced by gold mining and 30000 times greater than that of iron ore mining. In contrast, the energy required to create lab-grown diamonds can be sourced entirely from renewable energy, yielding zero g CO₂e/kWh emissions. This process positions lab-grown diamonds as an exceptionally sustainable option, as they can be produced with no greenhouse gas impact when renewable sources are used.

<doc id="498143" wikidata="Q340401" url="?curid=498143" title="The Book of Lost Tales">
<text>The Book of Lost Tales is a collection of early stories by the English writer J. R. R. Tolkien, published as the first two volumes of Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s 12-volume series &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;, in which he presents and analyses the manuscripts of those stories, which were the earliest form (begun in 1917) of the complex fictional myths that would eventually form &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. Each of the Tales is followed by notes and a detailed commentary by Christopher Tolkien.

For publication the book was split into two volumes: &quot;The Book of Lost Tales 1&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Book of Lost Tales 2&quot; (1984), but this is simply an editorial division. Each volume contains several &quot;Lost Tales&quot;.

== Content ==


=== Outline, with later equivalents in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; ===

=== Inscriptions ===

There is an inscription in the Fëanorian characters (Tengwar, an alphabet Tolkien devised for High-Elves) in the first pages of every &quot;History of Middle-earth&quot; volume, written by Christopher Tolkien and describing the contents of the book. The inscription in Book I reads &quot;This is the first part of the Book of the Lost Tales of Elfinesse which Eriol the Mariner learned from the Elves of Tol Eressëa, the Lonely Isle in the western ocean, and afterwards wrote in the Golden Book of Tavrobel. Herein are told the Tales of Valinor, from the Music of the Ainur to the Exile of the Noldoli and the Hiding of Valinor.&quot;

The inscription in Book II reads &quot;This is the second part of the Book of the Lost Tales of Elfinesse which Eriol the Mariner learned from the Elves of Tol Eressëa, the Lonely Isle in the western ocean, and afterwards wrote in the Golden Book of Tavrobel. Herein are told the Tales of Beren and Tinúviel, of Turambar, of the Fall of Gondolin and of the Necklace of the Dwarves.&quot;

== Reception ==

=== General ===

The science fiction author Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;The Book of Lost Tales I&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;Those who prefer their fairy-tales sophisticated, in weighty prose with scholarly footnotes and appendices, will plunge joyously into J R R Tolkien&#x27;s first &quot;Book of Lost Tales&quot;.&quot;

The science fiction critic Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Book of Lost Tales II&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #59, stating that he had mixed feelings about it, since while it provided some added depth, he was not sure that every detail was worth &quot;annotating with such ghastly solemnity.&quot;
=== Scholarly ===

The Tolkien scholar Charles Noad, reviewing Part 1 in &quot;Mallorn&quot; in 1984, notes the mismatches between the names in the book and those in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, the many alternative names, and the varying attributes of the characters when the name remains unchanged. He likens the book&#x27;s relationship to &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; to that of a charcoal sketch and the oil painting that it precedes: much work is evidently needed. Further, Tolkien&#x27;s prose style is at this point still &quot;immature and unsophisticated&quot;. Noad quotes Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s remark that development was usually &quot;by subtle transformation&quot;. He finds &quot;very extraordinary&quot; the revelation that the island that the wanderer Eriol sets foot on is what would become England. He notes, too, what he calls a major problem facing Tolkien: how &quot;to present his mythology in the proper perspective&quot;, commenting that it was meant to be &quot;a survival from the remotest antiquity&quot;. That, Noad writes, requires an indirect approach, which &quot;The Hobbit&quot; eventually provided: the legendarium became the distant past to the story in the foreground. He concludes that the book will be mainly of [literary] &#x27;archaeological&#x27; interest &quot;and cannot be recommended to the casual reader&quot;.

Noad, in his review of Part 2, comments that the reviewer&#x27;s task faces the problem that the sort of comparisons a review would normally make have already all been made, in &quot;abundant detail&quot;, by Christopher Tolkien in his commentary and notes. But it was still striking, he wrote, how Beren is here an Elf, not a Man; and Lúthien rescues him not from Sauron but from Tevildo, Prince of Cats. Noad finds it remarkable how much the story had changed, given that the tale of Lúthien and Beren was so important to Tolkien. Of the volume as a whole, Noad comments that it is less &quot;cosmographic&quot; than Part 1, but has a stronger narrative thread. All the same, he feels it is &quot;more of use to the curious&quot; or the researcher than a stand-alone work; he finds the writing &quot;stilted&quot;, failing to achieve its intended effects. Evidently, he concludes, Tolkien did not acquire his finished prose style quickly or easily. Noad praises Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s editing, setting out the complicated materials &quot;astonishingly well&quot;.

The Tolkien scholar Vladimir Brljak, writing in &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot; in 2010, notes that Tolkien&#x27;s comment in &quot;&quot;, that &quot;Beowulf&quot; was already antiquarian when written, and is now &quot;an echo of an echo&quot;, bringing poignant vistas of sad times long gone by, was also a defence of his own writings, where he followed the &quot;Beowulf&quot; poet in deliberately seeking to create an impression of depth. He did this in the two &quot;Books of Lost Tales&quot; by creating &quot;an intricate metafictional structure&quot;, embedding his works in a framework of &quot;translations of redactions of ancient works, telling of things even more ancient.&quot; Brljak argues that this framework is &quot;both the cornerstone and crowning achievement of Tolkien&#x27;s mature literary work.&quot;

<text>The Lays of Beleriand, published in 1985, is the third volume of Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s 12-volume book series, &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;, in which he analyzes the unpublished manuscripts of his father J. R. R. Tolkien.

== Book ==

=== Contents ===

The book contains the long heroic lays or lyric poetry from Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, omitted from &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;: these are &quot;The Lay of the Children of Húrin&quot; about the saga of Túrin Turambar, and &quot;The Lay of Leithian&quot; (also called &quot;Release from Bondage&quot;) which tells the Tale of Beren and Lúthien. Although Tolkien abandoned them before their respective ends, they are both long enough to occupy many stanzas, each of which can last for over ten pages. The first poem is in alliterative verse, and the second is in rhyming couplets. Both exist in two versions.

In addition to these two poems, the book contains three short, soon-abandoned alliterative poems, &quot;The Flight of the Noldoli from Valinor&quot;, &quot;The Lay of Eärendel&quot;, and &quot;The Lay of the Fall of Gondolin&quot;.

The first versions of the long lays fit chronologically in with Tolkien&#x27;s earliest writings, as recounted in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, but the later version of &quot;The Lay of Leithian&quot; is contemporary with the writing of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

The book is split into these main sections:

# &quot;The Lay of the Children of Húrin&quot;, the tale of Túrin in 2276 lines of verse.
## First version
## Second version
# Poems Early Abandoned:
## &quot;The Flight of the Noldoli&quot;
## Fragment of an alliterative &quot;Lay of Earendel&quot;
## &quot;The Lay of the Fall of Gondolin&quot;
# The Lay of Leithian (unfinished poem: the Tale of Beren and Lúthien in verse (over 4200 lines of iambic tetrameters, in rhyming couplets):
## &quot;The Gest of Beren son of Barahir and Lúthien the Fay called Tinúviel the Nightingale or the Lay of Leithian - Release from Bondage&quot; (split into fourteen cantos)
## Unwritten cantos
## Appendix: Commentary by C. S. Lewis

These are followed by:


In the book Christopher Tolkien mentions a third Túrin poem, this time in rhyming couplets and incomplete. It is called &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot; and is only 170 lines long (compared to the 2276 lines of the first of the alliterative poems); that poem, however, has been omitted from the book.

=== Inscription ===

There is an inscription in the Fëanorian characters (Tengwar, an alphabet Tolkien has devised for High-Elves) in the first pages of every History of Middle-earth volume, written by Christopher Tolkien and describing the contents of the book. The inscription in Book III reads: &quot;In the first part of this Book is given the Lay of the Children of Húrin by John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, in which is set forth in part the Tale of Túrin. In the second part is the Lay of Leithian, which is the Gest of Beren and Lúthien as far as the encounter of Beren with Carcharoth at the gate of Angband&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==

David Langford reviewed &quot;The Lays of Beleriand&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #70, stating that &quot;A few gleams of humour come from C. S. Lewis&#x27;s 15-page critique of an early draft: for the rest, poor old Tolkien lies entombed and fossilized in earnest commentary, like a set text for Eng Lit.&quot;

The fantasy novelist Suzannah Rowntree wrote that the book is a favourite of hers, and the only volume of the twelve that she had read in full and &quot;[kept] coming back to for pleasure&quot;. In her view, &quot;the book&#x27;s main attraction is Part III, &#x27;The Lay of Leithian&#x27;&quot;. She describes this as &quot;a red-blooded, grand poem, written in a richly ornamented style bordering (in places) on the baroque. At worst this seems a little clumsy; at best it fits the lavish, heroic story and setting.&quot; She comments that Lewis &quot;obviously enjoyed the poem hugely,&quot; going so far as to invent scholars Peabody and Pumpernickel who comment on what Lewis pretends is an ancient text.

Reviews of &quot;The Lays of Beleriand&quot; have been written by:

* Helen McNabb in &quot;Vector&quot; 128, 1985
* Ray Thompson in &quot;Fantasy Review&quot;, April 1986
* Don D&#x27;Ammassa in &quot;Science Fiction Chronicle&quot;, #80, May 1986
* Thomas A. Easton [as by Tom Easton] in &quot;Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact&quot;, August 1986
* Andy Sawyer in &quot;Paperback Inferno&quot;, #69, 1987
* Eugenio Sánchez Arrate in &quot;Gigamesh&quot;, 12, January 1998 (in Spanish)

The album Oath Bound by the Austrian band Summoning, known for its Tolkien-themed lyrics, contains several songs with lyrics derived from the &quot;Lay of Leithian&quot;.

<text>The Shaping of Middle-earth – The Quenta, The Ambarkanta and The Annals (1986) is the fourth volume of Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s 12-volume series &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; in which he analysed the unpublished manuscripts of his father J. R. R. Tolkien.

== Book ==

=== Contents ===

In &quot;The Shaping of Middle-earth&quot; the gradual transition from the &quot;primitive&quot; legendarium of &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot; to what would become &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is described, and it contains a text which could be seen as the first &quot;Silmarillion&quot;: the &quot;Sketch of the Mythology&quot;.

Three other parts are the &quot;Ambarkanta&quot; or &quot;Shape of the World&quot;, a collection of maps and diagrams of the world described by Tolkien; and the Annals of Valinor and Beleriand, chronological works which started out as timelines but gradually turned into full narratives.

# Prose fragments following the Lost Tales — brief, uncompleted texts which continue on from &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;
# The earliest &quot;Silmarillion&quot; — also referred to as the &quot;Sketch of the Mythology&quot;, this is the start of the Silmarillion proper
# The &quot;Quenta Noldorinwa&quot; — a further developed version of the &quot;Sketch&quot;, the first full narrative since the legends and the only instance where Tolkien completed it. It is notable for having the latest full narrative of the story of Tuor and the fall of the hidden Elven city of Gondolin.
# The first &quot;Silmarillion&quot; map — a reproduction of the first map of Beleriand
# The &quot;Ambarkanta&quot; — cosmological essays, maps, and diagrams
# The earliest &quot;Annals of Valinor&quot;
# The earliest &quot;Annals of Beleriand&quot;

The &quot;Annals of Valinor&quot; and &quot;Annals of Beleriand&quot; show the earliest outline of the chronology of the First Age as envisaged in the early 1930s. 
The next volume in the series, &quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot; (1987), outlined revisions to both texts made c. 1937 as &quot;The Later Annals of Valinor&quot; and &quot;The Later Annals of Beleriand&quot;.

=== Inscription ===

There is an inscription in the Fëanorian characters (Tengwar, an alphabet Tolkien has devised for High-Elves) in the first pages of every &quot;History of Middle-earth&quot; volume, written by Christopher Tolkien and describing the contents of the book. The inscription in Book IV reads: &quot;Herein are the Quenta Noldorinwa, the History of the Gnomes, the Ambarkanta or Shape of the World by Rúmil, the Annals of Valinor and the Annals of Beleriand by Pengolod, the Wise of Gondolin with maps of the world in the Elder Days and translations made by Ælfwine the Mariner of England into the tongue of his own land&quot;.

== Reception ==

Reviewing &quot;The Shaping of Middle-earth&quot; in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, Nancy-Lou Patterson admired Tolkien&#x27;s prose and was especially impressed by Tolkien&#x27;s artwork, as seen in the illustrations of the cosmology of Arda in the &quot;Ambarkanta&quot;.

Tom Shippey comments in &quot;The Road to Middle-earth&quot; that the manuscripts of &quot;Shaping&quot; and the other early volumes reveal Tolkien&#x27;s tendency to &quot;[fiddle]&quot; about, or in Tolkien&#x27;s own phrase in &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; &quot;to be for ever &quot;niggling&quot; [Shippey&#x27;s italics], altering, refining, wavering, according to your linguistic mood and to your changes in taste&quot;. Shippey describes the effect as &quot;at best confusing, at worst irritating&quot;.

<text>The is a high-speed shinkansen railway line connecting Tokyo and Niigata, Japan, via the Tōhoku Shinkansen, operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East). Despite its name, the line does not pass through the city of Jōetsu or the historical Jōetsu region, which instead are served by the Hokuriku Shinkansen. The name instead originates from the parallel Jōetsu Line, which in turn is named after the two provinces that it connects: Jōshū (an alternate name for Kōzuke Province which comprises today&#x27;s Gunma Prefecture), and Echigo Province (modern day Niigata Prefecture).

==Train services==
* &quot;Toki&quot;, Tokyo – Niigata (limited-stop/ mostly all-stations since 30 December 2002) (Although it was first introduced as an all-stations service from 1982 to 1997)
* &quot;Tanigawa&quot;, Tokyo – Echigo-Yuzawa/ Gala-Yuzawa (Seasonal) (all-stations / mostly all-stations since 1 October 1997)

===Discontinued services===
* &quot;Asahi&quot;, Tokyo – Niigata (discontinued 30 November 2002)
* &quot;Max Asahi&quot;, Tokyo Niigata (discontinued 30 November 2002)
* &quot;Max Toki&quot;, Tokyo Niigata (discontinued 17 October 2021)
* &quot;Max Tanigawa&quot;, Tokyo – Echigo-Yuzawa/ Gala-Yuzawa (Seasonal) (discontinued 1 October 2021)

==Stations==
Legend:

The Gala-Yuzawa Line is a branch from Echigo-Yuzawa to Gala-Yuzawa Station. It operates in the winter months only, serving the adjoining ski resort.

As of 18 March 2023, the maximum line speed is between Tokyo and Omiya, and between Omiya and Niigata. The fastest Shinkansen from Tokyo to Niigata is 1 hour and 29 minutes, and 1 hour and 31 minutes from Niigata to Tokyo. Like all Shinkansen lines, the Jōetsu Shinkansen is standard gauge.

==Rolling stock==
 the following train types operate on Jōetsu Shinkansen services.
* E7 series: &quot;Toki&quot; / &quot;Tanigawa&quot; (since 3 March 2019)

Between fiscal 2018 and 2020, eleven 12-car E7 series train sets were introduced on Jōetsu Shinkansen services, replacing the E4 series trains, raising the speed from to . Additional sets were gradually introduced through 2023 for the replacement of E2 series trains.

===Non-revenue-earning types===
* East i (E926)

===Former rolling stock===
* 200 series: &quot;Toki&quot; / &quot;Tanigawa&quot; (1982 until March 2013)
* E1 series: &quot;Max Asahi&quot; / &quot;Max Toki&quot; / &quot;Max Tanigawa&quot; (until September 2012)
* E2 series: &quot;Toki&quot; / &quot;Tanigawa&quot; (January 2013 until March 2023)
* E4 series: &quot;Max Toki&quot; / &quot;Max Tanigawa&quot; (until October 2021)

==History==
The program to build the new line was initiated in 1971 by Niigata-born prime minister Tanaka Kakuei; one popular anecdote is that Tanaka determined the line&#x27;s routing by drawing it on a map with a red pencil. Built at a cost of $6.3 billion, it was built &quot;to establish closer ties with Tokyo and promote regional development&quot;.

Trial runs over the line began in November 1980, and regular service began on 15 November 1982. The line was initially planned to terminate at Shinjuku Station, but economic considerations pushed Japanese National Railways (JNR) to merge the line with the existing Tōhoku Shinkansen line at .

In September 1991, a 400 Series Shinkansen train set a Japanese rail speed record of on the Jōetsu Shinkansen line, and in December 1993, the STAR21 experimental train recorded . The maximum speed for regular services on the line at the time was except for the section between Jomo-Kogen and Urasa which is for E2 series trains travelling towards Niigata. The urban section between Tokyo and Ueno is , between Ōmiya and Ueno is .

The Basic Plan specifies that the Jōetsu Shinkansen should actually start from Shinjuku, which would necessitate building of additional Shinkansen track from Ōmiya. While some land acquisitions along the existing Saikyō Line were made, no construction ever started.

The entire line was upgraded to , with construction starting in May 2019, and finished in 2023. Upgrades included improvements to the soundproofing system. This marks the first time that an E7 series train has operated commercially at more than , which is the maximum speed of the only other line served by this train, the Hokuriku Shinkansen. As a result of the upgrades, all trainsets on the Jōetsu Shinkansen operate exclusively with E7 series trainsets and the travel time on the line is projected to be reduced by 7 minutes compared to the former E2 and E4 series trainsets. The end of E2 series trainsets on Jōetsu Shinkansen services took take place on 17 March 2023 with the streamlining of all services to use the E7 series taking place the following day.

=== Future plans ===
The Niigata prefectural government has proposed building a new multi-modal terminal to directly connect the Shinkansen to the port of Niigata, potentially allowing direct transfers to ferries and cruise ships, and to potentially allow direct access between the Shinkansen and Niigata Airport. However this plan is foreseen to be completed only by the mid-2040s.
==Special event train services==
On 17 November 2012, a special service ran as &quot;Toki&quot; 395 from Omiya to Niigata using 10-car 200 series set K47.

Also on 17 November 2012, a special service ran from Niigata to Tokyo using E5 series set U8, with a special ceremony at Niigata Station before departure. This was the first revenue-earning service operated on the Joetsu Shinkansen by an E5 series trainset.

<doc id="498149" wikidata="Q1987592" url="?curid=498149" title="Pudendal nerve entrapment">
<text>Pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE) is an uncommon, chronic pelvic pain condition in which the pudendal nerve (located in the pelvis) is entrapped and compressed. There are several different anatomic locations of potential entrapment (see Anatomy). Pudendal nerve entrapment is an example of nerve compression syndrome.
Pudendal [[neuralgia]] (PN) refers to neuropathic pain along the course of the pudendal nerve and in its distribution. This term is often used interchangeably with &quot;pudendal nerve entrapment&quot;. However, it has been suggested that the presence of symptoms of pudendal neuralgia alone should not be used to diagnose pudendal nerve entrapment. That is because it is possible to have all the symptoms of pudendal nerve entrapment, as per the diagnostic criteria specified at Nantes in 2006, without actually having an entrapped pudendal nerve.
The pain is usually located in the perineum, and is worsened by sitting. Other potential symptoms include genital numbness, sexual dysfunction, bladder dysfunction or bowel dysfunction. Pudendal neuralgia can be caused by many factors including nerve compression or stretching of the nerve. Injuries during childbirth, sports such as cycling, chronic constipation and pelvic surgery have all been reported to cause pudendal neuralgia.
Management options include lifestyle adaptations, physical therapy, medications, long acting local anesthetic injections and others. Nerve decompression surgery is usually considered as a last resort. Pudendal neuralgia and pudendal nerve entrapment are generally not well-known by health care providers. This often results misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. If the pain is chronic and poorly controlled, pudendal neuralgia can greatly affect a person&#x27;s quality of life, causing depression. 
==Definitions==
Pudendal neuropathy is any damage or disease process affecting the pudendal nerve, regardless of whether said disease process involves nerve entrapment and manifests as pain or not. It is an example of mononeuropathy (neuropathy affecting one peripheral nerve).

Pudendal neuralgia is chronic, neuropathic pain which is perceived along the course of and in the distribution of the pudendal nerve or its branches (anus, perineum, vulva, clitoris, glans penis, posterior aspect of scrotum). Pudendal neuralgia is caused by some pathology affecting the pudendal nerve or its branches. The pain in pudendal neuralgia may or may not be of similar character to other medical conditions which are classified as neuralgia. One potential cause of pudendal neuralgia is pudendal nerve entrapment. In other words, pudendal nerve entrapment is a subtype of pudendal neuralgia. However, symptoms of pudendal neuralgia are also possible without any detectable entrapment of the pudendal nerve.

Therefore, pudendal neuralgia is the neuropathic pain component of a chronic pelvic pain syndrome that is sometimes (but not always), associated with compression and subsequent neuropathy (nerve damage) of the pudendal nerve. In the literature however, &quot;pudendal nerve entrapment&quot; and its equivalent terms are often used synonymously with &quot;pudendal neuralgia&quot; and &quot;pudendal neuropathy&quot;.

==Symptoms==
According to the Nantes diagnostic criteria, the presence of pain is essential for a diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment (although some sources describe the possibility of entrapment of the pudendal nerve causing non pain symptoms, without pain necessarily being present, or not being present initially). Non pain symptoms include bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunctions. This is because the pudendal nerve is a mixed nerve and has sensory, motor and autonomic fibers.

===Pelvic pain===
The pain is located in the sensory distribution of the pudendal nerve. In over 50% of cases, the pain is in the perineum, but may be located in the genital areas (vulva, vagina, clitoris in females; glans penis, scrotum in males). Pain may also be perceived in the rectum. Pain may also involve the supra-pubic region and the sacrum. The pain may be only on one side, or on both sides. Another possible site of pain is the coccyx. The area where the pain is perceived may be influenced by the exact site of nerve impingement, anatomic variations of the nerve and its branches, and also central sensitization. 
The onset of pain symptoms is usually gradual without any single causative event, although sometimes the condition may appear suddenly after some trauma, a long distance trip (cars, planes, etc.), long distance cycling, or a surgical procedure in the region. 
The character of the pain may be burning, aching, stabbing, knife-like, tearing, strangling, or shooting like an electric shock. This is typical of neuropathic pain.
There may be paresthesia (tingling / pins and needles).
Additionally, there may be referred as sciatic pain, or pain in the medial thigh which may indicate involvement of the obturator nerve. Pain may also be referred to the calf, foot and toes. Sometimes, pain is perceived in the region of the lower abdomen, posterior (back) and inner thigh, or lower back. 
Hyperesthesia may be present. There may be a sensation of a foreign body in the rectum or vagina (described as &quot;sitting on a golf ball&quot; or a &quot;hot poker in the rectum&quot;). 
The pain typically gets slowly worse over the course of the day. 
The pain is positional and typically provoked or aggravated by sitting (including physical effort in the sitting position, e.g. cycling), and relieved by standing, lying down, or sitting on a toilet seat. If the perineal pain is positional (i.e. changes with a person&#x27;s position, for example sitting or standing), this suggests a tunnel syndrome. According to one opinion, pain while sitting which is relieved by standing or sitting on a toilet seat is the most reliable diagnostic parameter. Individuals with pudendal nerve entrapment may prefer to stand to get relief from pain. In those with pain on only one side, sitting on one buttock may be an adaptive behavior. Sitting on soft seats may be more painful than on hard seats.
The pain may be intense, chronic, and debilitating. The severity typically varies over time.

===Urinary===
There may be bladder dysfunction such as urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, dysuria, urinary urgency, or dyspareunia. There may be symptoms which are similar to interstitial cystitis.

===Rectal===
Bowel dysfunction may be present such as fecal incontinence There may be numbness of the anal region. There can be pain after defecation; typically minutes or hours later.

===Sexual===
A systematic review found that PN may be implicated in various sexual dysfunctions such as persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD), erectile dysfunction / impotence, premature ejaculation, and vestibulodynia. There may be pain after ejaculation and pain after sex. Additionally, another review that looked at cycling-related sexual dysfunction suggested that cycling may indirectly cause sexual dysfunction by disturbing the testosterone signaling aspect of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis of the body. There may be numbness of the genital area. Numbness of the penis and erectile dysfunction without neuropathic pain may be caused by pudendal nerve compression, especially in cyclists. Compression of both the pudendal nerve and the pudendal artery may be occur and cause erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. Persistent genital arousal disorder has been linked to minimal but chronic compression of the dorsal branch of the pudendal nerve.

===In cyclists===
In male competitive cyclists, it is often called &quot;cyclist syndrome&quot;. This is a rare condition in which recurrent numbness of the penis and scrotum develops after prolonged cycling. There may be altered sensation of ejaculation, disturbance of micturition (urination), and reduced awareness of defecation. Nerve entrapment syndromes, presenting as genital numbness, are amongst the most common bicycling associated urogenital problems.

==Epidemiology==
The exact prevalence is unknown, but pudendal nerve entrapment and pudendal neuralgia are thought to be uncommon or rare. The incidence of pudendal neuralgia was estimated as 1 in 100000 in the general population by the International Pudendal Neuropathy Association (a now defunct patient group). The true number could be higher due to some cases not being correctly diagnosed. Others state that pudendal neuralgia may be over-diagnosed. According to one source, pudendal nerve entrapment is the most common cause of chronic pelvic pain. Pudendal neuropathy may occur in males and females, but is more common in females. It has been reported at any age from toddlers to 90-year-olds. 160 male cyclists who trained for a 540 km bicycle race responded to a questionnaire regarding pudendal nerve entrapment symptoms. 22% said they had symptoms of impotence. 30% reported hand numbness, which may represent entrapment of the median nerve or the ulnar nerve.

== Anatomy ==

===Normal anatomy===

Each person has 2 pudendal nerves; one on either side. The pudendal nerve is a mixed nerve which contains motor (controlling muscles), sensory and sympathetic autonomic axons (nerve fibers). It stems from the ventral rami of the sacral spinal nerves S2, S3, and S4 of the sacral plexus.

The path of the pudendal nerve is very complicated. It passes through the pelvis, buttocks, and perineum. As part of the sacral plexus, the nerve fibers from S2, S3, and S4 unite together to form the pudendal nerve just above the superior (upper) border of the sacrotuberous ligament and the upper fibers of the ischiococcygeus muscle. The nerve progresses between the piriformis and coccygeus muscles and exits the pelvis by passing through the greater sciatic foramen and enters the gluteal region. In this region it passes over the back surface of sacrospinous ligament, close to its attachment to the ischial spine, where it lies medially to the internal pudendal artery and the internal pudendal vein. The pudendal nerve (along with the internal pudendal artery) then re-enters the pelvic cavity through the lesser sciatic foramen into the pudendal canal. The pudendal canal is a fascial compartment located in the inferior (lower) border of the obturator internus fascia lining the lateral (side) wall of the ischiorectal fossa. The canal runs from the ischieal spine to the posterior (back) edge of the ischiopubic ramus. According to one report, the pudendal nerve is fixed to the dorsal surface of the sacrospinous ligament in all cases.

In the posterior (back) part of the pudendal canal, the pudendal nerve gives off 2 branches: the inferior rectal nerve (inferior anal nerve), the perineal nerve. The remaining portion of the pudendal nerve continues anteriorly (forwards) and is named the dorsal sensory nerve of the penis in males or clitoris in females. The inferior rectal branch of the pudendal nerve supplies efferent motor innervation to the external anal sphincter. This branch also supplies sensation to the anal canal, where it plays a role in maintaining continence and allows discrimination of the contents of the rectum (solid feces or gas / flatus). The perineal branch and the inferior rectal nerve of the pudendal nerve supply pubococcygeus and puborectalis of the levator ani muscle (iliococcygeus is supplied directly by S3 and S4). The dorsal nerve of the penis supplies sensation to the penis in males, and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris supplies sensation to the clitoris in females. By providing sensation to the penis and the clitoris, the pudendal nerve is responsible for the afferent component of penile erection and clitoral erection. The posterior scrotal nerves supply sensation to the posterior scrotum in males, and the posterior labial nerves supply sensation to the labia majora in females.

===Anatomic variation===
There is significant variation of the anatomy of pudendal nerve and its branches. Those variations which are of relevance to pudendal entrapment are discussed here. Once formed from the ventral rami of the sacral nerves, there is normally 1 main nerve trunk before the nerve starts giving off its branches. In about 40% of cases there is more than nerve trunk. The pudendal canal is about 4 cm long on average, but it may be in the range 1.6-5.5 cm. The inferior rectal nerve enters the pudendal canal in about 42-90% of cases. The inferior rectal nerve may also arise directly from S4 without going through the pudendal canal. Or it may arise directly from the sacral plexus.

===Potential sites of entrapment===
Various points of potential entrapment have been suggested and reported. The symptoms may differ according to different entrapment locations. Four levels of pudendal nerve entrapment compression were:

* Type I: entrapment below the piriformis muscle (2.1% of cases)
* Type II: entrapment that occurs between the sacrospinous ligament and sacrotuberous ligament (4.8% of cases)
* Type III: entrapment in the pudendal (Alcock) canal (79.9% of cases)
* Type IV: entrapment of the terminal branches (13% of cases)

Around the ischial spine, the pudendal nerve runs between the sacrotuberous ligament and the sacrospinous ligament (posteriorly and anteriorly, respectively), allowing potential compression of the pudendal nerve. The sacrotuberous ligament has been suggested as a potential cause of entrapment, but there is no evidence for a direct functional connection between the pudendal nerve and sacrotuberous ligament, many clinical studies have pointed at the sacrotuberous ligament as a potential cause of PNE.

According to one study of 13 normal female cadavers (average age 82 years), in all cases the pudendal nerve was found to be fixed by connective tissue attachment to the dorsal surface of the sacrospinous ligament, and also fixed within the pudendal canal. It was reported that pulling on the nerve within in the pudendal canal did not result in movement of the portion of the nerve in the pelvis, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. While cautioning of the limitations of making conclusions based on cadavers (tissue deterioration, absence of muscular tone), the researchers suggested that nerve entrapment may not be the actual reason for pudendal neuralgia, and that the diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment may be overestimated.

==Causes==
This section lists the causes and risk factors for pudendal neuropathy, pudendal neuralgia, and pudendal nerve entrapment. Pudendal nerve entrapment is thought to be the most common cause of pudendal neuralgia. Others state that traction neuropathy (nerve damage resulting from stretching) is the most common cause of pudendal neuralgia rather than entrapment. Pudendal neuropathy (nerve damage) is most commonly associated with childbirth (prolonged second stage of labor) and chronic straining (e.g. constipation).

===Trauma from childbirth===
Vaginal birth may lead to pudendal nerve damage. Childbirth causes stretching of the pelvic muscles and the pudendal nerve. The pudendal nerve may sustain irreversible injury if it is stretched more than 12% of its original length. The nerve is especially vulnerable to stretch damage during childbirth because of the course of the nerve, as it runs in close proximity to pelvic muscles (piriformis and coccygeus) and ligaments, before exiting and then re-entering the pelvic cavity. The damage is likely to occur at the exit from the pudendal canal, because the course of the nerve is relatively fixed at this point. Stretching occurs during delivery, especially from the child&#x27;s head. The risk increases when delivering larger-than-average babies or with prolonged (especially second stage) or difficult labour. The risk of damage to the pudendal nerve is also higher if obstetrical forceps are used. 60% of females who sustained obstetric tears were demonstrated to also have pudendal nerve damage.

===Surgical trauma===
Surgical procedures in the pelvic region may cause damage to the pudendal nerve. Pudendal nerve injury has been reported in obstetric, perineal, and colorectal procedures. Individuals with atypical pelvic anatomy are at higher risk of development of pudendal neuralgia after pelvic surgery. Specific examples of procedures which have been reported to cause pudendal nerve injury include:

* Caesarean section
* Procedures for pelvic organ prolapse
* Radical prostatectomy, exploratory surgeries, 
* Procedures to remove tumors.
* Sacrospinous colpopexy (sacrospinous ligament fixation), which is a procedure used to surgically correct recurrent vaginal vault prolapse. The procedure involves placement of sutures between the vagina and the sacrospinous ligament. Incorrect placement may compress the pudendal nerve and lead to pain in the perineum and buttock region.
* Mid-urethral sling surgery.
* Hysterectomy.
* Anterior colporrhaphy.
* Surgery involving the hemorrhoid cushions. 
* Laparoscopy.
* Hip surgery (e.g. hip arthroscopy). This may be due to the patient being in one position for a prolonged period.
* Transvaginal or transobturator tapes (used for urinary stress incontinence).

Surgical procedures which aim to correct prolapse of pelvic organs is reported to be the most common cause of pudendal neuralgia. The risk is higher if mesh is used. In some cases, subsequent removal of the mesh resulted in improvement in pain symptoms. The nerve may also be traumatized during a posterior sciatic nerve block.

===Cycling and other sports===
PNE can develop in cyclists; likely due to both the compression and stretching of the pudendal nerve for prolonged time. Heavy and prolonged cycling, especially if an inappropriately shaped or incorrectly positioned bicycle seat is used, may eventually thicken the sacrotuberous and/or sacrospinous ligaments and trap the nerve between them, resulting in PNE.

Other sport activities which involve repetitive hip flexion may also be involved, for example, exercising, jogging, etc. Horse riding has also been reported to cause pudendal nerve entrapment.

===Prolonged sitting===
People whose professions involve prolonged sitting are at risk. Examples include programmers, office workers, concert pianists, drivers, etc.

===Other direct trauma===
Trauma not related to pelvic surgery, such as falls or road traffic accidents, may cause pudendal neuralgia. Scar tissue may also compress the nerve.

===Other causes===
Chronic straining due to constipation may stretch the pudendal nerve and cause pudendal neuralgia. Descending perineum syndrome is associated with stretching of the pudendal nerve by up to 20%, causing neuropathy. Radiotherapy for cancers of the pelvic region may also be implicated (eg, prostate cancer, rectal cancer, or gynecological cancer). Radiation may cause damage to the blood supply of the nerve.

Other, infrequent causes of pudendal neuralgia are viral infections (HIV, herpes zoster or herpes simplex), multiple sclerosis, inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, proctalgia fugax, pelvic floor spasm, and diabetes. Postherpetic neuralgia, which is persistent pain due to nerve damage after shingles, is another possible cause. Benign tumors originating immediately adjacent to the nerve pathway or within the nerve tissue itself may also result in pudendal neuralgia. A malignant tumor (cancer) in another part of the body may metastasize (spread) to involve the nerve or the area around it. Tarlov cysts may also compress nerve roots and cause pudendal neuralgia.

Psychological stress, while not a cause by itself, is known to be a significant aggravating factor in neuropathic pain conditions such as pudendal neuralgia.

Anatomic abnormalities can result in PNE due to the pudendal nerve being fused to different parts of the anatomy, or trapped between the sacrotuberous and sacrospinalis ligaments. Pelvic trauma can also cause pudendal neuralgia.

== Pathophysiology ==

Prolonged pressure on the pudendal nerve and chronic traction (stretching) injuries interrupt the normal microvasculature (blood supply via small blood vessels) of the pudendal nerve, triggering a cascade of physiological changes. Firstly, there is a breakdown of the blood-nerve barrier. Secondly, edema and connective tissue changes occur. This is followed by diffuse demyelination, and finally by Wallerian degeneration. In the acute form, a metabolic block by an impaired blood supply will interrupt normal function of the pudendal nerve. In the chronic form, neuropraxia and axonmetesis (Sunderland type 1 and 2) injuries will create positive symptoms (e.g. pain and paresthesias) and negative symptoms (loss of sensation). The damage is cumulative.

Repetitive overuse of pelvic floor muscles may lead to remodeling of the bone in the region of the ischial spine and the inferior lateral angle of the sacrum.

Neuropathy (nerve damage) that is caused by stretching is not typically painful, but it may be only mildly painful.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment is based on the medical history, clinical examination and a positive result of the injection test. There are no specific clinical signs or complementary test results. The only 100% certain confirmation of pudendal nerve entrapment is direct observation of the entrapped nerve during a surgical procedure, followed by subsequent pain relief after surgical correction. Even then, the placebo effect of the surgery, which may be significant, may result in the patient reporting a temporary improvement of symptoms that are, in reality, unrelated to entrapment.

===Diagnostic pudendal nerve block===
A pudendal nerve block will temporarily remove or reduce the pain, although it is not considered diagnostic on its own because many other disease processes apart from entrapment can cause pain in the anatomic region of the pudendal nerve. Infiltration is usually near the ischial spine. The duration of pain relief from pudendal nerve block is different depending on the individual.

===Imaging===
There are no specific and consistent radiological findings in patients with PNE. Imaging cannot be used as evidence of a diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment, but may be helpful to exclude other conditions (see: differential diagnosis).

Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are sometimes used. In people with unilateral pudendal entrapment in the pudendal canal, it is typical to see asymmetric swelling and hyperintensity affecting the pudendal neurovascular bundle. The appearance on MRI may also be normal in pudendal neuralgia.

High-frequency ultrasonography may help to locate the site of compression. On the ultrasound, compressed nerves and accompanying veins appear flat. Inflamed nerves appear edematous.

Doppler ultrasonography, which measures flow in blood vessels, may also help detect nerve entrapment. The pudendal nerve is accompanied by the internal pudendal artery and the internal pudendal vein in the pudendal neurovascular bundle. It is assumed that if the nerve is compressed, then the vein will also be under compression. Doppler ultrasound may detect this.

===Other diagnostic tests===
Other diagnostic tests that are sometimes used are:

* Perineal electroneuromyography (not specific for diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment).
* Quantitative sensory threshold testing to detect the inability to sense temperature changes.
* Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency test, an invasive diagnostic test that involves a rectal or vaginal exam. In many individuals with pudendal neuralgia will have normal a latency time on this test. 
* Tinel&#x27;s sign 
* Palpation of the ischial spine may produce pain.

=== Nantes diagnostic criteria ===
In 2008, a multidisciplinary group in Nantes, France developed a set of diagnostic criteria (the &quot;Nantes Criteria&quot;) to serve as a guide in diagnosing pudendal neuralgia caused by pudendal nerve entrapment. It consists of inclusions, exclusions, and complementary characteristics of the syndrome. There are 5 inclusion criteria, which are essential features for diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment:

# Pain located in the area supplied by the pudendal nerve (from the anus to the clitoris or penis). The pain may be located close to the surface of the skin, or be deeper inside the body. Pain that is exclusively located in adjacent areas is excluded, although sometimes pain from pudendal neuralgia may be referred to those areas.
# Pain worsened by sitting, because of increased pressure on the nerve. However, the sitting position itself may not be painful if there is no pressure on the nerve, for example when sitting on a Western-style toilet seat (for a sufficiently long period of time). If there is a lesion pressing on the nerve, for example a benign or malignant tumor, then the pain is usually more continuous, regardless of sitting or standing. Some cases of pudendal neuralgia will not meet this criterion.
# The patient is not awoken by pain during sleep. It is rare that the pain causes the patient to wake from sleep. This is because there is no pressure on the nerve when laying flat. However, the pain symptoms may gradually get worse over the day, and by bedtime there may be pain which makes it hard to get to sleep. Furthermore, associated symptoms, e.g. needing to urinate, may cause the patient to wake up during sleep. 
# No objective loss of sensation on clinical examination. Loss of superficial sensation in the perineal area is more indicative of a lesion at the root of the sacral nerves. 
# Pain significantly relieved by an anesthetic block of the pudendal nerve. This is an essential, but not specific criterion. Pain secondary to many other disease processes in the territory of the pudendal nerve would also reduce after pudendal nerve block (see diagnostic pudendal nerve block).

Exclusion criteria are features which, if present, make a diagnosis of pudendal entrapment unlikely:

* Imaging results that identify the cause of the pain
* Pain is exclusively paroxysmal (it comes and goes in short bursts)
* Pruritus (itching), which suggests a skin lesion
* Pain not in the area innervated by the pudendal nerve

Complementary criteria are:

* Nerve pain associated with extreme sensitivity to touch (allodynia)
* Described as burning/shooting/stabbing pain
* Posterior pain following defecation
* Predominantly unilateral pain (pain on one side only)
* Foreign body sensation in the rectum or vagina
* Tenderness around the ischial spine during rectal or vaginal examination
* Abnormal neurophysiological tests

The Nantes criteria have been described as &quot;standard&quot; in research studies, and &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia caused by entrapment. The Nantes criteria may be useful in assessing the efficacy and effectiveness of treatments for pudendal nerve entrapment.

The Nantes group stated that they had deliberately created a limited list of simple diagnostic criteria in order to prevent other conditions being incorrectly diagnosed as pudendal nerve entrapment. They claimed that the rate of diagnosis of entrapment was excessive, and that doctors were treating entrapment as a default diagnosis for any pelvic, perineal, or buttock pain which was worsened by sitting. The group stated that the diagnostic criteria were therefore inevitably overly simplistic in nature, and would not cover all clinical situations as the condition is complex and symptoms are multiple and variable. They cautioned that the diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment would sometimes need to be considered by an expert on a case-by-case basis, and sometimes diagnosis might be appropriate even if the criteria were not fulfilled for that patient. A proportion of cases of pudendal neuralgia will not meet the Nantes criteria: for example sitting does not trigger the pain. Such cases may represent an initial or milder form of the condition.

=== Differential diagnosis ===

Differential diagnosis includes conditions with potentially similar symptoms, such as chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, interstitial cystitis, pelvic floor myofascial syndrome, external compression of the pudendal nerve (e.g. from a benign or malignant tumor, or metastatic lesions), superficial skin infections, damage to the sacral nerve plexus, trauma from childbirth causing stretching of the perineum, vulvodynia, vulvar vestibulitis, coccygodynia, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, piriformis syndrome, ischial bursitis, levator ani syndrome, proctalgia fugax, and inflamed hemorrhoids.

Entrapment of other nerves may give similar symptoms in the pelvic region, such as the ilioinguinal nerve, genitofemoral nerve, inferior cluneal nerve, and obturator nerve entrapments.

==Management==
Treatments include behavioral modifications, physical therapy, analgesics and other medications, pudendal nerve block, and surgical nerve decompression. Most medical treatments are intended for symptomatic relief, such as pain. If symptoms are not managed through this standard of care, surgery is considered. Other treatment option is shockwave lithotripsy.

===Non surgical===
==== Lifestyle modification ====
With the help of an occupational therapist, affected individuals may be advised to adapt their lifestyle by avoiding compression of the pudendal nerve in order to protect the nerve and reduce symptoms. Firstly, activities involving perineal pressure which trigger pain may be avoided. For example, cycling, motorcycling, horse riding.

Secondly, to avoid a sitting disability, a seat cushion which allows sitting without direct pressure on the perineum may be used. These ergonomic devices may be described as &quot;orthopedic cushions&quot; or &quot;coccyx cushions&quot;. They are generally available in a round doughnut design (which was recommended by the expert consensus panel), or as a rectangular seat with an area at the back removed. The cushions may have a wedge-shaped cross section which is designed to tilt the pelvis forwards.

Other adaptations include use of desks which allow for both sitting and standing (standing desk), and working from home.

====Cycling technique and equipment====
The expert consensus panel recommended that those experiencing symptoms of pudendal nerve entrapment should stop cycling. Advice about cycling technique and equipment has been published for individuals who choose to continue cycling, or for people who cycle a lot and want to reduce their risk of developing symptoms. A 2021 systematic review of preventative and therapeutic strategies found that cyclists who take precautions in maintaining proper posture may prevent the development of a more severe disorder. It is also suggested that using a wider seat when cycling could prevent damage to the nerve, but more evidence is necessary to show long-term benefit. Other recommendations to decrease nerve compression while cycling include having a soft, wide seat in a horizontal position, setting the handlebar height lower than the seat, wearing padded bike shorts, standing on the pedals periodically, shifting to higher gears, and taking frequent breaks. There are also bicycle seats designed to prevent pudendal nerve compression. Such seats usually have a narrow channel in the middle of them.

====Physical therapy====
Physical therapy (physiotherapy) is often used for pudendal neuralgia. However, as of 2022, there is no research about physical therapy techniques as applied to pudendal neuralgia. There is some research about the use of physical therapy in chronic pelvic pain syndrome. As such, the expert consensus panel recommended physical therapy for pudendal nerve entrapment when it is associated with myofascial syndromes affecting levator ani, or the piriformis or obturator inturnus muscles. Techniques which aim to relax the muscles are favored. If there is hypertonia of levator ani (i.e., if the pelvic floor is &quot;too tight&quot;), endocavital maneuvers were recommended by the expert consensus panel.

Mobilization of the nerves and muscles in the pelvic region is a proposed way to treat symptoms associated with a nerve entrapment. An example of this is neural mobilization. The goal of neural mobilization is to restore the functionality of the nerve and muscles through a variety of exercises involving the lower extremities. Exercises to specifically target the pudendal nerve would be determined based on the anatomical layout of the nerve. It is important to note that evidence is limited to show support for this therapy.

Another possible treatment for nerve entrapments in the pelvic region would be stretching and strengthening exercises. A treatment plan would be determined by a physical therapist to specifically manipulate the pudendal nerve through a variety of stretches. Strengthening exercises may also be recommended to relieve the excessive pressure caused by the entrapment, but there is currently limited evidence to support this choice of therapy.

====Psychotherapy====
There is no research for psychotherapy in pudendal nerve entrapment, but cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and supportive psychotherapy has been investigated for use in vulvar vestibulitis syndrome and dyspareunia, wherein it was shown to have a greater beneficial effect compared to medications. As such, the expert consensus panel recommended CBT as part of the management of pudendal nerve entrapment. Psychotherapy is especially indicated where there are associated psychological conditions such as depression, anxiety, catastrophism, feelings of injustice, kinesiophobia (the avoidance of movement because of fear of pain), post-traumatic stress disorder, perfectionism, hypervigilance, sexual dysfunction and lack of motivation for change. Other methods that may be helpful are hypnotherapy, meditation, sophrology, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing.

====Oral medications====
Based on many studies on the pharmaceutical management of neuropathic pain in general, the expert consensus recommended a low and progressive dose of a tricyclic antidepressant medication such as Amitriptyline, or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor such as Duloxetine, or an anti-epileptic such as Gabapentin. Another medication which has been used for pudendal neuralgia is Palmitoylethanolamide. Monotherapy is recommended rather than polypharmacy. That is, using only one medication rather than a combination of different medications. The choice of medications also depends on medication history and side effects. Use of opiate pain killers is discouraged because of the risk of opiate addiction and side effects.

====Therapeutic pudendal nerve block====

As discussed previously, pudendal nerve block is used as a diagnostic test for pudendal nerve entrapment. If the pain is relieved, this could mean that the origin of the pain is the pudendal nerve. However, pudendal nerve blocks are sometimes used as a long-term treatment, rather than as a one-time diagnostic test.

Long-acting local anesthetic is used (e.g. bupivacaine hydrochloride). Sometimes a corticosteroid (e.g. methylprednisolone) is injected with the local anesthetic. Injections may be guided by CT or ultrasound. A pudendal nerve block can be inserted from several different anatomical locations including: transvaginal, transperitoneal, and perirectal. A reduction in pain following this injection is typically felt quickly. The most common side effect of a pudendal nerve block is injection site irritation. Relief from chronic pain may be achieved through this procedure due to the reduced inflammation from the steroid medication, and steroid-induced fat necrosis which may reduce inflammation around the nerve, thereby reducing pressure on the pudendal nerve. This treatment may alleviate symptoms for up to 73% of people. Treatment of pudendal nerve entrapment by nerve block is not often prescribed due to discomfort as well as the risk of injuring critical structures. Repeated injection at intervals of 3–4 weeks has been suggested.

The expert consensus panel found no evidence for the use of pudendal nerve blocks as a treatment modality, either with corticosteroid or as local anesthetic alone. Therefore, they recommended using such injections as a diagnostic test only. However, they stated that in those cases where the initial injection gave pain relief for several weeks, repeated injections may be suitable as a long term treatment. Pudendal nerve block injections may also be useful to highlight which patients might benefit from surgery.

====Neuromodulation (non surgical techniques)====
Neuromodulation is alteration of nerve activity through targeted delivery of a stimulus (usually electrical stimulation). Electrical stimulation of nerves has been used to treat chronic pain conditions. The mechanism of action is thought to be via the gate control theory, wherein there is stimulation of larger myelinated afferent nerve fibers and inhibition of nerve conduction in smaller nociceptive fibers (nerve fibers which detect pain). However, newer methods of neuromodulation suggest that other mechanisms may be involved.

There are many devices and techniques available for electrical stimulation of nerves. When electrodes are placed on the skin (or mucosa), the term transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is generally used. TENS devices are generally for external use and are non invasive treatments, although the term TENS is also applied electrical stimulation via electrodes placed in the vagina or anal canal. TENS devices may be purchased by consumers and used at home. Other neuromodulation techniques involve invasive placement of electrodes. Such electrodes may be temporarily placed for the duration of the procedure (e.g. needle electrodes inserted through the skin), or more long term surgically implanted devices. Some techniques such as sacral nerve stimulation or spinal cord stimulation require sedation (local or general anesthesia).

=====Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)=====
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) involves application of electrical current via electrodes placed on the skin (or mucosa).
There is no available research regarding the use of TENS for pudendal neuralgia. However, researchers have investigated TENS in chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and reported that it is effective both alone and in combination with other treatment. On this basis, the expert consensus panel recommended TENS as part of multimodal management of pudendal neuralgia. TENS can be used by direct application of electrodes to the perineum, on the penis, over the roots of the sacral nerves, or along the path of the tibial nerve (L4, L5, S1, S2, S3). Electrodes come in different forms: adhesive patches to be placed on the skin, circular penile electrodes, vaginal electrodes or anal electrodes.

===Surgical===
====Nerve decompression====

According to the 2022 expert consensus recommendations, nerve decompression (nerve release) surgery is an effective treatment for pudendal nerve entrapment. However, the panel stated that only patients for whom all 5 Nantes criteria were present, including the pudendal block injection test, should undergo surgery. They also advised that surgery should only be attempted in such patients after the failure of a combination of non surgical treatments. The surgery should aim to release the trunk of the nerve throughout its course (i.e., at all levels of potential entrapment), and to restore the mobility of the nerve.

Nerve decompression surgery is indicated if non surgical treatment options are unsuccessful or provide insufficient pain relief. According to some sources surgery is the most effective therapeutic approach. Some advise that surgery should not be attempted unless pudendal neuralgia has been present for over 1 year, thereby allowing sufficient time to try various non surgical options first. Other sources state that the earlier the surgery is carried out, the better the long term outcomes are. Non surgical treatment measures may used in addition to surgery in order to improve relief of symptoms. Surgery is generally considered to be successful if pain and other symptoms are reduced by at least 50%.

There are several different surgical approaches to decompression surgery on the pudendal nerve. The approaches include: superior transgluteal, superior retrosciatic, inferior retrosciatic, medial transgluteal, inferior transgluteal, transischial entry. and perineal para-anal pathway. The different approaches may be broadly classified into 3 or 4 groups: the transperineal (perineal) approach, the transischiorectal fossa approach, the transgluteal approach, and the laparoscopic &quot;Istanbul&quot; approach. Robotic surgery has also been used for the latter technique. There is little consensus regarding the most effective or the safest surgical technique. Some approaches provide limited access to the nerve. Variation of the anatomy of the nerve and its branches is also common, and this may affect the outcome of surgery.

The transgluteal approach has been the most commonly used approach. It gives good visualization of both the pudendal nerve and the cluneal nerve. The incision is placed in the buttocks, going through the gluteal muscles. The STL is divided. Any compression at the ischieal spine is relieved. The pudendal canal is explored and the nerve is freed from any fascia tethering it. This approach is associated with a larger incision and longer period of hospitalization.

The transischiorectal fossa approach involves placing an incision halfway up in the back wall of the vagina (in females) or in the rectum (in males). Usually the sacrospinous ligament is partially or fully severed to relieve compression between STL and SSL. The surgeon explores the canal and frees the nerve from any tethering fascia. This approach gives visualization of the entire canal but became less commonly used because of its low success rate.

The perineal approach uses a small incision in the perineum between the anus and the ischial tuberosity. The nerve is freed within the pudendal canal.

The laparoscopic approach (Istanbul technique), also termed &quot;laparoscopic pudendal nerve decompression and transposition with omental fap protection of the nerve,&quot; is relatively new. It uses a transperitoneal approach with laparoscopy. The sacrospinous ligament is severed. The inner side of levator ani is divided. The nerve is freed from any scar tissue, swollen varicose veins or fibrotic tissue around the ischial spine and in the pudendal canal. An omental flap is used to wrap around the nerve and protect it from scarring. The benefit of this step is debated. Some surgeons use a heparin solution in the area to try and prevent scar tissue from forming after the procedure. This approach allows for placement of an implanted neuromodulation device at the same time. Usually patients go home within 24 hours of the procedure.

In 2024 a systematic review which included reported outcomes of 810 patients who had undergone different surgical procedures for pudendal nerve entrapment was published. The reviewers included 19 different studies, of which only one was a randomized control trial and the rest were either prospective or retrospective case series. None of the studies were blinded, and over two thirds of them were assessed as &quot;intermediate&quot; or &quot;low&quot; quality, meaning that most of the studies were at high or moderate risk of statistical bias. The reviewers found heterogeneity (reported rates of successful outcome ranged from 22% to 100% in the studies). The laparoscopic approach had 91% average successful outcome (i.e., reduced pain) rate and 16% complication rate, although the average follow up time was less than for the other groups. The transperineal approach had 68% successful outcome rate and 7.8% complication rate. The transgluteal approach had 50% successful outcome rate and 6.1% complication rate. The overall rate of successful outcome of all surgical approaches combined was 67%. The reviewers also found that older patients had lower probability of successful surgical outcome. The reviewers called for more studies with a longer term review period.

====Complications====
Complications are usually minor but sometimes more serious, and include infection (e.g. ischiorectal abscess), hematoma, and bleeding (e.g. from the internal pudendal artery, false aneurism of superior gluteal artery). Relapse / recurrence of symptoms after the surgery is possible. It is not clear why this happens, but it may represent new injuries, inadequate decompression during the previous surgery, or the formation of fibrosis (scar tissue) after the procedure. Pelvic stability may decrease if the sacrospinous ligament and sacrotuberous ligament are not correctly restored, leading to increased pelvic movement. Surgical procedures which involve cutting sacrotuberous ligament sometimes result in thickening of the ligament during healing, which may compress the nerve again.

====Nerve ablation====
Nerve ablation is another surgical option which has been used for pudendal neuralgia. In one case series of 11 patients, CT-guided cryoablation was reported to sustainably reduce pain in 82% of cases over 6 months. No complications were reported.

The use of pulsed radiofrequency ablation for pudendal neuralgia via the transgluteal approach was also described in a case report. After 6 weeks, the treatment was still successful.

====Other surgical procedures====
Injection of autologous fat with stem cells (see stem cell fat grafting) into the pudendal canal via the transperineal approach was reported for 15 patients with pudendal neuralgia. Fat grafting may have some anti-inflammatory effects from adipose-derived stem cells. The fat tissue may also provide mechanical cushioning of the nerve. 10 of the patients were free of pain at 12 months.

====Neuromodulation (surgical techniques)====
=====Percutaneous and implanted neuromodulation=====
Implanted neuromodulation has proven efficacy in other chronic pain conditions. Neuromodulation techniques which have been used in pudendal neuralgia are sacral nerve stimulation, pudendal nerve stimulation (chronic pudendal neuromodulation), and spinal cord stimulation (conus medullaris stimulation). However, there is little research available about the effectiveness of implanted neuromodulation in pudendal neuralgia. The expert consensus panel recommended that implanted neuromodulation may be attempted if surgery is unsuccessful or not possible.

In one 2014 study, pudendal nerve stimulation (PNS) was used for 20 patients with chronic pelvic pain. Both unilateral and bilateral nerve stimulation was used, via various approaches. There were no adverse events reported, but only bilateral stimulation of the pudendal nerve gave statistically significant reduction in pain 4 weeks after the procedure. Another study in 2015 involved the use of pudendal neuromodulation in 19 patients with pudendal neuralgia who had also previously undergone sacral nerve stimulation. 2 weeks after the procedure, 36% of the patients were completely or almost completely pain free, and 52% reported &quot;significant&quot; or &quot;remarkable&quot; pain relief. 90% of the patients reported pudendal neuromodulation as being more effective than pudendal nerve block injections, but 60% said that it was less effective than pain relief medication. Pudendal neuromodulation was also reported as being more effective than sacral neuromodulation. 26% of participants chose to have the device removed after the study.

Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve via a needle electrode placed into the ankle. It has been reported to reduce pelvic pain and manage other bladder symptoms.

One 2013 study reported spinal cord stimulation of the conus medullaris in 27 patients with pudendal neuralgia. 20 of the patients reported positive results with the test stimulation. For these 20, there was an average reduction in pain of 2.9 points (out of 10) after an average of 15 months after implantation of the permanent electrode.

=====Pulsed radiofrequency=====
Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) is an invasive neuromodulation technique involving the brief delivery of an electrical field and controlled heat bursts to tissues via a catheter needle tip. This is sometimes termed &quot;pulsed radiofrequency stimulation&quot; because it does not aim to damage or destroy any tissues. It is a different treatment modality to conventional radiofrequency thermocoagulation / pulsed radiofrequency nerve ablation, a surgical procedure which involves continuous electrical stimulation and increasing temperature around the needle, resulting in destruction (ablation) of tissues. In pulsed radiofrequency stimulation, the mechanism of action is not completely understood, but it is thought to involve inhibitory pain pathways and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6. Since the temperature is maintained at or below 42 °C, there is no Wallerian degeneration of nerves, but temporary endoneurial edema (swelling of the nerve sheath) after the procedure has been demonstrated. There have been concerns about causing motor defects in the muscles supplied by the nerve and deafferentation syndrome.

Multiple case reports have been published which suggest that pulsed radiofrequency may be effective at reducing pain in pudendal neuralgia. This treatment may be used instead of pudendal nerve block injections. Pulsed radiofrequency has been used under ultrasound and fluoroscopy guidance in pudendal neuralgia. In 2014, a study involving 30 patients with pudendal neuralgia and who had not achieved pain relief with other treatments underwent pulsed radiofrequency under computed tomography guidance. 26 of the patients completed the study, and reported 83% pain relief at 6 months after the procedure, and 79% pain relief after 1 year. Another study in 2016 used pulsed radiofrequency under ultrasound guidance for 2 patients with pudendal neuralgia. They reported reduction in pain scores from 8 before the procedure to 2 and 3 at 3 weeks after the procedure. The pain relief was persistent at follow up appointments at 6 and 10 months.

The 2022 expert consensus panel did not recommend pulsed radiofrequency as a first line treatment because of concerns about morbidity and because there is little available research for this treatment in pudendal nerve entrapment.

==Prognosis==
Pudendal neuralgia is not well-known. As a result, there may be misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatments, or it may take a long time before a correct diagnosis is achieved. Affected individuals may undergo various tests and investigations, and over time may seek treatment with multiple different medical specialists such as gynecologists, colorectal surgeons, and urologists. Attempts at treatment may be ineffective at resolving pain. As a result, the long-term, poorly-controlled pain may dramatically reduce quality of life. In some cases, opioid addiction or depression develops. There have been confirmed suicides because of delays in diagnosis and treatment. However, if the condition is quickly identified and properly managed, long-term control of symptoms should be possible.

== History ==
Much of the early research on pudendal neuralgia appeared in France, home of the Tour de France bicycle race. Pudendal neuralgia was first described by Boisson in 1966. In 1981, an American doctor reported penile numbness in a male patient who took part in a 2 day, 290 km bicycle race. After changing to a wider bicycle seat and reducing cycling, the symptoms resolved. The doctor diagnosed &quot;pudendal neuritis&quot; and concluded that the dorsal branches of the pudendal nerve had been compressed between the pubic symphysis and the bicycle seat. Discovery of the connection between compression of the pudendal nerve and pudendal neuralgia is sometimes ascribed to Gerard Amarenco, a French neurologist, who described the condition in cyclists in a French language publication in 1987. By 2005 some American doctors were publishing detailed theories about pudendal nerve entrapment, and treating the condition with block injections of local anesthetic and corticosteroids. Prior to discovery of the condition, such pain symptoms were sometimes diagnosed as psychogenic pain because health care providers could not detect any cause. Diagnostic criteria were developed and validated by a multidisciplinary group in Nantes, France in 2006, and published in 2008. These diagnostic criteria are known as the Nantes criteria. In 2019, a group named Convergences in Pelvic and Perineal Pain organized the development of consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and management of entrapment of the pudendal nerve. A group of mostly French experts in pudendal nerve entrapment discussed and revised the set of recommendations, which was validated and published in 2022. As of 2022, research on pudendal neuralgia and pudendal nerve entrapment is relatively sparse, awareness of the condition continues to be limited, and available management options are highly variable depending on geographic location.

<text>Tweed is a municipality located in central-eastern Ontario, Canada, in Hastings County.

==History==
The Municipality of Tweed is an amalgamated municipality comprising the former Village of Tweed and the former Hungerford Township and former Elzevir &amp; Grimsthorpe Townships. The Municipality was incorporated on 1 January 1998 as a lower-tier municipality within the County of Hastings two-tier governing system.

The post office was established in 1852.

Elzevir Township (formed circa 1869, location of a major gold strike) and Grimsthorpe Township (formed 22 February 1867 during the local gold rush) had been administered as one entity since before 1968 until amalgamation into the Municipality of Tweed.

As of 2004, the total land area was approximately , 30% of which was Crown land. Lakes, rivers and streams account for approximately . There are approximately of roads throughout the Municipality. The total 2004 property assessment for the Municipality of Tweed was $309,000,000. Its composition was 84% residential, 7% farm, 6% commercial and industrial, and 3% other categories.

A primary attraction in the Municipality of Tweed is a vacation destination located at 115 Varty Road, with cottages and campsites along the Skootamatta River, a part of the Moira River system. From 2000, it was managed as Tipper&#x27;s Family Campground, run by the family of Canadian violist, Jayden Tipper. Purchased by the Haid family in 2018, it is managed as Haid&#x27;s Hideaway Family Campground.

Immediately east of the Village of Tweed is Stoco Lake, home to a popular and uncommon sport-fish, the muskellunge or Muskie (&quot;Esox masquinongy&quot;). Stoco Lake is a part of the Moira River system; the Black River joins the Moira River near the Village of Tweed.

The Napanee, Tamworth and Quebec Railway (later the Bay of Quinte Railway) had a spur from Tamworth, Ontario to Tweed; the Tweed-Yarker and Tweed-Bannockburn segments were abandoned by 1941 and the former Napanee-Smiths Falls mainline abandoned in the late 1970s. From the 1880s, the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s Havelock Subdivision passed through Tweed to Glen Tay and Smith Falls. The line was abandoned from Glen Tay to Tweed in 1973 then Tweed to Havelock in 1987. A more westerly portion of the line still runs through Peterborough.

==Communities==
Besides the village proper of Tweed, the Municipality of Tweed comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including the following communities such as Actinolite, Bogart, Buller, Chapman, Cosy Cove, Coulters Hill, Duff Corners, East Hungerford (), Elzevir, Farrell Corners (), Hungerford, Larkins, Lime Lake, Lodgeroom Corners, Lost Channel (), Marlbank, Moneymore, Otter Creek, Queensborough, Stoco, Sulphide, and Thomasburg ( )

Approximately 30% of the population resides in the Village of Tweed, the only urban center. The remainder of the Municipality of Tweed consists of a large rural area which reaches from Wadsworth Lake in the north to Roslin in the south. The Municipality of Tweeds has five hamlets: (Actinolite, Marlbank, Queensborough, Stoco, and Thomasburg). The residents of the hamlets and the rural area comprise the other 70% of the population. In 2004, there were approximately 2870 households.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Tweed had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Populations prior to amalgamation (1998):
* Total Population in 1996: 5,706
** Elzevir and Grimsthorpe township: 854
** Hungerford township: 3,280
** Tweed village: 1,572
* Population in 1991:
** Elzevir and Grimsthorpe township: 781
** Hungerford township: 3,085
** Tweed village: 1,626

Mother tongue:
* English as first language: 95.8%
* French as first language: 0.8%
* English and French as first language: 0.4%
* Other as first language: 3.0%

==Forest fire protection history==

The Tweed Forest Fire District was founded by the former Ontario Department of Lands and Forests (now the MNR) in 1922 as one of 17 districts to help protect Ontario&#x27;s forests from fire by early detection from fire towers. The headquarters for the district were housed at Hungerford Road in town. It was the central headquarters for 21 fire lookout towers. When a fire was spotted in the forest a towerman would get the degree bearings from his respective tower and radio back the information to headquarters. When one or more towermen from other towers in the area would also call in their bearings, the forest rangers at headquarters could get a &#x27;triangulation&#x27; read and plot the exact location of the fire on their map. This way a team of forest firefighters could be dispatched as soon as possible to get the fire under control. In 1958 the -tall Hungerford firetower was erected beside the station. However, in the 1970s all the towers had been decommissioned as aerial firefighting techniques were employed. The Hungerford tower was disassembled in 1996 and placed behind the Tweed Heritage Centre.

==Notable stories==

*Tweed made national news in 2010 when Colonel Russell Williams, a resident of Ottawa who had a cottage in Tweed, was arrested and accused of the murders of Jessica Lloyd and Corporal Marie-France Comeau. Williams was convicted in 2010 and received two life sentences for the first-degree murders. Williams is in prison in Port-Cartier, Quebec.
* On December 14, 2017, a Hydro One helicopter working on a row of transmission towers crashed northeast of Tweed. All 4 people on board, the pilot and three electrical workers, were killed.
*On March 10, 2021, a fire destroyed the landmark Tweedsmuir Hotel. Built in 1886 the hotel had many names and owners but was always a cornerstone of the community.

<doc id="498152" wikidata="Q4117718" url="?curid=498152" title="Program synthesis">
<text>In computer science, program synthesis is the task to construct a program that provably satisfies a given high-level formal specification. In contrast to program verification, the program is to be constructed rather than given; however, both fields make use of formal proof techniques, and both comprise approaches of different degrees of automation. In contrast to automatic programming techniques, specifications in program synthesis are usually non-algorithmic statements in an appropriate logical calculus.

The primary application of program synthesis is to relieve the programmer of the burden of writing correct, efficient code that satisfies a specification. However, program synthesis also has applications to superoptimization and inference of loop invariants.

== Origin ==
During the Summer Institute of Symbolic Logic at Cornell University in 1957, Alonzo Church defined the problem to synthesize a circuit from mathematical requirements. Even though the work only refers to circuits and not programs, the work is considered to be one of the earliest descriptions of program synthesis and some researchers refer to program synthesis as &quot;Church&#x27;s Problem&quot;. In the 1960s, a similar idea for an &quot;automatic programmer&quot; was explored by researchers in artificial intelligence.

Since then, various research communities considered the problem of program synthesis. Notable works include the 1969 automata-theoretic approach by Büchi and Landweber, and the works by Manna and Waldinger (c. 1980). The development of modern high-level programming languages can also be understood as a form of program synthesis.

== 21st century developments ==

The early 21st century has seen a surge of practical interest in the idea of program synthesis in the formal verification community and related fields. Armando Solar-Lezama showed that it is possible to encode program synthesis problems in Boolean logic and use algorithms for the Boolean satisfiability problem to automatically find programs.

=== Syntax-guided synthesis ===

In 2013, a unified framework for program synthesis problems called Syntax-guided Synthesis (stylized SyGuS) was proposed by researchers at UPenn, UC Berkeley, and MIT. The input to a SyGuS algorithm consists of a logical specification along with a context-free grammar of expressions that constrains the syntax of valid solutions. For example, to synthesize a function that returns the maximum of two integers, the logical specification might look like this:

and the grammar might be:
&lt;Exp&gt; ::= x | y | 0 | 1 | &lt;Exp&gt; + &lt;Exp&gt; | ite(&lt;Cond&gt;, &lt;Exp&gt;, &lt;Exp&gt;)
&lt;Cond&gt; ::= &lt;Exp&gt; &lt;= &lt;Exp&gt;
where &quot;ite&quot; stands for &quot;if-then-else&quot;. The expression

 ite(x &lt;= y, y, x)

would be a valid solution, because it conforms to the grammar and the specification.

From 2014 through 2019, the yearly Syntax-Guided Synthesis Competition (or SyGuS-Comp) compared the different algorithms for program synthesis in a competitive event. The competition used a standardized input format, SyGuS-IF, based on SMT-Lib 2. For example, the following SyGuS-IF encodes the problem of synthesizing the maximum of two integers (as presented above):

 (set-logic LIA)
 (synth-fun f ((x Int) (y Int)) Int
 ((i Int) (c Int) (b Bool))
 ((i Int (c x y (+ i i) (ite b i i)))
 (c Int (0 1))
 (b Bool ((&lt;= i i)))))
 (declare-var x Int)
 (declare-var y Int)
 (constraint (&gt;= (f x y) x))
 (constraint (&gt;= (f x y) y))
 (constraint (or (= (f x y) x) (= (f x y) y)))
 (check-synth)

A compliant solver might return the following output:

 ((define-fun f ((x Int) (y Int)) Int (ite (&lt;= x y) y x)))

=== Counter-example guided inductive synthesis ===

Counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) is an effective approach to building sound program synthesizers. CEGIS involves the interplay of two components: a &quot;generator&quot; which generates candidate programs, and a &quot;verifier&quot; which checks whether the candidates satisfy the specification.

Given a set of inputs , a set of possible programs , and a specification , the goal of program synthesis is to find a program in such that for all inputs in , (, ) holds. CEGIS is parameterized over a generator and a verifier:

* The &quot;generator&quot; takes a set of inputs , and outputs a candidate program that is correct on all the inputs in , that is, a candidate such that for all inputs in , (, ) holds.
* The &quot;verifier&quot; takes a candidate program and returns &quot;true&quot; if the program satisfies on all inputs, and otherwise returns a &quot;counterexample&quot;, that is, an input in such that (, ) fails.

CEGIS runs the generator and verifier run in a loop, accumulating counter-examples:

 algorithm cegis is
 input: Program generator &quot;generate&quot;,
 verifier &quot;verify&quot;,
 specification &quot;spec&quot;,
 output: Program that satisfies &quot;spec&quot;, or failure
 &quot;inputs&quot; := empty set
 loop
 &quot;candidate&quot; := &quot;generate&quot;(&quot;spec&quot;, &quot;inputs&quot;)
 if &quot;verify&quot;(&quot;spec&quot;, &quot;candidate&quot;) then
 return &quot;candidate&quot;
 else &quot;verify&quot; yields a counterexample &quot;e&quot;
 add &quot;e&quot; to &quot;inputs&quot;
 end if

Implementations of CEGIS typically use SMT solvers as verifiers.

CEGIS was inspired by counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR).

== The framework of Manna and Waldinger ==
The framework of Manna and Waldinger, published in 1980, starts from a user-given first-order specification formula. For that formula, a proof is constructed, thereby also synthesizing a functional program from unifying substitutions.

The framework is presented in a table layout, the columns containing:
* A line number (&quot;Nr&quot;) for reference purposes
* Formulas that already have been established, including axioms and preconditions, (&quot;Assertions&quot;)
* Formulas still to be proven, including postconditions, (&quot;Goals&quot;),
* Terms denoting a valid output value (&quot;Program&quot;)
* A justification for the current line (&quot;Origin&quot;)
Initially, background knowledge, pre-conditions, and post-conditions are entered into the table. After that, appropriate proof rules are applied manually. The framework has been designed to enhance human readability of intermediate formulas: contrary to classical resolution, it does not require clausal normal form, but allows one to reason with formulas of arbitrary structure and containing any junctors (&quot;non-clausal resolution&quot;). The proof is complete when formula_1 has been derived in the &quot;Goals&quot; column, or, equivalently, formula_2 in the &quot;Assertions&quot; column. Programs obtained by this approach are guaranteed to satisfy the specification formula started from; in this sense they are &quot;correct by construction&quot;. Only a minimalist, yet Turing-complete, purely functional programming language, consisting of conditional, recursion, and arithmetic and other operators is supported.
Case studies performed within this framework synthesized algorithms to compute e.g. division, remainder, square root, term unification, answers to relational database queries and several sorting algorithms.

===Proof rules===
Proof rules include:
*Non-clausal resolution (see table).
:For example, line 55 is obtained by resolving Assertion formulas formula_3 from 51 and formula_4 from 52 which both share some common subformula formula_5. The resolvent is formed as the disjunction of formula_3, with formula_5 replaced by formula_1, and formula_4, with formula_5 replaced by formula_2. This resolvent logically follows from the conjunction of formula_3 and formula_4. More generally, formula_3 and formula_4 need to have only two unifiable subformulas formula_16 and formula_17, respectively; their resolvent is then formed from formula_18 and formula_19 as before, where formula_20 is the most general unifier of formula_16 and formula_17. This rule generalizes resolution of clauses.
:Program terms of parent formulas are combined as shown in line 58 to form the output of the resolvent. In the general case, formula_20 is applied to the latter also. Since the subformula formula_5 appears in the output, care must be taken to resolve only on subformulas corresponding to computable properties.
*Logical transformations.
:For example, formula_25 can be transformed to formula_26) in Assertions as well as in Goals, since both are equivalent.
*Splitting of conjunctive assertions and of disjunctive goals.
:An example is shown in lines 11 to 13 of the toy example below.
*Structural induction.
:This rule allows for synthesis of recursive functions. For a given pre- and postcondition &quot;Given formula_27 such that formula_28, find formula_29 such that formula_30&quot;, and an appropriate user-given well-ordering formula_31 of the domain of formula_27, it is always sound to add an Assertion &quot;formula_33&quot;. Resolving with this assertion can introduce a recursive call to formula_34 in the Program term.
:An example is given in Manna, Waldinger (1980), p.108-111, where an algorithm to compute quotient and remainder of two given integers is synthesized, using the well-order formula_35 defined by formula_36 (p.110).

Murray has shown these rules to be complete for first-order logic.
In 1986, Manna and Waldinger added generalized E-resolution and paramodulation rules to handle also equality; later, these rules turned out to be incomplete (but nevertheless sound).

===Example===

As a toy example, a functional program to compute the maximum formula_37 of two numbers formula_27 and formula_39 can be derived as follows.

Starting from the requirement description &quot;The maximum is larger than or equal to any given number, and is one of the given numbers&quot;, the first-order formula formula_40 is obtained as its formal translation. This formula is to be proved. By reverse Skolemization, the specification in line 10 is obtained, an upper- and lower-case letter denoting a variable and a Skolem constant, respectively.

After applying a transformation rule for the distributive law in line 11, the proof goal is a disjunction, and hence can be split into two cases, viz. lines 12 and 13.

Turning to the first case, resolving line 12 with the axiom in line 1 leads to instantiation of the program variable formula_37 in line 14. Intuitively, the last conjunct of line 12 prescribes the value that formula_37 must take in this case. Formally, the non-clausal resolution rule shown in line 57 above is applied to lines 12 and 1, with 
* being the common instance of and , obtained by syntactically unifying the latter formulas,
* being , obtained from instantiated line 1 (appropriately padded to make the context around visible), and 
* being , obtained from instantiated line 12,
yielding
formula_43formula_44,
which simplifies to formula_45.

In a similar way, line 14 yields line 15 and then line 16 by resolution. Also, the second case, formula_46 in line 13, is handled similarly, yielding eventually line 18.

In a last step, both cases (i.e. lines 16 and 18) are joined, using the resolution rule from line 58; to make that rule applicable, the preparatory step 15→16 was needed. Intuitively, line 18 could be read as &quot;in case formula_47, the output formula_39 is valid (with respect to the original specification), while line 15 says &quot;in case formula_49, the output formula_27 is valid; the step 15→16 established that both cases 16 and 18 are complementary. Since both line 16 and 18 comes with a program term, a conditional expression results in the program column. Since the goal formula formula_51 has been derived, the proof is done, and the program column of the &quot;formula_51&quot; line contains the program.

<text>U.S. Route 71 or U.S. Highway 71 (US 71) is a major north–south United States highway that extends for over 1500 miles (2500 km) in the central United States. This original 1926 route has remained largely unchanged by encroaching Interstate highways. Currently, the highway&#x27;s northern terminus is in International Falls, Minnesota at the Canada–US border, at the southern end of the Fort Frances-International Falls International Bridge to Fort Frances, Ontario. U.S. Route 53 also ends here. On the other side of the bridge, Trans-Canada Highway (Ontario Highway 11) is an east–west route while Ontario Highway 71 is a north–south route. US 71&#x27;s southern terminus is between Port Barre and Krotz Springs, Louisiana at an intersection with U.S. Route 190. For the entirety south of Kansas City, Missouri, US 71 runs parallel and concurrent with the existing and future Interstate 49. North of Kansas City, US 71 runs halfway between Interstate 29 and Interstate 35, which split in the city at an interchange with Interstate 70.

==Route description==

===Louisiana===
The southern terminus of US 71 is located in Louisiana, beginning between Port Barre and Krotz Springs, at an intersection with U.S. 190. The highway follows a northwesterly course through Louisiana, passing through the communities of Alexandria, Montgomery, Coushatta, and Shreveport. From its southern terminus to Shreveport, US 71 has largely been superseded by Interstate 49 - which is eventually planned to roughly follow the US 71 alignment as far north as Kansas City, Missouri. After Shreveport, US 71 follows a northerly course, crossing into Arkansas just north of Ida, Louisiana.

===Arkansas and Texas===

US 71 travels approximately in Arkansas, entering the state approximately north of Ida, Louisiana.

The route enters Arkansas near the Red River, and runs north through the communities of Doddridge and Fouke. Most motorists can now bypass US 71 from Doddridge to Texarkana via Interstate 49. After approximately of paralleling I-49, the route turns west, passes the historic Averitt House and enters Texarkana.

Inside the loop, Highway 71 becomes East Street, passing the Texarkana Country Club and Hobo Jungle Park before becoming Hickory Street in downtown Texarkana. The street is four-lane undivided, passing the Bottoms House and J. K. Wadley House before meeting US 67/US 82. US 71 forms a short, two-block concurrency with US 67/US 82 before turning north along Hazel Street. This minor city street runs northwest to intersect State Line Avenue; at this point, the northbound lanes are in Arkansas, while the southbound lanes are in Texas. While on State Line Avenue, US 71 intersects Loop 14 before U.S. Route 59 joins US 71 at Interstate 30.

From Arkansas Highway 296 north of Texarkana to the Red River, US 71 runs concurrent with US 59 as an expressway. Except for the northbound lanes (which return to the Arkansas side just before the Red River), this section of is entirely in Texas.

The highways re-enter Arkansas (specifically Little River County) completely at the Red River. US 59/US 71 serve as an eastern terminus for Highway 380 upon entering Ogden. Although US 59/US 71 bypass the community as a four-lane highway, the route formerly served Ogden as Grand Street, which as of 2011 retains original 1926 US 71 paving for some of its length. Further north the routes pass under Highway 32, which skirts the southern part of Ashdown. Serving Little River&#x27;s county seat as Constitution Avenue, the routes become a five-lane road with center turn lane which passes within two blocks of the Little River County Courthouse. The routes intersect Highway 32B and Highway 108 before exiting town due north to Wilton. Following the Kansas City Southern Railroad tracks, US 59/US 71 enters Wilton, where it passes the S. S. P. Mills and Son Building, Highway 234, and the Texarkana and Fort Smith Railway Depot. Just north of town a former alignment comes into view briefly before the Mills Cemetery and the Sevier County line.

Once across the Little River, US 59/US 71 passes another former alignment, crosses through Pond Creek National Wildlife Refuge, and runs east of Ben Lomond before entering Lockesburg. A junction in Lockesburg joins US 59/US 71 with US 371, with Highway 24 running west from the junction. north of Lockesburg US 70 joins US 59/US 71/US 371, and the concurrent routes turn west to De Queen. Upon entering De Queen, US 59/US 71 turns north, US 70 continues west, US 70 Business/Highway 41 (US 70B/AR 41) runs south, and US 371 terminates at the junction. US 59/US 71 continue through Gillham and Grannis to serve as the western terminus of US 278 in Wickes. Junctions with Highway 246 and Highway 4 precede the route entering Mena, the county seat of Polk County.

In Mena, US 59/US 71 has a brief overlap with Highway 8, during which the routes pass two NRHP listings, the Kansas City-Southern Depot and the Mena Commercial Historic District. US 59/US 71/AR 8 also has an overlap with Highway 88, although the western end of the overlap serves as the eastern terminus of the Talimena Scenic Drive National Scenic Byway designation. After Highway 8 and Highway 88 have left the route US 59/US 71 run north to a junction with US 270 in Acorn. At a fork in the road, US 59 splits onto US 270 west, and US 270 east begins a concurrency with US 71 northbound into Ouachita National Forest. US 71/US 270 continue into Scott County to Y City, where the concurrency ends and US 270 turns east. US 71 runs north through the forest to Waldron, a town the mainline route bypasses to the west while US 71B runs through downtown Waldron. While skirting Waldron, US 71 has a junction with Highway 272 near Waldron Municipal Airport as well as junctions with Highway 248, Highway 80, and Highway 28. This section of US 71 from north of Mena through Fayetteville (following the original sections bypassing the new Interstate 540 has been designated a scenic byway and the Boston Mountains Scenic Loop.
North of Waldron, US 71 passes through Mansfield and Greenwood before intersecting with Interstate 540 on the south end of Fort Smith. US 71 overlaps I-540 for approximately until it reaches Interstate 40, then follows I-40 to Alma.

US 71 passes through Mountainburg, Winslow, West Fork and Greenland on its way to Fayetteville. At Fayetteville, US 71 continues north to the missouri state line just north of Bentonville, as well as U.S. Route 62.

North of Bentonville US 71 continues another passing through Bella Vista to the Missouri state line.

===Missouri===
In Missouri, US 71 is signed as part of the new section of Interstate 49 from Pineville to the southeast side of the Kansas City metro area. The I-49 designation went into effect in December 2012.

On August 15, 2007, the final section of US 71 south of Kansas City to be converted to a 4-lane divided expressway was opened in McDonald County, between the cities of Lanagan and Jane. In Kansas City, I-49/US 71 is one of the components of the Grandview Triangle interchange. There is a section near Swope Park that has three at-grade intersections. Ample right of way exists on the corridor to upgrade to a freeway, though there are no plans to do so in the near future. From downtown Kansas City, US 71 overlaps with Interstate 29 to north of Saint Joseph. From there, US 71 continues as an expressway to Maryville before angling towards Iowa just north of Clearmont. In 2002, US 71 was four laned from Interstate 29, northwest of St. Joseph to Maryville. From there, until it enters Iowa at Braddyville, it continues to be the only remaining rural two lane section of this highway north of Kansas City.
US 71 overlaps Interstate 70 on the east side of downtown Kansas City&#x27;s freeway loop. US 71 then overlaps Interstate 35 and Interstate 29 for a segment which crosses the Missouri River via the Christopher S. Bond Bridge in Kansas City. It then continues concurrent with Interstate 29 after separating from Interstate 35 north of the Missouri River to just north of St. Joseph, Missouri where it diverges.

An alternative in the design of Interstate 29 called for it to follow US 71 on a more populated route through Maryville, Missouri and Clarinda, Iowa. However the interstate was to be routed along the more direct route to Omaha, Nebraska/Council Bluffs, Iowa and more sparsely populated Missouri River bottoms.

During the Great Flood of 1993, when the Missouri River flooded, I-29 traffic was detoured along US 71 through Maryville and Clarinda.

The four-lane segment between Savannah to Maryville was completed in 2002. It is a two-lane highway north of Maryville to the Iowa state line. The long delay in bringing a four-lane highway to Maryville even as most of the highway from Savannah south to the Arkansas line has been a four lanes for some time was a source of considerable irritation for Maryville and Northwest Missouri State University.

Outlaws Bonnie and Clyde engaged in a shootout with law enforcement officers in 1933 beside the highway at the Red Crown Tourist Court just southeast of Platte County, Missouri. The tourist court (which burned down) was just east of the main exit for I-29 Northbound at the old junction with US 71 Bypass now Missouri Route 291.

===Iowa===
US 71 passes through a rural section of western Iowa. It enters the state at Braddyville and junctions Interstate 80 near Brayton, northeast of Atlantic. North of I-80, US 71 passes through Carroll, where it intersects U.S. Route 30, and intersects and overlaps U.S. Route 20 at Sac City and U.S. Route 18 through Spencer. The highway crosses the Iowa Great Lakes where West Okoboji and East Okoboji Lake meet before exiting the state.

US 71 formerly entered Storm Lake concurrently with Iowa Highway 7 but was moved to a new alignment east of Storm Lake in 1996 to lessen travel time between Carroll and Spencer, the two largest communities on US 71 in Iowa. A business route of US 71 follows the highway&#x27;s former alignment through Storm Lake.

A business route for US 71 also passes through Clarinda on a former alignment of US 71.

===Minnesota===
As is the case in Iowa, US 71 in Minnesota is largely a rural highway. It crosses Interstate 90 at Jackson, passes through Windom, and intersects U.S. Route 14 at Sanborn. It passes through Redwood Falls and Willmar before its junction with Interstate 94/U.S. Highway 52 at Sauk Centre. Around Willmar, US 71 is built to freeway standards. From there, US 71 passes through Long Prairie, Wadena, and Park Rapids before touching Itasca State Park, the source of the Mississippi River. It then crosses the Mississippi and is a major route for northern Minnesota as it goes around Bemidji (the &quot;first city on the Mississippi&quot;) and angles northeast to its terminus at the Canada–US border in International Falls. The route between Bemidji and International Falls parallels the Blue Ox Trail, formerly the Northern Pacific Railway. On the Ontario side, Highway 71 links the bridge to Ontario Highway 71 in Fort Frances, which continues north and terminates at Ontario Highway 17 just east of Kenora.

The Minnesota section of US 71 is defined as Routes 4 and 141 in Minnesota Statutes §§ 161.114(2) and 161.115(72).,

==History==
The original southern terminus of US 71 was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana at the Baton Rouge-Port Allen Mississippi River ferry. This was also the original western terminus of US 190 which continued east from the ferry landing through Baton Rouge, shortly intersecting US 61. US 71 was routed along the Jefferson Highway (pre-1955 State Route 1) from Baton Rouge north to Clarence (near Natchitoches). From Clarence to Shreveport, a more direct route was chosen than that followed by the Jefferson Highway, and US 71 continued north into Arkansas rather than west into Texas.

The current route of US 71 in Louisiana follows or closely parallels the 1926 alignment north of Lebeau. Between Port Allen and Lebeau, US 71 originally followed present-day LA 76 to Rosedale, LA 77 to Ravenswood, and LA 10 to Lebeau, crossing the Atchafalaya River by ferry at Melville. In 1935, US 190 was extended west onto a newly built section of State Route 7 (the Evangeline Highway) with a bridge across the Atchafalaya River at Krotz Springs. The following year, US 71 was moved onto this route, branching northward to Lebeau from its current southern terminus west of Krotz Springs and bypassing the ferry crossing at Melville. In 1940, US 71 and 190 were moved onto the new Mississippi River Bridge at Baton Rouge, bypassing the ferry crossing there. US 71 was cut back to its current southern terminus west of Krotz Springs in 1951.

In northwest Arkansas, the 1926 alignment of US 71 followed Highway 102 from Bentonville to Centerton, then north on Highway 102 Business to Highway 72 southeast of Hiwasse. From there, it followed Arkansas 72 to Gravette, where it turned north on Highway 59 to the Missouri state line. In the 1930s, US 71 was rerouted along Arkansas 72 between Bentonville and Gravette, then north on Arkansas 59. This alignment lasted until the early 1960s when it was realigned along Highway 100 between Bentonville and the Missouri state line. In Missouri, the new US 71 replaced Route 88, which had been defined in 1922, while the old US 71 became Route 59.

Highway 71 has a brief concurrency with Highway 237 before crossing over The Loop Interstate 49 instead of (future Interstate 130) in the southeast part of town.

==Future==
A large section of US 71 through Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana is being upgraded to Interstate standards as an extension of Interstate 49 from Shreveport, Louisiana to Kansas City, Missouri. It will also connect to New Orleans with &quot;Future I-49&quot; signage being posted, but with no construction, as of 2017, being started.

<text>The Slave Trade Act 1807 (47 Geo. 3 Sess. 1. c. 36), or the Abolition of Slave Trade Act 1807, was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom prohibiting the slave trade in the British Empire. Although it did not automatically emancipate those enslaved at the time, it encouraged British action to press other nation states to abolish their own slave trades. It took effect on 1 May 1807, after 18 years of trying to pass an abolition bill.

Many of the supporters thought the act would lead to the end of slavery. Slavery on English soil was unsupported in English law and that position was confirmed in Somerset&#x27;s case in 1772, but it remained legal in most of the British Empire until the passing of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 73).

== Background ==
As British historian Martin Meredith writes, &quot;In the decade between 1791 and 1800, British ships made about 1,340 voyages across the Atlantic, landing nearly 400,000 slaves. Between 1801 and 1807, they took a further 266,000. The slave trade remained one of Britain&#x27;s most profitable businesses.&quot;

The Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was formed in 1787 by a group of Evangelical English Protestants allied with the Quakers, to unite in their shared opposition to slavery and the slave trade. The Quakers had long viewed slavery as immoral, and a blight upon humanity. By 1807 the abolitionist groups in Britain had a very sizeable faction of like-minded members in the British Parliament. At their height they controlled 35–40 seats. Known as the &quot;Saints&quot;, the alliance was led by the best known of the anti-slave trade campaigners, William Wilberforce, who had taken on the cause of abolition in 1787 after having read the evidence that Thomas Clarkson had amassed against the trade. These dedicated Parliamentarians had access to the legal draughtsmanship of James Stephen, Wilberforce&#x27;s brother-in-law. They often saw their personal battle against slavery as a divinely ordained crusade. On Sunday, 28 October 1787, Wilberforce wrote in his diary: &quot;God Almighty has set before me two great objects, the suppression of the slave trade and the reformation of manners.&quot;

On 2 April 1792, William Wilberforce sponsored a motion in the House of Commons &quot;that the trade carried on by British subjects, for the purpose of obtaining slaves on the coast of Africa, ought to be abolished.&quot; He had introduced a similar motion in 1791, which was soundly defeated by MPs, with a vote of 163 opposed, 88 in favour. Henry Dundas was not present for that vote, but when it was again before MPs in 1792, Dundas tabled a petition from Edinburgh residents who supported abolition. He then went on to affirm his agreement in principle with Wilberforce&#x27;s motion: &quot;My opinion has been always against the Slave Trade.&quot; He argued, however, that a vote for immediate abolition would be ineffective, as it would not prevent merchants from other countries from stepping in to continue the trade abandoned by the British. He stated: &quot;this trade must be ultimately abolished, but by moderate measures&quot;. He proposed an amendment that would add the word &quot;gradual&quot; to the Wilberforce motion. The amendment was adopted, 192 in favour, 125 opposed. The motion as amended then passed 230 in favour, 85 opposed. Dundas insisted that any abolition of the slave trade would have to be dependent on the support of West Indian colonial legislatures, and the implementation of laws concerning the amelioration of the conditions of slaves. Abolitionists argued that West Indian assemblies would never support such measures, and that making the abolition of the slave trade dependent on colonial reforms would cause indefinite delay.

Three weeks after the vote, Dundas tabled resolutions setting out a plan to implement gradual abolition by the end of 1799. At that time he told the House that proceeding too quickly would cause West Indian merchants and landowners to continue the trade &quot;in a different mode and other channels.&quot; He argued that &quot;if the committee would give the time proposed, they might abolish the trade; but, on the contrary, if this opinion was not followed, their children yet unborn would not see the end of the traffic.&quot; MPs voted in favour of ending the trade in slaves by the end of 1796, after defeating proposals to end the trade in slaves in 1795 or 1794. The House then amended the supporting resolutions tabled by Dundas, to reflect the new target date of 1796. The motion and resolutions did not receive consent in the House of Lords, however, consideration being formally deferred to a subsequent session on 5 June 1792, where they were never revived.

Thus the 1792 Slave Trade Bill passed the House of Commons; but mangled and mutilated by the modifications and amendments of Pitt, Earl of Mornington, Edward James Eliot and MacDonald, it lay for years, in the House of Lords.

Abolitionists’ numbers were magnified by the precarious position of the government under Lord Grenville, whose short term as prime minister was known as the Ministry of All the Talents. Grenville himself led the fight to pass the bill in the House of Lords, while in the Commons the bill was led by the Foreign Secretary, Lord Howick (Charles Grey, later Earl Grey). Other events also played a part; the Acts of Union 1800 brought 100 Irish MPs into Parliament, most of whom supported abolition. The Bill was first introduced to Parliament in January 1807. It went to the House of Commons on 10 February 1807. On 23 February 1807, twenty years after he first began his crusade, Wilberforce and his team were rewarded with victory. After a debate lasting ten hours, the House agreed to the second reading of the bill to abolish the Atlantic slave trade by an overwhelming 283 votes for to 16. The bill received royal assent by King George III on 25 March 1807. The Act took effect on 1 May 1807. However, had received clearance to sail on 27 April, before the deadline. Thus, when she sailed on 27 July, she did so legally. This was the last legal slave voyage for a British vessel.

All that took place against the background of the ongoing War of the Fourth Coalition. In the last months of 1806, Napoleon had won a major victory, crushing the military power of Prussia, entering into its capital Berlin and there issuing the Berlin Decree, bringing into effect the Continental System whose declared purpose was to weaken the British economy by closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Originally, the French Revolution had abolished slavery, but Napoleon – though claiming the mantle of continuing the revolutionary heritage – had in 1802 taken the reactionary step of reintroducing slavery in the French colonies. Thus, in abolishing the slave trade Britain – which could do little to directly oppose the string of French military victories on the continent – could at least gain the moral high ground against its French foe.

== Other nations ==
By its Act Against Slavery of 1793, the Parliament of Upper Canada in British North America (modern-day Canada) abolished the slave trade, freed slaves immigrating by choice or force, as well as children born to enslaved women subsequently upon their 25th birthday, but did not emancipate existing resident slaves. In 1805 a British Order-in-Council had restricted the importation of slaves into colonies that had been captured from France and the Netherlands. Following adoption of the 1807 act, Britain used its diplomatic influence to pressure other nations to end their own involvement in the slave trade. With the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1810, Portugal agreed to restrict its trade into its colonies; in the Anglo-Swedish Treaty of 1813, Sweden outlawed its slave trade; and in the Treaty of Paris of 1814 whereby France agreed with Britain that the slave trade was &quot;repugnant to the principles of natural justice&quot; and agreed to abolish its involvement the slave trade in five years. In the 1814 Anglo-Dutch treaty the Netherlands outlawed its slave trade, and the 1817 Anglo-Spanish treaty called for Spain to suppress its trade by 1820.

The United States adopted its Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves on 2 March 1807, the same month and year as the British action. It provided for the abolition of its Atlantic slave trade but did not alter its internal trade in slaves, while the American abolition of the international slave trade led to the creation of a coastwise slave trade in the United States. Article 1, Section 9, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution forbade the closing of the slave trade for twenty years, until 1808. The long-planned law was passed a year earlier, and with the economic incentives of the slave trade coming to an end, there was both a spike in the number of slaves being traded and a unification of political factions against the trade.

== Enforcement ==

The act created fines for ship captains who continued with the trade. These fines could be up to £100 per enslaved person found on a ship. Captains would sometimes dump captives overboard when they saw Navy ships coming in order to avoid these fines.
The Royal Navy, which then controlled the world&#x27;s seas, established the West Africa Squadron in 1808 to patrol the coast of West Africa, and between 1808 and 1860 they seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard. The Royal Navy declared that ships transporting slaves would be treated the same as pirates. Action was also taken against African kingdoms which refused to sign treaties to outlaw the trade, such as &quot;the usurping King of Lagos&quot;, who was deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.

In the 1860s, David Livingstone&#x27;s reports of atrocities within the Arab slave trade in East Africa stirred up the interest of the British public, reviving the flagging abolitionist movement. The Royal Navy throughout the 1870s attempted to suppress &quot;this abominable Eastern trade&quot;, at Zanzibar in particular. In 1890 Britain handed control of the strategically important island of Heligoland in the North Sea to Germany in return for control of Zanzibar, in part to help enforce the ban on slave trading.

<doc id="498158" wikidata="Q4816830" url="?curid=498158" title="U.S. Route 171">
<text>U.S. Highway 171 (US 171) is a part of the United States Numbered Highway System and the only route within that system currently located entirely within the state of Louisiana. It spans in a north–south direction from the junction of US 90 and Louisiana Highway 14 (LA 14) in Lake Charles to the junction of US 79/US 80 and LA 3094 in Shreveport.

As its designation indicates, US 171 is numbered as a spur of US 71, the principal north–south U.S. Highway through Shreveport, though they technically do not intersect. US 171 traverses six of the seven parishes along the Texas state line, the only exception being Cameron Parish located on the Gulf of Mexico south of Lake Charles. The route connects all six parish seats as it travels through the thick pine forests of western Louisiana on a wide four-lane right-of-way. The northern half of the route serves as the only major north–south corridor between Interstate 49 (I-49) to the east and the Toledo Bend Reservoir along the state line to the west. Between the metropolitan areas at each terminus, US 171 passes through the smaller cities of DeRidder, Leesville, and Mansfield, as well as the towns of Rosepine, Many, Zwolle, and Stonewall. Along the way, the highway has interchanges with many of the state&#x27;s major east–west routes, including Interstate 10 (I-10), US 190, LA 28, US 84, and I-20.

US 171 was created as one of the original routes of the numbered U.S. Highway system in November 1926. Its only major alignment change occurred in 1937, when the highway was shifted from what is now LA 175 between Many and Mansfield. Improvements over the years have included the paving of the entire route during the early 1930s, the elimination of many at-grade railroad crossings during the remainder of the decade, and the widening of the highway to four lanes through its urban areas during the 1960s and 1970s. Four-laning of the entire route was accomplished between 1990 and 2010 via the state&#x27;s massive TIMED program with the goal of improving safety and promoting economic development along the corridor.

The route carries several honorary designations, primarily that of the Purple Heart Highway in tribute to all recipients of the Purple Heart military decoration. The route has long been associated with the U.S. Armed Forces due to its proximity to at least four military bases active during the World Wars, the lone survivor of which is Fort Johnson near Leesville.

==Route description==

===Lake Charles to Leesville===
From the south, US 171 begins at a junction with US 90 (Fruge Street) and LA 14 (South Martin Luther King Highway), in Lake Charles, the largest city in Calcasieu Parish and southwestern Louisiana. Traveling about east of the downtown area, US 171 continues the route of LA 14 northward along North Martin Luther King Highway, initially as a divided four-lane highway. After immediately crossing over the BNSF and Union Pacific (UP) railroad lines, N. Martin Luther King passes through a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-10 at exit 33, connecting with Beaumont, Texas to the west and Lafayette to the east. The highway gains a center turning lane and an additional northbound travel lane throughout the commercial corridor north of the interstate. Upon exiting Lake Charles, US 171 traverses a strip of wetlands with twin-span bridges over two navigable waterways, English Bayou and the Calcasieu River. After crossing the latter, the roadway remains elevated until reaching the unincorporated suburb of Moss Bluff. A junction here with LA 378 (Sam Houston Jones Parkway) leads west to Sam Houston Jones State Park and the nearby city of Westlake. US 171 maintains a combination of single and double center lanes through Moss Bluff, dropping the N. Martin Luther King Hwy signage as it passes just north of central Moses Bluff. As the surroundings become less developed, the right-of-way widens to accommodate a broad, grassy median.

North of Moss Bluff, a rural area known as Gillis introduces a mixture of open farmland, thick forest, and scattered residential development that characterizes the next to the city of DeRidder. During this stretch, US 171 enters Beauregard Parish and engages in a folded diamond interchange with US 190 and LA 12 that allows a grade separation with the Union Pacific Railroad line. Located in Ragley, the landscaped eastern side of the interchange doubles as a recreational area known as Purple Heart Memorial Park, echoing the official designation of US 171 as the Purple Heart Highway. US 171 proceeds due north from Ragley co-signed with US 190 through the community of Longville, located at the eastern terminus of LA 110, and enters the outskirts of DeRidder. Approaching the city limits, US 171 and US 190 pass the western termini of three rural state highways. The first, LA 394 leads to a recreational area on Bundick Lake. The others, LA 26 and LA 112, connect to Oberlin and Oakdale in neighboring Allen Parish.

Curving west into the parish seat, US 171 serves as DeRidder&#x27;s main east–west commercial thoroughfare. Initially traveling along 1st Street with a center turning lane, the route divides into a one-way pair as westbound traffic transitions onto Mahlon Street. The highway then crosses the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) line into the downtown area, where it passes several historic buildings over the next few blocks. These include the Beauregard Parish Courthouse and an infamous Gothic structure known as the Hanging jail. US 171 ends its concurrency with US 190 by turning north onto Pine Street, an undivided four-lane thoroughfare. From this intersection, LA 27 heads south on Pine Street toward DeQuincy while US 190 continues west on the one-way pair of 1st and Shirley Streets toward Merryville. US 171 remains a commercial corridor until it crosses the Vernon Parish line, reverting to its rural configuration as it closely parallels the KCS rail line. DeRidder is separated by the small town of Rosepine by a short distance, during which an intersection with LA 3226 allows southbound traffic to bypass the city en route to US 190 west. At a point known as Pickering, located north of Rosepine, US 171 intersects LA 10, the first of several connections to the United States Army installation at Fort Johnson. Passing to the west of the base, the highway continues through New Llano and into the larger adjacent city of Leesville.

===Leesville to Mansfield===
In Leesville, US 171 becomes a busy commercial corridor again, initially traveling along 5th Street&#x27;s narrow four-lane right-of-way. Another one-way pair is then utilized as the parallel 6th Street begins to carry southbound traffic. In the center of town, three state highway junctions are encountered in the space of a few blocks: LA 467 (University Parkway) to Northwestern State University&#x27;s Fort Johnson campus; LA 468 (Lula Street) to the historic business district; and westbound LA 8 (Nolan Trace Parkway) toward Jasper, Texas. US 171 proceeds north concurrent with LA 8 and descends below grade to cross under the KCS railroad line. Curving to the northwest, the highway&#x27;s travel lanes converge as it approaches a roundabout. Here, at the northern end of town, LA 8 departs to the east and travels concurrently with LA 28 toward Alexandria, the principal city of central Louisiana. During its remaining in Vernon Parish, US 171 crosses the northeastern tip of Vernon Lake and passes through the rural towns of Anacoco and Hornbeck. Junctions there with LA 111 and LA 392, respectively, lead to points along the vast Toledo Bend Reservoir located on the Texas state line.

US 171 enters Sabine Parish winding gently through the rural hilly woodlands while passing the entrance to Hodges Gardens State Park, the largest horticultural park in the United States. The route proceeds through the village of Florien, where a Boise Cascade lumber plant is located, and into Fisher, its smaller neighbor. US 171 then curves northwest and enters the town of Many, the parish seat. Cutting a serpentine path through the street grid outside the downtown area, the highway crosses LA 6 (San Antonio Avenue), which follows a section of the historic Old San Antonio Road (or El Camino Real) between San Antonio, Texas and Natchitoches, Louisiana. Regaining its wide rural right-of-way, US 171 intersects the southern terminus of LA 175, leading to Belmont and Pleasant Hill. US 171 makes a bee-line to the northwest over the between Many and Zwolle. Served by the highway&#x27;s only business route, Zwolle is bypassed by mainline US 171, which travels around its east and north sides, intersecting LA 120 in the process. Signage also directs motorists onto US 171 Bus. to access North Toledo Bend State Park. US 171 comes closest to reaching the Toledo Bend Reservoir at Zwolle and the neighboring village of Noble.

After crossing over the KCS Railway at Noble, US 171 curves back to the north and intersects LA 174 in the village of Converse. Closely following the rail line once again, US 171 crosses into DeSoto Parish just south of Benson, a point located at an intersection with LA 512. later, the highway makes an S-curve across the KCS line on a high twin-span overpass before proceeding due north into South Mansfield, a small village connected to the city of Mansfield, the parish seat. In Mansfield proper, US 171 follows Jenkins Street and intersects US 84 at Washington Avenue, connecting with Logansport to the west. US 84 overlaps US 171 for a short distance until reaching Polk Street, while the bypassed original mainline route follows the continuation of Washington Avenue signed as US 84 Bus. At Polk Street, signage points motorists onto eastbound US 84 toward the Mansfield State Historic Site, a Civil War battlefield, as well as the former Mansfield Female College, the first institution of higher learning for women west of the Mississippi River. US 84 also leads eastward to an interchange with I-49.

===Shreveport metropolitan area===
As it enters the Shreveport metropolitan area, US 171 begins to approach and eventually parallel the route of I-49, the state&#x27;s major north–south highway. After curving northwest out of Mansfield, US 171 passes the DeSoto Parish Airport and heads through Grand Cane, located at a junction with LA 3015. later, the highway bends due north again and then crosses LA 5 at a junction in Gloster known as Kickapoo. Just before crossing into Caddo Parish, US 171 passes through the town of Stonewall and intersects LA 3276, a connector to I-49. Across the parish line, US 171 crosses underneath the Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the unincorporated community of Keithville. Residential development gradually increases as the highway parallels the UPRR line toward the Shreveport city limits.

US 171 enters Shreveport on Mansfield Road and retains its wide median as it becomes a heavily traveled commercial corridor once again. The highway has junctions with LA 525 (Colquitt Road), as well as LA 526, a major thoroughfare along the south side of town called the Bert Kouns Industrial Loop Expressway. Larger shopping developments line the roadway as US 171 approaches an interchange with LA 3132 (Terry Bradshaw Passway), a freeway loop commonly known as the Inner Loop Expressway. LA 3132 complements the I-220 northern bypass of Shreveport and connects to major interchanges with I-20 to the northwest and I-49 to the east. Some movements between US 171 and LA 3132 are accomplished through a connected interchange with Jewella Avenue, a divided thoroughfare that branches off of Mansfield Road.

Proceeding northward, US 171 crosses over the UPRR line for the final time and intersects LA 511 (West 70th Street). The highway immediately branches off of Mansfield Road itself, transferring onto Hearne Avenue. Its median now replaced by a center turning lane, US 171 travels through a primarily residential neighborhood until passing through a diamond interchange with I-20 at exit 16A. This interchange is located at the edge of the State Fair Grounds, an area which also houses the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum and three sports facilities—Independence Stadium, the Hirsch Memorial Coliseum, and a baseball stadium. US 171 reaches its northern terminus a short distance beyond I-20 at a junction with the concurrent US 79/US 80 (Greenwood Road). Hearne Avenue continues straight ahead as LA 3094 toward a junction with northbound US 71/LA 1 just outside Downtown Shreveport.

===Route classification and data===
US 171 carries at least four lanes of traffic for its entire length. It alternates between a rural and urban principal arterial over the course of its route, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). Daily traffic volume in 2013 peaked at 37,700 vehicles in Shreveport and 29,800 in Lake Charles. The lowest figure reported was 2,200 vehicles north of Hornbeck in southern Sabine Parish. The posted speed limit ranges from throughout most divided rural stretches to as low as within some corporate limits.

Since 2003, virtually the entire route of US 171 has been officially designated as the Purple Heart Highway in recognition of all Purple Heart recipients. The only exceptions are the portion from its southern starting point in Lake Charles to central Moses Bluff, named in 1982 for Martin Luther King Jr., and another in Rosepine named for its former mayor Johnnie B. Hall in 1997. Decades earlier, two markers were installed on US 171 identifying it as a Blue Star Memorial Highway as &quot;a tribute to the Armed Forces that have defended the United States of America.&quot; The first was dedicated on March 17, 1957 at the roadside park in Ragley. The second was dedicated on November 11, 1964 at the intersection with Washington Street in DeRidder.

Additionally, a stretch of US 171, extending from LA 26 south of DeRidder to LA 10 south of Leesville, serves as part of the Myths and Legends Byway in the state-designated system of tourist routes known as the Louisiana Scenic Byways.

==History==

===Original route and early improvements===
US 171 was designated in November 1926 as one of the original routes of the numbered U.S. Highway system. The majority of the route, extending from Lake Charles to Many, has remained largely unchanged to the present day. North of Many, however, US 171 was initially routed along the current LA 175 to Mansfield, where it rejoined the modern alignment into Shreveport. The entire route was also initially co-signed with Louisiana&#x27;s corresponding state highway designations as created in 1921. These consisted of State Route 42 from Lake Charles to Many, State Route 51 from Many to Belmont, and State Route 1 from Belmont to Shreveport. This practice was discontinued when the state highway system was renumbered in 1955.

Upon its designation in 1926, US 171 was generally a gravel road outside the city of Shreveport. By the summer of 1932, however, the entire highway was paved with two lanes of concrete aside from the Many–Mansfield section. Instead, the modern alignment via Zwolle, which was also the northern portion of Route 42 prior to 1955, was being straightened and paved to serve as US 171. The revised route also received two grade separations with the Kansas City Southern Railway line that were constructed in 1934. These consisted of an overpass at Noble and an underpass at Trenton, about south of Mansfield. Completed at the end of 1937, this would be the only major alignment change in the highway&#x27;s history and the only instance in which the paved alignment significantly differed from the established gravel road. Minor deviations, mostly near the highway&#x27;s southern end, included a diagonal cutoff that bypassed a section line road zigzag running northwest from Gillis and the straightening of the route through Longville.

During the mid- to late 1930s, six additional grade separations were constructed elsewhere along US 171, eliminating nearly every railroad crossing along the route. The first was an overpass of the now abandoned Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway just east of DeRidder in 1934. The others were constructed beginning in 1935 as part of a federally funded grade separation program. That year, $3.2 million was allocated for this purpose by a Works Progress Administration program and was earmarked by the Louisiana Highway Commission for 28 separate projects. Those projects along US 171 consisted of overpasses of the Southern Pacific Lines at Lake Charles, the Gulf Coast Lines at Ragley, and the Texas and Pacific Railway at both Grand Cane and Shreveport, as well as an underpass of the Kansas City Southern at Leesville. The overpasses were all completed in 1937, with the Leesville underpass following in 1939. All have since been replaced or supplemented with newer four-lane crossings, except the DeRidder and Grand Cane structures, which have been eliminated due to abandonment of the railroad lines.

===Urban improvements and initial widening projects===
The next burst of activity in improving US 171 occurred in Caddo Parish, where the entirety of Mansfield Road from the DeSoto Parish line to LA 511 in Shreveport was reconstructed and straightened beginning in 1951. Several sections of the original roadway still exist as local roads, now re-named as Old Mansfield Road, that weave in and out of the current alignment. Additionally, the portion from Southland Park Drive to Jewella Avenue now serves as a frontage road to the modern route. The project was completed in 1954 at a cost of $1,921,000. The new alignment also included an underpass of the Texas and New Orleans Railroad line at Keithville, replacing the grade crossing there. In 1959, the final alignment change in Shreveport had US 171 transition from Mansfield Road onto Hearne Avenue to reach its northern terminus, giving the highway its first section of four-lane pavement. Around 1965, two additional lanes were built on Mansfield Road extending south to LA 526. This was roughly concurrent with the opening of the I-20 interchange on Hearne Avenue, connecting US 171 with the new expressway through Downtown Shreveport and improving access to the US 80 corridor east of the city. The highway was then widened southward through the Keithville area in 1967, making US 171 four lanes throughout both the city of Shreveport and Caddo Parish.

The opposite end of US 171 received its first section of four-lane pavement in the early 1960s when the roadway was widened in Lake Charles between the southern terminus at US 90 (Broad Street) and Fruge Street. However, these few blocks of US 171 soon became part of LA 14. The opening of I-10 through Downtown Lake Charles in April 1963 resulted in the re-routing of US 90 onto Fruge Street, and the southern terminus of US 171 was shifted accordingly. The I-10 interchange on US 171 was partially opened to traffic at this time. Its full opening would occur in February 1964 when the interstate was completed eastward to US 165 at Iowa. In the mid-1960s, four-lane sections of US 171 were also opened to facilitate traffic through two smaller cities. In Mansfield, Washington Avenue was widened and extended southwest, improving the routes of both US 84 and US 171 through town and eliminating two right-angle turns. In DeRidder, a one-way pair was used after Mahlon Street was improved and extended eastward, taking northbound US 171 (and westbound US 190) traffic off of parallel 1st Street.

Two further improvements during the 1960s involved new bridges along the route. The first was a replacement of the Anacoco Creek bridge in 1967 with a higher span. This was necessitated by an impoundment of the creek four years earlier that created the recreational Vernon Lake. A more substantial project completed in 1969 overhauled the two most significant water crossings on US 171, the English Bayou and Calcasieu River bridges between Lake Charles and Moss Bluff. The original narrow two-lane spans dating from the 1920s were replaced with four-lane spans on a new four-lane alignment further west. (Though the bridges were demolished in 1973, the land portions of the route still exist as Old US 171, partially as local roads leading to public boat launches and partially on private property.) In 1972, the remaining gap in the four-lane alignment in Lake Charles between Fruge Street and the new bridge approach was widened. Central to this project was the twinning of the railroad overpass south of I-10.

===Completing the four-lane highway===
Since the 1970s, construction projects on US 171 have mainly focused on completing the highway to four-lane capacity throughout its entire length. This was cited by commercial and political interests as crucial for the economic development of the corridor and a necessary step in preventing the loss of economic opportunities to the US 59 corridor in East Texas. Leesville was the last urban area through which the highway was widened, despite the Army personnel at Fort Johnson having pushed the Louisiana Department of Highways for this improvement over several decades. Four-lane segments through the Leesville area were completed approximately as follows: through New Llano and north toward LA 467 in 1975, south from New Llano toward Pickering in 1978,&lt;ref name=&quot;DOTD 1979/80&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; further south to DeRidder in 1981, and finally northward through the city of Leesville in 1982. This last segment involved the creation of a one-way pair using an improved 6th Street to carry southbound traffic and the construction of a parallel railroad underpass. US 171 was further widened northward from Leesville to Anacoco in 1986. Meanwhile in Shreveport, the highway was widened southward from the Caddo–DeSoto parish line through Stonewall in 1981, joining with the four lanes extending from there to LA 5 in Gloster constructed in the late 1970s. The final highway interchange on US 171 was opened between 1981 and 1983 when the Inner Loop Expressway (LA 3132) was completed through the area.

The above projects left two long segments of two-lane pavement remaining on US 171, extending from Moss Bluff to DeRidder and from Anacoco to Gloster. The widening of these mostly rural stretches was eventually accomplished as a major component of the Transportation Infrastructure Model for Economic Development program. Approved by the Louisiana Legislature in 1989 and declared as the &quot;single largest transportation program in state history,&quot; the TIMED program was initially funded from a 4¢ per gallon gasoline tax which allowed an estimated completion date around 2031. After falling far behind schedule by the late 1990s, the legislature approved the first of several bond measures to fast-track the program. The widening of US 171 was divided into 23 projects totaling approximately and carried out between 1990 and 2010. As before, the four-lane alignment mostly followed the established two-lane with minor deviations to straighten various curves in the roadbed. This is most evident between Mansfield and Grand Cane, where the entire route was reconstructed and straightened.

However, more significant changes were carried out in a few locations. A new route through Many bypassed the downtown area, discontinuing the concurrency with LA 6. The neighboring town of Zwolle was bypassed altogether with a new alignment constructed around its northeast side. In this case, the old route through town was retained as US 171 Bus., which was designated in 2008. The route through Mansfield was also streamlined via the widening and extension of Jenkins Street, which benefitted the concurrent US 84 as well. Here, the original four-lane section of Washington Avenue was retained as US 84 Bus. These improvements eliminated all but one right-angle turn along the entirety of US 171, located in the center of DeRidder. Finally, the two-lane railroad underpass at Trenton was replaced by a twin-span overpass located about to the south. The old crossing remains in service as a local road called Old US 171 or Trenton Road. After a total expenditure of $650 million, US 171 was completed as a four-lane highway when a section between Florien and Many was opened to traffic in July 2010.

The latest improvement to US 171 involved the installation of a roundabout at the northern end of Leesville. It was the first roundabout to be constructed in the seven parishes forming the state highway department&#x27;s District No. 8. Located at the junction with eastbound LA 8/LA 28, the junction was previously a signalized T-intersection that was the site of numerous accidents and frequent traffic pileups. Construction began in October 2010, and the project was completed with a ribbon-cutting by Governor Bobby Jindal on August 5, 2011 after an expenditure of $2.1 million.

==Major intersections==

















==Business route==

U.S. Highway 171 Business (US 171 Bus.) runs in a general north–south direction through Zwolle, a town in Sabine Parish. It follows the original two-lane route of US 171 before the completion of a four-lane bypass in 2008.

From the southeast, US 171 Bus. begins at a junction with mainline US 171 just east of the Zwolle corporate limits. The route heads west into town on North Main Street alongside the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) line. In the center of town, signage directs motorists south on Obrie Street (LA 475) toward North Toledo Bend State Park. US 171 Bus. turns north onto the same thoroughfare and proceeds out of the downtown area. At an intersection with Willow Street and Old Pleasant Hill Road, the route begins an S-curve that terminates at a second junction with mainline US 171 at the north end of town.

US 171 Bus. is classified as a rural principal arterial by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). The average daily traffic volume in 2013 ranged from 4,200 to 6,000 vehicles. The posted speed limit ranges from through the center of town to near the junctions with mainline US 171 at either end of the route.

<text>Metropolitan State Hospital is an American public hospital specializing in psychiatric care for those with mental health concerns, located at 11400 Norwalk Blvd in the city of Norwalk in Los Angeles County, California. As of August 2016 it had 780 patients.

==Services==
The hospital is operated by the California Department of State Hospitals. Currently it admits four different types of categories for patient intake. The four categories being; incompetent to stand trial (PC 1370), offender with a mental health disorder (PCS 2962/2972), not guilty by reason of insanity (PC 1026), and conservatorship Lanterman-Petris-Short (LPS) Act. The hospital is unique among state facilities serving the mental health patients in that it admits a large proportion of acutely ill psychiatric patients resulting in a rapid turnover rate and a shorter length of stay.

From the 1980s to 1990&#x27;s, the facility had an Intensive Treatment and Research Unit, which was a male inpatient facility for chronically ill persons with mental disabilities, and was co-sponsored by Metropolitan State Hospital and the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine. The program was a major component of research conducted by the two institutions with the treatment focus directed toward the chronically refractory and treatment-resistant patient.

Specific patient programming utilizes individual and group therapy, occupational and rehabilitation therapies and the management of social and financial problems by developing linkages back to the community. Basic treatment services include psychiatry, psychology, social services, rehabilitation therapies, medical, nursing, pharmacy, dietary, etc.

==History==

In June 1913, based on a study by a group of Los Angeles County Psychiatrists who had projected a need for a Los Angeles area hospital, Governor Hiram Johnson signed Senate Bill No. 739 on June 7, 1913 appropriating authority and funds to create a second state hospital in Southern California for the reception and treatment of California&#x27;s increasing population of persons with psychiatric disabilities. Three potential sites for the new facility were considered: Beverly Hills, Signal Hill, and Norwalk. The decision to place the hospital in Norwalk was prompted primarily because of its location, with easy access to good roads and railroad service. At its largest, the hospital had a total of 392.30 acres.

The hospital was self-sufficient in its early days. A dairy, garden, pigs, and cows produced income and food products that could be used by the staff and patients. The farm also kept food costs at a minimum, at a time when milk prices alone had increased from 17 cents per gallon in 1916 to 32 cents in 1918 due to the ongoing war.

As the area around the hospital became developed after World War II and the city of Norwalk grew around it, many changes have taken place. The biggest change in patient care has come from the development of psychotropic medications, increased therapies and new community standards. The hospital has since consolidated its grounds and facilities of tudor styled dormitories into its present .

In 1975, the hospital was the subject of a black-and-white documentary from film makers Richard Cohen and Kevin Rafferty titled &quot;Hurry Tomorrow&quot;, which alleged coercive drugging of patients with the sedatives Chlorpromazine and Prolixin. In December, 1976 The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite ran a story about patient deaths at Metropolitan and Camarillo State Hospitals, and the story featured scenes from Hurry Tomorrow.

==Accreditation==
Metropolitan State Hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission (formerly the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) and certified by the Healthcare Finance Administration. Accreditation is a voluntary process. Medical and psychiatric facilities across the country must request to be surveyed with results evaluated against nationally recognized standards of care.

<text>The Metropolitan State Hospital was an American public hospital for the mentally ill, on grounds that extended across parts of Waltham, Lexington, and Belmont, Massachusetts. Founded in 1927, it was at one time the largest and most modern facility of its type in Massachusetts. It was closed in January 1992 as a result of the state&#x27;s cost-cutting policy of closing its mental hospitals and moving patients into private and community-based settings. The main complex of buildings has subsequently been redeveloped into apartments. The hospital campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places 1994. The property also housed the Gaebler Children&#x27;s Center for mentally ill youth.

==History==
The Metropolitan State Hospital&#x27;s founding originated in legislation passed by the state in 1900, mandating that the state take over care for the mentally ill, which had in some cases only been handled at the local level. Site selection for a facility in the Greater Boston area, where the demand for additional space was the greatest, took until 1926. Ground was broken on the hospital buildings in 1926, and the facility was formally dedicated in 1928, and opened on October 29, 1930. Construction continued until 1935, with some stages under Works Progress Administration supervision. The complex cost $1.8 million and was considered the most modern mental health facility in the country.

The hospital&#x27;s design was reflective of the third stage of development of facilities for the mentally ill, after the Kirkbride Plan and the cottage/colony system. It also reflected the advent of roads rather than railroads as major transport arteries, as it was not located near any railroad lines. Its buildings were designed in the Colonial Revival style by Gordon Robb, with landscaping, based on principles laid down by the Olmsted Brothers, by R. Hayward Loring. At its peak, the facility had a patient population of nearly 2,000. The grounds included the Met-Fern cemetery, a burial site it shared with the Fernald School.

In 1978, Metropolitan State patient Anne Marie Davee was murdered by another patient, Melvin W. Wilson.

The facility was closed in 1992 during a deinstitutionalization movement when most state mental hospitals in Massachusetts shut down and patients were placed in smaller group settings. The property was unused until redevelopment began in 2007.

In 2007, some of the complex&#x27;s residential wards located in the Lexington portion of the property were adaptively repurposed for conventional residential use as part of larger apartment complex development known as Avalon at Lexington Hills. The Administration Building, pictured above, stands in Waltham. A number of the former hospital buildings were incorporated into the new development including the former Kline Hall which now houses marketing offices, Lexington&#x27;s cable access station, an auditorium and a fitness area. A large concrete relief from the medical-surgical building has been installed outside the building as a memorial to the state hospital. The extensive wooded grounds are open to the public and protected in perpetuity from further development. The trails include part of the Western Greenway open space, connecting to the Rock Meadow conservation area in Belmont to the east and, according to plans, in 2009, to the Middlesex County Hospital area to the west.

<doc id="498165" wikidata="Q909960" url="?curid=498165" title="Effective nuclear charge">
<text>In atomic physics, the effective nuclear charge of an electron in a multi-electron atom or ion is the number of elementary charges (formula_1) an electron experiences by the nucleus. It is denoted by &quot;Z&quot;eff. The term &quot;effective&quot; is used because the shielding effect of negatively charged electrons prevent higher energy electrons from experiencing the full nuclear charge of the nucleus due to the repelling effect of inner layer. The effective nuclear charge experienced by an electron is also called the core charge. It is possible to determine the strength of the nuclear charge by the oxidation number of the atom. Most of the physical and chemical properties of the elements can be explained on the basis of electronic configuration. Consider the behavior of ionization energies in the periodic table. It is known that the magnitude of ionization potential depends upon the following factors:

# The size of atom
# The nuclear charge; oxidation number
# The screening effect of the inner shells
# The extent to which the outermost electron penetrates into the charge cloud set up by the inner lying electron

In the periodic table, effective nuclear charge decreases down a group and increases left to right across a period.

==Description==
The effective atomic number &quot;Z&quot;eff, (sometimes referred to as the effective nuclear charge) of an electron in a multi-electron atom is the number of protons that this electron effectively &#x27;sees&#x27; due to screening by inner-shell electrons. It is a measure of the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged electrons and positively charged protons in the atom. One can view the electrons in an atom as being &#x27;stacked&#x27; by energy outside the nucleus; the lowest energy electrons (such as the 1s and 2s electrons) occupy the space closest to the nucleus, and electrons of higher energy are located further from the nucleus.

The binding energy of an electron, or the energy needed to remove the electron from the atom, is a function of the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nucleus. For instance, in iron (atomic number 26), the nucleus contains 26 protons. The electrons that are closest to the nucleus will &#x27;see&#x27; nearly all of them. However, electrons further away are screened from the nucleus by other electrons in between, and feel less electrostatic interaction as a result. The 1s electron of iron (the closest one to the nucleus) sees an effective atomic number (number of protons) of 25. The reason why it is not 26 is that some of the electrons in the atom end up repelling the others, giving a net lower electrostatic interaction with the nucleus. One way of envisioning this effect is to imagine the 1s electron sitting on one side of the 26 protons in the nucleus, with another electron sitting on the other side; each electron will feel less than the attractive force of 26 protons because the other electron contributes a repelling force. The 4s electrons in iron, which are furthest from the nucleus, feel an effective atomic number of only 5.43 because of the 25 electrons in between it and the nucleus screening the charge.

Effective atomic numbers are useful not only in understanding why electrons further from the nucleus are so much more weakly bound than those closer to the nucleus, but also because they can tell us when to use simplified methods of calculating other properties and interactions. For instance, lithium, atomic number 3, has two electrons in the 1s shell and one in the 2s shell. Because the two 1s electrons screen the protons to give an effective atomic number for the 2s electron close to 1, we can treat this 2s valence electron with a hydrogenic model.

Mathematically, the effective atomic number &quot;Z&quot;eff can be calculated using methods known as &quot;self-consistent field&quot; calculations, but in simplified situations is just taken as the atomic number minus the number of electrons between the nucleus and the electron being considered.

==Calculations==

In an atom with one electron, that electron experiences the full charge of the positive nucleus. In this case, the effective nuclear charge can be calculated by Coulomb&#x27;s law.

However, in an atom with many electrons, the outer electrons are simultaneously attracted to the positive nucleus and repelled by the negatively charged electrons. The effective nuclear charge on such an electron is given by the following equation:
formula_2
where
*formula_3 is the number of protons in the nucleus (atomic number) and
*formula_4 is the shielding constant.

&quot;S&quot; can be found by the systematic application of various rule sets.

===Slater&#x27;s rules===
The simplest method for determining the shielding constant for a given electron is the use of &quot;Slater&#x27;s rules&quot;, devised by John C. Slater, and published in 1930. These algebraic rules are significantly simpler than finding shielding constants using ab initio calculation.

===Hartree–Fock method===
A more theoretically justified method is to calculate the shielding constant using the Hartree-Fock method. Douglas Hartree defined the effective &quot;Z&quot; of a Hartree–Fock orbital to be:
formula_5
where 
*formula_6 is the mean radius of the orbital for hydrogen, and
*formula_7 is the mean radius of the orbital for a proton configuration with nuclear charge &quot;Z&quot;.

==Values==
Updated effective nuclear charge values were provided by Clementi &quot;et al.&quot; in 1963 and 1967. In their work, screening constants were optimized to produce effective nuclear charge values that agree with SCF calculations. Though useful as a predictive model, the resulting screening constants contain little chemical insight as a qualitative model of atomic structure.

==Comparison with nuclear charge==

Nuclear charge is the electric charge of a nucleus of an atom, equal to the number of protons in the nucleus times the elementary charge. In contrast, the effective nuclear charge is the attractive positive charge of nuclear protons acting on valence electrons, which is always less than the total number of protons present in a nucleus due to the shielding effect.

<doc id="498166" wikidata="Q876490" url="?curid=498166" title="Chūō Shinkansen">
<text>The is a Japanese maglev line under construction between Tokyo and Nagoya, with plans for extension to Osaka. Its initial section is between Shinagawa Station in Tokyo and Nagoya Station in Nagoya, with stations in Sagamihara, Kōfu, Iida and Nakatsugawa. Following the completion of the Tokyo–Nagoya line, the line will extend to stations in Mie, Nara and Osaka. The line is expected to connect Tokyo and Nagoya in 40 minutes, and eventually Tokyo and Osaka in 67 minutes, running at a maximum speed of . About 90% of the line to Nagoya will be tunnels.

The Chuo Shinkansen is the culmination of Japanese maglev development since the 1970s, a government-funded project initiated by Japan Airlines and the former Japanese National Railways (JNR). Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) now operates the facilities and research. The line is intended to extend and incorporate the existing Yamanashi test track (see below). The trainsets are popularly known in Japan as , though there are many technical variations.

Government permission to proceed with construction was granted on 27 May 2011. Construction is expected to cost over ¥9 trillion (approximately billion USD) and commenced in 2014. 
The start date of commercial service is unknown, after Shizuoka Prefecture denied permission for construction work on a portion of the route in June 2020. JR Central originally aimed to begin commercial service between Tokyo and Nagoya in 2027. However, in 2024, Central Japan Railway Co President Shunsuke Niwa said that due to construction delays a 2027 opening was now impossible and it is not expected to open until at least 2034. The Nagoya–Osaka section was planned to be completed as late as 2045, but the date was moved to as early as 2037 following a loan from the Japanese government.

==Development overview==
===Miyazaki and Yamanashi Test Tracks===
Following the opening of the Tokaido Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964, Japanese National Railways (JNR) focused on the development of faster Maglev technology. In the 1970s, a test track for Maglev research and development was built in Miyazaki Prefecture. As desired results had been obtained at the (now former) Miyazaki test track, an test track with tunnels, bridges and slopes was built at a site in Yamanashi Prefecture, between Ōtsuki and Tsuru (). Residents of Yamanashi Prefecture and government officials were eligible for free rides on the Yamanashi test track, and over 200,000 people took part. Trains on this test track routinely achieved operating speeds of over , allowing for a thorough test of the capabilities of the future Chuo Shinkansen.

The track was extended a further along the future route of the Chuo Shinkansen, to bring the combined track length up to . Extension and upgrading work was completed by June 2013, allowing researchers to run tests at top speed over longer periods.
The first tests on this longer track took place in August 2013.
JR Central began offering public train rides at on the Yamanashi test track, via a lottery selection, in 2014. The train holds the world record for the fastest manned train on this track.

===Routing===
The line&#x27;s route passes through many sparsely populated areas in the Japanese Alps (Akaishi Mountains), but is more direct than the current Tōkaidō Shinkansen route, and time saved through a more direct route was a more important criterion to JR Central than having stations at intermediate population centers. Also, the more heavily populated Tōkaidō route is congested, and providing an alternative route if the Tōkaidō Shinkansen were to become blocked by earthquake damage was also a consideration. The route will have a minimum curve radius of , and a maximum gradient of 4%. This is more than the traditional Shinkansen lines, which top out at 3%.

The planned route between Nagoya and Osaka includes a stop in Nara. In 2012, politicians and business leaders in Kyoto petitioned the central government and JR Central to change the route to pass through their city. The governor of Nara Prefecture announced in November 2013 that he had re-confirmed the Transport Ministry&#x27;s intention to route the segment through Nara.

JR Central announced in July 2008 that the Chūō Shinkansen would start at Tokyo&#x27;s Shinagawa Station, citing difficulties in securing land at nearby Tokyo and Shinjuku stations for a maglev terminal. 

A JR Central report on the Chuo Shinkansen was approved by a Liberal Democratic Party panel in October 2008, which certified three proposed routes for the Maglev. According to a &quot;Japan Times&quot; news article, JR Central supported the more direct route, which would cost less money to build than the other two proposals, backed by Nagano Prefecture. The latter two plans had the line swinging up north between Kōfu and Nakatsugawa stations to serve areas within Nagano. In June 2009, JR Central also announced research results comparing the three routes, estimating revenue and travel time, which showed the most favorable being the shortest Plan C, with long tunnels under the Japanese Alps. The Council for Transport Policy for the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism concluded on 20 October 2010 that Plan C would be most cost-efficient. JR Central announced that one station would be constructed in each of Yamanashi, Gifu, Nagano, and Kanagawa Prefectures.
On 31 October 2014, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism approved Plan C for construction. Construction began on 17 December 2014.

Preparatory work at Nagoya station began in 2016. 
A skyscraper measuring in height was built by JR Central. The structure is named 名古屋駅新ビル (&quot;Nagoya-eki Shin-biru&quot;, Nagoya Station new building) and accommodates a station for the maglev trains in its basement area.

==Construction schedule and costs==
JR Central announced in December 2007 that it planned to raise funds for the construction of the Chuo Shinkansen on its own, without government financing. Total cost, originally estimated at 5.1 trillion yen in 2007, escalated to over 9 trillion yen by 2011. Nevertheless, the company has said it can make a pre-tax profit of around 70 billion yen in 2026, when the operating costs stabilize. The primary reason for the project&#x27;s huge expense is that most of the line is planned to run in tunnels (about 86% of the initial section from Tokyo to Nagoya will be underground) with some sections at a depth of (deep underground) for a total of in the Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka areas.

The original construction schedule from 2013, which called for the Tokyo–Nagoya segment to open in 2027 and the Nagoya–Osaka segment to open in 2045, was designed to keep JR Central&#x27;s total debt burden below its approximate level at the time of privatization (around 5 trillion yen). The schedule was later altered to bring forward the completion date of the Nagoya-Osaka segment to 2037, after JR Central received a loan from the Japanese government.

The first major contract announced was for a tunnel in Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures expected to be completed in 2025. Construction of a tunnel under the southern Japanese Alps commenced on 20 December 2015, approximately below the surface at its deepest point. The tunnel is expected to be completed in 2025, and upon completion will succeed the deep Daishimizu Tunnel on the Joetsu Shinkansen line as the deepest tunnel in Japan. Construction has also started in 2016 on the maglev station at Shinagawa. Being built below the existing Shinkansen station, and to consist of two platforms and four tracks, construction is planned to take 10 years, largely to avoid disruption to the existing Tokaido Shinkansen services located above the new station.

JR Central estimates that Chuo Shinkansen fares will be only slightly more expensive than Tokaido Shinkansen fares, with a difference of around 700 yen between Tokyo and Nagoya, and around 1,000 yen between Tokyo and Osaka. The positive economic impact of the Chuo Shinkansen in reducing travel times between the cities has been estimated at anywhere between 5 and 17 trillion yen during the line&#x27;s first fifty years of operation.

=== Shizuoka Prefecture dispute ===

Construction is yet to commence on the part of the line going through Shizuoka Prefecture, as the municipality has expressed concern about water from the Ōi River leaking into the tunnel, lowering the water level. JR Central expressed concern early on that the delay in construction of the only 9 kilometer long section going through Shizuoka might throw the entire project off schedule.

It is believed by some political analysts that the actual reason for Shizuoka Prefecture&#x27;s apparent concerns of the project is not over the Ōi River, but was merely used as a pretense to force JR Central&#x27;s hand in building a train station on the Tokaido Shinkansen under Shizuoka Airport. Shizuoka Prefecture, being the only prefecture where no new station will be built, has long lobbied JR Central for years for the construction of such a station, with the line running directly under the airport. JR Central has so far refused, citing the close distance to the neighboring Kakegawa Station and Shizuoka stations. If constructed, travel time from the center of Tokyo to the airport would be comparable to that for Tokyo Narita Airport, enabling it to act as a third hub airport for the capital. As the station would be built underneath an active airport, it is expected to open after the new maglev line.

Officials of Shizuoka Prefecture, in a meeting with JR Central in June 2020, denied permission to begin construction work on the tunnel. JR Central announced the following week that it would be &quot;difficult&quot; to open the Tokyo-Nagoya line in 2027 as previously announced. The incumbent governor of Shizuoka Prefecture Heita Kawakatsu was re-elected in June 2021, partly on a platform of continued opposition to construction of the new line, barring further accommodations by JR Central.

Following a series of meetings between JR Central and Shizuoka Prefecture facilitated by the Ministry of Transportation, an interim report was released on the results of the meetings so far in late December 2021. Among other things, the report confirmed that while JR was committed to returning any water leaking into the tunnel once construction was completed, there is no known feasible way to return all of the water during the construction phase. However, it did also conclude that the amount of water leaked was likely to be insignificant.

On 7 January 2022, commenting on the report, the Shizuoka Prefecture governor expressed continued opposition to construction when it could result in water levels going down, even if only during construction. He urged JR Central to re-investigate the possibility of returning leaking water during construction. On 20 January that same year, the prefecture officially called the report &quot;insufficient&quot;, and announced that it still would not allow construction to commence.

On 21 December 2023, during a routine press conference, JR Central’s President Niwa announced an agreement with Tokyo Electric Power Company, the Ōi River&#x27;s dam operator, to diminish the volume of water extracted from the upstream dam. This action aims to address the anticipated impact on the Oi River’s water levels, a consequence of the construction project. The agreement outlines the method of reducing water intake and the concept of compensation. The proposal was well-received and endorsed previously by the local governing council in November 2023.

On 2 April 2024, Governor Kawakatsu announced that he would be resigning after making statements criticised as being insulting towards certain professions. This came less than a week after JR Central&#x27;s announcement that it would be unable to meet its goal of opening the Shinagawa-Nagoya section of the line by 2027. Governor Kawakatsu&#x27;s resignation was met with discussions about whether his successor would approve tunnel construction, triggering a slight rise in JR Central’s stock price.

On May 26, 2024, the ensuing by-election was won by Yasutomo Suzuki, who was called a &quot;Maglev Proponent&quot; by Nikkei Asia. The mayor of Nagoya, a city on the maglev, also said &quot;Mr. Suzuki has a deep understanding of industry, so I think he will get the project done quickly.&quot; Since the election, preliminary work has been approved and is apparently been proceeding well as of October 2024.

== Osaka extension ==
The government of Osaka Prefecture, as well as local corporations such as Suntory and Nippon Life, have raised concerns about the impact of the delayed construction of the Nagoya–Osaka segment on the Osaka economy. Politicians from the Kansai region called for, and received, state-backed loans for JR Central in order to expedite the line&#x27;s construction, resulting in the opening of the extension being moved forward by up to 8 years.

== Construction accidents ==
On 27 October 2021, two construction workers died when part of the retaining wall of a temporary work tunnel collapsed. JR Central concluded that the safety checks carried out were insufficient, and vowed to make it clearer to workers which areas had and had not completed the safety checks necessary to allow for the presence of human workers going forward.

==Route==
The line will run between Tokyo and Nagoya, with plans for an extension to Osaka. Its initial section is between Shinagawa Station in Tokyo and Nagoya Station in Nagoya, with stations in Sagamihara, Kōfu, Iida, and Nakatsugawa. 
The line has one station for each prefecture it passes through, except for Shizuoka. The line is expected to connect Tokyo and Nagoya in 40 minutes, and eventually Tokyo and Osaka in 67 minutes, running at a maximum speed of .

About 90% of the line to Nagoya will be in tunnels, with a minimum curve radius of and a maximum grade of 4% (1 in 25).


==Technology==

The Chūō Shinkansen will employ the SCMaglev technology, a maglev (magnetic levitation train) system developed by JR Central. The levitating force is generated between superconducting magnets on the trains and coils on the track.
The absence of wheel friction allows higher speed and higher acceleration and deceleration than conventional high-speed rail.
The superconducting coils use Niobium–titanium alloy cooled to a temperature of with liquid helium. Magnetic coils are used both for levitation and propulsion. The trains are accelerated by alternating currents on the ground producing attraction and repulsion forces with the coils on the train. The levitation and guidance system, working with the same principle, ensures that the train is elevated and centered in the track.

===Energy consumption===
In 2018, a scientific comparison of the energy consumption of SCMaglev, Transrapid and conventional high-speed trains was conducted. The energy consumption per square meter of usable area was examined in relation to speed. The results show that there are only minor differences at speeds of 200 km/h and above. However, maglevs can reach much higher speeds than conventional trains. Conventional trains, on the other hand, require less energy at slow speeds, with this advantage shrinking or even slightly reversing during high-speed operation. As the Chūō Shinkansen mostly runs in tunnels, air resistance will be much higher than for most high-speed railways, significantly increasing energy consumption.

During normal operating conditions, the energy consumption of the L0 series between Tokyo and Osaka is estimated at 90-100 Wh/seat-km. For comparison, the conventional N700-series train operating on the fastest service-pattern on the existing line between Tokyo and Osaka has an estimated energy consumption of 70 Wh/seat-km.

Despite this increase, the L0 series still consumes much less energy than even the most efficient short/medium-haul modern passenger aircraft. For instance, the Airbus A319neo uses ~209 Wh/seat-km over a distance of 1,900 km. This figure would presumably be even higher for very short flights such as Tokyo-Nagoya, with much less time spent cruising.
Moreover, the operation of the L0 series maglev train is completely electric, making it easier to transition to low-carbon energy sources.

On 2 December 2003, MLX01, a three-car train set a world record speed of in a manned run. On 16 November 2004, it also set a world record for two trains passing each other at a combined speed of .

On 26 October 2010, JR Central announced a new train type, the L0 Series, for commercial operation at . It set a world record speed for a manned train of on 21 April 2015.

On 26 March 2020, the Improved L0 Series started operations on the test track. It represents the completion of 80–90% of the design goals for the final train, and is the first to draw power from the track. Previous models used on-board gas generators.

<text>An enamine is an unsaturated compound derived by the condensation of an aldehyde or ketone with a secondary amine. Enamines are versatile intermediates.

The word &quot;enamine&quot; is derived from the affix &quot;en&quot;-, used as the suffix of alkene, and the root &quot;amine&quot;. This can be compared with enol, which is a functional group containing both alkene (&quot;en&quot;-) and alcohol (-&quot;ol&quot;). Enamines are considered to be nitrogen analogs of enols.

If one or both of the nitrogen substituents is a hydrogen atom it is the tautomeric form of an imine. This usually will rearrange to the imine; however there are several exceptions (such as aniline). The enamine-imine tautomerism may be considered analogous to the keto-enol tautomerism. In both cases, a hydrogen atom switches its location between the heteroatom (oxygen or nitrogen) and the second carbon atom.

Enamines are both good nucleophiles and good bases. Their behavior as carbon-based nucleophiles is explained with reference to the following resonance structures.

==Formation==

Enamines are labile and therefore chemically useful moieties which can be easily produced from commercially available starting reagents. A common route for enamine production is via an acid-catalyzed nucleophilic reaction of ketone or aldehyde species containing an α-hydrogen with secondary amines. Acid catalysis is not always required, if the pKaH of the reacting amine is sufficiently high (for example, pyrrolidine, which has a pKaH of 11.26). If the pKaH of the reacting amine is low, however, then acid catalysis is required through both the addition and the dehydration steps (common dehydrating agents include MgSO4 and Na2SO4). Primary amines are usually not used for enamine synthesis due to the preferential formation of the more thermodynamically stable imine species. Methyl ketone self-condensation is a side-reaction which can be avoided through the addition of TiCl4 into the reaction mixture (to act as a water scavenger). An example of an aldehyde reacting with a secondary amine to form an enamine via a carbinolamine intermediate is shown below:
==Reactions==
===Alkylation===
Even though enamines are more nucleophilic than their enol counterparts, they can still react selectively, rendering them useful for alkylation reactions. The enamine nucleophile can attack haloalkanes to form the alkylated iminium salt intermediate which then hydrolyzes to regenerate a ketone (a starting material in enamine synthesis). This reaction was pioneered by Gilbert Stork, and is sometimes referred to by the name of its inventor (the Stork enamine alkylation). Analogously, this reaction can be used as an effective means of acylation. A variety of alkylating and acylating agents including benzylic, allylic halides can be used in this reaction.
===Acylation===

In a reaction much similar to the enamine alkylation, enamines can be acylated to form a final dicarbonyl product. The enamine starting material undergoes a nucleophilic addition to acyl halides forming the iminium salt intermediate which can hydrolyze in the presence of acid.
===Metalloenamines===

Strong bases such as LiNR2 can be used to deprotonate imines and form metalloenamines. Metalloenamines can prove synthetically useful due to their nucleophilicity (they are more nucleophilic than enolates). Thus they are better able to react with weaker electrophiles (for example, they can be used to open epoxides.) Most prominently, these reactions have allowed for asymmetric alkylations of ketones through transformation to chiral intermediate metalloenamines.

===Halogenation===

β-halo immonium compounds can be synthesized through the halogenation reaction of enamines with halides in diethyl ether solvent. Hydrolysis will result in the formation of α-halo ketones. Chlorination, bromination, and even iodination have been shown to be possible. The general reaction is shown below:
===Oxidative coupling===

Enamines can be efficiently cross-coupled with enol silanes through treatment with ceric ammonium nitrate. These reactions were reported by the Narasaka group in 1975, providing a route to stable enamines as well as one instance of a 1,4-diketone (derived from a morpholine amine reagent). Later, these results were exploited by the MacMillan group with the development of an organocatalyst which used the Narasaka substrates to produce 1,4 dicarbonyls enantioselectively, with good yields. Oxidative dimerization of aldehydes in the presence of amines proceeds through the formation of an enamine followed by a final pyrrole formation. This method for symmetric pyrrole synthesis was developed in 2010 by the Jia group, as a valuable new pathway for the synthesis of pyrrole-containing natural products.

===Annulation===

Enamines chemistry has been implemented for the purposes of producing a one-pot enantioselective version of the Robinson annulation. The Robinson annulation, published by Robert Robinson in 1935, is a base-catalyzed reaction that combines a ketone and a methyl vinyl ketone (commonly abbreviated to MVK) to form a cyclohexenone fused ring system. This reaction may be catalyzed by proline to proceed through chiral enamine intermediates which allow for good stereoselectivity. This is important, in particular in the field of natural product synthesis, for example, for the synthesis of the Wieland-Miescher ketone – a vital building block for more complex biologically active molecules.

==Reactivity==

Enamines act as nucleophiles that require less acid/base activation for reactivity than their enolate counterparts. They have also been shown to offer a greater selectivity with fewer side reactions. There is a gradient of reactivity among different enamine types, with a greater reactivity offered by ketone enamines than their aldehyde counterparts. Cyclic ketone enamines follow a reactivity trend where the five membered ring is the most reactive due to its maximally planar conformation at the nitrogen, following the trend 5&gt;8&gt;6&gt;7 (the seven membered ring being the least reactive). This trend has been attributed to the amount of p-character on the nitrogen lone pair orbital - the higher p character corresponding to a greater nucleophilicity because the p-orbital would allow for donation into the alkene π- orbital. Analogously, if the N lone pair participates in stereoelectronic interactions on the amine moiety, the lone pair will pop out of the plane (will pyramidalize) and compromise donation into the adjacent π C-C bond.

There are many ways to modulate enamine reactivity in addition to altering the steric/electronics at the nitrogen center including changing temperature, solvent, amounts of other reagents, and type of electrophile. Tuning these parameters allows for the preferential formation of E/Z enamines and also affects the formation of the more/less substituted enamine from the ketone starting material.

<text>The 75th Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) took place on March 23, 2003, at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles. During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories honoring films released in 2002. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gilbert Cates and was directed by Louis J. Horvitz. Actor Steve Martin hosted for the second time, having previously presided over the 73rd ceremony held in 2001. Three weeks earlier in a ceremony at Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California held on March 1, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Kate Hudson.

&quot;Chicago&quot; won six awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included &quot;The Pianist&quot; with three awards, &quot;Frida&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; with two, and &quot;8 Mile&quot;, &quot;Adaptation&quot;, &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, &quot;The ChubbChubbs!&quot;, &quot;The Hours&quot;, &quot;Nowhere in Africa&quot;, &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;, &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, &quot;Talk to Her&quot;, &quot;This Charming Man&quot;, and &quot;Twin Towers&quot; with one. The telecast garnered about 33 million viewers in the United States, making it the least-watched and lowest-rated televised Oscar ceremony to that point.

== Winners and nominees ==
The nominees for the 75th Academy Awards were announced on February 11, 2003, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Frank Pierson, president of the Academy, and Academy Award winning-actress Marisa Tomei. &quot;Chicago&quot; received the most nominations with thirteen. It was the eighth film to receive that many nominations. &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; came in second with ten.

The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 23, 2003. &quot;Chicago&quot; became the first musical film to win Best Picture since 1968&#x27;s &quot;Oliver!&quot; At age 29, Adrien Brody was the youngest person to win Best Actor. With her 13th nomination, Meryl Streep became the most nominated actor in Oscar history. Meanwhile, Best Actor nominee Jack Nicholson earned his 12th nomination, extending his record as the most nominated male performer. Julianne Moore was the ninth performer to earn two acting nominations in the same year. &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; from &quot;8 Mile&quot; became the first hip hop song to win the Best Original Song award.

==Ceremony information==
In November 2002, the Academy hired veteran Oscar telecast producer Gilbert Cates to oversee the telecast for the eleventh time. &quot;With ten shows under his belt, no other living producer even comes close to the depth of his experience,&quot; said AMPAS president Frank Pierson in a press release announcing the selection. &quot;Gil practically invented the awards show as a stylistic genre. We&#x27;re privileged to have him present a very special event to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Oscars.&quot; A few days later, actor and comedian Steve Martin was chosen to emcee the upcoming telecast. Cates explained his reason to bring back the veteran comedian saying, &quot;A host who&#x27;s witty, clever, sharp, intelligent, quick on his feet and always on top of the unfolding action. Wait, I&#x27;ve forgotten something. Oh yeah, and outrageously funny.&quot; According to the article published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Cates approached actor and veteran Oscar host Billy Crystal for emceeing duties. However, as time passed and Crystal was still undecided regarding the job, Cates offered the hosting role to Martin. In a statement, Martin expressed that he was honored to be selected to emcee the telecast joking, &quot;I&#x27;m very pleased to be hosting the Oscars again, because fear and nausea always make me lose weight.&quot; In addition, this was the first Oscar ceremony broadcast in high-definition.

The ceremony took place on March 23, 2003, at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles beginning at 5:30 p.m. PST / 8:30 p.m. EST. To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Academy Awards, 59 actors who have received both competitive and honorary awards appeared seated onstage together during a segment called Oscar&#x27;s Family Album. Each former winner was acknowledged by announcer Neil Ross and Randy Thomas with the films he or she won for. At the end of the segment newly minted winners Adrien Brody, Chris Cooper, Nicole Kidman, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, along with Honorary Oscar recipient Peter O&#x27;Toole, joined them.

Furthermore, the American-led invasion of Iraq affected the telecast and its surrounding events. Hours after news that the war had commenced several actors such as Cate Blanchett, Jim Carrey, and Will Smith resigned from their roles as presenters citing safety concerns and respect for military families. Despite pleas from broadcaster ABC to postpone the proceedings up to a week, AMPAS president Pierson and ceremony producer Cates refused to delay the gala to a different date citing unavailability of the Kodak Theatre during that time. Pierson also stated that moving the festivities to a different venue would be too expensive for the Academy. However, they also announced that the red carpet festivities would be severely curtailed. The bleacher seats situated along Hollywood Boulevard would also be dismantled, and ticket holders for those seats would receive rain checks that were good towards the following year&#x27;s event. Periodically during commercial breaks, ABC News anchor and journalist Peter Jennings gave news brief updates regarding the events happening overseas.

===Box office performance of nominated films===
At the time of the nominations announcement on February 11, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $486 million, with an average of $97.3 million per film. &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $321 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; ($70.1 million), &quot;Chicago&quot; ($64.5 million), &quot;The Hours&quot; ($21.8 million), and finally &quot;The Pianist&quot; ($9.1 million).

Of the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 47 nominations went to 14 films on the list. Only &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; (2nd), &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; (5th), &quot;Ice Age&quot; (9th), &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (11th), &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; (13th), &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (23rd), &quot;Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron&quot; (35th), &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (37th), and &quot;Chicago&quot; (41st) were nominated for Best Picture, Best Animated Feature, or any of the directing, acting, or screenwriting awards. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1st), &quot;Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot; (3rd), &quot;Minority Report&quot; (16th), &quot;8 Mile&quot; (22nd), and &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (44th).

===&quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; acceptance speech===
Shortly after winning the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; director Michael Moore spoke out against U.S. President George W. Bush and the Iraq War which had just started three days prior. He further criticized the president by stating, &quot;We live in a time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious president. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons.&quot; The speech was received with a cacophony of boos, applause, and standing ovations from the audience at the theater. Moments after the speech concluded, in order to lighten the mood, host Martin joked, &quot;The Teamsters are helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.&quot;

===Critical response===
The show received a positive reception from most media publications. Television critic Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot; commended Martin&#x27;s hosting performance writing that, &quot;Luckily for viewers, Martin has two other qualities that are essential to a good Academy Awards host: wit and insider status. He used both to his and our advantage, winning the crowd&#x27;s confidence and then gleefully mocking them all night.&quot; He also noted that the political remarks from presenters and speeches &quot;a touch of tension to what is so often a dull evening.&quot; &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; television columnist Rob Owen raved that &quot;Martin radiates class and wit, something often lacking in awards show hosts. From jokes about the allegedly scaled-down ceremony to reaction to his return to the Oscar stage, Martin entertained consistently.&quot; He also quipped that even the segments honoring Oscar history &quot;seemed tighter and less tedious.&quot; Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave high marks to Martin commenting, &quot;Helping immeasurably to make it a great show was Steve Martin, who served as host for the second time and triumphed as a welcome sardonic voice amid all the usual piousness and self-adulation.&quot; He also commented that despite the toned-down atmosphere, the speeches and tributes provided several heartfelt and memorable moments desperately needed in uncertain times.

Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Television critic Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; bemoaned, &quot;A wonderful, intelligent Oscar host two years ago, Martin on this night looked as though he&#x27;d thrown in the towel backstage and let comedy writer Bruce Vilanch come up with a batch of gormless ain&#x27;t-Hollywood-goofy lines to absolve him of responsibility for being hilarious.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Steve Johnson lamented, &quot;Martin in his second turn hosting Hollywood&#x27;s big night was, especially in the early going, slightly off-key, his attempt to keep a jovial face on things understandable but eventually coming to seem a touch disrespectful.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;Except for the Moore line, he simply was not able to perform a perhaps impossible task, putting people at ease about attending, or watching, a party as a war raged, visible to anyone who flipped over to CNN.&quot; David Zurawik of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; quipped, &quot;As the rest of the world saw televised images of captives and corpses identified as American soldiers, we watched host Steve Martin and a theater full of celebrities celebrating their self importance. Try as they might last night in the capital of Fantasy Land to create a program that would transport us beyond current events, they never came close.&quot; He also complained that many of the evening&#x27;s comments and jokes seemed tone deaf and disrespectful in light of the war.

===Ratings and reception===
The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 33.04 million people over its length, which was a 21% decrease from the previous year&#x27;s ceremony. An estimated 62.55 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 20.58% of households watching over a 40.34 share. In addition, it garnered a lower 1849 demo rating with a 12.55 rating over a 35.37 share among viewers in that demographic. Many media outlets observed that cable news coverage of the Iraq War diverted home viewers&#x27; attention from the ceremony and therefore contributed to the lower ratings. At the time, it earned the lowest viewership for an Academy Award telecast since figures were compiled beginning with the 46th ceremony in 1974 and the lowest ratings for any broadcast since Nielsen Media Research kept track of such data since the 33rd ceremony in 1961.

In July 2003, the ceremony presentation received eight nominations at the 55th Primetime Emmys. Two months later, the ceremony won three of those nominations for Outstanding Art Direction For A Variety Or Music Program (Roy Christopher), Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic, Multi-camera) for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program (Robert Barnhart, Robert A. Dickinson, Andy O&#x27;Reilly), and Outstanding Music Direction (Bill Conti).

<text>The Order, also known as The Sin Eater, is a 2003 mystery thriller film written and directed by Brian Helgeland, starring Heath Ledger, Benno Fürmann, Mark Addy, and Shannyn Sossamon. Helgeland directed Ledger, Addy and Sossamon in the 2001 film &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;. It was poorly received by critics and was a box office failure.

The film revolves around the investigation of the suspicious death of an excommunicated priest and the discovery of a Sin Eater headquartered in Rome.

==Plot==
Alex Bernier is a disillusioned priest and member of the fictional Carolingian Order, an ancient sect specializing in exorcisms and combating demonic forces. The narrative begins with the mysterious death of Father Dominic, the head of the Carolingians, in Rome. Alex is dispatched by Cardinal Driscoll, a prominent Vatican official and papal candidate, to investigate the circumstances surrounding Dominic&#x27;s demise.

Before his departure, Alex is approached by Mara Williams, an artist whom he previously attempted to exorcise. Mara reveals that she senses impending danger for Alex. It is disclosed that during the exorcism, Mara attempted to kill Alex and was subsequently committed to a mental institution. Despite her troubled history, Alex permits Mara to accompany him to Rome after she assures him she poses no threat.

In Rome, Alex examines Dominic&#x27;s corpse and observes unusual markings that he identifies as the work of a Sin Eater—a figure capable of absolving sins outside the Church&#x27;s authority. Seeking assistance, he contacts his friend and fellow Carolingian priest, Thomas Garrett. The Vatican denies the existence of Sin Eaters and refuses Dominic a burial on consecrated ground due to alleged excommunication. Defying orders, Alex conducts a clandestine funeral service for Dominic in the Carolingian cemetery.

Cardinal Driscoll arrives in Rome and presents Alex with an ancient dagger and a fragmentary parchment containing an Aramaic incantation. Believing these to be tools to eliminate the Sin Eater, Alex and Thomas pursue further information. Their search leads them to a clandestine figure known as the Black Pope, who operates an underground sect. The Black Pope instructs Alex to seek answers from the dying, orchestrating a scenario where three men are hanged. One of the dying men provides a riddle that guides Alex to a meeting with the Sin Eater.

During their escape from the Black Pope&#x27;s domain, Thomas is injured by demonic entities, and Alex brings him to a hospital. Alex then encounters the Sin Eater, William Eden, at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Eden, weary after centuries of service, expresses a desire for Alex to succeed him. Intrigued but conflicted, Alex assists Eden in a sin-eating ritual but ultimately declines the offer, deciding to leave the priesthood to pursue a relationship with Mara.

Unbeknownst to Alex, Eden visits Mara and inflicts fatal wounds, making it appear as a suicide attempt. Discovering her near death and beyond medical help, Alex performs the sin-eating ritual to ensure her passage to heaven. Realizing that Mara did not commit suicide, Alex deduces Eden&#x27;s manipulation and resolves to confront him.

Meanwhile, Thomas uncovers that the Black Pope is actually Cardinal Driscoll. Driscoll reveals the complete parchment, which outlines the true purpose of the dagger and incantation—not to kill the Sin Eater, but to transfer his powers to a successor. Driscoll prevents Thomas from warning Alex of this revelation.

Alex confronts Eden and, following the supposed instructions to eliminate him, stabs Eden with the dagger while reciting the incantation. Eden dies, and the sin-eating powers are inadvertently transferred to Alex. Thomas arrives too late to prevent the transfer and informs Alex of Driscoll&#x27;s deceit. It becomes apparent that Dominic, Eden, and Driscoll orchestrated events to manipulate Alex into becoming the new Sin Eater: Eden sought release from his burden, Driscoll desired the papacy, and Dominic aimed to access forbidden knowledge.

Alex exposes Driscoll&#x27;s machinations to the Church, leading to the Cardinal&#x27;s downfall. Facing ruin, Driscoll attempts suicide and summons Alex to absolve his sins. Instead, Alex forces Driscoll to confront his own corruption, refusing to perform the ritual. Embracing his new role, Alex decides to use his abilities as a force for good, offering salvation to those he deems worthy and denying it to the unrepentant.

==Cast==
* Heath Ledger as Father Alex Bernier
* Shannyn Sossamon as Mara Williams
* Benno Fürmann as William Eden
* Mark Addy as Father Thomas Garrett
* Peter Weller as Cardinal Driscoll
* Francesco Carnelutti as Dominic
* Adam Toomer as Chuck Lowery

==Reception==

The film opened at #6 at the U.S. Box office raking in $4,438,899 USD in its first opening weekend. The film was panned by critics. It currently holds a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 61 reviews, with the site&#x27;s consensus calling it &quot;a religious thriller that&#x27;s more lethargic and silly than thrilling&quot;. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 21 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the film as &quot;The Exorcist warmed over&quot; and suggested that Helgeland had more fun with the cast in &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; than The Order. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a murky ecclesiastical horror film&quot; and added that it was &quot;so entranced by its own bogus solemnity that most of what passes for conversation is language warped into the heavy-breathing pontification of prophecy delivered in thudding Charlton Heston-style cadences.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave a more scathing review, calling it &quot;so lethargic that I began to think of watching it as a form of atonement.&quot;

<text>U.S. Route 190 (US 190) is an east–west United States Highway in Louisiana and Texas. Segments of US 190 will be upgraded to Interstate 14 (I-14); the first segment was opened on January 26, 2017.

==Route description==

|}

===Texas===
The western terminus is at a point where US 190 intersects with I-10, a few miles east of Bakersfield and west of the town of Iraan, in the middle of Pecos County.

It runs east through Texas Hill Country speckled with sagebrush, intersecting with State Highway 305 (SH 305), crossing into Schleicher County, and intersecting with US 277 in Eldorado. US 190 continues east into Menard County, intersecting State Highway 864, and passing a few miles north of Fort McKavett State Historic Site, entering Menard and intersecting with US 83 north a short distance.

Continuing on a northeastward route, US 190 enters McCulloch County and into Brady. As the closest city to the geographical center of Texas, the city proclaims itself the &quot;True Heart of Texas&quot;, &quot;where five major highways meet, making it a major gateway to all regions of the state&quot;. US 190 enters Brady from the south merging and running concurrently with north US 377 and US 87 through town, intersecting Farm to Market Road 2028 (FM 2028), FM 2309, then splitting with US 87 and US 377, before exiting the city heading east. US 190 goes through Rochelle, enters San Saba County, through Richland Springs where it intersects FM 45, the communities Algerita, and Harkeyville, and into San Saba, the birthplace of actor Tommy Lee Jones, and an intersection with SH 16. Continuing east, US 190 enters Lampasas County, entering Lometa, merging and running concurrently with US 183 south into the city of Lampasas. Splitting from US 183 and continuing east, US 190 runs through Kempner and into the extreme southern corner of Coryell County and Copperas Cove, which is located on the southwestern edge of Fort Cavazos. On the east side of Copperas Cove, a concurrency with I-14 begins. US 190 then traverses through part of Fort Cavazos, into Bell County and Killeen. Being directly adjacent to the main cantonment of Fort Cavazos, both Killeen and Copperas Cove depend on the fort and those stationed there.

US 190 next intersects and merges with I-35 through Belton and enters Temple, where I-14 ends. The highway then merges and runs concurrently with SH 36 south. Continuing east and south, US 190 passes through Rogers and enters Milam County then Cameron and merges with US 77 south for a distance. A few miles south of Cameron, US 190 merges and runs concurrently with US 79 north. In Hearne, US 190 splits with US 79 and merges to run concurrently with SH 6 south, entering Brazos County, through Benchley, and into Bryan, that is considered the heart of the Brazos Valley (Southeast Central Texas), and is part of the Bryan-College Station metropolitan area.

US 190 splits with SH 6, turning northeast and merging with SH 21 north, entering Kurten, entering Madison County also passing through North Zulch, Cottonwood and into Madisonville, before merging with I-45 south and into Walker County, then entering Huntsville, where US 190 splits heading into Eastern Texas.
Continuing east, US 190 enters San Jacinto County, passing north of Oakhurst and Point Blank, crossing Lake Livingston, entering Polk County and into Onalaska. US 190 from the west makes a semi-loop up over Lake Livingston and down to Livingston, intersecting US 59 and Business US 59 (Bus. US 59) and through Alabama-Coushatta Indian Reservation, entering Tyler County, merging with FM 256 and into Woodville. East of Woodville, FM 256 splits north and US 190 crosses BA Steinhagen Lake, into Jasper County, intersecting with SH 63 east, and in the center of Jasper intersecting with US 96. Continuing east, US 190 travels through Holly Springs and enters Newton County, proceeding into Newton. In Newton, US 190 turns south through Bon Wier, and then crosses the Louisiana line. In Newton County, US 190 has been designated one of the routes on the Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail.

===Louisiana===

US 190 crosses the Sabine River and enters the western portion of Louisiana in swampy bayou terrain west of Merryville, Louisiana. Merryville is the location of the old Coushatta Indian village.

From Merryville the highway heads north by northeast to the community of Junction, Louisiana, also referred to as &quot;The Junction&quot;. Junction is where Louisiana Highway 111 (LA 111) and US 190 intersect and is the site of a roadside marker and the joining of two Indian trails.

From Junction, US 190 heads east to DeRidder, where it runs concurrently with US 171 south and passes several sites on the National Register of Historic Places, such as the Beauregard Parish Jail, Beauregard Parish Courthouse, and the DeRidder Commercial Historic District. US 190 runs concurrently with US 171 to Ragley, where US 190 parts with US 171 heading east. From Ragley, the two-lane highway heads nearly due east almost parallel to I-10 until Opelousas. US 190 crosses the northern reach of the Atchafalaya Basin near the Morganza Spillway en route to Baton Rouge. From Baton Rouge, US 190 passes, in places divided, through Denham Springs, Albany, Hammond, Robert, Goodbee, Covington, Mandeville, before reaching the eastern terminus at Slidell.

The stretch between I-12 south of Covington and the intersection with LA 22 at Mandeville is multilane divided with controlled access, serving as the primary connector between I-12 and the north end of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway. The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is in the bayous near Slidell, at an intersection with US 90. This junction was once known as the &quot;White Kitchen&quot; after a restaurant that was once located there.

===Other designations===
* Atchafalaya Expressway — US 190 in Louisiana
* Earl Rudder Freeway and Central Texas Expressway — US 190 in Texas (part of future I-14)

==History==
In the original 1926 plan, US 190 served the purpose of modern-day I-12 as the road around the north side of Lake Pontchartrain to avoid New Orleans. The original western terminus was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, meeting US 71 at the Baton Rouge–Port Allen ferry across the Mississippi River. US 190 was concurrent with State Route 7 (SR 7, in the pre-1955 Louisiana Highway system) from Baton Rouge to Covington, then SR 34 from Covington to Slidell, Louisiana. The original eastern terminus of US 190 was in Slidell, where it intersected US 90/LA 2 (now US 11).

In 1935, the route was extended west across the Mississippi River, ending in the western Texas town of Brady at an intersection with US 87. The section from Krotz Springs to the Baton Rouge-Port Allen ferry was a concurrency with US 71 from 1935 until 1951.

US 190 was assigned to an additional across the sparsely populated areas of western Texas south of San Angelo in June 1977, taking effect January 1, 1978. US 190 now ran westward to I-10 outside of Iraan, replacing a section of Ranch to Market Road 33 (RM 33) and all of both FM 1257 and FM 1980.

===Louisiana===
The original 1926 route followed the Jefferson Highway through downtown Baton Rouge, then LA 426 (Old Hammond Highway) to the Amite River. East of Baton Rouge, significant differences from the current alignment are as follows: LA 1032 through Denham Springs; LA 1027 into Walker; LA 43 and 1040 (Old Baton Rouge Highway) between Albany and Hammond; South Range Road and LA 1067 (Old Covington Highway) between Hammond and the Tangipahoa River; and Bus. US 190 through Covington.

West of Baton Rouge, the current alignment generally follows the same route since its extension into Texas in 1935. The only major re-routing was between Deridder and Elton, where the original route followed LA 26. The portion between Oberlin and Elton was re-routed in 1937 to follow US 165 to Kinder before assuming the current alignment between Deridder and Kinder the following year. Other differences from the current route are as follows: LA 110 through Merryville; LA 3099 into DeRidder; LA 3253, 1244, 31, and 742 between Opelousas and Port Barre; Old U.S. 190 between Bayou Courtableau and Krotz Springs and between East Krotz Springs, Louisiana Krotz Springs and Lottie; LA 77 between Livonia and Rosedale; and LA 76 between Rosedale and Port Allen.

In 1937, US 190 took over the original route of US 90 from Slidell to the Rigolets Bridge (along current US 11 and LA 433) when that highway assumed its current routing into Mississippi. US 190 was given its current eastern terminus at US 90 in the 1940s, following what is now Bus. US 190 (Fremaux Avenue) through Slidell until the 1970s when it was shifted onto Gause Boulevard.

In 1951, US 190 was re-routed along Bus. US 51 (mainline US 51 at the time) and LA 22 between Hammond and Mandeville. The new route passed through Ponchatoula and Madisonville and bypassed Covington. The former route through Covington was restored in 1956.

The current US 190 near Krotz Springs is an elevated highway. The road was built as a bypass around the road called Old 190 which continues across the Morganza Spillway to the western edge of Lottie. US 190 crosses the Atchafalaya River on two cantilever bridges known as the Krotz Springs Bridge. It crosses the Mississippi River on the 1940-era Huey Long Bridge north of Baton Rouge.

The route is now used as an alternate route for I-10, across the Atchafalaya Expressway. Traffic can be diverted along LA 975 to Krotz Springs, and LA 76 to US 190/LA 1.

== Future ==
Interstate 14 is likely to extend further west and east in central Texas along the US 190 corridor, once adequate funding becomes available. In 2019, Representative Brian Babin (R-TX) introduced legislation in the House of Representatives to extend the I-14 corridor through Odessa, many parts of which would likely follow the US 190 alignment through parts of central Texas. Though the bill was referred to the Congressional Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, it is likely that bills featuring a congressional I-14 designation will be proposed in the future, as the Fixing America&#x27;s Surface Transportation Act initially authorized I-14.

The Texas Department of Transportation will upgrade US 190 from a two-lane highway to a four-lane divided highway from approximately two miles (3.2 km) south of Heidenheimer, Texas to the Bell County-Milam County line. The $77.8 million project will improve driving safety along 7.3 miles of US 190 in central Texas, as new hardened medians will separate each side of traffic. This continues previously completed upgrades along US 190 of two-lane to four-lane highways. The most recent of these improvements were made to the Heidenheimer area circa 2010.

== Business routes ==
US 190 has six business routes: three in Texas and three in Louisiana.

=== Copperas Cove ===
Business U.S. Highway 190-E is a 4.5 mile (7.2 km) long business route that runs through downtown Copperas Cove. In 2010, the Texas Department of Transportation was given approval by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to move US 190 to a new bypass on the south side of Copperas Cove, leaving the original alignment to be made into a business route. The project had been in the planning phases since the 1980s. After delays due to the construction of what would become I-14 to the east of Copperas Cove, the $46.5 million bypass opened on January 29, 2015, and the original alignment became Business US 190.

Business US 190&#x27;s western terminus is located at a signaled intersection with US 190 and Farm to Market Road 2657 (FM 2657). Though signed east–west, the first section of the road runs north-to-northeast toward the city center of Copperas Cove. Turning east after, the road intersects FM 116, where FM 116 forms a short concurrency with Business US 190 for three blocks. After the concurrency, FM 116 breaks off and continues north towards downtown. Continuing eastward, the road intersects northbound FM 1113 and begins to enter the commercial district of Copperas Cove. The road continues due east past the town&#x27;s center until it merges with I-14, US 190, and State Highway 9 (SH 9). There is no direct access from eastbound Business US 190 to westbound I-14/US 190 or SH 9.

=== Killeen ===
Business U.S. Highway 190-F is a 9.09 mile (14.6 km) long business route that runs through downtown Killeen that follows an old alignment of US 190. When US 190 was moved off the original route to a southern bypass around both Killeen and the town of Harker Heights in 1975, the remaining route was initially declared as State Loop 518. In an overhaul of state loop designations throughout Texas, however, the Texas Department of Transportation converted many former U.S. route and state highway alignments into business routes, thus creating Business U.S. Highway 190.

Business US 190 begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-14/US 190 and Hood Road. This interchange is located within the boundaries of Fort Cavazos; the only access to the army base directly from US 190 Business is via Hood Road. The route continues east as Veterans Memorial Boulevard. It intersects State Highway 195 (Fort Hood Road) as the business route exits Fort Cavazos and enters Killeen city limits. The business route passes through downtown Killeen and crosses FM 439 once passing the commercial district. Continuing eastward, the route passes by Skylar Field Airport and enters Harker Heights, where it intersects both FM 3423 and FM 3219. Approaching US 190, the business route splits: according to the Texas Department of Transportation, the official west-to-east alignment of the route forks to Edwards Drive, while the east-to-west alignment continues on Veterans Memorial Boulevard, though both directions are signed as the business route on the boulevard. At either designation, the roads both lost the designation at their respective I-14/US 190 intersections.

=== Heidenheimer ===
Business U.S. Highway 190-J is a 2.5 mile (4.0 km) long business route that runs through the town of Heidenheimer along an old alignment of US 190. As US 190 has come to be a major thoroughfare through central Texas, traffic could not handle the two lane road in the primarily residential area. With houses on both sides of the road close to the roadway, a bypass was needed by the mid-2000s. A new four-lane bypass around Heidenheimer looped west around the town, opening in 2010. In October 2010, the AASHTO approved the movement of US 190 to the new bypass. Later in 2010, the Texas Department of Transportation requested AASHTO to also approve the new Business U.S. Highway 190, which had been signed by Texas since US 190&#x27;s movement. The highway has been subsequently approved and the business route continues to be signed as such.

Though more aligned north-to-south, the business route is signed west-to-east. It begins at a T-intersection with US 190 westbound. The entrance to Business US 190 is not accessible from the eastbound lanes of US 190 as a grass median divides the highway. Once on the business route, it turns almost immediately to the right and begins a southeasterly track towards the town of Heidenheimer. Another access road from US 190 allows eastbound traffic to turn onto the business route. This connector is signed as &#x27;TO BUSINESS US 190&#x27; from the mainline road. Continuing eastward, the road intersects FM 93 at its eastern terminus, also allowing access to US 190. Entering the main residential part of the small town, the eastern terminus of FM 436 intersects Business US 190. Only slightly further east is Business US 190&#x27;s eastern terminus, where traffic returns to US 190.

=== Baton Rouge ===

U.S. Highway 61/190 Business, also called Florida Boulevard and internally designated as U.S. Highway 61-X, is a 10.8 mile (17.4 km) business route that runs along the old alignment of both US 61 and US 190 through downtown Baton Rouge. Although US 190 is signed as a west-to-east route, US 61/190 Business generally does not have directional signage and changes directions multiple times.

From southeast to northwest, the business route begins at a cloverleaf interchange with both US 190, which continues east toward Hammond, and US 61, which continues south toward New Orleans. Both mainline routes come together to form a concurrency and continue northward along the Airline Highway, while the continuing road from US 190 becomes the business route. The route continues west through a primarily commercial area and past Baton Rouge Community College before entering downtown Baton Rouge. I-110 northbound has a direct exit to US 61/190 Business (Exit 1C) in downtown Baton Rouge, while southbound motorists must use N. 9th Street (Exit 1G) to connect directly to the business route. US 61/190 Business continues west through downtown until it reaches River Road where it turns right and continues north.

Moving north, the business route passes one block to the left of the Louisiana State Capitol and along the Mississippi River before merging onto N. 3rd Street and entering an industrial area. The road curves and becomes Chippewa Street where it now heads east toward I-110. At US 61/190 Business&#x27; intersection with Louisiana State Highway 3164, the route turns to the left onto Scenic Highway, now heading north again, running parallel to I-110. The route continues about 2.5 miles (4 km) before reaching its northern terminus at US 61/190. At this point, Scenic Highway is taken over by US 61, now heading north towards Natchez and US 190 continues westward towards Opelousas.

Although US 61/190 Business has been signed as such since 1960, it did not formally get approval from the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) until 1968.

=== Covington ===

U.S. Highway 190 Business, also known as 21st Avenue or Boston Street and internally known as U.S. Highway 190-X, is a 3.31 mile (5.33 km) long business route that runs on the old alignment of US 190 through Covington.

The road begins at an intersection with US 190 to the west of downtown Covington. The business route continues eastbound into downtown Covington until it reaches Louisiana Highway 21 (LA 21). From here, LA 21 begins to run concurrently with US 190 Business until it returns to US 190 on the east side of Covington. The route was approved by AASHO in June 1969, along with the US 190 rerouting.

=== Slidell ===
U.S. Highway 190 Business, also known as Fremaux Avenue and internally known as U.S. Highway 190-Y, is a 3.94 mile (6.34 km) long business route that runs on most of the old alignment of US 190 through Slidell. The road begins at the intersection of US 11 (Front Street) and Fremaux Avenue in the &#x27;Olde Towne&#x27; neighborhood of Slidell. The business route continues eastbound on Fremaux Avenue until it ends at US 190 (Military Road), where US 190 turns eastbound once again and takes over Fremaux Avenue.

When I-10 was constructed in Slidell in the 1960s, the proximity of a weigh station could not allow an exit to be built at then-US 190. Nearby Gause Road (then Louisiana Highway 1092), which paralleled the former US 190, was chosen as the I-10 exit in Slidell. After increased traffic on Gause Road and motorist confusion accessing US 190, the state of Louisiana petitioned AASHO to re-route the highway and create a new business route. At AASHO&#x27;s June 1971 meeting, this request was approved. US 190 was permanently routed onto the now widened Gause Boulevard and Military Road while US 190 Business was signed along the former routing by 1975.

Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the weigh station on I-10 near the US 190 Business overpass was permanently closed and razed. In 2006, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LaDOTD) began construction on a new interchange at US 190 Business at the request of the St. Tammany Parish government and the City of Slidell. Extensive traffic backups at the US 190 (Gause Boulevard) interchange and the planning of a new retail center prompted this to be one of many projects to revitalize the area following Hurricane Katrina. Originally scheduled to open in the spring of 2008, multiple instances of severe weather, the threat of Hurricane Gustav, and signage delays pushed the opening of the interchange to late September 2008.

Although approved to sign the business route concurrently with US 11 to US 190 in &#x27;Olde Towne&#x27; Slidell, the route officially begins at US 11.

<doc id="498190" wikidata="Q5198827" url="?curid=498190" title="Smokey Joe Williams">
<text>Joseph Williams (April 6, 1886 – February 25, 1951), nicknamed &quot;Cyclone Joe&quot; and &quot;Smokey Joe&quot;, was an American right-handed pitcher in Negro league baseball. He is considered one of the greatest pitchers of all-time and was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Baseball career==
Williams was born in Seguin, Texas. One of his parents was African American, and the other was a Comanche Native American. Williams grew up to become an outstanding pitcher, but as his path to the major leagues was barred by the color line, he spent his entire 27-year career (1905–1932) pitching in the Negro leagues, Mexico, and the Caribbean.

Williams entered professional baseball in 1907 with the San Antonio Black Bronchos and was an immediate star, posting records of 28-4, 15-9, 20-8, 20-2, and 32-8. After that, the Chicago Giants, a team higher in the pecking order of black baseball, acquired him. In 1910, the Giants owner Frank Leland pronounced him the best pitcher in baseball, in any league.
In 1911, Williams joined the Lincoln Giants of New York, helping that club become one of the premier African-American teams of the era. In 1913, he took part in a &quot;Championship Series&quot; that matched up them against the team considered the best of the West in the Chicago American Giants. From July 18 to August 13, the two teams played fourteen games with each other. He had a decision in Games 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, winning five of the eight appearances as the Lincoln Giants won eight of fourteen games in the Series. In Game 5, he hit a home run. When manager John Henry Lloyd departed in 1914, Williams took over as player-manager, a post he held through the 1923 season. After the Lincolns finished an ignominious fifth (out of six teams) in the Eastern Colored League&#x27;s inaugural season, Williams was released in the spring of 1924.

Williams joined the Brooklyn Royal Giants for a season, then signed with the independent Homestead Grays, where, except for a brief turn with the Detroit Wolves in 1932, he spent the rest of his career in top-level black baseball. In 1929, playing for the Grays in the American Negro League at the age of 43, Williams won 12 games and lost seven.

On August 2, 1930, at age 44, Williams struck out 27 Kansas City Monarchs in a 1–0, 12-inning, one-hit night game victory. His mound opponent, Chet Brewer, struck out 19 men. That same year, he beat a younger Negro league star who was just bursting into superstardom, Satchel Paige, also by 1–0, in their only meeting against each other. Williams retired from baseball two years later.

Although barred from the major leagues, Williams pitched many games against major league stars in postseason barnstorming exhibitions. He proved to be as tough against them as he was against the Negro leaguers, posting a 20–7 record in these games. Among his victims were Hall of Famers Grover Cleveland Alexander, Walter Johnson, Chief Bender, Rube Marquard, and Waite Hoyt. Three different times, he faced the eventual National League champions. He won two of those games and lost the third, 1-0 to the 1917 New York Giants despite throwing a no-hitter. Ty Cobb stated Williams was “a sure 30-game winner in the major leagues”. 

During Williams&#x27; years in New York, he acquired the nickname &quot;Cyclone Joe&quot;, or simply &quot;Cyclone&quot;, frequently being listed in box scores solely by that name. After joining the Homestead Grays in the late 1920s, his nickname became &quot;Smokey Joe&quot;, and the older &quot;Cyclone&quot; appellation was rarely used after that.

Williams played winter baseball with a Palm Beach, Florida team for more than 20 years during his active career.

==Family==
Williams married Beatrice A. Johnson on March 22, 1922, in New York City. Upon retiring from baseball in the late 1930s, Williams became a bartender and continued this until his death from a heart ailment. Beatrice Williams survived him.

Williams is interred at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery, a historic African American cemetery in Suitland, Maryland. He is buried in a grave shared with his wife&#x27;s mother and step-father.

==Legacy==
In 1950, there was a &quot;Smokey Joe Williams Day&quot; at the Polo Grounds. The following year, Williams died at age 64 in New York City.

Considerable debate existed and still exists over whether Williams or Paige was the greatest of the Negro league pitchers. Most modern sources lean toward Paige, but in 1952, a poll taken by the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; named Williams the greatest pitcher in Negro league history.

In 1999, after extensive research on the early years of black baseball revealed his outstanding record, Williams was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In the 2001 book &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, writer Bill James ranked Williams as the 52nd greatest player in baseball history, behind Sandy Koufax and ahead of Roy Campanella. This would rank Williams as the 12th greatest pitcher, behind Koufax and ahead of Bob Feller.

==Quotes==
“The important thing is that the long fight against the ban has been lifted. I praise the Lord I’ve lived to see the day.”

<text>Thomas Zachariah Glazer (September 2, 1914 – February 21, 2003) was an American folk singer and songwriter known as a composer of ballads, including: &quot;Because All Men Are Brothers&quot;, recorded by The Weavers and Peter, Paul and Mary, &quot;Talking Inflation Blues&quot;, recorded by Bob Dylan, &quot;The Ballad of FDR&quot; and &quot;A Dollar Ain&#x27;t A Dollar Anymore&quot;. He wrote the lyrics to the songs &quot;Melody of Love&quot; (1954), and &quot;Skokian&quot; (1954). He is perhaps best remembered as the writer of the classic children’s song “On Top of Spaghetti.”

==Life==
Thomas Zachariah Glazer was born in Philadelphia on September 2, 1914, to Russian Jewish émigré parents from Minsk. His father, a carpenter in a shipyard, died during the 1918 flu pandemic, and Glazer was brought up by a series of relatives before being placed in the Hebrew Orphan Home in Philadelphia with his two brothers; his younger brother Sidney Glazier became a producer, most notably of Mel Brooks&#x27;s &quot;The Producers&quot;. Their father&#x27;s record collection influenced Glazer musically, and at school he learned to play the tuba, guitar and bass. At 17, he hitchhiked to New York, where he took night courses to complete his education while working at Macy&#x27;s during the day. He subsequently attended City College of New York for three years. He is of Jewish descent.

Glazer moved to Washington, D.C., and began work at the Library of Congress. There he met Alan Lomax who worked for cataloguing American folk songs, and who was a great influence. Glazer began performing as an amateur and was invited by Eleanor Roosevelt to perform at the White House for soldiers working there as guards. He made a successful professional début at The Town Hall, New York City, in January 1943 during a blizzard, and in 1945 had a radio show &quot;Tom Glazer&#x27;s Ballad Box&quot;. His songs of the period, such as &quot;A Dollar Ain&#x27;t a Dollar Anymore&quot;, &quot;Our Fight is Yours&quot;, &quot;When the Country is Broke&quot;, and &quot;Talking Inflation Blues&quot; took strong social stands. Glazer&#x27;s songs were recorded by Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, Burl Ives, The Kingston Trio, Peter, Paul and Mary, Perry Como and Frank Sinatra. He was part of the strong folk music scene in New York in the 1940s, and with Lead Belly, Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Josh White helped prepare for the commercially successful folk revival of the 1960s. &quot;He wasn&#x27;t fancy,&quot; Seeger reported after his death &quot;He was just straightforward. He had a good sense of humor.&quot;

Glazer was married to Miriam Reed Eisenberg with whom he had two sons. The marriage ended in divorce in 1974.

Glazer recorded a number of children&#x27;s records in the late 1940s and early 1950s with Young People&#x27;s Records, Inc. In the 1960s he hosted a weekly children&#x27;s show on WQXR radio in New York.

==Cinema==
Glazer wrote the musical score for the Elia Kazan film &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957). Glazer also wrote and sang the title song in the 1966 movie &quot;Namu, the Killer Whale&quot; starring Robert Lansing and Lee Meriwether.

==Children&#x27;s songs==
Glazer, with Dottie Evans, recorded three children&#x27;s records in 1959 and 1960 that were part of a six-album set known as &quot;Ballads for the Age of Science&quot;. They contained songs intended to explain science concepts for young children, all of which were written by Hy Zaret (lyrics) and Lou Singer (music). One of these albums, &quot;Space Songs&quot;, included the song &quot;Why Does the Sun Shine?&quot; which was later covered by They Might Be Giants.

His greatest commercial success came with his original 1963 recording of the song parody &quot;On Top of Spaghetti&quot; to the tune of &quot;On Top of Old Smoky&quot;, which he recorded for Kapp Records with the Do-Re-Mi Children&#x27;s Chorus. The song was later included on an LP record that also included such numbers as one of the first cover versions of &quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot;, as well as &quot;Battle Hymn of the Children&quot; and other children&#x27;s songs.

Glazer became ambivalent towards his creation, saying that &quot;I&#x27;m standing in line before the Pearly Gates in the musicians&#x27; line, in which I stand last. When I&#x27;m asked what have I done in music and I say I wrote &#x27;On Top of Spaghetti&#x27;, I&#x27;m told, &quot;Sorry, buster, you can&#x27;t enter.&quot; In 2008, Smithsonian Folkways released &quot;Tom Glazer Sings Honk-Hiss-Tweet-GGGGGGGGGG and Other Children&#x27;s Favorites,&quot; a collection of Glazer&#x27;s live performances.

His work with Young Peoples Records, a subscription service that delivered vinyl 78 RPM records to subscribers about every six weeks, included: &quot;Building a City&quot;, &quot;The Circus Comes to Town&quot;, &quot;The Men Who Come to Our House&quot;, &quot;The Little Fireman&quot;, &quot;On a Rainy Day&quot;, &quot;Muffet in the City&quot;, &quot;When I Grow Up&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Play Zoo&quot;, &quot;Going West: A Group of American Pioneer Songs&quot;, &quot;Hooray! Today is Your Birthday&quot;, &quot;When the Sun Shines Again&quot;, &quot;The Little Gray Ponies&quot;, &quot;Who Wants a Ride?&quot;, &quot;The Chugging Freight Engine&quot;, &quot;Everyday we Grow I-O&quot;, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, and &quot;Come to the Fair&quot;.

==Other hits==
Glazer also adapted a German folk song, &quot;&quot;, into &quot;The Musicians&quot; (also known as &quot;I Am a Fine Musician&quot;), memorably performed in two episodes of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;.

==Death==
Glazer died at his home in Rochester, New York on February 21, 2003, at the age of 88.

<doc id="498198" wikidata="Q7707033" url="?curid=498198" title="Teuchter">
<text>Teuchter ( , ) is a Lowland Scots word sometimes used to offensively describe a Scottish Highlander, in particular a Gaelic-speaking Teuchter. The term is also in use with more broader meanings attached, commonly applied to any Scot perceived to be from a rural area, and within Glasgow those who are from outwith the Greater Glasgow area. It is offensive, equivalent to other cultural epithets used by more powerful groups to describe people they have oppressed, but is often seen as amusing by the speaker. The term is contemptuous, essentially describing someone seen to be uncouth and rural.

==Derivation==
The word also shows up as &quot;cheuchter, tschooktir, chuchter, teuchtar, chookter&quot; but has no universally accepted orthography. From relative obscurity, it gained currency around 1910.

There are three main theories on the etymology of the word:
* a purely Gaelic derivation from &quot;tuath&quot; &quot;peasantry, tenantry&quot; or &quot;deoch&quot; &quot;drink&quot; (borrowed into Scots as &quot;teuch&quot;) plus an agent-forming suffix &quot;-air&quot; or &quot;-adair&quot;
* a derivation from the Scots adjective &quot;teuch&quot; &quot;physically or mentally strong, tough&quot; plus a suffix
* a derivation from the Scots noun &quot;teuchit/teuchat&quot; &quot;lapwing&quot;

One folk etymology/urban myth is that during the First World War, many members of the Highland regiments were pipers. A book of sheet music for the pipes is called a &quot;tutor&quot;, and when pronounced with the pre-aspiration of Gaelic accents when speaking English, this sounds like &quot;teuchter&quot;.

==Humour==
Like other rural stereotypes, teuchters commonly feature in jokes (Billy Connolly has performed and recorded a sketch where a teuchter visiting the city marvels at a bus as &quot;a hoose wi wheels&quot;) though such stories often end with the apparently naive teuchter triumphing through hidden wiliness.

The archetypal cartoon teuchter is the cartoon character Angus Og, created by Ewen Bain.

A teuchter is the hero of Scottish musician Bill Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Portree Kid&quot;, which parodies the song &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot; as &quot;The teuchter that cam frae Skye&quot;.

<text>thttpd (tiny/turbo/throttling HTTP server) is an open source software web server from ACME Laboratories, designed for simplicity, a small execution footprint and speed. 

== Design and features == 
thttpd is single-threaded and portable: it compiles cleanly on most Unix-like operating systems, including FreeBSD, SunOS 4, Solaris 2, BSD/OS, Linux, and OSF/1. It has an executable memory size of about 50 kB.
While it can be used as a simplified replacement to more feature-rich servers, it is uniquely suited to service high volume requests for static data—for example as an image hosting server. The first &quot;t&quot; in thttpd stands for variously tiny, turbo, or throttling.

thttpd has a bandwidth throttling feature which enables the server administrator to limit the maximum bit rate at which certain types of files may be transferred. For example, the administrator may choose to restrict the transfer of JPEG image files to at most 20 kilobytes per second. This prevents the connection from becoming saturated so that the server will still be responsive under heavy load, with the tradeoff that file transfer speed is reduced. thttpd did not support the X-Forwarded-For header

== Forks ==
There are at least 2 public forks of thttpd:
* sthttpd by Anthony Basile, focusing on Gentoo Linux patches
* Merecat by Joachim Nilsson, adding a number of features, most notably SSL support

<text>Dental products are specially fabricated materials, designed for use in dentistry. There are many different types of dental products, and their characteristics vary according to their intended purpose.

==Temporary dressings==
A temporary dressing is a dental filling which is not intended to last in the long term. They are interim materials which may have therapeutic properties. A common use of temporary dressing occurs if root canal therapy is carried out over more than one appointment. In between each visit, the pulp canal system must be protected from contamination from the oral cavity, and a temporary filling is placed in the access cavity. Examples include:

* Zinc oxide eugenol—bactericidal, cheap and easy to remove. Eugenol is derived from oil of cloves, and has an effect on the tooth and decreases toothache. It is suitable temporary material providing there are no biting forces on it. It is also contraindicated if the final restorative material is composite because eugenol adversely effects the bond/polymerization process; also, when applied directly on the pulp tissue, it can produce chronic inflammation and result in pulp necrosis. Brands include Kalzinol and Sedanol.

==Cements==
Dental cements are used most often to bond indirect restorations such as crowns to the natural tooth surface. Examples include:

* Zinc oxide cement—self setting and hardens when in contact with saliva. Example brands: Cavit, Coltosol.
*Zinc phosphate cement
*Zinc polycarboxylate cement—adheres to enamel and dentin. Example brand: PolyF.
*Glass ionomer cement
*Resin-based cement
*Copper-based cement

==Impression materials==

Dental impressions are negative imprints of teeth and oral soft tissues from which a positive representation can be cast. They are used in prosthodontics (to make dentures), orthodontics, restorative dentistry, dental implantology and oral and maxillofacial surgery.

Because patients&#x27; soft-tissue undercuts may be shallow or deep, impression materials vary in their rigidity in order to obtain an accurate impression. Rigid materials are used with patients with shallow undercuts, while elastic materials are used with patients with deep undercuts, as the material must be flexible enough to reach the end-point of the undercut.

Impression materials are designed to be liquid or semi-solid when first mixed, then set hard in a few minutes, leaving imprints of oral structures.

Common dental impression materials include sodium alginate, polyether and silicones. Historically, plaster of Paris, zinc oxide eugenol and agar were used.

==Lining materials==
Dental lining materials are used during restorations of large cavities, and are placed between the remaining tooth structure and the restoration material. The purpose of this is to protect the dentinal tubules and the sensitive pulp, forming a barrier-like structure. After drilling the caries out of the tooth, the dentist applies a thin layer (approximately 1/2mm) to the base of the tooth, followed by light curing. Another layer might be applied if the cavity is very large and deep.

There are many functions to dental lining materials, some of which are listed below:

* Lining materials protect the weak tooth from post-operative hypersensitivity, reducing patient discomfort and allowing the tooth to heal at a faster rate after the procedure.
* Some dental restorative materials, such as acrylic monomers in resin-based materials and phosphoric acid in silicate materials, may pose toxic and irritable effects to the pulp. Lining materials protect the tooth from such irritants.
* Lining materials serve as an insulating layer to the tooth pulp from sudden changes in temperature when the patient takes hot or cold food, protecting them from potential pain resulting from thermal conductivity.
* Lining materials are electrically insulating, preventing corrosion by galvanic cell where two dissimilar metals (e.g. gold or amalgam) are placed next to each other.

=== Types ===
Calcium hydroxide

Calcium hydroxide is a relatively low compressive strength and a viscous consistency, making it difficult to apply to cavities in thick sections. A common technique to overcome this issue is to apply a thin sub-lining of calcium hydroxide, then build up with zinc phosphate prior to amalgam condensation. This generates a relatively high pH environment around the area surrounding the cement due to calcium hydroxide leaking out, thus making it bactericidal.

It also has a unique effect of initiating calcification and stimulating the formation of secondary dentine, due to an irritation effect of the pulp tissues by the cement.

Calcium hydroxide is radio-opaque and acts as a good thermal and electrical insulation. However, due to its low compressive strength it is unable to withstand amalgam packing; a strong cement base material should be placed above it to counter this.

Calcium silicate-based liners have become alternatives to calcium hydroxide and are preferred by practitioners for their bioactive and sealing properties; the material triggers a biological response and results in formation of bonding with the tissue. They are commonly used as pulp capping agents and lining materials for silicate and resin-based filling materials.

It is usually supplied as two pastes, a glycol salicylate and another paste containing zinc oxide with calcium hydroxide. On mixing, a chelate compound is formed. Light-activated versions are also available; these contain polymerization activators, hydroexyethyl methacrylate, dimethacrylate which when light activated will result in a polymerization reaction of a modified methacrylate monomer.

Polycarboxylate cement

Polycarboxylate cement has the compressive strength to resist amalgam condensation. It is acidic, but less acidic than phosphate cements due to it having a higher molecular weight and polyacrylic acid being weaker than phosphoric acid. It forms a strong bond with dentine and enamel, allowing it to form a coronal seal. In addition, it is an electrical and thermal insulator while also releasing fluoride, rendering it bacteriostatic. It is also radio-opaque, making it an excellent lining material.

Care has to be taken in handling such material, as it has a strong bond with stainless steel instruments once it sets.

Polycarboxylate cement is commonly used as a luting agents or as a cavity base material. However, it tends to be rubbery during its setting reaction and adheres to stainless steel instruments, so most operators prefer not to use it in deep cavities.

It is usually supplied as a power containing zinc oxide and a liquid containing aqueous polyacrylic acid. The reaction consists of an acid base reaction with zinc oxide reacting with the acid groups in polyacid. This forms a reaction product of unreacted zinc oxide cores bound by a salt matrix, with polyacrylic acid chains cross linking with zinc ions.

Glass ionomer

Glass ionomer (GI) has the strongest compressive and tensile strength of all linings, so it can withstand amalgam condensation in high stress bearing areas such as class II cavities. GI is used as a lining material as it is very compatible with most restorative materials, insulates thermally and electrically, and adheres to enamel and dentine. GI lining contains glass of smaller particle sizes compared to its adhesive restorative mix, to allow formation of a thinner film. Some variations are also radiopaque, making them good for X-ray cavity detection. In addition, GI is bacteriostatic due to its fluoride release from un-reacted glass cores.

GIs are usually used as a lining material for composite resins or as luting agents for orthodontic bands.

The reaction is an acid-base reaction between calcium-aluminum-silicate glass powder and polyacrylic acid. They come in a powder and liquid which are mixed on a pad or in capsules which are for single usage. Resin-modified GIs contain a photoinitiator (usually camphorquinone) and an amide, and are light cured with a LED light curing unit. Setting takes place by a combination of acid-base reaction and chemically activated polymerization.

Zinc oxide eugenol

Zinc oxide eugenol has the lowest compressive and tensile strength of the liners, so its use is limited to small or non-stress-bearing areas such as Class V cavities. This cavity lining is often used with a high strength base to provide strength, rigidity and thermal insulation. Zinc oxide eugenol can be used as linings in deep cavities without causing harm to the pulp, due to its obtundant effect on the pulp as well as its bactericidal properties due to zinc. However, eugenol may have an effect on resin-based filling materials, as it interferes with polymerization and occasionally causes discoloration. Caution could therefore be exercised when using both in tandem. It is also radio-opaque, allowing fillings to be visible by X-rays.

Zinc oxide eugenol is usually used as a temporary filling/luting agent due to its low compressive strength making it easily removed, or as a lining for amalgam as it is incompatible with composites resins.

It is supplied as a two paste system. Equal length of two pastes are dispensed into a paper pad and mixed.

==Restorative materials==

Dental restorative materials are used to replace tooth structure loss, usually due to dental caries (cavities), but also tooth wear and dental trauma. On other occasions, such materials may be used for cosmetic purposes to alter the appearance of an individual&#x27;s teeth.

There are many challenges for the physical properties of the ideal dental restorative material. The ideal material would be identical to natural tooth structure in strength, adherence, and appearance. The properties of such material can be divided into four categories: physical properties, biocompatibility, aesthetics and application.

* Physical properties of good restorative materials include low thermal conductivity and expansion, resistance to different categories of forces and wear such as attrition and abrasion, and resistance to chemical erosion. There must also be good bonding strength to the tooth. Everyday masticatory forces and conditions must be withstood without material fatigue.
*Biocompatibility refers to how well the material coexists with the biological equilibrium of the tooth and body systems. Since fillings are in close contact with mucosa, tooth, and pulp, biocompatibility is very important. Common problems with some of the current dental materials include chemical leakage from the material, pulpal irritation and, less commonly, allergic reactions. Some of the byproducts of the chemical reactions during different stages of material hardening need to be considered.
*Radiopacity in dental materials is an important property that allows for distinguishing restorations from teeth and surrounding structures, assessing the absorption of materials into bone structure, and detecting cement dissolution or other failures that could cause harm to the patient. Cements, composites, endodontic sealers, bone grafts, and acrylic resins all benefit from the addition of radiopaque materials. Examples of these materials include zinc oxide, zirconium dioxide, titanium dioxide, barium sulfate, and ytterbium(III) fluoride.
* Ideally, filling materials should match the surrounding tooth structure in shade, translucency, and texture.
* Dental operators require materials that are easy to manipulate and shape, where the chemistry of any reactions that need to occur are predictable or controllable.

===Direct restorative materials===
Direct restorations are ones which are placed directly into a cavity on a tooth, and shaped to fit. The chemistry of the setting reaction for direct restorative materials is designed to be more biologically compatible. Heat and byproducts generated cannot damage the tooth or patient, since the reaction needs to take place while in contact with the tooth during restoration. This ultimately limits the strength of the materials, since harder materials need more energy to manipulate. The type of filling material used has a minor effect on how long they last. The majority of clinical studies indicate the annual failure rates (AFRs) are between 1% and 3% with tooth colored fillings on back teeth. Root canaled (endodontically) treated teeth have AFRs between 2% and 12%. The main reasons for failure are cavities that occur around the filling and fracture of the real tooth. These are related to personal cavity risk and factors like grinding teeth (bruxism).

====Amalgam====

Amalgam is a metallic filling material composed from a mixture of mercury (from 43% to 54%) and a powdered alloy made mostly of silver, tin, zinc and copper, commonly called the amalgam alloy. Amalgam does not adhere to tooth structure without the aid of cements or use of techniques which lock in the filling, using the same principles as a dovetail joint.

Amalgam is still used extensively in many parts of the world because of its cost effectiveness, superior strength and longevity. However, the metallic colour is not aesthetically pleasing and tooth-coloured alternatives with increasingly comparable properties have been developed. Due to the known toxicity of mercury, there is some controversy about the use of amalgams. The Swedish government banned the use of mercury amalgam in June 2009. Research has shown that while amalgam may increase mercury levels in the human body, these levels are below safety threshold levels established by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. However, there exist subpopulations whose members, because of inherited genetic variabilities, are more sensitive to mercury than these threshold levels. They may experience adverse effects caused by amalgam restoration, including neural defects caused by impaired neurotransmitter processing.

====Composite resin====
Composite resin fillings (also called white fillings) are a mixture of nanoparticles or powdered glass and plastic resin, and can be made to resemble the appearance of the natural tooth. Although cosmetically superior to amalgam fillings, composite resin fillings are usually more expensive. Bis-GMA based resins contain Bisphenol A, a known endocrine disrupter chemical, and may contribute to the development of breast cancer. However, there is no added risk of kidney or endocrine injury in choosing composite restorations over amalgams. PEX-based materials do not contain Bisphenol A and are the least cytotoxic material available.

Most modern composite resins are light-cured photopolymers, meaning that they harden with light exposure. They can then be polished to achieve maximum aesthetic results. Composite resins experience a very small amount of shrinkage upon curing, causing the material to pull away from the walls of the cavity preparation. This makes the tooth slightly more vulnerable to microleakage and recurrent decay. Microleakage can be minimized or eliminated with proper handling techniques and appropriate material selection.

In some circumstances, using composite resin allows less of the tooth structure to be removed compared to other dental materials such as amalgam and indirect methods of restoration. This is because composite resins bind to enamel (and dentin too, although not as well) via a micromechanical bond. As conservation of tooth structure is a key ingredient in tooth preservation, many dentists prefer placing materials like composite instead of amalgam fillings whenever possible.

Generally, composite fillings are used to fill a carious lesion involving highly visible areas (such as the central incisors or any other teeth that can be seen when smiling) or when conservation of tooth structure is a top priority.

The bond of composite resin to tooth is especially affected by moisture contamination and the cleanliness of the prepared surface. Other materials can be selected when restoring teeth where moisture control techniques are not effective.

====Glass ionomer cement====

The concept of using &quot;smart&quot; materials in dentistry has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Conventional glass ionomer cements (GICs) have many applications in dentistry. They are biocompatible with the dental pulp to some extent. Clinically, this material was initially used as a biomaterial to replace the lost osseous tissues in the human body.

GIC fillings are a mixture of glass and an organic acid.

The cavity preparation of a GIC filling is the same as a composite resin. GICs are chemically set via an acid-base reaction. Upon mixing of the material components, no light cure is needed to harden the material once placed in the cavity preparation. After the initial set, GICs still need time to fully set and harden.

An advantage of GICs compared to other restorative materials is that they can be placed in cavities without any need for bonding agents. Another advantage is that they are not subject to shrinkage and microleakage, as the bonding mechanism is an acid-base reaction and not a polymerization reaction. Additionally, GICs contain and release fluoride, which is important to prevent carious lesions. As GICs release their fluoride, they can be &quot;recharged&quot; by the use of fluoride-containing toothpaste; this means they can be used to treat patients at high risk of caries.

Although they are tooth-colored, GICs vary in translucency, and their aesthetic potential is not as great as that of composite resins. Newer formulations that contain light-cured resins can achieve a greater aesthetic result, but do not release fluoride as well as conventional GICs.

The most important disadvantage of GICs is lack of adequate strength and toughness. To improve the mechanical properties of the conventional GIC, resin-modified ionomers have been marketed. GICs are usually weak after setting and are not stable in water; however, they become stronger with the progression of reactions and become more resistant to moisture.

New generations of GICs aim to regenerate tissues; they use bioactive materials in the form of a powder or solution to induce local tissue repair. These materials release chemical agents in the form of dissolved ions or growth factors such as bone morphogenetic protein, which stimulates activate cells.

GICs are about as expensive as composite resin. The fillings do not wear as well as composite resin fillings, but they are generally considered good materials to use for root caries and for sealants.

====Resin modified glass-ionomer cement (RMGIC)====
A combination of glass-ionomer and composite resin, these fillings are a mixture of glass, an organic acid, and resin monomers that harden when light cured (light-activated polymerization besides the acid-base reaction of conventional GICs). The cost is similar to composite resin. It holds up better than GIC, but not as well as composite resin, and is not recommended for biting surfaces of adult teeth, or when control of moisture cannot be achieved.

Generally, RMGICs can achieve a better aesthetic result than conventional GICs, but not as good as pure composites.

====Compomers====

 Another combination of composite resin and GIC technology, compomers are essentially made up of filler, dimethacrylate monomer, difunctional resin, photo-activator and initiator, and hydrophilic monomers. The filler decreases the proportion of resin and increases the mechanical strength, as well as improving the material&#x27;s appearance.

Although compomers have better mechanical and aesthetic properties than RMGIC, they have some disadvantages which limit their applications:
* Compomers have weaker wear properties.
* They cannot adhere to tooth tissue due to the presence of resin, which can make it shrink on polymerisation. They therefore require bonding materials.
* They release low levels of fluoride, so cannot act as a fluoride reservoir.
* They have high staining susceptibility; uptake of oral fluid causes them to show staining soon after placement.
Due to its relatively weaker mechanical properties, Compomers are unfit for stress-bearing restorations but can be used in the deciduous dentition where lower loads are anticipated.

==== Cermets ====

Dental cermets, also known as silver cermets, were created to improve the wear resistance and hardness of glass ionomer cements by adding silver. Their other advantages are that they adhere directly to tooth tissue, and are radio-opaque, which helps with identification of secondary caries when future radiographs are taken.

However, cermets have poorer aesthetics, appearing metallic rather than white. They also have a similar compressive strength, flexural strength, and solubility as GICs, some of the main limiting factors for both materials. In addition, their fluoride release is poorer than that of GICs. Clinical studies have shown cermets perform poorly. All these disadvantages led to the decline in the use of this restorative material.

===Indirect restorative materials===

An indirect restoration is one where the teeth are first prepared, then an impression is taken and sent to a dental technician who fabricates the restoration according to the dentist&#x27;s prescription.

==== Porcelain ==== 
Porcelain fillings are hard, but can cause wear on opposing teeth. Their hardness and rigidity enables them to resist abrasion forces, and are good aesthetically as they mimic the appearance of natural teeth. However, they are also brittle and not always recommended for molar fillings. Porcelain materials can be strengthened by soaking fired material in molten salt to allow exchange of sodium and potassium ions on the surface; this successfully creates compressive stresses on the outer layer, by controlling cooling after firing, and by the use of pure alumina inserts, a core of alumina or alumina powder, as they act as crack stoppers and are highly compatible to porcelain.

==== Dental composite materials ==== 
Tooth colored dental composite materials are either used as a direct filling or as the construction material for an indirect inlay. They are usually cured by light.

==== Nano-ceramic particles ==== 
Nano-ceramic particles embedded in a resin matrix are less brittle and therefore less likely to crack, or chip, than all-ceramic indirect fillings. They absorb the shock of chewing more like natural teeth, and more like resin or gold fillings, than do ceramic fillings; at the same time they are more resistant to wear than all-resin indirect fillings. They are available in blocks for use with CAD/CAM systems.

==== Gold fillings ==== 
Gold fillings have excellent durability, wear well, and do not cause excessive wear to the opposing teeth, but they do conduct heat and cold, which can be irritating. There are two categories: cast gold fillings (gold inlays and onlays) made with 14 or 18 kt gold, and gold foil made with pure 24 kt gold that is burnished layer by layer. For years, they have been considered the benchmark of restorative dental materials. However, recent advances in dental porcelains and a consumer focus on aesthetic results have caused the demand for gold fillings to drop. Gold fillings are sometimes quite expensive, but they last a very long time, meaning that gold restorations are less costly and painful in the long run. It is not uncommon for a gold crown to last 30 years.

===Other historical fillings===

Lead fillings were used in the 18th century, but became unpopular in the 19th century because of their softness. This was before lead poisoning was understood.

According to American Civil War-era dental handbooks, since the early 19th century metallic fillings had been made of lead, gold, tin, platinum, silver, aluminum, or amalgam. A pellet was rolled slightly larger than the cavity, condensed into place with instruments, then shaped and polished in the patient&#x27;s mouth. The filling was usually left &quot;high&quot;, with final condensation—&quot;tamping down&quot;—occurring while the patient chewed food. Gold foil was the most popular filling material during the Civil War. Tin and amalgam were also popular due to lower cost, but were held in lower regard.

One survey of dental practices in the mid-19th century catalogued dental fillings found in the remains of seven Confederate soldiers from the Civil War. They were made of:
*Gold foil: preferred because of its durability and safety.
*Platinum: rarely used because it was too hard, inflexible and difficult to form into foil.
*Aluminum: failed because of its lack of malleability but has been added to some amalgams.
*Tin and iron: believed to have been a very popular filling material during the Civil War. Tin foil was recommended when a cheaper material than gold was requested by the patient, but it wore down rapidly; even if it could be replaced cheaply and quickly, there was a concern, specifically from Chapin A. Harris, that it would oxidise in the mouth and cause a recurrence of caries. Due to blackening, tin was only recommended for posterior teeth.
*Thorium: the element&#x27;s radioactivity was unknown at that time, and the dentist probably thought he was working with tin.
*Lead and tungsten mixture: probably from shotgun pellets. Lead was rarely used in the 19th century, as it is soft and quickly worn down by mastication, and had known harmful health effects.

=== Acrylic polymers ===
Acrylics are used in the fabrication of dentures, artificial teeth, impression trays, maxillofacial / orthodontic appliances and temporary (provisional) restorations. They cannot be used as tooth filling materials because they can lead to pulpitis and periodontitis, as they may generate heat and acids during setting, and in addition they shrink.

===Failure of dental restorations===

Fillings have a finite lifespan; composites appear to have a higher failure rate than amalgam over five to seven years. How well people keep their teeth clean and avoid cavities is probably a more important factor than the material chosen for the restoration.

===Evaluation and regulation of dental materials===
The Nordic Institute of Dental Materials (NIOM) performs several tests to evaluate dental products in the Nordic countries. In the European Union, dental materials are classified as medical devices according to the Medical Devices Directive. In USA, the Food and Drug Administration is the regulatory body for dental products.

<doc id="498208" wikidata="Q57988393" url="?curid=498208" title="California Zephyr (1949–1970)">
<text>The California Zephyr was a passenger train that ran between Chicago, Illinois, and Oakland, California, via Omaha, Denver, Salt Lake City, Winnemucca, Oroville and Pleasanton in the United States. It was operated by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy (CB&amp;Q), Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western (D&amp;RGW) and Western Pacific (WP) railroads, all of which dubbed it &quot;the most talked about train in America&quot; on March 19, 1949, with the first departure the following day. The train was scheduled to pass through the most spectacular scenery on its route in the daylight. The original train ceased operation in 1970, though the D&amp;RGW continued to operate its own passenger service, the &quot;Rio Grande Zephyr&quot;, between Salt Lake City and Denver, using the original equipment until 1983. In 1983 a second iteration of the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, an Amtrak service, was formed. The current version of the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; operates partially over the route of the original &quot;Zephyr&quot; and partially over the route of its former rival, the &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;.

==History==
===Pre-&quot;California Zephyr&quot; (1939 to 1949)===

In 1939, the Golden Gate International Exposition opened on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay. The CB&amp;Q, D&amp;RGW and WP decided to operate a train that could take passengers to the event. Service on the &quot;Exposition Flyer&quot; began on June 10, 1939. In the beginning, the train used steam locomotives as motive power and consisted of heavyweight Pullman standard cars. In later years, the train used diesel power and in the final months of service used streamlined passenger cars. Initially, the service was to be temporary, but its popularity made it a significant rival to the &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;, the Chicago-Oakland train operated jointly by the Chicago &amp; Northwestern, Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, and it remained in operation until 1949. The CB&amp;Q, D&amp;RGW and Western Pacific replaced the &quot;Exposition Flyer&quot; in 1949 with the all-streamlined &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, which used the same route.

===&quot;California Zephyr&quot;===
In its original run, the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; operated over the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (Burlington Route) from Chicago to Denver, Colorado, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad between Denver and Salt Lake City, Utah, and the Western Pacific Railroad from Salt Lake City to Oakland, California. Cars owned by different railroads ran together; cars cycled in and out for service, repairs, and varying passenger loads with the seasons.

The first train was named in San Francisco by Eleanor Parker, but the WP entered it in the same way that railroads like the DL&amp;W, Erie, and CNJ/RDG/B&amp;O entered New York City: by ferry, and not by rail. California Lieutenant Governor Goodwin Knight, mayor of San Francisco Elmer Robinson, and WP President Harry A. Mitchell looked on. For the inaugural run in 1949, every woman on the train was given &quot;silver&quot; and orange orchids flown from Hilo, Hawaii. The car hostesses were known as Zephyrettes.

In summer 1954, the scheduled run for the 2,532 miles from Chicago to San Francisco was 50 hours 50 minutes. An eastbound &quot;California Zephyr&quot; through Ruby Canyon saw the train&#x27;s first birth on March 1, 1955, when Reed Zars was born on board.

Knowing that they could not begin to compete with the faster and less-rugged route used by the &quot;City of San Francisco,&quot; the Burlington Route, D&amp;RGW and WP billed the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; as a scenic &quot;rail cruise&quot; through the Rockies.

===Zephyrettes===
The brainchild of Velma McPeek, the Burlington&#x27;s Supervisor of Passenger Train Services, the Zephyrettes were train hostesses who performed a wide variety of roles, from tour guide to first-aid responder to babysitter. After debuting on the &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot; in 1936, they served on the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; from 1949 until it was discontinued in 1970. Described by former Zephyrette Julie Ann Lyman as &quot;the railroad&#x27;s answer to the air line stewardess&quot;, the various duties of the position included welcoming passengers, making announcements, sending telegrams, making dinner reservations, and generally serving as a liaison between the train&#x27;s passengers and its crew. At any one time, there were 10 or 11 Zephyrettes who were actively employed. When Amtrak revived the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; in 1983, it invited a former Zephyrette, Beulah Bauman, to christen the train.

A pair of the Western Pacific&#x27;s Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDCs), replacements for the &quot;Royal Gorge&quot; (trains No. 1 and 2), also used the name &quot;Zephyrette&quot;. From September 15, 1950, to October 2, 1960, they were in service between Oakland, California, and Salt Lake City, a distance of , which made the route the longest RDC service in the United States.

===Discontinued ferry connection===

The last portion of route utilizing the bay ferries ended in 1958 and replaced by bus service.

The opening of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and San Francisco Transbay Terminal in 1930s offered alternative rail connections directly into San Francisco until the 1950s. Declining rail ridership prompted ending rail connection and even the Transbay Terminal became a bus depot.

===Decline and replacement===

The &quot;California Zephyr&quot; was not immune to falling passenger travel in the 1960s; moreover, it began to lose money even when sold out. The Western Pacific applied to discontinue its portion in 1966, but the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) refused after public outcry. The D&amp;RGW made the same request in 1969 and in 1970 the ICC permitted Western Pacific to end its portion, provided the D&amp;RGW and Burlington Northern Railroad provide &quot;some semblance of [service]&quot; between Chicago and Ogden, Utah. The last westbound &quot;California Zephyr&quot; to the west coast left Chicago on March 22, 1970, and arrived in Oakland two days later. The original &quot;California Zephyr&quot; had operated for 21 years and 2 days. East of Salt Lake City the train was reduced to a tri-weekly schedule, operating as &quot;California Service&quot; on the Burlington Northern and as the &quot;Rio Grande Zephyr&quot; on the Rio Grande. The Rio Grande portion of the train was extended beyond Salt Lake to Ogden, Utah, allowing Nevada and California passengers to connect to the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;. This continued until the creation of Amtrak on May 1, 1971.

Amtrak intended to revive the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; as part its original route network in 1971, using the Burlington Northern east of Denver, the Rio Grande between Denver and Ogden, and the Southern Pacific west of Ogden, Utah. At the last minute, the Rio Grande refused to join Amtrak, fearing the new company&#x27;s passenger trains would interfere with profitable freight traffic. This forced Amtrak to use the Union Pacific&#x27;s Overland Route through southern Wyoming instead of going across Colorado. Between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1972, passengers traveling between Chicago and Oakland would have to travel on two different trains: the &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot;, which operated daily between Chicago and Denver, and the &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;, which operated three times a week between Denver and the San Francisco Bay Area. Eventually, however, after several false starts, Amtrak consolidated the two trains into one, dubbed the &quot;San Francisco Zephyr&quot; in homage to both the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; and the &quot;San Francisco Chief&quot; between Chicago and Oakland. The Rio Grande continued to operate the &quot;Rio Grande Zephyr&quot; between Denver and Ogden.

In 1983 the D&amp;RGW elected to join Amtrak, citing increasing losses in passenger operations. Amtrak re-routed the &quot;San Francisco Zephyr&quot; over the D&amp;RGW&#x27;s Moffat Subdivision between Denver and Salt Lake City, its original preference from 1971. The change was scheduled for April 25, but a mudslide at Thistle, Utah, closed the line and delayed the change until July 16. With the change of route, Amtrak renamed the train as the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;. The modern &quot;California Zephyr&quot; uses mostly the same route as the original east of Winnemucca, Nevada. The train uses the route of the former &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;, along the Overland Route (First transcontinental railroad), between Elko, Nevada, and Sacramento. Across central Nevada, the two rail lines have been combined under owner Union Pacific to use directional running. As such, the exact spot the train switches lines depends on the direction of travel.

==Route description==
Both the current and original iterations of the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; operate on Chicago, Burlington and Quincy (today part of BNSF Railway) between Chicago and Denver, and the former Denver and Rio Grande Western main line from Denver to Salt Lake (today part of Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Central Corridor). West of Salt Lake City both iterations departed Salt Lake on the Shafter Subdivision of the former Western Pacific Railroad and crossed much of Nevada using the Elko Subdivision.

The routes of the two iterations of the California Zephyr diverge at the rail junction of Weso, Nevada (near Winnemucca). The current iteration uses the Overland Route from this point west, the route used by the City of San Francisco. The original &quot;California Zephyr&quot; used the Feather River Route as its path through the Sierra Nevada. Instead of passing through Reno, the original &quot;Zephyr&quot; was routed via Gerlach, Nevada, and in California passed through Portola, Oroville, Sacramento, Stockton and Pleasanton before arriving at the Oakland depot. The Feather River Route is still in use for freight; however, no longer hosts a regularly scheduled passenger service. This portion of the route mostly parallels State Route 70.

The Oakland terminal was originally the Southern Pacific Mole, where a ferry service was available to San Francisco. After July 1958, trains terminated at the Western Pacific Depot.

==Equipment==

The Budd Company manufactured six ten-car trainsets; three went to the Burlington, two to the Western Pacific and one to the Rio Grande. In line with the train&#x27;s sightseeing schedule, each set included five of the new &quot;Vista-Domes&quot; (three coaches, a dormitory-lounge, and a sleeper-observation car). The &quot;California Zephyr&quot; was the first long-distance train to carry domes in regular service. In addition, each consist included a baggage car, a dining car, a 16-section sleeping car and three 10-roomette 6-double bedroom sleeping cars. The Pennsylvania Railroad owned a single 10-roomette 6-double bedroom sleeping car, the &quot;Silver Rapids&quot;, which was used for through service to New York City.

Each car was named: all names began with &quot;Silver…&quot; with each type of car having a different theme; the baggage cars were named after animals, the dome coaches had a western theme, the lounge and dining cars had a catering theme, the 16-section cars were named after trees, the 10-6 cars carried names associated with the suffixes used for types of Pullman sleeping cars, while the observation cars&#x27; names emphasised their domes.

The forward section of the first Vista-Dome car was partitioned off and reserved for women and children. A door was located in the corridor under the dome just behind the women&#x27;s restroom to allow access to the reserved section. Early on, this reserved section was opened up to all passengers and the door and partitions were removed. Ownership of the cars was split between the three railroads almost evenly across all car types. Each car was owned by one railroad, but the ownership of the cars in any one day&#x27;s train depended more on what was available at the terminals than whose railroad the train was operating over.

Generally positioned as the second Vista-Dome coach was the car referred to as the &quot;Conductor&#x27;s Car&quot;. This car was like the other Vista-Dome coaches, except a small booth with a bench seat and desk for the conductor was located in the B end.

In 1952 another type of Pullman sleeper (6-double bedrooms 5-compartments) was added to each consist; they ran as the leading sleeping car as line CZ16, and carried the names of birds as their &quot;Silver…&quot; theme. In addition, the Burlington bought another observation car, another 16-section car, and two 10-6 cars. With the new cars delivered that year, cars arriving in Chicago on the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; were made available for use on the &quot;Ak-Sar-Ben Zephyr&quot; for an overnight round trip to Lincoln, Nebraska. When the cars returned from Lincoln the next day, they were placed back in the westbound &quot;California Zephyr&#x27;s&quot; consist for the next train out of Chicago that afternoon.

The Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s transcontinental sleeping car to and from New York was eliminated in October 1957, owing to declining ridership.

During the winter 1963–1964 season, all seven 16-section cars were withdrawn and rebuilt as 48-seat (non-dome) coaches. They went back into service carrying the same names and were placed between the baggage car and the dome coaches as line CZ23. The Burlington renumbered their cars but the Rio Grande and Western Pacific retained the existing fleet numbers on their cars.

===Preservation===

The high-quality Budd-built cars of the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; have proven to be popular with private car owners. Several operate in private charter service on Amtrak, including dome-observation car &quot;Silver Solarium&quot;, dome-coach &quot;Silver Lariat&quot;, sleepers &quot;Silver Rapids&quot; and &quot;Silver Quail&quot; and a dome lounge now known as the &quot;Sierra Hotel&quot;. In 2018, the &quot;Silver Lariat&quot;, &quot;Silver Solarium&quot;, &quot;Silver Rapids&quot; and the baggage car &quot;Silver Peak&quot; were sold to the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad outside Cleveland, Ohio and entered service there in September 2018.

Seven museums currently hold equipment once used on the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;:

* The largest collection of preserved equipment can be found in Portola, California, at the Western Pacific Railroad Museum. One locomotive and four cars are currently preserved there as part of the museum&#x27;s &quot;Zephyr Project&quot; restoration program. Western Pacific 805-A is the last intact locomotive built specifically for the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;. The cars include dome-lounge &quot;Silver Hostel&quot;, dome coaches &quot;Silver Lodge&quot; and &quot;Silver Rifle&quot; (on long-term loan from the Golden Gate Railroad Museum) and the diner &quot;Silver Plate&quot;. The Heart of Dixie Railroad Museum in Calera, Alabama, owns the Silver Maple (ex-CB&amp;Q 400 [sleeper], rebuilt 1963 to chair car configuration, CB&amp;Q 4742) now numbered 4741. The Silver Maple is used in regular excursion service.
* The Illinois Railway Museum owns several Burlington locomotives that were used to pull the train on occasion, Rio Grande dome coach &quot;Silver Pony&quot;, and WP baggage car &quot;Silver Beaver&quot;.
* The Colorado Railroad Museum has two Rio Grande locomotives that also saw &quot;California Zephyr&quot; and later &quot;Rio Grande Zephyr&quot; service.
* The Gold Coast Railroad Museum in Florida owns two former Western Pacific Railroad &quot;California Zephyr&quot; cars: baggage car &quot;Silver Stag&quot; and dome-observation car &quot;Silver Crescent&quot;.
* The Avon Park Depot Museum in Florida owns one former Western Pacific &quot;California Zephyr&quot; car: the &quot;Silver Palm&quot;, originally a sleeper car, is now a buffet dining car used by the museum for dinner parties. The car was converted to its buffet car state by the Auto-Train Corporation when it bought the car.
* The Austin Steam Train Association, which operates the Austin &amp; Texas Central Railroad in the Hill Country between Cedar Park and Burnet, has completed its restoration of the &quot;Silver Pine&quot;. Originally a 16-section sleeper manufactured in 1948 by the Budd Company, the coach car re-entered revenue service in 2011 for the first time since its Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western days.

Three diner cars were in revenue service with Amtrak as of 2015, but are now retired.

====Replicas====
A non-functional replica of the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; was displayed at Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim, California. It housed Baker&#x27;s Field Bakery and Bur-r-r Bank ice cream counter cafes at the Sunshine Plaza main entrance. The exhibit closed on July 31, 2011, as part of the park&#x27;s $1.1 billion overhaul. Disney gave the replica to the Western Pacific Railroad Museum in Portola, California.

== In popular culture ==
Hank Williams&#x27; 1956 single &quot;California Zephyr&quot; is likely his take on the traditional &quot;Wabash Cannonball,&quot; made famous by his hero Roy Acuff; the melody and references to American cities and towns are strikingly similar.

Jack Kerouac&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;Big Sur&quot; opens with a trip to California on the train:

...I had sneaked into San Francisco as I say, coming 3,000 miles from my home in Long Island (Northport) in a pleasant roomette on the California Zephyr train watching American roll by outside my private picture window, really happy for the first time in three years, staying in the roomette all three days and three nights with my instant coffee and sandwiches...

Ben Gibbard and Jay Farrar’s 2009 music album &quot;One Fast Move or I&#x27;m Gone&quot; and the associated documentary of the same name are based on Kerouac&#x27;s novel &quot;Big Sur.&quot; The record opens with a song called “California Zephyr.”

Grant Hart (of Hüsker Dü fame) wrote a song called &quot;California Zephyr&quot; for his 2009 album &quot;Hot Wax&quot;. The song may be a paean to gay liberation, especially following the AIDS epidemic.

<doc id="498211" wikidata="Q1675125" url="?curid=498211" title="Jesus of Montreal">
<text>Jesus of Montreal () is a 1989 Canadian comedy drama film written and directed by Denys Arcand, and starring Lothaire Bluteau, Catherine Wilkening and Johanne-Marie Tremblay. The film tells the story of a group of actors in Montreal who perform a passion play in a Quebec church (the film uses the grounds of Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory on Mount Royal), combining religious belief with unconventional theories on a historical Jesus. As the church turns against the main actor and author of the play, his life increasingly mirrors the story of Jesus, and the film adapts numerous stories from the New Testament.

The film came out to critical acclaim and won numerous awards, including the Genie Award for Best Picture and the Jury Prize at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. The film was also nominated for the 1989 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Critics in the Toronto International Film Festival have regarded the film as one of the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.

==Plot==
In Montreal, an unknown actor named Daniel is hired by a Roman Catholic pilgrimage&#x27;s site (&quot;le sanctuaire&quot;) to present a passion play in its gardens. The priest, Father Leclerc, asks him to &quot;modernize&quot; the classic play the church has been using, which he considers dated. Despite working with material others consider to be clichéd, Daniel is inspired and carries out intensive academic research, consulting archaeology to check the historicity of Jesus and drawing on supposed information on Jesus in the Talmud, using the Talmud name Yeshua Ben Pantera for Jesus, whom he portrays. He includes arguments that the biological father of Jesus was a Roman soldier who left Palestine shortly after impregnating the unwed Mary. He assembles his cast, found from insignificant and disreputable backgrounds (one being a man who does pornographic voiceovers), and moves in with two of them, Constance and Mireille.

When the play is performed, the audience is thrilled; the show receives excellent reviews. Father Leclerc, however, regards it as controversial. He angrily distances himself from Daniel. The actor&#x27;s life is further complicated when he attends one of Mireille&#x27;s auditions. Mireille is told to remove her top, causing an outburst from Daniel in which he damages equipment and assaults a director, resulting in criminal charges. When the higher authorities of the Roman Catholic Church strongly object to his interpretation of Jesus and security forces stop a performance, the audience and actors oppose them and Daniel is injured in an ensuing accident.

Daniel is first taken by ambulance to an overrun Catholic hospital where he is neglected. He leaves and collapses on a Montreal Metro platform. The same ambulance takes him to the Jewish General Hospital. Despite immediate, skilled, and energetic efforts by the doctors and nurses, he is pronounced brain dead. His doctor asks for the consent of his friends, since he has no known relatives, to take his organs for donation, stating that they would have been able to save him if he had been brought in half an hour earlier. After his death, his eyes and heart are used to restore the health of other patients.

In the wake of his death, Daniel&#x27;s friends start a theatre company to carry on his work.

==Cast==
==Allegory==

Authors have written &quot;Jesus of Montreal&quot; has &quot;many parallels&quot; to the New Testament, and &quot;is so loaded with all sorts of fascinating allusions&quot; between modern Quebec and the Gospels. Daniel is mainly known to the public through &quot;hearsay&quot;, and is reported to have traveled to India and Tibet, reflecting &quot;extra-biblical legends&quot; about Jesus. The story begins when Daniel becomes a teacher to his actors, as Jesus was to his disciples. Another actor named Pascal Berger, played by Cédric Noël, praises Daniel as John the Baptist hailed Jesus. Pascal &quot;loses his head&quot; when an advertiser uses his photo to sell perfume, just as John the Baptist was beheaded.

Daniel&#x27;s outburst in the audition scene evokes the Cleansing of the Temple. In the subsequent criminal case, Daniel has a Pontius Pilate-like judge played by Arcand, and meets a lawyer, Richard Cardinal, played by Yves Jacques who – looking out over the city from a skyscraper – offers Daniel profit and fame, telling him &quot;The city is yours,&quot; which is a reference to the Temptation of Christ. After he is injured, Daniel is taken to the Jewish General Hospital. Arcand said this is a deliberate parallel with Jesus being a Jew &quot;rejected by his own people,&quot; but Arcand depicted the hospital as efficient and better organized than other Montreal hospitals because he felt this was accurate. Scholar Jeremy Cohen tied the Jewish doctor&#x27;s statement &quot;we lost him&quot; to the idea of Jewish deicide. At the end, Daniel&#x27;s organs are donated to distant patients who speak various languages, echoing Jesus&#x27; miracles restoring sight to the blind and raising of the dead, as well as symbolizing his own resurrection and influence around the world. Daniel&#x27;s &quot;disciples&quot; also continue his work after he dies, led by Martin, played by Rémy Girard, who is an analogue of Saint Peter, but under the guidance of Cardinal, suggesting that by institutionalizing their message it may become corrupted.

==Production==
===Development===

The idea for the film came to director Denys Arcand after an actor apologized for appearing with a beard at an audition at a Montreal conservatory, saying &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m Jesus.&quot; The actor explained that he had the role of Jesus in a passion play at Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory. Arcand went to see the play and recalls, &quot;I saw actors in a mediocre production which received shouted applause from the tourists. I decided I had to make a film.&quot; The actor also spoke to Arcand about the difficulties he and his friends had in the acting profession, taking undesirable roles in TV advertisements and pornographic films.

As a lapsed Catholic and self-proclaimed atheist, Arcand did not envision &quot;Jesus of Montreal&quot; as a religious film, adding, &quot;In my film, the story of the Passion is a metaphor of an artist and his struggles and temptations.&quot; He spent a year in 1987 writing the screenplay. The film was made on a budget of $4.2 million, with Arcand saying he got a &quot;blank check&quot; after his success with &quot;The Decline of the American Empire&quot; (1986). This budget was unusually large for a Quebec film. The film received $500,000 from the National Film Board of Canada.

===Casting===
Arcand saw actress Johanne-Marie Tremblay in &quot;Straight for the Heart&quot; (1988) and cast her as Constance, one of Daniel&#x27;s actresses who takes him in to live with her. She reprised her role as Constance in Arcand&#x27;s later films &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot; (2003) and &quot;Days of Darkness&quot; (2007).

Robert Lepage, who played René, one of Daniel&#x27;s &quot;disciples&quot;, was a playwright and said that aside from TV and student films, &quot;Jesus of Montreal&quot; was his first major acting role. He said that the screenplay was complete and detailed, leaving less room for improvisation than he expected.

===Filming===

The film was shot with mobile cameras on location in Montreal, which has many churches against its skyline and has been &quot;a center of Catholicism since its beginnings&quot;. Arcand stated he often shot Montreal from a distance or from the air to represent God viewing the city.

He claimed that while French-Canadian churches in Montreal denied permission to shoot inside their buildings, an English-language Catholic church allowed the crew to use its space. He said this was because, although church members asked to see the screenplay, they could not read French and needed money from the rental. Some scenes were shot near Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory. A substantial amount of theatrical blood was required for the passion play scenes.

==Reception==

===Box office===
In Canada, it won the Golden Reel Award, indicating the highest box-office performance of any Canadian film that year with a gross of C$2.53 million in Canada. It went on to gross C$3 million. In English Canada, it was among only three Canadian films to gross over $500,000 between 1987 and 1990, along with &quot;Black Robe&quot; and &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; with a gross of C$747,000.

&quot;Jesus of Montreal&quot; did not enjoy the degree of success in France as Arcand&#x27;s prior &quot;The Decline of the American Empire&quot; (1986), drawing an audience of 187,827 people, the eighth highest for a Quebec film to date. Generally, the film did not meet expectations in drawing audiences in countries with predominantly Roman Catholic populations, with Arcand claiming using the name Jesus in the title made the subject matter appear cliché. In the U.S., Stephen J. Nichols referred to it as &quot;not-very-popular&quot; and said it was Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; &quot;to dominate the 1980s&quot; in dramatic portrayals of Jesus.

===Critical reception===

&quot;Jesus of Montreal&quot; enjoyed mostly positive review. The film has an approval rating of 69% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 16 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10. 

Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars, calling Arcand &quot;the best of the new generation of Quebec filmmakers&quot;, and saying &quot;It&#x27;s interesting the way Arcand makes this work as theology and drama at the same time&quot;, adding Lothaire Bluteau is perfectly cast. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;intelligent&quot; and &quot;audacious&quot;, particularly praising the first half &quot;before it gives in to leaden, self-conscious Christ imagery&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote &quot;Arcand has exposed a world that can&#x27;t recognize its own hypocrisy or hear a voice in the wilderness&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum called it a &quot;must-see&quot;. David Denby of &quot;New York&quot;, however, felt &quot;Jesus of Montreal&quot; was &quot;smug from the beginning&quot;, but the film was not boring thanks to Arcand&#x27;s &quot;theatricality and skill&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a C−, questioning the controversy depicted in the film, saying &quot;Hasn’t Canada, in the past 20 years, ever seen a single touring company of &quot;Jesus Christ, Superstar&quot;?&quot; and claiming the film &quot;flits between the smug and the ersatz mystical&quot;. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said the scenes where Daniel collects his actors are the best part of the film, but the rest is outdated. In terms of religious response, &quot;Jesus of Montreal&quot; met &quot;dead calm&quot; on its release, in contrast to Scorsese&#x27;s more controversial &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;.

Critics in the Toronto International Film Festival ranked the film second in the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time in 1993 and 2004 and fourth in 2015. In 2003, Rob Mackie of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the film &quot;thought-provoking and wickedly funny&quot; and said &quot;Lothaire Bluteau, makes a charismatic focus whose performance makes sense of the whole thing&quot;. In 2010, British critic Mark Kermode named Bluteau as one of &quot;The 10 best screen faces of Jesus,&quot; calling him &quot;mesmerising&quot; and praising the film as a &quot;genuine masterpiece&quot; and &quot;real cinematic miracle&quot;. In 2014, Marc-Andre Lussier of the Montreal-based &quot;La Presse&quot; called the film excellent. &quot;E! Online&quot; named it the third best &quot;Jesus-inspired&quot; film, calling it &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;inventive&quot;.

In 2001, an industry poll conducted by &quot;Playback&quot; named it the sixth best Canadian film of the preceding 15 years.

<doc id="498214" wikidata="Q633026" url="?curid=498214" title="City of New Orleans (train)">
<text>The City of New Orleans is a long-distance passenger train operated by Amtrak in the Central United States between Chicago and New Orleans. The overnight train takes about 19 hours to complete its route, making major stops in Champaign–Urbana, Carbondale, Memphis, and Jackson as well as in other small towns. 

The &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; was first initiated by the Illinois Central Railroad in 1947 as the daytime complement to the &quot;Panama Limited&quot;, a night train dating back to 1911. In 1971 both routes were conveyed to Amtrak, which retained only the &quot;Panama Limited&quot;. In 1981 Amtrak revived the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; name for the train, still on an overnight schedule, on the heels of the popular song of the same name by Steve Goodman.

Additional corridor service on the northern segment of the route is provided by the &quot;Illini&quot; and &quot;Saluki&quot; between Chicago and Carbondale, Illinois. The &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; is the only Amtrak train to serve Tennessee.

During fiscal year 2023, the train carried 233,876 passengers, an increase of 50.3% from FY2022. In FY2016, the last year that route-specific revenue data was given, the train had a total revenue of $18,706,915, a 3.7% decrease from FY2015.

==History==

===Illinois Central===
The Illinois Central Railroad introduced the original &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; on April 27, 1947. It was a daytime, all-coach companion to the overnight &quot;Panama Limited,&quot; which had been all-Pullman for most of its run. EMD E7 diesel locomotives pulled new lightweight Pullman Company coaches. The route, which the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; covered in 15 hours 55 minutes, was the longest daytime schedule in the United States. The &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; exchanged St. Louis—New Orleans through cars at Carbondale, Illinois and Louisville—New Orleans cars at Fulton, Kentucky. The average speed of the new train was nearly with a maximum of ; a result of the largely flat route of the Illinois Central along the Mississippi River. By October 25, 1959, the timetable had lengthened to 16 hours 30 minutes. The train remained popular throughout the 1960s and gained ex-Missouri Pacific Railroad dome coaches in 1967.

===Amtrak===

When Amtrak assumed operation of U.S. passenger train service on May 1, 1971, it dropped the &quot;Panama Limited&quot; in favor of retaining the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; on the traditional daytime schedule. At that time the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; was one of four trains that called at Chicago&#x27;s Central Station, which was originally Illinois Central&#x27;s terminal in Chicago. All Amtrak trains were consolidated to Union Station by March 1972. Inauspiciously, the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; was involved in Amtrak&#x27;s first fatal derailment on June 10, near Salem, Illinois. Because this train made no connections with other trains at either New Orleans or Chicago, Amtrak moved the train to an overnight schedule on November 14, 1971, and renamed it the &quot;Panama Limited&quot;.

In February 1981, Amtrak restored the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; name while retaining the overnight schedule; Amtrak hoped to capitalize on the popularity of the song written by Steve Goodman and recorded in 1972 by Arlo Guthrie. A Kansas City section, the &quot;River Cities,&quot; began operation on April 29, 1984. It separated from the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; at Centralia, Illinois (later Carbondale) and ran to Kansas City via St. Louis. This section ended on November 4, 1994. The northbound &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; began stopping at Gilman, Illinois, on October 26, 1986. Gilman had last seen service in 1971; the &quot;Illini&quot; stopped there as well. Service to Cairo, Illinois, south of Carbondale, ended on October 25, 1987.

Amtrak operated the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; reliably through the 1980s and into the 1990s; in 1992, the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; had the highest on-time performance rate of all Amtrak services at 87%. Nevertheless, on-board service had declined; &quot;Trains&quot; magazine editor J. David Ingles called the train &quot;Amtrak&#x27;s least-glamorous long-distance train&quot;. On March 3, 1994, new Superliner cars replaced the single-level cars. Real dining service returned; by the early 1990s an Amfleet dinette had doubled with the lounge car.

On September 10, 1995, the train was rerouted between Memphis and Jackson due to the Illinois Central&#x27;s desire to abandon the original route (the Grenada District) in favor of the newer and flatter Yazoo District. Five towns in the Mississippi Delta lost service–Batesville, Grenada, Winona, Durant, and Canton.

On March 15, 1999, the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; collided with a flatbed semi-trailer near Bourbonnais. Of the 217 people aboard the train, eleven people were killed in the Bourbonnais train accident. The fourth car, where the fatalities occurred, was engulfed in flames following the collision at the crossing.

Because of damage in Mississippi and Louisiana due to Hurricane Katrina, Amtrak was forced in late August 2005 to truncate the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; at Memphis, Tennessee. Service was first restored as far south as Hammond, Louisiana, and on October 8, 2005, Amtrak resumed service to New Orleans. In December 2005 Arlo Guthrie, who helped popularize the song &quot;City of New Orleans&quot;, led a fundraiser aboard the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; and at several stops along the train&#x27;s route to help in the hurricane recovery efforts.

The train began stopping at Marks, Mississippi, on April 4, 2018, following the completion of a new station.

Starting October 1, 2019, traditional dining car services were removed and replaced with a reduced menu of &#x27;Flexible Dining&#x27; options.

From October 1, 2020, to May 31, 2021, daily service was reduced to three trains per week due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

====Proposed expansion====

In 2016, Amtrak released a study on bringing passenger rail to the Gulf Coast that recommended extending the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; to Orlando, Florida along trackage once traversed by the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; but unserved since Hurricane Katrina.

The Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE) is in the preliminary design phase for the Grand Crossing Project. This project will reroute the &quot;Illini&quot;, &quot;Saluki&quot;, and &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; trains from CN&#x27;s tracks to Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Chicago Line in the Greater Grand Crossing neighborhood in Chicago. This will eliminate a time-consuming switchback on the St. Charles Air Line into Chicago Union Station.

In 2023, Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport began seeking federal funding for a people mover linking the airport to a new station serving the planned New Orleans–Baton Rouge passenger rail service, as well as the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot;.

==Route details==

The &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; uses rail lines that were once part of the Illinois Central Railroad system, and are now owned by the Canadian National Railway (CN):
*St. Charles Air Line Railroad (IC), Chicago Union Station to the shore of Lake Michigan, now CN
*Illinois Central Railroad Chicago Branch and main line, Chicago to Cairo, Illinois, now CN
*Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad (IC), Cairo to Fulton, Kentucky, now CN
*Chesapeake, Ohio and Southwestern Railroad (IC), Fulton to Memphis, Tennessee, now CN
*Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad (IC), Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi, now CN
*Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad (IC), Jackson to New Orleans, Louisiana, now CN

, the southbound &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; leaves Chicago at 8 p.m., traveling overnight through southern Illinois and Kentucky for arrival at breakfast time the following morning in Memphis, lunchtime in Jackson, and mid-afternoon in New Orleans. Northbound trains leave New Orleans in early afternoon, arriving in Jackson in early evening, then traveling through Tennessee and southern Illinois overnight before arriving in Champaign-Urbana at breakfast time the following morning and Chicago just after rush hour.

The train is the sole Amtrak service in Tennessee, making stops at and .

In fiscal year 2004, the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; achieved an on-time performance rating of 67.6%. The train&#x27;s average on-time performance rating for fiscal year 2006 was 86.8%, reaching as high as 93.5% for the month of May 2006.

==Folk song==

&quot;City of New Orleans&quot; is a folk song written and first performed by Steve Goodman in 1970 and subsequently recorded by Arlo Guthrie in 1972. Many other artists, notably Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, John Denver (with slightly different lyrics), Judy Collins, and Jerry Reed have also recorded it. The song lyrics trace the trail of the train route in mourning the &quot;&quot;...disappearin&#x27; railroad blues...&quot;.&quot;

Tom Rush performed and recorded a folk song (based on some Bukka White songs) about the &quot;Panama Limited&quot;, the overnight train along the same route as the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot;.

<doc id="498217" wikidata="Q1411079" url="?curid=498217" title="Machina/The Machines of God">
<text>Machina/The Machines of God is the fifth studio album by the American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins, released on February 29, 2000, by Virgin Records. A concept album, it marked the return of drummer Jimmy Chamberlin and was intended to be the band&#x27;s final official LP release prior to their initial breakup in 2000. A sequel album—&quot;Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music&quot;—was later released independently via the Internet, and in highly limited quantities for the physical version.

Following the electronic and industrial rock elements established by its predecessor, &quot;Adore&quot;, &quot;Machina&quot; again proved controversial to the band&#x27;s fan base and failed to reconnect them with chart-topping success. However, after the relatively brief &quot;Adore&quot; tour, the new lineup with Chamberlin and the former Hole bass guitarist Melissa Auf der Maur mounted longer international tours that returned the live incarnation of the band to a guitar-driven hard rock style.

== Background and concept ==
After the &quot;Adore&quot; tour ended in the second half of 1998, lead singer/guitarist Billy Corgan immediately began to work on new material, playing new songs as early as October of that year. In the same month, the four original band members convened, and decided that Jimmy Chamberlin would rejoin the band, and that a final album and tour would be mounted before the group disbanded permanently. &quot;If you want to know what Jimmy brings back to the band,&quot; Corgan told &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;then listen to &quot;Adore&quot; and this new record back-to-back. It speaks for itself.&quot; According to an August 19, 2014 interview with Ryan Leas, Corgan explained, &quot;I was thinking like, you know, what the Beatles did with Sgt. Pepper’s. Why can’t we make a really different type of record? So that was my thinking going into it.&quot;

Corgan envisioned a lengthy concept album in conjunction with a musical theater approach to a tour, based around the idea of the band playing exaggerated versions of themselves, as the press and public seemed to view them. He later explained, &quot;the band had become such cartoon characters at that point in the way we were portrayed in the media, the idea was that we would sort of go out and pretend we were the cartoon characters.&quot; From there, a story was conceived revolving around a rock star named Zero (based on the public persona of Corgan) hearing the voice of God, renaming himself Glass, and renaming his band The Machines of God. Fans of the band were referred to as the &quot;Ghost Children&quot;.

Corgan originally wanted &quot;Machina&quot; to be a double album, but Virgin Records was not interested after the disappointing sales of &quot;Adore&quot;.

== Recording ==
Much like previous albums, the songs were first tracked acoustically at Corgan&#x27;s house in late 1998 before the band set to work on them at their practice space and the Chicago Recording Company. The recording was conducted with the team responsible for finishing &quot;Adore&quot; – co-producer Flood and engineers Howard Willing and Bjorn Thorsrud.

The band took a break from recording in April 1999 to embark on the Arising! tour, which took the band to nine small clubs. After the tour&#x27;s conclusion, the bass guitarist, D&#x27;arcy Wretzky, left the band, leaving the rest of them in a difficult position. Corgan later said, &quot;This put a stress obviously on the full integrity of the project, because it was connected to the band not only bringing the music to fruition fully, but also the public component of being in character. I ended up in a broken band with a half-ass enthusiasm towards finishing a project already started.&quot;

Flood later remembered, &quot;We decided that we were going to have to make a very different kind of record [...] we pretty much went back to the drawing board. Certain songs on the record are survivors from that first period, but it meant a shift in the ways songs had to be formed.&quot;

Corgan described the new recording process for &quot;Machina&quot;, now focused more on the song development than on the concept:

In the end, the theatrical qualities of the live performances and appearances were mostly abandoned. Many of the songs on the album refer to the ending of love and relationships (both romantic and otherwise), most of them obvious references to the band themselves. Corgan described &quot;This Time&quot; as &quot;my love song to the band&quot;. According to Corgan, the album was structured so that the first eight tracks would be &quot;more poppy&quot;, and the last seven &quot;more arty&quot;. Generally, Corgan appraised the sound of the album as &quot;a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll approach with pop sensibility&quot;. After the electronica-influenced &quot;Adore&quot;, &quot;Machina&quot; was a return to the distorted guitar sound of previous albums, though synthesizers and acoustic guitars were still heavily used.

== Marketing and release ==

&quot;Machina&quot; was released as a single album on February 29, 2000, with a bonus disc, &quot;Still Becoming Apart&quot;, available at certain stores.

A video was made for &quot;Stand Inside Your Love&quot;, the planned first single, in late 1999, but at the last minute, &quot;The Everlasting Gaze&quot; was issued as the album&#x27;s first promotional radio single in December 1999. &quot;Stand Inside Your Love&quot; was released as the first commercially available single on January 21, 2000. &quot;I of the Mourning&quot; was also released as a promotional single and received limited airplay. &quot;Heavy Metal Machine&quot; was issued as a promotional cassette but was not distributed to radio stations.

On March 9, the band went on the Thursday edition of &quot;@MTV Week&quot; at Broadway Studios in New York City for a half-hour live TV special. During the broadcast they performed &quot;The Everlasting Gaze&quot; as well as &quot;I of the Mourning&quot; after an online and call-in voting competition between three songs from &quot;Machina&quot;. The special also featured Carson Daly interviewing the band members and online chats with the band, and an interactive online video for &quot;The Crying Tree of Mercury&quot;.

On May 23, Corgan announced on KROQ-FM that the band would be breaking up at the end of the year. The band reconvened in a studio to finish off the leftover &quot;Machina&quot; tracks, but Virgin remained uninterested, so the band released &quot;Machina II&quot; on their own in September, handing them off to fans to distribute free over the Internet.

The video for the final single, &quot;Try, Try, Try&quot;, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, was released on September 11, 2000, but did not receive airplay in the US due to its graphic content.

=== Glass and The Machines of God ===

Although the full extent of the original concept went unrealized, the storyline of Glass was tied to the album&#x27;s release and marketing. A sequence of writings, by Corgan, were released under the name &quot;Glass and the Machines of God&quot; starting in the CD booklet and continuing over the Internet and elsewhere. Corgan challenged fans to solve the &quot;&quot;Machina&quot; mystery&quot; hinted at through it all, and in December 2000 posted his favorite fan interpretations.

The booklet artwork, a series of paintings by Vasily Kafanov, loosely told the album&#x27;s story while hinting at themes related to alchemy, chemistry, metallurgy, physics, medicine, astrology, semiotics, mysticism, spiritualism, and art. The album was nominated for a 2001 Grammy for Best Recording Package.

In June 2001, a viral marketing campaign written by Jim Evans and Ben Allgood was launched via the Smashing Pumpkins message board, encouraging users to seek out mysterious websites and video clips. This early example of an internet-based alternate reality game eventually unveiled the news of a new online animated series by Sony based on the &quot;Machina&quot; story. Due in part to the changing circumstances surrounding the album&#x27;s rollout, the series was shelved before any episodes were completed, though several portions have been leaked to YouTube. In a 2010 interview, Corgan commented on the abandoned cartoon, stating, &quot;Yeah, I think you can find a few bits and pieces, but it never got finished unfortunately. That would&#x27;ve at least explained what the fuck I was trying to do [laughs]. I&#x27;m not even sure now what I was trying to do. But I was trying to do something.&quot;
==Reception==
===Critical reception===
According to Metacritic, the album received generally favorable reviews, scoring 66 out of 100 based on 15 reviews.

Jim DeRogatis of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called &quot;Machina&quot; &quot;an exceedingly impressive and hard-driving record&quot; and contended that it was the band&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece&quot;.

&quot;&quot;Machina&quot; finds the quartet back at their grunge-rocking best&quot;, wrote Clark Collis in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. &quot;[Corgan] seems re-energised as a writer and singer with the likes of &#x27;Stand Inside Your Love&#x27; and &#x27;Try Try Try&#x27; standing among their best work to date, while the lyrical refrain of the epic &#x27;Glass and the Ghost Children&#x27; should please all those who like their rock music to be mean, moody and not a little psychotic.&quot;

In &quot;Q&quot;, Paul Elliott described it as &quot;mostly, a wonderful rock album&quot; that was &quot;not without its faults&quot;. &quot;&#x27;Heavy Metal Machine&#x27; is a hokey title for a dull rock song. &#x27;Glass and the Ghost Children&#x27; sounds like mid-&#x27;80s U2 pretending to be The Doors… Often Corgan is at his most effective when he keeps it simple... &#x27;With Every Light&#x27; is the gentlest song on &quot;Machina&quot;, and perhaps the best.&quot;

However, a few reviews were negative, such as &quot;NME&quot;″s, who criticized the album for &quot;[not sounding] like a band in love with the potential and power of music&quot;.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Machina&quot; is the second lowest-selling commercially released Pumpkins album to date, with US sales of 583,000 units up to 2005. Although it entered the US charts at number 3, selling 165,000 copies in its first week, sales declined sixty percent the second week, and continued to slide. Regarding the disappointing sales, Jimmy Chamberlin commented, &quot;It was like watching your kid flunking out of school after getting straight A&#x27;s for ten years.&quot; Corgan, in 2008, summarized the failures of the album: 

==Potential reissue==
In April 2011, Corgan told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that &quot;Machina&quot; was scheduled to be reissued as a resequenced double album with the &quot;Machina II&quot; material (as he had originally envisioned), with a release date of 2013. The original co-producer Flood will be involved with a complete remix of all the material and sequencing into its original order as a two-disc concept album. Part of the restored concept album will be a suite simulating a live Machines of God concert, possibly with crowd noise added, with a mix inspired by Kiss&#x27; &quot;Alive!&quot;.

In July 2015, it was reported that the reissue&#x27;s release was put on permanent hold due to legal troubles with the record label. Corgan has said he has spent a lot of time on this and wants it to be released, but the legal issues need to be resolved first. In August 2018, Billy answered an Instagram Q&amp;A about this. The question was &quot;Will the &quot;Machina&quot; reissue ever see the light of day?&quot; He answered &quot;Just signed legal settlement today on that. So yes&quot;. Corgan announced in later Q&amp;As that the reissue will feature completely new artwork and will not reuse any of the original &quot;Machina&quot; artwork by Vasily Kafanov.

As of January 28, 2021, the NME reports that the &quot;Machina&quot; reworking is complete and Billy Corgan states that it will contain at least 80 songs. As of 2025, there is no release date for the reissue.

<text>Paleoanthropology or paleo-anthropology is a branch of paleontology and anthropology which seeks to understand the early development of anatomically modern humans, a process known as , through the reconstruction of evolutionary kinship lines within the family Hominidae, working from biological evidence (such as petrified skeletal remains, bone fragments, footprints) and cultural evidence (such as stone tools, artifacts, and settlement localities).

The field draws from and combines primatology, paleontology, biological anthropology, and cultural anthropology. As technologies and methods advance, genetics plays an ever-increasing role, in particular to examine and compare DNA structure as a vital tool of research of the evolutionary kinship lines of related species and genera.

==Etymology==
The term paleoanthropology derives from Greek palaiós (παλαιός) &quot;old, ancient&quot;, ánthrōpos (ἄνθρωπος) &quot;man, human&quot; and the suffix -logía (-λογία) &quot;study of&quot;.

==Hominoid taxonomies==
Hominoids are a primate superfamily, the hominid family is currently considered to comprise both the great ape lineages and human lineages within the hominoid superfamily. The &quot;Homininae&quot; comprise both the human lineages and the African ape lineages. The term &quot;African apes&quot; refers only to chimpanzees and gorillas. The terminology of the immediate biological family is currently in flux. The term &quot;hominin&quot; refers to any genus in the human tribe (Hominini), of which &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (modern humans) is the only living specimen.




==History==
===18th century===
In 1758 Carl Linnaeus introduced the name &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; as a species name in the 10th edition of his work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; although without a scientific description of the species-specific characteristics. Since the great apes were considered the closest relatives of human beings, based on morphological similarity, in the 19th century, it was speculated that the closest living relatives to humans were chimpanzees (genus &quot;Pan&quot;) and gorilla (genus &quot;Gorilla&quot;), and based on the natural range of these creatures, it was surmised that humans shared a common ancestor with African apes and that fossils of these ancestors would ultimately be found in Africa.

===19th century===

The science arguably began in the late 19th century when important discoveries occurred that led to the study of human evolution. The discovery of the Neanderthal in Germany, Thomas Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Evidence as to Man&#x27;s Place in Nature&quot;, and Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; were both important to early paleoanthropological research.

The modern field of paleoanthropology began in the 19th century with the discovery of &quot;Neanderthal man&quot; (the eponymous skeleton was found in 1856, but there had been finds elsewhere since 1830), and with evidence of so-called cave men. The idea that humans are similar to certain great apes had been obvious to people for some time, but the idea of the biological evolution of species in general was not legitimized until after Charles Darwin published &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in 1859.

Though Darwin&#x27;s first book on evolution did not address the specific question of human evolution—&quot;light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history,&quot; was all Darwin wrote on the subject—the implications of evolutionary theory were clear to contemporary readers.

Debates between Thomas Huxley and Richard Owen focused on the idea of human evolution. Huxley convincingly illustrated many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes in his 1863 book &quot;Evidence as to Man&#x27;s Place in Nature&quot;. By the time Darwin published his own book on the subject, &quot;Descent of Man&quot;, it was already a well-known interpretation of his theory—and the interpretation which made the theory highly controversial. Even many of Darwin&#x27;s original supporters (such as Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Lyell) balked at the idea that human beings could have evolved their apparently boundless mental capacities and moral sensibilities through natural selection.

===Asia===

Prior to the general acceptance of Africa as the root of genus &quot;Homo&quot;, 19th-century naturalists sought the origin of humans in Asia. So-called &quot;dragon bones&quot; (fossil bones and teeth) from Chinese apothecary shops were known, but it was not until the early 20th century that German paleontologist, Max Schlosser, first described a single human tooth from Beijing. Although Schlosser (1903) was very cautious, identifying the tooth only as &quot;?&quot;Anthropoide g. et sp. indet&quot;?,&quot; he was hopeful that future work would discover a new anthropoid in China.

Eleven years later, the Swedish geologist Johan Gunnar Andersson was sent to China as a mining advisor and soon developed an interest in &quot;dragon bones&quot;. It was he who, in 1918, discovered the sites around Zhoukoudian, a village about 50 kilometers southwest of Beijing. However, because of the sparse nature of the initial finds, the site was abandoned.

Work did not resume until 1921, when the Austrian paleontologist, Otto Zdansky, fresh with his doctoral degree from Vienna, came to Beijing to work for Andersson. Zdansky conducted short-term excavations at Locality 1 in 1921 and 1923, and recovered only two teeth of significance (one premolar and one molar) that he subsequently described, cautiously, as &quot;?&quot;Homo sp.&quot;&quot; (Zdansky, 1927). With that done, Zdansky returned to Austria and suspended all fieldwork.

News of the fossil hominin teeth delighted the scientific community in Beijing, and plans for developing a larger, more systematic project at Zhoukoudian were soon formulated. At the epicenter of excitement was Davidson Black, a Canadian-born anatomist working at Peking Union Medical College. Black shared Andersson’s interest, as well as his view that central Asia was a promising home for early humankind. In late 1926, Black submitted a proposal to the Rockefeller Foundation seeking financial support for systematic excavation at Zhoukoudian and the establishment of an institute for the study of human biology in China.

The Zhoukoudian Project came into existence in the spring of 1927, and two years later, the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the Geological Survey of China was formally established. Being the first institution of its kind, the Cenozoic Laboratory opened up new avenues for the study of paleogeology and paleontology in China. The Laboratory was the precursor of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) of the Chinese Academy of Science, which took its modern form after 1949.

The first of the major project finds are attributed to the young Swedish paleontologist, Anders Birger Bohlin, then serving as the field advisor at Zhoukoudian. He recovered a left lower molar that Black (1927) identified as unmistakably human (it compared favorably to the previous find made by Zdansky), and subsequently coined it &quot;Sinanthropus pekinensis&quot;. The news was at first met with skepticism, and many scholars had reservations that a single tooth was sufficient to justify the naming of a new type of early hominin. Yet within a little more than two years, in the winter of 1929, Pei Wenzhong, then the field director at Zhoukoudian, unearthed the first complete calvaria of Peking Man. Twenty-seven years after Schlosser’s initial description, the antiquity of early humans in East Asia was no longer a speculation, but a reality.

Excavations continued at the site and remained fruitful until the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. The decade-long research yielded a wealth of faunal and lithic materials, as well as hominin fossils. These included 5 more complete calvaria, 9 large cranial fragments, 6 facial fragments, 14 partial mandibles, 147 isolated teeth, and 11 postcranial elements—estimated to represent as least 40 individuals. Evidence of fire, marked by ash lenses and burned bones and stones, were apparently also present, although recent studies have challenged this view. Franz Weidenreich came to Beijing soon after Black’s untimely death in 1934, and took charge of the study of the hominin specimens.

Following the loss of the Peking Man materials in late 1941, scientific endeavors at Zhoukoudian slowed, primarily because of lack of funding. Frantic search for the missing fossils took place, and continued well into the 1950s. After the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, excavations resumed at Zhoukoudian. But with political instability and social unrest brewing in China, beginning in 1966, and major discoveries at Olduvai Gorge and East Turkana (Koobi Fora), the paleoanthropological spotlight shifted westward to East Africa. Although China re-opened its doors to the West in the late 1970s, national policy calling for self-reliance, coupled with a widened language barrier, thwarted all the possibilities of renewed scientific relationships. Indeed, Harvard anthropologist K. C. Chang noted, &quot;international collaboration (in developing nations very often a disguise for Western domination) became a thing of the past&quot; (1977: 139).

===Africa===
==== 1920s – 1940s ====
The first paleoanthropological find made in Africa was the 1921 discovery of the Kabwe 1 skull at Kabwe (Broken Hill), Zambia. Initially, this specimen was named &quot;Homo rhodesiensis&quot;; however, today it is considered part of the species &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;.

In 1924 in a limestone quarry at Taung, Professor Raymond Dart discovered a remarkably well-preserved juvenile specimen (face and brain endocast), which he named &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; (&quot;Australopithecus&quot; meaning &quot;Southern Ape&quot;). Although the brain was small (410 cm3), its shape was rounded, unlike the brain shape of chimpanzees and gorillas, and more like the shape seen in modern humans. In addition, the specimen exhibited short canine teeth, and the anterior placement of the foramen magnum was more like the placement seen in modern humans than the placement seen in chimpanzees and gorillas, suggesting that this species was bipedal.

All of these traits convinced Dart that the Taung child was a bipedal human ancestor, a transitional form between ape and human. However, Dart&#x27;s conclusions were largely ignored for decades, as the prevailing view of the time was that a large brain evolved before bipedality. It took the discovery of additional australopith fossils in Africa that resembled his specimen, and the rejection of the Piltdown Man hoax, for Dart&#x27;s claims to be taken seriously.

In the 1930s, paleontologist Robert Broom discovered and described a new species at Kromdraai, South Africa. Although similar in some ways to Dart&#x27;s &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot;, Broom&#x27;s specimen had much larger cheek teeth. Because of this difference, Broom named his specimen &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot;, using a new genus name. In doing so, he established the practice of grouping gracile australopiths in the genus &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and robust australopiths in the genus &quot;Paranthropus.&quot; During the 1960s, the robust variety was commonly moved into &quot;Australopithecus&quot;. A more recent consensus has been to return to the original classification of &quot;Paranthropus&quot; as a separate genus.

==== 1950s – 1990s ====
The second half of the twentieth century saw a significant increase in the number of paleoanthropological finds made in Africa. Many of these finds were associated with the work of the Leakey family in eastern Africa. In 1959, Mary Leakey&#x27;s discovery of the Zinj fossin (OH 5) at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, led to the identification of a new species, &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot;. In 1960, the Leakeys discovered the fossil OH 7, also at Olduvai Gorge, and assigned it to a new species, &quot;Homo habilis&quot;. In 1972, Bernard Ngeneo, a fieldworker working for Richard Leakey, discovered the fossil KNM-ER 1470 near Lake Turkana in Kenya. KNM-ER 1470 has been interpreted as either a distinct species, &quot;Homo rudolfensis&quot;, or alternatively as evidence of sexual dimorphism in &quot;Homo habilis&quot;. In 1967, Richard Leakey reported the earliest definitive examples of anatomically modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; from the site of Omo Kibish in Ethiopia, known as the Omo remains. In the late 1970s, Mary Leakey excavated the famous Laetoli footprints in Tanzania, which demonstrated the antiquity of bipedality in the human lineage. In 1985, Richard Leakey and Alan Walker discovered a specimen they called the Black Skull, found near Lake Turkana. This specimen was assigned to another species, &quot;Paranthropus aethiopicus&quot;. In 1994, a team led by Meave Leakey announced a new species, &quot;Australopithecus anamensis&quot;, based on specimens found near Lake Turkana.

Numerous other researchers have made important discoveries in eastern Africa. Possibly the most famous is the Lucy skeleton, discovered in 1973 by Donald Johanson and Maurice Taieb in Ethiopia&#x27;s Afar Triangle at the site of Hadar. On the basis of this skeleton and subsequent discoveries, the researchers came up with a new species, &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot;. In 1975, Colin Groves and Vratislav Mazák announced a new species of human they called &quot;Homo ergaster&quot;. &quot;Homo ergaster&quot; specimens have been found at numerous sites in eastern and southern Africa. In 1994, Tim D. White announced a new species, &quot;Ardipithecus ramidus&quot;, based on fossils from Ethiopia.

In 1999, two new species were announced. Berhane Asfaw and Tim D. White named &quot;Australopithecus garhi&quot; based on specimens discovered in Ethiopia&#x27;s Awash valley. Meave Leakey announced a new species, &quot;Kenyanthropus platyops&quot;, based on the cranium KNM-WT 40000 from Lake Turkana.

==== 21st century ====
In the 21st century, numerous fossils have been found that add to current knowledge of existing species. For example, in 2001, Zeresenay Alemseged discovered an &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; child fossil, called Selam, from the site of Dikika in the Afar region of Ethiopia. This find is particularly important because the fossil included a preserved hyoid bone, something rarely found in other paleoanthropological fossils but important for understanding the evolution of speech capacities.

Two new species from southern Africa have been discovered and described in recent years. In 2008, a team led by Lee Berger announced a new species, &quot;Australopithecus sediba&quot;, based on fossils they had discovered in Malapa cave in South Africa. In 2015, a team also led by Lee Berger announced another species, &quot;Homo naledi&quot;, based on fossils representing 15 individuals from the Rising Star Cave system in South Africa.

New species have also been found in eastern Africa. In 2000, Brigitte Senut and Martin Pickford described the species &quot;Orrorin tugenensis&quot;, based on fossils they found in Kenya. In 2004, Yohannes Haile-Selassie announced that some specimens previously labeled as &quot;Ardipithecus ramidus&quot; made up a different species, &quot;Ardipithecus kadabba&quot;. In 2015, Haile-Selassie announced another new species, &quot;Australopithecus deyiremeda&quot;, though some scholars are skeptical that the associated fossils truly represent a unique species.

Although most hominin fossils from Africa have been found in eastern and southern Africa, there are a few exceptions. One is &quot;Sahelanthropus tchadensis&quot;, discovered in the central African country of Chad in 2002. This find is important because it widens the assumed geographic range of early hominins.

<text>The Hiawatha (also called the Hiawatha Service), is an train route operated by Amtrak between Chicago, Illinois, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Twelve to fourteen trains (six round-trips, five on Sunday) run daily between Chicago and Milwaukee, making intermediate stops in Glenview, Illinois; Sturtevant, Wisconsin; and Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. The line is partially supported by funding from the state governments of Wisconsin and Illinois. The line utilizes the CPKC Railway&#x27;s C&amp;M Subdivision and Metra&#x27;s Milwaukee District North Line.

The service carried 636,854 passengers in fiscal year 2023, a 26.9% increase over FY2022. It is Amtrak&#x27;s sixth-busiest route, and the railroad&#x27;s busiest line in the Midwest. Revenue during FY2011 totaled $14,953,873, a 6.1% increase over FY2010. Ridership per mile is also very high, exceeded only by the &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; and the &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot;. A one-way trip between Milwaukee and Chicago takes about 90 minutes. In the 1930s, the same trip took 75 minutes on the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Hiawatha&quot;. In 2014, free Wi-Fi service was added to the &quot;Hiawatha&quot;. The service is especially popular with fans attending games involving baseball&#x27;s Brewers–Cubs rivalry using mass transit, with trains before and after games at either American Family Field or Wrigley Field often filled to capacity.

The route is augmented by Amtrak Thruway routes connecting Green Bay, Appleton, Oshkosh, and Fond du Lac with Milwaukee and Madison, Janesville, and Rockford with Chicago.

On April 24, 2020, the &quot;Hiawatha&quot; was temporarily replaced by bus service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Partial service resumed in June 2020, and full service in May 2021.

== History ==

=== Milwaukee Road ===

Historically, the &quot;Hiawathas&quot; were operated by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (also known as the &quot;Milwaukee Road&quot;), and initially traveled from Chicago to the Twin Cities. The first &quot;Hiawatha&quot; trains ran in 1935. By 1948, five routes carried the &quot;Hiawatha&quot; name: Chicago–Minneapolis; Chicago–Omaha; Chicago–Wausau–Minocqua; Chicago–Ontanogan; and Chicago-Minneapolis-Seattle.

The &quot;Hiawathas&quot; were among the world&#x27;s fastest trains in the 1930s and 1940s, and these trains reached some of their peak speeds on this stretch, directly competing with trains from the Chicago and North Western Railway which ran on roughly parallel tracks. A 90-minute non-stop service between Chicago and Milwaukee was first introduced in the mid-1930s, and this later fell to 75 minutes for several years. A self-imposed speed limit was routinely exceeded by locomotive engineers, until the Interstate Commerce Commission rules imposed a stricter limit of in the early 1950s. The train slowed to a schedule of 80 minutes, although an added stop in Glenview also contributed to a longer travel time. Ultimately, the speed limit fell to in 1968 because of signaling changes, and the scheduled duration went back to 90 minutes end-to-end.

Under Amtrak, which assumed control of most intercity passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, the &quot;Hiawatha&quot; name survived in two forms. The first was a Chicago–Milwaukee–Minneapolis service, known simply as the &quot;Hiawatha&quot;. This would be renamed the &quot;Twin Cities Hiawatha&quot;, then extended to Seattle and renamed the &quot;North Coast Hiawatha&quot;. This service ended in 1979.

The second was a Chicago–Milwaukee corridor train known as the &quot;Hiawatha Service&quot; (as opposed to &quot;Hiawatha&quot;). Although Amtrak had retained Chicago–Milwaukee service during the transition, it did not name these trains until October 29, 1972. At this time both &quot;Hiawatha&quot; and &quot;Hiawatha Service&quot; could be found on the same timetable. On June 15, 1976, Amtrak introduced Turboliners to the route and the name &quot;Hiawatha Service&quot; left the timetable, not to return until 1989. The Chicago–Milwaukee trains were known simply as &quot;Turboliners&quot; (as were comparable trains on the Chicago–Detroit and Chicago – St. Louis corridors) until October 26, 1980, when Amtrak introduced individual names for each of the trains: The &quot;Badger,&quot; the &quot;LaSalle,&quot; the &quot;Nicollet,&quot; and the &quot;Radisson.&quot; This practice ended on October 29, 1989, when the name &quot;Hiawatha Service&quot; returned as an umbrella term for all Chicago–Milwaukee service.

A resurfacing project on Interstate 94 led to a three-month trial of service west of Milwaukee to Watertown, Wisconsin beginning on April 13, 1998. Intermediate stops included Wauwatosa, Elm Grove, Pewaukee, and Oconomowoc. Amtrak extended four of the six daily &quot;Hiawathas&quot; over the route. The Canadian Pacific Railway, which owned the tracks through its American subsidiary Soo Line Railroad, estimated that the route would require between $15–33 million in capital investment before it could host the extended service permanently. Money was not forthcoming and service ended July 11. The three-month trial cost $1.4 million and carried 32,000 passengers.

Between 2000 and 2001, Amtrak considered extending one &quot;Hiawatha&quot; round-trip north from Milwaukee to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Potential stops included Elm Grove, Brookfield, Slinger, and Lomira. Travel time would be nearly two hours. Amtrak hoped to attract mail and express business along the route as part of its Network Growth Strategy, similar to the short-lived &quot;Lake Country Limited&quot;. Amtrak abandoned the idea in September 2001.

In 2005, another station opened on the line, the Milwaukee Airport Railroad Station at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. The expansion was intended to facilitate travel to and from the airport, with shuttles running between the station and the main terminal. The new station also gave residents on the south side of Milwaukee easier access to the service, along with an alternative to the central station in downtown, which is now fully accessible after completion of the Marquette Interchange. The station was primarily funded and is maintained by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.

It is proposed that the &quot;Hiawatha&quot;, along with the &quot;Empire Builder,&quot; would shift one stop north to North Glenview in Glenview, Illinois. This move would eliminate lengthy stops which block traffic on Glenview Road. This move would involve reconstruction of the North Glenview station to handle the additional traffic, and depends on commitments from Glenview, the Illinois General Assembly, and Metra.

The route is coextensive with the far southern leg of the &quot;Empire Builder,&quot; Amtrak&#x27;s long-distance service from Chicago to the Pacific Northwest. The &quot;Empire Builder&quot; stops at Glenview and Milwaukee, but normally does so in both cases only to receive passengers northbound and discharge passengers southbound.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
The &quot;Hiawatha&quot; was reduced to four daily round trips on March 19, 2020, and a single round trip two days later, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The &quot;Empire Builder&quot; added stops at Sturtevant and Milwaukee Airport on the 21st, and temporarily allowed local travel between Chicago and Milwaukee. That single round trip was suspended on April 24, 2020, and replaced with an Amtrak Thruway bus (an extension of the existing Green Bay–Milwaukee bus route) making the same stops.

The &quot;Hiawatha&quot; returned on June 1, 2020, with a single round trip: a morning departure to Chicago and an evening return to Milwaukee. Three additional daily round trips and two additional weekend round trips returned on June 29. The &quot;Hiawatha&quot; had long run with a mix of reserved and unreserved seating, but Amtrak temporarily required reservations for passengers without multi-ride tickets in order to maintain social distancing. Amtrak also required facial coverings and stopped accepting cash. The &quot;Empire Builder&quot; ceased making the additional stops on June 29. On May 23, 2021, &quot;Hiawatha Service&quot; and the Milwaukee–Green Bay Thruway route returned to their full pre-pandemic schedules.

In November 2023, Amtrak ceased offering monthly passes for the &quot;Hiawatha&quot;, instead selling 10-ride passes. The change significantly increased the cost for daily commuters. In December 2023, Amtrak reinstated the monthly pass for riders at a higher cost than previous.

In October 2024, the state was awarded a $72.8 million federal grant to build a freight bypass track through Muskego Yard in Milwaukee, which will reduce freight movements though the Milwaukee station. CPKC had agreed to allow an eighth &quot;Hiawatha&quot; round trip once the bypass was funded.

==== Corridor names ====
This table shows the names given to trains which operated over the Chicago-Milwaukee corridor under Amtrak. It excludes long-distance trains such as the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; and &quot;North Coast Hiawatha&quot; whose local stopping patterns were restricted. The &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; and &quot;Prairie State&quot; were Chicago-St. Louis services which Amtrak extended through Chicago to the north in the early 1970s.
==Ridership==


Due primarily to the route&#x27;s popularity, its northern terminus, Milwaukee Intermodal Station, is Amtrak&#x27;s 18th-busiest station nationwide and second-busiest in the Midwest.

Note
== Equipment ==
Three trainsets are required to operate the service. The usual &quot;Hiawatha&quot; train sets are formed of one Siemens SC-44 locomotive on the southward end, an EMD F40PH derived &quot;control car&quot; on the northward end, and six Horizon Fleet 68-seat coaches. One car at the rear end in the direction of travel is designated a &quot;quiet&quot; car with limitations placed on cell phone usage and loud conversations. During winter months, an Amfleet coach is normally used on each end in lieu of a Horizon coach to serve as quiet cars.

On July 17, 2009, the State of Wisconsin announced it would purchase two new train sets from Spanish manufacturer Talgo in preparation for the enhanced-speed service that received funding in early 2010. However, Governor Scott Walker rejected the federal funding and cancelled the project. Talgo opened a manufacturing plant in Milwaukee to construct the trainsets for the &quot;Hiawatha&quot;, and the company hoped the plant would also build trains for future high-speed lines in the region. The two sets built were stored in the former Talgo plant until May 2014, when Amtrak moved them to its maintenance facility near Indianapolis, Indiana. They will remain stored there pending their possible use on other Amtrak routes. The unpowered tilting trainsets are 14 cars long including a cab car, eleven coaches (five of which have restrooms), one bistro car, and one end car including a bicycle rack. The cars wear a red-and-white livery in homage to the University of Wisconsin. The trains would have initially been pulled by the same GE Genesis locomotives used at the time, which have a top speed of . In 2022, the two trainsets were sold to Nigeria for use on the Lagos Rail Mass Transit.

In August 2019, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) awarded WisDOT up to $25.2 million to purchase six new coaches and three new cab cars for the route, allowing the replacement of the NPCUs. The new equipment was expected to enter service in 2022, but , reliability issues with the NPCUs combined with the new equipment not yet having been assigned to the route resulted in the suspension of checked baggage and trainside bicycle service.

== Proposed extensions ==
In 2021, Amtrak proposed adding three new &quot;Hiawatha&quot; round trips by 2035. This would bring the total frequency between Chicago and Milwaukee to ten daily round trips. All trips would extend beyond Milwaukee, with four daily trains to Madison, three to Saint Paul, and three to Green Bay. In December 2023, the FRA accepted the &quot;Hiawatha&quot; route into its Corridor Identification and Development Program. The move grants $500,000 toward studying additional frequency and prioritizes the corridor for future federal funding under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed in November 2021.

=== Madison ===
In 2009, Wisconsin applied for funding from an $8 billion pool allocated for rail projects under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and the Chicago–Milwaukee–Madison–Minneapolis/St. Paul corridor was allocated $823 million. $810 million of that was to support extending Amtrak services to Madison, which had not seen direct intercity service since 1971. Another $12 million would have been used to upgrade the line between Chicago and Milwaukee, and an additional $600,000 was granted to study future alignments to the Twin Cities.

The Madison extension was initially planned to include stops in Brookfield, Oconomowoc, and Watertown, but Oconomowoc and Brookfield were reluctant to move forward with station planning due to cost concerns. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) dropped Oconomowoc from the planned route in August 2010, and Brookfield was waiting to see the outcome of elections in November before making a decision on whether to build a station. The nearby cities of Hartland and Wauwatosa had expressed interest in hosting stations. The extension was expected to begin service by 2013.

The project became a political issue in the 2010 Wisconsin gubernatorial election. Republican candidate Scott Walker promised he would stop the project and return the money the state received if elected.

At the end of October 2010, Wisconsin governor Jim Doyle and the federal government signed an agreement that bound the state to spend the federal funds granted to construct the route, regardless of the results of the 2010 gubernatorial election. On November 4, two days after Scott Walker won the gubernatorial election, however, Doyle ordered work on the line to be temporarily halted, and on November 9 said that he planned to leave the choice of whether or not to operate the train to Walker. On December 9, 2010, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced that much of the $810 million that Wisconsin was supposed to get would be redistributed to other states, including California, Florida, and Washington.

The Madison extension was included in the 2022 Amtrak Connects Us initiative, with the goal of establishing service by 2035. An extension to Madison has been cited by the US Department of Transportation as “critical to operational viability of the Core Express corridor between Chicago and Minneapolis-St. Paul” and that it should be “included on any mainline route alignment.” As such the City of Madison has renewed work on establishing a location for a passenger rail terminal.

=== Twin Cities ===

There had long been proposals to extend one or more &quot;Hiawatha&quot; trips from Milwaukee to Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota, which would double service frequency on the Twin Cities-Milwaukee-Chicago (TCMC) corridor.

A 2015 feasibility report by Amtrak looked at extending one round trip as a &quot;second train&quot; along the route of the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; through La Crosse. Annual ridership was forecast between 117,800 and 155,500 if the service ended at Saint Paul Union Depot, and higher if it extended to Target Field, Fridley, or St. Cloud.

The total cost to extend one round trip to Saint Paul was placed at $53 million. In May 2020, a $12.6 million federal grant was awarded to offset the first three years of operations. A $31.8 million grant followed in September 2020 for final design work and construction. Amtrak provided $5 million in matching funds, Wisconsin $6.2 million, and Minnesota promised $10 million.

In its 2020-2035 expansion vision, Amtrak proposed extending three &quot;Hiawatha&quot; trips from Milwaukee to the Twin Cities. One would complement the &quot;Empire Builder&quot;, while two would take a new route with stops in Camp Douglas, Eau Claire, Menomonie, and Hudson. The Milwaukee–Saint Paul trip time is estimated at 6 hours 45 minutes.

On May 21, 2024, Amtrak&#x27;s new &quot;Borealis&quot; train offering one round-trip per day between Chicago and Minneapolis–Saint Paul was inaugurated. It complements the long-distance Empire Builder in providing additional frequency on the corridor.

=== Green Bay ===

Amtrak has proposed extending three &quot;Hiawatha&quot; trips from Milwaukee to Green Bay by 2035, with stops in Fond du Lac, Oshkosh, and Appleton. The Milwaukee–Green Bay trip time is estimated at 2 hours 50 minutes.
