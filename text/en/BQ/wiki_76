<text>Belleville () is a station on Paris Métro Line 2 and Line 11. The station is in the district of Belleville at the corner of the 10th, 11th, 19th and 20th arrondissements.

==Location==
The station is located at the crossroads formed by Rue de Belleville, Boulevard de la Villette, Rue du Faubourg-du-Temple and Boulevard de Belleville, with the platforms positioned:

* on line 2, approximately a north-west / south-east axis under the start of Boulevard de la Villette, between the Couronnes and Colonel Fabien metro stations;
* on line 11, approximately a northeast / southwest axis under the end of Rue du Faubourg-du-Temple, between Goncourt and Pyrénées metro stations.

==History==
The station was opened on 31 January 1903 as part of the extension of line 2 from Anvers to &quot;Bagnolet&quot; (now called Alexandre Dumas). The line 11 platforms opened as part of the original section of the line from Châtelet to Porte des Lilas on 28 April 1935. The station is named after the commune of &quot;Belleville&quot; that was annexed by Paris in 1860. It was the location of the &quot;Barrière de Belleville&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished during the 19th century.

Like a third of the stations in the network, between 1974 and 1984, the platforms were modernised in &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style, in orange for line 2 and green for line 11.

As part of RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, its corridors were renovated on 29 July 2005.

In 2015, local elected officials proposed to change the station&#x27;s name to &quot;Belleville–Commune de Paris 1871&quot;, commemorating the area as the last redoubt of the Paris Commune.

Since 2020, as part of the extension of line 11 to &quot;Rosny-sous-Bois&quot;, three new entrances have been put into service: no. 7 and no. 9 on 17 September and no. 8 at the end of that year.

In 2020, with the COVID-19 crisis, 5,680,933 passengers entered this station, which placed it in twelfth position among metro stations for its use.

<text>Ménilmontant () is a station on Line 2 of the Paris Métro, on the border of the 11th and 20th arrondissements.

==Location==
The station is established at the start of Boulevard de Ménilmontant at its junction with Boulevard de Belleville, at the intersection with Rue de Ménilmontant and Rue Oberkampf. Oriented approximately along a north-west / south-east axis, it is located between the Couronnes and Père Lachaise stations.

==History==

The station was opened on 31 January 1903 as part of the extension of line 2 (known at the time as &quot;2 Nord&quot;) from Anvers to &quot;Bagnolet&quot; (now called Alexandre Dumas). It is named after the &quot;Boulevard de Ménilmontant&quot;, which was named after a hamlet, annexed by Belleville before the French Revolution and in turn by Paris in 1860. It was the location of the &quot;Barrière de Ménilmontant&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished during the 19th century.

On 10 August 1903, the station was one of the locations of the most serious accident on the Paris metro. A fire in a wooden train, empty of passengers, killed seven people in the station, but the spread of toxic fumes and heat to the neighboring station at Couronnes would claim the lives of 77 others.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Metro Renewal&quot; program, the entire station was renovated around the year 2000.

On 9 October 2019, half of the nameplates on the station&#x27;s platforms are temporarily replaced by the RATP in order to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Astérix and Obélix, as in eleven other stations. Taking up in particular the typography characteristic of the comics of René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo, Ménilmontant is humorously renamed &quot;Menhirmontant&quot; in reference to the animated film &quot;Asterix and the Big Fight&quot; (&quot;Astérix et le coup du menhir&quot;) .

<text>Philippe Auguste () is a station on Line 2 of the Paris Métro, on the border of the 11th and 20th arrondissements.

==Location==
The station is located at the end of Boulevard de Charonne at its junction with Boulevard de Ménilmontant, at the end of Avenue Philippe-Auguste. Oriented along a north-west/south-east axis, it is located between Père Lachaise and Alexandre Dumas stations.

==History==
The station was opened on 31 January 1903 as part of the extension of line 2 (known at the time as &quot;2 Nord&quot;) from Anvers to &quot;Bagnolet&quot; (now called Alexandre Dumas). The station is named after the &quot;Avenue Philippe Auguste&quot;, after King Philip II of France, making it the only station in Paris named for French royalty. It was the location of the &quot;Barrière des Rats&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in 1840.

As part of the RATP &quot;Metro Renewal&quot; program, the station corridors and platform lighting were renovated on 27 June 2003.

In 2018, the platforms were in turn completely modernized as part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; operation.

In 2019, 1,763,562 travelers entered this station which placed it at the 262nd position of the metro stations for its traffic out of 302.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances made up of fixed stairs, opening at the corner of Avenue Philippe-Auguste and Boulevard de Charonne:
* Entrance 1: Boulevard de Charonne: main entrance on the central reservation of Boulevard de Charonne, opposite no. 149; this entrance is adorned with an archway produced by architect Hector Guimard, prime contractor for the company. It was listed as a historic monument by the decree of 29 May 29, 1978.
* Entrance 2: Rue du Mont-Louis: a staircase decorated with a Dervaux candelabra, located at the corner of Avenue Philippe-Auguste and Rue de Mont-Louis;

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Philippe Auguste is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the style used for most metro stations, the lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the metro revival of the 2000s, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls and tunnel exits. The layout was completely refurbished in 2018; thus, white ceramic advertising frames have replaced the metal surrounds, while the green &quot;Motte&quot; style seats have been replaced with blue &quot;Akiko&quot; seats.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by line 71 of the RATP Bus Network.

==Nearby==
The famous Père Lachaise Cemetery is nearby as is the Square de la Roquette.

<doc id="503882" wikidata="Q1282901" url="?curid=503882" title="Eddie Meduza">
<text>Errol Leonard Norstedt (17 June 1948–17 January 2002), better known by his stage name Eddie Meduza, previously known as E. Hitler, was a Swedish composer and musician working mainly in the rockabilly genre.

==Music career==
===Themes and behaviour===
Many of Meduza&#x27;s songs are about alcohol, women, and cars, often with obscene lyrics. Some songs are politically oriented, with many aimed against the various Swedish governments in power during his musical career.

One of Meduza&#x27;s personas was the vulgar E. Hitler. In this guise he generally recorded more offbeat recordings like &quot;E.Hitler skiter&quot; (a recording of his own bowel movements) and sexually explicit material. The E. Hitler recordings were only available on tape by mail order directly from Meduza. On tour, he urged his audience to drink vodka to become as drunk as he was during his performances, to the tune of his &quot;Mera brännvin&quot; (&quot;More booze&quot;).

Meduza also recorded serious rockabilly songs with a distinct 1950s flavour in his own studio, called Studio Ronka (from &quot;&quot;, Swedish for male masturbation similar to English &quot;wank&quot;). He played most of the instruments himself. He often got bad reviews from the press, notably from &quot;Expressen&quot; journalist Mats Olsson, to which Meduza replied by writing songs such as &quot;Kuken står på Mats Olsson&quot; (&quot;Mats Olsson has a hard-on&quot;), &quot;Mats Olsson är en jävla bög&quot; (&quot;Mats Olsson is a damn fag&quot;) and &quot;Mats Olsson runkar kuken&quot; (&quot;Mats Olsson wanks his cock&quot;). He reportedly said that no matter what he did it was never good enough for the critics.

Meduza is also remembered for the first recorded appearance of future hair metal guitarist John Norum (Dokken, UFO, Europe), who played on two of his albums.

===Albums===
Errol Norstedts&#x27; first album was &quot;Errol&quot;, released in 1975 under his real name. This album consists mostly of dansband music, but also includes a humorous song called &quot;Snus-kig Blues&quot; about snus. He began calling himself Eddie Meduza in 1978 with the release of the single &quot;Punkjävlar&quot; (&quot;Punk bastards&quot;). His first album as Eddie Meduza was released in 1979, called &quot;Eddie Meduza &amp; Roarin&#x27; Cadillacs&quot;, mostly consisting of rock and roll and ballads in English.
In 1980, Meduza released his next album, &quot;Garagetaper&quot;, with a front cover parodying the cover of Frank Zappa&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot;. Meduza&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1981 with the album &quot;Gasen I Botten&quot;, which includes some of his more well-known songs such as &quot;Mera Brännvin&quot; and &quot;Volvo&quot;.

==Alcoholism and death==
According to Meduza, he developed alcoholism in the early 1980s during periods of intense touring. In 1981, he was convicted of drink-driving and spent one month in prison. Nevertheless, he continued drinking heavily, and a year after his release, he suffered a nervous breakdown. In 1993 he collapsed on his way to perform at a concert and was diagnosed with ventricular hypertrophy (enlarged heart). He was warned by doctors that he would die if he drank again, and initially made major changes to his lifestyle, stopped drinking and started working out. However, in the late 1990s, suffering a worsening depression, he started drinking heavily again, and this caused his health to deteriorate further. On 17 January 2002, Meduza died of a heart attack at his home in Småland in southern Sweden, aged 53. He was cremated and his ashes scattered, in the summer of 2003, outside Rossö in Kosterfjorden, Bohuslän. He is survived by his wife and children.

==Popularity in Mexico==
Meduza&#x27;s song &quot;Reaktorn läck i Barsebäck&quot; (&quot;The reactor leaking in Barsebäck&quot;) from the 1980 album &quot;Garagetaper&quot; has become a popular party song in Mexico, under the title &quot;Himno a la banda&quot;.

==Criticism==
Eddie Meduza has been criticized for making songs with themes that were inappropriate (e.g. his song &quot;Jag bara runkar&quot; [English &quot;I am just jerking off&quot;]) which led to him getting banned from big newspapers like Aftonbladet.

<text>Alexandre Dumas () is a station on Line 2 of the Paris Métro, on the border of the 11th and 20th arrondissements.

==Location==
The station is located under Boulevard de Charonne at its intersection with Rue de Charonne and Rue de Bagnolet. Oriented approximately along a north-west / south-east axis, it is located between the Philippe Auguste and Avron metro stations.

==History==
The station was opened on 31 January 1903 as part of the extension of line 2 (known at the time as &quot;2 Nord&quot;) from Anvers. It was the eastern terminus of the line until 2 April 1903 when it was extended to Nation. The station was originally called &quot;Bagnolet&quot; after the &quot;Rue de Bagnolet&quot;, the road to Bagnolet. On 13 September 1970, it was renamed after the French author Alexandre Dumas and the &quot;Rue Alexandre Dumas&quot;. It was the location of the &quot;Barrière de Fontarabie&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished during the nineteenth century.

As part of the RATP &quot;Metro Renewal&quot; program, the station corridors and platform lighting were renovated on 12 May 2005.

On 1 April 2016, some of the station&#x27;s name plates were temporarily replaced by the RATP to produce April Fools jokes for a day, as in the case of twelve other stations. Alexandre Dumas was humorously renamed &quot;Les Trois Mousquetaires&quot; (The Three Musketeers) in reference to the famous novel by this writer.

As part of the action plan in 2018 to improve air quality in the metro, the station was the first in which two air purifiers were tested using an &quot;Ip&#x27;Air&quot; device developed by Suez. They were inaugurated on 7 June 2019 on the platform in the direction of Nation and set up for a period of six months.

In 2019, 3,439,879 travelers entered this station which placed it at the 142nd position of the metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has a single exit entitled &quot;Boulevard de Charonne&quot;, leading to the central reservation of the boulevard to the right of No. 111. Consisting of a fixed staircase, it is decorated with a Guimard entrance, which is subject to a registration as historic monuments by decree of 12 February 2016.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Alexandre Dumas is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is the style used for most metro stations, the lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the metro revival of the 2000s, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault, the tunnel exits, and the outlets of the corridors. The advertising frames are metallic, and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enameled plates. The seats are dark blue &quot;Motte&quot; style (replacing yellow seats of the same original model).

===Bus connections===
The station is served by line 76 of the RATP Bus Network.

<text>Avron () is a station on Line 2 of the Paris Métro, on the border of the 11th and 20th arrondissements.

==Location==
The station is located under Boulevard de Charonne, at the intersection with Rue d&#x27;Avron and Rue de Montreuil. Oriented approximately along a north–south axis, it is located between the Alexandre Dumas metro station and the eastern terminus of Nation.

==History==
 The station was opened on 2 April 1903 when the line was extended from &quot;Bagnolet&quot; (now called Alexandre Dumas) to Nation. It is named after the &quot;Rue d&#x27;Avron&quot;, which is named after a small nearby plateau that served an important role in the defence of Paris during the Siege of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War.

It was the location of the &quot;Barrière de Montreuil&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in the nineteenth century.

As part of the RATP &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; renovation program, the entire station was renovated by 9 December 2005.

On 16 July 2018, part of the nameplates of the station were temporarily replaced to celebrate the victory of the French football team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, as in five other stations. Avron is humorously renamed &quot;Nous Avron gagné&quot; as a play on words.

In 2019, 1,871,024 travelers entered this station which places it in 256th position for metro stations for its attendance out of 302.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has a single entrance called &quot;Boulevard de Charonne&quot;, leading to the central median of this boulevard, opposite no. 35. Made up of a fixed staircase, it is adorned with a Guimard entrance, which is subject to a decree as a historical monument on 29 May 1978.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Avron is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the style used for the majority of the metro stations. The bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault, the tunnel exits and the outlets of the corridors, while the lighting is provided by two white lighting tubes. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The &quot;Motte&quot; style seats are dark blue.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by line 57 of the RATP Bus Network.

<text>Dennis G. Fentie (November 8, 1950 – August 30, 2019) was a Canadian politician. He was the seventh premier of Yukon and leader of the Yukon Party, serving from 2002 to 2011, as well as the MLA for Watson Lake.

Before entering politics, Fentie was involved in logging, tourism, mining, trucking, and fuel distribution in and around Watson Lake. Fentie had served as director of both the Association of Yukon Forests and the Watson Lake Chamber of Commerce.

Fentie was elected twice (in 1996 and 2000) as a NDP MLA after which he joined the Yukon party, later getting elected as its leader. In the 2002 election, Fentie led the Yukon Party to a majority government. The party won 12 of 18 seats available in the Yukon Legislative Assembly. Fentie was re-elected for a fourth time in the riding of Watson Lake and the Yukon Party was voted to a second straight majority government. The Yukon Party won 12 of 18 seats in the legislative assembly. On April 27, 2011, Fentie announced he would be resigning and would not be running for re-election.

In 2003, Fentie along with two other territorial premiers opposed the Health Accord proposed by Ottawa. He maintained that the deal did not take into consideration the ground realities and cost of delivering services in the northern regions. Eventually a new funding deal was brought up as a result of which the three territories received greater funding from Ottawa. Among Fentie&#x27;s major accomplishments were the establishment of the hospitals at Watson Lake and Dawson City, updates of Robert Campbell Highway and increase in the industry in Watson Lake. Fentie along with the officials and MLAs conducted the annual community tours, to visit every community and conducted public meetings with the residents to let their problems be known to the bureaucrats.

==Biography==
Fentie was born in Edmonton, Alberta on November 8, 1950. In 1962, Fentie moved to Watson Lake. Prior to entering politics, Fentie was involved in a variety of economic activities in and around Watson Lake. These activities include logging, tourism, mining, trucking, and fuel distribution. Fentie served as director of both the Association of Yukon Forests and the Watson Lake Chamber of Commerce, and the owner and manager of Francis River Construction. He died of cancer at the age of 68 on August 30, 2019.

==Political career==

===NDP===
Fentie was first elected MLA for Watson Lake in the 1996 election as a member of Yukon New Democratic Party, succeeding retiring incumbent John Devries. He was re-elected in the 2000 election as an NDP MLA.

===Yukon Party===
In May 2002, Fentie left the NDP, crossing the floor to sit with the Yukon Party. One month later, Fentie was selected as the next Yukon Party leader. In the 2002 election, Fentie led the Yukon Party to a majority government, defeating incumbent Premier Pat Duncan and the Liberals. The party won 12 of 18 seats available in the Yukon Legislative Assembly.

After the 2002 election, it was revealed he had been convicted and spent time in prison for heroin trafficking in 1974 when he was 24 years old. During the 2002 election campaign, he made it public that he had spent time in jail for a narcotics charge but did not make the fact it was heroin public since he had received a pardon. He had received a full pardon for the offence in 1996.

Fentie&#x27;s majority government was reduced to minority government status in August 2006, when three Yukon Party MLAs resigned or chose to sit as independents. Copperbelt MLA Haakon Arntzen resigned after facing sexual assault charges and Klondike MLA Peter Jenkins was ousted after refusing to repay a government loan.

With a minority government, Fentie called the 2006 election for October 10. Fentie was re-elected for a fourth time in the riding of Watson Lake and the Yukon Party was voted to a second straight majority government. The Yukon Party under Fentie&#x27;s leadership won 12 of 18 seats in the legislative assembly.

In early 2011, he was featured in an episode of CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Make the Politician Work&quot;.

On April 27, 2011, Fentie announced he would be resigning and would not be running for re-election.

===Social Initiatives===
According to senator Pat Duncan who was defeated by Fentie&#x27;s Yukon Party in 2002, &quot;He was a tireless champion of Watson Lake and Southeast Yukon, especially the forestry and mining industry in the Legislature in Piers McDonald&#x27;s government. His strong advocacy for the Yukon continued in Opposition with the Yukon Party and as premier.&quot;

Yukon MP Larry Bagnell stated that Fentie took stands on certain issues independent of the party politics. Serving as the Yukon Party premier, Fentie pursued several leftist socially progressive initiatives, while as an NDP member he had pursued rightist initiatives.

In 2003, Fentie along with two other territorial premiers refused to agree to the Health Accord proposed by Ottawa meant for the rest of Canada. The three opposing premiers maintained that the deal did not take into consideration the ground realities and cost of delivery in the northern regions. Fentie had stated that, &quot;An ambulance ride in Ottawa is a plane ride in the territories.&quot; Eventually a new funding deal was brought up and agreed upon as a result of which the three territories received greater funding from Ottawa.

According to the Yukon Party Leader Stacey Hassard, &quot;He was a down-to-earth, truck-driving type guy.&quot; Fentie worked to ensure that problems faced by Yukoners are known to the bureaucrats. Fentie insisted that the officials were available for annual tours where Fentie and MLAs would visit every community. Public meetings with the residents were also organised.

Hassard stated that the hospitals at Watson Lake and Dawson City were credited to efforts by Fentie. While noting down few of Fentie&#x27;s accomplishments, Watson Lake Mayor Cheryl O’Brien credited Fentie, with the establishment of the hospital, updates to Robert Campbell Highway and increase in the industry in Watson Lake.

<text>Anatole France () is a station on Paris Métro Line 3. It is located in the commune of Levallois-Perret, northwest of the capital.

==Location==
The station is located under Rue Anatole-France in Levallois-Perret at the intersection with Rue Voltaire.

==History==
It was opened on 24 September 1937 when the line was extended from Porte de Champerret to Pont de Levallois–Bécon.

The station is on the Rue Anatole France, which is named after the author Anatole France, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1921.

In 2018, 3,734,650 passengers entered this station, which placed it at 140th position of the metro stations for its usage.

Since June 2017, the station has benefited from a renovation aimed at alleviating leakage problems and was completed by 31 December 2018.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances and an escalator, located on Place du Général-Leclerc.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Anatole France is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms, 105 meters long, separated by the metro tracks, and the vault is elliptical. The platforms are partially offset (like Saint-Germain-des-Prés) due to the narrow width of the street under which they are located. The Commerce and Liège stations have platforms that are completely offset for the same reason. The decoration is of the style used for most metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the &quot;renouveau du métro&quot; of the 2000s, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault, and the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are faience in a honey colour and the name of the station is also of faience. It is equipped with benches.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 174 and 274 of the RATP Bus Network and at night, by lines N16 and N52 of the Noctilien network.

<text>Louise Michel () is a station on Paris Métro Line 3. It is located in the commune of Levallois-Perret, just outside Paris to the northwest.

==Location==
The station is located about 100 meters from the administrative limit of Paris, under Rue Anatole-France, at the intersection with Rue Louise-Michel. Oriented along a north-west/south-east axis, it is located between the Anatole France and Porte de Champerret stations.

==History==
 The station was opened on 24 September 1937 when the line was extended from Porte de Champerret to Pont de Levallois–Bécon. It was originally called &quot;Vallier&quot;, after a local street.

It was renamed on 1 May 1946 to &quot;Louise Michel&quot; in honour of the French anarchist and communarde, who is buried in the local cemetery.

The station is the fifth in a series of six in the network to have been given a name of a woman, after Barbès-Rochechouart (lines 2 and 4), Madeleine (lines 8, 12 and 14), Chardon-Lagache (line 10) and Boucicaut (line 8); followed by the Pierre-et-Marie Curie station (line 7), and pending the future stations Barbara (line 4) and Bagneux-Lucie Aubrac (lines 4 and 15).

Like a third of the stations in the network, between 1974 and 1984, the platforms were modernized in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style, in this case red in color with flat white tiles. As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; project, the corridors were renovated on 27 July 2002.

In 2018, 3,807,962 passengers entered this station, which places it at the 138th position of the metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances:
* entrance 1 - &quot;Rue Louise-Michel&quot; found at ground level at no. 30 (rare case in the metro network), on the corner with rue Anatole-France;
* entrance 2 - &quot;Rue Anatole-France&quot;, consisting of an escalator allowing an exit only to the even numbers side of the street.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Louise Michel is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two red light canopies, benches covered with flat red tiles and red &quot;Motte&quot; seats. These arrangements are combined with the flat white ceramic tiles that cover the walls, the vault and the tunnel exits. The corridor outlets are treated with classic bevelled white tiles. The advertising frames are metallic, and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The station is distinguished by its platforms widths which are less than the standard configuration due to the narrowness of the street under which it was established, as well as by the lower part of its walls which, consequently, are vertical and not elliptical.

===Bus connections===
The station is served at night by lines N16 and N52 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Porte de Champerret () is a station on Paris Métro Line 3.

==Location==
The station is located under Boulevard Berthier between Rue de Courcelles and Avenue de Villiers. Oriented along a northeast–southwest axis, it is situated between the Louise Michel and Pereire stations and is extended by an old terminal loop.

==History==
The station is named after the &quot;Porte de Champerret&quot;, a gate in the nineteenth century Thiers Wall of Paris on the way to the hamlet of &quot;Champerret&quot;, which was merged with the commune of Levallois-Perret in 1867. The station was opened on 15 February 1911, when the line was extended from Pereire and was the western terminus of the line until its extension to Pont de Levallois – Bécon on 24 September 1937. It then became a transit station with the commissioning of the extension to the current terminus at Pont de Levallois - Bécon. The turning loop, under which the new tunnel passes, is now used as a depot.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated on 21 September 2002.

In 2018, 3,431,010 travelers entered this station, which placed it at the 158th position of the metro stations for its frequency.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three entrances divided into four metro outlets, each embellished with a Dervaux type balustrade:
* access 1 - &quot;Place Stuart-Merrill&quot; comprising two fixed staircases indicated by the same mast with a yellow &quot;M&quot; inscribed in a circle, emerging at the eastern corner of this place near the Square Jérôme-Bellat;
* access 2 &quot;Avenue Stéphane-Mallarmé - Espace Champerret&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase lined and an ascending escalator, located in the heart of Place Stuart-Merrill, occupied by a dedicated bus station;
* access 3 - &quot;Avenue de Villiers&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase decorated with a Dervaux candelabra, located at the right of no. 141 of this avenue.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Porte de Champerret is a station with a particular configuration. Because of its status as a former terminus, it has four tracks, distributed in two identical half-stations (one per direction) with two tracks framing an island platform under an elliptical vault, layout which it shares with Château de Vincennes on line 1 and Porte de la Villette on line 7. The tracks framing the axial pedestal are used by ordinary traffic on the line, the other two being dedicated to a depot for trains and giving access only to the old terminal loop westbound.

The decoration is classic with bevelled white ceramic tiles covering the walls, the vault, and the tunnel exits, while the lighting is provided by tubes and spotlights. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is inscribed on enameleld plates, in capital letters on the side walls and in Parisine font on the platforms as well as the central wall. The seats are yellow &quot;motte&quot; style.

===Bus connections===
The bus station near the station is the terminus of several bus lines. The station is served by lines 84, 92, 93, PC, 163, 164 and 165 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N16 and N52 of Noctilien bus service.

<text>Elric!, subtitled &quot;Dark Fantasy Roleplaying&quot;, is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game published under license by Chaosium in 1993. Based on the Elric of Melniboné books by Michael Moorcock, this is the fifth edition of the game originally titled &quot;Stormbringer&quot;. 

==Description==
The campaign starts when the world is only ten years from utter and inescapable destruction. Like Elric in the original Moorcock novels, the player characters will, during the course of play, be offered weapons, powers, spells, and quests that offer great power, but always at a cost. By engaging with these pacts, a high-level character might reach the stage where they can no longer miss a sword swing, no longer take damage from weapons or poisons, nor be outwitted.

As RPG historian Stu Horvath noted in his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, the world&#x27;s oncoming doom and the ability to create pacts with dark forces to become unstoppable and invulnerable &quot;seduces players by offering a way around the randomness that so often frustrates their ambitions and, in giving them that power, sets their fate and damns them. It is a rare thing for a character not to be utterly consumed by their choices, just like Elric.&quot; Richard Watts concurred, saying, &quot;In &quot;Elric!&quot;, everyone is self-serving. What matter such details as honour or nationalism, when in less than ten years the entire world will be one seething, shapeless seas? Law and Chaos be damned; greed and self-aggrandisement are the true gods of &quot;Elric!&quot;.&quot;

==Publication history==
Chaosium published the first edition of &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, a role-playing game based on Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Elric novels, in 1981, followed by a second edition in 1985, and a third edition in 1987. All of these used a variant of Chaosium&#x27;s Basic Roleplaying, with revised rules for magic and other setting-specific elements. The fourth edition in 1990 used essentially the same set of rules with the exception of the magic system, which was changed extensively.

But the early 1990s saw the rise of role-playing games with newer rules systems such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game&quot;. In an effort to keep up, Chaosium produced a 5th edition retitled &quot;Elric!&quot; to differentiate it from the decade-old &quot;Stormbringer&quot;. Designers Lynn Willis, Richard Watts, Mark Morrison, Jimmie W. Pursell Jr., Sam Shirley, and Joshua Shaw substantially revised the entire game, adding additional material from several older game supplements that were no longer in print.

Game historian Shannon Appelcline noted that Chaosium began creating significant role-playing systems for the first time in nearly a decade, commenting, &quot;The first was &quot;Elric!&quot; (1993), a totally new &quot;BRP&quot; vision of the Young Kingdoms, meant to replace the venerable &quot;Stormbringer&quot; ... The new system was cleaner and more balanced. It also downplayed demons and increased the role of common magic — perhaps making it more accessible, particularly in Middle America.&quot;

The supplement &quot;The Bronze Grimoire&quot; was published in 1994.

In 1996, Chaosium entered the collectible card game market with &quot;Mythos&quot;, but took such a loss when the new game failed that, as Appelcline noted, &quot;Chaosium responded by shutting down several of its lines, this time &quot;Pendragon&quot;, &quot;Elric!&quot;, &quot;Nephilim&quot;, and &quot;Mythos&quot; itself.&quot;

This was the end of the &quot;Elric&quot; series of role-playing games until 2001 when Chaosium briefly published a d20 version of the game called &quot;Dragon Lords of Melniboné&quot; (2001).

==Reception==
Matthew Gabbert reviewed &quot;Elric!&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #39 (1994), rating it a 3 out of 5 and stated that &quot;As a stand-alone, complete game system, &quot;Elric!&quot; succeeds, especially for those only recently introduced to Moorcock&#x27;s tragic hero. For fans of &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, the Conversion Rules allow you to update your Young Kingdoms veterans, if you feel the need.&quot;

In Issue 79 of the French games magazine &quot;Casus Belli&quot;, Tristan Lhomme called &quot;Elric!&quot; &quot;the designated successor to &quot;Stormbringer&quot; and yet a new game, vastly different from its illustrious predecessor.&quot; Lhomme warned players of &quot;Stormbringer&quot; &quot;be careful: the entire universe has been rewritten. And even if [the new designers] read the same novels as Ken St-André (&quot;Stormbringer&quot;″s dad), they obviously didn&#x27;t remember the same things. In fact, they systematically favored the most sinister and despairing elements, making &quot;Elric!&quot; a terribly dark game, which well deserves its subtitle &#x27;Dark Fantasy&#x27;.&quot; Lhomme thought that the revision of the rules was needed, writing, &quot;the &quot;Stormbringer&quot; system was ten years old and had aged quite badly. Of course, the substance remains the same: the good old Basic RolePlaying Game (BRPG). Regulars will be on familiar ground: the seven usual characteristics and around thirty skills rated out of 100. However, this version of the BRPG reserves enough good surprises to deserve more than a passing glance.&quot; Lhomme called the new magic system &quot;remarkable&quot; but found the best part of the new rules to be the combat system, calling it &quot;undoubtedly the most efficient simulation that could be obtained starting from Basic Role-Playing. It remains simple to manage, while offering enough complexity to please gaming fanatics of the simulation.&quot; Lhomme thought that the game&#x27;s strength was its &quot;fluid and officient&quot; system, but that the writing was often too dense and the rulebook suffered from a lack of illustrations. Lhomme concluded, &quot;&quot;Elric!&quot; largely lives up to what one might expect: a very good game, which has everything it takes to take over from &quot;Stormbringer&quot;: more adult and more desperate than its predecessor, and more oriented towards the discovery of the world of the Young Kingdoms than towards the creation of hyper-powerful characters clad in combat demons.&quot;

In Issue 17 of &quot;Australian Realms&quot;, Richard Watts warned about the dark spirit of the game, saying, &quot;For the referee, the challenge of making such a world attractive, not to mention enjoyable and dramatically satisfying for the players, is greater than in most fantasy games. The reward of a satisfying campaign is correspondingly high.&quot; Watts also noted, &quot;&quot;Elric!&quot; requires referees with keen minds. Not only must you balance the players&#x27; freedom with the direction of your plot, you must also ensure that the game&#x27;s overall mood and atmosphere are dark without being claustrophobic.&quot; Watts concluded, &quot;It is the nature of beauty, and the attraction, that it is transient. So too is any campaign, and sooner or later yours must end, and a presumably, the world along with it. But if your game has been rewarding, rich, dramatic and inspirational, its death will be greeted, not with disappointment, but with satisfaction.&quot; 

In Issue 77 of the Israeli magazine &quot;Wiz&quot;, David Silberstein liked the game, saying, &quot;The game system itself is excellent, easy to learn and play, and basically combines everything a great fantasy game should have. Beyond that, you will find lots of ideas and tips for players and beginners so there is no room for worry.&quot;

<text>Wagram () is a station on Line 3 of the Paris Métro located in the 17th arrondissement of Paris. Alphabetically, the station is the last on the Paris Métro system.

==Location==
The station is located under Avenue de Villiers, between Avenue de Wagram and Rue Jouffroy-d&#x27;Abbans. Oriented approximately along an east–west axis, it lies between Pereire and Malesherbes stations.

==History==
&quot;Wagram&quot; was opened on 23 May 1910 when the line was extended from Villiers to Pereire. The station is named after the Avenue de Wagram, which was named after the Battle of Wagram, where Napoléon Bonaparte defeated the Archduke Charles of Austria in 1809 in the Austrian town of Deutsch-Wagram near Vienna.

From the 1960s, the platforms walls were modernized with the installation of a metallic bodywork with blue painted surrounds. This technique is then widely used in the network stopping points as an inexpensive way to modernize them quickly.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated in the course of the 2000s.

In 2018, 2,565,333 travelers entered this station.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances:
* Entrance 1: Place Monseigneur-Loutil, consisting of a fixed staircase adorned with a Guimard entrance registered as a historic monument (decree of 12 February 2016), leading to the corner formed by Rue Brémontier (at No. 72) and Avenue de Villiers (near No. 1);
* Entrance 2: Avenue de Villiers, consisting of an escalator allowing only an exit from the platform in the direction of Pont de Levallois - Bécon, located opposite no. 74 of this avenue.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Wagram is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the arch is elliptical. Since the 1950s, the walls have been cladded in metal bodywork with blue horizontal uprights and golden, illuminated advertising frames, complemented by blue &quot;Motte&quot; style seats. The bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the side walls, the tunnel exits and the outlets of the corridors. The vault is painted white, and lighting is provided by independent fluorescent tubes. The name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates incorporated into the bodywork.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 31 and 93 of the RATP Bus Network, as well as, at night, by lines N16 and N52 of the Noctilien network.

<doc id="503913" wikidata="Q991363" url="?curid=503913" title="Corner Brook">
<text>Corner Brook (2021 population: 19,333 CA 29,762) is a city located on the west coast of the island of Newfoundland in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Corner Brook is the fifth largest settlement in Newfoundland and Labrador, and the largest outside the Avalon Peninsula.

Located on the Bay of Islands at the mouth of the Humber River, the city is the second-largest population centre in the province behind St. John&#x27;s, and smallest of three cities behind St. John&#x27;s and Mount Pearl. As such, Corner Brook functions as a service centre for western and northern Newfoundland. It is located on the same latitude as Gaspé, Quebec, a city of similar size and landscape on the other side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Corner Brook is the most northern city in Atlantic Canada.

It is the administrative headquarters of the Qalipu Mi&#x27;kmaq First Nations band government. The Mi&#x27;kmaq name for the nearby Humber River is &quot;Maqtukwek.&quot;

==History==

The area was surveyed by Captain James Cook in 1767. The Captain James Cook Historic Site stands on Crow Hill overlooking the city. By the middle of the 19th century, the population of Corner Brook was less than 100, and the inhabitants were engaged in fishing and lumber work.

The area was originally four distinct communities, each with unique commercial activities: Curling, with its fishery; Corner Brook West (also known as Humber West or Westside) with its retail businesses; Corner Brook East (also known as Humbermouth and the Heights) with its railway and industrial operations; and Townsite (known as Corner Brook) to house employees of the pulp and paper mill, laid out in 1923 by Thomas Adams using Garden City principles. In 1956, these four communities were amalgamated to form the present-day City of Corner Brook.

Between 1948 and 1958, about 70 people from Latvia and Germany settled in Corner Brook. They came as part of then Premier Joseph Smallwood&#x27;s New Industries program. They built and worked at North Star Cement and the Atlantic Gypsum Plant. (For more history on the subject, see Latvians and Baltic Germans in Corner Brook.)
Corner Brook is home to the Corner Brook Pulp &amp; Paper Mill (owned by Kruger Inc.), which is a major employer for the region. The city has the largest regional hospital in western Newfoundland. The Western Memorial Regional Hospital opened to patients and clients on June 2, 2024. It also has a wide array of shopping and retail businesses and federal and provincial government offices. It is home to Grenfell Campus, Memorial University, as well as campuses of Academy Canada and College of the North Atlantic.

It was founded in 1979 by Maxim Mazumdar, and it operates a year-round professional theatre company from its home base, Corner Brook. From September to May, their Sarah McDonald Youth Theatre offers classes in acting, stagecraft and music to youth aged 6 to 8 and produces several youth and community-oriented productions in and around the city. From May to September, it puts together a professional repertory summer festival in Cow Head, Gros Morne National Park and regular national and international touring of plays like &quot;Tempting Providence&quot; by Robert Chafe, &quot;With Cruel Times in Between&quot; by Sarah McDonald, based on the various works by Al Pittman and &quot;Our Frances&quot; by Berni Stapleton.

Corner Brook is home to Gros Morne Summer Music, a classical music festival that spans July and August. The Hangashore Folk Festival was a folk festival based in Corner Brook from 1980–1994.

For 32 years, the March Hare literary festival ran every March. It celebrated poetry and written works by poets and writers from around Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and the world.

==Climate==
Corner Brook has a humid continental climate (Dfb) typical of most of Newfoundland. It is warmer in summer than St. John&#x27;s due to less maritime exposure, whereas winters are colder than in the provincial capital. In terms of its overall climate, it is very maritime-like, especially considering how the climate is in mainland Canada on similar latitudes. Precipitation is heavy year-round but highest in December and January and lowest in April and May, with relatively dry, stable conditions extending into July many years. 
The Corner Brook area lies in an especially heavy snow belt because of cold Arctic air masses from mainland Canada, coming from the west or northwest, crossing the waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and picking up moisture, resulting in &quot;sea-effect&quot; snow (similar to &quot;lake effect&quot; snow in US locations like Muskegon and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan). The &quot;sea effect&quot; snow comes in addition to the heavy snow that can accompany mid-latitude storms, called &quot;nor&#x27;easters,&quot; that approach the area from the U.S. Northeastern and New England states. Such storms can bring high winds and heavy precipitation, with possibly changing precipitation types in a single storm. The combination of intense winter storms and &quot;sea effect&quot; snow make December and January the wettest months on average in Corner Brook. In December and January combined, average snowfall reaches nearly .

<doc id="503914" wikidata="Q313177" url="?curid=503914" title="Lionel Kieseritzky">
<text>Lionel Adalbert Bagration Felix Kieseritzky (; – ) was a Baltic German chess master and theoretician, known for his contributions to chess theory, as well for a game he lost against Adolf Anderssen, known as the &quot;Immortal Game&quot;. Kieseritzky&#x27;s name became associated with several openings and opening variations, such as the Kieseritzky Gambit, Kieseritzky Attack, and the Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit.

==Early life==
Kieseritzky was born in Dorpat (now Tartu), Livonia, Russian Empire into a Baltic German family. From 1825 to 1829 he studied at the University of Dorpat, and then worked as a mathematics teacher, like Anderssen. From 1838 to 1839, he played a correspondence match against Carl Jaenisch – unfinished, because Kieseritzky had to leave for Paris. In Paris he became a chess professional, giving lessons or playing games for five francs an hour, and editing a chess magazine.

==Chess career==
Kieseritzky became one of the four leading French masters of the time, alongside Louis de la Bourdonnais, Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant, and Boncourt, and for the few years before his death was among the top several players in the world along with Howard Staunton. His knowledge of the game was significant and he made contributions to chess theory, but his career was somewhat blighted by misfortune and a passion for the unsound. In 1842 he tied a match with Ignazio Calvi (+7−7=1). In 1846, he won matches against the German masters Bernhard Horwitz (+7−4=1) and Daniel Harrwitz (+11−5=2). He enjoyed a number of other victories across his career, but his nerve was lacking when it came to tournament play.

He was invited to play in the first international chess tournament, the London 1851 tournament, where he scored ½–2½ and was defeated in the first round by the eventual winner Adolf Anderssen. During his time in London, Kieseritzky also played a casual game against Anderssen which became known as &quot;The Immortal Game&quot;. Despite losing, Kieseritzky himself recorded and published the game during his period as editor of &quot;La Regence&quot;.

Kieseritzky is credited with invention of the first three-dimensional chess, Kubicschach (&quot;Cubic Chess&quot;), in 1851, but this variant failed to attract adherents. The 8×8×8 cube format was later picked up by Dr. Ferdinand Maack in 1907 when developing Raumschach (&quot;Space Chess&quot;).

Kieseritzky died in Paris on 18 May 1853. He was buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave in the city.

==Notable games==
Shortly before the Immortal Game was played, Kieseritzky played a brief game against Schulten. In this earlier game, he made successful use of the same opening line with which he would later lose to Anderssen. Both games opened identically, through 5... Nf6.

<doc id="503915" wikidata="Q207970" url="?curid=503915" title="A Rush of Blood to the Head">
<text>A Rush of Blood to the Head is the second studio album by the British rock band Coldplay. It was released on 26 August 2002 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom, and a day later by Capitol Records in the United States. The album was produced by the band and Ken Nelson, and makes greater use of the electric guitar and piano than the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Parachutes&quot; (2000).

Recording of the album began after the band achieved worldwide popularity with &quot;Parachutes&quot; and the single &quot;Yellow&quot;. &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; topped the UK Albums Chart upon its first week of release in the United Kingdom, becoming the eighth best-selling album of the 21st century in the country. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) has since certified the album 10× Platinum for its accumulated sales of 3 million units in the United Kingdom, while over 17 million copies were sold worldwide. The album spawned the hit singles &quot;In My Place&quot;, &quot;The Scientist&quot; and &quot;Clocks&quot;. &quot;God Put a Smile upon Your Face&quot; was also released in select regions, but was significantly less successful in comparison.

&quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; has been critically acclaimed, and the band received three Grammy Awards for the album at the 45th Grammy Awards; Best Alternative Album, which was the band&#x27;s second win in a row, Best Rock Performance for &quot;In My Place&quot;, and Record of the Year for &quot;Clocks&quot; at the 46th ceremony. In 2007, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included it on their 200 Definitive Albums list. In 2010, it was among ten albums nominated for the best British album of the past 30 years at the Brit Awards, and one of ten classic album covers from British artists commemorated on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail. It has appeared on several editions of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. Multiple publications have listed &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; as one of the best albums of the 21st century.

==Recording==
Coldplay started recording &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; in London on 13 September 2001, but later relocated to Liverpool, where they had recorded some of the songs on their debut album &quot;Parachutes&quot; (2000). Lead singer Chris Martin said that once there they &quot;became obsessed with recording&quot;. &quot;In My Place&quot; was among the first songs recorded for the album during this period, and the one that the band released as the album&#x27;s lead single because it was the song that made them want to do a second album. It kept them going and made them think they could still write songs, following a strange period of not really knowing what they were doing three months after the success of &quot;Parachutes&quot;.

The opening track &quot;Politik&quot; was recorded two days following 2001&#x27;s September 11 attacks. According to an interview with lead singer Chris Martin, &quot;I wrote the song on 9/11 and we recorded it on 9/13. We were all, like everyone else, I suppose, a little confused and frightened. I get off tour and had a rest for one or two days. But then I get antsy again. I want to write songs and do things, &#x27;cause you never know what might happen.&quot; The band wrote more than twenty songs in the months following for the album and some of those, including &quot;In My Place&quot; and &quot;Animals&quot;, were performed live during the tours promoting &quot;Parachutes&quot;. The album&#x27;s title was revealed through a post on the band&#x27;s official website.

During initial recording sessions in Liverpool, Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland worked alone, and only on weekends. Each Monday, they would present the song ideas that they had developed to their bandmates. With &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; nearly completed, Martin went into the studio late one night and wrote a piano riff that he has stated &quot;just came out&quot;. The band recognised that this early version of the song, that would become &quot;Clocks&quot;, was special the first time Martin played it to them. Reasoning that it was too late to include the song on the album, they recorded a demo version and included it on a CD marked &quot;Songs for #3&quot;, featuring unfinished tracks they intended to work on for their third studio album.

By June 2002, the band had completed &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;, but thought their output sounded &quot;rubbish&quot; and reached an agreement with record label Parlophone to postpone the release of the album until they were completely satisfied. Subsequently, many songs were discarded because they sounded like they could have been on &quot;Parachutes&quot;. Martin has claimed that it would have been uninteresting: &quot;It would have shown that we&#x27;re happy to sit back on what we&#x27;d done, and we&#x27;re not. For us, it was important to progress and try to improve upon our abilities as musicians.&quot; Such ambitions put the band under strain: &quot;sometimes practice sessions ended abruptly with one or more members of Coldplay threatening to quit&quot;.

After headlining the 2002 Glastonbury Festival, Coldplay returned to the studio and worked on some tracks from the &quot;Songs for #3&quot; CD they had produced earlier. Phil Harvey, the band&#x27;s manager, heard &quot;Clocks&quot; and urged them to rework it immediately: &quot;No, you must do that song now &#x27;cause you&#x27;re going on [in the lyrics] about urgency, and you&#x27;re talking about keeping this song back. That doesn&#x27;t make sense.&quot;

== Composition ==

Production of the album began quickly with the writing of the track &quot;Politik&quot;, which was a song seen as a reflection of the world at the time, giving the band a renewed perspective on their lives and society. Many of the song lyrics on the album relate strongly to the theme of urgency. Martin has commented that previous songs were more relaxed since they were in a comfortable state of mind: &quot;Perhaps there&#x27;s a bit more urgency on some of these songs. And that&#x27;s born from all the places we&#x27;ve been and the things we&#x27;ve experienced.&quot; Martin has explained. In relation to the theme of urgency, Martin has also stated that the album&#x27;s title means &quot;doing something on impulse&quot;.

Several songs on the album are about the themes of love and relationships. These tracks are based on reality, but according to Martin, they were written with a fictional twist: &quot;Songs are like fairy tales: they have a beginning and an end and you can make it all work perfectly. Real life doesn&#x27;t work like that&quot;.

The album includes ballads and acoustic songs featuring extensive use of guitar and piano. The U2-esque &quot;epic rock&quot; of the album&#x27;s opening track &quot;Politik&quot;, the piano-driven &quot;Clocks&quot;, the loud guitars of &quot;A Whisper&quot;, and the country rock-inspired guitar in &quot;Warning Sign&quot; were seen as an extension of the band&#x27;s musical range. Chris Martin has also stated that the album&#x27;s title track is an homage to American singer-songwriter Johnny Cash, whom he considered one of &quot;the greatest ... men with just guitars&quot;. The title track is about uncertainties faced in life. According to Martin, the song &quot;Green Eyes&quot; was composed for an &quot;American friend&quot; and guitarist Jonny Buckland.

==Artwork==
The album cover for &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; was designed by photographer Sølve Sundsbø. Sundsbø had been hired by fashion magazine &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot; in the late 1990s to produce a shot with a &quot;technological feel, something all white&quot;, according to himself. As an artist, Sundsbø attempted to do a unique original piece, creating a shot that had never been seen before; He suggested taking shots using a three-dimensional scanning machine – used to measure head sizes for USAF fighter jet helmets – to fulfil his vision.

The model for the shots, named Mim, wore all-white cosmetic makeup, along with a coloured twill cape, to aesthetically produce optimal and desired results. The scanner could not properly identify some of the colors on the cape, so they were replaced with digital spikes, and the head in the image was chopped as the machine was unable to scan more than about thirty centimeters in height at a time. At first, Sundsbø had mixed feelings about the image, stating that when he first saw the result, he was terrified. &quot;I thought it was so beautiful, but I was sure the magazine was never going to run it.&quot; The editor of the magazine, however, absolutely loved the image, and eventually featured it in one of their publications. After seeing the image in a publication of the magazine, Chris Martin approached Sundsbø for proper permission to use the image as the cover of &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. For the album&#x27;s singles, Martin asked Sundsbø for any ideas; Sundsbø suggested scanning the head of each member of the band.

The album booklet contains only two photos; One with Coldplay in a location that was rumoured to be a forest, and one with the band in a recording studio. The album cover was among the ten chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of &quot;Classic Album Cover&quot; postage stamps issued in January 2010.

==Release==
&quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; was released on 26 August 2002 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom, and a day later on 27 August 2002 by Capitol Records in the United States. The album was completed and originally ready to hand over to record representatives and released in June 2002, however, after recording a demo of &quot;Clocks&quot; intended for the third album, the band delayed release by two months to allow them to work it into a finished track and include it on &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. Capitol released a remastered version of the album in 2008 on a 180-gram vinyl record as part of its &quot;From the Capitol Vaults&quot; series.

== Critical reception ==
=== Reviews ===

Upon release, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; received positive reviews from contemporary critics. Review aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised score of 80 out of 100 based on 25 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. This makes &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; Coldplay&#x27;s highest-scoring album on the website as of 2023. Many reviewers felt that it built upon &quot;Parachutes&quot;. Alexis Petridis of the newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the band&#x27;s &quot;new assurance is everywhere ... the timidity of &quot;Parachutes&quot; is nowhere to be found&quot;. He concludes, &quot;It sounds like an album ready to take on the world, and win.&quot;

Kelefa Sanneh of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the album, commenting that it is &quot;one of the year&#x27;s best albums&quot; and describing it as &quot;sparser, stranger and even catchier than its predecessor&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Rob Sheffield said that &quot;&quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is a nervier, edgier, thoroughly surprising album&quot;, adding, &quot;where &quot;Parachutes&quot; was the clumsy diary of a high-strung kid, &quot;A Rush of Blood&quot; sounds more like a band with the confidence to test its own limits.&quot; Ted Kessler of &quot;NME&quot; lauded the album, calling it &quot;an album of outstanding natural beauty, an organic, wholesome work.&quot; MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic echoed the above comments, saying that it is a &quot;strong album&quot;. Wilson, who compliments Martin for his &quot;sharpened&quot; falsetto and refined &quot;haunting delivery&quot; and Buckland for his &quot;riveting guitar work&quot;, notes that &quot;regardless of the band still being in their mid-twenties, they&#x27;ve made an amazing record&quot;. Emma Pearse of the American newspaper &quot;The Village Voice&quot; has the same sentiments, stating that it is &quot;a little edgier, trancier, and more conversational&quot; compared to &quot;Parachutes&quot;. Conversely, Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention () and quipped &quot;Let Green Eyes dump him for real and we&#x27;ll see how long he hums in the void&quot;.

In 2012, it was ranked number 466 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, with its ranking climbing to number 324 in the 2020 update. In 2013, the album topped a BBC Radio poll ahead of &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; by Keane, &quot;Rio&quot; by Duran Duran and &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; by Pink Floyd. It was also included in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; listed &quot;Green Eyes&quot; among the best deep cuts from the 21st century.

=== Corridors ===
The ticket hall, or &quot;rotunda&quot;, located under the Place du Havre between the stations of lines 12 and 13 has been called &quot;one of the architectural masterpieces of the Métro&quot;. It was designed by the architect Lucien Bechmann in the form of a large rotunda, a legacy of the former &quot;Nord-Sud&quot; company. Its metallic vault, comprises eight interlocking pillars, is adorned with mouldings and ceramic tiles with light brown and green motifs, while the vault is tiled in white with green friezes. Pillars regularly receive backlit advertising posters during certain event campaigns. Following a 2004 restoration of the pillars, only the vault itself is original.

A corridor connects on Line 9 to the southwest end of Line 14 Saint-Lazare metro station and, as a result, to Gare Saint-Lazare. In addition, it is possible through other corridors to reach the Opera station via the platforms of (RER E), then to , the hall of of the RER A line and finally the corridor leading to Line 7 and 8 at Opera station. This continuity, putting together several connections from the Saint-Augustin station to the Opera station, is the longest of the Paris metro.

Since 2011, the mosaic &quot;La Voix lactée&quot; by Quebec artist Geneviève Cadieux has been installed in the connecting corridor connecting line 14 to line 9 (Saint-Augustin station).

One of the main accesses is located on the &quot;Cour de Rome&quot;. This access is called &quot;La lentille&quot; (&quot;the Lens&quot;) and consists of a glass bubble to protect passengers from bad weather during the ascent, and to allow light to enter the station.
Underneath there is a large circular access shaft, with many escalators, which is the old TBM (&quot;Tunnel Boring Machine&quot;) access shaft for the construction of the extension to St Lazare. This access shaft allows direct access to the lines 3/13/14, the other lines being further away.

=== Platforms ===
The platforms of the four lines are standard configuration. Two per stop, they are separated by the metro tracks located in the center.

The platforms of Line 3 are built flush with the wall. The ceiling consists of a metal deck whose beams, silver in colour, are supported by vertical pillars. They are laid out in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style in neutral tones with two bright grey-green light canopies, the walls and tunnel exits are covered with large white flat tiles as well as grey tiled benches deprived of seats. The advertisements are devoid of frames and the station&#x27;s name is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plates.

On lines 12 and 13, the vault is elliptical, and the lower part of the walls are vertical, a shape specific to the old &quot;Nord-Sud&quot; stations. They are among the rare stations of this company not to have found their original style, only the green earthenware advertising frames being renewed. Their decoration is quite similar, approaching the style used for most metro stations, with white and rounded lighting canopies in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the &quot;renouveau du métro des années 2000&quot; renovations and bevelled white ceramic tiles covering the walls, the vault and the tunnel exits, on line 12, while the vault of line 13, lower, is painted white. The station on line 13 is also distinguished by the presence of platform screen doors and the absence of seats due to its frequent usage, unlike the platforms of line 12 equipped with white &quot;Motte&quot; style seats. The name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates in both cases.

The station of line 14 is established at great depth under the well of the Cour de Rome, which disrupts the elliptical vault in the form of a large glass footbridge and brings a little natural light on the platforms. Like the other stations on the line, it has a modern and sober decoration with light concrete as well as glass planks on the walls, platforms tiled in light grey, equipped with wooden seats and platform doors. The name of the station appears in Parisine script on backlit panels embedded in the sidewalls and on stickers affixed to the platform facades. The platforms are designed to accommodate trains of 120 meters long, but are only fitted out over 90 meters because the lack of space in the turnaround loop (very rare situation that the station shares with Place Monge on line 7). This was fixed towards the end of 2019, when the platforms were extended to be able to accommodate the MP 14 trainsets with eight cars.

=== Other connections ===
The station has, since 14 July 1999, a direct connection, with the Haussmann – Saint-Lazare station on line E of the RER.

It is also served by lines 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 42, 43, 66, 80, 94, 95 and 528 of the RATP Bus Network and, by night, by lines N01, N02, N15, N16, N51, N52, N53, N150, N151, N152, N153 and N154 from the Noctilien network.

<doc id="503923" wikidata="Q1674689" url="?curid=503923" title="Michael Watson">
<text>Michael Watson (born 15 March 1965) is a British former professional boxer who competed from 1984 to 1991. He held the Commonwealth middleweight title from 1989 to 1991, and challenged three times for a world title between 1990 and 1991. Watson&#x27;s career was cut short as a result of a near-fatal injury sustained during a loss to Chris Eubank for the WBO super-middleweight title in 1991.

==Amateur career==
Watson took up boxing at the age of fourteen at the Crown and Manor boxing club, where he proved to be a quick learner, winning an under-71 kg London Schools title in 1980.

He had an impressive 20–2 record at the Crown and Manor Club. He transferred to the Colvestone Boxing Club where he trained and sparred for over a year with Kirkland Laing, Dennis Andries, and Darren Dyer. He entered the 1983/84 Nationals at under 75 kg and won the title. On his 19th birthday he fought John Beckles during the 1984 London ABAs, both being national champions. Watson, initially seen as the underdog, won the fight in just over 30 seconds, and was seen as a hope for a boxing medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. However, that place on the Olympic team was taken by Liverpool&#x27;s Brian Schumacher.

==Professional career==
Watson&#x27;s professional career lasted from 1984 to 1991. The highlight was his May 1989 victory over Nigel Benn to secure the British Commonwealth middleweight title. This led to a world title clash with Jamaican Mike McCallum, who defeated Watson by a knockout in the eleventh round.

On 22 June 1991 at Earl&#x27;s Court, he met Chris Eubank in another opportunity for the world middleweight title. Eubank won by a majority decision of 116–113, 115–113 and 114–114, close enough to incur dissent from some commentators and supporters.

===Rematch with Eubank and career-ending injury===
A rematch was arranged on 21 September 1991 at White Hart Lane, this time for the vacant WBO super middleweight title. In round 11, with Watson ahead on points and seemingly on the verge of a stoppage victory, he knocked Eubank down with an overhand right. Moments later, Eubank was back on his feet and connected with a devastating uppercut, which caused Watson to fall back and hit the back of his head against the ropes. 

Referee Roy Francis stopped the fight in round 12, after which Watson collapsed in the ring. There was no ambulance or paramedic at the event. Doctors wearing dinner jackets arrived but after more than eight minutes had elapsed, during which time the fallen fighter received no oxygen. A total of 28 minutes elapsed before Watson received treatment in a hospital neurosurgical unit. He spent 40 days in a coma and had six brain operations to remove a blood clot.

After regaining consciousness, he spent over a year in intensive care and rehabilitation and six more years confined to a wheelchair while he slowly recovered some movement and regained the ability to speak and write. Peter Hamlyn, the consultant neurosurgeon who operated on Watson, said in 2010, &quot;I think back to those first days, and the milestone moments. The first eight months were so depressing. He couldn&#x27;t hear, couldn&#x27;t speak, couldn&#x27;t walk. Slowly, he clawed it all back. So extraordinary&quot;.

==Life after boxing==
Watson sued the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBoC) for negligence and won damages reputedly of around £1 million. The High Court ruled that the BBBoC was responsible for medical provision at a fight and that administering oxygen and resuscitation on site would have made a considerable difference to Watson&#x27;s outcome. Mr Justice Kennedy said that the board was &quot;in breach of its duty to Mr Watson&quot;. This decision was upheld at the Court of Appeal, and the BBBoC did not appeal to the House of Lords, selling their London headquarters to pay out a £400,000 compensation settlement. The judge said that this was &quot;sadly a long way short of the damages that [Watson] would have received had the defendants had the money or had they been insured&quot;.

On 19 April 2003 Watson completed the London Marathon, walking two hours each morning and afternoon for six days. Raising money for the Brain and Spine Foundation, Watson slept overnight in a support bus.
Finishing the race by his side were Chris Eubank and his neurosurgeon Peter Hamlyn, both of whom had become his personal friends. On 4 February 2004 Watson was awarded the MBE by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to disability sport. Watson was announced as a torchbearer in the 2012 Paralympic relay.

In February 2017 Watson and his carer, Lennard Ballack, were victims of a carjacking in Chingford, London. During the attack, Ballack had ammonia sprayed in his face and was beaten, whilst Watson was dragged along the road when the car was driven off, unable to escape. Watson suffered flashbacks and seizures after the event. The two attackers were later sentenced to 16 years in prison for their part in the attack and other crimes.

Watson&#x27;s career-ending bout and the risk of boxing from Frank Bruno&#x27;s career threatening (later proven career-ending) eye injury were documented on &quot;Four Kings&quot; mini documentary. He made an appearance for the final episode. He admitted that he has never resented Eubank for the injury.

<text>The Humber River is a river on Newfoundland in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is approximately 120 kilometres long; it flows through the Long Range Mountains, southeast then southwest, through Deer Lake, to the Bay of Islands at Corner Brook. It begins near the town of Hampden. Taylor&#x27;s Brook, Aidies Stream and Dead Water Brook run into the upper Humber. The Humber is one of Newfoundland&#x27;s longest rivers.

James Cook first charted the Humber in the summer of 1767. It was named for its English counterpart the Humber (estuary).

The Humber is rich in Atlantic salmon. From the 1800s, the river was used as a waterway for European trappers and loggers. It is one of the world&#x27;s best recreational salmon fishing rivers.

<doc id="503926" wikidata="Q7914670" url="?curid=503926" title="Vanessa Kerry">
<text>Vanessa Bradford Kerry (born December 31, 1976) is an American physician, public health expert, and advocate. She is a founder of the non-profit Seed Global Health, director of the Program in Global Public Policy and Social Change at Harvard Medical School, and serves as the Special Envoy for Climate Change and Health for the World Health Organization (WHO).

==Early life and education==
Kerry was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on December 31, 1976. She is the younger daughter of politician John Forbes Kerry and writer Julia Stimson Thorne. Her older sister Alexandra is an actress, filmmaker, director and producer. After her parents divorced, she moved with her mother to Bozeman, Montana. She attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts for high school.

Kerry graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover and &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from Yale University with a major in biology. While a student at Yale, she played for the varsity lacrosse team for four years. After graduating with her bachelor&#x27;s degree, she went to Harvard Medical School where she graduated with honors. She took a year off from Harvard to attend the London School of Economics and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, earning her master&#x27;s of science in health policy, planning and financing. While in London, she was a Fulbright Scholar.

While in medical school, she interned with the Vaccine Fund of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization and conducted a study on immunization in Ghana. She later studied and advised on government relations for health and development in Rwanda in partnership with Partners in Health.

==Career==
Kerry completed her internal medicine residency and critical care fellowship at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She is now a physician specializing in critical care. Kerry has continued work in global health and has collaborated on projects in Haiti and Rwanda through the Harvard Medical School Department of Global Health and Social Medicine. She has worked on public sector partnerships in Uganda, Malawi, Zambia and Sierra Leone through Seed Global Health and supports education and public policy at the MGH Center for Global Health. Kerry also serves as director of the Program in Global Public Policy and Social Change and is an associate professor at Harvard Medical School.

===Seed Global Health===
Active in global health for many years, in 2011 Kerry started the non-profit Seed Global Health. Seed&#x27;s flagship program was the Global Health Service Partnership (GHSP), a partnership with the Peace Corps. The Partnership sent health professionals abroad to work as medical and nursing educators and to help build capacity. With the Peace Corps through GHSP, Seed helped send over 191 physician and nurse educators to train more than 16,000 health professionals in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2018, Seed launched a new strategy, Sharing Knowledge, Saving Lives. The program is currently active in Malawi, Uganda, Sierra-Leone, and Zambia and has trained almost 40,000 health workers in seven countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in total.

In 2010, Kerry wrote an op-ed on the idea of sending American health professionals to teach for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She has also published in the New England Journal of Medicine and &quot;The Lancet&quot; on the topic. The program also partners with academic medical centers such as the Massachusetts General Hospital and the MGH Center for Global Health. In 2013, Kerry, as CEO was named a Draper Richards Kaplan Social Entrepreneur. In 2014, she was featured in &quot;Boston Magazine&quot;″s Power of Ideas for her work with the organization. In 2015, she earned an Honorary Doctor of Public Service degree from Northeastern University. In 2016, she was named a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader.

Seed&#x27;s work has promoted the need for a strong workforce and health systems for better health, economic growth, security and wellbeing. In 2021, Seed started promoting the connection between and health and climate change at the Conference of the parties 26.

Kerry is the Director of the Program in Global Public Policy at the Mass General Center for Global Health and spearheads the program in Global Public Policy and Social Change at the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine. She is an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and serves on its faculty.

=== World Health Organization ===
In June 2023, Kerry was appointed as the first Special Envoy for Climate Change and Health at the World Health Organization (WHO). At WHO, Kerry&#x27;s responsibilities include raising awareness of the impact of climate change on health, helping to mobilize resources to advance the work of WHO, and to advance high-level advocacy.

==Personal life==
On October 10, 2009 in Boston, Kerry married neurosurgeon Brian Vala Nahed, who specializes in brain tumors and spinal disorders. As a surgeon and scientist, Nahed leads a research lab, which aims to develop the first blood test for brain tumors. They have a son, Alexander Kerry Nahed, born in 2012 and a daughter born in 2015. 

===Advocacy===

Kerry took a leave from her medical studies in order to campaign for her father&#x27;s, then Senator John Kerry, presidential bid in 2004, even introducing him at that year&#x27;s Democratic National Convention. She campaigned by herself and with her sister, mostly focusing on campaign stops at university campuses. She made speeches in support of her father and focused on health care issues and tuition costs for students, two Democratic campaign issues she felt personally attached to. She also appeared with Alexandra on the MTV Music Video Awards show in Miami where she joined George W. Bush&#x27;s daughters Barbara and Jenna, who were campaigning for their father George W. Bush, to encourage youth and citizen voting. Jenna later confirmed that Barbara and Jenna also developed a friendship with John Kerry&#x27;s daughters, Alexandra and Vanessa. Through her work with her father and her public health policy education, she has not ruled out running for political office in the future.

She has also spoken at a number of venues around the globe including World Health Assembly, United Nations,Aspen Ideas Festival, Millennium Campus Network Conferences, TedX Boston, San Diego State University, UCLA, APHA and other venues.

<doc id="503927" wikidata="Q131977" url="?curid=503927" title="Parachutes (Coldplay album)">
<text>Parachutes is the debut studio album by the British rock band Coldplay. It was released on 10 July 2000 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom. The album was produced by the band and British record producer Ken Nelson, except for one track, &quot;High Speed&quot;, which was produced by Chris Allison. &quot;Parachutes&quot; spawned the singles &quot;Shiver&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, and &quot;Trouble&quot;, with a limited European release of &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot;. The album was also supported by the Parachutes Tour, which saw the band performing 131 shows in their first world tour.

The album was a commercial success and was met with positive reviews from critics. Upon release, it quickly reached number one in the United Kingdom and has since been certified 9× Platinum. In the United States, the album peaked at number 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and eventually was certified double platinum. It won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2002, the British Album of the Year award at the 2001 Brit Awards, and many other accolades. &quot;Parachutes&quot; is also the 22nd-best-selling album of the 21st century in the United Kingdom. , it has sold over 13 million copies worldwide.

==Recording and production==
The band began production on &quot;Parachutes&quot; in late 1999, after producing and releasing &quot;The Blue Room EP&quot; with British record producer Chris Allison. Allison was asked to assist with production, and the band&#x27;s musical direction, which was desired by both the band &amp; the A&amp;R department. Production started with the track &#x27;High Speed&#x27;, which was part of the EP and was later re-released as a part of &quot;Parachutes&quot;. Allison describes &#x27;High Speed&#x27; as thus: &#x27;You&#x27;ll notice it is quite a bit different to the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. I thought &#x27;High Speed&#x27; was a really good marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of it, something that was more atmospheric&#x27;. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on &quot;The Blue Room EP&quot;.

The band then took a lengthy break to compose more tracks for &quot;Parachutes&quot;. A few months later, it was arranged that Allison and the band meet at a rehearsal room to finally begin production on the band&#x27;s debut album. &quot;They started up playing in the rehearsal room and they really weren&#x27;t together at all. And I was very honest with them, I just sort of said &#x27;Look, this simply isn&#x27;t good enough&#x27;&quot;. Allison adds, &quot;The interesting, the most significant thing that did occur out of the fact that we didn&#x27;t end up starting the album on that day of the rehearsal was that Chris Martin had not written &quot;Yellow&quot; by that time&quot;.

A couple of months later, British record producer Ken Nelson was chosen, producing all but one song on &quot;Parachutes&quot;. He was introduced to Coldplay by his manager Pete Byrne (who gave him a copy of the band&#x27;s Fierce Panda-distributed debut single in 1999). Nelson has claimed that, as soon as he heard vocalist Chris Martin&#x27;s voice on the song &quot;Bigger Stronger&quot;, he &quot;realised that he was something special&quot;. Nelson was offered the job while Coldplay were performing in Liverpool with English indie rock band Gomez (whose debut album, &quot;Bring It On&quot;, was what he had produced at the time).

Coldplay initially planned to record &quot;Parachutes&quot; in the space of two weeks. However, tours and other live performances caused the recording to spread out between November 1999 and May 2000. The band began work on the album at Rockfield Studios in Wales, continuing with sessions at Liverpool&#x27;s Parr Street Studios. The band worked in three studio rooms at Parr Street, mostly in the project studio which producer Ken Nelson describes as &quot;basically a demo room&quot;. The Chris Allison-produced track &quot;High Speed&quot; was also included on the album, and originates from earlier sessions at Orinoco Studios in London. The album was mixed by American engineer Michael Brauer in New York. Coldplay&#x27;s record label, Parlophone, had originally intended to use a mixing engineer for the tracks they picked as singles, but eventually hired Brauer to work on all songs on &quot;Parachutes&quot; except the song &quot;High Speed&quot; which was mixed by Chris Allison.

At the Liverpool concert where he was offered the production job, Nelson had noted that Coldplay&#x27;s performance was &quot;very very uptight [...] they rushed through the set and it was quite difficult to listen to&quot;. Once in the studio Nelson and the band went through each song, learning how to play the piece live and deciding what tempo to play it at in an attempt to get the group to &quot;calm down&quot; (&quot;Trouble&quot;, for example, had to be reworked to eliminate the cacophony included in its early versions).

The album&#x27;s cover features a photograph of a yellow globe taken with a disposable Kodak camera. The globe had been purchased from W H Smith for £10; it was featured in the music videos for &quot;Shiver&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot;, and also accompanied the band on their tours. The album was dedicated to drummer Will Champion&#x27;s mother, Sara Champion, who died of cancer in May 2000, two months before the release of &quot;Parachutes&quot;.

==Music and style==
Champion has explained that Nelson&#x27;s production style was liberating and allowed the band to feel at ease during the recording of &quot;Parachutes&quot; (many songs from the album often featured slow tempos). The ensuing album was &quot;a record&#x27;s worth of moody and atmospheric tunes&quot;. As a nod to the moods created by the album, Champion has compared the song lyrics to the 1972 song &quot;Perfect Day&quot; by American rock singer-songwriter Lou Reed, stating that the &quot;lyrics are beautiful and they&#x27;re really, really happy, but the music is really, really sad. It&#x27;s that kind of thing, where you can create [differing] moods through the music and lyrics.&quot;

&quot;Parachutes&quot; was recognised to have an alternative rock, indie rock and post-Britpop, with some stylistic comparisons being made to contemporaries such as Radiohead and Travis. In fact, a few critics have suggested that the album&#x27;s commercial success was due in part to a portion of Radiohead&#x27;s audience being alienated by the band&#x27;s experimental and more electronic-influenced &quot;Kid A&quot; album.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Parachutes&quot; was released on 10 July 2000 in the United Kingdom by Parlophone. In the United States, it was released on 7 November 2000 by Nettwerk. The album has been made available in various formats since its release: both Parlophone and Nettwerk released it as a CD in 2000, while in the next year &quot;Parachutes&quot; enjoyed a cassette release made by newfound label Capitol Records. In China, the album&#x27;s commercial release was forbidden due to &quot;inflammatory political content&quot;, with the track &quot;Spies&quot; being singled out as the prime offender. In 2002, Parlophone issued the album as an LP. In November 2020, Coldplay released a 20th anniversary version in transparent yellow vinyl.

The main version of the record contains 10 tracks, with &quot;Everything&#x27;s Not Lost&quot;, the last of them, having a hidden song called &quot;Life Is for Living&quot;, clocking in for a total of 7:15. The Japanese version contains all main tracks, plus &quot;Careful Where You Stand&quot; and &quot;For You&quot;, which were originally released as the B-sides of &quot;Shiver&quot;, the hidden song is on the pre-gap of track 11.

Four singles were released in total: &quot;Shiver&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot;. The first served as lead single in the United Kingdom while &quot;Yellow&quot; was used in the United States. Upon the release of &quot;Trouble&quot;, Coldplay abandoned their initial plan of releasing &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot; as the album&#x27;s fourth effort, since they deemed three singles were enough for an album. Despite this, however, it was released as a single in some European regions.

== Critical reception ==
=== Reviews ===
&quot;Parachutes&quot; was released to generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 20 reviews. In a contemporary review of the album, Michael Hubbard of musicOMH called it &quot;an album of remarkable depth, especially when one considers the youthful ages of the band members.&quot; Siobhan Grogan of &quot;NME&quot; stated that &quot;all told, it&#x27;s incredible this is a debut album&quot; and concluded that &quot;accomplished, yet subtle, it works perfectly as a whole in a way all the production skills in the world couldn&#x27;t replicate.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; hailed &quot;Parachutes&quot; as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and &quot;a defining musical statement of 2000&quot;, while James Oldham of &quot;Uncut&quot; felt that the album &quot;more than justifies the plaudits heaped upon [the band] by the weekly music press&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the album as &quot;one of the year&#x27;s most uplifting albums&quot;, adding that it features &quot;elegant songs, classic guitars and gorgeous singing&quot;.

While noting that &quot;Parachutes&quot; &quot;brings nothing new to the table&quot; and that its &quot;musical reference points are immediately recognizable and difficult to overlook&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot; stated that the band &quot;seems talented enough to transcend this early identity crisis.&quot; Matt Diehl of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; opined that the album &quot;ultimately rises above its influences to become a work of real transcendence&quot;. In a retrospective write-up, MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic commented that &quot;Parachutes&quot; introduced the band as &quot;young musicians still honing their sweet harmonies&quot;, adding that the album &quot;deserved the accolades it received because it followed the general rule when introducing decent pop songs: keep the emotion genuine and real.&quot;

In a less-enthusiastic review, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called the album &quot;harmless and pretty... [but] nothing else&quot;. Barry Walters, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, similarly writes that &quot;there&#x27;s little on &quot;Parachutes&quot; that demands attention or punctures the pensive spell, and, unlike Travis&#x27;s, Coldplay&#x27;s hooks are slight.&quot; In his Consumer Guide column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau selected &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot; as &quot;choice cuts&quot;, indicating good songs on &quot;an album that isn&#x27;t worth your time or money.&quot; Setareh Yousefi of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; felt that &quot;the finer moments of &quot;Parachutes&quot; are blended with some boring sappy songs&quot;, with Martin&#x27;s &quot;powerful voice&quot; ultimately being &quot;in many ways wasted on songs that are alright but not bewildering.&quot;

=== Rankings ===
== Accolades ==
==Commercial performance==
The popularity of the songs in British clubs, pubs and sporting events led &quot;Parachutes&quot; to debut at number-one in the UK Albums Chart with 70,935 copies sold. Its biggest sales period, however, was during the penultimate week of 2000, when the album sold 170,642 copies and surpassed one million total sales. The record is certified 9× Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry for selling over 2,700,000 copies. In July 2011, it climbed from number 184 to number 48 for a 318th charting week. As of January 2018, the album remains Coldplay&#x27;s third biggest in the country, behind &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; (2.9 million) and &quot;X&amp;Y&quot; (2.7 million). In 2022 Parachutes was named as the 10th most successful debut album in UK chart history.

In the United States, &quot;Parachutes&quot; debuted at number 189 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 five weeks after its release. It later peaked at number 51 and reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers. Over two million copies have been shipped to the United States, leading to being certified 2× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It was also certified 4× Platinum in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association, and 2× Platinum in Canada by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. As of July 2020, &quot;Parachutes&quot; has sold 31,922 copies on cassette in UK, making it the 33rd best-selling cassette since 2000.

== Legacy ==

With nearly 2.7 million units sold in the United Kingdom, &quot;Parachutes&quot; is the 22nd best-selling album of the 21st century and 45th of all time in the country. It was also shortlisted for the 2000 Mercury Music Prize and the overall era earned the band many awards, including British Album of the Year at the Brit Awards, Best Album at the &quot;Q&quot; Awards and Best Alternative Music Album at the Grammy Awards.

British trade paper &quot;Music Week&quot;, praised it as one of the most-impressive debut albums ever, spawning the hit singles &quot;Shiver&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot; and &quot;Yellow&quot;, with the latter getting included in Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot; list for being one of the most successful and important recordings in music. In 2010, &quot;Parachutes&quot; was placed in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 272 on their &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list.

While making a 20th anniversary review, Jon O&#x27; Brien from the Recording Academy labeled it as Coldplay&#x27;s most influential album to date, impacting on the work of artists such as The Fray, Snow Patrol and OneRepublic. He also mentioned that &quot;Parachutes&quot; &quot;ushered in a new wave of mild-mannered guitar bands&quot;. Despite the album&#x27;s success, in a 2006 interview Chris Martin said that the band doesn&#x27;t like it. He also commented that they look beyond: &quot;We know that&#x27;s terrible music and we always try to think about what we can do next.&quot;

<text>The Gare Saint-Lazare (; ), officially Paris Saint Lazare, is one of the seven large mainline railway station terminals in Paris, France. It was the first railway station built in Paris, opening in 1837. It mostly serves train services to western suburbs, as well as intercity services toward Normandy using the Paris–Le Havre railway. Saint-Lazare is the third busiest station in France, after the Gare du Nord and Gare de Lyon. It handles 290,000 passengers each day. The current station building opened in 1889 and was designed by architect Juste Lisch; the maître d&#x27;œuvre (general contractor) was Eugène Flachat.

==History==

The first station at Saint Lazare was northwest of its current position, called &quot;Embarcadère des Batignolles&quot;. The station was opened by Marie-Amélie (wife of Louis-Philippe of France) on 24 August 1837. The first line served was the single track line to Le Pecq. In 1843 St-Lazare was the terminus for three lines; by 1900 this number had tripled. The station had 14 platforms in 1854 after several enlargements, and now has 27 platforms sorted in six destination groups.

On 27 April 1924 the inner suburban lines were electrified with third rail. The same lines were re-electrified at overhead wires in the 1960s.

On 21 March 2012, a new three-level shopping mall with 80 shops opened inside the passenger hall.

== Geography ==
The Gare Saint-Lazare is situated in the 8th arrondissement, in a very dense business and shopping area of Paris.

==Gare Saint-Lazare in art and literature==

The Gare Saint-Lazare has been represented in a number of artworks. It attracted artists during the Impressionist period and many of them lived very close to the Gare St-Lazare during the 1870s and 1880s.

Édouard Manet lived close by, at 4 rue de Saint-Pétersbourg. Two years after moving to the area he showed his painting &quot;The Railway&quot;, (also known as &quot;Gare Saint-Lazare&quot;) at the Paris Salon in 1874. Painted from the backyard of a friend&#x27;s house on the nearby rue de Rome, this canvas, now in the National Gallery of Art at Washington D.C., portrays a woman with a small dog and a book as she sits facing us in front of an iron fence; a young girl to her left views the railroad track and steam beyond it. At the time of its first exhibition it was caricatured and the subject of ridicule.

Gustave Caillebotte also lived just a short walk away from the station. He painted &quot;Le Pont de l’Europe&quot; (The Bridge of Europe) in 1876 (now in the Petit Palais, Musée d’Art Moderne in Geneva, Switzerland) and &quot;On the Pont de l&#x27;Europe&quot; in 1876-80 (Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth). While the former picture looks across the bridge with the ironworks diagonally crossing the picture to the right, with a scene of partially interacting figures on the bridge to the left, the latter depicts the iron structure of the bridge face-on in a strong close-up of its industrial geometry, with three male figures to the left side of the painting all looking in different directions (the Pont de l&#x27;Europe is a massive bridge spanning the railyard of the newly expanded station, which at that time had an iron-work trellis).


In 1877, painter Claude Monet rented a studio near the Gare Saint Lazare. That same year he exhibited seven paintings of the railway station in an impressionist painting exhibition. He completed 12 paintings of this subject. Oscar-Claude Monet&#x27;s series of the Gare Saint-Lazare train station was one of his most famous series in his lifetime. Monet was one of the most important and influential painters in the Impressionist movement in the 19th century. He was a strong proponent of plein-air landscape painting. Artists such as Gustave Caillebotte, Edgar Degas and Berthe Morisot, do this in order to accurately portray the scene in the moment instead of creating the painting from what they could remember. Monet and others who followed the Impressionism Movement were not accepted in the Salon de Paris, because of their rejection of the academies&#x27; teachings of form, style, subject matter etc., so instead they decided to open a new exhibition on their own Impressionist Exhibition in April 1874.

Claude Monet&#x27;s depiction of this train station is an astonishing composition in which the hard-edged discs of the railroad signals hover above a rapidly scribbled swirl of blue and rose clouds of steam, with scrolled white edges, while the sketchy, angular drawing of the tracks and buildings provides contrast. The flat, opaque circle of the largest signal, placed dead center and thickly painted, is so insistent that it turns the picture into a near-abstraction. The &quot;Gare Saint-Lazare&quot; piece was shown at the Third Impressionist Exhibition. The Gare Saint-Lazare is very different from Monet&#x27;s previous paintings of harbors, boats and oceans that viewers had seen before. The &quot;Gare Saint-Lazare&quot; series of paintings lead the viewers through a tour of the train station in different points of the day. &quot;Monet exemplifies the modern life, in all its chaos and instability&quot;, The steam coming from the trains creates a way of dissolving the train and showing the impressionistic style of blending colors and light. Everything dissipates with the steam of the train and turns into a flurry of blended colors. As said by Émile Zola, &quot;Monet is able to turn a normally dirty and gritty place into a peaceful and beautiful scene…You can hear the trains rumbling in, see the smoke billow up under the huge roofs…that is where painting is today…our artists have to find the poetry in train station, the way their fathers found the poetry in forests and rivers&quot;. &quot;Monet’s work on the Gare Saint-Lazare is unparalleled in its evocation of steam and the smoke-filled station. In spite of the impressionist style, the work reproduces accurately the topography of the area, even allowing one to deduce the precise point where the artist was standing while painting. This is the first time an artist had showed a single theme through a series of variations&quot;

The Gare Saint-Lazare itself, a monument to the last word in state-of-the-art transportation, the railroad. Le Quartier de l&#x27;Europe, where artists like Claude Monet and Gustave Caillebotte spent a lot of time and painted was, in short, a paradigm of modern Paris; the forward-looking young artists who called it home, and who had consciously dedicated themselves to the interpretation of modern life, included in their work recognizable references to their neighborhood as a sign of both their commitment to the present, with all its irregularities and &quot;unaesthetic&quot; components, and their rejection of the past, with its Academy-sanctioned conventions.

Lesser-known artists who depicted the Gare Saint Lazare were Jean Béraud, who painted &quot;The Place and Pont de l&#x27;Europe&quot; in 1876-78 and Norbert Goeneutte (1854–1894), with a studio providing a very good view of the Pont de l&#x27;Europe, who painted this scene many times in the late 1880s. One of these is &quot;The Pont de l&#x27;Europe and Gare Saint-Lazare&quot; from circa 1888 (in the Baltimore Museum).

An engraving showing the Place de l&#x27;Europe bridge at the time of its opening in 1868 was made by Auguste Lamy.

In 1932, the wasteland behind the station became the subject of one of the most celebrated photographs of all time, Henri Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s &quot;Derrière la gare de Saint-Lazare&quot;. In Raymond Queneau&#x27;s 1947 book &quot;Exercises in Style&quot;, the Gare Saint-Lazare serves as the backdrop to much of the story&#x27;s action. In 1998 the Musée d&#x27;Orsay and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., put on an exhibition called &quot;Manet, Monet, and the Gare Saint-Lazare&quot;.

The Gare Saint-Lazare is mentioned or plays a role in Émile Zola&#x27;s &quot;La Bête humaine&quot; and Roland Sadaune&#x27;s &quot;Terminus St-Lazare&quot;.

The Gare Saint-Lazare is seen in the 1995 film &quot;French Kiss&quot; with Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan. It is the last scene in Paris where Kevin Kline&#x27;s character is being chased by Police Inspector Jean-Paul Cardon (Jean Reno) while trying to board a train south to Cannes (which is an inaccuracy since the Gare Saint-Lazare serves the North-West of France; trains for Cannes depart from the Gare de Lyon).

<doc id="503939" wikidata="Q1192517" url="?curid=503939" title="The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The story was originally published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; (UK) and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (US) in September 1893. This story introduces Holmes&#x27;s elder brother Mycroft. Doyle ranked &quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot; seventeenth in a list of his nineteen favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.

==Plot==

One summer evening, while engaged in an aimless conversation that has come round to the topic of hereditary attributes, Doctor Watson learns that Sherlock Holmes, far from being a one-off in his powers of observation and deductive reasoning, in fact has an elder brother whose skills Holmes claims outstrip even his own. As a consequence of this, Watson becomes acquainted with the Diogenes Club and his friend&#x27;s brother, Mycroft. Mycroft, as Watson learns, does not have the energy of his younger brother and as a consequence is uninterested in using his great skills for detective work:

In spite of his inertia, the elder Holmes has often delivered the correct answer to a problem that Sherlock has brought to him. On this occasion, however, it is Mycroft who has need to consult Sherlock. Mr. Melas, a Greek interpreter and neighbour of Mycroft, tells of a rather unnerving experience he has recently gone through.

Melas was called upon one evening by a man named Harold Latimer to go to a house, supposedly in Kensington, to translate on a business matter. On the way there in Latimer&#x27;s coach, Melas noticed that the windows were papered over so that he could not see where he was. Latimer also produced a bludgeon, laying it beside him as an implied threat. Melas protested, saying that what Latimer was doing was unlawful. The kidnapper replied that he would make it up to Melas, but threatened him with unspecified retribution should the evening&#x27;s business ever be made public.

For approximately two hours they drove, at last arriving at a house. It was dark, and Melas got only a general impression of a large property as he was hustled out of the coach and into the house. The house itself was poorly lit, but Melas made out that it was quite big. In the room into which he was led by Latimer and another, nervous, giggling gentleman—whose name is later discovered to be Wilson Kemp—Melas noticed a deep-pile carpet, a high marble mantel, and a suit of Japanese armour.

Another man was brought into the room. He was thin and emaciated and had sticking plaster all over his face, and a bandage sealing his mouth. Melas was sly enough to observe that his kidnappers were utterly ignorant of Greek, and used this to find out some information. While Latimer and his companion had Melas translate demands that the man sign some papers, Melas added his own short questions to the dialogue. The man not only answered Latimer that he would never sign these papers, but he also answered Melas that his name was Kratides, that he had been in London for three weeks, that he had no idea what house he was in, and that his captors at the house were starving him. He wrote all his answers, unable as he was to speak through the sticking plaster.

Much could be inferred from Kratides&#x27;s answers to Latimer, too. Evidently, Latimer was trying to coerce Kratides into signing over property to him, and a woman was also involved. Latimer had warned Kratides that his obstinacy would do her no good. Melas would have extracted the whole story from the stranger had the woman herself not burst in unexpectedly, but even that event furnished new information. She recognised Kratides as &quot;Paul&quot;, whereupon he managed to get the bandage off his mouth and he called her &quot;Sophy&quot;. They both behaved as though neither had expected to see the other.

Melas was ushered back into the coach for another interminable ride and was deposited far from his home on Wandsworth Common. He made it to Clapham Junction just in time for the last train to Victoria. He had presented his story at the Diogenes Club to Mycroft, who asks his brother Sherlock to look into it.
An advertisement has been placed begging the public for information. It yields a result. A Mr. Davenport knows the woman in question, and she is currently residing at The Myrtles, a house in Beckenham. Sherlock Holmes and his brother Mycroft, who received the message from Davenport, decide that they must go to Beckenham to see about this. Watson comes, too, and they decide to pick up Inspector Gregson, and Melas as well in case some translating needs to be done. They find, however, that he has already been picked up, by a nervous, giggling man brandishing a bludgeon. Holmes knows that this means the thugs know that Melas has betrayed them.

After the necessary legal procedures for securing a search warrant have been completed, the group proceeds to Beckenham only to discover that the house has been abandoned. Tracks indicate that a fully loaded coach has recently pulled out of the drive. Breaking in, they discover Melas and Kratides bound in a closed room where some charcoal has been lit to gas the two of them: Melas recovers thanks to Watson&#x27;s timely intervention, but Kratides is already dead.

Apparently, Kratides never signed any papers. It turns out that Sophy&#x27;s friends contacted Kratides, who was Sophy&#x27;s brother, in Greece to tell of what they thought was a bad situation for her with Latimer. He then came to England and wound up in Latimer&#x27;s power. Latimer tried to force Kratides to sign over his sister&#x27;s property, but he refused absolutely.

All that is ever again heard of the thugs Latimer and Kemp is a news story from Hungary describing the deaths of &quot;two Englishmen who had been travelling with a woman&quot;. The official report attributes their deaths to a fight between the two of them; however, Watson notes in closing that Holmes believes Sophy to have avenged the abuse of Kratides and herself by stabbing both Latimer and Kemp.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter&quot; was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in September 1893, and in the US in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (under the title &quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot;) on 16 September 1893. It was also published in the US edition of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in October 1893. The story was published with eight illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. It was included in &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
The story was adapted as a 1922 silent short film as part of the Stoll film series. It starred Eille Norwood as Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, and featured J. R. Tozer as Harold Latimer and Robert Vallis as Wilson Kemp.

The story was adapted for &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1954 TV series), starring Ronald Howard as Holmes and Howard Marion Crawford as Watson. However, a number of changes were made. For one, Mycroft Holmes does not appear in this episode. For another, the episode is renamed &quot;The Adventure of the French Interpreter&quot;, and thus Melas and Kratides are made Frenchmen instead of Greek. The French version of Kratides is also eventually made to sign the papers, rather than refusing, and he survives the story, pushing Kemp down a staircase and killing him, while Latimer is taken under arrest. The fate of Latimer&#x27;s former fiancée is left up to the viewer&#x27;s imagination.

The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.

The third episode of &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot; is based upon &quot;The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot;, but the beginning has a meeting between the heroes and Mycroft, with the scene being adapted from the story. The billiard-maker they analyze through the window turns out, unknown to them, to be Milverton&#x27;s informer and Moriarty&#x27;s henchman.

The story was adapted for television in 1985 as part of &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; series, starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes, David Burke as Dr. Watson and Charles Gray as Mycroft Holmes. The episode is largely faithful to the original short story, but certain changes are made; in particular, Kratides is eventually compelled to sign the paper and the ending is amended to have Holmes, Watson and Mycroft confront the villains on board a train as they attempt to escape to Greece, during which Latimer is killed as he attempts to escape and both Kemp and Sophia are taken into custody.

&quot;Art in the blood, Watson. It is liable to take the strangest forms.&quot; Sherlock Holmes clarifies to Dr. Joan Watson in the first episode of the second season of the CBS TV series &quot;Elementary&quot;, which refers to the assertion in the story, that &quot;Art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms.&quot; &quot;Art in the blood&quot;, twenty third episode of the second season of &quot;Elementary&quot;, which is named after an allusion from this story, updates many elements of the original story to the contemporary era. In the 24th episode, Sherlock describes Mycroft as a man who &quot;has no ambition and no energy&quot; and &quot;would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right&quot;, which is directly quoted from the story.

In the 2012 &quot;Sherlock&quot; episode &quot;A Scandal in Belgravia&quot;, Watson is seen writing a story in his blog titled &quot;The Geek Interpreter&quot;. In the 2014 episode &quot;The Empty Hearse&quot;, Sherlock and his brother Mycroft have a casual competition over analyzing a certain knitted hat, a reference to the discussion in this short story on analyzing a man they see on the street through the window of the Diogenes Club. In the 2015 special, &quot;The Abominable Bride&quot;, a Mr Melas is also referenced as waiting to see Mycroft after he has discussed a case with his brother and Dr. Watson.

In the seventh episode of the NHK puppetry television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, Sherman, a female pupil of Beeton School who can communicate with animals is kidnapped. She is made to interpret dog&#x27;s language to find a bone of Neanderthal stolen from a laboratory and taken away by a dog but no clue is found. Holmes decides to solve the case with the help of his elder brother Mycroft and visits him in the Diogenes Club in Dealer house where he lives. Though Holmes is estranged from Mycroft, the brothers and Watson discover the bone and find out that it&#x27;s Wilson Kemp, a pupil who lives in Dealer house stole it but Mycroft tries to hush up the truth.

===Radio===
A radio adaptation of &quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot;, dramatised by Edith Meiser, aired on 26 January 1931 in the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

Edith Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 15 January 1940. Another episode in the same series that was adapted from the story aired in July 1943.

Michael Hardwick adapted the story as a radio adaptation which aired on the BBC Light Programme in April 1960, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with Jeffrey Segal as Melas and Michael Turner as Inspector Gregson.

&quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 by Gerry Jones as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Peter Polycarpou as Melas and Gordon Reid as the Laughing Man.

The story was adapted as a 2010 episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

<doc id="503948" wikidata="Q131678" url="?curid=503948" title="Elasmotherium">
<text>Elasmotherium is an extinct genus of large rhinoceros that lived in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and East Asia during Late Miocene through to the Late Pleistocene, with the youngest reliable dates of at least 39,000 years ago. It was the last surviving member of Elasmotheriinae, a distinctive group of rhinoceroses separate from the group that contains living rhinoceros (Rhinocerotinae).

Five species are recognised. The genus first appeared in the Late Miocene in present-day China, likely having evolved from &quot;Sinotherium&quot;, before spreading to the Pontic–Caspian steppe, the Caucasus and Central Asia. The best known &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; species, &quot;E. sibiricum&quot;, sometimes called the Siberian unicorn, was among the largest known rhinoceroses, with an estimated body mass of around , comparable to an elephant, and is often conjectured to have borne a single very large horn. However, no horn has ever been found, and other authors have conjectured that the horn was likely much smaller. Like all rhinoceroses, elasmotheres were herbivorous. Unlike any other rhinos and any other ungulates aside from some notoungulates, its high-crowned molars were ever-growing, and it was likely adapted for a grazing diet. Its legs were longer than those of other rhinos and were adapted for galloping, giving it a horse-like gait.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Elasmotherium&quot; was first described in 1808-1809 by German/Russian palaeontologist Gotthelf Fischer von Waldheim based on a left lower jaw, four molars, and the tooth root of the third premolar, which was gifted to Moscow University by princess Ekaterina Dashkova in 1807. He first announced the genus name at an 1808 presentation before the Moscow Society of Naturalists, and named the type species &quot;E. sibiricum&quot; a year later in 1809. The genus name derives from Ancient Greek &quot;elasmos&quot; &quot;laminated&quot; and &quot;therion&quot; &quot;beast&quot; in reference to the laminated folding of the tooth enamel; and the species name &quot;sibericus&quot; is probably a reference to the predominantly Siberian origin of Princess Dashkova&#x27;s collection. However, the specimen&#x27;s exact origins are unknown. In 1877, German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt placed it into the newly erected subfamily Elasmotheriinae, separate from modern rhinos. 

The genus is known from hundreds of find sites, mainly of cranial fragments and teeth, but in some cases nearly complete skeletons of post-cranial bones, scattered over Eurasia from Eastern Europe to China. Dozens of crania have been reconstructed and given archaeological identifiers. The division into species is based mainly on the fine distinctions of the teeth and jaws and the shape of the skull.

===Evolution===
&quot;Elasmotherium&quot; belongs to the subfamily Elasmotheriinae, distinct from the subfamily which includes all living rhinceroses, Rhinocerotinae. The depth of the split between Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotinae is disputed. Older estimates place the age of divergence around 47 million years ago, during the Eocene, while younger estimates place the split around 35 million years ago, during the Oligocene. Unambiguous members of Elasmotheriinae first appeared during the Early Miocene, and were widespread across Europe, Africa and Asia during the Miocene epoch.

&quot;Elasmotherium&quot; is the only known member of Elasmotheriinae from after the Miocene, with elasmotheriines declining as part of a broader decline of rhinocerotids and many other species of mammals during the late Miocene period. The oldest known species of &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; is &quot;Elasmotherium primigenium&quot; from the Late Miocene of Dingbian County in Shaanxi, China. &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; likely evolved from &quot;Sinotherium&quot;, a genus of elasmothere also found in China. &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; arrived in Eastern Europe around 2.5 million years ago, during the earliest part of the Pleistocene epoch.

Hypsodonty, a dentition pattern where the molars have high crowns and the enamel extends below the gum line, is thought to be a characteristic of Elasmotheriinae, perhaps as an adaptation to the heavier grains featured in riparian zones on riversides.

===Species===
There are four chronospecies of &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; aside from the aforementioned &quot;E. primigenium&quot;, which are—from oldest to youngest—&quot;E. chaprovicum&quot;, &quot;E. peii, E. caucasicum&quot; and &quot;E. sibiricum,&quot; and which together span from the Late Pliocene to the Late Pleistocene.
An elasmotherian species turned up in the preceding Khaprovian or Khaprov Faunal Complex, which was at first taken to be &quot;E. caucasicum&quot;, and then on the basis of the dentition was redefined as a new species, &quot;E. chaprovicum&quot; (Shvyreva, 2004), named after the Khaprov Faunal Complex. The Khaprov is in the Middle Villafranchian, MN17, which spans the Piacenzian of the Late Pliocene and the Gelasian of the Early Pleistocene of Northern Caucasus, Moldova and Asia and has been dated to 2.6–2.2 Ma.

&quot;E. peii&quot; was first described by (Chow, 1958) for remains found in Shaanxi, China. The species is also known from numerous remains from the classical range of &quot;Elasmotherium,&quot; and some sources have considered this species to be a synonym of &quot;E. caucasicum&quot;, but it is currently considered distinct. It is mainly found in the Psekups faunal complex between 2.2 and 1.6 Ma, and additional remains from Shaanxi were described in 2018.

&quot;E. caucasicum&quot; was first described by Russian palaeontologist Aleksei Borissiak in 1914, who said it apparently flourished in the Black Sea region as a member of the Early Pleistocene Tamanian Faunal Unit (1.1–0.8 Ma, Taman Peninsula). It is the most commonly found mammal of the assemblage. &quot;E. caucasicum&quot; is thought to be more primitive than &quot;E. sibiricum&quot; and perhaps represents an ancestral stock. It is also known in northern China from the Early Pleistocene Nihewan Faunal assemblage and were extinct at approximately 1.6 Ma. This suggests &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; developed separately in Russia and China.

&quot;E. sibiricum&quot;, described by Johann Fischer von Waldheim in 1808 and chronologically the latest species of the sequence appeared in the Middle Pleistocene, ranging from southwestern Russia to western Siberia and southward into Ukraine and Moldova.

==Description==

&quot;Elasmotherium&quot; is typically reconstructed as a woolly animal, generally based on the woolliness exemplified in contemporary megafauna such as mammoths and the woolly rhino. However, it is sometimes depicted as bare-skinned like modern rhinos. In 1948, Russian palaeontologist Valentin Teryaev suggested it was semi-aquatic with a dome-like horn, and resembled a hippo because the animal had four toes like a wetland tapir rather than the three toes in other rhinos, but &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; has since been shown to have had only three functional toes, and Teryaev&#x27;s reconstruction has not garnered much scientific attention.

The known specimens of &quot;E. sibiricum&quot; reach up to in length, with shoulder heights up to , while &quot;E. caucasicum&quot; reaches at least in body length with an estimated mass of , making &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; the largest rhinos of the Quaternary. Both species were among the largest rhinos, comparable in size to the woolly mammoth and larger than the contemporary woolly rhinoceros. The feet were unguligrade, the front larger than the rear, with three digits at the front and rear, with a vestigial fifth metacarpal.

===Dentition===
Like other rhinos, &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; had two premolars and three molars for chewing, and lacked incisors and canines, relying instead on a prehensile lip to strip food. &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; were euhypsodonts, with large tooth crowns and enamel extending below the gum line, and continuously growing teeth.

&quot;Elasmotherium&quot; fossils rarely show evidence of tooth roots.

===Horn=== 
&quot;Elasmotherium&quot; is traditionally thought to have had a keratinous horn, indicated by a circular dome on the forehead, with a deep, furrowed surface, and a circumference of . The furrows are interpreted as the seats of blood vessels for horn-generating tissue.

In rhinos, the horn is not attached to bone, but grows from the surface of a dense skin tissue, anchoring itself by creating bone irregularities and rugosities. The outermost layer cornifies. As the layers age, the horn loses diameter by degradation of the keratin due to ultraviolet light, drying out, and continual wearing. However, melanin and calcium deposits in the centre harden the keratin there, which gives the horn its distinctive shape.

There was likely a large hump of muscle on the back, which is generally thought to have supported a heavy horn.

A 2021 study found that the cranial dome was quite fragile and ill suited for a large horn and was more indicative of a smaller horn, and that the dome could function as a resonating chamber of some sort, akin to that of &quot;Rusingoryx&quot; and hadrosaur crests.

==Palaeobiology==
===Diet===

Modern hypsodont hoofed mammals are generally grazers of open environments, with hypsodonty possibly an adaptation to chewing tough, fibrous grass. &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; dental wearing is similar to that of the grazing white rhino, and both of their heads have a downward orientation, indicating a similar lifestyle and an ability to only reach low-lying plants. In fact, the head of &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; had the most obtuse angle of any rhinoceros, and could only reach the lowest levels and therefore must have grazed habitually. &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; also displays euhypsodonty (evergrowing teeth), which is typically seen in rodents, and dental physiology could have been influenced by pulling up food from moist, grainy soil. Therefore, they may have inhabited both mammoth steppeland and riparian riversides, similar to contemporary mammoths.

===Movement===
&quot;Elasmotherium&quot; had similar running limbs to the white rhinoceros–which run at with a top speed of . However, &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; had double the weight–about –and consequently had a more restricted gait and mobility, likely achieving much slower speeds. Elephants, weighing , cannot exceed a walking speed of .

===Extinction===
&quot;Elasmotherium&quot; was previously thought to have gone extinct around 200,000 years ago as part of normal extinction, but &quot;E. sibiricum&quot; skull fragments from the Pavlodar Region, Kazakhstan, shows its persistence in the Western Siberian Plain about 39,000–35,000 years ago. Isolated remains dating to 50,000 years ago are known from the Siberian Smelovskaya and Batpak Caves, likely dragged there by a predator.

This timing is roughly coincident with the Pleistocene extinction, during which many mammal species with body weights greater than died out. This coincided with a shift to a cooler climate–which resulted in replacement of grasses and herbs by lichens and mosses–and the migration of modern humans into the area.

<text>Opéra () is a station on Lines 3, 7 and 8 of the Paris Métro. It is named after the nearby Opéra Garnier. Located at the end of the Avenue de l&#x27;Opéra, it serves the district of Boulevard Haussmann. Its main entrances are located on the Place de l&#x27;Opéra, built in a marble design (instead of the characteristic iron metro entrances of Hector Guimard), to not spoil the view of the opera house.

The station is connected by an underground passage to on RER A. From Auber, additional stations and lines can be reached via a sequence of underground passages, namely for Line 3 and Line 9, and for RER E, the latter being connected to Saint-Lazare for Line 3, Line 12, Line 13 and Line 14, and the latter in turn being connected to for Line 9.

==Location==

The station platforms were established under Rue Auber for line 3; under Avenue de l&#x27;Opéra for line 7; and under Boulevard des Capucines for line 8. The platform lie partially under the Place de l&#x27;Opéra.

The three lines cross on the levels at the same point, using a common underground structure located under the square.

==History==
The Line 3 platforms opened on 19 October 1904 as part of the first section of the line opened between Père Lachaise and Villiers. A twenty-one metre high masonry well was built to avoid the need for heavy underpinning work when Line 7 and Line 8 were planned to be built. This work was affected by groundwater, which required the support of three concrete pillars, made by sinking caissons with workers digging out the mud with compressed air. The work lasted eleven months, from March 1903 to February 1904. It owes its name to the Garnier opera house, built by the architect Charles Garnier.

The Line 7 platforms opened on 5 November 1910 as part of the first section of the line opened between Opéra and Porte de la Villette. The Line 8 platforms opened on 13 July 1913 as part of the first section of the line opened between Opéra and Beaugrenelle (now Charles Michels station on Line 10) and then on 30 June 1928 when it was extended to Richelieu - Drouot.

From the 1950s to the 1980s, the walls in line 3 were covered with metal bodywork before their renovation in Andreu-Motte style. The platforms of Lines 7 and 8 were modernised from the early 1970s to 2007 in a unique style with three shades of blue (a dark tone for the Motte style seats and the vault and two others lighter shades for small square tiles). The station&#x27;s name consisted of large raised white capital letters. This decoration, derived from the Mouton-Duvernet style, from which it notably adopted the characteristic lighting canopies, was sometimes nicknamed the &quot;swimming pool&quot;. The blue ceiling was then repainted in white to increase the brightness. The entire layout was removed in 2007 when the station was renovated as part of the RATP &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme. Only the Saint-Lazare station on Lines 12 and 13 had comparable decoration until the mid-2000s.

On 1 April 2016, the RATP replaced one of every two nameplates on the platforms of the three lines to make an April Fool for a day, like twelve other stations. Opera is humorously renamed &quot;Apéro&quot; by anagram.

In 2019, 10,501,357 travellers entered this station which places it at the 15th position of metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three entrances. The two main entrances are on Place de l&#x27;Opéra, and the third is on Place Charles-Garnier leading to the platforms of Line 3. An additional exit from the platforms of Line 7, via escalator, is located at No. 43, Avenue de l&#x27;Opéra.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===

The platforms of the three lines are of standard configuration. Two in number per stopping point, they are separated by the metro tracks located in the centre.

The platform for Line 3 is established flush with the walls. The ceiling consists of a metal roof, whose beams, burgundy in colour, are supported by vertical pillars. The decoration is in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two burgundy light canopies, benches, tunnel exits and walls fitted with large white flat tiles in a stretched sandstone and purple &quot;Motte&quot; seats. On the other hand, the outlets of the corridors are fitted with standard white bevelled tiles. Advertisements are devoid of frames and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates. With Palais Royal - Musée du Louvre on Line 1 and Concorde on line 8, this is one of three stations in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style to be treated in shades of purple, this shade being part of the lexicon exceptional colours for this decoration.

The platforms of Lines 7 and 8 have an elliptical vault and are similarly arranged, with a slight extra curve for Line 7, while the platforms of line 8 have a higher of the vault. The style is that used for most metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; &quot;du renouveau du métro des années 2000&quot; renovation, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls and the tunnel exits. The vault is painted white. The advertising frames are in white ceramic and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The seats are &quot;Akiko&quot; style, green for line 7 and orange for line 8. As part of the treatment for major permeation, the lighting canopies for line 7 is temporarily removed.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 20, 21, 22, 27, 32, 29, 45, 52, 66, 68, 95, and Roissybus of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N15 and N16 of the Noctilien network.

<text>The Generalitat Valenciana is the generic name covering the different self-government institutions under which the Spanish autonomous community of Valencia is politically organized.

It consists of seven institutions including the &quot;Corts Valencianes&quot; (or autonomous Parliament), the President of the Generalitat, or the autonomous government itself (or &quot;Consell&quot;). Its functions are regulated by the Valencian Statute of Autonomy. Despite being also present in various cities of the Valencian Community, the main locations of the autonomous Parliament, presidency of the Generalitat and the &quot;Consell&quot; are all in the city of Valencia. There is also an office in Brussels appointed by the Generalitat Valenciana lobbying before the European Union.

== President of the Generalitat ==
The current President of the Generalitat Valenciana is Carlos Mazón of the People&#x27;s Party of the Valencian Community (People&#x27;s Party). He assumed the Presidency in July 2023 and took office in Les Corts in the same month, as the head of a coalition between the PP and Vox.

== History ==
The Generalitat Valenciana was created in 1418. It acted, along with the Monarch shared with the other territories of the Crown of Aragon, as the ruling body of the Kingdom of Valencia. Originally its posts were designated for three year terms.
In 1510, the process of designating posts was reorganized, becoming more automatic and less elective. This re-organization stayed the same until 1709, when it was abolished as a consequence of the War of the Spanish Succession and the subsequent Nueva Planta decrees, along with the other &quot;fueros&quot; of the Kingdom of Valencia.

The Generalitat Valenciana was not re-established until 1982, after the corresponding Valencian Statute of Autonomy was approved.

== &quot;El Consell&quot; ==

El Consell consists of eight members, each the leader of an institution. These institutions are:
; Education, Culture, and Sports: in charge of education, formal training, universities, sciences, promotion of cultural heritage, language policy, and sports. 
; Treasury and Public Administrations: responsible for finance, the Valencian business sector, public service, and information technology and management communication.

; Health: responsible for health services and public health.

; Planning and Environment: responsible for public works, land and coastline planning, housing and building quality, transportation, ports and airports, environment, landscape, and climate change.

;Social Welfare: responsible for policies affecting social services, dependence, the disabled, family, children, adoptions, youth, women, and immigration.

;Government and Justice: responsible for civil protection, management of the National Police assigned to Valencia, prevention and extinction of fires, management of emergency situations, statutory development, consultations, professional associations, and notarial records.

;Economics, Industry, and Employment: in charge of the economy, business sector, agriculture, industry, craftsmanship, domestic and foreign trade, consumerism, and investigation and innovation of technology and energy.

;Agriculture, Fishing, Food and Water: responsible for establishing and maintaining relations with other countries of the European Union, other Autonomous Communities, local administrations, and citizens.

== Institutions ==
La Generalitat Valenciana comprises seven institutions: 
* &quot;Les Corts&quot;
* &quot;Consell Valencià de Cultura&quot;
* &quot;Comité Econòmic i Social&quot;
* &quot;Sindicatura de Comptes&quot;
* &quot;Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua&quot;
* &quot;Síndic de Greuges&quot;
* &quot;Consell Jurídic Consultiu&quot;

=== &quot;Les Corts Valencianes&quot; ===
The Corts Valencianes is the Valencian Parliament. It represents the people of Valencia via the members of parliament. These members are elected using a universal, direct, free, and secret vote. It is made up of 75-100 members, which are determined by the Statute of Autonomy and through the voting process. The Statute of Autonomy also requires any candidate running for a Seat must &quot;stand for a party or coalition that obtains more than 5% of the given votes in all the Autonomous Community.&quot; The D&#x27;Hondt method is used to distribute Seats. In the VIII Term, 35 members of Parliament were elected in the Alicante district, 24 members in the Castellon district, and 40 in the Valencia district.

The Statute of Autonomy dedicates Chapter II of Title III to the Valencian Parliament, which only outlines the composition of the Parliament, the basic principles of the election system, their corresponding duties, and sets out a general outline of the Statute of the Members of Parliament. The Valencian Parliament Regulations were developed in addition to the Statute of Autonomy to govern the organization and functioning of this Institution. On March 4, 1983, the first draft of the Valencian Parliament Regulations was approved during the Transitional Phase. Since then, it has undergone several modifications, which were approved by the Valencian Parliament on December 18, 2006. The contemporary Corts Valencianes differs from its historical counterpart of the same name. The former Corts Valencianes was organized into three arms – Ecclesiastic, Military, and Royal – which had different duties than the Corts today.

=== &quot;Consell Valencià de Cultura&quot; ===
The &quot;Consell Valencià de Cultura&quot; (Valencian Council of Culture) is a consultation and advisory institution for the Generalitat Valenciana for affairs related to Valencian culture. It defends and promotes the region&#x27;s cultural and linguistic values. The Council&#x27;s headquarters are located in the city of Valencia, but has also held sessions in Valencian municipal centers such as Castelló de la Plana, Alacant, Morella, Elx, and Vilafamés.

=== &quot;Comité Econòmic i Social&quot; ===
The Economic and Social Committee is a body of the government that provides consultations on economic, social, labor, and employment matters. It is also a part of the public institutions of Valencia.

=== &quot;Sindicatura de Comptes&quot; ===
The &quot;Sindicatura de Comptes&quot;, or Audit Office in English, is responsible for the external audit of the economic and financial activity of the public sector in the Valencian Community. This institution of the Generalitat reports to the Corts Valencianes, or Valencian Parliament, but maintains functional independence.

=== &quot;Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua&quot; ===
The &quot;Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua&quot;, or Valencian Academy of Language, was founded in 1998. It is the official governing body over the native language of the region, Valencian. Like the Sindicatura de Comptes, this institution maintains functional independence but works under the Corts Valencianes. The institution&#x27;s purpose is to define and draw up linguistic rules and safeguard the Valencian language on the basis of its lexicographic and literary tradition and its actual linguistic reality, as well as the established Normes de Castelló (Castello Norms) that were approved in 1932.

=== &quot;Síndic de Greuges&quot; ===
The Ombudsman of the Valencian Region was established through Ley 11/1988. This office defend the fundamental rights and public freedoms recognized in the Spanish Constitution and Valencian Statute of Autonomy. The ombudsman is elected for a period of five years and may be re-elected.

=== &quot;Consell Jurídic Consultiu&quot; ===
The Legal Advisory Council of the Valencian government is the supreme branch of the Consell, Regional Administration, and local governments that consults in legal matters.

== Debt of the Generalitat ==
In 2014, the government will try to enforce privatizations to try to stop the debt and balance the debt of the Generalitat. To lower debt, the Consell will sell assets and outsource waste treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, housing, and infrastructure as a means to generate income. The goal is to raise $300 million to address its problems, primarily to pay off the debts of the Generalitat, which is one of the departments that went over budget. The Generalitat is the third department to go over budget, after Sanitation and Education. Money to some departments, such as education, will be reduced. Other departments&#x27; budgets, such as Justice and Social Welfare, will receive a slight increase.

<text>Eduard Dzhabeyevich Kokoyty (; born 31 October 1964) is an Ossetian politician who served as the second president of South Ossetia of the partially recognized state of South Ossetia from 2001 to 2011.

==Early life==

Eduard Kokoyty was born in Tskhinvali, in the Georgian SSR, a part of the Soviet Union at the time. He was a member, and champion, of the Soviet Union&#x27;s national wrestling team. Prior to 1989, he was the First Secretary of the Tskhinvali branch of the Komsomol, the Young Communist League. He moved to Moscow in 1992, where he became a businessman, after learning about capitalism. In 2001, he moved back to South Ossetia.

==2001 presidential election==
Kokoyty was elected president, at the age of 38, with a majority in the presidential elections of November–December 2001. In the first round of the elections on 18 November 2001, he collected 45% of the vote, with Stanislav Kochiev collecting 24%, and incumbent Lyudvig Chibirov collecting 21%. In the Second and final round, he won 53% of the vote to Stanislav Kochiev&#x27;s 40% on 6 December. Kokoyty assumed office on 18 December 2001.

Kokoyty&#x27;s victory was unexpected and owed much to the support of the Tedeyev clan, one of South Ossetia&#x27;s most powerful families. He had gained key support from Albert &quot;Dik&quot; Tedeyev and his brother Dzhambolat, also a champion wrestler, who organized and financed Kokoyty&#x27;s election campaign. The clan had previously supported Lyudvig Chibirov, but broke off support for him after he attempted to move against them. After Kokoyty was elected president, members of the Tedeyev clan took over responsibility for the republic&#x27;s customs service and for freight traffic along the Transcaucasian highway. Revenues from the highway provide much of the South Ossetian government&#x27;s revenue.

In July 2003, Kokoyty moved against the Tedeyevs. Sacking Albert Tedeyev, the Secretary of the Security Council, and ordering their private militias to be disarmed. According to Kokoyty, the Security Council Secretary, along with the Defense and Security Chiefs had links with criminals. The affair prompted an outbreak of gunfire in Tskhinvali, but no casualties were reported.

==President==
Kokoyty has taken a strong position against reunification with Georgia, although he has expressed a willingness to negotiate a peace settlement on the basis of South Ossetia being treated as an independent state (a precondition rejected by the Tbilisi government). Following a tense stand-off with the central Georgian government in July 2004, he claimed &quot;Georgia wants war. But we are ready for self-defense.&quot; Prior to the 2006 presidential elections, he stated that the Georgian-Ossetian conflict was not an inter-ethnic, but clearly a political one caused by Georgia&#x27;s desire to impose on Ossetians the norms of Western democracy which could not be superior to the Caucasian traditional laws. He has also criticized the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe mission in the region on several occasions, accusing the organization of bias and likening its activities to &quot;[those] of Georgia&#x27;s secret services&quot;.

He was reelected on 12 November 2006 following the 2006 presidential election. On the same day, Georgian-backed forces organized an alternative election in the territories controlled by Georgia or only loosely controlled by the South Ossetian government. Dmitry Sanakoyev, a former prime minister of South Ossetia, who was sacked by Kokoyty in 2001, was elected as a rival president.

On 10 December 2011, he resigned as President of South Ossetia. Prime Minister Vadim Brovtsev was acting president until the presidential election rerun on 25 March 2012. Eduard Kokoyty was constitutionally barred from serving a third term in office. Although attempts were made to call a referendum to change the constitution, this was blocked by the Supreme Court. Kokoyty himself stated he had no intention in seeking a third term, and called on everybody to refrain from initiatives to allow him to serve a third term. After multiple elections and several rounds of voting, Leonid Tibilov was elected president 8 April 2012.

===Cabinet===
Following in 2008, Kokoyty broke precedent and sacked almost the entire executive cabinet, except for the Foreign Ministry, the sole holdover.

==Controversy==
On 11 September 2008 Kokoyty stated that independent South Ossetia would eventually become part of the Russian Federation, a claim that was quickly denied by Russian officials and shortly thereafter retracted by Kokoyty. Kokoyty is a Eurasianist and argues that South Ossetia never left the Russian Empire.

Since December 2008, Kokoyty&#x27;s former allies have subjected him to heavy criticism in a series of interviews with the Russian media. Kokoyty&#x27;s erstwhile insider and the Russia-based businessman Albert Dzhussoyev accused the Kokoyty administration of hijacking Russian funds meant for South Ossetia and claimed the region was on the brink of a &quot;social catastrophe&quot;. Similar charges have been brought by South Ossetia&#x27;s former defense minister Anatoly Barankevich and prime minister Yury Morozov. Barankevich further claimed that Kokoyty had fled Tskhinvali during the Russo-Georgian War and accused him of personally torturing a captured Georgian soldier. South Ossetia&#x27;s former interior minister and chair of the supreme court, Alan Parastayev, told the Georgian Imedi TV that Kokoyty had organized a series of terrorist attacks and ordered murders for which he blamed Georgia. Representatives of the Kokoyty administration dismissed the allegations, claiming these allegations were part of a plot against Kokoyty.

On 3 March 2009, the Russian newspaper &quot;Kommersant&quot; reported that Kokoyty&#x27;s administration and the Kremlin were at odds over the control of aid funds allocated from Russia&#x27;s federal budget to South Ossetia and Tskhinvali was at the verge of &quot;social explosion&quot;. In May 2009, Albert Dzhussoyev and Dzhabulat Tadeyev announced they would seek to organize early presidential elections in order to remove Kokoyty whom they accused of authoritarianism, corruption and being &quot;unreliable&quot; for Russia. The first attempt at organizing an Ossetian opposition rally in Moscow was dispersed by the Russian OMON.

In spring 2010, Kokoyty again received much criticism, mostly regarding the use of Russian aid. An opinion poll held by the International Center of Political Analysis (MTsPA) showed an approval rating for Kokoyty of 12.4%, with 66.3% of respondents having a negative opinion. Kosta Dzugaev, an advisor to Kokoyty, immediately blasted the poll as &quot;lies&quot;, claiming the MTsPA had never actually done any research in South Ossetia. The MTsPA has been linked to Prime Minister Vadim Brovtsev, who is himself under attack for mismanaging Russian funds.

<text>Saint-Augustin () is a station on Line 9 of the Paris Métro. Named after Place Saint-Augustin (itself named after Saint-Augustin church), the station opened on 27 May 1923 with the line&#x27;s extension from Trocadéro. It is located in the 8th arrondissement.

==History==
After the extension of Line 14 to Saint-Lazare opened in 2004, the station was connected to Saint-Lazare Métro station (which is near Saint-Lazare railway station) by a long underground passageway. This allows interchange to Line 14 as advertised on RATP maps. There is also connection to Lines 3, 12 and 13 via the Line 14 platforms, but under normal operating conditions these connections are not useful and are not indicated on RATP maps.

==Nearby==
The current Saint-Augustin church, built in 1868 by Baltard, replaced an old chapel which was also dedicated to St Augustine (354–430).

<text>Wāṣil ibn ʿAtāʾ (699–748) () was a Muslim theologian and jurist. He is considered to be the founder of the Mu&#x27;tazilite school of Kalam.

Born in 699 in the Arabian Peninsula, he initially studied under Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, Ali&#x27;s grandson. Later, Wasil would travel to Basra in Iraq to study under Hasan of Basra (one of the tabi&#x27;in). In Basra, he began to develop the ideologies that would lead to the Muʿtazilite school. He married Amr ibn Ubayd&#x27;s sister. 

Wasil&#x27;s thoughts and solutions stem from the conflicts experienced by many scholars in resolving theological and political problems. His main contribution to the Muʿtazilite school was planting the seeds for the formation of its doctrine. He died in 748 in the Arabian Peninsula.

<text>Bourse () is a station on Paris Métro Line 3, located in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris.

==Location==
The station is located under the axis of the Rue Quatre-Septembre and Réaumur, right next to Place de la Bourse. Oriented approximately along an east–west axis, it is located between Quatre-Septembre and Sentier stations.

==History==

It opened on 19 October 1904 as part of the first section of the line opened between Père Lachaise and Villiers. It is named after the nearby Bourse de Paris (stock exchange) of which it provides a service, and at the center of which is built the Palais Brongniart, then known as the Palais de la Bourse because it housed the Paris Stock Exchange at the time. The latter sat there from 1828 to 1998 before being integrated into Euronext.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Metro Renewal&quot; program, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated on 11 July 2003, then the turn of the platforms in 2008.

In 2019, 3,386,481 travelers entered this station which places it at 148th position of metro stations for its usage.

On 9 October 2019, half of the nameplates on the platforms were temporarily replaced by the RATP in order to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Astérix and Obélix, as in eleven other stations. Taking up in particular the typography characteristic of the comics of René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo, the Bourse was humorously renamed &quot;Sesterce&quot;, from the name of the Roman currency in use during the last two centuries of the Roman Republic.

==Passenger services==

===Access===
The station has two adjoining accesses to the Palais Brongniart, whose respective surroundings have the distinction of being integrated into the gates surrounding the latter:
* entrance 1 - &quot;Palais Brongniart&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase lined with an escalator, with an atypical inscription (METROPOLITAIN) above the gates, at the southwest corner of the building;
* entrance 2 - &quot;Rue Notre-Dame-des-Victoires&quot;, with a fixed staircase established on the same street, at the southeast corner of the building.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Bourse is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is that of the style used for most metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style &quot;du renouveau du métro des années 2000&quot; renovation, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault, the tunnel exits, and outlets of the corridors. The advertising frames are in white ceramic and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The seats are in the &quot;Akiko&quot; style in cyan colour.

===Bus services===
The station is served by lines 20, 29, 39, 74 and 85 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N15 and N16 of the Noctilien network.

<text>Sentier () is a station on Line 3 of the Paris Métro in the 2nd arrondissement.

==Location==
The station is located under Rue Réaumur, at the intersection with Rue de Cléry and Rue du Sentier. Oriented, approximately, along an east–west axis, it is located between the Bourse and Réaumur - Sébastopol stations.

==History==

The station opened on 20 November 1904 as part of the first section of the line between Père Lachaise and Villiers, which opened a month earlier. The station is named after a path (French: &quot;Sentier&quot;) leading to the city&#x27;s fortifications, now called the Rue du Sentier, which gave its name to the Sentier district, known until recently for the activities in the textile trades that developed there from the 1950s. The station is one of the few to have its entrance incorporated into the front of a building. A secondary entrance is located 87 Rue Réaumur; it contains railings designed by Hector Guimard and is listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot;.

Since the 1960s, the platforms have been adorned with metallic bodywork with white surrounds; this technique was then widely used in network stopping points as an inexpensive way to modernize them quickly.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated on 16 May 2003.

On 20 March 2018, half of the nameplates on the station&#x27;s platforms are temporarily replaced by the RATP to celebrate the arrival of spring, in parallel with the distribution of flowers to users, as in five other stations. The new plaques represented a wooden sign decorated with plants, on which the station&#x27;s patronym is engraved in capital letters.

In 2019, 3,420,249 travelers entered this station which placed it at the 146th position of the metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two exits leading to Rue Réaumur:
* entrance 1 - &quot;Rue du Sentier&quot;, being among the few in the network to be established in a building, in this case within no. 97 Rue Réaumur, and having a unique signage dating from the 1930s;
* entrance 2 - &quot;Rue des Petits-Carreaux&quot;, adorned with a Guimard edicule which is listed as a historic monument. Located at the right of 87 Rue Réaumur at the end of Rue des Petits-Carreaux.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Sentier is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. Since the 1950s, the walls have been covered with a metallic bodywork with white horizontal uprights and light golden advertising frames. This arrangement is completed by yellow &quot;Motte&quot; style seats. The bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault, and the tunnel exits. Lighting is provided by independent fluorescent tubes and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates incorporated into the bodywork.

===Bus services===
The station is served by lines 20 and 39 of the RATP Bus Network.

<text>The Bloomberg Terminal is a computer software system provided by the financial data vendor Bloomberg L.P. that enables professionals in the financial service sector and other industries to access Bloomberg Professional Services through which users can monitor and analyze real-time financial market data and place trades on the electronic trading platform. It was developed by employees working for businessman Michael Bloomberg. The system also provides news, price quotes, and messaging across its proprietary secure network. It is well known among the financial community for its black interface, which has become a recognizable trait of the service. The first version of the terminal was released in December 1982.

Most large financial firms have subscriptions to Bloomberg Professional Services. Many exchanges charge their own additional fees for access to real time price feeds across the terminal. The same applies to various news organizations.

All Bloomberg Terminals are leased in two-year cycles (in the late 1990s and early 2000s, three-year contracts were an option), with leases originally based on how many displays were connected to each terminal (this predated the move to Windows-based application). Most Bloomberg setups have between two and six displays. As a data analytics and electronic trading platform, the Bloomberg terminal is available for an annual fee of around $24k per user or $27k per year for subscribers that use only one terminal. As of 2022, there were 325,000 Bloomberg Terminal subscribers worldwide.

== History ==
In 1981, Michael Bloomberg was fired from Salomon Brothers. He was given no severance package, but owned $10 million worth of equity as a partner at the firm. Using this money, Bloomberg, having designed in-house computerized financial systems for Salomon, set up a data services company named Innovative Market Systems (IMS) based on his belief that Wall Street would pay a premium for high-quality business information, delivered instantly on computer terminals in a variety of usable formats. The company sold customized computer terminals that delivered real-time market data, financial calculations and other analytics to Wall Street firms. At first, the machine was called the Market Master terminal, but later became known as the Bloomberg Terminal or simply &quot;The Bloomberg.&quot; The terminal was released to market in December 1982. Merrill Lynch became the company&#x27;s first customer, purchasing a 30% stake in IMS for $30 million in exchange for a five-year restriction on marketing the terminals to Merrill Lynch&#x27;s competitors. In 1984, Merrill Lynch released IMS from the restriction.

In 1990, the Bloomberg keyboard was released with a trackball and built-in voice-chat features. In 1991, the first color edition of the terminal was released.

Michael Bloomberg stepped away from working on the terminal in 2001 to run for New York City mayor, but returned to lead the project in 2014. Starting in 2012, Bloomberg Terminal had a greater annual revenue than Thomson Reuters, the company that founded the market data business.

Currently, the hardware aspect of the terminal is only a series of accessories. Some of those accessories are a custom keyboard with special keys, a fingerprint scanner, and a dual-screen display.

== Pricing ==
Sales from the Bloomberg terminal account for more than 85 percent of Bloomberg L.P.&#x27;s annual revenue. The financial data vendor&#x27;s proprietary computer system starts at $30,000 per user per year.

== Architecture ==
The terminal implements a client-server architecture with the server running on a multiprocessor Unix platform. The client, used by end users to interact with the system, is a Windows application that typically connects directly through a router provided by Bloomberg and installed on-site. End users can also make use of an extra service (&quot;Bloomberg Anywhere&quot;) to allow the Windows application to connect via internet/IP, or Web access via a Citrix client. There are also applications that allow mobile access via Android and iOS. The server side of the terminal was originally developed using mostly the programming languages Fortran and C. Recent years have seen a transition towards C++ and embedded JavaScript on the clients and servers.

Each server machine runs multiple instances of the server process. Using a proprietary form of context-switching, the servers keep track of the state of each end user, allowing consecutive interactions from a single user to be handled by different server processes. The graphical user interface (GUI) code is also proprietary.

== Keyboard ==

Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s 1997 autobiography contains a chapter entitled &quot;Computers for Virgins&quot;, which explains the differences in the design of the terminal and its keyboard from the standard IBM PC keyboard layout that was popular at that time. The terminal&#x27;s keyboard layout was designed for traders and market makers who had no prior computer experience. The look and feel of the Bloomberg keyboard are similar to an ordinary computer keyboard, with several enhancements which help users navigate through the system.

Keyboard keys are commonly referred to inside angle brackets with full commands being contained in curly brackets  e.g., {VOD LN }. The function key names and then-standard beige colour of an ordinary keyboard were changed from the technical name, e.g., F10, to a memorable name and colour, e.g., &quot;Yellow&quot;. The F10 key is thus a &quot;Yellow&quot; key named . The is coloured red and named in the Bloomberg system, with the red to catch one&#x27;s eye to stop a task. The key is referred to as with a green color, deriving from the &quot;Monopoly&quot; game board, by passing &quot;Go&quot; and collecting $200 in a hope that the user could make money on the information he would find.

The Bloomberg keyboard includes a unique key which navigates back to the previous function used. If no previous commands are found, displays a list of related functions. Similarly, the key will populate the command-line with previously used functions in reverse chronological order, as the key function does in certain command prompts.

The yellow hotkeys along the top of the keyboard are used to enter market sectors, and are generally used as suffixes to allow the terminal to correctly identify a security.

* F2 GOVT – government securities (U.S. treasury and non-U.S.)
* F3 CORP – corporate debt
* F4 MTGE – mortgage securities
* F5 M-Mkt – money market
* F6 MUNI – municipal debt
* F7 PFD – preferred shares
* F8 EQUITY – equity shares
* F9 COMDTY – commodity markets
* F10 INDEX – indices
* F11 CURNCY – currency markets
* F12 CLIENT/ALPHA – portfolio functionality

For example, if someone is interested in the Vodafone stock listed in the London market, one enters {VOD LN } where VOD is the company&#x27;s ticker symbol, LN is the venue code for London, and is the market sector. A detailed option list related to Vodafone UK stock will pop up, the person can then choose different options by pressing related keys or using the mouse to select the option.

Similarly, {USDEUR } displays the U.S. dollar–Euro exchange spot rate.

Other common Bloomberg commands for Equity include:

* {HP } – Historical Price – Display the detailed historical price of the currently loaded stock
* {DVD } – Dividend / Split Summary of the currently loaded stock
* {CACS } – Corporate Actions related to the currently loaded stock
* {CN } – Company News – News related to the currently loaded stock

Thus, if someone interested in the historical Vodafone UK stock price, they can directly type in {VOD LN HP }.

The Bloomberg keyboard has traditionally been heavier and sturdier than standard keyboards (a previous version, the SEA100 Bloomberg keyboard weighed around 3 kg) with 3mm key travel and 19mm key pitch; it also comes with built-in speakers for multimedia features. The SEA100 version has a built-in, 500 PPI, 0.26 sq inch biometric sensor for user login verification. The current Starboard (Keyboard 4) version is 1.08 kg and uses flatter, chiclet-style keys which are quieter and have less key travel than Freeboard (Keyboard 3) and prior.
== Terminal and related products ==
Originally a self-contained operating system running on custom hardware commonly referred to as a &quot;Bloomberg Box&quot;, the Bloomberg Terminal now functions as an application within the Windows environment. From a user&#x27;s perspective, there are essentially three distinct levels to the system:

=== Core Terminal ===
&quot;Core Terminal&quot; is the original Bloomberg system; typically consisting of four windows, or &quot;Panels&quot;, each Panel contains a separate instance of the terminal command line. As the user enters tickers and functions, they can call up and display the real-time data of the market, with each different screen simultaneously running a program to analyze other tickers, functions, values and markets in real time. This use of multiple screens with user-demanded, specific pieces of differing data—across all relevant markets—allows the user to view diverse and countless volumes of information in real-time. Accessing market data, as it develops, allows the user to make trades and investments in all markets across the world, without having any lag in information. Users can run all four windows on a single monitor or spread them out amongst many monitors, maximizing the information shown on each, to effectually create up to four terminals.

In February 2012, Bloomberg LP publicly announced an upgrade to the Terminal called &quot;Bloomberg NEXT&quot;. The stated goals of this multi-year, $100 million project were to improve the discoverability and usability of the Core Terminal&#x27;s functionality.

=== Launchpad ===
Launchpad is a customizable display consisting of a number of smaller windows, called &quot;components&quot;, each dedicated to permanently displaying one set of data. A typical user would be a stockbroker who wishes to keep a list of 30 stocks visible at all times: Launchpad allows the user to create a small component which will show these prices constantly, saving the user from having to check each stock independently in the 4 terminal windows. To turn on Launchpad the command {BLP } is used, {PDFB } allows users to set Lpad to open automatically on login. Older keyboards had an &lt;Lpad&gt; key which replicated the {BLP } command. Other functions, such as email inboxes, calculation tools and news tickers can be similarly displayed. The Instant Bloomberg messaging/chat tool is a Launchpad component, as are the chat windows it creates. To launch a normal function from the Bloomberg Terminal&#x27;s 4 Screens into launchpad type {LLP} from the target screen you wish to turn into a launchpad item.

=== Application programming interface ===
The Bloomberg Open API (BLPAPI) application programming interface (API) allows third-party applications, such as Microsoft Excel, to access Bloomberg data via the Terminal and Bloomberg&#x27;s market data products. A user might wish to use Bloomberg data from the Terminal to create their own calculations; by accessing streaming, historical, and reference market data from another program, they can build these formulae. The Bloomberg Terminal installation ships with Excel add-ins which facilitate building spreadsheets which consume market data. In addition, Bloomberg offers free BLPAPI SDKs allowing Bloomberg subscribers to build their own software which accesses market data in Wolfram Language, C, C++, Java, .NET, Perl, and Python, on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Solaris.

=== Financial Instrument Global Identifier ===
In September 2021, Bloomberg earned regulatory approval for its Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI), a 12-character alphanumerical, open standard, unique identifier for financial instruments that may be attached to common equities, options, derivatives, futures, corporate bonds, sovereign bonds, municipal bonds, currencies, and mortgage products. This was previously known as the Bloomberg Global Identifier and was introduced in 2009. Once issued, a FIGI number is never reused. There are unique FIGIs that identify securities as well as the individual exchanges on which they trade. There are also composite FIGIs that may be used to represent unique securities across related exchanges, although unique FIGIs would be used to identify common stock on an individual exchange. The FIGI structure is defined and copyrighted by the Object Management Group. Unique FIGIs are published by Bloomberg L.P. It&#x27;s a competitor to the CUSIP.

=== Legal Entity Identifiers ===
In April 2022, Bloomberg released the Common Data Format 3.1 for Legal Entity Identifiers and received accreditation as an LEI issuer for funds, a move which would allow firms to better understand their exposure to different types of legal entities and meet regulatory requirements. Like the FIGI, the LEI is managed under the Open Symbology unit of Bloomberg.

== Competitors ==

The largest competitor to the Bloomberg Terminal is Refinitiv with its Eikon offering, formerly owned by Thomson Reuters. Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters split the market with a share of 30% each in 2011. This was a major improvement for Bloomberg as the share in 2007 was Bloomberg&#x27;s 26% to Reuters&#x27; 36%.

Other major competitors include Money.Net, SIX Financial Information, Markit, FactSet Research Systems, Capital IQ, Fidessa and Dow Jones. According to Burton-Taylor International Consulting, the market for financial data and analytics was worth almost $25 billion .

<text>Xining is the capital and most populous city of Qinghai province in western China and the largest city on the Tibetan Plateau. As of the 2020 census, it had 2,467,965 inhabitants (2,208,708 as of 2010), of whom 1,954,795 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of 5 urban districts. The city lies in the Huangshui River Valley, also known as Tsongkha (Tibetan: ཙོང་ཁ་), and owing to its high altitude, has a cool climate on the borderline between cool semi-arid and dry winter humid continental.

Xining was a commercial hub along the Northern Silk Road&#x27;s Hexi Corridor for over 2000 years, and was a stronghold of the Han, Sui, Tang, and Song dynasties&#x27; resistance against nomadic attacks from the west. Although long a part of Gansu province, Xining was added to Qinghai in 1928. Xining holds sites of religious significance to Muslims and Buddhists, including the Dongguan Mosque and Kumbum Monastery. It is connected by the Qinghai–Tibet railway to Lhasa, Tibet and connected by a high-speed railway to Lanzhou, Gansu and Ürümqi, Xinjiang.

The city is home to Qinghai University, a comprehensive university and the only Double First-Class University in Xining.

== History ==
Xining has a history of over 2,100 years and was a chief commercial hub on the Hexi Corridor caravan route to Tibet, handling especially timber, wool and salt in ancient times. The trade along the Hexi Corridor was part of a larger trade corridor along the Northern Silk Road, whose use was intensified in the 1st century BC after efforts by the Han dynasty to control this route.

Under the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), a county called Linqiang was established to control the local Qiang tribesmen. It was again a frontier county under the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) dynasties; during the 7th and early 8th centuries it was a center of constant warfare with Tuyuhun and Tibet. In 763, it was overrun by the Tibetans and while under Tibetan control was known to the Chinese as &quot;Qingtang cheng&quot; (). Recovered by the Song dynasty in 1104, it received the name Xining (meaning &quot;peace in the west&quot;) and has been the seat of a prefecture or superior prefecture under that name since that time. The founder of Gelug Tsongkhapa (Tibetan: ཙོང་ཁ་པ་, meaning: &quot;the man from Tsongkha&quot;. c. 1357–1419) was born in the 14th century, and on the site of his birthplace the Kumbum Monastery was founded in the late 16th century, establishing Xining as an important religious center for the Gelug School of Buddhists.

A major earthquake occurred May 22, 1927, measuring at a magnitude of 7.6. It was one of the deadliest earthquakes in China with a total count of over 40,000 deaths. It also caused large land fractures.

Xining was the extraterritorial capital of the Koko Nor territory and remained in Gansu until 1928, when it became the provincial capital of the newly established independent province of Qinghai.

Xining was subjected to aerial bombardment by Japanese warplanes in 1941 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The bombing spurred all ethnicities in Qinghai, including the local Qinghai Mongols and Qinghai Tibetans, against the Japanese. The Salar Muslim General Han Youwen directed the defense of the city of Xining during air raids by Japanese planes.

Xining was given municipal status in 1945.

Under the rule of Governor Ma Bufang, Xining, like the rest of Qinghai, underwent industrialization and modernization. In 1947 the USA sold Ma Bufang a piped water (sewage) system which was installed in Xining. Ma Bufang also promoted education. He made businessmen methodically clean up Xining by serving as insect exterminators.

Since the late 1950s, when the Liujiaxia Dam and hydroelectric project came into operation in neighboring Gansu province, Xining has been linked by a high-tension electrical grid to both Liujia and Lanzhou. It also uses local coal from mines at Datong County to the north. A modern woollen mill was installed at Xining before 1957. The city also has a leather industry and is a market for salt from the Qaidam region. During the late 1950s medium-sized iron and steelworks were built there, supplying metal to Lanzhou.

Construction of a highway to the mineral-rich Qaidam basin, and completion in 1959 a link to the Chinese rail network via Lanzhou in Gansu province, has spurred industrial development. This effort was part of a plan of the central government to rapidly exploit oil and pasturage in the Xining area beginning in the 1950s.

== Geography and climate ==
Xining is located in the eastern part of Qinghai Province and lies on the Huangshui River. The four urban districts have a total area of .

Xining is located on the eastern edge of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau and the upper reaches of the Huangshui River. It is the political, economic, and cultural center of Qinghai Province with an average altitude of about . Human activity in the region can be traced to 2,100 years ago. During the Western and Eastern Han dynasties, owing to its developing agriculture, Xining was paid notice due to its economic and military significance. As well as being an important hinge between the Central Plains and the western part of China in ancient times, Xining was an important link in the Silk Road. It continues to be an important rail and road link to the hinterlands of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau.

Xining has also been dubbed the Summer Resort Capital of China owing to its cool summer, with a borderline cold semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;)/dry winter humid continental climate (&quot;Dwb&quot;). Conditions are influenced by the aridity and high altitude. Nights are cold or cool throughout the year, and the diurnal temperature variation often reaches or exceeds . The monthly 24-hour average temperatures ranges from in January to in July; the annual mean is , still making it one of the warmest locations in Qinghai due to the low elevation by provincial standards. Rainfall falls mainly from May to September, and the area is often dry and sunny: with monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 49 percent in September to 67 percent in November, the city receives 2,540 hours of bright sunshine per year. Extreme temperatures have ranged from to . Snow cover is very sparse due to the dry winters.


===River management===
In 2007, the World Bank lent US$1 billion to aid river treatment in Xining, including Sanxian County&#x27;s anti-flooding project, with an added US$1 billion to support infrastructure. Qinghai has invested large amounts in the treatment of Huangshui Main River and Nanchuan River, totalling . However, a treatment on a river course and 10 flash flood relief channels remain pending due to lack of equipment. In Sanxian County, a long river course and 80 flash flood relief channels need treatment.

===Air quality===
According to a 2011 World Health Organization (based on Chinese statistics), Xining has the second worst air quality (annual mean PM10 ug/m3 of 141) among eleven western China cities, and is worse than Beijing (121).

== Economy ==

The GDP per capita was 49,200 RMB (US$7,897) in 2015. Its main industries are wool spinning and textiles, fur, meat, milk, salt, and light processing industries.

===Economic and Technological Development Zones===
* Xining Economic &amp; Technological Development Zone
Xining Economic &amp; Technological Development Zone XETDZ) was approved as state-level development zone in July 2000. It has a planned area of . XETDZ lies in the east of Xining, away from downtown. The XETDZ is the first of its kind at the national level on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is established to fulfill the nation&#x27;s strategy of developing the west.

XETDZ enjoys a convenient transportation system, connected by the Xining–Lanzhou expressway and run through by two main roads, the broadest roads of the city. It is away from the railway station, from Xining Airport.

It focuses on the development of following industries: chemicals based on salt lake resources, nonferrous metals, and petroleum and natural gas processing; special medicine, foods and bio-chemicals using local plateau animals and plants; new products involving ecological and environmental protection, high technology, new materials as well as information technology; and services such as logistics, banking, real estate, tourism, hotel, catering, agency and international trade.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2020 Chinese census, the prefecture-level city of Xining has a population of 2,467,965 inhabitants (compared to 2,208,708 as of the 2010 Chinese census), of whom 1,954,795 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of 5 urban districts.

At present, four districts, three counties and a national economic and technological development zone are under the administration of the local government. With a population of more than two million, Xining is the first city on the upper reaches of the Yellow River to achieve a population in the millions.

=== Ethnic diversity ===
There are about 37 nationalities living here, though only the Han, Hui, Monguor/Tu and Tibetans are numerically significant. Local traditions and customs are influenced by the Tibetans, Monguor, Muslims and Han. In the 2010 Census numbers, Han Chinese represent 74.04 percent of the total population of Xining, while Hui (16.26 percent), Tibetan (5.51 percent) and Tu (2.6 percent) are the main minority groups in the city.

==Transportation==

Xining is situated in a fertile mountain basin in the valley of the Huangshui (river), a tributary of the Yellow River, that acts as a river port. The city lies about west of Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, on what was traditionally the main trade route from northern China into Tibet and the Qaidam Basin. These routes are now followed by modern highways.

===Railway===

Since 1959 Xining station has been connected by the Lanzhou–Qinghai Railway to China&#x27;s railway network. Later, this railway was extended into the Qaidam area via Haiyan near Qinghai Lake to Golmud, and, since 2006, to Lhasa, Tibet. (See the Qinghai–Tibet Railway).

The second major railway serving Xining is the Lanzhou–Xinjiang High-Speed Railway, opened in December 2014. When first opened, it just provided high-speed train service to Lanzhou and Urumqi (and points in between). With the opening of the Baoji–Lanzhou high-speed railway on July 9, 2017, it has been connected to the rest of the nation&#x27;s high-speed rail network.

Unlike many other Chinese cities, where the conventional and high-speed trains stop at different train stations, Xining railway station is served by both types of trains. Thus it can be used as a transfer point for e.g. a passenger traveling from Xinjiang to Tibet.

===Air===
Xining Caojiapu International Airport serves the area with regularly scheduled passenger flights to major Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Chengdu, Kunming, Xi&#x27;an, and Wuhan.

===Highway===
* China National Highway 214
*China National Highway 227
*China National Highway 315
*G6 Beijing–Lhasa Expressway

== Food ==

Xining&#x27;s cuisine is distinct from other Chinese cities and mainly uses food products native to the area.

Local specialties include: Feng&#x27;er Liji (a round lamb tenderloin), Danbai Chongcao Ji (a medicine cuisine made of chicken, Chinese caterpillar fungus and eggs), and Jinyu Facai (pork wrapped in flagelliform nostoc and shaped as a goldfish).

There are also many small restaurants offering noodles. Gan Ban is a very common noodle dish. Perhaps Mian Pian, which means &quot;noodle leaves&quot; is the most common noodle plate among the Qinghai people. On the streets, many Muslims sell spicy lamb brochettes. Due to the cold climate, residents of Xining are also fond of strong spirits; Xining has the reputation of being one of the regions of heaviest alcohol consumption in China.

<text>Abū Jaʿfar Hārūn ibn [[al-Mu&#x27;tasim|Muḥammad]] al-Wathiq bi&#x27;Llah (; 18 April 81210 August 847), commonly known by his regnal name al-Wathiq bi&#x27;Llah (), was an Abbasid caliph who reigned from 842 until his death in 847.

Al-Wathiq is described in the sources as well-educated, intellectually curious, but also a poet, who enjoyed the company of poets and musicians as well as scholars. His brief reign was one of continuity with the policies of his father, al-Mu&#x27;tasim (), as power continued to rest in the hands of the same officials whom al-Mu&#x27;tasim had appointed. The chief events of the reign were the suppression of revolts: Bedouin rebellions occurred in Syria in 842, the Hejaz in 845, and the Yamama in 846, Armenia had to be pacified over several years, and above all, an abortive uprising took place in Baghdad itself in 846, under Ahmad ibn Nasr al-Khuza&#x27;i. The latter was linked to al-Wathiq&#x27;s continued support for the doctrine of Mu&#x27;tazilism, and his reactivation of the to root out opponents. In foreign affairs, the perennial conflict with the Byzantine Empire continued, and the Abbasids even scored a significant victory at Mauropotamos, but after a prisoner exchange in 845, warfare ceased for several years.

Al-Wathiq&#x27;s character is relatively obscure compared to other early Abbasid caliphs. He appears to have been a sedentary ruler occupied with the luxuries of the court, a capable poet, and a patron of poets and musicians, as well as showing interest in scholarly pursuits. Al-Wathiq&#x27;s unexpected death left the succession unsettled. Al-Wathiq&#x27;s son al-Muhtadi was passed over due to his youth, and his half-brother al-Mutawakkil () was chosen as the next caliph by a coterie of leading officials.

==Early life==
Al-Wathiq was born on 18 April 812 (various sources give slightly earlier or later dates in 811–813), on the road to Mecca. His father was the Abbasid prince, and later caliph, al-Mu&#x27;tasim (), and his mother a Byzantine Greek slave (), Qaratis. He was named Harun after his grandfather, Caliph Harun al-Rashid (), and had the teknonym Abu Ja&#x27;far.

The early life of al-Wathiq is obscure, all the more since his father was initially a junior prince without prospects of succession, who owed his rise to prominence, and eventually to the caliphate, to his control of an elite private army of Turkic slave troops (). Harun ibn Ziyad is mentioned as his first teacher, and he learned calligraphy, recitation and literature from his uncle, Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun (). Later sources nickname him the &quot;Little Ma&#x27;mun&quot; on account of his erudition and moral character.

When al-Mu&#x27;tasim became caliph, he took care for al-Wathiq, as his son and heir-apparent, to acquire experience in governance. Thus al-Wathiq was left in charge of the capital Baghdad in 835, when al-Mu&#x27;tasim moved north to found a new capital at Samarra. He is then mentioned in the account of al-Tabari as being sent to ceremonially welcome the general al-Afshin during his victorious return from the suppression of the revolt of Babak Khorramdin in 838 (in present-day Iran), and being left behind as his father&#x27;s deputy during the Amorion campaign of the same year.

Al-Wathiq is then mentioned in 841 as bringing a bowl of fruit to al-Afshin, now disgraced and imprisoned. Fearing that the fruit was poisoned, al-Afshin refused to accept it, and asked for someone else to convey a message to the Caliph. In Samarra, al-Wathiq&#x27;s residence was immediately adjacent to his father&#x27;s palace, and he was a fixed presence at court. As historian John Turner remarks, these reports show al-Wathiq in the &quot;role of a trusted agent of his father, which positioned him well to take over the reins of power&quot;. On the other hand, al-Wathiq was never given a military command and did not even participate in the Amorion campaign, in a departure from previous Abbasid practice.

==Reign==
Al-Tabari records that al-Wathiq was of medium height, handsome and well-built. He was fair with a ruddy complexion, commonly associated with noble descent. His left eye was paralyzed with a white fleck, which reportedly lent his gaze a stern aspect. When al-Mu&#x27;tasim died on 5 January 842, al-Wathiq succeeded him without opposition. Inheriting a full treasury, the new caliph made generous donations to the common people, especially in Baghdad and the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Al-Wathiq sent his mother, Qaratis, accompanied by his brother Ja&#x27;far (the future caliph al-Mutawakkil), to head the pilgrimage in 842. Qaratis died on the way at al-Hirah on 16 August 842, and was buried in Kufa.

===Ruling elites===
Al-Wathiq&#x27;s reign was short and is generally considered to have been essentially a continuation of al-Mu&#x27;tasim&#x27;s own, as the government continued to be led by men that had been raised to power by al-Mu&#x27;tasim: the Turkic military commanders Itakh, Wasif, and Ashinas, the vizier, Muhammad ibn al-Zayyat, and the chief (judge), Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad. These men had been personally loyal to al-Mu&#x27;tasim, but were not similarly bound to al-Wathiq; in practice, according to Turner, this narrow circle &quot;controlled the levers of power and thus the Caliph&#x27;s independence&quot;.

In a gesture likely aimed at cementing an alliance between the caliph and his most powerful commander, al-Wathiq bestowed a crown on Ashinas in June/July 843, and on the occasion invested him with sweeping authority over the western provinces, from Samarra to the Maghreb—an act which the 15th-century Egyptian scholar al-Suyuti considered as the first occasion when royal power () was delegated by a caliph to a subject. Ashinas died in 844, and Itakh succeeded him in his rank as commander-in-chief and in his over-governorship of the western provinces. The new caliph also engaged in much construction in Samarra, which went a long way towards making the caliphal residence a proper city, with markets and a port adequate to its needs. This made Samarra not only more comfortable for its inhabitants but also made investment in property there economically attractive—both major considerations for the Abbasid elites and the military, who had been forced to relocate to the new capital by al-Mu&#x27;tasim.

However, in 843/44, the Caliph—allegedly at the instigation of the vizier Ibn al-Zayyat, or, according to a story reported by al-Tabari, inspired by the downfall of the Barmakids under Harun al-Rashid—arrested, tortured, and imposed heavy fines on several of the secretaries in the central government, in an effort to raise money to pay the Turkic troops. The measure was at the same time possibly aimed at driving a wedge between civilian and military elites, or at reducing the power of the leading Turkic commanders, such as Itakh and Ashinas, since most of the secretaries arrested and forced to pay were in their service.

===Suppression of rebellions===

Already during the last months of al-Mu&#x27;tasim&#x27;s life, a large-scale revolt had erupted in Palestine under a certain al-Mubarqa. Al-Mu&#x27;tasim sent the general Raja ibn Ayyub al-Hidari to confront the rebels. When al-Wathiq came to power, he dispatched al-Hidari against Ibn Bayhas, who led a Qaysi tribal revolt around Damascus. The exact relationship of this uprising with the revolt of al-Mubarqa is unclear. Taking advantage of the dissensions among the tribesmen, al-Hidari quickly defeated Ibn Bayhas, and then turned south and confronted al-Mubarqa&#x27;s forces near Ramla. The battle was a decisive victory for the government army, with al-Mubarqa taken prisoner and brought to Samarra, where he was thrown into prison and never heard of again.

Upon coming to the throne, al-Wathiq appointed Khalid ibn Yazid al-Shaybani as governor of the restive province of Armenia. At the head of a large army, Khalid defeated the opposition of the local Muslim and Christian princes at the Battle of Kawakert. Khalid died soon after, but his son, Muhammad al-Shaybani, succeeded him in office and continued his father&#x27;s task.

In spring 845, another tribal rebellion broke out. A local tribe, the Banu Sulaym, had become embroiled in a conflict with the tribes of Banu Kinanah and Bahilah around Medina, resulting in bloody clashes in February/March 845. The local governor, Salih ibn Ali, sent an army against them comprising regular troops as well as citizens of Medina, but, the Sulaym were victorious and proceeded to loot the environs of the two holy cities. As a result, in May al-Wathiq charged one of his Turkic generals, Bugha al-Kabir, to handle the affair. Accompanied by professional troops from the , Turkic, and guard regiments, Bugha defeated the Sulaym and forced them to surrender. In early autumn, he also forced the Banu Hilal to submit. Bugha&#x27;s troops took many prisoners, some 1,300 in total who were held in Medina. They tried to escape, but were thwarted by the Medinese, and most were killed in the process. In the meantime, Bugha used the opportunity to intimidate the other Bedouin tribes of the region, and marched to confront the Banu Fazara and the Banu Murra. The tribes fled before his advance, with many submitting, and others fleeing to al-Balqa. Bugha then subdued the Banu Kilab, taking some 1,300 of them as prisoners back to Medina in May 846.

A minor Kharijite uprising in 845/6 occurred in Diyar Rabi&#x27;a under a certain Muhammad ibn Abdallah al-Tha&#x27;labi (or Muhammad ibn Amr), but was easily suppressed by the governor of Mosul. In the same year, the general Wasif suppressed restive Kurdish tribes in Isfahan, Jibal and Fars.

In September 846, al-Wathiq sent Bugha al-Kabir to stop the depredations of the Banu Numayr in Yamamah. On 4 February 847, Bugha fought a major engagement against about 3,000 Numayris at the watering place of Batn al-Sirr. At first he was hard pressed, and his forces almost disintegrated. Then some troops he had out raiding the Numayris&#x27; horses returned, fell upon the forces attacking Bugha and completely routed them. According to one report, up to 1,500 Numayris were killed. Bugha spent a few months pacifying the region, issuing writs of safe-passage to those who submitted and pursuing the rest, before he returned to Basra in June/July 847. Over 2,200 Bedouin from various tribes were brought captive with him.

===Mu&#x27;tazilism and the abortive coup of al-Khuza&#x27;i===

Like his father, al-Wathiq was an ardent Mu&#x27;tazilite—the sources agree that he was strongly influenced by the chief , Ibn Abi Duwad—but also, like his father, maintained good relations with the Alids. In the third year of his caliphate, al-Wathiq revived the inquisition (), sending officials to question jurists on their views on the controversial topic of the createdness of the Quran. Al-Wathiq supported the Mu&#x27;tazili view that the Quran was created and not eternal, and hence fell within the authority of a God-guided imam (i.e., the caliph) to interpret according to the changing circumstances. Even during a prisoner exchange held with the Byzantine Empire in 845, the ransomed Muslim prisoners were questioned on their opinions regarding the topic, with those giving unsatisfactory answers reportedly left to remain in captivity. Thus Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbali school of jurisprudence, who opposed the Mu&#x27;tazili doctrine, was forced to cease his teachings and only resumed them after al-Wathiq&#x27;s death.

In 846, a well-respected notable, Ahmad ibn Nasr ibn Malik al-Khuza&#x27;i, a descendant of one of the original missionaries of the Abbasid Revolution, launched a plot in Baghdad to overthrow al-Wathiq, his Turkic commanders, and the Mu&#x27;tazilite doctrines. His followers distributed money to the people, and the date for the uprising was scheduled for the night of 4/5 April 846. However, according to al-Tabari, those who were supposed to sound a drum as the signal to rise got drunk and did so a day early, and there was no response. Khatib al-Baghdadi on the other hand reports simply that an informer gave the plot away to the authorities. The deputy governor of the city, Muhammad ibn Ibrahim—the governor, his brother Ishaq, was absent—inquired on the event, and the conspiracy was revealed. Al-Khuza&#x27;i and his followers were arrested and brought before al-Wathiq at Samarra.

The Caliph interrogated al-Khuza&#x27;i publicly, though more on the thorny theological issue of the createdness of the Quran rather than on the actual rebellion. Ahmad&#x27;s answers enraged al-Wathiq so much, that the Caliph took al-Samsamah, a famous sword of the pre-Islamic period, and personally joined in the execution of Ahmad, along with the Turks Bugha al-Sharabi and Sima al-Dimashqi. Ahmad&#x27;s corpse was publicly displayed next to the gibbet of Babak in Baghdad, while twenty of his followers were thrown into prison.

The same year there was a break-in at the public treasury () in Samarra. Thieves made off with 42,000 silver dirhams and a small amount of gold dinars. The (chief of security), Yazid al-Huwani, a deputy of Itakh, pursued and caught them. Turner points out that this episode may provide some premonition of the crisis to erupt in later decades: security even at the main palace was lax, and, based on the thieves&#x27; loot, the treasury appears to have been almost empty at the time.

===War with the Byzantine Empire===

In 838 al-Mu&#x27;tasim had scored a major victory against the Abbasid Caliphate&#x27;s perennial foe, the Byzantine Empire, with the celebrated sack of Amorion. This success was not followed up, and warfare reverted to the usual raids and counter-raids along the border. According to Byzantine sources, at the time of his death in 842, al-Mu&#x27;tasim was preparing yet another large-scale invasion, but the great fleet he had prepared to assault Constantinople perished in a storm off Cape Chelidonia a few months later. This event is not reported in Muslim sources.

Following al-Mu&#x27;tasim&#x27;s death, the Byzantine regent Theoktistos attempted to reconquer the Emirate of Crete, an Abbasid vassal, but the campaign ended in disaster. In 844, an army from the border emirates of Qaliqala and Tarsus, led by Abu Sa&#x27;id, and possibly the emir of Malatya Umar al-Aqta, raided deep into Byzantine Asia Minor and reached as far as the shore of the Bosporus. The Muslims then defeated Theoktistos at the Battle of Mauropotamos, aided by the defection of senior Byzantine officers. At around the same time, the Paulicians, a sect persecuted as heretical in Byzantium, defected to the Arabs under their leader Karbeas. They founded a small principality on the Abbasid–Byzantine frontier, centred on the fortress of Tephrike, and henceforth joined the Arabs in their attacks on Byzantine territory.

In 845, a Byzantine embassy arrived at the caliphal court to negotiate about a prisoner exchange. It was held in September of the same year under the auspices of Yazaman al-Khadim, and somewhere between 3,500 and 4,600 Muslims were ransomed. In March of the same year, however, 42 officers taken captive at Amorion were executed at Samarra, after refusing to convert to Islam. After the truce arranged for the exchange expired, the Abbasid governor of Tarsus, Ahmad ibn Sa&#x27;id ibn Salm, led a winter raid with 7,000 men. It failed disastrously, with 500 men dying of cold or drowning, and 200 taken prisoner. After this, the Arab-Byzantine frontier remained quiet for six years. Only in the west did the Abbasids&#x27; Aghlabid clients continue their gradual conquest of Byzantine Sicily, capturing Messina (842/43), Modica (845), and Leontini (846). In 845/46, the Aghlabids captured Miseno near Naples in mainland Italy, and in the next year their ships appeared in the Tiber River and their crews raided the environs of Rome.

==Death and succession==

Al-Wathiq died as the result of edema, likely from liver damage or diabetes, while being seated in an oven in an attempt to cure it, on 10 August 847. His age is variously given as 32, 34, or 36 Islamic years at the time. He was buried in the Haruni Palace in Samarra, that he had built.

His death was unexpected, and left the succession open—although the near-contemporary historian al-Ya&#x27;qubi at least claims that an heir had been named, and the oath of allegiance given to him. Consequently, the leading officials, the vizier, Ibn al-Zayyat, the chief , Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad, the Turkic generals Itakh and Wasif, and a few others, assembled to determine his successor. Ibn al-Zayyat initially proposed al-Wathiq&#x27;s son Muhammad (the future caliph al-Muhtadi), but due to his youth he was passed over, and instead the council chose al-Wathiq&#x27;s 26-year-old half-brother Ja&#x27;far, who became the caliph al-Mutawakkil.

This selection is commonly considered by historians to have been in effect a conspiracy to place a weak and pliable ruler on the throne, while the same cabal of officials would run affairs as under al-Wathiq. They would be quickly proven wrong, for al-Mutawakkil quickly moved to eliminate Ibn al-Zayyat and Itakh and consolidate his own authority.

==Assessment and legacy==
Al-Wathiq is reported as having been generous to the poor of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and to have reduced taxes on maritime commerce, but he does not appear to have enjoyed any great popularity. What is told of his character shows him being a mild-mannered person, given to indolence and the pleasures of court life, to the point of becoming inebriated and falling asleep. He was an accomplished poet—more poems of his survive than of any other Abbasid caliph—as well as a skilled composer, and could play the oud well. He was also a patron of poets, singers and musicians, inviting them to the palace. He showed particular favour to the musician Ishaq al-Mawsili, the singer Mukhariq, and the poet al-Dahhak al-Bahili, known as ().

In contrast to this picture, the 10th-century historian al-Mas&#x27;udi portrays al-Wathiq as &quot;interested in scientific learning and facilitating disputations among physicians&quot;. The Graeco-Arabic translation movement continued to flourish under his reign, and the sources also relate some episodes that show al-Wathiq&#x27;s own &quot;intellectual curiosity&quot;, especially as related to issues that could burnish his religious credentials: he reportedly dreamed that the &quot;Barrier of Dhu&#x27;l-Qarnayn&quot; had been breached—probably resulting from news of the movements of the Kirghiz Turks at the time that caused large population shifts among the Turkic nomads of Central Asia—and sent the chancery official Sallam al-Tarjuman to journey to the region and investigate. Likewise, according to Ibn Khordadbeh, the Caliph sent the astronomer al-Khwarizmi to the Byzantines to investigate the legend of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus.

Al-Wathiq is one of the more obscure Abbasid caliphs. According to the historian Hugh Kennedy, &quot;no other caliph of the period has left so little trace of the history of his times, and it is impossible to form any clear impression of his personality&quot;, while the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; writes that &quot;he had not the gifts of a great ruler, and his brief reign was not distinguished by remarkable events&quot;. His very obscurity allowed William Beckford to present a heavily fictionalized version of al-Wathiq in his classic 18th-century Gothic fantasy novel &quot;Vathek&quot;, which Kennedy describes as &quot;a fantastic tale of cruelty, dissipation and a search for the lost treasure of ancient kings, guarded by Iblis/Satan himself&quot;.

==Family==
One of al-Wathiq&#x27;s concubines was Qurb, a Greek. In 833 she gave birth to al-Wathiq&#x27;s son, Muhammad, the future caliph al-Muhtadi. Another concubine was Farida, who was also a musician and al-Wathiq&#x27;s favourite. When al-Wathiq died, the singer Amr ibn Banah presented her to Caliph al-Mutawakkil. He married her, and she became one of his favourites. He had another concubine, who was a servant of Farida. Al-Wathiq was infatuated with her. Another concubine was Qalam. She belonged to Salih bin Abdul al-Wahhab, who had trained her as a singer. Al-Wathiq bought her for 5000 dinars and called her Ightibat (&quot;delight&quot;).

<doc id="503970" wikidata="Q266495" url="?curid=503970" title="Olaf I of Denmark">
<text>Olaf I (; – 18 August 1095), nicknamed Olaf Hunger, was king of Denmark from 1086 to 1095, following the death of his brother Canute IV the Holy. He was a son of king Sweyn II Estridsson, and the third of Sweyn&#x27;s sons to rule. He married Ingegard, the daughter of Harald Hardråde, but did not have any sons. He was succeeded by his brother Eric the Good.

==Biography==
Olaf was born around 1050, to king Sweyn II Estridsson and an unknown concubine. During the reign of his elder brother Canute IV, Olaf supposedly served as Duke of Schleswig. In 1085, Olaf was called to a &quot;leding&quot; campaign against England. Canute was held up and could not join the &quot;leding&quot;, and as the navy grew weary in waiting for him, Olaf became the spokesperson for its concerns. Canute feared Olaf&#x27;s support among the magnates, while Olaf had misgivings about Canute&#x27;s dynastic ambition, and saw Canute&#x27;s son Charles the Good as a potential rival for power. Canute blamed Olaf for stirring up trouble, and Olaf was put in chains by their brother Eric, the later king Eric I Evergood. Olaf was banished to Flanders, under the supervision of Robert I of Flanders.

===King of Denmark===
Canute was killed in St. Alban&#x27;s Priory in Odense in July 1086, following a rebellion in Northern Jutland. Olaf was proclaimed king at the Viborg &quot;landsting&quot; assembly, though he was still in Flanders. An arrangement was made to swap Olaf for his younger brother Niels, the later king Niels of Denmark, to permit Olaf to return to Denmark. Upon the return of Oluf, Eric fled to Scania. Olaf was the third of Sweyn&#x27;s sons to become king of Denmark.

Olaf&#x27;s reign was plagued by several consecutive years of crop failure and famine. According to Arild Hvitfeldt&#x27;s &quot;Danmarks Riges Krønike&quot;, in those years springtime was so dry that the fields looked as if they had been burned, and in the fall the skies opened up and rain fell so often that people floated about on pieces of wood to cut the heads off the grain that rose above the water. The hunger of the people grew so great that they dug the earth looking for roots. The wealthy grew thin, and the poor died of starvation. Sickness and starvation soon visited great and small. In the first early attempts of getting Canute canonized, Olaf was given the nickname &quot;Hunger&quot; in order to magnify the splendor of Canute. At the time it was claimed that the famine was sent by God as divine punishment for the sacrilegious killing of Canute. Chronicler Saxo Grammaticus described the hunger as a strictly Danish phenomenon, though it has later been described as a general problem of Europe in those years.

Oluf probably cut the Danish ties to the Papal Gregorian reform movement, supporting Antipope Wibert of Ravenna instead. During Olaf&#x27;s reign, some of Canute&#x27;s laws were repealed, and the power of the clergy and royalty receded in favour of the magnates. When Skjalm Hvide sought the support of Olaf in avenging the death of his brother by campaigning against the Wends, Olaf could not muster the power to help him. The magnates became more involved in the works of the Church, and Jutlandish magnate Asser Svendsen was appointed Archbishop of Lund by Olaf in 1089.

===Death===
Olaf died on 18 August 1095 under mysterious circumstances. Some speculate that he may have killed himself or that he was sacrificed on behalf of his luckless people. Saxo Grammaticus writes that he &quot;willingly gave himself to lose the land of its bad luck and begged that all of it (guilt) would fall upon his head alone. So offered he his life for his countrymen.&quot; It has been postulated that his body was divided among the regions of Denmark as a kind of scapegoat which was to take away the blood guilt of Denmark and restore it to its previous fortunes. He was succeeded by his brother Eric I Evergood.

<text>Eric I ( – 10 July 1103), also known as Eric the Good (), was King of Denmark following his brother Olaf I Hunger in 1095. He was a son of Sweyn II. His mother&#x27;s identity remains unknown. He married Boedil Thurgotsdatter.

==Biography==

Eric was born in the town of Slangerup in North Zealand - the largest Danish island. During the rule of his half-brother Canute IV he was an eager supporter of the king, but he was spared during the rebellion against Canute. Eric remained at the royal farm instead of accompanying Canute to St Albans priory in Odense, where Canute was killed. Eric talked his way off the farm and fled to Zealand and then to Scania, which was part of Denmark during that time. Olaf I Hunger was elected King of Denmark, but his reign was short. At last Eric was elected as a king at the several &quot;landsting&quot; assemblies in 1095. Eric was well liked by the people and the famines that had plagued Denmark during Olaf Hunger&#x27;s reign ceased. For many it seemed a sign from God that Eric was the right king for Denmark.

Medieval chroniclers, such as Saxo Grammaticus, and myths portrayed Eric a “strapping fellow” appealing to the common people. He could keep his place when four men tried their best to move him. Eric was a good speaker, and people went out of their way to hear him. After a &quot;ting&quot; assembly concluded, he went about the neighborhood greeting men, women and children at their homesteads. He had a reputation as a loud man who liked parties and who led a rather dissolute private life. Though a presumed supporter of a strong centralized royal power, he seems to have behaved like a diplomat, avoiding any clash with the magnates. He had a reputation for being ruthless to robbers and pirates.

On a visit to the Pope in Rome he obtained canonization for his late brother, Canute IV, and an archbishopric for Denmark (now Lund in Scania), instead of being under the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen. Bishop Asser then became the first Archbishop of Lund.

King Eric announced at the Viborg assembly that he had decided to go on pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The cause, according to &quot;Danmarks Riges Krønike&quot;, was while drunk at a feast in his own hall. Despite the pleas of his subjects, he would not be deterred. Eric appointed his son, Harald Kesja, and Bishop Asser as regents.

Eric and Boedil and a large company traveled through Russia to Constantinople where he was a guest of the emperor. While there, he became ill, but took ship for Cyprus anyway. He died at Paphos, Cyprus in July 1103. The queen had him buried there. He was the first king to go on pilgrimage after Jerusalem was conquered during the First Crusade. Queen Boedil also became ill, but made it to Jerusalem where she died. She was buried at the foot of the Mount of Olives in the Valley of Josaphat.

==Family==
Eric and Boedil had one legitimate son, Canute Lavard. Harald Kesja was Canute&#x27;s half-brother. Eric had two sons outside marriage—Eric II the Memorable and Benedict—and one daughter, Ragnhilde (mother of the future king Eric III Lamb).

Canute Lavard, king Eric&#x27;s legitimate son, was a chivalrous and popular Danish prince. Canute was murdered 7 January 1131 by Eric&#x27;s nephew Magnus the Strong, the son of King Niels, who viewed Canute as a likely competitor for the throne. Canute&#x27;s death occurred days before the birth of his child, Valdemar, who would become King of Denmark from 1157(54) to 1182. Eric Ejegod is the ancestor of later Danish monarchs.

<text>Niels ( – 25 June 1134) was the King of Denmark from 1104 to 1134. Niels succeeded his brother Eric Evergood and is presumed to have been the youngest son of King Sweyn II Estridson. King Niels actively supported the canonization of Canute IV the Holy and supported his son Magnus after he killed his rival for the succession, Knud Lavard. His secular rule was supported by the clergy. Niels was killed in an ensuing civil war and succeeded by Eric II Emune.

==Early life==
Niels was born around 1063, married in 1105, and died in 1134. His parents were King Sweyn II Estridson and an unknown concubine. Four of Niels&#x27; brothers ascended the throne before him. He is first mentioned in history in 1086 when he was sent to Flanders to take the place of his exiled brother, King Olaf I. When his brother Eric Evergood died in July 1103 during a pilgrimage, Niels, who was the last surviving brother, was elected king the following year ahead of Evergood&#x27;s chosen deputy Harald Kesja. He married Margaret Fredkulla, the daughter of Inge I of Sweden. She was believed to have wielded considerable influence during his reign.

==Policies and patronage==
During the majority of Niels&#x27; reign, the country had internal peace. The contemporary &quot;Chronicon Roskildense&quot; describes him as mild and forthcoming, though not a competent ruler. He carried through reforms of his personal &quot;hird&quot; retinue, separating it into a military and an administrative branch responsible for tax collection. He placed family members as his &quot;jarls&quot;, including his son-in-law Jarl Ubbe and his nephews Eric (Emune) and Canute Lavard, who were the sons of Eric Evergood. Niels supported the canonization of his brother Canute IV the Holy by bestowing gifts on the clergy of Odense as he sought to enlarge the power and influence of the monarchy through the aid of the church. However, it is likely he did not win the full support of the magnates on Zealand. He also campaigned against the Wends in alliance with Poland. According to Saxo Grammaticus, Niels&#x27; son Magnus was elected King of Geats in 1220s.

==Civil war==
His wife, Margaret, died in 1128 or 1129, and his son, Magnus, was forced from the Swedish throne in 1130. After 26 years of internal peace, conflict erupted between Magnus and his cousin Canute Lavard. Canute was popular in the Duchy of Schleswig where he was &quot;jarl&quot; and was seen as a potential successor to Niels. On 7 January 1131, Magnus slew Canute near Haraldsted just north of Ringsted. Niels initially condemned Magnus but eventually supported him, and a civil war ensued between Niels and the supporters of Canute&#x27;s half-brother, Eric (Emune). Niels had his strongest base of support in Jutland, and the church also supported him. He secured support from the Holy Roman Empire by agreeing to subordinate the Danish Archdiocese of Lund in Scania to the German Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen, which prompted Archbishop Asser of Lund to support Eric.

Eric made little progress in Denmark and moved on to the battle for Scania in 1134. Niels and Magnus landed at Fotevik Bay in Scania in June 1134 seeking to deal Eric a decisive defeat. At the Battle of Fotevik on 4 June 1134, Niels and Magnus were taken by surprise by a contingent of German soldiers on horses. Niels escaped, while Magnus was slain. Niels sought refuge with Holy Roman Emperor Lothar III of Germany, but did not make it past the city of Schleswig. Niels ventured into the former city of Canute Lavard on 25 June 1134, despite warnings. &quot;Should I fear tanners and shoemakers?,&quot; he supposedly remarked. He was greeted by the clergy, but he and his vanguard were slain before they could reach the royal palace as the townspeople turned against him. The almost sixty-year reign of Sweyn II Estridson&#x27;s sons ended when Niels fell and Eric II Emune became king.

==Issue==
Niels married Margaret Fredkulla, daughter of king Inge I of Sweden. After Margaret&#x27;s death in either 1128 or 1129, he married Ulvhild Håkansdotter, who had been married to Inge II of Sweden and later married Sverker I of Sweden. Niels had two children with Margaret, and one child out of wedlock.

# Magnus Nielsen
# Ingerid of Denmark was born out of wedlock, and eventually went on to marry Jarl Ubbe Esbernsen, a descendant of Canute the Great.

<text>Tracy Lamar McGrady Jr. (born May 24, 1979), nicknamed T-Mac, is an American former professional basketball player, best known for his career in the National Basketball Association (NBA). McGrady is a seven-time NBA All-Star, seven-time All-NBA selection, two-time NBA scoring champion, and winner of the NBA Most Improved Player Award in 2001. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2017. McGrady is regarded as one of the greatest scorers and shooting guards in NBA history.

McGrady entered the NBA straight out of high school and was selected as the ninth overall pick by the Toronto Raptors in the 1997 NBA draft. Beginning his career as a low-minute player, he gradually improved his role with the team, eventually forming a duo with his cousin Vince Carter. In 2000, he left the Raptors for the Orlando Magic, where he became one of the league&#x27;s most prolific scorers and a candidate for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award. In 2004, he was traded to the Houston Rockets, where he paired with center Yao Ming to help the Rockets become a perennial playoff team. His final seasons in the NBA were plagued by injuries, and he retired in 2013 following a brief stint with the Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and the San Antonio Spurs.

Since retiring, McGrady has worked as a basketball analyst for ESPN. From April to July 2014, he realized his dream of playing professional baseball, pitching for the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.

==Early life==

McGrady was born on May 24, 1979, in Bartow, Florida, to Melanise Williford. Because his father was not a part of their everyday lives, Melanise raised McGrady with the help of her mother, Roberta, in Auburndale. As a youth, McGrady played high school basketball and baseball at Auburndale High School for three years before transferring to Mount Zion Christian Academy in Durham, North Carolina for his senior season. During his final year at Auburndale, McGrady posted averages of 23.1 points, 12.2 rebounds, 4 assists, and 4.9 blocks per game.

A relatively unknown player coming out of Florida, McGrady made a name for himself after a strong performance at the Adidas ABCD Camp, an experience that helped him recognize his true talent. He later reflected, &quot;Nobody had a clue who Tracy McGrady was. Sonny Vaccaro gave me that platform, and I played against the best players in the world at that time. I left that camp the No. 1 player in the nation, 175 to No. 1.&quot; Behind his leadership, Mt. Zion emerged as the number two-ranked team in the country, and McGrady was named a McDonald&#x27;s All-American, &quot;USA Today&quot; High School Basketball Player of the Year, and North Carolina&#x27;s Mr. Basketball by the Associated Press. He also played at the 1997 Roundball Classic, scoring 13 points. His senior year averages were 27.5 points, 8.7 rebounds, 7.7 assists, 2.8 steals, and 2 blocks per game. Initially, McGrady considered playing college basketball at the University of Kentucky, but he ultimately decided to enter the NBA draft as he was a projected lottery pick.

==Professional career==

===Toronto Raptors (1997–2000)===
McGrady was selected as the ninth overall pick by the Toronto Raptors in the 1997 NBA draft. For most of the 1997–98 season, he received little playing time, averaging only 13 minutes per game under head coach Darrell Walker. McGrady has described his rookie year as &quot;hell&quot;, feeling lonely in Toronto and sleeping for up to 20 hours a day. Late in the season, Walker resigned, and McGrady began playing more under new coach Butch Carter, who agreed to increase McGrady&#x27;s minutes on the condition that McGrady would improve his work ethic.

Before the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Raptors drafted McGrady&#x27;s second cousin once removed, Vince Carter. The two became inseparable; teammate Dee Brown once said, &quot;They say they&#x27;re cousins ... But Siamese twins is more like it.&quot;

By the 1999–2000 season, the duo had developed a reputation for their athleticism, giving memorable performances at the All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest. McGrady, now playing significant minutes, was a contender for the Sixth Man of the Year Award before being elevated to Toronto&#x27;s starting backcourt in late March. On April 4, in what would be one of his last regular season games in Toronto, McGrady scored a tenure-high 28 points in a loss against the Pistons. Behind McGrady and Carter&#x27;s play, the Raptors finished the season with a 45–37 record, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. McGrady&#x27;s final averages were 15.4 points, 6.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists, and a career-high 1.9 blocks per game. In the first round of the postseason, the Raptors were swept by the New York Knicks.

===Orlando Magic (2000–2004)===

==== 2000–01 season: First All-Star and Most Improved Player ====
Following Toronto&#x27;s first-round exit, McGrady became a free agent and signed with the Orlando Magic on August 3, 2000, through a sign-and-trade deal that sent a future 2005 1st round draft pick (Fran Vázquez was later selected) to the Raptors. He signed a seven-year, $92.8 million contract with the Magic. He elected to join the Magic in part because he disliked his secondary role playing behind Vince Carter, in part so that he could return home to Florida, and in part to play with their other newly acquired free agent, Grant Hill. Hill would go on to play in only 47 games total throughout his tenure with the team, forcing McGrady into a more significant leadership and scoring role than anticipated.

During the 2000–01 season, McGrady defied the expectations of many, emerging as one of the best players in the NBA, with Milwaukee Bucks General Manager Ernie Grunfeld going so far as to call him &quot;one of the top five talents in the league&quot;. McGrady&#x27;s play earned him his first All-Star Game appearance and, behind averages of 26.8 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game, he was selected to his first All-NBA Team, being named to the All-NBA Second Team. He was also voted the league&#x27;s Most Improved Player. With a 43–39 record, the Magic entered the playoffs as the East&#x27;s seventh seed, drawing a matchup with the Bucks. In Game 3 of the series, McGrady notched 42 points, 10 rebounds, and 8 assists in a performance that Bill Simmons later called McGrady&#x27;s &quot;superstar audition tape&quot;. Orlando was eventually eliminated by Milwaukee in four games.

==== 2001–02 season: First All-NBA First Team selection ====
For the 2001–02 season, McGrady averaged 25.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game, earning his second All-NBA Team selection, this time to the All-NBA First Team. During that year&#x27;s All-Star Game, he completed one of the most memorable highlights of his career, throwing the ball off the backboard to himself and completing an alley-oop in traffic. Reflecting on the play, McGrady later recounted, &quot;There was only one guy back there ... and he bit on the lob ... I guess he thought I was throwing it to one of my teammates, and I just threw it down.&quot; At season&#x27;s end, the Magic were again ousted in the first round of the playoffs, losing in four games to the Charlotte Hornets. On March 8, 2002, in one of the best games of his career, McGrady scored a season high 50 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a 99–96 win over the Washington Wizards.

==== 2002–03 season: First scoring title and playoff disappointment ====
In 2002–03, McGrady won his first scoring title and, behind averages of 32.1 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game, finished a career-best fourth in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting. ESPN later ranked his season one of the best ever for a perimeter player. In Game 1 of the playoffs, he scored a team playoff record 43 points to help Orlando take an early series lead against the top-seeded Detroit Pistons. The Magic would go on to take a commanding 3–1 lead, and McGrady made headlines when he prematurely assumed that Orlando were guaranteed to advance, replying in an interview, &quot;It feels good to get in the second round.&quot; In that year, the first round of the NBA playoffs was changed to a best-of-seven series from a best-of-five. Despite holding the series lead, the Magic were eliminated in seven games.

==== 2003–04 season: Second scoring title and missing playoffs ====
The 2003–04 season was a tumultuous one for McGrady; Magic coach Doc Rivers was fired after a 1–10 start to the year and there were reports of friction between McGrady and Orlando General Manager John Weisbrod. Throughout the season, Orlando struggled because of a series of injuries, finishing the year with the worst record in the East despite McGrady winning his second consecutive scoring title. Late in the season, McGrady scored a career-high 62 points in a winning effort versus the Washington Wizards. His final averages were 28 points, 6 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game.

===Houston Rockets (2004–2010)===

==== 2004–05 season: 13 points in 35 seconds ====

On June 29, 2004, McGrady, Juwan Howard, Tyronn Lue, and Reece Gaines were traded to the Houston Rockets as part of a seven-player deal that sent Steve Francis, Cuttino Mobley, and Kelvin Cato to the Magic. In response to the trade, McGrady stated that he was happy with the situation and expressed excitement over the prospect of playing alongside Rocket All-Star center Yao Ming. Shortly after arriving in Houston, McGrady signed a three-year, $63 million contract extension with the team.

The Rockets struggled to begin the 2004–05 season, posting a losing record of 16–17 through their first 33 games. On December 9, McGrady had one of the most memorable performances of his career, scoring 13 points in the final 35 seconds against the San Antonio Spurs including a last-second three-pointer to secure a comeback victory. The sequence included four consecutive three-pointers, one of which was part of a four-point play and the last of which was a game-winner in the final two seconds. After the All-Star break, Houston rebounded from their slow start, finishing the season with 51 wins and the fifth-best record in the West. McGrady&#x27;s final averages were 25.7 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 5.7 assists per game. In Game 2 of the first round of the postseason, he had another signature performance, completing a &quot;thunderous&quot; dunk over 7&#x27;6&quot; Dallas Mavericks center Shawn Bradley and hitting a game-winner for a 113–111 victory. The series would go to a decisive Game 7, where McGrady came out cold, missing his first seven shots en route to a 40-point loss.

==== 2005–06 season: Injury and missing playoffs ====
The 2005–06 season was a disappointing one for the Rockets, as McGrady appeared in only 47 games due to injury. At various points during the year, he missed time due to back spasms, including a moment in January where he had to be carried off the court in a stretcher due to a severe flare up. Despite his health concerns, McGrady was able to play in that year&#x27;s All-Star Game in front of his home crowd in Houston, exploding for 36 points in just 27 minutes. For the season, he averaged 24.4 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. Due in part to his frequent absences, the Rockets failed to qualify for the playoffs.

==== 2006–07 season: Playoff upset ====
Early in the 2006–07 season, McGrady missed seven games, again because of back spasms, eventually deciding to visit a doctor and receive treatment for the injury as he felt that it was affecting his speed and explosiveness. His health issues and the ascension of Yao Ming, who was having a breakout season, resulted in McGrady temporarily becoming the team&#x27;s second scoring option. His final averages were 24.6 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 6.5 assists per game. To open the playoffs, the Rockets were matched up the Utah Jazz. By this time, pressure had started to mount on McGrady to lead the team deep into the postseason, to which he responded, &quot;If we don&#x27;t get out of the first round, it&#x27;s on me!&quot; Houston would eventually lose the series in seven games, and at his postgame press conference following the Game 7 defeat, McGrady, still visibly emotional from the loss, said &quot;I tried, man, I tried.&quot;

==== 2007–08 season: 22-game winning streak====
In 2007–08, the Rockets went on a 22-game winning streak, which was the then-second longest in NBA history, despite missing Yao Ming during that stretch. During their run, McGrady expressed optimism over the team&#x27;s roster, admitting, &quot;I haven&#x27;t had this kind of trust in my teammates before.&quot; Houston finished the season as the West&#x27;s fifth seed, earning them a rematch with the Jazz in the first round. By the time the playoffs arrived, McGrady was nursing shoulder and knee injuries, at times requiring him to receive pain-killing injections and have fluid drained from both his shoulder and knee in order for him to be able to play. The Jazz again eliminated the Rockets, this time in six games, despite a strong 40-point and 10-rebound performance from McGrady in the decisive Game 6.

==== 2008–09 season: Season-ending surgery ====
Following Houston&#x27;s loss to Utah, McGrady underwent arthroscopic surgery on both his left shoulder and left knee. Early in the 2008–09 season, he missed 18 games, including a two-week stretch in January as his knee was not fully healed from his offseason surgery. On February 24, he had microfracture surgery in Chicago, forcing him to miss the remainder of the year. By then, his averages had declined to 15.6 points and 4.4 rebounds per game. In a surprise turn of events, the Rockets qualified for the playoffs without McGrady and advanced to the second round, pushing the eventual-champion Los Angeles Lakers to seven games.

==== 2009–10 season: Final season in Houston ====
McGrady was still recovering from surgery to begin the 2009–10 campaign. On December 15, he returned to action but was limited to only seven minutes off the bench. After six games, the Rockets decided to shut him down again so that they could focus on trading him to another team.

=== New York Knicks (2010) ===

On February 18, 2010, McGrady was traded to the New York Knicks as part of a three-team trade involving Houston, New York, and Sacramento. Two days later, he made his team debut, scoring 26 points in an overtime loss against the Thunder. He would finish the season with averages of 9.4 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 3.7 assists in 26.1 minutes per game. McGrady only appeared in 24 games for the Knicks.

=== Detroit Pistons (2010–2011) ===
A free agent for the first time in ten years, McGrady met with and worked out for the Los Angeles Clippers and Chicago Bulls. Bulls second-year guard Derrick Rose publicly supported the idea of McGrady coming to Chicago. McGrady would end up signing a one-year contract with the Detroit Pistons.

On January 14, 2011, McGrady scored a season high 22 points and recorded 5 assists in a 101–95 victory over the Raptors. Two weeks later, on January 28, McGrady scored 14 points, recorded 10 assists, grabbed 8 rebounds, and blocked 4 shots in an 88–87 loss to the Heat. He averaged 8 points per game for the 2010–11 season.

=== Atlanta Hawks (2011–2012) ===
Following the 2011 NBA lockout, McGrady signed a one-year deal with the Atlanta Hawks. In the lockout-shortened 66 game season, McGrady played 52 games, and for the first time in his career did not start any of them.

On January 2, 2012, McGrady had a memorable performance against the then-undefeated &quot;Big Three&quot; Miami Heat (who went on to win the NBA Finals that year) with a 13-point fourth quarter to bring Atlanta back to win the game. Battling injuries through the year, he averaged a career-low 5.3 points per game.

=== Qingdao Eagles (2012–2013) ===
On October 9, 2012, McGrady signed a one-year deal with the Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles of the Chinese Basketball Association. Qingdao finished the season in last place, with McGrady averaging 25 points, 7.2 rebounds, 5.1 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.

=== San Antonio Spurs (2013) ===
On April 16, 2013, shortly after the conclusion of the CBA campaign, McGrady signed with the San Antonio Spurs in time for him to qualify for their playoff roster. The Spurs eventually advanced to the 2013 NBA Finals, losing in seven games to the Miami Heat, which provided McGrady with the opportunity to play his first career postseason minutes outside of the first round.

On August 26, McGrady officially announced his retirement from the NBA on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;First Take&quot;.

==National team career==

McGrady was selected to the United States men&#x27;s national basketball team for the FIBA Americas Championship 2003 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On August 22, McGrady led the Americans with 16 points in a 98–69 victory over Venezuela. McGrady sat out the August 26 game due to a back injury. The U.S. qualified for the 2004 Olympic Games on August 30 with an 87–71 win over Puerto Rico; in the game, McGrady and Puerto Rico&#x27;s Eddie Casiano were involved in an altercation which resulted in fans throwing drinks and debris on the court. Ultimately, the U.S. advanced to the gold medal game, defeating Argentina to finish a perfect 10–0. For the tournament, McGrady averaged 12.6 points and 2.9 rebounds a game on 54.4 percent from the field and 42.1 percent three-point shooting.

== Professional baseball career ==
On February 4, 2014, McGrady confirmed that he was officially pursuing his dream of becoming a professional baseball player, working with Roger Clemens to become a pitcher for the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. On April 23, McGrady made the Skeeters&#x27; Opening Day roster. In his debut, he pitched innings, receiving the loss. In July, he started the Atlantic League All-Star Game, where he recorded his first strikeout. After the game, McGrady announced his retirement from baseball.

==Player profile==

Standing 6 feet 8 inches tall (2.03 m) and weighing 210 pounds (95 kg), McGrady played as a shooting guard and small forward. His career averages were 19.6 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 4.4 assists per game. McGrady earned seven All-NBA honors (2001–05, 2007–08), seven All-Star selections (2001–07), two NBA scoring titles (2003–04), and won the NBA Most Improved Player Award in 2001. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2017.

McGrady was known for his laid-back demeanor and scoring prowess; he once scored 41 points in a game despite being asleep right until tip-off, a performance that inspired the nickname &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;. Many of his contemporaries, including Paul Pierce and Kobe Bryant, have called him one of the most difficult players that they ever had to guard. McGrady&#x27;s playing style has been compared to George Gervin&#x27;s because both players made scoring appear easy with their &quot;smooth&quot; approach to the game. At his peak, McGrady was an explosive player capable of finishing at the rim over the defense; in a piece for ESPN, Zach Lowe reminisced, &quot;He glided through the lane, crouched into traffic, and accelerated suddenly -- almost violently -- through a forest of slower-moving forms, and to the rim.&quot; McGrady was also a threat from outside, and would frequently pull up for deep three-pointers over unsuspecting defenders. Some analysts have remarked that McGrady&#x27;s length, playmaking, and shooting abilities would have made him more effective in the modern era of basketball, and that he was ahead of his time. On the defensive side of the ball, McGrady&#x27;s effort was less consistent, but he demonstrated the ability to raise his level in meaningful games, such as during the playoffs against the Mavericks, where he often drew the assignment of guarding Dirk Nowitzki.

During his time as an All-Star, McGrady was frequently criticized for not having led any team beyond the first round of the playoffs. Some analysts have defended McGrady, feeling that he was the victim of bad rosters and unfortunate circumstances. His effort level, leadership, and toughness were also questioned at times. In response to these criticisms, former Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy described McGrady as a poor practice player but praised his coachability, unselfishness, and ability to perform well in big games.

McGrady is often ranked as one of the greatest basketball players of all-time; &quot;The Book of Basketball&quot; ranked him 77th, ESPN ranked him 63rd, and &quot;SLAM Magazine&quot; ranked him 97th. In 2016, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; listed McGrady as one of the 20 best basketball players since the announcement of the original 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996. In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named McGrady as the 55th greatest player in NBA history.

==Personal life==

McGrady has three children with his wife, CleRenda Harris. Their first son, Laymen Lamar, was born on December 27, 2005, during a home game in Houston, which McGrady left at halftime. Tracy&#x27;s younger brother, Chancellor &quot;Chance&quot; McGrady, played for the 2008 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament runner-up Memphis Tigers.

McGrady is also the second cousin once removed of basketball player Vince Carter through Carter&#x27;s step-great-grandfather; the two therefore are not related by blood. They were teammates with the Raptors in 1998–2000. Both players were unaware of the relation until a family reunion in 1997. After McGrady left the Raptors, they had a feud, but it was resolved in a short period of time.

In 2002, McGrady signed a longterm partnership with Adidas, agreeing to an endorsement deal that lasted through his playing career and beyond. Adidas produced a signature line of shoes for McGrady that &quot;Complex&quot; remembered as &quot;all the buzz in the early-mid 2000s&quot;. Upon retiring, McGrady shifted his focus to his business investments, including Dasdak, a Washington, D.C.–based technology company, and Blue-04, a bottled water company in Florida. He was also an initial investor in a Minor League Baseball team which would become the Biloxi Shuckers. Since 2016, he has worked as an NBA analyst for ESPN.

In 2007, McGrady traveled to the Darfurian refugee camps in Chad with John Prendergast and Omer Ismail of the Enough Project. McGrady recruited NBA players to support an initiative linking schools in Darfurian refugee camps to American middle schools, high schools, and universities. Prior to the start of the 2010 season with the Rockets, he changed his jersey number to No. 3 in order to promote his humanitarian efforts in the region and a documentary on his summer visit called &quot;3 Points&quot;. In 2008, McGrady was criticized for his comments on the All-Star Game being held in New Orleans, which was only three years removed from the destruction surrounding Hurricane Katrina. McGrady publicly questioned the quality of public safety and protection of NBA players.

In August 2021, McGrady launched an app, SOLEcial, designed to sell autographed shoes, trading cards, and other memorabilia directly to buyers.

In December 2024, McGrady, his former Raptors teammate Vince Carter, Jozy Altidore and a coalition of private equity fund executives purchased a minority stake in the National Football League&#x27;s Buffalo Bills.

<doc id="503979" wikidata="Q1015" url="?curid=503979" title="Koper">
<text>Koper (; ) is the fifth-largest city in Slovenia. Located in the Istrian region in the southwestern part of the country, Koper is the main urban center of the Slovene coast. Port of Koper is the country&#x27;s only container port and a major contributor to the economy of the Municipality of Koper. The city is a destination for a number of Mediterranean cruising lines.

Koper is also one of the main road entry points into Slovenia from Italy, which lies to the north of the municipality. The main motorway crossing is at Spodnje Škofije to the north of the city of Koper. The motorway continues into Rabuiese and Trieste. Koper also has a rail connection with the capital city, Ljubljana. On the coast, there is a crossing at Lazaret into Lazzaretto in Muggia municipality in Trieste province. The Italian border crossing is known as San Bartolomeo.

==Sights==
Major sights in Koper include the 15th-century Praetorian Palace and &quot;Loggia&quot; in Venetian Gothic style, the 12th-century &quot;Carmine Rotunda&quot; church, and St. Nazarius&#x27; Cathedral, with its 14th-century tower.

==Names==
The Italian name of the city was anciently written as &quot;Capo d&#x27;Istria&quot;, and is reported on maps and sources in other European languages as such. Ancient names of the city include &quot;Ægidia&quot; and &quot;Justinopolis&quot;. Modern names of the city include , , and . The Slovene population calls the city &quot;Koper&quot;. The Slavic population, present in the area since at least the late 7th century, largely relied on oral tradition up to the invention of printing. The Slovenian name &quot;Koper&quot; was first attested in writing in 1557, but with the spelling &quot;Copper&quot;.

==History==

Koper began as a settlement built on an island in the southeastern part of the Gulf of Koper in the northern Adriatic. Called &quot;Insula Caprea&quot; (Goat Island) or &quot;Capro&quot; by Roman settlers, it developed into the city of Aegida, which was mentioned by the Roman author Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; (Natural History) (iii. 19. s. 23).

In 568, Roman citizens of nearby Tergeste (modern Trieste) fled to Aegida due to an invasion of the Lombards. In honour of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian II, the town was renamed &quot;Justinopolis&quot;. Later, Justinopolis was under both Lombard and Frankish rule and was briefly occupied by Avars in the 8th century.

Since at least the 8th century (and possibly as early as the 6th century) Koper was the seat of a diocese. One of Koper&#x27;s bishops was the Lutheran reformer Pier Paolo Vergerio. In 1828, it was merged into the Diocese of Trieste.

Trade between Koper and Venice has been recorded since 932. In the war between Venice and the Holy Roman Empire, Koper was on the latter side, and as a result was awarded with town rights, granted in 1035 by Emperor Conrad II. After 1232, Koper was under the Patriarch of Aquileia, and in 1278 it joined the Republic of Venice. It was at this time that the city walls and towers were partly demolished.

In 1420, the Patriarch of Aquileia ceded his remaining possessions in Istria to the Republic, consolidating Venetian power in Koper.

Koper grew to become the capital of Venetian Istria and was renamed &quot;Caput Histriae&quot; &#x27;head of Istria&#x27; (from which stems its modern Italian name, &quot;Capodistria&quot;).

The 16th century saw the population of Koper fall drastically, from its high of between 10,000 and 12,000 inhabitants, due to repeated plague epidemics. When Trieste became a free port in 1719, Koper lost its monopoly on trade, and its importance diminished further.

According to the 1900 census, 7,205 Italian, 391 Slovenian, 167 Croatian, and 67 German inhabitants lived in Koper.

Assigned to Italy from Austria-Hungary after World War I, at the end of World War II it was part of the Zone B of the Free Territory of Trieste, controlled by Yugoslavia. Most of the Italian inhabitants left the city by 1954, when the Free Territory of Trieste formally ceased to exist and Zone B became part of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1977, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Koper was separated from the Diocese of Trieste.

With Slovenian independence in 1991, Koper became the only commercial port in Slovenia. The University of Primorska is based in the city.

The influence of the Port of Koper on tourism was one of the factors in Ankaran deciding to leave the municipality in a referendum in 2011 to establish its own municipality.

==Architecture==

Koper&#x27;s 15th-century Praetorian Palace is located on the city square. It was built from two older 13th-century houses that were connected by a loggia, rebuilt many times, and then finished as a Venetian Gothic palace. Today, it is home to the city of Koper&#x27;s tourist office.

The city&#x27;s Cathedral of the Assumption was built in the second half of the 12th century and has one of the oldest bells in Slovenia (from 1333), cast by Nicolò and Martino, the sons of Master Giacomo of Venice. The upper terrace is periodically open and offers a great view of the Bay of Trieste. In the middle of it hangs the Sacra Conversatione painting from 1516, one of the best Renaissance paintings in Slovenia, made by Vittore Carpaccio.

== Climate ==
Koper has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;). There is a substantial amount of rainfall in Koper, even in the driest month, with each month averaging well over . This climate is considered to be Cfa according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification. The average temperature in Koper is . The average annual rainfall is .

== Demographics ==

In the past, Italian was the most common language spoken in the town, but its presence decreased sharply after Slovenian Istria was incorporated into Yugoslavia in 1954, with most of the ethnic Italians leaving the town.

Today, Koper is officially bilingual, with both Slovene and Italian as its official languages, with Italian being mainly used as a secondary language by the Slovene-speaking majority. Slovene dominates with virtually all citizens speaking it, followed by pockets of speakers of Italian and Croatian.

== Sports ==
The main association football club is FC Koper, who currently play in the Slovenian PrvaLiga, the top flight of Slovenian football, having won it once.

== Port ==

First established during the Roman Empire, the Port of Koper has played an important role in the development of the area. It is among the largest in the region and is one of the most important transit routes for goods heading from Asia to central Europe. In contrast with other European ports, which are managed by port authorities, the activities of the Port of Koper comprise the management of the free zone area, the management of the port area, and the role of terminal operator.

<text>Arts et Métiers (, literally &quot;Arts and Trades&quot;) is a station on lines 3 and 11 of the Paris Métro. It is located in the 3rd arrondissement.

==Location==
The station is located at the intersection of Rues Beaubourg, Réaumur and Turbigo, the platforms established:
* on line 3, in a curve under the angle formed by these last two streets and oriented east–west, between Réaumur - Sébastopol and Temple stations;
* on line 11, further east along the east–west axis of Rue Réaumur, between Rambuteau and République.

==History==
The station opened on 19 October 1904 as part of the first section of the 3 line that then operated between Père Lachaise and Villiers. The platforms on the 11 line opened as part of the original section of that line from Châtelet to Porte des Lilas on 28 April 1935.

It takes its name from the nearby Conservatoire national des arts et métiers, including the Musée des Arts et Métiers, both of which it serves.

The corridors as well as the two lines’ platforms were modernized after 1988, with those of the 3 line being done in the &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; decorative style, in this case in green. The renovation for the 11-line platforms, designed by Belgian comics artist François Schuiten, marks the October 1994 bicentenary of the &quot;conservatoire&quot; in a steampunk style reminiscent of the science fiction works of Jules Verne.

In 2018, the station was entered by 4,235,686 travellers, which put it in 119th place among metro stations by usage.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; program on the one hand and the extension of the 11 line to on the other, the corridors of the station are undergoing renovations from 12 September 2019 to 3 December 2020 to test coating materials for future stations.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has five entrances all made up of fixed staircases, the first four being adorned with a Dervaux candelabrum:
* entrance 1 - &quot;Rue Conté, rue de Turbigo&quot; - odd numbered side leading to the right of 57, rue de Turbigo;
* entrance 2 - &quot;Rue Réaumur, rue de Turbigo&quot; - even numbers side located opposite 42, rue Réaumur;
* entrance 3 - &quot;Rue de Turbigo, rue Beaubourg&quot; located at the right of 107, rue de Turbigo and 48, rue Réaumur;
* entrance 4 - &quot;Rue Réaumur&quot; leading to 31, Rue de Turbigo and 51, Rue Réaumur;
* entrance 5 - &quot;Rue des Vertus&quot;, only allowing exit from the platforms of line 11, located at the right of 22 Rue Réaumur.

=== Station layout ===
===Platforms===
The platforms of the two lines, seventy-five meters long, are of standard configuration. Two in number per stopping point, they are separated by the metro tracks located in the centre and the vault is elliptical.

The station on line 3 is set up in a curve and its decoration is in the &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style in a green colour. The lighting frames, of the same shade, are supported by curved supports in the shape of a scythe. The direct lighting is white while the indirect lighting, projected on the vault, is multi-coloured. The white ceramic tiles are flat and cover the walls, the vault (diagonally, a peculiarity that the stopping point only shares with Nation on line 1), the tunnel exit and the outlets of the corridors. The advertising frames are green and cylindrical, and the name of the station is written in capital letters on enamelled plates. The platforms are equipped with &quot;Motte&quot; style seats and green &quot;sit-stand&quot; benches.

The station on line 11 has been completely covered since October 1994 with copper plates riveted to each other, and not the usual earthenware tiles. This dressing was put in place during the bicentennial ceremonies of the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers. It is the work of Benoît Peeters, French screenwriter, and François Schuiten, Belgian designer, authors of the series &quot;Les Cités obscures&quot;. The traveller is plunged inside a vast machine, a sort of underground Nautilus evoking the atmosphere of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;, in steampunk style. On the station&#x27;s ceiling, a series of large cogs evokes the Musée des Arts et Métiers. Copper, the only material used, evokes the technical and industrial world. On the platforms, a series of portholes open onto small scenographies, centred on the museum&#x27;s collections. You observe a armillary sphere, the Telstar satellite, or even a water wheel. All the station&#x27;s furniture suits the decoration style and constitutes a unique case on the network. Name plates, wooden seats, waste bins, flat tunnel exits, alarm post banners and the lighting are brown in the &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style. However, the latter do not have multi-coloured lighting and the light is diffused in a semi-subdued way on the track side. The platforms are devoid of advertisements.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 20, 38, 47 and 75 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N12 and N23 of the Noctilien network.

<text>The Game Boy portable system has a library of games, which were released in plastic ROM cartridges. The Game Boy first launched in Japan on April 21, 1989, with &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;, &quot;Alleyway&quot;, &quot;Baseball&quot;, and &quot;Yakuman&quot;. For the North American launches, &quot;Tetris&quot; and &quot;Tennis&quot; were also featured, while &quot;Yakuman&quot; was never released outside of Japan. The last games to be published for the system were the Japan-only titles &quot;Shikakui Atama o Maruku Suru: Kanji no Tatsujin&quot; and &quot;Shikakui Atama o Maruku Suru: Keisan no Tatsujin&quot;, which were both released on March 30, 2001. This list is initially organized alphabetically by their English titles, or, when Japan-exclusive, their &quot;rōmaji&quot; transliterations; however, it is also possible to sort each column individually by clicking the square icon at the top of each column. The Game Boy system is not region locked, meaning that software purchased in any region can be played on any region&#x27;s hardware. For Game Boy Color cartridges compatible with the original Game Boy, see those indicated in List of Game Boy Color games.

<doc id="503982" wikidata="Q1341849" url="?curid=503982" title="République station">
<text>République () is a station on lines 3, 5, 8, 9 and 11 of the Paris Métro. It is located under the Place de la République, at the tripoint border of the 3rd, 10th and 11th arrondissements. It is an important interchange station; its 16.6 million users (2019) make it the seventh busiest out of 302 on the Métro network.

==Location==
The station is located under Place de la République, the platforms established:
* on Line 3, under the eastern part of the square along the east–west axis of the Avenue de la République (between Temple and Parmentier stations);
* on Line 5, north-west of the square on a north-west/south-east axis, at the end of the Boulevard de Magenta (between Jacques Bonsergent and Oberkampf);
* on Line 8 and Line 9, west of the square on a north-west/south-east axis, at the end of Boulevard Saint-Martin (between Strasbourg–Saint-Denis on the one hand—not including the current ghost station Saint-Martin—and on the other hand Filles du Calvaire for Line 8 or Oberkampf for Line 9);
* on Line 11, north-east along a north-east/south-west axis, at the start of the Rue du Faubourg-du-Temple (between Arts et Métiers and Goncourt).

==History==
The station opened on 19 October 1904 as part of the first section of Line 3 between Père Lachaise and Villiers. The Line 5 platforms opened on 15 November 1907 with the extension of the line from Jacques Bonsergent (then called Lancry) to Gare du Nord. The Line 8 platforms opened on 5 May 1931 with the extension of the line from Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Charenton. The Line 9 platforms opened on 10 December 1933 with the extension of the line from Richelieu-Drouot to Porte de Montreuil. The Line 11 platforms opened on 28 April 1935 with the opening of the line from Châtelet to Porte des Lilas.

===Name===
It is named after the Place de la République, which was named to commemorate the First, Second and Third French Republics in 1879.

===Renovation===
The platforms of Line 3 were among the first to receive a metallic bodywork after 1952, while those of Line 5 were renovated after 1969 by adopting the Mouton-Duvernet style with vertically-aligned multi-toned tiles, cutting radically with the dominant white of the original metro, as well as the light frames characteristic of this type of arrangement, which was then supplemented with Motte style seats and red sit-stand bars. Larger Mouton style tiles placed vertically also cover certain outlets of the access corridors to Lines 3 and 11. The platforms of Lines 8, 9 and 11 were modernised in Andreu-Motte style, in yellow for the first two stations and red for the third as was done to a third of other the stations on the network between 1974 and 1984, while those on Line 3 lost their metal panels after 1988 in favour of a &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; decoration, in this case blue.

As part of the RATP &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme, the station&#x27;s corridors and the platforms on Line 5 were modernised on 28 June 2010, which notably allowed the renewal of lighting and earthenware tiles, the installation of new signage, a sales and &quot;comptoir-club&quot; counter, as well as the creation of four automatic ticket machines, anticipating the redevelopment programme by the City of Paris of the Place de la République. These latest above ground works are suspected to be the cause of numerous water leakages in the station, destroying the repairs completed three years earlier. The cost of repairs is estimated at eight million euros.

From 30 June to 3 August 2018, the platforms of Line 11 are the first of the latter to be raised and tiled for their adaptation as part of its extension to .

===Station layout===

*Note: tracks toward (Lines 5 and 9) run in the same direction.

===Platforms===
The Line 3 station has a standard configuration with two platforms separated by metro tracks. The decoration is in the &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style in a blue colour. The frames for lighting, in the same colour, are supported by curved supports in the shape of a scythe. Indirect lighting is bicolour (very pale blue and white), unlike other lighting strips of this style where it is a vivid multicolour. The white ceramic tiles are flat and cover the walls, the vault, and the tunnel exit. The advertising frames are white and cylindrical, and the platforms are equipped with Motte style seats as well as blue sit-stand benches.

The station on Line 5 is also styled in a classic layout. The decoration is in the style used for most Métro stations. The lighting strips are white and rounded in the Gaudin style of the &quot;Renouveau du métro des années 2000&quot;; the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault, and the tunnel exit. The advertising frames are in white ceramic and the seats are green Akiko style.

The stations of Lines 8 and 9 are made up of two half-stations per line, those of Line 9 framing those of Line 8. The platforms of these two lines, slightly curved at the western end, are furnished in the style &quot;Andreu-Motte &quot;and have a yellow light canopy, benches in flat orange-yellow tiling (except the platform for Pont de Sèvres almost deprived of benches but with a corridor opening treated with the same tiles) as well as yellow Motte seats. These arrangements are combined with white bevelled tiling for the two lines, while the staircase surrounds and the surface of the bench seats on the platform towards Pont de Sèvres are treated with white flat tiling. The advertising frames are metallic.

Finally, the station on Line 11 is also of standard configuration. It is decorated in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two red lighting frames, benches and outlets of the corridors are of flat tiles of the same colour and red Motte seats. The walls, the vault and the tunnel exits are covered with flat white tiles. The advertising frames are metallic, and the platforms are tiled in anthracite grey.

For each stopping point, the vault is elliptical, and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 20, 56, 75 and 91 of the RATP bus network as well as, at night, by lines N01, N02, N12, N23, N141 and N142 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Parmentier () is a station on Paris Métro Line 3 located in the 11th arrondissement of Paris.

==Location==
The station is located under Avenue de la République, at the intersection with Avenue Parmentier and Rue Oberkampf. Oriented approximately along an east–west axis, it is located between République and Rue Saint-Maur stations.

==History==
It was opened on 19 October 1904 as part of the first section of line 3 between Père Lachaise and Villiers.

It is on the &quot;Avenue Parmentier&quot;, which is named after the military pharmacist, agronomist, nutritionist and hygienist Antoine-Augustin Parmentier (1737-1813), promoter of cultivating the potato as a food source (for humans) in France and throughout Europe.

Like one station out of three in the 1950s and 1960s, the platforms were modernized with metallic bodywork, but distinguished by its atypical mesh design, incorporating a cultural arrangement dedicated to Antoine Parmentier and the potato.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Metro Renewal&quot; program, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated on 2 September 2002.

In 2018, 3,283,276 passengers entered this station which placed it at the 171st position of the metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has a single access called &quot;Avenue Parmentier&quot;, opening at the angle formed by Rue Édouard-Lockroy and the former. Consisting of a fixed staircase, it is adorned with a Guimard entrance, which was decreed as a historic monument on 12 February 12, 2016.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Parmentier is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is cultural on the theme of the potato. The walls sheathed with metal panels typical of the 1950s having the particularity of being grilled to evoke the cracks of the potato net, while a statue of Antoine-Augustin Parmentier distributing potatoes is displayed in a niche built into the wall of the platform in the direction of Gallieni.

On each platform, display cases with objects from Pre-Columbian America are installed. The body, fitted with white horizontal uprights and lighted dark green advertising frames, is also adorned with one of the panels presenting the history of the potato and its uses according to the varieties and the quality of French production. The enamelled nameplates incorporated into the metal panels are among the last in the network to indicate the station&#x27;s name in yellow capital letters on a black background, an initial characteristic of the metal panel stations which it only shares with Falguière on line 12. The furnishings are complemented by white seats of a unique model hugging the buttocks of travellers. The bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault and the tunnel exits, and the lighting is provided by independent strips.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by bus lines 20, 46 and 96 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N12 and N23 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Rue Saint-Maur () is a station on Paris Métro Line 3, located in the 11th arrondissement of Paris.

==Location==
The station is located under Avenue de la République, between Rue Saint-Maur and Rue Servan. Approximately oriented along an east–west axis, it is located between the Parmentier and Père Lachaise stations.

==History==
The station opened on 19 October 1904 as part of the first section of line 3 between Père Lachaise and Villiers.

The &quot;Rue Saint-Maur &quot; is named after Saint Maurus, a disciple of Saint Benedict of Nursia, who is said to have saved Saint Placid from drowning. It owes its initial name of Saint-Maur to its proximity to rue Saint-Maur, which corresponds to an old path which led from the Abbey of Saint-Maur to the Abbey of Saint-Denis. Until the early years of the 20th century the station was called &quot;Saint-Maur&quot;, but on 1 September 1998 its name was changed to avoid confusion with stations on RER line A in Saint-Maur-des-Fossés in the southeastern suburbs of Paris.

Like a third of the stations on the network, between 1974 and 1984 the station&#x27;s platforms were renovated in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style, orange in this case. As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated in the course of the 2000s.

In 2018, 3,065,770 travelers entered this station which placed it at 181st position of the metro stations for its usage.

* entrance 2 – &quot;Rue Servan&quot;, consisting of an escalator allowing only an exit to street level, located opposite No. 90 bis of the avenue;
* entrance 3 – &quot;Rue Saint-Hubert&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase embellished with a mast with a yellow &quot;M&quot; inscribed in a circle, also located at the right of No. 90 bis of the avenue;
* entrance 4 – &quot;Rue des Bluets&quot;, also consisting of a fixed staircase, leading to no 79 on the avenue.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Rue Saint-Maur is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by metro tracks and the vault is elliptical.

<text>Gambetta () is a station of the Paris Métro. It serves Line 3 and is the southern terminus of Line 3bis. It is located in the 20th arrondissement of Paris.

==Location==
The station is located under Avenue Gambetta, the platforms are position:

* on line 3, between Place Gambetta and Place Martin-Nadaud on an east–west axis (between Père Lachaise and Porte de Bagnolet stations);
* on line 3 bis, north-east of the square, along the town hall of the 20th arrondissement along a north-east / south-west axis (preceded by Pelleport).

==History==
 Gambetta was opened on 25 January 1905 when the line was extended from Père Lachaise and was the eastern terminus of the line until 27 November 1921, when the line was extended to Porte des Lilas.

In 1969, the former &quot;Martin Nadaud&quot; station, which was only 232 metres west of &quot;Gambetta&quot;, was combined with &quot;Gambetta&quot; by linking &quot;Martin Nadaud&#x27;s&quot; closed platforms with &quot;Gambetta&quot; by tunnel. On 23 March 1971 the line to &quot;Porte des Lilas&quot; was separated from line 3 and became Line 3bis. The beginning of the old tunnel to &quot;Porte des Lilas&quot; now connects the platforms of lines 3 and 3bis. On 2 April 1971 line 3 was extended to Gallieni.

As part of the RATP &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the station was renovated by reconnecting with the classic bevelled white tiles, first in corridors by 6 February 2004, then on the platforms of line 3 by 5 November 2008.

The station is in the &quot;Avenue Gambetta&quot;, which is named after the statesman Léon Gambetta (1838–82), Prime Minister for 66 days in 1881 and 1882.

In 2018, 7,137,504 passengers entered this station which placed it at the 41st position of the metro stations for its usage.

===Station layout===

===Platforms===
Line 3 station is standard configuration with two platforms separated by metro tracks under an elliptical vault. On the other hand, the stopping point is of an unusual length, because its western end, established in a slight curve, consists of the platforms of the former &quot;Martin Nadaud&quot; station, absorbed in 1969, their border is now fitted with railings. A clear difference in height is also visible between the two parts of the vault. Following the modernization of the station completed in 2008, the new stop point on line 3 is provided with specific lighting, provided by four-branched candelabras diffusing white light on the platforms and bluish on the painted white vault. The lighting of the &quot;Martin Nadaud&quot; station is carried out by tubes that are usually found in certain corridors of renovated stations. The bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls and part of the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are in white ceramic and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The &quot;Akiko&quot; style seats are green.

The station on line 3 bis, the former departure station for the terminus loop, consists of two tracks on either side of a central platform under an elliptical vault, with a dead-end buffer stop on the south side. Established in a curve, it is completely covered with bevelled white tiles and devoid of advertising frames on its sides; the enamelled name plates in Parisine font are only present on the island platform. The latter is fitted with red &quot;Motte&quot; style seats and lit by a tube strip.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 26, 60, 61, 64, 69, 102 and the &quot;La Traverse de Charonne&quot; urban service of the RATP Bus Network and, by night, by lines N16 and N34 of the Noctilien network.

<text>Porte de Bagnolet () is a station on Paris Métro Line 3, located in the 20th arrondissement of Paris.

==Location==
The station is located under Rue Belgrand, between Place Édith-Piaf and Place de la Porte-de-Bagnolet. Oriented along an east–west axis, it is located between the Gambetta station and the eastern terminus of Gallieni.

==History==
It was opened on 2 April 1971 when the line was extended from Gambetta to Gallieni, which replaced the old section to Porte des Lilas which was isolated to become the Line 3bis. The interchange with the tramway line 3b opened on 15 December 2012.

It is named after the &quot;Porte de Bagnolet&quot;, a gate in the nineteenth century Thiers Wall of Paris on the way to the commune of Bagnolet, probably named after some Roman baths located there. Porte de Bagnolet also constitutes one of the main access routes to the interior of Paris as well as the starting point of the A3 autoroute.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Metro Renewal&quot; program, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated on 16 November 2004.

In 2018, 4,347,994 travelers entered this station which places it in the 118th position of the metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has five entrances, each decorated with a mast with a yellow &quot;M&quot; inscribed in a circle:

* entrance 1 - &quot;Boulevard Davout&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase lined with an escalator, leading to the right of no. 221 of this Boulevard;
* entrance 2 - &quot;Boulevard Mortier&quot;, also consisting of a fixed staircase and an ascending escalator, located southeast of Place Sully-Lombard;
* entrance 3 - &quot;Rue de la Py&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase, located to the right of no. 60 Rue Belgrand;
* entrance 4 - &quot;Rue Belgrand&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase, leading to no. 50 on this street;
* entrance 5 - &quot;Place Édith-Piaf&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase, located to the south-east of the said Place, opposite no. 5 Pue de la Py.

Although the station was built in the 1970s, the sides of the corridors and the platform areas are covered with traditional bevelled white tiles following their modernization completed in late 2004.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Porte de Bagnolet is a standard configuration station. It has two 105-meter-long platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. However, due to the difficult nature of the subsoil, composed of an anarchic mixture of gypsum, sand and clay, it is placed on eighty piles of one meter in diameter, anchored in limestone at a depth of twenty-seven meters. The decoration, typical of the 1970s, is like the &quot;Mouton-Duvernet&quot; style with walls covered with bevelled beige tiles placed vertically and aligned, a white painted vault as well as two hanging lighting strips. The metallic advertising frames are grey and protruding, and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The &quot;Motte&quot; style seats are red.

===Other connections===
The station is served by the tram line T3b, by bus lines 57, 76, 102 and 351 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N16, N34, N141 and N142 via the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Sunpadh (; also spelled Sunpad and Sunbadh) was an Iranian nobleman from the House of Karen, who incited an uprising against the Abbasid Caliphate in the 8th century.

== Background ==
Sunpadh was a Zoroastrian nobleman, who was a native of a village called Ahan in Nishapur, Khorasan. He most likely belonged to the ancient House of Karen, formerly one of the seven great houses of the pre-Islamic Parthian and Sasanian eras. Khorasan had originally been a fief of the Karenids, but the family lost control of the province at the battle of Nishapur during the Arab conquest of Iran, thus forcing many Karenid nobles to withdraw to Tabaristan, where a branch of the family, the Qarinvand dynasty, had managed to withstand the Arab incursions.

== Revolt ==
Following the betrayal and subsequent death of the Iranian general Abu Muslim by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775) in 755, the enraged Sunpadh revolted. He captured the cities of Nishapur, Qumis, and Ray, and was called &quot;Firuz ispahbadh&quot; (&quot;the victorious &quot;ispahbadh&quot;&quot;). At Ray, he seized the treasuries of Abu Muslim. Most of his supporters were from Jibal and Tabaristan—the Dabuyid ruler, Khurshid (r. 740–760), supported the anti-Abbasid rebellion of Sunpadh, and was in return given a part of Abu Muslim&#x27;s treasure. 

According to Nizam al-Mulk, Ibn al-Athir, and Mirkhvand, Sunpadh swore to march on Mecca and destroy the Kaaba. However, according to Patricia Crone, this is unlikely, who says &quot;the idea that he should have rushed off in anger from Nishapur in order singlehandedly to bring down the caliphate and Islam is absurd.&quot; Other sources state that Sunpadh declared himself as a prophet, and disagreed on Abu Muslim&#x27;s death, claiming to be his mediator. Sunpadh allegedly further preached that &quot;Abu Muslim has not died, and when Mansur meant to slay him, he chanted God&#x27;s great name, turned into a white dove and flew away. Now he is standing with Mahdi and Mazdak in a castle of copper and they shall emerge by and by.&quot; This, however, is a misrepresentation of Sunpadh, whose intention by revolting, was most likely to remove the Muslims from power.

A force of 10,000 Abbasid troops under Jahwar ibn Marrar al-Ijli was shortly sent towards Sunpadh—they clashed between Hamadan and Ray, where Sunpadh was defeated and routed. According to the historian Ibn Isfandiyar, countless of Abu Muslim&#x27;s and Sunpadh&#x27;s supporters were killed in the defeat that their bones were still noticeable in 912. Sunpadh then fled to Tabaristan, but was killed there by one of Khurshid&#x27;s cousins, ostensibly because he had failed to show the man proper respect. It is possible, however, that the murder was instigated by Khurshid, in the hope of acquiring the remainder of Abu Muslim&#x27;s treasure.

<text>Gallieni (Parc de Bagnolet) () is a station on Paris Métro Line 3, being its eastern terminus.

==Location==
The station is located under the Paris-Gallieni International Bus Station, in the heart of a motorway complex at the junction of the A3 autoroute and the Boulevard Périphérique Paris ring-road. Oriented along an east–west axis, it is preceded by or followed by the Porte de Bagnolet metro station.

==History==
It was opened on 2 April 1971 when the line was extended from Gambetta in order to improve the service to the town of Bagnolet. It has since been the new eastern terminus, replacing the previous terminus at Porte des Lilas, the section between the latter and Gambetta station, disconnected since 27 March 1971 and became the current line 3 bis. It is situated on the &quot;Avenue Gallieni&quot;, which is named after General Joseph Gallieni, famous for commandeering 600 taxis to take troops to the front to help save Paris during the First Battle of the Marne in 1914.

The station bears the subtitle Parc de Bagnolet because of its proximity to the northwest end of Parc Jean-Moulin-Les Guilands, shared between the municipalities of Bagnolet and Montreuil.

In the course of the 2010s, the tiling on the walls supporting the station&#x27;s ceiling was renovated, changing from beige to the characteristic white of the metro network, the upper part was left bare and painted white.

In 2018, 5,841,623 passengers entered this station, which places it at the 70th position of the metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances:
* entrance 1 - &quot;Shopping Center&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase decorated with a mast with a yellow &quot;M&quot; inscribed in a circle, emerging under two road ramps connecting the Boulevard Périphérique to the A3 autoroute, to the right of the Bel Est commercial center;
* entrance 2 &quot;RATP Bus Station&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase lined with an escalator allowing only the exit, located slightly further south, opposite the said bus station. Although the station was built in the 1970s, the sides of the exchange room are covered with traditional bevelled white tiles.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Gallieni is a station of a particular configuration. It has four tracks framing two island platforms. The trains arrive on the central tracks and depart from the central north and north side tracks, the south side track used for the train depot. The walls are vertical, as are the pillars, and support a horizontal ceiling covered with a black fire-resistant flocking. The decoration is typical of the 1970s: the bevelled ceramic tiles, placed vertically and aligned, are beige in colour on the walls (a colour that can be found at Porte de Bagnolet on the same line and at Kléber on line 6) and white on the pillars, the upper part of the latter being coated and painted white. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station, inscribed on enamelled plates, is in Helvetica font instead of the usual Parisine typography, a peculiarity that the station only shares with Place d&#x27;Italie on line 6 and Porte de Versailles on line 12. The &quot;Motte&quot; style seats are yellow.

===Bus connections===
The station has a bus station served by the RATP Bus Network, lines 76, 102, 122, 221, 318 and 351.

<doc id="503996" wikidata="Q606164" url="?curid=503996" title="Porte des Lilas station">
<text>Porte des Lilas station () is a station of the Paris Métro. It serves Line 11 and is the northern terminus of Line 3bis. Located on the edge of the 19th and 20th arrondissements of Paris, it serves the neighborhood of the Porte des Lilas. The station is named after the nearby &quot;Porte des Lilas&quot;, a gate in the nineteenth century Thiers Wall of Paris, which led to the town of Les Lilas.

The station was referred to in Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s famous 1958 chanson &quot;&quot;Le poinçonneur des Lilas&quot; about the ennui of a Métro employee&#x27;s workday. A Scopitone music video for the song was filmed in Porte des Lilas, showing the singer in a Métro uniform, punching tickets.

Until January 2021 when Line 14 was extended to , Porte des Lilas was the only station at one of the gates of Paris to be served by two separate métro lines.

== History ==
The station was opened on 27 November 1921 when line 3 was extended from Gambetta to Porte des Lilas, serving as its eastern terminus. It was originally planned to operate services through to Pré-Saint-Gervais on the then line 7, hence, two separate stations were built – one before the reversal loop (the station used today) and another along the tracks leading to Pré-Saint-Gervais (Porte des Lilas – Cinéma). This plan, however, did not materialise and only a shuttle service operated between the station and Pré-Saint-Gervais via a tunnel called &quot;voie navette&quot; until 2 September 1939 when it was stopped due to the onset of World War II.&quot;&quot;

The line 11 platforms opened as part of the original section of the line from Châtelet to Porte des Lilas on 28 April 1935 and was its eastern terminus until it was extended to Mairie des Lilas on 17 February 1937. On 27 March 1971, the line 3 platforms were transferred to line 3bis on its establishment.

As part of modernization works for the extension of Line 11 to in 2023 for the Grand Paris Express, an additional entrance will be added at rue des Glaïeuls and will be equipped with escalators. Entrance 2 will also be retrofitted with a lift to make the station accessible to those with reduced mobility. From 26 June 2021 to 29 August 2021, the station acted as line 11&#x27;s eastern terminus when its original terminus, Mairie des Lilas, was closed for renovations.

In 2019, the station was used by 3,439,385 passengers, making it the 143rd busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,021,179 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 120th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===

The station has five entrances:

* Entrance 1: avenue Gambetta (original surface building designed by Charles Plumet, similar to the ones at Pelleport and Saint-Fargeau on line 3bis)
* Entrance 2: boulevard Mortier
* Entrance 3: rue de Belleville
* Entrance 4: boulevard Sérurier
* Entrance 5: square du Dr. Variot

A sixth entrance used to exist at the corner of avenue Gambetta and rue des tourelles, in front of the Piscine des Tourelles, then known as &quot;Stade Nautique&quot;. It was removed during its reconstruction in 1989.

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===

==== Line 3bis ====
It has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms.

==== Line 11 ====
It has a particular configuration specific to the stations serving or had served as a terminus. It has 2 half-stations – the one towards &quot;Mairie des Lilas&quot; consisting of a side platform and a single track and the one towards &quot;Châtelet&quot; consisting of an island platform with two tracks flanking it. The platform towards Châtelet contains a few mosaics on the walls – a portrait of Georges Brassens and two mosaics of lilies.

==== Porte des Lilas – Cinéma ====

It also has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms, with one track made for steel-wheeled trains (leading to &quot;voie des fêtes&quot;) and another for rubber-tyred trains (leading to &quot;voie Navette&quot;). Access to these platforms are usually restricted.

The disused station has been repurposed as a set for commercials, films, and music videos to avoid disrupting commercial services on the network, hence the nickname, &quot;cinéma&quot;.

Porte des Lilas – Cinéma was featured in a brief scene in &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot;; in the French film &quot;The Past&quot; with the station panels and signs adapted for each film; and in &quot;John Wick: Chapter 4&quot;. An average of 5 films are shot per year and a day of filming costs between 15,000 and 18,000 euros, bringing over 200,000 euros in revenue each year.

=== Other connections ===
Since 15 December 2012, the station has been served by tramway T3b. It is also served by lines 20, 48, 61, 64, 96, 105, 115, 129, 170, and 249 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by lines N12 and N23 of the Noctilien bus network.

<doc id="503997" wikidata="Q3319914" url="?curid=503997" title="History of Helsinki">
<text>[[Helsinki]] is the capital of Finland and is its largest city. It was founded in 1550 to be a Swedish rival to other ports on the Gulf of Finland, but it remained a small fishing village for over two centuries. Its importance to the Swedish Kingdom increased in the mid-18th century when the fortress originally known as Sveaborg was constructed on islands at the entrance to the harbor. While intended to protect Helsinki from Russian attack, Sveaborg ultimately surrendered to Russia during the Finnish War (1808–1809), and Finland was incorporated into the Russian Empire as part of the Treaty of Fredrikshamn. Russia then moved the Finnish capital from Turku to Helsinki, and the city grew dramatically during the 19th century. Finnish independence, a civil war, and three consecutive conflicts associated with World War II made Helsinki a site of significant political and military activity during the first half of the 20th century. Helsinki hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1952, was a European Capital of Culture in 2000, and the World Design Capital in 2012. It is considered a Beta Level city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC), according to their 2012 analysis.

==Kingdom of Sweden==

Helsinki was founded by Swedish King Gustav I in 1550 as the town of Helsingfors. Gustav intended for the town to serve the purpose of consolidating trade in the southern part of Finland and providing a competitor to Reval (today: &quot;Tallinn&quot;), a nearby Hanseatic League city which dominated local trade at the time. In order to ensure the economic viability of the city of Helsinki, the king ordered the citizens of several other towns to relocate to Helsingfors, but the order did not achieve its intended effect. The Swedish acquisition of northeastern Estonia, including Reval, in 1561 during the Livonian War caused the Swedish crown to lose interest in building up a competitor to Reval, and Helsingfors languished as a forgotten village for decades thereafter.

In 1640, Helsingfors was moved south from its original location at the mouth of the river Vantaa (in Swedish: &quot;Vanda&quot;), but the improved harbour failed to attract traders. The plague of 1710 killed the greater part of the inhabitants of Helsingfors. After Russia began to assert itself in the Baltic with the foundation of St. Petersburg, Helsingfors was fortified by the Swedish authorities to protect the city from Russian attacks. Construction of the island fortress Sveaborg (in Finnish: &quot;Viapori&quot;, today: &quot;Suomenlinna&quot;) began in 1748.

During the Finnish War, Russians captured Helsingfors in March 1808 and besieged the Sveaborg fortress until it surrendered in May. In addition, about one quarter of the town was destroyed by a fire in November of that year.

==Grand Duchy of Finland==

Following the Russian victory in the war, former Swedish lands known as Finland were transferred from Swedish to Russian control in 1809, and in 1812 the Russian Tsar relocated the capital to Helsinki from Turku in the newly established Grand Duchy of Finland. At that time, the former capital of Turku was officially known as &quot;Åbo&quot; in Swedish, a city across from Sweden on the Gulf of Bothnia. It was believed that the relative lack of Swedish influence in Helsinki, combined with Helsinki&#x27;s greater proximity to St. Petersburg, would make a Finnish government headquartered there easier to control. The fortress of Sveaborg also made the capital less vulnerable to an attack via the sea.

After Helsinki became a new capital, the Russian Tsar ordered to rebuild the city of Helsinki in neoclassical style, intending to turn it into a stylish modern capital along the lines of St. Petersburg. The plan by Johan Albrecht Ehrenström was initiated in 1816 by the German-born architect Carl Ludvig Engel. The plan focused on a large urban square, and the initial buildings constructed in the city included the Government Palace on the east side of the square (1822), the Helsinki Old Church (1826), the Orthodox Holy Trinity Church (1826), and &quot;Engels Teater&quot; (1827), the first theatre in the city. Following the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, The Royal Academy of Turku, at the time the country&#x27;s only university, was also relocated to Helsinki. It was renamed the Imperial Alexander University in Finland (after Emperor Alexander I) and eventually became the modern University of Helsinki. Engel designed the Main University Building (completed on the west side of Senate Square in 1832) and the university library (1844), now the National Library of Finland. The relocation of the university consolidated the city&#x27;s new important role in the Grand Duchy and helped set it on the path of continuous growth. 

The planned reinvention of the city as a national capital was finalized by the completion of the Helsinki Cathedral on the north side of Senate Square in 1852. Planned as the focal point of the square from the outset, the cathedral was to be located on the site of the existing Lutheran Ulrika Eleonora church. As such, its construction could not begin until after completion of the Helsinki Old Church, relocation of the altar and furnishings, and demolition of the Ulrika Eleonora church. Construction of the cathedral, originally known as the St. Nicholas Church, took from 1830 to 1852; thus it was not completed until 12 years after Engel&#x27;s death. It remains a recognizable symbol of Helsinki, easily visible when approaching the city by boat from the Gulf of Finland.

During the 19th century, Helsinki became the economic and cultural center of Finland; as elsewhere, technological advancements such as railroads and industrialization were key factors behind the city&#x27;s growth. The first Helsinki railway station opened in 1862 with service to Hämeenlinna. Beginning from the late 19th century, the Finnish language became more and more dominant in the city, since the people who moved in from the countryside mostly spoke Finnish. In the beginning of the 20th century, the city was already predominantly Finnish-speaking, although with a large Swedish-speaking minority. Nowadays the Swedish speakers are a small minority.

Helsinki&#x27;s role as a capital resulted in its being the location of many prominent events in 19th and 20th century Finnish history. While the first 90 years under Russian rule were beneficial to the development of the city and the Finnish nation, the Russification of Finland began in 1899, during the reign of Nicholas II. In 1898, military officer Nikolay Bobrikov had been named by the tsar to be the Governor-General of Finland. Bobrikov&#x27;s role was to hasten the Russification processes and assimilate Finland more fully into the Russian empire, by force if necessary. This made him extremely unpopular among the Finns, and in 1904 he was assassinated in Helsinki&#x27;s Government Palace by Eugen Schauman.

==20th century to present==

Dissatisfaction with Russian rule and calls for independence continued, and in 1917 Finland took advantage of the Russian Revolution to obtain complete independence. Unfortunately, the sociopolitical turmoil that led to the Russian revolution also existed in Finland, and independence was immediately followed by a 3.5-month civil war. The socialist/communist faction of the population (Reds) rose against the conservative faction and government (Whites). The signal to begin hostilities was the lighting of a red lantern in the tower of the Helsinki Workers&#x27; Hall in the Hakaniemi district of the city on 26 January 1918. As Helsinki was within what was considered Red territory, the conservative Finnish government left the city and reassembled in Vaasa. The Finnish People&#x27;s Delegation, the government of the Finnish Socialist Workers&#x27; Republic (as Red Finland was officially known), was established in Helsinki on 28 January 1918. German soldiers, allies of the White Guard, took Helsinki back from the Reds on 13 April 1918. While atrocities were committed by both sides during the conflict, thousands of Red prisoners perished after the war while being detained by the Whites at several locations, including the Suomenlinna fortress.
The new nation developed as a democratic republic amidst the interwar turmoil in Europe. According to the August 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, Finland was placed in the Soviet Union&#x27;s sphere of influence. Consequently, the Soviets attacked Finland on 30 November 1939 to begin the Winter War. Helsinki was bombed immediately after the war commenced, and then several additional times during the war. After an unfavorable peace agreement to end the war, Finland took the opportunity to become a &quot;co-belligerent&quot; with Nazi Germany in World War II, fighting a Continuation War against the Soviet Union only. This also resulted in multiple bombings of Helsinki from 1941 to 1944, with the most significant series being three massive raids in February 1944.

After the war, Finland was forced to pay reparations to the Soviet Union. Despite this, Helsinki and the rest of Finland thrived. A landmark event was hosting the Games of the XV Olympiad (1952 Summer Olympics). Finland&#x27;s rapid urbanization in the 1970s, occurring late relative to the rest of Europe, tripled the population in the metropolitan area, and the Helsinki Metro subway system was built. The relatively sparse population density of Helsinki and its peculiar structure have often been attributed to the lateness of its growth. Helsinki was a European Capital of Culture in 2000, and the World Design Capital in 2012. It is considered a Beta Level city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC), according to their 2012 analysis.

The station opened on November 27, 1921 with the entry into service of the extension of line 3 from Gambetta to Porte des Lilas.

It owes its name to its location at the intersection with Rue Pelleport, which pays homage to 19th-century military leader Viscount (1773-1855) who was a major general. He was seriously wounded at the Battle of Eylau in 1807, and served in the armies of the Restoration before being appointed to the Chamber of Peers in 1841.

From 1940, under the Occupation, the chief supervisor of the station Lucien Noël set up a network of resistance fighters. He was arrested in October of the following year and shot on January 24, 1942 at the fortress of Mont-Valérien.

On March 27, 1971, the station was transferred to Line 3bis, which resulted from the isolation of the section between Gambetta and Porte des Lilas of Line 3 in the form of an independent line, following the extension of the first to Gallieni.

As part of RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the station corridors and platform lighting were renovated on May 19, 2006.

In 2019, 329,597 passengers passed through the station which placed it at 302nd position out 302 for its usage.

===Access===
 The station has a single entrance called &quot;Place Paul-Signac&quot;, leading to the said place facing Avenue Gambetta in the form of an original entrance with bas reliefs and earthenware decoration, designed in 1922 by Charles Plumet, particularity that it only shares with the Saint-Fargeau and Porte des Lilas stations on the same line. Due to the great depth of the platforms, it has two elevators surrounded by fixed stairs.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Pelleport is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is of the style used for the majority of metro stations.

<text>Porte de Clignancourt () is a station of the Paris Métro, the northern terminus of line 4, situated in the 18th Arrondissement.

==Location==
The station is located under Boulevard Ornano at the Porte de Clignancourt.

==History==
 The station was opened on 21 April 1908 as part of the first section of the line from Châtelet. A terminal loop is provided at the station for trains to turn around to return south towards Montrouge. Passengers usually detrain at the arrival platform and then the train proceeds empty via the loop to the departure platform. Beyond the turning loop lie a series of storage sidings and the main depot for Line 4 in Saint-Ouen.

Clignancourt was an ancient hamlet that belonged to the abbey of Saint-Denis, and was annexed to Paris in 1860. The term &quot;porte&quot; refers to a gate of the Thiers Wall built to defend Paris between 1841 and 1844 and demolished in the 1920s.

Porte de Clignancourt is also one end of Route nationale 14, which links Paris to Rouen.

The station lies just inside the city limits of Paris; to the north of the station is the commune of Saint-Ouen. Thus a short walk from the station is the &quot;marché aux puces de Saint-Ouen&quot; (), a large flea market founded in the late 17th century and possibly where the term &quot;flea market&quot; originated about 1880. Nearby is the Cimetière de Saint-Ouen, a Roman Catholic cemetery associated with Joan of Arc.

<doc id="504002" wikidata="Q287761" url="?curid=504002" title="Al-Muqanna">
<text>Al-Muqanna ( &quot;The Veiled&quot;, died c. 783) born Hashim, (Arabic/Persian: هاشم), was an 8th-century political and military leader who operated in modern Iran. He led an anti-Islamic rebellion against the Abbasid Caliphate and claimed to be a prophet. He was a major figure of the Khorrām-Dīn, an Iranian religion which drew on Zoroastrian and Islamic influences.

Iranian academics Said Nafisi and Amir-Hossein Aryanpour wrote about him in the context of the Khorrām-Dīnān, the religion he founded in AD 755.

== Name and early life ==
Al-Muqanna was born with the name Hashim. He was a native of Balkh in modern Afghanistan. At the time, the city was under the rule of the Abbasid Caliphate, whose heads claimed successorship to the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and leadership of the Muslim community. Hashim worked in textiles before his political and religious career.

Al-Muqanna&#x27;s nickname comes from the veil he wore over his face.

Encyclopaedia Iranica reports that early scholars believed he was of Sogdian origin.

== Biography ==
Of Iranian stock, Hashim was from Balkh, and he was a clothes pleater. He became a commander for Abu Muslim who ruled over the province of Greater Khorasan under the Abbasid caliphs. After Abu Muslim&#x27;s execution in 755 AD on the orders of the second Abbasid caliph al-Mansur, Hashim claimed to be the incarnation of God. He was reputed to wear a veil in order to cover up his beauty, whereas his followers wore white clothes in opposition to Abbasid rulers&#x27; black. He is reputed to have engaged in magic and miracles in order to gain followers. According to Bertold Spuler, Muqanna and his followers introduced common ownership of women.

Hashim was instrumental in the formation of the Khorrām-Dīnān armies which were led by Pāpak Khorram-Din. This was an uprising of Persians aimed at overthrowing the ruling Arabs. When Hashim’s followers began raiding towns and mosques of other Muslims and looting their possessions, the Abbasid caliph sent several commanders to crush the rebellion. Hashim chose to poison himself rather than surrender to the Abbasids, who had set fire to his house. Hashim died in a Persian fort near Kesh. The Khorrām-Dīnān armies continued to exist until the 12th century.

== Cultural references ==
In 1787 Napoleon Bonaparte wrote a two-page short story about Al-Muqanna called &quot;Le Masque prophète&quot;.

The first poem in &quot;Lalla-Rookh&quot; (1817) by Thomas Moore is titled &quot;The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan&quot;, and the character &quot;Mokanna&quot; is modeled loosely on al-Muqanna‘. An 1877 opera, &quot;The Veiled Prophet&quot; by Charles Villiers Stanford, is in turn loosely based on the story of Mokanna as given in &quot;Lalla-Rookh&quot;.

St. Louis businessmen referenced Moore&#x27;s poem in 1878 when they created the Veiled Prophet Organization and concocted a legend of Mokanna as its founder.
For many years the organization put on an annual fair and parade called the &quot;Veiled Prophet Fair&quot;, which was renamed Fair Saint Louis in 1992. The organization also gave a debutante ball each December called the Veiled Prophet Ball.

The Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm (founded 1889), often known as &quot;the Grotto&quot;, a social group with membership restricted to Master Masons, and its female auxiliary, the Daughters of Mokanna (founded 1919), also take their names from Thomas Moore&#x27;s poem.

Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges used a fictionalized al-Muqanna‘ as the central character of &quot;The Masked Dyer, Hakim of Merv&quot;, a 1934 short story, and in another story fifteen years later, &quot;The Zahir&quot;, as a past avatar of the titular object.

Sax Rohmer used the legend of el Mokanna as the background for his 1934 novel, &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot;.

Iranian film director Khosrow Sinai has a film script about al-Muqanna entitled &quot;Sepidjāmeh&quot; (&quot;The Man in White&quot;) published in Tehran in 1999.

<text>Simplon () is a station on Line 4 of the Paris Métro, located in the 18th arrondissement.

==History==
The station was opened on 21 April 1908 as part of the first section of the line from Châtelet to Porte de Clignancourt. It takes its name from the &quot;Rue du Simplon&quot;, named after the Simplon Pass in the Lepontine Alps, location of one of the longest railroad tunnels in the world.

In 2018, according to estimates by the RATP, 2,756,818 travelers entered this station, which places it at the 205th position of the metro stations for its attendance.

===Bombings of 1944===
During the night of 20 to 21 April 1944, the station was hit by an Allied aerial bombardment aimed at the Dépôt de La Chapelle, which caused the collapse of the roof onto the track and the platforms.

===2005 fire===
On 6 August 2005, at 16:42, as a southbound MP 59 train heading to Porte d&#x27;Orleans, the then southern terminus of the line, was entering the station, the driver noticed smoke coming out from under the fifth car of a northbound train at the other platform, heading to Porte de Clignancourt. He alerted the controllers of the line, leading to the traction current being cut out and an evacuation being ordered (because of the risk of the fire spreading to other cars, as well as to the other train, now parallel to the fire).

A few minutes later, however, the fire reached the fifth car and spread to the second train. Firefighters, who arrived on the scene very quickly, started to extinguish the fire, which they described as very impressive. The fire was under control around 18:00. It was the combination of a malfunction of the JH electromechanical starting equipment, leading to a blockage of a traction element in the &quot;maximum acceleration&quot; position, as well as a latent failure of a circuit breaker. The rapid rotation of the wheel while the train was stationary caused the tire to overheat, burst, and trigger a fire. The fire revealed an insufficient level of smoke clearance on this portion of the line.

As a result of the fire, the smoke and difficulties in effectively clearing the station lead to suspension of traffic on line 4 between Porte de Clignancourt and Réaumur-Sébastopol, evacuation of the Marcadet – Poissonniers station and, because of the connection, suspension of traffic on line 12 between Trinité – d&#x27;Estienne d&#x27;Orves and the northern terminus at Porte de la Chapelle between 17:18 and 20:59. 19 people were slightly intoxicated by the smoke (one traveler and 18 RATP agents). The burnt trains were towed to the workshops at Saint-Ouen. Traffic resumed on the whole of Line 4 the next morning at 8am, however Simplon station was not served as it was closed for refurbishment, which was completed in February 2006, at which point the station resumed operation.

<text>Psychobiography aims to understand historically significant individuals, such as artists or political leaders, through the application of psychological theory and research.

Through its merging of personality psychology and historical evidence, psychobiography may be considered a historical form of therapeutic case study: it represents a growing field in the realm of biography. Psychopathography is sometimes used as a term to indicate that the person being analyzed was not mentally healthy, &quot;path&quot; coming from &quot;pathos&quot; (πάθος)—Ancient Greek for suffering or illness.

==Background==
Psychobiography is a field within the realms of psychology and biography that analyzes the lives of historically significant individuals through psychological theory and research. Its goal is to develop a better understanding of notable individuals by applying psychological theories to their biographies to further explain the motives behind some of the subjects actions and decisions. Popular subjects of psychobiographies include figures such as Adolf Hitler, Vincent van Gogh, William Shakespeare, Martin Luther King Jr., Abraham Lincoln, and Saddam Hussein. A typical biography is often very descriptive, and tries to record every notable event that happened in a person&#x27;s lifetime, whereas a psychobiography primarily focuses on some particular events, and tries to better understand why they happened. This field&#x27;s potential has not only aided in developing a better understanding to many notable biographies throughout history, but has also inspired direction and insight into the field of psychology.

One of the first great examples of this field&#x27;s utility was Dr. Henry Murray&#x27;s report on the analysis of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s personality during the end of World War II. Forced to psychoanalyze from a distance, Dr. Murray used multiple sources, including Hitler&#x27;s genealogy, Hitler&#x27;s own writings, and biographies of Hitler, so that the Allied forces could understand his personality to better predict his behavior. By applying a theory of personality that consisted of 20 psychogenic needs, Dr. Murray presumed Hitler&#x27;s personality as &quot;counteractive narcism&quot;, and was able to correctly predict the German leader&#x27;s suicide in the face of his country&#x27;s defeat. This work by Dr. Murray not only helped establish personality psychology as a behavioral science, but it also showed how the field of psychobiography could be applied as a means of psychoanalysis.

==Origins and development==
Persons who have been the subject of psychobiographical research include Freud, Adolf Hitler, Sylvia Plath, Carl Jung, Vincent van Gogh, Martin Luther, Abraham Lincoln, Elvis Presley, Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Andrew Jackson, and Richard Nixon.

Major psychobiographical authors include Erik Erikson, James William Anderson, Henry Murray, George Atwood, and William Runyan.

Many psychobiographies are Freudian or psychodynamic in orientation, but other commonly used theories include narrative models of identity such as the life story model, script theory, object relations, and existentialism/phenomenology; and psychobiographers are increasingly looking for explanatory complexity through an eclectic approach.

Though there were other psychobiographies written before Freud&#x27;s &quot;Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood&quot; in 1910, it is considered the most significant contribution of its time, despite its flaws. Psychobiographies about William Shakespeare (Jones, 1910), Giovanni Segantini (Abraham, 1912), Richard Wagner (Graf, 1911), Amenhotep IV (Abraham, 1912), Martin Luther (Smith, 1913), and Socrates (Karpas, 1915) were also published between 1910 and 1915, but are not as well known. Between 1920 and 1926, psychobiographies of Margaret Fuller (Anthony, 1920), Samuel Adams (Harlow, 1923), Edgar Allan Poe (Krutch, 1926), and Abraham Lincoln (Clark, 1923) were published by authors from a psychoanalytic perspective without a background in psychoanalysis. During the 1930s Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Molière, Sand, Goethe, Coleridge, Nietzsche, Poe, Rousseau, Caesar, Lincoln, Napoleon, Darwin, and Alexander the Great were the subjects of psychobiographies, and soon afterward in 1943 a psychobiography of Adolf Hitler, predicting his suicide, was written during World War II, but was not published until 1972. Recent, significant contributions between 1960 and 1990 include psychobiographies of Henry James (Edel, 1953–72), Isaac Newton (Manuel, 1968), Mohandas Gandhi (Erikson, 1969), Max Weber (Mitzman, 1969), Emily Dickinson (Cody, 1971), Joseph Stalin (Tucker, 1973), James and John Stuart Mill (Mazlish, 1975), T. E. Lawrence (Mack, 1976), Adolf Hitler (Waite, 1977), Beethoven (Solomon, 1977), Samuel Johnson (Bate, 1977), Alice James (Strouse, 1980), Wilhelm Reich (Sharaf, 1983), and William James (Feinstein, 1984). Some psychobiographies at this time were also written about groups of people, focusing on an aspect they had in common such as American presidents, philosophers, utopians, revolutionary leaders, and personality theorists. These psychobiographies are the most well known, but since 1910 there have been over 4000 psychobiographies published.

As psychobiography gained recognition, authors from a variety of professions contributed their own work from alternate perspectives and varying methods of analysis of the psychobiographical subjects, significantly expanding psychobiography beyond the psychoanalytical perspective. Apart from psychoanalysts and psychiatrists who wrote the first psychobiographies, there have been historians, political scientists, personality psychologists, literary critics, sociologists, and anthropologists that have contributed to the growth of the field.
Psychobiography has also conflicted with contemporary views of science since its origin because it contains no controlled variables or experimentation. In its early years it was dismissed as unscientific and not a legitimate addition to the field of psychology due to the push towards experimentation focused on physiological and biological factors, and away from philosophical psychology, to establish it as a natural science. The value of psychobiography to psychology is comparable to forensic science and archaeology, offering detailed analyses of subjects with an emphasis on contextual information, but due to the qualitative nature of this information it remains a challenge to validate psychobiographical works as empirically based applications of psychology.

==Methodology==
The discipline of psychobiography has developed various methodological guidelines for psychobiographical study. Some of the most prominent are these:

# The use of prototypical scenes in the life of the subject to serve as a model of their personality pattern
# The use of a series of indicators of salience, markers such as primacy, frequency, and uniqueness of an event in a life, to identify significant patterns
# The identification of pregnant metaphors or images that organize autobiographical narratives
# Logical coherence or consistency as a criterion for adequate psychological interpretations

Scholars untrained in the discipline who do not follow these guidelines continue to produce psychobiographical studies.

==Contributors==
===Sigmund Freud===
Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytic approach (Freudian perspective) is not commonly used in its entirety in psychobiography, but it has had a lasting influence on the analysis of behavior in other areas of psychology. To sift through a lifetime of information and locate significant areas in the subject&#x27;s development requires a system of identification, and psychoanalysis provided the base for this. Primacy, the initial exposure or experience, was recognized by Freud as an important factor in personality development and has remained an important aspect of personality psychology, psychotherapy, and psychobiography. Frequency, repeated exposure or actions, is also important, but its significance can vary. If the frequency of an action is low then it is seen as unimportant, and if the frequency is too high it becomes passive and overlooked, also becoming less important in psychobiography. Freud&#x27;s knowledge of the importance of frequency is shown in the analysis of dreams, slips, errors, and humor by recognizing that repetition leads people to disregard these behaviors or stimuli. The importance of error in psychobiography, including slips and distortions, is also rooted in Freudian psychoanalysis and is used to identify hidden motives.

===Elms===
Elms has contributed to psychobiography through many published works including psychobiographies on Allport (1972), Freud (1980), Skinner (1981), and Murray (1987). He has also written about the subject of psychobiography in &quot;Psychobiography and Case Study Methods&quot; and &quot;Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology&quot; defining psychobiography and its methods, and explaining the value of psychobiography in psychology.

==Criticism==
Psychobiography has faced criticism from the very start, crystallised above all in the production of what Erikson caricatured as &quot;originology&quot;—the explaining away of significant public events and actions as the product of some minute childhood detail.

Bad psychobiography—using mechanical psychologising, a selective mining of the facts, overdeterminism, and a tendency to pathologise—is considered easy to write. The haphazard historical evolution of the discipline has not helped reduce its prevalence.

<text>Château Rouge () is a station on Line 4 of the Paris Métro in the 18th arrondissement.

The station opened on 21 April 1908 as part of the first section of the line from Châtelet to Porte de Clignancourt. It is named for the &quot;Place du Château Rouge&quot;, named for a handsome residence of red bricks built nearby in 1760 and demolished in 1875. The nearby Goutte d&#x27;Or district is a vibrant, multicultural area and the &quot;Rue Dejean&quot; street market operates every day except Monday.

==Crime==
Since the late 2000s the area is known for pickpocketing and trade of stolen goods, especially mobile phones picked from unaware tourists around Sacré-Cœur and Barbès.

On 20 July 2021, six people were injured after a woman stuck her shopping trolley in the escalator at the station.

<text>Abel Valdemarsen (c. 1218 – 29 June 1252) was Duke of Schleswig from 1232 to 1252 and King of Denmark from 1250 until his death in 1252. He was the son of Valdemar II by his second wife, Berengaria of Portugal, and brother to kings Eric IV and Christopher I.

As Duke of Schleswig, Abel came into conflict with his brother, King Eric IV, whose murder in 1250 he was suspected of orchestrating. Upon taking an oath to clear himself of the allegations, he was elected king. After a short reign, he was killed during a military expedition in Frisia.

Abel&#x27;s reign was the shortest of any Danish monarch since the 9th century. He founded a line of dukes of Schleswig - the &quot;Abel family&quot; - which ruled the Duchy of Schleswig until 1375.

==Early life==
In 1232, at the election of his elder brother Eric as their father, King Valdemar II&#x27;s co-ruler and heir, Abel was chosen to succeed Eric in his position as Duke of Schleswig.

In 1237 he married Matilda of Holstein, a daughter of Adolf IV of Holstein (1205-1261). As Count Adolf withdrew to a Franciscan friary the same year, Abel spent several years acting as regent for his under age brothers-in-law, John I of Holstein-Kiel (1229–1263) and Gerhard I, Count of Holstein-Itzehoe (1232–1290).

==Duke of Schleswig==
In early 1241, Abel commanded a Crusader and invaded the Orthodox Novgorod, yet was to suspend the campaign because of his father, Valdemar II&#x27;s, death.

At the death of Valdemar II in 1241, Duke Abel&#x27;s brother Eric acceded to the throne of Denmark as Eric IV. In the following years, Duke Abel fought against his brother, trying to gain independence for the Duchy of Schleswig. He raided north as far as Randers, ravaging Eric&#x27;s supporters, and then moved into Funen. Eric struck back a year later, surprising Abel&#x27;s garrison at Schleswig, forcing Abel&#x27;s young daughter Sophie to flee &quot;without so much as a pair of shoes for her feet.&quot;

The fighting continued until Abel&#x27;s sister Sophie of Denmark (c. 1217–1247), wife of John I, Margrave of Brandenburg (c. 1213–1266) brokered a truce between Duke Abel and King Eric that held until 1250 when Eric was murdered while a guest at Duke Abel&#x27;s residence at Schleswig.

==King==
Eric IV was slain by Abel&#x27;s chamberlain, Lage Gudmundsen (ca. 1195–1252), and others; the king&#x27;s headless body dumped into the Schlei.
Even though Abel and twenty-four noblemen swore an official oath (&quot;dual dozen&#x27;s oath&quot;, in Danish &quot;dobbelt tylvter-ed&quot;) that the Duke had no part in the killing, it was widely believed that King Eric was murdered at his brother&#x27;s bidding. &quot;Abel by name, Cain by his deeds&quot; (Danish, &quot;Abel af navn, Kain af gavn&quot;), or so people said.

==Death==
After clearing himself of the allegations taking the oath, Abel was proclaimed King of Denmark at the Viborg Assembly (Danish: landsting) on 1 November 1250. Abel only ruled for a year and a half. King Abel received word that the peasants in Frisia, led by Sicko Sjaerdema of Friesland, refused to pay the tax levy. Abel raised an army to punish them. At 33, he was killed by a wheelwright named Henner on Husum Bridge near Eiderstedt on 29 June 1252.

At the time, Abel&#x27;s half-grown son Valdemar (1238–1257) was held for ransom by the Archbishop of Cologne. So, Abel&#x27;s youngest brother Christopher I was crowned King on Christmas Day 1252 in Lund Cathedral.

After Abel&#x27;s death, Queen Matilda entered a convent but subsequently bypassed her vows there to marry Swedish statesman Birger Jarl in 1261. Birger was an enemy of Abel&#x27;s, and not long before Abel&#x27;s death, Birger had started up a military vendetta against him which was only called off when the Danish king died.

==Legacy==

Most people at the time viewed Abel&#x27;s sudden death as God&#x27;s judgment on him for the murder of his brother. As Abel&#x27;s body lay in Schleswig Cathedral, the monks heard strange sounds in the church at night. They said they were too afraid to go into the church after that. They believed that Abel&#x27;s unholy ghost walked abroad at night. Consequently, the king&#x27;s body was taken outside the church and stuffed into a soggy grave near Gottorp Castle outside Schleswig. Someone rammed a wooden stake through Abel&#x27;s chest to make sure he remained in his grave. It was said long after that the king&#x27;s ghost found no peace, and from time to time, there were reports of &quot;Abel&#x27;s wild hunt&quot; where a black-faced man on a white horse and glowing hounds hunted across the moors and forest of Schleswig.

Abel&#x27;s descendants — the &quot;Abel Family&quot; — ruled South Jutland until 1375, often in co-operation with their relatives in Holstein. They created a permanent problem for the Danish government. Their rule meant the eventual separation of Frisia, Holstein, and most of Schleswig from the rest of Denmark. His great-grandson succeeded briefly as Valdemar III before being deposed. However, Abel&#x27;s descendants would return to the throne with his great-granddaughter Helvig of Schleswig, who married Valdemar IV. Even though the line of Helvig died out with Christopher III, his successor Christian I was a descendant of Abel&#x27;s through his daughter Sophie. Except for Christopher I through Valdemar IV, all subsequent Danish monarchs have been Abel&#x27;s cognatic descendants.

==Marriage and issue==

On stage, Gatiss played Menenius in the revival of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Coriolanus&quot; (2013) for which he earned a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role nomination. He took on the role of King George III in a revival of the Alan Bennett play &quot;The Madness of George III&quot; (2018).

His other theatre roles include in &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot; (2012), &quot;The Vote&quot; (2015), and &quot;A Christmas Carol: A Ghost Story&quot; (2021).

==Early life and education==
Gatiss was born in Sedgefield, County Durham, England, to Winifred Rose (née O&#x27;Kane, 1931–2003) and Maurice Gatiss (1931–2021). He grew up opposite the Victorian psychiatric hospital Winterton, and later in Trimdon, before his father, a colliery engineer, took a job as engineer at the School Aycliffe Mental Hospital in Heighington. His family background is working class. His passions included watching &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and Hammer Horror films on television, reading Sherlock Holmes and H. G. Wells, and collecting fossils. All those interests have influenced his creative work.

Gatiss attended Heighington Church of England Primary School, and Woodham Comprehensive School in Newton Aycliffe. At the latter, he was two years ahead of Paul Magrs, who also went on to write &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction. Gatiss then studied Theatre Arts at Bretton Hall College, an arts college affiliated to the University of Leeds.

==Career==
===1999–2005: Career beginnings===

Gatiss is a member of the sketch comedy team &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; (along with fellow performers Reece Shearsmith, Steve Pemberton and co-writer Jeremy Dyson). He first met his co-writers and performers at Bretton Hall, Yorkshire, a drama school which he attended after finishing school and having spent a gap year travelling around Europe. &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; began as a stage act in 1995, which won the Perrier Award at Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1997. In the same year the show transferred to BBC Radio 4 as &quot;On the Town with the League of Gentlemen&quot;, and later arrived on television on BBC Two in 1999. The television programme has earned Gatiss and his colleagues a British Academy Television Award, a Royal Television Society Award and the prestigious Golden Rose of Montreux. In 2005, the film &quot;The League of Gentlemen&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot; was released, to generally positive reviews.

Shearsmith and Pemberton reunited in 2009 to create a similarly dark BBC sitcom, &quot;Psychoville&quot;, which featured an episode guest-starring Gatiss. The three reunited again in 2012 to film a series of sketches for the fourth series of CBBC show &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;.

Outside &quot;The League&quot;, Gatiss&#x27; television work has included writing for the 2001 revival of &quot;Randall &amp; Hopkirk&quot; and script editing the popular sketch show &quot;Little Britain&quot; in 2003, making guest appearances in both. In 2001 he guested in &quot;Spaced&quot; as a villainous government employee modelled on the character of Agent Smith from &quot;The Matrix&quot; film series. In the same year he appeared in several editions of the documentary series &quot;SF:UK&quot;. Other acting appearances include the comedy-drama &quot;In the Red&quot; (BBC Two, 1998), the macabre sitcom &quot;Nighty Night&quot; (BBC Three, 2003), &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot; as Ronald Hawes in &quot;The Murder at the Vicarage&quot;, a guest appearance in the Vic &amp; Bob series &quot;Catterick&quot; in 2004 and the live 2005 remake of the classic science fiction serial &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;. A second series of &quot;Nighty Night&quot; and the new comedy-drama &quot;Funland&quot;, the latter co-written by his &quot;League&quot; cohort Jeremy Dyson, both featured Gatiss and aired on BBC Three in the autumn of 2005. He appeared as Johnnie Cradock, alongside &quot;Nighty Night&quot; star Julia Davis as Fanny Cradock, in &quot;Fear of Fanny&quot; on BBC Four in October 2006, and featured as Ratty in a new production of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; shown on BBC One on 1 January 2007. He wrote and starred in the BBC Four docudrama &quot;The Worst Journey in the World&quot;, based on the memoir by polar explorer Apsley Cherry-Garrard.

Gatiss appears frequently in BBC Radio productions, including the science fiction comedy &quot;Nebulous&quot; and &quot;The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; story &quot;The Shameful Betrayal of Miss Emily Smith&quot;. In 2009, he was The Man in Black when BBC Radio 7 revived the character (originally played by Valentine Dyall and Edward de Souza) to introduce a series of five creepy audio dramas. He is also involved with theatre, having penned the play &quot;The Teen People&quot; in the early 1990s, and appeared in a successful run of the play &quot;&#x27;Art&#x27;&quot; in 2003 at the Whitehall Theatre in London. In film, he has starred in &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot; (2004) and had minor roles in &quot;Birthday Girl&quot; (2001), &quot;Bright Young Things&quot; (2003), &quot;Match Point&quot; (2005) and &quot;Starter for 10&quot; (2006). &quot;The League of Gentlemen&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot;, a film based on the television series, co-written by and starring Gatiss, was released in June 2005. He also plays the recurring character of Gold in the audio revival of &quot;Sapphire and Steel&quot; produced by Big Finish Productions. Gatiss also appeared in Edgar Wright&#x27;s fake trailer for Grindhouse, &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot;, a homage to 1970s&#x27; Hammer Horrors.

=== 2007–2017: &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Sherlock&quot; ===

Gatiss has also made three credited appearances in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. In 2007, he played Professor Lazarus in &quot;The Lazarus Experiment&quot;. In 2011, he returned in the Series 6 episode &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot; as a character known as Gantok, and in the 2017 Christmas special &quot;Twice Upon A Time&quot; as &quot;The Captain&quot;. Also in 2007, he appeared as Robert Louis Stevenson in &quot;Jekyll&quot;, a BBC One serial by his fellow &quot;Doctor Who&quot; scriptwriter Steven Moffat. In 2008, he appeared in &quot;Clone&quot; as Colonel Black. Gatiss also wrote, co-produced and acted in the BBC Four ghost story &quot;Crooked House&quot; (2008).

He appeared in the stage adaptation of Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s &quot;All About My Mother&quot; at the Old Vic in London from 25 August-24 November 2007. He won much critical acclaim for his portrayal of the transgender character Agrado. In the 2008 English language re-release of the cult 2006 Norwegian animated film &quot;Free Jimmy&quot;, Gatiss voiced the character of &quot;Jakki,&quot; a heavy-set, bizarrely dressed biker member of the &quot;Lappish Mafia.&quot; In this his voice is used along with the other actors of &quot;League of Gentlemen&quot; such as Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. The dialogue was written by Simon Pegg and other actors included Pegg himself, Woody Harrelson and David Tennant, who worked with Gatiss on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He was scheduled to perform in &quot;Darker Shores&quot; by Michael Punter, a ghost story for all the family, at Hampstead Theatre 3 December 2009 – 16 January 2010 but had to withdraw after a serious family illness. Tom Goodman-Hill took over his role.

In 2010, he portrayed Malcolm McLaren in the BBC drama &quot;Worried About the Boy&quot; which focused on the life and career of Boy George. He adapted H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot; into a television film of the same name for the BBC, also playing Professor Cavor. He also made a three-part BBC documentary series entitled &quot;A History of Horror&quot;, a personal exploration of the history of horror cinema. This was followed on 30 October 2012 with a look at European horror with the documentary &quot;Horror Europa&quot;. In March 2010, he was a guest on &quot;Private Passions&quot;, the biographical music discussion programme on BBC Radio 3. From December 2010 to March 2011, Gatiss was playing the role of Bernard in Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Season&#x27;s Greetings&quot; at the Royal National Theatre in London alongside Catherine Tate. In December 2011, he appeared in an episode of &quot;The Infinite Monkey Cage&quot; in an episode entitled &quot;The Science of Christmas&quot;, alongside Brian Cox, Robin Ince and Richard Dawkins. In January 2012, he took the role of Brazen in &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot; at the Donmar Theatre, London. From 18 October – 24 November that year he was Charles I in the Hampstead Theatre production of &quot;55 Days&quot; by Howard Brenton, a play dramatising the military coup that killed a King and forged a Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell.

With Steven Moffat, with whom Gatiss worked on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Jekyll&quot;, he also co-created and co-produced &quot;Sherlock&quot; (2010) starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. He also portrayed Mycroft Holmes in the series. Gatiss had influence on all episodes as producer and he wrote four episodes, one for each series: the finale, &quot;The Great Game&quot; for the first series, &quot;The Hounds of Baskerville&quot; for the second, &quot;The Empty Hearse&quot; for the third and &quot;The Six Thatchers&quot; for the fourth. He also co-wrote &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot;, a mini-episode released in late December 2013 which acts as a prelude to the third series, with Steven Moffat; the episode &quot;The Sign of Three&quot; with Moffat and Steve Thompson; and &quot;The Abominable Bride&quot;, a special episode released in early January 2016, with Moffat. Finally, he co-wrote the final episode of Sherlock, &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, with Moffat, released in January 2017.

In December 2013, Gatiss joined the cast of the Donmar Warehouse production of &quot;Coriolanus&quot; as Senator of Rome, Menenius. The play went from 6 December 2013 through 13 February 2014. For his performance, Gatiss received a nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. On 25 December 2013, a version of the ghost story &quot;The Tractate Middoth&quot; by M. R. James and adapted by Gatiss was broadcast on BBC Two as part of the long-running &quot;A Ghost Story for Christmas&quot; series. It starred Sacha Dhawan, John Castle, Louise Jameson, Una Stubbs, David Ryall, Eleanor Bron, Nick Burns and Roy Barraclough. It was followed on 25 December 2013 by a screening on BBC2 of a new documentary by Gatiss titled &quot;M. R. James: Ghost Writer&quot;. The programme saw Gatiss explore the work of James and look at how his work still inspires contemporary horror today.

He appeared in season four of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; in 2014 playing Tycho Nestoris and reprised this role in season five and season seven. In the BBC&#x27;s 2015 series &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;, Gatiss played King Henry VIII&#x27;s secretary Stephen Gardiner. He also appeared in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Coalition&quot; in 2015.
In 2016, he played Harold in the groundbreaking American play The Boys in the Band, play at Park Theatre (London) opposite his husband Ian Hallard. They made history when the play transferred to the Vaudeville Theatre in 2017 as the first married gay couple to appear together on a West End stage.

Gatiss appeared as the Prince Regent (later George IV) in the eight-part historical fiction television drama series &quot;Taboo&quot; (2017) first broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2017 and in the United States on FX on 10 January 2017. In May 2017, Gatiss began a recurring role on &quot;The Secret History of Hollywood&quot;, a series of podcast biopics on Golden Age-era Hollywood. Its 11-part series, &quot;Shadows&quot; tells the story of Val Lewton&#x27;s life and career, with Gatiss providing the introductions for each episode.

=== 2018–present: Theatre roles and expansion ===

In November 2018, Gatiss portrayed the lead, King George III in a revival of the Alan Bennet play &quot;The Madness of George III&quot; at Nottingham Playhouse. The production was broadcast live to cinemas as part of National Theatre Live. Kate Maltby of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote of his performance, &quot;Productions of The Madness of George III live or die by their star, and Gatiss delivers a tour de force. This is a viscerally repulsive depiction of the gap between public and private life.&quot;
That same year he played a supporting role as John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough in the Yorgos Lanthimos directed black comedy &quot;The Favourite&quot; (2018) starring Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, and Rachel Weisz. Also in 2018 he acted in the children&#x27;s film &quot;Christopher Robin&quot; starring Ewan McGregor and &quot;The Mercy&quot; with Colin Firth. In 2020 he acted opposite Anthony Hopkins in the film &quot;The Father&quot; based on the Florian Zeller play &quot;Le Père&quot;. In October 2021, Gatiss wrote and played Jacob Marley in a new adaptation of &quot;A Christmas Carol – A Ghost Story&quot; by Charles Dickens playing at both Nottingham Playhouse and Alexandra Palace in 2021.

He appeared as a modern-day incarnation/descendant of Count Dracula&#x27;s servile companion Renfield in the series of his own co-creation, &quot;Dracula&quot; in the third and final episode, &quot;The Dark Compass&quot;. In 2017, Gatiss and Steven Moffat re-teamed to write three episodes for TV miniseries &quot;Dracula&quot;. The series premiered on BBC One on 1 January 2020, and was broadcast over three consecutive days. The three episodes were then released on Netflix on 4 January 2020. In June 2021, a new adaptation of &quot;The Ghosts&quot; by Antonia Barber, written and directed by Gatiss for Sky One, was announced. It broadcast on 24 December. In 2021 he acted in the British war film &quot;Operation Mincemeat&quot; portraying Ivor Montagu. That same year he acted in &quot;Locked Down&quot;, &quot;The Road Dance&quot;, and &quot;The Sparks Brothers&quot;. He joined the acting in action film &quot;&quot; (2023) starring Tom Cruise.

In May 2022, Gatiss directed &quot;The Unfriend&quot;, a new play by Steven Moffat at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester, starring Amanda Abbington, Frances Barber and Reece Shearsmith. The play transferred to London&#x27;s West End Criterion Theatre in January 2023. In February 2023, Gatiss directed &quot;The Way Old Friends Do&quot; a new play by Ian Hallard at the Birmingham Rep. This also transferred to the Criterion in August. In April 2022, Gatiss starred as Lawrence in the seventh series opener of &quot;Inside No. 9&quot;. In April 2023, Gatiss played as Sir John Gielgud in &quot;The Motive and the Cue&quot;, a new play written by Jack Thorne and directed by Sam Mendes at London&#x27;s National Theatre. The story of how Richard Burton (played by Johnny Flynn) and Gielgud clashed as they staged &quot;Hamlet&quot; on Broadway in 1964, the play has received good reviews, particularly the two leads. Leonie Cooper of &quot;Time Out&quot; wrote of his performance, &quot;Mark Gatiss launches himself into a condescending but sensitive Gielgud...[who] is just as impressive, his uncanny Gielgud manifesting a man in flux, as a new era of performance threatens to subsume his traditional take on stagecraft. Gatiss&#x27;s Gielgud is lonely and lost, but still more than capable of getting one over on the wayward Burton.&quot; For his performance Gatiss won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor.

Filming got underway in Belgium in April 2024 on &quot;Bookish&quot;, which Gatiss co-wrote and stars. He will also be appearing in &quot;&quot;, set for debut in 2025.

== Writing for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; ==

At the age of eleven, Gatiss won a school literary competition with a short science fiction story &quot;The Anti-Noise Machine&quot;, published in a booklet by Darlington Borough Council. Gatiss had a childhood interest in the BBC science-fiction show &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and devoted much of his early writing to the series, despite its 1989 cancellation. Gatiss&#x27;s earliest published work as a professional writer was a sequence of novels in Virgin Publishing&#x27;s &quot;New Adventures&quot; series of continuation stories and novels. In these works, he tried to correct the problems which had led to the show&#x27;s decline in the late 1980s. The first television scripts Gatiss wrote were for a BBV direct-to-video series called &quot;P.R.O.B.E.&quot; Gatiss&#x27;s four scripts each featured a different actor who had played &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s titular character of the Doctor: Jon Pertwee, Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy. The videos have since been released on DVD despite Gatiss once commenting that he would not authorise their re-release, as he regarded them as a learning exercise. His other early contributions to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; franchise included four novels, two audio plays for BBV and two audio plays for Big Finish Productions.

Gatiss has written nine episodes for the 2005 revival of the show. His first, &quot;The Unquiet Dead,&quot; was the third episode of the revived series in 2005; the second, &quot;The Idiot&#x27;s Lantern,&quot; aired the following year in the second series. Although he acted in the third series and proposed an ultimately unproduced episode for the fourth, involving Nazis and the British Museum, it took until 2010 for Gatiss to return as writer. He wrote &quot;Victory of the Daleks&quot; for that year&#x27;s fifth series and went on to contribute &quot;Night Terrors&quot; for series 6, &quot;Cold War&quot; and &quot;The Crimson Horror&quot; for series 7 and &quot;Robot of Sherwood&quot; for series 8. He also wrote &quot;Sleep No More&quot; for series 9 and &quot;Empress of Mars&quot; for series 10. He has also contributed to the franchise outside the main show. His early work (see above) was primarily &quot;Doctor Who&quot; expanded media.

Gatiss wrote and performed in the comedy spoof sketches &quot;The Web of Caves&quot;, &quot;The Kidnappers&quot; and &quot;The Pitch of Fear&quot; for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Doctor Who&quot; Night&quot; in 1999 with David Walliams. He penned the 2013 docudrama &quot;An Adventure in Space and Time&quot;, a drama depicting the origins of the series, to celebrate the show&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary. It ended with a cameo by Gatiss&#x27;s &quot;League of Gentleman&quot; castmate Reece Shearsmith, portraying Patrick Troughton, who played the Second Doctor. A &quot;Making Of&quot; feature about this programme, narrated by Gatiss, was made available on the BBC Red Button service, and also posted on the BBC&#x27;s official YouTube channel. He has written for &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, including a column written under the pseudonym &quot;Sam Kisgart,&quot; which he was originally credited as in the &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; audio play &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; for his role as the Master. &quot;Sam Kisgart&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Mark Gatiss&quot;, and is also the name under which he was credited for his cameo in &quot;Psychoville&quot;.

Novels

Gatiss has written several non-fiction works, including a biography of the film director James Whale and the documentary &quot;M.R. James: Ghost Writer&quot;, which Gatiss also presented. The documentary followed Gatiss&#x27;s directorial debut with an adaption of one of James&#x27;s stories, &quot;The Tractate Middoth&quot;, for BBC Two, which was broadcast on Christmas Day 2013. His first non-&quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel, &quot;The Vesuvius Club&quot;, was published in 2004, for which he was nominated in the category of Best Newcomer in the 2006 British Book Awards. A follow-up, &quot;The Devil in Amber&quot;, was released on 6 November 2006. It transports the main character, Lucifer Box, from the Edwardian era in the first book to the roaring Twenties/Thirties. A third and final Lucifer Box novel, &quot;Black Butterfly&quot;, was published on 3 November 2008 by Simon &amp; Schuster.

==Personal life==
Gatiss was featured on &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;″s Pink List of influential gay people in the UK in 2010, 2011 and 2014. He entered into a civil partnership with actor Ian Hallard in 2008 in Middle Temple, in the City of London. Gatiss once built a Victorian era laboratory in his north London home, as the fulfilment of a childhood dream. Gatiss is an atheist. The University of Huddersfield awarded him an honorary doctorate of letters in 2003. The University of Leeds awarded him an honorary doctorate of laws in 2024.

<text>Gare de l&#x27;Est – Verdun () is a station of the Paris Métro, serving Lines 4, 5, and 7 is located in the 10th arrondissement in Paris, France. It is the fifth busiest station on the network.

==Location==
The metro station consisting of three lines is located in front of the Gare de l&#x27;Est at the intersection of Rue du 8-Mai-1945 and Boulevard de Strasbourg, Line 4 follows a north/south axis and Lines 5 and 7 follow an east / west axis.

==History==
The station was opened on 15 November 1907 as part of the extension of line 5 from &quot;Lancry&quot; (now Jacques Bonsergent) to Gare du Nord. The line 4 platforms were opened on 21 April 1908 as part of the first section of the line from Châtelet to Porte de Clignancourt. The line 7 platforms were opened on 5 November 1910 as part of the first section of the line from Opéra to Porte de la Villette. Lines 5 and 7 are parallel, running as four tracks with an island platform with two side platforms. Line 4 runs under 5 and 7 perpendicularly.

The station bears the name of Gare de l&#x27;Est, the station under which it is built. Its full name is Gare de l&#x27;Est-Verdun, named after the Avenue de Verdun nearby. The name Verdun is in memory of World War I&#x27;s Battle of Verdun to which French soldiers were sent from the railway station.

From September 2006 to June 2007, Gare de l&#x27;Est and its metro station underwent a major renovation thanks to the &quot;Gares en mouvement&quot; and &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; projects, to accommodate a more beautiful and modern station the LGV Est line. On the platforms of Lines 5 and 7, orange tiles and blue paint gave way to traditional white tiles. The lights were also replaced, and the latest model of &quot;smiley&quot; style seating had been installed. Finally, the &quot;Parisine&quot; typeface replaced the &quot;Motte&quot; typeface, symbolizing the end of work on the platform. The new standard signage was installed throughout the station.

Only slight changes occurred on the platforms of Line 4. Apart from the replacement of the orange &quot;Motte&quot; tiles at the ends of the platforms and the passage of a layer of paint on the damaged tile of the vault.

In 2018, it was the fifth busiest metro station in the network, with 21,432,041 passengers passing through the train station.

==Passenger services==

<doc id="504014" wikidata="Q6498273" url="?curid=504014" title="Westernization">
<text>Westernization (or Westernisation, see spelling differences), also [[Europeanisation]] or occidentalization (from the &quot;Occident&quot;), is a process whereby societies come under or adopt what is considered to be Western culture, in areas such as industry, technology, science, education, politics, economics, lifestyle, law, norms, mores, customs, traditions, values, mentality, perceptions, diet, clothing, language, writing system, religion, and philosophy. During colonialism it often involved the spread of Christianity. A related concept is Northernization, which is the consolidation or influence of the Global North.

Westernization has been a growing influence across the world in the last few centuries, with some thinkers assuming Westernization to be the equivalent of modernization, a way of thought that is often debated. The overall process of Westernization is often two-sided in that Western influences and interests themselves are joined with parts of the affected society, at minimum, to become a more Westernized society, with the putative goal of attaining a Western life or some aspects of it, while Western societies are themselves affected by this process and interaction with non-Western groups.

Westernization traces its roots back to Ancient Greece. Later, the Roman Empire took on the first process of Westernization as it was heavily influenced by Greece and created a new culture based on the principles and values of the Ancient Greek society. The Romans emerged with a culture that grew into a new Western identity based on the Greco-Roman society. Westernization can also be compared to acculturation and enculturation. Acculturation is &quot;the process of cultural and psychological change that takes place as a result of contact between cultural groups and their individual members&quot;. 

After contact, changes in cultural patterns are evident within one or both cultures. Specific to Westernization and the non-Western culture, foreign societies tend to adopt changes in their social systems relative to Western ideology, lifestyle, and physical appearance, along with numerous other aspects, and shifts in culture patterns can be seen to take root as a community becomes acculturated to Western customs and characteristics – in other words, Westernized. The phenomenon of Westernization does not follow any one specific pattern across societies as the degree of adaption and fusion with Western customs will occur at varying magnitudes within different communities. Specifically, the extent to which domination, destruction, resistance, survival, adaptation, or modification affect a native culture may differ following inter-ethnic contact.

==Western world==
The West was originally defined as the Western world. A thousand years later, the East-West Schism separated the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church from each other. The definition of Western changed as the West was influenced by and spread to other nations. Islamic and Byzantine scholars added to the Western canon when their stores of Greek and Roman literature jump-started the Renaissance. The Cold War also reinterpreted the definition of the West by excluding the countries of the former Eastern Bloc. Today, most modern uses of the term refer to the societies in the West and their close genealogical, linguistic, and philosophical descendants. Typically included are those countries whose ethnic identity and dominant culture are derived from Western European culture. Though it shares a similar historical background, the Western world is not a monolithic bloc, as many cultural, linguistic, religious, political, and economic differences exist between Western countries and populations.

==Significantly influenced countries==
The following countries or regions experienced a significant influence by the process of Westernization:
*Armenia: Geographically located in the Caucasus region of West Asia, Armenia&#x27;s culture has been increasingly influenced by the process of Westernization. Throughout its history, Armenia has been influenced by Western and Eastern civilizations. Armenia became the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion in 301 AD. The traditional Armenian homeland composed of Eastern Armenia and Western Armenia came under the rule of the Roman, Persian, Arab, Ottoman, and Russian empires. Current Armenia gained its independence in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Today, the Government of Armenia maintains positive relations with Iran, Russia, and the West, including the United States and the EU. The country participates in various organizations linked to the EU, such as the Eastern Partnership, the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly and is a member of the Council of Europe, the European Political Community, the OSCE, the BSEC, La Francophonie, and NATO&#x27;s Partnership for Peace and Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. In 2017, Armenia signed an extensive agreement with the EU; the CEPA agreement further strengthens economic and political ties. Armenia is also a member of various European organisations for sports, education, and cultural events such as UEFA, the European Olympic Committees, and the European Higher Education Area, and participates in the Eurovision Song Contest.
*Azerbaijan: Geographically located in the Caucasus mountain range (natural border between Western Asia and Eastern Europe). Azerbaijan borrowed Western traditions mainly as a result of imperial Russian influence, with the Muslim world&#x27;s first opera and secular democracy being established there before its invasion by the Soviets. Currently, the country participates in various European organizations including the EU&#x27;s Eastern Partnership, the Council of Europe, and GUAM. It is also a member of European organisations for sports such as UEFA and the European Olympic Committees, and regularly participates in the Eurovision Song Contest. Despite this, the country remains an authoritarian regime with considerable human rights and press freedom issues.
*Cape Verde: An insular country in West Africa, Cape Verde has influences of European culture (particularly Portuguese) and, together with the Azores and Madeira (Portugal), and the Canary Islands (Spain), it is part of the archipelagos of Macaronesia. Due to this, the country has shared close diplomatic and cultural relations with both Iberian countries and has even tried to approach Western organizations, like the EU and NATO.
*Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore: Despite their geographical positions in East and Southeast Asia, due to the heavy influences of European heritage (particularly British and Portuguese) culture, they are at-least partially westernized.
*Israel: Although Israel is geographically located in Western Asia, many Western cultural influences were brought in Israel by Jewish settlers from the diaspora, particularly countries like Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It is a member of the OECD. It is often a member of European organisations for sports and cultural events such as UEFA and Eurovision, which is due in large part to Israel&#x27;s ouster from their respective Asian counterparts. According to Sammy Smooha, a professor emeritus of sociology at Haifa University, Israel is described as a &quot;hybrid,&quot; a modern and developed &quot;semi-Western&quot; state. With time, he acknowledged, Israel will become &quot;more and more Western.&quot; But as a result of the ongoing Arab–Israeli conflict, full Westernization will be a slow process in Israel.
*Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan: Although they are geographically located in East Asia, the three countries have westernized themselves by adopting democratic forms of government, free market economic systems, major contributions to Western science and technology, and could be described as &quot;hybrid&quot;, &quot;semi-Western&quot; states. 
*Americas: Most countries in Americas are considered Western countries, largely because most of its peoples are descended from Europeans (Spanish and Portuguese settlers and later immigration from other European nations), and their society operates in a highly Westernized way. Most countries in the Americas use either English, French, Spanish or Portuguese as their official language. According to the &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;, there has also been considerable immigration to South America, particularly to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay, from European nations other than Spain and Portugal (for example, from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, etc.—see Immigration to Argentina, Immigration to Brazil, Immigration to Chile, and Immigration to Uruguay).
*Lebanon: Geographically located in Western Asia, Lebanon is the most Westernized country in the Arab world. In ancient history, Lebanon was ruled by the Hellenistic and Roman empires. Even though it was later ruled by the Caliphate, Lebanon has the highest proportion of Christians in the Arab world, and Christians have dominated the country politically, economically and culturally. Since it was historically a French mandate, France promotes French culture and European-style education in Lebanon. At that time, Beirut was known as the &quot;Little Paris of the Middle East&quot;. Currently, French language is still widely spoken and Lebanon is a member of the Organization of la Francophonie. 
*Philippines: Geographically located in Southeast Asia, due to heavy influences of European (particularly Spanish) and American cultures in Filipino culture, the country is considered Westernized. Moreover, nearly 90% of the Filipino population practices Christianity.
*Turkey: Although geographically only 3% of Turkey lies in Europe (East Thrace) and the rest in Western Asia, Turkey is one of the most Westernized Turkic countries. The country has a similar economic system, has a customs union with the European Union in addition to being an official candidate for membership, and is a member of traditional European &amp; Western organisations such as the OECD, the Council of Europe, and NATO. It is also a member of European organisations for sports such as UEFA and the European Olympic Committees, and has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest. Relations between Turkey and Western countries have been deteriorating since the 2010s.

===Kishore Mahbubani===
Kishore Mahbubani&#x27;s book entitled &quot;The Great Convergence: Asia, the West, and the Logic of One World&quot; (Public Affairs), is very optimistic. It proposes that a new global civilization is being created. The majority of non-Western countries admire and adhere to Western living standards. It says this newly emerging global order has to be ruled through new policies and attitudes. He argues that policymakers all over the world must change their preconceptions and accept that we live in one world. The national interests must be balanced with global interests and the power must be shared. Mahbubani urges that only through these actions can we create a world that converges benignly.

Samuel P. Huntington posits a conflict between &quot;the West and the Rest&quot; and offers three forms of general action that non-Western civilizations can react toward Western countries.
# Non-Western countries can attempt to achieve isolation to preserve their own values and protect themselves from Western invasion. He argues that the cost of this action is high and only a few states can pursue it.
# According to the theory of &quot;band-wagoning&quot; non-Western countries can join and accept Western values.
# Non-Western countries can make an effort to balance Western power through modernization. They can develop economic, and military power and cooperate with other non-Western countries against the West while still preserving their own values and institutions.

Mahbubani counters this argument in his other book, &quot;The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East&quot;. This time, he argues that Western influence is now &quot;unraveling&quot;, with Eastern powers such as China arising. He states:
 He explains the decline of Western influence, stating reasons as to the loss of Western credibility with the rest of the world.
# There is an increasing perception that Western countries will prioritize their domestic problems over international issues, despite their spoken and written promises of having global interests and needs.
# The West has become increasingly biased and close-minded in their perception of &quot;non-Western&quot; countries such as China, declaring it an &quot;un-free&quot; country for not following a democratic form of government. 
# The West uses a double standard when dealing with international issues. 
# As the biggest Eastern populations gain more power, they are moving away from the Western influences they sought after in the past. The &quot;anti-Americanism&quot; sentiment is not temporary, as Westerners like to believe – the change in the Eastern mindset has become far too significant for it to change back.

===Samuel P. Huntington===
In contrast to territorial delineation, others, like the American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington in &quot;The Clash of Civilizations&quot;, consider what is &quot;Western&quot; based on religious affiliation, such as deeming the majority-Western Christian part of Europe and North America the West, and creating 6 other civilizations, including Latin America, Confucian, Japanese, Islamic, Hindu and Slavic-Orthodox, to organize the rest of the globe. Huntington argued that after the end of the Cold War, world politics had been moved into a new aspect in which non-Western civilizations were no more the exploited recipients of Western civilization but become another important actor joining the West to shape and move the world history. Huntington believed that while the age of ideology had ended, the world had only reverted to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.

===Edward Said===
In &quot;Orientalism&quot; Edward Said views Westernization as it occurred in the process of colonization, an exercise of essentializing a &quot;subject race&quot; in order to more effectively dominate them. Said references Arthur Balfour, the British Prime Minister from 1902 to 1905, who regarded the rise of nationalism in Egypt in the late 19th century as counterproductive to a &quot;benevolent&quot; system of occupational rule. Balfour frames his argument in favor of continued rule over the Egyptian people by appealing to England&#x27;s great &quot;understanding&quot; of Egypt&#x27;s civilization and purporting that England&#x27;s cultural strengths complemented and made them natural superiors to Egypt&#x27;s racial deficiencies. Regarding this claim, Said says, &quot;Knowledge to Balfour means surveying a civilization from its origins to its prime to its decline – and of course, it means being able to...The object of such knowledge is inherently vulnerable to scrutiny; this object is a &#x27;fact&#x27; which, if it develops, changes, or otherwise transforms itself...[the civilization] nevertheless is fundamentally, even ontologically stable. To have such knowledge of such a thing is to dominate it.&quot; The act of claiming coherent knowledge of a society in effect objectifies and others it into marginalization, making people who are classified into that race as &quot;almost everywhere nearly the same.&quot; Said also argues that this relationship to the &quot;inferior&quot; races, in fact, works to also fortify and make coherent what is meant by &quot;the West&quot;; if &quot;The Oriental is irrational, depraved (fallen), childlike, &quot;different...&quot; then &quot;...the European is rational, virtuous, mature, normal.&quot; Thus, &quot;the West&quot; acts as a construction in the similar way as does &quot;the Orient&quot; – it is a created notion to justify a particular set of power relations, in this case, the colonization and rule of a foreign country.

==Process==
===Colonization and Europeanization (1400s–1970s)===

From the 1400s onward, Europeanization and colonialism spread gradually over much of the world and controlled different regions during this five centuries long period, colonizing or subjecting the majority of the globe.

Following World War II, Western leaders and academics sought to expand innate liberties and international equality. A period of decolonization began. At the end of the 1960s, most colonies were allowed autonomy. Those new states often adopted some aspects of Western politics such as a constitution, while frequently reacting against Western culture.

===In the Americas and Oceania===

Due to the colonization of the Americas and Oceania by Europeans, the cultural, ethnic, and linguistic make-up of the Americas and Oceania has been changed. This is most visible in settler colonies such as: Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay in the Americas, where the traditional indigenous population has been predominantly replaced demographically by non-indigenous settlers due to transmitted disease and conflict. This demographic takeover in settler countries has often resulted in the linguistic, social, and cultural marginalisation of indigenous people. Even in countries where large populations of indigenous people remain or the indigenous peoples have mixed (mestizo) considerably with European settlers, such as countries in Latin America and the Caribbean: Mexico, Peru, Panama, Suriname, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela, Belize, Paraguay, South Africa, Colombia, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Guyana, El Salvador, Jamaica, Cuba, or Nicaragua, relative marginalisation still exists.

Latin America was shaped by Iberian culture, with local religious forms also mixing with Christian influences. In Mexico, indigenous people adopted writing alongside their traditional oral and pictorial forms of communication.

===In Asia===

General reactions to Westernization can include fundamentalism, protectionism, or embrace to varying degrees. Countries such as Korea and China attempted to adopt a system of isolationism but have ultimately juxtaposed parts of Western culture into their own, often adding original and unique social influences, as exemplified by the introduction of over 1,300 locations of the traditionally Western fast-food chain McDonald&#x27;s into China. Specific to Taiwan, the industry of bridal photography (see Photography in Taiwan) has been significantly influenced by the Western idea of &quot;love&quot;. As examined by author Bonnie Adrian, Taiwanese bridal photos of today provide a striking contrast to past accepted norms, contemporary couples often displaying great physical affection and, at times, placed in typically Western settings to augment the modernity, in comparison to the historically prominent relationship, often stoic and distant, exhibited between bride and groom. Though Western concepts may have initially played a role in creating this cultural shift in Taiwan, the market and desire for bridal photography has not continued without adjustments and social modifications to this Western notion.

====East Asia====

=====China=====
=====Korea=====

In Korea, the first contact with Westernization was during the Joseon Dynasty, in the 17th century. Every year, the emperor dispatched a few envoy ambassadors to China and while they were staying in Beijing, the Western missionaries were there. Through the missionaries, Korean ambassadors were able to adopt Western technology. In the 19th century, Korea started to send ambassadors to the foreign countries, other than Japan and China. While Korea was being Westernized slowly in the late 19th century, Korea had the idea of &quot;Eastern ways and Western frames (東道西器)&quot;, meaning that they accepted the Western &quot;bowl&quot;, but used it with Eastern principles inside.

=====Japan=====
In Japan, the Netherlands continued to play a key role in transmitting Western know-how to the Japanese from the 17th century to the mid-19th century, because the Japanese had only opened their doors to Dutch merchants before US Navy Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s visit in 1853. After Commodore Perry&#x27;s visit, Japan began to deliberately accept Western culture to the point of hiring Westerners to teach Western customs and traditions to the Japanese starting in the Meiji era. Since then, many Japanese politicians have encouraged the Westernization of Japan with the use of the term &quot;Datsu-A Ron&quot;, which means the argument for &quot;leaving Asia&quot; or &quot;Good-bye Asia&quot;. In &quot;Datsu-A Ron&quot;, &quot;Westernization&quot; was described as an &quot;unavoidable&quot; but &quot;fruitful&quot; change. In contrast, despite many advances in industrial efficiency, Japan has sustained a culture of strict social hierarchy and limited individualization.

====South Asia====
=====India=====
At the turn of the 19th century, when India was being conquered by the East India Company, some of its native kingdoms sought Western education to learn how to deal with the threat. India&#x27;s later independence movement also took inspiration from Western ideas about democracy and human rights. India&#x27;s ruling class after independence in 1947 remained somewhat Westernized; India&#x27;s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, had such a substantial Britishness that he once described himself as &quot;the last Englishman to rule India.&quot; In 2014, however, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won power on the back of perceptions of the ruling class being insufficiently Indian.

====Southeast Asia====

=====Thailand=====
Although Thailand is geographically located in Southeast Asia, through the 18th and 19th centuries, Siam faced imperialist pressure from France and the United Kingdom, including many unequal treaties with Western powers and forced concessions of territory; it nevertheless remained the only Southeast Asian country to avoid direct Western colonization. The country became westernized by itself, the Siamese system of government was centralized and initially organized into a modern unitary absolute monarchy during the reign of Chulalongkorn, later as a constitutional monarchy following the Siamese revolution of 1932. In the late 1950s, Thailand became a major ally of the United States, and played a key anti-communist role in the region as a member of the SEATO. Currently, Thailand continues to have strong ties to Western countries.

=====Vietnam=====
Starting from the period of the Nguyễn dynasty as a protectorate of France, the Vietnamese transitioned from chữ Hán and chữ Nôm writing systems to the Vietnamese alphabet (chữ Quốc ngữ). Between the late 19th to early 20th centuries, a number of French style buildings were built in Saigon and Hanoi, becoming two of several locations in Asia claiming to be the Paris of the East. Vietnam is also a member of the International Organisation of La Francophonie. Under the Nguyễn dynasty, Christianity became established as a minority religion for currently around 7% of the population. After the abdication of Emperor Bảo Đại and the August Revolution that took place during the end of World War II, Vietnam would incorporate socialist and American values as it underwent industrialization and economic development during and after the period of political division.

====West Asia====
=====Iran=====
In Iran, the process of Westernization dates back to the country&#x27;s attempt to westernize during the beginning of the 1930s, which was dictated by Shah Rezā Khan and continued by his son during the Cold War and agitated the largely conservative Shia Muslim masses of the country which was partly responsible for the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

=====Turkey=====
In Turkey, the synchronization process with the West is known as the Tanzimat &quot;(reorganization)&quot; period. The Ottoman Empire began to change itself according to modern science, practice, and culture. The Empire took some innovations from the West. Also, with the contribution of foreign engineers, the Empire repaired its old arm systems. Newly-found schools, permanent ambassadors, and privy councils were an essential improvement for the Empire. As a result, Turkey is one of the most Westernized majority-Muslim nations.

===In Europe===
====Russia====
===Globalization (1970s–present)===
Westernization is often regarded as a part of the ongoing process of globalization. This theory proposes that Western thought has led to globalisation, and that globalisation propagates Western culture, leading to a cycle of Westernization. On top of largely Western government systems such as democracy and constitution, many Western technologies and customs like music, clothing, and cars have been introduced across various parts of the world and copied and created in traditionally non-Western countries.

Westernization has been reversed in some countries following war or regime change. For example: Russia in aftermath of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and Iran by the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

The main characteristics are economic and political (free trade) democratisation, combined with the spread of an individualised culture. Often it was regarded as opposite to the worldwide influence of communism. After the break-up of the USSR in late 1991 and the end of the Cold War, many of its component states and allies nevertheless underwent Westernization, including privatization of hitherto state-controlled industry.

With debates still going on, the question of whether globalization can be characterized as Westernization can be seen in various aspects. Globalization is happening in various aspects, ranging from economics, politics, and even food or culture. Westernization, to some schools, is seen as a form of globalization that leads the world to be similar to Western powers. Being globalized means taking positive aspects of the world, but globalization also brings the debate about being Westernized. Democracy, fast food, and American pop culture can all be examples that are considered as Westernization of the world.

According to the &quot;Theory of the Globe scrambled by Social network: a new Sphere of Influence 2.0&quot;, published by Jura Gentium (University of Florence), the increasing role of Westernization is characterized by social media. The comparison with Eastern societies, who decided to ban American social media platforms (such as Iran and China with Facebook and Twitter), marks a political desire to avoid the Westernization process of their own populations and ways to communicate.

==Consequences==

=== Linguistic influence ===
Due to colonization and immigration, the formerly prevalent languages in the Americas, Oceania, and part of South Africa, are now usually Indo-European languages or creoles based on them:
*English (Australia, New Zealand, United States, and Canada without mainly French-speaking Quebec); English along with English-based creole languages (Anglophone Africa, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Grenada, Guyana, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Trinidad and Tobago).
*French (Quebec, New Brunswick and parts of Ontario in Canada and Saint Pierre and Miquelon); French along with French-based creole languages (Francophone Africa, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Vanuatu, Martinique, and Saint-Barthelemy).
*Spanish ( the Americas, Equatorial Guinea, Western Sahara, and the Philippines).
*Portuguese (Brazil, Lusophone Africa, East Timor, Macau, Goa, and other members of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries).
*Dutch along with Creole languages (Suriname, Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles).
*Afrikaans along with English (parts of South Africa and Namibia).
*German along with Creole languages (along with Afrikaans in Namibia and some areas in the US, such as Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania Dutch))

Many indigenous languages are on the verge of becoming extinct. Some settler countries have preserved indigenous languages; for example, in New Zealand, the Māori language is one of three official languages, the others being English and New Zealand sign language, another example is Ireland, where Irish is the first official language, followed by English as the second official language.

=== Sports importance in Westernization ===
The importance of sports partly comes from its connection to Westernization. The insight by Edelman, R., &amp; Wilson, W. (2017) explains “This new system of thought and practices imbued with positive values in the exertion and strategic deployment of the human body, embracing the Anglo-American notion that physical activity was meaningful in and of itself, conducive to values such as learning and character-building. Modern athletics and competitive sports, avatars of this new body culture, elicited largely willing local receptions in North Asia, though there were no doubt isolated cases of coercive foisting better characterized as cultural imperialism.”

<text>Oceanair was a regional airline that was based at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It competed on domestic routes with Prinair; and on routes to the Virgin Islands with Prinair and with Aero Virgin Islands; using propeller-driven aircraft.

The airline flew from the late 1970s, when it started flying as Trans Commuter Airline, to the mid-1980s.

According to the Oceanair February 15, 1982 system timetable, the airline operated up to thirteen flights a day between San Juan and St. Thomas, up to nine flights a day between San Juan and St. Croix, and two flights a day between St. Thomas and St. Croix. The airline was operating 40-passenger Fairchild F-27s and 10-passenger Beechcraft Queen Airs at this time.

==Fleet==
The fleet consisted of Fairchild F-27 and CASA 212 turboprops as well as Beechcraft Queen Air piston-engine light aircraft.

==In popular culture==
Oceanair was featured on Los Chicos&#x27; movie, &quot;Coneccion Caribe&quot;.

<doc id="504017" wikidata="Q206315" url="?curid=504017" title="Christopher I of Denmark">
<text>Christopher I () (1219 – 29 May 1259) was King of Denmark between 1252 and 1259. He was the son of Valdemar II of Denmark by his second wife, Berengaria of Portugal. He succeeded his brothers Eric IV Plovpenning and Abel of Denmark on the throne. Christopher was elected king upon the death of his older brother Abel in the summer of 1252. He was crowned at Lund Cathedral on Christmas Day 1252.

==King of Denmark==
Christopher began organizing the effort to have his brother Erik IV Plovpenning canonized, laying his murder directly at the feet of his other brother Abel of Denmark. If recognized by the pope, the murder would exclude Abel&#x27;s sons from the succession and guarantee Christopher&#x27;s own sons Denmark&#x27;s crown. This meant that Christopher as a younger son tried to keep the sons of his older brothers from ruling Denmark, which went against prevailing customs.

The king spent most of his reign fighting his many opponents. By allowing Abel&#x27;s son, Valdemar Abelsøn, to be Duke of Schleswig he prevented an all-out civil war, but became the target of intrigue and treachery. Southern Jutland including Schleswig and Holstein were independent from the king&#x27;s rule for a time. Christopher also gained a ferocious enemy in the newly named Archbishop of Lund, Jacob Erlandsen, who was closely connected with Abel&#x27;s family. Erlandsen asserted his rights often at odds with the king. King Christopher insisted that the church pay taxes like any other land owner. Bishop Jacob refused and went so far as to forbid peasants who lived or worked on church properties to give military service to King Christopher. Erlandsen was perhaps the wealthiest man in the kingdom and insisted that the secular government have no control or hold over the church, its property, or ecclesiastical personnel. He simply excommunicated the king to show that he wasn&#x27;t about to surrender to the king&#x27;s will.

After an incursion into Halland by Haakon IV of Norway, in 1256, Christopher was reconciled with the kings of Norway and Sweden which had been provoked by Abel&#x27;s interventions. There were peasant uprisings against King Christopher the same year and again in 1258 as a result of Christopher&#x27;s new property tax. Archbishop Jacob refused to recognize Christopher&#x27;s young son, Eric, as Denmark&#x27;s rightful heir in 1257 and threatened excommunication against any bishop who anointed the prince as king of Denmark. That was the last straw. He ordered Bishop Erlandsen&#x27;s own brother to arrest the troublesome archbishop. Christopher humiliated the proud and powerful Archbishop Jakob by forcing him to wear secular clothing and a fool&#x27;s cap with a fox tail attached. The archbishop was paraded through the country to Hagenskov near Assens where he was chained and cast into prison. Erlandsen had ordered at a Vejle church council that if he was imprisoned that the bishops were to declare interdict against the whole country, but none of them did. Bishop of Roskilde Peder Bang fled to Rügen and convinced Chief Jaromar II to invade Zealand.

Christopher tried to have his brother Eric IV canonized, but without Archbishop Jacobs&#x27; support it came to naught. When Duke Valdemar died, King Christopher tried to prevent Valdemar&#x27;s brother, Eric Abelsøn, from taking the duke&#x27;s place. Valdemar&#x27;s widow encouraged a few counts of northern Germany to rebel. In the confusion, Christopher fled to Southern Jutland to stay with the Bishop of Ribe.

The King died unexpectedly after taking Holy Communion. According to contemporary sources, King Christopher died after drinking poisoned communion wine from the hands of abbot Arnfast of Ryd Abbey in revenge for his mistreatment of Archbishop Erlendsen and the king&#x27;s oppression of the church. King Christopher&#x27;s excommunication had no effect, and he was buried in front of the high altar of Ribe Cathedral immediately after his death on 29 May 1259. The king may have died of natural causes; Christopher&#x27;s allies, however, called him &quot;Krist-Offer&quot; (&quot;Christ&#x27;s sacrifice&quot;). Christopher was succeeded by his son Eric, as Eric V of Denmark.

==Legacy==
The Danehof became an institution during his rule. It functioned like a national council which had limited advisory and judicial functions.

Christopher married Margaret Sambiria, the daughter of Count Sambor II of Pomerania, in 1248 and had at least three children:
*King Eric V of Denmark. (1249–1286)
*Niels (d. 21 December 1259), died young
*Valdemar, died young
*Matilda (1250–1299/1300), married to Albert III, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel
*Margaret (c. 1257–1306), married to John II, Count of Holstein-Kiel

<text>Paul Nicolai Hartmann (; 20 February 1882 – 9 October 1950) was a Baltic German philosopher. He is regarded as a key representative of critical realism and as one of the most important twentieth-century metaphysicians.

==Biography==
Hartmann was born a Baltic German in Riga, which was then the capital of the Governorate of Livonia in the Russian Empire, and which is now in Latvia. He was the son of the engineer Carl August Hartmann and his wife Helene, born Hackmann. He attended from 1897 the German-language high school in Saint Petersburg. In the years 1902–1903 he studied Medicine at the University of Yuryev (now Tartu), and 1903–1905 classical philology and philosophy at the Saint Petersburg Imperial University with his friend Vasily Sesemann. In 1905 he went to the University of Marburg, where he studied with the neo-Kantians Hermann Cohen and Paul Natorp. In Marburg began a lifelong friendship with Heinz Heimsoeth. In 1907 he received his doctorate with the thesis &quot;Das Seinsproblem in der griechischen Philosophie vor Plato&quot; (&quot;The Problem of Being in Greek Philosophy Before Plato&quot;). In 1909 he published the book &quot;Platos Logik des Seins&quot; (&quot;The Logic of Being in Plato&quot;). The same year he completed his habilitation on Proclus: &quot;Des Proklus Diadochus philosophische Anfangsgründe der Mathematik&quot; (&quot;Proclus Diadochus&#x27; Philosophical Elements of Mathematics&quot;).

In 1911, Hartmann married Alice Stepanitz, with whom he had a daughter, Dagmar, in 1912. In 1912 he published &quot;Die philosophischen Grundfragen der Biologie&quot; (&quot;The Philosophical Foundations of Biology&quot;). From 1914 to 1918 he did military service as an interpreter, letter censor, and intelligence officer. In 1919, i.e., after the war, he received a position as &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in Marburg. Around this time he met Martin Heidegger. In 1920 he became Associate Professor (&quot;außerordentlicher Professor&quot;) and in 1921 appeared the work that established him as an independent philosophical thinker, &quot;Grundzüge einer Metaphysik der Erkenntnis&quot; (&quot;Foundation of a Metaphysics of Knowledge&quot;). The following year he became Full Professor (&quot;ordentlicher Professor&quot;) as successor of the Chair held by Natorp. In 1925, he moved to Cologne, where he came into contact with Max Scheler. In 1926 he published his second major work—&quot;Ethik&quot;—in which he develops a material value ethics akin to that of Scheler. The same year he divorced from his wife.

In 1929 Hartmann married Frida Rosenfeld, with whom he had a son, Olaf (1930), and a daughter, Lise (1932). In 1931 he became Professor of Theoretical Philosophy in Berlin. He held the Chair until 1945. During this time he successively published many pieces of his ontology: &quot;Das Problem des geistigen Seins&quot; (&quot;The Problem of Spiritual Being&quot;) (1933), &quot;Zur Grundlegung der Ontologie&quot; (&quot;On the Foundation of Ontology&quot;) (1935), &quot;Möglichkeit und Wirklichkeit&quot; (&quot;Possibility and Actuality&quot;) (1938) and &quot;Der Aufbau der realen Welt. Grundriß der allgemeinen Kategorienlehre&quot; (&quot;The Structure of the Real World. Outline of the General Theory of Categories&quot;) (1940). The unrest of the National Socialist period seems to have left Hartmann relatively undisturbed in his task of developing a new ontology. In the &quot;&#x27;-Dossiers über Philosophie-Professoren&quot; (i.e. SD-files concerning philosophy professors) that were set up by the SS Security Service (SD) Nicolai Hartmann was classified from an SS-point of view in the following way: &quot;has always been a nationalist. Loyal to National Socialism, too, without political activity, but a social attitude has to be acknowledged. (cf. donations to the NSV and hosting children during school vacations)&quot;.

In 1942, Hartmann edited a volume entitled &quot;Systematische Philosophie&quot;, in which he contributed the essay &quot;Neue Wege der Ontologie&quot; (&quot;New Ways of Ontology&quot;), which summarizes his work in ontology.

Between 1945 and 1950, Hartmann taught in Göttingen. He died of a stroke in 1950. In the year of his death, there appeared his &quot;Philosophie der Natur&quot; (&quot;Philosophy of Nature&quot;). His works &quot;Teleologisches Denken&quot; (&quot;Teleological Thinking&quot;) (1951) and &quot;Ästhetik&quot; (&quot;Aesthetics&quot;) (1953) were published posthumously.

He is regarded as an important representative of critical realism and as one of the major metaphysicians of the twentieth century. Among Hartmann&#x27;s many students were Boris Pasternak, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Emil Cioran, Jakob Klein, Delfim Santos and Max Wehrli. He is the modern discoverer of emergence — originally called by him &quot;categorial novum&quot;. His encyclopedic work is basically forgotten today, although famous during his lifetime. His early work in the philosophy of biology has been cited in modern discussions of genomics and cloning, and his views on consciousness and free will are currently in vogue among contributors to the &quot;Journal of Consciousness Studies&quot;.

== Ontology ==
Nicolai Hartmann equates ontology with Aristotle&#x27;s science of being qua being. This science involves studying the most general characteristics of entities, usually referred to as categories, and the relations between them. According to Hartmann, the most general categories are:
# Moments of being (&quot;Seinsmomente&quot;): existence (&quot;Dasein&quot;) and essence (&quot;Sosein&quot;)
# Modes of being (&quot;Seinsweisen&quot;): reality and ideality
# Modalities of being (&quot;Seinsmodi&quot;): possibility, actuality and necessity

=== Existence and essence ===
The existence of an entity constitutes the fact that this entity is there, that it &quot;exists&quot;. Essence, on the other hand, constitutes what this entity is like, what its characteristics are. Every entity has both of these modes of being. But, as Hartmann points out, there is no absolute difference between existence and essence. For example, the existence of a leaf belongs to the essence of the tree while the existence of the tree belongs to the essence of the forest.

=== Reality and ideality ===
Reality and ideality are two disjunctive categories: every entity is either real or ideal. Ideal entities are universal, returnable and always existing while real entities are individual, unique and destructible. Among the ideal entities are mathematical objects and values. Reality is made up of a chain of temporal events. Reality is obtrusive, it is often experienced as a form of resistance in contrast to ideality. 

=== Modalities of being ===
The modalities of being are divided into the absolute modalities (actuality and non-actuality) and the relative modalities (possibility, impossibility and necessity). The relative modalities are &quot;relative&quot; in the sense that they depend on the absolute modalities: something is possible, impossible or necessary because something else is actual. Hartmann analyzes modality in the real sphere in terms of necessary conditions. An entity becomes actual if all its necessary conditions obtain. If all these factors obtain, it is necessary that the entity exists. But as long as one of its factors is missing, it can&#x27;t become actual, it is impossible. This has the consequence that all positive and all the negative modalities fall together: whatever is possible is both actual and necessary, whatever is not necessary is both non-actual and impossible. This is true also in the ideal sphere, where possibility is given by being free from contradictions.

=== Levels of reality ===
In Hartmann&#x27;s ontological theory, the levels of reality are: (1) the inorganic level (German: &quot;anorganische Schicht&quot;), (2) the organic level (&quot;organische Schicht&quot;), (3) the psychical/emotional level (&quot;seelische Schicht&quot;) and (4) the intellectual/cultural level (&quot;geistige Schicht&quot;). In &quot;The Structure of the Real World&quot; (&quot;Der Aufbau der realen Welt&quot;), Hartmann postulates four laws that apply to the levels of reality.

# The law of recurrence: Lower categories recur in the higher levels as a subaspect of higher categories, but never vice versa.
# The law of modification: The categorial elements modify in their recurrence in the higher levels (they are shaped by the characteristics of the higher levels).
# The law of the &quot;novum&quot;: The higher category is composed of a diversity of lower elements, but it is a specific &quot;novum&quot; that is not included in the lower levels.
# The law of distance between levels: Since the different levels do not develop continuously but in leaps, they can be clearly distinguished.

==Ethical theory==

The central concept of Hartmann&#x27;s ethical theory is that of a &quot;value&quot;. Hartmann&#x27;s 1926 book, &quot;Ethik,&quot; elaborates a material ethics of value according to which moral knowledge is achieved through phenomenological investigation into our experiences of values. Moral phenomena are understood by Hartmann to be experiences of a realm of being which is distinct from that of material things, namely, the realm of values. The values inhabiting this realm are unchanging, super-temporal, and super-historical, though human consciousness of them shifts in focus over time. Borrowing a style of phrase from Kant, Hartmann characterizes values as conditions of the possibility of goods; in other words, values are what make it possible for situations in the world to be &quot;good&quot;. Our knowledge of the goodness (or badness) of situations is derived from our emotional experiences of them, experiences which are made possible by an a priori capacity for the appreciation of value. For Hartmann, this means that our awareness of the value of a state of affairs is not arrived at through a process of reasoning, but rather, by way of an experience of &quot;feeling,&quot; which he calls &quot;valuational consciousness.&quot; If, then, ethics is the study of what one ought to do, or what states of affairs one ought to bring about, such studies, according to Hartmann, must be carried out by paying close attention to our emotional capacities to discern what is valuable in the world. As such, Hartmann&#x27;s conception of proper moral philosophy contrasts with rationalist and formalist theories, such as Kant&#x27;s, according to which ethical knowledge is derived from purely rational principles.

<text>The Gare de l&#x27;Est (; English: &quot;Station of the East&quot; or &quot;East station&quot;), officially Paris Est, is one of the seven large mainline railway station termini in Paris, France. It is located in the 10th arrondissement, not far southeast from the Gare du Nord, facing the Boulevard de Strasbourg, part of the north–south axis of Paris created by Georges-Eugène Haussmann.

Opened in 1849, it is currently the fifth-busiest of the six main railway stations in Paris before the Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz. The Gare de l&#x27;Est is the western terminus of the Paris–Strasbourg railway and Paris–Mulhouse railway which then proceeds to Basel, Switzerland.

== History ==
The Gare de l&#x27;Est was opened in 1849 by the Compagnie du Chemin de Fer de Paris à Strasbourg (Paris–Strasbourg Railway Company) under the name &quot;Strasbourg platform&quot; (&quot;Embarcadère de Strasbourg&quot;); an official inauguration with President Louis Napoléon Bonaparte took place the next year. The platform corresponds today with the hall for main-line trains. Designed by architect François Duquesnay, it was renamed the &quot;Gare de l&#x27;Est&quot; in 1854, after the expansion of service to Mulhouse.

Renovations followed in 1885 and 1900, as part of Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris. In 1931, it was doubled in size, with the new part of the station built symmetrically with the old part. This transformation changed the surrounding neighbourhood significantly. At the top of the west facade of the Gare de l&#x27;Est is a statue by the sculptor Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire, representing the city of Strasbourg, while the east end of the station is crowned by a statue personifying Verdun, by Varenne. These two cities are important destinations serviced by Gare de l&#x27;Est. On 4 October 1883, the Gare de l&#x27;Est saw the first departure of the &quot;Orient Express&quot; for Istanbul.

The Gare de l&#x27;Est is the terminus of a strategic railway network extending towards the eastern part of France, and it saw large mobilizations of French troops, most notably in 1914, at the beginning of World War I. In the main-line train hall, a monumental painting by Albert Herter, &quot;Le Départ des poilus, août 1914&quot; dating from 1926, illustrates the departure of these soldiers for the Western front. The SNCF started LGV Est Européenne services from the Gare de l&#x27;Est on 10 June 2007, with TGV and Intercity-Express (ICE) services to Northeastern France, Luxembourg, Southern Germany and Switzerland. Trains are initially planned to run at 320 km/h (198 mph), with the potential to run at 350 km/h (217 mph), cutting travel times by up to 2 hours.

<doc id="504024" wikidata="Q3244014" url="?curid=504024" title="List of Intellivision games">
<text>This is a list of cartridges and cassettes for the Intellivision game system. Some cartridges were branded as both Mattel Electronics and Sears Tele-Games, and later republished by INTV Corp. as Intellivision Inc. Between 1979 and 1989, a total of 132 titles were released:
* 118 cartridges plus one compilation cartridge for the Master Component 
* 6 cartridges for the ECS Computer Adapter
* 7 cassettes and 1 cartridge for the Keyboard Component

The main reference for this is the Game Catalog of IntellivisionLives.com. Some games were also published under different names when they were re-released as &quot;Intellivision Lives!&quot;.

== Table key ==

All early games published by Mattel Electronics were categorized by &quot;Network&quot;. Each network had its own color that was used for the game box. The network concept was abandoned in late 1982.

== Master component releases ==
Cartridges released during the production life of the Intellivision from 1979 to 1990. Intellivoice cartridges are included here. Although designed to be played with speech, the Intellivoice cartridges do run without the Intellivoice peripheral.

== Entertainment Computer System releases ==
With one exception the following cartridges require the ECS Computer Adapter and either the Computer Keyboard or Music Synthesizer peripherals.

== Keyboard component releases ==
Keyboard Component cassettes had limited availability through direct mail or select markets. Only 4000 Keyboard Components were manufactured.

== Unreleased ==
A list of Intellivision games that are playable but not released. Keyboard Component software on cassette tape are also included. Technical demos, store demos, and test cartridges are not included. &quot;Air Strike&quot; is one example that can be considered unfinished and is included in this list because the found prototype is playable. &quot;Hypnotic Lights&quot; is excluded because it is mostly a technical demo. &quot;Grid Shock&quot; is excluded due to lack of game play. Some were not released due to marketing decisions, others were due to Mattel Electronics shutting down in January 1984. Unless otherwise noted the reference source is the list of &quot;Unreleased Intellivision Games&quot; at IntellivisionLives.com. 

In a 2014 interview, APh programmer Tom Loughry explains that in 1982 he and another APh programmer started a third Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons game which was abandoned when he left the company. He also worked on a Keyboard Component cassette game &quot;Super Football&quot; whose completion status is unknown. In a 2015 interview with Russ Haft, manager of the Intellivision programming group at Atari, it is explained that in addition to the four games released versions of &quot;Joust, Jungle Hunt, Pole Position, and Missile Command&quot; were completed or close to completion. Missile Command would have been dropped because of poor playability. A June 1983 press release from CBS Electronics announces &quot;Wizard of War&quot; and &quot;Gorf&quot; to be released in July and &quot;Blueprint, Solar Fox&quot;, and &quot;Omega Race&quot; cartridges for August. This suggests &quot;Wizard of War&quot; and &quot;Gorf&quot; were completed and programming on the others were at least started. Other announced games such as Imagic &quot;Wing War&quot; and &quot;Moonsweeper&quot; have little information about their status.

<text>was a Japanese diplomat who served as vice-consul for the Japanese Empire in Kaunas, Lithuania. During the Second World War, Sugihara helped thousands of Jews flee Europe by issuing transit visas to them so that they could travel through Japanese territory, risking his career and the lives of his family. The fleeing Jews were refugees from German-occupied Western Poland and Soviet-occupied Eastern Poland, as well as residents of Lithuania.

Lithuania declared the year 2020 as &quot;The Year of Chiune Sugihara&quot; in his honor. Today, the estimated number of descendants of those who received &quot;Sugihara visas&quot; ranges between 40,000 and 100,000.

==Early life and education==
Chiune Sugihara was born on 1 January 1900 (Meiji 33), in Mino, Gifu prefecture, to a middle-class father, , and an upper-middle class mother, . When he was born, his father worked at a tax office in Kozuchi-town and his family lived in a borrowed temple, with the Buddhist temple where he was born nearby. He was the second son among five boys and one girl. His father and family moved into the tax office within the branch of the Nagoya Tax Administration Office one after another. In 1903 his family moved to Asahi Village in Niu-gun, Fukui Prefecture. In 1904 they moved to Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture. On 25 October 1905, they moved to Nakatsu Town, Ena-gun, Gifu Prefecture. In 1906 (Meiji 39) on 2 April, Chiune entered Nakatsu Town Municipal Elementary School (now Nakatsugawa City Minami Elementary School in Gifu Prefecture). On 31 March 1907, he transferred to Kuwana Municipal Kuwana Elementary School in Mie Prefecture (currently Kuwana Municipal Nissin Elementary School). In December of that same year, he transferred to Nagoya Municipal Furuwatari Elementary School (now Nagoya Municipal Heiwa Elementary School). In 1912, he graduated with top honors from Furuwatari Elementary School and entered Aichi prefectural 5th secondary school (now Zuiryo high school), a combined junior and senior high school. His father wanted him to become a physician, but Chiune deliberately failed the entrance exam by writing only his name on the exam papers. Instead, he entered Waseda University in 1918 (Taishō 7) and majored in English language. At that time, he entered Yuai Gakusha, the Christian fraternity that had been founded by Baptist pastor Harry Baxter Benninghoff, to improve his English.

In 1919, he passed the Foreign Ministry Scholarship exam. From 1920 to 1922, Sugihara served in the Imperial Japanese Army as a second lieutenant with the 79th Infantry Regiment, stationed in Korea, then part of the Empire of Japan. He resigned his commission in November 1922 and took the Foreign Ministry&#x27;s language qualifying exams the following year, passing the Russian exam with distinction. The Japanese Foreign Ministry recruited him and assigned him to Harbin, Manchuria, China, where he also studied the Russian and German languages and later became an expert on Russian affairs.


==Manchurian Foreign Office==
When Sugihara served in the Manchukuo (Manchurian) Foreign Office, he took part in the negotiations with the Soviet Union concerning the Northern Manchurian Railway. Sugihara was said to be the best Russian-speaker in the Japanese government, according to Roger Pulvers, and negotiated an agreement favourable to Japan with the Soviet Union which allowed Japan’s Northern Manchurian Railway&#x27;s expansion. 

During his time in Harbin, Sugihara married Klaudia Semionovna Apollonova and converted to Christianity (Russian Orthodox Church), using the baptismal name Sergei Pavlovich.

In 1934, Sugihara quit his post as Deputy Foreign Minister in Manchukuo in protest over Japanese mistreatment of the local Chinese.

Sugihara and his wife divorced in 1935, before he returned to Japan, where he married Yukiko (1913–2008, ). After the marriage; they had four sons - Hiroki, Chiaki, Haruki, and Nobuki. As of 2021, Nobuki is the only surviving son and represents the Sugihara family.

Chiune Sugihara also served in the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and as a translator for the Japanese delegation in Helsinki, Finland.

==Lithuania==
In 1939, Sugihara became a vice-consul of the Japanese Consulate in Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania. His duties included reporting on Soviet and German troop movements, and to find out if Germany planned an attack on the Soviets and, if so, to report the details of this attack to his superiors in Berlin and Tokyo.

Sugihara had cooperated with Polish intelligence as part of a bigger Japanese–Polish cooperative plan.

In Lithuania, Sugihara started using the Sino-Japanese reading &quot;Sempo&quot; for his given name, since it was easier to pronounce than &quot;Chiune&quot;.

===Jewish refugees===
As the Soviet Union occupied sovereign Lithuania in 1940, many Polish and Lithuanian Jews fearing persecution tried to acquire exit visas. While under Soviet occupation, it was announced that many foreign consulates in Kaunas would soon be closed. Per Holocaust researcher, historian David Kranzler Dutch national Nathan Gutwirth asked Dutch Ambassador to the Baltic tates L. P. J. de Decker for a travel visa. Per granddaughter of another Dutch national Peppy Sterinheim Lewin made the request. Either one or both of the above sought to reach Curaçao, then a Dutch colony, with subsequent plans to reach the United States. de Dekker was operating out of the Dutch consulate in Riga, Latvia. They were informed that no visa would be required, but travelers were instead required to obtain permission from the governor to land. Gutwirth or Lewin convinced de Dekker to issue the travel document with the second phrase omitted, instead only indicating that no visa was required The island had been providing fuel via its oil refineries to Allied forces, and was unwilling to let in immigrants from enemy territories. 

deDecker requested, authorized Dutch honorary consul Jan Zwartendijk to issue the same text to Jews in Kovno who wished to escape from Lithuania. In the period between 16 July and 3 August 1940, Jan Zwartendijk provided over 2,200 Jews with similar official passes.

In June 1940, as Italy entered the war, exit routes via the Mediterranean Sea were closed. The Committee in Greater Germany, forced to seek new outlets for emigration, arranged for the transportation of Jews from Germany across Europe and Asia (via the Trans-Siberian Railway) to Vladivostok, and then to Japan. From Japan the refugees were to embark for destinations in the Western Hemisphere.

Although the Soviet Union began offering citizenship to those living in occupied Lithuania, some instead still wished to emigrate—principally rabbis, yeshiva students, members of the intellectual classes and leaders of various Jewish communal and labor organizations. Travel visas to Japan were initially granted without much difficulty, and the JDC, in collaboration with a number of other American Jewish groups, contributed toward the funds required for the Trans-Siberian trip to Japan of 1,700 persons.

In July 1940, Jewish refugees from Germany, Poland, Lithuania, and other countries began arriving in Japan at Tsuruga, Shimonoseki and Kobe. Japanese embassies and consulates except Kaunas issued 3,448 Japanese transit visas from January 1940 to March 1941. Nearly half of the recipients held valid end-visas and immediately departed Japan.

The number of Jewish refugees who came to Japan, as seen in Table 1, has been documented as 4,500, 5,000 or 6,000. The 552 persons noted in the second row of the table do not match the number of departing persons edited by Jewcom. The Siberian railway had been closed and no evidence supporting this figure is found in JDC annual reports or MOFA documents. For the 200 persons described in Note 1 of Table 1, there is a document in the Archives of MOFA that the Japanese consulate of Vladivostok transferred about 50 Jewish refugees who had been stranded in Vladivostok to Shanghai with Soviet Union cargo on 26 April 1941.

====Sugihara&#x27;s visas====
At the time, the Japanese government required that visas be issued only to those who had gone through appropriate immigration procedures and had enough funds. Most of the refugees did not fulfil these criteria. Sugihara dutifully contacted the Japanese Foreign Ministry three times for instructions. Each time, the Ministry responded that anybody granted a visa should have a visa to a third destination to exit Japan, with no exceptions.

Being aware that applicants were in danger if they stayed behind, Sugihara decided to ignore his orders and, from 18 July to 28 August 1940, issued ten-day visas to Jews for transit through Japan. Given his inferior post and the culture of the Japanese Foreign Service bureaucracy, this was an unusual act of disobedience. He spoke to Soviet officials who agreed to let the Jews travel through the country via the Trans-Siberian Railway at five times the standard ticket price. His wife Yukiko who supported and encouraged him later recalled, &quot;My husband and I talked about the visas before he issued them. We understood that both the Japanese and German governments disagreed with our ideas, but we went ahead anyhow&quot;.

Sugihara continued to hand-write visas, reportedly spending 18 to 20 hours a day on them, producing a normal month&#x27;s worth of visas each day, until 4 September, when he had to leave his post before the consulate was closed. By that time, he had granted thousands of visas to Jews, many of whom were heads of households and thus permitted to take their families with them. It is claimed that before he left, he handed the official consulate stamp to a refugee so that more visas could be forged. His son, Nobuki Sugihara, adamantly insisted in an interview with Ann Curry that his father never gave the stamp to anyone. According to witnesses, he was still writing visas while in transit from his hotel and after boarding the train at Kaunas railway station, throwing visas into the crowd of desperate refugees out of the train&#x27;s window even as the train pulled out. His son Hiroki noted, &quot;my father continued to pen visas even at the railway station, throwing the last stamped passports out of the window of our train&quot;.

In final desperation, blank sheets of paper with only the consulate seal and his signature (that could be later written over into a visa) were hurriedly prepared and flung out from the train. As he prepared to depart, he said, &quot;Please forgive me. I cannot write anymore. I wish you the best.&quot; When he bowed deeply to the people before him, someone exclaimed, &quot;Sugihara. We&#x27;ll never forget you. I&#x27;ll surely see you again!&quot;

Sugihara himself wondered about official reaction to the thousands of visas he issued. Many years later, he recalled, &quot;No one ever said anything about it. I remember thinking that they probably didn&#x27;t realize how many I actually issued.&quot;

====Numbers saved====
On the number of refugees passing through Japan who held Japanese transit visas for Curaçao issued by Sugihara, the so-called &quot;Sugihara visa&quot;, there are two documents stating numbers of 2,200 and 6,000. The 6,000 persons as stated in &quot;Visas for Life&quot; is likely hearsay.

K. Watanabe argued that there could be 6,000, arguing that use by three family members per visa is reasonable, that there were newspaper articles reporting the 6,000 figure, and that most of the refugees landing on Tsuruga were now admitted with a Sugihara visa. On 29 September 1983, Fuji Television aired a documentary &quot;One visa that decided their fate - the Japanese who saved 4,500 Jews.&quot;

In 1985 some Japanese newspapers reported that he saved 6,000 people and others 4,500. &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, dated 19 January 1985, had the headline &quot;Japanese Man honored for saving 6,000 Jews&quot;; the Los Angeles Times reported, &quot;Sugihara defied orders from Tokyo and issued transit visas to nearly 6,000 Jews&quot;. US newspapers referred to Sugihara as &quot;a diplomat who defied his government&#x27;s orders and issued transit visas for 6,000 Jews&quot;.

Table 2 shows the number of refugees who had stayed at Kobe in 1941 based on Archives of MOFA. Refugees classified as &quot;No visa&quot; in the table are presumed to have held fakes of Japanese transit visas issued by Sugihara. The Soviets wanted to purge Polish refugees who had been stranded in Soviet territory with Japanese transit visas as soon as possible, and so permitted them to get on the train to Vladivostok with or without a destination visa. The Japanese government was forced to admit them. On 8 April 1941, of the 1,400 Polish Jews staying at Kobe, about 1,300 were &quot;for Curaçao&quot; or &quot;No visa&quot;.
The Polish ambassador in Tokyo, Tadeusz Romer, remembered, &quot;They (Polish refugees) only had fictitious Dutch visas for the island of Curaçao and Japanese transit visas.&quot; According to the refugee name list surveyed by Fukui Prefecture, of the 306 persons who landed at Tsuruga Port in October 1940, there were 203 Poles. Their destinations were US 89, Palestine 46, Curaçao 24, and others. It is estimated that about 80% of them were on the Sugihara visa list. The documents of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and &quot;Refugee and Survivor&quot; do not mention the number of people saved by a &quot;Sugihara visa&quot;.

More than half of the refugees who entered with invalid visas, including a &quot;Sugihara visa&quot;, obtained valid visas with the help of JDC, HIAS, the Embassy of Poland, and the Japanese government, and embarked for host countries. In August–September 1941, Japanese authorities transferred about 850 refugees stranded in Japan to Shanghai before Japan and the United States began war. According to Emigration Table by Jewcom, the number of Polish refugees leaving Japan for various destinations was Shanghai 860, US 532, Canada 186, Palestine 186, Australia 81, South Africa 59, and others 207, in total 2,111.

The total number of Jews saved by Sugihara is in dispute, with estimates around 6,000; family visas—which allowed several people to travel on one visa—were also issued, which would account for the much higher figure. The Simon Wiesenthal Center has estimated that Chiune Sugihara issued transit visas for about 6,000 Jews and that around 40,000 descendants of the Jewish refugees are alive today because of his actions. Polish intelligence produced some false visas. Sugihara&#x27;s widow and eldest son estimate that he saved 10,000 Jews from certain death, whereas Boston University professor and author Hillel Levine also estimates that he helped &quot;as many as 10,000 people&quot;, but that far fewer people ultimately survived. Some Jews who received Sugihara&#x27;s visas did not leave Lithuania in time, were captured by the Germans after Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, and perished in the Holocaust.
The Diplomatic Record Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has opened to the public two documents concerning Sugihara&#x27;s file: the first aforementioned document is a 5 February 1941 diplomatic note from Chiune Sugihara to Japan&#x27;s then Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka in which Sugihara stated he issued 1,500 out of 2,139 transit visas to Jews and Poles; however, since most of the 2,139 people were not Jewish, this would imply that most of the visas were given to Polish Jews instead. Levine then notes that another document from the same foreign office file &quot;indicates an additional 3,448 visas were issued in Kaunas for a total of 5,580 visas&quot; which were likely given to Jews desperate to flee Lithuania for safety in Japan or Japanese occupied-China.

Many refugees used their visas to travel across the Soviet Union to Vladivostok and then by boat to Kobe, Japan, where there was a Jewish community. Romer, the Polish ambassador in Tokyo, organized help for them. From August 1940 to November 1941, he had managed to get transit visas in Japan, asylum visas to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Burma, immigration certificates to British Mandatory Palestine, and immigrant visas to the United States and some Latin American countries for more than two thousand Polish-Lithuanian Jewish refugees, who arrived in Kobe, Japan, and the Shanghai Ghetto, China.

The remaining number of Sugihara survivors stayed in Japan until they were deported to Japanese-held Shanghai, where there was already a large Jewish community that had existed as early as the mid-1930s. Some took the route through Korea directly to Shanghai without passing through Japan. A group of thirty people, all possessing a visa of &quot;Jakub Goldberg&quot;, were shuttled back and forth on the open sea for several weeks before finally being allowed to pass through Tsuruga. Most of the around 20,000 Jews survived the Holocaust in the Shanghai ghetto until the Japanese surrender in 1945, three to four months following the collapse of the Third Reich itself.

==Imprisonment, release ==

Sugihara was reassigned to Königsberg, East Prussia before serving as a Consul General in Prague, in the German-occupied Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, from March 1941 to late 1942 and in the legation in Bucharest, Romania from 1942 to 1944. He was promoted to the rank of third secretary in 1943, and was decorated with the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 5th Class, in 1944. When Soviet troops entered Romania, they imprisoned Sugihara and his family in a POW camp for eighteen months. They were released in 1946 and returned to Japan through the Soviet Union via the Trans-Siberian Railway and Nakhodka port. In 1947, the Japanese foreign office asked him to resign, due to downsizing. Some sources, including his wife Yukiko Sugihara, have said that the Foreign Ministry told Sugihara he was dismissed because of &quot;that incident&quot; in Lithuania.

==Later life==
Sugihara settled in Fujisawa in Kanagawa prefecture with his wife and three sons. To support his family he took a series of menial jobs, at one point selling light bulbs door to door. He suffered a personal tragedy in 1947 when his youngest son, Haruki, died at the age of seven, shortly after their return to Japan. In 1949 they had one more son, Nobuki, who is the last son alive representing the Chiune Sugihara Family, residing in Belgium. 
Chiune Sugihara later began to work for an export company as general manager of a U.S. Military Post Exchange. Utilizing his command of the Russian language, Sugihara went on to work and live a low-key existence in the Soviet Union for sixteen years, while his family stayed in Japan.
In 1968, Yehoshua Nishri, an economic attaché to the Israeli Embassy in Tokyo and one of the Sugihara beneficiaries, finally located and contacted him. Nishri had been a Polish teen in the 1940s. The next year Sugihara visited Israel and was greeted by the Israeli government. Sugihara beneficiaries began to lobby for his recognition by Yad Vashem Sugihara was too ill to travel to Israel, so his wife and youngest son Nobuki accepted the honor on his behalf.

In 1985, 45 years after the Soviet invasion of Lithuania, he was asked his reasons for issuing visas to the Jews. Sugihara explained that the refugees were human beings, and that they simply needed help.

When asked by Moshe Zupnik, who received one of the visas from Sugihara in 1940, why he risked his career to save other people, he said simply: &quot;I do it just because I have pity on the people. They want to get out so I let them have the visas.&quot;

Chiune Sugihara died at a hospital in Kamakura, on 31 July 1986, and was buried in Kamakura Cemetery (Kamakura Reien). Despite the publicity given him in Israel and other nations, he had remained virtually unknown in his home country. Only when a large Jewish delegation from around the world, including the Israeli ambassador to Japan, attended his funeral, did his neighbours find out what he had done. His subsequent considerable posthumous acclaim contrasts with the obscurity in which he lived following the loss of his diplomatic career.

==Honor restored==
His death spotlighted his humanitarian acts during World War II and created the opportunity to revise his reputation as a diplomat in his own country. In 1991 Muneo Suzuki, Parliamentary Vice-President of Foreign Affairs, apologized to Chiune&#x27;s family for the long-time unfair treatment by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Official honor restoration by Japanese Government was made on 10 October 2000, when Foreign Minister Yōhei Kōno set the award plaque and gave a commendation speech at the ceremony for Sugihara at the Diplomatic Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan.

==Legacy and honors==
In 1984 the State of Israel via Yad Vashem bestowed the Righteous Among the Nations title on Chiune Sempo Sugihara and on Zwartenijk in 1997. deDecker was not awarded that recognition per the Righteous database updated to January 2022. 
Sugihara is the only Japanese national to have been so honored. He was too ill to travel to Israel, so his wife and youngest son Nobuki accepted the honor on his behalf.
Sugihara Street in Vilnius, Lithuania, Chiune (Sempo) Sugihara Street in Jaffa, Israel, and the asteroid 25893 Sugihara are named after him.

In 1992, the town of Yaotsu opened the Park of Humanity, on a hill overlooking the town. In 2000, the Chiune Sugihara Memorial Hall was opened to the public. Since its establishment, more than 600,000 visitors, Japanese and foreign, visited and studied about Sugihara and his virtue.

A corner for Sugihara Chiune is set up in the Port of Humanity Tsuruga Museum near Tsuruga Port, the place where many Jewish refugees arrived in Japan, in the city of Tsuruga, Fukui, Japan.
The Sugihara House Museum is in Kaunas, Lithuania. The Conservative synagogue Temple Emeth, in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, US, built a &quot;Sugihara Memorial Garden&quot; and holds an Annual Sugihara Memorial Concert. In 1996, Albany, New York erected a plaque honoring Sugihara in the city&#x27;s Raoul Wallenberg Park. 

When Sugihara&#x27;s widow Yukiko travelled to Jerusalem in 1998, she was met by tearful survivors who showed her the yellowing visas that her husband had signed. A park in Jerusalem is named after him. Sugihara appeared on a 1998 Israeli postage stamp. The Japanese government honored him on the centennial of his birth in 2000.

In 2001, a sakura park with 200 trees was planted in Vilnius, Lithuania, to mark the 100th anniversary of Sugihara.

In 2002, a memorial statue of Chiune Sugihara by Ramon G. Velazco titled &quot;Chiune Sugihara Memorial, Hero of the Holocaust&quot; was installed in the Little Tokyo neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, US. The life-size bronze statue depicts Sugihara seated on a bench and holding a hand-written visa. Adjacent to the statue is a granite boulder with dedication plaques and a quotation from the Talmud: &quot;He who saves one life, saves the entire world.&quot; Its dedication was attended by consuls from Japan, Israel and Lithuania, Los Angeles city officials and Sugihara&#x27;s son, Chiaki Sugihara.

In 2007 he was posthumously awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross with the Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta, and the Commander&#x27;s Cross Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland by the President of Poland in 1996. Also, in 1993, he was awarded the Life Saving Cross of Lithuania.
He was posthumously awarded the Sakura Award by the Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre (JCCC) in Toronto in November 2014.

In June 2016, a street in Netanya, Israel, was named for Sugihara in the presence of his son Nobuki, as a number of Netanya&#x27;s current residents are descendants of the Lithuanian Jews who had been given a means of escaping the Third Reich.
There is also a street named Rua Cônsul Chiune Sugihara in Londrina, Brazil.

The Lithuanian government declared 2020 &quot;The Year of Chiune Sugihara&quot;, promising to erect a monument to him and issue postage stamps in his honor. A monument to Sugihara, featuring origami cranes, was unveiled in Kaunas in October 2020.
Since October 2021, there is a Chiune Sugihara Square in Jerusalem as well as a Garden named for him in the Kiryat Hayovel neighborhood of the city.

<text>Cuirassiers ( ; , &#x27;wearing a cuirass&#x27;) were cavalry equipped with a cuirass, sword, and pistols. Cuirassiers first appeared in mid-to-late 16th century Europe as a result of armoured cavalry, such as men-at-arms and demi-lancers discarding their lances and adopting pistols as their primary weapon. In the later part of the 17th century, the cuirassier lost his limb armour and subsequently wore only the cuirass (breastplate and backplate), and sometimes a helmet. By this time, the sword or sabre had become his primary weapon, with pistols relegated to a secondary function.

Cuirassiers achieved increased prominence during the Napoleonic Wars and were last fielded in the opening stages of World War I (1914–1918). A number of countries continue to use cuirassiers as ceremonial troops.

The French term &quot;cuirassier&quot; means &quot;one with a cuirass&quot; (), the breastplate armour which they wore.

==16th and 17th centuries==
The first cuirassiers were similar in appearance to the fully armoured Late Medieval man-at-arms. They wore three-quarter armour that covered the entire upper body as well as the front half of the legs down to the knee. The head was protected by a close helm, burgonet, or lobster-tailed pot helmet, usually worn with a gorget for the neck. The torso was protected by a breast and back plate, sometimes reinforced by a plackart. The arms and shoulders were fully armoured with pauldrons, rerebraces, elbow couters, and vambraces. Armoured gauntlets were often abandoned, particularly for the right hand, as they interfered with the loading of pistols. Long tassets, instead of a combination of short tassets with cuisses, protected the front of the thighs and knees, and riding boots were substituted for lower leg armour (greaves and sabatons). Weapons included a pair of pistols in saddle holsters (these were the primary weapons instead of a lance), a sword, and sometimes a &quot;horseman&#x27;s pick&quot; (a type of war hammer). By the mid-16th century, Barding (horse armour) largely fell into disuse on the battlefield. Therefore, it was more commonly used for ceremonial purposes such as parades or festivals.

The armour of a cuirassier was very expensive; in England, in 1629, a cuirassier&#x27;s equipment cost four pounds and 10 shillings (equivalent to £ in ), whilst a harquebusier&#x27;s (a lighter type of cavalry) was a mere one pound and six shillings (equivalent to £ in ).

During the latter half of the 16th century, the heavy &quot;knightly&quot; lance gradually fell out of use perhaps because of the widespread adoption of the infantry pike. Also, the lance required a great amount of practice to perfect its use, whilst proficiency in the use of firearms was considerably more easily acquired. The lancer or demi-lancer, when he had abandoned his lance, became the pistol-armed cuirassier or reiter.

The adoption of the pistol as the primary weapon led to the development of the stately caracole tactic, where cuirassiers fired their pistols at the enemy, then retired to reload whilst their comrades advanced in turn to maintain the firing. Following some initial successes, this tactic proved to be extremely ineffective as infantry, with superior firearms and numbers, could easily outgun the cuirassiers. The change from cavalry reliant on firearms to shock-capable close combat cavalry reliant mainly on the sword was often attributed to Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in the 1620s and early 1630s. Gustavus Adolphus also reduced the number of ranks in a cavalry formation from the previously usual six to ten, for pistol-based tactics, to three to suit his sword-based shock tactics, or as a partial remedy to the frequent numerical inferiority of his cavalry arm.

Only two cuirassier regiments were raised during the English Civil War, the Lifeguard of the Earl of Essex and the &#x27;London lobsters,&#x27; though individuals within other regiments did serve in full armour. With the refinement of infantry firearms, especially the introduction of the powerful musket, the usefulness of the protection afforded by full armour became greatly lessened. By the mid-17th century, the fully armoured cuirassier was becoming increasingly anachronistic. &quot;It will kill a man to serve in a whole cuirass&quot; commented a late 17th century observer. The cuirassier lost his limb armour and entered the 18th century with just the breast and backplate.

==18th and 19th centuries==

Body armour, was restricted to a cuirass, which fell in and out of use during the 18th century; for example British cavalry entered the War of the Spanish Succession without body armour, although they readopted it during the conflict. Cuirassiers played a prominent role in the armies of Austria, and of Frederick the Great of Prussia. By the time of the French Revolutionary Wars, few heavy cavalry regiments, except those of Austria, wore the cuirass on campaign. The twelve Austrian cuirassier regiments in existence between 1768 and 1802 (when the number was reduced) unusually wore only a front plate. This reduced the burden of the weight carried by the individual trooper, but left his back unprotected during a swirling cavalry melee.

Most heavy cavalry from c. 1700 to c. 1785 wore the tricorne hat, which evolved into the bicorne, or cocked hat, towards the close of the century. In the first two decades of the 19th century, helmets, often of hardened leather with brass reinforcement (though the French used iron-skulled helmets for their cuirassiers), replaced the bicorne hat.

A resurgence of armoured cavalry took place in France under the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte, who increased the number of armoured regiments from one to, ultimately, sixteen (fourteen cuirassier regiments plus two Carabiniers-à-Cheval regiments).

During the first few decades of the 19th century most of the major states of Europe, except Austria which had retained its armoured cavalry, readopted the cuirass for some of their heavy cavalry in emulation of the French. The Russians fielded two divisions of armoured cavalry, but most other states armoured a few senior regiments: Prussia three regiments, the Kingdom of Saxony three, the Kingdom of Westphalia two, Spain one (&quot;Coraceros Españoles&quot;) and the Duchy of Warsaw one. The three Household Cavalry regiments of the British Army (1st and 2nd Life Guards and Royal Horse Guards) adopted cuirasses shortly after the Napoleonic Wars as a part of their full dress uniforms, but never had occasion to wear the armour in battle.. However as late as 1887 these regiments were still wearing cuirasses on maneuvers in &quot;field day order&quot;.

Cuirassiers were generally the senior branch of the mounted portion of an army, retaining their status as heavy cavalry—&quot;big men on big horses&quot;. Their value as a heavy striking force during the Napoleonic Wars ensured that the French, Russian, and Prussian armies continued to use cuirassier regiments throughout the 19th century. The Austrian cuirassiers were abolished in 1868.

For the reasons of both climate and cost, cuirassiers of the 19th century type seldom appeared outside of Europe and Latin America . However Ranjit Singh&#x27;s Sikh Army (the Khalsa) of the 1830s included two regiments of cuirassiers equipped and armed in French fashion. Four hundred &quot;carabinier&quot; cuirasses were imported from France while helmets and uniforms were manufactured in Wazirabad.

==Effectiveness during the Napoleonic Wars==
Though the armour could not protect against contemporary flintlock musket fire, it could deflect shots fired from long range, stop ricochets, and offer protection from all but very close-range pistol fire. More importantly, in an age which saw cavalry used in large numbers, the breastplates (along with the helmets) provided excellent protection against the swords and lances of opposing cavalry and infantry equipped with bayonets, and, on a much smaller scale, polearms (including sergeants equipped with spontoons and halberds). It also had some psychological effect for the wearer (effectively making the cuirassier more willing to plunge into the thick of fighting) and the enemy (adding intimidation), while it also added weight to a charge, especially in cavalry versus cavalry actions.

Napoleonic French cuirasses were originally intended to be proof against three musket shots at close range; however, this was never achieved in practice. The regulations eventually recognised this, and cuirasses were subsequently only expected to be proof against one shot at long range.

The utility of this armour was sometimes disputed. Prussian cuirassiers had abandoned the armoured cuirass before the Napoleonic Wars, but were reissued with it in 1814. During this period, a single British cavalry regiment (Royal Horse Guards) wore cuirasses during the Netherlands campaign of 1794, using breastplates taken from store. The Austrian cuirassiers traded protection for mobility by wearing only the half-cuirass (without back plate) and helmet. Napoleon believed it sufficiently useful that he had cuirassier-style armour issued to his two carabinier regiments after the Battle of Wagram. The Russians, having abandoned Austrian-style half-cuirasses in 1801, reissued full cuirasses in 1812 for all Army and Guard cuirassier regiments, with troops receiving them during the summer 1812 and wearing cuirasses at Borodino. After the Battle of Tarutino the Pskov dragoon regiment received captured French cuirasses and was officially upgraded to a cuirassier regiment. Despite being metallurgically more advanced than the plate armour of old, the Napoleonic era cuirass was still quite cumbersome and hot to wear in warm weather; however, the added protection that it gave to the wearer and the imposing appearance of an armoured cavalryman were factors favouring its retention.

==Franco-Prussian War==

The last occasions when cuirassiers played a major tactical role as shock cavalry wearing traditional armour was during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871). The French cuirassiers numbered 11 regiments at the outbreak of war but had not seen active service since the Battle of Waterloo. A brigade comprising the 6th and 9th Regiments had served in the Crimean War but had not actually encountered the enemy. Accordingly, the prospect of action against the Prussian Army, which included 10 cuirassier regiments of its own, was seen as an opportunity for a strongly traditional branch of the French cavalry to prove its continuing relevance. In the event, in a series of massed charges against Prussian infantry and artillery at Froeschwiller and Rezonville, the French cuirassiers suffered very heavy losses for little return.

==19th and 20th centuries==


In 1914, the German Army still retained cuirassiers (ten regiments including the Gardes du Corps and the Guards Cuirassiers); as did the French (twelve regiments) and the Russian (four regiments, all of the Imperial Guard) armies. The Austrians had dispensed with breastplates in 1860 and formally abolished the twelve &quot;Kuirassier&quot; regiments as the heavy cavalry branch of their army in 1868. Influenced by the French example, the Belgian Army created two regiments of cuirassiers in 1830 and then for reasons of economy they were converted to lancers in 1863.

By the end of the 19th century, the German and Russian cuirassiers used the breastplates only as part of their peacetime parade dress, but the French regiments still wore the cuirass and plumed helmet (both with cloth covers) on active service during the first few weeks of World War I. Amongst ceremonial units the Spanish &quot;Escolta Real&quot; (Royal Escort) Squadron, the Argentinian Presidential Bodyguard, and the Italian Cuirassier (&quot;Corazzieri&quot;) Corps all wore cuirasses as part of their mounted full dress in the early 20th century.

The retention of cuirasses as part of their field uniform by the French Army in 1914 reflected the historic prestige of this branch of the cavalry, dating back through the Franco-Prussian War to the campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars. Before the war, it had been argued within the army that the cuirass should be limited to parade dress, but upon mobilisation in 1914 the only concession made to active service was the addition of a cover of brown or blue cloth over the shining steel and brass of the metal equipment to make the wearer less visible. Within a few weeks, most French regiments stopped wearing the cuirass, as it served no real purpose in this new war. It was not however formally withdrawn until October 1915.

The Russian and German cuirassiers ceased to exist when the Imperial armies in both countries were disbanded; respectively in 1917 (due to the Russian Revolution) and in 1918 (due to the Treaty of Versailles). The French cuirassiers continued in existence after World War I, although without their traditional armour and reduced in numbers to only the six regiments that had been most decorated during the war. Five of these units had achieved their distinctions serving as &quot;cuirassiers &quot;à pied&quot;&quot; or dismounted cavalry in the trenches. The surviving cuirassier regiments were amongst the first mounted cavalry in the French Army to be mechanised during the 1930s. One cuirassier regiment still forms part of the French Army in the modern day.

==Cuirassiers today==
*The French army maintains one historic cuirassier regiment as a mechanised armoured unit: the &quot;12e Régiment de Cuirassiers&quot; based at Olivet.
*The Italian army maintains the Cuirassiers&#x27; Regiment (Italian: &quot;Reggimento Corazzieri&quot;) as the honour guard of the President of the Italian Republic. They are part of the Carabinieri.
*The Spanish army maintains a cavalry detachment as part of the Spanish Royal Guard, who wear cuirasses and are sometimes known as cuirassiers (Spanish: &quot;Coraceros&quot;). Their proper title is Royal Escort Squadron (&quot;Escuadrón de Escolta Real&quot;).
*The British army maintains cuirassiers through the Household Cavalry, they wear cuirasses as part of their parade equipment on formal occasions but were never formally designated as cuirassiers, instead retaining the titles Lifeguards and Horse Guards.
*The Chilean army maintains an armored brigade which uses the title &quot;1st Cuirassiers Armored Brigade&quot;.
*The Argentine army maintains the 7th Tank Cavalry, which also uses the title of &quot;Colonel Ramon Estomba&#x27;s &quot;Cuirassiers&quot; &quot;. In addition the 4th Reconnaissance Cavalry Regiment (Mountain) retains the title of &quot;Coraceros General Lavalle&quot; (General Lavalle&#x27;s Cuirassiers). This latter regiment maintains a mounted fanfare and ceremonial escort in the Argentine cuirassier uniform of 1910, although the body armor of that period is no longer worn.

== Cuirassier harness evolution ==
The development of firearms, which reduced the effectiveness of expensive heavy armour, led to a considerable reduction of the size and complexity of the latter. This form of protection was reduced in the latter half of the 17th century to the breastplate and the helmet, both of which eventually became largely decorative against projectiles but still retained their effectiveness against swords, lances, bayonets, and other edged weapons.

<text>Eric VI Menved (1274 – 13 November 1319) was King of Denmark (1286–1319). A son of King Eric V and Agnes of Brandenburg, he became king in 1286 at age 12, when his father was murdered on 22 November by unknown assailants. On account of his age, his mother ruled for him until 1294.

==Regency==
Eric Menved&#x27;s rule was a central period during the &quot;Age of Decay&quot; in Denmark 1241–1340. His early reign – during which he was led by his mother and her German relatives – was affected by the unrest and wars that followed the murder of his father.

The first act of the new government was to settle the case of the former king&#x27;s murder at a court convened at Nyborg at Whitsun 1287. Twenty-seven honorable men were appointed to decide the case. Marshal Stig Andersen Hvide and Jacob Nielsen, Count of Halland and seven others were accused. After a one-day trial, the jury found all the accused guilty. The properties and incomes of the condemned were declared forfeit and they were exiled from Denmark on pain of death. Even the pope became involved when he excommunicated those who had been judged guilty.

The verdict was questionable on several counts. None of the accused could be proven to be in the immediate vicinity when the king was stabbed to death. The accused were not allowed to swear their innocence before the court or have other honorable men swear as to their innocence, a right granted to them by law. Despite the unclear circumstances surrounding Eric V&#x27;s death, the jury only took one day to arrive at a guilty verdict. The accused had all belonged to Erik V&#x27;s inner circle; it is uncertain what they were supposed to gain by the king&#x27;s death.

For these reasons historians Erik Arup (1876–1951) and Hugo Yrwing (1908–2002) labelled the verdict as a miscarriage of justice. They consider the murder a result of a power struggle between two noble factions, one led by Marsk Stig and one led by Valdemar, Duke of South Jutland. Duke Valdemar had fallen from grace in 1283, but quickly rose in influence after 1288. They suggest that Valdemar and his allies conspired to kill the king and then to successfully cast suspicion on their rivals at court. Another historian, Kai Hørby (1935–1993) pointed out that the murder might well have its origin in the dynastic struggle for the throne of Denmark. There were others who thought they had equal or better claim to the throne than Eric V, such as Norway&#x27;s king, Eirik Magnusson and his brother and successor Haakon V who were grandsons of Eric IV of Denmark.

Andersen and the others fled to Norway where they were welcomed by King Eirik who gladly supported enemies of the Danish king. He gave Andersen the fortress of Kongshelle near the border with Denmark. Andersen became a pirate who harried the coast of Denmark for years. The exiles managed to build forts on Samsø, Hjelm, Sprogø, and Helgenæs. No ship was safe and no coastal town immune from Stig Andersen Hvide. The high point of his depredations occurred in 1289 when he landed with a small Norwegian army at Stubbekøbing on Falster. Wizlau II of Rűgen, Denmark&#x27;s regent, used his Wendish fleet to drive Andersen back to Norway. Andersen&#x27;s activities sparked four decades of conflict and warfare between the Nordic kingdoms.

==Reign==
At the same time an ecclesiastical conflict appeared because of the ambitious new Archbishop of Lund Jens Grand who supported the outlaws, his kinsmen, despite his oath to support the king. Once his selection was confirmed by the pope, Bishop Jens reneged on his oath of allegiance. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter to me whether Duke Valdemar, a Jew, a Turk, a pagan, or the devil himself is King of Denmark so long as it is neither Erik nor his brother Christopher,&quot; he said. Bishop Jens gave a piece of church land at Hundehals to the exiles to build a fortress and entertained them at his table in public. The king could not tolerate this and ordered Bishop Jens&#x27; arrest in 1294. The archbishop was sent to Duke Christopher in chains to be close confined in Søborg&#x27;s &quot;dark tower&quot;. After some months in terrible conditions, the king sent a messenger to Bishop Jens to see if he would swear allegiance again and promise to seek no revenge for his captivity. &quot;Rather than bend to his will, I would rather that the king sliced me apart joint by joint than submit to his commands,&quot; the bishop replied. After two years in awful conditions, Bishop Jens managed to escape with the help of a kitchen servant. Bishop Jens fled directly to Rome to lay his case before the Holy See. The pope immediately excommunicated the king and put all of Denmark under interdict until the kingdom paid Archbishop Jens Grand 49,000 silver marks. Denmark could not or would not raise such a sum and languished under interdict for four years. In 1302 King Erik wrote to the pope asking for mercy for himself and the kingdom which had been without any of the sacraments for years. Promising to do whatever the pope said, King Erik humbled himself in public. Pope Boniface VIII – negotiated by Martin (Morten Mogensen) of Dacia – agreed to reduce the fine by 80%, interdict and excommunication were lifted and Archbishop Jens accepted another papal assignment which kept him out of King Erik&#x27;s hair.

Erik had a great love of tournaments, and money poured out of the treasury for his entertainments. At one knightly tournament at Rostock, wine, mead, and beer &quot;flowed&quot; for an entire month for any who wished to drink. The king paid for the upkeep of all the horses and livestock at the tournament including a mountain of oats for any and all. He crafted new and unusual taxes to squeeze peasants and nobles alike. When the tax money didn&#x27;t cover his expenses, the king borrowed money heavily from various German nobles, going so far as to mortgage pieces of Denmark to them. Erik sent several expeditions to Germany to win new territories in an attempt to recover Denmark&#x27;s position as a Scandinavian great power. Through alliances with German princes, among them the Duke of Mecklenburg he managed to become the formal lord of several Hanseatic cities which meant fighting Brandenburg and some other minor states. He also intervened in Sweden in order to support his brother-in-law against the opposition in 1305 and again in 1307–1309 while fighting in Germany at the same time, hiring German troops to turn the tide in his favor.

In 1312 famine struck Denmark and when the king demanded the same taxes as before, the peasants on Zealand rebelled. Erik put down the rebellion fiercely, hanging hundreds of peasants outside Copenhagen. The very next year at the Viborg Assembly (Danish: &quot;&quot;) the peasant and nobles declared open rebellion against the king. Those who refused to aid the rebels were hanged from their own house beams. Erik put down the rebellion with mercenary troops from Germany, ravaging as far north as Randers. The king began a round of fortress building with peasant slave labor, one of the penalties imposed for rebellion. The nobles involved were exiled or executed and their property taken by the crown. Four such strongholds were constructed; Bygholm in Horsens, Kalø north of Aarhus, Borgvold in Viborg and Ulstrup east of Struer. Niels Brok was executed for hiding Rane Jonsen (1254–1294) who had aided those who murdered Erik&#x27;s father at Finderup.

In 1313 King Erik surrendered all crown property in southern Jutland to the Duke for cash. From 1315 to 1317 the crops failed yet again. There was nothing left to tax. The treasury was empty. In 1317 Erik mortgaged all of the island of Funen to Gerhard III, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg and John II, Count of Holstein-Kiel for 200 mounted knights. Before he died, Erik also mortgaged Skåne to German nobles for money to continue his extravagances. As a last blow to Danish pride, Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg captured the Danish fortress at Rostock.

When Erik died in 1319 having survived all his 14 children; Denmark was bankrupt. He was succeeded by his younger brother Christopher (1276–1332) who ruled Denmark as King Christopher II between 1320 and 1326.

==Judgements==
Traditionally the rule of Eric VI has been regarded one of the few bright spots of the period because of his attempt to recover Denmark&#x27;s far-flung empire. He has been hailed in Danish romantic literature. Viewed today, however, his policies began the dissolution of the Danish empire in the Baltic and northern Europe that followed during the next generation.

The nickname of King Eric has been much discussed. A popular explanation is that it is an abbreviation of his alleged favourite oath (“&quot;ved&quot; alle hellige &quot;mænd&quot;” – Eng.: &quot;by&quot; all holy &quot;men&quot;). Another explanation is that it derives from the elder Danish “&quot;menvett&quot;” (Eng.: bird of ill omen).

==Children and family==
Married in June 1296 to Ingeborg Magnusdotter of Sweden. She was the daughter of King Magnus III of Sweden and sister of Birger, King of Sweden. The couple had eight sons who died as children, as well as six miscarriages, although the sources differ between eight and fourteen children: her many pregnancies led to miscarriages, or the birth of children who died soon after.
* Valdemar (d. 1302)
* Eric
* Magnus
* An unnamed son (b. &amp; d. 1318); according to tradition, Queen Ingeborg was so happy to finally have a live born child, she took the boy out for a carriage ride to show him off, holding him out the window, where she lost her grip on him, and he fell and broke his neck. Queen Ingeborg subsequently entered the Convent of St. Clare in Roskilde where she died the following year.

Evidence also indicate Eric VI may have had an illegitimate son,or possibly a son of Ingeborg later in life named Erik Sjællandsfar (ca. 1300–1364) at Orebygård on Zealand, buried in Roskilde Cathedral with a crown. However, other theories indicate that he was a son of King Valdemar IV of Denmark.

<text>During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was erroneously believed that there were &quot;canals&quot; on the planet Mars. These were a network of long straight lines in the equatorial regions from 60° north to 60° south latitude on Mars, observed by astronomers using early telescopes without photography.

They were first described by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli during the opposition of 1877, and attested to by later observers. Schiaparelli called these &quot;canali&quot; (&quot;channels&quot;), which was mis-translated into English as &quot;canals&quot;. The Irish astronomer Charles E. Burton made some of the earliest drawings of straight-line features on Mars, although his drawings did not match Schiaparelli&#x27;s. 

Around the turn of the century there was even speculation that they were engineering works, irrigation canals constructed by a civilization of intelligent aliens indigenous to Mars. By the early 20th century, improved astronomical observations revealed that, with the possible exception of the natural canyon Valles Marineris, the &quot;canals&quot; were likely an optical illusion, and modern high-resolution mapping of the Martian surface by spacecraft supports this interpretation.

== Supposed &quot;discoveries&quot; ==
The Italian word &quot;canale&quot; (plural &quot;canali&quot;) can mean &quot;canal&quot;, &quot;channel&quot;, &quot;duct&quot; or &quot;gully&quot;. The first person to use the word &quot;canale&quot; in connection with Mars was Angelo Secchi in 1858, although he did not see any straight lines and applied the term to large features—for example, he used the name &quot;Canale Atlantico&quot; for what later came to be called Syrtis Major Planum. The canals were named by Schiaparelli and others after both real and legendary rivers of various places on Earth, or the mythological underworld.

At this time in the late 19th century, astronomical observations were made without photography. Astronomers had to stare for hours through their telescopes, waiting for a moment of still air when the image was clear, and then draw a picture of what they had seen. Astronomers believed at the time that Mars had a relatively substantial atmosphere. They knew that the rotation period of Mars (the length of its day) was almost the same as Earth&#x27;s, and they knew that Mars&#x27; axial tilt was also almost the same as Earth&#x27;s, which meant it had seasons in the astronomical and meteorological sense. They could also see Mars&#x27; polar ice caps shrinking and growing with these changing seasons. The similarities with Earth led them to interpret darker albedo features (for instance Syrtis Major) on the lighter surface as oceans. By the late 1920s, however, it was known that Mars is very dry and has a very low atmospheric pressure.In 1889, American astronomer Charles A. Young reported that Schiaparelli&#x27;s canal discovery of 1877 had been confirmed in 1881, though new canals had appeared where there had not been any before, prompting &quot;very important and perplexing&quot; questions as to their origin.

During the favourable opposition of 1892, W. H. Pickering observed numerous small circular black spots occurring at every intersection or starting-point of the &quot;canals&quot;. Many of these had been seen by Schiaparelli as larger dark patches, and were termed &quot;seas&quot; or &quot;lakes&quot;; but Pickering&#x27;s observatory was at Arequipa, Peru, about 2400 meters above the sea, and with such atmospheric conditions as were, in his opinion, equal to a doubling of telescopic aperture. They were soon detected by other observers, especially by Lowell.

During the oppositions of 1892 and 1894, seasonal color changes were reported. As the polar snows melted the adjacent seas appeared to overflow and spread out as far as the tropics, and were often seen to assume a distinctly green colour. At this time (1894) it began to be doubted whether there were any seas at all on Mars. Under the best conditions, these supposed &#x27;seas&#x27; were seen to lose all trace of uniformity, their appearance being that of a mountainous country, broken by ridges, rifts, and canyons, seen from a great elevation. These doubts soon became certainties, and it is now universally agreed that Mars possesses no permanent bodies of surface water.

== Interpretation as engineering works ==

The hypothesis that there was life on Mars originated from seasonal changes observed in surface features, which began to be interpreted as due to seasonal growth of plants (in fact, Martian dust storms are responsible for some of this).

During the 1894 opposition, the idea that Schiaparelli&#x27;s &quot;canali&quot; were really irrigation canals made by intelligent beings was first hinted at, and then adopted as the only intelligible explanation, by American astronomer Percival Lowell and a few others. The visible seasonal melting of Mars polar icecaps fueled speculation that an advanced alien race indigenous to Mars built canals to transport the water to drier equatorial regions. Newspaper and magazine articles about Martian canals and &quot;Martians&quot; captured the public imagination. Lowell published his views in three books: &quot;Mars&quot; (1895), &quot;Mars and Its Canals&quot; (1906), and &quot;Mars As the Abode of Life&quot; (1908). He remained a strong proponent for the rest of his life of the idea that the canals were built for irrigation by an intelligent civilization, going much further than Schiaparelli, who for his part considered much of the detail on Lowell&#x27;s drawings to be imaginary. Some observers drew maps in which dozens if not hundreds of canals were shown with an elaborate nomenclature for all of them. Some observers saw a phenomenon they called &quot;gemination&quot;, or doubling – two parallel canals.

== Contemporary doubts and definitive debunk ==

Other observers disputed the notion of canals. The influential observer Eugène Antoniadi used the 83 cm (32.6 inch) aperture telescope at Meudon Observatory during the 1909 opposition of Mars and saw no canals, the outstanding photos of Mars taken at the new Baillaud dome at the Pic du Midi observatory also brought formal discredit to the Martian canals theory in 1909, and the notion of canals began to fall out of favor. Around this time spectroscopic analysis also began to show that no water was present in the Martian atmosphere. However, as of 1916 Waldemar Kaempffert (editor of &quot;Scientific American&quot; and later &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot;) was still vigorously defending the Martian canals theory against skeptics.

In 1907 the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace published the book &quot;Is Mars Habitable?&quot; that severely criticized Lowell&#x27;s claims. Wallace&#x27;s analysis showed that the surface of Mars was almost certainly much colder than Lowell had estimated, and that the atmospheric pressure was too low for liquid water to exist on the surface. He also pointed out that several recent efforts to find evidence of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere with spectroscopic analysis had failed. He concluded that complex life was impossible, let alone the planet-girding irrigation system claimed by Lowell.

The existence of Martian canals was still controversial even at the dawn of the Space Race. In 1965, the &quot;Sourcebook on the space sciences&quot; said that &quot;Although there is no unanimous opinion concerning the existence of the canals, most astronomers would probably agree that there are apparently linear (or approximately linear) markings, perhaps 40 to 160 kilometers (25 to 100 miles) or more across and of considerable length.&quot; Later in the same year, the arrival of the United States&#x27; Mariner 4 spacecraft debunked for good the idea that Mars could be inhabited by higher forms of life, or that any canal features existed. It took pictures revealing impact craters and a generally barren Martian landscape, with a surface atmospheric pressure of 4.1 to 7.0 millibars (410 to 700 pascals), 0.4% to 0.7% of Earth atmospheric pressure, and daytime temperatures of −100 degrees Celsius were measured. No magnetic field, nor radiation belts were detected.

As early as 1903, Joseph Edward Evans and Edward Maunder conducted visual experiments using schoolboy volunteers that demonstrated how the canals could arise as an optical illusion. This is because when a poor-quality telescope views many point-like features (e.g. sunspots or craters) they appear to join up to form lines. Based on his own experiments, Lowell&#x27;s assistant, A. E. Douglass, was led to explain the observations in essentially psychological terms. In hindsight, William Kenneth Hartmann, a Mars imaging scientist from the 1960s to the 2000s, hypothesized that the &quot;canals&quot; were streaks of dust caused by wind on the leeward side of mountains and craters. Valles Marineris has been proposed to correspond to the Coprates canal.

==In popular culture==

Martian canals first appeared in fiction in the anonymously published 1883 novel &quot;Politics and Life in Mars&quot;. Following the popularization of the idea that they were artificial constructs by Lowell&#x27;s books, they appeared in numerous works of fiction until the Mariner 4 flyby conclusively demonstrated that they did not exist.

<doc id="504036" wikidata="Q1403165" url="?curid=504036" title="Strasbourg–Saint-Denis station">
<text>Strasbourg–Saint-Denis () is a station on Line 4, Line 8 and Line 9 of the Paris Métro. Opened in 1908 under the name Boulevard Saint-Denis, it took on its current name in 1931, which refers to Rue Saint-Denis and the Boulevard de Strasbourg.

==Location==
The station of Line 4 is located under the Boulevard de Strasbourg while the stations of Lines 8 and 9 are located under the Boulevard de Bonne-Nouvelle. These last two lines cross Line 4 perpendicularly and from below, and which replaced the Louis XIII wall and is in soft ground, which was once the course of the Seine. Line 8 is on the higher level and Line 9 in the lower level. The platforms are at the sides and the box containing the lines and supporting the road above is strengthened by a central wall between the tracks.

==History==
The station was opened on 5 May 1908, two weeks after the opening of the first section of Line 4 from Porte de Clignancourt to Châtelet on 21 April 1908. The Line 8 platforms opened on 5 May 1931 with the extension of the line from Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Charenton. The Line 9 platforms were opened on 10 December 1933 with the extension of the line from Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Montreuil.

On 13 August 1941, an anti-Nazi demonstration took place at the Strasbourg-Saint-Denis metro station. On 19 August 1941, Samuel Tyszelman and Henri Gautherot, two young communist activists who took part in the demonstration, were shot in the Forêt de Verrières. Maria Leonor Rubiano, who had made a tricolor flag with Angèle Martinez, was arrested a few weeks later by the Gestapo, imprisoned and then died in deportation.

The term &quot;Saint-Denis&quot; refers to Saint Denis, apostle of the Gauls and first bishop of Paris, who gave his name to the city of Saint-Denis and its abbey. Rue Saint-Denis in Paris, located in the immediate vicinity of the station, stretches from Rue de Rivoli in the south to the Porte Saint-Denis, built in memory of Louis XIV&#x27;s triumphs in Holland and Germany. It was the link between Paris and Saint-Denis.

In 2019, 9,524,965 passengers entered the station, making it the 20th-most frequented metro station.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has seven entrances:
* Entrance 1: 8 Saint-Denis Boulevard;
* Entrance 2: 9 Saint-Denis Boulevard;
* Entrance 3: 13 Saint-Denis Boulevard;
* Entrance 4: 18 Saint-Denis Boulevard;
* Entrance 5: 19 Saint-Denis Boulevard;
* Entrance 6: 28 Saint-Denis Boulevard;
* Entrance 7: 10 Bonne-New Boulevard.
===Station layout===
===Platforms===
The platforms of Line 4 are standard configuration. The two platforms are separated by the centre tracks. The ceiling is a metal apron whose beams are supported by vertical walls. The platforms are laid out in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two bright blue lighting canopies and blue &quot;Motte&quot; seats. Blue paint is also applied to the metal ceiling beams. The walls and tunnel exits are covered with flat white tiles laid vertically and aligned. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is in Parisine font on enamelled plate.

As part of the automation of Line 4, its platforms have been upgraded to platform screen doors, which were installed between February and March 2020.
The platforms of the lines 8 and 9, are 105 metres long, are of particular configuration, they are isolated as two half-stations each, separated by a central wall because of their construction within unstable terrain.
===Bus connections===
The station is served by the 20, 32, 38 and 39 lines of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by the N13 and N14 lines of the Noctilien bus network.

==Nearby attractions==
* Porte Saint-Denis
* Porte Saint-Martin

==In popular culture==
Roy Hargrove wrote a jazz composition titled &quot;Strasbourg/Saint-Denis&quot;, released on the 2008 album &quot;Earfood&quot;, in reference to nearby New Morning jazz club where he often performed. In 2016, French pop band La Femme wrote a song entitled &quot;S.S.D&quot; about Strasbourg–Saint-Denis.

<doc id="504037" wikidata="Q350186" url="?curid=504037" title="Christopher II of Denmark">
<text>Christopher II (; 29 September 1276 – 2 August 1332) was King of Denmark from 1320 to 1326 and again from 1329 until his death. He was a younger son of Eric V. His name is connected with national disaster, as his rule ended in a near-total dissolution of the Danish state.

==Biography==

Being the brother of King Eric VI who reigned from 1286 until 1319, Christopher was a possible heir to the throne. As a young man with the title of Duke of Estonia, he supported the politics of his brother. Among other things he arrested Archbishop Jens Grand in 1294. But later on he joined the opposition and went into exile at the death of Eric in 1319.

The magnates wanted a weak royal power, and Christopher was elected as king in January 1320; in return he signed a contractual håndfæstning, the first time this kind of document was used as a coronation charter. He received a &quot;bankrupt estate&quot; in which entire regions of the kingdom were mortgaged to German and Danish magnates. The conditions of the charter were very hard, because they limited his ability to assess taxes, as well as demanded payments on the mortgages. Christopher could make no decision regarding the realm without the consent of the nobility and the bishops. The privileges of the nobility and the church were included in the charter and new ones were included. No bishop could be imprisoned, exiled, or fined without the pope&#x27;s approval, no secular court could try any churchman, no church land or property could be taxed, the nobles could raise fees or rents on peasants, no noble could be forced to fight abroad or forced to pay to outfit soldiers to fight abroad, the king was required to ransom captured noblemen within a year, all taxes imposed since the reign of Valdemar Sejr on nobles or church were to be lifted, but the kingdom&#x27;s debts were to be paid. This shift of power away from the king would last until 1660.

Despite signing the charter, King Christopher ruled as if it did not exist. Since he could not tax the church or Danish nobles he levied disastrous taxes on the German territories and peasants. During the following years Christopher tried to strengthen his position by reviving Erik&#x27;s policy of warfare against the duchies, counties, and cities of northern Germany. This resulted in new mortgages and taxes, and very soon he was in conflict with both the church and the magnates.

During a rebellion in 1326 he was overthrown by an alliance between Danish magnates and Gerhard III, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg and John I, Count of Holstein-Kiel, son of Adolf IV of Holstein). Christopher was forced into abdication and exile, while the 12-year-old Duke Valdemar of Southern Jutland was made king of Denmark, with Count Gerhard as regent. They forced Valdemar in his coronation charter to separate southern Jutland from Denmark so that never again would the King of Denmark rule there. Danish nobleman Knud Porse took Halland for himself for his services to Count Gerhard and Count Johann. The squabbling over who got which pieces of Denmark broke down the alliances which had forced Christopher out of the country.

Until 1329 Christopher lived in exile, but a growing chaos in the &quot;magnates’ republic&quot; of Denmark gave him another chance. Frictions developed between Gerhard and his cousin John the Mild, Count of Schauenburg and Holstein-Plön and Holstein-Kiel who was also Christopher&#x27;s half-brother through his widowed mother&#x27;s marriage to Gerhard II, Count of Holstein-Plön.

Suddenly, with the help of Henry of Mecklenburg, Christopher stood poised at Vordingborg with 2000 mounted German knights. Unfortunately for Christopher they allowed themselves to be surrounded and were forced to surrender. After a peasant uprising in Jutland which was crushed ruthlessly by Count Gerhard, the peasants in Skåne begged King Magnus IV of Sweden to rule them. He readily accepted and Denmark ceased to exist as a united kingdom.

Christopher was restored as Danish king in 1329–1330 with the cooperation of Count Johan, but this time he was reduced to the position of a puppet from the start. Most of his country was mortgaged, and he had no chance of holding real royal power. Jutland for example was mortgaged for 100,000 silver marks which had to be &quot;laid on the table all at once&quot; or the mortgage was not redeemed. It was an enormous mortgage and impossible to pay. Count Gerhard took all of Jutland as his personal property. Count Johan did the same on Funen and Zealand. In 1331 Christopher attempted to exploit a conflict between Counts Gerhard and Johan by joining the latter, but it ended in a clear military defeat at Dannevirke. Under the terms of the settlement between the counts, Christopher was allowed to retain the title of king, but in reality had no power whatsoever. He was given a simple house at Sakskøbing on Lolland, but even that was burned by German mercenaries. Christopher was imprisoned at Ålholm Castle on Lolland where he died a ruined and broken man the next year. He was buried at Sorø Abbey.

Upon his death Denmark ceased being a formal kingdom, and for the next eight years it was subdued by various mortgagees to German military rule.

==Legacy==
History&#x27;s judgment of Christopher has been extremely hard, and he has often been regarded as a weak, unreliable and incapable tyrant— &quot;the king who mortgaged Denmark to the Germans&quot;. He in many ways simply carried on the policy of his predecessor. The policy of mortgaging parts of Denmark was common practice by nobles and kings alike to raise money. It would be incorrect to call him a passive ruler; the power of the Danish and German high nobility and their co-operation with church establishment undermined his freedom of action.

==Issue==
With his wife, Euphemia of Pomerania, whom he wed before 1307:

*Margaret ( – 1340); married Louis V, Duke of Bavaria
*Eric (1307–1331); married Elizabeth of Holstein-Rendsburg, sister of Count Gerhard III and widow of John II, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg
*Otto, Duke of Lolland and Estonia (1310-aft. 1347)
*Agnes (d. 1312); died young
*Heilwig (born c. 1315)
*Valdemar (1320–1375)

Illegitimate with a lady, who according to legend was of the noble family Lunge:
*Regitze Christofferdatter Løvenbalk, married Peder Stigsen (Krognos) (-1352-1365-) of Krapperup. They can be seen in pedigrees and lexica, but Regitze was not a Løvenbalk.
*Erik Christoffersen Løvenbalk, had issue in Danish nobility.

<doc id="504038" wikidata="Q903245" url="?curid=504038" title="Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer">
<text>:&quot;APXS is also an abbreviation for APache eXtenSion tool, an extension for Apache web servers.&quot;

An alpha particle X-ray spectrometer (APXS) is a spectrometer that analyses the chemical element composition of a sample from scattered alpha particles and fluorescent X-rays after a sample is irradiated with alpha particles and X-rays from radioactive sources. This method of analysing the elemental composition of a sample is most often used on space missions, which require low weight, small size, and minimal power consumption. Other methods (e.g. mass spectrometry) are faster, and do not require the use of radioactive materials, but require larger equipment with greater power requirements. A variation is the alpha proton X-ray spectrometer, such as on the Pathfinder mission, which also detects protons.

Over the years several modified versions of this type of instrument such as APS (without X-ray spectrometer) or APXS have been flown: Surveyor 5-7, Mars Pathfinder, Mars 96, Mars Exploration Rover, Phobos, Mars Science Laboratory and the Philae comet lander. APS/APXS devices will be included on several upcoming missions including the Chandrayaan-2 lunar rover.

== Sources ==

Several forms of radiation are used in APXS. They include alpha particles, protons, and X-rays. Alpha particles, protons, and X-rays are emitted during the radioactive decay of unstable atoms. A common source of alpha particles is curium-244. It emits particles with an energy of 5.8 MeV. X-rays of 14 and 18 keV are emitted in the decay of plutonium-240. The Mars Exploration Rovers&#x27; Athena payload uses curium-244 with a source strength of approximately .

== Alpha particles ==
Some of the alpha particles of a defined energy are backscattered to the detector if they collide with an atomic nucleus. The physical laws for Rutherford backscattering in an angle close to 180° are conservation of energy and conservation of linear momentum. This makes it possible to calculate the mass of the nucleus hit by the alpha particle.

Light elements absorb more energy of the alpha particle, while alpha particles are reflected by heavy nuclei nearly with the same energy. The energy spectrum of the scattered alpha particle shows peaks from 25% up to nearly 100% of the initial alpha particles. This spectrum makes it possible to determine the composition of the sample, especially for the lighter elements. The low backscattering rate makes prolonged irradiation necessary, approximately 10 hours.

== Protons ==

Some of the alpha particles are absorbed by the atomic nuclei. The [alpha,proton] process produces protons of a defined energy which are detected. Sodium, magnesium, silicon, aluminium and sulfur can be detected by this method. This method was only used in the Mars Pathfinder APXS. For the Mars Exploration Rovers the proton detector was replaced by a second alpha particle sensor. So it is also called alpha particle X-ray spectrometer.

== X-ray ==

The alpha particles are also able to eject electrons from the inner shell (K- and L-shell) of an atom. These vacancies are filled by electrons from outer shells, which results in the emission of a characteristic X-ray. This process is termed particle-induced X-ray emission and is relatively easy to detect and has its best sensitivity and resolution for the heavier elements.

<text>In Ireland, the National Day of Commemoration () commemorates all Irish people who died in past wars or United Nations peacekeeping missions. It occurs on the Sunday nearest 11 July (see Irish Calendar), the anniversary of the date in 1921 that a truce was signed ending the Irish War of Independence. The principal ceremony is held at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, Dublin, Ireland.

==Background==
The commemoration of Irish soldiers and wars has been fragmented within Ireland for historical and political reasons.

Ceremonies to honour Irish soldiers who fought in the First World War have been held in Ireland in November on Remembrance Sunday and Remembrance Day since the war&#x27;s end. These are mainly organised by the Royal British Legion and observed by Unionists and ex-servicemen and relatives. The focal points were St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and the Irish National War Memorial Gardens, both in Dublin. Though many Irish nationalists served in Irish regiments of the British Army prior to independence, this was not generally held in high esteem by later generations. Independent Ireland remained neutral in World War II, and although thousands of its citizens served in the allied armies, the state did not at first mark this.

Commemoration of the Irish War of Independence was muted by the bitterness of the Irish Civil War that followed from it. The preceding 1916 Easter Rising against British rule in Ireland was the focus, with Easter Day considered the &quot;National Day of Commemoration&quot;. There was a major parade each Easter until 1971, when the Troubles in Northern Ireland made the commemoration of the earlier Irish Republican rebels more problematic in symbolism. Smaller official commemorations persisted at Arbour Hill Prison.

Within the Defence Forces, a Commemoration Day for deceased former members is held on All Souls&#x27; Day, 2 November. 11 July, the anniversary of the 1921 truce, had already been a special Army holiday before being the base date for the National Day of Commemoration.

==Establishment==
In 1974, the coalition government proposed Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day as a day for commemorating all Irish people who had given their lives in wars, marked with a message from the President, prayer and a moment of silence. The Fianna Fáil opposition objected. In the early 1980s, in response to the Northern Ireland Troubles, the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation in County Wicklow was organising &quot;Walks of Remembrance&quot; around sites in Dublin significant to all historical combatants. In 1983, the Irish Defence Forces were represented in the British Legion&#x27;s Remembrance Sunday service in Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin, under the flag of the United Nations. This was controversial and the Fianna Fáil opposition suggested a separate day of commemoration would be more inclusive.

An informal Oireachtas all-party committee was established in late 1984 to examine the question of a single National Day of Commemoration. It held four meetings and reported to the government in October 1985. The view of this committee was that there should be a religious service and a military ceremony. This has been the tradition since, although Noel Treacy complained that the military presence was &quot;on a small scale compared with that visualised by the all party committee&quot;.

The first National Day of Commemoration was held on 13 July 1986 in the Garden of Remembrance. Old IRA veterans objected to the venue, which commemorates those who died in &quot;the cause of Irish freedom&quot;, being used to honour British Army veterans. The absence was noted of Leader of the Opposition, Charles Haughey, and Lord Mayor of Dublin, Bertie Ahern, both represented by subordinates. This was ascribed to discontent within Fianna Fáil about the event.

Haughey became Taoiseach after the February 1987 election. He announced the commemoration ceremony would be replaced by separate church services by the various denominations, with no military or government presence. The opposition parties objected, and both sides negotiated a compromise, whereby the ceremony, and the commemorative plaque which had been unveiled in 1986 by President Patrick Hillery, were moved to the Royal Hospital. This, originally a British Army hospital, is now the Irish Museum of Modern Art. However Irish Republicans and some IRA veterans of the Irish War of Independence objected to the presence of the British Legion at the ceremony. Subsequent ceremonies have not proved controversial.

==Ceremonies==
One of the main recommendations made by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee was that the National Day of Commemoration should be organised in a way which would reflect its national importance, which would encourage people of different traditions to participate and which would attract the interest and support of the public. The current service and ceremonies closely follow these recommendations.

The military and religious ceremonies are held in the presence of the President, the Taoiseach and other members of the Government of Ireland, members of the Oireachtas, the Council of State, the Diplomatic Corps, the Judiciary, relatives of 1916 leaders, next-of-kin of those who died on service with the UN, Northern Ireland representatives and a wide cross-section of the community, including ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen.

Representatives of the three divisions of the Defence Forces parade and render military honours.
Since its inception, music has been provided by the combined bands of the several Army Commands and Dr. Bernadette Greevy until her death in September 2008.

The ceremonies begin with an interfaith service, comprising prayers, hymns and readings by senior representatives of the main Christian denominations and of the Jewish and (since 1994) Islamic faiths.

The military ceremonies include an honour guard of the Cadet School, the laying of a wreath by the President on behalf of the people of Ireland, Reveille, the raising of the national flag and the playing of the National Anthem.

The National Day of Commemoration is, along with Easter Sunday, Easter Monday, and Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, one of the days on which the Department of the Taoiseach&#x27;s protocol section has advised all government buildings to fly the national flag.

The main 2012 ceremony moved from the Royal Hospital Kilmainham to the Collins Barracks campus of the National Museum of Ireland, as the Kilmainham site closed for renovation. Regional ceremonies are planned for Sligo City Hall; Kilkenny Castle; NUI Galway; Fitzgerald&#x27;s Park, Cork; Limerick City Hall; and Bishops Palace Museum, Waterford.

The ceremony returned to the Royal Hospital in 2013.

<text>Beat Solèr, (born 8 July 1971) better known by his stage name Seelenluft, is a Swiss record producer of electronic music.

==Career==
Seelenluft is Beat Soler from Zürich. He has been playing music since he was seven. He made a number of records in the 2000s.
