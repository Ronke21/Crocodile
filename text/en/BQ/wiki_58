<text>The Organon (, meaning &quot;instrument, tool, organ&quot;) is the standard collection of Aristotle&#x27;s six works on logical analysis and dialectic. The name &quot;Organon&quot; was given by Aristotle&#x27;s followers, the Peripatetics, who maintained against the Stoics that Logic was &quot;an instrument&quot; of Philosophy.

Aristotle never uses the title &quot;Organon&quot; to refer to his logical works. The book, according to M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire, was not called &quot;Organon&quot; before the 15th century, and the treatises were collected into one volume, as is supposed, about the time of Andronicus of Rhodes; and it was translated into Latin by Boethius about the 6th century. 

The six works of Organon are as follows:

== Constitution of the texts ==

The order of the works is not chronological (which is now hard to determine) but was deliberately chosen by Theophrastus to constitute a well-structured system. Indeed, parts of them seem to be a scheme of a lecture on logic. The arrangement of the works was made by Andronicus of Rhodes around 40 BC.

Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot; has some points of overlap with the works making up the &quot;Organon&quot; but is not traditionally considered part of it; additionally, there are works on logic attributed, with varying degrees of plausibility, to Aristotle that were not known to the Peripatetics.

# The &quot;Categories&quot; (Latin: ) introduces Aristotle&#x27;s 10-fold classification of that which exists: substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, situation, condition, action, and passion.
# &quot;On Interpretation&quot; (Latin: ) introduces Aristotle&#x27;s conception of proposition and judgement, and the various relations between affirmative, negative, universal, and particular propositions. Aristotle discusses the square of opposition or square of Apuleius in Chapter 7 and its appendix, Chapter 8. Chapter 9 deals with the problem of future contingents. 
# The &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; (Latin: ) introduces his syllogistic method (see term logic), argues for its correctness, and discusses inductive inference.
# The &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot; (Latin: ) deals with definition, demonstration, inductive reasoning, and scientific knowledge.
# The &quot;Topics&quot; (Latin: ) treats issues in constructing valid arguments, and inference that is probable, rather than certain. It is in this treatise that Aristotle mentions the Predicables, later discussed by Porphyry and the scholastic logicians.
# The &quot;On Sophistical Refutations&quot; (Latin: ) gives a treatment of logical fallacies, and provides a key link to Aristotle&#x27;s tractate on rhetoric.

Whereas the &quot;Organon&quot; of the Latin Scholastic tradition comprises only the above six works, its independent reception in the Arabic medieval world saw appended to this list of works Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetoric&quot; and &quot;Poetics&quot;.

== Influence ==

The &quot;Organon&quot; was used in the school founded by Aristotle at the Lyceum, and some parts of the works seem to be a scheme of a lecture on logic. So much so that after Aristotle&#x27;s death, his publishers (Andronicus of Rhodes in 50 BC, for example) collected these works.

Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century, much of Aristotle&#x27;s work was lost in the Latin West. The &quot;Categories&quot; and &quot;On Interpretation&quot; are the only significant logical works that were available in the early Middle Ages. These had been translated into Latin by Boethius, along with Porphyry&#x27;s Isagoge, which was also translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; via a Syriac intermediary. The other logical works were not available in Western Christendom until translated into Latin in the 12th century. However, the original Greek texts had been preserved in the Greek-speaking lands of the Eastern Roman Empire (aka Byzantium). In the mid-twelfth century, James of Venice translated into Latin the &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot; from Greek manuscripts found in Constantinople.

The books of Aristotle were available in the early Muslim world, and after 750 AD Muslims had most of them, including the &quot;Organon&quot;, translated into Arabic, normally via earlier Syriac translations. They were studied by Islamic and Jewish scholars, including Rabbi Moses Maimonides (1135–1204) and the Muslim Judge Ibn Rushd, known in the West as Averroes (1126–1198); both were originally from Córdoba, Spain, although the former left Iberia and by 1168 lived in Egypt.

All the major scholastic philosophers wrote commentaries on the &quot;Organon&quot;. Aquinas, Ockham and Scotus wrote commentaries on &quot;On Interpretation&quot;. Ockham and Scotus wrote commentaries on the &quot;Categories&quot; and &quot;Sophistical Refutations&quot;. Grosseteste wrote an influential commentary on the &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;.

In the Enlightenment there was a revival of interest in logic as the basis of rational enquiry, and a number of texts, most successfully the Port-Royal Logic, polished Aristotelian term logic for pedagogy. During this period, while the logic certainly was based on that of Aristotle, Aristotle&#x27;s writings themselves were less often the basis of study. There was a tendency in this period to regard the logical systems of the day to be complete, which in turn no doubt stifled innovation in this area. However, Francis Bacon published his &quot;Novum Organum&quot; (&quot;The New &quot;Organon&quot;&quot;) as a scathing attack in 1620. Immanuel Kant thought that there was nothing else to invent after the work of Aristotle, and the famous logic historian Karl von Prantl claimed that any logician who said anything new about logic was &quot;confused, stupid or perverse.&quot; These examples illustrate the force of influence which Aristotle&#x27;s works on logic had. Indeed, he had already become known by the Scholastics (medieval Christian scholars) as &quot;The Philosopher&quot;, due to the influence he had upon medieval theology and philosophy. His influence continued into the Early Modern period and Organon was the basis of school philosophy even in the beginning of the 18th century.
Since the logical innovations of the 19th century, particularly the formulation of modern predicate logic, Aristotelian logic had for a time fallen out of favor among many analytic philosophers.

However, the logic historian John Corcoran and others have shown that the works of George Boole and Gottlob Frege—which laid the groundwork for modern mathematical logic—each represent a continuation and extension to Aristotle&#x27;s logic and in no way contradict or displace it.
Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle&#x27;s logic, and Frege included Aristotle&#x27;s square of opposition at the end of his groundbreaking &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; to show the harmony of his theory with the Aristotelian tradition.

<text>Rudolf Jakob Camerarius or Camerer (12 February 1665 – 11 September 1721) was a German botanist and physician.

==Life==
Camerarius was born at Tübingen, and became professor of medicine and director of the botanical gardens at Tübingen in 1687. He is chiefly known for his investigations on the reproductive organs of plants (&quot;De sexu plantarum epistola&quot; (1694)).

While other botanists, such as John Ray and Nehemiah Grew, had observed that plants seemed to have sex in some form, and guessed that pollen was the male fertilizing agent, it was Camerarius who did experimental work. In studying the mulberry, he determined that female plants not near to male (staminate) plants produced fruit but with no seeds. &quot;Mercurialis&quot; and spinach plants fared likewise. With the castor oil plant (&quot;Ricinus&quot;) and with maize he cut off the staminate flowers (the &quot;tassels&quot; of maize), and likewise observed that no seeds formed. His results were reported in the form of a letter (the &quot;epistola&quot;), and attracted immediate attention, subsequent workers extending his results from the monoecious plants he had studied to dioecious ones as well.

<text>REDUCE is a general-purpose computer algebra system originally geared towards applications in physics.

The development of REDUCE was started in 1963 by Anthony C. Hearn; since then, many scientists from all over the world have contributed to its development. REDUCE was open-sourced in December 2008 and is available for free under a modified BSD license on SourceForge. Previously it had cost $695.

REDUCE is written entirely in its own Lisp dialect called Standard Lisp, expressed in an ALGOL-like syntax called RLISP that is also used as the basis for REDUCE&#x27;s user-level language.

Implementations of REDUCE are available on most variants of Unix, Linux, Microsoft Windows, or Apple Macintosh systems by using an underlying Portable Standard Lisp (PSL) or Codemist Standard Lisp (CSL) implementation. CSL REDUCE offers a graphical user interface. REDUCE can also be built on other Lisps, such as Common Lisp.

== Features ==
* arbitrary precision integer, rational, complex and floating-point arithmetic
* expressions and functions involving one or more variables
* algorithms for polynomials, rational and transcendental functions
* facilities for the solution of a variety of algebraic equations
* automatic and user-controlled simplification of expressions
* substitutions and pattern matching in a wide variety of forms
* symbolic differentiation, indefinite and definite integration
* solution of ordinary differential equations
* computations with a wide variety of special functions
* general matrix and non-commutative algebra
* plotting in 2 and 3 dimensions of
** graphs of functions 
** arbitrary points, lines and curves
* Dirac matrix calculations of interest in high energy physics
* quantifier elimination and decision for interpreted first-order logic
* powerful intuitive user-level programming language.

== Syntax ==
The REDUCE language is a high-level structured programming language based on ALGOL 60 (but with Standard Lisp semantics), although it does not support all ALGOL 60 syntax. It is similar to Pascal, which evolved from ALGOL 60, and Modula, which evolved from Pascal.

REDUCE is a free-form language, meaning that spacing and line breaks are not significant, but consequently input statements must be separated from each other and all input must be terminated with either a semi-colon (codice_1) or a dollar sign (codice_2). The difference is that if the input results in a useful (non-codice_3) value then it will be output if the separator is a semi-colon (codice_1) but hidden if it is a dollar sign (codice_2). The assignment operator is colon-equal (codice_6), which in its simplest usage assigns to the variable on its left the value of the expression on its right. However, a REDUCE variable can have no value, in which case it is displayed as its name, in order to allow mathematical expressions involving indeterminates to be constructed and manipulated. The simplest way to use REDUCE is interactively: type input after the last input prompt, terminate it with semi-colon and press the &quot;Return&quot; or &quot;Enter&quot; key; REDUCE processes the input and displays the result. This is illustrated in the screenshot.

=== Identifiers and strings ===
Programming languages use identifiers to name constructs such as variables and functions, and strings to store text. A REDUCE identifier must begin with a letter and can be followed by letters, digits and underscore characters (codice_7). A REDUCE identifier can also include any character anywhere if it is input preceded by an exclamation mark (codice_8). A REDUCE string is any sequence of characters delimited when input by double quote characters (codice_9). A double quote can be included in a string by entering two double quotes; no other escape mechanism is implemented within strings. An identifier can be used instead of a string in most situations in REDUCE, such as to represent a file name.

REDUCE source code was originally written in all upper-case letters, as were all programming languages in the 1960s. (Hence, the name REDUCE is normally written in all upper-case.) However, modern REDUCE is case-insensitive (by default), which means that it ignores the case of letters, and it is normally written in lower-case. (The REDUCE source code has been converted to lower case.) The exceptions to this rule are that case is preserved within strings and when letters in identifiers are preceded by an exclamation mark (codice_8). Hence, it is conventional to use snake-case (e.g. codice_11) rather than camel-case (e.g. codice_12) for REDUCE identifiers, because camel-case gets lost without also using exclamation marks.

=== Hello World programs ===
Below is a REDUCE &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program, which is almost as short as such a program could possibly be!

&quot;Hello, World!&quot;;

REDUCE displays the output

Hello, World!

Another REDUCE &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program, which is slightly longer than the version above, uses an identifier as follows

!Hello!,! !World!!;

CSL REDUCE displays the same output as shown above. (Other REDUCE GUIs may italicise this output on the grounds that it is an identifier rather than a string.)

=== Statements and expressions ===
Because REDUCE inherits Lisp semantics, all programming constructs have values. Therefore, the only distinction between statements and expressions is that the value of an expression is used but the value of a statement is not. The terms &quot;statement&quot; and &quot;expression&quot; are interchangeable, although a few constructs always return the Lisp value codice_3 and so are always used as statements.

There are two ways to group several statements or expressions into a single unit that is syntactically equivalent to a single statement or expression, which is necessary to facilitate structured programming. One is the codice_14...codice_15 construct inherited from ALGOL 60, which is called a &quot;block&quot; or &quot;compound&quot; statement. Its value is the value of the expression following the (optional) keyword codice_16. The other uses the bracketing syntax codice_17...codice_18, which is called a &quot;group&quot; statement. Its value is the value of the last (unterminated) expression in it. Both are illustrated below in the procedural programming example below.

=== Structured programming ===
REDUCE supports conditional and repetition statements, some of which are controlled by a &quot;boolean expression&quot;, which is any expression whose value can be either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, such as formula_1. (The REDUCE user-level language does not explicitly support constants representing &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; although, as in C and related languages, 0 has the boolean value &quot;false&quot;, whereas 1 and many other non-zero values have the boolean value &quot;true&quot;.)

==== Conditional statements: if ... then ... else ====
The conditional statement has the form

codice_19 &quot;boolean expression&quot; codice_20 &quot;statement&quot;

which can optionally be followed by

codice_21 &quot;statement&quot;

For example, the following conditional statement ensures that the value of formula_2, assumed to be numerical, is positive. (It effectively implements the absolute value function.)

if n &lt; 0 then n := -n

The following conditional statement, used as an expression, avoids an error that would be caused by dividing by 0.

recip_x := if x = 0 then infinity else 1/x
==== Repetition statements: for ... ====
The codice_22 statement is a flexible loop construct that executes &quot;statement&quot; repeatedly a number of times that must be known in advance. One version has the form

codice_22 &quot;variable&quot; := &quot;initial&quot; codice_24 &quot;increment&quot; codice_25 &quot;final&quot; codice_26 &quot;statement&quot;

where &quot;variable&quot; names a variable whose value can be used within &quot;statement&quot;, and &quot;initial, increment&quot; and &quot;final&quot; are numbers (preferably integers). The value of &quot;variable&quot; is initialized to &quot;initial&quot; and &quot;statement&quot; is executed, then the value of &quot;variable&quot; is repeatedly increased by &quot;increment&quot; and the &quot;statement&quot; executed again, provided the value of &quot;variable&quot; is not greater than &quot;final&quot;. The common special case &quot;&quot;initial&quot; codice_27 &quot;final&quot; can be abbreviated as &quot;initial&quot; : &quot;final&quot;&quot;.

The following codice_22 statement computes the value of formula_3 as the value of the variable codice_29.

n := 5;
fac := 1$ for r := 2 : n do fac := fac*r; fac;
Another version of the codice_22 statement iterates over a list, and the keyword codice_26 can be replaced by codice_32, codice_33, codice_34 or codice_35, in which case the codice_22 statement becomes an expression and the controlled &quot;statement&quot; is treated as an expression. With codice_32, the value is the product of the values of the controlled &quot;statement&quot;; with codice_33, the value is the sum of the values of the controlled &quot;statement&quot;; with codice_34, the value is the values of the controlled &quot;statement&quot; collected into a list; with codice_35, the value is the values of the controlled &quot;statement&quot;, which must be lists, joined into one list.

The following codice_22 statement computes the value of formula_3 much more succinctly and elegantly than the previous example.

n := 5;
for r := 2 : n product r;
==== Repetition statements: while ... do; repeat ... until ====
The two loop statements

codice_42 &quot;boolean expression&quot; codice_26 &quot;statement&quot;codice_44 &quot;statement&quot; codice_25 &quot;boolean expression&quot;

are closely related to the conditional statement and execute &quot;statement&quot; repeatedly a number of times that need not be known in advance. Their difference is that codice_42 repetition stops when &quot;boolean expression&quot; becomes false whereas codice_44 repetition stops when &quot;boolean expression&quot; becomes true. Also, codice_44 always executes &quot;statement&quot; at least once and it can be used to initialize &quot;boolean expression&quot;, whereas when using codice_42 &quot;boolean expression&quot; must be initialized before entering the loop.

The following codice_42 statement computes the value of formula_3 as the value of the variable codice_29. Note that this code treats the assignment codice_52 as an expression and uses its value.

n := 5;
fac := n$ while n &gt; 1 do fac := fac*(n := n - 1); fac;
=== Comments ===
REDUCE has three comment conventions. It inherits the &quot;comment statement&quot; from ALGOL 60, which looks like this:
 comment This is a multi-line comment
 that ends at the next separator,
 so it cannot contain separators;
Comment statements mostly appear in older code.

It inherits the codice_53... comment from Standard Lisp, which looks like this:
 % This is a single-line comment that ends at the end of the line.
 % It can appear on a line after code and
 % can contain the separators &quot;;&quot; and &quot;$&quot;.
codice_53... comments are analogous to C++ codice_55... comments and are the most commonly used form of comment.

REDUCE also supports a C-style codice_56...codice_57 comment that looks like this:
 /* This is a multi-line comment that can
 appear anywhere a space could and
 can contain the separators &quot;;&quot; and &quot;$&quot;.

== Programming paradigms ==
REDUCE&#x27;s user-level language supports several programming paradigms, as illustrated in the algebraic programming examples below.

Since it is based on Lisp, which is a functional programming language, REDUCE supports functional programming and all statements have values (although they are not always useful). REDUCE also supports procedural programming by ignoring statement values. Algebraic computation usually proceeds by transforming a mathematical expression into an equivalent but different form. This is called &quot;simplification&quot;, even though the result might be much longer. (The name &quot;REDUCE&quot; is a pun on this problem of &quot;intermediate expression swell&quot;!) In REDUCE, simplification occurs automatically when an expression is entered or computed, controlled by &quot;simplification rules&quot; and &quot;switches&quot;. In this way, REDUCE supports rule-based programming, which is the classic REDUCE programming paradigm. In early versions of REDUCE, rules and switches could only be set globally, but modern REDUCE also supports local setting of rules and switches, meaning that they control the simplification of only one expression. REDUCE programs often contain a mix of programming paradigms.

== Algebraic programming examples ==
The screenshot shows simple interactive use.

As a simple programming example, consider the problem of computing the formula_2th Taylor polynomial of the function formula_7 about the point formula_8, which is given by the formula formula_9. Here, formula_10 denotes the formula_11th derivative of formula_12 evaluated at the point formula_13 and formula_14 denotes the factorial of formula_11. (However, note that REDUCE includes sophisticated facilities for power-series expansion.)

As an &quot;example of functional programming&quot; in REDUCE, here is an easy way to compute the 5th Taylor polynomial of formula_16 about 0. In the following code, the control variable codice_58 takes values from 0 through 5 in steps of 1, codice_59 is the REDUCE differentiation operator and the operator codice_60 performs substitution of its first argument into its second. Note that this code is very similar to the mathematical formula above (with formula_17 and formula_18).
for r := 0:5 sum sub(x = 0, df(sin x, x, r))*x^r/factorial r;

produces by default the output
formula_19
This is correct, but it doesn&#x27;t look much like a Taylor series. That can be fixed by changing a few output-control switches and then evaluating the special variable codice_61, which stands for workspace and holds the last non-empty output expression:

off allfac; on revpri, div; ws;

formula_20

As an &quot;example of procedural programming&quot; in REDUCE, here is a procedure to compute the general Taylor polynomial, which works for functions that are well-behaved at the expansion point formula_13.
procedure my_taylor(f, x, x0, n);
 % Return the nth Taylor polynomial of f
 % as a function of x about x0.
 begin scalar result := sub(x = x0, f), mul := 1;
 for r := 1:n do «
 f := df(f, x);
 mul := mul*(x - x0)/r;
 result := result + sub(x = x0, f)*mul
 return result
 end;

The procedure is called codice_62 because REDUCE already includes an operator called codice_63. All the text following a codice_53 sign up to the end of the line is a comment. The keyword codice_65 introduces and initializes two local variables, codice_66 and codice_67. The keywords codice_14 and codice_15 delimit a block of code that may include local variables and may return a value, whereas the symbols codice_17 and codice_18 delimit a group of statements without introducing local variables.

The procedure may be called as follows to compute the same Taylor polynomial as above.

my_taylor(sin x, x, 0, 5);
== File and package handling ==
REDUCE GUIs provide menu support for some or all of the file and package handling described below.

=== File handling ===
In order to develop non-trivial computations, it is convenient to store source code in a file and have REDUCE read it instead of interactive input. REDUCE input should be plain text (not rich text as produced by word-processing applications). REDUCE filenames are arbitrary. The REDUCE source code uses the filename extension codice_72 for the main source code and codice_73 for the test files, and for that reason REDUCE GUIs such as CSL REDUCE normally offer to input files with those extensions by default, but on platforms such as Microsoft Windows the extension codice_74 may be more convenient. It is recommended to end a REDUCE input file with the line
 ;end;
as an end-of-file marker. This is something of a historical quirk but it avoids potential warning messages. Apart from that, an input file can contain whatever might be entered interactively into REDUCE. The command
 codice_75 &quot;file1&quot;codice_76 &quot;file2&quot;codice_76 ...
inputs each of the named files in succession into REDUCE, essentially as if their contents had been entered interactively, after which REDUCE waits for further interactive input. If the separator used to terminate this command is a semi-colon (codice_1) then the file content is echoed as output; if the separator is a dollar sign (codice_2) then the file content is not echoed.

REDUCE filenames can be either absolute or relative to the current directory; when using a REDUCE GUI absolute filenames are safer because it is not obvious what the current directory is! Filenames can be specified as either strings or identifiers; strings (in double quotes) are usually more convenient because otherwise filename elements such as directory separators and dots must be escaped with an exclamation mark (codice_8). Note that the Microsoft Windows directory or folder separator, backslash (codice_81), does not need to be doubled in REDUCE strings because backslash is not an escape character in REDUCE, but REDUCE on Microsoft Windows also accepts forward slash (codice_82) as the directory separator.

REDUCE output can be directed to a file instead of the interactive display by executing the command
 codice_83 &quot;file&quot;codice_1
Output redirection can be terminated permanenty by executing the command
 codice_85 &quot;file&quot;codice_1
or temporarily by executing the command
 codice_87
There are similar mechanisms for directing a compiled version of the REDUCE input to a file and loading compiled code, which is the basis for building REDUCE and can be used to extend it.

=== Loading packages ===
REDUCE is composed of a number of packages; some are pre-loaded, some are auto-loaded when needed, and some must be explicitly loaded before they can be used. The command
 codice_88 &quot;package1&quot;codice_76 &quot;package2&quot;codice_76 ...
loads each of the named packages in succession into REDUCE. Package names are &quot;not&quot; filenames; they are simple identifiers that do not need any exclamation marks, so they are normally input as identifiers, although they can be input as strings. A package consists of one or more files of compiled Lisp code, and the codice_88 command ensures that the right files are loaded in the right order. The precise filenames and locations depend on the version of Lisp on which REDUCE is built, but the package names are always the same.

== Types and variable scope ==
REDUCE inherits dynamic scoping from Lisp, which means that data have types but variables themselves do not: the type of a variable is the type of the data assigned to it. The simplest REDUCE data types are Standard Lisp atomic types such as identifiers, machine numbers (i.e. &quot;small&quot; integers and floating-point numbers supported directly by the computer hardware), and strings. Most other REDUCE data types are represented internally as Lisp lists whose first element (codice_92) indicates the data type. For example, the REDUCE input

mat((1, 2), (3, 4));

produces the display
formula_22
and the internal representation of this matrix is the Lisp list
 (mat (1 2) (3 4))
The main algebraic objects used in REDUCE are quotients of two possibly-multivariate polynomials, the indeterminates of which, called &quot;kernels&quot;, may in fact be functions of one or more variables, e.g. the input

z := (x + y^2)/f(x,y);

produces the display
formula_23
REDUCE uses two representations for such algebraic objects. One is called &quot;prefix form&quot;, which is just the Standard Lisp code for the expression and is convenient for operations such as input and output; e.g. for formula_24 it is
 (quotient (plus x (expt y 2)) (f x y))
The other is called &quot;standard quotient&quot; form, which is better for performing algebraic manipulations such as addition; e.g. for formula_24 it is
 (!*sq ((((x . 1) . 1) ((y . 2) . 1)) (((f x y) . 1) . 1)) t)
REDUCE converts between these two representations as necessary, but tries to retain &quot;standard quotient&quot; form as much as possible to avoid the conversion overhead.

Because variables have no types there are no variable type declarations in REDUCE, but there are variable scope declarations. The scope of a variable refers to the range of a program throughout which it has the same significance. By default, REDUCE variables are automatically global in scope, meaning that they have the same significance everywhere, i.e. once a variable has been assigned a value, it will evaluate to that same value everywhere. Variables can be declared to have scope limited to a particular block of code by delimiting that block of code by the keywords codice_14 and codice_15, and declaring the variables codice_65 at the start of the block, using the following syntax (as illustrated in the algebraic programming examples above):
 codice_14 codice_65 &quot;variable1&quot;, &quot;variable2&quot;, ...;
 &quot;statements&quot;
 codice_15
Each variable so declared can optionally be followed by an assignment operator (codice_6) and an initial value. The keyword codice_65 should be read as meaning &quot;local&quot;. (The reason for the name &quot;scalar&quot; is buried in the history of REDUCE, but it was probably chosen to distinguish local variables from the relativistic 4-vectors and Dirac gamma matrices defined in the high-energy physics package, which was the original core of REDUCE.)

The codice_65 keyword can be replaced by codice_102 or codice_103. The difference is that codice_102 variables are initialized by default to 0, whereas codice_65 and codice_103 variables are initialized by default to the Lisp value codice_3 (which has the algebraic value 0 anyway). This distinction is more significant in the REDUCE implementation language, RLISP, also known as &quot;symbolic&quot; or &quot;lisp mode&quot;. Otherwise, it is useful as documentation of the intended use of local variables.

There are two other variable declarations that are used only in the implementation of REDUCE, i.e. in symbolic mode. The REDUCE codice_14...codice_15 block described above is translated into a Standard Lisp codice_110 form by the REDUCE parser, and all Standard Lisp variables should either be bound in codice_110 forms, or declared codice_112 or codice_113. In RLISP, these declarations look like this:
 codice_114&quot;variable1&quot; &quot;variable2&quot; ...codice_115
 codice_116&quot;variable1&quot; &quot;variable2&quot; ...codice_115
A codice_112 variable cannot be rebound in a codice_110 form, whereas a codice_113 variable can. This distinction is normally only significant to a Lisp compiler and is used to maximize efficiency; in interpreted code these declarations can be skipped and undeclared variables are effectively codice_113.

== Graphics ==
REDUCE supports graphical display via gnuplot, which is an independent portable open-source graphics package that is included in all REDUCE binary distributions. The REDUCE GNUPLOT package supports the display of curves or surfaces defined by formulas and/or data sets via the command codice_122...codice_115. This command exposes some, but not all, of the capabilities of gnuplot. The REDUCE TURTLE and LOGOTURTLE packages are built on the REDUCE GNUPLOT package and support turtle graphics in two dimensions; the LOGOTURTLE package also exposes additional capabilities of gnuplot, such as control of colour and line thickness, filling and text annotations.

== Available implementations and supported platforms ==
REDUCE is available from SourceForge. Binary distributions are released a few times a year with no fixed schedule as snapshots of the Subversion repository, and also offer compressed archive snapshots of the full source code. SourceForge can be set up to notify users when a new release is available. In 2024, binary distributions were released for 64-bit versions of macOS, Linux (Debian and Red Hat based systems) and Microsoft Windows. The installers either include or are available for both CSL- and PSL-REDUCE, and may include the REDUCE source code. REDUCE can be built from the source code on a larger range of platforms and on other Lisp systems, such as Common Lisp.

<text>The Metro is a supermini car, later a city car that was produced from 1980 to 1998, first by British Leyland (BL) and later by the Rover Group. It was launched in 1980 as the Austin Mini Metro (styled AUSTIN miniMETRO).

The Mini Metro was intended to complement and eventually replace the original BMC Mini, and was developed under the codename LC8. The MG version of the Metro was named &quot;Car of The Year&quot; 1983 by &quot;What Car?&quot; magazine, and later once more, as the Rover Metro, in 1991.

During its 18-year lifespan, the Metro wore many names: Austin Metro, MG Metro and Rover Metro. It was rebadged as the Rover 100 (full name: &quot;Rover 100 series&quot;) in December 1994. There was also a van version, known as the Morris Metro, and later, the Metrovan.

At the time of its launch, the Metro was sold under the Austin brand, and from 1982 MG versions became available. During 1987, the badge lost the Austin name, and the car was sold simply as the &quot;Metro&quot;. From 1990 until its withdrawal in 1998, the Metro sported the Rover brand name.

Although the R3-generation Rover 200 (introduced in 1995 and smaller than previous 200 models) had originally been designed as a replacement for the Metro, it was not marketed as such after its launch. The Rover 100 finally ceased production in 1998, being outlived (by three years) by the original Mini that it was meant to replace. 2,078,218 Metros of all types were built.


==Austin/MG Metro==

Plans for a replacement for the Mini had been afoot within BL since the early 1970s, but none of the concepts conceived got beyond the initial design stages, largely due to a shortage of funds at British Leyland, and its eventual bankruptcy and government bailout in 1975. The modern supermini market had evolved during the 1970s, with earlier small cars like the Mini and Hillman Imp being followed mostly by cars of a two-box hatchback configuration, beginning with the Fiat 127 in 1971 and Renault 5 in 1972, with the next five years seeing the arrival of similar cars including the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo, as well as the Vauxhall Chevette from General Motors (known in West Germany as the Opel Kadett) which was also available as a saloon and estate in addition to the hatchback. These cars gained a decent-sized market share in Britain and most other European markets.

On 8 October 1980, BL introduced the Austin Mini Metro. The roots of the Metro lay in an earlier project denoted as &quot;ADO88&quot; (Amalgamated Drawing Office, 88-inch wheelbase), which was intended to be a direct replacement for the Mini. However, poor reception of the ADO88 design at customer clinics and the increasing dominance of superminis in the ADO88&#x27;s intended market segment forced a major change in the project&#x27;s focus. In late 1977, BL chairman Michael Edwardes ordered that ADO88 be given an eleventh-hour redesign to make it both larger, and less utilitarian in appearance / more upmarket in nature. It thus became BL&#x27;s first supermini rather than an economy car. The revised project was given the designator LC8 (Leyland Cars Number 8), and the definitive Metro design would ultimately emerge under the leadership of BL&#x27;s chief stylists David Bache and Harris Mann. LC8 would replace the more upmarket, lower-volume Clubman versions of the Mini and the lower-spec, smaller-engined variants of the Austin Allegro (which would be fully replaced in the early 1980s by project LC10, which became the Austin Maestro). The ADO88 project had experimented with new engines and suspension systems, but, with limited time and budgets, LC8 would reuse much of the Mini&#x27;s engineering (the A-Series engine, front-wheel drive via a sump-mounted four-speed transmission, front and rear running gear carried in steel subframes separate from the unitary bodyshell) and borrow the Hydragas suspension system developed for the Allegro. The floorpan and core structure of ADO88 was retained largely unmodified, but every external panel was changed as part of its transition into LC8.

However, while much was shared conceptually with older BL models, LC8 would see these design elements heavily re-engineered and modernised. For instance the A-Series drivetrain was extensively updated with new materials and tooling to become the A-Plus, while the new car would feature 12-inch wheels, and all LC8s would have servo-assisted four-piston front disc brakes with fully split hydraulic systems, as opposed to the entry-level, standard Mini which at the time still had 10-inch wheels and drum brakes all-round. These new drivetrains, wheels, brakes and many other featured developed for the LC8 would be introduced on the Mini not long afterwards, updating the 30-year old design at minimal extra cost, and providing highly desirable economies of scale, given the anticipated sales volumes of the new car. This would make it cost effective for the more basic versions of the Mini to remain in production as an entry-level model for BL, continuing in the market niche originally intended for ADO88, while allowing the LC8 to aim higher, and compete head-on with the generally longer bodied superminis of other brands.

Following the Ryder Report, which prioritized the ADO88/LC8 project, Longbridge was expanded in 1978 with a £200mn robotised body assembly line (known as the &quot;New West Works&quot;) to enable it to produce the new model, which it was hoped would sell 100,000 or more units a year in Britain alone. Production of the smaller Mini and larger Allegro was also pruned back to enable the plant to produce as many units of the Metro as possible, with the Allegro finally being axed in 1982 to make way for the Maestro.

The hatchback bodyshell was one of the most spacious of its time, and this was a significant factor in its popularity. The space-efficient interior was also lauded for the novel 60/40 split rear seat, which was standard on higher-specification models. The original Mk. 1 Metros also featured David Bache&#x27;s signature &quot;symmetric&quot; dashboard design (also used on the Range Rover and the Rover SD1), where the main dashboard moulding consisted of a shelf onto which the instrument binnacle was simply mounted on the left or the right hand side: this arrangement saves the tooling cost of two separate dashboard mouldings for right and left-hand drive models. Initially, the Metro was sold as a three-door hatchback only (as were most of its competitors), with a choice of 998cc (1.0 litre) or 1275cc (1.3-litre) petrol engines. The 1.0 and 1.0L cars, and the van that came out later, had recessed headlamps with indicators and sidelights in the bumper, whereas the 1.0HLE, 1.3S, and 1.3HLS had headlight and indicator as one unit, which was flush-fitting.

The name was chosen by a ballot of BL employees. They were offered a choice of three names, &quot;Match&quot;, &quot;Maestro&quot; or &quot;Metro&quot;. Once the result was announced, the train-and-bus manufacturer Metro Cammell objected to BL&#x27;s use of the Metro name. The issue was resolved by BL promising to advertise the car only as the &quot;Mini Metro&quot;; however, after a while &quot;Mini&quot; was dropped from the name.

From late 1982 there were also van versions, known as the Morris Metro. From late 1985, after BL discontinued use of the Morris name, the van was sold as the Austin Metro 310; after the Austin badge was also dropped from the car models, it became simply the Metrovan 310.
A two-door saloon model was included in the Metro&#x27;s development, which would have been similar in concept to the Vauxhall Chevette saloon and the Polo-based Volkswagen Derby. However, by the time production of the Metro began, it was decided not to include a saloon version, this niche being filled by the Mini remaining in production; also because only a few of the Metro&#x27;s competitors were available as a saloon.

BL&#x27;s last all-new mass-produced car before the Metro&#x27;s launch was the 1976 Rover SD1.

One of the consequences was that there was enormous public interest in the car from well before its launch. The company chose to stage the launch presentations for dealers and major company car buyers on board a cruise ship, the MS Vistafjord. This launch event took place over a three-week period in September 1980 sailing between West Gladstone Dock in Liverpool and the Isle of Man, where guests could drive the car, so long as sea conditions allowed them to land by tender as there was no dock facility for the ship. The news broke in the national newspapers a full year ahead of the public launch with &quot;The Sun&quot;, among others, carrying the story. It was finally revealed to the public on the press day of the British Motor Show with the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, in attendance.

The Metro quickly proved popular with buyers, a 19-year-old Lady Diana Spencer buying one of the early examples, and was regularly seen in it being hounded by the paparazzi just before her marriage to Prince Charles in July 1981. Even then, during the early part of its production life, it was the best selling mini-car in the UK, before being eclipsed by the updated Ford Fiesta in 1984. Its clever interior design made it spacious considering its dimensions, and Hydragas suspension gave surprisingly good ride and handling. Its updated A+ series 1.0 and 1.3-litre OHV engines hardly represented the cutting edge in performance, but they were strong on economy.

In its best year, 1983, more than 130,000 Metros were sold in Britain, only the Ford Escort and Sierra outsold it. This was despite the arrival of a host of new superminis on the British market that year – the Ford Fiesta received a major facelift, and four all-new superminis (the Vauxhall Nova, Fiat Uno, Nissan Micra and Peugeot 205) went on sale in Britain between April and September.
A major TV advertising campaign was created by the London agency, Leo Burnett which came up with the headline &quot;a British car to beat the world&quot;. The advert also featured the similar-sized Fiat 127, Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Datsun Cherry as &quot;foreign invaders&quot; and the voiceover spoke of the Metro&#x27;s ability to &quot;send the foreigners back where they came from&quot;. Following the launch of the Austin Maestro in 1983, less of British Leyland&#x27;s advertising was focused on the Metro. The Maestro initially sold very well, but within five years sales were declining sharply, although it remained in production until 1994.

During 1981, British Leyland confirmed that the Metro range would soon be expanded with more luxurious and high performance versions. The Metro range was expanded in May 1982 to include the luxury Vanden Plas trim level on the Austins and higher performance MG Badged versions; the MG Metro marked a quick comeback for the marque previously used on sports cars until the Abingdon plant making the MG B closed in 1980. The Metro Vanden Plas featured higher levels of luxury and equipment, while the slightly more powerful MG Metro 1.3 sold as a sports model (0–60 mph in 10.9 seconds, top speed 103 mph). The Vanden Plas variant received the same MG engine from 1984 onwards (with the exception of the VP Automatic, which retained the 1275 cc unit). The luxury fittings marking out the Metro Vanden Plas took the form of a radio-cassette player, electric front windows, an improved instrument panel with tachometer, and a variety of optional extras such as trip computer, leather trim, remote boot release, and front fog lamps.

The changes between the MG engine (taken directly from the Mini Cooper) and the standard 1275 included a modified cylinder head, with larger valves and improved porting, altered cam profile and larger carburettor leading to a 20% increase in BHP to 72 bhp. At the October 1982 Birmingham Motor Show the MG Metro Turbo variant was first shown. With a quoted bhp of 93, 0–60 mph in 9.9 seconds, and top speed of this car had few direct competitors at the time, although the growing demand for &quot;hot hatches&quot; meant that it soon had a host of competitors including the Ford Fiesta XR2, Peugeot 205 GTI and Renault 5 GT Turbo. This model had a few addition modifications bolted on over the normally aspirated MG model to give an additional 21 bhp. Aside from the turbocharger and exhaust system itself, and what was (at the time) a relatively sophisticated boost delivery and control system, the MG Turbo variant incorporated stiffer suspension (purportedly with engineering input from Lotus), and an uprated crankshaft of nitrided steel and sodium-cooled exhaust valves.

Both MG variants were given a &quot;sporty&quot; interior with red seat belts, red carpets and a sports-style steering wheel. Early Turbo models also benefitted from a boost pressure gauge: in pre-84 models this was an in-dash LED gauge, relocating to an LCD gauge mounted in an overhead console for early Mk. 2 facelift models (with the boost gauge subsequently being deleted from production in post-85 models). The Turbo also received alloy wheels, wheel arch extensions and front spoiler, and prominent &quot;Turbo&quot; branding. While it retained rear drums, the front disc brakes were changed to ventilated discs, with ventilated front disks being standardised and adopted by all variants from Mk. 2 onwards. Later MG variants were emblazoned with MG branding both inside and out, which only served to fuel claims of badge engineering from some of the more steadfast MG enthusiasts. Others believed that this sentiment was unfounded, particularly in the case of the Turbo variant, due to the undeniably increased performance and handling when compared to the non-MG models. From 1983, the MG badge also found its way onto higher performance versions of the Maestro, and shortly afterwards it was adopted for higher-performance versions of the Montego.

===Mark II===
A Mark II version of the Metro was introduced in 1984. The October facelift saw revised styling modifications to the Metro&#x27;s front end including much needed colour-coding such as body coloured bumpers on MG versions, wider suspension subframes, along with a new dashboard design featuring the switches and instruments matching that of the Maestro and Montego. The new dashboard was constructed from fewer but larger plastic mouldings, making it easier to assemble and reducing the potential for rattles and other fitting issues. A major part of the facelift was the introduction of a five-door Metro: This provided another strong selling point for the Metro in the 1980s, since not only did it already boast a spacious and practical cabin for its size, but some of its slightly larger competitors, such as the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo, did not offer the option of five doors at the time. From 1989, just before the Metro was replaced, three-door versions were given a raised fuel filler, this also coincided with the cars being able to run on unleaded petrol due to hardened exhaust valve seats, three years before EEC regulations made it compulsory for all new cars to have a catalytic converter or fuel injection.
A rear spoiler reduced drag coefficient to increase the Metro&#x27;s already good fuel economy, and the hydraulic clutch (often berated as the cause of the Metro&#x27;s particularly harsh gearchange) was replaced by a self-adjusting cable-operated mechanism. The lack of a five-speed gearbox would become a major drawback as time went on; the BMC sump-mounted gearbox was never developed to accommodate an extra gear ratio, which was a severe handicap against the opposition – by the mid-1980s the Ford Fiesta, Peugeot 205, Fiat Uno and Opel Corsa/Vauxhall Nova were all available with a five-speed gearbox on larger-engine models.

The Austin Metro was a huge seller in Britain, with more than 1 million being sold over a 10-year production run. The Mk. 3 Ford Escort (1980–1986) was the only model to outsell it in Britain throughout the 1980s, and by December 1989 only the Mk. 3 Ford Escort was a more common model on British roads. However, the first three generations of Ford Fiesta combined outnumbered it by this stage. It remained on sale in automatic-only form alongside the revised Rover Metro in order to cater for this market need until an automatic transmission version of the newer car was available. Some Mk2 Metros therefore have known to be registered on a J-prefix registration plate (indicating an August 1991 registration date).

October 2010 marked the 30th anniversary of the launch of the Metro, by now a very rare sight on Britain&#x27;s roads.

==Rover Metro==
At the end of 1987, the Austin marque was shelved. The Austin badge was removed from the cars, which continued to be manufactured with no marque badge, just a model name badge. Rover management never allowed Rover badges on the Montego or the Maestro in their home market, although they were sometimes referred to as &quot;Rovers&quot; in the press and elsewhere. They wore badges that were the same shape as the Rover longship badge, but which did not say &quot;Rover&quot;. By this stage, Rover was in the final stages of developing the new Rover 200 Series and Rover 400 Series models in conjunction with Honda, and it was also working on a replacement for the Metro.

During the 1980s, the media had published photographs of the &quot;Austin AR6&quot; concept car, which would have been a completely new design, but towards the end of the decade Rover decided to restyle and re-engineer the existing Metro design instead.

The new Rover Metro was finally launched in May 1990, being a heavily revised version of the original Metro and fitted with a new range of engines.

The proven 998 cc and 1275 cc A-Series engines (the 1275cc unit was heavily modified and saw service in the classic Mini right up to the end of Mini production in October 2000) gave way to the all-new K-series engine. These were available in 1.1 litre (1118 cc ) and 1.4 litre (1396 cc ) 8-valve versions, while a 16-valve engine was available in the GTi (early variants are SPi while the later MPi version has 103 bhp) and the early GTa. All models used end-on gearboxes designed jointly by Rover and Peugeot. In 1992, a 1.4 PSA TUD diesel from the Citroën AX and Peugeot 106 was launched; this was the first time the Metro had been available with a diesel engine. At the same time an automatic version was launched with a CVT-type gearbox. 
The Hydragas suspension was finally modified to accept front to rear interconnection in the way that Alex Moulton had intended, to improve handling and ride quality.

A new bodyshell for the replacement car (the AR6 project) was designed. Its styling was influenced by Ital Design, with some similarity to the acclaimed Giorgetto Giugiaro-designed Fiat Punto launched in 1994, and the lower panels of the Peugeot 205, and incorporating the blacked-out pillars and &#x27;floating roof&#x27; of the 1989 R8 Rover 200. However, this was cancelled by chairman Graham Day, because British Aerospace (then the Rover Group&#x27;s new owners) refused to fund it, and the disappointing sales of the Maestro and Montego had not produced expected profits to reinvest. A mockup could be seen at the Canley, Coventry design centre in the 1990s during open days. It appeared as a &#x27;Scoop&#x27; photo on the front cover of CAR magazine in the mid-1980s. Project R6, as it became known, would be a more modest update of the 1980 car – the basic bodyshell was retained, but was improved with the addition of new plastic front and rear bumpers, new front wings, new rear lights and bootlid, new front headlamps and bonnet. The interior was altered with a new rounded instrument binnacle and instruments (although the 1984 dashboard moulding remained), new steering wheel, new seats (from the successful Rover 200 series), new door casings and other detail improvements. General build quality, fit and finish was improved enormously from the old Metro and went on to win &quot;What Car?&quot; &quot;Car of The Year&quot; in 1991.

In many export markets, including Italy and France, the Rover Metro was badged as the Rover 100 series, with the 1.1 known as the Rover 111 and the 1.4 called 114.

Latterly this car has attracted an enthusiastic following including use as a low-cost entry to motor racing. The basic just-over- engine for the GTI can be boosted to over at the flywheel. For ultimate performance the 1.8 K-series engine, with standard cams or VVC (Variable Valve Control) system can be fitted (these engines are found in the MGF and Lotus Elise sports cars, as well as various Rovers and MGs).

==Rover 100==
In December 1994, the revised R6 model appeared. In the United Kingdom, Rover finally scrapped the Metro nameplate, replacing it with a new name, Rover 100, which had been adopted on continental Europe on the Rover Metro&#x27;s launch in 1990, due to the weakness of the Austin marque in Europe.

The mechanics of the car remained much the same with 1.1 and 1.4 petrol engines and Hydragas suspension, but there was now the option of a Peugeot-sourced 1.5 diesel rather than the previous 1.4. The exterior was altered in an attempt to disguise the car&#x27;s age, meet the increased cooling requirements of the Peugeot motor and offer a reduced-format Rover family grille. This was achieved through fitment of new front and rear bumpers, sill covers, rear boot handle and headlamps, bonnet and grille.
A variety of bolder paint colours and the use of chrome trim helped give a more upmarket appearance. The interior trim was revised to give a greater impression of quality and luxury, but since the basic architecture had remained unchanged since the original 1980 car, it was considered by many as being short on space and outdated in comparison to its most modern rivals (most of which had been replaced with all-new models since the launch of the Rover Metro, and in the cases of the Ford Fiesta and Vauxhall Nova/Corsa, replaced with all-new models twice). It was criticised by the press for its lack of equipment, with front electric windows only available on the range-topping 114 GSi. Rear electric windows were never an option on the 100. Neither were Anti-Lock Brakes, Power Steering or a rev-counter (except the GTa and later manual 114 GSi models) One for the 100 was a full leather trim, a rarity in a small car and coupled with the standard wood veneer dashboard inserts, a tinted glass sunroof and the optional wood veneer door cappings, the 114 GSi made for traditional luxury motoring; an image Rover was trying to retain. The only safety efforts came in the form of an optional drivers airbag, an alarm, a passive engine immobiliser, a removable radio keypad, central locking and side intrusion beams.


;Rover 114 GTa 
A version of the 100 called the 114 GTa was available from launch. The main differences over the 114 SLi three-door – which has the same engine – were sports seats, red seatbelts, a rev-counter, sports suspension, a slightly higher top speed, faster acceleration, GSi alloy wheels and GTa badging. It was only available as a three-door.

;End of the line
In 1997, the Rover 100 gave a poor performance in Euro NCAP crash tests (despite the improved safety features, including side impact bars in the doors and an optional driver&#x27;s airbag, the 1970s design was showing its age) – it was at the time the only car tested to receive a one-star Adult Occupant Rating. Other small cars tested at the same time received two or three stars out of five. The passenger compartment was subjected to severe structural damage in the frontal-offset test and results showed a high risk of injury to all body regions for the driver. Meanwhile, the side impact test also showed high injury risks.

The Rover 100&#x27;s dismal safety showing was not its only problem by 1997. It was fast falling behind the best cars in its sector when it came to design, build quality, refinement and specification, although it remained strong in terms of fuel economy and affordability. Unlike the Ford Fiesta, Volkswagen Polo and Vauxhall Corsa, the Rover 100 could still provide sub-£7,000 motoring.

Facing a complete collapse of sales, Rover withdrew the 100 from production – marking the end of nearly 18 years of production with the last car built on 23 December 1997.

There was no direct replacement for the Metro/100, although the 1995 Rover 200 had been developed inside Rover Cars to serve as a replacement for the 100 as well as the previous 200 model, which was slightly larger. The 100 and 200 were sold concurrently until 1998, when the 100 was withdrawn. When the Rover 200 was facelifted in late 1999 and rebadged as the Rover 25, Rover marketed this as a supermini reflecting the continued, steady growth of all car classes. The plan was for both the 100 and the 25 to be on the market until the launch of the true replacement for the Metro in the shape of the Mini Hatch.

The gap left by the Metro as a city car was not filled until late 2003, when the Rover CityRover was launched – it was a 1.4 engined city car built in India alongside the Tata Indica. This model was nowhere near as popular as the Metro or the Rover 100. The 100 was not included in the revived product range by Nanjing Automobile following MG Rover&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2005.

==MG Metro 6R4 rally car== 
Created for the short-lived Group B rally category, the 4WD mid engined MG Metro 6R4 of 1984 (standing for 6-cylinder, Rally, 4-wheel-drive) was a world away from the best selling city car to which it only bears a superficial cosmetic resemblance. The competition car effectively only shared the name of the production Metro as it featured a mid-mounted engine with four-wheel drive transmission enclosed within a semi-monocoque seam-welded tubular chassis. The development of this vehicle had been entrusted to Williams Grand Prix Engineering.

The resulting car was shown to the world in May 1985. It was powered by a David Wood designed bespoke 3-litre V6 powerplant which used some of the engine architecture of the Cosworth DFV. It featured twin overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. The engine was not turbocharged as the majority of its competitors were, which considered the Metro as &quot;unique.&quot; The engine was mounted back to front in the car, with the forward end of the engine facing the hatchback and the gearbox attached conventionally behind it and, therefore, in the middle of the vehicle. The four-wheel-drive was permanently engaged, and drove separate prop shafts to the front and rear differentials. The rear differential was mounted on the side of the engine sump with one driveshaft running through the sump to the nearside rear wheel. Much of the outer bodywork was made of GRP, with the only exception being the roof panels (which were aluminium), the steel doors, and the remaining panels from the original Metro shell. The doors were, however, concealed by plastic airboxes. Indeed, models now on show generally have stickers demonstrating where it is safe to push from when moving the vehicle, so as not to damage the bodywork.

The 6R4 appeared in two guises. There was a so-called &quot;Clubman&quot; model which was the road going version which developed in the region of , of which around 200 were made and sold to the public for £40,000 (the homologation version). A further 20 were taken and built to International specifications which had a recorded output of over 

At its launch in 1985, Rover announced that it would complete the necessary number of cars required for homologation by November of that year. This was undertaken at the group&#x27;s large manufacturing facility at Longbridge. The car was to participate in the Lombard RAC rally in November 1985, and an example, driven by &quot;works&quot; driver Tony Pond, finished a highly respectable third, behind two Lancia Delta S4s.

This good start was unfortunately not repeated, and although a 6R4 was entered in rallies at Monte Carlo, Sweden, Portugal and Corsica during the 1986 season, none of the Metros managed to complete a course. The majority of these problems were related to the V6 powerplant which suffered teething issues. Halfway during the 1986 season, Group B was banned (following a series of fatal crashes in which both competitors and spectators lost their lives). From that point on, the 6R4 was always going to be limited in front line competition, although they were run with limited success for the remainder of the year. A number passed into private hands and have proved formidable rally and rallycross cars. Despite the expiry of the 6R4&#x27;s homologation the MSA still allow the cars to run in competition although engine sizes have been limited to 2800cc (single plenum engines) and 2500cc (multi-plenum engines).

Austin Rover withdrew from the rallying scene at the end of the season, but in 1987 all the parts and engines were sold to Tom Walkinshaw Racing, whereupon the V6 engine reappeared in the Jaguar XJ220, this time with turbochargers added.

== Popularity ==
The Metro remained one of Britain&#x27;s most popular cars throughout its production life, even during its final year when it was among the oldest designs on sale in the country. During its early years, the Austin Metro was Britain&#x27;s most popular small car; often outselling the Ford Fiesta. It was still one of Britain&#x27;s best selling cars by the time it was replaced by the Rover 100 in late 1994, with almost 1,500,000 having been sold (an average of more than 100,000 per year). However, despite reasonable numbers being sold in France and Italy, overall sales in Europe were modest in comparison to established rivals such as the Fiesta (which typically sold 500,000 units per year across Europe), meaning that BL still could not realise the true economies of scale.

Much debate among automotive historians has taken place over whether BL&#x27;s decision to push the Metro&#x27;s development programme ahead of the potentially more profitable Maestro/Montego models was justified. As a result of this, both those models did not arrive on the market until 1983/84, after having been in development since 1976 with a view of being launched around 1980. By the time of their launch, they were soon out of step both stylistically and from an engineering perspective when compared to the market-leading cars in their sectors.

The Metro&#x27;s popularity endured in spite of its failure to match the durability of its contemporary rivals, notably the Nissan Micra (K10) and VW Polo Mk. 2. This is well illustrated by the findings of &quot;Auto Express&quot;&#x27;s 2006 survey which named the Metro as Britain&#x27;s seventh-most scrapped car of the last thirty years. Just 21,468 versions of the original 1980–1990 Metro were still in working order at the time of the survey, despite around 1,000,000 being sold. Nearly seven years on, that figure has inevitably declined further, with the number remaining as of 2013 now down to less than 2,000.

Many Metros (particularly the pre-1990 Austin models) have been scrapped as a result of the bodyshell&#x27;s vulnerability to rust. Pre-1989 cars could not run on unleaded fuel either without expensive conversion of the cylinder head or the use of additives. When lead replacement petrol was withdrawn from sale in 1997 many owners simply scrapped the cars. Metros built before 1990 use the same engine and transmission package as the Mini, hence they have become popular donor cars for Mini restorations and Mini-based kit cars; and as a result, thousands of Metros were dismantled purely for their engines and gearboxes to keep classic Minis on the road. Many Metros were written off by joyriders, as the car&#x27;s minimal security made it notoriously easy to steal. The post-1990 cars were not without their problems - the K-Series engine became notoriously prone to cylinder head gasket failure (and if the engines overheated then they were often damaged beyond repair), and the bodyshell remained vulnerable to corrosion, meaning relatively few have survived. 

Official factory support for the Metro is now non-existent due to the demise of MG Rover which has ended the supply of crucial and unique parts. However, an entire industry has built up to continue support of the A-Series engine given its ubiquity in the classic Mini and other post-war British cars whilst a cottage industry exists in maintaining and providing parts for the Hydragas suspension system.

Including the post-1994 Rover 100 Series models, a total of just under 1,500,000 Metros were sold in the UK in less than twenty years, making it the seventh-most popular car ever sold there.

Lady Diana Spencer (later Diana, Princess of Wales) owned a red W-registered Metro before her engagement to the then-Prince Charles. This car is in the Museum of British Road Transport, Coventry.

<text>Cathcart (; , ) is an area of Glasgow between Battlefield, Mount Florida, King&#x27;s Park, Muirend and Newlands. The White Cart Water flows through Cathcart, downstream from Linn Park. In 2014, it was rated one of the most attractive postcode areas to live in Scotland.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Cathcart&quot; derives from the River Cart. The first part of the name varies in different early sources. The earliest attestation appears in 1158, as &quot;Kerkert&quot;; here the first element is the Common Brittonic or Pictish word surviving today in modern Welsh as (&quot;fortification&quot;). Thereafter, however, most or all attestations begin with the word that survives in modern Welsh as (&quot;woodland&quot;). These include &quot;Katkert&quot; (c. 1170), &quot;Catkert&quot; (between 1177 and 1185), and an attestation in the epithet of one Gilbert of &quot;Kathkerd&quot; from between 1203 and 1210. Thus, in its different forms, the name once meant &quot;fortress on the River Cart&quot; and &quot;woodland on the River Cart&quot;.

==History==
The ancient parish was formed around Cathcart Castle, the hereditary seat of the Cathcart family. The castle was built in the 15th-century on a site overlooking the White Cart Water, now part of Linn Park. The remains of the castle were demolished in 1980, having been declared unsafe, leaving only the foundations.

Originally part of the Parish of Govan in Renfrewshire, most of the ancient parish was annexed by the county of city of Glasgow in 1912. Cathcart is mainly a residential area, containing a mix of tenements, terraces and villas built from red or blonde sandstone. There are some historic buildings, including the Couper Institute (a public hall and library) and the Snuff Mill. One of Alexander Thomson&#x27;s most significant buildings, Holmwood House, is situated in Cathcart, close to the Glasgow city boundary.

Local industry includes ClydeUnion Pumps (previously part of Weir Group), and Scottish Power.

Cathcart is served by Cathcart railway station on the Cathcart Circle Line, as well as numerous bus routes.

Linn Park, the second largest park in the city, is within the surrounding area. The semi natural woodland, declared a local nature reserve in 2012, has a large path network and river walk.

== Churches ==

Cathcart contains several churches including Cathcart Baptist church, Cathcart United Free church, Cathcart Congregational church and two Church of Scotland churches; Cathcart Old and Cathcart Trinity. The present Cathcart Old building was opened in 1929 and sits across Carmunnock Road from the earlier churchyard which contains the tower from the previous church and a graveyard. Cathcart Trinity was formed in November 2002 from the union of the vacant charges of Cathcart South and New Cathcart. The former New Cathcart Church building was converted into housing in 2006. Cathcart&#x27;s Catholic residents are served by St Gabriel&#x27;s Church in Merrylee and by Christ the King in King&#x27;s Park. Three congregations of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses share a Kingdom Hall in Cathcart.

<text>Akzo Nobel N.V., stylised as AkzoNobel, is a Dutch multinational company which creates paints and performance coatings for both industry and consumers worldwide. Headquartered in Amsterdam, the company has activities in more than 150 countries. AkzoNobel is the world&#x27;s third-largest paint manufacturer by revenue after Sherwin-Williams and PPG Industries. 

==History==
AkzoNobel has a long history of mergers and divestments. Parts of the current company can be traced back to 17th-century companies.

===History and formation of Akzo===
Akzo was formed in 1969 as merger of Algemene Kunstzijde Unie (General Artificial Silk Union; AKU) and Koninklijke Zout Organon (Royal Salt Organon; KZO).

The AKU was formed in 1929 when the Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken (est. 1899) and Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek (ENKA, est. 1911) merged, forming Algemene Kunstzijde Unie (AKU). The latter faced, amongst others, technical problems in the manufacturing of synthetic fibers. Its founder, Jacques Coenraad Hartogs, turned to Dutch industrialist Rento Hofstede Crull for a solution for which Hofstede Crull provided the answer. They created a joint venture, the &quot;NV I.S.E.M.&quot;, whose successes and profits laid the foundation for the ENKA&#x27;s subsequent acquisitions and mergers and which was eventually absorbed by the AKU in 1938.

The other part of the merger, the KZO, was formed when Koninklijke Zout Ketjen merged with Koninklijke Zwanenberg Organon in 1967. The former was itself a merger of Koninklijke Nederlandse Zoutindustrie (KNZ) and Ketjen. The KNZ was formed in 1918 by Ko Vis as a salt producing company; a business that to this day plays an important role in AkzoNobel&#x27;s activities. The other part, Koninklijke Zwanenberg Organon, was formed when Zwanenberg&#x27;s Fabrieken (est. 1887), a meat export factory based in Oss merged with Organon, a pharmaceuticals company founded by Saal van Zwanenberg, also in Oss.

After the merger of AKU and KZO, Akzo made a number of other critical acquisitions; Armour and Company in 1970, Levis Paints in 1985, specialty chemicals division of Stauffer in 1987 and divested its polyamides and polyesters plastics engineering business to DSM in 1992. In 1993, Akzo formed a joint venture with Harrisons Chemicals (UK) Ltd a subsidiary of Harrisons &amp; Crosfield.
===AkzoNobel formation===
In 1994 Akzo and Nobel Industries agreed to merge, forming Akzo Nobel, with the new combined entity having 20 business entities a number of divestments were made: Nobel Chemicals, Nobel Biotech and Spectra-Physics. In 1995 the PET resins business was sold to Wellman, Inc.. In 1996 the group sold the crop protection business to Nufarm. In 1998 the company acquired industrial coatings and in synthetic fiber company Courtaulds, later divesting Courtaulds industrial coatings and Daejen Fine Chemicals. Courtaulds was merged with Akzo Nobel Fibres forming Acordis, which in December 1999 was divested to CVC Capital Partners. In 1999 the company acquired the pharmaceutical business of Kanebo.

In the early 2000s the company began another wave of divestitures, first in 2000 with its stake in Rovin&#x27;s VCM and PVC business to Shin-Etsu Chemical. In 2001 divests ADC optical monomers business to Great Lakes Chemical, in 2002 its printing inks business, in 2004 its catalyst business to Albemarle Corp., in 2005 its Ink &amp; Adhesive Resins to Hexion and UV/EB Resins to Cray Valley, in 2007 its Akcros Chemicals to GIL Investments. In 2006 the group acquired Canadian decorative and industrial coatings company, SICO Inc. and a year later Canadian industrial coatings company, Chemcraft International, Inc.

In 2007 Organon International was sold to Schering-Plough for €11 billion and AkzoNobel delisted its shares from the US NASDAQ stock market. In 2008 Crown Paints was sold in a management buyout.

In December 2012, AkzoNobel agrees to sell its North American Architectural Coatings business to PPG Industries for $1.1 billion.

===Acquisition of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI)===
In 2008 AkzoNobel acquired British Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) for $15.8 billion.

ICI can trace its history back to four British-based chemical companies; British Dyestuffs Corporation, Brunner, Mond &amp; Company, Nobel Explosives and the United Alkali Company. which merged in 1926, forming ICI. A year later, the newly merged entity employed over 33,000 employees in five main product areas: alkali products, explosives, metals, general chemicals, and dyestuffs. In 1933 the company developed polyethylene, which is later patented and sold as an insulating material. In 1986 focusses to paint and specialty products with the purchase of Beatrice&#x27;s Chemicals Division and Glidden Paint.

In 1993 ICI demerged its bioscience business, splitting into two the publicly listed companies: ICI and Zeneca. The latter would later go onto merge with Astra AB, forming the current pharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca.

In April 2008 Henkel acquired from AkzoNobel the adhesive part of National Starch and in June 2010, AkzoNobel divested the starch part of National Starch business to Corn Products International.

===Attempted acquisition by PPG Industries===

In March 2017, PPG Industries launched an unsolicited takeover bid of €20.9 billion, which was promptly rejected by AkzoNobel&#x27;s management. Days later, PPG again launched an increased bid of €24.5 billion, which was again rejected by AkzoNobel&#x27;s management. A number of shareholders urged the company to explore the offer and subsequent negotiations. In April, activist investor, Elliot Investors&#x27; called for the removal of Chairman Antony Burgmans following Akzo&#x27;s refusal to submit to discussing with PPG. Elliott, which has a 3.25% stake in the company, claimed it was one of a group of investors that met the Dutch legal threshold of 10% voting-share support, which is needed to call an extraordinary meeting to vote on a proposal to remove Burgmans. On 13 April, Templeton Global Equity said it was among another group of investors calling for an extraordinary meeting of AkzoNobel shareholders to discuss Burgmans continued tenure as Chairman. Later, in the same month Akzo outlined its plan to separate its chemicals division and pay shareholders €1.6 billion in extra dividends, in order to attempt to hold-off PPG. The new Akzo strategy was dismissed by PPG, which claimed that their offer represented better value for shareholders, supported by activist Akzo shareholder, Elliot Advisors. On 24 April, a day before Akzo&#x27;s annual meeting of shareholders, PPG increased its final offer by approximately 8% to $28.8 billion (€26.9 billion, €96.75 per share)—with Akzo&#x27;s share pricing rising 6% to a record price of €82.95 per share. Akzo shareholder, Columbia Threadneedle Investments, urged the company to open dialogue with PPG, whilst PPG claimed that the deal would add to earning within its first year. Days later one of the UK&#x27;s largest pension scheme investors, Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), urged Akzo to engage with PPG. On 2 May, Reuters revealed that the supervisory board of Akzo was meeting to discuss how to deal with PPGs third offer, still maintaining it did not value the company highly enough.

In early May, Akzo again rejected PPGs bid, citing the deal still undervalued the company, as well as potentially facing antitrust risks, and not addressing other concerns such as &quot;cultural differences&quot;. Under Dutch company law, PPG had to then decide to either make a formal bid or walkaway. In early June, PPG chose to walk away from the potential deal. As part of Akzo&#x27;s defense to shareholders, many of whom pushed for the deal, chief executive Ton Büchner agreed to split Akzo in two and achieve increased financial targets. Büchner stepped down as CEO in July 2017, citing health reasons. He was succeeded by Thierry Vanlancker, former chief of the company&#x27;s chemicals division.

===Recent===
The company AkzoNobel is focused on paints and coatings. On October 9, 2018 Specialty Chemicals was re-branded as a new company, Nouryon, after acquisition by the Carlyle Group.

International Paint Limited, owned by AkzoNobel were fined £650,000 and ordered to pay costs of £144,992 in a prosecution brought by the Environment Agency for allowing the banned highly toxic chemical tributyltin to be released into the river Yealm estuary at Newton Ferrers.

==Organization==
Due to high revenues from the sales of its pharmaceutical business, AkzoNobel was the world&#x27;s most profitable company in 2008.

<text>Bernhard Siegfried Albinus (originally Weiss; 24 February 16979 September 1770) was a German-born Dutch anatomist. He served a professor of medicine at the University of Leiden like his father Bernhard Albinus (1653–1721). He also published a large-format artistic atlas of human anatomy, with engravings made by Jan Wandelaar.

==Biography==

Bernhard Siegfried Albinus was born at Frankfurt on the Oder where his father, Bernhard Albinus (1653–1721), was professor of the practice of medicine. In 1702 the latter was transferred to the chair of medicine at Leiden University, and it was there that Bernhard Siegfried began his studies in 1709, at the age of 12, having for his teachers such men as Boerhaave and Govert Bidloo. Having finished his studies at Leiden, he went to Paris in 1718, where, under the instruction of Sébastien Vaillant (1669–1722), Jacob Winslow (1669–1760) and Frederik Ruysch, he devoted himself especially to anatomy and botany. After a year&#x27;s absence he was, on the recommendation of Boerhaave, recalled in 1719 to Leiden to be a lecturer on anatomy and surgery. Two years later, after Johannes Jacobus Rau (1668 - 1719) the former rector of the medical school died on 29 June 1719, Albinus received his position in 1721, and succeeded his father in the professorship of these subjects, and became a teacher of anatomy, his classroom being resorted to not only by students but by many practising physicians. In 1745 Albinus was appointed professor of the practice of medicine, being succeeded in the anatomical chair by his brother Frederick Bernhard (1715–1778), who, as well as another brother, Christian Bernhard (1700–1752), attained distinction. Bernhard Siegfried, who was twice rector of his university, died at Leiden.

Together with Hermann Boerhaave, he edited the works of the physicians Andreas Vesalius and William Harvey. Albinus is known for his &quot;Tabulae sceleti et musculorum corporis humani&quot;, an exquisitely illustrated volume, which was first published in Leiden in 1747, largely at his own expense. Albinus is thought to have spent 24000 florins for the work. The artist and engraver with whom Albinus did nearly all of his work was Jan Wandelaar (1690–1759). A From 1746 until his death, Wandelaar lived in Albinus&#x27;s house. In an attempt to increase the scientific accuracy of anatomical illustration, Albinus and Wandelaar devised a new technique of placing nets with square webbing at specified intervals between the artist and the anatomical specimen and copying the images using the grid patterns. Albinus believed in the idea of &quot;homo perfectus&quot;, an idealized perfect human model based on which all humans were derived as variants. In order to represent this perfect human, the illustrations were drawn from multiple specimens. Earlier anatomical drawings such as those accompanying Vesalius&#x27; work were drawn from single specimens. Albinus preferred athletic slender forms. &quot;Tabulae&quot; was criticized by such scholars as Petrus Camper, especially for the whimsical backgrounds added to many of the pieces by Wandelaar, but Albinus staunchly defended Wandelaar. Wandelaar made the first of the plates in 1742, well before the publication of the &quot;Tabulae,&quot; and this included the skeleton superposed in front of a rhinoceros. This was the famous rhinoceros Clara which at that time lived in Leiden and was extremely popular.

<text>WBEN (930 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Buffalo, New York, featuring a news/talk format. Owned by Audacy, Inc., the station serves Western New York, the Niagara Falls region, and parts of Southern Ontario. WBEN&#x27;s studios are located in Amherst, while the transmitter site is in Grand Island. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WBEN is relayed over WKSE&#x27;s HD3 digital subchannel, and is available online via Audacy.

WBEN is an affiliate of ABC News Radio, and WKBW-TV provides weather forecasts. The station airs overflow sports programming from WGR, including the &#x27;NFL on Westwood One&quot; and Buffalo Sabres hockey games that are played on the same day as Buffalo Bills football contests. WBEN features local talk hosts during the day; nighttime syndicated programming includes &quot;Armstrong &amp; Getty&quot;, &quot;Our American Stories&quot; with Lee Habeeb, and &quot;Coast to Coast AM with George Noory&quot;.

==History==
===1920s===
WBEN has traditionally traced its history to September 8, 1930, the date when it made its first broadcast using the WBEN call sign. However, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) records list the station&#x27;s first license date as September 22, 1922, tracing WBEN&#x27;s origin to an earlier license, with the sequentially assigned call letters of WMAK, that was issued to Norton Laboratories in Lockport, New York. The station initially used the facility built by the Norton Laboratories organization from Boston as part of an experiment to send amplitude modulated (AM) voice transmissions between Niagara Falls, New York, and Cambridge, Massachusetts.

WMAK was a charter member of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio network, being one of the 16 stations that aired the first CBS network program on September 18, 1927. In 1928, WMAK joined with General Electric&#x27;s WGY in Schenectady to demonstrate television technology. A mechanical scan system with only 30 lines of vertical resolution, it was crude compared to later electronic standards such as the 525-line NTSC analog system and subsequent 1080-line high definition digital television. But the effort was historic because GE&#x27;s experimental facility was the first American television station with a regular broadcast schedule, as well as the forerunner of the current Capital District CBS-TV affiliate WRGB. The comedy duo of Stoopnagle and Budd began their careers at WMAK in 1930.

When WMAK was launched in 1922, it initially operated on the standard &quot;entertainment&quot; wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz). In mid-1924 the station was reassigned to 1100 kHz and at the end of the year was shifted again, to 1130 kHz. In late 1927 the transmitter site was changed to Tonawanda, followed a few months later to Shawnee Road in Martinsville. In mid-1927 the station moved to 550 kHz.

Effective November 11, 1928, WMAK was reassigned to 900 kHz, with 750 watts of power, now with a timeshare partner, WFBL in Syracuse, as a result of the Federal Radio Commission&#x27;s (FRC) General Order 40, which implemented a major realignment of American AM radio. (At this time, WMAK&#x27;s previous frequency of 550 kHz was assigned to WGR). WMAK was unhappy with this new assignment because the reduced hours limited its ability to carry CBS network programming. WFBL was also unhappy, even though it was also issued an unusual second authorization for unlimited use of 1490 kHz to test &quot;synchronized&quot; transmissions. In practice, WFBL preferred the 900 kHz assignment and only broadcast on 1490 kHz during times when, under the timesharing agreement, 900 kHz was in use by WMAK.

Eventually, a five-way legal battle broke out over control of the 900 kHz assignment. WMAK and WFBL filed applications for full-time use of the frequency, while two other existing stations, WEBR in Buffalo and WBNY in New York City, applied for half-time assignments. A fifth application, made with support from local businesses, came from the &quot;Buffalo Evening News&quot; newspaper, which filed a request to build a new full-time station. Although it had never operated a radio station, the &quot;News&quot; had extensive experience supplying a news service to local stations, beginning in November 1920 when it provided election returns for broadcast over an amateur station operated by Charles C. Klinck, Jr. The &quot;News&quot; also had a contract to supply news for use by the Buffalo Broadcasting Company stations, however, a dispute led to the station group canceling the contract in September 1929.

The five competing station applications were evaluated at a Federal Radio Commission hearing on December 18, 1929. The FRC issued its ruling two days later, denying the WMAK, WFBL, WEBR, and WBNY applications while ordering WFBL to transmit exclusively on 1490 kHz. It also granted the &quot;Buffalo Evening News&quot; request to build a new 1,000-watt station on 900 kHz with unlimited hours. In early 1929 WMAK had been acquired by the Buffalo Broadcasting Company, based at Buffalo&#x27;s Rand Building, which also controlled WGR and WKBW in Buffalo and WKEN in nearby Kenmore. The FRC saw this as pertinent to its decision, stating &quot;There existed in Buffalo, New York, a virtual monopoly of broadcasting facilities controlled by the Buffalo Broadcasting Corporation by reason of which Buffalo and the surrounding community were given radio broadcasting service... of an unstable and unsatisfactory nature&quot;, therefore &quot;the greatest benefit to the greatest number would result from granting the application of the Buffalo Evening News&quot;. A Construction Permit to build the new station on 900 kHz, with a sequentially assigned provisional call sign of WRDA, was issued on January 23, 1930, specifying a transmitter site in Orchard Park and studios in Buffalo.

===1930s===
Both WMAK and WFBL appealed this ruling. WFBL complained that 1490 kHz was an &quot;undesirable&quot; assignment, and the FRC eventually agreed for the station to use 1360 kHz instead. Following plaintiff arguments, but prior to the appeals court making a ruling, the &quot;Buffalo Evening News&quot; and the Buffalo Broadcasting Company devised a settlement, and agreed that instead of building a completely new station, the newspaper would purchase WMAK and upgrade its existing transmitter site. The assignment of WMAK&#x27;s license to the &quot;Buffalo Evening News&quot; was made on June 25, 1930, and WMAK&#x27;s call letters were changed to WBEN. The original construction permit for a (never built) new station was modified to specify that it was now an upgrade to the existing Martinsville transmitter site. At the same time, WMAK&#x27;s call sign and intellectual property were transferred to the former WKEN in Kenmore, where it would operate until its deletion in 1932. Following the repeal of the Davis Amendment, in 1948 WMAK&#x27;s vacated frequency assignment was licensed to a new station in Kenmore, now WUFO in Amherst.

WBEN remained off the air while the upgrades were being made, until it made its debut broadcast on September 8. A new studio complex was built at the Statler-Hilton Hotel in downtown Buffalo, chosen primarily for access to the live orchestra there, which served WBEN, its sister FM station, and a television station opened in the spring of 1948, for more than 25 years.

In 1934, WBEN continued the station&#x27;s tradition of innovation, launching the ultra-shortwave experimental station W8XH on the Apex radio band, as the first station of its kind to broadcast a regular schedule. In December 1938, WBEN began an experimental facsimile service, transmitting overnight newspaper extracts printed with special receivers in subscribing homes. In April 1939, the facsimile service was transferred to an &quot;experimental facsimile broadcasting station&quot;, W8XA, which employed much of the equipment originally used by W8XH. The facsimile service was ended in December 1940.

===1940s===

In 1941, WBEN moved to its current frequency of 930 kHz as a result of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) reassignments. The station also relocated its transmitter to Grand Island at this time, increasing full-time power to its current 5,000 watts. The Grand Island transmitter and two towers are still in use today.

Buffalo, in general, and WBEN in particular, was an incubator of national radio and television talent. In the early 1940s, WBEN&#x27;s morning host was comedian and future national late-night television star Jack Paar (he left the station when drafted into the military in 1943 during World War II and opted not to return to Buffalo after the war). Paar&#x27;s place was taken by Clint Buehlman, who was recruited from competing station WGR. Buehlman remained for 34 years until retiring in 1977.

WBEN was also the station where longtime national commercial spokesman Ed Reimers launched his career, In 1946, WBEN was one of the first radio stations in the United States to launch an FM radio station, which originally was located at 106.5 MHz on the dial. In May 1948, it launched what would become WIVB, the first television station in Buffalo and the second in Upstate New York, following WRGB in Schenectady/Albany. The original WBEN-FM would later move to 102.5, increase its signal strength to 110 kilowatts to become the most powerful FM station in New York State, and eventually become WBKV.

As many national network radio programs moved to television, WBEN shifted to a middle-of-the-road format and developed a stable talent to lead the market in ratings. The station&#x27;s affiliation with CBS brought Arthur Godfrey, &quot;The World Tonight&quot; and other network programming, but the station was primarily live and local.

In addition to morning host Clint Buehlman, other on-air voices included Al Fox, John Corbett, Ken Phillips, Bill Masters, and John Luther. Sports personalities Van Miller, Stan Barron and Dick Rifenburg shared various duties, including hosting and interview programs, while familiar news voices Jack Ogilvie, Gene Kelley, Lou Douglas, Virgil Booth, and others were heard during this period. Most of these personnel also handled TV duties, anchoring, announcing the news, weather, and sports, and hosting game shows and other programming at WBEN-TV.

===1970s-1980s===
When the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) disallowed same market co-ownership of newspapers and broadcast licenses in the early 1970s, the combination of the Buffalo Evening News and WBEN-AM/FM/TV was grandfathered under the new rule. However, the 1974 death of Katherine Butler (longtime owner and publisher of the Evening News) led to the placement of the Evening News&#x27;s properties in a blind trust (since Katherine Butler left no heirs). This trust company then sold the newspaper. This sale ended the Butler family&#x27;s ownership of the Evening News. With the loss of the WBEN stations&#x27; grandfathered protection, WBEN-TV was sold to newspaper publisher Robert Howard. WBEN-TV&#x27;s new owner changed channel 4&#x27;s callsign to WIVB, which stands for &quot;We&#x27;re IV (4) Buffalo&quot;.

By the time of this transition period, WBEN radio&#x27;s demographics had grown older with its folksy personalities and middle-of-the-road music. With the Butler family no longer owning the newspaper or broadcast properties, WBEN attempted to contemporize the sound during the mid-late 1970s by firing some of its longtime on-air institutions, hiring DJs, and playing Top-40 music. The station went from being known as &quot;WBEN Radio 9-3-0&quot; to &quot;93/WBEN&quot;. DJs Jay Fredericks (Fritz Coleman), Chris Tyler, and Charlie Warren joined the station from other markets. Within months the ratings dropped as longtime listeners were angered, yet Top-40 listeners were already entrenched at WKBW and WYSL. Jefferson Kaye, however, had remained successful as the afternoon personality during this period (he succeeded the retiring Clint Buehlman as a morning show host in 1977; Buehlman&#x27;s retirement was in part prompted by poor reviews for his handling of coverage of the Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977). Buehlman&#x27;s 34-year run at the station was the longest in WBEN history, a benchmark that would eventually be surpassed by Susan Rose in 2019. Kaye, who had been program director of crosstown rival WKBW, originally came to Buffalo via WBZ in Boston.

As the newspaper and TV station became part of other companies, WBEN-AM and FM were sold to Algonquin Broadcasting, a company led by longtime Buffalo radio executive Laurence &quot;Larry&quot; Levite. Levite assembled a group of managers and talent that returned WBEN to prominence. The line-up was changed, and the format shifted from Full-Service, playing Top-40 to Full-Service with Adult Contemporary music. Jefferson Kaye hosted mornings, while Larry Hunter, Bill Lacey, and Kevin O&#x27;Connell and Tom Kelly were heard on middays, and Jack Mindy hosted afternoons. Stan Barron returned to the station, bringing back his &quot;Free-Form Sports&quot; program, and overnights eventually shifted from Dick Rifenburg&#x27;s music show to Mutual&#x27;s syndicated Larry King talk show. Bob Wood served as the station&#x27;s program director. Helicopter traffic reports were added, featuring reporters Dave May and Debbie Stamp, the news department staff was increased - and Levite brought Buffalo Bills broadcasts back to WBEN after a three-year hiatus on WKBW. Van Miller also returned to the Bills&#x27; broadcast booth, replacing WKBW announcer Al Meltzer. WBEN, WJYE (with a beautiful music format), and Top 40 outlet WKBW all fought for the top spot during this era, but WBEN had consistently solidified the number one position by 1980. Stan Barron died in 1984 and was succeeded by John Murphy. By the mid-1980s, Kaye departed WBEN&#x27;s morning show, moving to Philadelphia to become the voice of NFL Films and WPVI-TV. Midday host Bill Lacey, later joined by Kevin Keenan, assumed morning hosting duties.

===1990s===

The station won numerous regional and statewide awards for its news and public-service efforts. Levite presided over the gradual transition of WBEN from an adult contemporary station to its current news and talk format. The local talk continued, along with the addition of Rush Limbaugh. In 1994, Levite sold the WBEN stations to Kerby Confer&#x27;s Keymarket Communications organization and retired from the broadcasting business (Levite later moved to print media and took over the monthly &quot;Buffalo Spree&quot; magazine until his 2017 death). Keymarket later sold the properties to River City Broadcasting, which then merged with Sinclair Broadcast Group. In 1999, Entercom Communications bought WBEN, as well as its competitor WGR and most of Sinclair&#x27;s other radio stations as Sinclair exited the radio business.

===2000-2010===
WBEN and WGR had been competing for news/talk/sports stations during the 1990s. In 2000, under common ownership, the stations rearranged personnel. WGR became the market&#x27;s all-sports station, while WBEN became the market&#x27;s principal commercial news/talk station.

With sister station WGR&#x27;s move to sports talk, WBEN solidified its position as the dominant news/talk station. Market veterans John Zach and Susan Rose replaced Bill Lacey (who currently hosts mornings at WHTT) to host &quot;Buffalo&#x27;s Morning News&quot;. Tom Bauerle moved from WGR to host a mid-morning talk show, Limbaugh&#x27;s program continued, and market veteran Sandy Beach moved from sister station WMJQ to host afternoon talk on the station, while evening hours were filled by syndicated lifestyle hosts Laura Schlessinger and Joy Browne; Browne and Schlessinger were later replaced by &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; and Jim Bohannon, respectively.

===2010-present===
From April 5, 2011, to September 26, 2013, Entercom switched its Classic Rock/Triple-A hybrid sister station WLKK to a simulcast of WBEN. Entercom&#x27;s WLKK was not able to assume the WBEN-FM call letters, since the company had previously released the WBEN-FM call letters. They are in use on a Beasley Broadcast Group station in the Philadelphia area. The &quot;Lake&quot; format continued on WLKK&#x27;s HD2 digital subchannel.

In July 2013, WBEN made its first major change to its daytime lineup in over a decade. The lineup change moved afternoon drive host Sandy Beach to midday, while midday host Tom Bauerle moved to afternoon drive and expanded his show to four hours. The station&#x27;s evening news magazine, &quot;Buffalo&#x27;s Evening News&quot; (which incorporated a simulcast of the first part of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;), was canceled as part of the expansion, a move made to better coordinate with Arbitron&#x27;s dayparting practices. (&quot;Buffalo&#x27;s Evening News&quot; is expected to return in 2018 after Bauerle&#x27;s show was cut back to three hours as part of a contract extension.) After a very brief stint in which David Bellavia filled the shift from 10pm to 1am, the station added &quot;The Savage Nation&quot; to its syndicated offerings in early 2014. It was explained at the time that Bellavia&#x27;s other employer objected to him being on WBEN, so Savage was replacement programming for that slot. Bellavia would however return in late 2016 as Bauerle&#x27;s co-host and eventually moved to middays with his own show in 2020. &quot;Buffalo&#x27;s Evening News&quot; would be revived in 2021 after the death of Rush Limbaugh. WBEN&#x27;s parent company also added Dana Loesch on a tape-delay, which was dropped two years later in favor of an even further tape-delayed airing of Armstrong &amp; Getty.

&quot;Cinema Bob&quot; Stilson, Entercom&#x27;s creative services director, had a one-hour &quot;Movie Show&quot; that discussed upcoming theatrical releases and aired Fridays during Beach&#x27;s program from 1997 until Entercom cut Stilson&#x27;s budget and ended the program in 2017; Stilson later joined WEBR in 2020. Morning host John Zach was permanently laid off at the end of 2016 and later emerged at WECK. Until 2016, WBEN carried news from CBS News Radio, an affiliation the station had held for 76 years. Sandy Beach, whose &quot;Beach and Company&quot; show had been part of the WBEN lineup since 1997, announced his departure from the station in July 2020.

Today, WBEN competes with country-formatted WYRK for the leadership in total audience in most quarterly ratings surveys.

==Simulcasts==
Between 1946 and 1960, WBEN simulcast on co-owned WBEN-FM, which started on 106.5 MHz. From 1960 (when the station moved to 102.5 MHz) until 1973, the morning show continued to be simulcast.The 106.5 frequency was reallocated, switching its call letters to WADV and eventually WYRK. The co-owned TV station, WBEN-TV 4, was sold separately to become WIVB in 1977. WBEN-FM later became WMJQ in 1987, WTSS in 2000, and—after WBEN&#x27;s parent company sold 102.5 to a religious broadcaster in 2023—WBKV.

On April 5, 2011, WBEN began simulcasting on co-owned FM station WLKK at 107.7 MHz, relayed by translator W297AB at 107.3 MHz from Williamsville, New York. On September 26, 2013, WLKK dropped the simulcast.

WBEN was simulcast on the second HD Radio subchannel of WTSS from 2011 to 2015. It is now heard on the HD3 subchannel of WKSE 98.5 MHz.

<text>Albert Venn Dicey, (4 February 1835 – 7 April 1922) was a British Whig jurist and constitutional theorist. He is most widely known as the author of &quot;Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution&quot; (1885). The principles it expounds are considered part of the uncodified British constitution. He became Vinerian Professor of English Law at Oxford, one of the first Professors of Law at the LSE Law School, and a leading constitutional scholar of his day. Dicey popularised the phrase &quot;rule of law&quot;, although its use goes back to the 17th century.

==Biography==
Dicey was born on 4 February 1835. His father was Thomas Edward Dicey, senior wrangler in 1811 and proprietor of the &quot;Northampton Mercury&quot; and Chairman of the Midland Railway. His mother was Annie Marie Stephen, daughter of James Stephen, Master in Chancery. Per his own words, Dicey owed everything to the wisdom and firmness of his mother. His elder brother was Edward James Stephen Dicey. He was also a cousin of Leslie Stephen and Sir James Fitzjames Stephen.

Dicey was educated at King&#x27;s College School in London and Balliol College, Oxford, graduating with Firsts in classical moderations in 1856 and in &quot;literae humaniores&quot; in 1858. In 1860 he won a fellowship at Trinity College, Oxford, which he forfeited upon his marriage in 1872.

He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1863, subscribed to the Jamaica Committee around 1865, and was appointed to the Vinerian Chair of English Law at Oxford in 1882, a post he held until 1909. In his first major work, the seminal &quot;Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution&quot;, he outlined the principles of parliamentary sovereignty for which he is most known. He argued that the British Parliament was &quot;an absolutely sovereign legislature&quot; with the &quot;right to make or unmake any law&quot;. In the book, he defined the term &quot;constitutional law&quot; as including &quot;all rules which directly or indirectly affect the distribution or the exercise of the sovereign power in the state&quot;. He understood that the freedom British subjects enjoyed was dependent on the sovereignty of Parliament, the impartiality of the courts free from governmental interference and the supremacy of the common law. In 1890, he was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

He later left Oxford and went on to become one of the first Professors of Law at the then-new London School of Economics. There he published in 1896 his &quot;Conflict of Laws&quot;. Upon his death on 7 April 1922, Harold Laski memorialised him as &quot;the most considerable figure in English jurisprudence since Maitland.&quot;

==Political views==
Dicey was receptive to Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s brand of individualist liberalism and welcomed the extension of the franchise in 1867. He was affiliated with the group known as the &quot;University Liberals&quot;, who composed the &quot;Essays on Reform&quot; and was not ashamed to be labeled a Radical. Dicey held that &quot;personal liberty is the basis of national welfare.&quot; He treated Parliamentary sovereignty as the central premise of the British constitution.

A member of the Liberal Unionist Party, Dicey was a strong opponent of the Irish Home Rule movement, writing and speaking against it extensively from 1886 until shortly before his death, advocating that no concessions be made to Irish nationalism in relation to the government of any part of Ireland as an integral part of the United Kingdom. In March 1914 Dicey stated that if a Home Rule Bill was passed it &quot;would be a political crime lacking all moral and constitutional authority...the voice of the present House of Commons was not the voice of the nation.&quot; He was thus bitterly disillusioned by the Anglo-Irish Treaty agreement in 1921 that Southern Ireland should become a self-governing dominion (the Irish Free State), separate from the United Kingdom.

Dicey was also vehemently opposed to women&#x27;s suffrage, proportional representation (while acknowledging that the existing first-past-the-post system was not perfect), and to the notion that citizens have the right to ignore unjust laws. Dicey viewed the necessity of establishing a stable legal system as more important than the potential injustice that would occur from following unjust laws. In spite of this, he did concede that there were circumstances in which it would be appropriate to resort to an armed rebellion but stated that such occasions are extremely rare.

<text>George Frederick Marter (6 June 1840 – 10 May 1907) was a politician in the Canadian province of Ontario. He led the Ontario Conservative Party from 1894 to 1896. Marter and Patrick Brown are the only permanent Ontario Conservative leaders who did not lead the party into an election.

==Early career==
After graduating from grammar school in Brantford Marter became a merchant and county councillor in Norfolk County, but later moved to operate a general store Bracebridge, Ontario.

==Politics==
Marter was elected for the riding of Muskoka from 1886 to 1894 and Toronto North from 1894 to 1902.

In 1894, Marter became Conservative leader following William Ralph Meredith&#x27;s acceptance of the position of Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. The Conservative Party he led was aligned with the Protestant Protective Association in the legislature, and was divided by religious conflict and narrow bigotry. Marter was essentially an interim leader.

In 1896, he was replaced as leader by James P. Whitney. He was defeated when he ran as an Independent in the 1902 election.

==Later life==

Following his political career Marter became an insurance agent/manager of the London and Lancashire Insurance Company of Toronto and later co-founder of Marter Hall Company Limited with his son. Marter died in Toronto in 1907.

==Legacy==
Marter Township, Ontario is named for him.

<doc id="499074" wikidata="Q827056" url="?curid=499074" title="SEAT León">
<text>The SEAT León (), also spelled Leon in some other languages (named after the city of León, which also means &quot;Lion&quot; in Spanish), is a small family car built by the Spanish car manufacturer SEAT since October 1999.

The first two León generations used two differing variants of the Volkswagen Group A platform, and shared many components with other Volkswagen Group cars. The third and fourth (current) generation use the Volkswagen Group MQB platform, also used by the Audi A3 Mk3 and Mk4, Volkswagen Golf Mk7 and Mk8 and Škoda Octavia Mk3 and Mk4.
==First generation (1M; 1999)==

The Mk1 SEAT León hatchback (codename &quot;Typ&quot; 1M) launched in 1999, and was produced at Martorell, with a small number of 13,401 cars assembled in Belgium. Based on the Volkswagen Group A4 (PQ34) platform, it shared components with other VW Group models such as the Volkswagen Golf Mk4, but was marketed as a sportier and cheaper variant to that car. To reinforce this image it had a fastback design inspired by the Alfa Romeo Alfasud, and used firmer suspension with wider tyres to improve handling. The dashboard was derived from that of the first-generation Audi A3, with the saloon version called the SEAT Toledo 
Non-turbo petrol engines were the 1.4-litre 16 valve with and 1.6-litre 8 valve with . The facelift replacing the 8 valve with the 16 valve unit. The sportier &quot;León 20VT&quot; (in the UK badged as &quot;Cupra&quot; and then &quot;FR&quot;), had a 1.8-litre Turbo with . The fastest &quot;Cupra R&quot; had , and later . 

The original Cupra was only available in the red, yellow and black colors of the Spanish and German national flags, as a homage to these countries collaborating on this project.

In some countries there was a &quot;Cupra 4&quot; with a 2.8-litre VR6 delivering and four-wheel drive (4WD). This uses the same Haldex Traction system as the Volkswagen Golf 4motion.

A range of turbocharged direct injection (TDI) diesel engines were available, including a version. Originally sold as a &quot;Cupra 4 TDI&quot; 4WD, it was only sold for one year in certain countries and then became 2WD. This facelift model was first badged &quot;Cupra&quot; in the UK, &quot;Top Sport&quot; in most European countries, and then &quot;FR&quot; everywhere. A limited number of &quot;FR&quot; cars were fitted with the &quot;Cupra R&quot; body kit and named &quot;FR+&quot;. Lesser diesel versions were available with , and .
All engines over have a six-speed manual transmission. Rear suspension is semi-independent torsion beam, except for 4WD models fitted with multi-link independent rear suspension. All versions came with four wheel disc brakes.

In Switzerland there was an official tuner model by Abt Sportsline called &quot;SEAT León Cupra 4 Kompressor&quot;. This version added a supercharger to the 2.8-litre VR6 producing and of torque.

Production of the &quot;Typ&quot; 1M ended in May 2006, however the appreciation for the SEAT León Cupra R Mk1 continues. In a 2010 &#x27;best hot hatchback of all time&#x27; poll conducted by &quot;Autocar&quot;, its readers voted the Cupra R at number 7.

===Awards===

*&#x27;Carro do Ano&#x27; (Car of the Year) award in 2001, in Portugal
*&#x27;Most Satisfactory Car of the Year 2007&#x27; in Poland, by the Polish magazine &quot;Auto Swiat&quot;

===Engine choices===
The &quot;Typ&quot; 1M SEAT León was available with the following internal combustion engines, with all being shared with other marques of the Volkswagen Group:
==Second generation (1P; 2005)==

Factory production of the second generation León, internal codename &quot;Typ&quot; 1P, commenced in May 2005. Similar in design to the SEAT Altea that launched a year earlier, it debuted modern Alfa Romeo like design cues and vertically parked wipers. Volkswagen&#x27;s Driver Steering Recommendation (DSR) was available as an option.

The Mk2 León used the new 16 valve 1.2-litre TSI petrol engine with . In some markets (e.g. Greece, Romania and Italy), the base Leon used the older 1.4-litre MPI engine producing . Sportier FR badged variants began with the 2.0-litre Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) and the popular 2.0-litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine. Both were fitted with a six-speed manual transmission, with a six-speed or seven-speed Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) as an option. A 2.0 TFSI was introduced, but due to poor sales and the launch of FR models it was discontinued.

In June 2006 the León received the 2.0 TFSI engine from the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 GTI, with twin chrome exhaust pipes, sport seats, stiffer suspension, climate control and FR branded parts. Also available was a 2.0 TDI.

The faster 2.0 TFSI Cupra model features a engine, with a 0- time of 6.4 seconds. Unique Cupra parts included 18&quot; 5 twin-spoke alloys, red brake calipers, oval exhaust, aluminium pedals, paint colours and heavily bolstered sports seats.

Launched in 2008 the K1 León Cupra was made for one year for the UK market. Inspired by the BTCC race car, it featured redesigned bumpers, side skirts, rear spoiler and oval exhaust.

The fastest Mk2 León is the 2.0 TFSI Cupra R, using the same engine found in the Audi S3 and Golf/Scirocco R. The 0– time is 6.2 seconds with a limited top speed of .

In 2009 the León range received a facelift, and the Cupra was in the &quot;SEAT Cupra race&quot; mobile game for Apple iPhone/iPod Touch available through the iTunes&#x27; App store.

It is the second car to be based on the MQB platform.

It features new safety equipment, such as driver knee airbag, and a number of new safety systems, including (often as standard) a multi-collision braking system to automatically brake the car after an accident in order to avoid a second collision, a lane-keeping assistant, and driver fatigue detection. The braking system includes a hill-start assistant.

In the interior, there is a driver-oriented centre console hosting a 5.8-inch touch-screen infotainment display with some models featuring a proximity sensor, also used in the Volkswagen Golf, as well as ambient lighting.

==Motorsport==
The first generation SEAT León Cupra R was the basis of a one-make trophy, the SEAT Leon Supercopa. It operated in Spain, UK, Germany and Turkey from 2003. The car was developed by SEAT Sport and power was raised to . An &quot;International Masters&quot; final, featuring the best four drivers from each national series, was introduced in October 2005, as a support race for the Spanish GT Championship&#x27;s final round at Montmeló. A TDI-powered version has raced in the ECTS, an Italian-based endurance series for touring cars.

In 2006, the Supercopa León was replaced by the new shape León. The car is potentially faster than the WTCC version, as it features a turbocharged 2.0-litre engine, with over , increased torque, the DSG gearbox, better aerodynamics (it includes the WTCC car&#x27;s front and rear spoilers, plus a venturi tunnel under the car, instead of a flat bottom), and 18 inch wheels, instead of the mandatory 17 inch wheels from the WTCC.

For 2007, the SEAT Cupra Championship in the UK (part of the TOCA Package) will run both &#x27;New León&#x27; Cupra Race cars with , as well as the Mk1 León Cupra R race car with .

The SEAT Leon Eurocup began in 2008 as a support series for the World Touring Car Championship.

The car came top in Class D in the 2014 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour.

=== SEAT León Super 2000 car ===
During 2005, SEAT introduced the second generation León into the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) to replace the Toledo Cupra which it had raced in the early rounds of the title. The car featured several modifications, including a racing engine that developed over , a Hewland sequential-shift gearbox (unrelated to the DSG), and an aerodynamic package for increased downforce (with its hatchback shape, the León was disadvantaged against conventional three-box saloons). Minimum weight is with driver. SEAT Sport, in partnership with Oreca, ran six cars in the WTCC. Two other cars were run by SEAT Sport UK (Northern South) based in Northampton, UK in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC). A further two cars were run by SEAT Sport Italia in the Italia Superturismo Championship.

In mid-2007 SEAT introduced the León TDI to combat BMW&#x27;s dominance by utilizing 2.0-liter Volkswagen EA189 TDI inline-4 turbodiesel engine. The car did show promise with Yvan Muller behind the wheel and the team was set to score championship win in Macau, but reliability issues caused Muller an retirement in Race 1 and the engine problems weren&#x27;t solved in time thus not starting in Race 2 and handing the title to Andy Priaulx with BMW 320si.

In 2008, Muller won the FIA World Touring Car Championship for Drivers at the wheel of a León TDI, and SEAT won the Manufacturers&#x27; title. León TDI was also fielded by SEAT UK in the British Touring Car Championship with Jason Plato being the lead driver. Plato finished second behind Fabrizio Giovanardi with Vauxhall in the drivers&#x27; championship. At the end of the season SEAT UK withdrew from the series and subsequently this was the only season where León TDI competed in the BTCC.

In 2009, Gabriele Tarquini became the Drivers&#x27; Champion with the León TDI, and SEAT won the Manufacturers&#x27; title for a second consecutive year. At the end of the season SEAT Sport officially ended their manufacturer support. León TDI cars were entered by Sunred Engineering for the following season and despite not having official manufacturer support from SEAT, in the manufacturers&#x27; championship the entity was named SEAT Customers Technology. Tarquini finished second in the drivers&#x27; standings behind Yvan Muller with Chevrolet.

For 2011, new rules were introduced in WTCC, incorporating a new engine formula - 1.6 turbocharged engines, similar to those used in the World Rally Championship. In line with the changes Sunred created the SUNRED SR León 1.6T, using the then León TDI as base. The cars, however, were not ready for the start of the season, and Sunred drivers used the older León TDI, which was still eligible to enter thanks to the Jay Ten Trophy, introduced by the series promoter Eurosport for 2010-spec cars.

In 2012, SEAT Sport unofficially returned to the series introducing the SEAT León WTCC, effectively replacing the SR León from Sunred, to privateer entries. Some drivers like Tom Boardman and Tiago Monteiro started the season using the old León TDI. The TDI version was still eligible in the European Touring Car Cup where Fernando Monje won the 2012 championship. For the following season León TDI was banned from ETC Cup and with everyone now upgraded to the León WTCC 2012 marked the last time diesel car was entered in WTCC and ETCC. The Léon WTCC continued to be eligible until the introduction of TC1 in 2014 (although León WTCC was able to be entered in the TC2 class in the same year as TC1&#x27;s introduction).

=== León Cup Racer and León TCR ===

In 2013 SEAT Sport introduced a concept car, based on the third generation of León. Initially it was thought that this would be the car in which SEAT Sport would return to the series with full manufacturer team under the new TC1 regulations. However SEAT Sport announced that the car would be part of the revived León Eurocup for 2014.

The León Cup Racer then formed the base for the newly formed TCR International Series. The TCR regulations use this car as a template for the aerodynamic portions of the cars. In 2016 SEAT Sport introduced a TCR-spec version of the León with the original Cup Racer still being eligible in the International Series as well as national and regional championship utilising the TCR regulations.

=== León (NGTC) ===

Team HARD Racing built and ran four new Cupra León cars for the 2021 season. The drivers were announced to be Glynn Geddie, Jack Goff, Nicolas Hamilton and Árón Taylor-Smith. As of Brands Hatch race 3, the car has scored points in every race as well as a podium, courtesy of Goff.

=== León e-Racer (ETCR) ===

The Cupra e-Racer is an electric car touring car. It competed in the e-TCR electric touring car racing series, against competitors from Hyundai and Alfa Romeo, securing the manufacturer&#x27;s championship following the inaugural season in 2021 and the second season in 2022.

<text>The Force de dissuasion (), known as the Force de frappe (&#x27;Strike Force&#x27;) prior to 1961, is the French nuclear deterrence force. The &quot;Force de dissuasion&quot; used to be a triad of air-, sea- and land-based nuclear weapons intended for &quot;dissuasion&quot;, the French term for deterrence. Following the end of the Cold War, France decommissioned all its land-based nuclear missiles, thus the &quot;Force de dissuasion&quot; today only incorporates an air- and sea-based arsenal. 

The French Nuclear Force, part of the French military, is the fourth largest nuclear-weapons force in the world, after the nuclear triads of the United States, the Russian Federation and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

On 27 January 1996, France conducted its last nuclear test in the South Pacific and then signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in September 1996. In March 2008, French President Nicolas Sarkozy confirmed reports giving the actual size of France&#x27;s nuclear arsenal and he announced that France would reduce its French Air Force-carried nuclear arsenal by 30%, leaving the &quot;Force de Frappe&quot; with 290 warheads.

In addition to its nuclear military programme, France has a large peaceful nuclear programme and ranks as one of the world&#x27;s largest generators of nuclear power.

== History ==

The decision to arm France with nuclear weapons was made in 1954 by the administration of Pierre Mendès France under the Fourth Republic. President Charles de Gaulle, upon his return to power in 1958, solidified the initial vision into the well-defined concept of a fully independent &quot;Force de frappe&quot; that would be capable of protecting France from a Soviet or other foreign attack and independent of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which de Gaulle considered to be too dominated by the United States. In particular, France was concerned that in the event of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe, the US, already bogged down in the Korean War and afraid of Soviet retaliation against the United States, would not come to the aid of its allies in Western Europe. De Gaulle felt that France should never entrust its defense and therefore its very existence to a foreign and thus unreliable protector.

The strategic concept behind the &quot;Force de Frappe&quot; is one of countervalue, the capacity to inflict so much damage on a potential (and more powerful) adversary&#x27;s population that the potential adversary will be deterred from attacking, no matter how much destruction it can inflict (mutual assured destruction). This principle is usually referred to in French political debate as &quot;dissuasion du faible au fort&quot; (&quot;deterrence from the weak to the strong&quot;) and was summarized in a statement attributed to de Gaulle himself:

General Pierre Marie Gallois said, &quot;Making the most pessimistic assumptions, the French nuclear bombers could destroy ten Russian cities; and France is not a prize worthy of ten Russian cities&quot;.

In his book &quot;La paix nucléaire&quot; (1975), French Navy Admiral Marc de Joybert explained deterrence:

While not referred to as such, the French nuclear posture of the time bears some significant similarities to other common policies of the era such as mutually assured destruction and massive retaliation. It remains unknown whether the French government ever seriously considered its policy different from other NATO member strategies or if their public statements were more aimed to improve morale and confidence in the French population.

It may seem that on the surface, an avowed policy of attacking civilians was a significant departure from the typical nuclear policies of the time, but it was common for states to refer to their nuclear abilities in terms of numbers of cities destroyed. Moreover, hydrogen bombs are so powerful that if used to their full potential high civilian casualties and related collateral damage would be inevitable, thus making it unclear as to whether targeting military forces would produce a meaningfully different result compared to targeting population centers. Perhaps the most significant difference in French strategy is that it includes the option of a first strike attack, even in response to non-nuclear provocation.

France carried out its first test of an atomic bomb in Algeria in 1960 and some operational French nuclear weapons became available in 1964. Then, France executed its first test of the much more powerful hydrogen bomb over its South Pacific Ocean test range in 1968.

De Gaulle&#x27;s vision of the &quot;Force de Frappe&quot; featured the same triad of air-based, land-based and sea-based weapons that were deployed by both the United States and the Soviet Union. Work on the components had started in the late 1950s and was accelerated as soon as de Gaulle became the president.

=== Air ===
Initially, the &quot;Force de Frappe&quot; had an airbase component of the Strategic Air Forces Command (Commandement des Forces Aeriennes Strategique (CFAS)) of the French Air Force, established in 1955 and operating 40 Sud Aviation Vautour IIB bombers. They were considered marginal for a strategic bomber role, and work began almost immediately on a replacement resulting in the Mirage III.

In May 1956, a requirement for what became the Dassault Mirage IV bomber was drawn up; the bomber was designed to carry AN-11 nuclear gravity bombs over targets in the Eastern bloc at supersonic speeds and was declared operational in October 1964. It was later modernized and converted to carry its successor, the AN-22 bomb. The Mirage IV-P version was armed with the ASMP missile and entered service in 1986. All bomber versions of the Mirage IV retired in 1996.

From 1973 to 2003, the CFAS also operated SEPECAT Jaguars, limited nuclear capable of using the tactical AN-52 nuclear bomb, which were certified for supersonic flight. A total of 100 were built from 1972 to 1982. They were compatible with modified Mirage III fighters and later with the standard Jaguar. The Mirage 2000 was theoretically capable of carrying it but never did so. The AN-52&#x27;s were deactivated and placed into storage in 1991.

The Mirage 2000N entered service in 1988 and can carry gravity bombs, the ASMP and the new longer-ranged ASMP-A missile, which entered service 2009. The Mirage 2000N was being replaced by the Dassault Rafale F3 as of 2011.

=== Land ===

The land-based component of the French nuclear triad was added in August 1971, when 18 silo-based S2 medium-range ballistic missiles, which achieved operational readiness at French Air Force Aerial Base 200 Saint Christol Albion, in Vaucluse, southern France. Later, the land-based component was augmented with the mobile shortrange &quot;Pluton&quot; missile and &quot;Hadès&quot; missile, which were designed to be launched from the front lines at any approaching foreign army. To defend against a Soviet-Warsaw Pact invasion of West Germany, they could be deployed with the French Army in the French Zone of Germany, in Western Germany.

Since the French military judged a full-scale invasion of Western Europe by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact Allies to be unlikely to be stopped by conventional armaments, the short-range nuclear missiles were meant as a &quot;final warning&quot; (&quot;ultime avertissement&quot; in French), which would tell the aggressor that any further advances would trigger a nuclear armageddon upon its major cities and other important targets.

The &quot;Pluton&quot; missile, introduced in 1974, was retired from service and scrapped beginning in 1993, and its successor, the &quot;Hadès&quot; missile, was produced in limited numbers during the early 1990s and then withdrawn from the army and placed in arsenal storage in 1995. Next, the French government decided to eliminate all of those missiles, and the last &quot;Hadès&quot; was dismantled on 23 June 1997. That was the end of the French mobile land-based nuclear missiles.

The French fixed S3 IRBMs at the Plateau d&#x27;Albion were considered to be approaching obsolescence and also deemed to be no longer necessary following the fall of the Soviet Union and so also were disposed of. The silos have been imploded and the missile base closed in 1999, eliminating the landbased missile leg of the French nuclear triad.

=== Sea ===
The ocean-based, mobile component of the French nuclear triad entered service in December 1971, with the commissioning of its first ballistic missile submarine, the nuclear submarine &quot;Le Redoutable&quot;, which initially carried 16 M1 intermediate-range ballistic missiles, similar to the US Polaris missiles.

Since then, the ocean-based French nuclear weapons arsenal has been expanded to a squadron of four submarines, one of which is always on patrol. Since 1985, some of the French ballistic missile subs have become obsolete. The subs have been retired and replaced by newer subs that also have 16 missile tubes apiece and carry the more advanced French M45 missile. A new submarine, the &quot;Le Terrible&quot;, was put into service on 20 September 2010, armed with the M51 missile, which is similar to the US Trident II.

The Aeronavale or French Naval Aviation has operated a fleet of nuclear-armed aircraft since 1962, with the Dassault Etendard IV on its &quot;Clemenceau&quot;-class aircraft carriers. The Etendard could be armed with AN-52 nuclear gravity bombs. In 1978, the Dassault Super Etendard entered service, giving the Aeronavale a stand-off nuclear strike ability via its Air-Sol Moyenne Portée (ASMP) nuclear missiles. As the &quot;Clemenceau&quot; class retired from 1997 to 2000, the Super Etendard remained in service on the succeeding R91 &quot;Charles-de-Gaulle&quot;. Since 2010 it carries Rafale F3 fighters armed with the upgraded ASMP-A nuclear missiles.

== Components ==

=== Land-based component ===
France no longer possesses land-based nuclear missiles. The IRBM &quot;base aérienne 200 Apt-Saint-Christol&quot; at the Plateau d&#x27;Albion (Vaucluse) was deactivated in 1996 and its missiles scrapped. All French Army units equipped with short-range missiles such as the &quot;Pluton&quot; and the &quot;Hadès&quot; were disbanded, their missiles scrapped and their fissile nuclear materials recycled.

=== Sea-based component ===
The French Navy includes a nuclear strategic branch, the Force Océanique Stratégique, which has contained as many as 6 nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines in service at one time. Up to 2022, the ten SSBNs built for the French Navy are:
* 6 Redoutable class submarines, armed with 16 M4 IRBMs entered service between 1971 and 1985. The last of these, &quot;L&#x27;Inflexible&quot; (S 615), was retired from service in 2008.
* 4 &quot;Triomphant&quot;-class SSBNs: &quot;Le Triomphant&quot; (S 616), &quot;Le Téméraire&quot; (S 617), &quot;Le Vigilant&quot; (S 618), &quot;Le Terrible&quot; (S 619). Commissioned between 1997 and 2010, each armed with 16 M51 SLBMs.

=== Air-based component ===

The Armée de l&#x27;air et de l&#x27;espace has 54 &quot;ASMP-A&quot; medium-range air-to-ground missiles with the TNA (Airborne nuclear warhead) at its disposal. These are deployed on the Dassault Rafale B, which fully replaced the Dassault Mirage 2000N in 2018.

The Aviation navale can operate the ASMP-A missile from the Dassault Rafale M (CATOBAR carrier variant). These aircraft are landbased at Landivisiau Naval Air Base and on the aircraft carrier &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; when at sea. Thus they can be operated flexibly. The Rafale M is also certified to operate from United States Navy aircraft carriers.

The locations of the nuclear missiles are secret (although many storage facilities are already known to the public, the number of warheads inside is classified and changes frequently). The range of strike aircraft is extended currently by the KC-135 and in the future by the forthcoming Airbus A330 MRTT aerial refueling fleet.

=== Nuclear ordnance security Gendarmerie ===
Source:

The Nuclear ordnance security Gendarmerie (French: Gendarmerie de la sécurité des armements nucléaires GSAN) was created in 1964 and is one of the five specialized branches of the French Gendarmerie. It is placed under the supervision the Ministry of Armed Forces and plays a major role in the security chain of the nuclear devices.

The main mission of this specific branch is to secure the government&#x27;s control over all the nuclear forces and weapons.

More specifically, the gendarmes of this unit are responsible for ensuring the protection and the readiness of the different kinds of missiles used by the French Navy and Air Force.

In order to do so, the GSAN is composed of its own units and of units from other branches of the gendarmerie, temporarily placed under its command like squadrons of the Mobile Gendarmerie to protect the convoys of nuclear weapons components.

=== Jupiter Command Post ===
The Jupiter Command Post is a structure in the bunker of the Élysée Palace. It is equipped with means of communication and protection to enable the French president and his advisers to manage crisis situations and to be in contact at all times with other government entities, military command posts and foreign governments. The bunker was built for President Albert Lebrun in 1940 during the Phoney War, and President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing installed its command post in 1978.

<text>Grünkern (, &#x27;green kernel&#x27;) is spelt that has been harvested when half ripe and then artificially dried. &quot;Grünkern&quot; is traditionally produced in the Bauland region in the north-east of Baden-Württemberg (Germany). In response to periods of adverse weather, which destroyed crops, spelt was harvested before it was completely ripe, during the so-called &#x27;dough-ripe phase&#x27;, at about 50% moisture content. Because the dried kernels exhibited a pleasing flavor when cooked in water, it became traditional to harvest a portion of the spelt crop as grünkern.

As a winter crop, the spelt meant for Grünkern would be harvested at the end of July and subsequently dehydrated, traditionally over a beechwood fire, or in modern times, in heated-air ovens. This preserves the grünkern (by reducing moisture content to 13%) and endows it with its typical taste and aroma. Before further processing, Grünkern must be husked or milled. Grünkern husk has been used as a cattle feed, or as the filler for small pillows which are meant to promote healthy sleep.

The first attested use of grünkern was in southern Germany, (Amorbach), in 1660. Grünkern was added to soups, and was dried by using the residual heat of bakehouses.

The primary harvesting period at the end of July is also seen in old folk proverbs, such as: 
&quot;Christine, Jagowi, Sankt Anne is Ern! / Schneid&#x27;t mer kee Korn, / so schneid&#x27;t mer doch Keern.&quot; 
Christine, James, Saint Anne means harvest time! / If we don&#x27;t reap wheat, / we reap grünkern.

<text>Bridgewater College is a private liberal-arts college in Bridgewater, Virginia. Established in 1880, Bridgewater College admitted both men and women from the time of its founding and was the first four-year liberal arts college in Virginia to do so. Approximately 1,800 students are enrolled.

==History==

Bridgewater College was established in 1880 as Spring Creek Normal and Collegiate Institute by Daniel Christian Flory. Nine years later, the school was named Bridgewater College and chartered by the Commonwealth of Virginia to grant undergraduate degrees. Bridgewater conferred its first Bachelor of Arts degree on June 1, 1891. In 1895, the Chairman of the Faculty, Walter B. Yount, a graduate of what would become Juniata College and the University of Virginia was named the college&#x27;s first President. After his retirement in 1910, John S. Flory (an early Bridgewater graduate who also received degrees from other institution and had served on the faculty and as vice-president) succeeded him as the college&#x27;s president.

Bridgewater College became the first senior co-educational liberal arts college in Virginia and one of the few accredited colleges of its type in the South.

The oldest portion of the Bridgewater College campus, consisting of five brick collegiate buildings constructed before 1911, is included in the Bridgewater Historic District. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

=== 2022 shooting ===
On February 1, 2022, 55-year-old campus police officer John Painter and 48-year-old campus safety officer J.J. Jefferson were shot and killed on campus after being called to investigate a suspicious person on campus. The shooter, a 27-year-old former student named Alexander Wyatt Campbell, was later apprehended after a manhunt and suffered a gunshot injury at some point during the incident. In February 2024, Campbell plead guilty to murdering both officers and was sentenced to life in prison.

===Repatriation of Native American items===
The college is returning sacred funerary belongings and remains that were donated to the college. These items are protected by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA).

==Academics==
Bridgewater offers more than 60 majors and minors, awarding the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. Bridgewater students have the opportunity to study abroad through the BCA Study Abroad program and May Term Travel Courses.

Bridgewater also offers the Flory Honors Program. Flory Fellows gain access to many opportunities and benefits, including honors sections of general education courses limited to 15 students each, housing within the honors community, and more.

Bridgewater was ranked #229 in national liberal arts colleges based on the U.S. News &amp; World Report.

== Student life ==
=== Traditions ===
Annual events at Bridgewater College celebrate tradition, community, alumni, and culture. Founder&#x27;s Day observance at Bridgewater commemorates the April 3, 1854, birth of Daniel Christian Flory, who began Bridgewater College in 1880, at the age of 26.

Homecoming weekend in October welcomes alumni back to the college with class reunions, outdoor festivities, a home football game and the annual Athletic Hall of Fame banquet.

<doc id="499091" wikidata="Q1588078" url="?curid=499091" title="The Unfortunate Traveller">
<text>The Unfortunate Traveller: or, the Life of Jack Wilton (originally published as &quot;The Unfortunate Traueller: or, The Life of Jacke Wilton&quot;) is a picaresque novel by Thomas Nashe first published in 1594 but set during the reign of Henry VIII of England. In this adventurous and episodic work, Nashe&#x27;s protagonist Jack Wilton navigates 16th-century Europe engaging with historical events. The story sees Jack swindle at a military camp, witness a massacre in Münster, and travels with Surrey. They meet literary figures, engage in deceit in Italy, and face various challenges. The narrative explores themes of religion, hypocrisy, and cultural differences. Jack&#x27;s journey culminates in Italy, where he faces personal and moral dilemmas, ultimately leaving the &quot;Sodom of Italy&quot; with his wife Diamante.

==Synopsis==
In this rollicking and stylistically daring work of prose fiction, Nashe&#x27;s protagonist Jack Wilton adventures through the European continent and finds himself swept up in the currents of sixteenth-century history. Episodic in nature, the narrative jumps from place to place and danger to danger. Jack begins his tale among fellow Englishmen at a military encampment, where he swindles his superiors out of alcohol and money, framing others as traitors. Commenting by the way on the grotesque sweating sickness, Jack arrives in Münster, Germany, to observe the massacre of John Leyden&#x27;s Anabaptist faction by the Emperor and the Duke of Saxony; this brutal episode enables Nashe to reflect on religious hypocrisy, a theme to which he frequently returns.

Following the massacre of the Anabaptists at Munster, Jack Wilton has a number of personal encounters with historical figures of the sixteenth century, many of them important for their literary contributions. Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey functions as a sustained travel partner for Jack, and the two journey to Italy to fulfill the Earl&#x27;s pledge to defend the honor of his beloved Geraldine in a tournament. Surrey&#x27;s grandiloquent praise for Geraldine evinces clearly the author&#x27;s ability to play with literary history, for although the poet was in truth married to Frances Howard, Nashe fashions her into the beloved object of the poet&#x27;s courtly affections. Surrey and Jack pass through Rotterdam, where they meet both Erasmus and Sir Thomas More, who are at work on their important prose works &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot; and &quot;Utopia&quot;. Following this episode, the pair reaches the university city of Wittenberg, which enables Nashe to mock the customs of Renaissance academia, especially its convoluted orations and bizarre gestures and body language. Following the orations, the magician Cornelius Agrippa reveals in an enchanted mirror the image of Surrey&#x27;s beloved, &quot;weeping on her bed, and resolved all into devout religion for the absence of her love.&quot; The image causes Surrey to burst into poetry and spurs him forward with his new page Jack.

Passing into Italy, the land where the remainder of the narrative unfolds, Jack and Surrey exchange identities as a security measure and because the earl means &quot;to take more liberty of behaviour.&quot; The two engage in acts of deceit and trickery with pimps, prostitutes, and counterfeiters. Forced to dig themselves out of a succession of plots, the disguised Jack and Surrey assume much of the duplicitous behaviour that Italians were stereotypically known for in Renaissance England. Commenting on the pander Petro de Campo Frego, Jack states that &quot;he planted in us the first Italianate wit that we had.&quot; While imprisoned for fraud, Surrey and Jack meet Diamante, who had been falsely accused of adultery and cast out by her husband; Jack takes her up as his romantic companion and financier. All three characters are freed soon enough thanks to an English connection to the famous satirist Pietro Aretino. Nashe, who professed elsewhere his own desires to emulate Aretino&#x27;s literary style, offers praise for the satirist as &quot;one of the wittiest knaves that ever God made.&quot;

Departing from Venice, Surrey and Jack arrive in Florence, the city where Geraldine was born. Surrey is overcome with poetry and speaks a sonnet in honor of her fair room, a moment in which Nashe can slyly mock the overbearing, lovesick verse of contemporary imitators of Petrarch. The copia of Surrey&#x27;s verse then gives way to a tournament in which the Earl competes for his beloved&#x27;s fair name, and Nashe offers gratuitous descriptions of the competitors&#x27; armor and horses in a manner that recalls printed accounts of early modern masques and other festive spectacles. The most worthy competitor, Surrey emerges from the tournament victorious, but is suddenly called back into England for business matters.

Jack and Diamante then travel to Rome, which Jack admires for its classical ruins (he is less impressed by its religious relics). By this point in time, Jack clearly sticks out as a foreigner and a tourist, &quot;imitat[ing] four or five sundry nations in my attire at once.&quot; After praising the marvelous wonders of artificially-engineered gardens and lamenting the gruesome, simultaneous realities of the plague, the protagonist stumbles into one of the most memorable episodes of the narrative. Esdras of Granado and his lackey Bartol the Italian break into the house where he and Diamante are lodging, and Esdras rapes the virtuous matron Heraclide, who commits suicide after an eloquent oration. Jack witnesses the episode &quot;through a cranny of my upper chamber unsealed,&quot; and some critics believe this act of voyeurism makes Jack complicit in the act of rape.

Heraclide&#x27;s husband accuses Jack of the rape, but another English character known as the &quot;Banished Earl&quot; stays Jack&#x27;s execution. This comes at a slight cost, however; banned from his beloved home country, the Earl rattles off a catalogue of reasons to avoid travel at all costs. In Italy, one only learns &quot;the art of atheism, the art of epicurizing, the art of whoring, the art of poisoning, the art of sodomitry.&quot; France gains one only a knowledge of wine and the &quot;French disease,&quot; syphilis. In Spain, one only acquires strange clothing. The Dutch excel only in their drinking. Such an admonitory catalogue follows the precepts found in the writings of the Elizabethan education theorist Roger Ascham, who warned his fellow Englishmen about the dangers of Italy and its books.

In spite of the Banished English Earl&#x27;s suggestions, Jack remains in Italy in search of his beloved Diamante. In so doing, he becomes entangled with and entrapped by Zadok the Jew and Zachary, the Papal Physician, who plan to use Jack as a specimen at the anatomical college. Freed from the brutal pair by the wiles of Juliana, the Pope&#x27;s courtesan, Jack reunites with Diamante and robs Juliana of her goods, while Zachary flees and Zadok faces a grotesque combination of torture and execution.

The final episode of &quot;The Unfortunate Traveller&quot; returns to the character of Esdras, who figures now as a victim. At Bologna, Jack and Diamante observe the public execution of Cutwolf, the brother of Esdras&#x27;s lackey Bartol. Standing before the crowd, Cutwolf delivers a speech recounting his vile actions. Seeking vengeance for his brother&#x27;s murder, Cutwolf tracked down the villain Esdras, confronted him, and forced him to blaspheme against God and against salvation before discharging a pistol into his mouth, thereby damning his soul eternally in death. Self-righteously, he declares in his own defense before the crowd that &quot;This is the fault that hath called me hither. No true Italian but will honour me for it. Revenge is the glory of arms and the highest performance of valour.&quot; In spite of such an oration, Cutwolf joins the ranks of the narrative&#x27;s brutally-executed characters, and Jack and his newly-wed Diamante flee out of &quot;the Sodom of Italy&quot; back toward the English encampment in France, where the story first began.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Unfortunate Traveller&quot; was printed in quarto in 1594 by Thomas Scarlet for Cuthbert Burby. A &quot;Newly corrected and augmented&quot; edition of the text appeared later in the same year by the same publisher. No new editions appeared through the handpress era.

==Modern references==
In &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, Sir Jack Wilton (standing in for real-life Elizabethan spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham) was the &quot;M&quot; of the late 16th century. He led a group of special operatives called Prospero&#x27;s Men shortly after the reign of &quot;Good Queen Gloriana&quot; of England.

<text>Marousi or Maroussi (), also known as Amarousio (), is a city and a suburb in the northeastern part of the Athens urban area, Greece. Marousi dates back to the era of the ancient Athenian Republic; its ancient name was &quot;Athmonon&quot; () and it represented one of the 10 Athenian sub-cities. The area held a main ancient temple, where Amarysia Artemis, the goddess of hunting, was adored. Consequently the city&#x27;s modern name derives from that of the goddess, &quot;Amarysia&quot;, which denotes the origin of the worship back in Amarynthos, Euboea. Its mayor is Theodoros Ampatzoglou, re-elected in 2023.

==Geography==

Marousi is situated northeast of Athens city centre. The municipality has an area of 12.938 km2. The built-up area of Marousi is continuous with those of the neighbouring suburbs Pefki, Kifisia, Vrilissia and Halandri. Within Marousi lies the biggest forest in urban Athens, &quot;Dasos Syngrou&quot; (also &quot;Alsos Syggrou&quot;). The Athens Olympic Sports Complex, the largest sports complex in Greece, built for the 2004 Summer Olympics, is located in the southwestern part of the municipality.

The main thoroughfare is the Kifisias Avenue (part of the EO83 road), which connects Marousi with central Athens and the A6 toll motorway. Marousi has 3 stations on Athens Metro Line 1, Nerantziotissa, and stations and two suburban (Proastiakos) commuter railway stations: Neratziotissa station and Kifisias railway station.

==Economy==

Marousi&#x27;s favourable infrastructure (A6 motorway, Athens Metro, and the Athens Suburban Railway) has led to strong economic growth. The main offices of the Greek subsidiaries of several multinational corporations, including Google, Kodak, Bayer, Kimberly-Clark, Siemens, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Microsoft and Nestlé, and the ANT1 television studios are located in Marousi. The managing office of Consolidated Contractors Company, a large Middle Eastern and International EPC Contractor, is located in Marousi. The Mall Athens, one of the largest shopping centres in southeastern Europe, is situated in the southwestern part of Marousi.

==Education==
The new building of Greek Ministry of Education is located in Marousi, in the district Neratziotissa. In the same district is located the School of Pedagogical and Technological Education, a Greek university. The German School of Athens is also located in Marousi.

==Sports==
Maroussi is the place of Greek Olympic Sport Center. It is located in the southwest of the suburb, in an area that is named Kalogreza. Maroussi has also some sport gymnasium such as Dais Indoor Hall and Maroussi Indoor Hall that are used by local teams. Local teams are Maroussi B.C. with long-time presence in A1 Ethniki Basketball and A.C. Doukas with many titles in Handball and Futsal. The Olympic Stadium was used as home stadium by famous clubs of Greek football, including by AEK as well as both Panathinaikos and Olympiacos.
==Historical population==
The village was historically Arvanitika speaking, however due to its proximity to Athens, it has undergone a language shift.

==Twin cities==
Marousi is twinned with the following cities:
* Faenza, Italy
* Niš, Serbia
* Lakatamia, Cyprus
* Mendavia, Spain

==Crime==
Even though Marousi has been a quiet neighbourhood through the years, lately it has become a source of youth gangs making it one of the most dangerous neighbourhoods in North Attica along with Neo Irakleio and Nea Ionia.

== Notable people ==

*Prince Michael of Greece (1939–2024), son of Prince Christopher of Greece and grandson of King George I of the Hellenes. Prince Michael lived in Marousi from his marriage to Marina Karella in 1965, since late 1970s.

<text>The SEAT Alhambra is a seven-seater minivan that was built from 1996 to 2020. It was manufactured under the SEAT brand from June 1996 onwards at the Volkswagen Group&#x27;s AutoEuropa plant in Palmela, Portugal. It shares the same platform with the Volkswagen Sharan, and the first generation was also related to the Ford Galaxy. The vehicle is named after the Alhambra of Granada, a famous monument in Spain. It is considered in the motor industry to be a large multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).

==First generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 7M; 1996)==
A prototype of the first generation SEAT Alhambra was presented at the 1995 Geneva Salon International de l&#x27;Auto. The following year the production Alhambra was launched at the same motor show and went on sale in June. The Alhambra shares most of its components and design with the VW Sharan Mk1 and Ford Galaxy Mk1. However, the Alhambra has more options fitted for a given price range. The Alhambra has seven seats—the five rear seats can be folded down or unclipped and removed completely. When removed the seats leave a flat-floored load space, a unique feature for SEAT vehicles at that time. The load volume varies, from 256l with seven seats, to 852l with five seats, and 2610l with only the two front seats fitted.

The Alhambra was essentially unchanged from 1996 to 2010 but a major restyling in the year 2000 reflected the new SEAT image. Even so, the Alhambra remained faithful to the original design produced under the Volkswagen Group and Ford technology sharing agreement. When Volkswagen and Ford lost market share to other manufacture&#x27;s MPVs, including the Toyota Previa and Mitsubishi Space Wagon, they changed the design of their versions.

The Alhambra, Sharan, and Galaxy were built on the same production line at the joint venture AutoEuropa plant in Palmela, Portugal, and were essentially the same but with different engine options and interiors. Ford has now withdrawn from the collaboration, and the Galaxy Mk III and the S-Max (a seven-seater based on the Mondeo Mk IV platform) are built in Genk, Belgium, alongside the Mondeo. The AutoEuropa plant did produce the VW Scirocco III from 2008 to 2017.

Introduced in 2009, the SEAT Alhambra Ecomotive is fitted with the 2.0 TDI engine producing 159 g/km emissions.

In February 2013 SEAT presented the Alhambra four-wheel-drive version featuring a permanent all wheel drive combined with the 2.0 TDI diesel engine and a manual six-speed gearbox.

In September 2015 the UK diesel models of the Alhambra were revised to meet the Euro 6 standards and the power outputs increased from to and from to .

<text>The Philipps University of Marburg () is a public research university located in Marburg, Germany. It was founded in 1527 by Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, which makes it one of Germany&#x27;s oldest universities and the oldest still operating Protestant university in the world. It is now a public university of the state of Hesse, without religious affiliation. 

The University of Marburg has about 23,500 students and 7,500 employees and is located in Marburg, a town of 76,000 inhabitants, with university buildings dotted in or around the town centre. About 14% of the students are international, the highest percentage in Hesse. It offers an International summer university programme and offers student exchanges through the Erasmus programme.

==History==
In 1609, the University of Marburg established the world&#x27;s first professorship in chemistry. In 2012 it opened the first German interactive chemistry museum, called &quot;&quot;. Its experimental course programme is aimed at encouraging young people to pursue careers in science.
The university was among the first in Germany to offer courses in gender studies.

===Nazi period===

20 professors were expelled in 1933, among them economist Wilhelm Röpke, who emigrated, and linguist Hermann Jacobsohn, who committed suicide.

===After 1945===
Since the 1970s, the Department of Social Sciences has been regarded as a leftist stronghold, with Wolfgang Abendroth being a major influence within the field of political science in post-war Germany.

<text>The Palau Congressional Library was founded on August 18, 1981, and is housed at the Palau National Congress in Koror. As of 1996, it was headed by Congressional Librarian Harry Besebes. It has a 5,000 item collection, with annual additions of 350. The library employs 2 staff members, both professional librarians.

The collection highlights legislation passed by the Congress, journals of sessions deliberation, committee reports on legislation, and directories.

In the facility, Congressional Clerks index Palau&#x27;s parliamentary papers, and Legal Counsel staff perform their analysis and research. Members, parliamentary staff, and the public are all permitted to use the facilities.

The facilities were prompted by the Constitutional Government, newly installed on January 1, 1981.

According to a paper by Besebes on the library, prepared for the 62nd IFLA Conference, &quot;The Congress Library is organized as one of the Joint Programs under the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Delegates. All reports and other matters pertaining to the Congress Library have to be approved by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Delegates.&quot;

It is not a member of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions.

<doc id="499118" wikidata="Q7205999" url="?curid=499118" title="Pneumoencephalography">
<text>Pneumoencephalography (sometimes abbreviated PEG; also referred to as an &quot;air study&quot;) was a common medical procedure in which most of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was drained from around the brain by means of a lumbar puncture and replaced with air, oxygen, or helium to allow the structure of the brain to show up more clearly on an X-ray image. It was derived from ventriculography, an earlier and more primitive method in which the air is injected through holes drilled in the skull.

The procedure was introduced in 1919 by the American neurosurgeon Walter Dandy and was performed extensively until the late 1970s, when it was replaced by more-sophisticated and less-invasive modern neuroimaging techniques.

==Procedure==
Though pneumoencephalography was the single most important way of localizing brain lesions of its time, it was nevertheless extremely painful and generally not well tolerated by conscious patients. Pneumoencephalography was associated with a wide range of side effects, including headaches and severe vomiting, often lasting well past the procedure. During the study, the patient&#x27;s entire body would be rotated into different positions in order to allow air to displace the CSF in different areas of the ventricular system and around the brain. The patient would be strapped into an open-backed chair, which allowed the spinal needle to be inserted, and they would need to be secured well, for they would be turned upside down at times during the procedure and then somersaulted into a face-down position in a specific order to follow the air to different areas in the ventricles. This further added to the patient&#x27;s already heightened level of discomfort (if not anesthetized). A related procedure is pneumomyelography, in which gas is used similarly to investigate the spinal canal.

==Limitations==
Pneumoencephalography makes use of plain X-ray images. These are very poor at resolving soft tissues, such as the brain. Moreover, all the structures captured in the image are superimposed on top of each other, which makes it difficult to pick out individual items of interest (unlike modern scanners, which are able to produce fine virtual slices of the body, including of soft tissues). Therefore, pneumoencephalography did not usually image abnormalities directly; rather, their secondary effects. The overall structure of the brain contains crevices and cavities that are filled by the CSF. Both the brain and the CSF produce similar signals on an X-ray image. However, draining the CSF allows for greater contrast between the brain matter and the (now drained) crevices in and around it, which then show up as dark shadows on the X-ray image. The aim of pneumoencephalography is to outline these shadow-forming air-filled structures so that their shape and anatomical location can be examined. Following the procedure, an experienced radiologist reviews the X-ray films to see if the shape or location of these structures have been distorted or shifted by the presence of certain kinds of lesions. This also means that in order to show up on the images, lesions have to either be located right on the edge of the structures or if located elsewhere in the brain, be large enough to push on surrounding healthy tissues to an extent necessary to cause a distortion in the shape of the more distant air-filled cavities (and hence more-distant tumors detected this way tended to be fairly large).

Despite its overall usefulness, there were major portions of the brain and other structures of the head that pneumoencephalography was unable to image. This was partially compensated by increased use of angiography as a complementary diagnostic tool, often in an attempt to infer the condition of non-neurovascular pathology from its secondary vascular characteristics. This additional testing was not without risk, though, particularly due to the rudimentary catheterization techniques and deleterious radiocontrast agents of the day. Another drawback of pneumoencephalography was that the risk and discomfort it carried meant that repeat studies were generally avoided, thus making it difficult to assess disease progression over time.

==Current use==
Modern imaging techniques such as MRI and CT have rendered pneumoencephalography obsolete. Widespread clinical use of diagnostic tools using these newer technologies began in the mid-to-late 1970s. These revolutionized the field of neuroimaging by not only being able to non-invasively examine all parts of the brain and its surrounding tissues, but also by doing so in much greater detail than previously available with plain X-rays, therefore making it possible to directly visualize and precisely localize soft-tissue abnormalities inside the skull. This led to significantly improved patient outcomes while reducing discomfort. Today, pneumoencephalography is limited to the research field and is used under rare circumstances.

<doc id="499132" wikidata="Q1133035" url="?curid=499132" title="Hoosic River">
<text>The Hoosic River, also known as the Hoosac, the Hoosick (primarily in New York) and the Hoosuck (mostly archaic), is a tributary of the Hudson River in the northeastern United States. The different spellings are the result of varying transliterations of the river&#x27;s original Algonquian name. It can be translated either as &quot;the beyond place&quot; (as in beyond, or east of, the Hudson) or as &quot;the stony place&quot; (perhaps because the river&#x27;s stony bottom is usually exposed except in spring, or perhaps because local soils are so stony).

==Watershed==
The Hoosic River watershed is formed from tributaries originating in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts, the Green Mountains of Vermont, and the Taconic Mountains. The main (South) Branch of the river begins on the west slope of North Mountain and almost immediately fills the man-made Cheshire Reservoir in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. From there, the river flows north, west, and northwest, through the towns of Cheshire and Adams, the city of North Adams, and the town of Williamstown. It then travels through Pownal in the southwest corner of Vermont, after which it enters Rensselaer County, New York. There, it flows through the towns of Petersburgh and Hoosick, where it passes over a hydroelectric power dam in the village of Hoosick Falls. (There are also dams in Johnsonville, Valley Falls, and Schaghticoke.) The river provides the northwest border of the town of Pittstown, then flows through the town of Schaghticoke with its villages of Valley Falls and Schaghticoke before it terminates at its confluence with the Hudson above the city of Troy.

==Tributaries==

* North Branch Hoosic River
* Green River
* Little Hoosick River
* Walloomsac River - Native American name, also Wal-loom-sac
* Owl Kill 
* Wampecack Creek - Native American name, also Po-quam-pa-cak

<text>Dame Alison Fettes Richard, (born 1 March 1948) is an English anthropologist, conservationist and university administrator. She was the 344th Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, the third Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge since the post became full-time, and the second woman. Before arriving at Cambridge, she served as the provost of Yale University from 1994 to 2002.

==Early life==
Alison Richard was born in Kent. She attended the Queenswood School and was an undergraduate in Anthropology at Newnham College, Cambridge, before gaining a PhD from King&#x27;s College London in 1973 with a thesis titled &quot;Social organization and ecology of propithecus verreaux grandidier&quot;.

==Research and teaching==
In 1972, she moved to Yale University where she taught and continued her research on the ecology and social behavior of wild primates in Central America, West Africa, the Himalayan foothills of Pakistan, and the southern forests of Madagascar. She was named Professor of Anthropology in 1986 and chaired the Department of Anthropology at Yale from 1986 to 1990. From 1991 to 1994 she was the Director of Yale&#x27;s Peabody Museum of Natural History, which houses one of the world&#x27;s most important university natural history collections. In 1998 she was named the Franklin Muzzy Crosby Professor of the Human Environment.

Richard is best known for her studies of the sifaka (&quot;Propithecus verreauxi&quot;), a lemur of southern and western Madagascar. With collaborators and students, she led a program of field observation, capture and release, anatomical measurement, and genetic and hormone sampling, of more than 700 individually known sifaka from 1984 to the present. This is one of the largest primate populations continuously observed for such a long period. The research has yielded valuable insights into sifaka life-histories, demography, social behavior, and genetics. These, in turn, expand the understanding of the variation in the lives and biology of the members of the primate order. the Schwartz Foundation,

In 2022 she published The Sloth Lemur&#x27;s Song.

==University administration==
From 1994 until 2002, she was Provost of Yale University with operational responsibility for the university&#x27;s financial and academic programs and planning. From 2003 to 2010, Richard was the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. During her tenure, she led several major changes in university policy, ranging from intellectual property to undergraduate financial aid, re-organized management of the university&#x27;s endowment, and expanded Cambridge&#x27;s global partnerships, most notably in the US, China, India, Singapore, and the Persian Gulf. She launched and completed a billion-pound fund-raising campaign, the largest ever for a UK university.

==Conservation==
In the 1970s, in collaboration with RW Sussman (Washington University in St. Louis) and G Ramanantsoa (University of Madagascar), she helped establish a nature reserve at Beza-Mahafaly, southwest Madagascar, which was formally incorporated into the Madagascar Nature Reserve system in 1986.

For more than three decades, she has worked with colleagues to help conserve the reserve&#x27;s unique natural heritage, sponsor training and research by students from Madagascar and elsewhere, and to enhance socio-economic opportunities for people living in and around the forest. Over the years, these conservation efforts have been funded by the Liz Claiborne Art Ortenberg Foundation, WWF, the Schwartz Foundation, and USAID.

==Advisory boards==
Richard is currently a member of the Boards of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and of WWF International. She serves as an advisor to the Liz Claiborne/Art Ortenberg Foundation, Arcadia Fund, and to the Cambridge Conservation Initiative.

<doc id="499147" wikidata="Q1215931" url="?curid=499147" title="Blackboard Jungle">
<text>Blackboard Jungle is a 1955 American social drama film about an English teacher in an interracial inner-city school, based on the 1954 novel &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot; by Evan Hunter and adapted for the screen and directed by Richard Brooks. It is remembered for its innovative use of rock and roll in its soundtrack, for casting grown adults as high school teens, and for the unique breakout role of a black cast member, Sidney Poitier, as a rebellious yet musically talented student.

In 2016, &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In the mid-1950s, Richard Dadier is a new teacher at North Manual Trades High School, an inner-city school of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Led by student Gregory Miller, most engage in anti-social behavior. The school principal, Mr. Warneke, denies there are discipline issues, but the school faculty, particularly Mr. Murdock, warn Dadier otherwise. Dadier befriends two other new teachers, Joshua Edwards and Lois Hammond.

Dadier&#x27;s class includes Miller and Artie West, a rebellious bully and gang leader. The class shows no respect for Dadier. Dadier encourages Miller to lead the class in the right direction. After Dadier subdues a student who attacks Miss Hammond, the class gives Dadier the silent treatment and are even more uncooperative. Dadier and Edwards are mugged by West&#x27;s gang.

Reluctant to quit, Dadier seeks advice from his former teacher, Professor Kraal, the principal of an academically superior school with disciplined students. Kraal offers Dadier a job, but he declines. After chastising his class for calling each other racially divisive names, Dadier is himself falsely accused by Mr. Warneke of using racial epithets in the classroom. West encounters Dadier during his gang&#x27;s robbery of a newspaper truck. West tells Dadier his classroom is on the streets and to leave him alone. Several students, led by West, assault Edwards in his classroom and destroy his music record collection.

Dadier&#x27;s wife, Anne, who is pregnant, begins receiving anonymous letters and phone calls telling her Dadier and Miss Hammond are having an affair. Dadier discovers Miller can play piano and sing, and wonders why Miller can show such talent but also be so rebellious. Dadier shows his class an animated film about &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; which sparks discussion about moral choices. Anne goes into premature labor caused by the stress of the phone calls about Dadier&#x27;s alleged affair. When a neighbor shows Dadier the anonymous letters, he angrily decides to quit. Mr. Murdock encourages him to stay, telling Dadier he is making progress and has inspired him too. Anne apologizes for doubting Dadier&#x27;s fidelity and says she was wrong for telling him to quit. Their premature baby boy, though weak, eventually thrives.

When Dadier observes West openly copying from another student, he demands that West bring his paper to the front to have it docked five points. West rebuffs his repeated request, but Dadier is unrelenting. The conflict quickly escalates, and West pulls out a switchblade. Dadier does not back down. Miller stops West&#x27;s sidekick and classmate Belazi from jumping Dadier from behind. The rest of West&#x27;s gang fails to assist.

Dadier accuses West of the false allegations made to both Mr. Warneke and Anne. Dadier subdues West, and the other students join in to subdue Belazi, who has picked up the knife to escape. Miller then leads the class in helping Dadier take West and Belazi to the principal&#x27;s office. In the final scene, Miller and Dadier ask if the other is quitting at the end of the school year. Miller says no, because the two of them had a pact that neither would quit if the other stayed. Dadier&#x27;s expression makes clear he has no intention of breaking the agreement.

==Cast==
Cast notes:
* This was the debut film for Campos, Morrow, and Farah, and one of Poitier&#x27;s earliest. Farah later changed his name to Jamie Farr, best known for playing Corporal Maxwell Q. Klinger in the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; TV series.

== Factual background ==
Hunter&#x27;s novel was based on his early job as a teacher at Bronx Vocational High School, now known as Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School in the South Bronx. Hunter, then known as Salvatore Lombino, took the teaching job in 1950 after graduating from Hunter College. He was quickly disillusioned and quit in frustration after two months.

==Critical reception==
===Positive reviews===

In a positive review, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: 

&quot;Variety&quot; called it: &quot;...a film with a melodramatic impact that hits hard at a contemporary problem. The casting, too, is exceptionally good.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called the film: &quot;...a stark, powerful melodrama, sordid, tense, and disturbing. The picture no doubt will stir up considerable controversy, but at the same time it probably will prove to be a top box-office grosser.&quot;

John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote: 

===Negative reviews===
Not all reviews were positive. Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; slammed the film as &quot;so sensationalized as to negate any laudable purpose its supporters claim&quot;, further explaining: 

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; delivered a mixed to negative assessment: 

===Popular culture===
The song &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was included in the film, making the recording an anthem for rebellious 1950s youth. It was Number 1 on the pop charts for two months and went to Number 3 on the R&amp;B chart.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a &quot;fresh&quot; rating of 76%. On their best of Sidney Poitier list, it says: 

==Box office==
According to MGM records the film earned $5,292,000 in the US and Canada and $2,852,000 elsewhere.

==Awards and nominations==
In 2010, Turner Classic Movies (TCM) listed the soundtrack of the movie on its list of the Top 15 Most Influential Movie Soundtracks of all time. TCM described the impact and the influence of the movie:

==Cultural impact==
The film marked the rock and roll revolution by featuring Bill Haley &amp; His Comets&#x27; &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, initially a B-side, over the film&#x27;s opening credits (with a lengthy drum solo introduction, unlike the originally released single), as well as in the first scene, in an instrumental version in the middle of the film, and at the close of the movie, establishing that song as an instant hit. The record had been released the previous year, gaining only limited sales. But, popularized by its use in the film, &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and remained there for eight weeks. In some theaters, when the film was in the first release, the song was not heard at all at the beginning of the film because rock and roll was considered a bad influence. Despite this, other instances of the song were not cut.

The music led to a large teenage audience for the film, and their exuberant response to it sometimes overflowed into violence and vandalism at screenings. In this sense, the film has been seen as marking the start of a period of visible teenage rebellion in the latter half of the 20th century. The film was banned in Memphis, Tennessee and Atlanta, Georgia, with the Atlanta Review Board claiming that it was &quot;immoral, obscene, licentious and will adversely affect the peace, health, morals and good order of the city&quot;.

The film marked a watershed in the United Kingdom and was originally refused a cinema certificate before being passed with heavy cuts. When shown at a south London cinema in Elephant and Castle in 1956 the teenage Teddy Boy audience began to riot, tearing up seats and dancing in the aisles. After that, riots took place around the country wherever the film was shown.

The 1982 crime action thriller film &quot;Class of 1984&quot; serves as a loose remake of &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot;, with Perry King, Timothy Van Patten and Michael J. Fox in the roles of Glenn Ford, Vic Morrow, and Sidney Poitier, respectively.

In 2007, the &quot;Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture&quot; published an article that analyzed the film&#x27;s connection to crime theories and juvenile delinquency.

In 2015, the &quot;Journal of Transnational American Studies&quot; published a study with a focus on the film&#x27;s reception in West Germany and Japan.

The influential Jamaican reggae album &quot;Blackboard Jungle Dub&quot; (1973) by &quot;The Upsetters&quot; references the film&#x27;s title.

The film touches on the still-current issue of teacher pay. The dialog states that in 1955, the pay for teachers was US$2.00 an hour (), or about US$4,000 a year salary (), as compared with congressmen and judges at US$9.25 (), policemen and firemen at US$2.75 (), carpenters at US$2.81 (), plumbers at US$2.97 (), and plasterers at US$3.21 an hour ().

In March 2005, the 50th anniversary of the release of the film, which had influenced the subsequent upsurge in the general popularity of rock and roll, was marked by a series of &quot;Rock Is Fifty&quot; celebrations in Los Angeles and New York City, involving the surviving members of the original Bill Haley &amp; His Comets.

In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD in North America on May 10, 2005, by Warner Home Video.

<text>Samuel Standidge Boden (born 4 May 1826 in East Retford, Nottinghamshire; d. 13 January 1882 in Bedford Square, London) was an English professional chess master.

The mating pattern &quot;Boden&#x27;s Mate&quot; was named after the mate that occurred in one of his games, Schulder–Boden, London 1853. However, the mate was known previously from the game Horwitz–Popert, Hamburg 1844. There is also a line in the Philidor Defence named after him, based on one of his games against Paul Morphy. 

Morphy was of the opinion that Boden was the strongest English master, even though Barnes had a better record against him than Boden.

He was the author of &quot;A Popular Introduction to the Study and Practice of Chess&quot;, published anonymously in 1851.

<doc id="499172" wikidata="Q7736096" url="?curid=499172" title="The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection">
<text>The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection is a book by Ronald Fisher which combines Mendelian genetics with Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection, with Fisher being the first to argue that &quot;Mendelism therefore validates Darwinism&quot; and stating with regard to mutations that &quot;The vast majority of large mutations are deleterious; small mutations are both far more frequent and more likely to be useful&quot;, thus refuting orthogenesis. First published in 1930 by The Clarendon Press, it is one of the most important books of the modern synthesis, and helped define population genetics. It had been described by J. F. Crow as the &quot;deepest book on evolution since Darwin&quot;.

It is commonly cited in biology books, outlining many concepts that are still considered important such as Fisherian runaway, Fisher&#x27;s principle, reproductive value, Fisher&#x27;s fundamental theorem of natural selection, Fisher&#x27;s geometric model, the sexy son hypothesis, mimicry and the evolution of dominance. It was dictated to his wife in the evenings as he worked at Rothamsted Research in the day.

==Contents==

In the preface, Fisher considers some general points, including that there must be an understanding of natural selection distinct from that of evolution, and that the then-recent advances in the field of genetics (see history of genetics) now allowed this. In the first chapter, Fisher considers the nature of inheritance, rejecting blending inheritance, because it would eliminate genetic variance, in favour of particulate inheritance. The second chapter introduces Fisher&#x27;s fundamental theorem of natural selection. The third considers the evolution of dominance, which Fisher believed was strongly influenced by modifiers. Other chapters discuss parental investment, Fisher&#x27;s geometric model, concerning how spontaneous mutations affect biological fitness, Fisher&#x27;s principle which explains why the sex ratio between males and females is almost always 1:1, reproductive value, examining the demography of having girl children. Using his knowledge of statistics, the Fisherian runaway, which explores how sexual selection can lead to a positive feedback runaway loop, producing features such as the peacock&#x27;s plumage. He also wrote about the evolution of dominance, which explores genetic dominance.

=== Eugenics ===
The last five chapters (8-12) include Fisher&#x27;s concern about dysgenics and proposals for eugenics. Fisher attributed the fall of civilizations to the fertility of their upper classes being diminished, and used British 1911 census data to show an inverse relationship between fertility and social class, partly due, he claimed, to the lower financial costs and hence increasing social status of families with fewer children. He proposed the abolition of extra allowances to large families, with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father. He served in several official committees to promote eugenics. In 1934, he resigned from the Eugenics Society over a dispute about increasing the power of scientists within the movement.

==Editions==
A second, slightly revised edition was republished in 1958. In 1999, a third variorum edition (), with the original 1930 text, annotated with the 1958 alterations, notes and alterations accidentally omitted from the second edition was published, edited by professor John Henry Bennett of the University of Adelaide.

==Dedication==
The book is dedicated to Major Leonard Darwin, Fisher&#x27;s friend, correspondent and son of Charles Darwin, &quot;In gratitude for the encouragement, given to the author, during the last fifteen years, by discussing many of the problems dealt with in this book.&quot;

==Reviews==
The book was reviewed by Charles Galton Darwin, who sent Fisher his copy of the book, with notes in the margin, starting a correspondence which lasted several years. The book also had a major influence on W. D. Hamilton&#x27;s theories on the genetic basis of kin selection.

John Henry Bennett gave an account of the writing and reception of the book.

Sewall Wright, who had many disagreements with Fisher, reviewed the book and wrote that it was &quot;certain to take rank as one of the major contributions to the theory of evolution.&quot; J. B. S. Haldane described it as &quot;brilliant.&quot; Reginald Punnett was negative, however.

The book was largely overlooked for 40 years, and in particular Fisher&#x27;s fundamental theorem of natural selection was misunderstood. The work had a great effect on W. D. Hamilton, who discovered it as an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge and noted in these excerpts from the rear cover of the 1999 variorum edition:

The publication of the variorum edition in 1999 led to renewed interest in the work and reviews by Laurence Cook, Brian Charlesworth, James F. Crow, and A. W. F. Edwards.

<doc id="499180" wikidata="Q353438" url="?curid=499180" title="Tullio Levi-Civita">
<text>Tullio Levi-Civita, (; ; 29 March 1873 – 29 December 1941) was an Italian mathematician, most famous for his work on absolute differential calculus (tensor calculus) and its applications to the theory of relativity, but who also made significant contributions in other areas. He was a pupil of Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, the inventor of tensor calculus. His work included foundational papers in both pure and applied mathematics, celestial mechanics (notably on the three-body problem), analytic mechanics (the Levi-Civita separability conditions in the Hamilton–Jacobi equation) and hydrodynamics.

==Biography==

Born into an Italian Jewish family in Padua, Levi-Civita was the son of Giacomo Levi-Civita, a lawyer and former senator. He graduated in 1892 from the University of Padua Faculty of Mathematics. In 1894 he earned a teaching diploma after which he was appointed to the Faculty of Science teacher&#x27;s college in Pavia. In 1898 he was appointed to the Padua Chair of Rational Mechanics (left uncovered by death of Ernesto Padova) where he met and, in 1914, married Libera Trevisani, one of his pupils. He remained in his position at Padua until 1918, when he was appointed to the Chair of Higher Analysis at the University of Rome; in another two years he was appointed to the Chair of Mechanics there.

In 1900 he and Ricci-Curbastro published the theory of tensors in &quot;Méthodes de calcul différentiel absolu et leurs applications&quot;, which Albert Einstein used as a resource to master the tensor calculus, a critical tool in the development of the theory of general relativity. In 1917 he introduced the notion of parallel transport in Riemannian geometry, motivated by the will to simplify the computation of the curvature of a Riemannian manifold. Levi-Civita&#x27;s series of papers on the problem of a static gravitational field were also discussed in his 1915–1917 correspondence with Einstein. The correspondence was initiated by Levi-Civita, as he found mathematical errors in Einstein&#x27;s use of tensor calculus to explain the theory of relativity. Levi-Civita methodically kept all of Einstein&#x27;s replies to him; and even though Einstein had not kept Levi-Civita&#x27;s, the entire correspondence could be re-constructed from Levi-Civita&#x27;s archive. It is evident from this that, after numerous letters, the two men had grown to respect each other. In one of the letters, regarding Levi-Civita&#x27;s new work, Einstein wrote &quot;I admire the elegance of your method of computation; it must be nice to ride through these fields upon the horse of true mathematics while the like of us have to make our way laboriously on foot&quot;. In 1933 Levi-Civita contributed to Paul Dirac&#x27;s equations in quantum mechanics as well.

His textbook on tensor calculus, &quot;The Absolute Differential Calculus&quot; (originally a set of lecture notes in Italian co-authored with Ricci-Curbastro), remains one of the standard texts almost a century after its first publication, with several translations available.

In 1936, receiving an invitation from Einstein, Levi-Civita traveled to Princeton, United States and lived there with him for a year. But when the risk of war in Europe again rose, he returned to Italy. The 1938 race laws enacted by the Italian Fascist government deprived Levi-Civita of his professorship and of his membership of all scientific societies. Isolated from the scientific world, he died in his apartment in Rome in 1941.

Among his PhD students were Octav Onicescu, Attilio Palatini, Giovanni Lampariello and Gheorghe Vrânceanu.

Later on, when asked what he liked best about Italy, Einstein said &quot;spaghetti and Levi-Civita&quot;.

==Other studies and honors==
Analytical dynamics was another aspect of Levi-Civita&#x27;s studies: many of his articles examine the three-body problem. He wrote articles on hydrodynamics and on systems of differential equations. He is credited with improvements to the Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem, on which he wrote a book in 1931. In 1933, he contributed to work on the Dirac equation. He developed the Levi-Civita field, a system of numbers that includes infinitesimal quantities.

Levi-Civita was elected an international honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1917. The Royal Society awarded him the Sylvester Medal in 1922 and elected him as a foreign member in 1930. He became an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society, of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, following his participation in their colloquium in 1930 at the University of St Andrews. He was also a member of the Accademia dei Lincei, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

==Works==
All his mathematical works, except for the monographs, treatises and textbooks, were posthumously gathered in the six volumes of his &quot;Collected works&quot;, in a revised typographical form amending both typographical errors and author&#x27;s oversights.

<doc id="499184" wikidata="Q1351701" url="?curid=499184" title="Sultan Khan (chess player)">
<text>Sultan Khan (Punjabi and , 1903 – 25 April 1966; often given the erroneous honorific &quot;Mir Sultan Khan&quot; or &quot;Mir Malik Sultan Khan&quot;) was a chess player from British India, and later a citizen of Pakistan, who was the strongest Asian player of the early 1930s. The son of a Muslim landlord and preacher, Khan travelled with Colonel Nawab Sir Umar Hayat Khan (&quot;Sir Umar&quot;), to Britain, where he took the chess world by storm. In an international chess career of less than five years (1929–33), he won the British Championship three times in four attempts (1929, 1932, 1933), and had tournament and match results that placed him among the top ten players in the world. Sir Umar then brought him back to his homeland, where he gave up chess and returned to cultivate his ancestral farmlands in the area which became Pakistan. He lived there before dying in his sixties in the city of Sargodha. David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld have called him &quot;perhaps the greatest natural player of modern times&quot;. In 2024 FIDE posthumously awarded him the title of Honorary Grandmaster.

==Chess career==

Sultan Khan was born in 1903 in Mitha Tiwana, Khushab, Sargodha (then British India, today Pakistan), to a Muslim Awan family of pirs and landlords. He learned Indian chess from his father at the age of nine. By the time he was 21 he was considered the strongest player in Punjab. At that time, Sir Umar took him into his household with the idea of teaching him the European version of the game and introducing him to European master chess. In 1928, he won the all-India championship, scoring eight wins, one draw, and no losses.

In the spring of 1929, Sir Umar took him to London, where a training tournament was organized for his benefit. Due to his inexperience and lack of theoretical knowledge, he did poorly, tying for last place with H. G. Conde, behind William Winter and Frederick Yates. After the tournament, Winter and Yates trained with him to help prepare him for the British Chess Championship to be held that summer. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, he won. Soon afterwards, he went back to India with Sir Umar.

Returning to Europe in May 1930, Sultan Khan began an international chess career that included wins over many of the world&#x27;s leading players. His best results were second to Savielly Tartakower at Liège 1930; third at Hastings 1930–31 (+5−2=2) behind future World Champion Max Euwe and former World Champion José Raúl Capablanca; fourth at Hastings 1931–32; fourth at Bern 1932 (+10−3=2); and a tie for third with Isaac Kashdan at London 1932, behind World Champion Alexander Alekhine and Salo Flohr. Sultan Khan again won the British Championship in 1932 and 1933. In matches he narrowly defeated Tartakower in 1931 (+4−3=5) and narrowly lost to Flohr in 1932 (+1−2=3).

Sultan Khan thrice played first board for England at Chess Olympiads. At Hamburg 1930, there was still no rule that teams must put their best player on the top board, and some teams, unconvinced of his strength, matched their second or even third-best player against him. He scored nine wins, four draws, and four losses (64.7%). At Prague 1931, he faced a much stronger field. He had an outstanding result, scoring eight wins, seven draws, and two losses (67.6%). This included wins against Flohr and Akiba Rubinstein and draws with Alekhine, Kashdan, Ernst Grünfeld, Gideon Ståhlberg, and Efim Bogolyubov. At Folkestone 1933, he had his worst result, an even score, winning four games, drawing six, and losing four. Once again, his opponents included the world&#x27;s best players, such as Alekhine, Flohr, Kashdan, Tartakower, Grünfeld, Ståhlberg, and Lajos Steiner.

Reuben Fine wrote of him:
The story of the Indian Sultan Khan turned out to be a most unusual one. The &quot;Sultan&quot; was not the term of status that we supposed it to be; it was merely a first name. He spoke English poorly and kept score in Hindustani. It was said that he could not even read the European notations. 
After the tournament [the 1933 Folkestone Olympiad] the American team was invited to the home of Sultan Khan&#x27;s master in London. When we were ushered in we were greeted by the maharajah with the remark, &quot;It is an honor for you to be here; ordinarily I converse only with my greyhounds.&quot; Although he was a Mohammedan, the maharajah had been granted special permission to drink intoxicating beverages, and he made liberal use of this dispensation. He presented us with a four-page printed biography telling of his life and exploits; so far as we could see his greatest achievement was to have been born a maharajah. 

In December 1933, Sir Umar took him back to India. In 1935, he won a match against V. K. Khadilkar, yielding just one draw in ten games. The chess world never heard from him again.

==Later life==

Miss Fatima, also a servant of Sir Umar, had won the British Ladies Championship in 1933 by a remarkable three-point margin, scoring ten wins, one draw, and no losses. She said that Sultan Khan, upon his return to India, felt as though he had been freed from prison. In the damp English climate, he had been continually afflicted with malaria, colds, influenza, and throat infections, often arriving to play with his neck swathed in bandages. Sir Umar died in 1944. Sultan Khan lived for the rest of his life with his family in Sargodha. Ather Sultan, his eldest son, recalled that he would not coach his children at chess, telling them that they should do something more useful with their lives.

Sultan Khan died of tuberculosis in Sargodha, Pakistan (the same district where he had been born) on 25 April 1966. Sultan Khan&#x27;s son Ather Sultan is a graduate of the London School of Economics and retired as an Inspector General of Police from the Government of Pakistan. His granddaughter, Atiyab Sultan, holds a doctorate from the University of Cambridge. 

==Chess strength==

In his brief but meteoric career, Sultan Khan rose to the top of the chess world, playing on even terms with the world&#x27;s best players. By Arpad Elo&#x27;s calculation, his playing strength during his five-year peak was equivalent to an Elo rating of 2530.

In 1950, when FIDE first awarded the titles of International Grandmaster and International Master, Sultan Khan had not played for 15 years. However, FIDE made a practice of awarding titles to some long-retired players who had distinguished careers earlier in their lives, such as Rubinstein and Carlos Torre.

Hooper and Whyld write of him:
When Sultan Khan first travelled to Europe his English was so rudimentary that he needed an interpreter. Unable to read or write, he never studied any books on the game, and he was put into the hands of trainers who were also his rivals in play. He never mastered openings which, by nature empirical, cannot be learned by the application of common sense alone. Under these adverse circumstances, and having known international chess for a mere seven years, only half of which was spent in Europe, Sultan Khan nevertheless had few peers in the middlegame, was among the world&#x27;s best two or three endgame players, and one of the world&#x27;s best ten players. This achievement brought admiration from Capablanca who called him a genius, an accolade he rarely bestowed.

FIDE awarded the title of Honorary Grandmaster to Khan posthumously on February 2, 2024. FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich presented the award to Caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan Anwaar ul Haq Kakar.

==Notable games==

*Probably Sultan Khan&#x27;s most famous game is his win as White against Capablanca at Hastings 1930–31: 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.d4 b6 3.c4 Bb7 4.Nc3 e6 5.a3 d5 6.cxd5 exd5 7.Bg5 Be7 8.e3 0-0 9.Bd3 Ne4 10.Bf4 Nd7 11.Qc2 f5 12.Nb5 Bd6 13.Nxd6 cxd6 14.h4 Rc8 15.Qb3 Qe7 16.Nd2 Ndf6 17.Nxe4 fxe4 18.Be2 Rc6 19.g4 Rfc8 20.g5 Ne8 21.Bg4 Rc1+ 22.Kd2 R8c2+ 23.Qxc2 Rxc2+ 24.Kxc2 Qc7+ 25.Kd2 Qc4 26.Be2 Qb3 27.Rab1 Kf7 28.Rhc1 Ke7 29.Rc3 Qa4 30.b4 Qd7 31.Rbc1 a6 32.Rg1 Qa4 33.Rgc1 Qd7 34.h5 Kd8 35.R1c2 Qh3 36.Kc1 Qh4 37.Kb2 Qh3 38.Rc1 Qh4 39.R3c2 Qh3 40.a4 Qh4 41.Ka3 Qh3 42.Bg3 Qf5 43.Bh4 g6 44.h6 Qd7 45.b5 a5 46.Bg3 Qf5 47.Bf4 Qh3 48.Kb2 Qg2 49.Kb1 Qh3 50.Ka1 Qg2 51.Kb2 Qh3 52.Rg1 Bc8 53.Rc6 Qh4 54.Rgc1 Bg4 55.Bf1 Qh5 56.Re1 Qh1 57.Rec1 Qh5 58.Kc3 Qh4 59.Bg3 Qxg5 60.Kd2 Qh5 61.Rxb6 Ke7 62.Rb7+ Ke6 63.b6 Nf6 64.Bb5 Qh3 65.Rb8 Black .
*Sultan Khan won this crushing victory as Black against the Russo-Belgian player Victor Soultanbeieff at Liège 1930: 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 b6 3.c4 e6 4.g3 Bb7 5.Bg2 Bb4+ 6.Bd2 Bxd2+ 7.Nbxd2 0-0 8.0-0 c5 9.Qc2 Nc6 10.dxc5 bxc5 11.e4 Qc7 12.Rfe1 d6 13.Rac1 h6 14.a3 Nd7 15.Qc3 a5 16.Nh4 g5 17.Qe3 Qd8 18.Nhf3 Qe7 19.h3 Rab8 20.b3 Ba8 21.Nb1 Nde5 22.a4 Nxf3+ 23.Bxf3 Nd4 24.Bd1 f5 25.exf5 Rxf5 26.Rc3 Rbf8 27.Rf1 Rf3! 28.Bxf3 Rxf3 White resigned.
*In this game from Liège 1930, long-time American champion Frank Marshall (Black) tries to add to his long list of brilliancies, but Sultan Khan defends coolly. His biographer calls his play &quot;a wonderful example of &quot;sang-froid&quot; under pressure&quot;: 1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. Qxd4 Nc6 4. Qe3 Nf6 5. Nc3 Be7 Coles writes, &quot;Sultan has unwittingly chosen one of the more hazardous openings against a master with a record of brilliancies in open games, and as will be seen Marshall is psychologically unable to resist a try for a brilliancy against this inexperienced opponent.&quot; 6.

<text>Wolfgang Unzicker (26 June 1925 – 20 April 2006) was one of the strongest German chess Grandmasters from 1945 to about 1970.
He decided against making chess his profession, choosing law instead.
Unzicker was at times the world&#x27;s strongest amateur chess player, and World Champion Anatoly Karpov called him the &quot;world champion of amateurs&quot;.

==Biography==
Unzicker was born in Pirmasens, a small town near Kaiserslautern in the province of Rhineland-Palatinate noted for shoemaking.
His father taught him how to play chess at age 10. His brother, four years older, was also a chess player but was killed in World War II.
Unzicker began to play tournaments abroad in 1948 as Germany was struggling to rebuild after the war, and achieved the grandmaster title in 1954.
He won the German Championship six times from 1948 to 1963 and tied for first in 1965. From 1950 to 1978 Unzicker played in twelve Chess Olympiads, and was first board on ten of them. He played nearly 400 times representing Germany&#x27;s national team.
For many years he was legal advisor for the German Chess Association.

His tournament victories include the first place tie (+6−0=9) with Boris Spassky at the Chigorin Memorial in Sochi 1965, first at Maribor 1967 ahead of Samuel Reshevsky, first at Krems, and first at Amsterdam 1980 tied with Hans Ree. In 1950, Unzicker shared the prize for best top-board score (+9−1=4) with Miguel Najdorf for his performance on first board for the West German team at the Dubrovnik Chess Olympiad. At the Tel Aviv 1964 Chess Olympiad Unzicker scored 13.5 points playing first board for the West German team that won the bronze medal on the strength of a 3:1 team victory over the Soviet Union. Unzicker also shared fourth place (+2−1=15) with Lajos Portisch in the 1966 Piatigorsky Cup in Santa Monica, California. Only Boris Spassky, Bobby Fischer, and Bent Larsen finished ahead of Unzicker. Unzicker placed ahead of world champion Tigran Petrosian, Samuel Reshevsky, Miguel Najdorf, Borislav Ivkov, and Hein Donner. At Hastings 1969–70, Unzicker finished second (+4−0=5) after Lajos Portisch and ahead of Svetozar Gligorić and former world champion Vasily Smyslov. Unzicker finished second (+3−2=7) to Viktor Korchnoi at South Africa 1979. A retired judge, he was still playing chess as first board on the club team &quot;Tarrasch Munich&quot;.

Unzicker had a classical chess style modelled after the German player and theorist Siegbert Tarrasch. In 1956 he lost a match to Paul Keres in which both players chose to begin with the Ruy Lopez opening in all eight games.

In 2005, Unzicker celebrated his 80th birthday with his wife Freia, his three sons and their wives and three grandchildren, and a tournament with 
Karpov, Korchnoi and Spassky took place in his honor. Wolfgang Unzicker died on April 20, 2006, at the age of 80, during a holiday trip to Albufeira, Portugal.

<text>A.M.A.N., was a Greek television parody show and the natural continuation of another TV show called &quot;Comfuzio&quot; that was aired by ERT3 in the early 1990s. A.M.A.N began after the death of their friend and broadcaster Antonis Pararas and the capital letters translates the word &quot;Αντώνη Μας Άφησες Νωρίς&quot; which means &quot;Antonis you left us early&quot;. A.M.A.N. began in May 1997 at Mega Channel, but only 9 episodes were aired. Since October 1997 and up until 2000, the show was broadcast by ANT1 television. The hosts were Antonis Kanakis (Αντώνης Κανάκης) and Sotiris Kalivatsis (Σωτήρης Καλυβάτσης), with a variety of supporting players, most notable Giannis Servettas (Γιάννης Σερβέτας). Spin-offs of the show were the series &quot;[[A.M.A.N. Τα Καθάρματα]] (A.M.A.N The Bastards)&quot; (originally an unrelated show to A.M.A.N., but later mutated into a spin-off/continuation of &quot;A.M.A.N.&quot;), &quot;Oi Treis Files&quot;, &quot;Haivania 3-0&quot; and &quot;Giannis o omorfos&quot;.

<doc id="499195" wikidata="Q917817" url="?curid=499195" title="Alay Range">
<text>The Alay or Alai Range (; ) is a mountain range that extends from the Tien Shan mountain range in Kyrgyzstan west into Tajikistan. It is part of the Pamir-Alay mountain system. The range runs approximately east to west. Its highest summit is Pik Tandykul (), reaching 5544 m. It forms the southern border of the Fergana Valley, and in the south it falls steeply to the Alay Valley. The southern slopes of the range drain into the Kyzylsuu or Vakhsh River, a tributary of the Amu Darya. The streams that drain the northern slopes of the range are tributaries of the Syr Darya, and empty into the Fergana Valley to the north of the range. , , is also a well-known summit. European route E007: Tashkent – Kokand – Andijan – Osh – Irkeshtam crosses the range by the Taldyk Pass. The range is also traversed by Pamir highway.

Some imprecise sources seem to use the term for the whole southern curve of the Tian Shan corresponding to the southern border of Kyrgyzstan, to up north until the perpendicular extension known as Fergana Range, but strictly speaking the Alay Mountains are strictly north of Alay Valley, while confusingly, Trans-Alay Range of Pamir Mountains lies to the south of that valley, as well as Turkestan Range and Zarafshan Range at far southwest. Pamir-Alay is collective term for many systems above, but not including any of the Pamirs.

==Geology==

The Alay Range, based on its genetic type, is a horst-anticline formation that emerged during the Hercynian orogeny. In its western and central parts, tectonic faults run parallel to the mountain, while in the eastern section, they are oriented from south to north. The geological structure of the range is highly complex:
*The western and central sections consist of Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous deposits with a thickness ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. These include sandstone, siliceous and carbonaceous schists, gneiss, dolomite, siltstone, limestone, porphyry, tuff, diabase, polymictic, and limestone-based conglomerates.
*The eastern section features Jurassic formations up to 3,300 meters thick, consisting of conglomerates, gravelites, and argillites.

In some areas (such as the Kichi-Alay and Kaiyndy Mountains), these layers are intruded by granite, granodiorite, and syenite.

The foothills (including ridges and low mountains like Papan, Otuzadyr, and Katyrantoo) and the valley floors are covered with sedimentary rocks from the Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary periods, with thicknesses of up to 200 meters. These include clay, sand, marl, fine gravel, and moraine deposits.

The Alay Range contains deposits of mercury, antimony, iron, bauxite, tungsten, bismuth, polymetals, arsenic, coal, and other minerals, some of which hold industrial significance.

<text>An electric violin is a violin equipped with an electronic output of its sound. The term most properly refers to an instrument intentionally made to be electrified with built-in pickups, usually with a solid body. It can also refer to a violin fitted with an electric pickup of some type, although &quot;amplified violin&quot; or &quot;electro-acoustic violin&quot; are more accurate then.

==History==
Electrically amplified violins have been used in one form or another since the 1920s; jazz and blues artist Stuff Smith is generally credited as being one of the first performers to adapt pickups and amplifiers to violins. The Electro Stringed Instrument Corporation, National String Instrument Corporation and Vega Company sold electric violins in the 1930s and 1940s; Fender advertised an electric violin in 1958 (first production model pictured at the head of this page) but withdrew it at the point of production. After Fender was bought by CBS, the electric violin went into production in 1969 until 1975.

Barcus Berry have been producing electric violins since the mid-1960s and in the early 1970s Max Mathews began developing an electric violin which reached completion in 1984 During the 1980s more companies were formed producing their own brand of electric violin, such as RAAD or The Amazing Electric Violin and ZETA. There has been a great deal more commercial success for manufacturers of electric violins since the 1990s, both for well known, established companies and new independent makers too.

==Description==

Acoustic violins may be used with an add-on piezoelectric bridge or body pickup, or a magnetic pickup attached to the fingerboard end. Alternatively, an electrodynamic pickup can be installed under an acoustic violin&#x27;s fingerboard avoiding interference with any tone-producing parts of the violin, and therefore keeping its acoustic resonances and tone intact.
To avoid feedback from the resonances of the hollow body under high amplification on stage, many instruments have a solid body instead. The timbre (tone color) of a standard unamplified violin is due in large part to these resonances, but so depending on how the signal is picked up, an electric violin may have a &quot;rawer&quot; or &quot;sharper&quot; sound than an acoustic. This raw sound is often preferred in rock, pop and some avant-garde genres. Several &quot;semi-hollow&quot; designs exist, containing a sealed, but hollow resonating chamber that provides some approximation of acoustic violin sound while reducing susceptibility to feedback.

Solid-body electric violins typically have a non-traditional, minimalistic design to keep weight down. Lately, materials such as kevlar, glass and carbon fibres, are used in the build process.

They are often seen as &quot;experimental&quot; instruments, being less established than electric guitar or bass. Hence, there are many variations on the standard design, such as frets, extra strings, machine heads, &quot;baritone&quot; strings that sound an octave lower than normal, and sympathetic strings. Luthier Yuri Landman built a 12 string electric violin for the Belgian band DAAU. The strings on this instrument are clustered in four groups of three strings tuned unison creating a chorus. Also the instrument features an extra pickup in the tail piece for extra amplification of string resonances.

Acoustic 5-string violins are becoming more common, and it is not unusual for an electric violin to have 5, 6, 7 or more strings. The typical solid body also accommodates the extra tension caused by more strings without stressing the instrument too much. The extra strings are usually a low C string for 5-strings, a low C and low F for 6, and a low C, F and B for 7.

Electric violin signals usually pass through electronic processing, in the same way as an electric guitar, to achieve a desired sound. This could include delay, reverb, chorus, distortion, or other effects.

Today electric violins are even being used to reinvigorate music education. NBC, for example, recently featured a &quot;music camp that combines rock and orchestra&quot; by Mark Wood, who was chosen as the &quot;person of the day&quot; and featured on &quot;Today&quot; for bringing fresh interest to music education with rock performances all on electric violins where proceeds are donated back to school music programs. &quot;Today&quot; stated &quot;The perfect blend of classical instruments and rock and roll is giving kids across the country a whole new appreciation for music.&quot;

==Pickups==

Electric violins may use magnetic, piezoelectric, or electrodynamic pickups. Guitar/coil type magnetic pickups require the use of violin strings that have ferrous (iron-containing, as in steel) metal wraps or cores. A few single-coil guitar-style magnetic systems are available, The small body size and arced string arrangement of a violin limit the amount of space available for coil placement.
One unusual acoustic/electric violin system uses the string itself as a linear active pickup element. Made to fit standard acoustic violins, the only requisite is that the string is electrically conducting, so the common synthetic or steel core strings can be used.

Generally, piezoelectric pickups are inexpensive and more common. Piezo elements come in the shape of ceramic discs, cylinders or a plastic film. They detect physical vibrations directly, sometimes placed in or on the body, or in some cases actual string vibrations directly, but more commonly general bridge vibrations are sensed. Some piezo setups have a separate pickup (or two, or even four in the case of some Barbera Transducer Systems pickups) within the bridge under each string. A few systems use transducers oriented in various directions to differentiate between bowed and plucked string motion. Operating a switch then selects the preferred mode.

Piezo pickups have a high (capacitive) output impedance, and must be plugged into a high impedance input stage in the amplifier or a powered preamp (a charge amplifier is best). This buffers the signal to avoid low frequency loss and microphonic noise pickup in the instrument cable. Preamplification is often done by an external signal processor, but some electric violin body designs provide internal housing for preamp circuitry.

==Amplification==
Essentially, amplifying an electric violin is exactly the same as amplifying a guitar. They both produce an audio output which is transferred through an audio cable into an amp or PA. For this reason, there are few amps that are specifically for violin, and even those can be repurposed for guitar. Most electric violinists use standard guitar amplifiers. The advantage with using guitar amps is that they have been used for years and their sound is reliable, though not all guitar amps will give a desired tone. Some prefer the more mellow tone of tube amps over solid state amps and digital PA&#x27;s for violins. Similar to how electric guitar amplifiers are typically used for electric violins, guitar effect pedals, or effects units can be and are used for electric violins.
==Genres==


Although the violin is an instrument used extensively in classical music, electric violins are generally employed by classical performers only in the performance of contemporary classical music. The electric violin is more frequently used by non-classical musicians in popular genres such as metal, rock, hip hop, electronic music, pop, jazz/jazz fusion, country, new-age, and experimental music.

It is used extensively in folk rock; one prominent exponent in the area being Dave Swarbrick. Folk metal band Turisas also puts a lot of emphasis on the electric violin in their compositions. Finnish folk metal band Korpiklaani also focuses in Jaakko Lemmetty&#x27;s electric violin parts. It has also found its way into modern musical theater, a recent example being Whistle Down the Wind by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Several popular bands that use the electric violin are Zox, Operator Please, Doll Factory, and pop punk band Yellowcard. Urban Blitz of protopunk rock band Doctors of Madness used the instrument to original effect in the mid 1970s; also using baritone Violectra.

Artists such as Tracy Silverman and Daniel Bernard Roumain have popularized violin &quot;looping&quot;. Instead of playing strictly with a band or as a traditional soloist, these musicians use a loop pedal to layer sound and effectively become a one-man band. Using a variety of pedals and techniques on the violin, these musicians yield a wide array of sounds, allowing original compositions and arrangements for electric looping violin of popular rock and hip hop tunes.

Classically trained violinist Emilie Autumn has also made extensive use of the electric violin, particularly on her instrumental Laced/Unlaced album.

In Brazil, the Electric Violin appears in the work of Marcus Viana, like &quot;Sagrado Coração da Terra&quot; (Sacred Heart of Earth), a Symphonic Prog/Progressive Rock, and Transfonika Orkestra (soundtracks), besides many others.

Several Irish fiddlers have adopted electric instruments. The fiddle is quite prominently featured in such bands as the Celtic punk bands Flogging Molly, and The Levellers. Eileen Ivers played a blue Barcus-Berry electric fiddle during her tours with Riverdance during the 1990s, later switching to a custom-made blue ZETA Music Systems Strados acoustic-electric fiddle (which ZETA later marketed as the &quot;Eileen Ivers Signature Series&quot;).

Daiana Mazza is another violinist from Brazil. She appears in works of Rock, Brazilian Music, Brazilian Gospel, Jazz and Folk, like Braia, Kernunna, Carol Carolo, Os Minervas, Leonardo Araujo, Transfonika Orkestra, Sagrado Coração da Terra, etc.

==MIDI violin==
In the mid-1980s, Zeta Music developed a prototype violin for Laurie Anderson. Through a custom pickup and interface, it sends MIDI data, allowing the violin to control synthesizers. This design was later refined and turned into a commercial product. Unlike most pickup designs of the time, the Zeta pickup has the ability to output the signal from each string to a separate audio channel. Using a multi-pin cable to their pitch-to-MIDI converter, this allows for polyphonic MIDI control, and each string may be set to an independent MIDI channel.

In 2010, Keith McMillen, a founder of Zeta Music, announced the StringPort polyphonic string-to-USB 2.0 converter for the Zeta polyphonic pickup and other polyphonic pickup systems. While no other, dedicated, polyphonic, violin-to-MIDI systems are manufactured, there are a number of general, pitch-to-MIDI violin systems, and general pitch-to-MIDI computer accessories available today. General, monophonic pickup-to-MIDI systems, such as those manufactured by Roland and Yamaha have been available for decades, and may be adapted to standard, electric violins. Without polyphonic instrument output, these systems tend to be monophonic, allowing only monophonic operation—only one pitch can be detected and digitised at a time— but through the use of proprietary pickups, some MIDI polyphony can be achieved. Some pitch to MIDI interfaces from Axon/TerraTec will give full per-string polyphony, interfacing with multi-pin output from Zeta MIDI pickup.

Notable artists who have performed using a MIDI-enabled violin include L. Subramaniam, Jean-Luc Ponty, Charles Bisharat, Drew Tretick, Gregory Docenko, Dorothy Martirano and Boyd Tinsley from Dave Matthews Band.

<doc id="499210" wikidata="Q161135" url="?curid=499210" title="Savielly Tartakower">
<text>Savielly Tartakower (also known as &quot;Xavier&quot; or &quot;Ksawery&quot; &quot;Tartakower&quot;, less often &quot;Tartacover&quot; or &quot;Tartakover&quot;; 21 February 1887 – 4 February 1956) was a Polish chess player. He was awarded the title of International Grandmaster in its inaugural year, 1950. Tartakower was also a leading chess journalist and author of the 1920s and 1930s and is noted for his many witticisms.

==Early career==
Tartakower was born on 9 (21) February 1887 in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, to Austrian citizens of Jewish origin and circumcised on February 16 (28). His parents were killed in a pogrom in Rostov-on-Don in 1911. Tartakower stayed mainly in Austria. He graduated from the law faculties of universities in Geneva and Vienna. He spoke German and French. During his studies he became interested in chess and started attending chess meetings in various cafés for chess players in Vienna. He met many notable masters of the time, among them Carl Schlechter, Géza Maróczy (against whom he played what was probably his most famous ), Milan Vidmar, and Richard Réti. His first achievement was first place in a tournament in Nuremberg in 1906. Three years later he achieved second place in the tournament in Vienna, losing only to Réti.

During World War I Tartakower was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army and served as a staff officer on various posts. He went to the Russian front with the Viennese infantry house-regiment. After the war he emigrated to France, and settled in Paris. Although Tartakower did not speak Polish, after Poland regained its independence in 1918 he accepted Polish citizenship and became one of the country&#x27;s most prominent honorary ambassadors. He was the captain and trainer of the Polish chess team in six international tournaments, winning a gold medal for Poland at the Hamburg Olympiad in 1930.

==Chess professional==

In France, Tartakower decided to become a professional chess player. He also started cooperating with various chess magazines, and wrote several books and brochures on chess. The most famous of these, &quot;Die Hypermoderne Schachpartie&quot; (&quot;The Hypermodern Chess Game&quot;) was published in 1924 and has been issued in almost 100 editions since. Tartakower took part in many of the most important chess tournaments of his day. In 1927 and 1928 he won two tournaments in Hastings and shared first place with Aron Nimzowitsch in London. On the latter occasion, he defeated such notable players as Frank Marshall, Milan Vidmar, and Efim Bogoljubov. In 1930 he won the Liège tournament, beating Mir Sultan Khan by two points. Further down the list were, among others, Akiba Rubinstein, Nimzowitsch, and Marshall.

Tartakower won the Polish Chess Championship twice, at Warsaw 1935 and Jurata 1937. In the 1930s he represented Poland in six Chess Olympiads, and France in 1950, winning three individual medals (gold in 1931 and bronze in 1933 and 1935), as well as five team medals (gold in 1930, two silver in 1931 and 1939, and two bronze in 1935 and 1937).

* In 1930, at second board at the 3rd Chess Olympiad in Hamburg (+9−1=6);
* In 1931, at second board at the 4th Chess Olympiad in Prague (+10−1=7);
* In 1933, at first board at the 5th Chess Olympiad in Folkestone (+6−2=6);
* In 1935, at first board at the 6th Chess Olympiad in Warsaw (+6−0=11);
* In 1937, at first board at the 7th Chess Olympiad in Stockholm (+1−2=10);
* In 1939, at first board at the 8th Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires (+7−3=7);
* In 1950, at first board at the 9th Chess Olympiad in Dubrovnik (+5−5=5).
In 1935 he was one of the main organizers of the Chess Olympiad in Warsaw.

In 1939, the outbreak of World War II found him in Buenos Aires, where he was playing the 8th Chess Olympiad, representing Poland on a team which included Miguel Najdorf, who always called Tartakower &quot;my teacher&quot;.

==Final years==
After a short stay in Argentina Tartakower returned to Europe. He arrived in France shortly before its collapse in 1940. Under the pseudonym &quot;Cartier&quot;, he joined the forces of general Charles de Gaulle.

After World War II and the Soviet takeover of Poland, Tartakower became a French citizen. He played in the first Interzonal tournament at Saltsjöbaden 1948, but did not qualify for the Candidates tournament. He represented France at the 1950 Chess Olympiad. FIDE instituted the title of International Grandmaster in 1950; Tartakower was in the first group of players to receive it. In 1953, he won the French Chess Championship in Paris.

He died on 4 February 1956 in Paris, 18 days before his 69th birthday.

==Personality and chess contributions==
Tartakower is regarded as one of the most notable chess personalities of his time. Harry Golombek translated Tartakower&#x27;s book of his best games, and in the foreword wrote: Dr. Tartakower is far and away the most cultured and the wittiest of all the chess masters I have ever met. His extremely well stored mind and ever-flowing native wit make conversation with him a perpetual delight. So much so that I count it as one of the brightest attractions an international tournament can hold out for me that Dr. Tartakower should also be one of the participants. His talk and thought are rather like a modernized blend of Baruch Spinoza and Voltaire; and with it all a dash of paradoxical originality that is essential Tartakower.

A talented chess player, Tartakower is also known for his countless aphorisms, sometimes called &quot;Tartakoverisms&quot;. One variation of the Dutch Defence is named after him. The Tartakower Defence in the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined (also known as the Tartakower–Makogonov–Bondarevsky System) also bears his name, as does the most common variation of the Torre Attack. He is alleged to be the inventor of the Orangutan Opening, 1.b4, so named after Tartakower had admired a great ape during his visit to the zoo whilst playing in the great 1924 tournament in New York. Tartakower originated the Catalan Opening at Barcelona 1929. This system starts with 1.d4 d5 2.c4 Nf6 3.g3. It remains very popular today at all levels. Also, a very solid variation in the Caro–Kann Defence, which starts with 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Nxf6+ exf6 is named after Tartakower.

José Raúl Capablanca scored +5−0=7 against Tartakower, but they had many hard fights. After their fighting draw in London 1922 (where Tartakower played his new defense), Capablanca said, &quot;You are lacking in solidity&quot;, and Tartakower replied in his usual banter, &quot;That is my saving grace.&quot; But in Capablanca&#x27;s reports of the 1939 Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires for the Argentine newspaper &quot;Crítica&quot;, he wrote: The Polish team … is captained and led by Dr S. Tartakower, a master with profound knowledge and great imagination, qualities which make him a formidable adversary.  … Luckily for the others, the Polish team has only one Tartakower.

Sugden and Damsky stated that like other chess players of all ages and ranks among whom there is generally no lack of idiosyncrasy or superstition, Tartakower, a trenchant wit, took a most unsightly old hat with him from tournament to tournament. He would only wear it on the last round and he would win. Notably this hat did not guarantee him success in casinos, which he visited as though it were a job of work. The roulette table would regularly acquire both the Grandmaster&#x27;s prizes and the numerous fees from his endless string of articles.

==Quotations==

Several chess witticisms are attributed to Tartakower:

*&quot;It&#x27;s always better to sacrifice your opponent&#x27;s men.&quot;
* &quot;An isolated pawn spreads gloom all over the chessboard.&quot;
* &quot;The blunders are all there on the board, waiting to be made.&quot;
* &quot;The winner of the game is the player who makes the next-to-last mistake.&quot;
* &quot;The move is there, but you must see it.&quot; 
* &quot;No game was ever won by resigning.&quot;
* &quot;I never defeated a healthy opponent.&quot; (This refers to players who blame an illness, sometimes imaginary, for their loss.)
* &quot;Tactics is what you do when there is something to do; strategy is what you do when there is nothing to do.&quot;
* &quot;Moral victories do not count.&quot;
* &quot;Chess is a fairy tale of 1001 blunders.&quot;
* &quot;The great master places a knight on e5; checkmate follows by itself.&quot;
* &quot;A master can sometimes play badly, a fan never!&quot;
* &quot;A match demonstrates less than a tournament. But a tournament demonstrates nothing at all.&quot;
* &quot;Chess is a struggle against one&#x27;s own errors.&quot;
* &quot;Every chessplayer should have a hobby.&quot;
* &quot;A game of chess has three phases: the opening, where you hope you stand better; the middlegame, where you think you stand better; and the ending, where you know you stand to lose.&quot;
* &quot;As long as an opening is reputed to be weak it can be played.&quot;
* &quot;Stalemate is the tragicomedy of chess.&quot;
* &quot;Erro, ergo sum.&quot;
* Talking about 1.Nf3 Réti Opening: &quot;An opening of the past, which became, towards 1923, the opening of the future.&quot;
* &quot;To avoid losing a piece, many a person has lost the game.&quot;
* &quot;A draw can be obtained normally by repeating three moves, but also by playing one bad move.&quot;
* &quot;Some part of a mistake is always correct.&quot;
* &quot;Whenever you have to make a rook move, and both rooks are available for said move, you should evaluate which rook to move and, once you have made up your mind, move the other one.&quot;
* &quot;The player that takes risks may lose, the player that doesn&#x27;t always loses.&quot;
* &quot;Everything was finely imagined; but the gods, before the endgame, put the middlegame.&quot;

<text>Daniel Harrwitz (22 February 1821 – 2 January 1884) was a German chess master.

Harrwitz was born in Breslau (Wrocław) in the Prussian Province of Silesia. Harrwitz&#x27;s correct birth and death dates (22 February 1821 and 2 January 1884 respectively) were established by Luca D&#x27;Ambrosio in Chess Notes item 6286. He established his reputation in Paris, particularly as a player of blindfold games. He lost a match in England to Howard Staunton in 1846 at odds of a pawn and two moves, and drew a match with Adolf Anderssen in Germany in 1848.

Harrwitz lived in England from 1849, and founded the &quot;British Chess Review&quot;. In 1856, he moved to Paris, where he won a match against Jules Arnous de Rivière. In 1858, he played a match against Paul Morphy in Paris. Harrwitz won the first two games, but lost the match 5½-2½. Harrwitz withdrew from the match, allegedly on grounds of ill health. He subsequently retired to the Austro-Hungarian county of Tyrol, dying in Bolzano in 1884.

==Game against Morphy==

Although he had a negative record against Morphy, he was one of a few masters who beat Morphy with the black pieces. Here is one of his wins in Paris in 1858:

:1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 exd4 4.Qxd4 Nc6 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.Bxc6 Bxc6 7.Bg5 Nf6 8.Nc3 Be7 9.0-0-0 0-0 10.Rhe1 h6 11.Bh4 Ne8 12.Bxe7 Qxe7 13.e5 Bxf3 14.gxf3 Qg5+ 15.Kb1 dxe5 16.Rxe5 Qg2 17.Nd5 Qxh2 18.R5e1 Qd6 19.Rg1 Kh7 20.Qe3 f5 21.Nf4 Qb6 22.Qe2 Rf7 23.Qc4 Qf6 24.Nh5 Qe7 25.Rde1 Qd7 26.a3 Nd6 27.Qd4 Rg8 28.Rg2 28. Rg2 and Black eventually won.

<doc id="499223" wikidata="Q548184" url="?curid=499223" title="Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro">
<text>Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro (; 12January 1925) was an Italian mathematician. He is most famous as the discoverer of tensor calculus.

With his former student Tullio Levi-Civita, he wrote his most famous single publication, a pioneering work on the calculus of tensors, signing it as Gregorio Ricci. This appears to be the only time that Ricci-Curbastro used the shortened form of his name in a publication, and continues to cause confusion.

Ricci-Curbastro also published important works in other fields, including a book on higher algebra and infinitesimal analysis, and papers on the theory of real numbers, an area in which he extended the research begun by Richard Dedekind.

==Early life and education==
Completing privately his high school studies at only 16 years of age, he enrolled on the course of philosophy-mathematics at Rome University (1869). The following year the Papal State fell and so Gregorio was called by his father to the city of his birth, Lugo di Romagna. Subsequently he attended courses at University of Bologna during the year 1872 - 1873, then transferred to the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa.

In 1875 he graduated in Pisa in physical sciences and mathematics with a thesis on differential equations, entitled &quot;On Fuches&#x27;s Research Concerning Linear Differential Equations&quot;. During his various travels he was a student
of the mathematicians Enrico Betti, Eugenio Beltrami, Ulisse Dini and Felix Klein.

==Studies on absolute differential calculus==
In 1877 Ricci-Curbastro obtained a scholarship at the Technical University of Munich, Bavaria, and he later worked as an assistant of 
Ulisse Dini, his teacher.

In 1880 he became a lecturer of mathematics at the University of Padua where he
dealt with Riemannian geometry and differential quadratic forms.

He formed a research group in which Tullio Levi-Civita worked, with whom he wrote
the fundamental treatise on absolute differential calculus (also known as Ricci
calculus) with coordinates or tensor calculus on Riemannian manifold, which then
became the lingua franca of the subsequent theory of Albert Einstein&#x27;s general relativity.
In fact absolute differential calculus had a crucial role in developing the theory,
as is shown in a letter written by Albert Einstein to Ricci-Curbastro&#x27;s nephew. In this context Ricci-Curbastro identified the so-called Ricci tensor which would have a crucial role within that theory.

=== Influences ===
The advent of tensor calculus in dynamics goes back to Lagrange, who originated the general treatment of a dynamical system, and to Riemann, who was the first to think about geometry in an arbitrary number of dimensions. He was also influenced by the works of Christoffel and of Lipschitz on the quadratic forms. In fact, it was essentially Christoffel&#x27;s idea of covariant differentiation that allowed Ricci-Curbastro to make the greatest progress.

==Recognition==
Ricci-Curbastro received many honours for his contributions.

He is honoured by mentions in various Academies amongst which are:
* The Veneto Institute of Science - Istituto veneto di scienze - letters and articles (from 1892), of which he was then president from 1916 to 1919.
*The Lincei Academy - Accademia dei Lincei - of which he was a member from 1899.
*The Academy of Padua - Accademia di Padova - from 1905.
*The Science Academy of Turin - Accademia delle Scienze di Torino - from 1918.
*The Galileian Academy of Science - Accademia Galileiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti - letters and articles, of which he was then president from 1920 to 1922.
*The Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna - Reale Accademia di Bologna - from 1922.
*The Pontifical Academy of Sciences - Accademia Pontificia delle Scienze - from 1925.

He participated actively in political life, both in his native town and in Padua, and contributed with his projects to the Ravenna-area land drainage and the Lugo aqueduct.

An asteroid, 13642 Ricci, is named after him.

<text>Skencil, formerly called Sketch, is a free software vector graphics editor, released under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

== History ==
Its first public version, &quot;Sketch 0.5.0&quot;, was released on October 31, 1998 by Bernhard Herzog.

Later Bernhard Reiter joined &quot;Sketch&quot; development.

On 7 February 2003, &quot;Sketch 0.7.12&quot; development release was rolled out. It was the last under name &quot;Sketch&quot;.

=== Renaming ===
In 2003-2004, &quot;Sketch&quot; was renamed to &quot;Skencil&quot;.

As claimed on its website, &quot;Skencil is implemented almost completely in Python, a very high-level, object oriented, interpreted language, with the rest written in C for speed&quot;.

On 19 June 2005, &quot;Skencil 0.6.17&quot; was released. It has versions compatible with Linux on the i386, DEC Alpha, m68k, PowerPC and SPARC architectures, with FreeBSD, with Solaris, with IRIX64 6.4, and with AIX. Since then development have been frozen and, as a result, its packages have been removed from Linux distributions repositories.

=== Revitalization ===
On 19 November 2006, Reiter and Herzog asked Ihor Novikov, sK1 Project lead developer, to join &quot;Skencil&quot; development.

On 31 October 2010, &quot;Skencil 1.0 alpha&quot; was released, as a result of revitalization work done by sK1 Project team that made it possible to use &quot;Skencil&quot; on 64-bit hardware and modern OS at the time. Source and binary packages for various Linux distributions has been published on &quot;sK1 Project&quot;&#x27;s page on code.google.com, where it now archived.

On 4 November 2016, &quot;Skencil 1.0 rc1&quot; was released and the last code changes committed on 7 February 2020 on &quot;sK1 Project&quot;&#x27;s page on GitHub. There are no binary packages for this release.

=== sK1 ===

&quot;sK1&quot; vector graphics editor, developed by sK1 Project team, written in wxWidgets become an independent &quot;Skencil&quot; successor (fork), improved by color management (including CMYK color space support), tabbed multiple document interface, Pango based text engine, Cairo based renderer and importers for CorelDRAW (CDR, CMX, CCX) and many other graphics file formats.

Future plans had included porting the user interface from Tk/Tkinter to GTK+, a multiple document interface, and multi-font, fully integrated multiline text, patterns fills instead of solid color, etc.

<text>Daniel Abraham (Abe) Yanofsky (March 25, 1925 – March 5, 2000) was a Canadian chess player, chess arbiter, writer, lawyer, and politician. An eight-time Canadian chess champion, Yanofsky was Canada&#x27;s first grandmaster and the first grandmaster of the British Commonwealth.

==Early life==
Yanofsky was born to a Jewish family in Brody, Poland (now western Ukraine), and moved to Canada when he was eight months old, settling with his family in Winnipeg.

==Life in chess==
===Early successes===
He learned to play chess at the age of eight. Yanofsky won his first Manitoba provincial championship at age 12 in 1937, also making his debut in the Closed Canadian Chess Championship that same year in Toronto. In 1939, just 14 years old, he played for Canada at the Buenos Aires Olympiad. Yanofsky was the sensation of the tournament, making the highest score on second board. He won his first Canadian Chess Championship in 1941 at age 16, at home in Winnipeg. He won at Ventnor City 1942 with 6.5/9, and tied 1st-2nd with Herman Steiner on 16/17 in the 1942 U.S. Open at Dallas.

===First Commonwealth GM===
In 1946, at age 21, Yanofsky entered the first major post-World War II international tournament at Groningen, where he defeated the Soviet champion and tournament winner, Mikhail Botvinnik, winning the brilliancy prize. Over the next two years, he played in several more European events, where his best result was second place behind Miguel Najdorf at Barcelona 1946. Yanofsky represented Canada at the Interzonals held in Saltsjöbaden 1948 and Stockholm 1962. He won the British Championship in 1953. At Dallas 1957, Yanofsky achieved his first grandmaster norm with wins over Samuel Reshevsky, Friðrik Ólafsson and Larry Evans. His performance at the Tel Aviv 1964 Olympiad earned him his second grandmaster norm and the title, thereby becoming the first grandmaster of the British Commonwealth.

===Canadian champion===
Yanofsky, winner in 1941, repeated as Canadian champion in 1943, 1945, 1947, 1953, 1959, 1963, and 1965; his eight titles is a Canadian record (tied with Maurice Fox).

===Olympiads ===
Yanofsky represented Canada at eleven Olympiads: (Buenos Aires 1939, 2nd board, {13.5/16}, Amsterdam 1954 1st board, {9/17}, Munich 1958, 1st board, {5.5/11}, Tel Aviv 1964, 1st board, {10/16}, Havana 1966, 1st board, {3.5/5}, Lugano 1968, 1st board, {6/14}, Siegen 1970, 1st board, {7/14}, Skopje 1972, 2nd board, {6/13}, Nice 1974, 3rd board, {7/14}, Haifa 1976, 3rd board, {3.5/10}, and La Valletta 1980), 3rd board, {6/11}). His Olympiad totals are: +50 =54 -37, for 54.6 percent. His record of Olympiad appearances is surpassed among Canadians only by International Master Lawrence Day (13). His total of 141 games played is the Canadian record among men, and second only to Nava Starr (147).

===Further tournament successes===
Further tournament titles included Arbon 1946 (tied with Karel Opocensky and Ludek Pachman), Reykjavík 1947, Hastings 1952-53 (tied with Harry Golombek, Jonathan Penrose, and Antonio Medina), and the Canadian Open Chess Championship 1979 (Edmonton). Yanofsky placed second at Hastings 1951-52 behind Svetozar Gligorić and second at Netanya 1968 behind Bobby Fischer.

===Later years===
A central figure in the Winnipeg chess scene, Yanofsky organized Canada&#x27;s first international grandmaster tournament in Winnipeg in 1967 to mark Canada&#x27;s Centennial. He also played in the tournament and was awarded the brilliancy prize for his victory over László Szabó; the event was jointly won by Bent Larsen and Klaus Darga. In 1974, Yanofsky also brought to Winnipeg the Pan American Chess Championship that was won by Walter Browne.

Yanofsky earned the FIDE International Arbiter title in 1977.

He played in his final Canadian championship in 1986 at age 61 at home in Winnipeg, and qualified for another Interzonal appearance by placing tied for 3rd-4th with 9.5/15, but ceded the seat in favour of Denis Allan, a younger player.

Yanofsky returned to Groningen in 1996 for the 50th anniversary tournament among the 1946 event&#x27;s seven surviving players; former world champion Vassily Smyslov won.

== Chess style ==
According to &quot;Golombek&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Chess&quot;, Yanofsky was known for his expertise in the French Defence and the Ruy Lopez, but his strongpoint was his endgame play. Samuel Reshevsky, who played against Yanofsky on a number of occasions, said that he was a tough opponent. &quot;His style is defensive but quite accurate,&quot; he wrote. &quot;When given the slightest opportunity, he is strong enough to beat the best.&quot;

==Education and legal career==
Except from 1946 to 1947, Yanofsky never pursued chess full-time.

He entered the University of Manitoba in 1941, earning a science degree in 1944.

He served in the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II (1944–46).

Yanofsky graduated with a law degree from the University of Manitoba in 1951. He won several scholarships, which allowed him to pursue legal studies at Oxford University (1951–53). Following graduation, he practiced law in Winnipeg with his brother Harry, who was also a chess master. Yanofsky argued several cases before the Supreme Court of Canada.

== Politics ==
Yanofsky was an alderman, then mayor of the Winnipeg suburb of West Kildonan from 1969 to 1971, and served on the Winnipeg city council from 1971 to 1986, chairing the finance committee.

He campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1959 provincial election as a candidate of the Liberal-Progressive Party. He finished third behind David Orlikow of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in the St. Johns constituency.

Yanofsky played a major role in the building of the Seven Oaks General Hospital and the Wellness Institute in the city&#x27;s north end.

==Honours==
In 1972, Yanofsky was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1980, he was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. In 2000, he was inducted as a charter member of the Canadian Chess Hall of Fame.

Following Yanofsky&#x27;s death in 2000, a memorial tournament has been held annually in Winnipeg in recognition of his contributions to Canadian chess.

Yanofsky was married to Hilda (née Gutnik); they had four children.

<text>Fred Dewhirst Yates (16 January 1884, Birstall – 11 November 1932, London) was an English chess master who won the British Chess Championship on six occasions. He started a career in accountancy, but in 1909, abandoned it in favour of becoming a professional chess player and journalist.

==Chess career==
Yates almost won the British Championship in 1911, when he tied for first place with Henry Atkins, but lost the play-off. He went on to secure the title in 1913, 1914, 1921, 1926, 1928 and 1931.

Despite considerable domestic success, his record in international tournaments did not do him justice. Often the winner against his strongest opponents, he would then lose to those at the bottom of the table. This was particularly apparent at the Budapest tournament of 1926.
His lack of consistency was attributed to poor health and loss of stamina. A constant hacking cough went unchecked, as his funds did not stretch to a holiday in warmer climes; the advice given by his doctor. He was also subjected to journalistic pressures, frequently reporting on the tournaments in which he was playing. Yet, dedicating himself to the playing side of chess would have earned him insufficient sums to make a living. A number of his contemporaries believed that his talent could have placed him among the world championship contenders, had his circumstances been different. Nevertheless, in his time, he defeated most of his illustrious adversaries, the most notable exceptions being Emanuel Lasker and José Raúl Capablanca. His victory against Alexander Alekhine at Karlsbad in 1923 won the brilliancy prize, while his win against Milan Vidmar at San Remo in 1930 was described by Alekhine as the finest game played since the war.

As a journalist he was the chess columnist of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; and with William Winter, the co-author of &quot;Modern Master Play&quot; (1929). He wrote accounts of two world championship encounters; those between Alekhine and Capablanca, and Alekhine and Bogoljubow.

In team competition, he played at the first, third and fourth Olympiads, representing the &#x27;British Empire&#x27; team. On each occasion, he made a plus score and at London 1927, earned a team bronze medal.

His life ended prematurely, when a leaking gas pipe caused him to asphyxiate during his sleep.

According to the inscription on Yates&#x27; gravestone, his birth name was actually Fred Dewhirst Yates. However, throughout his chess career he was known as Frederick Dewhurst Yates, or simply as F.D. Yates, both of which featured in his posthumously published, part-biographical, &#x27;My Best Games&#x27; Collection. &#x27;Frederick Dewhurst Yates&#x27; was also used by the editor of British Chess Magazine in the title of Yates&#x27; obituary.

==Tournament record==
Competing within the British Isles, he was first at Glasgow 1911, Cheltenham 1913, Chester 1914, Malvern 1921, Edinburgh 1926 and Tunbridge Wells 1927. There were second-place finishes at Oxford 1910, Richmond 1912, Southport 1924, Hastings 1924/25 and Stratford-upon-Avon 1925.

Abroad, his best results included first equal with Savielly Tartakower at Kecskemét (B Final, 1927) and fifth at San Remo (the strongest tournament of 1930), when he finished ahead of Spielmann, Vidmar and Tartakower. He was second at Ghent in 1926, after Tartakower, but ahead of Colle and Janowski.

==Notable games==

* Yates was a very sporting person and even published this loss to Capablanca in his own collection of best games: Capablanca vs. Yates, English Opening, Barcelona 1929 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.b3 Bg7 4.Bb2 0-0 5.g3 d6 6.Bg2 Nc6 7.0-0 e5 8.d4 Nd7 9.dxe5 Ndxe5 10.Nc3 Re8 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Qd2 a5 13.Rac1 Rb8 14.h3 Bd7 15.Nd5 b6 16.f4 Nc6 17.Bxg7 Kxg7 18.Qb2+ f6 19.g4 Nb4 20.g5 Nxd5 21.cxd5 Rc8 22.e4 c6 23.dxc6 Rxc6 24.gxf6+ Kf7 25.e5 Rxc1 26.Rxc1 dxe5 27.fxe5 Qb8 28.Qd4 Bf5 29.Bd5+ Kf8 30.Qf4 Rxe5 31.Qh6+ Ke8 32.f7+ 
* He was also noted for extreme doggedness, fighting until the last vestige of hope was gone before conceding defeat. His game against Alekhine involved a combination some eighteen moves deep: Alekhine vs. Yates, King&#x27;s Indian Defence, Karlsbad 1923 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 0-0 5.Nc3 d6 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.d5 Nb8 8.e4 Nbd7 9.0-0 a5 10.Be3 Ng4 11.Bd4 Nge5 12.Nxe5 Nxe5 13.c5 dxc5 14.Bxc5 b6 15.Bd4 Ba6 16.Re1 Qd6 17.Bf1 Bxf1 18.Rxf1 c5 19.Bxe5 Qxe5 20.Qb3 Rab8 21.Qb5 f5 22.Rae1 f4 23.Qd7 Rbd8 24.gxf4 Qxf4 25.Qe6+ Kh8 26.f3 Qg5+ 27.Kh1 Rd6 28.Qh3 Be5 29.Re2 Rdf6 30.Nd1 Rf4 31.Ne3 Rh4 32.Qe6 Qh5 33.Ng4 Rxg4 34.fxg4 Rxf1+ 35.Kg2 Qxh2+ 36.Kxf1 Qh1+ 37.Kf2 Bd4+ 38.Kg3 Qg1+ 39.Kh3 Qf1+ 40.Rg2 Qh1+ 41.Kg3 Qe1+ 42.Kh3 g5 43.Rc2 Qf1+ 44.Kh2 Qg1+ 45.Kh3 Qh1+ 46.Kg3 Qd1 47.Rc3 Qg1+ 48.Kh3 Qf1+ 49.Kg3 Bf2+ 50.Kf3 Bg1+ 
* Vidmar vs. Yates, Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, San Remo 1930, 0–1. Black parries White&#x27;s resourceful attack and develops sharp counterplay on the opposite wing.

<doc id="499251" wikidata="Q701654" url="?curid=499251" title="RMS Lancastria">
<text>RMS &quot;Lancastria&quot; was a British ocean liner requisitioned by the Government of the United Kingdom during the Second World War. She was sunk on 17 June 1940 during Operation Aerial. Having received an emergency order to evacuate British nationals and troops from France, the ship was loaded well in excess of its capacity of 1,300 passengers. Modern estimates suggest that between 4,000 and 7,000 people died during the sinking — the largest single-ship loss of life in British maritime history.

== Career ==

The ship was launched in 1920 as &quot;Tyrrhenia&quot; by William Beardmore and Company of Dalmuir on the River Clyde for the Anchor Line, a subsidiary of Cunard. She was the sister ship of RMS , which Beardmore had built for the Anchor Line the previous year. &quot;Tyrrhenia&quot; was , long and could carry 2,200 passengers in three classes. She made her maiden voyage, Glasgow–Quebec City–Montreal, on 19 June 1922.

In 1924 she was refitted for two classes and renamed &quot;Lancastria&quot; after passengers complained that they could not properly pronounce &quot;Tyrrhenia; (viz: RP&quot; as per the crew&#x27;s nickname of the ship: the &quot;Old Soup &quot;Tureen&quot;&quot;.

She sailed scheduled routes between Liverpool and New York until 1932, and was then used as a cruise ship in the Mediterranean Sea and Northern Europe. On 10 October 1932 &quot;Lancastria&quot; rescued the crew of the Belgian cargo ship SS &quot;Scheldestad&quot;, which had been abandoned in a sinking condition in the Bay of Biscay. In 1934 the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland chartered &quot;Lancastria&quot; for a pilgrimage to Rome. In May 1936, she undertook a specially commissioned cruise to visit war memorials at Malta, Salonika, Gallipoli and Istanbul. The passengers on this voyage included Admiral of the Fleet Roger Keyes, Field Marshal William Birdwood and Commodore Edward Unwin.

At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, &quot;Lancastria&quot; was in the Bahamas. She was ordered to sail from Nassau to New York for refitting as she had been requisitioned as a troopship, becoming HMT &quot;Lancastria&quot;. Unnecessary fittings were removed, she was repainted in battleship grey, the portholes were blacked out, and a 4-inch gun was installed. She was first used to ferry men and supplies between Canada and the United Kingdom. In April 1940, she was one of twenty troopships in Operation Alphabet, the evacuation of troops from Norway, and was bombed on the return journey although she escaped damage. Shortly afterwards, &quot;Lancastria&quot; carried troops to consolidate the invasion of Iceland. Returning to Glasgow, the captain requested that surplus oil in her tanks be removed, but there was insufficient time before she was ordered to Liverpool for a refit. Crew members were either discharged or sent on leave.

== Loss ==
&quot;Lancastria&quot; was sunk on 17 June 1940 off the French port of St. Nazaire while taking part in Operation Aerial, the evacuation of British nationals and troops from France, two weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation.

===Outward voyage===
Within hours of berthing at Liverpool, &quot;Lancastria&quot; was urgently recalled to sea; loud-speaker announcements at the main railway station successfully recalled nearly all the crew members; she arrived in Plymouth on 15 June to await orders. She was originally sent to Quiberon Bay as part of Operation Aerial, which was the evacuation of the remainder of the British Expeditionary Force which had been cut off to the south of the German advance through France, amounting to some 124,000 men, mostly logistic support troops, from various ports in western France. Accompanying &quot;Lancastria&quot; was the 20,341-ton liner, . Finding that she was not required for the evacuation from Lorient, the captain of &quot;Lancastria&quot;, Rudolph Sharp, was sent on towards the port of St. Nazaire, where many more troops were waiting to be lifted, On the way, an air raid damaged &quot;Franconia&quot;, which returned to England for repairs, leaving &quot;Lancastria&quot; to continue alone. She arrived in the mouth of the Loire estuary late on 16 June. Because the port has to be accessed along a tidal channel, &quot;Lancastria&quot; anchored in the Charpentier Roads, some south-west of St. Nazaire, at 04:00 on 17 June, along with some thirty other merchant vessels of all sizes.

=== Embarkation ===
Early in the morning, three RNVR officers came aboard to ask how many troops &quot;Lancastria&quot; could take. Her normal complement in troopship configuration was 2,180 including 330 crew; however, Captain Sharp had brought 2,653 men back from Norway, so he replied that he could take 3,000 &quot;at a pinch&quot;. He was told that he should take as many as he possibly could &quot;without regard to the limits of International Law&quot;. Troops were ferried out to &quot;Lancastria&quot; and the other larger ships by destroyers, tugs, fishing boats and other small craft, a round trip of three or four hours, sometimes being machine-gunned by German aircraft, although apparently without casualties. By the mid-afternoon of 17 June she had embarked an unknown number (estimates range from 4,000 up to 9,000) line-of-communication troops (including Pioneer and Royal Army Service Corps soldiers) and Royal Air Force personnel, together with about forty civilian refugees, including embassy staff and employees of Fairey Aviation of Belgium with their families. People were crowded into whatever spaces were available including the large cargo holds. One Royal Engineers officer reported that he had been told by one of &quot;Lancastria&#x27;s&quot; loading officers that over 7,200 people had come aboard. Captain Sharp estimated the number to be 5,500.

At 13:50, during an air-raid, the nearby , a 20,000-ton Orient Liner, was hit on the bridge by a German bomb. &quot;Lancastria&quot; was free to depart and the captain of the British destroyer advised her to do so; but, without a destroyer escort as defence against a possible submarine attack, Sharp decided to wait for &quot;Oronsay&quot; before leaving.

=== Sinking ===

A fresh air raid began at 15:50 by Junkers Ju 88 bomber aircraft from &quot;Kampfgeschwader 30&quot;. &quot;Lancastria&quot; was hit by three or possibly four bombs. A number of survivors reported that one bomb had gone down the ship&#x27;s single funnel which is most likely, given the speed with which the ship sank – about 15–20 minutes. The testimony of an engineering officer, Frank Brogden, who was in the engine room at the time contradicts this. Brogden&#x27;s account states that one bomb landed close to the funnel and entered No. 4 hold. Two other bombs landed in No. 2 and No. 3 holds while a fourth landed close to the port side of the ship, rupturing the fuel oil tanks, though even with this damage, the ship should have stayed afloat for longer unless the report of the bomb in the funnel was true. As the ship began to list to starboard, orders were given for the men on deck to move to the port side in an effort to counteract it, but this caused a list to port which could not be corrected. The ship was equipped with sixteen lifeboats and 2,500 life jackets; but many of the boats could not be launched because they had been damaged in the bombing or because of the angle of the hull. The first boat away was filled with women and children but it capsized on landing in the water and a second had to be lowered for them. A third boat had its bottom stoved in by landing too fast. A large number of men who jumped over the side were killed by hitting the side of the hull or had their necks broken by their life jackets on impact with the water. As &quot;Lancastria&quot; began to capsize, some of those who were still on board managed to scramble onto the ship&#x27;s underside. According to some accounts, these were heard to be singing &#x27;Roll Out the Barrel&#x27; and &#x27;There&#x27;ll Always Be an England&#x27;, though some survivors strongly deny this. The ship sank at 16:12, within twenty minutes of being hit, which gave little time for other vessels to respond. Many of those in the water drowned because there were insufficient life jackets, or died from hypothermia, or were choked by fuel oil. According to Jonathan Fenby in his book &quot;The Sinking of the Lancastria,&quot; the German aircraft strafed survivors in the water.

Survivors were taken aboard other British and Allied evacuation vessels, the trawler rescuing 900. Capt WG Euston recommended several of his crew for awards, including Stanley Kingett for &quot;making repeated journeys in a lifeboat to pick up exhausted men from the water while under machine-gun fire from enemy planes&quot;, and William Perrin for &quot;keeping up continuous machine-gun fire in an attempt to prevent enemy planes machine-gunning men in the water.&quot; Rudolph Sharp survived the sinking and went on to command the , losing his life on 12 September 1942 in the &quot;Laconia&quot; incident off West Africa.

==== Estimated casualties ====
There were 2,477 survivors, of whom about 100 were still alive in 2011. Many families of the dead knew only that they died with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF); the death toll accounted for roughly a third of the total losses of the BEF in France. She sank around south of Chémoulin Point in the Charpentier roads, around from St. Nazaire. &quot;Lancastria&quot; Association names 1,738 people known to have been killed. In 2005, Fenby wrote that estimates of the death toll vary from fewer than people although it is also estimated that as many as 7,000 people perished, the largest loss of life in British maritime history. It is sometimes considered the second worst loss of life at sea, although with the estimates of the worst shipwrecks like the &quot;Goya&quot; also being 7,000, it is unknown which is worse.

=== Availability of information ===
The immense loss of life was such that the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, immediately suppressed news of the disaster through the D-Notice system, telling his staff that &quot;The newspapers have got quite enough disaster for today at least&quot;. In his memoirs, Churchill stated that he had intended to release the news a few days later, but that events in France &quot;crowded upon us so black and so quickly that I forgot to lift the ban&quot;.

The sinking was announced that evening during the English-language Nazi propaganda radio programme &quot;Germany Calling&quot; by its presenter William Joyce, better known as &quot;Lord Haw-Haw&quot;; however his claims were notoriously unreliable and had little public credence. The story was finally broken in the United States by the Press Association on 25 July, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and the next day in Britain by &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, more than five weeks after the sinking. Other British newspapers then covered the story, including the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; (also on 26 July), which carried the story on its front page, and &quot;Sunday Express&quot; on 4 August; the latter included a photograph of the capsized ship with her upturned hull lined with men under the headline &quot;Last Moments of the Greatest Sea Tragedy of All Time&quot;. All the photographs of the sinking were taken by Frank Clements, a volunteer storeman aboard HMS &quot;Highlander&quot;, who was exempt from the regulations prohibiting the use of cameras by service personnel.

However, there were earlier reports of the sinking and the scale of the disaster from survivors in local British newspapers. Mr H J Cooper is quoted in the &quot;Chelmsford Chronicle&quot; on 28 June: &quot;I am afraid thousands died, but tell the world they sang &#x27;Roll out the Barrel&#x27; as they died.&quot; Private Ronald Herbert Yorke (Sherwood Foresters) is quoted in the &quot;Ripley and Heanor News&quot; on 5 July: &quot;Hundreds of my pals were imprisoned below. They had no chance because the ship went down in 15 minutes. Those who got away were machine-gunned in the water&quot;.

In July 2007 another request for documents held by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) related to the sinking was rejected by the British government. &quot;Lancastria&quot; Association of Scotland made a further request in 2009. They were told that release under the FOIA would not be given because of several exemptions. In the face of continued campaigning by relatives, the MoD stated in 2015 that all known documents had long since been released through the National Archives. On 17 June 2010 (70th anniversary of the sinking) Janet Dempsey gave a lecture at The National Archives entitled &quot;Forgotten Tragedy: The Loss of HMT Lancastria&quot;. This drew on all known information held at Kew. A transcript and podcast are available from The National Archives website.

=== Wreck status ===
The Government of the United Kingdom has not made the site a war grave under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, stating that it has no jurisdiction over French territorial waters. Early in the 21st century the French Government placed an exclusion zone around the wreck site.

The &quot;Lancastria&quot; Association of Scotland began a campaign in 2005 to secure greater recognition for the loss of life aboard &quot;Lancastria&quot; and the acknowledgement of the endurance of survivors that day. It petitioned the British Government to have the wreck site designated an official maritime war grave. The Government did not do so as it was within French territorial waters, outside the jurisdiction of the Act. The campaign received support from all parties, but the MoD said that such a move would be &quot;purely symbolic&quot; and have no effect. In 2006, 14 additional wrecks sunk at the Battle of Jutland were designated as war graves, but &quot;Lancastria&quot; was not.

The MoD stated in 2015 that &quot;as the French Government has provided an appropriate level of protection to &quot;Lancastria&quot; through French law and it is formally considered a military maritime grave by the MoD, we believe that the wreck has the formal status and protection it deserves.&quot;

== Legacy ==

All service personnel killed during the Second World War are recorded by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Of those known to have lost their lives on &quot;Lancastria&quot;, 1,816 burials are recorded, over 400 of them in France.

The missing British military dead from the sinking of &quot;Lancastria&quot; (those whose bodies were not recovered or were unable to be identified) are commemorated on a number of Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials (those identified were buried in cemeteries and are marked with Commission headstones). There are a number of Commonwealth war graves (some with named dead soldiers from the Pioneer Corps but many commemorated as unknown) in fishing ports on the French islands of Île de Ré and Île d&#x27;Oléron (cemeteries at Saint-Martin-de-Ré, Saint-Trojan-les-Bains, Saint-Clément-des-Baleines, Ars-en-Ré and others) with gravestones dated 17 June 1940. It is likely that the bodies of these men were recovered from the Bay of Biscay by French fishermen and brought back to their home ports to be interred. Around 700 missing from the British Expeditionary Force are commemorated on the Dunkirk Memorial. The missing dead who served in the Navy are commemorated on the naval memorials at Chatham, Plymouth and Portsmouth, with missing merchant seamen named at the Tower Hill Memorial, and the missing airmen who went down with the ship, listed on the Runnymede Memorial.

After the war, the &quot;Lancastria&quot; Survivors Association was founded by Major Peter Petit, but this lapsed on his death in 1969. It reformed in 1981 as The HMT &quot;Lancastria&quot; Association and continues the tradition of a parade and remembrance service at the Church of St Katharine Cree in the City of London, where there is a memorial stained glass window. The &quot;Lancastria&quot; Association of Scotland was formed in 2005 and holds its annual service at St George&#x27;s West Church in Edinburgh.

The &quot;Lancastria&quot; Association of Scotland has members throughout the UK, France and the rest of Europe as well as members in North America, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. It also organises the largest memorial service for the victims in the UK. The service, which is attended by survivors and relatives of both victims and survivors together with representatives of the French and Scottish Governments and a number of veterans organisations and is held on the closest Saturday to the anniversary of 17 June each year at St. George&#x27;s West Church, Edinburgh.

In June 2010 to mark the 70th anniversary of the sinking, special ceremonies and services of remembrance were held in Edinburgh and St. Nazaire. As the 100th anniversary of the sinking took place in 2012, fresh calls were made for &quot;official recognition&quot; of the loss of &quot;Lancastria&quot; by the British Government. The day of the 75th anniversary of the loss of &quot;Lancastria&quot; was marked in the Westminster Parliament on 17 June 2015 at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who was standing in for the Prime Minister. Osborne said of the sinking: &quot;It was kept secret at the time for reasons of wartime secrecy, but I think it is appropriate today in this House of Commons to remember all those who died, those who survived, and those who mourn them.&quot;

In June 2008, the first batch of commemorative medals was presented to survivors and relatives of victims and survivors; the HMT &quot;Lancastria&quot; Commemorative Medal, which represented &quot;official Scottish Government recognition&quot; of the &quot;Lancastria&quot; disaster. The medal was designed by Mark Hirst, grandson of &quot;Lancastria&quot; survivor Walter Hirst. The inscription on the rear of the medal reads: &quot;In recognition of the ultimate sacrifice of the 4000 victims of Britain&#x27;s worst-ever maritime disaster and the endurance of survivors – We will remember them&quot;. The front of the medal depicts &quot;Lancastria&quot; with the text &quot;HMT Lancastria – 17th June 1940&quot;. The medal ribbon has a grey background with a red and black central stripe, representative of the ship&#x27;s wartime and merchant marine colours.
A memorial on the sea-front at St Nazaire was unveiled on 17 June 1988, &quot;in proud memory of more than 4,000 who died and in commemoration of the people of Saint Nazaire and surrounding districts who saved many lives, tended wounded and gave a Christian burial to victims&quot;.

&quot;Lancastria&quot; is represented at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire by a sessile oak tree and a plaque. St Katharine Cree church in the City of London has a memorial window to &quot;Lancastria&quot;. It also has a model of the ship in a glass case and the ship&#x27;s bell is also in the church. Scouting Ireland&#x27;s national campsite Larch Hill has an anchor memorial to &quot;Lancastria&quot;, commemorating the legacy of the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland&#x27;s pilgrimage in 1932.

In October 2011, the &quot;Lancastria&quot; Association of Scotland has erected a memorial to the victims on the site where the ship was built, the former Dalmuir shipyard at Clydebank, Glasgow, now the grounds of the Golden Jubilee Hospital. In September 2013, a plaque was unveiled at Liverpool&#x27;s Pier Head by Lord Mayor Gary Millar commemorating the loss of the ship. The site of &quot;Lancastria&quot; wreck lies in French territorial waters and is therefore ineligible for protection under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986; however, at the request of the British Government, in 2006 the French authorities gave the site legal protection as a war grave.

After a postponement because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a commemorative service was held at Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool on 27 June 2020.

In 2001 was published &quot;The Lancastria Tragedy Sinking and Cover-Up:June 1940&quot; by Stephen Wynn giving figures of 2,488 survivors and a mininium of 2,385 perished (1,472 names on list; CWGC records 1,816 names(400 in France); Lancastria Association identies 1,738 died on ship).

<text>The SIG P210 (Swiss Army designation Pistole 49, the civilian model was known as SP47/8 prior to 1957) is a locked breech self loading, semi-automatic pistol designed and manufactured in Neuhausen am Rheinfall (Canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland) by SIG from 1948 to 2006.

It is of all-steel construction chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum and 7.65×21mm Parabellum. It was used from 1949 to 1975 by the Swiss Army and police units. It was also adopted by the Military of Denmark in 1949 (as M/49 Neuhausen or simply Neuhausen) and was replaced by the SIG P320 in 2019, and in 1951 by the German Bundespolizei and in shooting sports.

The pistols were decommissioned by the Swiss Army and replaced by the SIG Sauer P220 (Swiss Army designation &quot;Pistole 75&quot;) developed in 1975. Swiss production of the P210 continued until 2006. A new model, the P210 Legend, was introduced by SIG Sauer GMBH of Germany in 2010, and another, the P210A, was introduced by SIG Sauer Inc. of New Hampshire in the United States in 2017. In 2022, Sig Sauer released the P210 Carry originally debuted at the 2010 Shot Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. The P210 Carry is a pistol chambered in 9x19 Parabellum with a capacity of 8+1. The P210 Carry is lighter and smaller than the original P210 featuring an alloy frame and a 4.1 inch barrel instead of the 4.7 inch barrel on the original P210. It also differs because it has new additions such as the front slide serrations, the Nitron finish, and the black Hogue G10 grips, for a more aggressive and modern look.

==History==
The design was derived from Charles Petter&#x27;s Modèle 1935A pistol. In 1937, &quot;Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft&quot; (SIG) acquired a license for the Petter–Browning system from SACM in order to develop a replacement for the Luger Parabellum 06/29, which had been in service since 1900. Apparently not satisfied with the Petter Browning design or the changes they had made to it, SIG evaluated no fewer than 11 prototypes from 1942 through 1944. Selbstladepistole Neuhausen model 44/16 pistol production began in 1944. Some of the original Petter Browning features had been retained, specifically the self-contained firing and recoil systems. The Neuhausen 44/16 had a magazine capacity of 16 rounds.

Development was slowed by the Second World War. After testing various experimental models (such as the aforementioned 44/16 with a double-column magazine), the 47/8 model was adopted in Oct 1948 as the Pistole Modell 1949 (P49), and SP47/8 for civilian market. Some previous series were tested by Swedish sport shooters and by the Danish army (Danish Defence designation Pistol M/1949). 

The 47/8 model supported the easy change of the barrels between 7.65 and 9mm Parabellum and a kit to convert to .22 caliber (see table below).

SIG M/1949 is the 47/8 model purchased for the Danish military and issued version for officers, military police, and special forces, chambered in 9mm Luger. 
Usually called only &quot;Neuhausen&quot; in Denmark, this model is stamped &quot;P m/49&quot;, and also known as &quot;P210-DK&quot;.
First issued beginning in 1950 to the Danish Army Technical Corps (stamped &quot;HTK&quot;), this remained the standard sidearm in the Danish military throughout 60 years of continuous use, since the 2010s being replaced with the SIG Sauer P320 X-5 Carry.

In 1957, the civil designation (SP47/8) was definitively changed to P210 according to the company nomenclature policy. Model P210-1 in retrospect covers all models produced until 1965, the designation P210-2 refers to the standard model as produced from 1966 (beginning with serial nr. P 59071). 

P210-3 was a police version produced from 1951 to 1964 (serial nrs. P 6791 to P 6840 and P 8001 to P 8893), produced in limited numbers for the cantonal police forces of Basel, Lausanne, and Glarus, with a handful sold on the private market.
P210-4 was the model made for the German border guard (serial nrs. D 1 to D 6500).
P210-5 and P210-6 were civilian target shooting models made in the 1980s and 1990s.
P210-7 was a rarely produced .22lr rimfire model, made in the 1950s and 1960s. 
In 2000, SIG sold all divisions, with the exception of the &quot;Packaging Machines&quot; division. The &quot;Small Arms&quot; division was taken over by the Lüke &amp; Ortmeier Group and renamed SAN Swiss Arms AG.
SAN Swiss Arms AG continued production of the P210 for private customers until 2006. 
From 2010, a new model, dubbed &quot;P210 Legend&quot; was made by SIG Sauer, GMBH of Eckernförde, Germany. This model was exported to the USA until 2017, when 
SIG Sauer Inc. of New Hampshire began production of its own model, dubbed P210A, made in Exeter, N.H., offered in two versions, Standard (210A-9-B) and Target (210A-9-TGT).

==Serial numbers==
Serial numbers starting A are the Swiss army ordnance models. 
Army models run from serial number A 100001 to A 213110. Those that have a P added to the rear of a serial number that starts with an A have been sold by the Swiss army to civilians. A stamped &quot;P&quot; (=&quot;privat&quot;) on the front of the trigger guard shows that a weapon was left as a gift to the owner upon leaving the Armed Services.

Serial numbers 6001 to 6028 are prototypes made during 1938–1947. 6033 to 6406 are early model SP47/8 made in 1947.

Serial numbers with a P were made for police and for private use, running from P 8001 to P 8250 (1951) and 
P 50004 (1949) to P 79150 (1975). 
Serial numbers from P 79600 to P 97950 are private models made by SIG Sauer, Switzerland, during 1976–1984, and P 300001 to P 331536 were made by Sig Sauer (Swiss Arms) during 1983–2006; the jump to the 300000s range marks the transition from traditional forged frames to CNC production. 

During 1966–1969, SIG produced a small number of special heavy frame P210-5 models for the National Match team.
These are extremely rare, with a total of 46 pieces known in literature.
In the 1970s, these heavy frame models were commercialized and offered on the market, with 
100 pieces of P210-6 heavy frame pistols (P 76521 to P76620) made in 1979, 
and 50 pieces of P210-6 heavy frame pistols, made for Hofmann &amp; Reinhart of Zürich (P 79101 to 79150).
These pistols represent the pinnacle of SIG pistol manufacture and are extremely sought after by collectors, and consequently almost never offered on the open market.
Another special edition is numbered JP 1 to JP 500 (1978, &quot;125 Years of SIG&quot; anniversary edition).
P 555001 to P 555555 are special collectors&#x27; edition of 555 sets of five chromed pistols with gilded controls, P210, P220, P225, P226 and P230, made for Vonbank AG in 1987 to 1990), at the time sold for CHF 12,950.
In 1991, another special edition numbered № 0001 to № 1991 was made to commemorate &quot;700 Years of Swiss Confederation&quot; (&quot;700 Jahre Eidgenossenschaft&quot;), at the time sold for CHF 4,100 per piece.

Serial numbers starting with a D belong to the Bundesgrenzschutz issues (D 1 to D 6500).
The Danish m/49 pistols have their own serial numbers, without a leading letter, engraved on the right side of the slide, running from 7695 (1951) to 35383 (1962).
The rare P210-7 .22lr calibre versions have numbers in the range 40501 (1957) to 41762 (1968).

<text>:&quot;South Bruce Peninsula is not to be confused with the Municipality of South Bruce, Ontario&quot;

South Bruce Peninsula is a town at the base of the Bruce Peninsula of Ontario, Canada, in Bruce County between Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. It was formed on January 1, 1999, when the town of Wiarton, the village of Hepworth, and the townships of Albemarle and Amabel were amalgamated. The new municipality was created to provide necessary political representation, administrative support, and necessary municipal services on behalf of the residents.

Tourism, particularly cottage rental and providing services to visitors, is the major industry in the area. Many cottages are found along Sauble Beach (North and South).

==Communities==

The town comprises a number of villages and larger communities. These include the following:

* Albemarle Ward: Adamsville, Colpoys Bay, Hope Bay, Howdenvale, Mar, Purple Valley, Red Bay; &quot;McIver&quot;
* Amabel Ward: Allenford, Clavering, Elsinore, Hepworth, Oliphant, Park Head, Sauble Beach, Wiarton; &quot;French Bay&quot;, &quot;Sauble Beach South&quot;, &quot;Sauble Falls&quot;, &quot;Skipness&quot;, &quot;Tolmie&quot;

The administrative centre of the region is found in Wiarton.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, South Bruce Peninsula had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


Population trend prior to amalgamation:
* Population total in 1996: 8,004
** Albemarle (township): 1,217
** Amabel (township): 3,917
** Hepworth (village): 470
** Wiarton (town): 2,400
* Population in 1991:
** Albemarle (township): 1,140
** Amabel (township): 3,815
** Hepworth (village): 453
** Wiarton (town): 2,326

Mother tongue (2021):
* English as first language: 94.7%
* French as first language: 0.9%
* English and French as first language: 0.2%
* Other as first language: 3.8%

==Attractions==

The main tourist attractions for the area are Sauble Beach, Wiarton Willie (Groundhog Day), and fishing locations on Lake Huron and Georgian Bay.

The region has many annual festivals such as the Wiarton Willie Festival, held each February; the William Wilfred Campbell Poetry &amp; Arts Festival in June; the Wiarton Rotary Village Fair, held on Civic Holiday weekend each August; the Oliphant Regatta, held each summer; Sauble Sandfest, held each August; and the Wiarton Fall Fair, held each September.

The Bruce Trail, the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada, with over 440 km of side trails, runs up the eastern side of the Bruce Peninsula.

Isaac Lake Management area is north of Wiarton, Ontario.

==Government==
An elected mayor, deputy major and three councilors provide the municipal government, guided by provincial legislation. A number of Committees and local Boards assist Council. &quot;Council establishes policies and budgets for programs and services delivered by the Town of South Bruce Peninsula.&quot; The Legislative Services Department includes the Clerk&#x27;s Division, By-Law Enforcement and Animal Control, and the Building Division.

==Town services==

The Parks &amp; Recreation Department services parks, playgrounds, athletic fields, ball diamonds, arena, aquatic programs and various programs. The town has Fire stations but policing is provided by the Ontario Provincial Police from the Wiarton Detachment.

There is one hospital in the town: Wiarton Hospital with emergency and ambulance services, with 22 beds. Nearby, though outside the town, is the Grey-Bruce Regional Health Centre in Owen Sound. The latter is larger and is the regional referral centre for Grey and Bruce counties with over 50 specialists on staff.

==Land ownership, Sauble Beach==
There has been some friction between the Town and the Saugeen First Nation because of continuing land claims in the Sauble Beach area. A settlement was mediated in 2014 but was subsequently rejected by South Bruce, leading to a lawsuit against the Town, to be heard in court no earlier than 2018.

Sauble Beach is the permanent year-round home to approximately 2,000 people. The cottage owners add thousands of seasonal community members. Cottage owners are uniquely split between those who own property outright and those with cottages on Native lands. (Years earlier, the Saugeen First Nation had successfully reclaimed the land that &quot;runs south from the Sauble Beach sign toward Southampton, 18 kilometres away&quot;, according to one news report.) A lease relationship exists between the Saugeen First Nation, the &quot;Chippewas of Saugeen&quot;, and cottagers who built seasonal homes on leased land in the a lakeside area between urban Southampton, Ontario and Sauble Beach. They pay an annual fee to the Saugeen First Nation. The current land lease agreement between the cottagers and the Saugeen First Nation remains in effect until April 30, 2021.

Some years ago, the Saugeen First Nation successfully reclaimed the land that &quot;runs south from the Sauble Beach sign toward Southampton, 18 kilometres away&quot;, according to one news report. The beach area to the south of Main St. in the community is referred to by the band as Sauble Park or South Sauble Beach Park. In addition to the south Sauble Beach, Ontario area, the Saugeen First Nation claims the rights to another stretch of the public beach, approximately 2 km long, west of Lakeshore Boulevard extending to a point between 1st St. South and 6th St. North. This claim has been in litigation since 1990 when the federal government started an action on behalf of the Saugeen First Nation, stating that the area is part of the Saugeen 29 Reserve. The band also filed its own claim in 1995.

In 2019, the Saugeen First Nation banned the driving and parking of vehicles on their South Sauble beach; the town had done so previously on their public beach.

<doc id="499268" wikidata="Q683111" url="?curid=499268" title="Visual programming language">
<text>In computing, a visual programming language (visual programming system, VPL, or, VPS), also known as diagrammatic programming, graphical programming or block coding, is a programming language that lets users create programs by manipulating program elements rather than by specifying them . A VPL allows programming with visual expressions, spatial arrangements of text and graphic symbols, used either as elements of syntax or secondary notation. For example, many VPLs are based on the idea of &quot;boxes and arrows&quot;, where boxes or other screen objects are treated as entities, connected by arrows, lines or arcs which represent relations. VPLs are generally the basis of low-code development platforms.

==Definition==
VPLs may be further classified, according to the type and extent of visual expression used, into icon-based languages, form-based languages, and diagram languages. Visual programming environments provide graphical or iconic elements which can be manipulated by users in an interactive way according to some specific spatial grammar for program construction.

The general goal of VPLs is to make programming more accessible to novices and to support programmers at three different levels

;Syntax
: VPLs use icons/blocks, forms and diagrams trying to reduce or even eliminate the potential of syntactic errors helping with the arrangement of programming primitives to create well-formed programs. 
;Semantics
: VPLs may provide some mechanisms to disclose the meaning of programming primitives. This could include help functions providing documentation functions built-in to programming languages. 
;Pragmatics
: VPLs support the study of what programs mean in particular situations. This level of support allows users to put artifacts created with a VPL into a certain state in order to explore how the program will react to that state. Examples: In AgentSheets or AgentCubes users can set games or simulations into a particular state in order to see how program would react. With the Thymio programming language users can bring a robot into a certain state in order to see how it will react, i.e., which sensors will be activated.

As of 2005, current developments try to integrate the visual programming approach with dataflow programming languages to either have immediate access to the program state, resulting in online debugging, or automatic program generation and documentation. Dataflow languages also allow automatic parallelization, which is likely to become one of the greatest programming challenges of the future.

The Visual Basic, Visual C#, Visual J# etc. languages of the Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) are not visual programming languages: the representation of algorithms etc. is textual even though the IDE embellishes the editing and debugging activities with a rich user interface. A similar consideration applies to most other rapid application development environments which typically support a form designer and sometimes also have graphical tools to illustrate (but not define) control flow and data dependencies.

Parsers for visual programming languages can be implemented using graph grammars.

== Types of visual languages ==

The following list is not mutually exclusive, as some visual programming environments may incorporate elements from multiple paradigms. The choice of visual programming paradigm often depends on the specific requirements of the application or the preferences of the users or the developers.

;Block-based programming
: Popularized by platforms like Scratch and Blockly, used in educational settings and for introductory programming.
;Flowcharts
: Widely used in software engineering and systems design for representing algorithms and processes.
;Drag-and-drop interfaces
:Commonly used in GUI design tools and development environments for creating user interfaces.
;Node graphs
: Frequently used in visual programming languages, game development, and dataflow systems.
;Dataflow programming
: Popular in parallel computing, signal processing, and visual programming environments.
;Iconic programming
: Used in various contexts for simplifying programming tasks, often associated with mobile app development.
;State machines
: Widely employed in game development, control systems, and modeling reactive systems.
;Sheet-based programming
: Found in spreadsheet applications and certain educational programming environments.
;Timeline-based programming
: Common in multimedia and animation software for sequencing events over time.
;Spatial programming
: Applied in certain interactive and 3D modeling environments.
;Form-based programming
: Used in applications where user input and graphical interfaces play a significant role, such as data entry applications.

== General-purpose visual languages ==
Most of the VPLs are designed for education or domain-specific usage where the target users are novice programmers. But there are some research projects try to provide a general-purpose visual programming language that can be used by mainstream programmers in any software project instead of using textual programming languages (like C, C++, Java, etc.).

For example, research projects such as Envision and PWCT are designed to achieve this goal. 
It&#x27;s common for a VPL to be developed using a textual programming language. Developing general-purpose VPLs allows the other way around. For example, a new textual programming language Compiler and Virtual Machine have been developed and maintained using visual programming for many years. This approach increased the abstraction level, thereby hiding unnecessary details. This increased level of abstraction enables developers to concentrate on the program&#x27;s overall structure and functionality instead of being entangled in the details of code syntax.

<text>Ye Jiangchuan (born November 20, 1960) is a Chinese chess grandmaster. He is the second Chinese player, after Ye Rongguang, to achieve the title of Grandmaster, which FIDE awarded him in 1993. On 1 January 2000, he became the first ever Chinese player to cross the 2600 elo rating mark.

==Career==

Born in Wuxi, Jiangsu, Ye learned chess when he was 17 years old, and at 20 he became national champion of China. He has altogether won the Chinese Chess Championship seven times (1981, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1994, 1996).

Ye has represented his country at numerous Chess Olympiads and Asian Team Chess Championships. He has been four times member of the Asia Team champions, a 12 times Olympiad participant. In his first appearance, in 1982, Ye won the individual silver medal on board four. His best team result in an Olympiad was in 1998 in Elista, where he was on the first board as the national team finished in fifth place.

Ye was 1995 and 1999 Champion of Dato&#x27; Tan Chin Nam Cup, and 2001 co-champion of same cup. He reached the 4th round (9–16th place) in the 2001 FIDE World Championship, where he was eliminated by Vassily Ivanchuk by ½–1½. He also reached the quarter-finals in the 2000 and 2002 FIDE World Cup.

Ye has played less frequently after becoming the chief coach of the Chinese national teams (men and women) in 2000. He was awarded the title of FIDE Senior Trainer in 2005. Ye&#x27;s highest world ranking was 17th in October 2000 and he had been consistently in the top 25 from 2000 to 2004.

<text>Peter Harry Steve Griffiths (24 May 1928 – 20 November 2013) was a British Conservative politician best known for gaining the Smethwick seat by defeating the Shadow Foreign Secretary Patrick Gordon Walker in the 1964 general election, against the national trend, by using anti-immigrant and racist rhetoric.

==Early life==
Griffiths was born in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, and attended West Bromwich Grammar School. He was educated at Leeds Teacher Training College and, after his National Service, studied for an external London University economics degree and a master&#x27;s degree in education at Birmingham University, while teaching in West Bromwich. From 1962, he was the head of Hall Green Road primary school, West Bromwich.

Griffiths was elected to Smethwick County Borough Council in 1955. At the 1959 election, he stood against Smethwick&#x27;s sitting Member of Parliament (MP) Patrick Gordon Walker for the first time, and succeeded in reducing Gordon Walker&#x27;s majority from 6,495 to 3,544. Griffiths became leader of the council&#x27;s Conservative group in 1960, serving as a local councillor until 1963 when he resigned to stand again for the Smethwick parliamentary seat in the forthcoming general election.

==Elected MP for Smethwick==

Labour&#x27;s victory in the 1964 election had been predicted, and Patrick Gordon Walker, who had been Shadow Foreign Secretary for 18 months, was expected to hold on to his seat. Instead, Griffiths gained the seat for the Conservatives on a 7% swing, in a county borough that had the highest percentage of recent immigrants to England. Racial discrimination was common in the constituency and nationally; the local Labour club operated a colour bar.

In what Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson later described as an &quot;utterly squalid&quot; campaign, Conservative party members were accused of having used the slogan &quot;If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Liberal or Labour&quot;. Colin Jordan, a British Neo-Nazi and leader of the British Movement, said that members of his group had produced the initial slogan as well as spread the poster and sticker campaign; Jordan&#x27;s group in the past had also campaigned on other slogans, such as: &quot;Don&#x27;t vote – a vote for Tory, Labour or Liberal is a vote for more Blacks!&quot;. Although Griffiths himself did not coin the phrase or approve its use, he declined to disown it. &quot;The Times&quot; quoted Griffiths as saying: &quot;I would not condemn any man who said that. I regard it as a manifestation of popular feeling&quot;, adding that the quote represented &quot;exasperation, not fascism&quot;. He denied that there was any &quot;resentment in Smethwick on the grounds of race or colour&quot;.

Griffiths&#x27; defeat of Gordon Walker resulted in Harold Wilson claiming in the House of Commons that Griffiths should &quot;serve his term here as a parliamentary leper&quot;. Conservatives urged the Speaker, Harry Hylton-Foster, to force Wilson to withdraw the comment. While the Speaker objected to such language, he refused to censure the Prime Minister, and order in the Commons chamber was not restored for ten minutes. In his maiden speech in the Commons, Griffiths pointed out the problems faced by local industry and drew attention to the fact that 4,000 families were awaiting local authority accommodation. Griffiths remained an alderman in Smethwick until 1966. He both supported and arranged for Smethwick council to purchase a row of houses with the intention of letting them exclusively to white families. The government&#x27;s Housing minister, Richard Crossman, was able to block this proposal by refusing the council permission to borrow the money required.

Griffiths was defeated by the actor and Labour candidate Andrew Faulds in the 1966 general election. Griffiths wrote his own account of his election in 1964. In &quot;A Question of Colour&quot; (1966), he said that he had &quot;no colour prejudice&quot;. In the book he considered South Africa to be &quot;a model of Parliamentary democracy&quot; and that &quot;Apartheid, if it could be separated from racialism, could well be an alternative to integration&quot;. Griffiths also blamed immigration from the Caribbean for the spread of disease.

==Later life and career==
In 1967, he became a lecturer in economics at Portsmouth College of Technology. After a year as an exchange professor in California, he returned to what became Portsmouth Polytechnic, until he returned to Parliament.

Griffiths unsuccessfully stood for Portsmouth North constituency at the February 1974 general election, but was elected for the seat at the 1979 general election. He held the constituency until the Labour landslide at the 1997 election, when he was defeated.

==Personal life and death==
He was married to Jeannette (née Rubery); the couple had a son and daughter.

Griffiths died on 20 November 2013, aged 85.

<text>Konsole is a free and open-source terminal emulator graphical application which is part of KDE Applications and ships with the KDE desktop environment. Konsole was originally written by Lars Doelle. It ls licensed under the GPL-2.0-or-later and the GNU Free Documentation License.

KDE applications, including Dolphin, Kate, KDevelop, Kile, Konversation, Konqueror, and Krusader, use Konsole to provide embedded terminal functionality via Kpart.

== Features ==

* Built-in support for bi-directional text display.
* Tabbed terminals. Tab titles update dynamically depending on the current activity in the terminal.
* Translucent backgrounds
* Split-view mode
* Directory and SSH bookmarking
* Customizable color schemes
* Customizable key bindings
* Notifications about silence or activity in a terminal
* Incremental search
* Can open Dolphin or the user&#x27;s preferred file manager at the terminal program&#x27;s current directory
* Export of output in plain text or HTML format
*Multiple profile support
*Text reflow

== Internals ==
Up to the KDE 4.0, Konsole internal functionality was split into a backend and frontend parts. The backend was represented by a terminal emulator (the DEC VT102 + xterm emulation program) and the frontend that included terminal display and user interface used to display output characters on a window screen or a printer.

With newer versions Konsole on Linux systems uses PTY (pseudoterminal interface) abstraction implemented by KPty KDE framework introduced in 2014.

<doc id="499291" wikidata="Q167021" url="?curid=499291" title="Zagros Mountains">
<text>The Zagros Mountains are a mountain range in Iran, northern Iraq, and southeastern Turkey. The mountain range has a total length of . The Zagros range begins in northwestern Iran and roughly follows Iran&#x27;s western border while covering much of southeastern Turkey and northeastern Iraq. From this border region, the range continues southeast to the waters of the Persian Gulf. It spans the southern parts of the Armenian highlands, and the whole length of the western and southwestern Iranian plateau, ending at the Strait of Hormuz. The highest point is Mount Dena, at .

==Geology==


The Zagros fold and thrust belt was mainly formed by the collision of two tectonic plates, the Eurasian Plate and the Arabian Plate. This collision mainly happened during the Miocene (about 25–5 mya or million years ago) and folded the entirety of the rocks that had been deposited from the Paleozoic (541–242 mya) to the Cenozoic (66 mya – present) in the passive continental margin on the Arabian Plate. However, the obduction of Neotethys oceanic crust during the Cretaceous (145–66 mya), and the continental arc collision in the Eocene (56–34 mya) both had major effects on uplifts in the northeastern parts of the belt.

The process of collision continues to the present, and as the Arabian Plate is being pushed against the Eurasian Plate, the Zagros Mountains and the Iranian plateau are getting higher and higher. Recent GPS measurements in Iran have shown that this collision is still active and the resulting deformation is distributed non-uniformly in the country, mainly taken up in the major mountain belts like Alborz and Zagros. A relatively dense GPS network which covered the Iranian Zagros also proves a high rate of deformation within the Zagros. The GPS results show that the current rate of shortening in the southeast Zagros is ~, dropping to ~ in the northwest Zagros. The north–south Kazerun strike-slip fault divides the Zagros into two distinct zones of deformation. The GPS results also show different shortening directions along the belt, normal shortening in the southeast, and oblique shortening in the northwest Zagros. The Zagros mountains were created around the time of the second ice age, which caused the tectonic collision, leading to its uniqueness.

The sedimentary cover in the SE Zagros is deforming above a layer of rock salt (acting as a ductile decollement with a low basal friction), whereas in the NW Zagros the salt layer is missing or is very thin. This different basal friction is partly responsible for the different topographies on either side of the Kazerun fault. Higher topography and narrower zone of deformation in the NW Zagros is observed whereas in the SE, deformation was spread more and a wider zone of deformation with lower topography was formed. Stresses induced in the Earth&#x27;s crust by the collision caused extensive folding of the preexisting layered sedimentary rocks. Subsequent erosion removed softer rocks, such as mudstone (rock formed by consolidated mud) and siltstone (a slightly coarser-grained mudstone) while leaving harder rocks, such as limestone (calcium-rich rock consisting of the remains of marine organisms) and dolomite (rocks similar to limestone containing calcium and magnesium). This differential erosion formed the linear ridges of the Zagros Mountains.

The depositional environment and tectonic history of the rocks were conducive to the formation and trapping of petroleum, and the Zagros region is an important area for oil production. Salt domes and salt glaciers are a common feature of the Zagros Mountains. Salt domes are an important target for petroleum exploration, as the impermeable salt frequently traps petroleum beneath other rock layers. There is also much water-soluble gypsum in the region.

===Type and age of rock===
The mountains are completely of sedimentary origin and are made primarily of limestone. In the Elevated Zagros or the Higher Zagros, the Paleozoic rocks can be found mainly in the upper and higher sections of the peaks of the Zagros Mountains, along the Zagros main fault. On both sides of this fault, there are Mesozoic rocks, a combination of Triassic (252–201 mya) and Jurassic (201–145 mya) rocks that are surrounded by Cretaceous rocks on both sides. The Folded Zagros (the mountains south of the Elevated Zagros and almost parallel to the main Zagros fault) is formed mainly of Tertiary rocks, with the Paleogene (66–23 mya) rocks south of the Cretaceous rocks and then the Neogene (23–2.6 mya) rocks south of the Paleogene rocks. The mountains are divided into many parallel sub-ranges (up to wide), and orogenically have the same age as the Alps.

Iran&#x27;s main oilfields lie in the western central foothills of the Zagros mountain range. The southern ranges of the Fars province have somewhat lower summits, reaching . They contain some limestone rocks showing abundant marine fossils.

== Highest peaks ==
The peaks that are at least 3800 meters high and have a topographic prominence of at least 300 meters:
==History==

The Zagros Mountains have significant ancient history. They were occupied by early humans since the Lower Paleolithic Period. The earliest human fossils discovered in Zagros belongs to Neanderthals and come from Shanidar Cave, Bisitun Cave, and Wezmeh Cave. The remains of ten Neanderthals, dating from around 65,000–35,000 years ago, have been found in the Shanidar Cave. The cave also contains two later &quot;proto-Neolithic&quot; cemeteries, one of which dates back about 10,600 years and contains 35 individuals. Evidence from later Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic occupations come from Yafteh Cave, Kaldar Cave near Khoramabad, and Warwasi, Malaverd near Kermanshah, Kenacheh Cave in Kurdistan, Boof Cave in Fars and a number of other caves and rock shelters. Signs of early agriculture date back as far as 9000 BC in the foothills of the mountains. Some settlements later grew into cities, eventually named Anshan and Susa; Jarmo is one archaeological site in this area. Some of the earliest evidence of wine production has been discovered in the mountains; both the settlements of Hajji Firuz Tepe and Godin Tepe have given evidence of wine storage dating between 3500 and 5400 BC.

A human metatarsal bone fragment from Wezmeh Cave has been analyzed and dated to the Neolithic period. The DNA from this bone fragment shows that it is from a distinct genetic group, which was not known to scientists before. He belongs to the Y-DNA haplogroup G2b, specifically its branch G-Y37100, and mitochondrial haplogroup J1d6. He had brown eyes, relatively dark skin, and black hair, although Neolithic pre Indo-European Iranians carried reduced pigmentation-associated alleles in several genes and derived alleles at 7 of the 12 loci, showing the strongest signatures of selection in ancient Eurasians. He did not contribute to the genetic makeup of early European farmers or modern Europeans. Instead, he was the most genetically similar to modern Iranian Zoroastrians, followed by Fars, Balochi, Brahui, Kalash and Georgians. Gallego-Llorente et al. (2016) believes that the Zagros Mountain was a plausible source of Eurasian ancestry in Central and South Asia, along with Kotias, which was inhabited by Caucasus Hunter-Gatherers. He cites archaeological evidence of eastward Neolithic expansions from the Near East.

During early ancient times, the Zagros was the home of various Pre Indo-European peoples such as the Hurrians, Guti, Kassites, Elamites, Turukku and Lullubi, (together with Semitic peoples such as Assyrians and Amorites on the western side) who periodically invaded the Sumerian, Akkadian and Assyrian cities of Mesopotamia. The mountains create a geographic barrier between the Mesopotamian Plain, which is in modern Iraq, and the Iranian plateau. A small archive of clay tablets detailing the complex interactions of these groups in the early second millennium BC has been found at Tell Shemshara along the Little Zab. Tell Bazmusian, near Shemshara, was occupied between 5000 BCE and 800 CE, although not continuously.

==Population==
The Zagros mountains have been inhabited by different groups of pastoralists and farmers for thousands of years. Current Pastoralist groups such as Lurs, Bakhtiari Lurs, Kurds or Qashqais move from their herds from the east slopes in summer (&quot;Yeylāgh&quot;) to the west slopes in winter (&quot;Gheshlāgh&quot;). Some major cities are located on the foothills of the Zagros mountains, including Sulaymaniyah, Kermanshah, Khorramabad, and Shiraz.

===Lurs===

The Lurs are an Iranic tribe, primarily inhabiting the Central, Western, and Southern Zagros. Cities inhibited by Lurs include Khorramabad, Borujerd, Malayer, Izeh, Shahr-e Kord, Yasuj. Lurs speak Luri and span across many provinces in Iran including Lorestan, Khuzestan, Chaharmahal and Bakthiari, Ilam, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, and Hamedan.

===Bakhtiari Lurs===
The Bakhtiaris are a Lur tribe from Iran, primarily inhabiting the Central and South Zagros. Major cities inhabited by Bakhtiaris include Masjed Soleyman, Izeh and Shahr-e Kord. A significant number of Bakhtiari still practice nomadic pastoralism.

===Kurds===
Kurds are another Iranic group found in the northwestern and the eastern Zagros Taurus mountain ranges, which spans southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran, northern Iraq, and northern Syria. The high altitude of the Zagros mountains produces a series of choke points and valleys perfect for agriculture and human development. It has also long defended the Kurds in times of war by acting as a natural barrier.

===Qashqai===
Qashqai people are a tribal confederation in Iran mostly of Turkic origin. Significant populations can be found in Central and South Zagros, especially around the city of Shiraz in the Fars province.

===Assyrians, Turks and Iranians===
The Zagros is also home to populations of Assyrians, Turkic peoples and Farsi speaking Iranians.

==Climate==
The mountains contain several ecosystems. Prominent among them are the forest and forest steppe areas with a semi-arid climate. As defined by the World Wildlife Fund and used in their Wildfinder, the particular terrestrial ecoregion of the mid to high mountain area is &quot;Zagros Mountains forest steppe&quot; (PA0446). The annual precipitation ranges from and falls mostly in winter and spring. Winters are severe, with low temperatures often below . The region exemplifies the continental variation of the Mediterranean climate pattern, with a snowy winter and mild, rainy spring, followed by a dry summer and autumn.

=== Glaciation ===
The mountains of the East-Zagros, the Kuh-i-Jupar (), Kuh-i-Lalezar () and Kuh-i-Hezar () do not currently have glaciers. Only at Zard Kuh and Dena some glaciers still survive. However, before the Last Glacial Period they had been glaciated to a depth in excess of , and during the Last Glacial Period to a depth in excess of . Evidence exists of a wide glacier fed along a long valley dropping approximately along its length on the north side of Kuh-i-Jupar with a thickness of . Under conditions of precipitation comparable to current climatic record-keeping, this size of glacier could be expected to form where the annual average temperature was between , but since conditions are expected to have been dryer during the period in which this glacier was formed, the temperature must have been lower.

==Flora and fauna==

=== Flora ===
Although currently degraded through overgrazing and deforestation, the Zagros region is home to a rich and complex flora. Remnants of the originally widespread oak-dominated woodland can still be found, as can the park-like pistachio/almond steppelands. The ancestors of many familiar foods, including wheat, barley, lentil, almond, walnut, pistachio, apricot, plum, pomegranate and grape can be found growing wild throughout the mountains. &quot;Quercus brantii&quot; (covering more than 50% of the Zagros forest area) is the most important tree species of the Zagros in Iran.

Other floral endemics found within the mountain range include: &quot;Allium iranicum&quot;, &quot;Astragalus crenophila&quot;, &quot;Bellevalia kurdistanica&quot;, &quot;Cousinia carduchorum&quot;, &quot;Cousinia odontolepis&quot;, &quot;Echinops rectangularis&quot;, &quot;Erysimum boissieri&quot;, &quot;Iris barnumiae&quot;, &quot;Ornithogalum iraqense&quot;, &quot;Scrophularia atroglandulosa&quot;, &quot;Scorzonera kurdistanica&quot;, &quot;Tragopogon rechingeri&quot;, and &quot;Tulipa kurdica&quot;.

=== Fauna ===
The Zagros are home to many threatened and endangered species, including the Zagros Mountains mouse-like hamster (&quot;Calomyscus bailwardi&quot;), the Basra reed-warbler (&quot;Acrocephalus griseldis&quot;) and the striped hyena (&quot;Hyena hyena&quot;). The Persian fallow deer (&quot;Dama dama mesopotamica&quot;), an ancient domesticate once thought extinct, was rediscovered in the late 20th century in Khuzestan Province, in the southern Zagros. Also, wild goats can be found almost all over the Zagros mountain range.
In the late 19th century, the Asiatic lion (&quot;Panthera leo persica&quot;) inhabited the southwestern part of the mountains. It is now extinct in this region.

The Luristan newt (&quot;Neurergus kaiseri&quot;) is a salamander endemic to a small section of the central Zagros Mountains in Iran. It lives in highland streams and is primarily aquatic. This newt is considered vulnerable to extinction due to poaching for the pet trade and habitat destruction. Climate change is predicted to strongly impact this species.

==Religion==
The entrance to the ancient Mesopotamian underworld was believed to be located in the Zagros Mountains in the far east. A staircase led down to the gates of the underworld. The underworld itself is usually located even deeper below ground than the Abzu, the body of freshwater which the ancient Mesopotamians believed lay deep beneath the earth.
The region was influenced by Mesopotamian and Hurrian religion in the Bronze and Iron Ages, and later by Zoroastrianism and Syriac Christianity. Today the vast majority of the population are Iranic and Turkic Muslims, with small numbers of Christians, mainly Assyrians and Armenians also extant.

<text>An inflatable boat is a lightweight boat constructed with its sides and bow made of flexible tubes containing pressurised gas. For smaller boats, the floor and hull are often flexible, while for boats longer than , the floor typically consists of three to five rigid plywood or aluminium sheets fixed between the tubes, but not joined rigidly together. Often the transom is rigid, providing a location and structure for mounting an outboard motor.

Some inflatable boats can be disassembled and packed into a small volume, so that they can be easily stored and transported. The boat, when inflated, is kept rigid cross-ways by a foldable removable thwart. This feature makes these boats suitable for liferafts for larger boats or aircraft, and for travel or recreational purposes.

==History==

===Early attempts===
There are ancient carved images of animal skins filled with air being used as one-man floats to cross rivers. These floats were inflated by mouth.

The discovery of the process to vulcanize rubber was made by Charles Goodyear in 1838, and was granted a US patent in 1844. Vulcanization stabilized the rubber, making it durable and flexible. In late 1843, Thomas Hancock filed for a UK patent, which was also granted in 1844, after the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company patent had been granted. In 1852, while traveling in England, Charles Goodyear discovered that Thomas Hancock&#x27;s company was producing vulcanized rubber and sued. Thomas Hancock had been shown a sample of Goodyear&#x27;s rubber in 1842, but had not been told the process that made it—and Hancock said he had developed his process independently. The last of the suits were settled in 1855. Shortly thereafter, several people expanded on experimentation of rubber coated fabrics.

In 1839 the Duke of Wellington tested the first inflatable pontoons. In 1840, the English scientist Thomas Hancock designed inflatable craft using his new methods of rubber vulcanization and described his achievements in &quot;The Origin and Progress of India Rubber Manufacture in England&quot; published a few years later.

In 1844–1845, British naval officer Lieutenant Peter Halkett developed two types of inflatable boats intended for use by Arctic explorers. Both were made of rubber-impregnated &quot;Mackintosh cloth.&quot; In the Halkett boat, the &quot;boat cloak&quot; served as a waterproof poncho or cloak until inflated, when it became a one-man boat. A special pocket held bellows for inflation, and a blade to turn a walking stick into a paddle. A special umbrella could double as a sail. Halkett later developed a two-man boat carried in a knapsack. When inflated, it could carry two men paddling on either side, and when deflated it served as a waterproof blanket for camping on wet ground. The Admiralty was sceptical about potential uses for Halkett&#x27;s designs; on 8 May 1845, Lord Herbert, First Secretary to the Admiralty, wrote to Halkett that &quot;My Lords are of an opinion that your invention is extremely clever and ingenious, and that it might be useful in Exploring and Surveying Expeditions, but they do not consider that it would be made applicable for general purposes in the Naval Service&quot;.

The Admiralty saw no use for Halkett&#x27;s designs in general naval service, but explorers liked this larger design. John Franklin bought one for the ill-fated 1845 expedition, in which the entire expedition party of 129 men and two ships vanished.

In his explorations along the Oregon Trail, and the tributaries and forks of the Platte River in 1842 and 1843, John C. Frémont recorded what may have been the first use of an inflatable rubber boat for travel down rivers and rapids in the Rocky Mountains. In his account of the expedition he described his boat:

Among the useful things which formed a portion of our equipage, was an India-rubber boat, 18 feet long, made somewhat in the form of a bark canoe of the northern lakes. The sides were formed by two airtight cylinders, eighteen inches in diameter, connected with others forming the bow and stern. To lessen the danger of accidents to the boat, these were divided into four different compartments, and the interior was sufficiently large to contain five or six persons, and a considerable weight of baggage.

In 1848, General George Cullum, the US Army Corps of Engineers, introduced a rubber coated fabric inflatable bridge pontoon, which was used in the Mexican–American War and later on to a limited extent during the American Civil War.

In 1866, four men crossed the Atlantic Ocean from New York to Britain on a three-tube raft called &quot;Nonpareil&quot;.

From 1900 to 1910, the development of rubber manufacturing enabled attempts at producing circular rubber inflatable boats, similar to modern coracles. These were only usable as rafts, and could only be propelled by paddling. In addition, they tended to crack at seams and folds due to the imperfect manufacturing process of the rubber.

===Modern inflatable boat===

In the early 20th century, independent production of inflatable boats began with the airship manufacturing company RFD in England and the Zodiac company in France. This was brought about by the development of rubber-coated fabrics for the airship industry.

Reginald Foster Dagnall, English designer and founder of RFD, switched in 1919 to the development of inflatable boats, using the coated fabric from hydrogen airships. The Air Ministry was impressed with trials of his boat on a lake near Guildford and began to give his firm contracts for the production of life-saving equipment.

Meanwhile, in France a similar pattern emerged. The airship company Zodiac began to develop inflatable rubber boats, and in 1934, invented the inflatable kayak and catamaran. These led to the modern Zodiac inflatable boat. The company became Zodiac Nautic in 2015.

Development continued after World War II with the discovery of new synthetic materials, such as neoprene and new adhesives, which allowed the boats to become sturdier and less prone to damage.

===World War II===
Submarine warfare in the Battle of the Atlantic led to casualties among warships and merchant ships. In the military, inflatable boats were used to transport torpedoes and other cargo. They also helped troops land in shallow water, and their compact size made overland transport possible. The US had two standard boats the LCRL and LCRS.

The Marine Raiders were originally trained to carry out raids and landings from Landing Craft Rubber Large (LCRL) inflatable boats carried by high speed transports. In August 1942 the submarines and carried elements of the 2nd Raider Battalion who carried out the Makin Island raid from LCRL inflatable boats. Invasions of the Battle of Arawe by the 112th Cavalry Regiment and parts of the Battle of Tarawa involved amphibious landings in inflatable boats against heavy enemy resistance.

One of the models, the Zodiac brand inflatable boat, became popular with the military, and contributed significantly to the rise of the civilian inflatable boat industry in Europe and in the United States. After World War II, governments sold surplus inflatable boats to the public.

===Post-war inflatables===
Inflatable liferafts were also used successfully to save crews of aircraft that ditched in the sea; bombing, naval and anti-submarine aircraft flying long distances over water being much more common from the start of WWII. In the 1950s, the French Navy officer and biologist Alain Bombard was the first to combine the outboard engine, a rigid floor and a boat shaped inflatable. The former airplane-manufacturer Zodiac built that boat and a friend of Bombard, the diver Jacques-Yves Cousteau began to use it, after Bombard sailed across the Atlantic Ocean with his inflatable in 1952. Cousteau was convinced by the shallow draught and good performance of this type of boat and used it as tenders on his expeditions.

The inflatable boat was so successful that Zodiac lacked the manufacturing capacity to satisfy demand. In the early 1960s, Zodiac licensed production to a dozen companies in other countries. In the 1960s, the British company Humber was the first to build Zodiac brand inflatable boats in the United Kingdom.

Some inflatables have inflated keels whose V-shape help the hull move through waves reducing the slamming effect caused by the flat hull landing back on the water surface after passing over the top of a wave at speed.

==Types==

Contemporary inflatable boats are manufactured using supported fabric. They are made of rubberized synthetic fabrics, PVC and polyurethane, providing light-weight and airtight sponsons. Depending on fabric choice, the fabric panels are assembled using either hot or cold manufacturing processes. Different styles of one-way valves are used to add or remove air, and some brands include inter-communicating valves that reduce the effect of a puncture.

Inflatable boats with transoms have an inflatable keel that creates a slight V-bottom along the line of the hull to improve the hull&#x27;s seakeeping and directional stability. These vessels are very light, so if powered with an engine, it is best to put weight in the bow area to keep the bow from rising while the boat is going up on plane.

People increasingly use inflatables for personal recreational use on lakes, rivers, and oceans—and for white water rafting and kayaking, and for scuba divers to reach dive sites. Users can deflate, fold, and store fabric bottom inflatable boats in compact bags, making them ideal for limited storage and quick, easy access.

Sail rigs are available for inflatable dinghies, kayaks, and catamarans. In keeping with the portability of the inflatable hull, sail attachments fold or disassemble to fit in a compact bundle. Leeboards on the sides perform the same function as a centerboard, so users can tack these boats into the wind.

===Rigid inflatable boat===

The modern rigid inflatable boat (RIB) is a development of the inflatable boat, which has a rigid floor and solid hull. The external shape of the hull lets it cut through waves more easily giving a more comfortable ride when traveling fast in rough conditions. The structure of the hull is capable of supporting a more powerful transom mounted outboard engine or even an inboard engine.

===Soft inflatable boat===
A soft inflatable boat (SIB) lacks the solid hull of a RIB and often has a removable slatted floor, so the boat can be deflated and transported in a car or other vehicle. Such boats have a low draft and are therefore useful for traveling across shallow water and beaching in places without landing facilities.

Some SIBs have a rigid transom that can support an outboard engine. Inflatable boats with transoms have an inflatable keel that creates a slight V-bottom along the line of the hull to improve the hull&#x27;s seakeeping and directional stability. These vessels are very light, so if powered with an engine, it is best to put weight in the bow area to keep the bow from rising while the boat is going up on plane.

Soft inflatable boats are available with several floor choices:
* Roll up slat floor
* Hard floor made of fiberglass, aluminum or wood panels
* Ribbed air floor (on inflatable rafts)
* High pressure air floor

==Uses==


Inflatables are commonly between long and are propelled by outboard motors of . Due to their speed, portability, and weight, inflatable boats are used in diverse roles:

Inflatable and rigid-hulled inflatable boats are often used for short scuba diving excursions.

The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea publishes recommended regulations for inflatable boats used in rescue operations. Some life rafts also contain additional inflatable sections to ensure that the raft self-rights in heavy seas.

Inflatable life rafts have also been used since the 1930s on military aircraft that operate over water.

These boats are often used by special-operations units of the armed forces of several nations, for such purposes as landing on beaches. Because inflatable craft can be stored compactly they can also be transported on midget submarines such as those operated by the Advanced SEAL Delivery System. They have also been used by other forces without government sponsorship, such as guerrillas and pirates.

Lifeguards use inflatable boats or jet skis to reduce the time to reach a swimmer in distress. Inflatables are also used in conjunction with larger rescue craft, such as the Y class lifeboat used with the Tamar and Severn class lifeboats.

They are used in a number of sporting events and for recreational purposes, such as whitewater rafting, inflatable rescue boat racing, water skiing and fishing.

==Transportation==

An inflatable boat can be transported in various ways:

Deflated and Packed: The most significant advantage of inflatable boats is their ability to be deflated, folded, and packed into a compact size. Once deflated, they can be stored in a carry bag and transported in the trunk of a car or the bed of a truck.

On a Trailer: If the inflatable boat is larger or if it has a hard bottom (like a RIB), it might be more convenient to transport it on a trailer. This is especially useful if the boat has an outboard motor attached.

On Roof Racks: Some individuals use roof racks on their vehicles to transport inflatable boats. The boat is either deflated and packed or partially inflated and secured on top of the car.

Using a Boat Dolly: For short distances, like moving the boat from a parking area to the water’s edge, a boat dolly or hand cart can be useful. These are especially handy for heavier inflatables or those with motors.

<doc id="499297" wikidata="Q57497" url="?curid=499297" title="Carl Stumpf">
<text>Carl Stumpf (; 21 April 1848 – 25 December 1936) was a German philosopher, psychologist and musicologist. He is noted for founding the Berlin School of experimental psychology. 

He studied with Franz Brentano at the University of Würzburg before receiving his doctorate at the University of Göttingen in 1868. He also tutored the modernist literature writer Robert Musil at the University of Berlin, and worked with Hermann Lotze, who is famous for his work in perception, at Göttingen. Stumpf is known for his work on the &quot;psychology of tones&quot;. He had an important influence on his students Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka who were instrumental in the founding of &quot;Gestalt&quot; psychology as well as Kurt Lewin, who was also a part of the Gestalt group and was key in the establishment of experimental social psychology in America. 

Stumpf is considered one of the pioneers of comparative musicology and ethnomusicology, as documented in his study of the origins of human musical cognition &quot;The Origins of Music&quot; (1911). He held positions in the philosophy departments at the Universities of Göttingen, Würzburg, Prague, Munich and Halle, before obtaining a professorship at the University of Berlin.

==Early life==
Carl Stumpf was born in Wiesentheid, Franconia, in the Kingdom of Bavaria, to a prominent family. His father was the country court physician, and his immediate family included scientists and academicians, like his grandfather, who studied eighteenth-century French literature and the philosophers Kant and Schelling. Stumpf showed precocious musical talent as a child, learning the violin by the age of 7. By age 10, he had learned five other instruments and wrote his first musical composition.

==Education==
Stumpf was sickly as a child so his early education was conducted at home with his grandfather as his tutor. Stumpf attended the local &quot;Gymnasium&quot;, where he developed a passion for philosophy, especially the works of Plato, before enrolling at the University of Würzburg at the age of 17. He spent one semester studying aesthetics and one studying law. Then, in his third semester, he met Franz Brentano, who taught Stumpf to think logically and empirically. Brentano&#x27;s lectures were also attended by Anton Marty, Carl van Endert, Ernst Commer, Ludwig Schütz, and Hermann Schell. Brentano also encouraged Stumpf to take courses on the natural sciences because he considered both the substance and methods of science important to philosophy. After two semesters of studying with Brentano and with encouragement from his mentor, he transferred to the University of Göttingen to study under Hermann Lotze, a German perceptual theorist. There he was awarded a doctorate in 1868. 

In 1869, he entered a seminary, intending to be a Catholic priest. However, he disagreed with the dogma of the papal infallibility so he returned to the University of Göttingen for his doctorate. He was awarded &quot;venia legendi&quot; for philosophy in 1870 after completing his thesis on mathematical axioms, which he wrote in Latin.

==Academic career==
Soon after, Stumpf was granted a position as an instructor at the University of Göttingen in the Department of Philosophy. There Stumpf met Ernst Weber and Gustav Fechner, and served as an observer in their psychological experiments. Their careful approach to a problem of aesthetics, specifically the visual appeal of rectangles of different proportions, appealed to Stumpf and reinforced the notion learned from Brentano that psychological acts or functions can be studied empirically.

In 1873, Stumpf returned to the University of Würzburg as a professor in the Department of Philosophy. Although he was forced to teach all of the philosophy and psychology courses due to Brentano&#x27;s forced departure from the university, Stumpf completed his first major psychological work, an examination of visual perception, particularly depth perception. He proposed a nativist explanation for depth perception, and his book has been cited as an outstanding early contribution to the debate between the &quot;nativist&quot; and &quot;empiricist&quot; views of perception. He disputed the Kantian notion of space as an &quot;a priori form of intuition&quot; in his book, &quot;On the Psychological Origin of the Presentation of Space&quot; (1873). He argued that the status of space is &quot;Teilvorstellung&quot; or a &quot;partial presentation&quot;, one that must be experienced as part of a broader presentation.

In 1894, Stumpf was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin. At Berlin, he also held an adjunct appointment as director of the Institute of Experimental Psychology at Berlin. The Institute originally occupied three dark rooms, but by 1920, had moved to twenty-five rooms in the former Imperial Palace. In 1896, Stumpf presided over the Third International Congress of Psychology, and delivered the inaugural address on the relation between mind and body; he advocated an interactionalist position that opposed the popular notion of psychophysical parallelism. Finally, from 1907 to 1908, Stump served as the rector of the University of Berlin.

===Phenomenology===
Stumpf began his work on the sensation and perception of tones, called &quot;Tonpsychologie&quot; (&quot;Tone Psychology&quot;), in 1875. Originally meant to be a four volume set, the first two volumes were published in 1883 and 1890, but the majority of the third volume was published as &quot;Konsonanz und Dissonanz&quot;. Considered his greatest contribution to psychology, the study employs a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical observations. He discusses intervals and series of tones, along with single tones. He distinguished between phenomena and mental functions, suggesting that phenomena such as tones, colors, and images are either sensory or imaginary. Stumpf termed the study of such phenomena as &quot;phenomenology&quot;. He did a wide range of studies of the phenomenological characteristics of the sounds of different instruments, the determinants of melody, tonal fusion, and the consonance and dissonance of tones. This research was made possible by the excellent collection of acoustic devices at the Institute of Physics. Stumpf&#x27;s work on phenomenology influenced Edmund Husserl, who is considered the father of the school of phenomenology. 

===Sensational phenomena===
In 1903 and 1904, Stumpf was involved in two well-publicized debunking episodes related to sensational phenomena. First, an engineer from Prague claimed to have invented a machine that could change photographs of sound waves into sound. Stumpf, after attending a demonstration, wrote an article challenging its legitimacy, causing it to never be heard about again. However, the case of Clever Hans, an apparently brilliant horse owned by Wilhelm von Osten, was even more sensational.

==Later years==
The majority of Stumpf&#x27;s later work did not include sensational or interesting research, like that of Clever Hans. With the outbreak of World War I, many students left the Institute of Experimental Psychology to fight in the war. Furthermore, the war between Germany and the allied nations disrupted many professional relationships he had with other psychologists. Stumpf retired from the University of Berlin in 1921 and was succeeded as director of the psychological institute by his former student, Wolfgang Köhler.

<doc id="499316" wikidata="Q1810119" url="?curid=499316" title="Tropicana Field">
<text>Tropicana Field (nicknamed &quot;The Trop&quot;) is a domed multipurpose stadium located in St. Petersburg, Florida, United States. &quot;The Trop&quot; has been the home of the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball (MLB) since the team&#x27;s inaugural season in 1998. The stadium is also used for college football, and from December 2008 to December 2017 was the home of the St. Petersburg Bowl, an annual postseason bowl game. The venue is the only nonretractable domed stadium in MLB. Tropicana Field is the smallest MLB stadium by seating capacity when obstructed-view rows in the uppermost sections are covered with tarps as they are for most Rays games.

Tropicana Field opened in 1990 and was originally known as the Florida Suncoast Dome. In 1993, the Tampa Bay Lightning moved to the facility and its name was changed to the ThunderDome until the team moved to its new home in downtown Tampa in 1996. In October 1996, Tropicana Products, a fruit juice company then based in nearby Bradenton, signed a 30-year naming rights deal.

Tropicana Field&#x27;s location and design (especially the ceiling catwalks) have been widely criticized, and it is often cited as one of the worst stadiums in MLB, which itself has cited the need to replace Tropicana Field as one of the primary obstacles to future expansion. 

In 2023, the Tampa Bay Rays announced a deal with local politicians to build Gas Plant Stadium, a new stadium near Tropicana Field at an expected cost of $1.2 billion, half of which would fall on taxpayers. The St. Petersburg City Council blocked a proposal to allow St. Petersburg citizens to express their view on the stadium subsidy in an advisory referendum.

Much of the translucent, fiberglass roof membrane of Tropicana Field was destroyed by Hurricane Milton on October 9, 2024. The stadium had been set up to serve as a base for relief workers. Due to the plans to break ground on a new stadium for the Rays, the future of the stadium is undetermined; the Rays plan to play their 2025 season at George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, with the possibility of a renovation by 2026.

==History==

After Tampa was awarded the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Tampa Bay Rowdies in the 1970s, St. Petersburg decided it wanted a share of the professional sports scene in the Tampa Bay area. City officials decided early on that the city would attempt to attract Major League Baseball. Possible designs for a baseball park or multipurpose stadium were proposed as early as 1983. One such design, in the same location where Tropicana Field would ultimately be built, called for an open-air stadium with a circus tent-like covering. It took several design cues from open-air Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, including fountains beyond the outfield wall.

Ultimately, city officials decided that a stadium with a fixed permanent dome was necessary for a prospective LB team to be viable in the area, due to its hot, humid summers and frequent thunderstorms. Construction began in 1986 in the hope that it would lure an MLB team to the facility.

===1990s===
The stadium was finished in 1990. It hosted the 1990 Davis Cup Finals that autumn, and several rock concerts, but still had no tenants. The venue helped make St. Petersburg a finalist in the MLB expansion for 1993, but it lost out to Miami and Denver. Rumors arose of the Seattle Mariners moving in the early part of the 1990s, and the San Francisco Giants came close to moving to the area, with Tampa Bay investors announcing their purchase of the team and its relocation in a press conference in 1992. However, the sale and move were blocked by National League owners, who voted against the deal in November 1992 under pressure from San Francisco officials and the then-owner of the Florida Marlins, Blockbuster Video Chairman H. Wayne Huizenga. A local boycott of Blockbuster Video stores occurred for several years thereafter.

The Suncoast Dome finally got a regular tenant in 1991, when the Arena Football League&#x27;s Tampa Bay Storm made their debut. Two years later, the National Hockey League&#x27;s Tampa Bay Lightning made the stadium their home for three seasons. In the process, the Suncoast Dome was renamed the ThunderDome. Because of the large capacity of what was basically a park built for baseball, several NHL and AFL attendance records were set during the Lightning and Storm&#x27;s tenures there.

Finally, in 1995, the ThunderDome received a baseball team when MLB expanded to the Tampa Bay area. Changes were made to the stadium and its naming rights were sold to Tropicana Products, which renamed it Tropicana Field in 1996. The relocation of the Lightning and Storm into what is now Amalie Arena in downtown Tampa upon its completion permitted &quot;The Trop&quot; to be vacated for conversion to baseball. A US$70 million renovation then took place—to upgrade a stadium that had cost $130 million to complete only eight years earlier. Ebbets Field was the model for the renovations, which included a replica of the famous rotunda that greeted Dodger fans for many years. The first regular-season baseball game took place at the park on March 31, 1998, when the Tampa Bay Devil Rays faced the Detroit Tigers, losing 11–6. Luis Gonzalez of the Tigers hit the first home run at the stadium, followed by Wade Boggs hitting the first Devil Rays homer later that game. Boggs also hit a home run for his 3,000th hit at Tropicana Field in 1999. Boggs&#x27; historic home runs are commemorated with golden seats and plaques where the balls landed in the right-field seats.

Although Tropicana was purchased by PepsiCo in 1998, the company refrained from making any changes to the park’s naming rights, as the brand is popular among the local fanbase.

===2000s===
The park was initially built with an AstroTurf surface, but it was replaced in 2000 by softer FieldTurf. A new version of FieldTurf, FieldTurf Duo, was installed prior to the 2007 season. It has always featured a traditional &quot;full dirt&quot; infield, instead of the &quot;sliding pits&quot; design that was common during the 1970s and 1980s, making it the first artificial turf field with a full dirt infield since Busch Stadium II in 1976. Since Tropicana Field does not need to convert between baseball and football, sliding pits, designed to save reconfiguration time, were unnecessary. Tropicana has hosted football games, but never during baseball season. On August 6, 2007, the AstroTurf warning track was replaced by brown-colored, stone-filled FieldTurf Duo.

Tropicana Field underwent a further $25 million facelift prior to the 2006 season. Another $10 million in improvements were added during the season. In 2006, the Devil Rays added a live cownose ray tank to Tropicana Field, located just behind the center field wall, in clear view of the play on the field. People can go up to the tank to touch the creatures. Further improvements prior to the 2007 offseason, in addition to the new FieldTurf, include additional family features in the right-field area, the creation of a new premium club, and several new video boards including a new Daktronics LED main video board that is four times larger than the original video board. The 2007 renovation also added built-in HDTV capabilities to the stadium, with Fox Sports Florida and WXPX airing at least a quarter of the schedule in HD in 2007 and accommodating the new video board&#x27;s 16x9 aspect ratio.

On September 3, 2008, in a game between the Rays and the New York Yankees, Tropicana Field had the first official use of instant replay in the history of MLB. The disputed play involved a home run hit above the left-field foul pole by Yankee Alex Rodriguez. The ball was called a home run on the field, but was close enough that the umpires opted to view the replay to verify the call. Later, the Trop had the first case of a call being overturned by instant replay, when a fly ball by Carlos Peña originally ruled a ground-rule double due to fan interference, was overturned and made a home run on September 19. The umpires determined that the fan in question, originally believed to have reached over the right-field wall, did not do so.

In October 2008, Tropicana Field hosted its first baseball postseason games as the Rays met the Chicago White Sox in the American League Division Series, the Boston Red Sox in the American League Championship Series (ALCS), and the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series. It hosted the on-field trophy presentations for the Rays when they became the American League Champions on October 19, following game 7 of the ALCS. Chase Utley hit the first World Series home run at Tropicana Field during the first inning of game 1 of the 2008 World Series. The Rays ended up losing the game 3–2 and eventually the World Series to the Phillies 4 games to 1.

Since 2008, the top third of the upper-deck seating has been tarped over, artificially reducing the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 36,048 for the 2008 regular season. It was further reduced to 35,041 for the 2008 postseason, since the 300-level Party Deck had been reserved by MLB as an auxiliary press area. On October 14, 2008, the Rays announced that the upper-deck tarps would be removed for the remainder of the postseason, starting with game 6 of the ALCS. This increased the capacity of the stadium to nearly 41,000, depending on standing-room-only tickets sold.

===2010s===

The first no-hitter pitched at Tropicana Field took place on June 25, 2010, thrown by Edwin Jackson of the Arizona Diamondbacks, who had been a member of the Rays from 2006 to 2008.

About one month after Jackson&#x27;s no-hitter, on July 26, 2010, Tropicana Field was the site of the first no-hitter in Rays&#x27; history when pitcher Matt Garza achieved the feat. Garza faced the minimum 27 batters, as the only opponent to reach base (on a walk) was erased by a double play hit by the following batter.

On June 24, 2013, in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, three Rays players – James Loney, Wil Myers, and Sam Fuld – hit consecutive home runs, a first at Tropicana Field.

Because of rioting in Baltimore, a series between the Rays and Baltimore Orioles in May 2015 was moved from Oriole Park at Camden Yards to Tropicana Field. The games were played with the Orioles serving as the home team and the Rays serving as the visiting team.

Due to severe flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area, the Houston Astros played one &quot;home&quot; series at Tropicana Field in August 2017 against the Texas Rangers, while the Rays were away on a previously scheduled road trip. This was only the fourth time games were moved to a neutral location due to weather. Coincidentally, in advance of Hurricane Irma arriving in the Tampa Bay area two weeks later, the Rays&#x27; home series against the New York Yankees was moved to Citi Field, the home stadium of the Yankees&#x27; crosstown rivals, the New York Mets.

In July 2018, a proposal was unveiled to replace the facility with Ybor Stadium. Later that year at the MLB Winter Owners Meeting, though, Tampa Bay Rays owner Stuart Sternberg announced that the Ybor stadium plan would not go forward. The current stadium lease between the Rays and the City of St. Petersburg runs through 2027. The city granted the Rays until December 31, 2018, to continue negotiations with Hillsborough County officials. Although MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has stated his support for &quot;the ballpark effort and [his] desire to be [help] in assisting all parties in finding a way to keep the Rays in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area&quot;, he also went on to say that the Rays should &quot;explore a path that is in the best interests of his club and Major League Baseball&quot;.

In addition, the relocation announcement sparked a flurry of redevelopment proposals submitted to the City of St. Petersburg. There are proposals to eliminate the structure completely, but efforts have been made to include the public in the debate using several community meetings.

For the 2019 season, Tropicana Field closed its upper decks, as part of efforts and renovations to &quot;create a more intimate, entertaining and appealing experience for our fans&quot;. This reduced the stadium&#x27;s capacity to around 25,000–the lowest in the league. The team&#x27;s average attendance in the 2018 season was only just over 14,000.

=== 2020s ===
From December 2020 to April 2021, the stadium hosted the professional wrestling promotion WWE, broadcasting its shows from a behind-closed-doors set called the WWE ThunderDome. Due to the start of the 2021 Tampa Bay Rays season, the promotion relocated to Yuengling Center in Tampa.

On January 26, 2021, seven different proposals to redevelop the Tropicana Field site were unveiled, some with and some without a new stadium.

The Gas Plant Stadium project is the latest proposal to replace Tropicana Field starting in the 2028 MLB season. This proposal has been approved by both the city of St. Petersburg and Pinellas County commissioners, although construction has not started yet. The Rays and Hines plan to begin building the stadium in early 2025, having it ready for Opening Day in 2028.

On October 9, 2024, while Hurricane Milton impacted the Tampa Bay region, strong winds tore through Tropicana Field&#x27;s fiberglass roof. Video showed pieces of the roof flapping in the wind, growing until large sections of the roof were missing. The field level was hosting a base camp for first responders for before and after the storm; at the time the roof ripped, nobody was on the field, and the Rays clarified that the stadium was not being used as a shelter during the hurricane, as a planned precaution of that scenario. According to a principal engineer with the firm that installed the roof in 1990, it had outlasted its original service life by nearly a decade. On October 31, 2024, the St. Petersburg City Council voted on $6.5 million in remediation. A detailed assessment shows the stadium can be repaired for about $55 million and be ready in time for the 2026 season. On November 14, 2024, the Rays announced they would play all of their home games for the 2025 season at George M. Steinbrenner Field, a nearby stadium that serves as the spring-training home of the New York Yankees. On November 21, 2024, St. Petersburg initially voted 4–3 to spend $23 million to fix the roof of Tropicana Field, but later reversed course. Unless the Rays return to the stadium after 2025, the last home game for the Rays at Tropicana Field was on September 22, 2024, where the Rays defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 4–3.

The Rays expressed their intent to resume play at Tropicana Field for Opening Day 2026. Major League Baseball has hired an independent adviser to monitor progress of construction to ensure completion by this deadline. In response to the team&#x27;s proposed deadline, City Administrator Rob Gerdes indicated that St. Petersburg is under no obligation to meet the deadline of Opening Day 2026. Gerdes stated “We look forward to cooperating to attempt to achieve the mutual goal of making Tropicana Field suitable for Major League Baseball games by opening day of the 2026 season. However, it is important to reiterate that the current Use Agreement governs the obligations of the parties and any correspondence between the City of St. Petersburg and the Tampa Bay Rays does not alter those obligations.” On January 27, 2025, St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch stated that Tropicana Field can be repaired in time for the 2026 baseball season.

==Design==

===Architectural===
The most recognizable exterior feature of Tropicana Field is the slanted roof. It was designed at an angle to reduce the interior volume to reduce cooling costs, and to better protect the stadium from hurricanes. The dome is supported by a tensegrity structure and is lit up with orange lights after the Rays win a home game. When the Minnesota Twins vacated the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome following the 2009 season and moved into Target Field in 2010, Tropicana Field became the only active MLB stadium with a fixed (i.e., not retractable) roof. The catwalks attached to the nonretractable roof have been rare, but occasional, obstructions in the way of batted balls.

The main rotunda, on the east end of the stadium, resembles the Ebbets Field rotunda on the interior. The walkway to the main entrance of the park featured, until the 2020 season, a long ceramic tile mosaic, made of 1,849,091 one-inch-square tiles. It was the largest outdoor tile mosaic in Florida, and the fifth-largest in the United States. It was sponsored by Florida Power Corporation, which is now a part of Duke Energy.

The primary 100-level concourse is at street level, with elevators, escalators, and stairs separating the outfield and infield sections, since the ground is at different grades on either side. The 200-level loge box concourse is further separated, and is carpeted, as it includes the entrances to most of the luxury suites. The 300-level concourse is the highest of the concourses.

=== Gates ===
Seven gate entrances/exits to Tropicana Field exist, numbered in a clockwise fashion. Gate 1 is the main entrance, known as the Rotunda, on the right-field side of the stadium. Gate 4 is a VIP-only entrance, while Gate 7 is for stadium and team personnel only.

===Dining and amenities===

Seating at Tropicana Field is arranged with odd sections on the third-base side and even sections on the first-base side. The hallway behind sections 133–149 is nicknamed &quot;Left Field Street.&quot; The hallway behind sections 136–150 is nicknamed &quot;Right Field Street.&quot; The 100-level seating wraps around the entire field with a 360° walkway. Behind the stadium&#x27;s batter&#x27;s eye is a center field common area, known as the Porch, which provides fans with open seating and standing room to watch games. The Porch, along with other facility improvements, was part of a multimillion-dollar renovation project that was completed before the start of the 2014 season. Loge boxes are featured along the infield of the 100-level from foul pole to foul pole; 200-level seating features 20 sections along the foul lines, broken by the press box behind home plate, with the luxury boxes directly behind and above them. The 300-level seating wraps around the infield along the lines, and also features the &quot;Party Deck&quot;, a small-capacity seating area above the left-field outfield seats with separate concessions inside; initially sponsored by tbt*, the Party Deck has been sponsored by GTE Financial since the 2019 season. Rows are lettered starting closest to home plate and rise further away. Seats are numbered starting at the left side of the section.

Of 70 luxury suites, 48 are accessible from the 200-level, while the other 15 are located on the 100-level.

In total. 2,776 club seats are available at Tropicana Field. The Dex Imaging Home Plate Club features its own entrance, recliner seats, and a premium buffet with in-seat service. The second club section, the Rays Club, is along the first-base side on the 100-level at the Loge Box level. It features its own premium buffet and premium seating.

The MacDillville section located on the right-field line, behind the Rays&#x27; bullpen, is reserved for the 24 tickets that the Rays provide to personnel returning from deployment, families of deployed personnel, and staff assigned to MacDill Air Force Base.
Field-level party sections were installed in the corners in 2006. The left-field party section is available for groups of 75-136 people and named &quot;162 Landing&quot;, in reference to Evan Longoria&#x27;s walk-off home run in the 162nd and final regular-season game of the season that landed in that section, which clinched the American League wild card for the Rays. In 2017, the section was renamed after the Tampa sports bar, &quot;Ducky&#x27;s&quot; that is featured in the Porch, and co-owned by Longoria; the Ducky&#x27;s branding was removed following the trade of Longoria to the San Francisco Giants before the 2018 season, and 162 Landing has been sponsored by Hard Rock Café since the 2018 season. The right-field party section,e &quot;Papa John&#x27;s Bullpen Box&quot;, is available for groups of 50–85. When the right-field corner was sponsored by the fast-food chain Checkers, tickets to the &quot;Checkers Bullpen Cafe&quot; included a free meal at the Checkers kiosk immediately adjacent to the section. As of 2008, both party sections featured all-you-can-eat buffets.

In 2019, the Rays introduced the Left Field Ledge, a party section above the section of the 360 walkway behind left field, offering tables for groups of eight and patio boxes for groups of 12 to 24.

The St. Anthony&#x27;s Fan Care Clinic is located between Gates 3 and 4 on the 100 level, section 102 (behind home plate). St. Anthony&#x27;s Health Medical Team staffs the clinic and offers first aid services to fans. A Baby Care Suite located on the 300 level near section 300 features baby-changing stations and private nursing suites.

One of the team&#x27;s two main apparel stores is located in the stadium, near Gate 1. The other main store, the Tampa Pro Shop and Ticket Outlet, is located in Tampa. Many specialty, smaller stores are located throughout the stadium, including a &quot;Game-Used Merchandise&quot; store located in Center Field Street.

===The Rays Touch Tank===

Just over the right-center-field fence is the Rays Touch Tank. This , tank is filled with three different species of rays, including cownose rays that were taken from Tampa Bay waters. The tank is one of the 10 biggest in the nation. Admission to the tank area is free for all fans attending home games, but a limit of 40 people are allowed in the area at any given time. The tank is open to fans about 20 minutes after the gates open, and closes to the public two hours after the first pitch. Fans get to see the rays up close and get to learn educational information about them.

The tank and rays are sponsored and maintained by the Florida Aquarium (where they also reside during the offseason), which educates people about rays and other aquatic life.

For every ball hit into the tank during a game by a Rays player, the Rays had donated $5,000 to charity with $2,500 going to the Florida Aquarium and $2,500 going to that player&#x27;s charity of choice. As of the 2021 season, the netting over the tank was extended to fully enclose the area, removing the possibility of a home-run ball entering the tank.

Before that, only two Rays players hit a home run that landed in the tank:
* Denotes walk-off home run.

In addition, only five players hit home runs into the tank playing for opposing teams:
===Concessions===
Behind center field on the stadium&#x27;s ground level near the main rotunda entrance is a two-story, full-service restaurant and recreational area called BallPark &amp; Rec, opened in 2018. The restaurant&#x27;s second floor features an outdoor area with lawn games, and an indoor arcade area. This restaurant took over the location previously occupied by Everglades Brewhouse, which served several craft beers in addition to having a full liquor bar and opened two hours before first pitch. A &quot;Fan vs. Food&quot; challenge at Everglades was introduced in 2014, which consists of eating a burger and a pound of French fries in under 30 minutes to win two future Rays game tickets and a T-shirt.

Various other concession stands are located behind center field and along the outer rim of the stadium along the base lines, collected in three concourses named Center Field Street, First Base Food Hall, and Third Base Food Hall. These stands frequently change from season to season, are often named after or maintained by stadium sponsors, or are themed after notable Rays figures, such as the Rocco Ball Deli, themed after former Rays player and coach Rocco Baldelli, which was open for the 2018 season until Baldelli was hired by the Minnesota Twins in 2019. Current and former concessions include the Taco Bus, the Wine Cellar, The Carvery, Pipo&#x27;s, Papa John&#x27;s Pizza, Fish Shack, Everglades BBQ, a full service liquor bar, Bay Grill and the Craft Beer Corner featuring many local craft brewery&#x27;s including Big Storm Brewing, Cigar City, Green Bench, Sea Dog and 3 Daughters. Green Bench Brewing offers a special edition brew just for the Rays called 2-Seam Blonde Ale.

In addition to these concessions, Tropicana Field previously hosted a concession stand for Outback Steakhouse, a Tampa Bay-based establishment. To compete with established stadiums&#x27; hot dog traditions, the Trop introduced the &quot;Sting &#x27;Em&quot; Dog in 2007. This consists of a regular hot dog topped with chili and cheese. It was renamed &quot;The Heater&quot; in 2008.

===Ted Williams Museum/Hitters Hall of Fame===
For a list of inductees and recipients of various awards, see footnote
The Ted Williams Museum and Hitters Hall of Fame opened in February 1994, in Hernando, Florida, in Citrus County—just a few blocks from the place where Williams lived in his later years.

In 2006, the museum and hall of fame were moved to Tropicana Field after its original facility in Hernando went bankrupt. A new upstairs wing was opened in 2007, which now houses the exhibits on Ted Williams&#x27;s careers with the Boston Red Sox and with the United States Marine Corps during World War II and the Korean War, as well as the monuments to the members of the Hitters Hall of Fame complete with memorabilia, with donated authentic memorabilia wherever possible and many of Williams&#x27;s own personal mementos from his career and post-playing life. Williams did not induct himself into his own Hitters Hall of Fame, and was inducted in 2003 only after he died.

The museum also includes a &quot;Pitching Wall of Great Achievement&quot;, the Negro leagues wing—including an exhibit about John Jordan &quot;Buck&quot; O&#x27;Neil (a &quot;son&quot; of Sarasota)—the &quot;500 Homerun Club&quot; exhibit, and exhibits about other topics, including the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League and the Tampa Bay Rays. The museum often hosts autograph signings and charity auctions during or before games.

The museum is open during game days, opening at the same time as the park and closing after the seventh inning with the concession stands. Admission is free, and the museum is open to all ticketholders. In 2012, the museum was open until the 9th inning, but still open only on game days. As of the last week of the 2012 season, the museum was back to closing by the seventh inning (beginning of, not after the inning) and the open-only-on-game-days policy is still in effect.

==Notable events==

===Basketball===
In 1998, Tropicana Field was a regional final site for the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament. A year later, the stadium played host to the 1999 Final Four which had the Connecticut Huskies beat the Duke Blue Devils 77–74 for the championship. Subsequently, no other NCAA men&#x27;s basketball game has yet been played at Tropicana Field.

===Football===
ArenaBowl IX was held at the venue in 1995.

In 2008, the NCAA announced that Tropicana Field would be host to a postseason college bowl game, bringing football to the dome. The game, which eventually took on the name Gasparilla Bowl, was played inside Tropicana Field until 2017, after which the bowl organizers moved the annual contest to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.

The Trop returned to a football configuration on October 30, 2009, to host one of the three home games of the Florida Tuskers of the United Football League, in which the Rays had invested.

The East–West Shrine Game, a postseason college football all-star game played annually since 1925, was played at Tropicana Field from 2012 until 2019.

===Hockey===
Tropicana Field, then known as the ThunderDome, holds the record for the highest attendance for a Stanley Cup playoffs game, set on April 23, 1996, with 28,183 fans. At the time, this was the largest-ever crowd at an NHL game, which stood until the 2003 Heritage Classic. This still stands the attendance record for a game played at a team&#x27;s regular home stadium, as all NHL games with a higher attendance were part of the NHL&#x27;s Winter Classic, Heritage Classic, or Stadium Series.

===Motorsports===
The World of Outlaws Sprint Cars raced at the Suncoast Dome on February 7–9, 1992 as a part of Florida Speedweeks with several tracks hosting events during the month.

An SCCA Trans-Am Series race was held in 1996 and 1997 on a temporary course encompassing the parking lot and surrounding streets.

===Concerts===
Tropicana Field has hosted many concerts over the years; one of the first large events upon its completion was a concert by Don Henley on June 29, 1990. Many well-known artists have held concerts at the venue, including Eric Clapton (twice), David Bowie, Janet Jackson (twice), Steely Dan, AC/DC (twice), Guns N&#x27; Roses, Billy Joel (twice), Robert Plant, Rush (twice), R.E.M., the Eagles, Depeche Mode, Rod Stewart, Kiss, and Van Halen (twice), among others. The venue&#x27;s largest concert attendance was for the boy band New Kids on the Block in August 1990.

The number of large concerts at Tropicana Field has decreased considerably since the (Devil) Rays were established in 1998, as the club&#x27;s 81-game home schedule makes scheduling difficult, especially during the summer concert season. Also, the development in nearby Tampa of Amalie Arena (opened in 1996) and the MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre (opened in 2004) into busy concert venues has further curtailed the concert slate at Tropicana Field.

====Rays Summer Concert Series====
Beginning in 2007, the Rays organized a &quot;Summer Concert Series&quot; in which a mix of major and lesser-known performers of many different musical genres performed after select home games for no extra charge beyond the price of the game ticket. The concerts were usually scheduled after Friday- or Saturday-night games, with more kid-oriented acts performing after Sunday-afternoon games. The usual procedure was for a portable stage to be rolled out onto centerfield immediately after the final out of the ballgame, with the music starting soon thereafter. For most shows, fans were allowed to come down onto the playing field to watch the performance up close.

The first after-baseball concert featured nostalgia act Sha Na Na in June 2007. The event was so successful that the Rays booked a series of shows for the following season, usually increasing attendance for those games. Participating artists have included The Beach Boys, Los Lobos, LL Cool J, Sister Hazel, Kacey Musgraves, The Jacksons, REO Speedwagon, ZZ Top, Weezer, Kenny Loggins, Avril Lavigne, Joan Jett, and The Wiggles, among many others, totaling over 80 shows in all.

In some seasons, the number of postgame concerts was as high as a dozen. The number dwindled to two in 2017, and before the 2018 season, the Rays announced that they would discontinue the concert series due to &quot;stress on the artificial turf&quot;.

On April 27, 2023, the Rays announced that the Summer Concert Series would return to celebrate their 25th anniversary season. The first artist announced was AJR, who would perform after the Friday, May 19 game against the Milwaukee Brewers. The concert proved to be a success, and the team soon announced two more acts, Lee Brice on Friday, August 11, and the &quot;I Love The 90&#x27;s&quot; Tour, featuring Vanilla Ice, Rob Base, Montell Jordan, and Tone Loc, on Friday, September 8.

=== Professional wrestling ===
On December 11, 2020, professional wrestling promotion WWE began broadcasting its weekly shows, &quot;Raw&quot;, &quot;SmackDown&quot;, and &quot;Main Event&quot;, and their associated pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming events from Tropicana Field in a residency. The programs were filmed behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic in a biosecure bubble called the WWE ThunderDome, which had been relocated from Orlando&#x27;s Amway Center due to the start of the 2020–21 ECHL and NBA seasons, as the Amway Center is the shared home of the Orlando Solar Bears and the Orlando Magic.

Through the arrangement, Tropicana Field hosted the pay-per-views , Royal Rumble, Elimination Chamber, and Fastlane—the final PPV before WrestleMania 37 (hosted by Raymond James Stadium in nearby Tampa)—as well as the 2021 WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony, and WWE Superstar Spectacle (a WWE Network event produced primarily for the Indian market). As the 2021 MLB season approached, on March 24, 2021, WWE announced that the ThunderDome would be relocated to the Yuengling Center in Tampa, beginning with the April 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the night after WrestleMania 37. WWE&#x27;s final show filmed at Tropicana Field was the April 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, which was taped the week prior on April 2.

WWE would return to Tropicana Field for the 2024 Royal Rumble event, which set an attendance record of a reported 48,044 fans.

==Criticism==

===Location===
Tropicana Field sits on in the Midtown community of St. Petersburg, Florida. The land the stadium and its parking lots now occupy was occupied by the Gas Plant neighborhood from the late 1800s until 1986.

In the late 1800s, St. Petersburg began a large recruitment initiative to attract people to help build the city&#x27;s infrastructures and fill lower-income service jobs. African Americans began to move to St. Petersburg from across the south looking to fill these jobs. The influx of African Americans in the area brought the formation of many black communities, including the Gas Plant district. The area housed nearly 800 people, many African-American-owned small businesses and three African-American churches. The district&#x27;s name came from the two fuel tanks that originally stood where Tropicana Field now stands.

In 1979, the St. Petersburg City Council voted to refurbish the neighborhood, as it had &quot;seen better days.&quot; This plan promised to create new, modern, affordable housing and an industrial park that would bring many new jobs to the area. By 1982, developers had offered no proposals for the refurbishment of the district to the city council, even after the council specifically requested the proposals. A group of Pinellas County business people offered a plan to the council that entailed building a baseball stadium, in hopes of attracting a major league team to the area. That year, the council voted unanimously to follow through with the baseball hopes and lease the land to the sports authority for $1 a year.

Most African Americans who used to live or work in the neighborhood felt betrayed by the city and bitter over the baseball development. The city had offered, and followed through with, many reparation programs for the residents and businesses of the Gas Plant district when the district was originally to be refurbished, including financial relocation help, but these programs were welcomed only on the basis that the area would be once again a functional community. When that stipulation changed, residents were angered and new reparation plans were rumored, but never came to fruition. As for the churches of the area, relocation offers extended to them from the City Council were &quot;generous&quot; according to one of the churches&#x27; pastors. This is believed to be because of the political power that the churches held.

The destruction of the Gas Plant district and the city&#x27;s shortcomings in securing economic and employment opportunities for the displaced African American community have left a jagged relationship between city officials and the aforementioned African-American community. The destruction of the Gas Plant district financially crippled and killed many African-American-owned small businesses and is often referred to as the main reason that only 10% of St. Petersburg&#x27;s small businesses are African-American-owned today.

The dome was built on the former site of a coal gasification plant, and,in 1987, hazardous chemicals were found in the soil around the construction site. The city spent millions of dollars to remove the chemicals from the area.

It is often criticized as being located away from the Tampa Bay area&#x27;s largest population base in Tampa.

===Catwalks===
Among the most cited criticisms about the stadium are the four catwalks that hang from the ceiling. The catwalks are part of the dome&#x27;s support structure. The stadium was built with cable-stayed technology similar to that of the defunct Georgia Dome. It also supports the lighting and speaker systems. Because the dome is tilted toward the outfield, the catwalks are lower in the outfield.


The catwalks are lettered, with the highest inner ring being the A Ring, out to the farthest and lowest, the D Ring. The A Ring is entirely in play, while the B, C, and D Rings have yellow posts bolted to them to delineate the relative position of the foul lines. Any ball touching the A Ring, or the in-play portion of the B Ring, can drop for a hit or be caught for an out. The C and D Rings are out of play; if they are struck between the foul poles, then the ball is ruled a home run.

On August 5, 2010, Jason Kubel of the Minnesota Twins hit a sky-high infield pop-up that would have ended the inning in a 6–6 game if caught, but the ball struck the A ring and fell safely onto the infield, allowing the Twins to score the go-ahead run and extend the inning in a controversial 8–6 win. As a result, on October 4, 2010, Major League Baseball approved a change in the ground rules for the A and B rings, making it so that a batted ball striking either of the two rings was automatically ruled a dead ball, regardless of whether the ball strikes in fair or foul territory. The rules pertaining to the C and D rings remained the same. This change lasted for just the 2010 postseason.

Several potential hits, though, have been lost as a result of the catwalks. For example, on May 12, 2006, Devil Rays outfielder Jonny Gomes hit a long fly ball against the Toronto Blue Jays that seemed destined to be a home run before it hit the B ring, got stuck momentarily, and then rolled off and was caught by Toronto shortstop John McDonald as Gomes was headed for home plate. Although Rays manager Joe Maddon tried to argue that it should have been at least a ground rule double since it stayed in the B Ring for a while before coming loose, umpires eventually ruled against the Rays and called Gomes out.

On May 26, 2008, Carlos Peña hit a pop fly to center field that likely would have been caught by Texas Rangers center fielder Josh Hamilton. The ball instead hit the B ring catwalk and did not come down. Peña was mistakenly given a home run, but after deliberation, the umpires awarded him a ground rule double. This was the second time this had happened, as José Canseco hit a ball that stuck in the same catwalk on May 2, 1999.

Many players have hit the C and D rings for home runs. The first player to hit the rings for a home run was Edgar Martínez of the Seattle Mariners on May 29, 1998. Martinez&#x27;s home run went off the D ring. Three players before him hit balls that went into the C ring, but at the time, balls hitting the C ring were not ruled home runs. Two days prior to Martinez&#x27;s home run, the ground rules were changed so that if a ball hit the C ring, it would be called a home run. The first player to hit the rings for a home run in postseason play was Rays third baseman Evan Longoria, who hit the C ring off Javier Vázquez of the Chicago White Sox on October 2, 2008, in the second inning of game 1 of the 2008 American League Division Series.

On July 17, 2011, against the Red Sox, Rays batter Sean Rodriguez hit a high foul popup that shattered a lightbulb on a catwalk. Pieces of the broken bulb fell to the turf near the third-base coach&#x27;s box. After a quick cleaning delay in which the Tropicana Field public address system played the theme to &quot;The Natural&quot; (a 1984 film that prominently features a hit baseball striking and shattering a stadium light fixture), the game resumed.

Another ceiling-related incident came in June 2018, when New York Yankees outfielder Clint Frazier&#x27;s 9th-inning fly ball bounced off a speaker hanging from the B ring and was caught by Rays shortstop Adeiny Hechavarria for an out. Some suggest that the ball would have traveled far enough for a home run, which would have broken a 6–6 tie. The Rays won the game in extra innings with a walk-off home run.

===Bullpens===
The bullpens are located along (and close to) the left and right field foul lines and no barriers separate them from the field of play. In fact, fly balls hit into the bullpens are in play. The bullpen players and the pitching mounds are obstacles for fielders chasing fly balls into the pens. Teams have to station a batboy behind the catchers in the bullpens to prevent them from being hit by foul balls from behind. This style of bullpen used to be common in the major leagues, but is currently in use only at Tropicana Field (the Oakland Coliseum has this feature, but the stadium does not have an MLB tenant following the departure of the Oakland Athletics following the 2024 season).

===Interior===

Another criticism of the stadium is the drab interior environment, especially early in the (Devil) Rays&#x27; existence, when the stark concrete interior was compared to a large warehouse. However, since it was designed specifically for baseball, it is somewhat smaller and the sightlines are better than in most domed stadiums, which are often built to accommodate other sports, as well.

The current Rays&#x27; Stuart Sternberg-led ownership group has invested several million dollars over the past decade to make the venue more fan friendly. New or improved features include a larger scoreboard, video wall, catwalk sleeves, an outfield touch-tank featuring cownose rays, a walk-around that circles the entire field, two concession and gathering areas in the outfield, and many other additions and upgrades designed to improve the fan experience.

<text>Max Harmonist (Berlin, 10 February 1864 – 16 October 1907) was a leading German chess master. He was probably the only famous chess player to have been by profession a ballet dancer. He often performed in the royal ballet.

He became famous after winning a game at Frankfurt 1887 against Isidor Gunsberg, widely regarded as one of the strongest masters of that period. In the same tournament he also beat Joseph Blackburne (who placed 2nd) and Emil Schallopp.

In tournaments, he was 1st–4th at Berlin 1883, took 3rd at Berlin 1883, won at Hamburg 1885 (Hauptturnier), won at Berlin 1887, took 21st at Frankfurt 1887, tied for 4–5th at Berlin 1888, tied for 4–5th at Nuremberg 1888, tied for 15–16th at Breslau 1889, and tied for 5–8th at Berlin 1890.

<text>Gabriel Cramer (; 31 July 1704 – 4 January 1752) was a Genevan mathematician.

== Biography ==
Cramer was born on 31 July 1704 in Geneva, Republic of Geneva to Jean-Isaac Cramer, a physician, and Anne Mallet. The progenitor of the Cramer family in Geneva was Jean-Ulrich Cramer, Gabriel&#x27;s great-grandfather, who immigrated from Strasbourg in 1634. Cramer&#x27;s mother, a member of the Mallet family, was of Huguenot origin. Cramer showed promise in mathematics from an early age. In 1722, aged 18, he received his doctorate from the Academy of Geneva, and at 20 he was made co-chair (along with Jean-Louis Calandrini) of mathematics at the Academy. 

He became the sole professor of mathematics in 1734 and was appointed professor of philosophy at the Academy in 1750. Cramer was also involved in the politics of the Republic of Geneva, entering first the Council of Two Hundred in 1734 then the Council of Sixty in 1750. He was a member of the science academies of Bologna, Lyon, and Montpellier, as well as a foreign member of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin. Cramer died on 4 January 1752 at Bagnols-sur-Cèze while traveling in southern France to restore his health.

== Contributions to mathematics ==

In 1728, Cramer proposed a solution to the St. Petersburg Paradox that came very close to the concept of expected utility theory given ten years later by Daniel Bernoulli. He did extensive travel throughout Europe in the late 1730s, which greatly influenced his works in mathematics.

Cramer published his best-known work in his forties. This included his treatise on algebraic curves (1750). It contains the earliest demonstration that a curve of the &quot;n&quot;-th degree is determined by &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot; + 3)/2 points on it, in general position (see Cramer&#x27;s theorem (algebraic curves)). This led to the misconception that is Cramer&#x27;s paradox, concerning the number of intersections of two curves compared to the number of points that determine a curve.

Cramer edited the works of the two elder Bernoullis, and wrote on the physical cause of the spheroidal shape of the planets and the motion of their apsides (1730), and on Newton&#x27;s treatment of cubic curves (1746).

In 1750 he published Cramer&#x27;s rule, giving a general formula for the solution for any unknown in a linear equation system having a unique solution, in terms of determinants implied by the system. This rule is still standard.

<text>Ejersa Goro () is a town in eastern Ethiopia. Located outside the city of Harar in the East Hararghe Zone of the Oromia Region, it has a latitude and longitude of and an elevation of 2780 meters above sea level. It is the administrative center of Jarso Aanaa.

==Overview==
According to the Oromia Regional government website, this town has access to telephone and postal service, but lacks electricity.

===History===
Ejersa Goro is best known as the birthplace of Emperor Haile Selassie I, the tenth child of Ras Makonnen, then governor of Harar, and Woizero Yeshimebet Ali, on July 23, 1892. The Emperor later erected a church, Kidane Mihret (&quot;Our Lady Covenant of Mercy&quot;), in the town to commemorate the event; when John Graham visited the town in 2001, although Ras Makonnen&#x27;s house had been reduced to a &quot;circle of rocks&quot;, Kidane Mihret was still standing and in use, although in worse repair than the mosque across town.

Early in the Ogaden War, Ejersa Goro was captured by Somali units; it was recaptured between 5 and 9 February 1978 by Ethiopian units advancing from Kombolcha.

==Demographics==
Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, Ejersa Goro has an estimated total population of 3,104 of whom 1,529 are men and 1,575 are women.

The 1994 national census reported a total population for this town of 1,736 of whom 829 were men and 907 were women. These numbers for Ejersa Goro are an estimate, because the town was not counted. This also means that breakdown by ethnic groups, language speakers, religion, et cetera, are not available.

<doc id="499335" wikidata="Q2910702" url="?curid=499335" title="Carvel (boat building)">
<text>Carvel built or carvel planking is a method of boat building in which hull planks are laid edge to edge and fastened to a robust frame, thereby forming a smooth surface. Traditionally the planks are neither attached to, nor slotted into, each other, having only a caulking sealant between the planks to keep water out. Modern carvel builders may attach the planks to each other with glues and fixings. It is a &quot;frame first&quot; method of hull construction, where the shape is determined by the framework onto which the planks are fixed. This is in contrast to &quot;plank first&quot; or &quot;shell first&quot; methods, where the outer skin of the hull is made and then reinforced by the insertion of timbers that are fitted to that shape. The most common modern &quot;plank first&quot; method is clinker construction; in the classical period &quot;plank first&quot; involved joining the edges of planks with mortise and tenon joints within the thickness of the timbers, superficially giving the smooth-hull appearance of carvel construction, but achieved by entirely different means.

Compared to clinker-built hulls, carvel construction allowed larger ships to be built. This is because the fastenings of a clinker hull took all the hogging and sagging forces imposed by the ship moving through large waves. In carvel construction, these forces are also taken by the edge-to-edge contact of the hull planks.

==Etymology==
From Middle English &quot;carvel, carvelle, carvile, kervel&quot; (“small ship; caravel”); from Old French &quot;caruelle, carvelle, kirvelle&quot;. The term was used in English when caravels became popular in Northern European waters from onwards, and the method of hull construction took the name of the first vessel type made in that way in English and European shipyards.

==History==

Carvel construction originated in the Mediterranean during the first millennium CE. It gradually replaced the edge-to-edge joining of hull planks by mortises and tenons – a &quot;planking first&quot; technique – which had been used by ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians and for much of classical antiquity. Archaeological evidence for this transition suggests it took place from to the 9th century. Its slow adoption involved some variation and experimentation. Some ships were built using &quot;framing-first&quot;, as opposed to the full &quot;frame-first&quot; system. In &quot;framing-first&quot;, some of the framing is installed in the lower part of the hull, followed by the planking of that area, more framing is added to increase the height of the hull, and then more planking added to that. (The Romano-Celtic ship-building tradition of Northern Europe used &quot;framing-first&quot;, but this part of Europe did not adopt the full &quot;frame-first&quot; method until much later, as discussed below.)

The changeover from planking-first to frame-first happened over the same period that the Mediterranean Square Sail rig was being replaced by lateen rig. That change has been suggested to save building, fitting out and maintenance costs (though previously it was thought to be to achieve better sailing performance – something which, against the presumptions of many maritime historians, can be shown not to have happened). The move to carvel construction is believed to be another cost-saving measure (though it is felt that this is not well understood by marine archaeologists). The difficult skill of mortising planks at precisely the right angle (where the hull is curved at the ) is avoided. Carvel construction allows hull shape to be determined by design, whilst planking-first relies on the &quot;eye&quot; of the builder. Therefore fewer very highly skilled personnel are needed.

One of the transitional ships is the Yassi Ada ship (seventh century CE), which was excavated between 1960 and 1965. This had the lower of planking fastened edge-to-edge with mortises and tenons, then the s were added, followed by more planking joined with tenons. This brought the planking up to the waterline. Further frames were added to this next set of planking, but these continued up to the height of the intended sheerline. The strakes from the waterline up were then fastened on as carvel planking (with some interspersed with the regular strakes). 

Northern Europe used clinker construction for the period discussed above, and into the 15th century (and continued to do so for many small craft into the present day). The different methods were known of by mariners in both places, but when, for instance, Mediterranean galleys were employed by the French and English during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, shipwrights familiar with carvel work had to be recruited to carry out maintenance and repairs. In the 1440s interest in the caravel grew in northern waters and shipyards there started building caravels in carvel construction.

An archaeological example of an early carvel-built ship in the Baltic region is the wreck of Gribshunden, flagship of the Danish-Norwegian King Hans. The three-masted ship was built in 1485 probably near Rotterdam, and served as Hans&#x27;s &quot;floating castle&quot; for ten years before sinking in June 1495.

===Relationship between clinker and carvel===

Clinker was the predominant method of ship construction used in Northern Europe before the carvel. In clinker built hulls, the planked edges overlap; carvel construction with its strong framing gives a heavier but more rigid hull, capable of taking a variety of sail rigs. Clinker (lapstrake) construction involves longitudinal overlapping &quot;riven timber&quot; (split wood) planks that are fixed together over very light scantlings. A carvel boat has a smoother surface which gives the impression that it is more hydrodynamically efficient since the exposed edges of the clinker planking appear to disturb the streamline and cause drag. A clinker certainly has a slightly larger wetted area, but a carvel hull is not necessarily more efficient: for given hull strength, the clinker boat is overall lighter, and displaces less water than a heavily-framed carvel hull.

As cargo vessels become bigger, the vessel&#x27;s weight becomes small in comparison with total displacement; and for a given external volume, there is greater internal hull space available. A clinker vessel whose ribs occupy less space than a carvel vessel&#x27;s is more suitable for cargo which is bulky rather than dense.

A structural benefit of clinker construction is that it produces a vessel that can safely twist and flex around its long axis (running from bow to stern). This is an advantage in North Atlantic rollers, provided the vessel has a small overall displacement. Due to the light nature of the construction method, increasing the beam did not commensurately increase the vessel&#x27;s survivability under the twisting forces arising if, for example, when sailing downwind, the wave-train impinges on the quarter rather than dead astern. In these conditions greater beam widths may have made clinker vessels more vulnerable. As torsional forces increased in proportion to displaced (or cargo) weight, the forces incident on the hull imposed an upper limit on the size of clinker-built vessels. The greater rigidity of carvel construction became necessary for larger offshore cargo vessels. Later carvel-built sailing vessels exceeded the maximum size of clinker-built ships several times over.

A further clinker limitation is that it does not readily support the point loads associated with lateen or sloop sailing rigs. At least some fore-and-aft sails are desirable for manoeuvrability. The same problem in providing for concentrated loads creates difficulties siting and supporting a centerboard or deep keel, which is much needed when sailing across or close to the wind. Timbers can be added as necessary compromise but always with some loss of the fundamental benefits of the construction method. Clinker construction remains a useful method of construction for small wooden vessels, especially for sea-going dinghies which need to be light enough to be readily moved and stored when out of the water.

===Modern carvel methods===
Traditional carvel methods leave a small gap between each plank that is caulked with any suitable soft, flexible, fibrous material, sometimes combined with a thick binding substance, which would gradually wear out and the hull would leak. When the boat was beached for a length of time, the planks would dry and shrink, so when first refloated, the hull would leak badly unless re-caulked, a time-consuming and physically demanding job. The modern variation is to use much narrower planks that are edge-glued instead of being caulked. With modern power sanders a much smoother hull is produced, as all the small ridges between the planks can be removed. This method started to become more common in the 1960s with the more widespread availability of waterproof glues, such as resorcinol (red glue) and then epoxy resin. Modern waterproof glues, especially epoxy resin, have caused revolutionary changes in carvel and clinker construction. Traditionally, nails provided the fastening strength; now it is the glue. It has become quite common since the 1980s for carvel and clinker construction to rely almost completely on glue for fastening. Many small boats, especially light plywood skiffs, are built without any mechanical fasteners such as nails and lag screws at all, as the glue is far stronger.

<text>Margaret Carolyn Schott (née Unnewehr; August 18, 1928 – March 2, 2004) was an American baseball executive. Serving as managing general partner, president and CEO of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Cincinnati Reds franchise from 1984 to 1999, she was the second woman to own a North American major-league team without inheriting it, after New York Mets founder Joan Whitney Payson.

She was banned from managing the team by MLB in 1993 due to racist comments and again from 1996 through 1998 due to statements in support of German domestic policies of Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler, amongst other controversies over her beliefs; shortly afterwards, she sold the majority of her share in the team.

==Early life and career==
Schott was born in Cincinnati, one of five daughters of Edward Henry Unnewehr and Charlotte (Sauerland). Her father grew wealthy in the lumber business. She attended parochial schools and graduated from the Sacred Heart Academy. While a student at the University of Cincinnati Marge Schott became a member of Theta Phi Alpha fraternity. She married Charles Schott, a member of a wealthy Cincinnati family, in 1952, and inherited his automobile dealerships and interests in other industries when he died of a heart attack in 1968. A widow at 39, Marge Schott never remarried and had no children of her own.

==Cincinnati Reds==
Schott had been a Reds fan for most of her life; from 1963 onward, she held an auction to raise money for the Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital, attended by several Reds players. In 1981, Schott bought a minority interest in the Reds as part of a group headed by insurance magnates William and James Williams. On December 21, 1984, she purchased a controlling interest for a reported $11M, making her managing general partner, and becoming the first woman to buy an MLB team. In 1985, she was named president and CEO of the club. Five years later, the Reds won the World Series, when they swept the Oakland Athletics (now The Athletics).

Schott quickly became one of baseball&#x27;s most publicly visible owners. The Reds had long been a family-oriented franchise, and fans praised her efforts to keep ticket and concession prices low. For instance, she kept the price of the basic hot dog at one dollar (), and kept box seats around $12 ()the cheapest in baseball. Unlike most owners, she sat in a regular box seat at Riverfront Stadium, and often signed autographs. She often allowed groups of children on the field to run to deep center field and back before the games would start, due to her love for children stemming from her inability to have any of her own. She was also noted for always having Schottzie, her pet Saint Bernard, with her.

She was criticized for not spending the money it would have taken to build the Reds into contenders. This &quot;cheap&quot; attitude was sometimes conveyed in her own statements. She would publicly comment on occasion about having to pay players while they were on the disabled list, notably World Series hero José Rijo (who had an elbow injury), about whom she once complained of &quot;paying three million dollars to sit on his butt.&quot; She also maintained one of the smallest and lowest paid front office staffs in the major leagues; it was said to turn the heat down and lights off to save electricity.

In addition, it was revealed Schott was far from happy about the team winning the 1990 World Series. She was annoyed the team won the series in a &quot;sweep&quot; (the Reds swept the heavily-favored Oakland Athletics in four games). In her opinion the series was over too early; she believed team owners made the most money from a World Series once it reached a Game 5/6/7, thus robbing her of major revenue. She fussed and refused to pay for any post-game celebration for the team. The players reportedly resorted to celebrating on their own with hamburgers.

Lou Piniella, the champion manager of the team, left in 1992 after finding her not willing to back him in any way when he was sued by umpire Gary Darling for defamation (he had to get his own lawyer).

==Controversies ==

===Racism===
On November 13, 1992, Charles &quot;Cal&quot; Levy, a former marketing director for the Reds, stated in a deposition for Tim Sabo, a former employee who was suing the team, that he&#x27;d heard Schott refer to then-Reds outfielders Eric Davis and Dave Parker as &quot;million-dollar niggers.&quot; Sabo, who had been the team&#x27;s controller, alleged that his 1991 firing was due to testifying against Schott in another lawsuit brought against Schott by several limited partners and because he opposed the unwritten policy of not hiring blacks. Schott&#x27;s countersuit alleged that Sabo wrote unauthorized checks to himself and paid health insurance premiums to retired front-office employees. She asked for $25,000 in damages for defamation. Sabo ultimately lost his suit.

Levy, who is Jewish, alleged that Schott kept a Nazi swastika armband at her home and claims he overheard her say &quot;sneaky goddamn Jews are all alike.&quot; The next day, Schott issued a statement saying the claims of racism levied against her were overstated and that she did not mean to offend anyone with her statement or her ownership of the armband. Schott explained that the swastika armband had been a gift from a former employee.

On November 29, Schott said the &quot;million-dollar niggers&quot; comment was made in jest, but then stated that she felt that Adolf Hitler was initially good for Germany and did not understand how the epithet &quot;Jap&quot; could be offensive.

During the same season, a former Oakland Athletics executive assistant, Sharon Jones, is quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as having overheard Schott state: &quot;I would never hire another nigger. I&#x27;d rather have a trained monkey working for me than a nigger,&quot; before the start of an owners&#x27; conference call.

On May 5, 1996, Schott aroused ire when she made statements favorable of Adolf Hitler, saying he &quot;was O.K. at the beginning, [...] He just went too far.&quot; Later in the month, Schott was quoted in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as speaking in a &quot;cartoonish Japanese accent&quot; while describing her meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan. Schott later stated that she did not like Asian kids &quot;outdoing our kids&quot; in high school.

===Other incidents===
Schott was the target of frequent criticism for allegedly allowing her ever-present St. Bernards, Schottzie and Schottzie 02, near-complete free rein of Riverfront Stadium, including their defecating on the field. In particular, Reds personnel had also complained of her dogs&#x27; hair frequently getting stuck on their uniforms; Schott believed this was a good-luck charm, and during their 1990 World Series run would send bags of his hair to the team facilities. The hair was so old it began to smell. When the original Schottzie died, he was buried in Schott&#x27;s backyard, wearing a Reds hat.

Schott was known for not wanting to hire scouts, stating that &quot;All they do is sit around and watch ball games,&quot; and, for the opening week of the 1996 season, refusing to post scores of other games on the Riverfront Stadium scoreboard (the cost of this service was $350/month). Schott reportedly said of the scoreboard issue, &quot;Why do [fans] care about &quot;one&quot; game when they&#x27;re watching &quot;another?&quot;&quot;

On September 21, 1989, professional wrestler Randy Savage (in his &quot;Macho King&quot; gimmick), was invited by Reds broadcaster Marty Brennaman to join him in the booth. Prior to his wrestling career, Savage was a minor league baseball player who played for Tampa Tarpons (a Reds farm team). He joined Brennaman during the third inning, in a 11–7 loss to the San Diego Padres, which garnered attention from players, umpires and fans in attendance. A furious Schott wanted Savage off the air and sent a message via her nephew Stephen H. Schott and the radio producer to Brennaman threatening to fire him. Brennaman cornered the younger Schott off the air, telling him: &quot;Don&#x27;t you ever try to intimidate me again. And if you have something to say, say it yourself&quot;. Reds center fielder Eric Davis also criticised the decision to have Savage ejected from the game, saying:
On May 18, 1994, during a speech before the Ohio County Treasurers Association, Schott commented that she did not want her players to wear earrings because &quot;only fruits wear earrings.&quot; She said, &quot;I was raised to believe that men wearing earrings are fruity.&quot; Up to 1999, the Reds had a long-standing rule prohibiting players from having facial hair. In 1985, Schott famously offered future Hall of Famer Rollie Fingers to play for the Reds, on the condition that Fingers would shave off his iconic handlebar mustache. Fingers supposedly responded that he would shave his mustache &quot;when (Schott) shaves her Saint Bernard.&quot; The rule was rescinded in 1999 (shortly before she relinquished control of the Reds) after a discussion between Schott and newly acquired outfielder Greg Vaughn.

In 1995 Schott famously announced in the middle of the season that manager Davey Johnson would not return, regardless of how well the Reds did. By all accounts, this was because of a personality clash between Johnson and Schott. Most notably, Schott did not approve of Johnson living with his fiancée before they were married later in the year. The Reds won the division and made it all the way to the National League Championship series, where they were swept by the eventual World Champion Atlanta Braves, and Johnson was still fired. The Reds 1995 NLDS win over the Dodgers in that same postseason remains their most recent playoff series win to date, as the Reds have made the playoffs 4 additional times since 1995, only to be eliminated in the first round on each occasion. 

Being Major League Baseball&#x27;s oldest franchise, the Reds traditionally play the first game of the season at home. On April 1, 1996, they played the Montreal Expos. The weather was cold and blustery and it had snowed earlier in the day. Shortly after the game started, home plate umpire John McSherry called a time out and motioned towards the Reds dugout, it was later presumed, for medical attention. After taking just a few steps, McSherry collapsed and fell to the artificial turf face first. Attempts to resuscitate McSherry failed and he was pronounced dead on arrival at University Hospital about an hour later. The other umpires decided to postpone the game until the next day. Video showed Schott visibly upset that the game was to be postponed; reportedly she groused, &quot;Snow this morning and now this. I don&#x27;t believe it. I feel cheated. This isn&#x27;t supposed to happen to us, not in Cincinnati. This is &quot;our&quot; history, &quot;our&quot; tradition, &quot;our&quot; team. Nobody feels worse than me.&quot; Schott later insisted that she was standing up for the fans, though critics saw her comments as highly insensitive and grossly inappropriate. Schott reportedly offended major league umpires in general—and members of McSherry&#x27;s crew in particular—by regifting a bouquet of flowers given to her, adding a sympathy note, and sending it to the funeral home. During the team&#x27;s next homestand, Schott attempted to smooth over her feud with the umpires by apologizing to the crew—despite none of them having been in attendance at the game in question—only to have them refuse the gesture.

At an unknown time on an airplane, Schott was allegedly approached by a woman who introduced herself as Edd Roush&#x27;s granddaughter. Schott then replied, &quot;That&#x27;s nice hon, what business is he in?&quot; Roush is a Hall of Fame center fielder who had many of his greatest years with the Reds. &quot;The New York Times&quot; later dubbed her &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Big Red Headache&quot;, and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; would dub her as a &quot;Red Menace&quot;.

===Sanctions and forced retirement===
Due to Schott&#x27;s racist comments, a four-man committee was convened to investigate Schott. On February 3, 1993, she was fined $250,000 and banned from day-to-day operations of the Reds for the 1993 season. Jim Bowden took over as managing partner. Schott returned to work on November 1.

Schott&#x27;s comments about Hitler led MLB to ban Schott from day-to-day operations through 1998. On April 20, 1999, Schott agreed to sell her controlling interest in the Reds for $67 million to a group led by Cincinnati businessman Carl Lindner. At the time she was facing a third suspension, failing health, and an expiring ownership agreement with her limited partners, who planned to oust her. Schott remained as a minority partner.

==Philanthropy==
In addition to her interest in the Reds, Schott was a major contributor to charitable organizations in Cincinnati, including Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital Medical Center and the Cincinnati Zoo, where they named an Asian elephant, Schottzie, after her dog. A second Asian elephant, named Princess Schottzie II, was donated by Schott in 1996.

She is recognized for her major donation to the Boy Scouts&#x27; Camp Friedlander that was used to create an lake, christened &#x27;Lake Marge Schott&#x27; in her honor.

Marge Schott was also a generous contributor to special events at the University of Cincinnati, such as the annual Homecoming Parade. From 2006 to 2020, UC&#x27;s baseball stadium was named the Marge Schott Stadium in her honor. In June 2020, the university&#x27;s board of trustees voted to remove her name from the stadium, citing her record of racism and bigotry, and renamed it UC Baseball Stadium.

==Illness and death==
Schott was a long-time smoker; in 2001 she began to develop health problems. Schott was hospitalized twice for breathing problems and suffered from pneumonia in 2003. Schott was hospitalized again on February 9, 2004. Some reports claim she was hospitalized due to a cold, while others said she complained of knee ailments; regardless, during her stay she developed breathing problems and had to be put on life support. She died on March 2 at age 75 at the Christ Hospital, in Cincinnati.

Schott&#x27;s funeral was held at All Saints Catholic Church, in the Cincinnati suburb of Kenwood. She was interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery wearing her signature red suit with an elephant brooch.

<text>Ashmyany or Oshmyany is a city in Grodno Region, Belarus. It is located from Vilnius in Lithuania, and serves as the administrative center of Ashmyany District. The river Ashmyanka passes through the city. As of 2024, it has a population of 16,787.

==Name==
Since time immemorial, Ašmena and its surroundings were ethnic Lithuanian territory. However, many of the indigenous inhabitants died out during the wars, famine and plague in the late 17th and the early 18th centuries, and the Belarusian population replaced them. Lithuanians were slavicized along the Minsk-Ašmena-Vilnius axis, and by the mid-19th century, the numbers of Lithuanian-speakers had severely decreased.

Presently, its Lithuanian past is sealed in the towns&#x27;s name, which is of Lithuanian origin. The town&#x27;s name is derived from the name of the &quot;Ašmena&quot; (modern Ashmyanka River), itself derived from the Lithuanian word &quot;akmuo&quot; (stone). The link between consonants &quot;š&quot; and &quot;k&quot; is old and present in the Lithuanian words, respectively &quot;ašmuo&quot; (sharp blade) and &quot;akmuo&quot; (stone). The present name &quot;Ashmyany&quot; uses the plural form of the name and is a modern invention. Through the ancient town&#x27;s history, its name was recorded in the Lithuanian singular form.

==History==
===Grand Duchy of Lithuania===
====14th century====
Ašmena is mentioned first as a town in the Duchy of Vilnius in the 1350s. The first reliable mention of Ašmena is in the Lithuanian Chronicles, which tells that after Gediminas&#x27; death in 1341, Jaunutis inherited the town. In 1384, the Teutonic Order attacked and destroyed the town with the goal of destroying Jogaila&#x27;s hereditary state. The Teutons recorded the town as &quot;Aschemynne&quot;. The Teutons managed to destroy the town, but it quickly recovered. By 1384, there is a manor of the Grand Duke of Lithuania in Ašmena. The Roman Catholic was built after 1387. This church was one of the first in the whole of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The church was administrated by the Franciscans.

====15th century====
In 1402, the Teutons attacked once more, but were bloodily repelled, so the Teutons withdrew to Medininkai. In 1413, the town became one of the most notable trade and commerce centres within the Vilnius Voivodship. Hence, in 1432 Ashmyany became the site of an important battle between the royal forces of Jogaila under Žygimantas Kęstutaitis and the forces of Švitrigaila, who was allied with the Teutonic Order. After the town was taken by the royalists, it became the private property of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania and started to develop rapidly.

Hanseatic trade routes passed through the town in the 15th century. On 1 September 1432, Švitrigaila was deposed from the throne in Ašmena. On 8 December 1432, Ašmena was the site of the Battle of Ašmena between Švitrigaila and Sigismund Kęstutaitis. There was a residential palace in Ašmena from the early 15th century to the end of the 18th century.

====16th century====
The Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven burnt down in 1505, but was rebuilt. The Muscovite army destroyed and burnt Ašmena to the ground in 1519, during the Fourth Lithuanian–Muscovite War. The town was granted the Magdeburg rights in the 16th century. From 1566, Ašmena was the centre of the .

Ashmyany did not recover as quickly as previously after 1519, and in 1537 the town was granted several royal privileges to facilitate its reconstruction. In 1566, the town finally received Magdeburg rights, which were confirmed in 1683 (along with the privileges for the local merchants and burghers) by King John III Sobieski. In the 16th century the town was one of the most notable centers of Calvinism in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, after Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot; Radziwiłł founded a college and a church there.

====17th century====
The Muscovite army occupied Ašmena in 1655. Due to the widespread destruction and impoverishment during the Deluge, the town was exempt from taxes in 1655, 1661 and 1667. In 1667, the Dominican Order was built.

====18th century====
In 1792, King Stanisław August Poniatowski confirmed all previous privileges and the fact, that &quot;Oszmiany&quot;, as it was then called, was a free city, subordinate only to the king and the local city council. With this, the town received its first ever Coat of arms. Composed of three fields, it featured a shield, a hand holding scales and the bull from Ciołek coat of arms, the monarch&#x27;s personal coat of arms.

During the Uprising of 1794, Ašmena was the site of the insurgent staff under Jokūbas Jasinskis. At the same time, an insurgent group led by Mykolas Kleopas Oginskis was organised in the town. In 1795, the town was annexed by the Russian Empire in the last Partition of Poland–Lithuania. The Church of Saint Michael the Archangel burnt down in 1797 but was rebuilt.
===19th century===
The Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven was also rebuilt in bricks in 1812; however, the church decayed over the 19th century. During the French invasion of Russia, the Grande Armée took over Ašmena in 1812, and during several battles, the town partially burnt down.

====November Uprising (1830-1831)====
During the November Uprising, it was liberated by the town&#x27;s citizens, led by a local priest, Jasiński, and Colonel Count Karol Dominik Przeździecki. However, in April 1831, in the face of a Russian offensive, the fighters were forced to withdraw to the Naliboki forest. After a minor skirmish with Stelnicki&#x27;s rearguard, the Russian punitive expeditionary force of some 1,500 officers and soldiers proceeded to burn the town and massacre the civilian population, including some 500 women, children and elderly, who sought refuge in the Dominican Catholic Church. Even the local priest was murdered. Nothing is known of the fate of Ashmyany&#x27;s Jews. In the Uprising of 1831, the Imperial Russian Army razed the town and massacred 150 locals in one of the town&#x27;s churches.

====Rebuilding====
In 1845, as the town was rebuilding, it received a new coat of arms, in recognition of its population increase. It never recovered from its earlier losses, and by the end of the 19th century it became rather a provincial town, inhabited primarily by Jewish immigrants from other parts of Russia &#x27;beyond the Pale&#x27;.

The Church of Saint Michael the Archangel was closed down in 1850, but rebuilt in 1900–10. In the late 19th century, a tavern was built and the Russian authorities built a Russian Orthodox church.

===20th century===
In 1912 the local Jewish community built a large synagogue.

====World War I====
After the end of World War I and the withdrawal of the German army in 1919, Ashmyany was under Polish jurisdiction. According to the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty, signed on 12 July 1920, Ašmena was part of Lithuania. However, the Lithuanian territory was seized by the Polish Army that same year. After the Polish–Soviet War, Ashmyany was given to Poland by the Peace of Riga.

====In interwar Poland====
It was a county center, first of Wilno Land, then of Wilno Voivodeship during Polish rule. The town was capital of Oszmiana County. According to the census from 1931, Poles constituted 81% of the inhabitants of the Oszmiana County. On the other hand, Poles and Jews dominated the town of Oszmiana.

====World War II====
=====Soviet occupation=====
Following the Soviet-German invasion of Poland in 1939, the Soviet Union occupied the area until 1941. Ashmyany was given to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Ashmyany was a raion center in Vileyka Region between 1939 and 1941. At the very end of the Soviet occupation, on the night of June 22 and morning of June 23, 1941, the NKVD murdered and buried in one mass grave 57 Polish prisoners from Ashmyany.

=====German occupation=====
During the Nazi occupation, which began June 25, 1941, the Jews of Ashmyany and their spiritual leader Rabbi Zew Wawa Morejno were ghettoized. After the Wehrmacht drove out the Soviet occupiers, Ashmyany was part of the &quot;Generalbezirk Litauen&quot; in &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot; in 1941–1944.

=====Soviet reoccupation=====
On July 7, 1944, it was reoccupied by the Red Army during the Vilnius offensive. In 1945, the town was annexed by the USSR to the Byelorussian SSR. After 1944, the town was once more part of Vileyka Region, and between 1944 and 1960 it was incorporated into Molodechno Region until that region was disestablished. At that point Ashmyany became part of the Grodno Region, where it remains today.

===Recent history===
Since 1991, it has been a part of Belarus.

<text>The Kennebec River (Abenaki: &quot;Kinəpékʷihtəkʷ&quot;) is a river within the U.S. state of Maine. It rises in Moosehead Lake in west-central Maine. The East and West Outlets join at Indian Pond and the river flows southward. Harris Station Dam, the largest hydroelectric dam in the state, was constructed near that confluence. The river is joined at The Forks by its tributary the Dead River, also called the West Branch.

It continues south past the towns of Madison, Skowhegan, the city of Waterville, and the state capital Augusta. At Richmond, it flows into Merrymeeting Bay, a freshwater tidal bay into which also flow the Androscoggin River and five smaller rivers.

The Kennebec runs past the shipbuilding center of Bath, and has its mouth at the Gulf of Maine in the Atlantic Ocean. The Southern Kennebec flows below the fall line and does not have rapids. As a consequence, ocean tides and saltwater fish species, such as the endangered Atlantic Sturgeon, can go upriver affecting the ecology as far north as Waterville, a small city located more than 35 miles inland. Tributaries of the Kennebec include the Carrabassett River, Sandy River, and Sebasticook River.

Segments of the East Coast Greenway run along the Kennebec.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Kennebec&quot; comes from the Eastern Abenaki &quot;/kínipekʷ/&quot;, meaning &quot;large body of still water, large bay&quot;.

==History==

===Discovery by Europeans===

In 1605, French explorer Samuel de Champlain navigated the coast of what is now Maine, charting the land and rivers of what was then called New France, L&#x27;Acadie, including the Kennebec as far upriver as present-day Bath, as well as the St. Croix, and Penobscot rivers. In the 1600s the Abenaki village of Norridgewock was located along the Kennebec.

===Shipbuilding===
The English founded the Popham Colony along the Kennebec in 1607. The settlers built the , the first oceangoing vessel built in the New World by English-speaking shipwrights. An English trading post, Cushnoc, was established on the Kennebec in 1628.

Bath and other cities along the Kennebec were developed, and artisans founded shipyards that produced hundreds of wooden and steel vessels. Bath became known as the &quot;City of Ships&quot;. The , one of the largest wooden schooners ever built, was constructed here.

For parts of the 17th century, the Kennebec was the western boundary of Cornwall County, Province of New York.

Following the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain, the US enjoyed a lengthy period of expansion of international trade, which increased the demand for shipbuilding and stimulated the growth of maritime fleets. Many of those ships were built in Bath. In 1854, at the peak of this boom period, at least nineteen major firms were building ships in Bath. Changes in the industry since the mid-20th century have resulted in the decline in US shipbuilding, as jobs moved offshore. The sole remaining shipyard in Bath is the Bath Iron Works, owned by General Dynamics; this is one of the few yards still building warships for the United States Navy. The USCGC &quot;Kennebec&quot; was named after this river.

===Navigation===
With waterways the most accessible travel routes, the Kennebec River served as an early trade corridor to interior Maine from the Atlantic coast. Ocean ships could navigate upstream as far as Augusta. The cities of Bath, Gardiner, Hallowell and Augusta, and the towns of Woolwich, Richmond and Randolph, all developed along this transportation corridor.

Upstream of Augusta, the timber industry used the river for log driving, to transport wooden logs and pulpwood from interior forests to sawmills and paper mills built along the river to use its water power. The city of Waterville and the towns of Winslow, Skowhegan, Norridgewock, Madison, Anson, and Bingham were all related to the lumber trade. The Maine Central Railroad and U.S. Route 201 were later constructed to make use of the flatlands along the river through these towns and cities.

=== Father Rale&#x27;s War ===
England&#x27;s 1710 conquest of Acadia brought mainland Nova Scotia under English control, but New France still claimed present-day New Brunswick and present-day Maine east of the Kennebec River. (The Kennebec River was also a border for the indigenous Native Americans and First Nations.) To secure its claim, New France established Catholic missions in the three largest native villages in the region: one on the Kennebec River (Norridgewock); one further north on the Penobscot River (Penobscot), and one on the Saint John River (Medoctec).

Abenaki warriors along the Kennebec resisted English encroachment by armed confrontations, in what American historians sometimes refer to as Father Rale&#x27;s War (1722–1725). A Yankee militia raid on the Abenaki Indian mission village at Norridgewock in August 1724 crippled the Abenaki resistance, as they killed as many as 40 inhabitants, including women and children. They also killed and scalped Fr. Sebastien Rasle, the 67-year old Jesuit priest, and scalped 26 of the dead Abenaki. Having plundered and torched the tribal village, the Yankee raiders destroyed the surrounding corn fields; they were paid bounties for the scalps. Some Abenaki survivors returned to the Upper Kennebec, but others took refuge with Penobscot allies or in Abenaki mission villages in French Canada.

===Revolutionary War===
Some 1,110 American Revolutionary War soldiers followed the route of the Kennebec during Benedict Arnold&#x27;s expedition to Quebec in 1775.

===War of 1812===
During the War of 1812, United States and British Canadian forces fought at the Battle of Hampden in Maine.

===Ice industry===
In 1814, Frederic Tudor began to establish markets in the West Indies and the southern United States for ice. In 1826, Rufus Page built the first large ice house near Gardiner, in order to supply Tudor. The ice was harvested during the winter from the river by farmers and others who were otherwise relatively inactive. They cut it by hand, floated the huge chunks to an ice house on the bank, and stored it until spring. Then, packed in sawdust, the ice was loaded aboard ships and sent to the South.

===Flood of 1987===

On April 1, 1987, a combination of more than of melting snow and of rain in the mountains forced the river to flood its banks. By April 2, 1987, the river had crested at the North Sidney, Maine USGS gage at , higher than the previous record flood stage. At the flood&#x27;s peak, the flow topped out at an estimated . It caused damage of about , flooding 2,100 homes, destroying 215, and damaging 240 others. Signs of the flood can still be found in the towns and cities that line the river.

=== Whitewater rafting ===
In 1976 Suzanne and Wayne Hockmeyer, of Kennebec Whitewater Expeditions (now Northern Outdoors), pioneered whitewater rafting through the Kennebec gorge just below Harris Station Dam. Acknowledging the desire of young people for a space solely dedicated to kids, absent of adult gatherings and limiting constraints, in 1998 Northern Outdoors opened Adventure Bound - Maine&#x27;s only youth focused whitewater rafting company for kids and families. 

In the early 21st century, Northern Outdoors and 22 other rafting companies in The Forks conduct rafting on the river daily from May through October. Four times per rafting season, Brookfield Power tests their generating turbines by releasing the maximum amount of water possible from Harris Station Dam. At 8000 cubic feet per second, these Kennebec River Turbine Tests are the biggest whitewater releases in Maine.

==Natural resources==
Prior to the industrial era, the river contained many anadromous fish, in particular the Atlantic salmon. The exploiting of hydroelectric power in the region reduced the runs of such fish. The removal of dams on the river has been a controversial local issue in recent years. The removal of the Edwards Dam in 1999 has led to increased anadromous activity on the river.

==Dams==

===Hydroelectricity===
The following is a list of hydroelectric power stations on the Kennebec River.

== Removal of Edwards Dam ==
The Kennebec River before the construction of Edwards Dam was extremely important as a spawning ground for Atlantic fish. In 1837, the Edwards Dam was built across the Kennebec River, just shy of the limit of tidal influence. Made of timber and concrete, it extended across the river and high. Its reservoir stretched upstream, and covered .

In 1999, the dam was removed, after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) determined that the ecological benefits of removing it outweighed the value of the electricity it produced, and refused the renewal of the dam license.

Despite several negative visual and environmental factors at first, the ecosystem is healing itself. Initially after the removal of the dam, barren riverbanks and muddy water were evident along the lower of the Kennebec. Introduced smallmouth bass will suffer from the re-introduced striped bass, which tend to feed on young smallmouth bass. An increase in raptor populations, such as ospreys, bald eagles, herons, cormorants, and kingfishers, is evident.

Human activities also benefited from the dam removal. The exposure of rapids and the return of native fish species allows many recreational activities, including canoeing, kayaking, whitewater rafting, and fishing.

==Statistics==
The river drains , and on average discharges per day into Merrymeeting Bay at a rate of . The United States government maintains three river flow gauges on the Kennebec river. The first is at Indian Pond () where the rivershed is . Flow here has ranged from . The second is at Bingham () where the rivershed is . Flow here has ranged from . The third is at North Sidney () where the rivershed is . Flow here has ranged from . Two additional river stage gauges (no flow data) are in Augusta () and Gardiner (); both of these gauge heights are affected by ocean tides.

Before the river was dammed, it was navigable as far as Augusta.

<text>Jean Pelletier, (; February 21, 1935 – January 10, 2009) was a Canadian politician who served as the 37th mayor of Quebec City, Chief of Staff in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, and chairman of Via Rail. He was a leading organizer of the Liberal Party of Canada.

==Early career==
Born in Chicoutimi, Quebec, the son of Burroughs and Marie (Desautels) Pelletier, Pelletier was educated at the college des Jesuits in Quebec City and the Séminaire de Trois-Rivières. He studied social sciences at Laval University before working as a journalist with CFCM-TV in Quebec City in 1957. From 1958 to 1958, he was a correspondent with Télévision de Radio-Canada. In 1959, he was the press secretary for the Premier of Quebec, Paul Sauvé.

From 1960 to 1962, he was the executive secretary for the Commission des Monuments Historiques de la Province de Québec, a society for the listing and preserving all buildings of historical interest in the province of Quebec. From 1963 to 1964, he was a Technical Advisor to the Secretary of the Province of Quebec. Moving into the private sector, he was a broker for Levesque &amp; Beaubien from 1964 to 1970. From 1970 to 1973, he was a vice president for Dumont Express. From 1973 to 1977, he was vice-president of Action Sociale Ltée.

==Political career==
Pelletier began his political career with the Union Nationale party, a conservative and nationalist party identifying with Quebec autonomism.

He won a seat as a municipal councillor in Quebec City in December 1976. He was elected mayor in 1977, serving for twelve years and two more elections. During his tenure as mayor, from 1977 to 1989, he improved rail service into the city, was instrumental in reviving the Lower Town and in having it designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

While mayor, Pelletier also became friends with Paris mayor Jacques Chirac. The two worked closely together as part of the Association of Francophone Mayors (1979–89), where Pelletier served as vice president. He successfully persuaded Chirac to keep quiet during the 1980 Quebec referendum, though Chirac personally supported an independent Quebec like General Charles de Gaulle.

With the demise of the &quot;Union Nationale&quot;, he joined the Liberal Party of Canada.

==Chief of Staff to Jean Chrétien==
Pelletier was a longtime close ally and friend of Jean Chrétien. They knew each other for years, having first met at boarding school while still youths. They attended law school at Laval University together and earned similar reputations as being aggressive.

When Chrétien won the leadership in 1990, he was largely unpopular in Quebec, rocked by caucus defects, and indecisive in responding to the Oka standoff. The federal Liberals were disorganized, near bankruptcy, and dropped in the polls from 50 to 32 per cent. In order to reinvigorate his leadership and reorganized his chaotic office, Chrétien hired Pelletier as his chief of staff, while Eddie Goldenberg continued as senior political adviser.

Pelletier ran unsuccessfully in the Quebec City riding during the 1993 election, which saw the party capture few seats in the province of Quebec outside of their federalist stronghold of Montreal. That campaign saw Chrétien become Prime Minister, and Pelletier became his Chief of Staff, making him head of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office.

Chrétien praised Pelletier as Chief of Staff, saying &quot;He ran a very tight–and tight-lipped–ship... As a result, we didn&#x27;t suffer from the public feuding, backbiting gossip, and anonymous leaks that had plagued other PMOs. Even those columnists and academics who were no fans of the Liberal Party had to concede that Pelletier&#x27;s operation was among the most efficient and harmonious in memory, despite having been reduced from 120 to 80 employees as a cost-saving measure.&quot; Jeffrey Simpson, a columnist for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, noted that &quot;Pelletier stayed away from the media. He seldom met with journalists, and when he did, he gave almost nothing away. He was courteous, refined, sometimes witty and usually non-informative.&quot;

Pelletier persuaded two designates for Governor General, Roméo LeBlanc and Adrienne Clarkson, to marry their long-time partners, so they could be appointed as Canada&#x27;s head of state.

Pelletier remained close friends with Jacques Chirac, who became President of France in 1994. Pelletier played an instrumental role in Chrétien and Chirac becoming close friends despite their initial disagreements. Chrétien had initially dismissed Chirac as a &quot;right-wing Gaullist&quot; and had been publicly furious when Chirac announced on Larry King Live that France would be one of the first countries to recognize an independent Quebec. Years later, when Paul Martin became prime minister and dismissed Pelletier (see below), Chirac criticized Martin for his treatment of Pelletier.

==Sponsorship Scandal and Via Rail Controversy==
On May 4, 2001, Chrétien appointed Pelletier chairman of Via Rail, a Crown corporation. Soon after, Chrétien promised an extra C$700 million to improve Via&#x27;s service.

On March 1, 2004, Pelletier and Via President Marc LeFrançois were fired by Prime Minister Paul Martin and Transport Minister Tony Valeri. Their dismissals were shortly after the Liberal Party became embroiled in the sponsorship scandal. Pelletier was one of four Chrétien loyalists sacked from jobs at Crown corporations by Martin&#x27;s government during the sponsorship scandal. Via was accused of skipping mandated procedures in order to hand out contracts to Liberal-friendly firms and individuals. Pelletier, however, was not at Via for most of these occurrences, and the Martin government was accused of using an incident as an excuse to remove one of Chrétien&#x27;s allies. Eddie Goldenberg said that Pelletier &quot;was very hurt about being fired for saying something about Myriam Bédard without being asked for his side. The whole purpose [of firing him] had nothing to do with Ms. Bédard and everything to do with the fact that Mr. Martin didn&#x27;t like him because he had worked for Mr. Chrétien&quot;.

Paul Martin maintained that Pelletier was fired for remarks that he made to Montreal&#x27;s &quot;La Presse&quot; newspaper attacking Olympic athlete Myriam Bédard. Talking about Bédard, who had held a marketing position at Via and had gone to the media with stories of corruption, Pelletier said &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be mean, but this is a poor girl who deserves pity, who doesn&#x27;t have a spouse, as far as I know.&quot; He later reiterated that &quot;She is struggling as a single mother with economic responsibilities. Deep down, I think she is pitiful.&quot; This caused an immediate media fracas and the remarks were widely condemned as sexist and out-of-touch by women&#x27;s groups, sports groups and others.

On March 30, 2004, Pelletier sued Via and the federal government for C$3 million, for defamation and illegal dismissal. A federal court ruled that dismissal did not follow due process and ordered him reinstated in November 2005. Although he was reinstated, the government appealed the court ruling and kept him off the payroll. On December 22, 2005, he was fired a second time, this time after the government ensured that due process was followed. Pelletier filed suit in Quebec Superior Court alleging wrongful dismissal; Transport Minister Jean Lapierre issued a written statement noting that the second dismissal was effective immediately and that Pelletier would not receive compensation due to his suit against the government.

After the 2006 federal election, Reg Alcock, the outgoing President of the Treasury Board, did approve $40,000 to assist Pelletier with legal fees in a court challenge against the Gomery Commission. Representatives of other parties criticized this payment, saying that the government should only cover legal costs for working civil servants. Pelletier&#x27;s lawyer argued that it followed a long-standing government policy for high-ranking functionaries in judicial proceedings.

A Federal Court justice ruled in March 2007 that the Martin government acted improperly in 2005 when it fired Pelletier a second time, immediately after a court overturned his first dismissal as head of Via Rail. Justice Francois Lemieux ruled that then-Transport Minister Jean Lapierre, who fired Pelletier the second time, was biased and failed to follow proper procedures. On November 22, 2007, Judge Hélène Langlois of Quebec Superior Court ruled that government of Prime Minister Paul Martin had acted in a &quot;cavalier and precipitous&quot; fashion when it fired Pelletier. Langloise stated, &quot;that behaviour doesn&#x27;t meet the standard of diligence expected from a contractor when a contractual relationship is ended. It shows a total lack of consideration&quot;. Langlois also mentioned that people refused to walk on the same side of the street as Pelletier while others called him names in public. Pelletier was awarded $235,000 in lost income, and a further $100,000 for damaging his reputation. He had sued for $689,000 in financial losses and $3.3 million for moral damages.

On June 26, 2008, federal judge Max Teitelbaum criticized John Gomery for having a preoccupation with the media spotlight that led him to give interviews he should have eschewed, making comments that indicated he judged issues before all evidence was heard, exhibited bias against Mr. Chrétien, and trivialized the inquiry proceedings. For instance, Teitelbaum pointed out that Gomery&#x27;s remark halfway through the hearings that &quot;juicy stuff&quot; was yet to come made it appear that evidence of wrongdoing was expected before it was heard. The court threw out the Gomery inquiry&#x27;s conclusions that Chrétien and Pelletier bore responsibility for the sponsorship scandal.

==Death==
Pelletier died in Quebec City on January 10, 2009, from complications of colon cancer, aged 73. He was survived by his wife, Hélène, and two children.

==Honours==
In 1985, Pelletier was made a Member of the Order of Canada in recognition of having &quot;played a pivotal role in many social, cultural and philanthropic organizations in the Old Capital&quot;. He was promoted to Officer in 2003 in recognition of having &quot;dedicated his life to public service&quot;. In 1990, he was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec.
