<text>Oracle Internet Directory (OID) is a directory service produced by Oracle Corporation, which functions compatible with LDAP version 3. 

== Functionality ==

OID makes the following features available from within an Oracle database environment:

* integration with Oracle 8i and subsequent databases for ease of use and administration
* a scalable, multi-platform listing structure for reliable and safe intranet integration
* synchronization of OID-based listings (also with distributed applications)
* integration of existing public key certificates, digital wallets (e-wallets) and entrance privileges
* co-existence with other LDAP implementations via Oracle&#x27;s Directory Integration Platform (DIP)
* administration tools, including:
** routing policies
** system management objects such as Oracle Directory Manager (also known as &quot;oidadmin&quot; or &quot;ODM&quot;)
** technical support regarding the quality of the services
** delegated administrative service

== Implementation ==

OID uses standard Oracle database structures to store its internal tables.

In Oracle version 9 databases, by default, many Oracle LDAP Table Stores use tablespaces with names beginning with the codice_1 (and occasionally codice_2) prefixes. Relevant default schemas used may include codice_3 (for &quot;Oracle directory server&quot;) and codice_4.

== Operation ==

The OID Control Utility (OIDCTL) serves as a command-line tool for starting and stopping the OID server. The OID Monitor process interprets and executes the OIDCTL commands.

== Marketing ==

In comparing Oracle Internet Directory with its competitors, Oracle Corporation stresses that it uses as its foundation an Oracle database; whereas many competing products (such as Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition and Novell eDirectory) do not rely on an enterprise-strength relational database, but instead on embedded database engines similar to Berkeley DB. Integration with the Oracle database makes many of the technologies available for Oracle database available for Oracle Internet Directory, and improvements that Oracle makes in the database space can instantly flow through to its LDAP implementation.

For marketing purposes, OID forms part of the Oracle Identity Management suite of Oracle Application Server.

=== Distribution ===

Oracle database version 9 included OID bundled as an extra facility. OID shipped with the Oracle Application Server version 10.

 Oracle Corporation makes the most recent version of OID available only as part of the Identity Management-suite bundling of Oracle Application Server (10.1.4.0.1).

Oracle Internet Directory 11g forms part of Oracle directory services (ODS).

<text>Linksys Holdings, Inc., is an American brand of data networking hardware products mainly sold to home users and small businesses. It was founded in 1988 by the couple Victor and Janie Tsao, both Taiwanese immigrants to the United States. Linksys products include Wi-Fi routers, mesh Wi-Fi systems, Wifi extenders, access points, network switches, and Wi-Fi networking. It is headquartered in Irvine, California.

Linksys products are sold direct-to-consumer from its website, through online retailers and marketplaces, as well as off-the-shelf in consumer electronics and big-box retail stores. As of 2020, Linksys products are sold in retail locations and value-added resellers in 64 countries and was the first router company to ship 100 million products.

== History ==

In 1988, spouses Janie and Victor Tsao founded DEW International, later renamed Linksys, in the garage of their Irvine, California home. The Tsaos were immigrants from Taiwan who held second jobs as consultants specializing in pairing American technology vendors with manufacturers in Taiwan. The founders used Taiwanese manufacturing to achieve its early success. The company&#x27;s first products were printer sharers that connected multiple PCs to printers. The company expanded into Ethernet hubs, network cards, and cords. In 1992, the Tsaos began running Linksys full time and moved the company and its growing staff to a formal office. By 1994, it had grown to 55 employees with annual revenues of $6.5 million.

Linksys received a major boost in 1995, when Microsoft released Windows 95 with built-in networking functions that expanded the market for its products. Linksys established its first U.S. retail channels with Fry&#x27;s Electronics (1995) and Best Buy (1996). In the late 1990s, Linksys released the first affordable multiport router, popularizing Linksys as a home networking brand. By 2003, when the company was acquired by Cisco, it had 305 employees and revenues of more than $500 million.

Cisco expanded the company&#x27;s product line, acquiring VoIP maker Sipura Technology in 2005 and selling its products under Linksys Voice System or later Linksys Business Series brands. In July 2008, Cisco acquired Seattle-based Pure Networks, a vendor of home networking-management software.

Cisco announced in January 2013 that it would sell its home networking division and Linksys to Belkin, giving Belkin 30% of the home router market.

In 2018, Belkin and its subsidiaries, including Linksys, were acquired by Foxconn, a Taiwanese multinational electronics firm and the largest provider of electronics manufacturing services, for $866 million.

On June 4, 2021, Harry Dewhirst was appointed as CEO. In September, cybersecurity firm Fortinet made a $75 million investment in Linksys. Their focus is on the security of home networks for remote workplaces. On September 24, 2021, Fortinet invested an additional $85 million in cash for shares of Series A Preferred Stock of Linksys. Mark Sanders became CFO in October.

In 2023, the company starts its global expansion with a development centre in Taipei (Taiwan) and a new sales and marketing centre in Amstelveen (The Netherlands). The new facilities are close to leading technology centres and universities.

== Products==

Linksys initially sold connectors for PCs and printers before newer forms of connecting home and business networks through wired Ethernet and wireless technologies. Its networking products include Gigabit switches, Wi-Fi routers, Intelligent Mesh Wi-Fi systems, Wi-Fi extenders, Wi-Fi access points, and networking components.

Linksys Aware was introduced in 2019 as a first-to-market home monitoring system that alerts users to movement in their home through the Velop Triband system. In 2020, Linksys released Linksys Shield, a parental control subscription service for the Velop AC2200 Triband that allows users to manage or block online content.

The company also announced its Linksys Cloud Manager 2.0, which included a configurable captive portal.

=== Routers ===

Linksys released its first Wi-Fi router in 2001 and has maintained early router releases for newer generations of Wi-Fi.

The WRT54G was notable for having firmware based on the Linux operating system. Since version 5, flash memory was reduced from 4 MB to 2 MB, and VxWorks was used instead of Linux. The original Linux model with 4 MB was later available as the WRT54GL.

In 2017, Linksys launched the Velop line, a multi-unit tri-band mesh router system that uses three Wi-Fi radios.

First announced in 2020, Linksys began marketing home-based Linksys smart routers and Velop Mesh Wi-Fi.

In April 2021, launched its first Wi-Fi 6E-certified systems, including Hydra Pro 6E router and the Atlas Max 6E mesh system. In January 2022, Linksys launched Hydra Pro 6, a scaled-back version of the 6E model.

=== Wi-Fi systems ===
The Linksys Intelligent Mesh line, Velop, combines Linksys software and hardware to provide higher connection speeds throughout a location by using nodes with dynamic networking capabilities. Linksys in 2019, with the Linksys Aware line, was first to release mesh nodes as motion sensors, utilizing Wi-Fi signals without having to rely on other sensor devices.

Linksys markets Wi-Fi extenders that work with most Wi-Fi and ISP routers, including dual or tri-band units, and plug-in devices that eliminate Wi-Fi dead zones by wirelessly communicating with a router.

In 2018, Linksys released its cloud-based Wi-Fi management for business-class access points, the Linksys Cloud Manager.

Linksys markets mesh Wi-Fi routers built for Wi-Fi 6 capacity, offering four times the speed and capacity of Wi-Fi 5. The mesh Velop Wi-Fi 6, announced in October 2019.

In 2020, Linksys debuted 5G mobile hotspots, modems, mesh gateways, and outdoor routers.

At CES 2021, Linksys announced a line of Velop mesh systems and routers that support Wi-Fi 6E.

=== HomeWRK ===
HomeWRK is a two-node, mesh-enabled Wi-Fi 6 router. The appliance provides separate wireless networks for personal and business traffic. Fortinet’s security stack runs on the device, blocking malware, ransomware, and filtering content.

<doc id="508173" wikidata="Q478389" url="?curid=508173" title="Kyphosis">
<text>Kyphosis () is an abnormally excessive convex curvature of the spine as it occurs in the thoracic and sacral regions. Abnormal inward concave &quot;lordotic&quot; curving of the cervical and lumbar regions of the spine is called lordosis. 

It can result from degenerative disc disease; developmental abnormalities, most commonly Scheuermann&#x27;s disease; Copenhagen disease, osteoporosis with compression fractures of the vertebra; multiple myeloma; or trauma. 

A normal thoracic spine extends from the 1st thoracic to the 12th thoracic vertebra and should have a slight kyphotic angle, ranging from 20° to 45°. When the &quot;roundness&quot; of the upper spine increases past 45° it is called kyphosis or &quot;hyperkyphosis&quot;. Scheuermann&#x27;s kyphosis is the most classic form of hyperkyphosis and is the result of wedged vertebrae that develop during adolescence. The cause is not currently known and the condition appears to be multifactorial and is seen more frequently in males than females.

In the sense of a deformity, it is the pathological curving of the spine, where parts of the spinal column lose some or all of their lordotic profile. This causes a bowing of the back, seen as a slouching posture. Kyphosis is distinguished from scoliosis, a condition in which the spine has a sideways curve.

While most cases of kyphosis are mild and only require routine monitoring, serious cases can be debilitating. High degrees of kyphosis can cause severe pain and discomfort, breathing and digestion difficulties, cardiovascular irregularities, neurological compromise and, in the more severe cases, significantly shortened life spans. These types of high-end curves typically do not respond well to conservative treatment and almost always warrant spinal fusion surgery, which can restore the body&#x27;s natural degree of curvature.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Complications===
The risk of serious complications from spinal fusion surgery for kyphosis is estimated to be 5%, similar to the risks of surgery for scoliosis. Possible complications include inflammation of the soft tissue or deep inflammatory processes, breathing impairments, bleeding, and nerve injuries. According to the latest evidence, the actual rate of complications may be substantially higher. Even among those who do not develop serious complications, 5% of patients require reoperation within five years of the procedure, and in general it is not yet clear what one would expect from spine surgery during the long-term. Given that the signs and symptoms of spinal deformity cannot be changed by surgical intervention, surgery remains essentially a cosmetic choice. However, the cosmetic effects of surgery are not necessarily stable.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
There are several kinds of kyphosis (ICD-10 codes are provided):
* Postural kyphosis (M40.0), the most common type, normally attributed to slouching, can occur in both the old and the young. In the young, it can be called &quot;slouching&quot; and is reversible by correcting muscular imbalances. In the old, it may be a case of hyperkyphosis and called &quot;dowager&#x27;s hump&quot;. About one third of the most severe hyperkyphosis cases in older people have vertebral fractures. Otherwise, the aging body does tend towards a loss of musculoskeletal integrity, and hyperkyphosis can develop due to aging alone.
* Scheuermann&#x27;s kyphosis (M42.0) is significantly worse cosmetically and can cause varying degrees of pain, and can also affect different areas of the spine (the most common being the midthoracic area). Scheuermann&#x27;s kyphosis is considered a form of juvenile osteochondrosis of the spine and is more commonly called Scheuermann&#x27;s disease. It is found mostly in teenagers and presents a significantly worse deformity than postural kyphosis. A patient with Scheuermann&#x27;s kyphosis cannot consciously correct posture. The apex of the curve, located in the thoracic vertebrae, is quite rigid. The patient may feel pain at this apex, which can be aggravated by physical activity and by long periods of standing or sitting. This can have a significantly detrimental effect on their lives, as their level of activity is curbed by their condition; they may feel isolated or uneasy amongst peers if they are children, depending on the level of deformity. Whereas in postural kyphosis, the vertebrae and discs appear normal, in Scheuermann&#x27;s kyphosis, they are irregular, often herniated, and wedge-shaped over at least three adjacent levels. Fatigue is a very common symptom, most likely because of the intense muscle work that has to be put into standing or sitting properly. The condition appears to run in families. Most patients who undergo surgery to correct their kyphosis have Scheuermann&#x27;s disease.
* Congenital kyphosis (Q76.4) can result in infants whose spinal column has not developed correctly in the womb. Vertebrae may be malformed or fused together and can cause further progressive kyphosis as the child develops. Surgical treatment may be necessary at a very early stage and can help maintain a normal curve in coordination with consistent follow-ups to monitor changes. However, the decision to carry out the procedure can be very difficult due to the potential risks to the child. A congenital kyphosis can also suddenly appear in the teenage years, more commonly in children with cerebral palsy and other neurological disorders.
* Nutritional kyphosis can result from nutritional deficiencies, especially during childhood, such as vitamin D deficiency (producing rickets), which softens bones and results in the curving of the spine and limbs under the child&#x27;s body weight.
* Gibbus deformity is a form of structural kyphosis, often a &quot;sequela&quot; to tuberculosis.
* Post-traumatic kyphosis (M84.0) can arise from untreated or ineffectively treated vertebral fractures.

===Grading===

Kyphosis can be graded in severity by the Cobb angle. Also, &quot;sagittal balance&quot; can be measured. The sagittal balance is the horizontal distance between the center of C7 and the superior-posterior border of the endplate of S1 on a lateral radiograph.

==Treatments==

A diagnosis of kyphosis is generally made through observation and measurement. Idiopathic causes, such as vertebral wedging or other abnormalities, can be confirmed through X-ray. Osteoporosis, a potential cause of kyphosis, can be confirmed with a bone density scan. Postural thoracic kyphosis can often be treated with posture reeducation and focused strengthening exercises. Idiopathic thoracic kyphosis due to vertebral wedging, fractures, or vertebral abnormalities is more difficult to manage, since assuming a correct posture may not be possible with structural changes in the vertebrae. Children who have not completed their growth may show long-lasting improvements with bracing. Exercises may be prescribed to alleviate discomfort associated with overstretched back muscles. A variety of gravity-assisted positions or gentle traction can minimize pain associated with nerve root impingement. Surgery may be recommended for severe kyphosis.

===Brace===
Body braces showed benefit in a randomised controlled trial.

The Milwaukee brace is one particular body brace that is often used to treat kyphosis in the US. Modern CAD/CAM braces are used in Europe to treat different types of kyphosis. These are much easier to wear and have better in-brace corrections than reported for the Milwaukee brace. Since there are different curve patterns (thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbar), different types of brace are in use, with different advantages and disadvantages.

===Physical therapy===
In Germany, a standard treatment for both Scheuermann&#x27;s disease and lumbar kyphosis is the Schroth method, a system of physical therapy for scoliosis and related spinal deformities. It involves lying supine, placing a pillow under the scapular region and posteriorly stretching the cervical spine. In China, many people use spinal care mattresses to correct kyphosis while sleeping.

===Surgery===
Surgical treatment can be used in severe cases. In patients with progressive kyphotic deformity due to vertebral collapse, a procedure called a kyphoplasty may arrest the deformity and relieve the pain. Kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure, requiring only a small opening in the skin. The main goal is to return the damaged vertebra as close as possible to its original height.

===Popular culture===
One of the most well-known and enduring depictions of kyphosis is Quasimodo, the eponymous hero of Victor Hugo&#x27;s 1831 novel &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;, which solidified the popular conception of the hunchback as a destitute and pitiable outcast from European society. The legendary Comprachicos of the sort popularized in Hugo&#x27;s similar work &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; are instead described as being able to turn able-bodied young children into hunchbacks, alongside a variety of other deformities, using poisons and mutilation, before selling their results into bondage as court dwarfs or freak show performers.

Early horror films developed the hunchbacked Igor as a stock character assistant to a mad scientist.

<text>In mathematics, the circle group, denoted by formula_1 or , is the multiplicative group of all complex numbers with absolute value 1, that is, the unit circle in the complex plane or simply the unit complex numbers
formula_2

The circle group forms a subgroup of , the multiplicative group of all nonzero complex numbers. Since formula_3 is abelian, it follows that formula_1 is as well.

A unit complex number in the circle group represents a rotation of the complex plane about the origin and can be parametrized by the angle measure :
formula_5

This is the exponential map for the circle group.

The circle group plays a central role in Pontryagin duality and in the theory of Lie groups.

The notation formula_1 for the circle group stems from the fact that, with the standard topology (see below), the circle group is a 1-torus. More generally, formula_7 (the direct product of formula_1 with itself formula_9 times) is geometrically an formula_9-torus.

The circle group is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group .

== Elementary introduction ==
One way to think about the circle group is that it describes how to add &quot;angles&quot;, where only angles between 0° and 360° or formula_11 or formula_12 are permitted. For example, the diagram illustrates how to add 150° to 270°. The answer is , but when thinking in terms of the circle group, we may &quot;forget&quot; the fact that we have wrapped once around the circle. Therefore, we adjust our answer by 360°, which gives ).

Another description is in terms of ordinary (real) addition, where only numbers between 0 and 1 are allowed (with 1 corresponding to a full rotation: 360° or ), i.e. the real numbers modulo the integers: . This can be achieved by throwing away the digits occurring before the decimal point. For example, when we work out , the answer is 1.1666..., but we may throw away the leading 1, so the answer (in the circle group) is just , with some preference to 0.166..., because .

== Topological and analytic structure ==
The circle group is more than just an abstract algebraic object. It has a natural topology when regarded as a subspace of the complex plane. Since multiplication and inversion are continuous functions on , the circle group has the structure of a topological group. Moreover, since the unit circle is a closed subset of the complex plane, the circle group is a closed subgroup of formula_3 (itself regarded as a topological group).

One can say even more. The circle is a 1-dimensional real manifold, and multiplication and inversion are real-analytic maps on the circle. This gives the circle group the structure of a one-parameter group, an instance of a Lie group. In fact, up to isomorphism, it is the unique 1-dimensional compact, connected Lie group. Moreover, every formula_9-dimensional compact, connected, abelian Lie group is isomorphic to .

== Isomorphisms ==
The circle group shows up in a variety of forms in mathematics. We list some of the more common forms here. Specifically, we show that
formula_15
where the slash () denotes group quotient and formula_16 the existence of an isomorphism between the groups.

The set of all unitary matrices coincides with the circle group; the unitary condition is equivalent to the condition that its element have absolute value 1. Therefore, the circle group is canonically isomorphic to the first unitary group , i.e.,
formula_17
The exponential function gives rise to a map formula_18 from the additive real numbers to the circle group known as Euler&#x27;s formula
formula_19
where formula_20 corresponds to the angle (in radians) on the unit circle as measured counterclockwise from the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis. The property
formula_21
makes formula_18 a group homomorphism. While the map is surjective, it is not injective and therefore not an isomorphism. The kernel of this map is the set of all integer multiples of . By the first isomorphism theorem we then have that
formula_23
After rescaling we can also say that formula_1 is isomorphic to .

The unit complex numbers can be realized as 2×2 real orthogonal matrices, i.e.,
formula_25
associating the squared modulus and complex conjugate with the determinant and transpose, respectively, of the corresponding matrix. As the angle sum trigonometric identities imply that
formula_26
where formula_27 is matrix multiplication, the circle group is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group formula_28, i.e.,
formula_29
This isomorphism has the geometric interpretation that multiplication by a unit complex number is a proper rotation in the complex (and real) plane, and every such rotation is of this form.

== Properties ==
Every compact Lie group formula_30 of dimension &gt; 0 has a subgroup isomorphic to the circle group. This means that, thinking in terms of symmetry, a compact symmetry group acting &quot;continuously&quot; can be expected to have one-parameter circle subgroups acting; the consequences in physical systems are seen, for example, at rotational invariance and spontaneous symmetry breaking.

The circle group has many subgroups, but its only proper closed subgroups consist of roots of unity: For each integer , the formula_9th roots of unity form a cyclic group of order , which is unique up to isomorphism.

In the same way that the real numbers are a completion of the &quot;b&quot;-adic rationals formula_32 for every natural number , the circle group is the completion of the Prüfer group formula_33 for , given by the direct limit .

== Representations ==
The representations of the circle group are easy to describe. It follows from Schur&#x27;s lemma that the irreducible complex representations of an abelian group are all 1-dimensional. Since the circle group is compact, any representation
formula_34
must take values in . Therefore, the irreducible representations of the circle group are just the homomorphisms from the circle group to itself.

For each integer formula_9 we can define a representation formula_36 of the circle group by . These representations are all inequivalent. The representation formula_37 is conjugate to :
formula_38

These representations are just the characters of the circle group. The character group of formula_1 is clearly an infinite cyclic group generated by :
formula_40

The irreducible real representations of the circle group are the trivial representation (which is 1-dimensional) and the representations
formula_41
taking values in . Here we only have positive integers , since the representation formula_42 is equivalent to .

== Group structure ==
The circle group formula_1 is a divisible group. Its torsion subgroup is given by the set of all formula_9-th roots of unity for all formula_9 and is isomorphic to . The structure theorem for divisible groups and the axiom of choice together tell us that formula_1 is isomorphic to the direct sum of formula_47 with a number of copies of .

The number of copies of must be formula_48 (the cardinality of the continuum) in order for the cardinality of the direct sum to be correct. But the direct sum of formula_48 copies of is isomorphic to , as formula_50 is a vector space of dimension formula_48 over . Thus,
formula_52

The isomorphism
formula_53
can be proved in the same way, since is also a divisible abelian group whose torsion subgroup is the same as the torsion subgroup of .

<text>The Caddo people comprise the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, a federally recognized tribe headquartered in Binger, Oklahoma. They speak the Caddo language.

The Caddo Confederacy was a network of Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands, who historically inhabited much of what is now northeast Texas, west Louisiana, southwestern Arkansas, and southeastern Oklahoma. Prior to European contact, they were the Caddoan Mississippian culture, who constructed huge earthwork mounds at several sites in this territory, flourishing about 800 to 1400 CE. In the early 19th century, Caddo people were forced to a reservation in Texas. In 1859, they were removed to Indian Territory.

==Government and civic institutions==
The Caddo Nation of Oklahoma was previously known as the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma. The tribal constitution provides for election of an eight-person council, with a chairperson.

Some 6,000 people are enrolled in the nation, with 3,044 living within the state of Oklahoma. Individuals are required to document at least 1/16 Caddo ancestry in order to enroll as citizens.

In July 2016, Tamara M. Francis was re-elected as the Chairman of the Caddo Nation. Chairman Tamara Francis is the daughter of the first elected female chairman, Mary Pat Francis. She was the fourth elected female leader of the Caddo Nation.

As of 2021 the tribal council consists of:
* Chairman: Bobby Gonzalez
* Vice-chairman: Kelly Howell Factor
* Secretary: Jennifer Reeder
* Treasurer: Verna Castillo
* Anadarko Representative: Phillip Martin
* Binger Representative: Travis Threlkeld
* Fort Cobb Representative: Arlene Kay O&#x27;Neal
* Oklahoma City Representative: Jennifer Wilson.

The tribe has several programs to invigorate Caddo culture. It sponsors a summer culture camp for children. The Hasinai Society and Caddo Culture Club both teach and perform Caddo songs and dances to keep the culture alive and pass it on to the next generations. The Kiwat Hasinay Foundation is dedicated to preserving and increasing use of the Caddo language.

==Precontact history==
===Archaeology===
The Caddo are thought to be an extension of Woodland period peoples, the Fourche Maline and Mossy Grove cultures, whose members were living in the area of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas areas between 200 BCE and 800 CE. The Wichita and Pawnee are also related to the Caddo, since both tribes historically spoke Caddoan languages.

By 800 CE, this society had begun to coalesce into the Caddoan Mississippian culture. Some villages began to gain prominence as ritual centers. Leaders directed the construction of major earthworks known as platform mounds, which served as temple mounds and platforms for residences of the elite. The flat-topped mounds were arranged around leveled, large, open plazas, which were usually kept swept clean and were often used for ceremonial occasions. As complex religious and social ideas developed, some people and family lineages gained prominence over others.

By 1000 CE, a society that is defined by archaeologists as &quot;Caddoan&quot; had emerged. By 1200, the many villages, hamlets, and farmsteads established throughout the Caddo world had developed extensive maize agriculture, producing a surplus that allowed for greater density of settlement. In these villages, artisans and craftsmen developed specialties. The artistic skills and earthwork mound-building of the Caddoan Mississippians flourished during the 12th and 13th centuries.

The Spiro Mounds, near the Arkansas River in present-day southeastern Oklahoma, were some of the most elaborate mounds in the United States. They were made by Mississippian ancestors of the historic Caddo and Wichita tribes, in what is considered the westernmost area of the Mississippian culture. The Caddo were farmers and enjoyed good growing conditions most of the time. The Piney Woods, the geographic area where they lived, was affected by the Great Drought from 1276 to 1299 CE, which covered an area extending to present-day California and disrupted many Native American cultures.

Archeological evidence has confirmed that the cultural continuity is unbroken from prehistory to the present among these peoples. The Caddoan Mississippian people were the direct ancestors of the historic Caddo people and related Caddo-language speakers, such as the Pawnee and Wichita, who encountered the first Europeans, as well as of the modern Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.

===Religion===
The Caddo creation story, as told in their oral history, says the tribe emerged from a cave, called Chahkanina or &quot;the place of crying,&quot; located at the confluence of the Red River of the South and Mississippi River (in northern present-day Louisiana). Their leader, named Moon, instructed the people not to look back. An old Caddo man carried a drum, a pipe, and fire, all of which have continued to be important religious items to the people. His wife carried corn and pumpkin seeds. As people and accompanying animals emerged, the wolf looked back. The exit from the underground closed to the remaining people and animals.

The Caddo peoples moved west along the Red River, which they called &quot;Bah&#x27;hatteno&quot; in Caddo. A Caddo woman, Zacado, instructed the tribe in hunting, fishing, building dwellings, and making clothing. Caddo religion focuses on &quot;Kadhi háyuh&quot;, translating to &quot;Leader Above&quot; or &quot;Leader in the Sky.&quot; In early times, the people were led by priests, including a head priest, the &quot;xinesi&quot;, who could commune with spirits residing near Caddo temples. A cycle of ceremonies developed around important periods of seasonal corn cultivation. Tobacco was also cultivated, and was and is used ceremonially. Early priests drank a purifying sacrament drink made of wild olive leaves.

===Territory===
Centuries before extensive European contact, some of the Caddo territory was invaded by migrating Dhegihan Siouan–speaking peoples: the Osage, Ponca, Omaha, Quapaw, and Kaw. They moved west beginning about 1200 CE after years of warfare with the Haudenosaunee nations in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky. The powerful Iroquois took control of hunting grounds in the area.

The Osage in particular fought the Caddo, pushed them out of some former territory, and became dominant in the region of present-day Missouri, Arkansas, and eastern Kansas. These tribes had become settled in their new territory west of the Mississippi prior to mid-18th-century European contact.

Most of the Caddo historically lived in the Piney Woods ecoregion of the United States, divided among the state regions of East Texas, southern Arkansas, western Louisiana, and southeastern Oklahoma. This region extends up to the foothills of the Ozarks. The Piney Woods are a dense forest of deciduous and pinophyta flora covering rolling hills, steep river valleys, and intermittent wetlands called &quot;bayous&quot;. Caddo people primarily settled near the Caddo River.

When they first encountered Europeans and Africans, the Caddo tribes organized themselves in three confederacies: the Natchitoches, Hasinai, and Kadohadacho. They were loosely affiliated with other neighboring tribes including the Yowani Choctaw. The Natchitoches lived in now northern Louisiana, the Haisinai lived in East Texas, and the Kadohadacho lived near the border of Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.

The Caddo people had a diet based on cultivated crops, particularly maize (corn), but also sunflower, pumpkins, and squash. These foods held cultural significance, as did wild turkeys. They hunted and gathered wild plants, as well.

=== Culture ===
The Caddo Native Americans had a culture that consisted of the hunting and gathering dynamic. The men hunted year round, while the young and healthy women were responsible for the gathering of fruits, seeds, and vegetables for the tribe. Elderly women planted and cultivated the seeds for the season&#x27;s crop. Gathered items included corn, sunflowers, beans, melons, tobacco, and squash during the warm seasons. Acorns and roots were gathered and processed to provide food other than meat in the cold seasons when crops did not grow.

The men used handcrafted bows and arrows to hunt animals such as wild turkey, quail, rabbits, bears, and bison during winter months. Most tools and items were made by women. They made wooden mortars, as well as pots and other utensils out of clay. These wood and clay tools were carved and molded to help with daily jobs like cooking meals for the tribe. These tools were viewed with such reverence that men and women were buried with the items that they had made.

The Caddo also decorated their bodies. Men favored body modifications and ornamentation such as the painting of skin, jewelry, ear piercing, and hair decorations, like braids, adorned with bird feathers or animal fur. While the women of the tribe wore some jewelry and styled their hair similarly to men, most used the art of tattooing to decorate their bodies. Such tattoos covered most of the body, including the face.

==Post-contact history==

The Caddo first encountered Europeans and Africans in 1541 when the Spanish Hernando de Soto Expedition came through their lands. De Soto&#x27;s force had a violent clash with one band of Caddo Indians, the Tula people, near present-day Caddo Gap, Arkansas. This historic event has been marked by the modern town with a monument. 

The Spanish were considered outsiders. All Franciscan missions were set up in peripheral locations in relation to temples complexes which were the center of the Caddo&#x27;s world. The Caddos didn&#x27;t want to move near the missions because they would abandon their sacred fires. According to Fray Isidro Felix de Espinosa, the Caddo believed &quot;our [Spanish] fire is different.&quot; On a deeper level the security of the Caddo relied on centuries of living in dispersed settlements.

French explorers in the early 18th century encountered the Natchitoche in northern Louisiana. They were followed by fur traders from French outposts along the Gulf Coast. Later Catholic missionaries from France and Spain also traveled among the people. The Europeans carried infections such as smallpox and measles, because these were endemic in their societies. As the Caddo peoples had no acquired immunity to such new diseases, they suffered epidemics with high fatalities that destroyed the tribal populations. Influenza and malaria were additional new diseases that caused many deaths among the Caddo.

French traders built their trading posts and associated forts near Caddo villages. These were already important hubs in the Great Plains trading network well before the 18th and 19th centuries. These stations attracted more French and other European settlers. Among such settlements are the present-day communities of Elysian Fields and Nacogdoches, Texas, and Natchitoches, Louisiana. In the latter two towns, early explorers and settlers kept the original Caddo names of the villages.

Having given way over years before the power of the former Ohio Valley tribes, the later Caddo negotiated for peace with the waves of Spanish, French, and finally Anglo-American settlers. After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, by which the United States took over the former French colonial territory west of the Mississippi River, the US government sought to ally with the Caddo peoples. During the War of 1812, American generals such as William Henry Harrison, William Clark, and Andrew Jackson crushed pro-British uprisings among other Southeast Indians, in particular the Creek, also known as Muscogee. Tensions within their tribe resulted in near civil war among the Creek.

Due to the Caddo&#x27;s neutrality and their importance as a source of information for the Louisiana Territory government, the US forces left them alone. But following Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830 under President Andrew Jackson, the federal government embarked on a program of removal of tribes from the Southeast in order to enable European-American settlement. Land-hungry migrants pressed from the east.

In 1835 the Kadohadacho, the northernmost Caddo confederacy, signed a treaty with the US to relocate to independent Mexico (which then included present-day Texas). The area for their reservation in East Texas had been lightly settled by Mexican colonists, but there was rapidly increasing immigration of European Americans here. In 1836, the Anglo-Americans declared independence from Mexico and established the Republic of Texas, an independent nation. The name &quot;Texas&quot; is derived from the &quot;Hasinai&quot; word &quot;táysha&quot;, through the Spanish &quot;Tejas&quot;, meaning &quot;friend&quot;.

On December 29, 1845, the US admitted Texas as a state. At that time, the US federal government forced the Hasinai and the Kadohadacho, as well as remnants of allied Delaware (Lenape) and Yowani to relocate onto the Brazos Reservation. White settlers increased pressure for the Brazos Reservation Indians to move north to Indian Territory. White Texans violently attacked a Caddo encampment just off the reservation on December 26, 1858. Captain Peter Garland from Erath County led this vigilante group. Choctaw Tom led the Caddo. Married to a Hasinai woman, Tom was killed in this fight, along with two other Caddos and five Anadarkos. In 1859, many of the Caddo were relocated to Indian Territory north of Texas (which became as state of Oklahoma in 1907). After the Civil War, the Caddo were concentrated on a reservation located between the Washita and Canadian rivers in Indian Territory.

In the late 19th century, the Caddo adopted the Ghost Dance religion, which was widespread among American Indian nations in the West. John Wilson, a Caddo/Delaware medicine man who spoke only Caddo, was an influential Ghost Dance leader. Practitioners believed that the dance would help them return to their traditional ways and to stop European-American intrusions into their land and culture. In 1880, Wilson became a peyote roadman. The tribe had known the Half Moon peyote ceremony, but Wilson introduced the Big Moon ceremony to them. The Caddo Nation remains very active in the Native American Church today.

===Late 19th century to present===


Congress passed the Dawes Act to promote assimilation of tribes in Indian Territory and to extinguish Indian land claims to enable admission of the territory as a state. It authorized the break up and distribution of tribal communal landholdings into 160-acre allotments for individual households in order for them to establish subsistence family farms along the European-American model. Any tribal lands remaining after such allotments were to be declared &quot;surplus&quot; and sold, including to non-Native Americans. At the same time, tribal governments were to be ended, and Native Americans were to be accepted as US citizens, subject to state and federal laws. Numerous European Americans had already settled outside the tribal territories.

The Caddo vigorously opposed allotment. Whitebread, a Caddo leader, said, &quot;because of their peaceful lives and friendship to the white man, and through their ignorance were not consulted, and have been ignored and stuck away in a corner and allowed to exist by sufferance.&quot; Tribal governments were dismantled at this time, and Native Americans were expected to act as state and US citizens. After some period, the adverse effects of these changes were recognized. The Caddo and other Native American peoples suffered greatly from the disruption of their traditional cultures, and lost much of their lands in the decades after allotment.

==20th-century reorganization==
Under the federal Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936, the Caddo restored their tribal government. They adopted a written constitution and a process of electing officials. They organized in 1938 as the &#x27;Caddo Indian Tribe of Oklahoma.&#x27; They ratified their constitution on 17 January 1938. In 1976, they drafted a new constitution, which continues elected representative government.

During the 20th century, Caddo leaders such as Melford Williams, Harry Guy, Hubert Halfmoon, and Vernon Hunter have helped shape the tribe. In the early 1980s, Mary Pat Francis was the first woman to be elected as tribal chair. Her daughter, Tamara Michele Francis, was elected in 2015, following a time of high divisions. She was re-elected in 2016.

In a special election on June 29, 2002, the tribe adopted six amendments to the constitution. Tribal enrollment is open to individuals with a documented minimum of 1/16 degree Caddo blood quantum.

==21st-century tribal issues==
Sometimes, severe disagreements have developed among factions of the tribe that have not been resolved in elections. In August 2013, a group led by Philip Smith attempted to recall Brenda Shemayme Edwards, the chairman of the Tribal Council. This faction conducted a new election, but the victor stepped down, and Edwards refused to leave office. In October 2013, Smith and his supporters broke into the Caddo Nation headquarters. They chained the front doors from the inside and blocked the entrance to the administration building. The opposition called the Bureau of Indian Affairs Police.

Operation of the tribe was split between two factions. The Court of Indian Offenses, which had been overseeing issues for a year because of the internal conflict, in October 2014 ordered a new election for all positions.

In the January 2015 elections, all the top tribal positions were won by women: Tamara Michele Francis as chair, Carol D. Ross as vice chair, Jennifer Reeder as secretary, and Wildena G. Moffer as treasurer.

In July 2016, Tamara M. Francis was re-elected as the Chairman of the Caddo Nation. The Council consists of Chairman Francis, Vice Chairman Carol D. Ross, Acting Secretary Philip Martin, Treasurer Marilyn McDonald, Oklahoma City Representative Jennifer Wilson, Binger Representative Marilyn Threlkeld, Fort Cobb Representative Maureen Owings.

Chairman Francis is the daughter of the first elected female chairman, Mary Pat Francis (who was elected in the 1980s). Tamara Francis is the fourth elected female leader of the Caddo Nation.

<doc id="508181" wikidata="Q1530859" url="?curid=508181" title="Marine VHF radio">
<text>Marine VHF radio is a worldwide system of two way radio transceivers on ships and watercraft used for bidirectional voice communication from ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore (for example with harbormasters), and in certain circumstances ship-to-aircraft. It uses FM channels in the very high frequency (VHF) radio band in the frequency range between 156 and 174 MHz, designated by the International Telecommunication Union as the &quot;VHF maritime mobile band&quot;. In some countries additional channels are used, such as the L and F channels for leisure and fishing vessels in the Nordic countries (at 155.5–155.825 MHz). Transmitter power is limited to 25 watts, giving them a range of about .

Marine VHF radio equipment is installed on all large ships and most seagoing small craft. It is also used, with slightly different regulation, on rivers and lakes. It is used for a wide variety of purposes, including marine navigation and traffic control, summoning rescue services and communicating with harbours, locks, bridges and marinas.

==Background==
Marine radio was the first commercial application of radio technology, allowing ships to keep in touch with shore and other ships, and send out a distress call for rescue in case of emergency. Guglielmo Marconi invented radio communication in the 1890s, and the Marconi Company installed wireless telegraphy stations on ships beginning around 1900. Marconi built a string of shore stations and in 1904 established the first Morse code distress call, the letters CQD, used until 1906 when SOS was agreed on. The first significant marine rescue due to radio was the 1909 sinking of the luxury liner RMS &quot;Republic&quot;, in which 1,500 lives were saved. This and the 1912 rescue brought the field of marine radio to public consciousness, and marine radio operators were regarded as heroes. By 1920, the US had a string of 12 coastal stations stretched along the Atlantic seaboard from Bar Harbor, Maine to Cape May, New Jersey.

The first marine radio transmitters used the longwave bands. During World War I amplitude modulation was developed, and in the 1920s spark radiotelegraphy equipment was replaced by vacuum tube radiotelephony allowing voice communication. Also in the 1920s, the ionospheric skip or skywave phenomenon was discovered, which allowed lower power vacuum tube transmitters operating in the shortwave bands to communicate at long distances.

Hoping to foil German detection during the World War II Battle of the Atlantic, American and British convoy escorts used Talk-Between-Ships (TBS) radios operating on VHF.

==Types of equipment==
Sets can be fixed or portable. A fixed set generally has the advantages of a more reliable power source, higher transmit power, a larger and more effective antenna and a bigger display and buttons. A portable set (often essentially a waterproof, VHF walkie-talkie in design) can be carried on a kayak, or to a lifeboat in an emergency, has its own power source and is waterproof if GMDSS-approved. A few portable VHFs are even approved to be used as emergency radios in environments requiring intrinsically safe equipment (e.g. gas tankers, oil rigs, etc.).

===Voice-only===
Voice only equipment is the traditional type, which relies totally on the human voice for calling and communicating.
Many lower priced handheld units are voice only as well as older fixed units.

===Digital selective calling===

DSC equipment, a part of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS), provides all the functionality of voice-only equipment and, additionally, allows several other features:
* The ability to call another vessel using a unique identifier known as a Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI). This information is carried digitally and the receiving set will alert the operator of an incoming call once its own MMSI is detected. Calls are set up on the dedicated VHF channel 70 which DSC equipment must listen on continuously. The actual voice communication then takes place on a different channel specified by the caller.
* A distress button, which automatically sends a digital distress signal identifying the calling vessel and the nature of the emergency
* A built in GPS receiver or facility to connect an external GPS receiver so that the user&#x27;s location may be transmitted automatically along with a distress call.

When a DSC radio is bought new the user will get the opportunity to program it with the MMSI number of the ship it is intended to be used on. However to change the MMSI after the initial programming can be problematic and require special proprietary tools. This is allegedly done to prevent theft.

===Automatic identification system===

More advanced transceiver units support AIS. This relies on a GPS receiver built into the VHF equipment or an externally connected one by which the transceiver obtains its position and transmits this information along with some other details about the ship (MMSI, cargo, draught, destination and some others) to nearby ships. AIS operates as a mesh network and full featured units relay AIS messages from other ships, greatly extending the range of this system; however some low-end units are receive only or do not support the relaying functionality.

AIS data is carried on dedicated VHF channels 87B and 88B at a baud rate of 9,600bit/s using GMSK modulation and uses a form of time-division multiplexing.

===Text messaging===
Using the RTCM 12301.1 standard it is possible to send and receive text messages in a similar fashion to SMS between marine VHF transceivers which comply with this standard. However, as of 2019 very few transceivers support this feature. The recipient of the message needs to be tuned to the same channel as the transmitting station in order to receive it.

==Regulation==
In the United States, any person can legally purchase a Marine VHF radio and use it to communicate without requiring any special license as long as they abide by certain rules, but in a great many other countries a license is required to transmit on Marine VHF frequencies.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland and some other European countries both the operator and the equipment must be separately licensed. A &quot;Short Range Certificate&quot; is the minimum requirement to use an installed marine VHF radio. This is usually obtained after completing a course of around two days and passing an exam. This is intended for those operating on lakes and in coastal areas whereas a &quot;Long Range Certificate&quot; is usually recommended for those operating further out as it also covers HF and MF radios as well as INMARSAT systems. Installations fixed on a particular vessel require a Ship Radio License. Portable equipment that could be used in multiple craft, dinghys etc. required a Ship Portable Radio Licence.

===Automatic Transmitter Identification System (marine)===
For use on the inland waterways within continental Europe, a compulsory Automatic Transmitter Identification System (ATIS) transmission conveys the vessel&#x27;s identity after each voice transmission. This is a ten-digit code that is either an encoded version of the ship&#x27;s alphanumeric call sign, or for vessels from outside the region, the ship MMSI prefixed with &quot;9&quot;. The requirement to use ATIS in Europe, and which VHF channels may be used, are strongly regulated, most recently by the Basel agreements.

==Channels and frequencies==
A marine VHF set is a combined transmitter and receiver and only operates on standard, international frequencies known as channels. Channel 16 (156.8 MHz) is the international calling and distress channel. Transmission power ranges between 1 and 25 watts, giving a maximum range of up to about 60 nautical miles (111 km) between aerials mounted on tall ships and hills, and between aerials mounted on small boats at sea level. Frequency modulation (FM) is used, with vertical polarization, meaning that antennas have to be vertical in order to have good reception. For longer range communication at sea, marine MF and marine HF bands and satellite phones can be used.

Half-duplex channels here are listed with the A and B frequencies the same. The frequencies, channels, and some of their purposes are governed by the ITU. For an authoritative list see. The original allocation of channels consisted of only channels 1 to 28 with 50 kHz spacing between channels, and the second frequency for full-duplex operation 4.6 MHz higher.

Improvements in radio technology later meant that the channel spacing could be reduced to 25 kHz with channels 60 to 88 interspersed between the original channels.

Channels 75 and 76 are omitted as they are either side of the calling and distress channel 16, acting as guard channels. The frequencies which would have been the second frequencies on half-duplex channels are not used for marine purposes and can be used for other purposes that vary by country. For example, 161.000 to 161.450 MHz are part of the allocation to the Association of American Railroads channels used by railways in the US and Canada.



==Operating procedure==
Marine VHF mostly uses half-duplex audio equipment and non-relayed transmissions. Ship to ship communication is over a single radio frequency (simplex), while ship to shore often uses full duplex frequency pairs, however the transceivers are usually half-duplex devices that cannot receive when transmitting even on a full-duplex channel. To transmit the user presses a &quot;push to talk&quot; button on the set or microphone which turns the transmitter on and the receiver off in a device with half-duplex audio, even on a full-duplex radio channel; on devices with full-duplex audio the receiver is left on while transmitting on a full-duplex radio channel. Communication can take place in both directions simultaneously on full-duplex channels when the equipment on both ends allows it. Full duplex channels can be used to place calls over the public telephone network for a fee via a marine operator. When equipment supporting full-duplex audio is used, the call is similar to one using a mobile phone or landline. When half-duplex is used, voice is only carried one way at a time and the party on the boat must press the transmit button only when speaking. This facility is still available in some areas, though its use has largely died out with the advent of mobile and satellite phones. Marine VHF radios can also receive weather radio broadcasts, where they are available.

The accepted conventions for use of marine radio are collectively termed &quot;proper operating procedure&quot;. These international conventions include:
* Stations should listen for 30 seconds before transmitting and not interrupt other stations.
* Maintaining a watch listening on Channel 16 when not otherwise using the radio. All calls are established on channel 16, except for distress working switch to a working ship-to-ship or ship-to-shore channel. (procedure varies in the U.S. only when calls can be established on Ch. 9)
* During distress operations silence maintained on ch. 16 for other traffic until the channel is released by the controlling station using the pro-word &quot;Silence Fini&quot;. If a station does use Ch. 16 during distress operations controlling station issues the command &quot;silence mayday&quot;.
* Using a set of international &quot;calling&quot; procedures such as the &quot;Mayday&quot; distress call, the &quot;Pan-pan&quot; urgency call and &quot;Sécurité&quot; navigational hazard call.
* Using &quot;pro-words&quot; based on the English language such as &quot;Acknowledge, All after, All before, All stations, Confirm, Correct, Correction, In figures, In letters, Over, Out, Radio check, Read back, Received, Say again, Spell, Standby, Station calling, This is, Wait, Word after, Word before, Wrong&quot; (local language is used for some of these, when talking to local stations)
* Using the NATO phonetic alphabet: &quot;Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India, Juliett, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-ray, Yankee, Zulu&quot;
* Using a phonetic numbering system based on the English language or a combination of English and Roman languages: &quot;Wun, Too, Tree, Fow-er, Fife, Six, Sev-en, Ait, Nin-er, Zero, Decimal&quot;; alternatively in marine communication: &quot;unaone, bissotwo, terrathree, kartefour, pantafive, soxisix, setteseven, oktoeight, novenine, nadazero&quot;

Slightly adjusted regulations can apply for inland shipping, such as the Basel rules (:de:Regionale Vereinbarung über den Binnenschifffahrtsfunk) in Western Europe.

==Future==

In 2022, the ETSI issued a proposal for implementing the use of FDMA protocols on the band in response to increasingly scarce availability of voice channels in some circumstances owing to the widespread use of systems such as AIS. The plan includes significantly narrower 6.25 kHz channel spacing, and would support voice and data applications.

<text>Diphosphate—fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase also known as PFP is an enzyme of carbohydrate metabolism in plants and some bacteria. The enzyme () catalyses the reversible interconversion of fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate using inorganic pyrophosphate as the phosphoryl donor:

:diphosphate + D-fructose 6-phosphate formula_1 phosphate + D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate

In plants, the PFP is located in the cytosol of the cell and is strongly activated by the signal molecule fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.

PFP is an exclusively cytosolic enzyme that catalyses the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate in the glycolytic direction, and the de-phosphorylation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate in the gluconeogenic reaction. Reeves first isolated PFP from &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;, a lower eukaryote. The first plant PFP isolated was from the leaves of pineapples by Carnal and Black and it has since been isolated from a variety of plant species and tissues.

== Nomenclature ==
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is diphosphate:D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include:
* 6-phosphofructokinase (pyrophosphate), 
* inorganic pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, 
* inorganic pyrophosphate-phosphofructokinase, 
* pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructo-1-kinase, and
* pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, 
* pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate phosphotransferase

<text>Media Lens is a British media analysis website established in 2001 by David Cromwell and David Edwards. Cromwell and Edwards are the site&#x27;s editors and only regular contributors. Their aim is to scrutinise and question the mainstream media&#x27;s coverage of significant events and issues and to draw attention to what they consider &quot;the systemic failure of the corporate media to report the world honestly and accurately&quot;.

Media Lens is financed by donations from website visitors. The editors issue regular &quot;Media Alerts&quot; concentrating on mainstream media outlets such as the BBC and Channel 4 News which are legally obliged to be impartial or on outlets such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; which are usually considered left-leaning. The site&#x27;s editors frequently draw attention to what they see as the limits within which the mainstream media operates, and provide &quot;a riveting exposé of the myth of liberal media based on a variety of empirical case studies&quot;, according to Graham Murdock and Michael Pickering.

Media Lens is admired by John Pilger, who has called the website &quot;remarkable&quot; and described the writers as &quot;the cyber guardians of honest journalism&quot;. Other journalists, in particular Peter Oborne, have also made positive comments about the group, although it has come into conflict with other journalists. &quot;The Observer&quot;″s foreign editor Peter Beaumont asserted that the group ran a &quot;campaign&quot; against John Sloboda and the Iraq Body Count for underestimating the number of deaths in Iraq. George Monbiot wrote that Media Lens was &quot;belittling the acts of genocide&quot; in their defence of Edward S. Herman, who had questioned the number of deaths in the Srebrenica massacre.

==Foundation and influences==
By the late 1990s, David Edwards had concluded that there was a &quot;media suppression of the truth about the effect of the sanctions&quot; against Iraq, and an indifference to climate change: &quot;the media were still celebrating the idea that Britain might soon be blessed with a Mediterranean climate&quot;. Another motivation came from interviewing Denis Halliday, former head of the UN’s humanitarian aid program, after concluding its actions in Iraq were &quot;genocidal&quot;.

Meanwhile, David Cromwell had found coverage of certain issues to be &quot;paltry&quot;, and had gained a negligible response from the newspapers to which he had written. The two men first met in 1999, and Edwards suggested beginning a collaborative website.

Central to Media Lens analysis is the Propaganda model, first developed by Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky, in their book &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; (1988). The theory posits that the way in which news media is structured (through advertising, media ownership, government sourcing and others) creates an inherent conflict of interest which leads to systemic bias and propaganda for undemocratic forces. Edwards has also cited Erich Fromm, who thought &quot;a society that subordinates people and planet to profit is inherently insane and toxic&quot;, and his practice of Buddhism as influences.

Media Lens has expressed admiration for Australian born journalist John Pilger on several occasions. Around 2006, Media Lens said &quot;The Guardian&quot; would not publish Pilger &quot;because he’s honest about the media&quot; and &quot;draws attention to the vital role of the entire liberal media establishment in crimes against humanity. So he is &quot;persona non grata&quot;&quot;. In a 2007 interview, Media Lens said Pilger was a &quot;huge inspiration&quot; and, while discussing his work in the mainstream media, stated that &quot;on the one hand, his work has a tremendous effect in enlightening a lot of people. On the other hand, his work is used to strengthen the propaganda system‘s false claims of honesty and openness&quot;.

Writing in Z Communications in May 2014, Elliot Murphy said that Media Lens pay careful attention to the writings of George Orwell, &quot;noting the prevalence of clichés which should arouse suspicion in any reader of the press or listener of parliamentary debates. These include &#x27;at a time when&#x27;, &#x27;demands difficult choices&#x27;, &#x27;pivotal moment&#x27;, &#x27;towards&#x27;, &#x27;inextricably linked&#x27;, &#x27;courage&#x27;, &#x27;human being&#x27;, &#x27;some people say that&#x27;, &#x27;left of centre&#x27;, and &#x27;history tells us&#x27;. Cromwell and Edwards observe that &#x27;it is not important to make sense in the media; it is important only to be able to bandy the jargon of media discourse in a way that suggests in-depth knowledge: Iran-Contra, IMF, G8, the &quot;roadmap to peace&quot;, &quot;UN resolution 1441&quot;, and so on&#x27; &quot;.

==Activities and main arguments==
In 2001, Media Lens began issuing regular online Media Alerts, scrutinising media coverage, the arguments used, source selection, and the framing of events to highlight bias, omissions and direct lies. The media alerts are distributed without charge by email to an international readership. According to Media Lens, the readership was around 14,000 people in 2009. Funding is through reader subscriptions and donations.

The editors engage in email and Twitter exchanges with British journalists and editors. They also invite their readers to challenge journalists, editors and programme producers directly via email, specifically discouraging abusive contact.

According to Cromwell and Edwards, journalists in the mainstream media articulate an &quot;&#x27;official&#x27; version of events ... as Truth. The testimony of critical observers and participants&quot; and &quot;especially those on the receiving end of Western firepower – are routinely marginalised, ignored and even ridiculed&quot;. The editors &quot;reject all conspiracy theories. Instead, we point to the inevitably corrupting effects of &#x27;market forces&#x27; operating on, and through, media corporations seeking profit in a society dominated by corporate power ... Media employees are part of a corporate system that, unsurprisingly, selects for servility to the needs and goals of corporate power&quot;. They believe that mainstream journalists gradually absorb an unquestioning corporate mindset as their careers progress, becoming unwilling to question their occupations or governments claims, but not consciously lying. They also say that the limitations of the corporate media are not unexpected as &quot;[w]e did not expect the Soviet Communist Party&#x27;s newspaper Pravda to tell the truth about the Communist Party, why should we expect the corporate press to tell the truth about corporate power?&quot;

In Cromwell and Edwards&#x27; opinion, western government actions have followed an &quot;historical pattern of deception&quot; going back several centuries, and &quot;the corporate media is the source of some of the greatest, most lethal illusions of our age&quot;. Edwards wrote that, because of these corporate distortions, &quot;we believe, society is not told the truth about the appalling consequences of corporate greed for poor people in the Third World, and for the environment&quot;.

According to Cromwell and Edwards, the centre-left wing of the mainstream media are gatekeepers &quot;of acceptable debate from a left or Green perspective, &#x27;thus far and no further&#x27;&quot; and that dissenting views have difficulty gaining attention in a corporate system. They have contrasted positive comments the mainstream media make about western leaders, with the epithets used to describe politicians such as Hugo Chávez, Venezuela&#x27;s former President.

In 2013, Media Lens described the corporate media as &quot;an extremist fringe&quot; from which progressives should completely dissociate themselves.

In May 2011, and more extensively in January 2015, Media Lens advocated &quot;a collective of high-profile writers and journalists willing to detach themselves from corporate and state media, and to place themselves entirely at the mercy of the public&quot; with their output freely available &quot;from a single media outlet&quot; and financed by donations. &quot;The support would be vast, &quot;if&quot; the initiative was posited as an alternative to the biocidal, corruption-drenched corporate media&quot;, they said in an interview with The Colossus website in January 2016.

Cromwell wrote in 2016 that, to find coverage of the Yemeni Civil War, &quot;[n]ot unusually, one has to go to media such as&quot; the Russian television network RT and the Iranian news network Press TV, which are &quot;so often bitterly denigrated as &#x27;propaganda&#x27; operations by corporate journalists&quot;.

==Reception==
In December 2002, eighteen months after the site&#x27;s creation, Australian journalist John Pilger described Media Lens as &quot;becoming indispensable&quot;. In a &quot;New Internationalist&quot; interview in 2010, Pilger said Media Lens &quot;has broken new ground with the first informed and literate analysis and criticism of the liberal media&quot;. Regarding their work on the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, he wrote that &quot;Without [Media Lens&#x27;] meticulous and humane analysis, the full gravity of the debacles of Iraq and Afghanistan might have been consigned to bad journalism&#x27;s first draft of bad history&quot;. In a 2007 article about them, John Pilger mentioned their first collaborative book, &quot;Guardians of Power&quot; (2006), and wrote that &quot;not a single national newspaper reviewed the most important book about journalism I can remember&quot;, including the left-wing &quot;Morning Star&quot;. The &quot;Morning Star&quot; did review their second book, &quot;Newspeak In The 21st Century&quot;, in 2009.

Peter Barron, former editor of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; commented in 2005: &quot;In fact I rather like them. David Cromwell and David Edwards, who run the site, are unfailingly polite, their points are well-argued and sometimes they&#x27;re plain right.&quot;

In June 2006, Peter Beaumont wrote in &quot;The Observer&quot; that Media Lens &quot;insist that the only acceptable version of the truth is theirs alone and that everybody else should march to the same step&quot;, and described them as &quot;controlling Politburo lefties&quot;. He likened the group&#x27;s email campaigns to &quot;a train spotters&#x27; club run by Uncle Joe Stalin&quot;. Media Lens responded that &quot;Beaumont was unwilling to challenge even one of the thousands of arguments and facts published in 2,000 pages of Media Alerts and in our book &quot;Guardians Of Power&quot; – so, instead, our &#x27;nastiness&#x27; was the focus of attention&quot;.

The journalist Peter Wilby, wrote in January 2006 that &quot;their basic critique is correct&quot; and he occasionally commissioned Cromwell and Edwards while he was editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. He also wrote that &quot;the Davids are virtually unknown; as leftist critics, they are marginalised.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in July 2008, Wilby described Media Lens as &quot;formidably researched. It avoids easy targets, such as the Mail and Sun, and criticises the Guardian, Independent, Times and Telegraph, arguing the &quot;liberal media&quot; isn&#x27;t as liberal as it thinks it is. Edwards and Cromwell might be described as early examples of citizen journalists&quot;.

In his 2007 book &quot;The Triumph of the Political Class&quot;, journalist Peter Oborne wrote that while researching media coverage of the Iraq war, he had found the site &quot;extremely useful&quot;. Media Lens are &quot;often unfair but sometimes highly perceptive&quot;.

On 2 December 2007, Edwards and Cromwell were awarded the Gandhi International Peace Award. The award was presented by Denis Halliday, the former United Nations Humanitarian Co-ordinator in Iraq, and himself a recipient of the award in 2003.

Oliver Boyd-Barrett, an academic specialising in Communications Studies, said in 2010 that Media Lens possess a &quot;relentless commitment&quot; to assessing the media &quot;on criteria of rationality and humanity, for what they write and fail to write, and doing so in a tone that is determinedly polite and respectful, even when the content is highly critical&quot;.

In February 2011, John Rentoul wrote about his interactions with what he called Media Lens &quot;adherents&quot;. He said an email exchange,&quot;may continue until journalist is too busy to reply or until the snarl of Chomskian-Pilgerism is unwittingly betrayed and journalist realises he or she has not been engaging with a reasonable person. At this point, Media Lens adherent then posts the email chain on the sect&#x27;s website, without notice or permission [beginning a thread]. This is supposed to embarrass the apologist for the corporate media/torture/Tony Blair and expose him to ridicule by other sect members&quot;.

In January 2012, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Michael White, accused Media Lens of suggesting the newspaper&#x27;s two most left-wing writers, Milne and George Monbiot &quot;trim their sails and pull their punches to accommodate their paymasters&quot;. He added: &quot;Media Lens doesn&#x27;t do subtle. Nor do its more acceptable heroes, such as John Pilger or [&quot;The Independent&quot;″s] Robert Fisk&quot;. Media Lens responded that corporate journalists did more than merely “trim sails”. There were “whole areas of thought and discussion are demonstrably off the agenda” and “the corporate nature of the mass media tends to produce performance that defends and furthers the goals of the corporate system”. In May 2016, White wrote that their work suggests &quot;their own editing priorities may be as partisan and un-self-aware as the corporates they so severely condemn&quot;.

In February 2012, the philosopher Rupert Read criticised Media Lens&#x27; use of Michel Chossudovsky and articles by Robert Dreyfuss and Aisling Byrne as sources for the situation in Syria.

In May 2014, Elliot Murphy wrote in ZNet that Media Lens &quot;have carefully exposed the shortcomings and lies of the press&quot; and &quot;their Alerts are invariably well researched, well argued, and often entertaining&quot;. He described their book &quot;Guardians of Power: The Myth of the Liberal Media&quot; as a brilliant assessment of the &quot;balance of reporting when it comes to ‘our’ crimes versus ‘theirs’&quot;. He criticised them for generally confining their suggested actions to email campaigns rather than &quot;direct action, non-violent civil disobedience, or even the odd promotion of an upcoming rally or lecture&quot; and suggested that they &quot;rethink their tactics when trying to influence, typically through electronic means, the actions and thoughts of other political writers and their general readership&quot;. Regarding Media Lens’ criticism of left-wing sources, Murphy wrote: &quot;Writing detailed critiques of corporate media reports is admirable, but isolating yourself from those who could not only help you out, but who may in fact also need your help in undermining the very corporate media forces you’re attempting to expose as fundamentally subservient to power, is not the action of an organisation trying to improve the world&quot;.

In August 2015, Helen Lewis, deputy editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; wrote about an interview she had with Yvette Cooper. Media Lens messaged Lewis on twitter asking why she had not mentioned that Cooper had voted in favour of wars that &quot;wrecked&quot; Iraq and Libya. Media Lens said that Lewis did not reply but &quot;New Statesman&quot; columnist Sarah Ditum wrote an article in which she said Media Lens are &quot;largely engaged in an endless project of separating the anti-war sheep from the goats to be purged&quot;. In response to Ditum, Edwards wrote: &quot;Cooper’s voting record of course has grave implications for the near-certainty of future wars waged on more states around the world. Any reasonable commentator understands the need to pay careful attention to the candidates’ record and thinking on war&quot;.

David Wearing, writing in openDemocracy in September 2015, commented that while the group has &quot;a vocal, dedicated following&quot;, it also has &quot;a long record of alienating potential allies with their purity tests and aggressive oversimplifications&quot;.

In February 2016, Oliver Kamm described Media Lens as a &quot;far-left pressure group&quot; who are &quot;doughty defenders of Venezuela&#x27;s revolutionary regime&quot;.

In March 2016, journalist Owen Jones wrote that the editors&#x27; &quot;attack me with even more force than writers who actually defend the status quo. Those writers confirm their analysis, after all: my presence disrupts it, and therefore I’m actually arguably worse&quot;, accusing them of &quot;once tweeting a paragraph I wrote summing up the arguments of those who attacked critics of Obama, and pretending those arguments were what I actually thought&quot;.

Padraig Reidy wrote in an August 2016 piece for &quot;Little Atoms&quot;, that Media Lens &quot;is only ever asking questions it thinks it already knows the answer to&quot;.

When one of the Media Lens&#x27; editors suggested on twitter in 2018 that young writers should &quot;follow your bliss&quot; (a term coined by the American writer Joseph Campbell) and contribute &quot;what you absolutely love to write to inspire and enlighten other people&quot; rather than bothering about prestige or financial reward, extensive responses were posted on the social media platform. Journalist James Ball responded that writers should try the mainstream first to gain attention for their work as &quot;virtually all of the best journalism comes out of &#x27;corporate&#x27; or &#x27;mainstream&#x27; media&quot;, such as the parliamentary expenses scandal, &quot;the exposure of offshore leaks&quot;, &quot;Iraq War Logs&quot;, &quot;Libor rigging&quot;, and &quot;dozens of other major pieces of accountability stories&quot;.

==Case histories==

===Iraq===

====Justification for war====
In 2002, prior to the Iraq War, Media Lens argued that it was fraudulent for the UK and US governments to justify a war on the basis that Iraq still possessed a credible Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) threat and had an active WMD programme. Media Lens cited the work of former chief UN arms inspector Scott Ritter, who had stated 4 years previously that a thorough investigation by UN inspectors had found that Iraq had &quot;fundamentally disarmed&quot; with 90–95 per cent of its WMD capability eliminated. Media Lens further cited Ritter&#x27;s opinion that it would have been impossible for Iraq to rearm &quot;from scratch&quot; within the four years since the UN had left, given the level of scrutiny they were under.

A 30 April 2003 Media Lens database search, covering the period leading up to and including the invasion of Iraq found that, of the 5,767 articles published by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and its sister paper &quot;The Observer&quot;, only twelve made any mention of Scott Ritter. According to Edwards, this constituted &quot;a shocking suppression of serious and credible dissident views&quot;, which he said were &quot;soon to be entirely vindicated&quot;. Eddie Girdner agreed with Media Lens and cited it as one of the few who had drawn this conclusion before the war began.

According to Richard Alexander, writing in 2010 about the Iraq war, Edwards and Cromwell &quot;trenchantly dissected the servant role the British media played in bolstering the lies to the British public purveyed by the UK government&quot;. After referring to the &quot;mountain of evidence&quot; assembled by Cromwell and Edwards for their argument, John Jewell wrote for &quot;The Conversation&quot; website: &quot;It must be remembered that the press was not completely united in its support for Blair&quot; pointing to the opposition of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; to the invasion of Iraq as an example. Jewell&#x27;s assertion about the &quot;anti-war&quot; &quot;Mirror&quot; was not entirely shared by Media Lens who criticised its respect for Blair&#x27;s &quot;patent sincerity&quot;.

Nick Robinson in &quot;Live From Downing Street&quot; (2012), refers to an exchange between Media Lens and then Head of BBC News Richard Sambrook in late 2002 a few months before the invasion of Iraq:&quot;[W]e believe you are a sincere and well-intentioned person ... but you are at the heart of a system of lethal, institutionalised deception. Like it or not, believe it or not, by choosing to participate in this propaganda system, you and the journalists around you may soon be complicit in mass murder. As things stand, you and your journalists are facilitating the killing and mutilation of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of innocent men, women and children&quot;. Robinson responded to this argument: &quot;It is absurd – not to mention offensive – to suggest that journalists who report both the case for war and the case against it are morally responsible for those who die in it&quot;.

====Reporting of conflict====
In 2003, Media Lens compared the BBC&#x27;s reporting on the Iraq war to &quot;&quot;Boys&#x27; Own&quot; war pornography&quot;. They cited a rhetorical question posed by BBC correspondent Bridget Kendall in 2006, about whether the Iraq war was &quot;justified&quot; or a &quot;disastrous miscalculation&quot; as a demonstration of personal bias, and not meeting the requirement for reporting to be impartial. In their opinion, Kendall&#x27;s question excluded the view, held by the anti-war movement and ex-UN secretary general Kofi Annan, that the war was &quot;an illegal war of aggression&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DC/DE&quot;&gt; (extract from &quot;Newspeak in the 21st Century&quot;, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Media Lens cited comments made by Andrew Marr in 2003, while he was the BBC&#x27;s political editor, in support of their argument that journalists regularly present inflated assessments of the accomplishments of western politicians. They considered Marr to be overtly sympathetic to Tony Blair. In 2003, Cromwell and Edwards said that &quot;there never was an Iraqi threat&quot; and &quot;If Tony Blair and George W. Bush are not guilty of war crimes, who is?&quot;

====Casualty figures====
Media Lens has challenged the mainstream media coverage of the effect of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation on the Iraqi mortality rate.

=====&quot;The Lancet&quot; surveys=====

&quot;The Lancet&quot; published two peer-reviewed studies of the effect of the 2003 invasion and occupation on the Iraqi mortality rate at two separate points in time. Both surveys used recognised statistical methods. The first survey was published in 2004 and estimated an excess death rate of 100,000 Iraqis as a result of the invasion and occupation of Iraq up to that time. The second &quot;Lancet&quot; survey, published in 2006, estimated that, as at the end of June 2006, 655,000 more deaths had occurred since the invasion, than would have been expected in the absence of conflict.

The 2004 &quot;Lancet&quot; survey was discussed by mathematician John Allen Paulos in an article published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Following criticism of the article by Media Lens, Paulos acknowledged he had been wrong to use a &quot;largely baseless personal assessment&quot;, to call into question the findings of &quot;The Lancet&quot; study.

In 2005, Media Lens challenged &quot;The Independent&quot;″s senior leader writer on foreign affairs, Mary Dejevsky, to explain why an editorial in the paper said the results of the 2004 &quot;Lancet&quot; study were obtained &quot;by extrapolating from a small sample&quot; and that &quot;[w]hile never completely discredited, those figures were widely doubted&quot;. Dejevsky responded that, while the sample may have been standard, it seemed small from her &quot;lay perspective&quot;. Her main point &quot;was less based on my impression than on the fact that this technique exposed the authors to the criticisms/dismissal that the govt duly made, and they had little to counter those criticisms with, bar the defence that their methods were standard for those sort of surveys&quot;. The response was considered incoherent by Edward Herman who called it &quot;Massive incompetence in support of a war-apologetic agenda&quot;. According to Mukhopadhyay, the exchange was evidence that journalists, who do not have the statistical expertise to evaluate technical reports, &quot;do not always take the obvious step of seeking expert advice&quot;. Reviewing Media Lens&#x27; engagement with press coverage of &quot;The Lancet&quot; study, Arvind Sivaramakrishna drew a similar conclusion stating, &quot;Political correspondents are clearly ignorant of sampling frames and techniques, confidence limits, significance levels, likelihood estimators, and so on.&quot;

The 2004 survey findings were described as exaggerated and flawed by the US and UK governments which cited a much lower figure, a position which was largely supported in US and UK media coverage. Media Lens said the media &quot;fell into line&quot; with the governments&#x27; view despite earlier accepting the estimates from a similar study by the same researchers, using the same methods, which had estimated 1.7 million deaths in the Congo.

=====The Iraq Body Count=====
The Iraq Body Count project (IBC) was set up by Hamit Dardagan and John Sloboda as an attempt to record civilian deaths resulting from the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. Project volunteers examined news stories for reports of civilian casualties. Each incident reported by at least by two independent news sources was included in a database. As at the middle of 2006, the IBC study estimated between 38,725 and 43,140 civilian deaths arising from the 2003 invasion.

Starting in January 2006, Media Lens began examining the IBC project. Its criticisms were that IBC results were not produced by experts in epidemiology and were not peer reviewed, unlike the two &quot;Lancet&quot; surveys. They also said that studies similar to that of the IBC had been found to only capture a fraction of actual deaths. The lower count produced by the IBC’s method was, Media Lens argued, used by politicians and journalists &quot;particularly of the pro-war variety&quot; (they named &quot;Herald Sun&quot; journalist Adam Bolt(sic) and the Liberal Democrats as their examples) to &quot;downplay the tragedy of the civilian death toll&quot; and &quot;suggest, for example, that the results of the invasion have been far less severe than the consequences of leaving Saddam Hussein in power&quot;.

In April 2006, David Fuller, a &quot;BBC Newsnight&quot; journalist, wrote about Media Lens&#x27; four campaigns against the IBC project&#x27;s methods on the BBC website. The Media Lens editors refused two invitations to appear on &quot;Newsnight&quot; as they did not believe they would be treated fairly on the programme. In response Fuller accused them of &quot;[refusing] to engage in any way that does not allow them total control of the interaction&quot;. In an interview with Fuller, Sloboda said Media Lens was &quot;a pressure group that use[s] aggressive and emotionally destructive tactics&quot;. He acknowledged that Iraq Body Count were &quot;amateurs&quot; but stated this did not have any negative connotations for their work. Also in April, Iraq Body Count published a paper defending its work against criticism. It described the criticism of Media Lens and others as &quot;inaccurate and exaggerated, personal, offensive, and part of a concerted campaign to undermine IBC&#x27;s reputation among those who use our data&quot;.

In June 2006, Peter Beaumont, foreign affairs editor for &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper, accused the Media Lens editors&#x27; of a &quot;campaign apparently designed to silence&quot; John Sloboda and the Iraq Body Count project, because it produced a victim count lower than &quot;The Lancet&quot; study.

===Srebrenica: Chomsky and others===
On 31 October 2005, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper published an interview with Noam Chomsky conducted by Emma Brockes. Chomsky complained about the interview in a letter to the readers’ editor, Ian Mayes, on 3 November 2005, after which Media Lens responded with their first article on this issue on 4 November. Within a few weeks, &quot;The Guardian&quot; apologised to Chomsky for three significant errors in the story including that Brockes had misrepresented Chomsky&#x27;s views on the Srebrenica massacre and the nature of his support for Diana Johnstone. &quot;The Guardian&quot; also wrote that &quot;[n]either Prof Chomsky nor Ms Johnstone have ever denied the fact of the massacre&quot;. Media Lens responded to &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s apology in a second article posted on 21 November. The repercussions of the Brockes interview continued for some time. Ian Mayes, then the readers&#x27; editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote on 12 December 2005 that he and Brockes had received &quot;several hundred&quot; emails from Media Lens followers, who were protesting about Chomsky’s treatment.

In December 2009, Media Lens removed Edward S. Herman and David Peterson’s article, &quot;Open Letter To Amnesty International&quot; from its site. It explained to its readers that the removal was in response to &quot;ill-tempered&quot; comments from some readers and to avoid &quot;publishing defamatory statements from either side&quot;. Soon after, Kamm wrote in his blog for &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper that the article Media Lens had removed repeated false claims about Serb-run detention camps in Bosnia which had led in 2000 to a successful libel action brought against &quot;LM&quot; magazine (originally &quot;Living Marxism&quot;) by ITN.

In 2009, Media Lens summarised Herman and Peterson’s articles on Srebrenica by saying that, although Herman and Peterson were &quot;not denying that mass killings took place at Srebrenica&quot;, they &quot;do not accept the figure cited by Kamm and others, but that they are perfectly entitled to do&quot;. In June 2011, George Monbiot wrote that Media Lens &quot;maintained that Herman and Peterson were &#x27;perfectly entitled&#x27; to talk down the numbers killed at Srebrenica&quot;. He also wrote that Herman and Media Lens had taken &quot;the unwarranted step of belittling the acts of genocide committed by opponents of the western powers&quot;. In response, Media Lens said their argument had been that Herman and Peterson were &quot;perfectly entitled&quot; to debate the facts not that &quot;they are entitled to falsify, mislead, wilfully deceive, or whatever &#x27;talk down&#x27; was intended to suggest&quot;. They also wrote that journalists reporting on the effects of the Iraq war were not accused of ‘genocide denial’ if they chose to use the IBC’s estimate of 100,000 deaths over the Lancet study’s estimate of 655,000 Iraqi dead in 2006. They said &quot;typically, someone is adjudged guilty of ‘genocide denial’ only when they question accounts of crimes committed by official enemies of the West&quot;. Regarding the use of the term &#x27;genocide&#x27; they wrote:

To be clear, we reject the right of any court, any government, indeed anyone, to apply labels like &quot;genocide&quot; to historical events and then, not merely argue but demand that they be accepted. The assumption that human institutions are in possession of Absolute Truth belongs to the era of The Inquisition, not to serious debate.

Kamm wrote in October 2012: &quot;The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) has revealed the identity of 6,598 people missing since the fall of Srebrenica, through DNA analysis of human remains in mass graves. It estimates the total number of victims as around 8,100. If ML maintains that deniers [Herman and Peterson] are &#x27;perfectly entitled&#x27; to their position, it must believe that the ICMP has faked that analysis&quot;. In his opinion, Media Lens &quot;stands with genocide deniers&quot; in its connection with Herman and his colleague, David Peterson, both of whom he linked in their statements about Srebrenica with Holocaust deniers.

===Syria===
Rupert Read, an academic and Green Party politician said that Media Lens tends to talk up the numbers of victims of western actions but minimise those of governments in conflict with the west, such as those of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Slobodan Milošević. He described the articles by Aisling Byrne and Robert Dreyfuss, which Media Lens had used as sources for fatalities in the conflicts in Syria, as &quot;dubious&quot;. He said the effect of this is &quot;tacitly to increase the credibility of Assad&#x27;s black propaganda&quot;. David Edwards responded that there was already enough media coverage of the &quot;crimes of official enemies&quot; which, he said, tended to empower the &quot;US-UK war machine&quot;. He said Media Lens preferred to &quot;challenge the false assumption of US-UK benevolent intentions, the hypocrisy in media reporting, and the belief that war is the only alternative&quot;.

In May 2012, Media Lens had an exchange on twitter with cartoonist and writer Martin Rowson. Rowson had published a cartoon after the Houla massacre depicting a bloodstained Bashar al-Assad. The cartoon also depicted &quot;Angela Merkel and Christine Lagarde lashing a pile of human bones with euro-laden cats-o’-nine-tails&quot;. Media Lens asked Rowson what evidence about the massacre he had used in drawing his cartoon. When Rowson replied that he had &quot;no more evidence than media &amp; UN reports, like anyone else. Also used cartoonist’s hunch&quot;, Media Lens asked whether he would &quot;rely on a “hunch” in depicting Obama and Cameron with mouths smeared with the blood of massacred children?&quot; &quot;Tribune magazine&quot; published an article by Howson about the exchange in which he asked why Media Lens had not sought his &quot;evidence for alleging that Merkel and Lagarde have really truly desecrated corpses, as depicted in my cartoon&quot;. He said one possible reason was they were &quot;shilling for tyrants&quot;.

In February 2017, Media Lens compared the media coverage of comments made on Syria by Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesperson Seumas Milne in October 2016 with the coverage of UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson’s comments in January 2017. Media Lens wrote that Johnson’s change in policy, announced in January 2017, to accept that President Bashar al-Assad should be allowed to stand for election and remain in power, was the result of newly elected President Trump’s opposition to Obama’s war for regime change in Syria. They said Milne’s comments were &quot;not defending Assad, merely calling for greater attention to US-UK atrocities&quot;. They described the media reaction as &quot;ferocious criticism of Milne’s innocuous comments and the complete absence of any criticism of Johnson’s policy shift&quot;. According to them, the reason for the difference was that &quot;the corporate media system is ideologically aligned against an authentically left-wing Labour leader, is working to undermine his reputation, and to protect the reputation of the Conservative government&quot;. Media Lens described the media’s &quot;supposed compassion for the Syrian people&quot; as &quot;manufactured, fake&quot;.

In June 2017, the German newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot; published an article by Seymour Hersh in which he said the attack by the Syrian government at Khan Shaykhun in April 2017 did not involve sarin and that US intelligence knew this. Hersh wrote that his sources said the attack struck a building which housed &quot;fertilisers, disinfectants and other goods&quot;. Media Lens tweeted that their search of a newspaper database showed no mention of Hersh’s report. In June 2017, journalist Brian Whitaker criticised Media Lens for being unconcerned that Hersh had not provided the sources for his story. Whitaker wrote that Media Lens had previously criticised &quot;The Guardian&quot; for quoting &quot;unnamed American officials&quot; in a story about Iraq.

<doc id="508197" wikidata="Q317942" url="?curid=508197" title="Euhemerus">
<text>Euhemerus (; also spelled Euemeros or Evemerus; &quot;Euhēmeros&quot;, &quot;happy; prosperous&quot;; late fourth century BC) was a Greek mythographer at the court of Cassander, the king of Macedon. Euhemerus&#x27; birthplace is disputed, with Messina in Sicily as the most probable location, while others suggest Chios or Tegea.

The philosophy attributed to and named for Euhemerus, euhemerism, holds that many mythological tales can be attributed to historical persons and events, the accounts of which have become altered and exaggerated over time.

Euhemerus&#x27;s work combined elements of fiction and political utopianism. Early Christian writers, such as Lactantius, used Euhemerus&#x27;s belief that the ancient gods were originally human to confirm their inferiority regarding the Christian God.

==Life==
Little is known about Euhemerus&#x27;s life, and his birthplace is disputed. Classical writers such as Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, and Polybius, maintained that Euhemerus was a Messenian, but did not specify whether he came from the Peloponnesian or the Sicilian Messene, which was an ancient Greek colony. Other ancient testimonies placed his birth at Chios, Tegea (Pseudo-Plutarch, &quot;Plac. Phil.&quot;), or Agrigentum (Clement of Alexandria, &quot;Protrept.&quot;; Arnobius, &quot;Adv. Gent.&quot;). Most modern scholars, however, generally agree that Euhemerus came from the Sicilian Messene (Messina).

Diodorus Siculus is one of the very few sources who provide other details about Euhemerus&#x27; life. According to Diodorus, Euhemerus was a personal friend of Cassander, king of Macedonia (c. 305 – 297 BC) and the most prominent mythographer for the Macedonian court. Sometime in the early third century BC Euhemerus wrote his main work &quot;Sacred History&quot; (&quot;Hiera Anagraphê&quot;).

===Euhemerus&#x27; &quot;Sacred History&quot;===
Only quoted fragments remain from Euhemerus&#x27; main work, &quot;Sacred History&quot;. Diodorus Siculus included fragments from Euhemerus’ writings in the Arabian geography of his fifth book and in the mythology of his sixth book.

The sixth book of Diodorus’ &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; is lost, but Eusebius cites a fragment from it at length in his &quot;Praeparatio evangelica&quot;. The ancient Roman writer Ennius first translated Euhemerus&#x27; work into Latin, but this translation also is lost. Lactantius however in the third century AD included substantial references to Ennius&#x27; translation in the first book of his &quot;Divine Institutes&quot;. Various other fragments of importance are also found in the later literature of Augustine of Hippo. From these extant fragments and references, modern scholars have been able to &quot;compile what is presumably a fairly complete picture of Euhemerus’ work&quot;.

Euhemerus&#x27; work may have taken the form of a philosophical fictionalized travelogue, universally accepted today as a philosophical Romance, incorporating imagined archaic inscriptions, which his literary persona claimed to have found during his travels. Euhemerus claims to have traveled to a group of islands in the waters off Arabia. One of these, Panchaea, being home to a utopian society made up of a number of different ethnic tribes. His critique of tradition is epitomized in a register of the births and deaths of many of the deities, which his narrator persona discovered inscribed on a golden pillar in a temple of Zeus Triphylius on the invented island of Panchaea; he claimed to have reached the island on a voyage down the Red Sea round the coast of Arabia, undertaken at the request of Cassander, according to the Christian historian of the fourth century AD, Eusebius.

Euhemerus refers to a rational island utopia. The ancient Hellenic tradition of a distant Golden Age, of Hesiod&#x27;s depiction of human happiness before the gift of Pandora, of the mythic convention of idealized Hyperboreans, made concrete in the legendary figure of the Scythian philosopher-hero Anacharsis, or the idealized &quot;Meropes&quot; of Theopompus had been recently enriched by contacts with India. Euhemerus apparently systematized a method of interpreting the popular myths, which was consistent with the attempts of Hellenistic culture to explain traditional religious beliefs in terms of a naturalism. Euhemerus asserted that the Greek gods originally had been kings, heroes, and conquerors, or benefactors to the people, who had thus earned a claim to the veneration of their subjects. According to him, for example, Zeus was a king of Crete, who had been a great conqueror; the tomb of Zeus was shown to visitors near Knossos, perhaps engendering or enhancing among the traditionalists the reputation of Cretans as liars.

==Euhemerism==

Euhemerus has become known chiefly for a rationalizing method of interpretation, known as &quot;euhemerism&quot;, which treats mythological accounts as a reflection of historical events, or mythological characters as historical personages, but which were shaped, exaggerated, or altered by retelling and traditional &quot;mores&quot;. In more recent literature of myth, such as in &quot;Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology&quot;, euhemerism is called the &quot;historical interpretation&quot; of mythology. Euhemerism is defined in modern academic literature as the theory that myths are distorted accounts of real historical events. Euhemerus was not the first to attempt to rationalize mythology through history, as euhemeristic views are found in earlier writers, including Xenophanes, Herodotus, Hecataeus of Abdera, and Ephorus, however, Euhemerus is credited as having developed the theory in application to all myths, considering mythology to be &quot;history in disguise&quot;.

The albums lead single, &quot;Breathe&quot;, earned Etheridge a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. &quot;Tuesday Morning&quot; was dedicated to the memory of Mark Bingham and his family and friends, paying tribute to all the heroes of 9/11.

Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Etheridge was diagnosed with breast cancer and was forced to cancel all promotion to undergo chemotherapy treatments.

<doc id="508209" wikidata="Q1363338" url="?curid=508209" title="Global Maritime Distress and Safety System">
<text>The Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) is a worldwide system for automated emergency signal communication for ships at sea developed by the United Nations&#x27; International Maritime Organization (IMO) as part of the SOLAS Convention.

It is a set of safety procedures, types of equipment, and communication protocols used for safety and rescue operations of the distressed ships, boats, and aircraft. It is supplemental to the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (ICMSaR) adopted in 1979 and provides basis for the communication.

GMDSS consists of several systems which are intended to perform the following functions: alerting (including position determination of the ship in distress) ships in the vicinity and ashore authorities, search and rescue coordination, locating (homing), maritime safety information broadcasts, general communications, and bridge-to-bridge communications. Specific radio carriage requirements depend upon the ship&#x27;s area of operation, rather than its tonnage. The system also provides redundant means of distress alerting, and emergency sources of power.

Recreational vessels do not need to comply with GMDSS radio carriage requirements, but will increasingly use the Digital Selective Calling (DSC) Marine VHF radios. Offshore vessels may elect to equip themselves further. Vessels under 300 gross tonnage (GT) are not subject to GMDSS requirements.

==History==
Since the invention of radio at the end of the 19th century, ships at sea have relied on Morse code, invented by Samuel Morse and first used in 1844, for distress and safety telecommunications. The need for ship and coast radio stations to have and use radiotelegraph equipment, and to listen to a common radio frequency for Morse encoded distress calls, was recognized in the aftermath of the sinking of the liner RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in the North Atlantic in 1912. The U.S. Congress soon enacted legislation, requiring U.S. ships to use Morse code radiotelegraph equipment for distress calls. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)—which now is a United Nations agency—followed suit for ships of all nations. Morse encoded distress calling has saved thousands of lives since its inception almost a century ago, but its use requires skilled radio operators spending many hours listening to the radio distress frequency. Its daytime range on the medium frequency (MF) distress band (500 kHz) is limited, and the amount of traffic Morse signals can carry is also limited.

Not all ship-to-shore radio communications were short-range. Some radio stations provided long-range radiotelephony services, such as radio telegrams and radio telex calls, on the HF bands (3–30 MHz) enabling worldwide communications with ships. For example, Portishead Radio, which was the world&#x27;s busiest radiotelephony station, provided HF long-range services. In 1974, it had 154 radio operators who handled over 20 million words per year. Such large radiotelephony stations employed large numbers of people and were expensive to operate. By the end of the 1980s, satellite services had started to take an increasingly large share of the market for ship-to-shore communications.

For these reasons, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations agency specializing in safety of shipping and preventing ships from polluting the seas, began looking at ways of improving maritime distress and safety communications. In 1979, a group of experts drafted the ICMSaR, which called for development of a global search and rescue plan. This group also passed a resolution calling for development by IMO of a Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) to provide the communication support needed to implement the search and rescue plan. This new system, which the world&#x27;s maritime nations are implementing, is based upon a combination of satellite and terrestrial radio services, and has changed international distress communications from being primarily ship-to-ship based to ship-to-shore (Rescue Coordination Center) based. It spelled the end of Morse code communications for all but a few users, such as amateur radio operators. The GMDSS provides for automatic distress alerting and locating in cases where a radio operator does not have time to send an SOS or MAYDAY call, and, for the first time, requires ships to receive broadcasts of maritime safety information which could prevent a disaster from happening in the first place. In 1988, IMO amended the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, requiring ships subject to it to fit GMDSS equipment. Such ships were required to carry NAVTEX and satellite EPIRBs by August 1, 1993, and had to fit all other GMDSS equipment by February 1, 1999. US ships were allowed to fit GMDSS in lieu of Morse telegraphy equipment by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.

==Components of GMDSS==
The main types of equipment used in GMDSS are:

===Emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB)===
Cospas-Sarsat is an international satellite-based search and rescue system, established by Canada, France, the United States, and Russia. These four countries jointly helped develop the 406 MHz Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB), an element of the GMDSS designed to operate with Cospas-Sarsat system. These automatic-activating EPIRBs, now required on SOLAS ships, commercial fishing vessels, and all passenger ships, are designed to transmit to alert rescue coordination centers via the satellite system from anywhere in the world. The original COSPAS/SARSAT system used polar orbiting satellites, but in recent years the system has been expanded to also include 4 geostationary satellites and 50 medium orbiting navigation satellites. Newest designs incorporate GPS receivers to transmit highly accurate positions (within about 20 metres) of the distress position. EPIRB manufacturers offer AIS (Automatic Identification System) enabled beacons. 406 MHz EPIRBs transmit an ID which is linked to a database of information about the vessel. Typically a vessel has a unique ID: MMSI.
The serviceability of these items is checked monthly and annually and they have limited battery shelf life, between two and five years using mostly lithium-type batteries.

===NAVTEX===
Navtex is an international, automated system for instantly distributing maritime safety information (MSI) which includes navigational warnings, weather forecasts and weather warnings, search and rescue notices and similar information to ships. A small, low-cost and self-contained &quot;smart&quot; printing radio receiver is installed on the bridge, or the place from where the ship is navigated, and checks each incoming message to see if it has been received during an earlier transmission, or if it is of a category of no interest to the ship&#x27;s master. The frequency of transmission of these messages is 518 kHz in English, while 490 kHz is sometime used to broadcast in a local language.
The messages are coded with a header code identified by the using single letters of the alphabet to represent broadcasting stations, type of messages, and followed by two figures indicating the serial number of the message.
For example:
FA56 where F is the ID of the transmitting station, A indicates the message category &quot;navigational warning&quot;, and 56 is the consecutive message number.

===Satellite===
As of January 2020, there are two certified providers of GMDSS satellite services: Inmarsat, with several of their commsats in equatorial geosynchronous orbit, and Iridium Communications, with their 66-satellite constellation in low Earth orbit (LEO) that can cover higher latitudes and operate with lower communications latency. The certification of Iridium in 2020 ended a monopoly on the provision of the satellite-based portion of maritime distress services that had previously been held by Inmarsat since the system became operational in 1999.

Satellite systems operated by the Inmarsat company, overseen by the International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO) are important elements of the GMDSS. The types of Inmarsat ship earth station terminals recognized by the GMDSS are: Inmarsat C and F77. Inmarsat F77, an updated version of the now redundant Inmarsat A and B, provide ship-to-shore, ship-to-ship and shore-to-ship telephone, telex and high-speed data services, including a distress priority telephone and telex service to and from rescue coordination centers. Fleet 77 fully supports the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) and includes advanced features such as emergency call prioritisation. Unfortunately Fleet 77 has an end of life scheduled for 1 December 2020. No definite alternatives are currently defined. The Inmarsat C provides ship/shore, shore/ship and ship/ship store-and-forward data and email messaging, the capability for sending preformatted distress messages to a rescue coordination center, and the Inmarsat C SafetyNET service. The Inmarsat C SafetyNET service is a satellite-based worldwide maritime safety information broadcast service of high seas weather warnings, NAVAREA navigational warnings, radionavigation warnings, ice reports and warnings generated by the USCG-conducted International Ice Patrol, and other similar information not provided by NAVTEX. SafetyNET works similarly to NAVTEX in areas outside NAVTEX coverage.

Inmarsat C equipment is relatively small and lightweight, and costs much less than a F77 station. A F77 ship earth station requires a relatively large gyro-stabilized unidirectional antennas; the antenna size of the Inmarsat C is much smaller and is omnidirectional. Inmarsat C being a low power system allows for its operation from the vessels emergency 24volt battery supply under emergency conditions. This coupled to the omni directional antenna arrangements allow for a guaranteed response to a distress alert between 76 degrees North and 76 degrees South (Sea area A3).

Under a cooperative agreement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), combined meteorological observations and AMVER reports can now be sent to both the USCG AMVER Center, and NOAA, using an Inmarsat C ship earth station, at no charge.

SOLAS now requires that Inmarsat C equipment have an integral satellite navigation receiver, or be externally connected to a satellite navigation receiver. That connection will ensure accurate location information to be sent to a rescue coordination center if a distress alert is ever transmitted.

Also, the new LRIT long-range tracking systems are upgraded via GMDSS Inmarsat C, which are also compliant, along with inbuilt SSAS, or ship security alert system. SSAS provides a means to covertly transmit a security alert distress message to local authorities in the event of a mutiny, pirate attack, or other hostile action towards the vessel or its crew.

===High frequency===
A GMDSS system may include high-frequency (HF) radiotelephone and radiotelex (narrow-band direct printing) equipment, with calls initiated by digital selective calling (DSC). Worldwide broadcasts of maritime safety information can also be made on HF narrow-band direct printing channels. All ships trading in Sea area A4 must carry HF DSC and NBDP equipment which can also operate from the ships reserve energy supply (typically a 24v battery supply). This HF provision is necessary as the Inmarsat coverage does not extend to the polar regions.

===Search and rescue transponder (SART)===

The GMDSS installation on ships include one (two on vessels over 500 GT) search-and-rescue locating device called Search and Rescue Radar Transponders (SART) which are used to locate survival craft or distressed vessels by creating a series of twelve dots on a rescuing ship&#x27;s 3 cm radar display. The detection range between these devices and ships, dependent upon the height of the ship&#x27;s radar mast and the height of the Search and Rescue Locating device, is normally about 15 km (8 nautical miles).
Once detected by radar, the Search and Rescue Locating device will produce a visual and aural indication to the persons in distress.

===Digital selective calling ===

The IMO also introduced digital selective calling (DSC) on MF, HF and VHF maritime radios as part of the GMDSS system. DSC is primarily intended to initiate ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore and shore-to-ship radiotelephone and MF/HF radiotelex calls. DSC calls can also be made to individual stations, groups of stations, or &quot;all stations&quot; in one&#x27;s radio range. Each DSC-equipped ship, shore station and group is assigned a unique 9-digit Maritime Mobile Service Identity.

DSC distress alerts, which consist of a preformatted distress message, are used to initiate emergency communications with ships and rescue coordination centers. DSC was intended to eliminate the need for persons on a ship&#x27;s bridge or on shore to continuously guard radio receivers on voice radio channels, including VHF channel 16 (156.8 MHz) and 2182 kHz now used for distress, safety and calling. A listening watch aboard GMDSS-equipped ships on 2182 kHz ended on February 1, 1999. In May 2002, IMO decided to postpone cessation of a VHF listening watch aboard ships. That watchkeeping requirement had been scheduled to end on February 1, 2005.

IMO and ITU both require that the DSC-equipped MF/HF and VHF radios be externally connected to a satellite navigation receiver (GPS). That connection will ensure accurate location information is sent to a rescue coordination center if a distress alert is transmitted. The FCC requires that all new VHF and MF/HF maritime radiotelephones type accepted after June 1999 have at least a basic DSC capability.

VHF digital selective calling also has other capabilities beyond those required for the GMDSS. The US Coast Guard uses this system to track vessels in Prince William Sound, Alaska, Vessel Traffic Service. IMO and the USCG also plan to require ships carry a Universal Shipborne automatic identification system, which will be DSC-compatible. Countries having a GMDSS A1 Area should be able to identify and track AIS-equipped vessels in its waters without any additional radio equipment. A DSC-equipped radio cannot be interrogated and tracked unless that option was included by the manufacturer, and unless the user configures it to allow tracking.

GMDSS telecommunications equipment should not be reserved for emergency use only. The International Maritime Organization encourages mariners to use GMDSS equipment for routine as well as safety telecommunications.

===Power supply requirements===
GMDSS equipment is required to be powered from three sources of supply:

* ship&#x27;s normal alternators/generators;
* ship&#x27;s emergency alternator/generator (if fitted); and
* a dedicated radio battery supply.

The batteries are required to have a capacity to power the equipment for 1 hour on ships with an emergency generator or built prior to February 1995, and 6 hours on ships not fitted with an emergency generator or built after February 1995 in order to comply with SOLAS. The batteries must be charged by an automatic charger, which is also required to be powered from the main and emergency generators. Changeover from AC to battery supply must be automatic, and effected in such a way that any data held by the equipment is not corrupted (&quot;no break&quot;).

During Coast Guard inspections, the batteries must be able to go from 100% discharge to fully charged in no longer than 10 hours in order to pass certification. The charger too must be obtainable at all times during vessel operation and should be inspected to make sure it functions properly. When the reserve source of energy consists of batteries, the battery capacity must be checked at intervals not exceeding 12 months. If not completed within past 12 months, this must be done during inspection.

Storage batteries provided as a reserve source of energy must be installed in accordance with applicable electrical codes and good engineering practice. They must be protected from adverse weather and physical damage. They must be readily accessible for maintenance and replacement.

==GMDSS sea areas==
GMDSS sea areas serve two purposes: to describe areas where GMDSS services are available, and to define what radio equipment GMDSS ships must carry (carriage requirements). Prior to the GMDSS, the number and type of radio safety equipment ships had to carry depended upon its tonnage. With GMDSS, the number and type of radio safety equipment ships have to carry depends upon the GMDSS areas in which they travel. GMDSS sea areas are classified into the following four areas: A1, A2, A3 and A4. In 2024 the definitions of A3 and A4 were updated to account for the global coverage now provided by Iridium. 

*Sea Area A1—An area within the radiotelephone coverage of at least one VHF coast station in which continuous digital selective calling (Ch.70/156.525 MHz) alerting and radiotelephony services are available. Such an area could extend typically from the Coast Station.
*Sea area A2—An area within a coverage of at least one coast station continuous listening on MF (2187.5 kHz) other than Area A1
*Sea Area A3—An area, excluding sea areas A1 and A2, within the coverage of an RMSS (Recognised Mobile Satellite System). For ships fitted with Inmarsat geostationary satellite, this area lies between about latitude 76 Degrees North and South, but excludes A1 and/or A2 designated areas. Inmarsat guarantees their system will work between 70 South and 70 North though it will often work to 76 degrees South or North. For vessel fitted with Iridium A3 also includes the polar regions
*Sea Area A4—An area outside Sea Areas A1, A2 and A3 is called Sea Area A4. For ships fitted with Inmarst as their RMSS this is essentially the polar regions, north and south of about 76 degrees of latitude, excluding any A1, A2 and A3 areas. For ships that carry Iridium as their RMSS, there is no Area A4.
In addition to equipment listed, all GMDSS-regulated ships must carry a satellite EPIRB, a NAVTEX receiver (if they travel in any areas served by NAVTEX), an Inmarsat-C SafetyNET receiver (if they travel in any areas not served by NAVTEX), a DSC-equipped VHF radiotelephone, two (if between 300 and less than 500 GRT) or three VHF handhelds (if 500 GRT or more), and two 9 GHz search and rescue radar transponders (SART).

===GMDSS radio equipment required for U.S. coastal voyages===
Presently, until an A1 or A2 Sea Area is established, GMDSS-mandated ships operating off the U.S. coast must fit to Sea Areas A3 (or A4) regardless of where they operate. U.S. ships whose voyage allows them to always remain within VHF channel 16 coverage of U.S. Coast Guard stations may apply to the Federal Communications Commission for an individual waiver to fit to Sea Area A1 requirements. Similarly, those who remain within 2182 kHz coverage of U.S. Coast Guard stations may apply for a waiver to fit to Sea Area A2 requirements.

As of August 2013, the U.S. Coast Guard provides a Sea Area A1 service through its Rescue 21 system.

==Licensing of operators (USA)==
National maritime authorities may issue various classes of licenses.
The General Operator’s Certificate is required on SOLAS vessels operating also outside GMDSS Sea Area A1, while a Restricted Operator’s Certificate is needed on SOLAS vessels operated solely within GMDSS Sea Area A1,

Long Range Certificate may be issued, and is required on non-SOLAS vessels operating outside GMDSS Sea Area A1, while a Short Range Certificate is issued for non-SOLAS vessels operating only inside GMDSS Sea Area A1.

Finally there is a restricted radiotelephone operator&#x27;s certificate, which is similar to the Short Range Certificate but limited VHF DSC radio operation. Some countries do not consider this adequate for GMDSS qualification.

In the United States four different GMDSS certificates are issued:

* A GMDSS Radio Maintainer&#x27;s License allows a person to maintain, install, and repair GMDSS equipment at sea.
* A GMDSS Radio Operator&#x27;s License is necessary for a person to use required GMDSS equipment.
* The holder of both certificates can be issued one GMDSS Radio Operator/Maintainer License.
* Finally, the GMDSS Restricted License is available for VHF operations only within of the coast.

To obtain any of these licenses a person must be a U.S. citizen or otherwise eligible for work in the country, be able to communicate in English, and take written examinations approved by the Federal Communications Commission. Like the amateur radio examinations, these are given by private, FCC-approved groups. These are generally not the same agencies who administer the ham tests. Written test elements 1 and 7 are required for the Operator license, and elements 1 and 7R for the Restricted Operator. (Passing element 1 also automatically qualifies the applicant for the Marine Radiotelephone Operator Permit, the MROP.)

For the Maintainer license, written exam element 9 must be passed. However, to obtain this certificate an applicant must also hold a General radiotelephone operator license (GROL), which requires passing commercial written exam elements 1 and 3 (and thus supersedes the MROP). Upon the further passing of optional written exam element 8 the ship radar endorsement will be added to both the GROL and Maintainer licenses. This allows the holder to adjust, maintain, and repair shipboard radar equipment.

Until March 25, 2008 GMDSS operator and maintainer licenses expired after five years but could be renewed upon payment of a fee. On that date all new certificates were issued valid for the lifetimes of their holders. For those still valid but previously issued with expiration dates, the FCC states:

Any GMDSS Radio Operator&#x27;s License, Restricted GMDSS Radio Operator&#x27;s License, GMDSS Radio Maintainer&#x27;s License, GMDSS Radio Operator/Maintainer License, or Marine Radio Operator Permit that was active, i.e., had not expired, as of March 25, 2008, does not have to be renewed.

Since an older certificate does show an expiration date, for crewmembers sailing internationally it may be worth paying the fee (as of 2010 it was $60) to avoid any confusion with local authorities.

Finally, to actually serve as a GMDSS operator on most commercial vessels the United States Coast Guard requires additional classroom training and practical experience beyond just holding a license.

==Licensing of operators (UK and Europe)==

In the United Kingdom and Europe four different GMDSS certificates of Competence are issued:

* Short Range Certificate (SRC)
* Long Range Certificate (LRC)
* Restricted Operator Certificate (ROC)
* General Operator Certificate (GOC)

Each certificate is issued on the successful completion of a course and exam and each Certificate is recognised internationally.

Which Certificate of Competence a seafarer requires will depend on two factors. Firstly officers on board SOLAS vessels (GMDSS compulsory fit vessels) require the ROC or GOC. Operators onboard non SOLAS vessels (which includes leisure craft) may take the shorter Short Range Certificate or Long Range Certificate Courses.

The second deciding factor is the intended operating area of the vessel. Craft operating exclusively in
Sea Area A1 can use the SRC or ROC certificates, where as vessels venturing further offshore into Sea Areas A2, A3 and/or A4 require the LRC or GOC.

<text>Digital selective calling (DSC) is a standard for transmitting predefined digital messages via the medium-frequency (MF), high-frequency (HF) and very-high-frequency (VHF) maritime radio systems. It is a core part of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS).

==Workings==
DSC was developed to replace a voice call in older procedures. Because a DSC signal uses a stable signal with a narrow bandwidth and the receiver has no squelch, it has a slightly longer range than analog signals, with up to twenty-five percent longer range and significantly faster. DSC senders are programmed with the ship&#x27;s Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) and may be connected to the ship&#x27;s Global Positioning System (GPS), which allows the apparatus to know who it is, what time it is and where it is. This allows a distress signal to be sent very quickly.

Often, ships use separate VHF DSC and MF/HF DSC controllers. For VHF, DSC has its own dedicated receiver for monitoring Channel 70, but uses the main VHF transceiver for transmission. However, for the user, the controller is often a single unit. MF/HF DSC devices monitor multiple bands for distress, urgency and safety &quot;sécurité&quot; transmissions in the 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 MHz marine bands. At minimum, controllers will monitor 2187.5 kHz and 8414.5 kHz and one more band. However for automated monitoring a second, receive-only antenna is often needed (especially on non-commercial leisure boats) since a separate tuner is used apart from the main one; this is separate from programming radios to monitor user-defined DSC frequencies (which would use the main antenna).

==Distress==
When sending a distress signal, the DSC device will at minimum include the ship&#x27;s MMSI number. It may also include the coordinates if radio is connected to GPS system and, if necessary, the channel for the following radiotelephony or radiotelex messages. The distress can be sent either as a single-frequency or multi-frequency attempt. In the former, a distress signal is sent on one band and the system will wait up to four minutes for a DSC acknowledgment from a coast station. If none is received, it will repeat the distress alert up to five times. In a multi-frequency attempt, the distress signal is sent on the MF and all the HF distress frequencies in turn. As this requires retuning the antenna for each sending, without waiting for an acknowledgment, a multi-frequency attempt should only be done if there are only a few minutes until the ship&#x27;s batteries are under water. As the distress message can only be sent on one of the bands, many ships and coast stations may be listening to a band without the message, and will after five minutes relay the distress signal to a coast station.

Distress calls can be both non designated and designated. The latter allows one of ten predefined designations to be sent along with the distress signal. These are &quot;abandoning ship&quot;, &quot;fire or explosion&quot;, &quot;flooding&quot;, &quot;collision&quot;, &quot;grounding&quot;, &quot;listing&quot;, &quot;sinking&quot;, &quot;disabled and adrift&quot;, &quot;piracy or attack&quot; and &quot;man overboard&quot;. To avoid false distress alerts, distress buttons normally have protective covers, often with a spring-loaded cover so two hands need to be used simultaneously. Alternatively, some devices have two-button systems. Operators are required to cancel falsely sent distress alerts with a transmission on the channel designated by the distress signal.

A coast station which receives a DSC distress alert will wait 2.75 minutes prior to sending an acknowledgment to allow other vessels in the nearby area to receive the alert. This helps shore stations narrow down where a vessel without GPS is located. The sending device will then both stop repeating the alert, and tune to the designated channel for the distress message to be sent. Ships receiving a distress alert who are outside coast station range or do not receive an acknowledgment, are required to relay the distress alert by any means to land.

==Other priorities==
The priorities for communication are, Distress, Urgency, Safety and Routine. A Distress DSC call is called an Alert. Urgency, Safety and Routine are called Announcements.

Class A VHFs, used on commercial ships, have the ability to send distress, distress relay, all ships urgency, all ships safety, individual, group, geographic area and telephone alerts/announcements on DSC channel 70 (Digital channel reserved for DSC only.). Class D VHFs, used for most leisure vessels, can send distress, all ships urgency, all ships safety and individual alerts/announcements on VHF channels on DSC channel 70. On both class A and D you can be directed to Ch 06, 08, 72, 77 or other simplex channel for the follow-up RT (radio telephony [voice]) call. Class D has only one antenna and thus can only watch Channel 70 when not transmitting. For routine alerts, which are used to establish communication with another station on a working channel, the receiver acknowledges to confirm that communication can be done on the appropriate channel.

While there are reserved frequencies for distress HF DSC calls, there is no prohibition against broadcasting non-distress, &quot;routine&quot; calls on other DSC-designated frequencies, which are defined in ITU M.541 as:
* 2177, 2189.5 kHz
* 4208, 4208.5, 4209 kHz
* 6312.5, 6313, 6313.5 kHz
* 8415, 8415.5, 8416 kHz
* 12577.5, 12578, 12578.5 kHz
* 16805, 16805.5, 16806 kHz
* 18898.5, 18899, 18899.5 kHz
* 22374.5, 22375, 22375.5 kHz
* 25208.5, 25209, 25209.5 kHz

There is a general consensus for routine calls to use 2177.0, 4208.0, 6312.5, 8415.0, 12577.5, and 16805.0 kHz (the first frequency listed above in each band).

==Technical details==
The DSC is a synchronous system using characters composed from a ten-bit error detecting code. The bits are encoded using frequency-shift keying. For High Frequency and Medium Frequency two tones 170 Hz apart either side of the allocated frequency with 100 Baud symbol rate are used. For VHF the two tones used are 1300 and 2100 Hz with a symbol rate of 1200 Baud. Each character is transmitted twice with a time delay. The detailed specification is published in the International Telecommunication Union recommendation ITU-R M.493, revision 15 published in 2019 being the most recent.

<text>Sir Henry Edward Bolte ( ; 20 May 1908 – 4 January 1990) was an Australian politician who served as the 38th premier of Victoria from 1955 to 1972. He held office as the leader of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party of Australia (LPA) and was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the division of Hampden from 1947 to 1972. He is the longest-serving premier in Victorian state history, having been in office for over 17 consecutive years.

== Early years ==
Bolte was born on 20 May 1908 in Ballarat East, Victoria. He was the son of Anna Jane (née Martin) and James Henry Bolte. His father, a miner, was the son of German immigrants and his mother was also half-German.

Shortly after his birth, Bolte&#x27;s parents moved the family to Skipton in the Western District where they ran a local pub, the Ripon Hotel. His mother&#x27;s stepfather William Warren was also a hotel proprietor, running the Skipton Hotel until 1921 when he sold it to the Boltes. During World War I the family faced anti-German sentiment.

Bolte began his education at Skipton State School. He entered Ballarat Grammar School as a boarder in 1922 on a technical scholarship, attending alongside his future parliamentary colleagues Tom Hollway and Edward Montgomery. He left school in 1924 and returned to Skipton, where he had land dealings and ran a haberdashery shop established by his father. He was also active in community organisations, playing cricket and football for local teams, qualifying as a swimming instructor and serving as secretary of the local racing club. His store failed in 1929 and during the Great Depression he worked as a shearer to support himself.

In 1934, with money from his grandmother, Bolte purchased &quot;Kialla&quot;, a sheep farming property of at Bamganie near Meredith. In his early years on the land he faced rabbit plague and supplemented his income by trapping and hunting rabbits. In August 1940, Bolte enlisted in the Militia as a gunner. He was stationed at Puckapunyal for periods as an artillery instructor and pay clerk, but was rejected for overseas service and discharged in January 1943.

== Parliamentary career ==
Bolte was founding president of the Liberal Party&#x27;s Meredith branch in 1945 and was a delegate to its inaugural state council. He first stood for parliament at the 1945 state election, running unsuccessfully in the seat of Hampden, but reprised his candidacy in 1947 and defeated the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) member Raymond Hyatt.

Victorian politics was volatile at this time, with a succession of weak short-term governments. The electoral system was malapportioned in favour of rural areas, which gave the Liberals&#x27; junior partner, the Country Party disproportionate power. As a rural Liberal, Bolte despised the Country Party nearly as much as the Labor Party. In April 1935, Country Party leader and Deputy Premier Albert Dunstan unexpectedly withdrew support for the Premier, Stanley Argyle, breaking the coalition agreement and forming a minority Country government, which Labor supported in return for some policy concessions.

When Bolte was elected to Parliament in 1947 the Liberal leader was Thomas Hollway, who also came from Ballarat but was somewhat less conservative than Bolte. In 1951 Hollway tried to reform the electoral system, which caused a split in the Liberal Party and his replacement by Les Norman, with Bolte as Deputy Leader. Norman would lose his seat to Hollway in 1952, and be replaced as leader by Trevor Oldham. When Oldham was killed on BOAC Flight 783 in May 1953, Bolte succeeded him.

The Labor Party under John Cain Sr. had come to power at the 1952 elections, but in 1955 the party suffered a split over the issue of communist influence in the trade unions. With Cain&#x27;s government reeling, Bolte tabled a no-confidence motion on 19 April. The anti-communist Catholic MPs, who had organised as the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist), crossed the floor to support the no-confidence motion, bringing Cain down.

Due in large part to Labor (A-C) directing its second preferences to the Liberals, Bolte won the ensuing election with a huge majority, routing both Labor and the Country Party. There was little hint at the time that he would reverse the pattern of unstable government in Victoria; he headed the state&#x27;s 11th government in 12 years. However, he was able to form the first stable non-Labor government in Victoria for many years.

Bolte was a rough-hewn politician who liked to be seen as a simple farmer, but he had a shrewd political mind. With the help of the expelled faction of the Labor Party, which became the Democratic Labor Party, Bolte was able to consolidate his position. Due in part to the DLP continuing to direct its preferences to the Liberals at elections, Bolte was reelected six times. His populist attacks on the trade unions, intellectuals, protesters and the press won him a large following. It peaked at the 1967 election, which saw the opposition reduced to just 28 seats (16 Labor and 12 Country) in total.

==Infrastructure building==
Bolte used state debt to provide a wide range of state infrastructure and he was very successful at winning overseas investment for the state. Some of the large projects undertaken during his time in government were increased coal production and power generation in the Latrobe Valley, new offshore oil and gas fields in Gippsland, the West Gate Bridge over the lower Yarra River, a new international airport for Melbourne at Tullamarine and two new universities (Monash University and La Trobe University). The majority of these projects were facilitated, rather than funded, by the State government. Bolte was easily re-elected at the 1958, 1961 and 1964 state elections.

== Capital punishment controversy ==
Bolte was a proponent of using capital punishment as a deterrent against violent crime. Many believed he was foiled when Robert Peter Tait who had murdered Ada Hall, an elderly widow, at the Hawthorn vicarage where she lived with her son, and who subsequently had been sentenced to hang for the crime, was granted an eleventh-hour reprieve in 1962 after the High Court had found him insane.

Justice Starke subscribed to the substitute Tait theory, Starke had defended Tait but later on was the sentencing judge in the R v Ryan &amp; Walker 1966. Starke said &quot;After Bolte was denied with Tait he simply waited for the next cab off the ranks, and poor Ryan happened to be the next cab!&quot;

In 1965, two prisoners, Ronald Ryan and Peter Walker, had escaped from Melbourne&#x27;s Pentridge Prison, allegedly killing a prison guard in the process. They were recaptured, and Ryan was sentenced to death for murder.
Bolte had the power to recommend clemency, but declined to exercise it, arguing that the death penalty was a necessary deterrent for crime against government officials and law enforcement officers.

All calls for clemency, petitions and protests were to no avail. Bolte was determined that the law be upheld. Ryan was hanged in February 1967. Bolte had said &quot;If I thought the law was wrong I would change it&quot;.

A reporter at his daily press conference on the day of the hanging asked what he was doing at the time it took place. Bolte, replied: &quot;One of the three Ss, I suppose.&quot; The reporter asked him what he meant. Bolte responded: &quot;A shit, a shave or a shower.&quot; Peter Blazey later wrote &#x27;For a man practically devoid of political or social idealism, the hanging had proved a way of tightening his control over cabinet, the party and the press.&#x27; Blazey also adds, however, that the Ryan hanging meant Bolte &#x27;had become brutalized politically, even if he didn&#x27;t know it...&#x27;
Bolte&#x27;s insistence on having Ryan hanged earned him the opposition of the Melbourne press, particularly &quot;The Age&quot;, the churches, the universities and most of the legal profession. It also alienated sections of the Liberal Party and some members of his own Cabinet, including his eventual successor, Dick Hamer. But Bolte had correctly interpreted the populist appeal of his putative law-and-order stand, and at the 1967 elections the Liberals went from 38 of 66 seats in 1964 to 44 of 73 in 1967.

== Later career ==

After 1968, when Bolte turned 60, his appeal to younger urban voters declined, and he showed little sympathy with new issues such as the environment and civil liberties. His standing was also reduced by a crisis in the state education system, with teacher shortages and overcrowded schools as the children of the baby boom passed through the education system. The government recruited large numbers of American schoolteachers to deal with the shortage. At the same time the Labor Party began to revive under a new leader, Clyde Holding.

At the 1970 state elections the Liberals seemed in serious danger of losing office, or at least being forced into a coalition with the Country Party, but Bolte was saved by Holding&#x27;s left-wing enemies in the Labor Party, who sabotaged his campaign by publicly opposing government funding for non-government schools (which Holding and Gough Whitlam had made Labor policy). Nevertheless, the Liberals lost six seats.

Bolte was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the 1972 New Year Honours.
Bolte on various occasions asked the prime minister, William McMahon, to approach the British authorities to have Bolte made a life peer of the UK Parliament. McMahon needed Bolte&#x27;s political support, so he wrote to 10 Downing Street with a proposal, but it was declined.

As 1972 dawned, the Liberals lost further ground among younger voters in Melbourne. Bolte was shrewd enough to see that the Liberals had a year at most to broaden their appeal before a statutory general election, and concluded that they needed a new leader and a new image for the 1970s. In August 1972, he resigned, apparently with no regrets. He arranged for Deputy Premier Dick Hamer, a somewhat more progressive Melbourne-based Liberal, to succeed him. Despite misgivings from the more conservative wing of the party, Hamer became Liberal leader and premier. This proved a sound judgement, since Hamer went on to win three more elections for the Liberals.

== Retirement and death ==

After his resignation and retirement from Parliament, Bolte retired to his farm, &#x27;Kialla&#x27;, at Bamganie, near Meredith. When the Liberals lost government in Victoria to John Cain, Jr. Liberals in the Opposition would visit Bolte at his farm, &quot;whisky bottle in hand, seeking consolation and advice.&quot; Bolte was deeply affected by the sudden death of his wife, Dame Edith, in 1986.

On 24 March 1984, Bolte was involved in a serious head-on accident when he was driving home after an evening in the local hotel near his property at Bamganie. Bolte and the occupants of the other car were taken to the Ballarat Base Hospital, where blood samples were taken to test for alcohol levels. Whilst there was no evidence of alcohol in the blood of the other driver involved, there were indications of an alcohol content in excess of 0.05%, the legal limit in Victoria, in Bolte&#x27;s blood. Further samples were subsequently collected from the hospital by the police, but these were found to have been substituted, and the sample box containing them had been unlocked by an unknown person. An enquiry found that it would have been unfair to proceed with prosecution because of interference with the evidence. Bolte later told author Tom Prior &quot;Of course I know nothing, I was unconscious&quot;.

Bolte died at his home on 4 January 1990.

== Honours and memorials ==
Bolte was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (KCMG) in the New Year&#x27;s Day honours list of 1966. In the 1972 New Year Honours he was advanced to the rank of Knight Grand Cross (GCMG). Despite &quot;his intense lobbying&quot;, Bolte failed to secure a peerage.

His wife, Lady Edith Lilian Bolte, known as Jill Bolte, was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1973 New Year Honours for &quot;outstanding public service to Victoria&quot;.

A portrait of Bolte by William Dargie hangs in Queens Hall at Parliament House Victoria.

<text>Kendell Airlines was a regional airline of Australia, in the 1990s the largest in the country. It served major regional centres in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania from Melbourne, Adelaide, and Sydney. Many of its services were in co-operation with its parent company Ansett Australia from the 1990s.

==History==
The airline was founded in 1967 as Premiair Aviation by aviation enthusiast Don Kendell and partners, originally serving as an air charter provider and flying school, based in Wagga Wagga. In 1971, the name of the company was changed to Kendell Airlines, which coincided with the launch of scheduled services using Piper PA-31 Navajo aircraft between Wagga Wagga and Melbourne, a route which had previously been operated by Ansett Airlines (later called Ansett Australia). Shortly afterwards, the route network was expanded with flights to Sydney and Canberra.

Flight operations saw a further increase when de Havilland DH.114 Heron and Swearingen Metro II aircraft were added to the fleet, the former in 1974 &amp; the latter in May 1979 following the Second Oil Crisis. The De Havilland DH.114 Heron aircraft were introduced on additional new routes including to Merimbula and Cooma in New South Wales. On 25 February 1985 the airline introduced the 34-seat Saab 340, a more modern regional airliner; Kendell was the first airline in the southern hemisphere to operate the Saab 340, with further aircraft of that type being added over the following years. The route network was nearly doubled in early 1986 when the South Australian routes of Airlines of South Australia (which was owned by Ansett) were taken over as a consequence of the deregulation of the Australian airline market. During the 1990s, Kendell established further operating bases to add to its original one at Wagga Wagga Airport, namely at Devonport Airport, Albury Airport and Sydney Airport, which was due to the airline becoming a subsidiary of Ansett.

From March 1996, Kendell Airlines offered the &quot;Capital Shuttle&quot; – a high-frequency (up to 13 daily return flights) service between Sydney and Canberra – on behalf of Ansett, which was followed by scheduled flights to Coffs Harbour and Ballina, which also had previously been operated by Ansett. The Saab 340s that were acquired by Kendell Airlines during that period were painted in Ansett colors. In 1999, Kendell became a regional affiliate of the Star Alliance, of which Ansett Australia had become a member.

Between 1999 and 2001, Kendell Airlines took delivery of 18 Bombardier CRJ200 regional jets, the first jet aircraft to be operated by the airline. On 14 September 2001, shortly after the last CRJ had joined the fleet, Ansett Australia collapsed, also grounding the fleet of Kendell Airlines. Kendell Airlines was placed into administration, but continued to operate a limited schedule, and also filled a temporary void left by Ansett Australia by flying on the Sydney–Canberra–Melbourne and Melbourne–Mount Gambier–Adelaide routes. In 2002, Kendell, and fellow Ansett subsidiary, Hazelton Airlines, were sold to a consortium known as Australiawide Airlines, from which Regional Express Airlines (known as Rex) was formed. Most of the turboprop aircraft operated by Kendell Airlines at that time were taken over by Rex.

==Awards==
*1990: &quot;Best National Airline&quot;, by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, surpassing Qantas.
*1992: &quot;Regional Airlines of the Year&quot;, by Air Transport World magazine.

==Fleet==
Over the years, Kendell Airlines operated the following aircraft types:

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 1 July 1992, a Kendell Airlines, SAAB 340A, VH-EKT, on a scheduled passenger service from Moorabbin, Victoria to Devonport, Tasmania, with 17 passengers and 3 crew lost directional control on landing. The aircraft departed the runway and ran through a ditch in soft muddy ground. Substantial damage was sustained to the aircraft but there were no injuries to passengers or crew. The cause, a severe asymmetric thrust condition developed after landing when reverse thrust was selected but the right propeller remained at a positive blade angle. This was due to the right propeller control unit being defective from an internal oil leakage across the feathering solenoid valve. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service. It still flies today.
*On 11 November 1998, a Kendell Airlines SAAB 340A, VH-LPI went into a stall with the two pilots losing control for around 10 seconds, due to icing of the aircraft that was experienced near Lake Eildon on a scheduled flight from Albury to Melbourne. The solitary flight attendant received a minor injury when the aircraft descended 2,300 feet (approximately 700 metres) during the loss of control and subsequent recovery. None of the 28 passengers were injured and the flight continued to Melbourne Airport.

<text>Dutch cheese farmers traditionally take their cheeses to the town&#x27;s market square to sell them. Teams (&quot;vemen&quot;) of official guild cheese-porters (&quot;kaasdragers&quot;), identified by differently coloured straw hats associated with their &quot;forwarding company&quot;, carried the farmers&#x27; cheese on barrows that weighed about 160 kilograms. Buyers sampled the cheeses and negotiated prices using a ritual system, called &quot;handjeklap&quot;, whereby buyers and sellers clapped each other&#x27;s hands and shouted out prices. Once a price was agreed, porters carried the cheese to the weigh house (&quot;Waag&quot;) and weighed the cheese on a company scale.

There are currently five cheese markets operating in the NetherlandsWoerden, Alkmaar, Gouda, Edam, and Hoorn. Each of these was once a merchant cheese market in operation during the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century. Today, the markets still function as farmers&#x27; markets for cheeses in addition to hosting dramatic re-enactments of sales techniques from the Golden Age. In the summer months, shows are surrounded by stalls selling traditional items steeped in Dutch culture.

==Woerden==
This commercial cheese market features farmers&#x27; cheeses with little of the spectacle or pageantry displayed by the other markets. For more than 100 years, every Wednesday morning, starting at around 9:00 am, there is a trading session between the cheese farmers and the &quot;marktmeester&quot; (market foreman), during which prices are set for the various types of cheeses. The cheeses for sale are &quot;boerenkazen&quot; (farmers&#x27; cheeses); this type of cheese is considered by cheese aficionados to be more authentic and to taste better than factory-made cheese.

===Annual Historic Cheese Market Woerden===
Every August, on the last Wednesday of the (central-Netherlands) school summer break, a historic cheese market is held. On this day the cheese farmers and their families re-enact the traditional cheese markets by dressing up in the attire worn by farmers in the distant past.

==Alkmaar==
This large 400-year-old cheese market located on the Waagplein (&quot;weighing square&quot;) is open every Friday between 10:00 am and 1:00 pm, starting on the first Friday in April and ending on the last Friday of September. In 2017, evening cheese markets took place on 2 May, 23 May, 6 June, 4 July, 18 July, 1 August, August 15, and 29 August, from 7:00 to 9:00 pm. From opening ceremonies to final load, market activities are explained in Dutch, German, English, and Spanish or French, and sometimes Japanese.

=== The Alkmaar Cheese Guild ===
The Alkmaar Cheese Guild (&quot;Kaasdragersgilde&quot;) was established on June 17, 1593, and is composed of 30 men who accompany their leader, the Cheese Father. The guild meets in the weighing square, and its members are divided into four groups called Forwarding Companies. The Forwarding Companies are distinguished by the colour of their straw hats: red, blue, green, or yellow. Each Forwarding Company has six carriers, who fulfill any number of tasks within the market, and one &quot;Tasman&quot;, who is responsible for placing the weights onto the cheese scales. The roles that carriers can fulfill are: &quot;Zetter&quot; (the first guildsman to show up at the market and is responsible for taking the cheese from storage to the market in the morning; he must wear black pants with a blue shirt), &quot;Ingooier&quot; (takes the cheese from the market to storage at the end of the day; he must wear black pants with a light fawn shirt), Temporary worker (not considered to be a member of the guild and must train for at least two years before being allowed to join), &quot;Bootelier&quot; (responsible for getting drinks for his company after the market is over), and the &quot;Voorman&quot; (head of the Forwarding Company, and often the oldest member of the company. Every two years each Forwarding Company elects a &quot;Voorman&quot;, who then wears a silver sign with a ribbon and a bow tie in his company&#x27;s color). Finally, the Cheese Father is the head of the entire guild; he wears a white suit with an orange hat to match his orange cane, and all members of the Forwarding Companies refer to him as &quot;Dad&quot;.

=== Traditions ===
The men of the cheese guilds adhere to strict behavior and dress codes. Those who fail to adhere to the guild face repercussions. The provost marshal collects fees from men who show up late or men whose uniforms are not &quot;white as snow&quot;, and the money collected from these fines is used to sponsor a local school. The carriers are expected to be at the weighing house at 7:00 am the morning of the market to set it up and have it ready to open by 10:00 am. Every Friday, right before the market opens, the Cheese Father gives a speech to the Forwarding Companies. In his speech, he takes a roll call to ensure that all the companies are there, informs them if any important guests will be attending, and tells them the amount of cheese, in metric tons, at the market that day. At exactly 10:00 am, the town bell is rung to signify the opening of the cheese market. Special guests are invited each week to ring the bell; it is considered a great honor. The market has opened in this manner every Friday since 1593. The only time that the cheese market did not take place was during World War II when it was temporarily put on hold for safety concerns. However, directly following the war, the market opened again. Cheese was very scarce during the war, so people were thrilled to see the markets return.

Once the market opens, samplers, in white lab coats, use a special scoop to inspect the insides of the cheese wheels. The sampler inspects the feel, smell, and taste of the cheese. He also does a visual analysis of the cheese to make sure it has holes, also known as &quot;eyes&quot;, that are evenly spread throughout the wheel. Once a batch is sold, it is carried to the scales to be weighed. The cheese is transported on a wooden barrow that is carried between two men. The barrows can have up to 130 kilos (287 pounds) of cheese on them at a time. In order to carry the barrows keeping them as steady as possible for the safety of the cheese, the carriers walk in a synchronized rhythm known as the &quot;cheese carriers’ dripple&quot;. Once the cheese reaches the scales, the Tasman weighs it in front of the Weighing Master or &quot;Waagmeester&quot;, thus ensuring that the buyer receives the correct amount of cheese that they bought. The Weighing Master is a public servant who is not a member of the cheese guild. The guildsmen follow the motto &quot;Een valse Waghe is de Heere een gruwel&quot;, which translates from Dutch as &quot;a false balance is an abhorrence in the eyes of the Lord&quot;. The market ends promptly at 1:00 pm and all the unsold cheese is carried back to the hauler&#x27;s lorry for storage.

==Edam==
At the Edam cheese market, which unsurprisingly features Edam cheese, horse-drawn carriages and boats bring farmers&#x27; cheeses to the Jan van Nieuwenhuizen Square to be presented at the current weigh house, built in 1778. This traditional-style cheese market opens in July and in August on Wednesday mornings from 10:30 am until 12:30 pm.

==Gouda==
Gouda cheese has been traded on the &quot;Goudse kaasmarkt&quot; for over three centuries. Nowadays, it is open from mid-June until August, every Thursday morning between 10:00 am and 12:30 pm. Farmers from the region gather to have their cheese weighed, tasted and priced. The Gouda cheese market is surrounded by many exhibitions of authentic Dutch professions, from cheese production to clog making and buttermilk preparation.

==Hoorn==
Opened in 2007 on the Roode Steen square, this cheese market takes place between June 28 and September 20 on Thursdays between 12:30 pm and 1:45 pm, and again between 9:00 pm and 10:15 pm. There are live commentaries regarding the process of carrying in the cheese, weighing the cheese, and negotiating in both Dutch and English.

<doc id="508230" wikidata="Q2962019" url="?curid=508230" title="Leader of the Opposition (Ireland)">
<text>The Leader of the Opposition () in Ireland is a term sometimes used to describe the politician who leads the largest party in the parliamentary opposition in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament). In the Dáil, the leader of the opposition sits on the right-hand side of the Ceann Comhairle and directly opposite the Taoiseach. The role is not an official one and is not recognised in the Irish constitution, nor in legislation.

The Leader of the Opposition is, by convention, the leader of the largest political party in the Dáil that is not in government. Opposition leaders leading a political party with five members or more have full speaking rights under Dáil standing orders; smaller parties and independent politicians are allowed to speak less often.

Historically the two largest parties have nearly always been Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and so the position of Leader of the Opposition has alternated between them. However, immediately following Irish independence from the UK in 1922, the leader of the Labour Party acted as Leader of the Opposition as Sinn Féin, and later Fianna Fáil, refused to take their seats in Dáil Éireann. After the 2011 general election Fine Gael became the largest party in Dáil Éireann and the Labour Party for the first time became the second largest. However, since Labour and Fine Gael entered a coalition government, the third largest party, Fianna Fáil, led the opposition in the 31st Dáil.

To date there have been 18 Opposition Leaders, 10 of whom have served terms as Taoiseach. The Leader of the Opposition is Mary Lou McDonald of Sinn Féin, following the formation of a government of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party on 27 June 2020. She is the first female Irish Opposition Leader and the second to come from a party other than Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, following Labour Party&#x27;s Thomas Johnson in 1927.

<text>In anatomy and osteology, a foramen (; : foramina, or foramens ; ) is an opening or enclosed gap within the dense connective tissue (bones and deep fasciae) of extant and extinct amniote animals, typically to allow passage of nerves, arteries, veins or other soft tissue structures (e.g. muscle tendon) from one body compartment to another.

==Skull==

The skulls of vertebrates have foramina through which nerves, arteries, veins, and other structures pass. The human skull has many foramina, collectively referred to as the cranial foramina. 

==Spine==
Within the vertebral column (spine) of vertebrates, including the human spine, each bone has an opening at both its top and bottom to allow nerves, arteries, veins, etc. to pass through. 

==Other==
* Apical foramen, the hole at the tip of the root of a tooth
* Foramen ovale (heart), a hole between the venous and arterial sides of the fetal heart
* Transverse foramen, one of a pair of openings in each cervical vertebra, in which the vertebral artery travels
* Greater sciatic foramen, a major foramen of the pelvis
* Interventricular foramina, channels connecting ventricles in the brain

<doc id="508239" wikidata="Q1317719" url="?curid=508239" title="Trichromacy">
<text>Trichromacy or trichromatism is the possession of three independent channels for conveying color information, derived from the three different types of cone cells in the eye. Organisms with trichromacy are called trichromats.

The normal explanation of trichromacy is that the organism&#x27;s retina contains three types of color receptors (called cone cells in vertebrates) with different absorption spectra. In actuality, the number of such receptor types may be greater than three, since different types may be active at different light intensities. In vertebrates with three types of cone cells, at low light intensities the rod cells may contribute to color vision.

==Humans and other animals that are trichromats==
Humans and some other mammals have evolved trichromacy based partly on pigments inherited from early vertebrates. In fish and birds, for example, four pigments are used for vision. These extra cone receptor visual pigments detect energy of other wavelengths, sometimes including ultraviolet. Eventually two of these pigments were lost (in placental mammals) and another was gained, resulting in trichromacy among some primates. Humans and closely related primates are usually trichromats, as are some of the females of most species of New World monkeys, and both male and female howler monkeys.

Recent research suggests that trichromacy may also be quite general among marsupials. A study conducted regarding trichromacy in Australian marsupials suggests the medium wavelength sensitivity (MWS), cones of the honey possum (&quot;Tarsipes rostratus&quot;) and the fat-tailed dunnart (&quot;Sminthopsis crassicaudata&quot;) are features coming from the inherited reptilian retinal arrangement. The possibility of trichromacy in marsupials potentially has another evolutionary basis than that of primates. Further biological and behavioural tests may verify if trichromacy is a common characteristic of marsupials.

Most other mammals are currently thought to be dichromats, with only two types of cone (though limited trichromacy is possible at low light levels where the rods and cones are both active). Most studies of carnivores, as of other mammals, reveal dichromacy; examples include the domestic dog, the ferret, and the spotted hyena. Some species of insects (such as honeybees) are also trichromats, being sensitive to ultraviolet, blue and green instead of blue, green and red.

Research indicates that trichromacy allows animals to distinguish brightly colored fruit and young leaves from other vegetation that is not beneficial to their survival. Another theory is that detecting skin flushing and thereby mood may have influenced the development of primate trichromate vision. The color red also has other effects on primate and human behavior as discussed in the color psychology article.

==Types of cones specifically found in primates==
Primates are the only known placental mammalian trichromats.

Their eyes include three different kinds of cones, each containing a different photopigment (opsin). Their peak sensitivities lie in the blue (short-wavelength S cones), green (medium-wavelength M cones) and yellow-green (long-wavelength L cones) regions of the color spectrum. S cones make up 5–10% of the cones and form a regular mosaic. Special bipolar and ganglion cells pass those signals from S cones and there is evidence that they have a separate signal pathway through the thalamus to the visual cortex as well. On the other hand, the L and M cones are hard to distinguish by their shapes or other anatomical means – their opsins differ in only 15 out of 363 amino acids, so no one has yet succeeded in producing specific antibodies to them. But Mollon and Bowmaker did find that L cones and M cones are randomly distributed and are in equal numbers.

==Mechanism of trichromatic color vision==


Trichromatic color vision is the ability of humans and some other animals to see different colors, mediated by interactions among three types of color-sensing cone cells. The &quot;trichromatic color theory&quot; began in the 18th century, when Thomas Young proposed that color vision was a result of three different photoreceptor cells. From the middle of the 19th century, in his &quot;Treatise on Physiological Optics&quot;, Hermann von Helmholtz later expanded on Young&#x27;s ideas using color-matching experiments which showed that people with normal vision needed three wavelengths to create the normal range of colors. Physiological evidence for trichromatic theory was later given by Gunnar Svaetichin (1956).

Each of the three types of cones in the retina of the eye contains a different type of photosensitive pigment, which is composed of a transmembrane protein called opsin and a light-sensitive molecule called 11-cis retinal. Each different pigment is especially sensitive to a certain wavelength of light (that is, the pigment is most likely to produce a cellular response when it is hit by a photon with the specific wavelength to which that pigment is most sensitive). The three types of cones are L, M, and S, which have pigments that respond best to light of long (especially 560 nm), medium (530 nm), and short (420 nm) wavelengths respectively.

Since the likelihood of response of a given cone varies not only with the &quot;wavelength&quot; of the light that hits it but also with its &quot;intensity&quot;, the brain would not be able to discriminate different colors if it had input from only one type of cone. Thus, interaction between at least two types of cone is necessary to produce the ability to perceive color. With at least two types of cones, the brain can compare the signals from each type and determine both the intensity and color of the light. For example, moderate stimulation of a medium-wavelength cone cell could mean that it is being stimulated by very bright red (long-wavelength) light, or by not very intense yellowish-green light. But very bright red light would produce a stronger response from L cones than from M cones, while not very intense yellowish light would produce a stronger response from M cones than from other cones. Thus trichromatic color vision is accomplished by using combinations of cell responses.

It is estimated that the average human can distinguish up to ten million different colors.

<doc id="508247" wikidata="Q1138377" url="?curid=508247" title="European Anti-Fraud Office">
<text>The European Anti-Fraud Office (commonly known as OLAF, from the ) is a body mandated by the European Union (EU) with protecting the Union&#x27;s financial interests. It was founded on 28 April 1999, under the European Commission Decision 1999/352. Its tasks are threefold: 
* to fight fraud affecting the EU budget; 
* investigate corruption by staff of EU institutions; and 
* develop anti-fraud legislation and policies. 
OLAF achieves its mission by conducting, in full independence, internal and external investigations. It coordinates the activities of its anti-fraud partners in the Member States in the fight against fraud. OLAF supplies EU member states with the necessary support and technical know-how to help them in their anti-fraud activities. It contributes to the design of the anti-fraud strategy of the European Union, and takes the necessary initiatives to strengthen the relevant legislation.

OLAF conducts administrative investigations. It has no judicial powers to oblige national law enforcement authorities to act on its follow-up recommendations.

== Legal basis ==
Regulation No 883/2013, governing the work of OLAF, entered into force on 1 October 2013. This Regulation builds on the experience gained by OLAF since its creation. It provides a clear statutory basis that codifies past practice and reinforces the effectiveness of OLAF&#x27;s investigative activities. The Regulation also sets the basis for a better exchange of information between OLAF and its partners.

== Structure ==
OLAF has a hybrid status. On the one hand, it is a Directorate General of the European Commission, under the responsibility of the Vice-President in charge of Budget and Human Resources. On the other hand, it is independent for its investigative activities.

OLAF has a staff of about 420: police, customs and legal experts from the member states of the European Union (EU).

Ville Itälä was appointed OLAF Director-General by the European Commission, following consultation with the European Parliament and Council. He took up his functions on 1 August 2018.

== History ==
OLAF was created in 1999. Following the events that led to the resignation of the Santer Commission, its predecessor UCLAF (&quot;Unité de coordination de lutte anti-fraude&quot;) was replaced with a new anti-fraud body (OLAF) with stronger powers. These also included conducting investigations within EU institutions.

== OLAF results in figures ==

Between 2010 and 2018, OLAF:

* Concluded over 1900 investigations
* Recommended the recovery of over €6.9 billion on the EU budget
* Issued over 2500 recommendation for judicial, financial, disciplinary and administrative action to be taken by the competent authorities of the Member States and the EU

As a results of OLAF&#x27;s investigative work, sums unduly spent were gradually returned to the EU budget, criminals faced prosecution before national courts and better anti-fraud safeguards were put in place throughout Europe.

== Success stories ==

OLAF&#x27;s concluded investigations include cases relating to EU staff, direct expenditure, external aid, customs and cigarette smuggling.

=== Embezzlement of research funding ===

A 2017 investigation led to OLAF putting an end to an intricate fraud scheme through which more than EUR 1.4 million worth of European Union funds, meant for emergency response hovercraft prototypes, had been misappropriated.

OLAF uncovered the fraud pattern as part of its investigation into alleged irregularities in a Research and Innovation project granted to a European consortium. The Italian-led consortium, with partners in France, Romania and the United Kingdom, was tasked with creating two hovercraft prototypes to be used as emergency nautical vehicles able to reach remote areas in case of environmental accidents. During on-the-spot checks performed in Italy by OLAF and the Italian Guardia di Finanza, OLAF discovered various disassembled components of one hovercraft, as well as another hovercraft which was completed after the deadline of the project. It became evident that, in order to obtain the EU funds, the Italian partners had falsely attested to the existence of the required structural and economic conditions to carry out the project.

Investigative activities carried out by OLAF in the UK revealed that the British partner only existed on paper and that the company was in fact created and owned by the same Italian partners. To simulate the actual development of the project and to divert funds, fictitious costs had also been recorded. In practice, once the EU funds were obtained, the Italian grantees used accounting artifices to syphon off money, forging documents attesting false expenses.

A thorough analysis of more than 12 000 financial transactions and payments made in the project showed that part of the EU funds received by the Italian and UK partners had been used to pay off a mortgage on a castle facing foreclosure. OLAF concluded its investigation in 2017 with two judicial recommendations – to the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of Genoa and to the City of London Police in the UK – and a financial recommendation to the Directorate- General for Research and Innovation of the European Commission to recover the defrauded funds. The Italian authorities are already following up on OLAF&#x27;s recommendations and investigating the persons concerned for embezzlement and fraud against the EU, false accounting, fraudulent bankruptcy and fraudulent statements.

=== Ending solar panel anti-dumping duty evasion ===

In 2017 OLAF also investigated another major case involving the evasion of anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed on solar panels originating in, or consigned from, the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It was alleged that solar panels were incorrectly declared on importation into the European Union as being of Taiwanese origin. In the framework of this investigation, OLAF, in cooperation with representatives of the Dutch and French customs agencies and the competent Taiwanese authorities, carried out joint enquiries in Taiwan. Further checks took place in Antwerp, in cooperation with Belgian customs.

OLAF collected and analysed transhipment data, EU import data, as well as other documents, while also conducting five company visits of Taiwanese exporters/consignors and visits to eleven shipping agents in Belgium and Taiwan. It was revealed that approximately 2500 container loads of Chinese solar panels had been transhipped via Taiwan to the EU. OLAF discovered that these consignments of solar panels imported into the European Union were not actually of Taiwanese origin, as declared. The solar panels were shipped from solar panel producers in the People&#x27;s Republic of China to the Free Zone in Taiwan, where the solar panels were loaded into other containers and shipped to the EU with new documents claiming Taiwanese origin. It was established that, in reality, the goods came from the People&#x27;s Republic of China and therefore anti-dumping and countervailing duties were applicable. As a result, OLAF issued a financial recommendation amounting to EUR 135 million.

===UK not acting on China import fraud===
In March 2022 the European court of justice (ECJ)—the highest court,from which there is no further appeal—made a final ruling that the UK government, when a member of the EU, had been negligent from 2011 to 2017 in allowing criminal gangs to import cheap Chinese-made clothes and shoes with false invoices understating their value, which were then re-exported into other EU countries. The court considered that EU-wide anti-fraud measures set out by OLAF should have been used. Although Britain had left the EU, the country remains subject to ECJ jurisdiction for breaches of EU law while a member state. The EU claimed compensation of over €2 billion.

== Fight against cigarette smuggling ==

OLAF is not only competent to investigate matters relating to fraud, corruption and other offences affecting all EU expenditure, but also relating to some areas of EU revenue, mainly customs duties. Tobacco smuggling causes huge losses to national and the EU budget, hence OLAF investigates and coordinates criminal cases relating to large-scale, international cigarette smuggling.

In addition to its investigative work, OLAF also supports the EU Institutions and Member States in shaping tobacco anti-smuggling policy. Following litigation before US courts, and to address the problem of contraband and counterfeit cigarettes, the EU Member States and the European Commission signed (between 2004 and 2010) legally binding and enforceable agreements with the world&#x27;s four largest tobacco manufacturers. The companies agreed to pay a collective total of $2.15 billion to the EU and Member States. With the agreements, the manufacturers have also committed themselves to comprehensive rules concerning sales and distribution practices to promote compliance with EU and national rules as well as to ensure that their genuine cigarettes are sold, distributed, stored and shipped in accordance with all legal requirements.

OLAF brings significant added value to operations like these, where contraband networks operate across borders and can only be countered by coordinated EU-wide efforts.

== Fight against wood laundering ==
OLAF handles illegal logging and smuggling of precious wood and timber into the EU (wood laundering)

== Challenges ==
While OLAF is a largely successful organisation, it is not without faults and challenges. Most notably is how reliant it is on the cooperation of European Member States. OLAF is not a sanctioning body, it does not have any powers to prosecute or discipline, only to make recommendations. It is up to the relevant judicial bodies and EU institutions to follow the recommendations and take action or not. Responses to OLAF&#x27;s recommendations vary between states, EU institutions and smaller judiciary bodies. For example, most Hungarian authorities have all refused to sign cooperation agreements with OLAF and rarely follow recommendations despite there being high levels of corruption within the country. It has been suggested that Hungary refuses to cooperate because the corruption is in the interests of the authorities, and OLAF lacks the influence needed to force cooperation. EUROPOL and EUROJUST are two organisations OLAF struggles to work with, because OLAF feels like they encroach on its jurisdiction and have no place in fraud investigations. There is no one legal code to protect the European Budget – each Member State has their own legal systems, with their own law enforcement and evidence collecting methods and this can reduce the efficiency of OLAF. Its efficiency is also hindered by reliance on state/agency cooperation, cultural, legal and language barriers and complications arising from cross-border investigations.

== Criticism ==

Legal Basis

The legal basis of OLAF has been a subject for criticism. While OLAF is not a law enforcement agency its recommendations hold substantial sway in the EU structures. This raises concerns regarding the transparency of OLAF&#x27;s actions and basic rights of the subjects under investigation. Helen Xanthaki, Professor of Law at UCL, has stated: &quot;OLAF is entangled in an ad hoc, fragmented, conflicting and uncodified mess of largely self-imposed operational conventions that are supposed to be applied within the tight constrictions of legitimacy and constitutionality in criminal investigations. Even the jurisdictional identity of legitimacy and constitutionality is fluid. Which law and which Constitution would the unavoidably confused OLAF staff work under: Belgian, EU, that of the jurisdiction with competence over the investigation, or that with competence over the actual, indeed usually cross-border, action under investigation? And really, what is the nature of OLAF and the task of its staff: are they investigators, prosecutors or something in between?”

Selectivity and partiality

OLAF has been criticized by Ingeborg Gräßle, a former member of the budgetary control committee of the European Parliament, who has indicated that less than a third of OLAF&#x27;s staff is dealing with the EU&#x27;s agricultural and structural funds, even though they represent more than 80 percent of the EU budget. Furthermore, Gräßle pointed out that OLAF&#x27;s resources are disproportionately allocated to counterfeiting investigations: &quot;They [OLAF] have the luxury industry with a clear interest to help them finding counterfeit goods, but in my view OLAF is not a European FBI. OLAF’s mandate is clearly to protect the financial interests of the EU. This means to protect the EU budget&quot;.

Dalligate

OLAF conducted the investigation that lead to the forced resignation of John Dalli, former European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy. Basing on OLAF&#x27;s report, Dalli was accused by José Manuel Barroso, the former President of the European Commission, of using an associate to ask for a bribe from a Swedish tobacco company.

However, none of the accusations against Dalli were found to be substantiated and when OLAF&#x27;s report leaked, the document was criticized as biased and amateurish. The initial complaint against Dalli was made by Swedish Match, a tobacco company. According to Dalli, the objective of the affair was to impede the EU Tobacco Products Directive, which imposed stricter regulations on tobacco marketing. Leaked documents from Philip Morris International later revealed that the tobacco company had employed 161 people and spent vast sums in an effort to delay the Tobacco Products Directive. At the time of the Dalli affair Philip Morris International had ties with both Swedish Match and OLAF, the former being a strategic partner in a venture to commercialize snus globally and the latter being part of an anti-contraband agreement between the European Commission and PMI which saw PMI provide information as well as funds to OLAF. Corporate Europe Observatory, a lobbying transparency NGO has questioned whether the Dalli affair had been a politically motivated tobacco industry trap.

Criminal investigation of Giovanni Kessler

Belgian authorities opened an investigation against the former Director-General of OLAF Giovanni Kessler who was suspected of illegally listening in to a telephone conversation whilst probing into the Dalli case. In 2016 Kessler was stripped of EU immunity. The investigation remains ongoing.

<doc id="508248" wikidata="Q3216467" url="?curid=508248" title="Lake Shore Drive">
<text>Lake Shore Drive (officially Jean Baptiste Pointe du Sable Lake Shore Drive; also known as DuSable Lake Shore Drive, the Outer Drive, the Drive, LSD or DLSD) is a semi-limited access expressway that runs alongside the shoreline of Lake Michigan and its adjacent parkland and beaches in Chicago, Illinois. Except for the portion north of Foster Avenue (5200 North), the Drive is designated part of U.S. Highway 41. A portion of the highway on the Outer Drive Bridge and its bridge approaches is multilevel.

On June 25, 2021, the Chicago City Council approved a compromise ordinance renaming the outer portion of Lake Shore Drive for the city&#x27;s first non-indigenous settler, Jean Baptiste Pointe du Sable.

The Lakefront Trail, an multi-use trail, parallels Lake Shore Drive on the east side for most of its length. Pedestrians can access the lake at numerous points all along Lake Shore Drive through underpasses and overpasses that connect the lake with the city&#x27;s lakefront neighborhoods. For much of its length north and south, it has a landscaped median separating directional traffic. It prominently runs street level through eastern Grant Park and then around the Museum Campus, past McCormick Place convention center, where it provides the terminal interchange of Interstate 55. In the North, it goes through most of Lincoln Park, and south through Burnham Park and Jackson Park.

==Route description==
The southern portion of Lake Shore Drive begins at the intersection of Ewing Avenue (US 41), Harbor Avenue, and Mackinaw Avenue. Lake Shore Drive runs through the former South Works steel plant as a four-lane divided highway, effectively bypassing the built-up area in South Chicago. Lake Shore Drive ends at the intersection of 79th Street and South Shore Drive; US 41 continues north through South Shore via South Shore Drive.

The main section of Lake Shore Drive begins at the intersection of Jeffery Drive and Marquette Drive. After 57th Street, Lake Shore Drive becomes an expressway. Exits to Hyde Park Boulevard and 53rd Street are only accessible for southbound traffic. The interchange design at 47th Street is unusual as traffic would exit or enter on the left side of northbound Lake Shore Drive instead of on the right side. South of McCormick Place, Lake Shore Drive meets I-55 at a Y-interchange, where I-55 begins/ends. There was once an inverted SPUI north of I-55; however, the overpass became pedestrianized and became part of McCormick Place in the mid-1990s, leading to the closure of this interchange. That same year, northbound traffic on Lake Shore Drive shifted west onto its current configuration west of Soldier Field and Museum Campus.

The controlled-access portion ceases between Waldron Drive and Monroe Drive and again at Chicago Avenue. Lake Shore Drive briefly becomes double-decked between Randolph Street and Grand Avenue. The upper deck facilitates expressway-like traffic, while the lower deck facilitates local traffic. After intersecting with Chicago Avenue, Lake Shore Drive travels in a sharp reverse curve at Oak Street Beach before returning to controlled-access once again. In Uptown, three diamond interchanges are spaced apart. US 41 leaves Lake Shore Drive at an interchange with Foster Avenue. The expressway continues north, serving Bryn Mawr Avenue, before ending at Hollywood Avenue/Sheridan Road in the Edgewater neighborhood.

===Outer Drive and Inner Drive===
Outer Drive, signed as DuSable Lake Shore Drive, is a limited-access road that runs north from Marquette Drive in Jackson Park to Hollywood Avenue in the Edgewater neighborhood. The outer drive limits the ability of pedestrians to access the lake directly from the street grid. Trucks are prohibited on Outer Drive except for a section between I-55 and 31st Street.

The original Inner Drive, signed as Lake Shore Drive, is used for slower local traffic and is connected to the street grid. The local drive runs from downtown in Streeterville to LaSalle Drive, (becoming Cannon Drive). Then the inner drive reappears just south of Diversey Parkway, continuing north to Irving Park Road. The portion from Belmont to just south of Irving Park was previously named Sheridan Road (which can still be seen carved in stone in at least one vintage high-rise).

===Link Bridge===
The Outer Drive Bridge, also known as the Link Bridge, is the official name of the bridge carrying the Lake Shore Drive portion of US 41 over the main branch of the Chicago River. It is designed as a bascule bridge, and is one of only two in the city to have an upper and lower deck, both dedicated to automobile traffic (the other being on Michigan Avenue). The Wells Street Bridge and Lake Street Bridge also have two levels, but the upper level is for elevated train traffic into the Loop.

The Link Bridge was constructed in 1937. At the time of its construction, it was considered to be both the widest and longest bascule bridge in the world.

==History==
&#x27;
===Early history===

Lake Shore Drive&#x27;s origins date back to Potter Palmer, who coerced the city to build the street adjacent to his lakefront property to enhance its value. Palmer built his &quot;castle&quot; at 1350 N. Lake Shore Drive in 1882. The drive was originally intended for leisurely strolls for the wealthy in their carriages, but as the auto age dawned it took on a different role completely.

In 1927, the roadway&#x27;s southern portion from the Chicago River to 57th Street was signed as Leif Ericson Drive after the Norse explorer. It was also known as Field Boulevard. 

The road was extended from Belmont Avenue (3200n) north to Foster Avenue (5200n) in 1933. Landfill was used for this extension, mostly made of dirt.

In 1937, the double-decker Link Bridge (officially the Outer Drive Bridge) over the Chicago River opened, along with viaducts over rail yards and other industrial areas connecting to both ends of it. The lower level was intended for a railroad connection. At the time the bridge was built, it was the longest and widest bascule bridge in the world. The Lake Shore Drive (Outer Drive) and Link Bridge Photograph Album, c1937, documents the bridge&#x27;s construction. The album is held by the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. North of the river, LSD intersected Ohio Street at grade, and then passed over Grand Avenue and Illinois Street on its way to the bridge South of the river. LSD came from the south on its current alignment, but continued straight at the curve north of Monroe Street, rising onto a viaduct. It intersected Randolph Street at grade and then continued north above the Illinois Central Railroad&#x27;s yard. At the river, it made a sharp turn to the right, and another sharp turn to the left onto the bridge.

Leif Ericson Drive was resigned as Lake Shore Drive in 1946.
In the 1950s, the road was extended — first briefly to Bryn Mawr (5600n) and then in 1957 to Hollywood Avenue (5700n). The road included rubble and debris from the destruction of homes razed for the construction of the Congress Expressway (now the Eisenhower Expressway).

Prior to the extension to Hollywood, traffic was funneled onto Foster, then north onto Sheridan Road, which still remains a wide 4-lane street to this day, though most traffic doesn&#x27;t rejoin Sheridan until LSD ends at Hollywood Avenue now. Sheridan Road south of Foster narrows to 2 lanes of traffic with street parking on each side as well.

===Later history===
At the junction with Michigan Avenue, an interchange was built from 1964 to Summer 1965 to replace the at-grade intersection.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Illinois and Cook County presented plans for an Interstate 494 to run along part of LSD. I-494 was initially planned to run from the Chicago Skyway at Stony Island Avenue to the Kennedy Expressway at the Ohio Street feeder ramp. The freeway would travel along Stony Island Avenue, Lake Shore Drive, and Ohio Street, bisecting Jackson Park in the process. Later, it was planned to connect south towards the currently-named Bishop Ford Freeway. The extension of a proposed freeway would have continued south along Stony Island Avenue, including the present-day feeder ramp, connecting to present-day Bishop Ford Freeway. An I-494 proposal was also considered around the same time for the Crosstown Expressway. In 1966, the I-494 designation was relocated to the Crosstown Expressway. At the same time, further extensions and upgrades on the freeway were canceled.

When Wacker Drive was extended east to LSD in the early 1970s, its upper level ended at LSD at the west curve (the lower level dead-ended underneath). A new development at the northeast corner of the Randolph Street intersection resulted in an extension of Randolph across LSD.

A reversible lane was added to part of the road in 1976.

Construction began in 1982 on a realignment of LSD south of the river (along with a reconstruction north of the river). A whole new alignment was built, greatly smoothing the S-curve. The northbound side opened in October 1985, and the southbound side opened in November 1986. A new lower level was built, using the lower level of the bridge, and providing access to the new Wacker Drive and the roads on the north side of the river. The old road south of Randolph later became the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Garden: the east–west part was reconstructed as part of Wacker Drive (which was being rebuilt at the time). The rest, between Randolph and Wacker, was kept for several years as Field Boulevard but was demolished in 1994. Only some old street lighting, sidewalks &amp; fire hydrants remain, marking the former route. Current plans are for new upper-level streets in the area as part of the Lakeshore East development.

On November 10, 1996, new northbound lanes opened next to the original southbound lanes at Soldier Field, eliminating the original wide median. Prior to this 1996 reconstruction, the northbound lane ran on the east side of Soldier Field while the southbound lane ran on the west side.

On March 20, 2003, some 15,000 anti-war protesters marched along Lake Shore Drive the day after the United States invasion of Iraq, stopping all traffic for several hours. The spontaneous direct action occurred after the original protest route through downtown Chicago, as planned by the Chicago Coalition Against War &amp; Racism, was blocked by law enforcement. Approximately 900 marchers were arrested and a City Council investigation was held before all charges were dropped.

Portions of the drive between Irving Park Road and Foster Avenue that contained the original concrete were paved with asphalt in 2009.

During the Groundhog Day Blizzard, Lake Shore Drive had to be closed because of the large amount of snow present on the roadway. The city estimated 900 vehicles became stuck on Lake Shore Drive, with the Associated Press reporting approximately 1,500 vehicles stuck. Hundreds of motorists had become stranded on Lake Shore Drive, some for as long as 12 hours. Crews worked around the clock to remove the vehicles and clear the roadway, and Lake Shore Drive was reopened just before dawn on February 3, 2011.

A thirty-year development plan estimated to cost $4 billion was approved by Chicago in September 2010, for the former site of the US Steel plant in South Chicago, which operated along the neighborhood&#x27;s shoreline from 1880 to 1992, and which has undergone extensive demolition and environmental remediation since; included in the plan was an extension of Lake Shore Drive through the property. This extension opened at 9 am October 27, 2013.

Between late 2015 and late 2017, the I-55 interchange was reconstructed to repace all of the ramps. These structures were deteriorating and functionally obsolete.
As early as 1993, a proposal to rename Lake Shore Drive in honor of du Sable was backed by former Aldermen Toni Preckwinkle (4th Ward) and Madeline Haithcock (2nd Ward). However, this plan was rejected by former Mayor Richard M. Daley, who cited its high cost. In October 2019, the 1993 proposal was reintroduced by 4th Ward Alderman David Moore and co-sponsored by ten others. Due to renewed national political attention to race relations following the May 2020 murder of George Floyd and subsequent civil unrest, which also impacted Chicago, the plan gained traction. In December 2020, a hearing on the proposal was held, but the vote was delayed to April 2021 due as Mayor Lori Lightfoot sought alternatives to honor du Sable. The plan was also amended to reduce the price tag, only renaming the Outer Drive from Hollywood Avenue to 67th Street. In late April 2021, this amended plan was reported favorably out of committee. A full Council vote was expected to take place in late May, but this was delayed further to late June due to Lightfoot&#x27;s opposition. In late June, the proposal was passed by the City Council, 33-15. Polls indicated racial polarization around the name change, with a majority of white residents critical of the plan and a majority of non-white residents in support. This divide was reflected in the Council vote: the ordinance received predominantly non-white aldermanic support, while two-thirds of the aldermen in opposition were white.

==Future==

In 2004, a private foundation solicited plans, and the Chicago Park District considered a feasibility study, to extend Lake Shore Drive farther north through Rogers Park and into Evanston. They proved extremely controversial. Residents protested against cutting neighborhoods off from the lake, and Rogers Park and Edgewater voters rejected the extension in a referendum placed on the ballot by citizen initiative in November 2004. However, in spring 2005, the Chicago Park District spent $350,000 on plans for new marinas along Lake Shore Drive, including one at Devon-Granville, and in July 2005, Cong. Jan Schakowsky (IL-9) obtained federal funding reported variously as $800,000 and $1 million for a study of the possible extension of the Chicago North lakefront path; both of these developments fueled residents&#x27; suspicion of a secret city plan to extend the Drive. The controversy remained an issue through the 2007 aldermanic election in the 49th Ward. In 2008, proposals by Friends of the Parks to extend the lakefront park system north, possibly through offshore manmade islands linked by bike paths, met with similar resident opposition. Despite statements by FOP that no extension of the Drive was contemplated, activists contended that the Park District &quot;has plans already drawn up that clearly show Lake Shore Drive immediately east of&quot; Edgewater and Rogers Park.

Throughout the 2010s and the 2020s, IDOT, CDOT, and the Chicago Park District worked on a project (dubbed &quot;Redefine the Drive&quot;) to reconstruct a portion of Lake Shore Drive north of downtown, citing traffic congestion, deteriorating infrastructure, and safety issues. The project also sought to expand the lakefront as well as adding amenities to the lakefront (including the Lakefront Trail) and straightening the S-curve near Oak Street Beach. Organizations like Active Transportation Alliance emphasized the need to make the lakefront more welcoming to pedestrians and cyclists, suggesting that Lake Shore Drive be downsized.
One proposal put forward in 2017 was to place the straightened Scurve underground. In the fall of 2020, planners narrowed the lane configuration options down to 5: keep the existing lanes except for the addition of queue jump lane, add a bus lane (the &quot;Addition&quot;), turn the left lane into a bus lane (the &quot;Exchange&quot;), turn the left lane into toll lane (the &quot;Flex&quot;), and turn two left lanes into toll lanes (the &quot;Double Flex&quot;).

===Parks===
Much of Chicago&#x27;s shoreline is given over to public parks. The Drive, running through or alongside these parks, gives travelers views and access to these parks and their many amenities. In addition, the Chicago Lakefront Trail (abbreviated as LFT) is an 18-mile multi-use path that often runs in the parks near the Drive. It is popular with cyclists and joggers. From north to south, the parks are Lincoln Park, Grant Park, Burnham Park and Jackson Park.

==Use in culture==

===As political moniker===
In the 20th century, the tiny neighborhoods near Lake Shore Drive came to be occupied by exclusive high-rise apartments, condominiums and co-op buildings. To the political columnist Mike Royko, Lake Shore Drive was goo-goo territory, a land occupied by Chicago&#x27;s wealthy &quot;good-government&quot; types. Royko sometimes used Lake Shore Drive as a political moniker. Though he often agreed with the reformers, he looked upon them with the same cynical eye as his fictional Chicago everyman, Slats Grobnik.

=== In motorsport ===
A part of the Chicago Street Course uses Lakeshore Drive as a part of the track.

===In popular culture===
Many films based in Chicago feature scenes on Lake Shore Drive, including &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, &quot;The Break-Up&quot;, &quot;Risky Business&quot;, &quot;Love Jones&quot;, &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;. In &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;, the title characters are seen taking Lake Shore Drive in the opposite compass direction to that which their origin point and destination would require.

In television, Lake Shore Drive is seen in AT&amp;T&#x27;s/&quot;The New Cingular&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Weight&quot; ad with the ad&#x27;s protagonist driving south along Lake Shore Drive towards the John Hancock Building. The opening credits of the late 1980s and early 1990s sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot; features a flyover of Lake Shore Drive. Also, the medical drama &quot;ER&quot; has shot scenes at or near Lake Shore Drive over the show&#x27;s 15 season run.

The 1971 song &quot;Lake Shore Drive&quot; by Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah is a reference to the road. Styx mentions the road in their 1979 song &quot;Borrowed Time&quot; as well as &quot;Back to Chicago&quot; from 1990. The road is also mentioned in the 2005 Kanye West songs &quot;Drive Slow&quot; and &quot;Grammy Family&quot;, as well as in his verse in the Boost Mobile promotional single &quot;Whole City Behind Us.&quot; The song &quot;Lake Shore Drive&quot; by Art Porter Jr. is also about the famous road. It is also mentioned in Fall Out Boy&#x27;s song, &quot;Lake Effect Kid&quot;: &quot;joke us, joke us &#x27;till Lake Shore Drive comes back into focus.&quot;

Lake Shore Drive is also featured in the 1999 Microsoft game &quot;Midtown Madness&quot;.

In the Electronic Arts NASCAR video game series, &quot;2005: Chase for the Cup&quot;, &quot;06: Total Team Control&quot;, &quot;07&quot;, &quot;08&quot;, and &quot;09&quot; all include a fictional street course that uses part of the real-life Lake Shore Drive, along with a few side streets. In Chase for the Cup, it is referred to as Lakeshore Drive, and must be unlocked by using a cheat code. In the latter four games, it goes by Wal-Mart Raceway, and is available from the start.

<text>Food distribution is the process where a general population is supplied with food. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) considers food distribution as a subset of the food system. The process and methodology behind food distribution varies by location. Food distribution has been a defining characteristic of human behavior in all societies, and recordings of food distribution date back for thousands of years. Most governments and societies are highly shaped by the systems created to support food distribution. 

There are a multitude of risk factors that can affect food distribution. War, economic failure, political problems, and weather conditions all play a role in determining the efficiency of any food system. Two recent examples of war and economic failure impacting food distribution includes the decline of food distribution in Japan during World War II and food recession in Sub-Saharan Africa during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In both cases, food distribution was hindered and the population in these areas consequently suffered.

Special organizations exist today to prevent any total collapses in food distribution, assist in developing food distribution and food systems in underdeveloped areas, and respond to food distribution crises. At the international level, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) plays a key role in facilitating the growth of food distribution systems all over the world. At the national level different countries have developed more complex support systems; by example, a mixture of federal, non-profit, and volunteer organizations function in the United States to safeguard the well-being of the US food distribution system. Within the United States, there is an issue of food insecurity where food distribution is one of the key solutions to target food insecurity. This creates a &quot;food bank industry&quot; where many organizations use tactics of business and trade skills within the food distribution sector to give food to communities that are in need.

== History ==
One clear and defined documentation of historical food distribution comes from the Roman Republic and Empire. Many Roman rulers and emperors sought to determine the best method of distributing food throughout the Mediterranean, and as the demands of the Roman people changed in time, so too did their leaders’ plans. In the few centuries after the death of Christ, the &quot;annona&quot; became a prominent aspect in Roman food distribution. As the Empire expanded and the accessibility to certain foods changed, the demand for grain and wine drastically increased, and became a defining aspect of Roman food culture.

Societies prominent after the fall of the Romans continued to deal with the ever-present dilemma of food distribution. The distribution systems of the United States and Latin America have developed in unique ways, and faced different problems in the past century. The United States&#x27; food distribution system is vast in size and strength, and is dominated by corporations and industry. Current methods of food distribution in the US rely on the country&#x27;s advanced network of infrastructure and transportation. In less developed parts of the world like Latin America, food distribution differs from the US.

=== Rome ===
The traditional Roman diet consisted of grain, fruits, olive oil, meat and wine. Of all these, grain was extremely important to the Roman people. During Rome&#x27;s height, it is estimated that the city itself needed 150,000 tons of grain and millions of liters of water and wine every year to survive. It was traditionally the responsibility of the Roman government to guarantee that there was enough food for distribution among the people. In times of shortages, bad harvests, or interference by pirates, the government made sure to fulfill its obligation to food distribution. Officials would sometimes buy food themselves and then sell it back to the people at little to no cost. When Rome eventually established its Empire, foreign lands would send taxes in grain to Rome, which helped decrease the chance of a food distribution crisis.

==== The &quot;Annona&quot;====
The first indication of a collective, organized food distribution system within the Roman Republic comes from the &quot;annona&quot;. Originally meaning &quot;yearly return&quot;, the &quot;annona&quot; became the administrative term for governmental bread and grain distribution. Over time, &quot;annona&quot; came to represent the distribution of all pertinent foods in the Roman diet. The &quot;annona&quot; was originally organized between 500 and 50 BCE, and gained increasing influence in the centuries to come. The practice of specifically distributing grain to the plebeian class, known as &quot;frumentationes&quot;, gained prominence around 120 BCE and supplemented the efforts of the &quot;annona&quot; to feed the Roman people. Emperor Augustus officially changed the &quot;annona&quot; system between 8 and 14 CE. He established the position of &quot;praefectus annonae&quot;, Prefect of the Annona. Up to this point in time, the &quot;annona&quot; was handled by local government officials called aediles. Augustus’ Prefect of the &quot;Annona&quot; oversaw all transportation, weighing, inspection, and storing of state foods.

The physical distribution of foods throughout the Roman Empire varied by location and type of food. Some foods were shipped by boat and then distributed once they reached port. Others, specifically meat, were transported by land and brought into urban areas. Special regulations were put in place for the distribution of olive oil, as the Empire made contracts with olive oil producers all over the Mediterranean. Free daily distributions of olive oil were enacted by Emperor Severus during his reign from 192 to 211 CE. His distribution policy lasted for at least a few centuries, but scholars are unsure if the policy continued thereafter. Wine was not as freely distributed as olive oil, but was sold for a very low price starting around 300 CE.

== Food distribution in the 20th and 21st centuries ==

=== US food distribution from 1900 to 1960 ===
The United States&#x27; food distribution system has experienced major changes in the past hundred years. Food distribution primarily relied on small, local farms in the 1940s, but quickly grew to become a large business in the 1960s. Three economic advances that allowed for the growth in food distribution between 1910 and 1960 were the establishment of chain stores, retail cooperatives, and supermarkets.

==== Chain stores ====
Chain stores did not become popular in the United States until the end of World War I. It was reported in 1929 that chain stores accounted for 39% of all grocery sales in the United States. Chain stores&#x27; success is related to their ability to undersell smaller distributors. An anti-chain movement arose in response to the success of the chain stores during the Great Depression, but caused little detriment to the success and profitability of the chains.

==== Retail cooperatives ====
Another response to the success of the chain stores was the development of retail cooperatives. These organizations were founded by groups of individual food distributors who saw the benefits of using chain-style pricing. Retail cooperatives accounted for 7% to 8% of the food market in 1930, and an increase in their popularity with independent food distributors rose retail cooperative&#x27;s market share to 13% by 1958.

==== Supermarkets ====
The third and final change to US food distribution in the first half of the 20th century involved the establishment of supermarkets. The Ford Motor Company performed the first experiment regarding the profitability of large-scale supermarkets after the end of World War I. Supermarkets officially began gaining prominence in the 1930s and steadily continued their growth into the post-WWII era.

=== Modern US food distribution ===

Modern food distribution in the United States is a result of continued growth since the 1960s. In an increasingly connected world, food distribution efforts in the US reach from coast to coast. A network of infrastructure, warehouses, factories, and commercial retailers comprise the bulk of US food distribution. It is estimated that food served in the United States may travel close to 1,500 miles between growers and consumers. While many products, specifically meat and grain, are distributed in different fashions, there are common trends to the distribution of most modern foods. An increase in the use of technology for farming has transformed the small local farm of the 1940s in to large production facilities. Several federal agencies, such as the US Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration, manage and sustain the productivity of the US food distribution system.

=== Food distribution in Latin America ===
Food distribution in Latin America is mainly dominated by large distributors and chains. Efforts have been made to compete with the industrialization of the food distribution system through the establishment of four types of organizations: consumer purchasing organizations, consumer cooperatives, voluntary chains, and retailer purchasing associations. Consumer purchasing organizations are groups of families who buy food together. The benefits of joining one of these organizations are the reduced cost and improved variety in diet that comes from purchasing food with other families. Consumer cooperatives differ from consumer purchasing organizations in that they are constituted by groups of individuals who work together to secure high quality food for low prices. The cooperatives are analogous to a food union that actively works to secure the rights of its consumers. Voluntary chains are organizations of privately owned retailers and food wholesalers who operate as one economic body. These groups form contracts to work under, but are economically independent of one another. Retailer purchasing organizations are groups of retailers who purchase products as though they were a single buyer. Members within these organizations are all involved in the purchasing of goods, but do not form contracts.

=== Global food distribution ===
Along with Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, and Cargill, the Louis Dreyfus Company is one of the four &quot;ABCD&quot; companies that dominate world agricultural commodity trading.

== Risk factors affecting food distribution and examples of failed policy ==
Prominent risk factors that can affect the food distribution within a society include war, economic failure, political instability, and weather conditions. Each of these factors affects individual groups of people differently, but all share the common attribute of being detrimental to local food distribution and food systems. Two prominent examples of risk factors&#x27; negative effect on a society&#x27;s food distribution system are the situation in Japan during World War II and Africa during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

=== Japan ===
Japanese food distribution drastically decreased from the effects of World War Two and the country&#x27;s economic shortcomings. The need for food during the 1920s and 1930s rose drastically as Japan&#x27;s population and average lifestyle increased. Japan was importing large amounts of rice, sugar, soybeans, and wheat from its colonies by 1935, and had a dependence on colonial possessions to distribute food to her people. 95% of Japanese rice between 1936 and 1938, just a few years before major conflict arose with the United States, was imported from its colonies in Korea and Formosa. Only 2% of Japan&#x27;s rice came from foreign countries.

As war engulfed Japan after 1941, food distribution efforts began to suffer. Japan lost a tremendous amount of cargo ships and was surrounded by an effective US blockade for most of the war. Imports were down, which cut off Japan from its primary source of food. Rationing programs, ran by Japan&#x27;s Central Foodstuff Corporation and Local Foodstuff Corporations, were an attempt to distribute food equally among the general population. Changes in tax collection and price control were also created to feed Japan, but these measures ultimately did not supply the Japanese people with enough food for survival. The average ration allowance consisted of a flour mixture which was often unhealthy and barely edible. Normal consumers age 16 to 60 received an average 330 g of ration per day in May 1943, and the situation only became more desperate as the war progressed. Rationing programs were reduced even further in July 1945, just before the war&#x27;s end.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
In Sub-Saharan Africa, the food distribution crisis of the 1970s and 1980s was a result of a multitude of food distribution risk factors including political problems, economic failures, and weather conditions. The heart of the political problems and economic failures affecting food distribution included poor agricultural pricing and a lack of state involvement with rural development. Some of the political problems can be traced back to the colonial period. Colonial policy supported the exportation of goods, even if it meant decreasing the amount of food for the local economy. Components of these colonial policies continued to be used after African countries gained their freedom from European nations. The usage of these failed policies caused malignant consequences on the economic situation of the peasant class, including the exploitation of peasant agriculture and in removal of peasants from their land. The weather and environmental issues regarding the Sub-Saharan African food distribution crisis also have roots in failed colonial policy. Labor migration cycles used during colonial times were ecologically damaging to the local environment and failed to create new areas for growing crops. As a result, desertification and a loss of soil fertility hurt the local agricultural sector, which then in turn negatively affected food distribution.

The world’s farmers produce enough food to feed 12 billion people, but the inequal food distribution leaves hundreds of millions hungry.

== Food distribution organizations ==

=== The FAO ===
One of the largest organizations working to avoiding food distribution crises on the global stage in the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The FAO is a branch of the United Nations, and actively works to improve food distribution in countries that need support

=== Organizations within the United States ===

==== Federal and large-scale ====
Several different organizations exist to mitigate and respond to food distribution crises in the United States. Prominent contributors to large-scale food distribution effort in the US include the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Salvation Army. FEMA and the USDA work together during food distribution crises to coordinate the procurement and transportation of nonperishable food, water, and other resources to afflicted areas. The Salvation Army receives federal supplies from FEMA and the USDA, and then works on the local level to distribute necessary goods. All food given to civilians during a crisis is typically distributed at mass emergency feeding stations.

==== Volunteer and local ====
Groups like FEMA, the USDA, and the Salvation Army could not operate without help from volunteers and small nonprofit groups. Prominent contributors to local food disaster efforts include groups like Emergency Communities and the American Rainbow Rapid Response (ARRR). These organizations typically focus on supplying rural and lower income areas that do not receive priority from large food distribution groups during a crisis.

==== The American Red Cross ====
Another group that works out of the United States is the American Red Cross. The American Red Cross is part of the International Red Cross, and 95% of all workers within the American Red Cross are volunteers. In the case of all crises, whether food related or not, the American Red Cross in engaged in relieving disaster victims. The Red Cross coordinates with local communities to provide essentials such as food, water, and hot meals for those in need during a crisis.

==== Food Distribution and Food Insecurity ====
Organizations that are founded to target food insecurity have relied on food distribution to serve people in need of regular nutritious foods. Food banks are the proper term to call these kind of organizations where they use &quot;government sector, private sector, and civil society&quot; to distribute and recover food that will ultimately go to waste. In the United States, there are many organizations all over the country that have the same similar goal however, there is not much effective collaboration between all organizations because it is challenging to coordinate efficient communication within one another.  There is one large organization that focuses on distributing food to people who need it in the United States, Feeding America has over 200 food banks and 60,000 food pantries.  There are more organizations that focus on distributing food that work independently and are not as big as Feeding America that contribute to distributing food to help with the issue of food insecurity.

<doc id="508258" wikidata="Q375093" url="?curid=508258" title="Björn Kurtén">
<text>Björn Kurtén (19 November 1924 – 28 December 1988) was a Finnish vertebrate paleontologist and science fiction writer.

==Early life and education==
Kurtén was born in Vaasa in 1924. He was a member of the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. He graduated from the Vaasa Svenska Samskola in 1943, but his education was interrupted by World War II, and he did not resume studies until he finished his military service in 1945.

He took courses in the University of Helsinki studying zoology, chemistry, geology, and paleontology. He went on to study the &quot;Hipparion&quot; genus in Uppsala, Sweden, publishing his first scientific paper on the genus in 1952 before earning his PhD from the University of Helsinki in 1954. Kurtén said that he chose paleontology as his career path because he did not want to do anything &quot;useful&quot;.

==Scientific career==
After receiving his PhD, Kurtén became a Docent at the University of Helsinki, a position he held until 1972. From 1972 until his death, he was a Professor at the university. Throughout his career, he frequently traveled to study paleontological collections throughout Europe and North America. He also did field work in Sweden, Spain, and Tunisia. He received several fellowships from foreign institutions and lectured at Harvard University.

He was a prominent writer of popular science. For his work in popular science, he received numerous awards including the Finnish state award for popular dissemination of knowledge and UNESCO&#x27;s Kalinga Prize.

Kurtén&#x27;s research focused primarily on carnivorans, particularly prehistoric bears and hyenas. He wrote fifteen papers and one book about prehistoric bears and was the first person to study allometry in fossil teeth.

==Fiction==
Kurtén wrote his first novel in his late teens. He wrote in the genre of prehistoric fiction, combining elements of paleontology with science fiction. He authored a series of books about encounters between humans and Neanderthals, such as &quot;Dance of the Tiger&quot;. His works of fiction have been translated into over fourteen languages, although only two of his novels, &quot;Dance of the Tiger&quot; and &quot;Singletusk&quot;, have been translated into English.

== Personal life ==
Kurtén married Ruth Nordman in 1950, and they had four children named Solveig, Joachim, Andrea, and Marina. He and his family spent summers in Stängesholmen, where they enjoyed birding, walking, and picking berries. Kurtén enjoyed the sauna, and often went straight from the sauna into cold ocean water, which he said brought out his &quot;viking blood&quot;. He did most of his writing in Stängesholmen.

==Death and legacy==
Kurtén died in Helsinki in 1988 due to complications following brain surgery. The University of Helsinki has a paleontological club called the Björn Kurtén Club, named in his honor.

The prehistoric cat species &quot;Prionailurus kurteni&quot; was named after Kurtén in 2024.

<doc id="508262" wikidata="Q7302857" url="?curid=508262" title="Record of the Nephites">
<text>Within the religions of the Latter-day Saint movement that developed in the U.S. during the early 1800s, the phrase record of the Nephites has two distinct but related usages. The primary use is to describe the collection of inscribed metal plates on which the Nephites purportedly recorded their history. An abridged version of this record, reportedly inscribed on gold plates, was the source of the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;, according to Joseph Smith. The Record of the Nephites was also the manuscript title of the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;. The Whitmerite branch of the Latter-Day Saint movement used &quot;The Record of the Nephites&quot; as the title for their version of the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;.

==Inscribed plates==

Beginning with Nephi, various people in the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; were charged with keeping a record of the secular and sacred history of the Nephites. These records were inscribed on metal plates. The record keeper was usually a prophet, although there are some minor authors who were not. For some portion of the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; history the records were kept by Nephite rulers, either kings or chief judges, many of whom were also prophets.

There were several sets of plates that constituted the record of the Nephites. Some of the plates are specifically mentioned in the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;, including the brass plates of Laban, the history of the Jaredites, and the large and small plates of Nephi.

According to the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;, Mormon, one of the last of the Nephites, abridged the record on the Golden Plates&quot;.&quot; Mormon states that he took his account primarily from the large plates of Nephi, but he also included the unabridged, small plates of Nephi.

Mormon&#x27;s son, Moroni, added to Mormon&#x27;s account but stated that he would have written more, &quot;if I had room upon the plates, but I have not; and ore I have none&quot; (Mormon 8:5). Moroni had been commanded by his father to seal the plates and &quot;hide up the record in the earth&quot; (Mormon 8:4). Adherents of Mormonism believe that Moroni, as an angel, appeared to Joseph Smith in 1823 and directed him to where the plates were hidden. According to Joseph Smith&#x27;s account, this was the Hill Cumorah, near Palmyra, New York.

==Manuscript title==

The &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; is sometimes published as &quot;The Record of the Nephites&quot;. It is also called &quot;The Nephite Record&quot; and &quot;The Stick of Joseph&quot;, depending on the publisher. The term Stick of Joseph is a reference to the verses in the King James Version of the Bible, Book of Ezekiel chapter 37, which the Latter Day Saint movement believes to be a prophecy of the &quot;Record of the Nephites&quot;.

Such titles may indicate that the text is from an unedited copy of the first edition, published 1830 by Egbert Grandin in Palmyra, New York.

Existing versions of the manuscript and first editions available for public perusal through archives such as The Joseph Smith Papers use the standard name the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;.

<text>Andrew Paul Marshall (born 27 August 1954) is a British comedy screenwriter, most noted for the domestic sitcom &quot;2point4 children&quot;. He was also the inspiration for Marvin the Paranoid Android in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. Although he had also previously adapted stories for &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, in 2002 he made a further move into writing &quot;straight&quot; drama, with the fantasy horror series &quot;Strange&quot;. He has also written several screenplays.

==Career==
Born in Lowestoft, Marshall attended Fen Park School and then Lowestoft Grammar School, and afterwards Borough Road College where he studied mathematics and psychology. Around the same time, he worked regularly on Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Week Ending&quot;, together with David Renwick, Douglas Adams, Alistair Beaton, John Lloyd, Simon Brett and others. Shortly afterwards he began writing &quot;The Burkiss Way&quot; with David Renwick and John Mason (who later dropped out to go to acting school). Renwick and Marshall remained scriptwriting partners for many years.

Brought by Humphrey Barclay to London Weekend Television, originally to repeat his &#x27;nursery slopes comedy&#x27; &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot; with &quot;End of Part One&quot;, Marshall and Renwick went on to write a series of television satires, including &quot;Whoops Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;Hot Metal&quot; and &quot;If You See God, Tell Him&quot; — the latter originally for Channel 4, but postponed for several years when the channel refused to let them direct it, and finally ending up at the BBC later.

They also experimented with a type of neo-Vaudeville style in &quot;The Steam Video Company&quot; for Thames Television, ultimately ending up at the BBC, writing, with Alexei Sayle, &quot;Alexei Sayle&#x27;s Stuff&quot;. Along the way they also wrote the screenplay for a film version of &quot;Whoops Apocalypse&quot; and adapted Tom Sharpe&#x27;s novel &quot;Wilt&quot; for a film of the same title.

After a tentative and unsuccessful attempt at solo writing with &quot;Sob Sisters&quot; at Central Television, Marshall found long-lasting success BBC One&#x27;s &quot;2point4 children&quot;, adding to it &quot;Health and Efficiency&quot; and later, &quot;Dad&quot;. He also found time to adapt Alexei Sayle&#x27;s short story &quot;Lose Weight, Ask Me How&quot; for the series &quot;Spinechillers&quot;, in which Sayle also starred.

Having also contributed to &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; on ITV, he next wrote drama with the telefantasy series &quot;Strange&quot; for Saturday nights on BBC One. However, due to scheduling issues, a one-year gap between the pilot episode and the series and the BBC&#x27;s decision not to repeat the pilot before the series began, the series failed to find a large audience in its Saturday night slot and was not recommissioned for a second run.

For many years Marshall avoided publicity of any kind, explaining that &quot;it&#x27;s very bad for you&quot; and cited his major influences as &quot;Alfred Hitchcock and Walt Disney... which explains a lot.&quot; In 2005, he had a small cameo appearance on-screen in an episode of David Renwick&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Love Soup&quot; on BBC One, alongside Renwick himself, as members of a sitcom script-writing team. He also appeared as a member of the critics panel on several editions of BBC 7&#x27;s &quot;Serious About Comedy&quot; in 2006–7.

He later began a new collaboration with Rob Grant, producing directing and writing the Radio 4 Series &quot;The Quanderhorn Xperimentations&quot; - and also the novel version published by Gollancz. He and Rob Grant launched a Radio 4 sketch Series &quot;The Nether Regions&quot; as writer/performers in October 2019.

<doc id="508264" wikidata="Q145573" url="?curid=508264" title="Zambo">
<text>Zambo ( ) or Sambu is a racial term historically used in the Spanish Empire to refer to people of mixed Amerindian and African ancestry. Occasionally in the 21st century, the term is used in the Americas to refer to persons who are of mixed African and Native American ancestry. 

The equivalent term in Brazil is  (). However, in Portugal and Portuguese-speaking Africa, &quot;cafuzo&quot; is used to refer to someone born of an African person and a person of mixed African and European ancestry.

==Background==
The word is believed to have originated from one of the Romance languages or Latin and its direct descendants. The feminine word is (not to be confused with the Argentine Zamba folk dance.)

In some parts of colonial Spanish America, the term applied to the children of one African and one Amerindian parent, or the children of two zambo parents. In New Spain (colonial Mexico), the term for those of mixed African and indigenous ancestry was (&quot;wolf&quot;). This term of classification appears in official marriage registers and other official documentation.

During this period, many other terms denoted individuals of African-Amerindian ancestry in ratios smaller or greater than the 50:50 of zambos: (zambo-Amerindian mixture) for example. Today in parts of Spanish America, refers to all people with significant or visible amounts of both African and Amerindian ancestry.

==History==
The term &quot;zambo&quot; was not formally used in Spanish territories. Competing terms, such as &quot;mulato&quot;, were also used. From the beginning the early sixteenth century, when African slaves were first imported to Hispaniola, unions between them and indigenous peoples, and Spanish colonists, began to take place. The two non-European groups sometimes worked together in the mines or on the plantations of Hispaniola, and on other Spanish Caribbean islands following the introduction of sugar cane production in the 1520s. In other cases, Africans took refuge in indigenous communities after escaping slavery.

The term &quot;zambos&quot; was generally used to refer to persons who did not have European ancestry, but all sorts of unions took place through the centuries, of course. In the eighteenth century, the Spanish began making formal racial classifications, and defined &quot;zambo&quot; in what became its final, official meaning.

Some &quot;zambo&quot; groups became well known after being created by runaway or rebel Africans who mixed with or took over indigenous communities. In the unconquered regions of Esmeraldes, in what would become Ecuador, for example, a small group of shipwrecked former slaves gained control of some indigenous communities, eventually representing them before Spanish authorities in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.

The Misquito Zambos developed as the descendants of a group of African slaves who revolted in 1640 on a slave ship. They wrecked it at Cape Gracias a Dios on the border between Honduras and Nicaragua, to escape into the interior. There they united with the indigenous Miskito people. By the early eighteenth century, Afro-Miskito people came to dominate the kingdom. They led warriors on many extensive slave raids to capture slaves for sale to Europeans. Their alliance and protection of English-speaking merchants and settlers in the area helped Great Britain found the colony of British Honduras (present day Belize).

==Today==
Officially, zambos represent sizeable minorities in the northwestern South American countries of Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela, Guyana, and Ecuador, as well as in the Central American country of Panama. A small, but noticeable number of zambos, resulting from recent unions of Amerindian men to Afro-Ecuadorian women, and they are common in major coastal cities of Ecuador and in Imbabura province. Prior to rural-to-urban migration in Ecuador, Afro-Ecuadorians were mostly confined to the Esmeraldas Province and the Chota Valley in Imbabura Province. A 2021 genetic study in the journal &quot;Human Genetics and Genomic Advances&quot; showed that the average Afro-Ecuadorian carries significantly higher amounts of Amerindian ancestry than all other Afro-latino groups to the north of the country, with an average of 35.86% Amerindian heritage.

In Central America, two indigenous-African mixed groups have developed: the Miskito and the Garifuna. The Garifuna originated from the combination of Africans who were shipwrecked or fled from neighboring islands to St. Vincent during the 17th and the 19l8th centuries. In 1797, they were deported by the British for supporting France during the French Revolutionary Wars to the island of Roatan, off the coast of Honduras. From there, they reached the mainland and developed communities along the coast of Central America from Nicaragua to Belize.

In Mexico, where zambos were sometimes known as &quot;lobos&quot; (literally meaning wolves), they form a sizeable minority. According to the 2015 Intercensus Estimate, 896,829 people identified as both Afro-Mexican and Indigenous Mexican. The vast majority of the country&#x27;s Afro-descended population has been absorbed into the wider mestizo population. Greater concentrations can be found only in communities scattered around the southern coastal states, including Michoacán, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Campeche, Quintana Roo, Yucatán, and Veracruz, where many of the country&#x27;s Afro-Mexicans reside.

Culturally, Mexican &quot;lobos&quot; followed Amerindian traditions, rather than African influences, as they often had Amerindian mothers and were brought up in her culture. Such acculturation also took place in Bolivia, where the Afro-Bolivian community absorbed and retained many aspects of Amerindian cultural influences, such as dress and the use of the Aymara language. Those communities of Afro-Bolivians reside in the &quot;Yungas&quot; region of the Bolivian department of La Paz.
== Racism and discrimination ==
The populations of African and Amerindian ancestry have generally been marginalized and discriminated against.

In March 2008, the then US Senator Barack Obama reflected in a speech the difficult situation faced by the populations of African and Amerindian ancestors, thereby demonstrating his concern for the Zamba population of his country.

<doc id="508266" wikidata="Q1550536" url="?curid=508266" title="Philippe-Antoine Merlin de Douai">
<text>Philippe-Antoine Merlin, known as Merlin de Douai (, 30 October 1754 – 26 December 1838), was a French politician and lawyer.

==Early life==
Merlin de Douai was born at Arleux, Nord, and was called to the Flemish bar association in 1775. He collaborated in the &quot;Répertoire de jurisprudence&quot;, the later editions of which appeared under Merlin&#x27;s superintendence, and contributed to other important legal compilations. In 1782 he purchased a position as royal secretary at the chancellery of the Flanders parlement. His reputation spread to Paris and he was consulted by leading magistrates. The Duke of Orléans selected him to be a member of his privy council.

As an elected member of the States-General for the Third Estate in Douai, he was one of the chief of those who applied the principles of liberty and equality embodied in the National Constituent Assembly&#x27;s &quot;Tennis Court Oath&quot; of 20 June 1789.

==Career==
On behalf of the committee, appointed to deal with the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;’s nobility rights, Merlin de Douai presented to the Assembly reports on manorialism and the subjects of redistribution with compensation, and topics associated with them (hunting and fishing rights, forestry etc.). He carried legislation for the abolition of primogeniture and secured equality of inheritance between relatives of the same degree and between men and women. He also prepared the report for the Assembly that argued that no compensation should be paid to the German princes whose lands in Alsace were forfeit when France incorporated them.

His numerous reports were supplemented by popular exposition of current legislation in the &quot;Journal de legislation&quot;. On the dissolution of the Assembly, he became judge of the criminal court at Douai.

===National Convention===
Although not always an advocate of violent measures, as a deputy to the National Convention in The Mountain, Merlin de Douai voted for the execution of King Louis XVI. Later, as a member of the council of legislation, he presented to the Convention the &quot;Law of Suspects&quot; (17 September 1793), permitting the detention of suspects, (a document backed by Georges Couthon and Maximilien Robespierre). He exercised missions in his native region and accused General Charles François Dumouriez of having betrayed the country during the Campaign of the Low Countries (after the Battle of Neerwinden).

Merlin de Douai was closely allied with his namesake Merlin of Thionville and, after the start of the Thermidorian Reaction, which brought about the fall of Robespierre in 1794, became president of the Convention and a member of the Committee of Public Safety. His efforts were primarily directed to the prevention of any new gathering of powers by the Jacobin Club, the Commune and the Revolutionary Tribunal.

Merlin de Douai convinced the Committee of Public Safety to agree with the closing of the Jacobin Club on the ground that it was an administrative, rather than a legislative, measure. Merlin de Douai recommended the readmission of the survivors of the Girondin party to the Convention and drew up a law limiting the right of insurrection. He had also a considerable share in the foreign policy of the French Republic.

Merlin de Douai had been commissioned in April 1794 to report on the civil and criminal legislation of France, and, after eighteen months work, he produced the &quot;Rapport et projet de code des délits et des peines&quot; (10 Vendémiaire, an IV). Merlin&#x27;s code abolished confiscation, branding and life imprisonment and was based chiefly on the penal code that had been drawn up in September 1791.

===Directory===
He was made Minister of Justice (30 October 1795) and later Minister of the General Police (2 January 1796) under the Directory, before moving back to the Justice Ministry (3 April 1796) keeping tight surveillance of the Royalist &quot;émigrés&quot;. After the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; known as &quot;18 Fructidor&quot;, he became one of the five Directors on 5 September 1797. He was accused of the bankruptcy and various other failures of the government and was forced to retire into private life during the Coup of 30 Prairial VII on 18 June 1799.

===Consulate and Empire===
Merlin de Douai had no share in Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s &quot;18 Brumaire&quot; coup. Under the Consulate, Merlin de Douai accepted a minor position in the &quot;Cour de cassation&quot;, where he soon became &quot;procureur-général&quot; (Attorney General). Although he had no share in drawing up the Napoleonic Code, he was very involved in matters regarding its application. He became a member of the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot;, Count of the Empire, and &quot;Grand Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;.

===Exile and July Monarchy===
Having resumed his functions during the Hundred Days, he was one of those banished on the Second Bourbon Restoration.

The years of his exile were devoted to his &quot;Répertoire de jurisprudence&quot; (5th ed., 18 vols., Paris, 1827–1828) and to his &quot;Recueil alphabétique des questions de droit&quot; (4th ed., 8 vols., Paris, 1827–1828). At the 1830 July Revolution, he returned to France and re-entered the &quot;Institut de France&quot;, of which he had been an original member. He was admitted to the Academy of Political and Moral Sciences by the July Monarchy. He died in Paris in 1838 at the age of 84.

==Personal life==
Merlin de Douai&#x27;s son, Antoine François Eugène Merlin (1778–1854), was a well-known general in the French Revolutionary Army and served in most of the Napoleonic Wars.

<doc id="508270" wikidata="Q33384278" url="?curid=508270" title="Huron National Forest">
<text>The Huron National Forest is a National Forest in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. It was established in 1909 after the logging era began to decline. In 1945, it was administratively combined with the Manistee National Forest, to create the Huron–Manistee National Forest. However, these are not connected and are separate forests. It provides recreation opportunities for visitors, habitat for fish and wildlife, and resources for local industry. The headquarters for the forest is located in Cadillac, Michigan.

==History==
 During the Great Depression land was bought by the U.S. Forest Service to help farmers and landowners and to inject money into the economy. However, some landowners only sold the unproductive land and kept the productive areas, thus breaking up the land purchases. The Forest Service established the Huron National Forest in 1909.

The Huron National Forest is spreading east to west and north to south. The forest was renamed in 1929 after an Iroquoian tribe of the Great Lakes Region—the Huron.

==Geography==
The Huron National Forest is prone to frequent seasonal forest fires, due to ecological and geological factors including the domination of the jack pine in sections the forests, the needles of which are extremely flammable, sandy soil composition as a result of glacial outwash plain geology of sections of the Huron National Forest, and jack pine barrens management practices to create nesting habitat for the Kirtland&#x27;s warbler resulting in dense, young stands of jack pine that are extremely susceptible to crowning wildfires.

In 2010, the Meridian Boundary Fire burned over in and near the Huron District of the Huron National Forest. The fire destroyed 13 homes, damaged two others, and destroyed or damaged 46 outbuildings.
==Features==
The Bull Gap ORV Trail is located in the Huron National Forest. It contains of off-road vehicle trails.

The threatened Kirtland&#x27;s warbler nests in the area, and tours are available, subject to time restrictions.

<text>Olaf or Olav (, , or British ; ) is a Dutch, Polish, Scandinavian and German given name. It is presumably of Proto-Norse origin, reconstructed as &quot;*Anu-laibaz&quot;, from &quot;anu&quot; &quot;ancestor, grand-father&quot; and &quot;laibaz&quot; &quot;heirloom, descendant&quot;.
Old English forms are attested as &quot;Ǣlāf&quot;, &quot;Anlāf&quot;. The corresponding Old Novgorod dialect form is &quot;Uleb&quot;. A later English form of the name is &quot;Olave&quot;.

In the Norwegian language, &quot;Olav&quot; and &quot;Olaf&quot; are equally common, but Olav is traditionally used when referring to Norwegian royalty. The Swedish form is &quot;Olov&quot; or &quot;Olof&quot;, and the Danish form is &quot;Oluf&quot;. It was borrowed into Old Irish and Scottish Gaelic with the spellings &quot;Amlaíb&quot; and &quot;Amhlaoibh&quot;, giving rise to modern version &quot;Aulay&quot;.
The name is Latinized as &quot;Olaus&quot;.

<text>Antoine Christophe Merlin (13 September 1762 in Thionville, Moselle – September 1833 in Paris) was a member of several legislative bodies during the era of the French Revolution. He is usually called Merlin de [[Thionville]] (Merlin of Thionville) to distinguish him from Philippe-Antoine Merlin de Douai.

==Life==
He was born at Thionville, the son of a &quot;procureur&quot; in the &quot;bailliage&quot; of Thionville. After studying theology, he began a career in law, and in 1788 was an &quot;avocat&quot; at the &quot;parlement&quot; of Metz. In 1790 he was elected municipal officer of Thionville, and was sent by the department of Moselle to the Legislative Assembly. On 23 October 1791 he moved and carried the institution of a committee of surveillance, of which he became a member. It was he who proposed the law sequestrating the property of the émigrés, and he took an important part in the Demonstration of 20 June 1792 and in the revolution of 10 August of the same year.

He was elected deputy to the National Convention, and pressed for the execution of Louis XVI, but a mission to the army prevented his attending the trial. He displayed great bravery in the defence of Mainz. He took part in the Thermidorian Reaction which brought about the fall of Robespierre, and was appointed to the Committee of General Security on 31 July 1794. He sat in the Council of Five Hundred under the Directory, and at the Coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797) demanded the deportation of certain republican members. In 1798 he ceased to be a member of the Council of Five Hundred, and was appointed director-general of posts, being sent subsequently to organize the Army of Italy. He retired into private life at the proclamation of the Consulate, and lived in retirement under the Consulate and the First French Empire.

<doc id="508287" wikidata="Q6166984" url="?curid=508287" title="Ding Darling">
<text>Jay Norwood Darling (October 21, 1876 – February 12, 1962), better known as Ding Darling, was an American cartoonist who won two Pulitzer Prizes. He was an important figure in the 20th century conservation movement and founded the National Wildlife Federation. In addition, he was known to be close friends with Walt Disney.

== Early life ==

Darling was born in Norwood, Michigan, where his parents, Clara R. (Woolson) and Marcellus Warner Darling, had recently moved so that Marcellus could begin work as a minister. In 1886, the family moved to Sioux City, Iowa, where Darling developed an early appreciation for nature and wildlife during days spent wandering the prairie. He began to learn the importance of conservation as a youth after an uncle admonished him for shooting a wood duck during nesting season.

Darling began college in 1894 at Yankton College in South Dakota and moved to Beloit College in Wisconsin the following year, where he began his studies in pre-medicine and became a member of Beta Theta Pi. While at Beloit he became art editor of the yearbook and began signing his work with a contraction of his last name, D&#x27;ing, a nickname that stuck.

==Editorial cartoons==
In 1900, Ding became a reporter for the &quot;Sioux City Journal&quot;. Following his marriage to Genevieve Pendleton in 1906, he began work with the &quot;Des Moines Register and Leader&quot;. In 1911, he moved to New York and worked with the &quot;New York Globe&quot; but went back to Des Moines in 1913. Three years later, in 1916, he returned to New York and accepted a position with the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. By 1919, Darling returned a final time to Des Moines where he continued his career as a cartoonist, winning the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 1924 and again in 1943. His cartoons were published from 1917 to 1949 in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;.

==Wildlife conservation==

Darling penned some conservation cartoons, and he was an important figure in the conservation movement. President Franklin Roosevelt appointed him to a blue-ribbon Committee on Wildlife Restoration in 1934. FDR sought political balance by putting the Hoover Republican on the committee, knowing he was an articulate advocate for wildlife management.

Following the passage of the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act in 1934, which required waterfowl hunters to purchase a Federal Duck Stamp before hunting, Darling designed the first Federal Duck Stamp that year and was appointed Director of the Bureau of Biological Survey, a forerunner of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

 The J. N. &quot;Ding&quot; Darling National Wildlife Refuge on Sanibel Island in southwest Florida is named after him, as is the Lake Darling State Park in Iowa that was dedicated on September 17, 1950. Lake Darling, a 9,600-acre lake at the Upper Souris National Wildlife Refuge is also named in his honor. More recently a lodge at the National Conservation Training Center near Shepherdstown, West Virginia was named in his honor.

Darling was elected as a member of the Boone and Crockett Club, a wildlife conservation organization, on December 13, 1934.

He was instrumental in founding the National Wildlife Federation in 1936, when President Franklin Roosevelt convened the first North American Wildlife Conference (now the North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference), administered by the American Wildlife Institute (now Wildlife Management Institute).

==Awards==

Darling twice received the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning for his work with the &quot;Register &amp; Tribune&quot;. Darling was first awarded the prize in 1924 for his work &quot;In the Good Old USA&quot; and again in 1943 for &quot;What a Place For a Waste Paper Salvage Campaign&quot;.

He was awarded the Audubon Medal in 1960 by National Audubon Society for &quot;outstanding achievement in the field of conservation and environmental protection&quot;.

<text>Wok racing is a sport developed by the German TV host and entertainer Stefan Raab in which modified woks are used to make timed runs down an Olympic bobsleigh track. There are competitions for and , the latter using four woks per sled.

== History ==
Wok racing was inspired by a bet in the German TV show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;. In November 2003, the &quot;First official Wok World Championship&quot; was broadcast from Winterberg. The immediate success led to the second world championship in Innsbruck on March 4, 2004. Participants are mostly b-list celebrities like musical artists, actors, and TV hosts, but there are also known athletes that have ongoing professional careers in winter sports, like three-time Olympic luge champion Georg Hackl and the Jamaican Bobsled Team.

The third championship took place again in Winterberg on March 5, 2005. In contrast to the previous championships, there were two runs in which all contesters participated. The times of both runs were added. As a further innovation a qualifying round was created in which the participants had to jump from a trickski-jump with woks to determine the starting order. Further the sport event was professionalized.

==Equipment==

The typical racing woks are the ordinary round-bottomed Chinese pans, usually directly imported from China. The only modifications are that the bottom is reinforced with an epoxy filling and the edges of the wok are coated with polyurethane foam to avoid injuries. Four-person woksleds consist of two pairs of woks, each of them is held together by a rounded frame. The two pairs are connected by a coupling. Due to the rather risky nature of the sport the participants wear heavy protective gear, usually similar to ice hockey equipment. To further reduce friction and the risk of injuries, the athletes wear ladles under their feet.

To improve performance, the undersides of the woks are often heated with a blowlamp before the race.

==Advertising controversy==
Public wok racing is only practiced once a year at The &quot;World Wok Racing Championships&quot; (German: Wok-WM, , lit. Wok Worldcup) which is aired as special edition of Raab&#x27;s show &quot;TV total&quot; on the German television channel ProSieben. The network used to declare these broadcasts as sporting events. Under German law that allowed the network to treat the massive corporate sponsorship of the event as incidental advertising which didn&#x27;t count against Germany&#x27;s strict rules regarding time limits for TV commercials. After a Berlin court ruling in 2009, however, the shows have to be labeled as an infomercial, since – unlike a regular sporting event – the races are explicitly staged for the TV broadcast, and there is strong evidence that the profits of the event sponsorship directly benefit the network.

<text>Antoine François Claude, comte Ferrand (; 4 July 175117 January 1825), French statesman and political writer, was born in Paris, and became a member of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris at eighteen.

==Life and career==
Ferrand left France with the first party of emigrants, and attached himself to the Prince of Condé; late he was a member of the council of regency formed by the comte de Provence after the death of Louis XVI. He lived at Regensburg until 1801, when he returned to France, though he still sought to serve the royalist cause.

In 1814 Ferrand was made minister of state and postmaster-general. Ferrand countersigned the act of sequestration of Napoleon&#x27;s property, and introduced a bill for the restoration of the property of the emigrants establishing a distinction, since become famous, between royalist of &quot;la ligne droite&quot; and those of &quot;la ligne courbe&quot;. At the second Bourbon restoration Ferrand was again for a short time postmaster general. He was also made a peer of France, member of the privy council, grand-officer and secretary of the orders of Saint Michel and the Saint Esprit, and in 1816 member of the Académie française. He continued his active support of ultra-royalist views until his death, which took place in Paris on 17 January 1825.

Besides a large number of political pamphlets, Ferrand was the author of:
*&quot;Éloge funèbre de Mme Élisabeth, sœur de Louis XVI&quot;
*&quot;L&#x27;Esprit de l&#x27;histoire, ou Lettres d&#x27;un père a son fils sur la manére d&#x27;étudier l&#x27;histoire&quot; (4 vols., 1802), which reached several editions, the last number in 1826 having prefixed to it a biographical sketch of the author by his nephew Héricart de Thury
*&quot;Éloge historique de Madame Élisabeth de France&quot; (1814)
*&quot;Œuvres dramatiques&quot; (1817)
*&quot;Théorie des révolutions rapprochée des principaux événènements qui en ont été l&#x27;origine, le développement ou la suite&quot; (4 vols., 1817)
*&quot;Histoire des trois démembrements de la Pologne, pour faire suite l&#x27;Histoire de l&#x27;anarchie de Pologne par Russie&quot; (3 vols., 1820).

<doc id="508306" wikidata="Q1764480" url="?curid=508306" title="Otto Fetting">
<text>Otto Fetting (November 20, 1871 – January 30, 1933) was an American realtor and editor from Port Huron, Michigan who served first as a pastor and evangelist in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and then later as an apostle in the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), commonly referred to as the &quot;Hedrickites&quot;. Fetting claimed to have been visited by John the Baptist thirty or more times between February 4, 1927 and his death on January 30, 1933. Fetting was reportedly given instruction concerning the doctrine and practices of Hedrickites and other factions of Christianity, together with directives to begin construction of a temple on the Temple Lot, including its exact dimensions.

After initially accepting his first eleven revelations, a Hedrickite conference vote in early October 1929 rejected a key portion of Fetting&#x27;s twelfth message, leading him to found the &quot;Church of Jesus Christ&quot; on April 8, 1930. This breakaway faction, later referred to as &quot;Church of Christ&quot;, subsequently gave birth to additional rival factions after Fetting&#x27;s death, which have still further subdivided. These &quot;Fettingite&quot; or &quot;Dravesite&quot; (named after W.A. Draves, a follower of Fetting) factions include: the Church of Christ &quot;With the Elijah Message&quot; Established Anew 1929; the Church of Christ (Restored); the Church of Christ (Assured Way); and the Church of Christ at Halley&#x27;s Bluff.

==Early life==
Otto Fetting was born in Casco, Michigan. Eventually making his home in nearby Port Huron, Michigan, he was baptised into the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on February 9, 1891, and ordained to its priesthood in 1899. 

Fetting married Jennie M. Mills in 1893, with whom he had one son, Roy.

In 1925, dismayed by the &quot;Supreme Directional Control&quot; controversy within the RLDS church, Fetting switched his allegiance to the Temple Lot organization. At the time, this did not require rebaptism or reordination, as each group accepted the priesthood and sacraments of the other. In the spring of 1926, he was among seven men ordained to be Apostles in the Church of Christ.

==Visitation by John the Baptist==
On February 4, 1927, Fetting claimed that he had been visited by John the Baptist, who delivered a message for him to give to the Hedrickite organization. This message commanded construction of the long-awaited Temple in Independence, Missouri, first foretold by Latter Day Saint founder Joseph Smith in 1831. The Temple Lot church had a long history of direction via revelation and angel visits, and thus was originally receptive to these alleged visits of the Biblical prophet, publishing Fetting&#x27;s messages in their monthly periodical &quot;Zion&#x27;s Advocate&quot;. They also began work on the temple with a groundbreaking ceremony held on April 6, 1929. According to Fetting, the Hedrickites were given seven years to complete the structure.

Fetting&#x27;s &quot;visitor&quot; revealed various architectural details for the building, and specifically directed surveyors to move their markers ten feet to the east of where they had originally been placed. The angel also revealed the location of two of Joseph Smith&#x27;s original marker stones, which Smith had buried ninety-eight years before to indicate the location for his planned temple. He also indicated that the &quot;Articles of Faith and Practice&quot; of the Temple Lot church were correct, and should not be changed from their original form. On other occasions, the messenger indicated particular men to be ordained within the organization, including to its Quorum of Twelve Apostles.

==The twelfth message==
Although the Temple Lot organization had enthusiastically accepted the first eleven of Fetting&#x27;s messages, this would not hold true for the twelfth. In verse four of this missive, John the Baptist states that all persons coming into the Church of Christ must be rebaptized, as &quot;the Lord has rejected all creeds and factions of men&quot;. While this reflects the practice of the majority of Latter Day Saint denominations (including the Temple Lot church itself, today), it did not reflect the policy of the Temple Lot church at the time, which accepted members during this period from the Reorganized church, certain other Latter Day Saint organizations, and Joseph Smith&#x27;s pre-1844 church on their original baptisms. This message equally declared Fetting to have been given the same &quot;keys to the priesthood&quot; that were given to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on May 15, 1829.

Controversy over the meaning and application of Fetting&#x27;s twelfth message became so great that Fetting himself was &quot;silenced&quot; in October 1929 by the Temple Lot organization. Choosing to withdraw rather than continue under such a restriction, Fetting led approximately 1,400, or one-third, of the Church of Christ members (including some of its apostles) to found an organization of his own, which became known as the Church of Christ (Fettingite). Since the main Temple Lot organization retained possession of the Temple Lot and its meetinghouse, Fetting&#x27;s organization met in members&#x27; homes for a considerable period prior to building their own worship facilities.

==Death and testimonial==
Fetting would be visited a total of 30 times by his &quot;messenger&quot; prior to his death on January 30, 1933. To the end of his life, Fetting insisted upon the veracity of his heavenly visitor, and the truth of the messages he was given. He authored the following testimony in 1929:

:TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

:I make this solemn declaration before God this day, God being my witness, and I expect some day to stand before the judgement bar to answer for this statement.

:The manifestation and words of the visits of the Messenger are true. I have seen him from time to time. I heard his voice, I&#x27;ve seen his face, I saw the light, I felt his hand on my head and the slap on my shoulder. I was enwrapt in that wonderful Heavenly and Divine power, and the words I have given you are not my words, but the words God sent by John the Baptist.

:I want to make this statement, so that everyone may know that this is true; it matters little what will become of me hereafter, but I cannot, nor will not, deny the things I have seen and heard from the Heavenly Messenger as long as I have my right mind, and God gives me life and His grace to endure here on Earth.

:Others may make statements about me, but I want this to be understood that this statement is true. And I shall abide by the advice and instructions given by the Messenger regardless of what men may say.

:Signed Otto Fetting

:Independence, Missouri, October 9, 1929

Four other people claimed to have seen John the Baptist during his final visit to Fetting, and their testimony was notarized.

Fetting was buried in Zion Cemetery in Watertown, Michigan (now part of Sandusky).

==Division of the Fettingite organization==
Four years after Fetting&#x27;s death, a young Fettingite Elder named William A. Draves from Nucla, Colorado claimed that the same messenger who had appeared to Fetting had begun to appear to him, as well. While many of Fetting&#x27;s followers accepted Draves and his messages, some did not, leading to a split in the Fettingite organization in 1939. Draves&#x27; adherents formed the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, which claims to be the sole legitimate continuance of Fetting&#x27;s original organization. Draves himself would receive a total of 90 messages prior to his death in 1994, all of which were combined with Fetting&#x27;s into a book entitled &quot;The Word of the Lord Brought to Mankind by an Angel&quot;.

The Fettingites who rejected Draves&#x27; claims later split into two separate organizations, divided by the decision of the Church of Christ (Fettingite)—the remnant in Independence who rejected William Draves&#x27; claims—to introduce the Saturday Sabbath into their organization during the 1950s under Apostle S.T. Bronson. A group of congregations in Louisiana and Mississippi, under the leadership of A.C. DeWolf, rejected this change and formed the Church of Christ (Restored), which continues to observe Sunday as their day of worship.

Other than disagreeing as to the proper day for worship, the &quot;Bronsonite&quot; and &quot;DeWolf&quot; organizations remain virtually identical in doctrine and practice. Both of them accept Fetting&#x27;s ministry and messages, but not Draves&#x27;. Each rejects the other, and considers itself the sole true continuation of Otto Fetting&#x27;s church. Draves&#x27; organization, on the other hand, rejects both of these groups, accepting their founder&#x27;s messages &quot;and&quot; those of Otto Fetting.

The Church of Christ at Halley&#x27;s Bluff has no connection with any of these organizations, though it does accept Fetting&#x27;s message (but not those of Draves).

<text>Iphitos or Īphitus (; Ancient Greek: Ἴφιτος) is the name of six individuals in Greek mythology.

*Iphitos, son of Eurytus, king of Oechalia. As Iole&#x27;s brother, he was Heracles&#x27; brother-in-law and, according to one version of the myth, also his lover.
*Iphitos, son of Naubolus and king of Phocis, others say his father was the son of Hippasus from Peloponessus. He entertained Jason when he consulted the Delphic Oracle and later joined the Argonauts. Iphitus was an ally of the Thebans in the war of the Seven against Thebes. He was the leader of men from Phocis and the cities of Panope, Daulis, Cyparissos, Lebadia and Hyampolis during the war. By his wife Hippolyte or Thrasybule, Iphitos became the father of Schedius and Epistrophus who led the Phocians in the Trojan War.
*Iphitos, an Elean who was killed by Copreus, son of Pelops, who fled from Elis after the murder and later on was purified by King Eurystheus in Mycenae. According to the writer Alcman, Iphitos along with Lycurgus, belonged to the participants in the first Olympic Games.
*Iphitus, father of Eurynome, who was the mother of King Adrastus of Argos, one of the Seven against Thebes.
*Iphitos, an elderly Trojan during the Trojan War. In Book VIII of the &quot;Iliad,&quot; his son Archeptolemus suddenly becomes the charioteer of Hector when Eniopeus was killed by Diomedes. However, Teucer killed him in the same battle. In &quot;Aeneid&quot; Book II, Aeneas named Iphitos among half a dozen Trojan heroes who fight by his side during the fall of Troy. When the battle turned against them, Iphitos was the only one of these who remained standing. He was apparently by Aeneas&#x27;s side until King Priam was killed. In some accounts, Iphitos was also the father of Coeranus who was killed by Odysseus.
*Iphitos, king of Elis, restored the Olympic Games after the Dorian invasion. The restoration came after he asked the Oracle at Delphi about what should be done to save Greece from civil war and the diseases that were killing the population. The Oracle answered: &quot;Iphitos and the people of Elis must declare a sacred truce for the duration of the game and revive the Olympic Games&quot;.

<text>Jean-François Casimir Delavigne (; 4 April 179311 December 1843) was a French poet and dramatist.

==Life and career==
Delavigne was born at Le Havre, but was sent to Paris to be educated at the Lycée Napoleon. He read extensively. When, on 20 March 1811 the empress Marie Louise gave birth to a son, named in his cradle as king of Rome, the event was celebrated by Delavigne in a &quot;Dithyrambe sur la naissance du roi de Rome&quot;, which obtained him a sinecure in the revenue office.

About this time he competed twice for an academy prize, but without success. Inspired by the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, he wrote two impassioned poems, the first entitled &quot;Waterloo&quot;, the second, &quot;Devastation du muse&quot;, both written in the heat of patriotic enthusiasm, and teeming with popular political allusions. A third, less successful poem, &quot;Sur le besoin de s&#x27;unir après le départ des étrangers&quot;, was afterwards added. These stirring pieces, termed by him &quot;Messéniennes&quot;, found an echo in the hearts of the French people. Twenty-five thousand copies were sold; Delavigne was famous. He was appointed to an honorary librarianship, with no duties to discharge. In 1819 his play &quot;Les Vêpres Siciliennes&quot; was performed at the Odéon, then just rebuilt; it had previously been refused for the Théâtre Français. On the night of the first representation, which was warmly received, Picard, the manager, is said to have exclaimed, &quot;You have saved us! You are the founder of the second French Theatre.&quot;

This success was followed up by the production of the &quot;Comédiens&quot; (1820), an inferior play, with little plot, and the &quot;Paria&quot; (1821), which contained some well-written choruses. The latter piece obtained a longer lease of life than its intrinsic literary merits warranted, on account of the popularity of the political opinions freely expressed in it: so freely expressed, indeed, that the displeasure of the king was incurred, and Delavigne lost his post. But Louis-Philippe of France, willing to gain the people&#x27;s good wishes by complimenting their favourite, wrote to him as follows:

&quot;The thunder has descended on your house; I offer you an apartment in mine.&quot;

Accordingly, Delavigne became librarian at the Palais Royal, a position he retained for the rest of his life. It was here that he wrote the &quot;École des vieillards&quot; (1823), his best comedy, which gained his election to the in 1825. To this period also belong &quot;La Princesse Aurilie&quot; (1828), and &quot;Marino Faliero&quot; (1829), a drama in the romantic style.

For his success as a writer Delavigne was largely indebted to the nature of the times in which he lived. &quot;The Messéniennes&quot; had their origin in the excitement resulting from the occupation of France by the allies in 1815. Another crisis in his life and in the history of his country, the revolution of 1830, stimulated him to the production of a second masterpiece, &quot;La Parisienne&quot;. This song, set to music by Daniel Auber, was on the lips of every Frenchman, and rivalled in popularity the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;. It was the French national anthem during the July Monarchy. A companion piece, &quot;La Varsovienne&quot;, was written for the Poles, by whom it was sung on the march to battle. Other works of Delavigne followed each other in rapid succession:
*&quot;Louis XI&quot; (1832)
*&quot;Les Enfants d&#x27;Édouard&quot; (1833)
*&quot;Don Juan d&#x27;Autriche&quot; (1835)
*&quot;Une Famille au temps du Luther&quot; (1836)
*&quot;La Popularité&quot; (1838)
*&quot;La Fille du Cid&quot; (1839)
*&quot;Le Conseiller rapporteur&quot; (1840)
*&quot;Charles VI&quot; (1843), an opera partly written by his brother Germain Delavigne, music by Fromental Halévy

In 1843 he left Paris to seek in Italy the health his labors had cost him. At Lyon his strength altogether gave way, and he died on 11 December. His &quot;Poèsies&quot; and his &quot;Théâtre&quot; were published in 1863. His &quot;Œuvres completes&quot; (new edition, 1855) contains a biographical notice by his brother, Germain Delavigne, who is best known as a librettist in opera.

<text>The Ontario Science Centre (OSC; originally the Centennial Museum of Science and Technology) is a science museum organization based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Its original location opened to the public in 1969 and was located near the Don Valley Parkway about northeast of downtown on Don Mills Road in the former city of North York. It was built down the side of a wooded ravine formed by one branch of the Don River located in Flemingdon Park.

In 2023, Premier of Ontario Doug Ford announced the Ontario government&#x27;s plan to replace the Ontario Science Centre with a smaller institution on the Toronto waterfront. The following year, the government announced that the Don Mills location would close permanently after an engineering report identified a high risk of roof collapse. Both decisions have been met with considerable public opposition. 

==History==
===Construction and opening===
Planning for the Science Centre started in 1961 during Toronto&#x27;s massive expansion of the late 1950s and 1960s. In August 1964, Premier of Ontario John Robarts announced the creation of the Centennial Centre of Science and Technology as a Centennial Project. Toronto architect Raymond Moriyama was hired to design the site. Construction started in 1966 with plans to open the Centennial Centre of Science and Technology as part of the Canadian Centennial celebrations in 1967.

However, construction was not completed in 1967, and the Science Centre did not open to the public until two years later, on September 26, 1969. The official opening was held on the morning of September 27 and attended by VIPs, and was followed by opening to 30,000 invited guests in early afternoon. It opened to the general public on September 28, drawing 9,000 visitors. Its advertising slogan at launch was &quot;Come see what would happen if Albert Einstein and Walt Disney had gotten together.&quot;

The buildings and design were part of a broader change in Canadian architecture, and remain an example of the brutalist style.

When it first opened, the Science Centre was a pioneer for its hands-on approach to science, along with San Francisco&#x27;s Exploratorium and the Michigan Science Center in Detroit. Unlike a traditional museum, where exhibits are for viewing only, the majority of the exhibits at the Science Centre were interactive, while many others were live demonstrations (e.g. metalworking). The Communications room contained a number of computerized displays, including a very popular tic-tac-toe game, run on a PDP-11 minicomputer.

By 1974, it hosted about 250,000 students on field trips annually.{{rp|82}}

=== Operations from 1990 to 2022 ===

In 1990, the Ontario Science Centre announced a contract with Oman to design a children&#x27;s museum. The Ontario Science Centre had agreed to boycott Israeli goods and services while under contract. The Ontario Science Centre later amended the contract to specify that all goods sold to Oman would be produced in North America. The centre&#x27;s Director General Mark Abbott was later fired for knowingly signing the original contract.

In 2001, the Centre embarked on a capital project called &quot;Agents of Change&quot;, which focused on innovation and renewed about 85% of the Centre&#x27;s public space, including the creation of seven new experience areas. The Centre received $47.5 million in contributions from the government of Ontario, private sector companies, and individuals. The Agents of Change transformation was completed 2007, culminating with the opening of the Weston Family Innovation Centre and the Teluscape plaza.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, the Science Centre received $500,000 from the Government of Canada to promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake among children and their families.

=== Facility decay, replacement plans, and closure ===

Due to structural decay, which required closing of the pedestrian bridge leading to the exhibits, a shuttle bus line ran from 2023 until the Don Mills site&#x27;s closure, bringing people from the main entrance to Level 6, the main exhibit area at the bottom of a ravine. The detour used Mercedes and Ford custom-built minibuses. No plans to rebuild or replace the decayed bridge had been announced by the time of the site closure.

On April 18, 2023, Premier Doug Ford announced the provincial government&#x27;s plan to demolish the Science Centre and relocate it to a new facility on Toronto&#x27;s waterfront, specifically the grounds of Ontario Place. This announcements was met with widespread public backlash. Concerns centred on potential downsizing and exhibit losses due to space constraints, as well as the possible renaming of Line 5 Eglinton&#x27;s yet-to-open Science Centre station. Both the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario and the Toronto Society of Architects condemned the relocation plans, while the grassroots group Save Ontario&#x27;s Science Centre organized rallies and letter-writing campaigns to reverse the government&#x27;s decision. Toronto City Council also sought ways to maintain the Science Centre at its original location. 

In December 2023, the Auditor General of Ontario concluded that the government&#x27;s decision &quot;was not fully informed and based on preliminary and incomplete costing information, and had proceeded without full consultation from key stakeholders or a clear plan for the existing site&quot;.

On June 21, 2024, the Ministry of Infrastructure announced the immediate closure of the Don Mills location, citing an engineering report revealing water damage affecting 2-6% of the building&#x27;s roofs. The report estimated that repairs would cost at least $22 million and take two years to complete. Safety concerns about the roof material in question, reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC), had caused the temporary or permanent closure of hundreds of buildings in the United Kingdom in 2023. While roughly 400 public buildings in Ontario contain RAAC, the Science Centre is currently the only one in the province closed due to these concerns.

Instead of pursuing repairs, the Ford government expedited its plan to relocate the Science Centre to the waterfront, targeting a 2028 opening, with a temporary location slated for January 2026. This drew further criticism, including from Moriyama Teshima Architects, the firm founded by the Science Centre&#x27;s designer. Private donors, including Geoffrey Hinton, offered up to $1 million to fund the repairs of the existing facility, but the province has not responded to these offers.

By October 31, 2024, most of the exhibits had been moved to storage facilities in Northern Toronto and Guelph, while animals and plants had been transferred to the Toronto Zoo and The Village at Black Creek. Temporary pop-up exhibits have since opened at Sherway Gardens and Toronto&#x27;s Harbourfront Centre. 

In December 2024, the Auditor General of Ontario questioned the financial prudence of the relocation. Contrary to the Ford government&#x27;s business plan analysis, which projected $257 million in savings over 50 years, the AG found that relocation costs have already exceeded those anticipated savings, reaching approximately $400 million.

==Grounds==
=== Building ===

Designed in the early 1960s, the original buildings are of Brutalist designs The building complex is made up of three main buildings connected by a series of bridges and escalators set in a parkland of over {{convert|100|acre|order=flip}}.{{rp|78}} The buildings were constructed while avoiding removal or damage to the mature trees in the area, so that &quot;the buildings seem to fit naturally into their environment&quot;.{{rp|78}} They follow the natural contours of the Don River ravine, into which the Centre descends. Ontario&#x27;s only IMAX Dome theatre opened in 1996.

The Great Hall is an event venue at the Ontario Science Centre and is home to &quot;Cloud&quot;, a massive, computer-controlled kinetic sculpture by Toronto installation artist David Rokeby, which consists of an array of blue and transparent squares that rotate in various ways to simulate the three states of matter: solid, liquid and gas.

For most of the time since opening in 1969, the Science Centre has hosted a demonstration amateur radio station. Formerly located in the Hall of Space, the station has since been relocated to Level 4 of the Centre, next to the elevator. The station has the call sign &quot;VE3OSC&quot;, and licensed amateur radio operators volunteer there daily from 10 am to 3 pm.

===Plaza===

&quot;Lotic Meander&quot; by Stacy Levy is an outdoor installation in polished and blasted granite and cast glass set into the solar terrace of the Ontario Science Centre. The work depicts the patterns of water as it moves through a stream bed. In 2007, the Ontario Science Centre unveiled the Teluscape Exploration Plaza, providing several interactive exhibits adjacent to the science centre&#x27;s exterior main entrance.

====FUNtain Aquatic Play====

As originally built, the Science Centre had a large fountain area directly in front of the entranceway, located to create a traffic roundabout. The fountain virtually screened views of the building from the street, and provided cooling for the building.{{rp|78}} The original water fountain has been rejuvenated to provide a more welcoming and accessible entrance to the Science Centre. The new plaza, named &quot;Teluscape&quot;, was designed by Reich + Petch Architects and EDA Collaborative. It opened to the public on September 20, 2006, and is accessible 24 hours a day.

The new fountain is also a hydraulophone designed by installation artist Steve Mann. It is a hydraulic-action pipe organ which can be played by anyone walking into the space. Blocking the flow of any one of the 57 water jets in the fountain forces the water across to a corresponding organ pipe, where it makes a loud sound as the water is forced out through the speaking mouth of the pipe. The lowest 12 notes in each pipe division of the organ are visible as pipes arranged in a circle. The North Division consists of stopped &quot;hydrapasons&quot; (similar to diapasons but running on water rather than air), whereas the South Division pipes are open at both ends (sound emerges from the ends rather than from a mouth as with the North pipes). The North organ console consists of 12 water jets, whereas the south console consists of 45 water jets.

The organ is supplied with water from three Pentair pumps, supplying water at a rate of {{convert|130|gal/min}}, each by way of a {{convert|3|in|cm}} diameter water line. Air is supplied from three Ingersol Rand four-cylinder air compressors, each having a {{convert|25|hp}} motor. Since the instrument runs on both air and water, it may be regarded as a hybrid hydraulophone and pneumatophone, but because it is played by blocking water jets rather than air holes, it is principally a hydraulophone.

The fountain must be shut down and drained to avoid freezing damage during the cold season. On November 21, 2007, the aquatic play facility was temporarily switched from water operation to air operation, effectively becoming perhaps one of the first pneumatic-play facilities, where visitors can frolic in a fountain of air jets. In this mode of operation, the fountain becomes a wind instrument. The hydraulophone may not be operational during the winter months.

{{As of|2023}}, the hydraulophone has not been operational, due to algae buildup, leaks, and pump problems.

==Exhibitions==

The Science Centre has hosted many travelling exhibits since its opening. In 1982, the exhibition &quot;China: 7,000 Years of Discovery&quot; broke all attendance records and attracted more than 1.5 million visitors.

In 2003, the &quot;Strange Matter&quot; exhibition opened, and the &quot;Body Worlds 2&quot; exhibition attracted almost half a million visitors over five months when it came to the Centre in 2005. The exhibition &quot;Facing Mars&quot; ran in 2008. The Centre hosted &quot;Harry Potter: The Exhibition&quot;, a collection of props from the film series in 2010. &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s Workshop&quot; (2011) featured physical models of da Vinci&#x27;s inventions, built from drawings in his Codices. It also included interactive touch-screen digital reproductions of his Codices, the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. &quot;Circus: The Exhibition&quot; ran in 2012. &quot;Game On 2.0&quot;, a video game history exhibition, ran March 9 to September 2, 2013.

In June 2014, the Centre welcomed &quot;The Science of Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot;, which explores how advances in science and technology have revolutionized music. The exhibition features eight areas that comprise different interactive components, historical artifacts, informational walls, documentary videos and more. The exhibition was followed by &quot;In Knowledge We Trust&quot; (October 4 to December 7, 2014), which explored the role trust plays in making us willing to share or use the knowledge we receive.

During summer 2015, the Centre hosted &quot;MythBusters: The Explosive Exhibition&quot;, based on the popular television series &quot;MythBusters&quot;. On June 4, 2016, the Centre hosted a one-day exhibit promoting the Nintendo 3DS game &quot;&quot;, which also featured activities pertaining to the &quot;Kirby&quot; video game series and a visit by a performer in a full Kirby costume. In 2017, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Canada, the Centre opened the exhibition &quot;Canada 150: Discovery Way&quot;, featuring Canadian stories behind transformational inventions and innovations.

===Permanent galleries and exhibits===

The science centre has several hundred interactive and passive permanent exhibits, featuring geology, the science of nature (in the west wing), astronomical science, how to play music and technology in the south wing, human anatomy, communication and bias, and some miscellaneous artifacts of science.

====&quot;A Question of Truth&quot;====

&quot;A Question of Truth&quot; is an exhibit that explores the methodologies, biases, and beliefs of scientific research setup in 2000. The exhibit provides visitors an opportunity to test controversial theories.

====AstraZeneca Human Edge====

The AstraZeneca Human Edge replaced the original human anatomy gallery, opened in December 2013 with sponsorship from AstraZeneca. In addition to detailing anatomy, the exhibit explores the possibilities of the human body with activities to simulate the experiences of adventure-seekers, elite athletes, and extreme-sports enthusiasts. There are more than 80 exhibits in the hall, which were all developed and built by the Science Centre&#x27;s staff with input from more than 120 neuroscience, physiology, bio-mechanics and sports medicine experts. The exhibit also features a climbing wall.

====Cohon Family Nature Escape====
The Cohon Family Nature Escape is an outdoor exhibit, situated within the Don River valley to the rear of the science centre. The exhibit features a giant Baltimore oriole nest, concrete wall canvas for moss graffiti, and a playground slide made from a fallen 125-year-old eastern white pine.

====Forest Lane====
Forest Lane houses a number of trees and tree trunks from across Canada. The exhibit includes a 464-year-old Douglas fir, with markings on its growth rings denoting notable world events during the tree&#x27;s lifetime.

====KidSpark====

KidSpark is a designated space for children eight and under to explore and learn through play. The exhibition was opened in 2003. The exhibition also has a rolling ball machine built by George Rhoads, and a music studio.

====Living Earth====

The Living Earth hosts simulated environments around the world, including rainforests, coral reefs, and caves, including live animals. It was opened in 1993.

====Science Arcade====
The Science Arcade is amongst the oldest exhibits at the science centre, having been a permanent fixture in the building since its opening in 1969. The Science Arcade houses a number of &quot;arcade-styled&quot; games.

====Space Hall and the Planetarium====
The Space Hall was refurbished in the late 2000s and features meteorites from Mars and one of the few Moon rocks on public display in Canada. The Ontario Science Centre also holds Toronto&#x27;s only operating public planetarium, since McLaughlin Planetarium was closed in 1995.

====Weston Family Innovation Centre====

The Weston Family Innovation Centre is an exhibit designed to encourage experimentation, and features exhibits that allow visitors to prototype a new type of shoe, and to test their aviation abilities. The Weston Family Innovation Centre houses &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; by Bruce Shapiro, a bubble art installation.

====Gallery====
==Science School==
The Ontario Science Centre Science School (OSCSS) offers grade 12 University Preparation courses in STEM subjects: physics, biology, chemistry, calculus, and advanced functions. All students also complete an interdisciplinary studies credit in science communication while enrolled with the OSCSS. The credits are issued by either the Toronto District School Board or the Toronto Catholic District School Board, which also fund the program so it is available at no cost to students from anywhere in Ontario. While at the Science Centre, students earn practicum hours through volunteering and interacting with visitors.

== Governance ==
As a Crown agency (Crown corporation) of the Government of Ontario, the Ontario Science Centre is overseen by trustees appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, who selects not fewer than sixteen and not more than twenty-six trustees, and designates one of them as chair and another as vice-chair. Meetings are held four times a year, and trustees serve for a term not exceeding three years but may be reappointed for one or more terms.

==Affiliations==
The Ontario Science Centre is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association (CMA), Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN), and Virtual Museum of Canada. The Ontario Science Centre is a member of the international Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC).

==Cultural references==
Ontario Science Centre was used by David Cronenberg as a location for his 1970 film &quot;Crimes of the Future&quot;.

==Media==
Ontario Science Centre was featured on the &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot; in 2016. In his CBC news satire program, Rick Mercer visited numerous scientists&#x27; exhibits, took part in a wildlife conservation show, and partook in a psychological fear study during a workshop there.

<text>In-water recompression (IWR) or underwater oxygen treatment is the emergency treatment of decompression sickness (DCS) by returning the diver underwater to help the gas bubbles in the tissues, which are causing the symptoms, to resolve. It is a procedure that exposes the diver to significant risk which should be compared with the risk associated with the available options and balanced against the probable benefits. Some authorities recommend that it is only to be used when the time to travel to the nearest recompression chamber is too long to save the victim&#x27;s life; others take a more pragmatic approach and accept that in some circumstances IWR is the best available option. The risks may not be justified for case of mild symptoms likely to resolve spontaneously, or for cases where the diver is likely to be unsafe in the water, but in-water recompression may be justified in cases where severe outcomes are likely if not recompressed, if conducted by a competent and suitably equipped team.

Carrying out in-water recompression when there is a nearby recompression chamber or without suitable equipment and training is never a desirable option. The risk of the procedure is due to the diver suffering from DCS being seriously ill and may become paralysed, unconscious, or stop breathing while underwater. Any one of these events is likely to result in the diver drowning or asphyxiating or suffering further injury during a subsequent rescue to the surface. This risk can be reduced by improving airway security by using surface supplied gas and a helmet or full-face mask. Risk of injury during emergency surfacing is minimised by treatment on 100% oxygen, which is also the only gas with a reliable record of positive outcomes. Early recompression on oxygen has a high rate of complete resolution of symptoms, even for shallower and shorter treatment than the highly successful US Navy Treatment Table 6.

Several schedules have been published for in-water recompression treatment, but little data on their efficacy is available. The Australian Navy tables and US Navy Tables may have the largest amount of empirical evidence supporting their efficacy.

== Background ==
Decompression sickness (DCS) is a medical condition caused by dissolved gases emerging from solution as bubbles inside the body tissues during decompression. DCS most commonly occurs during or soon after a decompression ascent from underwater diving DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness. Since bubbles can form in, or migrate to, any part of the body, DCS can produce many symptoms, and its effects may vary from joint pain and rashes to paralysis and death. Individual susceptibility can vary from day to day, and different individuals under the same conditions may be affected differently or not at all. The severity of symptoms varies from barely noticeable to rapidly fatal.

The risk of DCS caused by diving can be managed through proper decompression procedures, and contracting the condition has become uncommon. Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it, and divers almost universally use dive tables or dive computers to limit their exposure, to monitor their ascent speed, and to ensure theoretically adequate decompression stops. If DCS is suspected, it is treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber. Where a chamber is not accessible within a reasonable time frame, In-water recompression mat be indicated for a narrow range of presentations, if there are suitably skilled personnel and appropriate equipment available on site. Diagnosis is confirmed by a positive response to the treatment. Early treatment results in a significantly higher chance of successful recovery.

Treatment of DCS utilizing the US Navy Treatment Table 6 with oxygen at 18m or an equivalent alternative is a widely recognised standard of care. Ideally, treatment should take place in a chamber where there is no risk of drowning or hypothermia, and other medical problems can be managed conveniently. Significant delay to treatment, difficult transport, and facilities with limited experience may lead to consideration of on site treatment. Surface oxygen for first aid has been proven to improve the efficacy of recompression and decreased the number of recompression treatments required when administered within four hours post dive. IWR to 9 m breathing oxygen is one option that has shown success over the years IWR is not without risk and should be undertaken with certain precautions. IWR would only be suitable for an organised and disciplined group of divers with suitable equipment and practical training in the procedure.

The principle behind IWR treatment is the same as that behind the treatment of DCS in a recompression chamber: an increase in ambient pressure will reduce the volume of the bubbles allowing better blood transport downstream of the bubbles. If the casualty can breathe pure oxygen further improvements will occur because the increase in the proportion of oxygen in the blood may keep previously oxygen-starved tissues alive and the oxygen window will accelerate the removal of inert gases from the bubbles making the bubbles smaller. The unacceptable risks of oxygen toxicity convulsions can be reduced by recompressing to lower pressures and for shorter durations than otherwise preferred.

Experimental work on verification of decompression tables by the US Navy Experimental Diving Unit with outcomes of symptomatic decompression sickness treated divers displaying symptoms by immediate recompression on oxygen, with 100% resolution of symptoms, and almost all cases resolved during the first treatment on Table 6, most of them during repressurisation or within the first 10 minutes at treatment depth. During the experimental work of developing the standard US Navy treatment tables 5 and 6, some experimentation was done with shorter treatment to shallower depths before standardising on 60 fsw (18 msw). This included immediate recompression on oxygen to 33 fsw (10 msw) for 30 minutes, which provided complete resolution in the majority of cases, but was not as effective as the full Table 6. Compression to 60 fsw (18 msw) would follow if symptoms did not resolve during initial treatment at 33 fsw. This previously unpublished data indicates that immediate recompression on oxygen to shallower depths for shorter periods does positively affect the probable long term outcome of decompression sickness, and compares favourably with outcomes for delayed hyperbaric treatment, and has been used as supporting evidence for new (2022) recommendations on in-water recompression. Outcomes for in-water recompression on other gas mixtures are mostly anecdotal and unsuitable for informing medical policy.(Mitchell et al. Sept 2022 in press)

The use of in-water oxygen at 6 meters has been shown to reduce bubble loads in divers compared to divers breathing oxygen on the surface.

== Risks ==
Any potential benefits of using IWR for earlier recompression should be balanced against the risks. These risks are well known, and their potential mitigations are fairly well understood.

The Royal Australian Navy School of Underwater Medicine was charged to supervise the then non-sanctioned practice of IWR, in response to the very long delays that often occurred between the presentation of DCS and recompression treatment. The issues identified include:

* Inappropriate cases for treatment,
* Oxygen toxicity,
* Emergency termination of treatment,
* Hypothermia
* Adequacy of equipment in remote areas,
* Seasickness,
* Operator expertise and training,
* Safety of the diving attendant and the boat tenders,
* Requirement for medical supervision,
* Transport availability,
* Misuse of equipment,
* Pulmonary barotrauma cases.
===Risk management===
In 2018, a group of diving medical experts issued a consensus guideline on pre-hospital decompression sickness management and concluded that IWR is only appropriate in groups that have been trained and are competent in the skills required for IWR and have appropriate equipment.

Mitigation of a CNS oxygen toxicity seizure focuses on protecting the airway to prevent drowning. A full-face mask or mouthpiece retaining strap is reasonably effective though not guaranteed. Tethering the diver to prevent sinking, and providing a safety diver to accompany the diver under treatment at all times, who can recover the diver to the surface immediately in the event of a seizure are also recommended, following the recommended procedures for recovery of a convulsing diver.

== Factors influencing a decision to use IWR ==
Recompression and hyperbaric oxygen administered in a recompression chamber are recognised as the definitive treatment for DCI, but when there is no readily available access to a suitable hyperbaric chamber, and if symptoms are significant or progressing, in-water recompression with oxygen is an option where a group of divers, including the symptomatic diver, already have the necessary equipment and relevant training and knowledge that provides a sufficient understanding of the associated risks to allow the involved parties to collectively accept responsibility for a decision to proceed with IWR.

The decision of whether or not to attempt IWR depends on identifying the diver whose condition is serious enough to justify the risk, but whose clinical condition does not indicate that the risk is unacceptable. The risk may not be justified for mild DCI, if spontaneous recovery is probable whether the diver is recompressed or not, and surface oxygen is indicated for these cases. However, in these cases the risk of the recompression is also low, and early abandonment is also unlikely to cause further harm. There are no firm guidelines regarding expected delay to access of a decompression chamber, but divers generally consider a predicted delay of more than 8 hours from symptom onset to be reason to consider in-water recompression.

=== Environmental conditions===
Water conditions, such as low temperature and rough sea state are relative contraindications, and the team must take these factors into account. Divers undergoing IWR risk becoming cold or hypothermic. They may already have done long dives in cold water, but the use of dry suits is common for such conditions, and the use of active heating systems in dry suit undergarments may be available. IWR requires a stable platform that can remain in one place for three hours. These factors should be considered when deciding whether to undertake IWR. Deteriorating condition of the diver or environmental conditions may make it necessary to abort or shorten treatment, or terminate it before full resolution. There is no known reason to assume that this would be inherently worse than not providing what treatment is possible at reasonable risk.

===Indications===
Indications are based on symptoms and signs of decompression illness where expected benefits are likely to outweigh risk. There is a tension between conditions serious enough to justify the risks and clinical states which indicate excessive risk. Risk may not be considered justified for cases where the symptoms suggest a spontaneous recovery is likely without recompression, although the actual risk in these cases is likely to be relatively low. As of 2018 there is no widely accepted method for objectively selecting divers suitable for in-water recompression, and although remote consultation with a diving medical practitioner is advised by the Doolette and Mitchell 2018 protocol, it is likely that remote advice will vary significantly depending on who is contacted and how willing they are to accept responsibility for giving advice on a procedure with which they may have little personal experience and for which there is no clear decision tree.

An attempt has been made to provide some structure to the decision process which can be useful to divers without medical training, by the technical diving certification organisation International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD), which in consultation with diving medical experts, produced a decision map for field use. The system relies entirely on gross observation, omitting a detailed neurological examination. It categorises symptoms into three &quot;tiers&quot;, which correspond roughly with perceived severity of DCI, and appropriateness of IWR in suitable conditions.

Tier 1 symptoms would not be severe enough to justify IWR, but would be monitored and discussed with a remote consultant. These are generally non-specific symptoms which may or may not be of DCI, and are not an immediate or significant threat, such as headache, lethargy, or nausea.

Tier 2 symptoms are severe enough to suggest IWR if they present soon after surfacing, or are progressive, but not necessarily if there is a delay of some hours and the symptoms are not progressive. IWR would be justified for tier 2 when it may prevent the development of more severe symptoms. These symptoms are likely to be of DCI, but are not likely to result in permanent injury or death if not treated. They include musculoskeletal pain, excepting symmetrical &quot;girdle pains&quot;, lymphatic obstruction with subcutaneous swelling, skin rashes and paraesthesias such as tingling.

Tier 3: symptoms are severe enough to justify IWR if there are no contraindications and the logistical requirements are in place. These symptoms and signs are likely to be of DCI and indicate a risk of permanent injury or death. Some of them are also contraindications to IWR. They include changes in state of consciousness, or obvious confusion, difficulty with speech, visual changes, disturbances in balance, obvious sensory loss (numbness), obvious weakness or paralysis, bladder dysfunction, (usually inability to urinate), bowel dysfunction, loss of limb coordination, shortness of breath, and bilaterally symmetrical girdle pains.

=== Contraindications ===
Symptoms of mild DCS have been described as being one or more of musculoskeletal pain, rash, subjective sensory change in a non-dermatomal distribution, and constitutional symptoms such as fatigue. Divers with only these symptoms could be adequately managed with surface oxygen, observation, and consultation with a diving physician. Exposing divers with stable mild symptoms to the risks of IWR might not be justified. In severe cases the diver may be so compromised that they could not safely endure the procedure. It may be difficult or impossible to reliably codify the decision process.

Some signs of decompression illness which suggest a risk of permanent injury are nevertheless considered contraindications for IWR. Hearing loss and vertigo displayed in isolation with no other symptoms of DCI can have been caused by inner ear barotrauma rather than DCI, and inner ear barotrauma is generally considered a contraindication for recompression. Even when caused by DCI, vertigo can make in-water treatment hazardous if accompanied by nausea and vomiting. A diver with a deteriorating level of consciousness or with a persisting reduced level of consciousness should also not be recompressed in-water nor should a diver who does not want to go back down, or with a history of oxygen toxicity in the preceding dives, altered level of consciousness, shock, respiratory distress, or any physical injury or incapacitation which may make the procedure unsafe. Suspected or confirmed cases of arterial gas embolism (AGE) are generally not considered suitable for IWR due to the high probability of loss of consciousness.

== Protocol ==
Recompression with hyperbaric oxygen administered in a recompression chamber is recognised as the standard of care for decompression sickness, but the infrastructure is expensive and may not be used very often, so many locations do not have convenient access to a suitable facility. If symptoms are significant or deteriorating, in-water recompression using oxygen is an option where groups of divers, including the symptomatic diver, have relevant prior training that allows an understanding of the associated risks and a collective informed acceptance of responsibility for the decision to proceed with treatment. Observational evidence has shown that very early recompression on oxygen usually results in good outcomes, or at least better outcomes than treatment after longer delays.

Recompression on air will initially produce a compression of existing bubbles, and may produce associated clinical improvement, but bubbles will dissolve more slowly due to the lower concentration gradient, and some tissues will absorb more nitrogen. Bubbles nor completely resolved will re-expand during decompression, and may take up more gas, which may cause symptoms to recur or get worse. There is also observational evidence that IWR on air is less effective, so only oxygen is recommended as a treatment gas.

The minimum team would comprise the symptomatic diver, a dive buddy to accompany the diver during the recompression, and a surface supervisor, who must all be competent at decompression procedures using 100% oxygen as the breathing gas.

The team should be suitably equipped with adequate thermal protection, an adequate oxygen supply, a means of delivering oxygen at or near 100% for the duration of both underwater and surface phases of the treatment, a means of voice or written communication, and a method of keeping the diver at the appropriate depth and maintaining position. A full-face mask or mouthpiece retaining strap is strongly recommended as there is observational evidence of these devices preventing drowning of an unconscious diver underwater. Surface supplied oxygen delivered to the casualty by umbilical or airline, and voice communication are desirable options as they allow the surface team members to keep control of the breathing gas supply and allow better monitoring of the diver&#x27;s condition. Positive pressure masks have been recommended for use with open circuit oxygen, as giving more secure protection of the airway, after their successful use in rescuing the trapped Tham Luang cave group while anaesthetised.

Although the IWR tables are shorter and shallower than most hyperbaric treatment tables, a substantial supply of oxygen is required. The US Navy Type 1 IWR table requires about of oxygen for a diver with a surface consumption rate of per minute, and the Type 2 table would use about . The rate of per minute may be optimistic if the diver is stressed due to injury, discomfort, or cold, or if some models of full-face mask are used.

Recognised IWR protocols include the &quot;Clipperton protocol&quot;, &quot;Australian method&quot;, and the US Navy method for in-water recompression on oxygen.

In-water recompression may not produce complete resolution of DCI, and signs or symptoms may recur. Any diver completing an in-water recompression should consult a diving medical practitioner as soon as reasonably practicable.

== In-water recompression tables ==
Six IWR treatment tables have been published in the scientific literature. Each of these methods have several commonalities including the use of a full face mask, a tender to supervise the diver during treatment, a weighted recompression line and a means of communication. The history of the three older methods for providing oxygen at 9 msw (30 fsw) was described in great detail by Pyle and Youngblood. The fourth method for providing oxygen at 7.5 msw (25 fsw) was described by Richard Pyle at the 48th Annual UHMS Workshop on In-water Recompression in 1999. The Clipperton method involves recompression to 9 msw (30 fsw) while the Clipperton(a) rebreather method involves initial recompression to 30 msw (98 fsw).

The treatment tables recommended for use in chambers are not suitable for in-water recompression as the oxygen partial pressures and the associated risk of oxygen toxicity are too high.
=== Australian in-water recompression table ===

The Australian IWR Tables were developed by the Royal Australian Navy in the 1960s in response to their need for treatment in remote locations far away from recompression chambers. It was the shallow portion of the table developed for recompression chamber use.

Initial recompression is to 30 fsw (9 msw). Oxygen is breathed during the entire treatment without any air breaks and is followed by alternating periods (12 hours) of oxygen and air breathing on the surface. Surfacing is at 4 minutes per fsw.

=== Clipperton in-water recompression tables ===
The Clipperton and Clipperton(a) methods were developed for use on a scientific expedition to the atoll of Clipperton, 1,300 km from the Mexican coast. The two versions are based on the equipment available for treatment with the Clipperton(a) table being designed for use with rebreathers.

Both methods begin with 10 minutes of surface oxygen. Recompression is to 30 fsw (9 msw) for the Clipperton IWR table, oxygen is then breathed for 60 minutes and while surfacing at 1 metre per minute without any air breaks. For the Clipperton(a) IWR table, descent is made to the initial treatment depth of 30 msw, maintaining a partial pressure of 1.4 ATA. and breathed at that depth for 10 minutes followed by ascent to 9 msw at 1 metre per minute. As near as possible to 100% oxygen is breathed at 9 msw for 30 minutes, followed by ascent to the surface at 1 metre per minute. Oxygen breathing on the surface for 6 hours post treatment and intravenous hydration fluids are also administered following both treatment tables.

=== Hawaiian in-water recompression table ===

The Hawaiian IWR table was first described by Farm et al. while studying the diving habits of Hawaii&#x27;s diving fishermen.

The initial portion of the treatment involves descent on air to the depth of relief plus 30 fsw or a maximum of 165 fsw for ten minutes. Ascent from initial treatment depth to 30 fsw occurs over 10 minutes. The diver then completes the treatment breathing oxygen and is followed by oxygen breathing on the surface for 30 minutes post treatment.

The Hawaiian IWR Table with Pyle modifications can be found in the proceedings of the DAN 2008 Technical Diving Conference. 

=== Pyle in-water recompression table ===

The Pyle IWR table was developed by Dr. Richard Pyle as a method for treating DCS in the field following scientific dives.

This method begins with a 10-minute surface oxygen evaluation period. Compression to 25 fsw on oxygen for another 10-minute evaluation period. The table is best described by the treatment algorithm. This table does include alternating air breathing periods or &quot;air breaks&quot;.

=== US Navy in-water recompression tables ===
The US Navy developed two IWR treatment tables. The table used depends on the symptoms diagnosed by the medical officer.

Oxygen is breathed the entire treatment without any air breaks and is followed by 3 hours of oxygen breathing on the surface.

=== IANTD in water recompression protocol ===
The International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD) has developed a specialized training program for technical divers to perform in-water therapeutic recompression. This procedure is designed for use in remote locations where hyperbaric chambers are not available. The program prepares divers to assess when conditions and equipment are appropriate, and when the diver&#x27;s condition warrants such emergency treatment. The protocol primarily involves breathing oxygen at a depth of 25 feet of seawater (7.5 meters), with scheduled air breaks to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity. This approach is intended to manage decompression sickness in extreme situations where conventional treatments are not accessible.

==Clinical significance==
In-water recompression is a clinically significant method to manage a global shortage of chamber availability for recreational, technical and scientific divers who often dive in places many hours, or days, from the nearest chamber. Minimal delay of recompression is directly related to improved outcomes, and probably to reduced mortality. Divers with the appropriate equipment and training can treat decompression sickness on-site. Such treatment may prevent long-term disability, and can reduce costs and risk to rescue personnel. In-water recompression is a viable alternative when safe and rapid transfer to a suitable recompression chamber is not practicable.

== &quot;Informal&quot; in-water recompression ==
Although in-water recompression is widely regarded as risky, and to be avoided, there is increasing evidence that technical divers who surface and demonstrate mild DCS symptoms may often get back into the water and breathe pure oxygen at a depth of for a period in an effort to alleviate the symptoms. Divers Alert Network&#x27;s 2008 accident report mentions this trend, and that although the reported incidents showed very little success, &quot;[w]e must recognize that these calls were mostly because the attempted IWR failed. In case the IWR were successful, [the] diver would not have called to report the event. Thus we do not know how often IWR may have been used successfully.&quot;

Historically, the pearl divers of Broome, Western Australia, used decompression tables developed from personal experience, and would return to depth if symptoms of DCI developed on surfacing. These dives and recompression were done on air, using standard diving dress, which provides relatively good airway security. Success was variable, but some divers were treated in this way on several occasions.

<text>The Strait of Georgia () or the Georgia Strait is an arm of the Salish Sea between Vancouver Island and the extreme southwestern mainland coast of British Columbia, Canada, and the extreme northwestern mainland coast of Washington, United States. It is approximately long and varies in width from . Along with the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound, it is a constituent part of the Salish Sea.

Archipelagos and narrow channels mark each end of the Strait of Georgia, the Gulf Islands and San Juan Islands in the south, and the Discovery Islands in the north. The main channels to the south are Boundary Pass, Haro Strait and Rosario Strait, which connect the Strait of Georgia to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. In the north, Discovery Passage is the main channel connecting the Strait of Georgia to Johnstone Strait. The strait is a major navigation channel on the west coast of North America, owing to the presence of the port of Vancouver, and also due to its role as the southern entrance to the Intracoastal route known as the Inside Passage.

== Geography ==
The United States Geological Survey defines the southern boundary of the Strait of Georgia as a line running from East Point on Saturna Island to Patos Island, Sucia Island, and Matia Island, then to Point Midgley on Lummi Island. This line touches the northern edges of Rosario Strait, which leads south to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Boundary Pass, which leads south to Haro Strait and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

The Strait of Georgia has a mean depth of and average surface area of . The Ballenas Basin in the centre of the strait reaches a maximum depth of approximately north of Nanaimo.

The Fraser River accounts for roughly 80 percent of the freshwater entering the strait. Water circulates in the strait in a generally counterclockwise direction.

===Major islands===
The strait contains several major islands, the largest by far being Texada Island at . Other major islands include Nelson Island, Denman Island, Lasqueti Island, and Hornby Island.

===&quot;Gulf of Georgia&quot;===
The term &quot;Gulf of Georgia&quot; includes waters other than the Georgia Strait proper, such as the inter-insular straits and channels of the Gulf Islands, and may refer to communities on the shore of southern Vancouver Island. As defined by George Vancouver in 1792, the Gulf of Georgia included all the inland waters beyond the eastern end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, including Puget Sound, Bellingham Bay, the waters around the San Juan Islands, as well as the Strait of Georgia.

==History==

First Nations communities have surrounded the Strait of Georgia for thousands of years. The first European exploration of the area was undertaken by Captain Jose Maria Narvaez and Pilot Juan Carrasco of Spain in 1791. At this time Francisco de Eliza gave the strait the name &quot;Gran Canal de Nuestra Señora del Rosario la Marinera.&quot;

In 1792, it was renamed for King George III as the &quot;Gulf of Georgia&quot; by George Vancouver of Great Britain, during his extensive expedition along the west coast of North America. Vancouver designated the mainland in this region as New Georgia and areas farther north as New Hanover and New Bremen.

The June 23, 1946, Vancouver Island earthquake shocked the Strait of Georgia region, causing the bottom of Deep Bay to sink between .

The two busiest routes of the BC Ferries system cross the strait, between Tsawwassen (south of Vancouver) and Swartz Bay (near Victoria) and between Horseshoe Bay (north of Vancouver) and Nanaimo.

The Strait of Georgia is known as a premier scuba diving and whale watching location.

In 1967, the Georgia Strait inspired the name of Vancouver&#x27;s alternative newspaper, &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot;, which has been published continuously since.

==Cities==
Towns and cities on the strait include Campbell River, Courtenay, Comox, Qualicum Beach, Parksville, Lantzville, and Nanaimo on the western shore, as well as Powell River, Sechelt, Gibsons, and Greater Vancouver on the east.

Across the border in the United States, Bellingham, Washington and other communities also lie on the eastern shore. Other settlements on Vancouver Island (such as Duncan) and the mainland are separated from Georgia Strait itself by islands and lesser straits but are often spoken of as being in the Strait of Georgia region.

== Transportation ==

BC Ferries operates ferry services connecting Vancouver Island with the mainland. Notable lines include Duke Point-Tsawwassen, Departure Bay-Horseshoe Bay, and Little River-Westview. Minor ferry operators and water taxis provide service to minor islands dotting the strait.

==Salish Sea==
In March 2008, the Chemainus First Nation proposed renaming the strait the &quot;Salish Sea&quot;, an idea that reportedly met with approval by B.C.&#x27;s Aboriginal Relations Minister Mike de Jong, who pledged to put it before the B.C. cabinet for discussion. Making the name &quot;Salish Sea&quot; official required a formal application to the Geographical Names Board of Canada. A parallel American movement promoting the name had a different definition, combining of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound as well as the Strait of Georgia and related waters under the name Salish Sea. This latter definition was made official in 2009 by geographic boards of Canada and the United States.

In October 2009, the Washington state Board of Geographic Names approved the Salish Sea toponym, not to replace the names of the Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and Strait of Juan de Fuca, but instead as a collective term for all three. The British Columbia Geographical Names Office passed a resolution recommending that the name only be adopted by the Geographical Names Board of Canada should its US counterpart approve the name change. The United States Board on Geographic Names approved the name on November 12, 2009 and Canada approved it in 2010.

<text>The Gulf Islands is a group of islands in the Salish Sea between Vancouver Island and the mainland coast of British Columbia.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Gulf Islands&quot; comes from &quot;Gulf of Georgia&quot;, the original term used by George Vancouver in his mapping of the southern part of the archipelago and which before the San Juan Island dispute also was taken to include what have since been called the San Juan Islands. While geopolitically divided, the San Juan Islands and Gulf Islands geologically form part of the larger Gulf Archipelago.

Strictly speaking, the Strait of Georgia is only the wide, open waters of the main strait between the mainland and Vancouver Island, and does not officially refer to the adjoining waters between the islands and Vancouver Island but has become a common misnomer for the entire Gulf, which includes waters such as Active Pass (between Galiano Island and Mayne Island), Trincomali Channel (between Galiano Island and Saltspring Island), Sansum Narrows (between Saltspring Island and Vancouver Island), and Malaspina Strait (between Texada Island and the mainland around Powell River). &quot;The Gulf&quot; refers to all such waters collectively, and to those communities and shores surrounding it. Only the term &quot;Strait of Georgia&quot; remains in the provincial gazette although its use as a synonym for the Gulf is unofficial, while the term Gulf of Georgia remains in current use though not in the provincial gazette.

The term Salish Sea was adopted in 2010 to refer to the Strait of Georgia, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, and all connecting and adjoining waters.

==Boundaries==
According to BC Geographical Names (BCGNIS) the name &quot;Gulf Islands&quot; was originally intended and commonly understood to refer to the archipelago at the southern end of the Strait of Georgia; from Gabriola Island in the north to Saturna Island in the southeast and D&#x27;Arcy Island in the southwest. During the 1990s, however, the name began to be applied to all the islands in the Strait of Georgia, resulting in the introduction of the term &quot;Southern Gulf Islands&quot;, which BCGNIS calls a misnomer, to distinguish the original &quot;Gulf Islands&quot; from the rest, which are sometimes called the &quot;Northern Gulf Islands&quot;. BCGNIS further notes that Quadra Island is increasingly described as the &quot;northernmost of the Gulf Islands&quot;.

==Island groups==
The division of the Gulf Islands into two groups, the Southern and Northern Gulf Islands, is relatively common. The dividing line is approximately that formed by the city of Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, and the mouth of the Fraser River on the mainland. The islands of the Discovery Islands, Howe Sound, and Fraser River delta are not considered part of the Gulf Islands.

=== Southern Gulf Islands ===

The Southern Gulf Islands are near the southern end of the Strait of Georgia, forming an intricate network of waterways between them, collectively referred to as part of the Salish Sea. The Southern Gulf Islands include hundreds of islands and islets, and form part of a larger archipelago that also includes the nearby San Juan Islands of the state of Washington in the United States.

The major Southern Gulf Islands are:
=== Northern Gulf Islands ===

The Northern Gulf Islands are located near the northern end of the Strait of Georgia, including all islands south of Savary Island, the southernmost island of the neighbouring Discovery Islands.

The major Northern Gulf Islands are as follows:
==Ecology==

The islands and surrounding ocean are rich with ecologically diverse plants and sea life including Garry oaks, wild lilies, kelp beds and Orcas.

The Gulf Islands are home to one of the last remaining pockets of Garry oak ecosystems. Only about five percent of Garry oak ecosystems remain in their natural state, landing 91 of the approximately 350 species it supports on the province&#x27;s list of species at risk. The unique Mediterranean characteristics of the islands&#x27; climate supports the Garry oak ecosystem. Garry oak ecosystems are home to more plant species, such as the camas, than any other terrestrial ecosystem in coastal B.C. and are one of Canada&#x27;s most at-risk natural habitats.

Today, Garry oak meadows exist in the shallow and exposed soil of valleys, rocky foothills and southern slopes—areas that the settlers of the past 150 years have found unsuitable for agriculture or development.

The Garry Oak Ecosystems Recovery Team (GOERT), a partnership of a number of governmental and non-governmental agencies that comprise 22 individuals, was established in 1999 after the delegates of the First International Garry Oak Ecosystem Symposium met in Victoria and declared the ecosystem endangered. Since then, GOERT has been working to motivate public and private restoration of the rare ecosystem and promote conservation activities. 

===Conservation===
The unique ecosystem of the islands has been a focal point of conservation efforts for decades. BC Parks operates a variety of provincial parks on the islands, the oldest being Mount Maxwell Provincial Park on Salt Spring Island.

In 2003, Parks Canada established Gulf Islands National Park Reserve to protect ecologically important regions of the southeastern Gulf Islands. As a National Park Reserve, the long-term goal is to protect most of the southeastern Gulf Islands.

In 2012, Parks Canada published a feasibility Study for the proposed Southern Strait of Georgia National Marine Conservation Area Reserve. The goal of the National Marine Conservation Area is to protect ecologically significant marine habitats and ensure sustainable use of marine resources. It would also serve as a complement to the existing national park reserve.

==Agriculture==

In most parts of Canada, olive trees cannot thrive; the long, harsh winter and short, humid summer and spring make it difficult for olives to grow comfortably and properly, but Pender Island, Saturna Island, and Salt Spring Island have a Mediterranean style climate that permits olive production.

Banana Joe Clemente was one of the first Islanders to introduce olive trees to the Southern Gulf Islands in 1993 growing dozens from seed. In 1994/1995, planting a grove of the seed-grown olive trees around a Botchi pit on Salt Spring Island. He also distributed them to Islanders for their private gardens. Banana Joe is also responsible for introducing &quot;Musa basjoo&quot;, a hardy species of Banana plant to Salt Spring Island.

Farm owner Andrew Butt planted his first olive tree in 2001 at his farm on Pender Island, using Frantoio and Leccino cultivars that he obtained from California. He uses kelp obtained from the surrounding straits as fertilizer and uses a pruning method that enhances the sunlight exposure on the trees. Michael Pierce and colleagues established an olive tree nursery on Saturna Island in 2009 that supplied olive trees to the region.

==Transportation==
The larger populated islands are served by BC Ferries, which operates various vehicle and passenger ferries between the Gulf Islands and to terminals near the major cities of Nanaimo and Victoria on Vancouver Island as well as Vancouver on the mainland.

None of the islands are linked to another island by bridge, the exception being Pender Island which was artificially divided into two by a canal dug in 1903. Various proposals have been made to link one or more of the islands to another island, or with the mainland coast of the province, without success. Challenges include high capital costs, the presence of ecologically sensitive ecosystems, the mountainous terrain of the islands, impracticality due to the low population of the islands, and opposition from locals.

<text>The Arizona Rangers are a non-commissioned civilian auxiliary that supports law enforcement in the state of Arizona.

In 2002, the modern-day Arizona Rangers were officially recognized by the State of Arizona when the Legislature passed Arizona Revised Statute (ARS) 41-4201 authorizing the Arizona Rangers to provide armed law enforcement assistance to any Local, State, Federal or Tribal law enforcement agency in Arizona, which was then signed into law by Governor Jane Hull amending ARS Title 41 – State Government. In addition, the Arizona Rangers are exempt from private security regulations under ARS 32-2606 authorizing the Rangers to provide armed public safety services for a variety of nonprofit organizations.

In 1901, the Arizona Rangers were created to rid the Arizona Territory of outlaws and corruption. At the time, the Territory was very dangerous. The United States Congress had denied the Governor&#x27;s application for Arizona to become a State in part because there was no law and order. The Rangers were well-trained, well-equipped, and very effective at apprehending even the most dangerous of outlaws, evolving into one of the finest law enforcement agencies in the country. Modeled after the Texas Rangers, the Arizona Rangers were tasked with hunting down and arresting outlaws in the Territory, especially along the Mexican border. By 1908, most of the outlaws had been arrested, killed, or had fled into Mexico. The Rangers were disbanded for political reasons in 1909. Shortly afterward, Arizona became the 48th state.

The Rangers were resurrected again in 1957 and continue to serve the State of Arizona today. They receive no governmental funding, with each Ranger paying for their own training and equipment.

Police departments often call in the Rangers to assist with tasks such as traffic control, surveillance, crime scene preservation, court security, and prisoner transportation. Each hour a Ranger donates allows those police officers extra time to protect each other and the communities they serve. For smaller agencies, the Rangers are a force multiplier and work alongside local law enforcement performing a variety of tasks. School Districts have called upon the Arizona Rangers to provide Resource Officers at several schools throughout the State. Arizona Rangers may exercise powers of arrest under ARS 13-3884, arrest by private person. However, while working certain duties (for example, court security and prisoner transportation) or at the direction and under the authority of requesting agencies, the Arizona Rangers do have full arrest authority.

In many circumstances, Rangers Train-to-Task to support the functions of a specific law enforcement duty, such as working with the railroad police. For example, the Tucson Company of the Arizona Rangers operates as an enhanced law enforcement assist group. Those Rangers complete additional training and physical conditioning and are then approved by the requesting agency to perform specialized support services, such as saturation patrol and second man in car while responding to calls for service.

==History==

===First Territorial Rangers===

The Territorial Governor created the Arizona Rangers in 1901. The Arizona Rangers were created to rid the territory of crime and corruption so Arizona could become a State. The Arizona Rangers are often confused with similar-sounding groups formed in the early 1860s; however, there is no connection. The first Territorial Rangers were organized to police the new gold boomtowns and mining camps in the western half of the New Mexico Territory that arose after the first gold strike in 1858 in Gila City.

===The Original Arizona Rangers===
Originally, only one company was authorized, consisting of a captain, a sergeant and not more than twelve privates, but, in 1903, the force was increased to twenty-six men. The Rangers, many of whom in the early years were veterans of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders, were skilled horsemen, trackers and marksmen. Though originally intended to be covert, the group became widely publicized and conspicuous, sported their badges boldly, and were distinctively well-armed.
In addition to dealing with rustlers, and other outlaws, the Rangers were called on to deal with several large strikes by Mexican workers at mines in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico. During the Cananea Riot in 1906, managers of the mine stampeded horses and fired shots into a crowd of striking Mexican miners, killing two. The Mexicans retaliated, burning a building with four Americans trapped inside. In response, and against the Governor&#x27;s orders, Captain Thomas H. Rynning joined a civilian posse of 275 men and rode to Cananea to assist Mexican Federal Troops and state mounted police. Tensions flared and shots were fired. When the smoke cleared, more than twenty-five men, both Mexican and American lay dead.

On February 15, 1909, the Arizona legislature repealed the act establishing the Arizona Rangers. During the seven years of its operations, 107 men served with the Rangers. The vote to disband was vetoed by Republican Governor Joseph Henry Kibbey, but the Democratic-dominated assembly overrode the veto, backed by political pressure from county sheriffs and district attorneys in northern Arizona.

After the Arizona Rangers disbanded, many of the former Rangers stayed in law enforcement. Harry C. Wheeler was elected sheriff of Cochise County and Thomas Rynning became the prison warden in Yuma, Arizona.

Seven former Rangers reunited in 1940 to ride together in the Prescott Rodeo Parade. In 1955, the Arizona legislature authorized a $100 monthly pension for former Rangers who had served at least six months and who still lived in Arizona. Five men qualified for this pension.

William MacLeod Raine wrote the following about crime in Arizona Territory and the effectiveness of the Arizona Rangers in a 1905 edition of Pearson&#x27;s Magazine:

===The Modern Arizona Rangers===
In 1957 a nonprofit organization called the Arizona Rangers was organized, founded with the assistance of four former members of the agency. The modern Arizona Rangers were officially recognized by the state of Arizona in 2002, when Arizona Governor Jane Hull signed Legislative Act 41-4201. The purpose of this act was &quot;to recognize the Arizona Rangers, who formed in 1901, disbanded in 1909 and reestablished in 1957 by original Arizona Rangers.&quot; The recognition by the State of Arizona gives no law enforcement authority to the organization. Members of the organization receive 24 hours of initial training and then ongoing monthly training. Rangers are required to qualify to Arizona Peace Officers Standard of Training (AZPOST) with their firearms, batons, Tasers, handcuffs, and OC spray.

The present-day Arizona Rangers are an unpaid, all-volunteer, law enforcement support and assistance civilian nonprofit organization in the state of Arizona. They fulfill a three-point mission: 1. Law Enforcement support, by working co-operatively at the request of and under the direction, control, and supervision of established law enforcement officials and officers; 2. Government and non-profit security services; and 3. Youth support and community services. All aspects of their mission preserve the tradition, honor, and history of the original Arizona Rangers.
The Rangers operate throughout the State of Arizona, but use about 22 Companies that operate semi-independently as local geography and community needs dictate while operating within the guidelines of a statewide organization. Each Company has a Captain who is a member of the Board of Governors and operationally reports to an Area Commander. So while there is only one Arizona Rangers organization, the Company Captains have latitude to make adjustments as to how their Company fulfills the mission in their local area.

When an applicant applies to become a Ranger, a full background investigation and a physical fitness test are performed to ensure qualified candidates are selected. When an applicant is accepted, they are placed on probation until they complete all requirements, which includes the Arizona Ranger Training Academy, a minimum of 24 hours of supervised duty with a field training officer, a minimum of 90 days on probation status, and meet any other requirements placed upon them by the company.

==Leadership==
The first captain of the Arizona Rangers was Burton C. Mossman of Bisbee, Arizona. Mossman, who had previously been manager of the Aztec Land and Cattle Company in northern Arizona, had some success in controlling rustling of his company&#x27;s cattle.

In July 1902, after successfully recruiting and organizing the original Rangers, Mossman resigned to return to ranching. He was replaced by Thomas H. Rynning. The third and last commander of the Arizona Rangers was Harry C. Wheeler.

In general, the men of the Arizona Rangers were extremely capable; their exploits were widely reported by the newspapers of the day. Many of these reports are collected in the book, &quot;The Arizona Rangers,&quot; edited by Joseph Miller.

==Uniforms and insignia==
Arizona Rangers were not issued standardized uniforms, as they were originally intended to operate undercover.

Badges of the Arizona Rangers, which were first issued in 1903 were solid silver five-pointed ball-tipped stars, lettered in blue enamel with engravings etched in blue, and are a valuable collectible. An officer&#x27;s badge was engraved with the Ranger&#x27;s name, while badges for enlisted men were numbered. Upon resignation, a Ranger returned his badge, which was then available to be assigned to a new Ranger.

==Similar agencies==
The Arizona Rangers had been preceded by the organization of the Arizona Territorial Rangers in 1860. This group was formed by the Provisional Territorial Government, principally to protect against Apache raids. The intent was to have three companies of Territorial Rangers, two were formed in the mining camp of Pinos Altos, known as the &quot;Arizona Guards&quot; and the &quot;Minute Men&quot;, and another, the &quot;Arizona Rangers&quot;, in Mesilla by Captain James Henry Tevis.

With the arrival of Baylor&#x27;s Confederate Army in Mesilla and his declaration of a Confederate Territory of Arizona in early 1862, the Arizona Territorial Rangers were disbanded by Captain Tevis who joined San Elizario Spy Company in the Confederate Army. The Confederate Territorial Governor, General Baylor eventually saw the need for the rangers also and formed Company A, Arizona Rangers as the first of three companies for the defense of Arizona Territory. It was commanded by Captain Sherod Hunter and Second Lieutenant James Henry Tevis. The Arizona Rangers were sent to Tucson to defend western Arizona Territory. When the California Column drove the Confederates out of Arizona Territory, plans for organizing the Arizona Rangers were put off for years.

In the early 1880s, Arizona was not only having an Indian war, but border crimes and killings were making Arizona unfit to live in. Upon taking office, Governor Frederick Augustus Tritle faced a problem of lawlessness within the territory caused by outlaw cowboys and hostile natives. On April 24, 1882, he authorized formation of the 1st Company of Arizona Rangers in Tombstone making John H. Jackson its captain. They were to be similar to Texas Rangers and combat outlaws and hostile Indians. His first assignment to the Rangers was to scout near the border of the territory for Indians, and for those who recently killed a teamster there. The Rangers Captain was only able to pay the first months wages, and the Governor despite his best efforts was never able to get them funded by the Territorial Legislature or Congress. On May 20, he wrote Johnston informing them they should continue until the end of the month when their pay ran out. Following the Earp Vendetta Ride and the departure of the Earps lawlessness in the area seems to have quieted.

The analogous agency in the Territory of New Mexico, organized in 1905, was called the New Mexico Mounted Patrol. Across the Mexican border in northern Sonora was a similar law enforcement agency called the Guardia Rural, colloquially known as the rurales. This group is often confused with another group often referred to with the same colloquialism, the Guardia Fiscal, which was commanded by a Russian, Colonel Emilio Kosterlitzky, who cooperated closely with the Rangers.

Another group known as the Arizona Rangers is based in Tucson and is part of Missouri Western Shooters.

==Popular culture==
&quot;The Arizona Ranger&quot;, a low-budget black-and-white film produced by RKO, was released in 1948, starring Jack Holt and his son Tim Holt.

In the 1976 film &quot;The Last Hard Men&quot;, actor Charlton Heston portrayed Captain Sam Burgade, a retired Captain of the Arizona Rangers who pursues the ruthless outlaw who has escaped from prison and kidnapped Burgade&#x27;s daughter for revenge. Burgade had been the arresting officer for the crime that sent the outlaw to prison.

An Arizona Ranger is featured in the song, &quot;Big Iron&quot;, in Western singer Marty Robbins&#x27; album &quot;Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs&quot;. The song was re-recorded by Johnny Cash in 2002 and later used in &quot;&quot;.

The television series &quot;26 Men&quot;, aired from 1957 to 1959, told the stories of the Arizona Rangers.

The Arizona Territorial Rangers Reenactment Group, headquartered in Netcong, New Jersey, is a historical reenactment group.

In the video for Toby Keith&#x27;s song, &quot;Beer For My Horses&quot;, Willie Nelson portrays a retired Arizona Ranger.

<text>Keith Goh () is a neurosurgeon from Singapore. Goh is known for his operations in separating conjoined twins with two known successful cases and a failed attempt in separating Ladan and Laleh Bijani.

== Career ==
In 2001, Goh had successfully led a surgical team in separating a set of conjoined twins. It was the first surgery on such separation of conjoined twins in Singapore.

In 2003, Goh was a consultant neurosurgeon at Raffles Hospital. In the same year, he led an international medical and surgical team and attempted to separate adult conjoined twins, Ladan and Laleh Bijani, who were joined at the head. The operation, carried out in Raffles Hospital, was unsuccessful leading to the deaths of the twins shortly after separation.

Shortly after the operation on the Bijani twins, Goh successfully led a team to separate a pair of conjoined twins, 4-month-old Korean girls who were joined at the base of their spine, on 22 July. The family of the Korean twins had consulted Goh before the Bijani twins and managed to raise funds for the operation shortly after the Bijani twins&#x27; operation.

As of 2004, Goh became an associate professor of neurosurgery at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

In 2009, he agreed to operate on another pair of conjoined twins, Vani and Veena, in India. The Indian government consented to fund the cost of the separation operation.

<doc id="508364" wikidata="Q452745" url="?curid=508364" title="E. C. Segar">
<text>Elzie Crisler Segar (; December 8, 1894 – October 13, 1938), known by the pen name E. C. Segar, was an American cartoonist. He created Popeye in 1929, introducing the character in his comic strip &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot;.

Charles M. Schulz said of Segar&#x27;s work: &quot;I think &quot;Popeye&quot; was a perfect comic strip, consistent in drawing and humor&quot;. Carl Barks described Segar as &quot;the&quot; unbridled genius as far as I was concerned&quot;.

==Early life==
Segar was born on December 8, 1894, and raised in Chester, Illinois, a small town near the Mississippi River. The son of Jewish parents Erma Irene (Crisler) and Amzi Andrews Segar, a handyman, his earliest work experiences included assisting his father in house painting and paper hanging. Skilled at playing drums, he also provided musical accompaniment to films and vaudeville acts in the local theater, where he was eventually given the job of film projectionist at the Chester Opera House, where he also did live performances. At age 18, he decided to become a cartoonist. He took a correspondence course in cartooning from W. L. Evans of Cleveland, Ohio. He said that after work he &quot;lit up the oil lamps about midnight and worked on the course until 3 a.m.&quot; During this time, Segar also began studying the work of cartoonists that he would later cite as influences on his work, including Rube Goldberg, George McManus and George Herriman (especially Herriman&#x27;s strip &quot;Stumble Inn&quot;).

Asked how to say his name, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; it was &quot;SEE-gar&quot;. He commonly signed his work simply Segar or E. Segar above a drawing of a cigar.

==Early work==
Segar moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he met Richard F. Outcault, the creator of &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot; and &quot;Buster Brown&quot;. Outcault encouraged him and introduced him at the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot;. On March 12, 1916, the &quot;Herald&quot; published Segar&#x27;s first comic, &quot;Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s Comic Capers&quot;, which ran for a little over a year. In 1917, Segar created &quot;Barry the Boob&quot;, about an incompetent soldier. Segar also originated two other, short-lived comics for the &quot;Herald&#x27;s&quot; Sunday magazine. These were &quot;The Mistakes of Mr. Muddle&quot; and the Rube Goldberg-inspired &quot;And They Get By With It&quot;. In 1918, he moved on to William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Chicago Evening American&quot;, for which he created &quot;Looping the Loop&quot; and worked as a second-string drama critic. &quot;Looping the Loop&quot; was a comic strip that gave a whimsical take on the events in Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Loop&quot; district. &quot;Looping the Loop&quot; made jokes about such issues as silent movies, plays, and the changing seasons; it proved popular with the &quot;Herald&#x27;s&quot; readers. Segar married Myrtle Johnson that year; they had two children. In October 1919, Segar covered that year&#x27;s World Series, creating eight cartoons for the sports pages.

==&quot;Thimble Theatre&quot;, &quot;Sappo&quot; and &quot;Popeye&quot;==

&quot;Evening American&quot; managing editor William Curley thought Segar could succeed in New York, so he sent him to King Features Syndicate, where Segar worked for many years. King Features asked Segar to create a comic strip to replace &quot;Midget Movies&quot; by Ed Wheelan, who had recently resigned from the syndicate. Segar created &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot; for the &quot;New York Journal&quot;, as the replacement for Wheelan&#x27;s strip. The &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot; strip made its debut on December 19, 1919, featuring the characters Olive Oyl, Castor Oyl and Harold Hamgravy, whose name was quickly shortened in the strip to simply &quot;Ham Gravy&quot;. They were the strip&#x27;s leads for about a decade. Segar began writing long storylines or &quot;continuities&quot; for &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot; in 1922. In these, the characters would have lengthy adventures in Africa and the Wild West. In one storyline, the characters encountered a superhuman &quot;tough guy&quot; named Harry Hardegg, who was able to break a moving buzz saw with his head. Comics historian Bill Blackbeard has described Harry Hardegg as a &quot;prototype&quot; for Popeye.
Segar also created &quot;The Five-Fifteen&quot; for King Features in 1920; it was retitled &quot;Sappo&quot; in 1926, although numerous newspapers had already retitled the strip &#x27;Sappo the Commuter&#x27; by 1924. &quot;The Five-Fifteen&quot; started its run as a Monday-through-Saturday strip, concluding its initial daily run in February 1925. In 1926, the strip, now officially retitled, was revived as a Sunday-only topper to the &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot; Sunday pages. Initially, this strip revolved about the exploits of suburban couple John and Myrtle Sappo. In May 1932, however, Segar introduced the eccentric scientist and inventor (and self-proclaimed &quot;genius&quot;) O.G. Wotasnozzle into the strip as a regular. Wotasnozzle&#x27;s bizarre machines soon became the focus of the strip, with John Sappo frequently cast as his test subject and straight man.

On January 17, 1929, when Castor Oyl needed a mariner to navigate his ship to Dice Island, Castor picked up a weatherbeaten sailor named Popeye in the docks. Popeye&#x27;s first line in the strip, upon being asked if he was a sailor, was &quot;&#x27;Ja think I&#x27;m a cowboy?&quot; It is believed Segar remembered a tough laborer named Frank &quot;Rocky&quot; Fiegel who was always getting in fights but also gave out candy and treats to children, including a young Segar. At first Segar intended Popeye to be a once-off character, but after large numbers of newspaper readers wrote in requesting the character&#x27;s return, Segar reintroduced Popeye as a full-time regular in August 1929, eventually enabling the sailor to become the focal point of the strip. Segar initially depicted Popeye as a quarrelling antihero. Segar&#x27;s storylines for the Popeye-focused &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot; drew on several fictional genres, including Westerns, pirate swashbucklers, Sports stories, and fantasy stories. Some of the other notable characters Segar created include J. Wellington Wimpy and Eugene the Jeep.

In 1929, Segar and his friend, screenwriter Norton S. Parker, began work on &quot;The Sea Hag&quot;, a prose novel for adults that would have featured both Popeye and the villainess the Sea Hag. However, King Features refused to grant Segar and Parker permission to publish the novel. &quot;The Sea Hag&quot; has never been put into print.

In 1934, King Features (noting the increasing popularity of the Popeye character with children) ordered Segar to tone down Popeye&#x27;s swearing and brawling. Although irritated by the order, Segar complied, and made Popeye more of a straightforward hero, more ubiquitously emphasizing his already-established affinity for aiding children and animals rather than his more violent and irascible tendencies, which persisted in a somewhat reduced form.
Segar continued to produce &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot;, published in five hundred newspapers globally by 1938, until his death. Beginning in 1933, Popeye was adapted into a series of cartoons by the Fleischer Studios, which increased the character&#x27;s already-ascendant popularity even further. Popeye was also licensed by King Features for hundreds of toys, games and other products. The commercial success of these products ensured King Features paid Segar highly for his work; by 1938, the syndicate was giving Segar a salary of $100,000 a year.

==Later life and death==
Segar later moved to Santa Monica, California. According to Bud Sagendorf, he lived near George Herriman. Although they admired each other&#x27;s work, they never visited each other in this period.
After a prolonged illness, Segar died of leukemia on October 13, 1938, aged 43 years old.

==Legacy and reprints==
Segar was among the first cartoonists to combine humorous situations with long-running adventures.

Comics creators who cited E.C. Segar&#x27;s work as an influence included Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, Boody Rogers, Charles M. Schulz, Carl Barks, Robert Crumb, and Stephen Hillenburg.

A revival of interest in Segar&#x27;s creations began with Woody Gelman&#x27;s Nostalgia Press. Robert Altman&#x27;s live-action film &quot;Popeye&quot; (1980) is adapted from E. C. Segar&#x27;s &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot; comic strip. The screenplay by Jules Feiffer was based directly on Gelman&#x27;s &quot;Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye the Sailor&quot;, a hardcover reprint collection of 1936–37 Segar strips published in 1971 by Nostalgia Press. In 2006, Fantagraphics published the first of a six-volume book set reprinting all &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot; daily and Sunday strips from 1928 to 1938, beginning with the adventure that introduced Popeye.

In 1971, the National Cartoonists Society created the Elzie Segar Award in his honor. According to the Society&#x27;s website, the award was &quot;presented to a person who has made a unique and outstanding contribution to the profession of cartooning.&quot; The NCS board of directors chose the first winners, while King Features selected recipients in later years. Honorees have included Charles Schulz, Bil Keane, Al Capp, Bill Gallo and Mort Walker. The award was discontinued in 1999.

In 2012, cartoonists Roger Langridge and Bruce Ozella teamed to revive the spirit of Segar in a 12-issue limited series, &quot;Popeye&quot;, published by IDW.

In 2018, Sunday Press Books published &quot;Thimble Theatre &amp; The Pre-Popeye Comics of E.C. Segar&quot;, collecting Segar&#x27;s early comic strip work, primarily the &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot; Sunday pages published between 1925 and 1930.

==Timeline==

==Popeye &amp; Friends Character Trail==
In 1977, Segar&#x27;s hometown of Chester, Illinois, named a park in his honor. The park contains a six-foot-tall bronze statue of Popeye. The annual Popeye Picnic, a weekend-long event that celebrates the character with a parade, film festival and other activities, is held the first weekend after Labor Day. In 2006, Chester launched the &quot;Popeye &amp; Friends Character Trail&quot;, which links a series of statues of Segar&#x27;s characters located throughout town. Each stands on a base inscribed with the names of donors who contributed to its cost and is unveiled and dedicated during the Popeye Picnic. The 2006 debut sculpture of hamburger-loving Wimpy stands in Gazebo Park. A statue of Olive Oyl, Swee&#x27;Pea and the Jeep, located near the Randolph County Courthouse, followed in 2007. In 2008, a Bluto statue was dedicated at the corner of Swanwick and W. Holmes Streets, in front of Buena Vista Bank. The 2009 statue of Castor Oyl and Bernice the Whiffle Hen stands in front of Chester Memorial Hospital. One additional statue has been unveiled each year.

Spinach Can Collectibles/Popeye Museum is located in the center of the city (Opera House).

On December 8, 2009, Google celebrated Segar&#x27;s 115th birthday with a Google Doodle of Popeye. The doodle used Popeye&#x27;s body as the &#x27;g&#x27;, had &#x27;oogl&#x27;, drawn to resemble Segar&#x27;s drawing style, and a spinach can as the &#x27;e&#x27;, and featured Popeye punching the &#x27;oogl&#x27; to cause the spinach to fly at him through the air.

<text>SOGo (formerly named Scalable OpenGroupware.org) is an open source collaborative software (groupware) server with a focus on simplicity and scalability.

SOGo provides collaboration for Mozilla Thunderbird/Lightning, Microsoft Outlook, Apple iCal/iPhone and BlackBerry client users. Its features include the ability to share calendars, address books and e-mail using an open source, cross-platform environment. The Funambol middleware and the Funambol SOGo Connector allow SyncML clients to synchronize contacts, events and tasks.

SOGo supports standard groupware capabilities including CalDAV, CalDAV auto-scheduling, CardDAV, WebDAV Sync, WebDAV ACLs, and iCalendar.

Microsoft Outlook support is provided through an OpenChange storage provider to remove the MAPI dependency for sharing address books, calendars and e-mails. Native connectivity to Microsoft Outlook allows SOGo to emulate a Microsoft Exchange server to Outlook clients.

==Features==

SOGo uses existing services including Microsoft Active Directory, OpenLDAP, SQL, and IMAP. Usage of industry services contributes to scalability. It is accessible through its web interface, desktop clients or mobile devices.

The web interface uses an AJAX interface and is available in several languages. The look and feel of version 2 mimics Mozilla Thunderbird and provides browser drag and drop capabilities for contacts, events and mail messages. Single sign-on security capabilities are available by using CAS, WebAuth, or Kerberos. Version 3 is based on AngularJS and Angular Material and provides a fully responsive interface.

Supported desktop clients are Mozilla Thunderbird with the Lightning extension, Apple iCal, and Microsoft Outlook. The SOGo Connector and Integrator extensions for Thunderbird provide improved functionality.

Mobile devices are generally handled through the Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) protocol. Devices such Apple&#x27;s iPhone are handled natively by SOGo as iOS supports CalDAV and CardDAV. Other devices can access the Web interface which is responsive since release 3.0.0.

==History==
The Skyrix Web Groupware was a web based calendaring, contact and project management system developed by the SKYRIX Software AG in Magdeburg, Germany (~1998-2008). It was based upon the SOPE application server (an open source derivate of WebObjects developed by the same company). That system was later released as an OpenSource project under the name &quot;OpenGroupware.org&quot;.
Even though the name was derived from the OpenOffice.org project, it had no actual ties to the OpenOffice project.

OpenGroupware.org was functionally rich but very limited in scalability (worked for hundreds of users). As part of a large customer project which had the requirement to serve around 60,000 users, &quot;Scalable OGo&quot; (&quot;SOGo&quot;) was created in 2004. &quot;SOGo&quot; lacks a lot of the functionality of OpenGroupware.org, but kept key calendaring, address book and email features. All designed to be highly scalable, and most importantly: to conform to open standards like CalDAV and GroupDAV.

The SKYRIX company eventually refocused on other endeavours. Inverse Inc picked up and continues to maintain and enhance SOGo, while adding a set of functionalities. Inverse, based in Canada, packaged and released version 1.0 of SOGo in 2009. In 2022, Inverse made a deal with Alinto.

<doc id="508376" wikidata="Q1401124" url="?curid=508376" title="Proto-Indo-European mythology">
<text>Proto-Indo-European mythology is the body of myths and deities associated with the Proto-Indo-Europeans, speakers of the hypothesized Proto-Indo-European language. Although the mythological motifs are not directly attested – since Proto-Indo-European speakers lived in preliterate societies – scholars of comparative mythology have reconstructed details from inherited similarities in mythological concepts found in Indo-European languages, based on the assumption that parts of the Proto-Indo-Europeans&#x27; original belief systems survived in the daughter traditions.

The Proto-Indo-European pantheon includes a number of securely reconstructed deities, since they are both cognates—linguistic siblings from a common origin—and associated with similar attributes and body of myths: such as , the daylight-sky god; his consort , the earth mother; his daughter , the dawn goddess; his sons the Divine Twins; and and , a solar deity and moon deity, respectively. Some deities, like the weather god or the herding-god , are only attested in a limited number of traditions—Western (i.e. European) and Graeco-Aryan, respectively—and could therefore represent late additions that did not spread throughout the various Indo-European dialects.

Some myths are also securely dated to Proto-Indo-European times, since they feature both linguistic and thematic evidence of an inherited motif: a story portraying a mythical figure associated with thunder and slaying a multi-headed serpent to release torrents of water that had previously been pent up; a creation myth involving two brothers, one of whom sacrifices the other in order to create the world; and probably the belief that the Otherworld was guarded by a watchdog and could only be reached by crossing a river.

Various schools of thought exist regarding possible interpretations of the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European mythology. The main mythologies used in comparative reconstruction are Indo-Iranian, Baltic, Roman, Norse, Celtic, Greek, Slavic, Hittite, Armenian, and Albanian.

==Methods of reconstruction==

===Schools of thought===
The mythology of the Proto-Indo-Europeans is not directly attested and it is difficult to match their language to archaeological findings related to any specific culture from the Chalcolithic. Nonetheless, scholars of comparative mythology have attempted to reconstruct aspects of Proto-Indo-European mythology based on the existence of linguistic and thematic similarities among the deities, religious practices, and myths of various Indo-European peoples. This method is known as the comparative method. Different schools of thought have approached the subject of Proto-Indo-European mythology from different angles.

The Meteorological or Naturist School holds that Proto-Indo-European myths initially emerged as explanations for natural phenomena, such as the Sky, the Sun, the Moon, and the Dawn. Rituals were therefore centered around the worship of those elemental deities. This interpretation was popular among early scholars, such as Friedrich Max Müller, who saw all myths as fundamentally solar allegories. Although recently revived by some scholars like Jean Haudry and Martin L. West, this school lost most of its scholarly support in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

The Ritual School, which first became prominent in the late nineteenth century, holds that Proto-Indo-European myths are best understood as stories invented to explain various rituals and religious practices. Scholars of the Ritual School argue that those rituals should be interpreted as attempts to manipulate the universe in order to obtain its favours. This interpretation reached the height of its popularity during the early twentieth century, and many of its most prominent early proponents, such as James George Frazer and Jane Ellen Harrison, were classical scholars. Bruce Lincoln, a contemporary member of the Ritual School, argues for instance that the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed that every sacrifice was a reenactment of the original sacrifice performed by the founder of the human race on his twin brother.

The Functionalist School, by contrast, holds that myths served as stories reinforcing social behaviours through the meta-narrative justification of a traditional order. Scholars of the Functionalist School were greatly influenced by the trifunctional system proposed by Georges Dumézil, which postulates a tripartite ideology reflected in a threefold division between a clerical class (encompassing both the religious and social functions of the priests and rulers), a warrior class (connected with the concepts of violence and bravery), and a class of farmers or husbandmen (associated with fertility and craftsmanship), on the basis that many historically known groups speaking Indo-European languages show such a division. Dumézil&#x27;s theory had a major influence on Indo-European studies from the mid-20th century onwards, and some scholars continue to operate under its framework, although it has also been criticized as aprioristic and too inclusive, and thus impossible to be proved or disproved.

The Structuralist School argues that Proto-Indo-European mythology was largely centered around the concept of dualistic opposition. They generally hold that the mental structure of all human beings is designed to set up opposing patterns in order to resolve conflicting elements. This approach tends to focus on cultural universals within the realm of mythology rather than the genetic origins of those myths, such as the fundamental and binary opposition rooted in the nature of marriage proposed by Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze and Vyacheslav Ivanov. It also offers refinements of the trifunctional system by highlighting the oppositional elements present within each function, such as the creative and destructive elements both found within the role of the warrior.

===Source mythologies===
One of the earliest attested and thus one of the most important of all Indo-European mythologies is Vedic mythology, especially the mythology of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, the oldest of the Vedas. Early scholars of comparative mythology such as Friedrich Max Müller stressed the importance of Vedic mythology to such an extent that they practically equated it with Proto-Indo-European myths. Modern researchers have been much more cautious, recognizing that, although Vedic mythology is still central, other mythologies must also be taken into account.

Another of the most important source mythologies for comparative research is Roman mythology. The Romans possessed a very complex mythological system, parts of which have been preserved through the characteristic Roman tendency to rationalize their myths into historical accounts. Despite its relatively late attestation, Norse mythology is still considered one of the three most important of the Indo-European mythologies for comparative research, due to the vast bulk of surviving Icelandic material.

Baltic mythology has also received a great deal of scholarly attention, as it is linguistically the most conservative and archaic of all surviving branches, but has so far remained frustrating to researchers because the sources are so comparatively late. Nonetheless, Latvian folk songs are seen as a major source of information in the process of reconstructing Proto-Indo-European myth. Despite the popularity of Greek mythology in western culture, Greek mythology is generally seen as having little importance in comparative mythology due to the heavy influence of Pre-Greek and Near Eastern cultures, which overwhelms what little Indo-European material can be extracted from it. Consequently, Greek mythology received minimal scholarly attention until the first decade of the 21st century.

Although Scythians are considered relatively conservative in regards to Proto-Indo-European cultures, retaining a similar lifestyle and culture, their mythology has very rarely been examined in an Indo-European context and infrequently discussed in regards to the nature of the ancestral Indo-European mythology. At least three deities, Tabiti, Papaios and Api, are generally interpreted as having Indo-European origins, while the remaining have seen more disparate interpretations. Influence from Siberian, Turkic and even Near Eastern beliefs, on the other hand, are more widely discussed in literature.

== Cosmology ==
There was a fundamental opposition between the never-aging gods dwelling above in the skies and the mortal humans living beneath on the earth. Earth () was perceived as a vast, flat and circular continent surrounded by waters (&quot;the Ocean&quot;). Although they may sometimes be identified with mythical figures or stories, the stars () were not bound to any particular cosmic significance and were perceived as ornamental more than anything else. According to Martin L. West, the idea of the world-tree (L. &quot;axis mundi&quot;) is probably a later import from North Asiatic cosmologies: &quot;The Greek myth might be derived from the Near East, and the Indic and Germanic ideas of a pillar from the shamanistic cosmologies of the Finno-Ugric and other peoples of central and northern Asia.&quot;

==== Reconstruction ====
There is no scholarly consensus as to which of the variants is the most accurate reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European cosmogonic myth. Bruce Lincoln&#x27;s reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European motif known as &quot;Twin and Man&quot; is supported by a number of scholars such as Jaan Puhvel, J. P. Mallory, Douglas Q. Adams, David W. Anthony, and, in part, Martin L. West. Although some thematic parallels can be made with traditions of the Ancient Near East, and even Polynesian or South American legends, Lincoln argues that the linguistic correspondences found in descendant cognates of and make it very likely that the myth has a Proto-Indo-European origin. According to Edgar C. Polomé, &quot;some elements of the [Scandinavian myth of Ymir] are distinctively Indo-European&quot;, but the reconstruction proposed by Lincoln &quot;makes too [many] unprovable assumptions to account for the fundamental changes implied by the Scandinavian version&quot;. David A. Leeming also notes that the concept of the Cosmic Egg, symbolizing the primordial state from which the universe arises, is found in many Indo-European creation myths.

==== Creation myth ====
Lincoln reconstructs a creation myth involving twin brothers, *&#x27; (&quot;Man&quot;) and *&#x27; (&quot;Twin&quot;), as the progenitors of the world and humankind, and a hero named &quot;*&quot; (&quot;Third&quot;) who ensured the continuity of the original sacrifice. Regarding the primordial state that may have preceded the creation process, West notes that the Vedic, Norse and, at least partially, the Greek traditions give evidence of an era when the cosmological elements were absent, with similar formulae insisting on their non-existence: &quot;neither non-being was nor being was at that time; there was not the air, nor the heaven beyond it&quot; (&quot;Rigveda&quot;), &quot;there was not sand nor sea nor the cool waves; earth was nowhere nor heaven above; Ginnungagap there was, but grass nowhere&quot; (&quot;Völuspá&quot;), &quot;there was Chasm and Night and dark Erebos at first, and broad Tartarus, but earth nor air nor heaven there was&quot; (&quot;The Birds&quot;).

In the creation myth, the first man and his giant twin are crossing the cosmos, accompanied by the primordial cow. To create the world, sacrifices his brother and, with the help of heavenly deities (the Sky-Father, the Storm-God and the Divine Twins), forges both the natural elements and human beings from his remains. thus becomes the first priest after initiating sacrifice as the primordial condition for the world order, and his deceased brother the first king as social classes emerge from his anatomy (priesthood from his head, the warrior class from his breast and arms, and the commoners from his sexual organs and legs). Although the European and Indo-Iranian versions differ on this matter, Lincoln argues that the primeval cow was most likely sacrificed in the original myth, giving birth to the other animals and vegetables, since the pastoral way of life of Proto-Indo-Iranian speakers was closer to that of Proto-Indo-European speakers. To the third man , the celestial gods then offer cattle as a divine gift, which is stolen by a three-headed serpent named (&quot;serpent&quot;). first suffers at his hands, but the hero eventually manages to overcome the monster, fortified by an intoxicating drink and aided by the Sky-Father. He eventually gives the recovered cattle back to a priest for it to be properly sacrificed. is now the first warrior, maintaining through his heroic actions the cycle of mutual giving between gods and mortals.

==== Interpretations ====
According to Lincoln, and seem to be the protagonists of &quot;a myth of the sovereign function, establishing the model for later priests and kings&quot;, while the legend of should be interpreted as &quot;a myth of the warrior function, establishing the model for all later men of arms&quot;. The myth indeed recalls the Dumézilian tripartition of the cosmos between the priest (in both his magical and legal aspects), the warrior (the Third Man), and the herder (the cow).

The story of served as a model for later cattle raiding epic myths and most likely as a moral justification for the practice of raiding among Indo-European peoples. In the original legend, is only taking back what rightfully belongs to his people, those who sacrifice properly to the gods. The myth has been interpreted either as a cosmic conflict between the heavenly hero and the earthly serpent, or as an Indo-European victory over non-Indo-European people, the monster symbolizing the aboriginal thief or usurper.

Some scholars have proposed that the primeval being was depicted as a two-fold hermaphrodite rather than a twin brother of , both forming indeed a pair of complementary beings entwined together. The Germanic names &quot;Ymir&quot; and &quot;Tuisto&quot; were understood as &quot;twin&quot;, &quot;bisexual&quot; or &quot;hermaphrodite&quot;, and some myths give a sister to the Vedic Yama, also called &quot;Twin&quot; and with whom incest is discussed. In this interpretation, the primordial being may have self-sacrificed, or have been divided in two, a male half and a female half, embodying a prototypal separation of the sexes.

==== Legacy ====
 Cognates deriving from the Proto-Indo-European First Priest (&quot;Man&quot;, &quot;ancestor of mankind&quot;) include the Indic Manu, legendary first man in Hinduism, and Manāvī, his sacrificed wife; the Germanic Mannus (), mythical ancestor of the West Germanic tribes; and the Persian Manūščihr (from Aves. &quot;Manūš.čiθra&quot;), a Zoroastrian high priest of the 9th century AD. From the name of the sacrificed First King (&quot;Twin&quot;) derive the Indic Yama, god of death and the underworld; the Avestan Yima, king of the golden age and guardian of hell; the Norse Ymir (from PGmc. ), ancestor of the giants (&quot;jötnar&quot;); and, most likely, Remus (from Proto-Latin &quot;*Yemos&quot; or &quot;*Yemonos&quot;, with the initial &quot;y&quot;- shifting to &quot;r&quot;- under the influence of &quot;Rōmulus&quot;), killed in the Roman foundation myth by his twin brother Romulus. Cognates stemming from the First Warrior (&quot;Third&quot;) include the Vedic Trita, the Avestan Thrita, and the Norse þriði.

Many Indo-European beliefs explain the origin of natural elements as the result of the original dismemberment of : his flesh usually becomes the earth, his hair grass, his bone yields stone, his blood water, his eyes the sun, his mind the moon, his brain the clouds, his breath the wind, and his head the heavens. The traditions of sacrificing an animal to disperse its parts according to socially established patterns, a custom found in Ancient Rome and India, has been interpreted as an attempt to restore the balance of the cosmos ruled by the original sacrifice.

The motif of and has been influential throughout Eurasia following the Indo-European migrations. The Greek, Old Russian (&quot;Poem on the Dove King&quot;) and Jewish versions depend on the Iranian, and a Chinese version of the myth has been introduced from Ancient India. The Armenian version of the myth of the First Warrior depends on the Iranian, and the Roman reflexes were influenced by earlier Greek versions.

=== Cosmic order ===
Linguistic evidence has led scholars to reconstruct the concept of , denoting &#x27;what is fitting, rightly ordered&#x27;, and ultimately deriving from the verbal root , &#x27;to fit&#x27;. Descendant cognates include Hittite &quot;āra&quot; (&#x27;right, proper&#x27;); Sanskrit (&#x27;divine/cosmic law, force of truth, or order&#x27;); Avestan &quot;arəta-&quot; (&#x27;order&#x27;); Greek &quot;artús&quot; (&#x27;arrangement&#x27;), possibly &quot;arete&quot; (&#x27;excellence&#x27;) via the root (&#x27;please, satisfy&#x27;); Latin &quot;artus&quot; (&#x27;joint&#x27;); Tocharian A &quot;ārtt-&quot; (&#x27;to praise, be pleased with&#x27;); Armenian &quot;ard&quot; (&#x27;ornament, shape&#x27;); Middle High German &quot;art&quot; (&#x27;innate feature, nature, fashion&#x27;).

Interwoven with the root (&#x27;to fit&#x27;) is the verbal root , which means &#x27;to put, lay down, establish&#x27;, but also &#x27;speak, say; bring back&#x27;. The Greek &quot;thémis&quot; and the Sanskrit both derive from the PIE noun for the &#x27;Law&#x27;, , literally &#x27;that which is established&#x27;. This notion of &#x27;Law&#x27; includes an &quot;active&quot; principle, denoting an &quot;activity&quot; &quot;in obedience&quot; to the cosmic order , which in a social context is interpreted as a &quot;lawful conduct&quot;: in the Greek daughter culture, the titaness Themis personifies the cosmic order and the rules of lawful conduct which derived from it, and the Vedic code of lawful conduct, the , can also be traced back to the PIE root . According to Martin L. West, the root also denotes a divine or cosmic creation, as attested by the Hittite expression &quot;nēbis dēgan dāir&quot; (&quot;established heaven (and) earth&quot;), the Young Avestan formula &quot;kə huvāpå raocåscā dāt təmåscā?&quot; (&quot;What skilful artificer made the regions of light and dark?&quot;), the name of the Vedic creator god , and possibly by the Greek nymph &quot;Thetis&quot;, presented as a demiurgical goddess in Alcman&#x27;s poetry.

Another root appears to be connected with ritualistic laws, as suggested by the Latin &quot;iūs&quot; (&#x27;law, right, justice, duty&#x27;), Avestan &quot;yaož-dā-&quot; (&#x27;make ritually pure&#x27;), and Sanskrit (&#x27;health and happiness&#x27;), with a derived adjective seen in Old Irish &quot;uisse&quot; (&#x27;just right, fitting&#x27;) and possibly Old Church Slavonic &quot;istǔ&quot; (&#x27;actual, true&#x27;).

===Otherworld===
The realm of death was generally depicted as the Lower Darkness and the land of no return. Many Indo-European myths relate a journey across a river, guided by an old man (), in order to reach the Otherworld. The Greek tradition of the dead being ferried across the river Styx by Charon is probably a reflex of this belief, and the idea of crossing a river to reach the Underworld is also present throughout Celtic mythologies. Several Vedic texts contain references to crossing a river (the ) in order to reach the land of the dead, and the Latin word &quot;tarentum&quot; (&quot;tomb&quot;) originally meant &quot;crossing point&quot;. In Norse mythology, Hermóðr must cross a bridge over the river Giöll in order to reach Hel and, in Latvian folk songs, the dead must cross a marsh rather than a river. Traditions of placing coins on the bodies of the deceased in order to pay the ferryman are attested in both ancient Greek and early modern Slavic funerary practices; although the earliest coins date to the Iron Age, this may provide evidence of an ancient tradition of giving offerings to the ferryman.

In a recurrent motif, the Otherworld contains a gate, generally guarded by a multi-headed (sometimes multi-eyed) dog who could also serve as a guide and ensured that the ones who entered could not get out. The Greek Cerberus and the Hindu most likely derive from the common noun (&quot;spotted&quot;). Bruce Lincoln has proposed a third cognate in the Norse Garmr, although this has been debated as linguistically untenable.

=== Eschatology ===
Several traditions reveal traces of a Proto-Indo-European eschatological myth that describes the end of the world following a cataclysmic battle. The story begins when an archdemon, usually coming from a different and inimical paternal line, assumes the position of authority among the community of the gods or heroes (Norse Loki, Roman Tarquin, Irish Bres). The subjects are treated unjustly by the new ruler, forced to erect fortifications while the archdemon instead favors outsiders, on whom his support relies. After a particularly heinous act, the archdemon is exiled by his subjects and takes refuge among his foreign relatives. A new leader (Norse &quot;Víðarr&quot;, Roman &quot;Lucius Brutus&quot;, Irish &quot;Lug&quot;), known as the &quot;silent one&quot; and usually the nephew or grandson () of the exiled archdemon, then springs up, and the two forces come together to annihilate each other in a cataclysmic battle. The myth ends with the interruption of the cosmic order and the conclusion of a temporal cyclic era. In the Norse and Iranian traditions, a cataclysmic &quot;cosmic winter&quot; precedes the final battle.

=== Other propositions ===
In the cosmological model proposed by Jean Haudry, the Proto-Indo-European sky is composed of three &quot;heavens&quot; (diurnal, nocturnal and liminal) rotating around an &quot;axis mundi&quot;, each having its own deities, social associations and colors (white, dark and red, respectively). Deities of the diurnal sky could not transgress the domain of the nocturnal sky, inhabited by its own sets of gods and by the spirits of the dead. For instance, Zeus cannot extend his power to the nightly sky in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. In this vision, the liminal or transitional sky embodies the gate or frontier (dawn and twilight) binding the two other heavens.

Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed that the peripheral part of the Earth was inhabited by a people exempt from the hardships and pains that arise from the human condition. The common motif is suggested by the legends of the Indic (&quot;White Island&quot;), whose inhabitants shine white like the Moon and need no food; the Greek &quot;Hyperborea&quot; (&quot;Beyond the North Wind&quot;), where the Sun shines all the time and the men know &quot;neither disease nor bitter old age&quot;; the Irish &quot;Tír na nÓg&quot; (&quot;Land of the Young&quot;), a mythical region located in the western sea where &quot;happiness lasts forever and there is no satiety&quot;; or the Germanic &quot;Ódáinsakr&quot; (&quot;Glittering Plains&quot;), a land situated beyond the Ocean where &quot;no one is permitted to die&quot;.

== Deities ==
The archaic Proto-Indo-European language (4500–4000) had a two-gender system which originally distinguished words between animate and inanimate, a system used to separate a common term from its deified synonym. For instance, &quot;fire&quot; as an active principle was (Latin &quot;ignis&quot;; Sanskrit &quot;Agní&quot;), while the inanimate, physical entity was (Greek &quot;pyr&quot;; English &quot;fire&quot;). During this period, Proto-Indo-European beliefs were still animistic and their language did not yet make formal distinctions between masculine and feminine, although it is likely that each deity was already conceived as either male or female. Most of the goddesses attested in later Indo-European mythologies come from pre-Indo-European deities eventually assimilated into the various pantheons following the migrations, like the Greek Athena, the Roman Juno, the Irish Medb, or the Iranian Anahita. Diversely personified, they were frequently seen as fulfilling multiple functions, while Proto-Indo-European goddesses shared a lack of personification and narrow functionalities as a general characteristic. The most well-attested female Indo-European deities include , the Dawn, , the Earth, and , the Sun.

It is not probable that the Proto-Indo-Europeans had a fixed canon of deities or assigned a specific number to them. The term for &quot;a god&quot; was (&quot;celestial&quot;), derived from the root , which denoted the bright sky or the light of day. It has numerous reflexes in Latin &quot;deus,&quot; Old Norse Týr (&lt; PGmc. ), Sanskrit , Avestan &quot;daeva,&quot; Irish &quot;día,&quot; or Lithuanian &quot;Dievas&quot;. In contrast, human beings were synonymous of &quot;mortals&quot; and associated with the &quot;earthly&quot; (), likewise the source of words for &quot;man, human being&quot; in various languages. Proto-Indo-Europeans believed the gods to be exempt from death and disease because they were nourished by special aliments, usually not available to mortals: in the , &quot;the gods, of course, neither eat nor drink. They become sated by just looking at this nectar&quot;, while the Edda states that &quot;on wine alone the weapon-lord Odin ever lives ... he needs no food; wine is to him both drink and meat&quot;. Sometimes concepts could also be deified, such as the Avestan &quot;mazdā&quot; (&quot;wisdom&quot;), worshipped as Ahura Mazdā (&quot;Lord Wisdom&quot;); the Greek god of war Ares (connected with ἀρή, &quot;ruin, destruction&quot;); or the Vedic protector of treaties Mitráh (from , &quot;contract&quot;).

Gods had several titles, typically &quot;the celebrated&quot;, &quot;the highest&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, or &quot;shepherd&quot;, with the notion that deities had their own idiom and true names which might be kept secret from mortals in some circumstances. In Indo-European traditions, gods were seen as the &quot;dispensers&quot; or the &quot;givers of good things&quot; (). Although certain individual deities were charged with the supervision of justice or contracts, in general the Indo-European gods did not have an ethical character. Their immense power, which they could exercise at their pleasure, necessitated rituals, sacrifices and praise songs from worshipers to ensure they would in return bestow prosperity to the community. The idea that gods were in control of the nature was translated in the suffix (feminine ), which signified &quot;lord of&quot;. According to West, it is attested in Greek Ouranos (&quot;lord of rain&quot;) and Helena (&quot;mistress of sunlight&quot;), Germanic (&quot;lord of frenzy&quot;), Gaulish Epona (&quot;goddess of horses&quot;), Lithuanian Perkūnas (&quot;lord of oaks&quot;), and in Roman Neptunus (&quot;lord of waters&quot;), Volcanus (&quot;lord of fire-glare&quot;) and Silvanus (&quot;lord of woods&quot;).

==Pantheon==
Linguists have been able to reconstruct the names of some deities in the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) from many types of sources. Some of the proposed deity names are more readily accepted among scholars than others. According to philologist Martin L. West, &quot;the clearest cases are the cosmic and elemental deities: the Sky-god, his partner Earth, and his twin sons; the Sun, the Sun Maiden, and the Dawn; gods of storm, wind, water, fire; and terrestrial presences such as the Rivers, spring and forest nymphs, and a god of the wild who guards roads and herds&quot;.

=== Genealogy ===
The most securely reconstructed genealogy of the Proto-Indo-European gods (&quot;Götterfamilie&quot;) is given as follows:





=== Heavenly deities ===

====Sky Father====

The head deity of the Proto-Indo-European pantheon was the god , whose name literally means &quot;Sky Father&quot;.&#x27; Regarded as the Sky or Day conceived as a divine entity, and thus the dwelling of the gods, the Heaven,&#x27; Dyēws is, by far, the most well-attested of all the Proto-Indo-European deities. As the gateway to the gods and the father of both the Divine Twins and the goddess of the dawn (Hausos), Dyēws was a prominent deity in the pantheon. He was however likely not their ruler, or the holder of the supreme power like Zeus and Jupiter.

Due to his celestial nature, Dyēus is often described as &quot;all-seeing&quot;, or &quot;with wide vision&quot; in Indo-European myths. It is unlikely however that he was in charge of the supervision of justice and righteousness, as it was the case for the Zeus or the Indo-Iranian Mithra–Varuna duo; but he was suited to serve at least as a witness to oaths and treaties.

The Greek god Zeus and the Roman god Jupiter both appear as the head gods of their respective pantheons. is also attested in the as , a minor ancestor figure mentioned in only a few hymns, and in the Illyrian god Dei-Pátrous, attested once by Hesychius of Alexandria. The ritual expressions &quot;Debess tēvs&quot; in Latvian and &quot;attas Isanus&quot; in Hittite are not exact descendants of the formula , but they do preserve its original structure.

====Dawn Goddess====

 has been reconstructed as the Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn. In three traditions (Indic, Greek, Baltic), the Dawn is the &quot;daughter of heaven&quot;, . In these three branches plus a fourth (Italic), the reluctant dawn-goddess is chased or beaten from the scene for tarrying. An ancient epithet designating the Dawn appears to have been , &quot;Sky Daughter&quot;. Depicted as opening the gates of Heaven when she appears at the beginning of the day, Hausōs is generally seen as never-ageing or born again each morning. Associated with red or golden cloths, she is often portrayed as dancing.

Twenty-one hymns in the Rigveda are dedicated to the dawn goddess and a single passage from the Avesta honors the dawn goddess Ušå. The dawn goddess Eos appears prominently in early Greek poetry and mythology. The Roman dawn goddess Aurora is a reflection of the Greek Eos, but the original Roman dawn goddess may have continued to be worshipped under the cultic title Mater Matuta. The Anglo-Saxons worshipped the goddess Ēostre, who was associated with a festival in spring which later gave its name to a month, which gave its name to the Christian holiday of Easter in English. The name &quot;Ôstarmânôth&quot; in Old High German has been taken as an indication that a similar goddess was also worshipped in southern Germany. The Lithuanian dawn goddess Aušra was still acknowledged in the sixteenth century.

====Sun and Moon====

 and are reconstructed as the Proto-Indo-European deity of the Sun and deity of the Moon respectively. Their gender varies according to the different mythologies of the Indo-European peoples. 

The daily course of across the sky on a horse-driven chariot is a common motif among Indo-European myths. While it is probably inherited, the motif certainly appeared after the introduction of the wheel in the Pontic–Caspian steppe about 3500 BC, and is therefore a late addition to Proto-Indo-European culture.

Although the sun was personified as an independent deity, the Proto-Indo-Europeans also visualized the sun as the &quot;lamp of Dyēws&quot; or the &quot;eye of Dyēws&quot;;

====Divine Twins====
The Horse Twins are a set of twin brothers found throughout nearly every Indo-European pantheon who usually have a name that means &#x27;horse&#x27;, , although the names are not always cognate, and no Proto-Indo-European name for them can be reconstructed.

In most traditions, the Horse Twins are brothers of the Sun Maiden or Dawn goddess, and the sons of the sky god, . The Greek &quot;Dioscuri&quot; (Castor and Pollux) are the &quot;sons of Zeus&quot;; the Vedic &quot;Divó nápātā&quot; (Aśvins) are the &quot;sons of Dyaús&quot;, the sky-god; the Lithuanian &quot;Dievo sūneliai&quot; (Ašvieniai) are the &quot;sons of the God&quot; (Dievas); and the Latvian &quot;Dieva dēli&quot; are likewise the &quot;sons of the God&quot; (Dievs).

Represented as young men and the steeds who pull the sun across the sky, the Divine Twins rode horses (sometimes they were depicted as horses themselves) and rescued men from mortal peril in battle or at sea. The Divine Twins are often differentiated: one is represented as a young warrior while the other is seen as a healer or concerned with domestic duties. In most tales where they appear, the Divine Twins rescue the Dawn from a watery peril, a theme that emerged from their role as the solar steeds. At night, the horses of the sun returned to the east in a golden boat, where they traversed the sea to bring back the Sun each morning. During the day, they crossed the sky in pursuit of their consort, the morning star.

Other reflexes may be found in the Anglo-Saxon Hengist and Horsa (whose names mean &quot;stallion&quot; and &quot;horse&quot;), the Celtic &quot;Dioskouroi&quot; said by Timaeus to be venerated by Atlantic Celts as a set of horse twins, the Germanic Alcis, a pair of young male brothers worshipped by the Naharvali, or the Welsh Brân and Manawydan. The horse twins could have been based on the morning and evening star (the planet Venus) and they often have stories about them in which they &quot;accompany&quot; the Sun goddess, because of the close orbit of the planet Venus to the sun.

==== Mitra-Varuna ====
Although the etymological association is often deemed untenable, some scholars (such as Georges Dumézil and S. K. Sen) have proposed or (also the eponymous god in the reconstructed dialogue The king and the god) as the nocturnal sky and benevolent counterpart of Dyēws, with possible cognates in Greek Ouranos and Vedic Varuna, from the PIE root (&quot;to encompass, cover&quot;). Worunos may have personified the firmament, or dwelled in the night sky. In both Greek and Vedic poetry, Ouranos and Varuna are portrayed as &quot;wide-looking&quot;, bounding or seizing their victims, and having or being a heavenly &quot;seat&quot;. In the three-sky cosmological model, the celestial phenomena linking the nightly and daily skies is embodied by a &quot;Binder-god&quot;: the Greek Kronos, a transitional deity between Ouranos and Zeus in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, the Indic Savitṛ, associated with the rising and setting of the sun in the , and the Roman Saturnus, whose feast marked the period immediately preceding the winter solstice.

==== Other propositions ====
Some scholars have proposed a consort goddess named or , a spouse of Dyēws with a possible descendant in the Greek goddess Dione. A thematic echo may also occur in Vedic India, as both Indra&#x27;s wife Indrānī and Zeus&#x27;s consort Dione display a jealous and quarrelsome disposition under provocation. A second descendant may be found in Dia, a mortal said to unite with Zeus in a Greek myth. The story leads ultimately to the birth of the Centaurs after the mating of Dia&#x27;s husband Ixion with the phantom of Hera, the spouse of Zeus. The reconstruction is however only attested in those two traditions and therefore not secured. The Greek Hera, the Roman Juno, the Germanic Frigg and the Indic Shakti are often depicted as the protectress of marriage and fertility, or as the bestowal of the gift of prophecy. James P. Mallory and Douglas Q. Adams note however that &quot;these functions are much too generic to support the supposition of a distinct PIE &#x27;consort goddess&#x27; and many of the &#x27;consorts&#x27; probably represent assimilations of earlier goddesses who may have had nothing to do with marriage.&quot;

===Nature deities===

The substratum of Proto-Indo-European mythology is animistic. This native animism is still reflected in the Indo-European daughter cultures. In Norse mythology the Vættir are for instance reflexes of the native animistic nature spirits and deities. Trees have a central position in Indo-European daughter cultures, and are thought to be the abode of tree spirits.

In Indo-European tradition, the storm is deified as a highly active, assertive, and sometimes aggressive element; the fire and water are deified as cosmic elements that are also necessary for the functioning of the household; the deified earth is associated with fertility and growth on the one hand, and with death and the underworld on the other.

==== Earth Mother ====
The earth goddess, , is portrayed as the vast and dark house of mortals, in contrast with Dyēws, the bright sky and seat of the immortal gods. She is associated with fertility and growth, but also with death as the final dwelling of the deceased. She was likely the consort of the sky father, . The duality is associated with fertility, as the crop grows from her moist soil, nourished by the rain of Dyēws. The Earth is thus portrayed as the giver of good things: she is exhorted to become pregnant in an Old English prayer; and Slavic peasants described Zemlja-matushka, Mother Earth, as a prophetess that shall offer favorable harvest to the community. The unions of Zeus with Semele and Demeter is likewise associated with fertility and growth in Greek mythology. This pairing is further attested in the Vedic pairing of Dyáus Pitā and Prithvi Mater, the Greek pairing of Ouranos and Gaia, the Roman pairing of Jupiter and Tellus Mater from Macrobius&#x27;s &quot;Saturnalia&quot;, and the Norse pairing of Odin and Jörð. Although Odin is not a reflex of , his cult may have subsumed aspects of an earlier chief deity who was. The Earth and Heaven couple is however not at the origin of the other gods, as the Divine Twins and Hausos were probably conceived by Dyēws alone.

Cognates include the Albanian Dheu and Zonja e Dheut, Great Mother Earth and Earth Goddess, respectively; Žemyna, a Lithuanian goddess of earth celebrated as the bringer of flowers; the Avestan Zām, the Zoroastrian concept of &#x27;earth&#x27;; Zemes Māte (&quot;Mother Earth&quot;), one of the goddesses of death in Latvian mythology; the Hittite Dagan-zipas (&quot;Genius of the Earth&quot;); the Slavic Mati Syra Zemlya (&quot;Mother Moist Earth&quot;); the Greek Chthôn (Χθών), the partner of Ouranos in Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Danaids&quot;, and the chthonic deities of the underworld. The possibilities of a Thracian goddess Zemelā () and a Messapic goddess Damatura (), at the origin of the Greek Semele and Demeter respectively, are less secured. The commonest epithets attached to the Earth goddess are (the &quot;Broad One&quot;), attested in the Vedic Pṛthvī, the Greek Plataia and Gaulish Litavis, and (&quot;Mother Broad One&quot;), attested in the Vedic and Old English formulas &quot;Pṛthvī Mātā&quot; and &quot;Fīra Mōdor&quot;.&quot;&quot; Other frequent epithets include the &quot;All-Bearing One&quot;, the one who bears all things or creatures, and the &quot;mush-nourishing&quot; or the &quot;rich-pastured&quot;.

==== Weather deity ====
*&quot;Perkʷunos&quot; has been reconstructed as the Proto-Indo-European god of lightning and storms. It either meant &quot;the Striker&quot; or &quot;the Lord of Oaks&quot;, and he was probably represented as holding a hammer or a similar weapon. Thunder and lightning had both a destructive and regenerative connotation: a lightning bolt can cleave a stone or a tree, but is often accompanied with fructifying rain. This likely explains the strong association between the thunder-god and oaks in some traditions (oak being among the densest of trees is most prone to lightning strikes). He is often portrayed in connection with stone and (wooded) mountains, probably because the mountainous forests were his realm. The striking of devils, demons or evildoers by Perkʷunos is a motif encountered in the myths surrounding the Lithuanian Perkūnas and the Vedic Parjanya, a possible cognate, but also in the Germanic Thor, a thematic echo of Perkʷunos.

The deities generally agreed to be cognates stemming from are confined to the European continent, and he could have been a motif developed later in Western Indo-European traditions. The evidence include the Norse goddess Fjǫrgyn (the mother of Thor), the Lithuanian god Perkūnas, the Slavic god Perúnú, and the Celtic Hercynian (&quot;Herkynío&quot;) mountains or forests. Perëndi, an Albanian thunder-god (from the stem &quot;per-en-&quot;, &quot;to strike&quot;, attached to -&quot;di&quot;, &quot;sky&quot;, from ) is also a probable cognate. The evidence could extend to the Vedic tradition if one adds the god of rain, thunder and lightning Parjánya, although Sanskrit sound laws rather predict a *⁠ form.

From another root (&quot;thunder&quot;) stems a group of cognates found in the Germanic, Celtic and Roman thunder-gods Thor, Taranis, (Jupiter) Tonans and (Zeus) Keraunos. According to Jackson, &quot;they may have arisen as the result of fossilisation of an original epithet or epiclesis&quot;, as the Vedic Parjanya is also called (&quot;Thunderer&quot;). The Roman god Mars may be a thematic echo of Perkʷunos, since he originally had thunderer characteristics.

==== Fire deities ====
Although the linguistic evidence is restricted to the Vedic and Balto-Slavic traditions, scholars have proposed that Proto-Indo-Europeans conceived the fire as a divine entity called . &quot;Seen from afar&quot; and &quot;untiring&quot;, the Indic deity is pictured in the as the god of both terrestrial and celestial fires. He embodied the flames of the sun and the lightning, as well as the forest fire, the domestic hearth fire and the sacrificial altar, linking heaven and earth in a ritual dimension. Another group of cognates deriving from the Balto-Slavic &quot;*ungnis&quot; (&quot;fire&quot;) is also attested. Early modern sources report that Lithuanian priests worshipped a &quot;holy Fire&quot; named &quot;Ugnis (szwenta)&quot;, which they tried to maintain in perpetual life, while &quot;Uguns (māte)&quot; was revered as the &quot;Mother of Fire&quot; by the Latvians. Tenth-century Persian sources give evidence of the veneration of fire among the Slavs, and later sources in Old Church Slavonic attest the worship of fire (&quot;ogonĭ&quot;), occurring under the divine name &quot;Svarožič&quot;, who has been interpreted as the son of Svarog.

The name of the fire god in the Albanian pagan mythology – Enji, from PIE – is evidently contained in the week day name that was dedicated to him – – the Albanian word for Thursday. He is thought to have been worshiped by the Illyrians in antiquity, being the most prominent god of the pantheon when week day names were formed in the Albanian language. In Albanian tradition, the fire – zjarri – is deified, with the power to ward off evil and darkness, give strength to the Sun (Dielli, who is worshiped as the god of light and giver of life), sustain the continuity between life and afterlife and between the generations. The divine power of fire is used by Albanians for the hearth and the rituals, including calendar fires, sacrificial offerings, divination, purification, and protection from big storms and other potentially harmful events. The Albanian fire worship and rituals are associated with the cult of the Sun, the cult of the hearth (vatër) and the ancestor, and the cult of fertility in agriculture and animal husbandry.

In other traditions, as the sacral name of the dangerous fire may have become a word taboo, the reflexes of the Indo-European root served instead as an ordinary term for fire, as in the Latin &quot;ignis&quot;.

Scholars generally agree that the cult of the hearth dates back to Proto-Indo-European times. The domestic fire had to be tended with care and given offerings, and if one moved house, one carried fire from the old to the new home. The Avestan &quot;Ātar&quot; was the sacral and hearth fire, often personified and honored as a god. In Albanian beliefs, &quot;Nëna e Vatrës&quot; (&quot;the Hearth Mother&quot;) is the goddess protector of the domestic hearth (&quot;vatër&quot;). Herodotus reported a Scythian goddess of hearth named &quot;Tabiti&quot;, a term likely given under a slightly distorted guise, as she might represent a feminine participial form corresponding to an Indo-Iranian god named *&quot;Tapatī,&quot; &quot;the Burning one&quot;. The sacral or domestic hearth can likewise be found in the Greek and Roman hearth goddesses Hestia and Vesta, two names that may derive from the PIE root (&quot;burning&quot;). Both the ritual fires set in the temples of Vesta and the domestic fires of ancient India were circular, rather than the square form reserved for public worship in India and for the other gods in Roman antiquity. Additionally, the custom that the bride circles the hearth three times is common to Indian, Ossetian, Slavic, Baltic, and German traditions, while a newly born child was welcomed into a Greek household when the father circled the hearth carrying it in the Amphidromia ceremony.

====Water deities====

Based on the similarity of motifs attested over a wide geographical extent, it is very likely that Proto-Indo-European beliefs featured some sorts of beautiful and sometimes dangerous water goddesses who seduced mortal men, akin to the Greek naiads, the nymphs of fresh waters. The Vedic Apsarás are said to frequent forest lakes, rivers, trees, and mountains. They are of outstanding beauty, and Indra sends them to lure men. In Ossetic mythology, the waters are ruled by Donbettyr (&quot;Water-Peter&quot;), who has daughters of extraordinary beauty and with golden hair. In Armenian folklore, the Parik take the form of beautiful women who dance amid nature. The Slavonic water nymphs &quot;víly&quot; are also depicted as alluring maidens with long golden or green hair who like young men and can do harm if they feel offended. The Albanian mountain nymphs, Perit and Zana, are portrayed as beautiful but also dangerous creatures. Similar to the Baltic nymph-like Laumes, they have the habit of abducting children. The beautiful and long-haired Laumes also have sexual relations and short-lived marriages with men. The Breton Korrigans are irresistible creatures with golden hair wooing mortal men and causing them to perish for love. The Norse Huldra, Iranian Ahuraīnīs and Lycian Eliyãna can likewise be regarded as reflexes of the water nymphs.

A wide range of linguistic and cultural evidence attest the holy status of the terrestrial (potable) waters , venerated collectively as &quot;the Waters&quot; or divided into &quot;Rivers and Springs&quot;. The cults of fountains and rivers, which may have preceded Proto-Indo-European beliefs by tens of thousands of years, was also prevalent in their tradition. Some authors have proposed or as the Proto-Indo-European god of the waters. The name literally means &quot;Grandson [or &quot;Nephew&quot;] of the Waters&quot;. Linguists reconstruct his name from that of the Vedic god Apám Nápát, the Roman god Neptūnus, and the Old Irish god Nechtain. Although such a god has been solidly reconstructed in Proto-Indo-Iranian religion, Mallory and Adams nonetheless still reject him as a Proto-Indo-European deity on linguistic grounds.

A river goddess has been proposed based on the Vedic goddess Dānu, the Irish goddess Danu, the Welsh goddess Dôn and the names of the rivers Danube, Don, Dnieper, and Dniester. Mallory and Adams however note that while the lexical correspondence is probable, &quot;there is really no evidence for a specific river goddess&quot; in Proto-Indo-European mythology &quot;other than the deification of the concept of &#x27;river&#x27; in Indic tradition&quot;. Some have also proposed the reconstruction of a sea god named based on the Greek god Triton and the Old Irish word &quot;trïath&quot;, meaning &quot;sea&quot;. Mallory and Adams also reject this reconstruction as having no basis, asserting that the &quot;lexical correspondence is only just possible and with no evidence of a cognate sea god in Irish.&quot;

==== Wind deities ====

Evidence for the deification of the wind is found in most Indo-European traditions. The root (&quot;to blow&quot;) is at the origin of the two words for the wind: and . The deity is indeed often depicted as a couple in the Indo-Iranian tradition. Vayu-Vāta is a dual divinity in the &quot;Avesta&quot;, Vāta being associated with the stormy winds and described as coming from everywhere (&quot;from below, from above, from in front, from behind&quot;). Similarly, the Vedic Vāyu, the lord of the winds, is connected in the &quot;Vedas&quot; with Indra—the king of Svarga Loka (also called Indraloka)—while the other deity Vāta represents a more violent sort of wind and is instead associated with Parjanya—the god of rain and thunder. Other cognates include Hitt. &quot;huwant-&quot;, Lith. &quot;vėjas&quot;, Toch. B &quot;yente&quot;, Lat. &quot;uentus&quot;, PGmc. , or Welsh &quot;gwynt.&quot; The Slavic Viy is another possible equivalent entity. Based on these different traditions, Yaroslav Vassilkov postulated a proto-Indo-European wind deity which &quot;was probably marked by ambivalence, and combined in itself both positive and negative characteristics&quot;. This god is hypothesized to have been linked to life and death through adding and taking breath from people.

==== Guardian deity ====
The association between the Greek god Pan and the Vedic god Pūshan was first identified in 1924 by German linguist Hermann Collitz. Both were worshipped as pastoral deities, which led scholars to reconstruct (&quot;Protector&quot;) as a pastoral god guarding roads and herds. He may have had an unfortunate appearance, a bushy beard and a keen sight. He was also closely affiliated with goats or bucks: Pan has goat&#x27;s legs while goats are said to pull the car of Pūshān (the animal was also sacrificed to him on occasion).

==== Cattle deity ====
Jaan Puhvel has proposed a cattle god called which he links to the Slavic god Veles, the Lithuanian god Velnias, and less certainly to Old Norse Ullr.

==== Other propositions ====
In 1855, Adalbert Kuhn suggested that the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed in a set of helper deities, whom he reconstructed based on the Germanic elves and the Hindu . Although this proposal is often mentioned in academic writings, very few scholars actually accept it since the cognate relationship is linguistically difficult to justify. While stories of elves, satyrs, goblins and giants show recurrent traits in Indo-European traditions, West notes that &quot;it is difficult to see so coherent an overall pattern as with the nymphs. It is unlikely that the Indo-Europeans had no concept of such creatures, but we cannot define with any sharpness of outline what their conceptions were.&quot; A wild god named has also been proposed, based on the Vedic Rudrá and the Old Russian Rŭglŭ. Problematic is whether the name derives from (&quot;rend, tear apart&quot;; akin to Lat. &quot;rullus,&quot; &quot;rustic&quot;), or rather from (&quot;howl&quot;).

Although the name of the divinities are not cognates, a horse goddess portrayed as bearing twins and in connection with fertility and marriage has been proposed based on the Gaulish Epona, Irish Macha and Welsh Rhiannon, with other thematic echos in the Greek and Indic traditions. Demeter transformed herself into a mare when she was raped by Poseidon appearing as a stallion, and she gave birth to a daughter and a horse, Areion. Similarly, the Indic tradition tells of Saranyu fleeing from her husband Vivásvat when she assumed the form of a mare. Vivásvat metamorphosed into a stallion and of their intercourse were born the twin horses, the Aśvins. The Irish goddess Macha gave birth to twins, a mare and a boy, and the Welsh figure Rhiannon bore a child who was reared along with a horse.

=== Societal deities ===

==== Fate goddesses ====

It is highly probable that the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed in three fate goddesses who spun the destinies of mankind. Although such fate goddesses are not directly attested in the Indo-Aryan tradition, the Atharvaveda does contain an allusion comparing fate to a warp. Furthermore, the three Fates appear in nearly every other Indo-European mythology. The earliest attested set of fate goddesses are the Gulses in Hittite mythology, who were said to preside over the individual destinies of human beings. They often appear in mythical narratives alongside the goddesses Papaya and Istustaya, who, in a ritual text for the foundation of a new temple, are described sitting holding mirrors and spindles, spinning the king&#x27;s thread of life. In the Greek tradition, the Moirai (&quot;Apportioners&quot;) are mentioned dispensing destiny in both the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, in which they are given the epithet Κλῶθες (&quot;Klothes&quot;, meaning &quot;Spinners&quot;).

In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, the Moirai are said to &quot;give mortal men both good and ill&quot; and their names are listed as Klotho (&quot;Spinner&quot;), Lachesis (&quot;Apportioner&quot;), and Atropos (&quot;Inflexible&quot;). In his &quot;Republic&quot;, Plato records that Klotho sings of the past, Lachesis of the present, and Atropos of the future. In Roman legend, the Parcae were three goddesses who presided over the births of children and whose names were Nona (&quot;Ninth&quot;), Decuma (&quot;Tenth&quot;), and Morta (&quot;Death&quot;). They too were said to spin destinies, although this may have been due to influence from Greek literature.

In the Old Norse &quot;Völuspá&quot; and &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the Norns are three cosmic goddesses of fate who are described sitting by the well of Urðr at the foot of the world tree Yggdrasil. In Old Norse texts, the Norns are frequently conflated with Valkyries, who are sometimes also described as spinning. Old English texts, such as &quot;Rhyme Poem&quot; 70, and &quot;Guthlac&quot; 1350 f., reference Wyrd as a singular power that &quot;weaves&quot; destinies.

Later texts mention the Wyrds as a group, with Geoffrey Chaucer referring to them as &quot;the Werdys that we clepyn Destiné&quot; in &quot;The Legend of Good Women&quot;. A goddess spinning appears in a bracteate from southwest Germany and a relief from Trier shows three mother goddesses, with two of them holding distaffs. Tenth-century German ecclesiastical writings denounce the popular belief in three sisters who determined the course of a man&#x27;s life at his birth. An Old Irish hymn attests to seven goddesses who were believed to weave the thread of destiny, which demonstrates that these spinster fate-goddesses were present in Celtic mythology as well.

A Lithuanian folktale recorded in 1839 recounts that a man&#x27;s fate is spun at his birth by seven goddesses known as the &quot;deivės valdytojos&quot; and used to hang a star in the sky; when he dies, his thread snaps and his star falls as a meteor. In Latvian folk songs, a goddess called the Láima is described as weaving a child&#x27;s fate at its birth. Although she is usually only one goddess, the Láima sometimes appears as three. The three spinning fate goddesses appear in Slavic traditions in the forms of the Russian Rožanicy, the Czech and Slovak Sudičky, the Bulgarian Narenčnice or Urisnice, the Polish Rodzanice, the Croatian Rodjenice, the Serbian Sudjenice, and the Slovene Rojenice. Albanian folk tales speak of the Fatit, three old women who appear three days after a child is born and determine its fate, using language reminiscent of spinning.

==== Welfare god ====
The god has been reconstructed as a deity in charge of welfare and the community, connected to the building and maintenance of roads or pathways, but also with healing and the institution of marriage.&#x27; It derives from the noun (a &quot;member of one&#x27;s own group&quot;, &quot;one who belongs to the community&quot;, in contrast to an outsider), also at the origin of the Indo-Iranian &quot;*árya&quot;, &quot;noble, hospitable&quot;, and the Celtic &quot;*aryo-&quot;, &quot;free man&quot; (Old Irish: &quot;aire,&quot; &quot;noble, chief&quot;; Gaulish: &quot;arios&quot;, &quot;free man, lord&quot;). The Vedic god Aryaman is frequently mentioned in the &quot;Vedas&quot;, and associated with social and marital ties. In the &quot;Gāthās&quot;, the Iranian god Airyaman seems to denote the wider tribal network or alliance, and is invoked in a prayer against illness, magic, and evil.&#x27; In the mythical stories of the founding of the Irish nation, the hero Érimón became the first king of the Milesians (the mythical name of the Irish) after he helped conquer the island from the Tuatha Dé Danann. He also provided wives to the Cruithnig (the mythical Celtic Britons or Picts), a reflex of the marital functions of .&quot;&quot; The Gaulish given name Ariomanus, possibly translated as &quot;lord-spirited&quot; and generally borne by Germanic chiefs, is also to be mentioned.

==== Smith god ====
Although the name of a particular smith god cannot be linguistically reconstructed, smith gods of various names are found in most Proto-Indo-European daughter languages. There is not a strong argument for a single mythic prototype. Mallory notes that &quot;deities specifically concerned with particular craft specializations may be expected in any ideological system whose people have achieved an appropriate level of social complexity&quot;. Nonetheless, two motifs recur frequently in Indo-European traditions: the making of the chief god&#x27;s distinctive weapon (Indra&#x27;s and Zeus&#x27; bolt; Lugh&#x27;s and Odin&#x27;s spear and Thor&#x27;s hammer) by a special artificer, and the craftsman god&#x27;s association with the immortals&#x27; drinking.

==== Love goddess ====
Scholars have suggested a common root, &quot;, &quot; or &quot;?,&quot; for the Sanskrit , Greek Aphrodite, Mycenaean Greek theonym , likely related Pamphylian () and Common Germanic Frijjō, that would point to a Proto-Indo-European love god or goddess. 

&#x27; is a root for beloved/friend, whereas &#x27; means &quot;wife&quot; or &quot;beloved wife&quot; and has descendant forms in many Indo-European languages. It is ancestral to Sanskrit &quot;priya&quot; &quot;dear, beloved&quot; and Common Germanic Frijjō.

In Latin Venus takes her place. Her name is not cognate at all, but Norse descendants of &#x27;, Freyr and Freyja belong to the race of so-called Vanir, which comes from the same Proto-Indo-European root &#x27;. Freyja is possibly worshipped under the name Perun in southern Slavic-speaking areas. In Albanian she is , Christianized as St. Prendi. J. Grimm refers to an Old Bohemian form , used as a gloss for Venus in Mater Verborum. Many of these goddesses give their name to the fifth day of the week, Friday. They are also very well known in lesser form such as the Germanic Elves and the Persian Peris, charming and seductive beings in folklore.

There are also masculine forms of this deity, Greek Priapos, borrowed into Latin as Priapus; and Old Norse Freyr.

==== Other propositions ====
The Proto-Indo-Europeans may also have had a goddess who presided over the trifunctional organization of society. Various epithets of the Iranian goddess Anahita and the Roman goddess Juno provide sufficient evidence to solidly attest that she was probably worshipped, but no specific name for her can be lexically reconstructed. Vague remnants of this goddess may also be preserved in the Greek goddess Athena. A decay goddess has also been proposed on the basis of the Vedic Nirṛti and the Roman Lūa Mater. Her names derive from the verbal roots &quot;decay, rot&quot;, and they are both associated with the decomposition of human bodies.

Michael Estell has reconstructed a mythical craftsman named based on the Greek Orpheus and the Vedic Ribhus. Both are the son of a cudgel-bearer or an archer, and both are known as &quot;fashioners&quot; (). A mythical hero named has also been proposed, from the Greek hero Prometheus (&quot;the one who steals&quot;), who took the heavenly fire away from the gods to bring it to mankind, and the Vedic Mātariśvan, the mythical bird who &quot;robbed&quot; (found in the myth as &quot;pra math-&quot;, &quot;to steal&quot;) the hidden fire and gave it to the Bhrigus. A medical god has been reconstructed based on a thematic comparison between the Indic god Rudra and the Greek Apollo. Both inflict disease from afar thanks to their bows, both are known as healers, and both are specifically associated with rodents: Rudra&#x27;s animal is the &quot;rat mole&quot; and Apollo was known as a &quot;rat god&quot;.

Some scholars have proposed a war god named based on the Roman god Mars and the Vedic Marutás, the companions of the war-god Indra. Mallory and Adams reject this reconstruction on linguistic grounds. Likewise, some researchers have found it more plausible that Mars was originally a storm deity, while the same cannot be said of Ares.

== Myths ==

=== Serpent-slaying myth ===
One common myth found in nearly all Indo-European mythologies is a battle ending with a hero or god slaying a serpent or dragon of some sort. Although the details of the story often vary widely, several features remain remarkably the same in all iterations. The protagonist of the story is usually a thunder-god, or a hero somehow associated with thunder. His enemy the serpent is generally associated with water and depicted as multi-headed, or else &quot;multiple&quot; in some other way. Indo-European myths often describe the creature as a &quot;blocker of waters&quot;, and his many heads get eventually smashed by the thunder-god in an epic battle, releasing torrents of water that had previously been pent up. The original legend may have symbolized the &quot;Chaoskampf&quot;, a clash between forces of order and chaos. The dragon or serpent loses in every version of the story, although in some mythologies, such as the Norse Ragnarök myth, the hero or the god dies with his enemy during the confrontation. Historian Bruce Lincoln has proposed that the dragon-slaying tale and the creation myth of &quot;*Trito&quot; killing the serpent *&quot;&quot; may actually belong to the same original story. 

Reflexes of the Proto-Indo-European dragon-slaying myth appear in most Indo-European poetic traditions, where the myth has left traces of the formulaic sentence , meaning &quot;[he] slew the serpent&quot;. In Hittite mythology, the storm god Tarhunt slays the giant serpent Illuyanka, as does the Vedic god Indra the multi-headed serpent Vritra, which has been causing a drought by trapping the waters in his mountain lair.
 Several variations of the story are also found in Greek mythology. The original motif appears inherited in the legend of Zeus slaying the hundred-headed Typhon, as related by Hesiod in the &quot;Theogony&quot;, and possibly in the myth of Heracles slaying the nine-headed Lernaean Hydra and in the legend of Apollo slaying the earth-dragon Python. The story of Heracles&#x27;s theft of the cattle of Geryon is probably also related. Although he is not usually thought of as a storm deity in the conventional sense, Heracles bears many attributes held by other Indo-European storm deities, including physical strength and a penchant for violence and gluttony.

The original motif is also reflected in Germanic mythology. The Norse god of thunder Thor slays the giant serpent Jörmungandr, which lived in the waters surrounding the realm of Midgard. In the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, Sigurd slays the dragon Fafnir and, in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the eponymous hero slays a different dragon. The depiction of dragons hoarding a treasure (symbolizing the wealth of the community) in Germanic legends may also be a reflex of the original myth of the serpent holding waters.

In Zoroastrianism and in Persian mythology, Fereydun (and later Garshasp) slays the serpent Zahhak. In Albanian mythology, the drangue, semi-human divine figures associated with thunders, slay the kulshedra, huge multi-headed fire-spitting serpents associated with water and storms. The Slavic god of storms Perun slays his enemy the dragon-god Veles, as does the bogatyr hero Dobrynya Nikitich to the three-headed dragon Zmey. A similar execution is performed by the Armenian god of thunders Vahagn to the dragon Vishap, by the Romanian knight hero Făt-Frumos to the fire-spitting monster Zmeu, and by the Celtic god of healing Dian Cecht to the serpent Meichi.

In Shinto, where Indo-European influences through Vedic religion can be seen in mythology, the storm god Susanoo slays the eight-headed serpent Yamata no Orochi.
The Genesis narrative of Judaism and Christianity, as well as the dragon appearing in Revelation 12 can be interpreted as a retelling of the serpent-slaying myth. The Deep or Abyss from or on top of which God is said to make the world is translated from the Biblical Hebrew Tehom (Hebrew: תְּהוֹם). Tehom is a cognate of the Akkadian word &quot;tamtu&quot; and Ugaritic &quot;t-h-m&quot; which have similar meaning. As such it was equated with the earlier Babylonian serpent Tiamat.

Folklorist Andrew Lang suggests that the serpent-slaying myth morphed into a folktale motif of a frog or toad blocking the flow of waters.

=== Fire in water ===

Another reconstructed myth is the story of the fire in the waters. It depicts a fiery divine being named (&#x27;Descendant of the Waters&#x27;) who dwells in waters, and whose powers must be ritually gained or controlled by a hero who is the only one able to approach it. In the , the god Apám Nápát is envisioned as a form of fire residing in the waters. In Celtic mythology, a well belonging to the god Nechtain is said to blind all those who gaze into it. In an old Armenian poem, a small reed in the middle of the sea spontaneously catches fire and the hero Vahagn springs forth from it with fiery hair and a fiery beard and eyes that blaze as suns. In a ninth-century Norwegian poem by the poet Thiodolf, the name &quot;sǣvar niþr&quot;, meaning &quot;grandson of the sea&quot;, is used as a kenning for fire. Even the Greek tradition contains possible allusions to the myth of a fire-god dwelling deep beneath the sea. The phrase &quot;νέποδες καλῆς Ἁλοσύδνης&quot;, meaning &quot;descendants of the beautiful seas&quot;, is used in &quot;The Odyssey&quot; 4.404 as an epithet for the seals of Proteus.

=== King and Virgin ===
The legend of the King and Virgin involves a ruler saved by the offspring of his virgin daughter after seeing his future threatened by rebellious sons or male relatives. The virginity likely symbolizes in the myth the woman that has no loyalty to any man but her father, and the child is likewise faithful only to his royal grandfather. The legends of the Indic king Yayāti, saved by his virgin daughter Mādhāvi; the Roman king Numitor, rescued by his chaste daughter Rhea Silvia; the Irish king Eochaid, father of the legendary queen Medb, and threatened by his sons the &quot;findemna&quot;; as well as the myth of the Norse virgin goddess Gefjun offering lands to Odin&quot;,&quot; are generally cited as possible reflexes of an inherited Proto-Indo-European motif. The Irish queen Medb could be cognate with the Indic Mādhāvi (whose name designates either a spring flower, rich in honey, or an intoxicating drink), both deriving from the root (&quot;mead, intoxicating drink&quot;).

=== War of the Foundation ===
A myth of the War of the Foundation has also been proposed, involving a conflict between the first two functions (the priests and warriors) and the third function (fertility), which eventually make peace in order to form a fully integrated society. The Norse &quot;Ynglingasaga&quot; tells of a war between the Æsir (led by Oðinn and Thor) and the Vanir (led by Freyr, Freyja and Njörðr) that finally ends with the Vanir coming to live among the Æsir. Shortly after the mythical founding of Rome, Romulus fights his wealthy neighbours the Sabines, the Romans abducting their women to eventually incorporate the Sabines into the founding tribes of Rome. In Vedic mythology, the Aśvins (representing the third function as the Divine Twins) are blocked from accessing the heavenly circle of power by Indra (the second function), who is eventually coerced into letting them in. The Trojan War has also been interpreted as a reflex of the myth, with the wealthy Troy as the third function and the conquering Greeks as the first two functions.

===Binding of evil===

Jaan Puhvel notes similarities between the Norse myth in which the god Týr inserts his hand into the wolf Fenrir&#x27;s mouth while the other gods bind him with Gleipnir, only for Fenrir to bite off Týr&#x27;s hand when he discovers he cannot break his bindings, and the Iranian myth in which Jamshid rescues his brother&#x27;s corpse from Ahriman&#x27;s bowels by reaching his hand up Ahriman&#x27;s anus and pulling out his brother&#x27;s corpse, only for his hand to become infected with leprosy. In both accounts, an authority figure forces the evil entity into submission by inserting his hand into the being&#x27;s orifice (in Fenrir&#x27;s case the mouth, in Ahriman&#x27;s the anus) and losing or impairing it. Fenrir and Ahriman fulfill different roles in their own mythological traditions and are unlikely to be remnants of a Proto-Indo-European &quot;evil god&quot;; nonetheless, it is clear that the &quot;binding myth&quot; is of Proto-Indo-European origin.

=== Other propositions ===
==== Death of a son ====
The motif of the &quot;death of a son&quot;, killed by his father who is unaware of the relationship, is so common among the attested traditions that some scholars have ascribed it to Proto-Indo-European times. In the Ulster Cycle, Connla, son of the Irish hero Cú Chulainn, who was raised abroad in Scotland, unknowingly confronts his father and is killed in the combat; in Russian epic poems, Ilya Muromets must kill his own son, who was also raised apart; the Germanic hero Hildebrant inadvertently kills his son Hadubrant in the &quot;Hildebrandslied&quot;; and the Iranian Rostam unknowingly confronts his son Sohrab in the eponymous epic of the &quot;Shāhnāmeh&quot;. King Arthur is forced to kill his son Mordred in battle who was raised far away on the Orkney Islands; and in Greek mythology, an intrigue leads the hero Theseus to kill his son Hippolytus; when the lie is finally exposed, Hippolytus is already dead. According to Mallory and Adams, the legend &quot;places limitations on the achievement of warrior prowess, isolates the hero from time by cutting off his generational extension, and also re-establishes the hero&#x27;s typical adolescence by depriving him of a role (as father) in an adult world&quot;.

==== &quot;Mead cycle&quot; ====
Although the concept of elevation through intoxicating drink is a nearly universal motif, a Proto-Indo-European myth of the &quot;cycle of the mead&quot;, originally proposed by Georges Dumézil and further developed by Jarich G. Oosten (1985), is based on the comparison of Indic and Norse mythologies. In both traditions, gods and demons must cooperate to find a sacred drink providing immortal life. The magical beverage is prepared from the sea, and a serpent (Vāsuki or Jörmungandr) is involved in the quest. The gods and demons eventually fight over the magical potion and the former, ultimately victorious, deprive their enemy of the elixir of life.

== Rituals ==

Proto-Indo-European religion was centered on sacrificial rites of cattle and horses, probably administered by a class of priests or shamans. Animals were slaughtered () and dedicated to the gods () in the hope of winning their favour. The Khvalynsk culture, associated with the archaic Proto-Indo-European language, had already shown archeological evidence for the sacrifice of domesticated animals.

=== Priesthood ===

The king as the high priest would have been the central figure in establishing favourable relations with the other world. Georges Dumézil suggested that the religious function was represented by a duality, one reflecting the magico-religious nature of priesthood, while the other is involved in religious sanction to human society (especially contracts), a theory supported by common features in Iranian, Roman, Scandinavian and Celtic traditions.

=== Sacrifices ===
The reconstructed cosmology of the Proto-Indo-Europeans shows that ritual sacrifice of cattle, the cow in particular, was at the root of their beliefs, as the primordial condition of the world order. The myth of , the first warrior, involves the liberation of cattle stolen by a three-headed entity named . After recovering the wealth of the people, Trito eventually offers the cattle to the priest in order to ensure the continuity of the cycle of giving between gods and humans. The word for &quot;oath&quot;, , derives from the verb (&quot;to go&quot;), after the practice of walking between slaughtered animals as part of taking an oath.

Proto-Indo-Europeans likely had a sacred tradition of horse sacrifice for the renewal of kingship involving the ritual mating of a queen or king with a horse, which was then sacrificed and cut up for distribution to the other participants in the ritual. In both the Roman &quot;Equus October&quot; and the Indic &quot;Aśvamedhá&quot;, the horse sacrifice is performed on behalf of the warrior class or to a warrior deity, and the dismembered pieces of the animal eventually goes to different locations or deities. Another reflex may be found in a medieval Irish tradition involving a king-designate from County Donegal copulating with a mare before bathing with the parts of the sacrificed animal. The Indic ritual likewise involved the symbolic marriage of the queen to the dead stallion. Further, if Hittite laws prohibited copulation with animals, they made an exception of horses or mules. In both the Celtic and Indic traditions, an intoxicating brewage played a part in the ritual, and the suffix in &quot;aśva-medhá&quot; could be related to the Old Indic word &quot;mad-&quot; (&quot;boil, rejoice, get drunk&quot;). Jaan Puhvel has also compared the Vedic name of the tradition with the Gaulish god &quot;Epomeduos&quot;, the &quot;master of horses&quot;.

=== Cults ===
Scholars have reconstructed a Proto-Indo-European cult of the weapons, especially the dagger, which holds a central position in various customs and myths. In the Ossetic Nart saga, the sword of Batradz is dragged into the sea after his death, and the British King Arthur throws his legendary sword Excalibur back into the lake from which it initially came. The Indic Arjuna is also instructed to throw his bow Gandiva into the sea at the end of his career, and weapons were frequently thrown into lakes, rivers or bogs as a form of prestige offering in Bronze and Iron Age Europe. Reflexes of an ancestral cult of the magical sword have been proposed in the legends of Excalibur and Durandal (the weapon of Roland, said to have been forged by the mythical Wayland the Smith). Among North Iranians, Herodotus described the Scythian practice of worshiping swords as manifestations of &quot;Ares&quot; in the 5th century BC, and Ammianus Marcellinus depicted the Alanic custom of thrusting swords into the earth and worshiping them as &quot;Mars&quot; in the 4th century AD.

<text>Tathāgata () is a Pali and Sanskrit word used in ancient India for a person who has attained the highest religious goal. Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, used it when referring to himself or other past Buddhas in the Pāli Canon. Likewise, in the Mahayana corpus, it is an epithet of Shakyamuni Buddha and the other celestial buddhas. The term is often thought to mean either &quot;one who has thus gone&quot; (&quot;tathā-gata&quot;), &quot;one who has thus come&quot; (&quot;tathā-āgata&quot;), or sometimes &quot;one who has thus not gone&quot; (&quot;tathā-agata&quot;). This is interpreted as signifying that the Tathāgata is beyond all coming and going – beyond all transitory phenomena. There are, however, other interpretations and the precise original meaning of the word is not certain.

The Buddha is quoted on numerous occasions in the Pali Canon as referring to himself as &quot;the Tathāgata&quot; instead of using the pronouns &quot;me&quot;, &quot;I&quot; or &quot;myself&quot;. This may be meant to emphasize by implication that the teaching is uttered by one who has transcended the human condition, one beyond the otherwise endless cycle of rebirth and death, i.e. beyond dukkha.

==Etymology and interpretation==
The word&#x27;s original significance is not known and there has been speculation about it since at least the time of Buddhaghosa, who gives eight interpretations of the word, each with different etymological support, in his commentary on the Digha Nikaya, the &quot;Sumangalavilasini&quot;:
# He who has arrived in such fashion, i.e. who has worked his way upwards to perfection for the world&#x27;s good in the same fashion as all previous Buddhas.
# He who walked in such fashion, i.e. (a) he who at birth took the seven equal steps in the same fashion as all previous Buddhas or (b) he who in the same way as all previous Buddhas went his way to Buddhahood through the four Jhanas and the Paths.
# He who by the path of knowledge has come at the real essentials of things.
# He who has won Truth.
# He who has discerned Truth.
# He who declares Truth. 
# He whose words and deeds accord.
# The great physician whose medicine is all-potent.

Modern scholarly opinion generally opines that Sanskrit grammar offers at least two possibilities for breaking up the compound word: either &quot;tathā&quot; and &quot;āgata&quot; (via a sandhi rule ā + ā → ā), or &quot;tathā&quot; and &quot;gata.&quot; &quot;Tathā&quot; means &quot;thus&quot; in Sanskrit and Pali, and Buddhist thought takes this to refer to what is called &quot;reality as-it-is&quot; (&quot;yathābhūta&quot;). This reality is also referred to as &quot;thusness&quot; or &quot;suchness&quot; (tathatā), indicating simply that it (reality) is what it is.

Tathāgata is defined as someone who &quot;knows and sees reality as-it-is&quot; (&quot;yathā bhūta ñāna dassana&quot;). &quot;Gata&quot; (&quot;gone&quot;) is the past passive participle of the verbal root &quot;gam&quot; (&quot;go, travel&quot;). &quot;Āgata&quot; (&quot;come&quot;) is the past passive participle of the verb meaning &quot;come, arrive&quot;. In this interpretation, Tathāgata means literally either &quot;the one who has gone to suchness&quot; or &quot;the one who has arrived at suchness&quot;.

Another interpretation, proposed by the scholar Richard Gombrich, is based on the fact that, when used as a suffix in compounds, &quot;-gata&quot; will often lose its literal meaning and signifies instead &quot;being&quot;. Tathāgata would thus mean &quot;one like that&quot;, with no motion in either direction.

According to Fyodor Shcherbatskoy, the term has a non-Buddhist origin, and is best understood when compared to its usage in non-Buddhist works such as the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Shcherbatskoy gives the following example from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (&quot;Shantiparva&quot;, 181.22): &quot;Just as the footprints of birds (flying) in the sky and fish (swimming) in water cannot be seen, Thus (&quot;tātha&quot;) is going (&quot;gati&quot;) of those who have realized the Truth.&quot;

The French author René Guénon, in an essay distinguishing between Pratyēka-Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, writes that the former appear outwardly superior to the latter, simply because they are allowed to remain impassible, whereas the latter must in some sense appear to rediscover &quot;a way&quot; or at least recapitulate it, so that others, too, may &quot;go that way,&quot; hence &quot;tathā-gata&quot;.

==The nature of a &quot;Tathāgata&quot;==
A number of passages affirm that a Tathāgata is &quot;immeasurable&quot;, &quot;inscrutable&quot;, &quot;hard to fathom&quot;, and &quot;not apprehended&quot;. A tathāgata has abandoned that clinging to the &quot;skandhas&quot; (personality factors) that render &quot;citta&quot; (the mind) a bounded, measurable entity, and is instead &quot;freed from being reckoned by&quot; all or any of them, even in life. The aggregates of form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and cognizance that compose personal identity have been seen to be &quot;dukkha&quot; (a burden), and an enlightened individual is one with &quot;burden dropped&quot;.The Buddha explains &quot;that for which a monk has a latent tendency, by that is he reckoned, what he does not have a latent tendency for, by that is he not reckoned. These tendencies are ways in which the mind becomes involved in and clings to conditioned phenomena. Without them, an enlightened person cannot be &quot;reckoned&quot; or &quot;named&quot;; he or she is beyond the range of other beings, and cannot be &quot;found&quot; by them, even by gods, or Mara. In one passage, Sariputta states that the mind of the Buddha cannot be &quot;encompassed&quot; even by him.

The Buddha and Sariputta, in similar passages, when confronted with speculation as to the status of an arahant after death, bring their interlocutors to admit that they cannot even apprehend an arahant that is alive. As Sariputta puts it, his questioner Yamaka &quot;can&#x27;t pin down the Tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life.&quot; These passages imply that condition of the arahant, both before and after parinirvana, lies beyond the domain where the descriptive powers of ordinary language are at home; that is, the world of the skandhas and the greed, hatred, and delusion that are &quot;blown out&quot; with nirvana.

In the Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta, an ascetic named Vaccha questions the Buddha on a variety of metaphysical issues. When Vaccha asks about the status of a tathagata after death, the Buddha asks him in which direction a fire goes when it has gone out. Vaccha replies that the question &quot;does not fit the case ... For the fire that depended on fuel ... when that fuel has all gone, and it can get no other, being thus without nutriment, it is said to be extinct.&quot; The Buddha then explains: &quot;In exactly the same way ..., all form by which one could predicate the existence of the saint, all that form has been abandoned, uprooted, pulled out of the ground like a palmyra-tree, and become non-existent and not liable to spring up again in the future. The saint ... who has been released from what is styled form is deep, immeasurable, unfathomable, like the mighty ocean.&quot; The same is then said of the other aggregates. A variety of similar passages make it clear that the metaphor &quot;gone out, he cannot be defined&quot; (&quot;atthangato so na pamanam eti&quot;) refers equally to liberation in life. In the Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta itself, it is clear that the Buddha is the subject of the metaphor, and the Buddha has already &quot;uprooted&quot; or &quot;annihilated&quot; the five aggregates. In Sn 1074, it is stated that the sage cannot be &quot;reckoned&quot; because he is freed from the category &quot;name&quot; or, more generally, concepts. The absence of this precludes the possibility of reckoning or articulating a state of affairs; &quot;name&quot; here refers to the concepts or apperceptions that make propositions possible.

Nagarjuna expressed this understanding in the nirvana chapter of his Mulamadhyamakakarika: &quot;It is not assumed that the Blessed One exists after death. Neither is it assumed that he does not exist, or both, or neither. It is not assumed that even a living Blessed One exists. Neither is it assumed that he does not exist, or both, or neither.&quot;

Speaking within the context of Mahayana Buddhism (specifically the Perfection of Wisdom sutras), Edward Conze writes that the term &#x27;tathagata&#x27; denotes inherent true selfhood within the human being:

In Vajrayana Buddhism, the Five Tathāgatas (pañcatathāgata) or Five Wisdom Tathāgatas (), the Five Great Buddhas, and the Five Jinas (Sanskrit for &quot;conqueror&quot; or &quot;victor&quot;), are emanations and representations of the five qualities of the Adi-Buddha or &quot;first Buddha&quot; Vairocana or Vajradhara, which is associated with the Dharmakāya.

The Five Wisdom Buddhas are a development of the Buddhist Tantras, and later became associated with the trikaya or &quot;three body&quot; theory of Buddhahood. While in the &quot;Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra&quot; there are only four Buddha families, the full Diamond Realm mandala with five Buddhas first appears in the &quot;Vajrasekhara Sutra&quot;. The Vajrasekhara also mentions a sixth Buddha, Vajradhara, &quot;a Buddha (or principle) seen as the source, in some sense, of the five Buddhas.&quot;

The Five Buddhas are aspects of the dharmakaya &quot;dharma-body&quot;, which embodies the principle of enlightenment in Buddhism.

When these Buddhas are represented in mandalas, they may not always have the same colour or be related to the same directions. In particular, Akshobhya and Vairocana may be switched. When represented in a Vairocana mandala, the Buddhas are arranged like this:
== The Seven Buddhas of Antiquity ==
In the earliest strata of Pali Buddhist texts, especially in the first four Nikāyas, only the following seven Buddhas, the Seven Buddhas of Antiquity (Sattatathāgata, or &quot;The Seven Tathāgatas&quot;), are explicitly mentioned and named. Of these, four are from the current &quot;kappa&quot; (kalpa) and three are from past ones.

# Vipassī (lived ninety-one &quot;kappas&quot; ago)
# Sikhī (lived thirty-one &quot;kappas&quot; ago)
# Vessabhū (lived thirty-one &quot;kappas&quot; ago in the same &quot;kappa&quot; as Sikhī)
# Kakusandha (the first Buddha of the current &quot;bhaddakappa&quot;)
# Koṇāgamana (the second Buddha of the current &quot;bhaddakappa&quot;)
# Kassapa (the third Buddha of the current &quot;bhaddakappa&quot;)
# Gotama (the fourth and present Buddha of the current &quot;bhaddakappa&quot;

One sutta called Cakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta from an early Buddhist text called the Dĩgha Nikãya also mentions that following the Seven Buddhas of Antiquity, a Buddha named Metteyya (Maitreya) is predicted to arise in the world.

However, according to a text in the Theravada Buddhist tradition from a later strata (between the 1st and 2nd century BCE) called the Buddhavaṃsa, twenty-one more Buddhas were added to the list of seven names in the early texts. Theravada tradition maintains that there can be up to five Buddhas in a &quot;kappa&quot; or world age and that the current &quot;kappa&quot; has had four Buddhas, with the current Buddha, Gotama, being the fourth and the future Buddha Metteyya being the fifth and final Buddha of the &quot;kappa&quot;. This would make the current aeon a &quot;bhaddakappa&quot; (&quot;bhadrakalpa&quot;, fortunate aeon). In some Sanskrit and northern Buddhist traditions, however, a &quot;bhadrakalpa&quot; has up to 1,000 Buddhas, with the Buddhas Gautama and Maitreya also being the fourth and fifth Buddhas of the &quot;kalpa&quot;, respectively.

<text>Church history or ecclesiastical history as an academic discipline studies the history of Christianity and the way the Christian Church has developed since its inception.

Henry Melvill Gwatkin defined church history as &quot;the spiritual side of the history of civilized people ever since our Master&#x27;s coming&quot;. A. M. Renwick, however, defines it as an account of the Church&#x27;s success and failure in carrying out Christ&#x27;s Great Commission. Renwick suggests a fourfold division of church history into missionary activity, church organization, doctrine and &quot;the effect on human life&quot;.

Church history is often, but not always, studied from a Christian perspective. Writers from different Christian traditions will often highlight people and events particularly relevant to their own denominational history. Catholic and Orthodox writers often highlight the achievements of the ecumenical councils, while evangelical historians may focus on the Protestant Reformation and the Great Awakenings.

<text>Microsoft Exchange Server is a mail server and calendaring server developed by Microsoft. It runs exclusively on Windows Server operating systems.

The first version was called Exchange Server 4.0, to position it as the successor to the related Microsoft Mail 3.5. Exchange initially used the X.400 directory service but switched to Active Directory later. Until version 5.0, it came bundled with an email client called Microsoft Exchange Client. This was discontinued in favor of Microsoft Outlook.

Exchange Server primarily uses a proprietary protocol called MAPI to talk to email clients, but subsequently added support for POP3, IMAP, and EAS. The standard SMTP protocol is used to communicate to other Internet mail servers.

Exchange Server is licensed both as on-premises software and software as a service (SaaS). In the on-premises form, customers purchase client access licenses (CALs); as SaaS, Microsoft charges a monthly service fee instead.

==History==

Microsoft had sold a number of simpler email products before, but the first release of Exchange (Exchange Server 4.0 in April 1996) was an entirely new X.400-based client–server groupware system with a single database store, which also supported X.500 directory services. The directory used by Exchange Server eventually became Microsoft&#x27;s Active Directory service, an LDAP-compliant directory service which was integrated into Windows 2000 as the foundation of Windows Server domains.

As of 2020, there have been ten releases.
===Current version===
The current version, Exchange Server 2019, was released in October 2018. Unlike other Office Server 2019 products such as SharePoint and Skype for Business, Exchange Server 2019 could only be deployed on Windows Server 2019 when it was released. Since Cumulative Update 2022 H1 Exchange 2019 has been supported on Windows Server 2022. One of the key features of the new release is that Exchange Server can be deployed onto Windows Server Core for the first time. Additionally, Microsoft has retired the Unified Messaging feature of Exchange, meaning that Skype for Business on-premises customers will have to use alternative solutions for voicemail, such as Azure cloud voicemail.

=== New features ===
*Security: support for installing Exchange Server 2019 onto Windows Server Core
*Performance: supports running Exchange Server with up to 48 processor cores and 256 GB of RAM

=== Removed features ===
*Unified Messaging

==Clustering and high availability==
Exchange Server Enterprise Edition supports clustering of up to 4 nodes when using Windows 2000 Server, and up to 8 nodes with Windows Server 2003. Exchange Server 2003 also introduced active-active clustering, but for two-node clusters only. In this setup, both servers in the cluster are allowed to be active simultaneously. This is opposed to Exchange&#x27;s more common active-passive mode in which the failover servers in any cluster node cannot be used at all while their corresponding home servers are active. They must wait, inactive, for the home servers in the node to fail. Subsequent performance issues with active-active mode have led Microsoft to recommend that it should no longer be used. In fact, support for active-active mode clustering has been discontinued with Exchange Server 2007.

Exchange&#x27;s clustering (active-active or active-passive mode) has been criticized because of its requirement for servers in the cluster nodes to share the same data. The clustering in Exchange Server provides redundancy for Exchange Server as an &quot;application&quot;, but not for Exchange &quot;data&quot;. In this scenario, the data can be regarded as a single point of failure, despite Microsoft&#x27;s description of this set-up as a &quot;Shared Nothing&quot; model. This void has however been filled by ISVs and storage manufacturers, through &quot;site resilience&quot; solutions, such as geo-clustering and asynchronous data replication. Exchange Server 2007 introduces new cluster terminology and configurations that address the shortcomings of the previous &quot;shared data model&quot;.

Exchange Server 2007 provides built-in support for asynchronous replication modeled on SQL Server&#x27;s &quot;Log shipping&quot; in CCR (Cluster Continuous Replication) clusters, which are built on MSCS MNS (Microsoft Cluster Service—Majority Node Set) clusters, which do not require shared storage. This type of cluster can be inexpensive and deployed in one, or &quot;stretched&quot; across two data centers for protection against site-wide failures such as natural disasters. The limitation of CCR clusters is the ability to have only two nodes and the third node known as &quot;voter node&quot; or file share witness that prevents &quot;split brain&quot; scenarios, generally hosted as a file share on a Hub Transport Server. The second type of cluster is the traditional clustering that was available in previous versions, and is now being referred to as SCC (Single Copy Cluster). In Exchange Server 2007 deployment of both CCR and SCC clusters has been simplified and improved; the entire cluster install process takes place during Exchange Server installation. LCR or Local Continuous Replication has been referred to as the &quot;poor man&#x27;s cluster&quot;. It is designed to allow for data replication to an alternative drive attached to the same system and is intended to provide protection against local storage failures. It does not protect against the case where the server itself fails.

In November 2007, Microsoft released SP1 for Exchange Server 2007. This service pack includes an additional high-availability feature called SCR (Standby Continuous Replication). Unlike CCR, which requires that both servers belong to a Windows cluster typically residing in the same datacenter, SCR can replicate data to a non-clustered server, located in a separate datacenter.

With Exchange Server 2010, Microsoft introduced the concept of the Database Availability Group (DAG). A DAG contains Mailbox servers that become members of the DAG. Once a Mailbox server is a member of a DAG, the Mailbox Databases on that server can be copied to other members of the DAG. When a Mailbox server is added to a DAG, the Failover Clustering Windows role is installed on the server and all required clustering resources are created.

==Licensing==
Like Windows Server products, Exchange Server requires client access licenses, which are different from Windows CALs. Corporate license agreements, such as the Enterprise Agreement, or EA, include Exchange Server CALs. It also comes as part of the Core CAL. Just like Windows Server and other server products from Microsoft, there is the choice to use User CALs or Device CALs. Device CALs are assigned to devices (workstation, laptop or PDA), which may be used by one or more users. User CALs, are assigned to users, allowing them to access Exchange from any device. User and Device CALs have the same price, however, they cannot be used interchangeably.

For service providers looking to host Microsoft Exchange, there is a Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA) available whereby Microsoft receives a monthly service fee instead of traditional CALs. Two types of Exchange CAL are available: Exchange CAL Standard and Exchange CAL Enterprise. The Enterprise CAL is an add-on license to the Standard CAL.

==Clients==
Microsoft Exchange Server uses a proprietary remote procedure call (RPC) protocol called MAPI/RPC, which was designed to be used by Microsoft Outlook. Clients capable of using the proprietary features of Exchange Server include Evolution, Hiri and Microsoft Outlook. Thunderbird can access Exchange server via the Owl Plugin.

Exchange Web Services (EWS), an alternative to the MAPI protocol, is a documented SOAP-based protocol introduced with Exchange Server 2007. Exchange Web Services is used by the latest version of Microsoft Entourage for Mac and Microsoft Outlook for Mac - since the release of Mac OS X Snow Leopard Mac computers running OS X include some support for this technology via Apple&#x27;s Mail application.

E-mail hosted on an Exchange Server can also be accessed using POP3, and IMAP4 protocols, using clients such as Windows Live Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Lotus Notes. These protocols must be enabled on the server. Exchange Server mailboxes can also be accessed through a web browser, using Outlook Web App (OWA). Exchange Server 2003 also featured a version of OWA for mobile devices, called Outlook Mobile Access (OMA).

Microsoft Exchange Server up to version 5.0 came bundled with Microsoft Exchange Client as the email client. After version 5.0, this was replaced by Microsoft Outlook, bundled as part of Microsoft Office 97 and later. When Outlook 97 was released, Exchange Client 5.0 was still in development and to be later released as part of Exchange Server 5.0, primarily because Outlook was only available for Windows. Later, in Exchange Server 5.5, Exchange Client was removed and Outlook was made the only Exchange client. As part of Exchange Server 5.5, Outlook was released for other platforms.

The original Windows 95 &quot;Inbox&quot; client also used MAPI and was called &quot;Microsoft Exchange&quot;. A stripped-down version of the Exchange Client that does not have support for Exchange Server was released as Windows Messaging to avoid confusion; it was included with Windows 95 OSR2, Windows 98, and Windows NT 4. It was discontinued because of the move to email standards such as SMTP, IMAP, and POP3, all of which Outlook Express supports better than Windows Messaging.

===Exchange ActiveSync===
Support for Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) was added to Microsoft Exchange Server 2003. It allows a compliant device such as a Windows Mobile device or smartphone to securely synchronize mail, contacts and other data directly with an Exchange server and has become a popular mobile access standard for businesses due to support from companies like Nokia and Apple Inc. as well as its device security and compliance features.

Support for push email was added to it with Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 2 and is supported by Windows Phone 7, the iPhone and Android phones, but notably not for Apple&#x27;s native Mail app on macOS.

Exchange ActiveSync Policies allow administrators to control which devices can connect to the organization, remotely deactivate features, and remotely wipe lost or stolen devices.

==Hosted Exchange as a service==
The complexities of managing Exchange Server—namely running both one or more Exchange Servers, plus Active Directory synchronization servers—make it attractive for organisations to purchase it as a hosted service.

===Third-party providers===
This has been possible from a number of providers for more than 10 years, but as of June 2018 is that many providers have been marketing the service as &quot;cloud computing&quot; or &quot;Software-as-a-Service&quot;. Exchange hosting allows for Microsoft Exchange Server to be running in the Internet, also referred to as the Cloud, and managed by a &quot;Hosted Exchange Server provider&quot; instead of building and deploying the system in-house.

===Exchange Online===
Exchange Online is Exchange Server delivered as a cloud service hosted by Microsoft itself. It is built on the same technologies as on-premises Exchange Server, and offers essentially the same services as third-party providers which host Exchange Server instances.

Customers can also choose to combine both on-premises and online options in a hybrid deployment. Hybrid implementations are popular for organizations that are unsure of the need or urgency to do a full transition to Exchange Online, and also allows for staggered email migration.

Hybrid tools can cover the main stack of Microsoft Exchange, Lync, SharePoint, Windows, and Active Directory servers, in addition to using replica data to report cloud user experience. 

===History===
Exchange Online was first provided as a hosted service in dedicated customer environments in 2005 to select pilot customers. Microsoft launched a multi-tenant version of Exchange Online as part of the Business Productivity Online Standard Suite in November 2008. In June 2011, as part of the commercial release of Microsoft Office 365, Exchange Online was updated with the capabilities of Exchange Server 2010.

Exchange Server 2010 was developed concurrently as a server product and for the Exchange Online service.

==Vulnerabilities and hacks==

=== 2020 ===
In February 2020, an ASP.NET vulnerability was discovered and exploited relying on a default setting allowing attackers to run arbitrary code with system privileges, only requiring a connection to the server as well as being logged into any user account which can be done through credential stuffing.

The exploit relied on all versions of Microsoft Exchange using the same static validation key to decrypt, encrypt, and validate the &#x27;View State&#x27; by default on all installations of the software and all versions of it, where the View State is used to temporarily preserve changes to an individual page as information is sent to the server. The default validation key used is therefore public knowledge, and so when this is used the validation key can be used to decrypt and falsely verify a modified View State containing commands added by an attacker.

When logged in as any user, any .ASPX page is then loaded, and by requesting both the session ID of the user login and the correct View State directly from the server, this correct View State can be deserialised and then modified to also include arbitrary code and then be falsely verified by the attacker. This modified View State is then serialised and passed back to the server in a GET request along with the session ID to show it is from a logged-in user; in legitimate use, the view state should always be returned in a POST request, and never a GET request. This combination causes the server to decrypt and run this added code with its own privileges, allowing the server to be fully compromised as any command can therefore be run.

In July 2020, Positive Technologies published research explaining how hackers can attack Microsoft Exchange Server without exploiting any vulnerabilities. It was voted into Top 10 web hacking techniques of 2020 according to PortSwigger Ltd.

===2021===

In 2021, critical zero-day exploits were discovered in Microsoft Exchange Server. Thousands of organizations have been affected by hackers using these techniques to steal information and install malicious code. Microsoft revealed that these vulnerabilities had existed for around 10 years, but were exploited only from January 2021 onwards. The attack affected the email systems of an estimated 250,000 global customers, including state and local governments, policy think tanks, academic institutions, infectious disease researchers and businesses such as law firms and defense contractors.

In a separate incident, an ongoing brute-force campaign from mid-2019 to the present (July 2021), attributed by British and American (NSA, FBI, CISA) security agencies to the GRU, uses/used publicly known Exchange vulnerabilities, as well as already-obtained account credentials and other methods, to infiltrate networks and steal data.

===2023===
In September 2023, Microsoft was notified that Microsoft Exchange is vulnerable to remote code execution including data theft attacks. Microsoft has not fixed these issues yet.

<doc id="508387" wikidata="Q941462" url="?curid=508387" title="The Bridge of San Luis Rey">
<text>The Bridge of San Luis Rey is American author Thornton Wilder&#x27;s second novel. It was first published in 1927 to worldwide acclaim. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1928, and was the best-selling work of fiction that year.

==Premise==
&quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; tells the story of several interrelated people who die in the collapse of an Inca rope bridge in Peru, and the events that lead up to their being on the bridge. A friar who witnesses the accident then goes about inquiring into the lives of the victims, seeking some sort of cosmic answer to the question of why each had to die.

== Plot ==

===Part One: Perhaps an Accident===
The first few pages of the first chapter explain the book&#x27;s basic premise: the story centers on a fictional event that happened in Peru on the road between Lima and Cuzco, at noon on Friday, July 20, 1714. A rope bridge woven by the Inca a century earlier collapsed at that particular moment, while five people were crossing it, sending them falling from a great height to their deaths in the river below. The collapse was witnessed by Brother Juniper, a Franciscan friar who was on his way to cross the bridge himself. A deeply pious man who seeks to provide some sort of empirical evidence that might prove to the world God&#x27;s Divine Providence, he sets out to interview everyone he can find who knew the five victims. Over the course of six years, he compiles a huge book of all of the evidence he gathers to show that the beginning and end of a person is all part of God&#x27;s plan for that person. Part One foretells the burning of the book that occurs at the end of the novel, but it also says that one copy of Brother Juniper&#x27;s book survives and is at the library of the University of San Marcos, where it now sits neglected.

===Part Two: the Marquesa de Montemayor; Pepita===
Part Two focuses on one of the victims of the collapse: Doña María, the Marquesa de Montemayor. The daughter of a wealthy cloth merchant, the Marquesa was an ugly child who eventually entered into an arranged marriage and bore a daughter, Clara, whom she loved dearly. Clara was indifferent to her mother, though, and became engaged to a Spanish man and moved across the ocean to Spain where she married. Doña María visits her daughter in Spain, but when they cannot get along, she returns to Lima. The only way that they can communicate comfortably is by letter, and Doña María pours her heart into her writing, which becomes so polished that her letters will be read in schools in the centuries after her lifetime.

Doña María takes as her companion Pepita, a girl raised at the Convent of Santa María Rosa de las Rosas. When she learns that her daughter is pregnant in Spain, Doña María decides to make a pilgrimage to the shrine of Santa María de Cluxambuqua to pray that the baby will be healthy and loved. Pepita goes along as company and to supervise the staff. When Doña María is out at the shrine, Pepita stays at the inn and writes a letter to her patron, the Abbess María del Pilar, complaining about her misery and loneliness. Doña María sees the letter on the table when she gets back and reads it. Later, she asks Pepita about the letter, and Pepita says she tore it up because the letter was not brave. Doña María has new insight into the ways in which her own life and love for her daughter have lacked bravery. She writes her &quot;first letter&quot; (actually Letter LVI) of courageous love to her daughter, but two days later, returning to Lima, she and Pepita are on the bridge of San Luis Rey when it collapses.

===Part Three: Esteban===
Esteban and Manuel are twins who were left at the Convent of Santa María Rosa de las Rosas as infants. The Abbess of the convent, Madre María del Pilar, developed a fondness for them as they grew up. When they became older, they decided to be scribes. They are so close that they have developed a secret language that only they understand. Their closeness becomes strained when Manuel falls in love with Camila Perichole, a famous actress.

Perichole flirts with Manuel and swears him to secrecy when she retains him to write letters to her lover, the Viceroy. Esteban has no idea of their relationship until she turns up at the twins&#x27; room one night in a hurry and has Manuel write to a matador with whom she is having an affair. Esteban encourages his brother to follow her, but instead Manuel swears that he will never see her again. Later, Manuel cuts his knee on a piece of metal and it becomes infected. The surgeon instructs Esteban to put cold compresses on the injury: the compresses are so painful that Manuel curses Esteban, though he later remembers nothing of his curses. Esteban offers to send for Perichole, but Manuel refuses. Soon after, Manuel dies.

When the Abbess comes to prepare the body, she asks Esteban his name, and he says he is Manuel. Gossip about his ensuing strange behavior spreads all over town. He goes to the theater but runs away before the Perichole can talk to him; the Abbess also tries to talk to him, but he runs away, so she sends for Captain Alvarado.

Captain Alvarado, a well-known sailor and explorer, goes to see Esteban in Cuzco and hires him to sail the world with him, far from Peru. Esteban agrees, then refuses, then acquiesces if he can get all his pay in advance to buy a present for the Abbess before he departs. That night Esteban attempts suicide but is saved by Captain Alvarado. The Captain offers to take him back to Lima to buy the present, and at the ravine spanned by the bridge of San Luis Rey, the Captain goes down to a boat that is ferrying some materials across the water. Esteban goes to the bridge and is on it when it collapses.

===Part Four: Uncle Pio; Don Jaime===
Uncle Pio acts as Camila Perichole&#x27;s valet, and, in addition, &quot;her singing-master, her coiffeur, her masseur, her reader, her errand-boy, her banker; rumor added: her father.&quot; He was born the bastard son of a Madrid aristocrat and later traveled the world engaged in a wide variety of dubious, though legal, businesses, most related to being a go-between or agent of the powerful, including (briefly) conducting interrogations for the Inquisition. His life &quot;became too complicated&quot; and he fled to Peru. He came to realize that he had just three interests in the world: independence; the constant presence of beautiful women; and the masterpieces of Spanish literature, particularly those of the theater.

He finds work as the confidential agent of the Viceroy of Peru. One day, he discovers a twelve-year-old café singer, Micaela Villegas, and takes her under his protection. Over the course of years, as they travel from tavern to tavern throughout Latin America, she grows into a beautiful and talented young woman. Uncle Pio instructs her in the etiquette of high society and goads her to greatness by expressing perpetual disappointment with her performances. She develops into Camila Perichole, the most honored actress in Lima.

After many years of success, Perichole becomes bored with the stage. The elderly Viceroy, Don Andrés, takes her as his mistress; she and Uncle Pio and the Archbishop of Peru and, eventually, Captain Alvarado meet frequently at midnight for dinner at the Viceroy&#x27;s mansion. Through it all, Uncle Pio remains faithfully devoted to her, but as Camila ages and bears three children by the Viceroy she focuses on becoming a lady rather than an actress. She avoids Uncle Pio, and when he talks to her she tells him to not use her stage name.

When a smallpox epidemic sweeps through Lima, Camila is disfigured by it. She takes her young son Don Jaime, who suffers from convulsions, to the country. Uncle Pio sees her one night trying hopelessly to cover her pockmarked face with powder; ashamed, she refuses to ever see him again. He begs her to allow him to take her son to Lima and teach the boy as he taught her. Despairing at the turn her life has taken, she reluctantly agrees. Uncle Pio and Jaime leave the next morning, and are the fourth and fifth people on the bridge of San Luis Rey when it collapses.

===Part Five: Perhaps an Intention===
Brother Juniper labors for six years on his book about the bridge collapse, talking to everyone he can find who knew the victims, trying various mathematical formulas to measure spiritual traits, with no results beyond conventionally pious generalizations. He compiles his huge book of interviews with complete faith in God&#x27;s goodness and justice, but a council pronounces his work heretical, and the book and Brother Juniper are publicly burned for their heresy.

The story then shifts back in time to the day of a funeral service for those who died in the bridge collapse. The Archbishop, the Viceroy, and Captain Alvarado are at the ceremony. At the Convent of Santa María Rosa de las Rosas, the Abbess feels, having lost Pepita and the twin brothers, that her work to help the poor and infirm will die with her. A year after the accident, Camila Perichole seeks out the Abbess to ask how she can go on, having lost her son and Uncle Pio. Camila gains comfort and insight from the Abbess and, it is later revealed, becomes a helper at the Convent. Later, Doña Clara arrives from Spain, also seeking out the Abbess to speak with her about her mother, the Marquesa de Montemayor. She is greatly moved by the work of the Abbess in caring for the deaf, the insane, and the dying. The novel ends with the Abbess&#x27; observation: &quot;There is a land of the living and a land of the dead and the bridge is love, the only survival, the only meaning.&quot;

==Themes and sources==
Thornton Wilder said that the book poses the question: &quot;Is there a direction and meaning in lives beyond the individual&#x27;s own will?&quot; Describing the sources of his novel, Wilder explained that the plot was inspired 
in its external action by a one-act play [&quot;Le Carrosse du Saint-Sacrement&quot;] by [the French playwright] Prosper Mérimée, which takes place in Latin America and one of whose characters is a courtesan. However, the central idea of the work, the justification for a number of human lives that comes up as a result of the sudden collapse of a bridge, stems from friendly arguments with my father, a strict Calvinist. Strict Puritans imagine God all too easily as a petty schoolmaster who minutely weights guilt against merit, and they overlook God&#x27;s &#x27;Caritas&#x27; which is more all-encompassing and powerful. God&#x27;s love has to transcend his just retribution. But in my novel I have left this question unanswered. As I said earlier, we can only pose the question correctly and clearly, and have faith one will ask the question in the right way.

When asked if his characters were historical or imagined, Wilder replied, &quot;The Perichole and the Viceroy are real people, under the names they had in history [a street singer named Micaela Villegas and her lover Manuel de Amat y Junyent, who was Viceroy of Peru at the time]. Most of the events were invented by me, including the fall of the bridge.&quot; He based the Marquesa&#x27;s habit of writing letters to her daughter on his knowledge of the great French letter-writer Madame de Sévigné.

The bridge itself is based on the great Inca road suspension bridge across the Apurímac River, erected around 1350, still in use in 1864, and dilapidated but still hanging in 1890. When asked by the explorer Victor Wolfgang von Hagen whether he had ever seen a reproduction of E. G. Squier&#x27;s woodcut illustration of the bridge as it was in 1864, Wilder replied: &quot;It is best, von Hagen, that I make no comment or point of it.&quot; In fact, in a letter to Yale professor Chauncey Tinker, Wilder wrote that he had invented the bridge altogether. The name of the bridge is drawn from the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia in San Diego County, California.

== Recognition and influence ==
&quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; won the 1928 Pulitzer Prize for the Novel, and remains widely acclaimed as Wilder&#x27;s most famous novel. In 1998, the book was rated number 37 by the editorial board of the American Modern Library on the list of the 100 best 20th-century novels. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its &quot;TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005&quot;.

=== Influences ===

* In the 1941 novel &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight&quot; by Vladimir Nabokov, the narrator, V, finds the book in his brother Sebastian&#x27;s library.
* The book is mentioned in Elizabeth Goudge&#x27;s war-time novel &quot;The Castle on the Hill&quot; (1942, Chapter I, Part II), where a major character explains that, &quot;... in this case death came to those five just at the most fitting moment of their lives, and that this so-called tragedy, as it affected the lives of others, brought alterations in the pattern [of life] that spelled in the long run only blessing and peace&quot;: this character, an elderly historian, is attempting to offer consolation to a woman he has just met whose life has been full of personal tragedy and war-time disaster.
* &quot;Qui non riposano&quot;, a 1945 novel by Indro Montanelli, takes inspiration from the book.
* The book was cited by American writer John Hersey as a direct inspiration for his nonfiction work &quot;Hiroshima&quot; (1946).
* Ayn Rand references the theme in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; (1957), her epic of a fictional decline of the United States into an impoverished kleptocracy. In the aftermath of a disastrous collision in a railroad tunnel, she highlights train passengers who, in one way or another, promoted the moral climate that made the accident likely.
* The book is mentioned in passing by a character in &quot;The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands&quot; (1991), the third book in Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series.
* David Mitchell&#x27;s novels &quot;Ghostwritten&quot; (1999) and &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; (2004) echo the story in many ways, most explicitly through the character Luisa Rey.
* The book is mentioned in the American television series &quot;Monk&quot;, season one (2002–03) episode 11, &quot;Mr Monk and the Earthquake&quot;.
* A line from the book is paraphrased on the cover of Sea Power&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;The Decline of British Sea Power&quot;. Appearing on the album cover as &quot;There is a land for the living and there is a land for the dead...&quot;, it was written by Wilder as &quot;There is a land of the living and a land of the dead...&quot;
* The Australian television series &quot;Glitch&quot; references the book in an episode from its second season (2007), and quotes the passage &quot;There is a land of the living and a land of the dead and the bridge is love, the only survival, the only meaning.&quot;
* The book is referred to in the novel &quot;Numero Zero&quot; (2015), by Umberto Eco.
* The book is mentioned in passing by a character in Joe Hill&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;The Fireman&quot;.

<doc id="508390" wikidata="Q2126262" url="?curid=508390" title="Brownian motor">
<text>Brownian motors are nanoscale or molecular machines that use chemical reactions to generate directed motion in space. The theory behind Brownian motors relies on the phenomenon of Brownian motion, random motion of particles suspended in a fluid (a liquid or a gas) resulting from their collision with the fast-moving molecules in the fluid.

On the nanoscale (1–100 nm), viscosity dominates inertia, and the extremely high degree of thermal noise in the environment makes conventional directed motion all but impossible, because the forces impelling these motors in the desired direction are minuscule when compared to the random forces exerted by the environment. Brownian motors operate specifically to utilise this high level of random noise to achieve directed motion, and as such are only viable on the nanoscale.

The concept of Brownian motors is a recent one, having only been coined in 1995 by Peter Hänggi, but the existence of such motors in nature may have existed for a very long time and help to explain crucial cellular processes that require movement at the nanoscale, such as protein synthesis and muscular contraction. If this is the case, Brownian motors may have implications for the foundations of life itself.

In more recent times, humans have attempted to apply this knowledge of natural Brownian motors to solve human problems. The applications of Brownian motors are most obvious in nanorobotics due to its inherent reliance on directed motion.

== History ==

=== 20th century ===

The term &quot;Brownian motor&quot; was originally invented by Swiss theoretical physicist Peter Hänggi in 1995. The Brownian motor, like the phenomenon of Brownian motion that underpinned its underlying theory, was also named after 19th century Scottish botanist Robert Brown, who, while looking through a microscope at pollen of the plant &quot;Clarkia pulchella&quot; immersed in water, famously described the random motion of pollen particles in water in 1827. In 1905, almost eighty years later, theoretical physicist Albert Einstein published a paper where he modeled the motion of the pollen as being moved by individual water molecules, and this was verified experimentally by Jean Perrin in 1908, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926 &quot;for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter&quot;. These developments helped to create the fundamentals of the present theories of the nanoscale world.

Nanoscience has traditionally long remained at the intersection of the physical sciences of physics and chemistry, but more recent developments in research increasingly position it beyond the scope of either of these two traditional fields.

=== 21st century ===
In 2002, a seminal paper on Brownian motors published in the American Institute of Physics magazine &quot;Physics Today&quot;, &quot;Brownian motors&quot;, by Dean Astumian and Peter Hänggi. There, they proposed the then novel concept of Brownian motors and posited that &quot;thermal motion combined with input energy gives rise to a channeling of chance that can be used to exercise control over microscopic systems&quot;. Astumian and Hänggi provide in their paper a copy of Wallace Stevens&#x27; 1919 poem &quot;The Place of the Solitaires&quot; to elegantly illustrate, from an abstract perspective, the ceaseless nature of noise.

A year after the Astumian-Hänggi paper, David Leigh&#x27;s organic chemistry group reported the first artificial molecular Brownian motors. In 2007 the same team reported a Maxwell&#x27;s demon-inspired molecular information ratchet.

Another important demonstration of nanoengineering and nanotechnology was the building of a practical artificial Brownian motor by IBM in 2018. Specifically, an energy landscape was created by accurately shaping a nanofluidic slit, and alternate potentials and an oscillating electric field were then used to &quot;rock&quot; nanoparticles to produce directed motion. The experiment successfully made the nanoparticles move along a track in the shape of the outline of the IBM logo and serves as an important milestone in the practical use of Brownian motors and other elements at the nanoscale.Additionally, various institutions around the world, such as the University of Sydney Nano Institute, headquartered at the Sydney Nanoscience Hub (SNH), and the Swiss Nanoscience Institute (SNI) at the University of Basel, are examples of the research activity emerging in the field of nanoscience. Brownian motors remain a central concept in both the understanding of natural molecular motors and the construction of useful nanoscale machines that involve directed motion.

== Theory ==

The thermal noise on the nanoscale is so great that moving in a particular direction is as difficult as &quot;walking in a hurricane&quot; or &quot;swimming in molasses&quot;. The theoretical operation of the Brownian motor can be explained by ratchet theory, wherein strong random thermal fluctuations are allowed to move the particle in the desired direction, while energy is expended to counteract forces that would produce motion in the opposite direction. This motion can be both linear and rotational. In the biological sense and in the extent to which this phenomenon appears in nature, this exists as chemical energy is sourced from the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

The Brownian ratchet is an apparent perpetual motion machine that appears to violate the second law of thermodynamics, but was later debunked upon more detailed analysis by Richard Feynman and other physicists. The difference between real Brownian motors and fictional Brownian ratchets is that only in Brownian motors is there an input of energy in order to provide the necessary force to hold the motor in place to counteract the thermal noise that try to move the motor in the opposite direction.

Because Brownian motors rely on the random nature of thermal noise to achieve directed motion, they are stochastic in nature, in that they can be analysed statistically but not predicted precisely.

== Examples in nature ==
In biology, much of what we understand to be protein-based molecular motors may also in fact be Brownian motors. These molecular motors facilitate critical cellular processes in living organisms and, indeed, are fundamental to life itself.

Researchers have made significant advances in terms of examining these organic processes to gain insight into their inner workings. For example, molecular Brownian motors in the form of several different types of protein exist within humans. Two common biomolecular Brownian motors are ATP synthase, a rotary motor, and myosin II, a linear motor. The motor protein ATP synthase produces rotational torque that facilitates the synthesis of ATP from Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) through the following overall reaction:

ADP + Pi + 3H+out ⇌ ATP + H2O + 3H+in

In contrast, the torque produced by myosin II is linear and is a basis for the process of muscle contraction. Similar motor proteins include kinesin and dynein, which all convert chemical energy into mechanical work by the hydrolysis of ATP. Many motor proteins within human cells act as Brownian motors by producing directed motion on the nanoscale, and some common proteins of this type are illustrated by the following computer-generated images.

== Applications ==

=== Nanorobotics ===
The relevance of Brownian motors to the requirement of directed motion in nanorobotics has become increasingly apparent to researchers from both academia and industry.

Artificial replications of Brownian motors are informed by and differ from nature, and one specific type is the photomotor, wherein the motor switches states due to pulses of light and generates directed motion. These photomotors, in contrast to their natural counterpartsˇ, are inorganic and possess greater efficiency and average velocity, and are thus better suited to human use than existing alternatives, such as organic protein motors.

Currently, one of the six current &quot;Grand Challenges&quot; of the University of Sydney Nano Institute is to develop nanorobotics for health, a key aspect of which is a &quot;nanoscale parts foundry&quot; that can produce nanoscale Brownian motors for &quot;active transport around the body&quot;. The institute predicts that among the implications of this research is a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; in healthcare &quot;away from the &quot;break-fix&quot; model to a focus on prevention and early intervention,&quot; such as in the case with heart disease:

Professor Paul Bannon, an adult cardiothoracic surgeon of international standing and leading medical researcher, summarises the benefits of nanorobotics in health.

<text>Jacob Benjamin Gyllenhaal ( , ; born December 19, 1980) is an American actor who has worked on screen and stage for over thirty years. Born into the Gyllenhaal family, he is the son of film director Stephen Gyllenhaal and screenwriter Naomi Foner, and the younger brother of actress Maggie Gyllenhaal. He began acting as a child, making his debut in &quot;City Slickers&quot; (1991), followed by roles in his father&#x27;s films &quot;A Dangerous Woman&quot; (1993) and &quot;Homegrown&quot; (1998). His breakthrough roles were as Homer Hickam in the biopic &quot;October Sky&quot; (1999) and a troubled teenager in the thriller &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001). Gyllenhaal expanded to big-budget films with a starring role in the 2004 disaster film &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;. 

Gyllenhaal played Jack Twist in Ang Lee&#x27;s 2005 romantic drama &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, for which he won a BAFTA Award and was nominated for an Academy Award. His career progressed with starring roles in the thriller &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007), the romantic comedy &quot;Love &amp; Other Drugs&quot; (2010), and the science fiction film &quot;Source Code&quot; (2011). Further acclaim came with his roles in Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s thrillers &quot;Prisoners&quot; (2013) and &quot;Enemy&quot; (2013), and he received nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performances as a manipulative journalist in &quot;Nightcrawler&quot; (2014) and a troubled writer in &quot;Nocturnal Animals&quot; (2016). His highest-grossing release came with the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero film &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019), in which he portrayed Mysterio. After playing a supporting role in the drama &quot;Wildlife&quot; (2018), Gyllenhaal starred in action or thriller projects, including the films &quot;The Guilty&quot; (2021), &quot;Ambulance&quot; (2022) and &quot;Road House&quot; (2024), as well as the series &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; (2024).

Gyllenhaal has performed on stage, starring in a West End production of the play &quot;This Is Our Youth&quot; (2002) and Broadway productions of the musical &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; (2017) as well as the plays &quot;Constellations&quot; (2014) and &quot;Sea Wall/A Life&quot; (2019), the last of which earned him a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. Aside from acting, he is vocal about political and social issues.

==Life and career==
===1980–2000: Early life and career beginnings===
Jacob Benjamin Gyllenhaal was born on December 19, 1980, in Los Angeles, California, United States, to screenwriter Naomi Foner () and film director Stephen Gyllenhaal. Actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, his older sister, appeared with him in the science fiction psychological thriller film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001). Gyllenhaal&#x27;s father, who was raised as a Swedenborgian, is a Christian of Swedish and English descent and is a descendant of the Swedish noble Gyllenhaal family. His last ancestor to be born in Sweden was his great-great-grandfather, Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal&#x27;s mother is Jewish, and was born in New York City into an Ashkenazi Jewish family from Russia and Poland. Gyllenhaal has said that he considers himself Jewish. On his 13th birthday, Gyllenhaal performed a &quot;Bar Mitzvah-like act, without the typical trappings&quot;, volunteering at a homeless shelter because his parents wanted to give him a sense of gratitude for his privileged lifestyle.

As a child, Gyllenhaal was regularly exposed to filmmaking due to his family&#x27;s ties to the industry. He made his acting debut as Billy Crystal&#x27;s son in the 1991 comedy &quot;City Slickers&quot;. His parents did not allow him to appear in &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; (1992) because it would have required him to leave home for two months. In subsequent years, his parents allowed him to audition for roles but regularly forbade him to take them if he were chosen. He was allowed to appear in his father&#x27;s films several times. Gyllenhaal appeared in the 1993&#x27;s &quot;A Dangerous Woman&quot; (along with sister Maggie), in &quot;Bop Gun&quot;, a 1994 episode of &quot;&quot;; and in the 1998 comedy &quot;Homegrown&quot;. Along with their mother, Jake and Maggie appeared in two episodes of &quot;Molto Mario&quot;, an Italian cooking show on the Food Network. Prior to his senior year in high school, the only other film not directed by his father in which Gyllenhaal was allowed to perform was the 1993 film &quot;Josh and S.A.M.&quot;, a little-known children&#x27;s adventure.

His parents insisted that he have summer jobs to support himself, and he thus worked as a lifeguard and as a busboy at a restaurant operated by a family friend. Gyllenhaal said his parents encouraged artistic expression: &quot;I do have parents who constantly supported me in certain ways. In other ways, they were lacking. Definitely, it&#x27;s in expression and creativity where my family has always been best at.&quot; Gyllenhaal graduated from the Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles in 1998, then attended Columbia University, where his sister was a senior and from which his mother had graduated, to study Eastern religions and philosophy. At Columbia, he was a resident of John Jay Hall. Gyllenhaal dropped out after two years to concentrate on acting but has expressed intentions to eventually finish his degree. Gyllenhaal&#x27;s first lead role was in &quot;October Sky&quot;, Joe Johnston&#x27;s 1999 adaptation of the Homer Hickam autobiography &quot;Rocket Boys&quot;, in which he portrayed a young man from West Virginia striving to win a science scholarship to avoid becoming a coal miner. The film was positively received and earned $32 million; it was described in the &quot;Sacramento News and Review&quot; as Gyllenhaal&#x27;s &quot;breakout performance&quot;.

===2001–2004: &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; to the London stage===
&quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, in which Gyllenhaal played his second lead role on film, was not a box office success on its initial 2001 release; eventually, the film became a cult favorite. Directed by Richard Kelly, the film is set in 1988 and stars Gyllenhaal as a troubled teenager who experiences visions of a tall rabbit named Frank who tells him that the world is coming to an end. Gyllenhaal&#x27;s performance was well received by critics; Gary Mairs of &quot;Culture Vulture&quot; wrote that he &quot;manages the difficult trick of seeming both blandly normal and profoundly disturbed, often within the same scene.&quot;

Gyllenhaal&#x27;s next role was as Pilot Kelston in 2002&#x27;s &quot;Highway&quot; alongside Jared Leto. His performance was described by one critic as &quot;silly, clichéd and straight to video&quot;. Gyllenhaal had more success starring opposite Jennifer Aniston in &quot;The Good Girl&quot;, which premiered at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival; he also starred in &quot;Lovely and Amazing&quot; with Catherine Keener. In both films he plays an unstable character who begins a reckless affair with an older woman. Gyllenhaal later described these as &quot;teenager in transition&quot; roles. Gyllenhaal later starred in the Touchstone Pictures romantic comedy &quot;Bubble Boy&quot;, which was loosely based on the story of David Vetter. The film portrays the title character&#x27;s adventures as he pursues the love of his life before she marries the wrong man. The film was panned by critics, with one calling it &quot;stupid and devoid of any redeeming features&quot;.

Following &quot;Bubble Boy&quot;, Gyllenhaal starred opposite Dustin Hoffman, Susan Sarandon and Ellen Pompeo in &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot; (2002), as a young man coping with the death of his fiancée and the grief of her parents. The story, which received mixed reviews, is loosely based on writer-director Brad Silberling&#x27;s personal experiences following the murder of his girlfriend, Rebecca Schaeffer. In his theatrical debut, Gyllenhaal starred on the London stage in Kenneth Lonergan&#x27;s revival of &quot;This Is Our Youth&quot; at the Garrick Theatre in 2002. Gyllenhaal said, &quot;Every actor I look up to has done theatre work, so I knew I had to give it a try.&quot; The play ran for eight weeks in London&#x27;s West End; Gyllenhaal received favorable reviews and an Evening Standard Theatre Award in the Outstanding Newcomer category.

Gyllenhaal was almost cast as Spider-Man for 2004&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, due to director Sam Raimi&#x27;s concerns about original &quot;Spider-Man&quot; star Tobey Maguire&#x27;s health. Maguire recovered, however, and the sequel was shot without Gyllenhaal. The actors later starred together in &quot;Brothers&quot; (2009), and resemble each other enough that Gyllenhaal has jokingly complained about cab drivers often calling him &quot;Spider-Man.&quot; In 2003, he also auditioned for the role of Batman in the superhero film &quot;Batman Begins&quot; and came close being offered the part, but it was given to Christian Bale. Gyllenhaal subsequently appeared in the science fiction blockbuster &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; in 2004, co-starring Dennis Quaid as his father.

===2005–2011: &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; and leading roles===
In 2005, Gyllenhaal was cast in the drama &quot;Proof&quot;, with co-stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins, where he played a graduate student in mathematics who tries to convince Paltrow&#x27;s character to publish a revolutionary proof to a problem puzzling the mathematicians&#x27; community. The film received a generally positive response. He also starred in Sam Mendes&#x27;s &quot;Jarhead&quot;, where Gyllenhaal played a U.S. Marine during the first Gulf War. The film garnered a favorable response; Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praises Gyllenhaal&#x27;s performance, writing, &quot;He makes us see his character&#x27;s intelligence&quot;, adding &quot;he doesn&#x27;t seem jealous of the camera&#x27;s attention when it goes to others&quot;.

In &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005), Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger play young men who meet as sheep herders and embark upon a sexual relationship that begins in the summer of 1963 and lasts for 20 years. The film was often referred to in the media with the shorthand phrase &quot;the gay cowboy movie&quot;, although there was differing opinion on the sexual orientation of the characters. The film won numerous accolades, including the Golden Lion prize at the Venice Film Festival. The film won three Academy Awards, and earned Gyllenhaal a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but he lost to George Clooney for &quot;Syriana&quot;. The film also won four Golden Globes, and four British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs), in which Gyllenhaal won for Best Supporting Actor. He and Ledger won an MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss in 2006. Shortly after the 2006 Academy Awards, Gyllenhaal was invited to join the Academy in recognition of his acting career.

Gyllenhaal expressed mixed feelings about the experience of being directed by Ang Lee in &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; but generally had more praise than criticism for his directorial style. While critical of the way Lee tended to disconnect from his actors once filming began, Gyllenhaal praised his encouraging direction of the actors and sensitive approach to the material. At the Directors Guild of America Awards on January 28, 2006, Gyllenhaal also praised Lee for &quot;his humbleness and his respect for everyone around him&quot;. When asked about his kissing scenes with Ledger in &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, Gyllenhaal said, &quot;As an actor, I think we need to embrace the times we feel most uncomfortable.&quot; When asked about the more intimate scenes with Ledger, Gyllenhaal likened them to &quot;doing a sex scene with a woman I&#x27;m not particularly attracted to&quot;. Following the release of &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, rumors circulated regarding the actor&#x27;s sexual orientation. When asked about such gossip during an interview, Gyllenhaal said: 

Gyllenhaal narrated the 2005 short animated film &quot;The Man Who Walked Between the Towers&quot;, based on Mordicai Gerstein&#x27;s book of the same name about Philippe Petit&#x27;s famous stunt. In January 2007, as host of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, he put on a sparkly evening dress and sang &quot;And I Am Telling You I&#x27;m Not Going&quot; from the musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; for his opening monologue, dedicating the song to his &quot;unique fan base... the fans of &quot;Brokeback&quot;&quot;. Later, Gyllenhaal starred in David Fincher&#x27;s mystery thriller &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007), based on the Zodiac Killer. He played Robert Graysmith, a &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; political cartoonist. In preparation for his role, Gyllenhaal met Graysmith, and videotaped him to study his mannerisms and behavior. The film received a positive response; writing for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Paul Byrnes opined that it was &quot;poignant, provocative and haunting&quot;, and called Gyllenhaal &quot;terrific&quot;. He next starred opposite Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Reese Witherspoon in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Rendition&quot;, a Gavin Hood-directed political thriller about the U.S. policy of extraordinary rendition. Although it garnered a mixed response, &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s David Edelstein called Gyllenhaal &quot;compelling ... he&#x27;s a reticent actor. But he builds that limitation into the character&quot;. Two years later, he co-starred with Tobey Maguire and Natalie Portman in Jim Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;Brothers&quot;, a 2009 remake of Susanne Bier&#x27;s Danish film of the same name. It was met with mixed reviews and moderate box office returns, but Anthony Quinn of &quot;The Independent&quot; thought Gyllenhaal and Maguire gave &quot;honest performances&quot;. Gyllenhaal has also claimed that Maguire&#x27;s performance in the film influenced his acting throughout his career.

The following year, Gyllenhaal played the lead role in &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot;, an adaptation of the video game of the same name, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and released by Disney. He starred opposite Anne Hathaway in the romantic-comedy&quot; Love &amp; Other Drugs&quot;, released on November 24, 2010, which gained him a Golden Globe Award nomination. &quot;The Guardian&quot; Philip French welcomed Gyllenhaal&#x27;s choice of a comic role, in contrast to his previous film roles, but thought the film &quot;stumbles badly&quot;. For his sole project in 2011, he portrayed Colter Stevens, a U.S. Army Aviation captain, in the 2011 time-travel thriller &quot;Source Code&quot;. Despite noting the film&#x27;s unrealistic plot, Peter Howell of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; praised the prime performances of the cast.

===2012–2018: Critical acclaim and Broadway debut===
Gyllenhaal starred alongside Michael Peña in David Ayer&#x27;s action thriller &quot;End of Watch&quot;, about two Los Angeles street cops. The film, for which Gyllenhaal was also an executive producer, was released in September 2012 and received positive reviews, with Roger Ebert deeming it &quot;one of the best police movies in recent years, a virtuoso fusion of performances and often startling action&quot; and &quot;Salon&quot;″s Andrew O&#x27;Hehir stating that the film was &quot;at least the best cop movie since James Gray&#x27;s &quot;We Own the Night&quot;, and very likely since Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s memorable &quot;Training Day&quot; (which, not coincidentally, was written by Ayer)&quot;. To prepare for the role, Gyllenhaal took tactical training and participated in actual police ride-alongs with co-star Peña to help establish the language of the characters.

He served as a jury member for the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival that was held in February 2012. Also in 2012, Gyllenhaal made his Off-Broadway debut in Nick Payne&#x27;s play &quot;If There Is I Haven&#x27;t Found It Yet&quot; at the Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s Laura Pels Theatre. 2013 saw Gyllenhaal appear in two films directed by Denis Villeneuve, whom Gyllenhaal describes as &quot;an older brother&quot;. The first, the thriller &quot;Prisoners&quot;, starred Gyllenhaal as a detective named Loki in search of the abductor of two young girls. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Peter Travers praised Gyllenhaal&#x27;s &quot;exceptional&quot; performance in the film. In their second collaboration, Gyllenhaal portrayed the dual role of a history teacher and his doppelgänger in the thriller &quot;Enemy&quot;. The following year, he produced and starred in the crime thriller &quot;Nightcrawler&quot;, earning Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for his performance. Ben Sachs of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; called Gyllenhaal&#x27;s performance &quot;attention-grabbing&quot; and said that he &quot;creates a memorable screen presence&quot;.

Gyllenhaal debuted on Broadway in Payne&#x27;s &quot;Constellations&quot; at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre opposite Ruth Wilson, also in her Broadway debut. The production opened in January 2015 and closed in March of the same year. That same year, he starred in the comedy &quot;Accidental Love&quot;, which was filmed in South Carolina with Jessica Biel, as well as Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s sports drama &quot;Southpaw&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Independent&quot;, Geoffrey Macnab called his portrayal of a boxer in &quot;Southpaw&quot; &quot;plausible&quot; and complimented his &quot;emotional vulnerability&quot;, despite an unoriginal plot. He then portrayed Scott Fischer in Baltasar Kormákur&#x27;s &quot;Everest&quot;, based on the 1996 Mount Everest disaster; the film was a commercial success, grossing $203 million worldwide. Finally, he appeared in Jean-Marc Vallée&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Demolition&quot;, playing an investment banker Davis Mitchell, who rebuilds his life after losing his wife. &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Bilge Ebiri praised his performance, writing, &quot;He nails Davis&#x27;s boyish curiosity, the quiet, wide-eyed uncertainty of someone discovering the world for the first time.&quot; He also served as a jury member for the main competition of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2016, he starred in Tom Ford&#x27;s neo-noir thriller &quot;Nocturnal Animals&quot;, based on the 1993 novel &quot;Tony and Susan&quot; by Austin Wright. The film received positive reviews. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;″s Sandra Hall praised Gyllenhaal&#x27;s brilliant portrayal of his two roles, while Justin Chang of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that his performance contained &quot;rich emotional shadings&quot; and escalating intensity that becomes overwhelming. In October 2016, he appeared in four benefit concert performances of the Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine musical &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; at the New York City Center as the titular character. Alexis Soloski of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the performance a perfect five-star review and hailed Gyllenhaal&#x27;s superb singing. Starting in February 2017, Gyllenhaal reprised the role at the reopened Hudson Theatre on Broadway. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised his &quot;searing theatrical presence, in which his eyes are his center of gravity.&quot; He was scheduled to appear in Lanford Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Burn This&quot; on Broadway under the direction of Michael Mayer in 2017. However, a new production of &quot;Burn This&quot; took place in 2019 with Adam Driver appearing, with Gyllenhaal&#x27;s production having reportedly been abandoned.

In 2017, Gyllenhaal starred as astronaut David Jordan in the science fiction horror film &quot;Life&quot;; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Eric Henderson stated that Gyllenhaal was &quot;dead behind the eyes from his first scene&quot;. He also had a supporting role in the action-adventure film &quot;Okja&quot; and starred in the drama &quot;Stronger&quot;, based on Boston Marathon bombing survivor Jeff Bauman. In his review of the latter, &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Geoffrey Macnab complimented Gyllenhaal&#x27;s versatility and &quot;outstanding&quot; portrayal of Bauman. The following year, he co-starred in the drama &quot;Wildlife&quot; opposite Carey Mulligan, in which he plays a father who temporarily abandons his family to take a dangerous job. It is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Richard Ford. Ella Kemp, writing for &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine, praised the chemistry of the lead actors which &quot;fizzes with an effortless dynamism&quot;. He also had a role in the Western drama &quot;The Sisters Brothers&quot; (2018).

===2019–present: Action and thriller films===
Gyllenhaal reunited with &quot;Nightcrawler&quot; director Dan Gilroy in the thriller film &quot;Velvet Buzzsaw&quot;, in which he plays art critic Mort Vandewalt. The film premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival and was distributed by Netflix. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Peter Debrudge opined that Gyllenhaal was &quot;relishing another of those cartoonishly camp performances&quot;. That same year, Gyllenhaal played comic book villain Mysterio / Quentin Beck in the superhero film &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;, set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was one of the highest-grossing films of the year. He appeared alongside Tom Sturridge in &quot;Sea Wall/A Life&quot;, a double bill of monologues by Nick Payne and Simon Stephens, at the Hudson Theatre on Broadway in 2019. He garnered a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Play for his performance. Gyllenhaal also lent his voice for the animation &quot;Spirit Untamed&quot; (2021). That same year, he played detective Joe Baylor in the crime thriller &quot;The Guilty&quot;, a remake of the Danish film of the same name. 

In 2022, he starred as a criminal in Michael Bay&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Ambulance;&quot; the film received mixed reviews from critics. Gyllenhaal also voiced a farmer in the Disney animation &quot;Strange World&quot;. He appeared in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;The Covenant&quot; (2023) and Doug Liman&#x27;s action film &quot;Road House&quot; (2024). Following the success of &quot;Road House&quot;, his production company, Nine Stories, signed a first-look deal with Amazon MGM Studios.
In 2024 it was announced that Gyllenhaal would return to Broadway playing Iago in the 2025 revival of William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Othello&quot; starring opposite Denzel Washington. In June 2024, he joined the cast of the upcoming science fiction monster film &quot;The Bride!&quot; in an undisclosed role.

==Public image==
Gyllenhaal was named one of &quot;People&quot; &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; in 2006. He was also listed in &quot;People&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Hottest Bachelors of 2006&quot;. In April 2012, &quot;Shalom Life&quot; ranked him number six on its list of &quot;the 50 most talented, intelligent, funny, and gorgeous Jewish men in the world&quot;. He was ranked number 35 in &quot;Empire&quot; poll of The 100 Sexiest Movie Stars in 2013. In another poll conducted by &quot;Glamour&quot;, Gyllenhaal was selected as one of the Sexiest Men of The Year 2018.

==Personal life==
===Family and relationships===

Gyllenhaal&#x27;s sister Maggie is married to actor Peter Sarsgaard, Gyllenhaal&#x27;s co-star in &quot;Jarhead&quot; and &quot;Rendition&quot;. In December 2006, Gyllenhaal and his sister escaped a fire that destroyed Manka&#x27;s Inverness Lodge, a famed lodge and restaurant in Inverness, California, at which they were vacationing. The two were among a dozen or so guests who fled after the fire, sparked by a falling tree, broke out at about 3 a.m. Co-owner and celebrity chef Daniel DeLong said the pair were supportive despite having to brave the wind and cold. &quot;Jake was helping me pull things out of the fire,&quot; DeLong said.

Gyllenhaal has godparents whom he describes as &quot;celebrity godparents.&quot; Actor and director Paul Newman was his godfather, and actress Jamie Lee Curtis is his godmother. Other godparents of unknown status include a gay couple and cinematographer Robert Elswit. Gyllenhaal is the godfather of Matilda Rose Ledger (born October 28, 2005), daughter of his &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; co-stars Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams.

Gyllenhaal began dating actress Kirsten Dunst in 2002 after his sister Maggie, who starred with Dunst in &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot;, introduced them; they eventually broke up in 2004 on friendly terms. He dated his &quot;Rendition&quot; co-star Reese Witherspoon from 2007 until 2009. He dated singer-songwriter Taylor Swift from October 2010 to January 2011, and model Alyssa Miller from July to December 2013. Gyllenhaal has been in a relationship with French model Jeanne Cadieu since late 2018.

===Political views and other interests===
Gyllenhaal once filmed a commercial for Rock the Vote and, along with his sister, visited the University of Southern California to urge students to vote in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. He also campaigned for Democratic Party presidential nominee John Kerry. He has said that &quot;it frustrates me when actors talk politics; I&#x27;m political and I make choices in my movies that I think are political. I try and say things with what I do. Rightly or wrongly, young actors have all the power.&quot; In an interview, he remarked that &quot;it&#x27;s a sad time when actors are politicians and politicians are actors&quot;. In the 2018 midterm elections, Gyllenhaal endorsed U.S. Senate candidate Beto O&#x27;Rourke. His endorsement came in the form of a Facebook post that included a picture of him in a &quot;BETO&quot; shirt and a caption that also endorsed Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum, Kyrsten Sinema, and Jacky Rosen in their respective Senate or gubernatorial elections.

Gyllenhaal recycles regularly, and said in an interview that he spends $400 a year to have trees planted in a Mozambique forest, partly to promote the Future Forests program. After filming &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;, he flew to the Arctic to promote awareness of climate change. He has described climate activist Greta Thunberg as an inspiring figure.

In 2003, Gyllenhaal participated in an advertising campaign by the American Civil Liberties Union. Gyllenhaal is the Honorary Chair of the New Eyes for the Needy Advisory Board, and has signed on to help the TV fundraiser Stand Up to Cancer. Gyllenhaal is on the board of directors for the Anti-Recidivism Coalition and volunteered in California juvenile detention centers with Scott Budnick. In 2014, Gyllenhaal attended an event that benefited the Headstrong Project, an organization that provides treatment to military veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, during which he read a poem by a veteran, and in 2017 he participated in a fundraiser to help survivors who lost limbs during the September 11 attacks in 2001. Gyllenhaal has studied Buddhism and has said, &quot;I am not a card-carrying Buddhist, but I do try to practice mindfulness&quot; and that it is his goal to meditate every day.

==Acting credits and awards==
Gyllenhaal&#x27;s most acclaimed films, according to the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, include &quot;October Sky&quot; (1999), &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001), &quot;Lovely &amp; Amazing&quot; (2002), &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005), &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007), &quot;Source Code&quot; (2011), &quot;End of Watch&quot; (2012), &quot;Nightcrawler&quot; (2014), and &quot;Stronger&quot; (2017).

<text>Antoine-Marin Lemierre (12 January 17334 July 1793) was a French dramatist and poet.

==Life==
He was born in Paris, into a poor family, but found a patron in the collector-general of taxes, Dupin, whose secretary he became. Lemierre gained his first success on the stage with &quot;Hypermnestre&quot; (1758); &quot;Titre&quot; (1761) and &quot;Idomne&quot; (1764) failed on account of the subjects. &quot;Artaxerce&quot;, modelled on &quot;Metastasio&quot;, and &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; were produced in 1766; other successful tragedies were &quot;La Veuve de Malabar&quot; (1770) and &quot;Barnavelt&quot; (1784). He was admitted to the Académie française in 1780.

Lemierre revived &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; in 1786 with enormous success. After the French Revolution he professed great remorse for the production of a play inculcating revolutionary principles, and there is no doubt that the horror of the excesses he witnessed hastened his death. Lemierre published &quot;La Peinture&quot; (1769), based on a Latin poem by the abbé de Marsy, and a poem in six cantos. &quot;Les Fastes, ou les usages de lannie&quot; (1779), an unsatisfactory imitation of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot;.

His &quot;Œuvres&quot; (1810) contain a notice of Lemierre by R. Perrin. and his &quot;Œuvres choisies&quot; (1811) contain one by F. Fayolle.

<doc id="508401" wikidata="Q504453" url="?curid=508401" title="Apache Groovy">
<text>Apache Groovy is a Java-syntax-compatible object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. It is both a static and dynamic language with features similar to those of Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk. It can be used as both a programming language and a scripting language for the Java Platform, is compiled to Java virtual machine (JVM) bytecode, and interoperates seamlessly with other Java code and libraries. Groovy uses a curly-bracket syntax similar to Java&#x27;s. Groovy supports closures, multiline strings, and expressions embedded in strings. Much of Groovy&#x27;s power lies in its AST transformations, triggered through annotations.

Groovy 1.0 was released on January 2, 2007, and Groovy 2.0 in July, 2012. Since version 2, Groovy can be compiled statically, offering type inference and performance near that of Java. Groovy 2.4 was the last major release under Pivotal Software&#x27;s sponsorship which ended in March 2015. Groovy has since changed its governance structure to a Project Management Committee in the Apache Software Foundation.

==History==
James Strachan first talked about the development of Groovy on his blog in August 2003. In March 2004, Groovy was submitted to the JCP as JSR 241 and accepted by ballot. Several versions were released between 2004 and 2006. After the Java Community Process (JCP) standardization effort began, the version numbering changed, and a version called &quot;1.0&quot; was released on January 2, 2007. After various betas and release candidates numbered 1.1, on December 7, 2007, Groovy 1.1 Final was released and immediately renumbered as Groovy 1.5 to reflect the many changes made.

In 2007, Groovy won the first prize at JAX 2007 innovation award. In 2008, Grails, a Groovy web framework, won the second prize at JAX 2008 innovation award.

In November 2008, SpringSource acquired the Groovy and Grails company (G2One). In August 2009 VMware acquired SpringSource.

In April 2012, after eight years of inactivity, the Spec Lead changed the status of JSR 241 to dormant.

Strachan had left the project silently a year before the Groovy 1.0 release in 2007. In Oct 2016, Strachan stated &quot;I still love groovy (jenkins pipelines are so groovy!), java, go, typescript and kotlin&quot;.

On July 2, 2012, Groovy 2.0 was released, which, among other new features, added static compiling and static type checking.

When the Pivotal Software joint venture was spun-off by EMC Corporation (EMC) and VMware in April 2013, Groovy and Grails formed part of its product portfolio. Pivotal ceased sponsoring Groovy and Grails from April 2015.
That same month, Groovy changed its governance structure from a Codehaus repository to a Project Management Committee (PMC) in the Apache Software Foundation via its incubator.
Groovy graduated from Apache&#x27;s incubator and became a top-level project in November 2015.

On February 7, 2020, Groovy 3.0 was released. Version 4.0 was released on January 25, 2022.

==Features==
Most valid Java files are also valid Groovy files. Although the two languages are similar, Groovy code can be more compact, because it does not need all the elements that Java needs. This makes it possible for Java programmers to learn Groovy gradually by starting with familiar Java syntax before acquiring more Groovy programming idioms.

Groovy features not available in Java include both static and dynamic typing (with the keyword codice_1), operator overloading, native syntax for lists and associative arrays (maps), native support for regular expressions, polymorphic iteration, string interpolation, added helper methods, and the safe navigation operator codice_2 to check automatically for null pointers (for example, codice_3, or codice_4).

Since version 2, Groovy also supports modularity (shipping only the codice_5s that the project uses, thus reducing the size of Groovy&#x27;s library), type checking, static compilation, Project Coin syntax enhancements, multicatch blocks and ongoing performance enhancements using the codice_6 instruction introduced in Java 7.

Groovy natively supports markup languages such as XML and HTML by using an inline Document Object Model (DOM) syntax. This feature enables the definition and manipulation of many types of heterogeneous data assets with a uniform and concise syntax and programming methodology.

Unlike Java, a Groovy source code file can be executed as an (uncompiled) script, if it contains code outside any class definition, if it is a class with a &quot;main&quot; method, or if it is a &quot;Runnable&quot; or &quot;GroovyTestCase&quot;. A Groovy script is fully parsed, compiled, and generated before executing (similar to Python and Ruby). This occurs under the hood, and the compiled version is not saved as an artifact of the process.

===GroovyBeans, properties===
&quot;GroovyBeans&quot; are Groovy&#x27;s version of JavaBeans. Groovy implicitly generates getters and setters. In the following code, codice_7 and codice_8 are implicitly generated. The last two lines, which appear to access color directly, are actually calling the implicitly generated methods.

class AGroovyBean {
 String color

def myGroovyBean = new AGroovyBean()

myGroovyBean.setColor(&#x27;baby blue&#x27;)
assert myGroovyBean.getColor() == &#x27;baby blue&#x27;

myGroovyBean.color = &#x27;pewter&#x27;
assert myGroovyBean.color == &#x27;pewter&#x27;
Groovy offers simple, consistent syntax for handling &quot;lists&quot; and &quot;maps&quot;, reminiscent of Java&#x27;s &quot;array&quot; syntax.

def movieList = [&#x27;Dersu Uzala&#x27;, &#x27;Ran&#x27;, &#x27;Seven Samurai&#x27;] // Looks like an array, but is a list
assert movieList[2] == &#x27;Seven Samurai&#x27;
movieList[3] = &#x27;Casablanca&#x27; // Adds an element to the list
assert movieList.size() == 4

def monthMap = [ &#x27;January&#x27; : 31, &#x27;February&#x27; : 28, &#x27;March&#x27; : 31 ] // Declares a map
assert monthMap[&#x27;March&#x27;] == 31 // Accesses an entry
monthMap[&#x27;April&#x27;] = 30 // Adds an entry to the map
assert monthMap.size() == 4
===Prototype extension===
Groovy offers support for prototype extension through codice_9, Extension Modules (only in Groovy 2), Objective-C-like Categories and codice_10.

codice_9 offers a domain-specific language (DSL) to express the changes in the class easily, similar to Ruby&#x27;s open class concept:
Number.metaClass {
 sqrt = { Math.sqrt(delegate) }

assert 9.sqrt() == 3
assert 4.sqrt() == 2
Groovy&#x27;s changes in code through prototyping are not visible in Java, since each attribute/method invocation in Groovy goes through the metaclass registry. The changed code can only be accessed from Java by going to the metaclass registry.

Groovy also allows overriding methods as codice_12, codice_13 among others, enabling the developer to intercept calls to an object and specify an action for them, in a simplified aspect-oriented way. The following code enables the class codice_14 to respond to the codice_15 property:
enum Color {
 BLACK(&#x27;#000000&#x27;), WHITE(&#x27;#FFFFFF&#x27;), RED(&#x27;#FF0000&#x27;), BLUE(&#x27;#0000FF&#x27;)
 String hex
 Color(String hex) { 
 this.hex = hex 
}

String.metaClass.getProperty = { String property -&gt;
 def stringColor = delegate
 if (property == &#x27;hex&#x27;) {
 Color.values().find { it.name().equalsIgnoreCase stringColor }?.hex
}

assert &quot;WHITE&quot;.hex == &quot;#FFFFFF&quot;
assert &quot;BLUE&quot;.hex == &quot;#0000FF&quot;
assert &quot;BLACK&quot;.hex == &quot;#000000&quot;
assert &quot;GREEN&quot;.hex == null
The Grails framework uses metaprogramming extensively to enable GORM dynamic finders, like codice_16 and others.

===Dot and parentheses===
Groovy&#x27;s syntax permits omitting parentheses and dots in some situations. The following groovy code
take(coffee).with(sugar, milk).and(liquor)
can be written as
take coffee with sugar, milk and liquor
enabling the development of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that look like plain English.

===Functional programming===
Although Groovy is mostly an object-oriented language, it also offers functional programming features.

====Closures====
According to Groovy&#x27;s documentation: &quot;Closures in Groovy work similar to a &#x27;method pointer&#x27;, enabling code to be written and run in a later point in time&quot;. Groovy&#x27;s closures support free variables, i.e. variables that have not been explicitly passed as a parameter to it, but exist in its declaration context, partial application (that it terms &#x27;currying&#x27;), delegation, implicit, typed and untyped parameters.

When working on Collections of a determined type, the closure passed to an operation on the collection can be inferred:
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
 * Non-zero numbers are coerced to true, so when it % 2 == 0 (even), it is false.
 * The type of the implicit &quot;it&quot; parameter can be inferred as an Integer by the IDE.
 * It could also be written as:
 * list.findAll { Integer i -&gt; i % 2 }
 * list.findAll { i -&gt; i % 2 }
def odds = list.findAll { it % 2 }

assert odds == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
A group of expressions can be written in a closure block without reference to an implementation and the responding object can be assigned at a later point using delegation:
// This block of code contains expressions without reference to an implementation
def operations = {
 declare 5
 sum 4
 divide 3
 print

 * This class will handle the operations that can be used in the closure above. Another class
 * could be declared having the same methods, but using, for example, webservice operations
 * in the calculations.
class Expression {
 BigDecimal value
 * Though an Integer is passed as a parameter, it is coerced into a BigDecimal, as was 
 * defined. If the class had a &#x27;declare(Integer value)&#x27; method, it would be used instead.
 def declare(BigDecimal value) {
 this.value = value
 
 def sum(BigDecimal valueToAdd) {
 this.value += valueToAdd
 
 def divide(BigDecimal divisor) {
 this.value /= divisor
 
 def propertyMissing(String property) {
 if (property == &quot;print&quot;) println value
}
// Here is defined who is going to respond the expressions in the block of code above.
operations.delegate = new Expression()
operations()
====Curry====
Usually called &quot;partial application&quot;, this Groovy feature allows closures&#x27; parameters to be set to a default parameter in any of their arguments, creating a new closure with the bound value. Supplying one argument to the codice_17 method will fix argument one. Supplying N arguments will fix arguments 1 .. N.
def joinTwoWordsWithSymbol = { symbol, first, second -&gt; first + symbol + second }
assert joinTwoWordsWithSymbol(&#x27;#&#x27;, &#x27;Hello&#x27;, &#x27;World&#x27;) == &#x27;Hello#World&#x27;

def concatWords = joinTwoWordsWithSymbol.curry(&#x27; &#x27;)
assert concatWords(&#x27;Hello&#x27;, &#x27;World&#x27;) == &#x27;Hello World&#x27;

def prependHello = concatWords.curry(&#x27;Hello&#x27;)
//def prependHello = joinTwoWordsWithSymbol.curry(&#x27; &#x27;, &#x27;Hello&#x27;)
assert prependHello(&#x27;World&#x27;) == &#x27;Hello World&#x27;
Curry can also be used in the reverse direction (fixing the last N arguments) using codice_18.
def power = { BigDecimal value, BigDecimal power -&gt;
 value**power

def square = power.rcurry(2)
def cube = power.rcurry(3)

assert power(2, 2) == 4
assert square(4) == 16
assert cube(3) == 27
Groovy also supports lazy evaluation, reduce/fold, infinite structures and immutability, among others.

===JSON and XML processing===
On JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and XML processing, Groovy employs the Builder pattern, making the production of the data structure less verbose. For example, the following XML:
&lt;languages&gt;
 &lt;language year=&quot;1995&quot;&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;Java&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;paradigm&gt;object oriented&lt;/paradigm&gt;
 &lt;typing&gt;static&lt;/typing&gt;
 &lt;/language&gt;
 &lt;language year=&quot;1995&quot;&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;Ruby&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;paradigm&gt;functional, object oriented&lt;/paradigm&gt;
 &lt;typing&gt;duck typing, dynamic&lt;/typing&gt;
 &lt;/language&gt;
 &lt;language year=&quot;2003&quot;&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;Groovy&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;paradigm&gt;functional, object oriented&lt;/paradigm&gt;
 &lt;typing&gt;duck typing, dynamic, static&lt;/typing&gt;
 &lt;/language&gt;
&lt;/languages&gt;
can be generated via the following Groovy code:
def writer = new StringWriter()
def builder = new groovy.xml.MarkupBuilder(writer)
builder.languages {
 language(year: 1995) {
 name &quot;Java&quot;
 paradigm &quot;object oriented&quot;
 typing &quot;static&quot;
 language (year: 1995) {
 name &quot;Ruby&quot;
 paradigm &quot;functional, object oriented&quot;
 typing &quot;duck typing, dynamic&quot;
 language (year: 2003) {
 name &quot;Groovy&quot;
 paradigm &quot;functional, object oriented&quot;
 typing &quot;duck typing, dynamic, static&quot;
}
and also can be processed in a streaming way through codice_19. To change the implementation to JSON, the codice_20 can be swapped to codice_21.

To parse it and search for a functional language, Groovy&#x27;s codice_22 method can serve:
def languages = new XmlSlurper().parseText writer.toString()

// Here is employed Groovy&#x27;s regex syntax for a matcher (=~) that will be coerced to a 
// boolean value: either true, if the value contains our string, or false otherwise.
def functional = languages.language.findAll { it.paradigm =~ &quot;functional&quot; }
assert functional.collect { it.name } == [&quot;Groovy&quot;, &quot;Ruby&quot;]
===String interpolation===
In Groovy, strings can be interpolated with variables and expressions by using GStrings:
BigDecimal account = 10.0
def text = &quot;The account shows currently a balance of $account&quot;
assert text == &quot;The account shows currently a balance of 10.0&quot;
GStrings containing variables and expressions must be declared using double quotes.

A complex expression must be enclosed in curly brackets. This prevents parts of it from being interpreted as belonging to the surrounding string instead of to the expression:
BigDecimal minus = 4.0
text = &quot;The account shows currently a balance of ${account - minus}&quot;
assert text == &quot;The account shows currently a balance of 6.0&quot;

// Without the brackets to isolate the expression, this would result:
text = &quot;The account shows currently a balance of $account - minus&quot;
assert text == &quot;The account shows currently a balance of 10.0 - minus&quot;
Expression evaluation can be deferred by employing arrow syntax:
BigDecimal tax = 0.15
text = &quot;The account shows currently a balance of ${-&gt;account - account*tax}&quot;
tax = 0.10

// The tax value was changed AFTER declaration of the GString. The expression 
// variables are bound only when the expression must actually be evaluated:
assert text == &quot;The account shows currently a balance of 9.000&quot;
===Abstract syntax tree transformation===
According to Groovy&#x27;s own documentation, &quot;When the Groovy compiler compiles Groovy scripts and classes, at some point in the process, the source code will end up being represented in memory in the form of a Concrete Syntax Tree, then transformed into an Abstract Syntax Tree. The purpose of AST Transformations is to let developers hook into the compilation process to be able to modify the AST before it is turned into bytecode that will be run by the JVM. AST Transformations provides Groovy with improved compile-time metaprogramming capabilities allowing powerful flexibility at the language level, without a runtime performance penalty.&quot;

Examples of ASTs in Groovy are:

* Category and Mixin transformation
* Immutable AST Macro
* Newify transformation
* Singleton transformation

among others.

The testing framework Spock uses AST transformations to allow the programmer to write tests in a syntax not supported by Groovy, but the relevant code is then manipulated in the AST to valid code. An example of such a test is: 

def &quot;maximum of #a and #b is #c&quot; () {
 expect:
 Math.max (a, b) == c

 where:
 a | b || c
 3 | 5 || 5
 7 | 0 || 7
 0 | 0 || 0


===Traits===
According to Groovy&#x27;s documentation, &quot;Traits are a structural construct of the language that allows: composition of behaviors, runtime implementation of interfaces, behavior overriding, and compatibility with static type checking/compilation.&quot;

Traits can be seen as interfaces carrying both default implementations and state. A trait is defined using the trait keyword:
trait FlyingAbility { /* declaration of a trait */
 String fly() { &quot;I&#x27;m flying!&quot; } /* declaration of a method inside a trait */


Then, it can be used like a normal interface using the keyword codice_23:
class Bird implements FlyingAbility {} /* Adds the trait FlyingAbility to the Bird class capabilities */
def bird = new Bird() /* instantiate a new Bird */
assert bird.fly() == &quot;I&#x27;m flying!&quot; /* the Bird class automatically gets the behavior of the FlyingAbility trait */
Traits allow a wide range of abilities, from simple composition to testing.

==Adoption==
Notable examples of Groovy adoption include:
