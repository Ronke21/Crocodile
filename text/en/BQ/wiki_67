<text>Dasani () is a brand of bottled water created by the Coca-Cola Company, launched in 1999. It is one of many brands of Coca-Cola bottled water sold around the world. The product is filtered and bottled.

==Marketing==

===United States===

Coca-Cola uses water from local municipal water supplies, filters it using the process of reverse osmosis, and adds trace amounts of minerals, including magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt), potassium chloride and sodium chloride (table salt).

Coca-Cola announced that they would be distributing Dasani water in new packaging comprising 30% plant-derived plastics. Unlike other plant-based packaging, the bottles are compatible with standard recycling plants and represent up to a 25% reduction in carbon emissions compared to standard water bottles, though this still represents an energy consumption two thousand times that of tap water.

===Canada===
Dasani was launched in all provinces of Canada except Quebec in 2000, a year after launching in the United States. The brand was made available in Quebec shortly afterwards, in April 2001.

There are six common Dasani bottle sizes sold in Canada: 355 mL (12 US fl oz), 500mL, 591 mL (20 US fl oz), 710 mL (24 US fl oz), 1 L, and 1.5 L. Bottles are sold individually and in packs of 6, 12, and 24.

The first Dasani bottling plant in Canada was in Calgary, Alberta. A second plant was later opened in Brampton, Ontario. The Calgary and Brampton plants produce Coca-Cola&#x27;s plain-water (Dasani) and sugar-water (soft drinks) products. The company&#x27;s administrative and marketing activities continue to be based in Atlanta, Georgia.

Dasani has &lt;35 ppm of total dissolved mineral salts.

===Latin America===
Dasani was introduced to the Brazilian market in mid-2003, renamed as &quot;Aquarius&quot;. It was introduced to the Chilean market in 2005, including releases in regular, lemon and tangerine flavors. It was released in Colombia in late 2005 with their three regular flavors. In 2005, Dasani was introduced in the Argentinian market with the flavours peach, lemon, citrus and regular. It was also released under the name &quot;Ciel Dasani&quot; in Mexico in four flavours: lemon-cucumber, papaya-carrot, grapefruit and mandarin-green tea, but it was discontinued in 2006. It was also released in Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay and Honduras.

===United Kingdom===
Dasani was launched in the UK on 10 February 2004. The product launch was labelled &quot;a disaster&quot;, a &quot;fiasco&quot;, and a &quot;PR catastrophe&quot;.

Prior to the launch, an article in &quot;The Grocer&quot; trade magazine had stated that the source of the Dasani brand water was treated tap water from Sidcup, a suburban area on the outskirts of London. By early March 2004, the mainstream press had picked up the story and it became widely reported that Sidcup tap water, after being processed, was being sold under the Dasani brand name in the UK. Although Coca-Cola never stated that the water was being sourced from a spring or other natural sources, they marketed it as being especially &quot;pure&quot;. This led the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to request Hillingdon trading standards officers to launch an investigation into whether the claim was accurate.

Richard May, Chief Publicity Officer of Dasani, was said to be disappointed that the water had not been more successful.

On 18 March 2004, UK authorities found a batch was contaminated with levels of bromate, a suspected human carcinogen, in a concentration above the legal limit for sale, although the FSA announced there was &quot;no immediate risk to public health&quot; from the contamination. Coca-Cola immediately recalled half a million bottles and withdrew the &quot;Dasani&quot; brand from the UK market.

The launch, and later contamination scandal, drew comparisons in the press with a 1992 episode of popular sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&quot; in which lead character Del Boy (David Jason) hatches a scheme selling tap water bottled in his council flat in Peckham—nine miles from Sidcup. As a result, Coca-Cola cancelled plans to expand the brand to continental Europe.

In line with the 2012 Summer Olympics and being the official drink sponsor, Coca-Cola decided not to reintroduce the Dasani brand to the UK market, and purchased the Morpeth, Northumberland-based Abbey Well bottler in 2008, branded under the Schweppes brand name (to which Coca-Cola holds the UK rights) to provide a locally sourced water brand for the event. To meet Olympic branding regulations, Abbey Well water was labeled as &quot;Still Water&quot; for on-camera appearances during the Games.

=== Africa ===
Dasani has authorised the Hyper Psaro group to bottle, distribute, and produce branded bottled water in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nonetheless, the logo and packaging appears different than that of those products in the United States though it is still considered a Coca-Cola product.

== Water sources and purification process ==

=== Sources ===
Dasani is largely sourced from municipal supplies and then filtered in bottled water plants before being bottled. Places Dasani sources its water from include: California, Minnesota, Arizona, Colorado, and Michigan. Dasani also bottles internationally, in locations such as Kent in the United Kingdom and Malaysia.

=== Filtration and purification process ===
This filtration process consists of a multi-barrier treatment system, reverse osmosis, and nanofiltration to remove impurities. Coca-Cola claims that this process provides a consistent taste, though the content within the bottles may vary across the world, depending on their source, despite frequent testing to ensure they meet FDA standards for purified water. Some states allow bottled water plants to meet Safe Drinking Water Act standards instead, so not even all Dasani bottles may be held to the same standard.

=== Environmental issues ===
Dasani sources water from municipal pool water in California locations, even during drought years. Coca-Cola is not required to report how much water it processes and bottles at these plants. Bottled water is an exception to the rule about how much water can be taken out of the Great Lakes Basin. Bottled water takes extra energy to produce from filtration, production of bottles, and transportation costs.

== Sustainability ==

=== Aluminum bottles and cans ===
In the summer of 2019, Coke announced that Dasani would become available in aluminum cans. This new line began in the Northeast US in September, and should spread through the rest of the US in 2020. This will not entirely replace their production of plastic bottles. Whether this is environmentally beneficial can be argued: aluminum is more often and more efficiently recycled, but producing one aluminum can produce 1,300g carbon dioxide emissions, which is much more than the 330g it takes to produce one plastic bottle of the same size. Less power is needed to transport and refrigerate canned beverages, which reduces the carbon footprints of cans. Additionally, although 69% of aluminum cans are recycled worldwide, this percentage is significantly lower for plastic.

=== PureFill ===
In 2019, Coke announced Dasani Purefill, a program in which customers can refill their bottles with filtered water for free. Adding flavors or carbonation will cost extra. This is predicted to reduce the number of bottles used.

=== PlantBottle ===
Coke released a Dasani bottle composed of both plants and recycled plastic, which they say will reduce their plastic bottle production by 1 billion plastic bottles over the next 5 years. This PlantBottle is still recyclable, just like PET plastic. The composition of this bottle will be up to 50% recycled plastic, up to 30% plants, and new plastic. This makes Coca-Cola the largest bioplastic user in the world. Coca-Cola plans to eventually switch to 100% bio-plastic bottles.

=== Carbon footprint ===
Having multiple bottling water facilities across the world reduces energy used for transportation. Cans have a larger carbon footprint than plastic bottles, so this switch to aluminum cans may overall increase Dasani&#x27;s carbon footprint.

=== &quot;How2Recycle&quot; Labels ===
In 2020, Dasani will premier new labels for their bottles with instructions on recycling, referred to as &quot;How2Recycle&quot; labels. The &quot;How2Recycle&quot; label was invented by the Sustainable Packaging Coalition and GreenBlue, and can already be found on other products.

== Health issues and water contaminants ==
Dasani water has been found to contain microplastics. Microplastics may be linked to diabetes, heart disease, obesity, cancer, reproductive problems, and attention deficit disorder and many more disorders/diseases.

== Public litter issues ==

=== Grand Canyon ===
In 2011, plastic bottles accounted for 30% of the waste in the Grand Canyon, where Dasani water was the water sold by the parks. The Grand Canyon officially banned sales of bottled water in 2012.

<text>Rab [ɾâːb] is an island in the &quot;Primorsko-goranska županija&quot; county in Croatia, located just off the northern Croatian coast in the Adriatic Sea.

The island is long, has an area of and 7,161 inhabitants (2021). The main settlement on the island is the eponymous town of Rab, although the neighboring village of Palit has the biggest population. The highest peak is Kamenjak at 408 m. The northeastern side of the island is mostly barren, karst, while the southwestern side is covered by one of the last oak forests of the Mediterranean.

Ferries connect the island of Rab with the mainland port of Stinica and with the neighbouring islands of Krk and Pag. European Coastal Airlines offered multiple daily connections by seaplane from Rab to Zagreb and to Rijeka via Rijeka Airport in Omišalj on the neighboring island of Krk, until it ceased operations in 2016.

==Name==
The island of Rab was first mentioned in a Greek source Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax (360 BC) and then by other Greek and Roman geographists by the name &quot;Arba&quot;. That name belonged to the Liburnians, so far the oldest known inhabitants of the island. Arba was also the name of the Liburnian settlement in the modern city of Rab. It is not certain how old this name is; it may be as old as the settlement, which means from the beginning of the Iron Age since the Liburnians did not build the city walls on the island. The Illyrian-Liburnian word &quot;Arb&quot; meant &#x27;dark, obscure, green, forested&#x27;. Therefore, name Arba should be comprehended as a toponym meaning &quot;Black island&quot;, due to the rich pine forests that once grew on the island.

After the 1st century AD, it was recorded by many other Greek and Roman authors by the names &quot;Arba&quot; and &quot;Arva&quot;.

Its Medieval Dalmatian-speaking population used &quot;Arbe&quot;, &quot;Arbia&quot;, &quot;Arbiana&quot;, &quot;Arbitana&quot; and most frequently &quot;Arbum&quot; in the documents written in the Latin.

Arbe became also the Venetian name of the city in the 15th century when it fell under the authority of the Republic of Venice.

In Croatian it became &quot;Rab&quot;, a form which probably goes back as far as the 7th century when the Slavs began to settle on the island. However, the first record of the name Rab is preserved only in the middle of the 15th century (in a Latin document relating to the establishment of the Franciscan monastery of St. Eufemija), since the major establishment of Croatian inhabitants in the city did not occur before the 10th century, unlike the rest of the island and region.

==History==

The island is first heard of under the Illyrians in 360 BC. It was part of Liburnia and then part of the Roman Empire. The emperor Octavian Augustus built town walls and gave Rab the title of Municipium.

Saint Marinus, the founder of the micronation of San Marino, originated on Rab, whence he fled during the religious persecutions of the Emperor Diocletian (this ancient bond is commemorated in the present twin-city agreement between Rab and San Marino).

The earliest bishop of Arba whose name is preserved in an extant document is Titianus, a participant in a council held in 532 Salona, the metropolitan see of which Arba was a suffragan. Among the signatories of the Second Council of Nicea was a bishop of Rab, namely Ursus. (“Ursus episcopus Avaritianensium ecclesiae” Ursus of Rab) On 17 October 1154, Arba was attached instead to the archdiocese of Zadar. By the papal bull &quot;Locum Beati Petri&quot; of 30 June 1828, the history of the diocese as a residential see came to an end and its territory was united with that of Krk. No longer a residential bishopric, Arba is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

During the Middle Ages, Rab was one of the Dalmatian city-states and remained part of the Byzantine Empire, with various degrees of autonomy. For a short time, it formed a part of the medieval Kingdom of Croatia. In 1000 the island, together with the many other islands and cities of Dalmatia, submitted to the Republic of Venice. In 1358 the island came under the rule of King Louis the Great, the Angevin ruler of Hungary.

During the Renaissance it was ruled by Venice from 1409 until the end of the 18th century followed by a brief interlude under Napoleon. It was eventually annexed by the Habsburgs in 1815 and remained under Austrian rule till 1918.

Since a majority of its residents were Italian speakers, the locals sought to be annexed to the Kingdom of Italy, but Italy eventually decided to cede the island to Yugoslavia in 1921, and many of its Italian-speaking residents subsequently left for Istria and the rest of Italy.

During World War II, the forces of Fascist Italy established the Rab concentration camp on the island. A memorial complex built in 1953 commemorates the site of the former camp, located in the village of Kampor.

After the Second World War, the island was part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia until the Croatian independence referendum in 1991.

The island of Rab is rich in cultural heritage and cultural-historical monuments that make it a popular vacation destination. Rab is also known as a pioneer of naturism after the visit of King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson.

The island is nowadays very popular with tourists and families for its beautiful nature, beaches, heritage and many events, particularly the Rab arbalest tournament and the Rab Medieval festival called Rapska Fjera.

==Twin cities==

* Sežana, Slovenia
* Königsbrunn, Germany
* San Marino, San Marino

==Important Bird Area==
The island forms part of the Kvarner Islands Important Bird Area (IBA), designated as such by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of many bird species, including breeding populations of several birds of prey.

<text>Endosomes are a collection of intracellular sorting organelles in eukaryotic cells. They are parts of the endocytic membrane transport pathway originating from the trans Golgi network. Molecules or ligands internalized from the plasma membrane can follow this pathway all the way to lysosomes for degradation or can be recycled back to the cell membrane in the endocytic cycle. Molecules are also transported to endosomes from the trans Golgi network and either continue to lysosomes or recycle back to the Golgi apparatus.

Endosomes can be classified as early, sorting, or late depending on their stage post internalization. Endosomes represent a major sorting compartment of the endomembrane system in cells.

== Function ==

Endosomes provide an environment for material to be sorted before it reaches the degradative lysosome. For example, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is taken into the cell by binding to the LDL receptor at the cell surface. Upon reaching early endosomes, the LDL dissociates from the receptor, and the receptor can be recycled to the cell surface. The LDL remains in the endosome and is delivered to lysosomes for processing. LDL dissociates because of the slightly acidified environment of the early endosome, generated by a vacuolar membrane proton pump V-ATPase. On the other hand, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the EGF receptor have a pH-resistant bond that persists until it is delivered to lysosomes for their degradation. The mannose 6-phosphate receptor carries ligands from the Golgi destined for the lysosome by a similar mechanism.

== Types ==
There are three different types of endosomes: &quot;early endosomes&quot;, &quot;late endosomes&quot;, and &quot;recycling endosomes&quot;. They are distinguished by the time it takes for endocytosed material to reach them, and by markers such as Rabs. They also have different morphology. Once endocytic vesicles have uncoated, they fuse with early endosomes. Early endosomes then &quot;mature&quot; into late endosomes before fusing with lysosomes.

Early endosomes mature in several ways to form late endosomes. They become increasingly acidic mainly through the activity of the V-ATPase. Many molecules that are recycled are removed by concentration in the tubular regions of early endosomes. Loss of these tubules to recycling pathways means that late endosomes mostly lack tubules. They also increase in size due to the homotypic fusion of early endosomes into larger vesicles. Molecules are also sorted into smaller vesicles that bud from the perimeter membrane into the endosome lumen, forming intraluminal vesicles (ILVs); this leads to the multivesicular appearance of late endosomes and so they are also known as multivesicular endosomes or multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Removal of recycling molecules such as transferrin receptors and mannose 6-phosphate receptors continues during this period, probably via budding of vesicles out of endosomes. Finally, the endosomes lose RAB5A and acquire RAB7A, making them competent for fusion with lysosomes.

Fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes has been shown to result in the formation of a &#x27;hybrid&#x27; compartment, with characteristics intermediate of the two source compartments. For example, lysosomes are more dense than late endosomes, and the hybrids have an intermediate density. Lysosomes reform by recondensation to their normal, higher density. However, before this happens, more late endosomes may fuse with the hybrid.

Some material recycles to the plasma membrane directly from early endosomes, but most traffics via recycling endosomes.

*&quot;Early endosomes&quot; consist of a dynamic tubular-vesicular network (vesicles up to 1 μm in diameter with connected tubules of approx. 50 nm diameter). Markers include RAB5A and RAB4, Transferrin and its receptor and EEA1.
*&quot;Late endosomes&quot;, also known as MVBs, are mainly spherical, lack tubules, and contain many close-packed intraluminal vesicles. Markers include RAB7, RAB9, and mannose 6-phosphate receptors. In addition to this, the late endosomal membrane (and consequently the lysosome) contains a peculiar and unique lipid named BMP or LBPA, which is not found in any other organelle membrane.
*&quot;Recycling endosomes&quot; are concentrated at the microtubule organizing center and consist of a mainly tubular network. Marker; RAB11.

More subtypes exist in specialized cells such as polarized cells and macrophages.

Phagosomes, macropinosomes and autophagosomes mature in a manner similar to endosomes, and may require fusion with normal endosomes for their maturation. Some intracellular pathogens subvert this process, for example, by preventing RAB7 acquisition.

Late endosomes/MVBs are sometimes called &quot;endocytic carrier vesicles&quot;, but this term was used to describe vesicles that bud from early endosomes and fuse with late endosomes. However, several observations (described above) have now demonstrated that it is more likely that transport between these two compartments occurs by a maturation process, rather than vesicle transport.

Another unique identifying feature that differs between the various classes of endosomes is the lipid composition in their membranes. Phosphatidyl inositol phosphates (PIPs), one of the most important lipid signaling molecules, is found to differ as the endosomes mature from early to late. PI(4,5)P2 is present on plasma membranes, PI(3)P on early endosomes, PI(3,5)P2 on late endosomes and PI(4)P on the trans Golgi network. These lipids on the surface of the endosomes help in the specific recruitment of proteins from the cytosol, thus providing them an identity. The inter-conversion of these lipids is a result of the concerted action of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases that are strategically localized

==Pathways==

There are three main compartments that have pathways that connect with endosomes. More pathways exist in specialized cells, such as melanocytes and polarized cells. For example, in epithelial cells, a special process called transcytosis allows some materials to enter one side of a cell and exit from the opposite side. Also, in some circumstances, late endosomes/MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane instead of with lysosomes, releasing the lumenal vesicles, now called exosomes, into the extracellular medium.

There is no consensus as to the exact nature of these pathways, and the sequential route taken by any given cargo in any given situation will tend to be a matter of debate.

===Golgi to/from endosomes===

Vesicles pass between the Golgi and endosomes in both directions. The GGAs and AP-1 clathrin-coated vesicle adaptors make vesicles at the Golgi that carry molecules to endosomes. In the opposite direction, retromer generates vesicles at early endosomes that carry molecules back to the Golgi. Some studies describe a retrograde traffic pathway from late endosomes to the Golgi that is mediated by Rab9 and TIP47, but other studies dispute these findings. Molecules that follow these pathways include the mannose-6-phosphate receptors that carry lysosomal hydrolases to the endocytic pathway. The hydrolases are released in the acidic environment of endosomes, and the receptor is retrieved to the Golgi by retromer and Rab9.

===Plasma membrane to/from early endosomes (via recycling endosomes)===

Molecules are delivered from the plasma membrane to early endosomes in endocytic vesicles. Molecules can be internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis in clathrin-coated vesicles. Other types of vesicles also form at the plasma membrane for this pathway, including ones utilising caveolin. Vesicles also transport molecules directly back to the plasma membrane, but many molecules are transported in vesicles that first fuse with recycling endosomes. Molecules following this recycling pathway are concentrated in the tubules of early endosomes. Molecules that follow these pathways include the receptors for LDL, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and the iron transport protein transferrin. Internalization of these receptors from the plasma membrane occurs by receptor-mediated endocytosis. LDL is released in endosomes because of the lower pH, and the receptor is recycled to the cell surface. Cholesterol is carried in the blood primarily by (LDL), and transport by the LDL receptor is the main mechanism by which cholesterol is taken up by cells. EGFRs are activated when EGF binds. The activated receptors stimulate their own internalization and degradation in lysosomes. EGF remains bound to the EGF receptor (EGFR) once it is endocytosed to endosomes. The activated EGFRs stimulate their own ubiquitination, and this directs them to lumenal vesicles (see below) and so they are not recycled to the plasma membrane. This removes the signaling portion of the protein from the cytosol and thus prevents continued stimulation of growth - in cells not stimulated with EGF, EGFRs have no EGF bound to them and therefore recycle if they reach endosomes. Transferrin also remains associated with its receptor, but, in the acidic endosome, iron is released from the transferrin, and then the iron-free transferrin (still bound to the transferrin receptor) returns from the early endosome to the cell surface, both directly and via recycling endosomes.

===Late endosomes to lysosomes===

Transport from late endosomes to lysosomes is, in essence, unidirectional, since a late endosome is &quot;consumed&quot; in the process of fusing with a lysosome (sometimes called endolysosome).Hence, soluble molecules in the lumen of endosomes will tend to end up in lysosomes, unless they are retrieved in some way. Transmembrane proteins can be delivered to the perimeter membrane or the lumen of lysosomes. Transmembrane proteins destined for the lysosome lumen are sorted into the vesicles that bud from the perimeter membrane into endosomes, a process that begins in early endosomes. The process of creating vesicles within the endosome is thought to be enhanced by the peculiar lipid BMP or LBPA, which is only found in late endosomes, endolysosomes or lysosomes. When the endosome has matured into a late endosome/MVB and fuses with a lysosome, the vesicles in the lumen are delivered to the lysosome lumen. Proteins are marked for this pathway by the addition of ubiquitin. The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) recognise this ubiquitin and sort the protein into the forming lumenal vesicles. Molecules that follow these pathways include LDL and the lysosomal hydrolases delivered by mannose-6-phosphate receptors. These soluble molecules remain in endosomes and are therefore delivered to lysosomes. Also, the transmembrane EGFRs, bound to EGF, are tagged with ubiquitin and are therefore sorted into lumenal vesicles by the ESCRTs.

<doc id="501868" wikidata="Q492205" url="?curid=501868" title="Crush, tear, curl">
<text>Crush, tear, curl (sometimes cut, tear, curl) is a method of processing tea leaves into black tea in which the leaves are passed through a series of cylindrical rollers with hundreds of sharp teeth that crush, tear, and curl the tea into small, hard pellets. This replaces the final stage of orthodox tea manufacture, in which the leaves are rolled into strips. Tea produced using this method is generally called CTC tea or mamri tea.

==History==
The first CTC machine was brought into service in 1930 at the Amgoorie Tea Garden in Assam under the supervision of Sir William McKercher. It proliferated over three decades starting in 1950, most rapidly in India and Africa.

==Production==
Today, most black teas produced use the CTC method or the closely related Rotorvane orthodox manufacture. CTC and Rotorvane orthodox have a finished product that is well suited for tea bags, as the product quickly gives a dark brew.

For many large tea producers, 80% to 90% of the factory&#x27;s production is of small, broken, primary grades suitable for tea bag blends; the remaining 10% to 20% are secondary grades which trade at a discount to the primary grades. The convenience, low price, strong liquor, generic flavor, and mild bitterness all have contributed to the near-monopoly that CTC-type teas now enjoy in South Asia.

In the Indian domestic market, this type of manufacture is by far the most popular – over 80% of tea production is of the CTC type. In the export market, particularly in the CIS, the Middle East, United Kingdom and Ireland, CTC teas continue to be the most highly in demand.

CTC teas generally produce a rich red-brown colour when they are boiled by the Indian method. The drawback of the CTC method is that it tends by its nature, and unfortunately by adulteration, to homogenize all black tea flavors. In the process of crushing, tearing and pelletising the tea leaves, pressures and stresses occur which break down the cells, releasing large amounts of the phytins that normally oxidise to produce black tea&#x27;s mahogany colour. Since, regardless of origin, CTC teas in their dry form are generically &quot;tea-like&quot; in aroma, and of similar pelletized appearance, it is easy to adulterate a more expensive CTC-type tea with inexpensive and generally mild lowland teas of the same process. Different types of orthodox-processed whole and broken leaf teas, by contrast, look quite different from each other, making them more difficult to adulterate.

== Steps To Production CTC Tea ==

# Plucking: Fresh tea leaves are hand-picked, selecting the top two leaves and a bud.
# Withering: Leaves are spread out to reduce moisture.
# Rolling: Leaves are crushed, torn, and curled into small pellets.
# Fermentation: Leaves oxidize, turning darker and richer in flavor.
# Drying: Hot air stops oxidation and locks in the taste.
# Grading: Tea is sorted by size:
#* BOP: Medium pieces
#* BOPSM: Finer than BOP
#* DUST: Tiny particles for tea bags

<text>The Nu people (; alternative names include Nusu, Nung, Zauzou and Along) are one of the 56 ethnic groups recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Their population of 27,000 is divided into the Northern, Central and Southern groups. Their homeland is a country of high mountains and deep ravines crossed by the Dulong, Irrawaddy (N&#x27;Mai River and Mali River), and Nujiang rivers. The name &quot;Nu&quot; comes from the fact that they were living near the Nujiang river, and the name of their ethnic group derives from there. (Nujiang is also called Nu river or or Salween River.)

The Nu live mainly in Kachin State and Yunnan province. In China, 90% of them are found in Gongshan, Fugong and Lanping counties in Yunnan Province, along with Lisu, Drung, Tibetan, Nakhi, Bai and Han. There is also a sparse distribution of Nu in Weixi County in the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Zayu County in Tibet Autonomous Region, particularly at the border between Yunnan and Tibet. 

The Nu speak various languages in the Tibeto-Burman family. They do not have a written language of their own, although the Chinese government has helped them to develop a script based on the Latin alphabet.

== Dress ==

Linen clothes are popular among both genders. The womenfolk generally wore linen or cotton tunics with sleeves, which are buttoned on the left and long skirts. The young girls often wear aprons over their tunics. They like to wear necklaces strung with colored plastic beads. Some wear head or chest ornaments with strings of coral, agates, shells and silver coins. They wear big copper earrings that hang to the shoulder. 

The menfolk often put on linen sleeved tunics over shorts, and almost every man wears a string of coral on his left ear and hangs a machete from the left side of his waist. When they go out, they often carry machetes, bows, and arrow bags made from animal felt. They wear black turbans wrapped around their head, though they tend to keep ear-length haircuts.

== Lifestyle ==
The Nu build their houses made out of either bamboo-slips or wooden planks near the mountains, though houses made out of the latter type are more prevalent due to its better strength. Within the house there are two stories; the lower floor acts as a barn, where livestock, food, and other storage items are placed, while the upper floor consists of the living quarters. On the second floor, it is further sub-divided into the inner and outer rooms. The inner room is used as a bedroom as well as a storeroom, while the outer one is as a kitchen and guestroom. 

Agriculture is their main occupation. Bamboo and wooden farm tools were the tools for planting, and major crops include maize, buckwheat, barley, potatoes, yams and beans. Output is low, as chemical fertilizers are not used and primitive crop-planting techniques are used. The annual grain harvest is some 100 kg short of the per capita need, and the diet is supplemented by hunting and fishing.

== Religion and culture ==
The Nu are adherents of Tibetan Buddhism and their tribal Animism, which has close affinities with the natural world. A minority have converted to Christianity. Tibetan Buddhism is mainly professed by the Northern Nu. Most of the southern and central groups have retained their Animist faith, although Christianity has made some inroads into the southern group (through French missionaries in the second half of the 19th century).

The Nu celebrate the tribal flower-fairy festival, which is mainly celebrated by the Nu in the Gongshan area of Yunnan province. According to the Chinese lunar calendar, the festival comes on 15 March annually and lasts three days. The festival is based on the legend that the Nu River often flooded in ancient times. A Nu girl named A-Rong, inspired by the web of a spider, created a kind of rope-bridge, by which the people could cross the river. Coveting the beauty of A-Rong, the chief of the Hou tribe tried to force her to marry him time and time again. However, A-Rong would not agree, so she escaped into the mountains and eventually turned into a stone statue in a cave. To honor her, the Nu people celebrate Fairy Festival on March 15 every year.

Upon the arrival of the festival, the people will pick bunches of azaleas and sacrifice the fairy maiden at a cave, literally known as Fairy People Cave. After the ceremony, the people drink together at home, and people of all ages will dress up in their traditional costumes, holding fresh flowers. They will gather together in the open air, singing, dancing, and telling stories. Ball matches akin to football matches, bow and arrow competitions are held as well.

Another festival is the Jijilamu festival, the spring festival which lasts about 15 days from the end of lunar December to the beginning of lunar January. It is mainly celebrated by the Nu living in Bijiang, Fugong, Gongshan, Lanping and Weixi counties of Yunnan Province, although Losar is also celebrated by the Tibetan Buddhist Nu.

On the eve of the festival, households in every village butcher pigs, make soft-rice dumplings, brew wine and clean their courtyards, similar to the Chinese New Year. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, before eating, they put corn and dishes of food on a three-legged barbecue. On top of the three legs, three cups are put and also three pieces of meat, then the family members, either young or old, pray for a good harvest and strong livestock for the New Year.

<doc id="501871" wikidata="Q806190" url="?curid=501871" title="Banco Nacional Ultramarino">
<text>Banco Nacional Ultramarino (, BNU; ; ) is a Macau banking and financial services corporation. It was historically a Portuguese bank with operations throughout the world, especially in Portugal&#x27;s former overseas provinces. It ceased existence as an independent legal entity in Portugal following its merger in 2001 with Caixa Geral de Depósitos, the government-owned savings bank.

The bank continues operations today under the Banco Nacional Ultramarino brand in Macau, a Chinese special administrative region and former Portuguese colony, where it is also licensed to issue Macanese pataca banknotes.

==Timeline==

Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU) was established in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1864 as a bank of issue for Portuguese overseas territories. the next year it opened branches in Luanda, Angola and Praia, Cabo Verde. Three years after that, in 1868, BNU opened branches in São Tomé and Príncipe, Goa, and Lourenço Marques, Mozambique.

In 1901, BNU lost its banking monopoly, but retained its note-issuing monopoly in the countries in which BNU operated.

BNU opened branches in Macau and in Bolama, Portuguese Guinea (present-day Guinea-Bissau) in 1902, in Dili, East Timor (present-day Timor Leste), and in Brazil, a representative office in Stanleyville and a branch in Paris in 1919, a representative office in Bombay in 1920.

In 1926, BNU lost its note-issuing monopoly in Angola following the creation of Banco de Angola. BNU transferred its branch in Stanleyville to Banco de Angola. In 1929, BNU established Anglo-Portuguese Colonial and Overseas Bank, its subsidiary in London, and converted its branch in Paris to a subsidiary, Banque Franco-Portugaise d’Outre-Mer.

In 1952, BNU closed its branches in India. In 1965, BNU, Banco Português do Atlântico, Banco de Angola, and the South African company, General Mining and Finance, founded Bank of Lisbon and South Africa. This was later renamed Mercantile Lisbon Bank. In the 1970s, BNU bought a stake in Banque Interatlantique in Luxembourg, and established a representative office in London.

In 1974 the Portuguese government nationalized BNU, following the Carnation Revolution. Immediately thereafter, in 1975, local governments nationalized BNU&#x27;s interests in Mozambique, which became Banco de Moçambique, and in São Tomé and Príncipe, which became National Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe. In 1993, the government split National Bank into a central bank, Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe, and a commercial bank, Banco Internacional de São Tomé e Príncipe. In Cape Verde, BNU&#x27;s interests became Bank of Cape Verde. In 1993, the government spun off the commercial banking operations into a new bank, Banco Comercial do Atlântico.

In 1988, the Portuguese Government-owned Caixa Geral de Depósitos became the majority shareholder of BNU, with the Republic of Portugal the sole other shareholder.

BNU opened a branch in London in 1991 and a branch in Zhuhai, a special economic zone of China, in 1993.

In 1993, Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD) became the majority shareholder in Banque Franco-Portugaise d’Outre-Mer. In 2002, CGD closed the bank by merging its operations into CGD&#x27;s branch in Paris.

In 1995, the Chinese government confirmed that BNU would remain a note issuer in Macao until at least 2010.

In 1999, BNU opened representative offices in Mumbai and Panjim (Goa), and a branch in Dili, Timor Leste.
*2000 - BNU reached an agreement with the Administration of Macau Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, under which BNU remains an Agent of the Treasury.
*2001 - BNU and Caixa Geral de Depósitos merged through incorporation of BNU into Caixa Geral de Depósitos; Banque Franco-Portugaise d’Outre-Mer became a branch of Caixa Geral; on July 1, 2000, the Macau branch of Banco Nacional Ultramarino became a bank incorporated in Macau SAR under the name Banco Nacional Ultramarino S.A., but remained wholly owned subsidiary of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, retaining until 2010 its functions as a note issuer and Agent of the Treasury.
*2002 - Caixa Geral acquired majority ownership (64.8%) of the South African focused bank holding company - Mercantile Lisbon Bank Holdings Limited (MLBH), now known as Mercantile Bank Holdings Limited, which operates the Mercantile Bank.

==Banknotes==

The Monetary Authority of Macao has authorized two banks to issue banknotes denominated in Macanese pataca, the Bank of China and Banco Nacional Ultramarino S.A., CGD&#x27;s subsidiary in Macau. Owing to Macau&#x27;s Portuguese colonial past, the languages on the banknotes feature Portuguese as well as Chinese.

The Banco Nacional Ultramarino introduced its first pataca notes in 1906, in denominations of 1, 5, 50 and 100 pataca. The next year it introduced 10 and 25 pataca notes. The BNU began to issue lower-value notes with 5, 10 and 50 avo notes in 1920, and 1 and 20 avo notes in 1942. In 1944, it introduced a 500 pataca note. After 1952, coins replaced denominations below 10 patacas. The bank discontinued the 25 pataca note in 1958.

Previous note designs included the coat of arms of Portugal; in the current issue BNU&#x27;s corporate logo has replaced the coat of arms.

The current issue of BNU banknotes is:
The 2005 series of BNU was printed by Hong Kong Note Printing Limited - Hong Kong.

<doc id="501877" wikidata="Q1119083" url="?curid=501877" title="FAW Premier Cup">
<text>The FAW Premier Cup (until 1998 the FAW Invitation Cup) was a Welsh football cup competition, organised annually by the Football Association of Wales from 1997 to 2008. Since the FAW excluded clubs playing in English leagues (including six Welsh clubs) from playing in the Welsh Cup from 1996 onwards, the FAW needed another competition where the best Welsh teams could compete.

The original format incorporated the three Welsh clubs then playing in the Football League (Cardiff City, Swansea City and Wrexham) along with Merthyr Tydfil and four League of Wales clubs (now the Welsh Premier League). Until the 2001–02 season, Merthyr Tydfil had a guaranteed place, as Newport County and Colwyn Bay were not invited to take part. From then onwards, the highest placed of the three were invited. Colwyn Bay never subsequently qualified.

From the 2004–05 season, the competition was expanded to 16 clubs – the top 10 placed clubs from the Welsh Premier League, joined by the two best-placed of the three teams: Newport County, Merthyr Tydfil and Colwyn Bay, the Welsh Cup winners plus Cardiff City, Swansea City and Wrexham.

The competition offered a healthy prize fund. A share of the TV coverage money for live matches was also split between both clubs. The losing semi-final teams each received £25,000. The losing finalists received £50,000, with the winners receiving £100,000.

The competition&#x27;s most senior clubs were accused of taking the competition lightly. Cardiff City in particular, following the arrival of ambitious owner Sam Hammam enjoyed relative success in the Football League but Cardiff City won the FAW Premier Cup just once, beating arch-rivals Swansea City in the 2002 final.

Wrexham appeared in all but three finals. The only Welsh Premier League clubs to have played in the final are Barry Town, Rhyl, The New Saints and Llanelli. The 2007 final was the first final not to include one of the English Football League clubs. In the last final, on 11 March 2008, Newport County beat Llanelli at Newport Stadium.

The FAW Premier Cup was broadcast on BBC Wales. However, after BBC Wales withdrew their sponsorship of the competition in 2008, the competition was cancelled.

In the 2011-12 season the FAW announced that the six exiled clubs would again be invited to play in the Welsh Cup. Merthyr Town, Newport County and Wrexham all accepted but Cardiff City, Colwyn Bay and Swansea City rejected the invitation. However, because UEFA refused to give any of these clubs entry into the Europa League by this route, these clubs did not enter the Welsh Cup in the following season.

<text>The following is an episode list for the MTV animated television series &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. The series has its roots in 1992 when Mike Judge created two animated shorts, &quot;Frog Baseball&quot; and &quot;Peace, Love and Understanding&quot;, which were aired on &quot;Liquid Television&quot;.

== Series overview ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Episodes ==
=== Pilots (1992) ===
These originally aired as part of &quot;Liquid Television&quot; and did not include music videos.

=== Season 1 (1993) ===
Mike Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of these episodes, in particular the first two—&quot;Door to Door&quot; and &quot;Give Blood/Blood Drive&quot;—which he described as &quot;Horrible. Those first two episodes were awful, I don&#x27;t know why anybody liked it... I was burying my head in the sand.&quot;

=== Season 2 (1993) ===
=== Season 3 (1993–94) ===
=== Season 4 (1994) ===
=== Season 5 (1994–95) ===


=== Season 6 (1995–96) ===

=== Season 7 (1997) ===
Starting this season, the show switched to a 7-minute short act, with most of the shorts running approximately 5 minutes with one music video at the end. All of the music videos this season are repeats from previous seasons, with the exception of &quot;B&amp;B Do Thanksgiving.&quot;

=== Season 8 (2011) ===
=== Season 9 (2022)===
On July 1, 2020, it was announced that two new seasons of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; had been ordered. Produced for Paramount+, the first new season of &quot;Mike Judge&#x27;s Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; premiered on August 4, 2022. The season made its linear premiere on February 8, 2023, on Comedy Central.

=== Season 10 (2023)===
On March 8, 2023, Paramount+ announced that the series would return with a new season, which premiered April 20, 2023.

<text>In music, the introduction is a passage or section which opens a movement or a separate piece, preceding the theme or lyrics. In popular music, this is often known as the song intro or just the intro. The introduction establishes melodic, harmonic or rhythmic material related to the main body of a piece.

Introductions may consist of an ostinato that is used in the following music, an important chord or progression that establishes the tonality and groove for the following music, or they may be important but disguised or out-of-context motivic or thematic material. As such, the introduction may be the first statement of primary or other important material, may be related to but different from the primary or other important material, or may bear little relation to any other material.

A common introduction to a rubato ballad is a dominant seventh chord with fermata, an introduction that works for many songs is the last four or eight measures of the song, while a common introduction to the twelve-bar blues is a single chorus. 

If a movement in sonata form form begins with an introductory section, this introduction is typically not considered part of the movement&#x27;s exposition.

<doc id="501898" wikidata="Q7617831" url="?curid=501898" title="Stochastic programming">
<text>In the field of mathematical optimization, stochastic programming is a framework for modeling optimization problems that involve uncertainty. A stochastic program is an optimization problem in which some or all problem parameters are uncertain, but follow known probability distributions. This framework contrasts with deterministic optimization, in which all problem parameters are assumed to be known exactly. The goal of stochastic programming is to find a decision which both optimizes some criteria chosen by the decision maker, and appropriately accounts for the uncertainty of the problem parameters. Because many real-world decisions involve uncertainty, stochastic programming has found applications in a broad range of areas ranging from finance to transportation to energy optimization.

==Methods==

Several stochastic programming methods have been developed:
* Scenario-based methods including Sample Average Approximation
* Stochastic integer programming for problems in which some variables must be integers
* Chance constrained programming for dealing with constraints that must be satisfied with a given probability
* Stochastic dynamic programming
* Markov decision process
* Benders decomposition

== Two-stage problem definition==
The basic idea of two-stage stochastic programming is that (optimal) decisions should be based on data available at the time the decisions are made and cannot depend on future observations. The two-stage formulation is widely used in stochastic programming. The general formulation of a two-stage stochastic programming problem is given by:
formula_1
where formula_2 is the optimal value of the second-stage problem
formula_3

The classical two-stage linear stochastic programming problems can be formulated as
formula_4

where formula_5 is the optimal value of the second-stage problem
formula_6

In such formulation formula_7 is the first-stage decision variable vector, formula_8 is the second-stage decision variable vector, and formula_9 contains the data of the second-stage problem. In this formulation, at the first stage we have to make a &quot;here-and-now&quot; decision formula_10 before the realization of the uncertain data formula_11, viewed as a random vector, is known. At the second stage, after a realization of formula_11 becomes available, we optimize our behavior by solving an appropriate optimization problem.

At the first stage we optimize (minimize in the above formulation) the cost formula_13 of the first-stage decision plus the expected cost of the (optimal) second-stage decision. We can view the second-stage problem simply as an optimization problem which describes our supposedly optimal behavior when the uncertain data is revealed, or we can consider its solution as a recourse action where the term formula_14 compensates for a possible inconsistency of the system formula_15 and formula_16 is the cost of this recourse action.

The considered two-stage problem is &quot;linear&quot; because the objective functions and the constraints are linear. Conceptually this is not essential and one can consider more general two-stage stochastic programs. For example, if the first-stage problem is integer, one could add integrality constraints to the first-stage problem so that the feasible set is discrete. Non-linear objectives and constraints could also be incorporated if needed.

=== Distributional assumption ===
The formulation of the above two-stage problem assumes that the second-stage data formula_11 is modeled as a random vector with a known probability distribution. This would be justified in many situations. For example, the distribution of formula_11 could be inferred from historical data if one assumes that the distribution does not significantly change over the considered period of time. Also, the empirical distribution of the sample could be used as an approximation to the distribution of the future values of formula_11. If one has a prior model for formula_11, one could obtain a posteriori distribution by a Bayesian update.

==Scenario-based approach==

=== Discretization ===
To solve the two-stage stochastic problem numerically, one often needs to assume that the random vector formula_11 has a finite number of possible realizations, called &quot;scenarios&quot;, say formula_22, with respective probability masses formula_23. Then the expectation in the first-stage problem&#x27;s objective function can be written as the summation:
formula_24
and, moreover, the two-stage problem can be formulated as one large linear programming problem (this is called the deterministic equivalent of the original problem, see section ).

When formula_11 has an infinite (or very large) number of possible realizations the standard approach is then to represent this distribution by scenarios. This approach raises three questions, namely:

# How to construct scenarios, see ;
# How to solve the deterministic equivalent. Optimizers such as CPLEX, and GLPK can solve large linear/nonlinear problems. The NEOS Server, hosted at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, allows free access to many modern solvers. The structure of a deterministic equivalent is particularly amenable to apply decomposition methods, such as Benders&#x27; decomposition or scenario decomposition;
# How to measure quality of the obtained solution with respect to the &quot;true&quot; optimum.

These questions are not independent. For example, the number of scenarios constructed will affect both the tractability of the deterministic equivalent and the quality of the obtained solutions.

=== Stochastic linear programming===
A stochastic linear program is a specific instance of the classical two-stage stochastic program. A stochastic LP is built from a collection of multi-period linear programs (LPs), each having the same structure but somewhat different data. The formula_26 two-period LP, representing the formula_26 scenario, may be regarded as having the following form:

formula_28

The vectors formula_10 and formula_30 contain the first-period variables, whose values must be chosen immediately. The vector formula_31 contains all of the variables for subsequent periods. The constraints formula_32 involve only first-period variables and are the same in every scenario. The other constraints involve variables of later periods and differ in some respects from scenario to scenario, reflecting uncertainty about the future.

Note that solving the formula_26 two-period LP is equivalent to assuming the formula_26 scenario in the second period with no uncertainty. In order to incorporate uncertainties in the second stage, one should assign probabilities to different scenarios and solve the corresponding deterministic equivalent.

==== Deterministic equivalent of a stochastic problem====
With a finite number of scenarios, two-stage stochastic linear programs can be modelled as large linear programming problems. This formulation is often called the deterministic equivalent linear program, or abbreviated to deterministic equivalent. (Strictly speaking a deterministic equivalent is any mathematical program that can be used to compute the optimal first-stage decision, so these will exist for continuous probability distributions as well, when one can represent the second-stage cost in some closed form.)
For example, to form the deterministic equivalent to the above stochastic linear program, we assign a probability formula_35 to each scenario formula_36. Then we can minimize the expected value of the objective, subject to the constraints from all scenarios:

formula_37

We have a different vector formula_31 of later-period variables for each scenario formula_39. The first-period variables formula_10 and formula_30 are the same in every scenario, however, because we must make a decision for the first period before we know which scenario will be realized. As a result, the constraints involving just formula_10 and formula_30 need only be specified once, while the remaining constraints must be given separately for each scenario.

=== Scenario construction ===
In practice it might be possible to construct scenarios by eliciting experts&#x27; opinions on the future. The number of constructed scenarios should be relatively modest so that the obtained deterministic equivalent can be solved with reasonable computational effort. It is often claimed that a solution that is optimal using only a few scenarios provides more adaptable plans than one that assumes a single scenario only. In some cases such a claim could be verified by a simulation. In theory some measures of guarantee that an obtained solution solves the original problem with reasonable accuracy. Typically in applications only the &quot;first stage&quot; optimal solution formula_44 has a practical value since almost always a &quot;true&quot; realization of the random data will be different from the set of constructed (generated) scenarios.

Suppose formula_11 contains formula_46 independent random components, each of which has three possible realizations (for example, future realizations of each random parameters are classified as low, medium and high), then the total number of scenarios is formula_47. Such &quot;exponential growth&quot; of the number of scenarios makes model development using expert opinion very difficult even for reasonable size formula_46. The situation becomes even worse if some random components of formula_11 have continuous distributions.

====Monte Carlo sampling and Sample Average Approximation (SAA) Method====

A common approach to reduce the scenario set to a manageable size is by using Monte Carlo simulation. Suppose the total number of scenarios is very large or even infinite. Suppose further that we can generate a sample formula_50 of formula_51 replications of the random vector formula_11. Usually the sample is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d sample). Given a sample, the expectation function formula_53 is approximated by the sample average

formula_54

and consequently the first-stage problem is given by

formula_55

This formulation is known as the &quot;Sample Average Approximation&quot; method. The SAA problem is a function of the considered sample and in that sense is random. For a given sample formula_50 the SAA problem is of the same form as a two-stage stochastic linear programming problem with the scenarios formula_57., formula_58, each taken with the same probability formula_59.

=== Statistical inference ===

Consider the following stochastic programming problem

formula_60

Here formula_61 is a nonempty closed subset of formula_62, formula_11 is a random vector whose probability distribution formula_64 is supported on a set formula_65, and formula_66. In the framework of two-stage stochastic programming, formula_2 is given by the optimal value of the corresponding second-stage problem.

Assume that formula_68 is well defined and &quot;finite valued&quot; for all formula_69. This implies that for every formula_69 the value formula_2 is finite almost surely.

Suppose that we have a sample formula_72 of formula_51realizations of the random vector formula_11. This random sample can be viewed as historical data of formula_51 observations of formula_11, or it can be generated by Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Then we can formulate a corresponding &quot;sample average approximation&quot;

formula_77

By the Law of Large Numbers we have that, under some regularity conditions formula_78 converges pointwise with probability 1 to formula_79 as formula_80. Moreover, under mild additional conditions the convergence is uniform. We also have formula_81, i.e., formula_82 is an &quot;unbiased&quot; estimator of formula_68. Therefore, it is natural to expect that the optimal value and optimal solutions of the SAA problem converge to their counterparts of the true problem as formula_80.

====Consistency of SAA estimators====

Suppose the feasible set formula_61 of the SAA problem is fixed, i.e., it is independent of the sample. Let formula_86 and formula_87 be the optimal value and the set of optimal solutions, respectively, of the true problem and let formula_88 and formula_89 be the optimal value and the set of optimal solutions, respectively, of the SAA problem.

# Let formula_90 and formula_91 be a sequence of (deterministic) real valued functions. The following two properties are equivalent:
#* for any formula_92 and any sequence formula_93 converging to formula_94 it follows that formula_95 converges to formula_96
#* the function formula_97 is continuous on formula_61 and formula_99 converges to formula_97 uniformly on any compact subset of formula_61
# If the objective of the SAA problem formula_82 converges to the true problem&#x27;s objective formula_68 with probability 1, as formula_80, uniformly on the feasible set formula_61. Then formula_88 converges to formula_86 with probability 1 as formula_80.
# Suppose that there exists a compact set formula_109 such that
#* the set formula_110 of optimal solutions of the true problem is nonempty and is contained in formula_111
#* the function formula_68 is finite valued and continuous on formula_111
#* the sequence of functions formula_82 converges to formula_68 with probability 1, as formula_80, uniformly in formula_117
#* for formula_51 large enough the set formula_89 is nonempty and formula_120 with probability 1
:: then formula_121 and formula_122 with probability 1 as formula_123. Note that formula_124 denotes the &quot;deviation of set formula_125 from set formula_126&quot;, defined as

formula_127

In some situations the feasible set formula_61 of the SAA problem is estimated, then the corresponding SAA problem takes the form

formula_129

where formula_130 is a subset of formula_62 depending on the sample and therefore is random. Nevertheless, consistency results for SAA estimators can still be derived under some additional assumptions:
# Suppose that there exists a compact set formula_109 such that
#* the set formula_110 of optimal solutions of the true problem is nonempty and is contained in formula_111
#* the function formula_68 is finite valued and continuous on formula_111
#* the sequence of functions formula_82 converges to formula_68 with probability 1, as formula_80, uniformly in formula_117
#* for formula_51 large enough the set formula_89 is nonempty and formula_120 with probability 1
#* if formula_144 and formula_145 converges with probability 1 to a point formula_146, then formula_147
#* for some point formula_148 there exists a sequence formula_144 such that formula_150 with probability 1.
:: then formula_121 and formula_122 with probability 1 as formula_123.

==== Asymptotics of the SAA optimal value ====

Suppose the sample formula_72 is i.i.d. and fix a point formula_155. Then the sample average estimator formula_82, of formula_68, is unbiased and has variance formula_158, where formula_159 is supposed to be finite. Moreover, by the central limit theorem we have that

formula_160

where formula_161 denotes convergence in &quot;distribution&quot; and formula_162 has a normal distribution with mean formula_163 and variance formula_164, written as formula_165.

In other words, formula_82 has &quot;asymptotically normal&quot; distribution, i.e., for large formula_51, formula_82 has approximately normal distribution with mean formula_68 and variance formula_158. This leads to the following (approximate) formula_171% confidence interval for formula_172:

 formula_173

where formula_174 (here formula_175 denotes the cdf of the standard normal distribution) and

formula_176

is the sample variance estimate of formula_164. That is, the error of estimation of formula_68 is (stochastically) of order formula_179.

== Applications and Examples==
=== Biological applications ===
Stochastic dynamic programming is frequently used to model animal behaviour in such fields as behavioural ecology. Empirical tests of models of optimal foraging, life-history transitions such as fledging in birds and egg laying in parasitoid wasps have shown the value of this modelling technique in explaining the evolution of behavioural decision making. These models are typically many-staged, rather than two-staged.

===Economic applications===
Stochastic dynamic programming is a useful tool in understanding decision making under uncertainty. The accumulation of capital stock under uncertainty is one example; often it is used by resource economists to analyze bioeconomic problems where the uncertainty enters in such as weather, etc.

=== Example: multistage portfolio optimization ===

The following is an example from finance of multi-stage stochastic programming.
Suppose that at time formula_180 we have initial capital formula_181 to invest in formula_182 assets. Suppose further that we are allowed to rebalance our portfolio at times formula_183 but without injecting additional cash into it. At each period formula_184 we make a decision about redistributing the current wealth formula_185 among the formula_182 assets. Let formula_187 be the initial amounts invested in the n assets. We require that each formula_188 is nonnegative and that the balance equation formula_189 should hold.

Consider the total returns formula_190 for each period formula_191. This forms a vector-valued random process formula_192. At time period formula_193, we can rebalance the portfolio by specifying the amounts formula_194 invested in the respective assets. At that time the returns in the first period have been realized so it is reasonable to use this information in the rebalancing decision. Thus, the second-stage decisions, at time formula_193, are actually functions of realization of the random vector formula_196, i.e., formula_197. Similarly, at time formula_184 the decision formula_199 is a function formula_200 of the available information given by formula_201 the history of the random process up to time formula_184. A sequence of functions formula_200, formula_204, with formula_205 being constant, defines an &quot;implementable policy&quot; of the decision process. It is said that such a policy is &quot;feasible&quot; if it satisfies the model constraints with probability 1, i.e., the nonnegativity constraints formula_206, formula_207, formula_204, and the balance of wealth constraints,

:formula_209

where in period formula_191 the wealth formula_185 is given by

:formula_212

which depends on the realization of the random process and the decisions up to time formula_184.

Suppose the objective is to maximize the expected utility of this wealth at the last period, that is, to consider the problem

:formula_214

This is a multistage stochastic programming problem, where stages are numbered from formula_180 to formula_216. Optimization is performed over all implementable and feasible policies. To complete the problem description one also needs to define the probability distribution of the random process formula_192. This can be done in various ways. For example, one can construct a particular scenario tree defining time evolution of the process. If at every stage the random return of each asset is allowed to have two continuations, independent of other assets, then the total number of scenarios is formula_218

In order to write dynamic programming equations, consider the above multistage problem backward in time. At the last stage formula_216, a realization formula_220 of the random process is known and formula_221 has been chosen. Therefore, one needs to solve the following problem

:formula_222

where formula_223 denotes the conditional expectation of formula_224 given formula_225. The optimal value of the above problem depends on formula_226 and formula_225 and is denoted formula_228.

Similarly, at stages formula_229, one should solve the problem

:formula_230

whose optimal value is denoted by formula_231. Finally, at stage formula_180, one solves the problem

:formula_233

==== Stagewise independent random process ====

For a general distribution of the process formula_234, it may be hard to solve these dynamic programming equations. The situation simplifies dramatically if the process formula_234 is stagewise independent, i.e., formula_234 is (stochastically) independent of formula_237 for formula_238. In this case, the corresponding conditional expectations become unconditional expectations, and the function formula_239, formula_183 does not depend on formula_241. That is, formula_242 is the optimal value of the problem

:formula_243

and formula_239 is the optimal value of

:formula_245

for formula_229.

==Software tools==

===Modelling languages===
All discrete stochastic programming problems can be represented with any algebraic modeling language, manually implementing explicit or implicit non-anticipativity to make sure the resulting model respects the structure of the information made available at each stage. 
An instance of an SP problem generated by a general modelling language tends to grow quite large (linearly in the number of scenarios), and its matrix loses the structure that is intrinsic to this class of problems, which could otherwise be exploited at solution time by specific decomposition algorithms.
Extensions to modelling languages specifically designed for SP are starting to appear, see:
*AIMMS - supports the definition of SP problems
*EMP SP (Extended Mathematical Programming for Stochastic Programming) - a module of GAMS created to facilitate stochastic programming (includes keywords for parametric distributions, chance constraints and risk measures such as Value at risk and Expected shortfall).
*SAMPL - a set of extensions to AMPL specifically designed to express stochastic programs (includes syntax for chance constraints, integrated chance constraints and Robust Optimization problems)
They both can generate SMPS instance level format, which conveys in a non-redundant form the structure of the problem to the solver.

<doc id="501901" wikidata="Q1515849" url="?curid=501901" title="Lanchester submachine gun">
<text>The Lanchester is a submachine gun (&quot;machine carbine&quot;) manufactured by the Sterling Armaments Company between 1941 and 1945. It is an evolution from MP28/II and was manufactured in two versions, Mk.1 and Mk.1*; the latter was a simplified version of the original Mk.1, with no fire selector and simplified sights. It was primarily used by the Royal Navy during the Second World War, and to a lesser extent by the Royal Air Force Regiment (for airfield protection). It was given the general designation of Lanchester after George Lanchester, who was charged with producing the weapon at the Sterling Armaments Company.

==History==
Following the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940, the Royal Air Force decided it required a submachine gun for airfield defence. With no time available for the usual research and development of a new weapon, it was decided to create a gun based on the German MP 28, after looking at two examples from Ethiopia. The British Admiralty decided to join with the RAF in adopting the new weapon, and played a key role in its design. Ultimately, it was within the Royal Navy that most of the Lanchesters that were produced went into service.

It was given the general designation of Lanchester after George Herbert Lanchester, who was charged with producing the weapon at the Sterling Armaments Company, the same company that later produced the Sterling submachine gun.

The Lanchester was envisioned as a weapon used for guarding prisoners and accompanying naval landing and assault parties. It was a very solid, well-made submachine gun of high-quality materials, in many ways the complete opposite of its direct contemporary, the Sten.

The Lanchester had a heavy wooden butt and stock, which was for simplicity copied from the British SMLE service rifle, a machined-steel action and breech block, a magazine housing made from solid brass (later steel) and a mounting on the muzzle for use of a long-bladed 1907 bayonet. The rifling differed from the German original in details to accommodate various lots of 9mm ammunition then being acquired for service use.

Produced in two versions, Mk.1 and Mk.1*. The Mk.1* was a simplified version of the original Mk.1, which omitted the fire mode selector (full automatic only) and used simplified sights.

==Production==
The first contract of 13 June 1941 produced an initial 50,000 Lanchesters that were nearly all for the Royal Navy use. The British Army by now had supplies of the relatively expensive US-produced Thompson SMG, whereas the RAF had chosen to instead test the S&amp;W Model 1940 Light Rifle (also US-produced, chambered in 9mm), whose use was not adopted and was mostly discarded. 

The final contract was issued on 9 October 1943. Production averaged 3,410 units per month over 28 months. According to contract records, Sterling was to have made guns serially numbered from 1 to 9999, then (S) A1 to about A64580. Certain numbers of Mk.1 were modified later in the war and designated Mk.1*, the key differences being the removal of the fire-selector switch and addition of simplified rear sights. This modification makes it difficult to ascertain exactly the production runs for each model.

There were four Lanchester assembly plants, though Lanchester assembly contracts were actually awarded to only three firms. Sterling assembly of the Lanchester was split between the Sterling Engineering Company Ltd in Dagenham (code S109), and the Sterling Armaments Company in Northampton (code M619).

Quantities produced:
*Sterling (two factories; codes S109 and M619): approx. 74,579.
*Greener (code M94): approx. 16,990.
*Boss (code S156): approx. 3,900.

Some early version do not appear to be code marked at all except by the serial number prefix of &quot;S&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, or &quot;SA&quot;. Pieces marked with the &quot;A&quot; prefix lacked perfect interchangeability and often required hand fitting of components.

==Markings==
The year of manufacture of any particular Lanchester can be found stamped in small almost indistinguishable numbers next to the crossed flags military proof mark on the top of the rearmost magazine housing flange.

Sterling-made MK.1 Lanchester guns are marked on top of the magazine housing as follows:
*LANCHESTER
*MK.I
*SA.
*XXXX

(&quot;S&quot; indicates Sterling manufacture and &quot;A&quot; indicates serial number prefix)

==Operation==
The Lanchester is an open-bolt, self-loading blowback-operated weapon with a selective-fire option (located in front of the trigger) on early versions. A tubular receiver was attached to the front of the wooden stock, which could be pivoted barrel down for maintenance and disassembly. The wooden stock was patterned after that of the Lee–Enfield rifle, and a bayonet lug centred below the muzzle accepted the Pattern 1907 sword-bayonet as used on the Lee–Enfield No. 1 Mk. III* (previously called the S.M.L.E.)

It used a straight 50-round magazine containing 9×19mm Parabellum cartridges (special pouches were produced to hold three magazines each) which fit into the magazine housing from the left, with spent cartridges ejected on the right. It was interchangeable with the shorter 32-round Sten magazine. A magazine loading tool was needed to load both 32- and 50-round magazines more easily. One of the two magazine pouches had a special pocket on the front for this loader.

Mk.1s featured a front blade sight with adjustable rifle-type sights, marked between 100 and 600 yards. Mk.1* featured a much simplified flip-up sight marked 100 or 200 yards.

Manual safety is made in the form of locking cut, made in the receiver, which engages the bolt handle to lock bolt in open (cocked) position. It proved notoriously susceptible to accidental discharge if the weapon were dropped. For cleaning, the weapon had a brass oiler bottle and pull through held inside the butt stock (similar to the Lee–Enfield rifle).

==Service==

The Lanchester was in service with the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy and other Empire navies throughout the war and for some decades after. The last examples left Royal Naval service in the 1970s and are now collectors&#x27; items.

A large number of Lanchesters were subsequently sold off to foreign nations. These are often marked with two broad arrows, point-to-point (appearing as a six-pointed star), stamped just before the serial number. This symbol is sometimes accompanied by the letter &quot;S&quot; and denotes &quot;Sold out of Service&quot;.

A number were acquired by Chile, Egypt and Argentina after purchasing former Royal Navy warships; those were often sold as “complete package” with everything aboard including the weapons locker.
During the 2023 Israel-Hamas war, a Lanchester was spotted in a weapons cache seized from slain Hamas fighters by the Israel Defense Forces. It was used during the Be&#x27;eri massacre as well.

<text>The Operational Art of War (TOAW) is a series of computer wargames noted for their scope, detail, and flexibility in recreating, at an operational level, the major land battles of the 20th century. A Norm Koger design, TalonSoft published the first of the series in 1998. Matrix Games bought the rights to the franchise and re-released the game in 2006 as TOAW 3.

==Gameplay==

==Games in the series==
TalonSoft published:
* &quot;The Operational Art of War Vol. 1: 1939–1955&quot; (1998)
* &quot;The Operational Art of War II: Modern Battles 1956–2000&quot; (1999)
* &quot;The Operational Art of War II: Flashpoint Kosovo&quot; (1999)
* &quot;The Operational Art of War II: Elite Edition&quot; (2000)
* &quot;The Operational Art of War: Century of Warfare&quot; (2000)
Matrix Games published:
* &quot;The Operational Art of War III&quot; (2006)
* &quot;The Operational Art of War IV&quot; (2017)

==Concept==
The basic appearance of the game is the traditional view onto a hexagonal grid, although the player may choose a map-like overhead view with military symbols and basic info for the units, or an isometric view that depicts the units with small pictures of soldiers, tanks, etc. Gameplay is turn-based.

The scale of the game is variable, with distances ranging from 2.5 km per hex to 50 km per hex, and each turn simulating from 1/4 day to 1 week of time, but is fundamentally &quot;operational&quot;, focusing on battalion, division, and corps combat. The option of scale is left to a maker of a particular scenario to choose, resulting in a wide range of user-made scenarios; ranging from, for example, a small engagement in northern Germany between several companies to an entire World War II on division scale.

The maximum number of units that can be made in a scenario was 2,000 per side until TOAW IV, although managing more than 200 can often be complicated. Each unit is assigned unique equipment (types of infantry, tanks, aircraft, etc.) and given its own name, info and color code.

The game also includes &quot;events&quot;, which is a series of programmable events which display a message and can have several different causes and effects. The variability of these events makes each scenario—when properly designed—very complex and variable. The maximum number of in-game events is 500 (or 1,000 for TOAW III version).

The games include a scenario editor, and much of the content in the follow-up games are designs developed by the community of avid players.

==Version IV==
Version IV was released November 2017, and included a large number of changes, among which are:
* unit limit increased from 2,000 to 10,000
* event limit increased from 999 to 10,000
* significant changes to naval combat
* significant changes to how combat uses turn time
* supply system

==Reception==
===Volume 1===
In the United States, &quot;The Operational Art of War&quot; sold 12,789 copies during 1998. These sales accounted for $555,681 in revenue that year.

===Volume 2===
In the United States, &quot;The Operational Art of War Volume II&quot; sold 1,298 copies during 1999.

<doc id="501904" wikidata="Q682618" url="?curid=501904" title="Berneray, North Uist">
<text>Berneray () is an island and community in the Sound of Harris, Scotland. It is one of fifteen inhabited islands in the Outer Hebrides. It is famed for its rich and colourful history which has attracted much tourism. It lies within the South Lewis, Harris and North Uist National Scenic Area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development.

With an area of , Berneray rises to a height of at Beinn Shlèibhe (Moor Hill) and at Cnoc Bhuirgh (Borve Hill). It is known for its sandy beaches backed with sand dunes. Tràigh Iar (West Beach), a three-mile stretch of wide, clean and often deserted sand, is widely acclaimed.

There is strong evidence that points to Berneray being inhabited since the Bronze Age, and possibly before. The island is scattered with ancient sacred sites, stone circles, signs of Viking inhabitation and historical buildings, some several centuries old.

Although Berneray is geographically closer to North Uist, it is part of the Bays of Harris Estate and under the Parish of Harris.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Berneray&quot; is from the Old Norse &quot;Bjarnar-øy&quot; and means either &quot;Bjorn&#x27;s island&quot; or possibly &quot;bear island&quot;. This island is known by Gaelic speakers as &quot;Beàrnaraigh na Hearadh&quot;, meaning &quot;Berneray of Harris&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;Beàrnaraigh Cheann Bharraigh&quot;, literally &quot;Berneray of Barra Head &quot;, now usually known in English simply as Barra Head and &quot;Beàrnaraigh Leòdhais&quot;, known as Great Bernera . More recently Gaelic speakers have also used &quot;Beàrnaraigh Uibhist,&quot; i.e. &quot;Berneray of Uist&quot; to refer to the northern Berneray.

==Demographics==

In common with most islands in the Outer Hebrides, the population declined during the 19th and 20th centuries. However, the past few years has seen a stabilisation. The island&#x27;s population was 138 as recorded by the 2011 census a small rise since 2001 when there were 136 usual residents. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. Most people on Berneray speak Scottish Gaelic, many as a first language.

==Commerce and transport==

The main industries are fishing, crofting (small-scale individual farming), media/IT and tourism. Broadband internet provision became available in January 2006, giving an incentive to people wishing to relocate to Berneray and helping sustain the population and community.

A key feature of Berneray is its machair. The machair is a coastal plain made up of windblown shell sand. Traditional crofting practice, which involves summer agriculture using seaweed together with dung from winter grazing animals as natural fertiliser, has, over time, bound together and stabilised the land. The machair is ploughed in rotation, giving a patchwork of crops and fallow of different ages which supports a wide range of flowers. Berneray has a particularly fine machair, a result of careful husbandry by the island&#x27;s crofters, helped by the absence of rabbits.
The youth hostel on Berneray is part of the Gatliff Hebridean Hostels Trust. The hostel consists of two restored black houses and is located at a magnificent setting overlooking the sound of Harris.

Possibly the greatest change in modern times occurred in 1999 when the causeway opened between Berneray and Otternish on North Uist. This has eased travelling on and off the island, improving employment prospects and accelerating the carriage of produce (notably, crabs and lobster). The causeway contains culverts that allow the easy passage of otters and fish from one side of the structure to the other. The causeway was formally opened by Prince Charles in April 1999. It is the first of a series of causeways connecting islands in the area. The North Ford Causeway (the A865) connects North Uist to the Isle of Benbecula. The South Ford Causeway (still the A865) connects Benbecula to South Uist. Finally, the Eriskay Causeway connects South Uist to Eriskay.

Berneray is served by regular local bus services from Lochmaddy on North Uist, many of which form part of the &quot;Spine Route&quot; from Eriskay. Most services are operated by Grenitote Travel, with funding from Comhairle nan Eilean Siar. Berneray is also linked to Harris, Scotland via Leverburgh by the ferry , operated by Caledonian MacBrayne.

The CalMac ferry is named after the largest loch on Berneray. It can occasionally be seen relieving for MV &quot;Loch Portain&quot;.

==Nature==
The crofting practices also encourage a wide array of wildlife on Berneray. On early summer evenings you can sometimes hear snipe drumming, and even the rasp of a corncrake. Mute swans can be seen on Loch Brusda, and greylag geese are common. In the winter they are joined by barnacle, and a few brent geese. Ravens, grey herons and buzzards are often to be seen. Golden eagles and hen harriers are rarer sights, usually in the winter. Wading birds on the shore include redshank, sanderling, turnstone, oystercatcher, dunlin, curlew, whimbrel, ringed plover.

Further out, around the shores of Berneray, are mallards, eiders, red-breasted mergansers, and, more rarely, black-throated and great northern divers. Shags and cormorants fish in the seas around Berneray throughout the year, and in summer you can see gannets diving. Common seals often congregate at low tide on the rocks in Bays Loch, and can often be seen from the parking area a little way beyond the Post Office or by taking a boat trip out into the bay. Grey seals, which are larger and can be distinguished by the long &quot;Roman&quot; noses, also haul out there occasionally, but are more common off the West Beach. Though the otters of Berneray are out during the day more often than on the mainland, they are still elusive, and it takes patience and luck to see one.

==Media and the arts==
A documentary entitled Shepherds of Berneray was aired on UK television in 1981.

Berneray was in world news in 1987 when it was found that Charles, Prince of Wales had visited the island to live a normal Berneray life as a crofter. He lived and worked with a crofter for one week and his visit spawned the later television documentary, &quot;A Prince Among Islands&quot;, in 1991.

In 2007 a DVD called &quot;The Old New Year – a living tradition on the Isle of Berneray&quot; - was released about the island&#x27;s &quot;Oidhche Challainn&quot; (&quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;, literally &quot;Night of the Calends) celebration of New Year on 12 January in line the former Highland tradition of following the Julian Calendar.

In 2009 it was reported that Berneray&#x27;s west beach had been used to advertise Kae Bae beach in Trat Province, Thailand. A VisitScotland spokeswoman said that &quot;I&#x27;m sure it is a compliment in disguise.&quot;

The traditional Gaelic song &#x27;Fàgail Bheàrnaraigh&#x27; (Leaving Berneray) later became the American folk song &quot;O, Waly, Waly&#x27; The Water is Wide&quot; with new lyrics added in English.

The English singer Vashti Bunyan wrote much of her debut album &quot;Just Another Diamond Day&quot; while living in a croft on Berneray. She revisits her old home at the end of Kieran Evans&#x27; documentary film about Bunyan&#x27;s early life, &quot;Vashti Bunyan: From Here To Before&quot;.

==Famous residents==

<text>Comma-separated values (CSV) is a text file format that uses commas to separate values, and newlines to separate records. A CSV file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, where each line of the file typically represents one data record. Each record consists of the same number of fields, and these are separated by commas in the CSV file. If the field delimiter itself may appear within a field, fields can be surrounded with quotation marks.

The CSV file format is one type of delimiter-separated file format. Delimiters frequently used include the comma, tab, space, and semicolon. Delimiter-separated files are often given a &quot;.csv&quot; extension even when the field separator is not a comma. Many applications or libraries that consume or produce CSV files have options to specify an alternative delimiter.

The lack of adherence to the CSV standard RFC 4180 necessitates the support for a variety of CSV formats in data input software. Despite this drawback, CSV remains widespread in data applications and is widely supported by a variety of software, including common spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel. Benefits cited in favor of CSV include human readability and the simplicity of the format.

==Applications==
CSV is a common data exchange format that is widely supported by consumer, business, and scientific applications. Among its most common uses is moving tabular data between programs that natively operate on incompatible (often proprietary or undocumented) formats. For example, a user may need to transfer information from a database program that stores data in a proprietary format, to a spreadsheet that uses a completely different format. Most database programs can export data as CSV. Most spreadsheet programs can read CSV data, allowing CSV to be used as an intermediate format when transferring data from a database to a spreadsheet.

CSV is also used for storing data. Common data science tools such as Pandas include the option to export data to CSV for long-term storage. Benefits of CSV for data storage include the simplicity of CSV makes parsing and creating CSV files easy to implement and fast compared to other data formats, human readability making editing or fixing data simpler, and high compressibility leading to smaller data files. Alternatively, CSV does not support more complex data relations and makes no distinction between null and empty values, and in applications where these features are needed other formats are preferred.

==Specification==
 proposes a specification for the CSV format; however, actual practice often does not follow the RFC and the term &quot;CSV&quot; might refer to any file that:

# is plain text using a character encoding such as ASCII, various Unicode character encodings (e.g. UTF-8), EBCDIC, or Shift JIS,
# consists of records (typically one record per line),
# with the records divided into fields separated by delimiters (typically a single reserved character such as comma, semicolon, or tab; sometimes the delimiter may include optional spaces),
# where every record has the same sequence of fields.

Within these general constraints, many variations are in use. Therefore, without additional information (such as whether RFC 4180 is honored), a file claimed simply to be in &quot;CSV&quot; format is not fully specified. As a result, some applications supporting CSV files have text import wizards that allow users to preview the first few lines of the file and then specify the delimiter character(s), quoting rules, and field trimming.

== History ==
Comma-separated values is a data format that predates personal computers by more than a decade: the IBM Fortran (level H extended) compiler under OS/360 supported CSV in 1972. List-directed (&quot;free form&quot;) input/output was defined in FORTRAN 77, approved in 1978. List-directed input used commas or spaces for delimiters, so unquoted character strings could not contain commas or spaces.

The term &quot;comma-separated value&quot; and the &quot;CSV&quot; abbreviation were in use by 1983. The manual for the Osborne Executive computer, which bundled the SuperCalc spreadsheet, documents the CSV quoting convention that allows strings to contain embedded commas, but the manual does not specify a convention for embedding quotation marks within quoted strings.

Comma-separated value lists are easier to type (for example into punched cards) than fixed-column-aligned data, and they were less prone to producing incorrect results if a value was punched one column off from its intended location.

Comma separated files are used for the interchange of database information between machines of two different architectures. The plain-text character of CSV files largely avoids incompatibilities such as byte-order and word size. The files are largely human-readable, so it is easier to deal with them in the absence of perfect documentation or communication.

The main standardization initiative—transforming &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; fuzzy definition&quot; into a more precise and &quot;de jure&quot; one—was in 2005, with , defining CSV as a MIME Content Type. Later, in 2013, some of RFC 4180&#x27;s deficiencies were tackled by a W3C recommendation.

In 2014 IETF published describing the application of URI fragments to CSV documents. RFC 7111 specifies how row, column, and cell ranges can be selected from a CSV document using position indexes.

In 2015 W3C, in an attempt to enhance CSV with formal semantics, publicized the first &quot;drafts of recommendations&quot; for CSV metadata standards, which began as &quot;recommendations&quot; in December of the same year.

==General functionality==
CSV formats are best used to represent sets or sequences of records in which each record has an identical list of fields. This corresponds to a single relation in a relational database, or to data (though not calculations) in a typical spreadsheet.

The format dates back to the early days of business computing and is widely used to pass data between computers with different internal word sizes, data formatting needs, and so forth. For this reason, CSV files are common on all computer platforms.

CSV is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values (many implementations of CSV import/export tools allow other separators to be used; for example, the use of a &quot;Sep=^&quot; row as the first row in the *.csv file will cause Excel to open the file expecting caret &quot;^&quot; to be the separator instead of comma &quot;,&quot;). Simple CSV implementations may prohibit field values that contain a comma or other special characters such as newlines. More sophisticated CSV implementations permit them, often by requiring &quot; (double quote) characters around values that contain reserved characters (such as commas, double quotes, or less commonly, newlines). Embedded double quote characters may then be represented by a pair of consecutive double quotes, or by prefixing a double quote with an escape character such as a backslash (for example in Sybase Central).

CSV formats are not limited to a particular character set. They work just as well with Unicode character sets (such as UTF-8 or UTF-16) as with ASCII (although particular programs that support CSV may have their own limitations). CSV files normally will even survive naïve translation from one character set to another (unlike nearly all proprietary data formats). CSV does not, however, provide any way to indicate what character set is in use, so that must be communicated separately, or determined at the receiving end (if possible).

Databases that include multiple relations cannot be exported as a single CSV file. Similarly, CSV cannot naturally represent hierarchical or object-oriented data. This is because every CSV record is expected to have the same structure. CSV is therefore rarely appropriate for documents created with HTML, XML, or other markup or word-processing technologies.

Statistical databases in various fields often have a generally relation-like structure, but with some repeatable groups of fields. For example, health databases such as the Demographic and Health Survey typically repeat some questions for each child of a given parent (perhaps up to a fixed maximum number of children). Statistical analysis systems often include utilities that can &quot;rotate&quot; such data; for example, a &quot;parent&quot; record that includes information about five children can be split into five separate records, each containing (a) the information on one child, and (b) a copy of all the non-child-specific information. CSV can represent either the &quot;vertical&quot; or &quot;horizontal&quot; form of such data.

In a relational database, similar issues are readily handled by creating a separate relation for each such group, and connecting &quot;child&quot; records to the related &quot;parent&quot; records using a foreign key (such as an ID number or name for the parent). In markup languages such as XML, such groups are typically enclosed within a parent element and repeated as necessary (for example, multiple codice_1 nodes within a single codice_2 node). With CSV there is no widely accepted single-file solution.

==Standardization==
The name &quot;CSV&quot; indicates the use of the comma to separate data fields. Nevertheless, the term &quot;CSV&quot; is widely used to refer to a large family of formats that differ in many ways. Some implementations allow or require single or double quotation marks around some or all fields; and some reserve the first record as a header containing a list of field names. The character set being used is undefined: some applications require a Unicode byte order mark (BOM) to enforce Unicode interpretation (sometimes even a UTF-8 BOM). Files that use the tab character instead of comma can be more precisely referred to as &quot;TSV&quot; for tab-separated values.

Other implementation differences include the handling of more commonplace field separators (such as space or semicolon) and newline characters inside text fields. One more subtlety is the interpretation of a blank line: it can equally be the result of writing a record of zero fields, or a record of one field of zero length; thus decoding it is ambiguous.

=== RFC 4180 and MIME standards === 
The 2005 technical standard RFC 4180 formalizes the CSV file format and defines the MIME type &quot;text/csv&quot; for the handling of text-based fields. However, the interpretation of the text of each field is still application-specific. Files that follow the RFC 4180 standard can simplify CSV exchange and should be widely portable. Among its requirements:
* MS-DOS-style lines that end with (CR/LF) characters (optional for the last line).
* An optional header record (there is no sure way to detect whether it is present, so care is required when importing).
* Each record &quot;should&quot; contain the same number of comma-separated fields.
* Any field &quot;may&quot; be quoted (with double quotes).
* Fields containing a line-break, double-quote or commas &quot;should&quot; be quoted. (If they are not, the file will likely be impossible to process correctly.)
* &quot;If&quot; double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote in a field &quot;must&quot; be represented by two double-quote characters.

The format can be processed by most programs that claim to read CSV files. The exceptions are &quot;(a)&quot; programs may not support line-breaks within quoted fields, &quot;(b)&quot; programs may confuse the optional header with data or interpret the first data line as an optional header, and &quot;(c)&quot; double-quotes in a field may not be parsed correctly automatically.

=== OKF frictionless tabular data package ===

In 2011 Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF) and various partners created a data protocols working group, which later evolved into the Frictionless Data initiative. One of the main formats they released was the Tabular Data Package. Tabular Data package was heavily based on CSV, using it as the main data transport format and adding basic type and schema metadata (CSV lacks any type information to distinguish the string &quot;1&quot; from the number 1).

The Frictionless Data Initiative has also provided a standard CSV Dialect Description Format for describing different dialects of CSV, for example specifying the field separator or quoting rules.

=== W3C tabular data standard ===
In 2013 the W3C &quot;CSV on the Web&quot; working group began to specify technologies providing higher interoperability for web applications using CSV or similar formats. The working group completed its work in February 2016 and is officially closed in March 2016 with the release of a set of documents and W3C recommendations
for modeling &quot;Tabular Data&quot;, and enhancing CSV with metadata and semantics.

While the well-formedness of CSV data can readily checked, testing validity and canonical form is less well developed, relative to more precise data formats, such as XML and SQL, which offer richer types and rules-based validation.

==Basic rules==
Many informal documents exist that describe &quot;CSV&quot; formats.
IETF RFC 4180 (summarized above) defines the format for the &quot;text/csv&quot; MIME type registered with the IANA.

Rules typical of these and other &quot;CSV&quot; specifications and implementations are as follows:
==Example==
The above table of data may be represented in CSV format as follows:

 Year,Make,Model,Description,Price
 1997,Ford,E350,&quot;ac, abs, moon&quot;,3000.00
 1999,Chevy,&quot;Venture &quot;Extended Edition&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,4900.00
 1999,Chevy,&quot;Venture &quot;Extended Edition, Very Large&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,5000.00
 1996,Jeep,Grand Cherokee,&quot;MUST SELL!
 air, moon roof, loaded&quot;,4799.00

Example of a USA/UK CSV file (where the decimal separator is a period/full stop and the value separator is a comma):

 Year,Make,Model,Length
 1997,Ford,E350,2.35
 2000,Mercury,Cougar,2.38

Example of an analogous European CSV/DSV file (where the decimal separator is a comma and the value separator is a semicolon):

 Year;Make;Model;Length
 1997;Ford;E350;2,35
 2000;Mercury;Cougar;2,38

The latter format is not RFC 4180 compliant. Compliance could be achieved by the use of a comma instead of a semicolon as a separator and by quoting all numbers that have a decimal mark.

==Application support==

Some applications use CSV as a data interchange format to enhance its interoperability, exporting and importing CSV. Others use CSV as an &quot;internal format&quot;.

As a data interchange format: the CSV file format is supported by almost all spreadsheets and database management systems,
* Spreadsheets including Apple Numbers, LibreOffice Calc, and Apache OpenOffice Calc. Microsoft Excel also supports a dialect of CSV with restrictions in comparison to other spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel still cannot export CSV files in the commonly used UTF-8 character encoding, and separator is not enforced to be the comma). LibreOffice Calc CSV importer is actually a more generic delimited text importer, supporting multiple separators at the same time as well as field trimming.
* Various Relational databases support saving query results to a CSV file. PostgreSQL provides the codice_3 command, which allows for both saving and loading data to and from a file. saves the content of a table codice_4 to a file called codice_5.
* Many utility programs on Unix-style systems (such as cut, paste, join, sort, uniq, awk) can split files on a comma delimiter, and can therefore process simple CSV files. However, this method does not correctly handle commas or new lines within quoted strings, hence it is better to use tools like csvkit or Miller.

As (main or optional) internal representation. Can be native or foreign, but differ from interchange format (&quot;export/import only&quot;) because it is not necessary to create a copy in another format:
* Some Spreadsheets including LibreOffice Calc offers this option, without enforcing user to adopt another format.
* Some relational databases, when using standard SQL, offer &quot;foreign-data wrapper&quot; (FDW). For example, PostgreSQL offers the and commands to configure any variant of CSV.
* Databases like Apache Hive offer the option to express CSV or .csv.gz as an internal table format.
* The emacs editor can operate on CSV files using csv-nav mode.

CSV format is supported by libraries available for many programming languages. Most provide some way to specify the field delimiter, decimal separator, character encoding, quoting conventions, date format, etc.

===Software and row limits===
Programs that work with CSV may have limits on the maximum number of rows CSV files can have.
Below is a list of common software and its limitations:
* Microsoft Excel: 1,048,576 row limit;
* Microsoft PowerShell, no row or cell limit. (Memory Limited)
* Apple Numbers: 1,000,000 row limit;
* Google Sheets: 5,000,000 cell limit (the product of columns and rows);
* OpenOffice and LibreOffice: 1,048,576 row limit;
* Sourcetable: no row limit. (Spreadsheet-database hybrid);
* Text Editors (such as WordPad, TextEdit, Vim, etc.): no row or cell limit;
* Databases (COPY command and FDW): no row or cell limit.

<text>Max More (born Max T. O&#x27;Connor, January 1964, with name legally changed in 1990) is a philosopher and futurist who writes, speaks, and consults on emerging technologies. He was the president and CEO of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation between 2010 and 2020.

Born in Bristol, England, More has a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford (1987). His 1995 University of Southern California doctoral dissertation &quot;The Diachronic Self: Identity, Continuity, and Transformation&quot; examined several issues that concern transhumanists, including the nature of death, and what it is about each individual that continues despite great change over time. In 1996, he married transhumanist Natasha Vita-More; the couple are close collaborators on transhumanist and life extension research.

More founded the Extropy Institute and has written many articles espousing the philosophy of transhumanism and the transhumanist philosophy of extropianism, including his &quot;Principles of Extropy&quot;. In a 1990 essay &quot;Transhumanism: Toward a Futurist Philosophy&quot;, he introduced the term &quot;transhumanism&quot; in its modern sense.

<doc id="501911" wikidata="Q5532070" url="?curid=501911" title="General National Vocational Qualification">
<text>A General National Vocational Qualification, or GNVQ, was a certificate of vocational education in the United Kingdom. The last GNVQs were awarded in 2007.

The qualifications related to occupational areas in general, rather than any specific job. They could be taken in a wide range of subjects. There were different levels of GNVQ, namely the Intermediate level (equivalent to four General Certificates of Secondary Education) and Advanced level (equivalent to two Advanced-level General Certificates of Education).
GNVQs were available to people of all ages. Many schools and colleges offered these courses and they could be studied alongside GCSEs or A levels. The GNVQ generally involved much coursework (6-8 large assignments), which allowed holders to show their skills when applying for jobs.

GNVQs were used in many schools in Wales in three main subjects: Engineering, Health and Social Care, and Leisure and Tourism. They were commonly used between early 2000 and 2005 as one-year courses for post-GCSE students who wished to further their education within the sixth-form but not at an A-Level standard. The course was generally undertaken in Wales at Intermediate level with day-release at an appropriate work placement during school hours for the duration of the year. Subsequent to 2005 many schools stopped using GNVQ courses in the sixth form and after 2004 incorporated Intermediate or Foundation level GNVQs into the syllabus in years 10 and 11 along with GCSEs. This was to encourage more students to undertake vocational areas of study as part of their compulsory education. The majority of one-year courses for sixth formers were then replaced with BTEC First Diplomas and Certificates.

GNVQs ceased to be offered in late 2007. Pupils in England and Wales are able to undertake BTEC and OCR national certificates and diplomas instead. Alternatives to GNVQ qualifications include vocational GCSEs, BTEC diplomas and certificates, OCR Nationals and City and Guild progression awards. The Diploma in Digital Applications, launched in 2005, was seen as a successor to GNVQ ICT, however many centres quickly switched to the equivalent OCR National qualification due to issues with DiDA&#x27;s assessment format.

<doc id="501912" wikidata="Q789357" url="?curid=501912" title="Baleshare">
<text>Baleshare () is a flat tidal island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. Baleshare lies to the south-west of North Uist. Its economics and community were boosted by the building of a causeway in 1962. The causeway was built by William Tawse Ltd. The island is extremely flat by Hebridean standards, rising to only above sea level and known for its long sandy beach. It has a population of 49 living in two settlements: Samhla and Teananachar.

== Place names and locations ==
The name means &quot;east farm&quot; or &quot;east town&quot;. The &quot;west town&quot; may have been on land that was said to exist to the west of Baleshare, washed away in the sixteenth century, over which it was possible to walk to the Monach Islands at low tide. The Monachs are some to the west. Another story suggests there was once a land bridge to Kirkibost, to the north. The basis for this seems to be a reference in the Exchequer Rolls for 1542 that the valued rental had been decreased due to encroachment by the sea at some unspecified (presumably recent) date.

== Archaeology ==
Two prehistoric settlements have been uncovered, which contain the remains of a circular stone house and pieces of pottery, bone and metal. In common with other sites in the area, they are threatened by coastal erosion.

Baelshare was chosen as one of the pilot projects for the Shorewatch programme, which aimed to training community groups to search for new archaeological sites and record information on them to be passed on to local and national archives. In the first year of the pilot project, 2005, the island was severely affected by storms. In some cases, up to 50 metres of the coast were lost in a single night. Between August and December 2005, up to four metres of archaeological remains were lost to erosion.

<doc id="501921" wikidata="Q157008" url="?curid=501921" title="Rinderpest">
<text>Rinderpest (also cattle plague or steppe murrain) was an infectious viral disease of cattle, domestic water buffalo, and many other species of even-toed ungulates, including gaurs, buffaloes, large antelope, deer, giraffes, wildebeests, and warthogs. The disease was characterized by fever, oral erosions, diarrhea, lymphoid necrosis, and high mortality. Death rates during outbreaks were usually extremely high, approaching 100% in immunologically naïve populations. Rinderpest was mainly transmitted by direct contact and by drinking contaminated water, although it could also be transmitted by air.

Rinderpest is believed to have originated in Asia, and to have spread by transport of cattle. The term &quot;Rinderpest&quot; () is a German word meaning &#x27;cattle plague&#x27;. The rinderpest virus (RPV) is closely related to the measles and canine distemper viruses. The measles virus may have emerged from rinderpest as a zoonotic disease around 600 BC, a period that coincides with the rise of large human settlements. After a global eradication campaign that began in the mid-20th century, the last confirmed case of rinderpest was diagnosed in 2001. In 2010, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) announced that field activities in the decades-long, worldwide campaign to eradicate the disease were ending, paving the way for a formal declaration in June 2011 of the global eradication of rinderpest. This makes it only the second disease in history to be fully wiped out, following smallpox.
==Virus==
Rinderpest virus (RPV), a member of the genus &quot;Morbillivirus&quot;, is closely related to the measles and canine distemper viruses. Like other members of the &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot; family, it produces enveloped virions, and is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus. The virus is particularly fragile and is quickly inactivated by heat, desiccation, and sunlight.

Measles virus evolved from the then-widespread rinderpest virus most probably between the 11th and 12th centuries. The earliest likely origin is during the seventh century; some linguistic evidence exists for this earlier origin. In 2020 research on the measles virus has suggested a modified understanding of the evolution of rinderpest. Work on preserved older samples of measles (1912 and following) have been tested in various ways to determine the likely trajectory of the measles virus&#x27; divergence from rinderpest. It is thought based on this study that the earliest date at which the divergence could have occurred is the sixth century BC.

==Disease and symptoms==

Death rates during outbreaks were usually extremely high, approaching 100% in immunologically naïve populations. The disease was mainly spread by direct contact and by drinking contaminated water, although it could also be transmitted by air.

Initial symptoms include fever, loss of appetite, and nasal and eye discharges. Subsequently, irregular erosions appear in the mouth, the lining of the nose, and the genital tract. Acute diarrhea, preceded by constipation, is also a common feature. Most animals die six to twelve days after the onset of these clinical signs. The delayed appearance of these signs of illness account for the steady spread of the disease once a historical outbreak began: an animal infected by rinderpest undergoes an incubation period of 3–15 days. Signs of the disease only manifest at the end of that time. Cattle and wild ungulates will normally die 8–12 days after signs of the disease emerge, by which time the animals may have travelled far from the place of infection and been mixed with many other animals.

==History and epizootics==

===Early history===
The disease is believed to have originated in Asia, later spreading through the transport of cattle. Other cattle epizootics are noted in ancient times: a cattle plague is thought to be one of the 10 plagues of Egypt described in the Hebrew Bible. By around 3,000 BC, a cattle plague had reached Egypt, and rinderpest later spread throughout the remainder of Africa, following European colonization.

In the 4th century, Roman writer Severus Sanctus Endelechius described rinderpest in his book, &quot;On the Deaths of Cattle&quot;.

===18th century===
Cattle plagues recurred throughout history, often accompanying wars and military campaigns. They hit Europe especially hard in the 18th century, with three long panzootics, which although varying in intensity and duration from region to region, took place in the periods of 1709–1720, 1742–1760, and 1768–1786. In the 18th century a deadly outbreak between 1769 and 1785 resulted in universal governmental action, but with somewhat divergent responses. The Dutch and the German principalities demanded quarantines and strict burial practices; England and large parts of Italy (the Papal States) saw slaughter of infected animals; in the Austrian Netherlands (Flanders) the response was inspection and precautionary slaughter coupled with compensation to the owners. There was no code of practice and no standard response. But for a hundred years thereafter in German-speaking countries there was intense focus on the problem of Rinderpest.

====Inoculation====
In the early 18th century, the disease was seen as similar to smallpox, due to its analogous symptoms. The personal physician of the pope, Giovanni Maria Lancisi, recommended the destruction of all infected and exposed animals. This policy was not very popular and was used only sparingly in the first part of the century. Later, it was used successfully in several countries, although it was sometimes seen as too costly or drastic, and depended on a strong central authority to be effective (which was notably lacking in the Dutch Republic). Because of these downsides, numerous attempts were made to inoculate animals against the disease. These attempts met with varying success, but the procedure was not widely used and was no longer practiced at all in 19th-century Western or Central Europe. Rinderpest was an immense problem, but inoculation was not a valid solution. In many cases, it caused too many losses. Even more importantly, it perpetuated the circulation of the virus in the cattle population. The pioneers of inoculation did contribute significantly to knowledge about infectious diseases. Their experiments confirmed the concepts of those who saw infectious diseases as caused by specific agents, and were the first to recognize maternally derived immunity.

====Early English experimentation====
The first written report of rinderpest inoculation was published in a letter signed &quot;T.S.&quot; in the November 1754 issue of &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, a widely read journal which also supported the progress of smallpox inoculation. This letter reported that a Mr Dobsen had inoculated his cattle and had thus preserved 9 out of 10 of them, although this was retracted in the next issue, as it was apparently a Sir William St. Quintin who had done the inoculating (this was done by placing bits of material previously dipped in morbid discharge into an incision made in the dewlap of the animal). These letters encouraged further application of inoculation in the fight against diseases. The first inoculation against measles was made three years after their publication.

From early 1755 onwards, experiments were taking place in the Netherlands, as well, results of which were also published in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. As in England, the disease was seen as analogous with smallpox. While these experiments were reasonably successful, they did not have a significant impact: the total number of inoculations in England appears to have been very limited, and after 1780, the English interest in inoculation disappeared almost entirely. Almost all further experimentation was done in the Netherlands, northern Germany and Denmark.

====Further trials in the Netherlands====
Due to a very severe outbreak at the end of the 1760s, some of the best-known names in Dutch medicine became involved in the struggle against the disease. Several independent trials were begun, most notably by Pieter Camper in Groningen and Friesland. The results of his experiment in Friesland were encouraging, but they proved to be the exception; testing by others in the provinces of Utrecht and Friesland obtained disastrous results. As a result, the Frisian authorities concluded in 1769 that the cause of rinderpest was God&#x27;s displeasure with the sinful behavior of the Frisian people and proclaimed 15 November a day of fasting and prayer. Interest in inoculation declined sharply across the country.

In this climate of discouragement and scepticism, Geert Reinders, a farmer in the province of Groningen and a self-taught man, decided to continue the experiments. He collaborated with Wijnold Munniks, who had supervised earlier trials. They tried different inoculation procedures and a variety of treatments to lighten the symptoms, all of them without significant effect. Although they were not able to perfect the inoculation procedure, they did make some useful observations.

Reinders resumed his experiments in 1774, concentrating on the inoculation of calves from cows that had recovered from rinderpest. He was probably the first to make practical use of maternally derived immunity. The detailed results of his trials were published in 1776 and reprinted in 1777. His inoculation procedure did not differ much from what had been used previously, except for the use of three separate inoculations at an early age. This produced far better results, and the publication of his work renewed interest in inoculation. For the period of 1777 to 1781, 89% of inoculated animals survived, compared to a 29% survival rate after natural infection.

In the Netherlands, too, interest in rinderpest inoculation declined in the 1780s because the disease itself decreased in intensity.

====In other countries====
Apart from the Dutch Republic, the only other regions where inoculation was used to any significant level were northern Germany and Denmark. Experiments started in Mecklenburg during the epizootic of the late 1770s. &quot;Insurance companies&quot; were created which provided inoculation in special &quot;institutes&quot;. Although these were private initiatives, they were created with full encouragement from the authorities. Though neighboring states followed this practice with interest, the practice never caught on outside Mecklenburg; many were still opposed to inoculation.

While some experimentation occurred in other countries (most extensively in Denmark), in the majority of European countries, the struggle against the disease was based on stamping it out. Sometimes, this could be done with minimal sacrifices; at other times, it required slaughter at a massive scale.

===19th century===
There were major outbreaks of cattle plague documented from the mid-century onwards. Responses to these outbreaks differed across the world.

==== Rinderpest in 19th-century Europe ====

A major outbreak affected the whole of the British Isles for three years after 1865. In August 1865 an Order of the British Privy Council required the slaughter of rinderpest-affected cattle. By early May 1867, the overall slaughter total was around 75,000 cattle, which at that time had a value of approximately £10 per head. Initially, £55,000 was granted (after a period of delay) to compensate farmers where they complied with the slaughter directive but had no other source of compensation. In certain areas, such as Aberdeenshire and Norfolk, farmers had banded together to provide mutual assurance by creating a resource pool against the risk of rinderpest. Because the initial slaughter regime was not backed by compensation, it was the presence of a voluntary mutual assurance scheme that drove down the infection rates by guaranteeing payment for compliance with the government instruction. The Privy Council ordered a detailed investigation of the disaster, which reported in 1868.

In 1871, there was held an international Rinderpest convention in Vienna. It was purposed to establish mechanisms for reporting outbreaks to warn neighbouring countries, and so as to establish policies for inspections, quarantines and disinfections as well as monitoring the cattle trade.

In 1879, there was a notable cattle plague outbreak in Congress Poland and parts of Prussia, resulting in the slaughter of animals. Impacted cities included Warsaw, Posen, and Sochaczew. Prussian authorities considered military border guards to help hinder the spread of the disease.

==== Rinderpest in 19th-century Africa ====

Around the turn of the century, a plague struck in Southern Africa. Spinage establishes a critical commentary on the theory that in 1888, rinderpest was introduced into Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia) by the invading Italian army, which supposedly brought with them infected cattle from India. The procurement chain is not traced beyond an Egyptian businessman from Cairo, but it is possible that the British Army got their draft oxen from India. However, the documentary chain only supported limited negative conclusions. &quot;There is therefore no evidence in contemporary accounts that the rinderpest panzootic was imported from India with infected oxen to provision the Italian landing at Massawa.&quot; It may now be impossible to disentangle the probabilities of where rinderpest initially came from- invading Italians, invading Egyptians or local break-outs in Eritrea. Once in progress, the infection eventually spread to the shores of Lake Victoria and into German Tanzania.

Sunseri concentrates on the detailed progress of the epizootic in German Tanzania, endeavouring to show that the disease was known to be present but was not officially recognised as being rinderpest. He emphasises in particular the failure by the German government to rely on or accept a post mortem in 1892 professionally medically conducted on an affected animal that had been duly diagnosed as having rinderpest. The diagnosis was procured at the personal behest of the governor and remitted to Berlin. It appears that awareness of a cattle plague in general did not amount to the German government accepting that the plague was rinderpest, for which measures of a strict kind were prescribed in Germany itself. The governor, Julius von Soden, personally lost his own herd, and this may have led him to secure the post-mortem so as to challenge the official diagnostic silence. The impact on African-owned herds was drastic. 

The disease was locally described as &quot;sadoka&quot; and it also affected local wildlife. Sunseri&#x27;s thesis basically explains the German government&#x27;s failure to recognise the true nature of the disease as permitting ineffective policies. The local German government was short of cash, without a vet until the late 1890s and surrounded by innumerable serious cattle diseases apart from rinderpest. The 1885 protectorate status of Tanzania (ruled by the German East Africa Company) had been interrupted by coastal rebellion: when formal German rule began and the military went inland in 1891 to pacify areas, they encountered massive cattle deaths ostensibly due to viral spread from wildlife (one assumes at waterholes). Some observers themselves described the outbreak as rinderpest, whereas argument and debate continued because of essentially lack of consistent information and detailed investigation. When the German governor requested confirmation as to a course of action, he would have been fully aware of the administrative consequences, had matters been dealt with in Germany (quarantines, slaughter policies, disinfection controls of cattle transport and control of products suspected of contact with contaminated animals).

In the event, the post-mortem was reviewed in Berlin and determined to be incomplete: a diagnosis could only be made on the ground by a vet. Funding vets was not a priority as most of the cattle by then (1892) had died. Meanwhile, a German staff doctor with an interest in animal diseases opined (two long Reports for the German Colonial Service) that the problem must be an Africa-specific matter not the familiar rinderpest. His confusion may derive from the absence of impact of rinderpest on German wildlife. This is now explained by the fenced and manicured German agricultural landscape of the day being insufficiently &quot;wild&quot; and livestock normally being kept apart. By 1893, government regulatory response was as though the disease had been rinderpest in Germany (and included preventive slaughter). Cattle exports were banned in 1893 (to improve local stocks not on grounds of confining spread, as some cattle were exempt). Nevertheless importation, legal or illegal or rebranded via Zanzibar, reached the British colonies in the south.

Marquardt concentrates on the detailed progress of the disease in South Africa during the 1896 outbreak. Between 1896 and 1897, 95% of the cattle in South Africa were killed by the disease. The primary spreading agency seems to be the common use of waterholes by wild ungulates and herded cattle. The herded cattle were normally in transit and the long incubation period and delayed symptoms meant that spreading had taken place before illness was realised. His initial case study is Southern Bechuanaland settled as it then was by two distinct cattle-focused groups: the Tswana people and the Boers. It was flat, hot and dry and was considered good cattle-raising country. Water was regularly available by drilling 20-30 feet below the surface, though many farms had water only by drilling 50-100 feet down. From 1882 onwards, designated Tswana reserves were created adjoining white farms in many instances. African pastoralism was constrained by this. From 1895, increasing numbers of white settlers (now administered from the Cape) evicted the Tswana and tension between these groups was inevitable. The 1896 drought resulted in fewer watering places being available, and a greater density of usage including both groups of cattle-owners and the wild animals. By May 1896, the vast Clober farm had become a focus of infection with immediate slaughter policies in place. Three river drinking places, mainly used by the Tswana group, recorded over 12,000 head of cattle regularly each; the government was reluctant to embark on wholesale destruction. The government tried, and failed, to stop herds crossing rivers and perpetuating stock-mingling. The spread of the disease was relentless in the Bechuanaland Protectorate. The connection between rinderpest and starvation was recognised by the British government as cause for urgent intervention by delivery of food relief. In 1896, 30,000 tons of mealies (corn) were delivered for the relief of the Bechuanaland Protectorate. Meanwhile, the Crocodile River in the Transvaal was reported as choked with cattle and other animal corpses, but remained in use. During the dry season, the government made no attempt to control use of the watering holes, fearing the consequences if they did. The Boers essentially did no better, mainly because they continued to migrate their cattle between parcels of land rather than remaining stationery within a particular parcel. 

Complaint by both Boer and Tswana groups was focused on the government rather than mutual hostility. Fencing, and quarantining coupled with killing of infected cattle, was a policy barely controllable in the expanses of the colony, though it had some success in England. However, fencing resulted in herd-mingling and consequent infection. The Tswana herds were quarantined together; the Boer herds were also quarantined but on their own land. The system was very unpopular. The policy was scorned and pilloried in the press: plenty of reports came out to the effect that the disease was spread by the quarantine guards and by the vets, all of whom were less than careful about disinfecting themselves. It is plausible that the major spreader of disease should be negligent government officials or contractors moving directly from areas known to be diseased to other areas in protective quarantine. In Southern Bechuanaland alone, over 400 men were hired as quarantine guards. Owners from both groups resisted the guards and the Boers vigorously resisted the killing of their cattle. It is likely both groups raised the fences, and several Boer groups deliberately spread the disease in order to claim the compensation. By 1896, it was generally recognised the government campaign had completely failed, overwhelmed by a storm of contributory causes to the spread of the disease.

The outbreak in the 1890s killed an estimated 80–90% of all cattle in eastern and southern Africa. Sir Arnold Theiler was instrumental in developing a vaccine that curbed the epizootic. The consequences for the Africans were especially severe. Though cattle numbers revived subsequently, the consequent human toll was mass starvation in the absence of herding, hunting and farming. It is estimated that the human losses were as high as one-third of the population of Ethiopia and two-thirds of the Maasai people of Tanzania. This famine caused significant depopulation in sub-Saharan Africa, allowing thornbush to colonise. This formed ideal habitat for tsetse fly, which carries sleeping sickness, and is unsuitable for livestock; &quot;hence the European view of an empty unspoiled Africa teeming with game&quot;.
==== Rinderpest in 19th-century Asia ====
Japan also sustained the presence of rinderpest in the 19th century as illustrated in an anonymous print. The disease was present for centuries in China, Japan and Korea. Japanese black and Korean yellow breed cattle were known to be especially susceptible to it.

In 1868, there was a serious outbreak of rinderpest in India, which was investigated by Colonel James Hallen of the Indian Cattle Plague Commission leading to the publication of his survey in 1871. The Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory from 1893 was at Mukteshwar in India. It hosted much research work and many samples. Its founding director was British pathologist Alfred Lingard.

In India, some farmers were reported as not hostile to tigers because of the consideration that their attacks on diseased or weaker animals reduced the risk of rinderpest.

===20th century===
In his classic study of the Nuer of southern Sudan, E. E. Evans-Pritchard suggested rinderpest might have affected the Nuer&#x27;s social organization before and during the 1930s. Since the Nuer were pastoralists, much of their livelihood was based on cattle husbandry, and bride-prices were paid in cattle; prices may have changed as a result of cattle depletion. Rinderpest might also have increased dependence on horticulture among the Nuer.

Rinderpest was eradicated from Japan in 1922, as recorded by the Nippon Institute for Biological Science. Distinguished Japanese scientist and Director of the Nippon Institute for Biological Science, Junji Nakamura (1903–1975), was a major researcher into rinderpest, and the contribution of his work to the worldwide eradication of rinderpest was acknowledged by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. The FAO posthumously presented a certificate of appreciation in 2011.

A more recent rinderpest outbreak in Africa in 1982–1984 resulted in an estimated US$2 billion in stock losses.

===Vaccination===
In 1917–18, William Hutchins Boynton (1881–1959), the chief veterinary pathologist with the Philippine Bureau of Agriculture, developed an early vaccine for rinderpest, based on treated animal organ extracts.

In 1959, rinderpest vaccine was prepared at government laboratories in Abuko in The Gambia from the spleen of infected cattle.

Walter Plowright worked on a vaccine for the RBOK strain of the rinderpest virus for multiple years, from 1956 to 1962. Plowright was awarded the World Food Prize in 1999 for developing a vaccine against a strain of rinderpest. In 1999, the FAO predicted that with vaccination, rinderpest would be eradicated by 2010.

==Eradication==

Widespread eradication efforts began in the early 20th century although, until the 1950s, they mostly took place on an individual country basis, using vaccination campaigns. In 1924, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) was formed in response to rinderpest. In 1950, the Inter-African Bureau of Epizootic Diseases was formed, with the stated goal of eliminating rinderpest from Africa. With the loss of its wildebeest population, the Serengeti experienced radical fire regime shift to intense annual wildfires. During the 1960s, a program called JP 15 attempted to vaccinate all cattle in participating countries and, by 1979, only one of the countries involved, Sudan, reported cases of rinderpest. In the decades since, the wildebeest have returned to the Serengeti and tree cover has returned with them.

In 1969, an outbreak of the disease originated in Afghanistan, travelling westwards and promoting a mass vaccination plan, which by 1972, had eliminated rinderpest in all areas of Asia except for Lebanon and India; both countries were the site of further occurrences of the disease in the 1980s.

During the 1980s, however, an outbreak of rinderpest from Sudan spread throughout Africa, killing millions of cattle, as well as wildlife. In response, the Pan-African Rinderpest Campaign was initiated in 1987, using vaccination and surveillance to combat the disease. By the 1990s, nearly all of Africa, with the exception of parts of Sudan and Somalia, was declared free of rinderpest.

Worldwide, the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme was initiated in 1994, supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the OIE, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. This program was successful in reducing rinderpest outbreaks to few and far between by the late 1990s. The program is estimated to have saved affected farmers approximately 58 million net euros.

The end was in sight by 2000 when only the Horn of Africa and Pakistan appeared to have a continued presence. Mariner &quot;et al.&quot;, 2000 introduced participatory disease surveillance to rinderpest efforts. The last confirmed case of rinderpest was reported in Kenya in 2001. Since then, while no cases have been confirmed, the disease is believed to have been present in parts of Somalia past that date. The final vaccinations were administered in 2006, and the last surveillance operations took place in 2009, failing to find any evidence of the disease.

The Mariner method continued to be used in those two locations (the Horn and Pakistan) to track down possible lingering refugia in the coming years. In 2008, scientists involved in rinderpest eradication efforts believed a good chance existed that rinderpest would join smallpox as officially &quot;wiped off the face of the planet&quot;. The FAO, which had been co-ordinating the global eradication program for the disease, announced in November 2009 that it expected the disease to be eradicated within 18 months.

In October 2010, the FAO announced it was confident the disease has been eradicated. The agency said that &quot;[a]s of mid 2010, FAO is confident that the rinderpest virus has been eliminated from Europe, Asia, Middle East, Arabian Peninsula, and Africa,&quot; which were the locations where the virus had been last reported. Eradication was confirmed by the World Organization for Animal Health on 25 May 2011.

On 28 June 2011, FAO and its members countries officially recognized global freedom from the deadly cattle virus. On this day, the FAO Conference, the highest body of the UN agency, adopted a resolution declaring the eradication of rinderpest. The resolution also called on the world community to follow up by ensuring that samples of rinderpest viruses and vaccines be kept under safe laboratory conditions and that rigorous standards for disease surveillance and reporting be applied. &quot;While we are celebrating one of the greatest successes for FAO and its partners, I wish to remind you that this extraordinary achievement would not have been possible without the joint efforts and strong commitments of governments, the main organizations in Africa, Asia and Europe, and without the continuous support of donors and international institutions&quot;, FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf commented.

The rinderpest eradication effort is estimated to have cost $5 billion.

Stocks of the rinderpest virus are still maintained by highly specialized laboratories. In 2015, FAO launched a campaign calling for the destruction or sequestering of the remaining stocks of rinderpest virus in laboratories in 24 countries, citing risks of inadvertent or malicious release.

On 14 June 2019, the largest stock of the rinderpest virus was destroyed at the Pirbright Institute.

==Use as a biological weapon==
Rinderpest was one of more than a dozen agents the United States government researched as potential biological weapons before terminating its biological weapons program.

Rinderpest is of concern as a biological weapon for the following reasons:
* The disease has high rates of morbidity and mortality.
* The disease is highly communicable and spreads rapidly once introduced into nonimmune herds.
* Cattle herds are no longer immunized against RPV, so are susceptible to infection.

Rinderpest was also considered as a biological weapon in a United Kingdom government programme during World War II.

<text>Lost (&quot;Lòsda&quot; in Scottish Gaelic; population: less than 24; is a hamlet in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It lies west of Aberdeen in the Cairngorm mountains. The hamlet is situated near the village of Bellabeg where the Water of Nochty feeds into the River Don. Despite its small population, the people of Lost are famed for their strength and honour.

The name comes from the Gaelic word for inn (&quot;taigh òsda&quot;); today the hamlet has a few houses, a war memorial and a farm.

It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. As a result, Lost has regularly had eponymous street sign theft. Each sign costs approximately £100 to replace. As a result, Aberdeenshire Council tried to change its name to &quot;Lost Farm&quot;; however, in the face of strong local opposition, the proposal was dropped. The council then erected a sign which was welded (rather than clipped) to the post holding it up in an attempt to deter theft.

<doc id="501935" wikidata="Q16147946" url="?curid=501935" title="Cantar de gesta">
<text>A cantar de gesta is the Spanish equivalent of the Old French medieval &quot;chanson de geste&quot; or &quot;songs of heroic deeds&quot;. 

The most important &quot;cantares de gesta&quot; of Castile were:
* The &quot;Cantar de Mio Cid&quot;, where the triumph of the true nobility, founded on effort, merit and optimism is narrated, as opposed to the blood nobility that the fictitious characters Infantes of Carrión represent.
* The &quot;Poema de Fernán González&quot;, which presents a mix of history and legend concerning the first Count of Castile, Fernán González.
* The &quot;Cantar de los Siete Infantes de Lara&quot;, where a right revenge long delayed is narrated.
* The &quot;Cantar de Bernardo del Carpio&quot;, that narrates the tragic history of a bastard of noble origin attempting to procure the release from prison of his father, Count of Saldaña, jailed for having secretly married the King&#x27;s sister; in his efforts to rehabilitate the family honor, he is unfairly treated by his king Alfonso the Chaste.
* The &quot;Mocedades de Rodrigo&quot; composed around 1360 is the latest epic cantar épico that is conserved. It is based on an earlier cantar of the youth of Rodrigo that dates from the second half of the 13th century. It narrates events in the youth of El Cid.

Smaller importance had the &quot;Mainete&quot;, the &quot;Cantar del Cerco de Zamora&quot; and others. However, only the &quot;Cantar de Mio Cid&quot;, the &quot;Cantar de Rodrigo&quot; and a few verses of the &quot;Cantar de Roncesvalles&quot; have been preserved in written form. The philologues have reconstructed other passages of the lost Castilian epic from fragments turned into prose in chronicles, where they served as sources of information. 

The characteristics of the Spanish &quot;cantares de gesta&quot; are: 
* Irregular verses, mainly between 14 and 16 syllables, divided in two hemistiches and with assonant rhyme, as opposed to regular verses and consonant rhyme of French &quot;chansons de geste&quot;.
* Predominance of realism and historicity as opposed to the more legendary and less historical character of French &quot;chanson de geste&quot;.
* Use of expressions that demand the attention of the public.
* Very abundant verbs, because the action predominates.
* Suppression of formulas that introduce the direct dialogue with the purpose of making the narration more agile, perhaps because some passages of Spanish &quot;cantares de gesta&quot; were semi-enacted (thereof also its greater realism).
* Use of brief descriptions, full of plasticity.
* Use of epic names to characterize the individuals.
* Use of the paragogic &quot;e&quot;.

<doc id="501937" wikidata="Q7806405" url="?curid=501937" title="Timeline of the Texas Revolution">
<text>This is a timeline of the Texas Revolution, spanning the time from the earliest independence movements of the area of Texas, over the declaration of independence from Spain, up to the secession of the Republic of Texas from Mexico.

The first shot of the Texas Revolution was fired at the Battle of Gonzales on October 2, 1835. This marked the beginning of the revolution. Over the next three months, the Texian colonists drove all Mexican army troops out of the province. . General Jose Urrea marched half of the troops up the Texas coast in the Goliad campaign, while Santa Anna led the rest of the troops to San Antonio de Bexar. After a thirteen-day siege, Santa Anna&#x27;s army defeated the small group of Texians at the Battle of the Alamo and continued east. Many Texians, including the government, fled their homes in the Runaway Scrape. On March 19 the Texas troops marched into an open prairie outside of Goliad during a heavy fog. When they stopped to rest their animals, Urrea and his main army surrounded them. The Texas force numbered at least 300 soldiers, and the Mexicans had 300 to 500 troops. With no choice but battle, James Fannin chose to stand and fight near Coleto Creek. Santa Anna and his troops searched for the Texian government and the Texian army led by Sam Houston. On April 21, 1836, the Texans defeated Santa Anna&#x27;s army at the Battle of San Jacinto; Santa Anna was captured the following day. The Mexican army retreated back to Mexico City, ending the Texas Revolution. Texas was now an independent colony and later joined the United States.

<text>A Daim bar ( ) is a Swedish chocolate bar made from crunchy almond caramel covered in milk chocolate.

==History==
Daim was created by Marabou in Sweden in the 1950s. Marabou originally wanted to produce a version of the American Heath Co.&#x27;s bar; its vice president Lars Anderfelt inquired about licensing Heath&#x27;s exact recipe. The Heath Co. refused but gave Anderfeldt a list of their ingredients. From this, Marabou created their own recipe, testing it in Stockholm in 1952 with great success. It was launched under the name Dajm throughout Sweden and Norway the next year, Finland in 1963, and Denmark in 1971. It was renamed &quot;Daim&quot; in most countries in 1990, although it continued to be marketed in the United Kingdom and Ireland as Dime. The brand was purchased by the American company Kraft Foods in 1993 and is now held by Mondelez International, which Kraft spun off in 2012.

A famous 1995 television commercial (directed by John Lloyd) for the chocolate bar in the United Kingdom featured the comedian Harry Enfield, in which a salesman describes the Daim bar as &quot;smooth on the outside, crunchy on the inside&quot;, while a customer says he prefers armadillos, which are &quot;smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside.&quot; Another successful commercial campaign was launched in 1996, and featured a spoof of Raiders of the Lost Ark. An unnamed adventurer uses a Daim bar to avoid triggering a death trap in an ancient temple, only to then return for the chocolate bar and take his chances with the crumbling structure. In 2005, the spelling in the UK and Ireland was changed to &quot;Daim&quot;, in line with the rest of the world.

In 2007, a &#x27;Limited Edition Cappucino&#x27; Daim bar was released. A limited edition forest fruit bar has also been released, as well as Coke Daim, white chocolate Daim, dark chocolate Daim, blueberry Daim, lemon-orange Daim and mint Daim. An orange chocolate Daim was sold in the UK and Ireland in winter 2023. As of March 2023, limited-edition caramel latte Daim bars were available in multi-packs in the UK, as well as a Strawberry variant which was released in early 2024. Daim bars imported from Sweden (manufactured in Upplands Väsby) have been sold in many countries.

Since the early 2000s, McDonald&#x27;s McFlurry is available with Daim in France.

In 2023, IKEA announced it would no longer stock Mondelez International products, including Daim. As opposed to joining dozens of Scandinavian companies that cut ties with Mondelez over the tax it paid to the Russian government, IKEA cited the decision was made as they are focusing on Ikea-branded confectionery products and have further developed their own chocolate and candy products.

<doc id="501973" wikidata="Q487937" url="?curid=501973" title="Hemostasis">
<text>In biology, hemostasis or haemostasis is a process to prevent and stop bleeding, meaning to keep blood within a damaged blood vessel (the opposite of hemostasis is hemorrhage). It is the first stage of wound healing. Hemostasis involves three major steps:
* vasoconstriction
* temporary blockage of a hole in a damaged blood vessel by a platelet plug
* blood coagulation (formation of fibrin clots)

Coagulation, the changing of blood from a liquid to a gel which forms the fibrin clots, is essential to hemostasis. Intact blood vessels moderate blood&#x27;s tendency to form clots. The endothelial cells of intact vessels prevent blood clotting with a heparin-like molecule and thrombomodulin, and prevent platelet aggregation with nitric oxide and prostacyclin. When endothelium of a blood vessel is damaged, the endothelial cells stop secretion of coagulation and aggregation inhibitors and instead secrete von Willebrand factor, which initiates the maintenance of hemostasis after injury. These processes seal the injury or hole until tissues are healed.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;hemostasis&quot; (, &quot;sometimes&quot; ) uses the combining forms and , Neo-Latin from Ancient Greek (similar to ), meaning &quot;blood&quot;, and , meaning &quot;&quot;, yielding &quot;motionlessness or stopping of blood&quot;.

==Steps of mechanism==
Hemostasis occurs when blood is present outside of the body or blood vessels. It is the innate response for the body to stop bleeding and loss of blood. During hemostasis three steps occur in a rapid sequence. Vascular spasm is the first response as the blood vessels constrict to allow less blood to be lost. In the second step, platelet plug formation, platelets stick together to form a temporary seal to cover the break in the vessel wall. The third and last step is called coagulation or blood clotting. Coagulation reinforces the platelet plug with fibrin threads that act as a &quot;molecular glue&quot;. Platelets are a large factor in the hemostatic process. They allow for the creation of the &quot;platelet plug&quot; that forms almost directly after a blood vessel has been ruptured. Within seconds of a blood vessel&#x27;s epithelial wall being disrupted, platelets begin to adhere to the sub-endothelium surface. It takes approximately sixty seconds until the first fibrin strands begin to intersperse among the wound. After several minutes the platelet plug is completely formed by fibrin. Hemostasis is maintained in the body via three mechanisms:

# Vascular spasm: Vasoconstriction is produced by vascular smooth muscle cells, and is the blood vessel&#x27;s first response to injury. The smooth muscle cells are controlled by vascular endothelium, which releases intravascular signals to control the contracting properties. When a blood vessel is damaged, there is an immediate reflex, initiated by local sympathetic pain receptors, which helps promote vasoconstriction. The damaged vessels will constrict (vasoconstrict) which reduces the amount of blood flow through the area and limits the amount of blood loss. Collagen is exposed at the site of injury, the collagen promotes platelets to adhere to the injury site. Platelets release cytoplasmic granules which contain serotonin, ADP and thromboxane A2, all of which increase the effect of vasoconstriction. The spasm response becomes more effective as the amount of damage is increased. Vascular spasm is much more effective in smaller blood vessels.
# Platelet plug formation: Platelets adhere to damaged endothelium to form a platelet plug (&quot;primary hemostasis&quot;) and then degranulate. This process is regulated through thromboregulation. Plug formation is activated by a glycoprotein called von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is found in plasma. Platelets play one of major roles in the hemostatic process. When platelets come across the injured endothelium cells, they change shape, release granules and ultimately become ‘sticky’. Platelets express certain receptors, some of which are used for the adhesion of platelets to collagen. When platelets are activated, they express glycoprotein receptors that interact with other platelets, producing aggregation and adhesion. Platelets release cytoplasmic granules such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serotonin and thromboxane A2. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) attracts more platelets to the affected area, serotonin is a vasoconstrictor and thromboxane A2 assists in platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction and degranulation. As more chemicals are released more platelets stick and release their chemicals; creating a platelet plug and continuing the process in a positive feedback loop. Platelets alone are responsible for stopping the bleeding of unnoticed wear and tear of our skin on a daily basis. This is referred to as primary hemostasis.
# Clot formation: Once the platelet plug has been formed by the platelets, the clotting factors (a dozen proteins that travel along the blood plasma in an inactive state) are activated in a sequence of events known as &#x27;coagulation cascade&#x27; which leads to the formation of fibrin from inactive fibrinogen plasma protein. Thus, a fibrin mesh is produced all around the platelet plug to hold it in place; this step is called &quot;secondary hemostasis&quot;. During this process some red and white blood cells are trapped in the mesh which causes the primary hemostasis plug to become harder: the resultant plug is called a thrombus or blood clot. The blood clot contains the secondary hemostasis plug with blood cells trapped in it. This is a necessary step for wound healing, but it has the ability to cause severe health problems if the thrombus becomes detached from the vessel wall and travels through the circulatory system; If it reaches the brain, heart or lungs it could lead to stroke, heart attack, or pulmonary embolism respectively.

==Types==
Hemostasis can be achieved in various other ways if the body cannot do it naturally (or needs help) during surgery or medical treatment. When the body is under shock and stress, hemostasis is harder to achieve. Though natural hemostasis is most desired, having other means of achieving this is vital for survival in many emergency settings. Without the ability to stimulate hemostasis the risk of hemorrhaging is great. During surgical procedures, the types of hemostasis listed below can be used to control bleeding while avoiding and reducing the risk of tissue destruction. Hemostasis can be achieved by chemical agent as well as mechanical or physical agents. Which hemostasis type used is determined based on the situation.

Developmental Haemostasis refers to the differences in the haemostatic system between children and adults.

==In emergency medicine==
Debates by physicians and medical practitioners still continue to arise on the subject of hemostasis and how to handle situations with large injuries. If an individual acquires a large injury resulting in extreme blood loss, then a hemostatic agent alone would not be very effective. Medical professionals continue to debate on what the best ways are to assist a patient in a chronic state; however, it is universally accepted that hemostatic agents are the primary tool for smaller bleeding injuries.

Some main types of hemostasis used in emergency medicine include:
* Chemical/topical – This is a topical agent often used in surgery settings to stop bleeding. Microfibrillar collagen is the most popular choice among surgeons [recent source?] because it attracts the patient&#x27;s natural platelets and starts the blood clotting process when it comes in contact with the platelets. This topical agent requires the normal hemostatic pathway to be properly functional.
* Direct pressure or pressure dressing – This type of hemostasis approach is most commonly used in situations where proper medical attention is not available. Putting pressure and/or dressing to a bleeding wound slows the process of blood loss, allowing for more time to get to an emergency medical setting. Soldiers use this skill during combat when someone has been injured because this process allows for blood loss to be decreased, giving the system time to start coagulation.
* Sutures and ties – Sutures are often used to close an open wound, allowing for the injured area to stay free of pathogens and other unwanted debris to enter the site; however, it is also essential to the process of hemostasis. Sutures and ties allow for skin to be joined back together allowing for platelets to start the process of hemostasis at a quicker pace. Using sutures results in a quicker recovery period because the surface area of the wound has been decreased.
* Physical agents (gelatin sponge) – Gelatin sponges have been indicated as great hemostatic devices. Once applied to a bleeding area, a gelatin sponge quickly stops or reduces the amount of bleeding present. These physical agents are mostly used in surgical settings as well as after surgery treatments. These sponges absorb blood, allow for coagulation to occur faster, and give off chemical responses that decrease the time it takes for the hemostasis pathway to start.

==Disorders==
The body&#x27;s hemostasis system requires careful regulation in order to work properly. If the blood does not clot sufficiently, it may be due to bleeding disorders such as hemophilia or immune thrombocytopenia; this requires careful investigation. Over-active clotting can also cause problems; thrombosis, where blood clots form abnormally, can potentially cause embolisms, where blood clots break off and subsequently become lodged in a vein or artery.

Hemostasis disorders can develop for many different reasons. They may be congenital, due to a deficiency or defect in an individual&#x27;s platelets or clotting factors. A number of disorders can be acquired as well, such as in HELLP syndrome, which is due to pregnancy, or Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), which is due to &quot;E. coli&quot; toxins.

==History of artificial hemostasis==
The process of preventing blood loss from a vessel or organ of the body is referred to as hemostasis. The term comes from the Ancient Greek roots &quot;heme&quot; meaning blood, and &quot;stasis&quot; meaning halting; Put together means the &quot;halting of the blood&quot;.
The origin of hemostasis dates back as far as ancient Greece; first referenced to being used in the Battle of Troy. It started with the realization that excessive bleeding inevitably equaled death. Vegetable and mineral styptics were used on large wounds by the Greeks and Romans until the takeover of Egypt around 332BC by Greece. At this time many more advances in the general medical field were developed through the study of Egyptian mummification practice, which led to greater knowledge of the hemostatic process. It was during this time that many of the veins and arteries running throughout the human body were found and the directions in which they traveled. Doctors of this time realized if these were plugged, blood could not continue to flow out of the body. Nevertheless, it took until the invention of the printing press during the fifteenth century for medical notes and ideas to travel westward, allowing for the idea and practice of hemostasis to be expanded.

==Research==
There is currently a great deal of research being conducted on hemostasis. The most current research is based on genetic factors of hemostasis and how it can be altered to reduce the cause of genetic disorders that alter the natural process hemostasis.

Von Willebrand disease is associated with a defect in the ability of the body to create the platelet plug and the fibrin mesh that ultimately stops the bleeding. New research is concluding that the von Willebrand disease is much more common in adolescence. This disease negatively hinders the natural process of Hemostasis causing excessive bleeding to be a concern in patients with this disease. There are complex treatments that can be done including a combination of therapies, estrogen-progesterone preparations, desmopressin, and Von Willebrand factor concentrates. Current research is trying to find better ways to deal with this disease; however, much more research is needed in order to find out the effectiveness of the current treatments and if there are more operative ways to treat this disease.

<doc id="501974" wikidata="Q1381737" url="?curid=501974" title="Maghrebi cuisine">
<text>Maghreb cuisine is the cooking of the Maghreb region, the northwesternmost part of Africa along the Mediterranean Sea, consisting of the countries of Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. Well-known dishes from the region include &quot;couscous&quot;, &quot;pastilla&quot;, &quot;tajine&quot; and &quot;shakshouka&quot;.

==Origins==
The cuisine of the Maghreb, the western region of North Africa, includes that of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya, and is by origin a mixture of Arabian, Berber and Mediterranean cuisines, with historic influences from Ottoman and European cuisines. The cuisines of Algeria, Tunisia and Libya and Morocco have also been influenced by French and Italian cuisine respectively.

==Cuisine==

In Maghrebi cuisine, the most common staple foods are wheat (for &quot;khobz&quot; bread and &quot;couscous&quot;), fish, seafood, goat, lamb, beef, dates, almonds, olives and various vegetables and fruits.

Because the region is predominantly Muslim, &quot;halal&quot; meats are usually eaten. Most dishes are spiced.

The use of legumes, nuts, fruits and spices is very prominent. Salt-preserved lemons (&quot;l&#x27;hamd mrakad&quot;) and so-called &quot;oil-cured&quot; olives are distinctive elements of the cuisine.

The best-known Maghrebi dish abroad is &quot;couscous&quot;, made from wheat semolina. The &quot;tajine&quot;, a cooking vessel made of clay, is also a common denominator in this region, although the dishes and preparation methods vary widely. For example, a &quot;tajine&quot; in Tunisia is a baked quiche-like dish, whereas in Morocco it is a slow-cooked stew. &quot;Pastilla&quot; is also an important Andalusian dish of the region.

===Spices===
Spices found in this region&#x27;s cuisine are ginger, allspice, caraway, saffron, paprika, cloves, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper and turmeric. Fresh peppermint, parsley, or coriander are also very common. Spice mixtures such as &quot;ras el hanout&quot;, &quot;baharat&quot;, and chili pastes like &quot;harissa&quot; (especially in Tunisia) are frequently used as well.

<text>The Congaree Vista is a section of Columbia, South Carolina, between the Congaree River and the central business district of downtown.

The neighborhood was revitalized during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The section includes many small, upscale shops and restaurants, often in renovated warehouse buildings. &quot;The Vista,&quot; as it is known by locals, is centered on one of the city&#x27;s old train stations along Gervais Street. Also in this area is the historic Adluh Flour Mill, one of the few productive remnants of the district&#x27;s industrial past. In the past decade, the Vista has become a major entertainment and retail district for downtown Columbia and the Midlands (South Carolina) region of the state. Several hotels have been constructed in the area due to its economic benefits and close proximity to the University of South Carolina and centralized downtown location.

<text>Near Instantaneous Companded Audio Multiplex (NICAM) is an early form of lossy compression for digital audio. It was originally developed in the early 1970s for point-to-point links within broadcasting networks. In the 1980s, broadcasters began to use NICAM compression for transmissions of stereo TV sound to the public.

== History ==
=== Near-instantaneous companding ===
The idea was first described in 1964. In this, the &#x27;ranging&#x27; was to be applied to the analogue signal before the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) and after the digital-to-analogue converter (DAC). The application of this to broadcasting, in which the companding was to be done entirely digitally after the ADC and before the DAC, was described in a 1972 BBC Research Report.

=== Point-to-point links ===
NICAM was originally intended to provide broadcasters with six high-quality audio channels within a total bandwidth of 2048 kbit/s. This figure was chosen to match the E1 primary multiplex rate, and systems using this rate could make use of the planned PDH national and international telecommunications networks.

Several similar systems had been developed in various countries, and in about 1977/78 the BBC Research Department conducted listening tests to evaluate them. The candidates were:
* A RAI system which used A-law companding to compress 14-bit linear PCM samples into 10 bits (14:10)
* A NICAM-type system proposed by Télédiffusion de France (14:9)
* NICAM-1 (13:10)
* NICAM-2 (14:11)
* NICAM-3 (14:10)

It was found that NICAM-2 provided the best sound quality, but reduced programme-modulated noise to an unnecessarily low level at the expense of bit rate. NICAM-3, which had been proposed during the test to address this, was selected as the winner.

Audio is encoded using 14 bit pulse-code modulation at a sampling rate of 32 kHz.

=== Broadcasts to the public ===

NICAM&#x27;s second role – transmission to the public – was developed in the 80s by the BBC. This variant was known as NICAM-728, after the 728 kbit/s bitstream it is sent over. It uses the same audio coding parameters as NICAM-3.

The first NICAM digital stereo programme was the First Night of the 92nd edition of the Proms which was broadcast on BBC2 from the Crystal Palace transmitting station in London on 18 July 1986, though programmes were not advertised as being broadcast in stereo on the BBC until Saturday 31 August 1991, by which time the majority of the country&#x27;s transmitters had been upgraded to broadcast NICAM, and a large number of BBC programmes were being made in stereo. coming as many as 18 months after ITV and Channel 4 had begun advertising this capability to co-inside with the Independent Broadcasting Authority rolling out NICAM on a transmitter-by-transmitter basis which had begun in 1989 with the Crystal Palace and Emley Moor transmitters.

It has been standardized as ETS EN 300 163.

==== Nations and regions using NICAM public broadcasts ====
Several European countries had implemented NICAM with the PAL and SECAM TV systems
* Belgium (analogue cable systems only; terrestrial switched to DVB-T)
* Croatia (historical, switched to DVB-T and later DVB-T2, analog cable seems to either be mono or use analog A2 stereo)
* Denmark (historical, switched to DVB-T and DVB-C)
* Estonia (historical, switched to DVB-T and DVB-C)
* Finland (historical, switched to DVB-T and DVB-C)
* France (historical, switched to DVB-T)
* Greece (ANT1, New Hellenic Television, ET3 and ET1 - historical, switched to DVB-T)
* Hungary (historical, switched to DVB-T)
* Iceland (historical, switched to DVB-T)
* Ireland (historical, switched to DVB-T. Analogue cable channels may still carry NICAM audio. However, these are digitally sourced channels re-encoded as PAL with NICAM at the headend.)
* Luxembourg (switched to DVB-T; cable?)
* Norway (historical, switched to DVB-T and DVB-C)
* Poland (Analogue cable systems only; terrestrial switched to DVB-T)
* Portugal (historical, switched to DVB-T)
* Romania (historical on terrestrial as switched to DVB-T2; on cable networks, still used by some operators providing analogue cable television)
* Russia
* Spain (historical, switched to DVB-T)
* South Africa (SABC 1, SABC 2, e.tv)
* Sweden (historical, switched to DVB-T and DVB-C)
* Ukraine
* United Kingdom (historical, switched to DVB-T)

Some Asia-Pacific nations and regions have implemented NICAM
* China
** Hong Kong (commonly used for dual language for programming containing both Cantonese and English/Mandarin/Japanese/Korean soundtracks; full switchover to DTMB with Dolby AC-3 audio encoding complete by 1 December 2020, NICAM became historical from that date)
** Macau (commonly used for dual language for programming containing both Cantonese and Portuguese/English/Mandarin/Japanese/Korean soundtracks; full switchover to DTMB with MPEG-1 Audio Layer II audio encoding complete by 30 June 2023, NICAM became historical from that date)
* Malaysia
** Formerly used by TV1, TV2, ntv7, 8TV, and TV9 around Klang Valley. TV3 also used NICAM on their VHF transmission frequency (Channel 12) in the Klang Valley, but used Zweikanalton on their UHF transmission frequency (Channel 29). Analog shutdown complete by 1 January 2019, thus NICAM and Zweikanalton broadcast became historical from that date.
* New Zealand (Full switchover to DVB-T complete by 1 December 2013. NICAM became historical from that date.)
* Indonesia
** Most national television networks in Indonesia used NICAM for analogue television. Analog shutdown complete by August 12, 2023, thus NICAM became historical from that date.
* Singapore (Used on Mediacorp Channel U. Full switchover to DVB-T2 complete by 1 January 2019. NICAM became historical from that date.)
* Sri Lanka
* Thailand
** Used on Channel 3, Channel 9 MCOT HD and Thai PBS, usually broadcast in dual-sound mode with sometimes in stereo mode. All analogue television service ceased since March 26, 2020. Switchover to terrestrial DVB-T2 with HE-AAC v2 codec, NICAM became historical from that date.
Some other countries use Zweikanalton analogue stereo instead. Analogue stereo conversion thus begins.

==Implementations==

No consumer grade equipment capable of NICAM modulation is presently known. Below is a non-exhaustive list of broadcast grade equipment capable of NICAM coding and or modulation:

* Philips PM5685/PM5686/PM5686A
* Philips PM5687
* Eiden 198A
* Pye/Varian/BBC Sound-in-Syncs solution
* IBA/RE Communications Sound-in-Syncs solution
* Tektronix 728E
* Rohde &amp; Schwarz SBUF-E NICAM Module
* Barco NE-728

==Operation==
In order to provide mono &quot;compatibility&quot;, the NICAM signal is transmitted on a subcarrier alongside the sound carrier. This means that the FM or AM regular mono sound carrier is left alone for reception by monaural receivers.

A NICAM-based stereo-TV infrastructure can transmit a stereo TV programme as well as the mono &quot;compatibility&quot; sound at the same time, or can transmit two or three entirely different sound streams. This latter mode could be used to transmit audio in different languages, in a similar manner to that used for in-flight movies on international flights. In this mode, the user can select which soundtrack to listen to when watching the content by operating a &quot;sound-select&quot; control on the receiver.

The spectrum of NICAM on the PAL system differs from that on the SECAM L system where the NICAM sound carrier is at 5.85 MHz, before the AM sound carrier, and the video bandwidth is reduced from 6.5 MHz to 5.5 MHz.

NICAM currently offers the following possibilities. The mode is automatically selected by the inclusion of a 3-bit type field in the data stream.
* One digital stereo sound channel. 
* Two completely different digital mono sound channels. 
* One digital mono sound channel and a 352 kbit/s data channel. 
* One 704 kbit/s data channel.

The four other options could be implemented at a later date. Only the first two of the ones listed are known to be in general use however.

=== NICAM packet transmission ===

The NICAM packet (except for the header) is scrambled with a nine-bit pseudo-random bit-generator before transmission.
* The topology of this pseudo-random generator yields a bitstream with a repetition period of 511 bits.
* The pseudo-random generator&#x27;s polynomial is: formula_1
* The pseudo-random generator is initialized with: formula_2

Making the NICAM bitstream look more like white noise is important because this reduces signal patterning on adjacent TV channels.
* The NICAM header is not subject to scrambling. This is necessary so as to aid in locking on to the NICAM data stream and resynchronisation of the data stream at the receiver.
* At the start of each NICAM packet the pseudo-random bit generator&#x27;s shift register is reset to all ones.

=== NICAM transmission problems ===

There are some latent issues involved with the processing of NICAM audio in the transmission chain.
* NICAM (unlike the Compact Disc standard) samples 14-bit audio at 32 kHz.
* The upper frequency limit of a NICAM sound channel is 15 kHz due to anti-aliasing filters at the encoder. 
* The original 14-bit PCM audio samples are companded digitally to 10 bits for transmission.
* NICAM audio samples are divided into blocks of 32. If all the samples in a block are quiet, such that the most significant bits are all zeros, these bits can be discarded at no loss.
* On louder samples some of the least significant bits are truncated, with the hope that they will be inaudible.
* A 3-bit control signal for each block records which bits were discarded.
* Digital companding (using a CCITT J.17 pre-emphasis curve) ensures that the encoding and decoding algorithms can track perfectly.

=== NICAM carrier power ===
ITU (and CCITT) standards specify that the power level of the NICAM signal should be at -20 dB with respect to the power of the vision carrier.
* The level of the FM mono sound carrier must be at least -13 dB.
* Measuring the modulation level of the NICAM signal is difficult because the QPSK NICAM carrier waveform (unlike AM or FM modulated carrier waveforms) is not emitted at a discrete frequency.

When measured with spectrum analyser the actual level of the carrier
(L) can be calculated using the following formula:

L(NICAM) = L(Measured) + 10 log (R/BWAnalyser) + K

# L(NICAM) = actual level of the NICAM carrier [dBμV]
# L(Measured) = measured level of the NICAM carrier [dBμV]
# R = -3 dB bandwidth of the signal [kHz]
# BWAnalyser = bandwidth of the spectrum analyser [kHz]
# K = logarithmic form factor of the spectrum analyser ~2 dB

note: if BWAnalyser is greater than R, the formula becomes L(NICAM) = L(Measured) + K

==Differing features==
NICAM sampling is not standard PCM sampling, as commonly employed with the Compact Disc or at the codec level in MP3, AAC or Ogg audio devices. NICAM sampling more closely resembles Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation, or A-law companding with an extended, rapidly modifiable dynamic range.

===Two&#x27;s complement signing===
The two&#x27;s complement method of signing the samples is used, so that:
* 01111111111111 represents positive full-scale
* 10000000000000 represents negative full-scale

=== ±0 V has three binary representations ===
* 00000000000001 represents 0 V, with no +/- distinction. This may have originated as a method to reduce the emergence of DC patterns from transmission of silent material.
* 00000000000000 represents 0 V, with no +/- distinction
* 11111111111111 represents 0 V, with no +/- distinction

=== Parity checking limited to only 6 of 10 bits ===
In order to strengthen parity protection for the sound samples, the parity bit is calculated on only the top six bits of each NICAM sample. Early BBC NICAM research showed that uncorrected errors in the least significant four bits were preferable to the reduced overall protection offered by parity-protecting all ten bits.

==Recording==
===VCR===

VHS and Betamax home videocassette recorders (VCRs) initially only recorded the audio tracks by means of a fixed linear recording head, which was inadequate for recording NICAM audio; this significantly limited their sound quality. Many VCRs later included high quality stereo audio recording as an additional feature, in which the incoming high quality stereo audio source (typically FM radio or NICAM TV) was frequency modulated and then recorded, in addition to the usual audio and video VCR tracks, using the same high-bandwidth helical scanning technique used for the video signal. Full-size VCRs already made full use of the tape, so the high quality audio signal was recorded diagonally &quot;under&quot; the video signal, using additional helical scan heads and depth multiplexing. The mono audio track (and on some machines, a non-NICAM, non-Hi-Fi stereo track) was also recorded on the linear track, as before, to ensure backwards-compatibility of recordings made on Hi-Fi machines when played on non-Hi-Fi VCRs.

Such devices were often described as &quot;HiFi audio&quot;, &quot;Audio FM&quot; / &quot;AFM&quot; (FM standing for &quot;Frequency Modulation&quot;) and sometimes informally as &quot;Nicam&quot; VCRs (due to their use in recording the Nicam broadcast audio signal). They remained compatible with non-HiFi VCR players since the standard audio track was also recorded, and were at times used as an alternative to audio cassette tapes due to their superior frequency range and flat frequency response.

===DVD===
While recording in video mode (compatible with DVD-Video), most DVD recorders can only record one of the three channels (Digital I, Digital II, Analogue mono) allowed by the standard. Newer standard such as DVD-VR allows recording all the digital channels (in both stereo and bilingual mode), whereas the mono channel will be lost.

===Flash memory and computer multimedia===
Codecs for digital media on computers will often convert NICAM to another digital audio format to save drive space.

<text>The Battle of the Alamo (February 23 – March 6, 1836) was a pivotal event and military engagement in the Texas Revolution. Following a 13-day siege, Mexican troops under President General Antonio López de Santa Anna reclaimed the Alamo Mission near San Antonio de Béxar (modern-day San Antonio, Texas, United States). About one hundred Texians were then garrisoned at the mission, with around a hundred subsequent reinforcements led by eventual Alamo co-commanders James Bowie and William B. Travis. On February 23, approximately 1,500 Mexicans marched into San Antonio de Béxar as the first step in a campaign to retake Texas. In the early morning hours of March 6, the Mexican Army advanced on the Alamo. After repelling two attacks, the Texians were unable to fend off a third attack. As Mexican soldiers scaled the walls, most of the Texian fighters withdrew into interior buildings. Those who were unable to reach these points were slain by the Mexican cavalry as they attempted to escape. Between five and seven Texians may have surrendered; if so, they were quickly executed. Subsequently almost all of the Texian inhabitants were killed.

Several noncombatants were sent to Gonzales to spread word of the Texian defeat. The news sparked both a strong rush to join the Texian army and a panic, known as &quot;The Runaway Scrape&quot;, in which the Texian army, most settlers, and the government of the new, self-proclaimed but officially unrecognized Republic of Texas fled eastward toward the U.S. ahead of the advancing Mexican Army. Santa Anna&#x27;s execution of surrendering soldiers during the battle inspired many Texians and Tejanos to join the Texian Army. Motivated by a desire for revenge, as well as their written desire to preserve a border open to immigration and the importation and practice of slavery, the Texians defeated the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto, on April 21, 1836, ending the conquering of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas by the newly formed Republic of Texas.

Within Mexico, the battle has often been overshadowed by events from the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848. In 19th-century Texas, the Alamo complex gradually became known as a battle site rather than a former mission. The Texas Legislature purchased the land and buildings in the early part of the 20th century and designated the Alamo chapel as an official Texas State Shrine.

The Alamo has been the subject of numerous non-fiction works beginning in 1843. Most Americans, however, are more familiar with the myths and legends spread by many of the movie and television adaptations, including the 1950s Disney miniseries &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; and John Wayne&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;The Alamo&quot;.

==Background==
In 1835, there was a drastic shift in the Mexican nation. The triumph of conservative forces in the elections unleashed a series of events that culminated on October 23, 1835, under a new constitution, after the repeal of the federalist Constitution of 1824. &quot;Las Siete Leyes&quot; (), or Seven Laws, were a series of constitutional changes that fundamentally altered the organizational structure of Mexico, ending the first federal period and creating a unitary republic, officially the Mexican Republic (). Formalized under President Antonio López de Santa Anna on 15 December 1835, they were enacted in 1836. They were intended to centralize and strengthen the national government. The aim of the previous constitution was to create a political system that would emulate the success of the United States, but after a decade of political turmoil, economic stagnation, and threats and actual foreign invasion, conservatives concluded that a better path for Mexico was centralized power.

The new policies, the bans of slavery and immigration chief among them, and the increased enforcement of laws and import tariffs, incited many immigrants to revolt. The border region of Mexican Texas was largely populated by immigrants from the United States, some legal but most illegal. Some of these immigrants brought large numbers of slaves with them, so that by 1836, there were about 5,000 enslaved persons in a total non-native population estimated at 38,470. These people were accustomed to a federalist government which made special exemptions from Mexican law just for them, and to extensive individual rights including the right to own slaves, and they were quite vocal in their displeasure at Mexico&#x27;s law enforcement and shift towards centralism. The centralized government ended local federal exemptions to the ban on slavery, which had been negotiated by Stephen Austin and others. Already suspicious after previous United States attempts to purchase Mexican Texas, Mexican authorities blamed much of the Texian unrest on United States immigrants, most of whom had entered illegally and made little effort to adapt to the Mexican culture and who continued to hold people in slavery when slavery had been abolished in Mexico.

In October, Texians engaged Mexican troops in the first official battle of the Texas Revolution. Determined to quell the rebellion of immigrants, Santa Anna began assembling a large force, the Army of Operations in Texas, to restore order. Most of his soldiers were raw recruits, many conscripted.

The Texians systematically defeated the Mexican troops already stationed in Texas. The last group of Mexican soldiers in the region—commanded by Santa Anna&#x27;s brother-in-law, General Martín Perfecto de Cos—surrendered on December 9 following the siege of Béxar. By this point, the Texian Army was dominated by very recent arrivals to the region, primarily illegal immigrants from the United States. Many Texas settlers, unprepared for a long campaign, had returned home. Angered by what he perceived to be United States interference in Mexican affairs, Santa Anna a resolution classifying foreign immigrants found fighting in Texas as pirates. The resolution effectively banned the taking of prisoners of war: in this period of time, captured pirates were executed immediately. Santa Anna reiterated this message in a strongly worded letter to United States President Andrew Jackson. This letter was not widely distributed, and it is unlikely that most of the United States recruits serving in the Texian Army were aware that there would be no prisoners of war.

When Mexican troops departed San Antonio de Béxar (now San Antonio, Texas, USA) Texian soldiers captured the Mexican garrison at the Alamo Mission, a former Spanish religious outpost which had been converted to a makeshift fort by the recently expelled Mexican Army. Described by Santa Anna as an &quot;irregular fortification hardly worthy of the name&quot;, the Alamo had been designed to withstand an assault by Indigenous attackers, not an artillery-equipped army. The complex sprawled across , providing almost of perimeter to defend. An interior plaza was bordered on the east by the chapel and to the south by a one-story building known as the Low Barracks. A wooden palisade stretched between these two buildings. The two-story Long Barracks extended north from the chapel. At the northern corner of the east wall stood a cattle pen and horse corral. The walls surrounding the complex were at least thick and ranged from high.

To compensate for the lack of firing ports, Texian engineer Green B. Jameson constructed catwalks to allow defenders to fire over the walls; this method, however, left the rifleman&#x27;s upper body exposed. Mexican forces had left behind 19 cannons, which Jameson installed along the walls. A large 18-pounder had arrived in Texas with the New Orleans Greys. Jameson positioned this cannon in the southwest corner of the compound. He boasted to Texian Army commander Sam Houston that the Texians could &quot;whip 10 to 1 with our artillery&quot;.

==Prelude to battle==

The Texian garrison was woefully undermanned and underprovisioned, with fewer than 100 soldiers remaining by January 6, 1836. Colonel James C. Neill, the acting Alamo commander, wrote to the provisional government: &quot;If there has ever been a dollar here I have no knowledge of it&quot;. Neill requested additional troops and supplies, stressing that the garrison was likely to be unable to withstand a siege lasting longer than four days. The Texian government was in turmoil and unable to provide much assistance. Four different men claimed to have been given command over the entire army. On January 14, Neill approached one of them, Sam Houston, for assistance in gathering supplies, clothing, and ammunition.

Houston could not spare the number of men necessary to mount a successful defense. Instead, he sent Colonel James Bowie with 30 men to remove the artillery from the Alamo and destroy the complex. Bowie was unable to transport the artillery since the Alamo garrison lacked the necessary draft animals. Neill soon persuaded Bowie that the location held strategic importance. In a letter to Governor Henry Smith, Bowie argued that &quot;the salvation of Texas depends in great measure on keeping Béxar out of the hands of the enemy. It serves as the frontier picquet guard, and if it were in the possession of Santa Anna, there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march towards the Sabine.&quot; The letter to Smith ended, &quot;Colonel Neill and myself have come to the solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy.&quot; Bowie also wrote to the provisional government, asking for &quot;men, money, rifles, and cannon powder&quot;. Few reinforcements were authorized; cavalry officer William B. Travis arrived in Béxar with 30 men on February 3. Five days later, a small group of volunteers arrived, including the famous frontiersman and former U.S. Congressman David Crockett of Tennessee.

On February 11, Neill left the Alamo, determined to recruit additional reinforcements and gather supplies. He transferred command to Travis, the highest-ranking regular army officer in the garrison. Volunteers comprised much of the garrison, and they were unwilling to accept Travis as their leader. The men instead elected Bowie, who had a reputation as a fierce fighter, as their commander. Bowie celebrated by getting very intoxicated and creating havoc in Béxar. To mitigate the resulting ill feelings, Bowie agreed to share command with Travis.

As the Texians struggled to find men and supplies, Santa Anna continued to gather men at San Luis Potosí; by the end of 1835, his army numbered 6,019 soldiers. Rather than advance along the coast, where supplies and reinforcements could be easily delivered by sea, Santa Anna ordered his army inland to Béxar, the political center of Texas and the site of Cos&#x27;s defeat. The army began its march north in late December. Officers used the long journey to train the men. Many of the new recruits did not know how to aim their muskets, and many refused to fire from the shoulder because of the strong recoil.

Progress was slow. There were not enough mules to transport all of the supplies, and many of the teamsters, all civilians, quit when their pay was delayed. The many &quot;soldaderas&quot; – women and children who followed the army – consumed much of the already scarce supplies. The soldiers were soon reduced to partial rations. On February 12 they crossed the Rio Grande. Temperatures in Texas reached record lows, and by February 13 an estimated of snow had fallen. Hypothermia, dysentery, and Comanche raiding parties took a heavy toll on the Mexican soldiers.

On February 21, Santa Anna and his vanguard reached the banks of the Medina River, from Béxar. Unaware of the Mexican Army&#x27;s proximity, the majority of the Alamo garrison joined Béxar residents at a . After learning of the planned celebration, Santa Anna ordered General Joaquín Ramírez y Sesma to immediately seize the unprotected Alamo, but sudden rains halted that raid.

==Siege==
===Investment===
In the early hours of February 23, residents began fleeing Béxar, fearing the Mexican army&#x27;s imminent arrival. Although unconvinced by the reports, Travis stationed a soldier in the San Fernando church bell tower, the highest location in town, to watch for signs of an approaching force. Several hours later, Texian scouts reported seeing Mexican troops outside the town. Few arrangements had been made for a potential siege. One group of Texians scrambled to herd cattle into the Alamo, while others scrounged for food in the recently abandoned houses. Several members of the garrison who had been living in town brought their families with them when they reported to the Alamo. Among these were Almaron Dickinson, who brought his wife Susanna and their infant daughter Angelina; Bowie, who was accompanied by his deceased wife&#x27;s cousins, Gertrudis Navarro and Juana Navarro Alsbury, and Alsbury&#x27;s young son; and Gregorio Esparza, whose family climbed through the window of the Alamo chapel after the Mexican army arrived. Other members of the garrison failed to report for duty; most of the men working outside Béxar did not try to sneak past Mexican lines.

By late afternoon Béxar was occupied by about 1,500 Mexican soldiers. When the Mexican troops raised a blood-red flag signifying no quarter, Travis responded with a blast from the Alamo&#x27;s largest cannon. Believing that Travis had acted hastily, Bowie sent Jameson to meet with Santa Anna. Travis was angered that Bowie had acted unilaterally and sent his own representative, Captain Albert Martin. Both emissaries met with Colonel Juan Almonte and José Bartres. According to Almonte, the Texians asked for an honorable surrender but were informed that any surrender must be unconditional. On learning this, Bowie and Travis mutually agreed to fire the cannon again.

===Skirmishes===
The first night of the siege was relatively quiet. Over the next few days, Mexican soldiers established artillery batteries, initially about from the south and east walls of the Alamo. A third battery was positioned southeast of the fort. Each night the batteries inched closer to the Alamo walls. During the first week of the siege more than 200 cannonballs landed in the Alamo plaza. At first, the Texians matched Mexican artillery fire, often reusing the Mexican cannonballs. On February 26 Travis ordered the artillery to conserve powder and shot.

Two notable events occurred on Wednesday, February 24. At some point that day, Bowie collapsed from illness, leaving Travis in sole command of the garrison. Late that afternoon, two Mexican scouts became the first fatalities of the siege. The following morning, 200–300 Mexican soldiers crossed the San Antonio River and took cover in abandoned shacks near the Alamo walls. Several Texians ventured out to burn the huts while Texians within the Alamo provided cover fire. After a two-hour skirmish, the Mexican troops retreated to Béxar. Six Mexican soldiers were killed and four others were wounded. No Texians were injured.

A blue norther blew in on February 25, dropping the temperature to . Neither army was prepared for the cold temperatures. Texian attempts to gather firewood were thwarted by Mexican troops. On the evening of February 26 Colonel Juan Bringas engaged several Texians who were burning more huts. According to historian J.R. Edmondson, one Texian was killed. Four days later, Texians shot and killed Private First-Class Secundino Alvarez, a soldier from one of two battalions that Santa Anna had stationed on two sides of the Alamo. By March 1, the number of Mexican casualties was nine dead and four wounded, while the Texian garrison had lost only one man.

===Reinforcements===
Santa Anna posted one company east of the Alamo, on the road to Gonzales. Almonte and 800 dragoons were stationed along the road to Goliad. Throughout the siege these towns had received multiple couriers, dispatched by Travis to plead for reinforcements and supplies. The most famous of his missives, written February 24, was addressed To the People of Texas &amp; All Americans in the World. According to historian Mary Deborah Petite, the letter is &quot;considered by many as one of the masterpieces of American patriotism.&quot; Copies of the letter were distributed across Texas, and eventually reprinted throughout the United States and much of Europe. At the end of the first day of the siege, Santa Anna&#x27;s troops were reinforced by 600 men under General Joaquin Ramirez y Sesma, bringing the Mexican army up to more than 2,000 men.

As news of the siege spread throughout Texas, potential reinforcements gathered in Gonzales. They hoped to rendezvous with Colonel James Fannin, who was expected to arrive from Goliad with his garrison. On February 26, after days of indecision, Fannin ordered 320 men, four cannons, and several supply wagons to march towards the Alamo, away. This group traveled less than before turning back. Fannin blamed the retreat on his officers; the officers and enlisted men accused Fannin of aborting the mission.

Texians gathered in Gonzales were unaware of Fannin&#x27;s return to Goliad, and most continued to wait. Impatient with the delay, on February 27 Travis ordered Samuel G. Bastian to go to Gonzales &quot;to hurry up reinforcements&quot;. According to historian Thomas Ricks Lindley, Bastian encountered the Gonzales Ranging Company led by Lieutenant George C. Kimble and Travis&#x27; courier to Gonzales, Albert Martin, who had tired of waiting for Fannin. A Mexican patrol attacked, driving off four of the men including Bastian. In the darkness, the Texians fired on the remaining 32 men, whom they assumed were Mexican soldiers. One man was wounded, and his English curses convinced the occupiers to open the gates.

On March 3, the Texians watched from the walls as approximately 1,000 Mexicans marched into Béxar. The Mexican army celebrated loudly throughout the afternoon, both in honor of their reinforcements and at the news that troops under General José de Urrea had soundly defeated Texian Colonel Frank W. Johnson at the Battle of San Patricio on February 27. Most of the Texians in the Alamo believed that Sesma had been leading the Mexican forces during the siege, and they mistakenly attributed the celebration to the arrival of Santa Anna. The reinforcements brought the number of Mexican soldiers in Béxar to almost 3,100.

The arrival of the Mexican reinforcements prompted Travis to send three men, including Davy Crockett, to find Fannin&#x27;s force, which he still believed to be en route. The scouts discovered a large group of Texians camped from the Alamo. Lindley&#x27;s research indicates that up to 50 of these men had come from Goliad after Fannin&#x27;s aborted rescue mission. The others had left Gonzales several days earlier. Just before daylight on March 4, part of the Texian force broke through Mexican lines and entered the Alamo. Mexican soldiers drove a second group across the prairie.

===Assault preparations===
On March 4, the day after his reinforcements arrived, Santa Anna proposed an assault on the Alamo. Many of his senior officers recommended that they wait for two 12-pounder cannons anticipated to arrive on March 7. That evening, a local woman, likely Bowie&#x27;s cousin-in-law Juana Navarro Alsbury, approached Santa Anna to negotiate a surrender for the Alamo occupiers. According to many historians, this visit probably increased Santa Anna&#x27;s impatience; as historian Timothy Todish noted, &quot;there would have been little glory in a bloodless victory&quot;. The following morning, Santa Anna announced to his staff that the assault would take place early on March 6. Santa Anna arranged for troops from Béxar to be excused from the front lines so that they would not be forced to fight their own families.

Legend holds that at some point on March 5, Travis gathered his men and explained that an attack was imminent, and that they were greatly outnumbered by the Mexican Army. He supposedly drew a line in the ground and asked those willing to die for the Texian cause to cross and stand alongside him; only one man (Moses Rose) was said to have declined. Most scholars disregard this tale as there is no primary source evidence to support it (the story only surfaced decades after the battle in a third-hand account). Travis apparently did, at some point prior to the final assault, assemble the men for a conference to inform them of the dire situation and giving them the chance to either escape or stay and die for the cause. Susanna Dickinson recalled Travis announcing that any men who wished to escape should let it be known and step out of ranks.

The last Texian verified to have left the Alamo was James Allen, a courier who carried personal messages from Travis and several of the other men on March 5.

==Final assault==

===Exterior fighting===

At 10 p.m. on March 5, the Mexican artillery ceased their bombardment. As Santa Anna had anticipated, the exhausted Texians soon fell into the first uninterrupted sleep many of them had since the siege began. Just after midnight, more than 2,000 Mexican soldiers began preparing for the final assault. Fewer than 1,800 were divided into four columns, commanded by Cos, Colonel Francisco Duque, Colonel José María Romero and Colonel Juan Morales. Veterans were positioned on the outside of the columns to better control the new recruits and conscripts in the middle. As a precaution, 500 Mexican cavalry were positioned around the Alamo to prevent the escape of either Texian or Mexican soldiers. Santa Anna remained in camp with the 400 reserves. Despite the bitter cold, the soldiers were ordered not to wear overcoats which could impede their movements. Clouds concealed the moon and thus the movements of the soldiers.

At 5:30 a.m. troops silently advanced. Cos and his men approached the northwest corner of the Alamo, while Duque led his men from the northwest towards a repaired breach in the Alamo&#x27;s north wall. The column commanded by Romero marched towards the east wall, and Morales&#x27;s column aimed for the low parapet by the chapel.

The three Texian sentinels stationed outside the walls were killed in their sleep, allowing Mexican soldiers to approach undetected within musket range of the walls. At this point, the silence was broken by shouts of &quot;¡Viva Santa Anna!&quot; and music from the buglers. The noise woke the Texians. Most of the noncombatants gathered in the church sacristy for safety. Travis rushed to his post yelling, &quot;Come on boys, the Mexicans are upon us and we&#x27;ll give them hell!&quot; and, as he passed a group of Tejanos, &quot;¡No rendirse, muchachos!&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t surrender, boys&quot;).

In the initial moments of the assault, Mexican troops were at a disadvantage. Their column formation allowed only the front rows of soldiers to fire safely. Unaware of the dangers, the untrained recruits in the ranks &quot;blindly fir[ed] their guns&quot;, injuring or killing the troops in front of them. The tight concentration of troops also offered an excellent target for the Texian artillery. Lacking canister shot, Texians filled their cannon with any metal they could find, including door hinges, nails, and chopped-up horseshoes, essentially turning the cannon into giant shotguns. According to the diary of José Enrique de la Peña, &quot;a single cannon volley did away with half the company of chasseurs from Toluca&quot;. Duque fell from his horse after sustaining a wound in his thigh and was almost trampled by his own men. General Manuel Castrillón quickly assumed command of Duque&#x27;s column.

Although some in the front of the Mexican ranks wavered, soldiers in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first occupiers to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.

Mexican soldiers withdrew and regrouped, but their second attack was repulsed. Fifteen minutes into the battle, they attacked a third time. During the third strike, Romero&#x27;s column, aiming for the east wall, was exposed to cannon fire and shifted to the north, mingling with the second column. Cos&#x27; column, under fire from Texians on the west wall, also veered north. When Santa Anna saw that the bulk of his army was massed against the north wall, he feared a rout; &quot;panicked&quot;, he sent the reserves into the same area. The Mexican soldiers closest to the north wall realized that the makeshift wall contained many gaps and toeholds. One of the first to scale the 12-foot (3.7 m) wall was General Juan Amador; at his challenge, his men began swarming up the wall. Amador opened the postern in the north wall, allowing Mexican soldiers to pour into the complex. Others climbed through gun ports in the west wall, which had few occupiers. As the Texian occupiers abandoned the north wall and the northern end of the west wall, Texian gunners at the south end of the mission turned their cannon towards the north and fired into the advancing Mexican soldiers. This left the south end of the mission unprotected; within minutes Mexican soldiers had climbed the walls and killed the gunners, gaining control of the Alamo&#x27;s 18-pounder cannon. By this time Romero&#x27;s men had taken the east wall of the compound and were pouring in through the cattle pen.

===Interior fighting===
As previously planned, most of the Texians fell back to the barracks and the chapel. Mrs.Dann was the favorite in the Alamo. Holes had been carved in the walls to allow the Texians to fire. Unable to reach the barracks, Texians stationed along the west wall headed west for the San Antonio River. When the cavalry charged, the Texians took cover and began firing from a ditch. Sesma was forced to send reinforcements, and the Texians were eventually killed. Sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50 Texians, but Edmondson believes that number was inflated.

The occupiers in the cattle pen retreated into the horse corral. After discharging their weapons, the small band of Texians scrambled over the low wall, circled behind the church and raced on foot for the east prairie, which appeared empty. As the Mexican cavalry advanced on the group, Almaron Dickinson and his artillery crew turned a cannon around and fired into the cavalry, probably inflicting casualties. Nevertheless, all of the escaping Texians were killed.

The last Texian group to remain in the open were Crockett and his men, defending the low wall in front of the church. Unable to reload, they used their rifles as clubs and fought with knives. After a volley of fire and a wave of Mexican bayonets, the few remaining Texians in this group fell back towards the church. The Mexican army now controlled all of the outer walls and the interior of the Alamo compound except for the church and rooms along the east and west walls. Mexican soldiers turned their attention to a Texian flag waving from the roof of one building. Four Mexicans were killed before the flag of Mexico was raised in that location.

For the next hour, the Mexican army worked to secure complete control of the Alamo. Many of the remaining occupiers were ensconced in the fortified barracks rooms. In the confusion, the Texians had neglected to their cannon before retreating. Mexican soldiers turned the cannon towards the barracks. As each door was blown off, Mexican soldiers would fire a volley of muskets into the dark room, then charge in for hand-to-hand combat.

Too sick to participate in the battle, Bowie likely died in bed. Eyewitnesses to the battle gave conflicting accounts of his death. Some witnesses maintained that they saw several Mexican soldiers enter Bowie&#x27;s room, bayonet him, and carry him alive from the room. Others claimed that Bowie shot himself or was killed by soldiers while too weak to lift his head. According to historian Wallace Chariton, the &quot;most popular, and probably the most accurate&quot; version is that Bowie died on his cot, &quot;back braced against the wall, and using his pistols and his famous knife.&quot;

The last of the Texians to die were the 11 men manning the two 12-pounder cannons in the chapel. A shot from the 18-pounder cannon destroyed the barricades at the front of the church, and Mexican soldiers entered the building after firing an initial musket volley. Dickinson&#x27;s crew fired their cannon from the apse into the Mexican soldiers at the door. With no time to reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza and James Bonham, grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans, the master of ordnance, had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder. Had he succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the church and killed the women and children hiding in the sacristy.

As soldiers approached the sacristy, one of the young sons of occupier Anthony Wolf stood to pull a blanket over his shoulders. In the dark, Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed him. Possibly the last Texian to die in battle was Jacob Walker, who, wounded, ran to a corner and was bayoneted in front of Susanna Dickinson. Another Texian, Brigido Guerrero, also sought refuge in the sacristy. Guerrero, who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835, was spared after convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner.

By 6:30 a.m. the battle for the Alamo was over. Mexican soldiers inspected each corpse, bayoneting any body that moved. Even with all of the Texians dead, Mexican soldiers continued to shoot, some killing each other in the confusion. Mexican generals were unable to stop the bloodlust and appealed to Santa Anna for help. Although the general showed himself, the violence continued and the buglers were finally ordered to sound a retreat. For 15 minutes after that, soldiers continued to fire into dead bodies.

==Aftermath==

===Casualties===
According to many accounts of the battle, between five and seven Texians surrendered. Incensed that his orders had been ignored, Santa Anna demanded the immediate execution of the survivors. Weeks after the battle, stories circulated that Crockett was among those who surrendered. Ben, a former United States slave who cooked for one of Santa Anna&#x27;s officers, maintained that Crockett&#x27;s body was found surrounded by &quot;no less than sixteen Mexican corpses&quot;. Historians disagree on which version of Crockett&#x27;s death is accurate.Santa Anna reportedly told Captain Fernando Urizza that the battle &quot;was but a small affair&quot;. Another officer then remarked that &quot;with another such victory as this, we&#x27;ll go to the devil&quot;. In his initial report Santa Anna claimed that 600 Texians had been killed, with only 70 Mexican soldiers killed and 300 wounded. His secretary, Ramón Martínez Caro, reported 400 killed. Other estimates of the number of Mexican soldiers killed ranged from 60 to 200, with an additional 250–300 wounded. Some people, historians, and survivors such as Susanna Dickinson have estimated that over 1,000-1,600 Mexican soldiers were killed and wounded, but it is most likely that total casualties were less than 600. Texian Dr. J. H. Barnard who tended the Mexican soldiers reported 300-400 dead and 200-300 wounded. Most Alamo historians place the number of Mexican casualties at 400–600. This would represent about one quarter of the over 2,000 Mexican soldiers involved in the final assault, which Todish remarks is &quot;a tremendous casualty rate by any standards&quot;. Most eyewitnesses counted between 182 and 257 Texians killed. Some historians believe that at least one Texian, Henry Warnell, successfully escaped from the battle. Warnell died several months later of wounds incurred either during the final battle or during his escape as a courier.Mexican soldiers were buried in the local cemetery, Campo Santo. Shortly after the battle, Colonel José Juan Sanchez Navarro proposed that a monument should be erected to the fallen Mexican soldiers. Cos rejected the idea.

The Texian bodies were stacked and burned. The only exception was the body of Gregorio Esparza. His brother Francisco, an officer in Santa Anna&#x27;s army, received permission to give Gregorio a proper burial. The ashes were left where they fell until February 1837, when Juan Seguín returned to Béxar to examine the remains. A simple coffin inscribed with the names Travis, Crockett, and Bowie was filled with ashes from the funeral pyres. According to a March 28, 1837, article in the &quot;Telegraph and Texas Register&quot;, Seguín buried the coffin under a peach tree grove. The spot was not marked and cannot now be identified. Seguín later claimed that he had placed the coffin in front of the altar at the San Fernando Cathedral. In July 1936 a coffin was discovered buried in that location, but according to historian Wallace Chariton, it is unlikely to actually contain the remains of the Alamo defenders. Fragments of uniforms were found in the coffin and the Texian soldiers who fought at the Alamo were known not to wear uniforms.

===Texian survivors===
In an attempt to convince other slaves in Texas to support the Mexican government over the Texian rebellion, Santa Anna spared Travis&#x27; slave, Joe. The day after the battle, he interviewed each noncombatant individually. Impressed with Susanna Dickinson, Santa Anna offered to adopt her infant daughter Angelina and have the child educated in Mexico City. Dickinson refused the offer, which was not extended to Juana Navarro Alsbury although her son was of similar age. Each woman was given a blanket and two silver pesos. Alsbury and the other &quot;Tejano&quot; women were allowed to return to their homes in Béxar; Dickinson, her daughter and Joe were sent to Gonzales, escorted by Ben. They were encouraged to relate the events of the battle, and to inform the remainder of the Texian forces that Santa Anna&#x27;s army was unbeatable.

===Impact on revolution===
During the siege, newly elected delegates from across Texas met at the Convention of 1836. On March 2, the delegates declared independence, forming the Republic of Texas. Four days later, the delegates at the convention received a dispatch Travis had written March 3 warning of his dire situation. Unaware that the Alamo had fallen, Robert Potter called for the convention to adjourn and march immediately to relieve the Alamo. Sam Houston convinced the delegates to remain in Washington-on-the-Brazos to develop a constitution. After being appointed sole commander of all Texian troops, Houston journeyed to Gonzales to take command of the 400 volunteers who were still waiting for Fannin to lead them to the Alamo.

Within hours of Houston&#x27;s arrival on March 11, Andres Barcenas and Anselmo Bergaras arrived with news that the Alamo had fallen and all Texians were slain. Hoping to halt a panic, Houston arrested the men as enemy spies. They were released hours later when Susanna Dickinson and Joe reached Gonzales and confirmed the report. Realizing that the Mexican army would soon advance towards the Texian settlements, Houston advised all civilians in the area to evacuate and ordered his new army to retreat. This sparked a mass exodus, known as the Runaway Scrape, and most Texians, including members of the new government, fled east.

Despite their losses at the Alamo, the Mexican army in Texas still outnumbered the Texian army by almost six to one. Santa Anna assumed that knowledge of the disparity in troop numbers and the fate of the Texian soldiers at the Alamo would quell the resistance, and that Texian soldiers would quickly leave the territory. News of the Alamo&#x27;s fall had the opposite effect, and men flocked to join Houston&#x27;s army. The &quot;New York Post&quot; editorialized that &quot;had [Santa Anna] treated the vanquished with moderation and generosity, it would have been difficult if not impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their brethren&quot;.

On the afternoon of April 21 the Texian army attacked Santa Anna&#x27;s camp near Lynchburg Ferry. The Mexican army was taken by surprise, and the Battle of San Jacinto was essentially over after 18 minutes. During the fighting, many of the Texian soldiers repeatedly cried &quot;Remember the Alamo!&quot; as they slaughtered fleeing Mexican troops. Santa Anna was captured the following day, and reportedly told Houston: &quot;That man may consider himself born to no common destiny who has conquered the Napoleon of the West. And now it remains for him to be generous to the vanquished.&quot; Houston replied, &quot;You should have remembered that at the Alamo&quot;. Santa Anna&#x27;s life was spared, and he was forced to order his troops out of Texas, ending Mexican control of the province and bestowing some legitimacy on the new republic.

==Legacy==

Following the battle, Santa Anna was alternately viewed as a national hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe that some of the stories, such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848.

In San Antonio de Béxar, the largely &quot;Tejano&quot; population viewed the Alamo complex as more than just a battle site; it represented decades of assistance—as a mission, a hospital, or a military post. As the English-speaking population increased, the complex became best known for the battle. Focus has centered primarily on the Texian occupiers, with little emphasis given to the role of the &quot;Tejano&quot; soldiers who served in the Texian army or the actions of the Mexican army. In the early 20th century the Texas Legislature purchased the property and appointed the Daughters of the Republic of Texas as permanent caretakers of what is now an official state shrine. In front of the church, in the center of Alamo Plaza, stands a cenotaph, designed by Pompeo Coppini, which commemorates the Texians and &quot;Tejanos&quot; who died during the battle. According to Bill Groneman&#x27;s &quot;Battlefields of Texas&quot;, the Alamo has become &quot;the most popular tourist site in Texas&quot;.

The first English-language histories of the battle were written and published by Texas Ranger and amateur historian John Henry Brown. The next major treatment of the battle was Reuben Potter&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of the Alamo&quot;, published in &quot;The Magazine of American History&quot; in 1878. Potter based his work on interviews with many of the Mexican survivors of the battle. The first full-length, non-fiction book covering the battle, John Myers Myers&#x27; &quot;The Alamo&quot;, was published in 1948. In the decades since, the battle has featured prominently in many non-fiction works.

According to Todish &quot;et al.&quot;, &quot;there can be little doubt that most Americans have probably formed many of their opinions on what occurred at the Alamo not from books, but from the various movies made about the battle.&quot; The first film version of the battle appeared in 1911, when Gaston Méliès directed &quot;The Immortal Alamo&quot;. The battle became more widely known after it was featured in the 1950s Disney miniseries &quot;Davy Crockett&quot;, which was largely based on myth. Within several years, John Wayne directed and starred in one of the best-known, but questionably accurate, film versions, 1960&#x27;s &quot;The Alamo&quot;. Another film also called &quot;The Alamo&quot; was released in 2004. CNN described it as possibly &quot;the most character-driven of all the movies made on the subject&quot;. It is also considered more faithful to the actual events than other movies.

Several songwriters have been inspired by the Battle of the Alamo. Tennessee Ernie Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of Davy Crockett&quot; spent 16 weeks on the country music charts, peaking at No. 4 in 1955. Marty Robbins recorded a version of the song &quot;The Ballad of the Alamo&quot; in 1960 which spent 13 weeks on the pop charts, peaking at No. 34. Jane Bowers&#x27; song &quot;Remember the Alamo&quot; has been recorded by artists including Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, and Donovan. British hard rock band Babe Ruth&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;The Mexican&quot; pictures the conflict through the eyes of a Mexican soldier. Singer-songwriter Phil Collins collected hundreds of items related to the battle, narrated a light and sound show about the Alamo, and has spoken at related events. In 2014 Collins donated his entire collection to the Alamo via the State of Texas.

The U.S. Postal Service issued two postage stamps in commemoration of Texas Statehood and the Battle of Alamo. The &quot;Remember the Alamo&quot; battle cry, as well as the Alamo Mission itself appear on the current version of the reverse side of the seal of Texas.

The battle also featured in episode 13 of &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;, &quot;The Alamo&quot;, first aired in 1966, and episode 5 of season one of the TV series Timeless, aired 2016.

As of 2023, the Alamo Trust (which operates the site) seeks to expand the property to build an Alamo museum. To do so, it would have to use eminent domain to seize a property containing an Alamo-themed bar called Moses Rose&#x27;s Hideout (named after an Alamo deserter) that has operated for 12 years (circ. 2023). The Alamo Trust claims that if the bar owner continues to refuse to sell his property, it will put the $400 million property at stake. Conversely, the bar owner says that he wishes to participate in the economic success of adding an Alamo museum and that there is a certain unjust irony of seizing his property to expand the Alamo.

<text>Géza Maróczy (; 3 March 1870 – 29 May 1951) was a Hungarian chess player, one of the leading players in the world in his time. He was one of the inaugural recipients of the International Grandmaster title from FIDE in 1950.

==Early career==
Géza Maróczy was born in Szeged, Hungary on 3 March 1870. He won the &quot;minor&quot; tournament at Hastings 1895, and over the next ten years he won several first prizes in international events. Between 1902 and 1908, he took part in thirteen tournaments and won five first prizes and five second prizes. Today the Maróczy Bind (see below) and the Maróczy Gambit bear his name. 

In 1906 he agreed to terms for a World Championship match with Emanuel Lasker, but the arrangements could not be finalised, and the match never took place.

==Retirement and return==
After 1908, Maróczy retired from international chess to devote more time to his profession as a clerk. He worked as an auditor and made a good career at the Center of Trade Unions and Social Insurance. When the Communists came briefly to power in 1919 after World War I (Hungarian Soviet Republic) he was a chief auditor at the Education Ministry. After the Communist government was overthrown he couldn&#x27;t get another job. He made a brief return to chess, with some success. At the turn of the year 1927/8, he outclassed the 1924 champion of Hungary, Géza Nagy, in a match by +5−0=3. With him on Board 1, Hungary won the first Chess Olympiads in London (1927). He continued competing in tournaments throughout the 1930s.

In 1950, FIDE instituted the title of Grandmaster; Maróczy was one of several players who were awarded the title based on their past achievements.

==Style==

Maróczy&#x27;s style, though sound, was very defensive in nature. His successful defences of the Danish Gambit against Jacques Mieses and Karl Helling, involving judicious return of the sacrificed for advantage, were used as models of defensive play by Max Euwe and Kramer in their two-volume series on the middlegame. Aron Nimzowitsch, in &quot;My System&quot;, used Maróczy&#x27;s win against Hugo Süchting (in Barmen 1905) as a model of restraining the opponent before breaking through. But he could also play spectacular chess on occasion, such as his famous victory over the noted attacking player David Janowski (Munich 1900).

His handling of queen endgames was also highly respected, such as against Frank Marshall, from Karlsbad 1907, showing superior queen activity.

The Maróczy Bind is a formation White may adopt against some variations of the Sicilian Defence. By placing pawns on e4 and c4, White slightly reduces his attacking prospects but also greatly inhibits Black&#x27;s .

==Assessment==
Maróczy had respectable lifetime scores against most of the top players of his day, but he had negative scores against the world chess champions: Wilhelm Steinitz (+1−2=1), Emanuel Lasker (+0−4=2), José Raúl Capablanca (+0−3=5) and Alexander Alekhine (+0−6=5); except for Max Euwe, whom he beat (+4−3=15). But Maróczy&#x27;s defensive style was often more than sufficient to beat the leading attacking players of his day such as Joseph Henry Blackburne (+5−0=3), Mikhail Chigorin (+6−4=7), Frank Marshall (+11−6=8), David Janowski (+10−5=5), Efim Bogoljubov (+7−4=4) and Frederick Yates (+8−0=1).

Capablanca held Maróczy in high esteem. In a lecture given in the early 1940s, Capablanca called Maróczy &quot;very gentlemanly and correct&quot; and &quot;a kindly figure&quot;, praised the Maróczy Bind as an important contribution to opening theory, credited him as a &quot;good teacher&quot; who greatly helped Vera Menchik reach the top of women&#x27;s chess, and &quot;one of the greatest masters of his time.&quot; Capablanca wrote (as cited by Edward Winter&#x27;s compendium on Capablanca):As a chessplayer he was a little lacking in imagination and aggressive spirit. His positional judgement, the greatest quality of the true master, was excellent. A very accurate player and an excellent endgame artist, he became famous as an expert on queen endings. In a tournament many years ago he won a knight endgame against the Viennese master Marco which has gone into history as one of the classic endings of this type. [Capablanca was referring to Marco–Maroczy, 1899.] Concerning the relative strength of Maróczy and the best young masters of today, my opinion is that, with the exception of Botvinnik and Keres, Maróczy in his time was superior to all the other players of today.

<text>Henrique Costa Mecking (born 23 January 1952), also known as Mequinho, is a Brazilian chess grandmaster who reached his zenith in the 1970s and is still one of the strongest players in Brazil. He was a chess prodigy, drawing comparisons to Bobby Fischer, although he did not achieve the International Grandmaster title until 1972. He won the Interzonals of Petropolis 1973 and Manila 1976. His highest FIDE rating is 2635, achieved in 1977, when he was ranked number four in the world. He became the third-best player in the world in 1977, behind only World Champion Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi.

He is the first Brazilian to become a grandmaster. Despite winning his first national championship at the age of 13, he played in very few tournaments. He won at Vršac in 1971 and finished third with Robert Byrne (after the co-winners Karpov and Korchnoi) at Hastings in 1971–72. In 1975, he twice shared second place behind Ljubomir Ljubojević, firstly at Las Palmas with Ulf Andersson and Mikhail Tal, and then at Manila with Lev Polugaevsky, Bent Larsen and Helmut Pfleger.

He was considered a contender for the World Championship in the mid-1970s; however, his chess career was interrupted by a serious illness (myasthenia gravis).

Mecking played for Brazil in the Chess Olympiads of 1968, 1974, 2002 and 2004.

== World Championship candidate ==
Mecking was a regular participant in Candidates Tournaments, the FIDE events used to choose a challenger for the World Chess Championship. After unsuccessful attempts to qualify from the Interzonals of Sousse 1967 and Palma de Mallorca 1970, he had his first major triumph in 1973, when he won the Petrópolis Interzonal (ahead of a very strong field that included Paul Keres and David Bronstein). He was subsequently eliminated from the Candidates Tournament in the quarterfinals, after losing his match against Korchnoi. Still, from this time (in the aftermath of Bobby Fischer&#x27;s effective retirement in 1972) until 1979, Mecking was the strongest player born in the West.

At his next attempt in 1976, he won the Manila Interzonal (ahead of Vlastimil Hort, Lev Polugaevsky, Vitaly Tseshkovsky, Ljubomir Ljubojević, Zoltán Ribli et al.), thereby reaching a second successive Candidates matches stage, but again lost in the quarterfinals, this time to Polugaevsky. Illness (myasthenia gravis) forced Mecking&#x27;s withdrawal from the Interzonal at Rio de Janeiro in 1979 after a first round draw with Borislav Ivkov. His illness was so severe that it was widely believed he would soon die. He survived but did not play chess during the 1980s. While he was able to recover and to resume his chess career in 1991 with matches against Predrag Nikolić and (in 1992) Yasser Seirawan, followed by intermittent tournament appearances, his chance at the world title had passed and he has not been able to get even close to reaching the Candidates matches again.

== Personal life ==
Mecking is a convert to Catholicism, to which he credits the improvement of his medical condition. He is a member of the Catholic charismatic renewal.

<text>Rainforest Cafe is a jungle-themed restaurant chain owned by Landry&#x27;s, Inc., of Houston. The first location opened in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, on February 3, 1994. By 1997, the chain consisted of six restaurants, all in the United States. The first international location opened in London, England in June 1997. In 1998, it was planned to build 12 additional restaurants in the United States, seven in Mexico, and five in the United Kingdom, for a total of 22 restaurants by 2008.

In 2000, the Rainforest Cafe was bought by Landry&#x27;s Restaurants Inc., a company specializing in dining, hospitality, entertainment, and gaming, based in Houston, Texas. To date, the company owns restaurants in the United States, Canada, France, the United Arab Emirates, Japan, and Malta. Rainforest Cafe focuses on local tourism for a majority of their income.

==Design==

Each Rainforest Cafe restaurant is designed to depict the atmosphere of a tropical rainforest, including fake plants, fog machines, waterfalls, and rainforest animals. The ceiling and much of the walls are lined with artificial foliage, while lower areas and booth seating are decorated with faux rock. Brick textures suggest ancient ruins, and support pillars are made to look like tree trunks. Often, there is a waterfall with a fountain in the dining area, with a statue depicting Atlas holding up the Earth to communicate a conservation message.
Papier-mâché birds and butterflies are suspended from the trees, and other whimsical rainforest creatures are mounted, as though climbing on the walls or peeking through the foliage. The ceiling above the center of the dining room features a simulated starry night sky, designed and manufactured by Fiber Optic Systems Inc., located in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey. The bar area is situated under a gigantic mushroom, partitioned from the rest of the restaurant by a rain curtain. The chain is known for its characteristic bar stools, made to resemble the legs of animals, designed and sculpted by the artist Glenn Carter. Fish tanks with tropical reef fish are spread throughout the restaurant and the gift shop space. Periodically, a simulated thunderstorm will occur every few minutes, with strobe lights and thunder effects through subwoofers.

Animatronic animals are spread throughout the restaurant. These include butterflies, elephants, gorillas, leopards, orangutans, chimpanzees, macaws, monkeys and tigers, though this will vary by location. The restaurant is laid out so that these animals are set off the ground and are largely above diners&#x27; heads, not only allowing them to be seen from farther away, but making them appear larger as well. A crocodile (a hippo in Nashville) and a python are often located in the gift shop area to attract the attention of passersby. Tracy Tree, an animated tree face, sits inside the shop and provides rainforest facts. The animals are manufactured by Russells Creative, LLC, of Apopka, Florida, formerly UCFab International.

A retail village is located in front of the dining area with an assortment of souvenirs that are rainforest-themed or are branded with the Rainforest Cafe logo, mostly printed by the Atlanta-based fashion apparel company Boxercraft Inc. A small water feature with an animatronic crocodile (a hippo in Nashville) is located just outside the shop, in which visitors are invited to toss coins.

Rainforest Cafe also has a set of eight animal mascots, called &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. These characters include Cha! Cha!, the red-eyed tree frog; Maya, the jaguar; Rio, the macaw; Tuki, the elephant; Ozzie, the orangutan; Bamba, the gorilla; Iggy, the iguana; and Nile, the crocodile. These eight characters may be represented on children&#x27;s menus, merchandise, or the company logo.

==Menu==
Rainforest Cafe serves typical American chain restaurant fare, such as burgers, chicken, pastas, and seafood, with the addition of some Mexican food to reflect the tropical theme. Their signature dessert, called a volcano cake, consists of chocolate brownie and vanilla ice cream topped with a tinsel stick that mimics the former sparkler effect.

The restaurant also serves alcoholic beverages, some of which are reminiscent of those associated with tiki culture such as the Mai Tai.

<text>Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom Theme Park is a zoological theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, near Orlando. Owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Experiences division, it is the largest theme park in the world, covering . The park opened on Earth Day, April 22, 1998, and was the fourth theme park built at the resort. The park is dedicated and themed around natural environment and animal conservation, a philosophy once pioneered by Walt Disney.

Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom distinguishes itself from other Walt Disney World theme parks by featuring hundreds of live animal exhibits alongside traditional theme park elements. Special designs and provisions were incorporated throughout the park to protect the animals&#x27; welfare. The park is located on the western edge of the resort and is isolated from the other theme parks and properties to minimize external disruptions to the animals; as a result, the park does not feature nighttime fireworks shows that would otherwise disturb the animals. In efforts to be more eco-friendly, the park uses biodegradable paper straws and prohibits plastic straws, lids, and balloons. Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, indicating they have met or exceeded the standards in animal welfare, education, conservation, and research.

In 2023, the park hosted 8.77 million guests, making it the 16th-most-visited theme park in the world. It is the most-visited zoo in the world as of 2019. The park&#x27;s icon is the Tree of Life, a , artificial baobab tree.

== History ==
===Planning and construction===

Disney began planning a new park shortly after the opening of Disney-MGM Studios in 1989. Animal Kingdom was the brainchild of Imagineer Joe Rohde, who had previously designed the Adventurers Club at Pleasure Island. When presenting the idea of the new animal-themed park, Rohde brought a Bengal tiger into the meeting with Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Originally slated as Disney&#x27;s &quot;Wild Animal Kingdom,&quot; Disney announced plans for the construction of the park in 1995 at an estimated cost of $600-$800 million. To design the theme park, Disney Imagineers traveled to Africa and Asia to study the landscapes and wildlife.

In July 1996, construction was underway on the animal holding facilities, the installation of trees, shrubs, and grasses to shape the park&#x27;s African Savanna-inspired landscape. Disney Imagineers collected seeds from 37 countries to be used for the plants and grasses in the park. The landscaping efforts included spreading four million cubic yards of dirt, planting 40,000 mature trees (a mix of real Savanna species and artificial Baobab trees), constructing of underground utilities, and construction of various waterways, and structures built by over 2,600 construction workers. Many buildings contained thatched roofs assembled by Zulu workers from South Africa. About 1,500 hand-painted wooden horses were crafted in Bali under Disney supervision. Parts of the park were designed to have an aged appearance, with artificial potholes in the safari roads and boats peppered with dents and rust.

Most of the park&#x27;s animals were acquired in 1997 during the fall; they were held at a rented holding facility in northern Florida for quarantine and observation. Disney hired staff from 69 zoos around the United States to care for the animals.

===Operation===

The park opened to the public on April 22, 1998. Several marketing events surrounded the day. ABC aired a two-hour prime time special about the making of Animal Kingdom, as part of its &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; anthology series. Eisner and Disney Vice Chairman Roy Disney hosted an opening day party for 14,000 corporate partners, travel agents, and media figures, which included celebrities such as Michael J. Fox, Drew Carey, Stevie Wonder, David Copperfield, and Jane Goodall. Broadcasts of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot; aired live from the park on April 22.

In 2011, Disney announced a major expansion to the park, Pandora - The World of &quot;Avatar&quot;, a joint venture with director James Cameron and his production company, Lightstorm Entertainment, with the intention of transforming Animal Kingdom into a full-day operation with added attraction capacity and nighttime experiences. Construction on the area began on January 10, 2014, and the area opened to the public on May 27, 2017.

The park was closed from March 16 to July 11, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Florida.

===Future===
On September 9, 2023, it was announced at Destination D23 that DinoLand U.S.A. would be replaced with a new area inspired by the American tropics, and &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bug!&quot; would be succeeded by a &quot;Zootopia&quot;-themed film in the Tree of Life Theater.

On August 10, 2024, it was confirmed that &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bug!&quot; show would be replaced by the new show Zootopia: Better Zoogether in the Tree of Life Theater, opening in the winter of 2025, and DinoLand U.S.A. would be replaced by a new Tropical Americas land, set in the fictional town of Pueblo Esperanza, featuring &quot;Encanto&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;-themed attractions with completion expected by 2027.

In October 2024, the closing date of DinoLand, U.S.A. was pushed to 2025. The first phase of the closure of DinoLand, U.S.A. became effective on January 13, 2025, with the closure of the subsection Chester &amp; Hester&#x27;s Dino-Rama, including TriceraTop Spin, Fossil Fun Games, and Chester &amp; Hester&#x27;s Dinosaur Treasures. In February 2025, it was announced that &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bug!&quot; would close on March 17, 2025.

==Park layout and attractions==

Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom is divided into seven themed areas. The park&#x27;s Discovery River separates Discovery Island from the other lands. The park is home to approximately 2000 animals representing around 200 species. 

===Oasis===
Oasis is the park&#x27;s logistic equivalent to Main Street U.S.A. and provides the transition from the park&#x27;s entrance to the world of animals. The main paths feature animal exhibits and dense vegetation and trees lead deeper into the park and then onto Discovery Island. Between the parking lot and the Oasis sits a Rainforest Cafe, which can be entered from both inside and outside the ticketed area.

===Discovery Island===

Discovery Island is located at the center of the park and is an island within the park&#x27;s Discovery River waterway. It serves as the &quot;central hub&quot; connecting the other sections of the park by bridges, with the exception of Rafiki&#x27;s Planet Watch. It was originally called Safari Village, as Discovery Island was the name for the small zoological park located in Walt Disney World&#x27;s Bay Lake but was renamed after that area, which closed in 1999.

The Tree of Life, the park&#x27;s sculpted, man-made baobab tree, is located in this section and is surrounded by trails and animal enclosures. Inside the Tree of Life theater is &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bug!&quot;, a 4D film inspired by the 1998 Disney·Pixar animated film, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. The park&#x27;s largest gift shops and two of its major restaurants are on Discovery Island. &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bug!&quot; as the Florida version of the attraction will be permanently closed on March 17, 2025, which will likely by replaced by the new &quot;Zootopia&quot; 4D film Zootopia: Better Zoogether in the winter of 2025.

=== Pandora – The World of &quot;Avatar&quot; ===
Pandora – The World of &quot;Avatar&quot; is themed to the fictional habitable exomoon, Pandora, from James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; and devoted to the many extraterrestrial fauna and flora that inhabit it. The land&#x27;s marquee attraction is &quot;Avatar&quot; Flight of Passage, a 3D flying thrill simulator that mimics an exhilarating flight on a banshee across the Pandoran landscape. Another attraction, the Na&#x27;vi River Journey, is a dark boat ride through Pandora&#x27;s bioluminescent rainforests. The area opened on May 27, 2017.

=== Africa ===

Africa, set in the fictional east African port village of Harambe, resembles the local villages found in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Some snippets from Africa that were duplicated by the Disney Imagineers included a fortress that was found in Zanzibar, and a water-stained, crumbling old building that was found in Kenya. Harambe includes a &quot;hotel”, restaurants, an outdoor bar with live entertainment, and different marketplaces.

The village is the namesake of the &quot;Harambe Wildlife Preserve&quot;, the fictional home of the area&#x27;s main attraction, Kilimanjaro Safaris. Guests climb aboard an open-sided safari vehicle for an expedition to see African species in several large field enclosures, replicating the African savannas, rivers and rocky hills. The safari features the okapi, greater kudu, saddle-billed stork, bongo, black and southern white rhinoceros, hippopotamus, pink-backed pelican, Nile crocodile, Masai giraffe, blue wildebeest, springbok, Ankole cattle, common eland, sable antelope, and African bush elephant.

On the adjacent Gorilla Falls Exploration Trail, visitors trek into the forest to see animals such as the Western lowland gorilla, black-and-white colobus monkey, okapi, gerenuk, yellow-backed duiker, pygmy hippopotamus, Grévy&#x27;s zebra, South African meerkat, Kenyan sand boa, kori bustard, naked mole-rat, tarantulas, and, as well as an aviary. On the western side of the Africa area is the Harambe Theater, which is home to the &quot;Festival of the Lion King&quot;, a live stage show based on Disney&#x27;s 1994 animated feature film, &quot;The Lion King.&quot;

===Rafiki&#x27;s Planet Watch===

Rafiki&#x27;s Planet Watch is the only section of the park not connected to Discovery Island; it connects only to Africa. Guests board the narrow-gauge Wildlife Express Train for the short trip to and from the area, which consists of three sub-areas.

&quot;Conservation Station&quot; showcases the various conservation efforts supported by the Walt Disney Company. It also gives a behind-the-scenes glimpse into Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom&#x27;s animal care facilities, including a veterinary examination room complete with a two-way communications system so the veterinary staff can answer guest questions.

Outside, &quot;Affection Section&quot; is a petting zoo featuring goats, sheep, cattle, domestic pigs, donkeys, and alpacas.

The area also includes The Animation Experience at Conservation Station.

===Asia===

Asia, set in the fictional kingdom of Anandapur, evokes the traits of Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal, Thailand and Tibet. The first expansion area added to Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom in 1999, Anandapur translates to &quot;place of many delights&quot; in Sanskrit. According to the park&#x27;s fictional history, Anandapur was established as a royal hunting preserve in 1544. Asia contains both the riverside village of Anandapur and Serka Zong, which is set in the foothills of the Himalayas.

The visual focal point of Asia is Expedition Everest, a steel roller coaster ride through a forbidden Himalayan mountain guarded by the elusive Yeti. Nearby is Kali River Rapids, a river rapids ride. The Maharajah Jungle Trek leads guests through the forests and ruins outside the village, which are home to species such as the Javan banteng, bar-headed goose, Sumatran tiger, Indian blackbuck, Eld&#x27;s deer, white-handed gibbon, Indian flying fox, Komodo dragon and over 50 bird species. In the Anandapur Theatre, &quot;Feathered Friends in Flight&quot; is a live bird show featuring birds such as the black crowned crane and bald eagle.

===DinoLand U.S.A.===
DinoLand U.S.A. is set in the fictional American rural locale of Diggs County and is themed around dinosaurs and other extinct prehistoric life. The area is anchored by the Dino Institute, a palaeontological facility which is home to Dinosaur, a dark thrill ride loosely inspired by the film of the same name, featuring a trip through time to the Late Cretaceous. Just outside the institute is &quot;Dino-Sue&quot;, a casting of a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; fossil that is the most complete yet found. At the nearby Boneyard, there is a fossil site playground area with a Columbian mammoth fossil and a cast skeleton of a &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;. 

At the eastern edge of DinoLand U.S.A. is the Theater in the Wild, which hosts &quot;Finding Nemo: The Big Blue...and Beyond!&quot;, a musical stage show based on the story of the 2003 animated film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;.

Like the other sections of Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom, DinoLand formerly had animals on display. The animals, such as the American crocodile, red legged seriemas, Abdim&#x27;s stork and Asian brown tortoise, have evolutionary links to the age of the dinosaurs. They are animal species that have survived since the dinosaur era and can be found along the Cretaceous Trail along with a collection of Mesozoic plants.

==Former and unbuilt areas==
===Camp Minnie-Mickey===
Camp Minnie-Mickey was themed as a rustic summer camp, built as a placeholder on the location where Beastly Kingdom was intended to be built. The area closed on January 5, 2014, and was replaced by Pandora – The World of &quot;Avatar&quot;.

===Beastly Kingdom===
When originally conceived, Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom was to focus on three broad classifications of animals: those that exist in today&#x27;s reality; those that did exist but are now extinct (i.e., dinosaurs); and those that only exist in the realm of fantasy such as unicorns and dragons. The original design for Animal Kingdom included a themed section called Beastly Kingdom, devoted to creatures of legend and mythology. During the final stages of planning of development, Eisner decided that either Beastly Kingdom or DinoLand U.S.A. would be built first because of budget cuts after the failure of Euro Disney (known today as Disneyland Paris) and the higher cost of the upkeep and care of the animals at the park. DinoLand U.S.A. was chosen first mostly because of its lower budget. In 2000, Rohde said: &quot;We had a vision and now it&#x27;s become a placeholder. We have all kinds of ideas and not all of them fit with the theme of Beastly Kingdom. I&#x27;m not even convinced there will be a Beastly Kingdom.&quot;

==Restaurants and shops==
The park contains four table service restaurants:

* Rainforest Cafe, a themed restaurant chain operated by Landry&#x27;s, located just outside the main entrance (also accessible from inside the park). It is one of the two Rainforest Cafes at the Walt Disney World Resort.
* Yak &amp; Yeti, an Asian-themed restaurant located in the park&#x27;s Asia section (also operated by Landry&#x27;s).
* Tusker House, located in Africa and one of the park&#x27;s original quick-service restaurants, was converted into a buffet restaurant.
* Tiffins, located on Discovery Island, features the themed Nomad Lounge adjacent to it.

There are seven quick-service restaurants located throughout the park:

* Flame Tree Barbecue on Discovery Island
* Pizzafari on Discovery Island
* Satu&#x27;li Canteen in Pandora – The World of &quot;Avatar&quot;
* Restaurantosaurus in DinoLand U.S.A.
* Tamu Tamu Refreshments in Africa
* Harambe Market in Africa
* Yak &amp; Yeti Local Foods Café in Asia

As with other Walt Disney World theme parks, Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom has other locations and carts that offer snacks and beverages.

==Operations==
The park typically closes earlier in the day than other parks in the Walt Disney World Resort; Animal Kingdom began to stay open through the evening on May 27, 2016.

Disney does not allow plastic straws, lids, or balloons to be used in the park, unlike the rest of the Disney parks. This is so that plastic does not inadvertently enter an animal&#x27;s habitat and hurt them. Instead, the park uses biodegradable paper straws and offers lids for hot drinks only. The restrooms at Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom all have doors at their entrances. This practice is in place so that, in the event of an animal escaping, guests are able to shelter safely inside.

==Conservation efforts==

As a zoological park, Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom is engaged in research and conservation efforts involving its animal species. Since the park&#x27;s opening in 1998, the resident elephant herd has produced seven calves, with births in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2016. In 2008, the park&#x27;s giraffe herd produced four newborns, raising the total number of giraffe births since opening to eleven.

In 1999, one of the park&#x27;s white rhinoceros gave birth to a female calf named Nande. In 2006, Nande and Hasani, another of the park&#x27;s rhinos, were transferred to Uganda&#x27;s Ziwa animal sanctuary, in the first attempt to re-introduce white rhinos to the country. Civil strife had caused the white rhinoceros to be eradicated from the area. In June 2009, Nande gave birth to a male calf, the first such birth in Uganda in over 25 years. By January 2010, eight white rhinos had been born at Animal Kingdom since the park&#x27;s opening; the most recent was born to another Animal Kingdom-born mother.

==Gallery==
==Controversy==
Several Florida-based animal rights groups and PETA voiced concerns when the park originally opened, citing Walt Disney World&#x27;s previous missteps in handling animals at the defunct Discovery Island. The groups protested, and PETA tried to convince travel agents not to book trips to the park. On opening day, the Orange County Sheriff&#x27;s office sent about 150 deputies; about two dozen protesters showed up. The protest lasted two hours, and there were no arrests.

Following a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspection of the park, it was revealed that 31 animals died at Animal Kingdom between September 1997 and April 1998 from accidents, poisonings, fights, and other causes. Two Asian small-clawed otters died after ingesting loquat seeds from trees planted in their exhibit; two cheetah cubs died from ethylene glycol poisoning; nine herd animals died from injuries caused by fights, being entangled in fences while trying to escape, and, in one case, being kicked by an ostrich. Two crowned cranes were killed after being run over by safari vehicles in two separate incidents. The USDA ultimately found no violations of animal-welfare regulations. Disney responded to the report by hiring additional security to prevent animals from fighting, relocating the crowned cranes to walking paths, as well as adding mirrors to the safari vehicles.

One year after the park opened, Animal Rights Foundation of Florida complained that a New Year&#x27;s Eve fireworks show could upset the animals. A USDA inspector came to the park and found no problems with launching low-noise fireworks away. In January 2015, the animal rights group In Defense of Animals listed the park at number 10 on its 2014 &quot;list of worst zoos for elephants.&quot;

===Incidents===
In October 2014, a snake dropped out of a tree and bit a boy, precipitating the death of his great-grandmother who suffered a cardiac arrest as a reaction to the incident. The park confirmed that the snake that bit the boy was a non-venomous indigenous snake and that it did not escape from an enclosure. A lawsuit was threatened because of the incident. The lawsuit was never filed.

==Attendance==

As of 2019, Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom is the sixth-most-visited theme park in the world.

<text>Bayer 04 Leverkusen, officially known as Bayer 04 Leverkusen Fußball GmbH () and commonly known as Bayer Leverkusen or simply Leverkusen, is a German professional football club based in Leverkusen, North Rhine-Westphalia. It competes in the Bundesliga, the top tier of German football, and plays its home matches at the BayArena.

Founded in 1904 by employees of the pharmaceutical company Bayer (whose headquarters are in Leverkusen and from which the club draws its name), the club was formerly a department of TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen and RTHC Bayer Leverkusen, sports clubs whose members participate in athletics, gymnastics, basketball, field handball, rowing, tennis and hockey. In 1999, the football department was separated from the sports club. Bayer Leverkusen&#x27;s main colours are red and black, which feature across their playing kits and badge, and their main rivals are 1. FC Köln, Borussia Mönchengladbach and Fortuna Düsseldorf.

Bayer Leverkusen were promoted to the Bundesliga in 1979 and won their maiden top-flight honor, the UEFA Cup, in 1988. The club won its first domestic honour, the DFB Pokal, in 1993. The club finished runners-up across three competitions in 2002, including the UEFA Champions League. After over 30 years without silverware, the club won their first Bundesliga title and their second DFB Pokal in 2024, becoming the first German team to win the league or domestic double unbeaten, while setting the European record for consecutive unbeaten competitive games (51).

==History==
===Origins and early years===
On 27 November 1903, Wilhelm Hauschild wrote a letter – signed by 180 of his fellow workers – to his employer, the Friedrich Bayer and Co., seeking the company&#x27;s support in starting a sports club. The company agreed to support the initiative, and on 1 July 1904 &quot;Turn- und Spielverein Bayer 04 Leverkusen&quot; was founded as a works team. On 31 May 1907, a separate football department was formed within the club. In the culture of sports in Germany at the time, there was significant animosity between gymnasts and other types of athletes. Eventually this contributed to a split within the club: on 8 June 1928, the footballers formed a separate association – &quot;Sportvereinigung Bayer 04 Leverkusen&quot; – that also included the handball and fistball players, athletics, and boxing, while the gymnasts carried on as &quot;TuS Bayer 04 Leverkusen&quot;. &quot;SV Bayer 04 Leverkusen&quot; took with them the club&#x27;s traditional colours of red and black, with the gymnasts adopting blue and yellow.
Through this period, and into the 1930s, SV Bayer 04 Leverkusen played third and fourth division football. In 1936, they earned promotion to the second highest class of play of the period. That was also the year that the club wore the &quot;Bayer&quot; cross, still visible on their kits, for the first time. They made their first appearance in upper league play in 1951, in the Oberliga West and played there until 1956, after which they were relegated.
&quot;SV Bayer 04 Leverkusen&quot; would not return to the upper leagues until 1962, just one season before the formation of Germany&#x27;s new professional league, the Bundesliga. The next year saw the club in the Regionalliga West, tier II, where their performances over the next few seasons left them well down the league table.

===2. Bundesliga to Bundesliga, UEFA Cup, and DFB-Pokal===
SV Bayer 04 Leverkusen made something of a breakthrough in 1968 by winning the division title, but was unable to advance to the playoff round to the first division. The club was relegated again in 1973, but made a quick return to what was now called the 2. Bundesliga after just one season spent in the third division. Four years later, the club secured a place in the Bundesliga to start to play there in the 1979–80 season.

By the mid-1980s, SV Bayer 04 Leverkusen had become established in the upper half of the league table and was well-established there by the end of the decade. It was during this time, in 1984, that the two halves of the club that had parted ways over a half century earlier were re-united as TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen e.V. The new club took red and white as its colours.

In addition to becoming an established Bundesliga side, the club earned its first honours with a win in the 1988 UEFA Cup. Down 0–3 to Espanyol after the first leg of the final, Bayer Leverkusen drew even in the return match and then won the title on penalty kicks, 3–2.

That same year, long-time Bayer Leverkusen executive Reiner Calmund became the general manager of the club. The decade and a half following this saw club&#x27;s greatest successes.

After the German reunification in 1990, Reiner Calmund was quick to sign prominent East German players Ulf Kirsten, Andreas Thom and Jens Melzig. The three players would become instant crowd favourites, and make significant contributions to the team. Calmund also established contacts in Brazilian football, befriending Juan Figer, one of Brazil&#x27;s most powerful player agents. Over the next few years, budding superstars, such as Jorginho and Paulo Sérgio, joined the team, as did Czech star Pavel Hapal. The club also signed charismatic players, such as Bernd Schuster, and Rudi Völler, helping to ensure the team&#x27;s popularity and growing success.

The club won its next major honour in 1993 with a 1–0 win in the DFB-Pokal final against Hertha BSC second team (amateur squad) on 12 June 1993. In the following season, in a game in which Schuster scored a 45 m &quot;German Goal of the Year&quot;
(a goal which was later also named &quot;Goal of the Decade&quot;), Bayer played Eintracht Frankfurt early in the season, and, as both a &quot;tip of the hat&quot; to its own history as well as an attempt to perhaps upset the Frankfurt team, Bayer played in its new third colours, which were old-fashioned red and black stripes, similar jerseys to those Frankfurt generally wore at the time. This proved so popular with the fans that, very shortly thereafter, the team reverted to its &quot;retro&quot; colours of red and black, colours used on all home jerseys ever since.
After a near disaster in 1996 when the club faced a relegation battle, Bayer Leverkusen established itself as a powerful side, offering a technically pleasing offensive style of play under new coach Christoph Daum, who was also helped by the signing of players such as Lúcio, Emerson, Zé Roberto and Michael Ballack. Daum was later to be famously fired for a cocaine scandal that also cost him his ascent to the role of the Germany national team coach.

===The Nearly Men===

The team earned a series of four second-place finishes from 1997 to 2002. The finishes of 2000 and 2002 were heart-breaking for supporters, as on both occasions the team had the Bundesliga title within its grasp. In 2000, Bayer Leverkusen needed only a draw against SpVgg Unterhaching to win the title, but an own goal by Michael Ballack helped send the team to a crushing 2–0 defeat, while Bayern Munich won the title with a 3–1 victory over Werder Bremen. Two years later, the club surrendered a five-point lead atop the league table by losing two of its last three matches, while Borussia Dortmund swept ahead with three consecutive victories in its final matches. The 2002 season has been dubbed the &quot;Treble Horror&quot;, as Bayer Leverkusen were also beaten 4–2 in the DFB-Pokal final by Schalke 04 and lost the UEFA Champions League final 2–1 to Real Madrid, which also led to some of the English-language media dubbing them &quot;Neverkusen&quot;. Leverkusen was the first team to reach the final of the Champions League without ever having won a national championship. In addition, five members of the Bayer Leverkusen team were also members of the Germany national team which lost the final of the World Cup of 2002.

===Subsequent years===

In the 2002 off-season, the team sold midfielders Michael Ballack and Zé Roberto to Bayern Munich. Klaus Toppmöller, who had coached the team during its most successful year, was replaced by the Thomas Hörster. Klaus Augenthaler managed the last two games of the season with a win over his previous club, 1. FC Nürnberg. Bayer Leverkusen finished at a third-place finish and a Champions League place the following year.

That following season&#x27;s run in the Champions League saw the club open its group stage campaign with a 3–0 win against Real Madrid a result which helped Leverkusen to win the group. Leverkusen, however, was defeated in the first knockout round by eventual champions Liverpool. The club finished sixth during the 2004–05 season to qualify for the next season&#x27;s UEFA Cup.

Early in 2005, Augenthaler was fired as manager after the club got off to its worst Bundesliga start in over 20 years, with only one win in its first four league matches and a 0–1 home loss to CSKA Sofia in the first leg of its UEFA Cup match-up. Former Germany national team manager Rudi Völler, who had been named sporting director prior to the season, took charge of five matches as caretaker manager. Michael Skibbe, who was Völler&#x27;s assistant coach with the national team, was named as his successor in October 2005. Skibbe turned Leverkusen&#x27;s season around, and guided the club to a sixth-place finish in 2006, earning another UEFA Cup place, and then repeated that feat with a fifth place Bundesliga finish in 2007.

The 2007–08 season was not a successful one for Leverkusen despite a good start to the season; five out of the last ten league matches were lost to clubs in the lower half of the table. Michael Skibbe was heavily criticised towards the end of the season after he continuously changed his starting line up. Bayer Leverkusen also lost a lot of its support towards the end of the season: in the 1–2 home loss against Hertha BSC, the Leverkusen fans caused much commotion, with fans chanting for the sacking of Skibbe, while some Ultras, who had seen enough, set fire to their jerseys and threw them onto the field. Michael Skibbe was sacked soon thereafter, leaving the club on 21 May 2008, with club officials stating that his departure was due to the team not qualifying for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup group stage.

The 2008–09 season got off to a great start for Bayer Leverkusen under new manager Bruno Labbadia, who the club had acquired from 2. Bundesliga club SpVgg Greuther Fürth. As the season progressed, however, the team secured no wins against top clubs in the Bundesliga. However, Leverkusen reached the DFB-Pokal final on 30 May 2009 in Berlin, but lost the game 0–1 to Werder Bremen. Leverkusen finished the season in ninth place in the Bundesliga table and Labbadia moved to Hamburger SV in June 2009. Shortly thereafter, Leverkusen presented Jupp Heynckes, who had previously managed Bayern Munich after Jürgen Klinsmann&#x27;s departure, as its new manager. In the 2010–11 season, Bayer Leverkusen finished as runner-up, thus qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 2005. However, Heynckes decided not to extend his contract and left Bayer Leverkusen in the 2011 close season to take over at Bayern Munich for a third time. In the 2012–13 and 2015–16 seasons, Leverkusen finished third with coach Sami Hyypiä and Roger Schmidt respectively, but were knocked out in the round of 16 of the Champions League the following season both times. In the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League, Leverkusen reached the quarter-finals for the first time since 2008, but were ultimately knocked out by Inter Milan in a 2–1 loss.

===Xabi Alonso era and first ever Bundesliga title===

In October 2022, with the club in the relegation zone, Leverkusen appointed Xabi Alonso as head coach in his first senior managerial role; he went on to guide the team to safety and a sixth-placed finish. In 2023–24, Alonso&#x27;s first full season in charge, Leverkusen achieved significant domestic and European milestones, bolstered by effective squad building and strategic signings including Switzerland captain Granit Xhaka, Victor Boniface, Jonas Hofmann, Alejandro Grimaldo, and Matej Kovar. By early 2024, they had set a new club record for the longest unbeaten start to a season followed by breaking the Bundesliga record (formerly held by Hamburger SV since the 1982–83 season) for the longest unbeaten run by a club in all competitions with 26 games unbeaten followed by breaking the European record of the European &quot;top 5 leagues&quot; (Bundesliga, Premier League, Primera División, Ligue 1, Serie A) set by Juventus in 2011 and 2012 of 43 cross-competitive compulsory games in a row without defeat. On 14 April 2024, Leverkusen were crowned Bundesliga champions for the first time ever after beating Werder Bremen 5–0, ending Bayern Munich&#x27;s run of 11 successive league titles. This was the club&#x27;s first trophy since winning the 1992–93 DFB-Pokal. On 9 May 2024, Leverkusen set a new record for the longest run of matches without a loss in European football history (since the introduction of UEFA club competitions) following a 2–2 draw against Roma in the Europa League; they broke the previous record of 48 set by Benfica between 1963 and 1965. Leverkusen then finished the league season unbeaten, the first club in the Bundesliga to do so. Their unbeaten streak ended in their 52nd game of the season with a hat trick by Ademola Lookman giving them a 3–0 loss to Atalanta in the Europa League final. They won the 2024 DFB-Pokal final by beating 1. FC Kaiserslautern to win the domestic double. At the start of the new season on 17 August 2024, the team won the 2024 DFL-Supercup for the first time ever beating VfB Stuttgart after penalties. However, their domestic unbeaten streak ended on 31 August 2024 after a 3–2 defeat to RB Leipzig.

==Logo history==
==Club culture==

In contrast to many other German football clubs, which hold close ties to their working-class roots, Bayer Leverkusen strives for a clean, family-friendly image. The BayArena has the reputation of being one of the most family-friendly football stadiums in Germany. Conversely, Bayer 04 was the first Bundesliga club whose fans identified themselves as &quot;Ultras&quot; and the city of Leverkusen is one of the old industrial cities of Germany.

Bayer Leverkusen is perceived by some to have an ongoing image problem of a different sort. Although they are a financially healthy club with a stable of strong players, many fans of the traditional clubs criticise Bayer Leverkusen as being a &quot;plastic club&quot; without traditions or a committed fan base, existing solely as a creation of their rich pharmaceutical company sponsor – Bayer AG. As a result, the club and their fans have started to emphasize their industrial origins with pride, calling themselves &quot;Werkself&quot; (Eng. &quot;Company Eleven&quot;, &quot;Factory team&quot;, &quot;Millhanders&quot;) or &quot;Pillendreher&quot; (Eng. &quot;Tablet twisters&quot;).

Bayer Leverkusen&#x27;s corporate origins, however, are far from unique. Other clubs, including PSV, FC Carl Zeiss Jena and Sochaux, share a similar reputation of being works teams. As distinguished from the various Red Bull teams (Salzburg, New York and Leipzig) which were established or redefined in the early 21st century primarily for commercial reasons, the formation of Bayer Leverkusen was motivated by the idea of promoting the living conditions of local factory workers early in the 20th century. In view of this tradition, UEFA allows Bayer Leverkusen to use the brand name Bayer in European club competitions, while disallowing such naming practices, most notably to Red Bull Salzburg.

==Charity==
In March 2020, Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich, and RB Leipzig, the four German UEFA Champions League teams for the 2019–20 season, collectively gave €30 million to Bundesliga and to Bundesliga teams that were struggling financially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>Natural Selection is a modification for the video game &quot;Half-Life&quot;. Its concept is a mixture of the first-person shooter and real-time strategy game genres. The game was created by Charlie &quot;Flayra&quot; Cleveland, who later founded the company Unknown Worlds Entertainment. Natural Selection v1 was first publicly released on Halloween 2002, and is now at version 3.2. &quot;Natural Selection 2&quot; was released in late 2012.

The game features two teams: Kharaa (alien species) and Frontiersmen (human space marines). The visible Kharaa &quot;units&quot; are actually simply the spawn of the real Kharaa (aliens) which are microscopic life-forms according to the storyline. The game was, in 2008, one of the ten most played &quot;Half-Life&quot; modifications in terms of players, according to GameSpy. On January 22, 2014 Unknown Worlds released the source code for download on a GitHub repository under GPLv3.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Natural Selection&quot; is a hybrid FPS/RTS that pits Marines against Aliens (&quot;the Kharaa&quot;), played primarily in the first-person perspective, within the confines of large atmospheric maps of spaceships or space stations, which have been invaded by the Kharaa.

There are two game modes in &quot;Natural Selection&quot;: Classic and Combat.

Classic is the original &quot;Natural Selection&quot; game, mixing FPS and RTS elements.
Natural Selection was one of the first multiplayer, first-person shooters to incorporate a &quot;Commander&quot;, whose view of the battlefield was essentially 2-D, from a strictly top-down perspective. One member of the marine team must enter the &quot;command chair&quot; to lead the team, and thus become the &quot;Commander&quot;. From here, he can purchase upgrades, issue movement orders and drop supplies - all from an overhead perspective, as in many RTS games. The commander can also place buildings, although these are inactive until built by players in the field.

The alien team has no defined leader, and so it must communicate and co-operate to ensure different roles are fulfilled as needed. There is only one &quot;Builder Class&quot;, the &quot;Gorge&quot; which can be used to build a multitude of structures. Gorges can choose to build three different &quot;upgrade&quot; chambers: Movement, Defense, and Sensory, each providing three distinct abilities each alien can get. Gorges can also build Offense chambers which damage Marines from a distance, and resource towers. When a resource nozzle is capped, the resources gained are split evenly among all aliens. Each alien can choose how he wants to use his own personal reserve of resource points : building structures (as a gorge), or gestating into higher lifeforms. On death of the lifeform or structure, there is no refund on the resource points spent. Kharaa &quot;Hive Sight&quot; reveals teammates through the walls and structures of the map, this was originally their answer to the commander with his top-down overview of the game. However, in later versions both teams have gained substantial advantage from the addition of a map hotkey. This overlays the whole level, showing teammates and friendly structures; plus enemies and structures currently in view of comrades, and areas under attack.

The aliens start with one active hive, randomly chosen from the 3 hive spots of the map. Active hives heal damaged aliens and respawn dead players. Marines initially spawn in a set location on the map, and after that spawn from Infantry Portals, which can be built in a set radius of the Command Chair. Healing and ammunition can be dropped by the commander in &#x27;packs&#x27; (at a cost) or obtained free from an Armoury.

The teams compete for territory, and critically for the resources (&#x27;res&#x27;) it offers. The currency for both sides, resources are obtained by building resource towers to tap the nozzles sited around the map. This is another area where the teams have a key difference - while marines draw on a common pool of resources, each alien accumulates a personal store. This further increases the requirement for teamwork on the alien side, to achieve the right balance of hives, lifeforms, resource towers and chambers.

The game ends when either all the marines or aliens are dead, and have no means to respawn. For the Frontiersmen (marine) side, this entails destroying all alien hives, ensuring no further alien players may respawn, and then hunting the rest down. For the Kharaa (alien) side, winning requires destroying all marine &quot;Infantry Portals&quot;, ensuring that they do not respawn, and then eliminating the rest of the marines. Other possibilities exist such as destroying the command chair, or destroying all finished hives, and killing the whole alien team before the remaining hive is fully grown.

Game duration and game balance has been continually addressed by Unknown Worlds Entertainment throughout each of their releases with extensive changelogs describing these issues. In v1, games were slower and often measured in hours. One of the stated aims of v2 was to address this, by introducing a broad range of changes to abilities, structures, etc. In current releases (v3), a typical game lasts 5–15 minutes, but can run over an hour, with both sides vying for control over strategically important &quot;Hive Rooms&quot; and &quot;Resource Nodes&quot;.

Combat is the team deathmatch, or beginner mode of &quot;NS&quot;. It was introduced in &quot;NS&quot; 3.0 to help new players learn how to play alien lifeforms in an easier environment.

Neither team can build structures, the marines do not have a commander, and aliens have only one hive. Each player has an individual experience meter, increased by killing enemies; dealing damage to the enemy hive/command chair or healing/repairing their own hive/command chair. When the experience meter reaches maximum, the player gains a level and it resets.

There have been various changes to the spawn system in the various betas to try to make matches more interesting and more winnable but also without making it such that a team that suffers a major loss of players can still come back. An admin configurable time limit (default 15 minutes) was introduced in beta 5 which remains in the final version. With the time limit, Marines are usually on the attacking side and Kharaa are on the defending side. Failure of the attacking side to win within the time limit results in a victory for the defending side.

== Reception ==
* GameSpy hailed Natural Selection as &quot;possibly the most ambitious user-made modification ever brought to fruition. This multiplayer-only mod somehow manages to transform the aging Half-Life into a seemingly brand-new, atmospheric, and surprisingly deep action-strategy game, pitting hive-minded aliens against resourceful space marines,&quot; and &quot;Natural Selection&#x27;s innovations are too numerous to list, but the marine&#x27;s &quot;commander&quot; mode deserves special mention. Playing as the marine commander, you can order and re-supply other marines in an RTS-style, top-down perspective.&quot;
* FiringSquad : &quot;The way all these details boil down in gameplay is simply amazing, and occasionally fascinating to just watch unfold,&quot; and &quot;is probably one of the most creative and well thought out shooters we’ve played in a very long time.&quot;
* Kotaku: &quot;In the end, &quot;Natural Selection 2&quot; is perhaps best described as a skeleton, or a scaffold. It&#x27;s an excellent, stable frame on which to hang cooperation, teamwork, and competition. As a multiplayer game, the experience is exactly as good as a player&#x27;s allies and enemies are. Strong teams, that join the game and work together to perfect and enhance their skills, could truly be a thing of beauty.&quot;

==Sequel==

&quot;Natural Selection 2&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Natural Selection&quot;. &quot;Natural Selection 2&quot; started development using the Source Engine, but their development blog later announced that Unknown Worlds had moved to the Spark engine, an engine they created themselves. &quot;Natural Selection 2&quot; has the same basic gameplay as &quot;Natural Selection&quot;, but with new weapons and abilities. It was released commercially on Steam. According to an interview with the game director, Charlie Cleveland (Flayra), the sequel continues where the original left off and features environments that are dark and denser. Several gameplay modes once available only as community-developed mods (such as Marines vs. Marines) became officially supported. In addition, a major new feature of &quot;Natural Selection 2&quot; is dynamic infestation , released in December 2006. The proposed feature would dynamically generate bacterial infestation based on what areas of the map the alien team controlled. The alpha testing of &quot;Natural Selection 2&quot; began on 26 July 2010. The game was released on October 30, 2012.

<doc id="502022" wikidata="Q381699" url="?curid=502022" title="Rejection sampling">
<text>In numerical analysis and computational statistics, rejection sampling is a basic technique used to generate observations from a distribution. It is also commonly called the acceptance-rejection method or &quot;accept-reject algorithm&quot; and is a type of exact simulation method. The method works for any distribution in formula_1 with a density.

Rejection sampling is based on the observation that to sample a random variable in one dimension, one can perform a uniformly random sampling of the two-dimensional Cartesian graph, and keep the samples in the region under the graph of its density function. Note that this property can be extended to &quot;N&quot;-dimension functions.

==Description==
To visualize the motivation behind rejection sampling, imagine graphing the probability density function (PDF) of a random variable onto a large rectangular board and throwing darts at it. Assume that the darts are uniformly distributed around the board. Now remove all of the darts that are outside the area under the curve. The remaining darts will be distributed uniformly within the area under the curve, and the formula_2‑positions of these darts will be distributed according to the random variable&#x27;s density. This is because there is the most room for the darts to land where the curve is highest and thus the probability density is greatest.

The visualization just described is equivalent to a particular form of rejection sampling where the &quot;proposal distribution&quot; is uniform. Hence its graph is a rectangle. The general form of rejection sampling assumes that the board is not necessarily rectangular but is shaped according to the density of some proposal distribution (not necessarily normalized to formula_3) that we know how to sample from (for example, using inversion sampling). Its shape must be at least as high at every point as the distribution we want to sample from, so that the former completely encloses the latter. Otherwise, there would be parts of the curved area we want to sample from that could never be reached.

Rejection sampling works as follows:

#Sample a point on the formula_2‑axis from the proposal distribution.
#Draw a vertical line at this formula_2‑position, up to the maximum y-value of the probability density function of the proposal distribution.
#Sample uniformly along this line from 0 to the maximum of the probability density function. If the sampled value is greater than the value of the desired distribution at this vertical line, reject the formula_2‑value and return to step 1; else the formula_2‑value is a sample from the desired distribution.

This algorithm can be used to sample from the area under any curve, regardless of whether the function integrates to 1. In fact, scaling a function by a constant has no effect on the sampled . Thus, the algorithm can be used to sample from a distribution whose normalizing constant is unknown, which is common in computational statistics.

==Theory==
The rejection sampling method generates sampling values from a target distribution formula_8 with an arbitrary probability density function formula_9 by using a proposal distribution formula_10 with probability density formula_11. The idea is that one can generate a sample value from formula_8 by instead sampling from formula_10 and accepting the sample from formula_10 with probability formula_15, repeating the draws from formula_10 until a value is accepted. formula_17 here is a constant, finite bound on the likelihood ratio formula_18, satisfying formula_19 over the support of formula_8; in other words, M must satisfy formula_21 for all values of formula_2. Note that this requires that the support of formula_10 must include the support of formula_8—in other words, formula_25 whenever formula_26.

The validation of this method is the envelope principle: when simulating the pair formula_27, one produces a uniform simulation over the subgraph of formula_28. Accepting only pairs such that formula_29 then produces pairs formula_30 uniformly distributed over the subgraph of formula_9 and thus, marginally, a simulation from formula_32

This means that, with enough replicates, the algorithm generates a sample from the desired distribution formula_9. There are a number of extensions to this algorithm, such as the Metropolis algorithm.

This method relates to the general field of Monte Carlo techniques, including Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that also use a proxy distribution to achieve simulation from the target distribution formula_9. It forms the basis for algorithms such as the Metropolis algorithm.

The unconditional acceptance probability is the proportion of proposed samples which are accepted, which is formula_35where formula_36, and the value of formula_37 each time is generated under the density function formula_38 of the proposal distribution formula_10.

The number of samples required from formula_10 to obtain an accepted value thus follows a geometric distribution with probability formula_41, which has mean formula_17. Intuitively, formula_17 is the expected number of the iterations that are needed, as a measure of the computational complexity of the algorithm.

Rewrite the above equation, formula_44
Note that formula_45, due to the above formula, where formula_46 is a probability which can only take values in the interval formula_47. When formula_17 is chosen closer to one, the unconditional acceptance probability is higher the less that ratio varies, since formula_17 is the upper bound for the likelihood ratio formula_50. In practice, a value of formula_17 closer to 1 is preferred as it implies fewer rejected samples, on average, and thus fewer iterations of the algorithm. In this sense, one prefers to have formula_17 as small as possible (while still satisfying formula_21, which suggests that formula_11 should generally resemble formula_9 in some way. Note, however, that formula_17 cannot be equal to 1: such would imply that formula_57, i.e. that the target and proposal distributions are actually the same distribution.

Rejection sampling is most often used in cases where the form of formula_9 makes sampling difficult. A single iteration of the rejection algorithm requires sampling from the proposal distribution, drawing from a uniform distribution, and evaluating the formula_15 expression. Rejection sampling is thus more efficient than some other method whenever M times the cost of these operations—which is the expected cost of obtaining a sample with rejection sampling—is lower than the cost of obtaining a sample using the other method.

==Algorithm==
The algorithm, which was used by John von Neumann and dates back to Buffon and his needle, obtains a sample from distribution formula_8 with density formula_61 using samples from distribution formula_10 with density formula_63 as follows:
* Obtain a sample formula_37 from distribution formula_10 and a sample formula_66 from formula_67 (the uniform distribution over the unit interval).
* Check if formula_68.
** If this holds, accept formula_37 as a sample drawn from formula_61;
** if not, reject the value of formula_37 and return to the sampling step.

The algorithm will take an average of formula_17 iterations to obtain a sample.

== Advantages over sampling using naive methods ==
Rejection sampling can be far more efficient compared with the naive methods in some situations. For example, given a problem as sampling formula_73 conditionally on formula_8 given the set formula_75, i.e., formula_76, sometimes formula_77 can be easily simulated, using the naive methods (e.g. by inverse transform sampling):
* Sample formula_73 independently, and accept those satisfying formula_79 
* Output: formula_80 (see also truncation (statistics))
The problem is this sampling can be difficult and inefficient, if formula_81. The expected number of iterations would be formula_82, which could be close to infinity. Moreover, even when you apply the Rejection sampling method, it is always hard to optimize the bound formula_17 for the likelihood ratio. More often than not, formula_17 is large and the rejection rate is high, the algorithm can be very inefficient. The Natural Exponential Family (if it exists), also known as exponential tilting, provides a class of proposal distributions that can lower the computation complexity, the value of formula_17 and speed up the computations (see examples: working with Natural Exponential Families).

== Rejection sampling using exponential tilting ==

Given a random variable formula_86, formula_87 is the target distribution. Assume for simplicity, the density function can be explicitly written as formula_9. Choose the proposal as

formula_89

where formula_90 and formula_91. Clearly, formula_92, is from a natural exponential family. Moreover, the likelihood ratio is

formula_93

Note that formula_94 implies that it is indeed a cumulant-generation function, that is,

:formula_95.

It is easy to derive the cumulant-generation function of the proposal and therefore the proposal&#x27;s cumulants.

::formula_96

As a simple example, suppose under formula_97, formula_98, with formula_99. The goal is to sample formula_100, where formula_101. The analysis goes as follows:

* Choose the form of the proposal distribution formula_102, with cumulant-generating function as 
::formula_103,

:which further implies it is a normal distribution formula_104.

* Decide the well chosen formula_105 for the proposal distribution. In this setup, the intuitive way to choose formula_105 is to set 
::formula_107, 
:that is formula_108 The proposal distribution is thus formula_109.

* Explicitly write out the target, the proposal and the likelihood ratio

:formula_110

* Derive the bound formula_17 for the likelihood ratio formula_112, which is a decreasing function for formula_113, therefore

:formula_114

* Rejection sampling criterion: for formula_36, if

:formula_116

holds, accept the value of formula_8; if not, continue sampling new formula_118 and new formula_119 until acceptance.

For the above example, as the measurement of the efficiency, the expected number of the iterations the natural exponential family based rejection sampling method is of order formula_120, that is formula_121, while under the naive method, the expected number of the iterations is formula_122, which is far more inefficient.

In general, exponential tilting a parametric class of proposal distribution, solves the optimization problems conveniently, with its useful properties that directly characterize the distribution of the proposal. For this type of problem, to simulate formula_8 conditionally on formula_124, among the class of simple distributions, the trick is to use natural exponential family, which helps to gain some control over the complexity and considerably speed up the computation. Indeed, there are deep mathematical reasons for using natural exponential family.

==Drawbacks==

Rejection sampling requires knowing the target distribution (specifically, ability to evaluate target PDF at any point).

Rejection sampling can lead to a lot of unwanted samples being taken if the function being sampled is highly concentrated in a certain region, for example a function that has a spike at some location. For many distributions, this problem can be solved using an adaptive extension (see adaptive rejection sampling), or with an appropriate change of variables with the method of the ratio of uniforms. In addition, as the dimensions of the problem get larger, the ratio of the embedded volume to the &quot;corners&quot; of the embedding volume tends towards zero, thus a lot of rejections can take place before a useful sample is generated, thus making the algorithm inefficient and impractical. See curse of dimensionality. In high dimensions, it is necessary to use a different approach, typically a Markov chain Monte Carlo method such as Metropolis sampling or Gibbs sampling. (However, Gibbs sampling, which breaks down a multi-dimensional sampling problem into a series of low-dimensional samples, may use rejection sampling as one of its steps.)

==Adaptive rejection sampling==

For many distributions, finding a proposal distribution that includes the given distribution without a lot of wasted space is difficult. An extension of rejection sampling that can be used to overcome this difficulty and efficiently sample from a wide variety of distributions (provided that they have log-concave density functions, which is in fact the case for most of the common distributions—even those whose &quot;density&quot; functions are not concave themselves) is known as adaptive rejection sampling (ARS).

There are three basic ideas to this technique as ultimately introduced by Gilks in 1992:

# If it helps, define your envelope distribution in log space (e.g. log-probability or log-density) instead. That is, work with formula_125 instead of formula_126 directly.
#* Often, distributions that have algebraically messy density functions have reasonably simpler log density functions (i.e. when formula_127 is messy, formula_128 may be easier to work with or, at least, closer to piecewise linear). 
# Instead of a single uniform envelope density function, use a piecewise linear density function as your envelope instead.
#* Each time you have to reject a sample, you can use the value of formula_129 that you evaluated, to improve the piecewise approximation formula_130. This therefore reduces the chance that your next attempt will be rejected. Asymptotically, the probability of needing to reject your sample should converge to zero, and in practice, often very rapidly.
#* As proposed, any time we choose a point that is rejected, we tighten the envelope with another line segment that is tangent to the curve at the point with the same x-coordinate as the chosen point.
#* A piecewise linear model of the proposal log distribution results in a set of piecewise exponential distributions (i.e. segments of one or more exponential distributions, attached end to end). Exponential distributions are well behaved and well understood. The logarithm of an exponential distribution is a straight line, and hence this method essentially involves enclosing the logarithm of the density in a series of line segments. This is the source of the log-concave restriction: if a distribution is log-concave, then its logarithm is concave (shaped like an upside-down U), meaning that a line segment tangent to the curve will always pass over the curve. 
#* If not working in log space, a piecewise linear density function can also be sampled via triangle distributions
# We can take even further advantage of the (log) concavity requirement, to potentially avoid the cost of evaluating formula_131 when your sample &quot;is&quot; accepted.
#* Just like we can construct a piecewise linear upper bound (the &quot;envelope&quot; function) using the values of formula_130 that we had to evaluate in the current chain of rejections, we can also construct a piecewise linear lower bound (the &quot;squeezing&quot; function) using these values as well.
#* Before evaluating (the potentially expensive) formula_131 to see if your sample will be accepted, we may &quot;already know&quot; if it will be accepted by comparing against the (ideally cheaper) formula_134 (or formula_135 in this case) squeezing function that have available.
#* This squeezing step is optional, even when suggested by Gilks. At best it saves you from only one extra evaluation of your (messy and/or expensive) target density. However, presumably for particularly expensive density functions (and assuming the rapid convergence of the rejection rate toward zero) this can make a sizable difference in ultimate runtime.

The method essentially involves successively determining an envelope of straight-line segments that approximates the logarithm better and better while still remaining above the curve, starting with a fixed number of segments (possibly just a single tangent line). Sampling from a truncated exponential random variable is straightforward. Just take the log of a uniform random variable (with appropriate interval and corresponding truncation).

Unfortunately, ARS can only be applied for sampling from log-concave target densities. For this reason, several extensions of ARS have been proposed in literature for tackling non-log-concave target distributions. Furthermore, different combinations of ARS and the Metropolis-Hastings method have been designed in order to obtain a universal sampler that builds a self-tuning proposal densities (i.e., a proposal automatically constructed and adapted to the target). This class of methods are often called as Adaptive Rejection Metropolis Sampling (ARMS) algorithms. The resulting adaptive techniques can be always applied but the generated samples are correlated in this case (although the correlation vanishes quickly to zero as the number of iterations grows).

<text>Władysław Franciszek Jabłonowski (25 October 1769 – 29 September 1802) was a Polish military officer who served in the French Revolutionary Army during the Napoleonic Wars. He is the first known Polish general of African descent.

After joined the French army, he died of yellow fever in 1802 in Saint-Domingue, after being sent there as part of the Saint-Domingue expedition, which saw Polish troops fighting alongside the French to restore slavery in the colony. After the French and Polish suffered heavily from yellow fever, they withdrew their surviving forces from Saint-Domingue.

Some of Polish soldiers sent to Saint-Domingue deserted and joined the Haitian rebels in their quest for independence, and about 400 settled on the island after the war. They were granted full citizenship by Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who led the country.

==Early life==
Of mixed ancestry, Władysław was the illegitimate child of Princess Maria Franciszka Dealire, who was born in Britain and married into the Polish aristocracy, and an unidentified man of African descent. He acquired the nickname &quot;Murzynek&quot;. Dealire&#x27;s husband, Polish nobleman Konstanty Jabłonowski, accepted the boy as his son and gave him his family name, so he was considered Polish.

On 25 February 1783, Jabłonowski as a youth was admitted to the French military academy at Paris École Militaire. There he was a schoolmate of Napoleon Bonaparte and Louis Nicolas D&#x27;avout. In a climate of bullying, he was subjected to racist taunts, including from Napoleon. Upon graduation on 20 February 1786, he joined the Régiment de Royal-Allemand with the rank of second lieutenant. 
He achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel within 8 years.

==Military career==
In 1794 Jabłonowski fought in Tadeusz Kościuszko&#x27;s uprising against Tsarist Russia. He participated in battles of Szczekociny, Warsaw, Maciejowice, and at Praga. 
A member of the Polish insurrectionist group Centralizacja Lwowska, he was sent to the Ottoman Empire to gain the support of the Ottoman and French governments for the creation a Polish army to antagonize Russia. Another opportunity for this later appeared with the French fighting in Italy.

He was appointed brigade chief in the French army on 4 January 1798. In 1799, he was under the command of General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski. 
In 1799 he was made &quot;General of Brigade&quot; of the Polish legions (the Dąbrowski Legion). 
He became provisional brigade general in the Army of Italy on 20 May 1800 after being nominated by General André Massena. 
However, his French superiors would not approve this rank. 
He distinguished himself in the battle of Bosco and Pasturana and commanded a legion in the Alps.

On 24 July 1801, he was again nominated to the rank of brigade general in the Polish legions by General Joachim Murat, an appointment that was confirmed on 21 December 1801 by the First Consul. In May 1801, he was appointed as the commander of the Danube Legion, which was renamed the 3rd Polish Half-Brigade on 21 December. He was subsequently given the option of serving in Louisiana or Saint-Domingue. He was sent at his own request to Saint-Domingue in May 1802 along with the 3rd Polish Half-Brigade and accompanied by his common-law wife Anne Penot. There he fought against Black rebels who had revolted against French rule in mid-1802. Jabłonowski died from yellow fever on 29 September 1802 in Jérémie.

The disease caused many deaths among French-led forces in the colony, killing more than those who died because of warfare. Approximately 400 men of the 3rd Polish Half-Brigade (renamed the 113th Line Infantry Half-Brigade on 2 September), out of 5,280 men of the unit, deserted the French and joined the rebels. They settled in what became Haiti, where their descendants are known as Polish Haitians.

==In Polish culture==
Jabłonowski is mentioned in Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s notable epic poem &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;, in the context of a veteran of the Polish legions recounting what he had seen:
::&quot;how Jabłonowski had reached the land where the pepper grows&quot;
::&quot;and where sugar is produced, and where in eternal spring&#x27;
::&quot;bloom fragrant woods: with the legion of the Danube there&quot;
::&quot;the Polish general smites the Negroes&quot; [&quot;Murzyns&quot;]&quot;, but sighs for his native soil&quot;

<text>Cancer Cell is a peer-reviewed scientific journal scientific journal that publishes articles that provide major advances in cancer research and oncology. The journal considers manuscripts that answer important questions relevant to naturally occurring cancers. Areas covered include basic cancer biology, therapeutic development, translational research, cancer model development, multi-omics and computational biology. &quot;Cancer Cell&quot; is also interested in publishing clinical investigations, in particular those that lead to establishing new paradigms in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of cancers; those that provide important insights into cancer biology beyond what has been revealed by preclinical studies; and those that are mechanism-based proof-of-principle clinical studies.

&quot;Cancer Cell&quot; is internationally regarded as one of the top cancer research and oncology journals. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the 2022 impact factor of the journal is 50.3. It is part of the Cell Press portfolio, which is owned by Elsevier. Issues are published monthly in print and online versions. All content becomes available for free one year after publication. In January 2021, &quot;Cancer Cell&quot; became a Transformative Journal as part of Elsevier&#x27;s efforts to increase Open Access content.

Cancer Cell publishes Research, Review, and Perspective articles, in addition to opinion pieces such as Letters, Commentaries, Previews, Spotlight, and Voices. The journal often publishes a yearly special issue with a compilation of review articles around a common topic. In the Cancer Cell website, articles can be browsed by Issue, Collection, early online access (&quot;Online Now&quot;), or annual &quot;Best of &quot;Cancer Cell&quot;&quot;.

==History==

&quot;Cancer Cell&quot; was launched in 2002 with the publication of its inaugural issue on February 1, 2002. In an Editorial published in this first issue, Editor-in-Chief Mariana Resnicoff introduced &quot;Cancer Cell&quot; as &quot;An exciting forum for cancer research&quot;. Following in the footsteps of the Cell Press flagship journal &quot;Cell&quot;, the goal of &quot;Cancer Cell&quot; was to publish cutting-edge findings in cancer research and to provide great author service by having a team of dedicated scientific editors that hold the highest standards of excellence, editorial consistency, and author service. Li-Kuo Su became Editor-in-Chief in 2003 and is recognized for promoting the journal&#x27;s growth and establishing it as one of the most reputable cancer research journals. He retired from his editorial activities in 2019. Steve Mao became &quot;Cancer Cell&quot; Editor-in-Chief in 2020 after serving as senior editor at &quot;Cell&quot; and &quot;Science&quot;.

===&quot;Changing for a better future&quot; editorial===

In the April 2020 special issue of &quot;Cancer Cell&quot;, Steve Mao published the editorial &quot;Changing for a Better Future&quot; delineating his views for the journal. This Editorial reiterated the journal&#x27;s commitment to scientific excellence and introduced key changes. While &quot;Cancer Cell&quot; is traditionally considered a journal interested in strong mechanistic studies, the Editorial highlights its interest in translational and clinical studies, as well in discovery papers that scientifically sound and conceptually bold. In line with the Cell Press rebranding strategy launched in 2020, Steve Mao vowed to continue publishing &quot;Science that Inspires&quot;. The Editorial also states the editors&#x27; commitment to increase communication with its scientific community and authors, as well as to work with authors to improve the revision process of manuscripts under consideration.

===Diversity and inclusion efforts===

In 2020, &quot;Cancer Cell&quot; made a number of changes to increase diversity and inclusion of underrepresented minorities in cancer research and oncology. In June 2020, the journal announced the new members of its advisory board (previously editorial board), which includes a higher representation of female scientists (&gt;40%) and physicians (~50%) and higher geographical and ethnic diversity. That same month, the &quot;Cell&quot; Editorial Team published the editorial &quot;Science has a racism problem&quot;, acknowledging the underrepresentation of Black scientists in STEM in the wake of the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. These events, in conjunction with the anti-immigration policies of the Trump administration in the U.S., led to a Summer of social reckoning in the scientific community. &quot;Cancer Cell&quot; joined the cancer research and oncology communities and their call for action and change by dedicating its September 2020 issue to the importance of diversity and immigration in cancer research in the U.S. and publishing a series of opinion pieces by scientists and clinicians that represent several minorities (immigrants, Black, Latinx, LGBTQ) and their allies. The journal has also published several articles that address ethnic health disparities and aim to increase the representation of non-Caucasian populations in cancer research and oncology.

As a part of Cell Press, &quot;Cancer Cell&quot; has supported Black in Cancer and the #BlackInCancerWeek campaign on Twitter. The journal also participated in the creation of the &quot;Rising Black Scientists Award&quot;, a cash award granted to one undergraduate student and one graduate student or postdoctoral trainee &quot;meant to break down barriers and create opportunities by providing funds to support professional development&quot;.

In January 2021, Cell Press introduced the Inclusion and Diversity Statement, in which authors may choose to disclose information related to how they are increasing their effort to promote genetic diversity in their study subjects, participation of minorities, and balancing gender representation, to name a few.

<text>Bardylis or Bardyllis (; ; –358 BC) was an Illyrian 
king, and the founder of the first attested Illyrian dynasty. During his reign, Bardylis aimed to make Illyria a regional power interfering with Macedon. He united many southern Illyrian tribes under his realm and defeated the Macedonians and Molossians several times, expanding his dominion over upper Macedonia, including Lynkestis, and ruling over Macedon through a puppet king. Before the rise of Macedon, Illyrians were the dominant power in the region. Bardylis also led raids against Epirus, but his soldiers were eventually expelled from the region.

Most scholars hold that the Illyrian kingdom that was established by Bardylis was centered along Lake Ohrid and east to the Prespa Lakes, which was called Dassaretis later in Roman times, located on the border between Macedon and Epirus. Illyrians, in particular under Bardylis&#x27; leadership, held a remarkable role in the development of the Argead Macedonian military. Philip II and Alexander the Great spent at least some of their youth age at Illyrian courts, getting well familiar with Illyrian customs, habits and specially military strategies and techniques.

According to ancient sources, Bardylis lived to over 90 years. According to these sources, Bardylis lived a long time and was at an advanced age when he faced Philip II of Macedon in 358 BC and at whose hands he died after Philip rejected his offer of peace based on Bardylis retaining conquered lands. Bardylis&#x27; son Cleitus revolted with the help of Taulantian king Glaukias against Alexander the Great in the siege of Pelium undertaken in 335 BC.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Bardylis/Bardulis&quot; contains the same root as the Albanian adjective &quot;i bardhë&quot; &quot;white&quot;, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*bʰór(h₁)ǵos&quot; &lt; &quot;*bʰreh₁ǵ-&quot; (&quot;to gleam, shine&quot;). The same root is found in the Messapic names &quot;Barzidihi&quot;, &quot;Barduli&quot; and &quot;Barletta&quot;.

The name &quot;Bardylis/Bardulis&quot;, spelled in Ancient Greek as ΒΑΡΔΥΛΙΣ, is among those Illyrian names that featured Albanoid affricates, which were not familiar to Ancient Greek and Roman authors, who transcribed them with alternating spellings using dentals and sibilants, and in particular they used Δ/D for the Illyrian king&#x27;s name.

== Biography ==
=== Reign ===
Bardylis was born around the year 448 BC. Bardylis became king despite his humble roots. A charcoal-burner and coal miner, he gained power by force and enjoyed the sympathy of the Illyrian warriors because he divided the spoils of war fairly and impartially. Bardylis did not succeed Sirras, but rather the previous Illyrian king who had entered into a peace treaty with Amyntas II over the control of Lynkestis. Bardylis succeeded in bringing the various Illyrian tribes together and soon made his kingdom a formidable power in the Balkans, resulting in a change in relations with Macedon.
No ancient sources identify Bardylis with any tribe or regime other than Illyrians and nothing is recorded about the center of his power, except that Philip&#x27;s victory against him in 358 BC gained control of Lyncestis and the territory as far as Lake Ohrid. According to a historical reconstruction, Bardylis founded a powerful Illyrian dynasty among the Dassaretii in the 5th century BC, and established a realm centered in their territory that comprised the area along Lychnidus and east to the Prespa Lakes, which was called &quot;Dassaretis&quot; later in Roman times. A fragment of Callisthenes ( 360 – 327 BC) which places Bardylis&#x27; realm between Molossis and Macedonia, well determines the position of that Illyrian kingdom in the area of Dassaretis. Bardylis&#x27; expansion in Upper Macedonia and Molossis, and his son Cleitus&#x27; revolt at Pelion in Dassaretis against Alexander the Great make this localization of the core of their realm even more plausible. There is also another historical reconstruction that considers Bardylis a Dardanian ruler, who during the expansion of his dominion included the region of Dassaretis in his realm, but this is considered an old fallacy because it is unsupported by any ancient source, while some facts and ancient geographical locations go squarely against it. The exact extension of the kingdom of Bardylis and Cleitus is not known, as it could have included other regions besides Dassaretis.

Bardylis, unlike previous Illyrian kings, developed both the military and economic aspects of his state. His subjects, the Damastini, began to issue fine silver coins from c. 395 BC in the Illyrian city of Damastion. These coins adopted a version of the standard coins and some emblems of the then powerful Chalcidian League. They also exported silver in ingot form. Other coins were issued from around 365 BC in Daparria, a mining city in what is now Kosovo which used the same standard and types as the coinage of the Damastini. The distribution of the coins suggest that Bardylis built up trade within the central Balkans and northwards to the Danube, which was far from the areas dominated by the Greek traders. Dionysius of Syracuse tried to take advantage of Bardylis&#x27;s growing trade when he established colonies in the Adriatic. It is probable that Bardylis, unlike previous Illyrian kings, built a few fortified cities, for Lychnidus and Pelion in Lynkestis were walled sites probably before the accession of Philip.

Bardylis was an ambitious Illyrian ruler, who (according to Tertullian) after seeing a sign in a dream, embarked on a series of military victories which allowed him to extend Illyrian rule over the Molossians and other regional tribes, as far as the frontiers of Macedon.

=== Macedonian campaigns ===
It seems that Bardylis opposed the agreement between Amyntas III and Sirras and invaded Macedon in 393 BC. Bardylis used new warfare tactics never before used by any of the Illyrians. He won a decisive battle against Amyntas III, expelled him, and ruled Macedon through a puppet king. In 392 BC, Amyntas III allied himself with the Thessalians and was able to bring Macedon back under his rule from the Illyrians. However, the Illyrians were constantly raiding the northern frontiers of Macedon. After continuous invasions, Bardylis was able to force Macedon to pay him an annual tribute in 372 BC.

In 370 BC, the Macedonian king Amyntas III died, having restored the fortunes of his kingdom after the Illyrian disasters from earlier in his reign. His marriage to Eurydice, daughter of Lyncestian prince Sirras produced three sons and a daughter. His eldest son was Alexander II. In 369 BC, Bardylis prevented Alexander II from eliminating the Illyrians from Macedonia. After the battle, Bardylis was said to have briefly held Philip II, the youngest brother of Alexander II, as a hostage. In 368 BC, Alexander II was succeeded by his brother Perdiccas III.

The Paeonians began a series of raids against the Macedonians in support of a Illyrian invasion from the north. Perdiccas III, king of Macedonia, humiliated by the indignity of having to pay tribute to the Illyrians, marched north in the spring of 359 BC with the Macedonian army to resolve the issue by battle. This was not the first occasion in which he had fought against Bardylis, but the Macedonians lost the battle. The king himself was among the 4,000 Macedonians dead. The remainder, panic-stricken after having become exceedingly afraid of the Illyrian army, lost heart for continuing the war. This was the worst loss suffered by the Macedonians in their efforts to free themselves from the Illyrian invaders. The Illyrians followed up their victory by expanding their control southward to Lake Lychnitis (Lake Ohrid) and westward into Upper Macedonia. Through the actions of Bardylis, the Illyrians had brought Macedon close to collapse.

When Philip II, the youngest of the three brothers assumed the throne, he was determined to subdue the Illyrians under Bardylis once and for all, and thus destroy the Illyrian menace. 

=== Raid on Epirus ===

In 385 BC, the Illyrians, who at that time were under Bardylis&#x27; rule, formed an alliance with the powerful tyrant Dionysius of Syracuse. The purpose of the agreement was the restoration to the throne of the Molossian Alcetas which laterly was restored as King of Molossians, who had become a refugee living at the court of Dionysius. Both sides were interested in the benefits of such an alliance as it would secure Illyrian power and weaken the influence of the Spartans and Macedonians in Epirus. This would also give Dionysius an opportunity to strengthen trade opportunities along the shores of the Adriatic and Ionian seas.

Dionysius sent 2,000 men and 5,000 weapons to the Illyrians who were prepared to go to war. With these new supplies, Bardylis and his army invaded Epirus and slaughtered 15,000 Molossians. However, this action came to naught after the Spartans under Agesilaus intervened and expelled the Illyrians from the region.

In 360 BC, another Illyrian attack forced the Molossian king Arymbas to evacuate his non-combatant population to Aetolia and he let the Illyrians loot the region again. The stratagem worked and the Molossians fell upon the Illyrians who were encumbered with booty and defeated them. In the same year Arymbas also defeated the Illyrians after they raided and looted Epirus.

=== Battle of Erigon Valley ===
In 359 BC, Macedon was able to return to the field of battle against the Illyrians, after it had overcome the internal state of political chaos and removed the risk of attack from other opponents. When Philip II assumed the Macedonian throne, substantial areas of upper Macedonia remained under the control of Bardylis. In order to concentrate on the internal struggle necessary to secure his crown, Philip reaffirmed the treaty the Illyrians had imposed on Macedonia by force of arms and sealed the alliance by his marriage to Audata, great-granddaughter of Bardylis. This action undoubtedly deterred a full-scale Illyrian invasion of Macedon at a time when the country was most vulnerable.

By the spring of 358 BC, Philip had at last secured his throne and was now able to address the occupation of north-west Macedon by Bardylis. When word of the mobilization of the Macedonian army came to Bardylis&#x27;s attention, he proposed to Philip that they sign a treaty to maintain the status quo, provided that both parties maintain the cities that were already in their possession at the time. This was, of course, unacceptable to Philip because he was not prepared to accept any terms other than a full Illyrian withdrawal from north-west Macedonia. Bardylis, however, was not inclined to give up his gains without a fight. Philip mobilized every able-bodied soldier in Macedon for the battle. Bardylis, as before, was not likely to take any prisoners, so any Macedonian defeat would result in crippling casualties.

Although the two armies were almost equal in numbers – Bardylis&#x27;s 500 cavalry and 10,000 infantry against Philip&#x27;s force of 600 cavalry and 10,000 infantry – the Macedonians were far better trained and equipped. The armies met in battle on a plain in the Erigon Valley near Bitola, just south-east of Illyria. Bardylis initially deployed in a linear formation with his strongest troops in the centre, similar to the phalanx formation. Philip concentrated his best troops, the hypaspists, on his right flank. As Philip advanced to engage Bardylis, his cavalry turned one or two of Bardylis&#x27; flanks, forcing him to redeploy into a defensive square formation. The Illyrians for quite some time withstood the assaults of the enemy. At first neither party had control of the battlefield, and so the battle continued for a long time. Eventually Philip&#x27;s hypaspists succeeded in penetrating the right corner of the Illyrian forces, which other Macedonian troops were able to widen. This threw Bardylis&#x27;s entire formation into disorder, after which it was quickly broken by the phalanx and routed from the battlefield.

Thus Philip II of Macedon was able to defeat Bardylis. Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC) writes of the event:
&quot;And at first for a long while the battle was evenly poised because of the exceeding gallantry displayed on both sides, and as many were slain and still more wounded, the fortune of battle vacillated first one way then the other, being constantly swayed by the valorous deeds of the combatants; but later as the horsemen pressed on from the flank and rear and Philip with the flower of his troops fought with true heroism, the mass of the Illyrians was compelled to take hastily to flight.When the pursuit had been kept up for a considerable distance and many had been slain in their flight, Philip recalled the Macedonians with the trumpet and erecting a trophy of victory buried his own dead, while the Illyrians, having sent ambassadors and withdrawn from all the Macedonian cities, obtained peace. But more than seven thousand Illyrians were slain in this battle.&quot; 
The battle had cost the Illyrian 7,000 casualties, almost three quarters of their initial army. Bardylis himself was probably killed in this battle as he rode on horseback at the advanced age of 90. Although the Macedonians finally won the battle, Philip II saw that he was not able to follow the enemy and chase them. The Illyrians later sent representatives and settled terms for peace, releasing all the cities they had conquered from Macedonia. In this battle, the troubling issue of Lynkestis was resolved, changing the situation in the western borders in favour of Macedonia. Philip secured Macedon&#x27;s north-west frontier by annexing Illyrian territory as far as Lake Lynkcesta (Lake Ohrid). This would form a defensive buffer against any future Illyrian raids attempted through the Drilon Valley. The borders between the Illyrian and the Macedonians remained around Lake Ohrid for a long time.

== Family ==
Bardylis had a son named Cleitus. Cleitus&#x27; son was presumably Bardylis II. The Illyrian princess Bircenna, who married the Molossian king Pyrrhus of Epirus (c. 290 BC), was the daughter of Bardylis II. Bardylis&#x27; daughter or granddaughter Audata married Philip II of Macedon.

<text>A question is an utterance which serves as a request for information. Questions are sometimes distinguished from interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms, typically used to express them. Rhetorical questions, for instance, are interrogative in form but may not be considered questions, as they are not expected to be answered.

Questions come in a number of varieties. For instance; &quot;Polar questions&quot; are those such as the English example &quot;Is this a polar question?&quot;, which can be answered with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. &quot;Alternative questions&quot; such as &quot;Is this a polar question, or an alternative question?&quot; present a list of possibilities to choose from. &quot;Open questions&quot; such as &quot;What kind of question is this?&quot; allow many possible resolutions.

Questions are widely studied in linguistics and philosophy of language. In the subfield of pragmatics, questions are regarded as illocutionary acts which raise an issue to be resolved in discourse. In approaches to formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics, questions are regarded as the denotations of interrogatives, and are typically identified as sets of the propositions which answer them.

== Definitions ==
Linguistically, a question may be defined on three levels.

At the level of semantics, a question is defined by its ability to establish a set of logically possible answers.

At the level of pragmatics, a question is an illocutionary category of speech act which seeks to obtain information from the addressee.

At the level of syntax, the interrogative is a type of clause which is characteristically associated with questions, and defined by certain grammatical rules (such as subject–auxiliary inversion in English) which vary by language.

Some authors conflate these definitions. While prototypical questions (such as &quot;What is your name?&quot;) will satisfy all three definitions, their overlap is not complete. For example &quot;I would like to know your name.&quot; satisfies the pragmatic definition, but not the semantic or syntactic ones. Such mismatches of form and function are called indirect speech acts.

== Uses ==

The principal use of questions is to elicit information from the person being addressed by indicating the information which the speaker (or writer) desires.

A slight variant is the display question, where the addressee is asked to produce information which is already known to the speaker. For example, a teacher or game show host might ask &quot;What is the capital of Australia?&quot; to test the knowledge of a student or contestant.

A direction question is one that seeks an instruction rather than factual information. It differs from a typical (&quot;information&quot;) question in that the characteristic response is a directive rather than a declarative statement. For example:

:A: When should I open your gift?
:B: Open it now.

Questions may also be used as the basis for a number of indirect speech acts. For example, the imperative sentence &quot;Pass the salt.&quot; can be reformulated (somewhat more politely) as:

:Would you pass the salt?

Which has the form of an interrogative, but the illocutionary force of a directive.

The term rhetorical question may be colloquially applied to a number of uses of questions where the speaker does not seek or expect an answer (perhaps because the answer is implied or obvious), such as:

:Has he lost his mind?
:Why have I brought you all here? Let me explain...
:They&#x27;re closed? But the website said it was open until 10 o&#x27;clock.

Loaded questions (a special case of complex questions), such as &quot;Have you stopped beating your wife?&quot; may be used as a joke or to embarrass an audience, because any answer a person could give would imply more information than he was willing to affirm.

== Semantic classification ==
The main semantic classification of questions is according to the set of logically possible answers that they admit. An open question, such as &quot;What is your name?&quot;, allows indefinitely many possible answers. A closed question admits a finite number of possible answers. Closed questions may be further subdivided into yes–no questions (such as &quot;Are you hungry?&quot;) and alternative questions (such as &quot;Do you want jam or marmalade?&quot;).

The distinction between these classes tends to be grammaticalized. In English, open and closed interrogatives are distinct clause types characteristically associated with open and closed questions, respectively.

=== Yes–no questions ===
A &quot;yes–no question&quot; (also called a &quot;polar question&quot;, or &quot;general question&quot;) asks whether some statement is true. They can, in principle be answered by a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; (or similar words or expressions in other languages). Examples include &quot;Do you take sugar?&quot;, &quot;Should they be believed?&quot; and &quot;Am I the loneliest person in the world?&quot;

=== Alternative questions ===
An &quot;alternative question&quot; presents two or more discrete choices as possible answers in an assumption that only one of them is true. For example:

:Are you supporting England, Ireland or Wales?

The canonical expected answer to such a question would be either &quot;England&quot;, &quot;Ireland&quot;, or &quot;Wales&quot;. Such an alternative question presupposes that the addressee supports one of these three teams. The addressee may cancel this presupposition with an answer like &quot;None of them&quot;.

In English, alternative questions are not syntactically distinguished from yes–no questions. Depending on context, the same question may have either interpretation:
*Do these muffins have butter or margarine? [I&#x27;m on a low fat diet.]
*Do these muffins have butter or margarine? [I saw that the recipe said you could use either.]
In speech, these are distinguishable by intonation, i.e., the question is interpreted as an alternative question when uttered with a rising contour on &quot;butter&quot; and a falling contour on &quot;margarine&quot;.

=== Open questions ===
An &quot;open question&quot; (also called a &quot;variable question&quot;, &quot;non-polar question&quot;, or &quot;special question&quot;) admits indefinitely many possible answers. For example:

:Where should we go for lunch?

In English, these are typically embodied in a closed interrogative clause, which uses an interrogative word such as &quot;when&quot;, &quot;who&quot;, or &quot;what&quot;. These are also called &quot;wh&quot;-words, and for this reason open questions may also be called &quot;wh&quot;-questions.

== Question formation ==
Questions may be marked by some combination of word order, morphology, interrogative words, and intonation. Where languages have one or more clause type characteristically used to form questions, they are called interrogative clauses. Open and closed questions are generally distinguished grammatically, with the former identified by the use of interrogative words.

In English, German, French and various other (mostly European) languages, both forms of interrogative are subject to an inversion of word order between verb and subject. In English, the inversion is limited to auxiliary verbs, which sometimes necessitates the addition of the auxiliary &quot;do&quot;, as in:

::a. Sam reads the newspaper. 
::b. Does Sam read the newspaper? 

=== Open questions ===
Open questions are formed by the use of interrogative words such as, in English, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, or &quot;which&quot;. These stand in as variables representing the unknown information being sought. They may also combine with other words to form interrogative phrases, such as &quot;which shoes&quot; in:

:Which shoes should I wear to the party?

In many languages, including English and most other European languages, the interrogative phrase must (with certain exceptions such as echo questions) appear at the beginning of the sentence, a phenomenon known as wh-fronting. In other languages, the interrogative appears in the same position as it would in a corresponding declarative sentence (&quot;in situ&quot;).

A question may include multiple variables as in:

:Whose gifts are in which boxes?

=== Polar questions ===
Different languages may use different mechanisms to distinguish polar (&quot;yes-no&quot;) questions from declarative statements (in addition to the question mark). English is one of a small number of languages which use word order. Another example is French:

Cross-linguistically, the most common method of marking a polar question is with an interrogative particle, such as the Japanese &quot;ka&quot;, Mandarin &quot;ma&quot; and Polish &quot;czy&quot;.

Other languages use verbal morphology, such as the &quot;-n&quot; verbal postfix in the Tunica language.

Of the languages examined in the World Atlas of Language Structures, only one, Atatláhuca–San Miguel Mixtec, was found to have no distinction between declaratives and polar questions.

==== Intonation ====
Most languages have an intonational pattern which is characteristic of questions (often involving a raised pitch at the end, as in English).

In some languages, such as Italian, intonation is the sole distinction.

In some languages, such as English, or Russian, a rising declarative is a sentence which is syntactically declarative but is understood as a question by the use of a rising intonation. For example, &quot;You&#x27;re not using this?&quot;

On the other hand, there are English dialects (Southern Californian English, New Zealand English) in which rising declaratives (the &quot;uptalk&quot;) do not constitute questions. However it is established that in English there is a distinction between &quot;assertive&quot; rising declaratives and &quot;inquisitive&quot; rising declaratives, distinguished by their prosody.

==== Request for confirmation and speaker presupposition ====
Questions may be phrased as a request for confirmation for a statement the interrogator already believes to be true.

A tag question is a polar question formed by the addition of an interrogative fragment (the &quot;tag&quot;) to a (typically declarative) clause. For example:

:You&#x27;re John, 
:Let&#x27;s have a drink, 
:You remembered the eggs, 

This form may incorporate speaker&#x27;s presupposition when it constitutes a complex question.
Consider a statement
:(A) Somebody killed the cat
and several questions related to it.
:(B) John killed the cat, did he? (tag question)
:(C) Was it John who killed the cat?
As compared with:
:(D) Who killed the cat?
Unlike (B), questions (C) and (D) incorporate a presupposition that somebody killed the cat.

Question (C) indicates speaker&#x27;s commitment to the truth of the statement that somebody killed the cat, but no commitment as to whether John did it or did not.

=== Punctuation ===
In languages written in Latin, Cyrillic or certain other scripts, a question mark at the end of a sentence identifies questions in writing. As with intonation, this feature is not restricted to sentences having the grammatical form of questions – it may also indicate a sentence&#x27;s pragmatic function.

In Spanish an additional inverted mark is placed at the beginning: &quot;¿Cómo está usted?&quot; &quot;How are you?&quot;. An uncommon variant of the question mark is the interrobang (‽), which combines the function of the question mark and the exclamation mark.

== Responses and answers ==
The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language distinguishes between an &quot;answer&quot; (being a member of the set of logically possible answers, as delineated in ) and a &quot;response&quot; (any statement made by the addressee in reply to the question). For example, the following are all possible responses to the question &quot;Is Alice ready to leave?&quot;

 i. (a) Yes.
 (b) She&#x27;s ready.
 (c) No, she&#x27;s not.
 ii. (a) I don&#x27;t know.
 (b) Why do you ask?
 (c) She might be.
 iii.(a) She&#x27;s still looking for her wallet.
 (b) She wasn&#x27;t expecting you before 5 o&#x27;clock.
 (c) I&#x27;ll let you know when she&#x27;s ready.

Only the [i] responses are answers in the Cambridge sense. The responses in [ii] avoid committing to a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer. The responses in [iii] all &quot;implicate&quot; an answer of &quot;no&quot;, but are not logically equivalent to &quot;no&quot;. (For example, in [iiib], the respondent can cancel the implicature by adding a statement like: &quot;Fortunately, she packed everything up early.&quot;)

Along similar lines, Belnap and Steel (1976) define the concept of a &quot;direct answer&quot;:

A direct answer to a given question is a piece of language that completely, but just completely, answers the question...What is crucial is that it be effectively decidable whether a piece of language is a direct answer to a specific question... To each clear question there corresponds a set of statements which are &quot;directly&quot; responsive. ... A direct answer must provide an unarguably final resolution of the question.
=== Answering negative questions ===
&quot;Negative questions&quot; are interrogative sentences which contain negation in their phrasing, such as &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t you be working?&quot; These can have different ways of expressing affirmation and denial from the standard form of question, and they can be confusing, since it is sometimes unclear whether the answer should be the opposite of the answer to the non-negated question. For example, if one does not have a passport, both &quot;Do you have a passport?&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t you have a passport?&quot; are properly answered with &quot;No&quot;, despite apparently asking opposite questions. The Japanese and Korean languages avoid this ambiguity. Answering &quot;No&quot; to the second of these in Japanese or Korean would mean, &quot;I &quot;do&quot; have a passport&quot;.

A similar ambiguous question in English is &quot;Do you mind if...?&quot; The responder may reply unambiguously &quot;Yes, I do mind,&quot; if they do mind, or &quot;No, I don&#x27;t mind,&quot; if they do not, but a simple &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Yes&quot; answer can lead to confusion, as a single &quot;No&quot; can seem like a &quot;Yes, I do mind&quot; (as in &quot;No, please don&#x27;t do that&quot;), and a &quot;Yes&quot; can seem like a &quot;No, I don&#x27;t mind&quot; (as in &quot;Yes, go ahead&quot;). An easy way to bypass this confusion would be to ask a non-negative question, such as &quot;Is it all right with you if...?&quot;

Some languages have different particles (for example the French &quot;&quot;si&quot;, the German &quot;doch&quot; or the Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian &quot;jo&quot;&quot;) to answer negative questions (or negative statements) in an affirmative way; they provide a means to express contradiction.

== Indirect questions ==
As well as direct questions (such as &quot;Where are my keys?&quot;), there also exist indirect questions (also called &quot;interrogative content clauses&quot;), such as &quot;where my keys are&quot;. These are used as subordinate clauses in sentences such as &quot;I wonder where my keys are&quot; and &quot;Ask him where my keys are.&quot; Indirect questions do not necessarily follow the same rules of grammar as direct questions. For example, in English and some other languages, indirect questions are formed without inversion of subject and verb (compare the word order in &quot;where are they?&quot; and &quot;(I wonder) where they are&quot;). Indirect questions may also be subject to the changes of tense and other changes that apply generally to indirect speech.

== Learning ==
Questions are used from the most elementary stage of learning to original research. In the scientific method, a question often forms the basis of the investigation and can be considered a transition between the observation and hypothesis stages. Students of all ages use questions in their learning of topics, and the skill of having learners creating &quot;investigatable&quot; questions is a central part of inquiry education. The Socratic method of questioning student responses may be used by a teacher to lead the student towards the truth without direct instruction, and also helps students to form logical conclusions.

A widespread and accepted use of questions in an educational context is the assessment of students&#x27; knowledge through exams.

== Origins ==
Enculturated apes Kanzi, Washoe, Sarah and a few others who underwent extensive language training programs (with the use of gestures and other visual forms of communications) successfully learned to &quot;answer&quot; quite complex questions and requests (including question words &quot;who&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, &quot;where&quot;), although so far they have failed to learn how to &quot;ask questions themselves&quot;. For example, David and Anne Premack wrote: &quot;Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions — unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny&#x27;s house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else&quot;. The ability to ask questions is often assessed in relation to comprehension of syntactic structures. It is widely accepted that the first questions are asked by humans during their early infancy, at the pre-syntactic, one word stage of language development, with the use of question intonation.

<doc id="502042" wikidata="Q387743" url="?curid=502042" title="Poisson summation formula">
<text>In mathematics, the Poisson summation formula is an equation that relates the Fourier series coefficients of the periodic summation of a function to values of the function&#x27;s continuous Fourier transform. Consequently, the periodic summation of a function is completely defined by discrete samples of the original function&#x27;s Fourier transform. And conversely, the periodic summation of a function&#x27;s Fourier transform is completely defined by discrete samples of the original function. The Poisson summation formula was discovered by Siméon Denis Poisson and is sometimes called Poisson resummation.

For a smooth, complex valued function formula_1 on formula_2 which decays at infinity with all derivatives (Schwartz function), the Poisson summation formula states that

where formula_3 is the Fourier transform of formula_4, i.e., formula_5 
The summation formula can be restated in many equivalent ways, but a simple one is the following. Suppose that formula_6 and formula_7 is a unimodular lattice in formula_8. Then the periodization of formula_9, which is defined as the sum 
formula_10
converges in the formula_11 norm of formula_12 to an formula_13 function having Fourier series
formula_14
where formula_15 is the dual lattice to formula_7. (Note that the Fourier series on the right-hand side need not converge in formula_11 or otherwise.)

==Periodization of a function==
Consider periodic functions, where parameters formula_18 and formula_19 are in the same units as formula_20:
formula_21

Then is a special case (P=1, x=0) of this generalization:

which is a Fourier series expansion with coefficients that are samples of the function formula_22 Similarly:

also known as the important Discrete-time Fourier transform.

==Derivations==
A proof may be found in either Pinsky or Zygmund.  , for instance, holds in the sense that if formula_23, then the right-hand side is the (possibly divergent) Fourier series of the left-hand side. It follows from the dominated convergence theorem that formula_24 exists and is finite for almost every formula_20. Furthermore it follows that formula_26 is integrable on any interval of length formula_27 So it is sufficient to show that the Fourier series coefficients of formula_24 are formula_29 Proceeding from the definition of the Fourier coefficients we have:

formula_30

where the interchange of summation with integration is once again justified by dominated convergence. With a change of variables (formula_31) this becomes:

formula_32The proof of is of course similar, except that the formula for series coefficients in frequency is:

:formula_33

The sign of  formula_34  is positive, because it has to be the opposite of the one on the right-hand side of .

==Distributional formulation==

These equations can be interpreted in the language of distributions for a function formula_4 whose derivatives are all rapidly decreasing (see Schwartz function). 
The Poisson summation formula arises as a particular case of the 
Convolution Theorem on tempered distributions,
using the Dirac comb distribution and its Fourier series:

formula_36

In other words, the periodization of a Dirac delta formula_37 resulting in a Dirac comb, corresponds to the discretization of its spectrum which is constantly one.
Hence, this again is a Dirac comb but with reciprocal increments.

For the case formula_38 readily follows:

formula_39

Similarly:

formula_40

Or:

formula_41
The Poisson summation formula can also be proved quite conceptually using the compatibility of Pontryagin duality with short exact sequences such as
formula_42

==Applicability==

 holds provided formula_1 is a continuous integrable function which satisfies
formula_44
for some formula_45 and every formula_46 Note that such formula_1 is uniformly continuous, this together with the decay assumption on formula_4, show that the series defining formula_26 converges uniformly to a continuous function.   holds in the strong sense that both sides converge uniformly and absolutely to the same limit.

 holds in a pointwise sense under the strictly weaker assumption that formula_4 has bounded variation and
formula_51
The Fourier series on the right-hand side of is then understood as a (conditionally convergent) limit of symmetric partial sums.

As shown above, holds under the much less restrictive assumption that formula_1 is in formula_53, but then it is necessary to interpret it in the sense that the right-hand side is the (possibly divergent) Fourier series of formula_54 In this case, one may extend the region where equality holds by considering summability methods such as Cesàro summability. When interpreting convergence in this way , case formula_55 holds under the less restrictive conditions that formula_1 is integrable and 0 is a point of continuity of formula_24. However may fail to hold even when both formula_4 and formula_3 are integrable and continuous, and the sums converge absolutely.

==Applications==
===Method of images===
In partial differential equations, the Poisson summation formula provides a rigorous justification for the fundamental solution of the heat equation with absorbing rectangular boundary by the method of images. Here the heat kernel on formula_60 is known, and that of a rectangle is determined by taking the periodization. The Poisson summation formula similarly provides a connection between Fourier analysis on Euclidean spaces and on the tori of the corresponding dimensions. In one dimension, the resulting solution is called a theta function.

In electrodynamics, the method is also used to accelerate the computation of periodic Green&#x27;s functions. 

===Sampling===
In the statistical study of time-series, if formula_4 is a function of time, then looking only at its values at equally spaced points of time is called &quot;sampling.&quot; In applications, typically the function formula_4 is band-limited, meaning that there is some cutoff frequency formula_63 such that formula_64 is zero for frequencies exceeding the cutoff: formula_65 for formula_66 For band-limited functions, choosing the sampling rate formula_67 guarantees that no information is lost: since formula_3 can be reconstructed from these sampled values. Then, by Fourier inversion, so can formula_69 This leads to the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem.

===Ewald summation===
Computationally, the Poisson summation formula is useful since a slowly converging summation in real space is guaranteed to be converted into a quickly converging equivalent summation in Fourier space. (A broad function in real space becomes a narrow function in Fourier space and vice versa.) This is the essential idea behind Ewald summation.

===Approximations of integrals===
The Poisson summation formula is also useful to bound the errors obtained when an integral is approximated by a (Riemann) sum. Consider an approximation of formula_70 as formula_71, where formula_72 is the size of the bin. Then, according to this approximation coincides with formula_73. The error in the approximation can then be bounded as formula_74. This is particularly useful when the Fourier transform of formula_75 is rapidly decaying if formula_76.

===Lattice points inside a sphere===
The Poisson summation formula may be used to derive Landau&#x27;s asymptotic formula for the number of lattice points inside a large Euclidean sphere. It can also be used to show that if an integrable function, formula_4 and formula_3 both have compact support then formula_79

===Number theory===
In number theory, Poisson summation can also be used to derive a variety of functional equations including the functional equation for the Riemann zeta function.

One important such use of Poisson summation concerns theta functions: periodic summations of Gaussians . Put formula_80, for formula_81 a complex number in the upper half plane, and define the theta function:

formula_82

The relation between formula_83 and formula_84 turns out to be important for number theory, since this kind of relation is one of the defining properties of a modular form. By choosing formula_85 and using the fact that formula_86 one can conclude:

formula_87 by putting formula_88

It follows from this that formula_89 has a simple transformation property under formula_90 and this can be used to prove Jacobi&#x27;s formula for the number of different ways to express an integer as the sum of eight perfect squares.

===Sphere packings===
Cohn &amp; Elkies proved an upper bound on the density of sphere packings using the Poisson summation formula, which subsequently led to a proof of optimal sphere packings in dimension 8 and 24.

===Other===
* Let formula_91 for formula_92 and formula_93 for formula_94 to get formula_95
* It can be used to prove the functional equation for the theta function.
* Poisson&#x27;s summation formula appears in Ramanujan&#x27;s notebooks and can be used to prove some of his formulas, in particular it can be used to prove one of the formulas in Ramanujan&#x27;s first letter to Hardy.
* It can be used to calculate the quadratic Gauss sum.

==Generalizations==
The Poisson summation formula holds in Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension. Let formula_7 be the lattice in formula_97 consisting of points with integer coordinates. For a function formula_4 in formula_99, consider the series given by summing the translates of formula_4 by elements of formula_7:

formula_102

Theorem For formula_4 in formula_99, the above series converges pointwise almost everywhere, and defines a formula_7-periodic function on formula_97, hence a function formula_107 on the torus formula_108 a.e.  formula_109 lies in formula_110 with formula_111&lt;br&gt;
Moreover, for all formula_112 in formula_113  
:formula_114 
(the Fourier transform
of formula_109 on the torus formula_116) equals
:formula_117
(the Fourier transform of formula_4 on formula_97).

When formula_4 is in addition continuous, and both formula_4 and formula_3 decay sufficiently fast at infinity, then one can &quot;invert&quot; the Fourier series back to their domain formula_97 and make a stronger statement. More precisely, if

formula_124

for some &quot;C&quot;, &quot;δ&quot; &gt; 0, then
formula_125
where both series converge absolutely and uniformly on Λ. When &quot;d&quot; = 1 and &quot;x&quot; = 0, this gives above.

More generally, a version of the statement holds if Λ is replaced by a more general lattice in a finite dimensional vectorspace formula_126. Choose a translation invariant measure formula_127 on formula_126. It is unique up to positive scalar. Again for a function formula_129 we define the periodisation

:formula_130
as above. 

The &quot;dual lattice&quot; formula_15 is defined as a subset of the dual vector space formula_132 that evaluates to integers on the lattice formula_7 or alternatively, by Pontryagin duality, as the characters of formula_126 that contain formula_7 in the kernel.
Then the statement is that for all formula_136 the Fourier transform formula_137 of the periodisation formula_109 as a function on formula_139 and the Fourier transform formula_3 of formula_4 on formula_126 itself are related by proper normalisation 
:formula_143
Note that the right hand side is independent of the choice of invariant measure formula_144. 
If formula_145 and formula_146 are continuous and tend to zero faster than formula_147 then 
:formula_148
In particular 
:formula_149
This is applied in the theory of theta functions, and is a possible method in geometry of numbers. In fact in more recent work on counting lattice points in regions it is routinely used − summing the indicator function of a region &quot;D&quot; over lattice points is exactly the question, so that the LHS of the summation formula is what is sought and the RHS something that can be attacked by mathematical analysis.

===Selberg trace formula===

Further generalization to locally compact abelian groups is required in number theory. In non-commutative harmonic analysis, the idea is taken even further in the Selberg trace formula, but takes on a much deeper character.

A series of mathematicians applying harmonic analysis to number theory, most notably Martin Eichler, Atle Selberg, Robert Langlands, and James Arthur, have generalised the Poisson summation formula to the Fourier transform on non-commutative locally compact reductive algebraic groups formula_150 with a discrete subgroup formula_151 such that formula_152 has finite volume. For example, formula_150 can be the real points of formula_154 and formula_151 can be the integral points of formula_154. In this setting, formula_150 plays the role of the real number line in the classical version of Poisson summation, and formula_151 plays the role of the integers formula_159 that appear in the sum. The generalised version of Poisson summation is called the Selberg Trace Formula, and has played a role in proving many cases of Artin&#x27;s conjecture and in Wiles&#x27;s proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. The left-hand side of becomes a sum over irreducible unitary representations of formula_150, and is called &quot;the spectral side,&quot; while the right-hand side becomes a sum over conjugacy classes of formula_151, and is called &quot;the geometric side.&quot;

The Poisson summation formula is the archetype for vast developments in harmonic analysis and number theory.

===Semiclassical trace formula===
The Selberg trace formula was later generalized to more general smooth manifolds (without any algebraic structure) by Gutzwiller, Balian-Bloch, Chazarain, Colin de Verdière, Duistermaat-Guillemin, Uribe, Guillemin-Melrose, Zelditch and others. The &quot;wave trace&quot; or &quot;semiclassical trace&quot; formula relates geometric and spectral properties of the underlying topological space. The spectral side is the trace of a unitary group of operators (e.g., the Schrödinger or wave propagator) which encodes the spectrum of a differential operator and the geometric side is a sum of distributions which are supported at the lengths of periodic orbits of a corresponding Hamiltonian system. The Hamiltonian is given by the principal symbol of the differential operator which generates the unitary group. For the Laplacian, the &quot;wave trace&quot; has singular support contained in the set of lengths of periodic geodesics; this is called the Poisson relation.

===Convolution theorem===

The Poisson summation formula is a particular case of the convolution theorem on tempered distributions. If one of the two factors is the Dirac comb, one obtains periodic summation on one side and sampling on the other side of the equation. Applied to the Dirac delta function and its Fourier transform, the function that is constantly 1, this yields the Dirac comb identity.

<text>The Enets (, ; singular: , ; also known as Yenetses, Entsy, Entsi, Yenisei or Yenisey Samoyeds) are a Samoyedic ethnic group who live on the east bank, near the mouth, of the Yenisei River. Historically they were nomadic people. As of 2002, most enetses lived in the village of in Krasnoyarsk Krai in western Siberia near the Arctic Circle. According to the 2010 Census, there are 227 Enets in Russia. In Ukraine, there were 26 Entsi in 2001, of whom 18 were capable of speaking the Enets language.

The Enets language is a Samoyedic language, formerly known as Yenisei Samoyedic (not to be confused with the Yeniseian language family, which is completely unrelated). Older generation still speaks their language, but education is in Russian and very little of Enets language is taught and the language is almost unused in everyday life.

== Genetics ==
In a 2002 study, eight of the nine Enets samples belonged to the Y-DNA haplogroup N, which is typical among Uralic peoples. Seven of them had its subclade N1b-P43 and one belonged to the subclade N1c. Haplogroup R1b was found in one sample.

<doc id="502047" wikidata="Q6252491" url="?curid=502047" title="John Penn (governor)">
<text>John Penn (14 July 1729 – 9 February 1795) was an English-born colonial administrator who served as the last governor of colonial Pennsylvania, serving in that office from 1763 to 1771 and from 1773 to 1776. Educated in Britain and Switzerland, he was also one of the Penn family proprietors of the Province of Pennsylvania from 1771 until 1776, holding a one-fourth share, when the creation of the independent Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during the American Revolution removed the Penn family from power.

Held in exile in New Jersey after the British occupation of Philadelphia, Penn and his wife returned to Philadelphia in July 1778, following the British evacuation. After the American Revolutionary War, the unsold lands of the proprietorship were confiscated by the new state government, but it provided Penn and his cousin, John Penn, who held three-fourths of the proprietorship, with compensation. They both also appealed to British Parliament, which granted them additional compensation.

==Early life and education==
John Penn was born in London, the eldest son of Richard Penn and Hannah Lardner. His father Richard had inherited a one-fourth interest in the Pennsylvania proprietorship from his father, the Pennsylvania founder William Penn. It provided the family a fairly comfortable living. Richard&#x27;s older brother Thomas Penn controlled the other three-fourths of the proprietorship. As Thomas did not have any sons while John Penn was in his youth, the younger man was in line to inherit the entire proprietorship, one-fourth from his father and three-fourths from his paternal uncle. John Penn&#x27;s upbringing and conduct was of concern to the entire family.

===First marriage===
In 1747, when John Penn was eighteen years old and still in school, he secretly married Grace Cox, a daughter of Dr. James Cox of London. The Penn family disapproved of the marriage, believing that Cox had married Penn to share in the family fortune. For a while, John&#x27;s father refused to speak to him because of the marriage. Thomas Penn sponsored a trip for the younger Penn to Geneva to study and to get him away from his wife. Apparently regretting his marriage, Penn made no effort to contact Grace during this period. The Cox family sued Penn for support of Grace Penn in 1755, but after that there is no further mention of her in the Penn family records. How the marriage was dissolved is unknown, and they had no children.

==Immigration to Pennsylvania==
John Penn first traveled to Pennsylvania, then known as the Province of Pennsylvania and part of British America, in 1752, sent by his uncle Thomas to the province as a political apprentice to Governor James Hamilton. Penn served on the governor&#x27;s council, associating with important Penn family appointees such as Richard Peters and William Allen. In 1754, Penn attended the Albany Congress with Pennsylvania&#x27;s other delegates, including Peters, Benjamin Franklin, and Isaac Norris. But Penn was there primarily as an observer. The meeting was held by representatives of seven of the Thirteen Colonies to plan common defense against the French and Indians as the French and Indian War was beginning, with the Seven Years&#x27; War between Britain and France representing the North American front of that war.

From his home in England, the chief proprietor Thomas Penn soon became alarmed at John&#x27;s extravagant expenses. Peters reported John&#x27;s close association with an Italian musician, whose rent Penn paid and at whose home Penn stayed until two or three in the morning. The debauched musician was, in turn, &quot;constantly tagging after him.&quot; Thomas Penn summoned his nephew, John, back to England in late 1755.

==Governorship==

In 1763, Thomas Penn sent his nephew John Penn back to the Province of Pennsylvania to assume the governorship from Hamilton. The Penns were not displeased with Hamilton but believed that John was prepared to assume leadership in the province for the family. He took the oath of office as governor, officially &quot;lieutenant governor,&quot; on 31 October 1763 and served until 1771 in his first tenure. The new governor faced many challenges: Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion; the Paxton Boys; border disputes with other colonies; controversy over the taxation of Penn family lands; and the efforts of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly, led by Benjamin Franklin, to have the Penn proprietary government replaced with a royal government. Meanwhile, he was elected in 1768 to the American Philosophical Society, which Franklin had founded.

===Second marriage and family===
In 1766, Penn married Anne Allen, the daughter of William Allen and his wife, who were later Loyalists in Philadelphia. Penn reluctantly returned with his family to England in 1771 after his father&#x27;s death, where he took over his father&#x27;s position and affairs as one of the proprietors of Pennsylvania. His uncle Thomas Penn still held three fourths of the proprietorship but had a son, who was born in 1760. John&#x27;s brother, Richard Penn Jr., was appointed governor of the province in his place.

===Second appointment as governor===
As Thomas Penn was displeased with Richard Jr&#x27;s performance, he arranged in 1773 for the reappointment of John Penn as governor. Returning to the province with his family, Penn served until 1776. That year, the revolutionary government took control during the American Revolutionary War.

Thomas Penn had died in 1775, and his son John Penn &quot;of Stoke&quot; inherited the chief proprietorship and three quarters of the total property. John Penn &quot;of Stoke,&quot; born in 1760, was 15 when his father died. He was assigned a guardian for the proprietorship until he came of age, but the Revolution disrupted his control of the holdings.

==American Revolution==
The Penns were slow to perceive that the growing unrest, which became the American Revolution, would threaten their proprietary interests. In 1774, Penn refused to summon the Assembly so it could select delegates to the First Continental Congress. Patriots responded by taking control in 1775, leaving Penn powerless. Henry J. Cadbury states, &quot;The end of proprietary government in Pennsylvania may be dated Sept. 26, 1776, with the last adjournment of the provincial assembly. The governor&#x27;s acts and meetings of the council closed nearly a year earlier.&quot; 

After the American Revolutionary War was launched at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Penn watched with apprehension as Pennsylvania colonists formed patriot militias and prepared for war. Soon after the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, patriots, also known as Whigs, in Pennsylvania created the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, which replaced Penn&#x27;s government with a Supreme Executive Council and no royal officials. With no power at his command, Penn remained aloof and carefully neutral in the hope that the radicals would be defeated or at least reconciled with the king.

The war soon began to go badly for the Patriots. In August 1777, as General William Howe began his Philadelphia Campaign, Patriot soldiers arrived at Penn&#x27;s Lansdowne estate near Philadelphia. They demanded him to sign a parole that stated that he would do nothing to harm the revolutionary cause. Penn refused and was taken to Philadelphia, where he was kept under house arrest. As Howe&#x27;s army drew close, the Patriots threatened Penn with exile to another colony, and he then signed the parole. With Howe near Philadelphia, Patriot leaders exiled Penn to an Allen family estate in New Jersey called &quot;The Union,&quot; also known as Solitude House, about from Philadelphia in present-day High Bridge, New Jersey.

Anne Penn initially stayed in Philadelphia to look after family affairs while British forces occupied Philadelphia but later joined her husband in New Jersey.

After the British evacuated Philadelphia in 1778, the Penns returned to the city in July of that year. The new government of Pennsylvania required all residents to take a loyalty oath to the Commonwealth or to face confiscation of their property. With the consent of his family, he took the oath. While that protected Penn&#x27;s private lands and manors, the Pennsylvania Assembly passed the Divestment Act of 1779, which confiscated about of unsold lands held by the proprietorship and abolished the practice of paying quitrents for new purchases. As compensation, John Penn and his cousin were paid £130,000, but that was a fraction of what the lands were worth but was a surprisingly large sum, as in some areas, Loyalist properties were taken without any compensation. Penn retired to Lansdowne and waited out the final years of the war, which ended in 1781.

==Later life==
For several years after the war, Penn and his cousin, John Penn &quot;of Stoke&quot;, who had inherited three fourths of the proprietorship and received that portion of the settlement, lobbied the Pennsylvania government for greater compensation for their confiscated property. John Penn &quot;of Stoke&quot; lived in Pennsylvania from 1783 to 1788. Failing there, they traveled to England in 1789 to seek compensation from Parliament, which awarded the Penn cousins a total of £4,000 per year (equal to £ today) in perpetuity. Penn &quot;of Stoke&quot; stayed in England for the rest of his life, serving as a member of parliament in the early 1800s.

Returning to Pennsylvania, John Penn lived the rest of his life with his family quietly in Lansdowne. After his 1795 death, Penn was buried under the floor of Christ Church in Philadelphia, the only proprietor to be buried in Pennsylvania. Some older accounts state that his remains were eventually taken back to England, but there are no records of that.

<text>The Battle of Gonzales was the first military engagement of the Texas Revolution. It was fought near Gonzales, Texas, on October 2, 1835, between rebellious Texian settlers and a detachment of Mexican army soldiers.

In 1831, Green DeWitt asked the Mexican authorities to lend the Gonzales colonists a cannon to help protect them from frequent Comanche raids. One was supplied, on the condition that the cannon would be returned to the Mexicans on request. Over the next four years, the political situation in Mexico deteriorated, and in 1835 several states revolted. As the unrest spread, Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea, the commander of all Mexican troops in Texas, felt it unwise to leave the residents of Gonzales with a weapon and requested the return of the cannon.

When the initial request was refused, Ugartechea sent 100 dragoons to retrieve the cannon. The soldiers neared Gonzales on September 29, but the colonists used a variety of excuses to keep them from the town, while secretly sending messengers to request assistance from nearby communities. Within two days, up to 140 Texians gathered in Gonzales, all determined not to give up the cannon. On October 1, settlers voted to initiate a fight. Mexican soldiers opened fire as Texians approached their camp in the early hours of October 2. After several hours of desultory firing, the Mexican soldiers withdrew.

Although the skirmish had little military significance, it marked a clear break between the colonists and the Mexican government and is considered to have been the start of the Texas Revolution. News of the skirmish spread throughout the United States, where it was often referred to as the &quot;Lexington of Texas&quot;. 

Two cannons were used by the Texians in the fighting, the bronze six-pounder under dispute and a smaller Spanish &quot;esmeril&quot; made of iron, its caliber being a one pounder or less.

The cannon&#x27;s fate is disputed. It may have been buried and rediscovered in 1936, or it may have been seized by Mexican troops after the Battle of the Alamo. A bronze six-pounder was noted as one of twenty-one large guns captured and buried by the Mexicans at the Alamo, dug up in 1852 and sent to New York in 1874 to be cast into a bell that hangs in St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in San Antonio; while a smaller iron gun was abandoned in a creek and uncovered by a flood in 1936, on show in the Gonzales Memorial Museum .

==Background==
The Mexican Constitution of 1824 liberalized the country&#x27;s immigration policies, allowing foreign immigrants to settle in border regions such as Mexican Texas, and to bring their slaves with them. In 1825, American Green DeWitt received permission to settle 400 families in Texas near the confluence of the San Marcos and Guadalupe Rivers. The DeWitt Colony quickly became a favorite raiding target of local Karankawa, Tonkawa, and Comanche tribes, and in July 1826 they destroyed the capital city, Gonzales. The town was rebuilt the following year, after DeWitt negotiated peace treaties with the Karankawa and Tonkawa. The Comanche continued to stage periodic raids of the settlement over the next few years. Unable to spare military troops to protect the town, in 1831 the region&#x27;s political chief instead sent the settlers of Gonzales a six-pounder cannon, Historian Thomas Ricks Lindley states that Green DeWitt wrote to the Mexican authorities asking for a cannon, and they responded with the loan of a Spanish six-pounder bronze cannon on the condition it be returned when asked for; Lindley states that the Texians also had a much smaller iron cannon of one pounder calibre or less. Writer Timothy Todish described the six pounder as &quot;a small bored gun, good for little more than starting horse races&quot;, despite it being a gun of around calibre firing projectiles.

In 1829, Mexico ended slavery and freed the slaves throughout Mexico, but negotiated an exception for the American immigrants in Tejas. In April of 1830, Mexico closed its borders to new immigrants who had not already been authorized to join an existing colony. During the 1830s, the Mexican government wavered between federalist and centralist policies. As the pendulum swung sharply towards centralism in 1835, several Mexican states revolted. In June, a small group of settlers in Texas used the political unrest as an excuse to rebel against customs duties, in an incident known as the Anahuac Disturbances. The federal government responded by sending more troops to Texas.

Public opinion was sharply divided. Some communities supported the rebellion for a variety of reasons. The new policies, the bans of slavery and immigration chief among them, and the increased enforcement of laws and import tariffs, incited many immigrants to revolt. The border region of Mexican Texas was largely populated by immigrants from the United States, some legal but most illegal. Some of these immigrants brought large numbers of slaves with them, so that by 1836, there were about 5,000 enslaved persons in a total non-native population estimated at 38,470. Others, including Gonzales, declared their loyalty to Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna&#x27;s centralist government. Local leaders began calling for a Consultation to determine whether a majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step toward revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15. In the interim, many communities formed Texian Militia companies to protect themselves from a potential attack by military forces.

On September 10, a Mexican soldier bludgeoned a Gonzales resident, which led to widespread outrage and public protests. Mexican authorities felt it unwise to leave the settlers with a weapon. Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea, commander of all Mexican troops in Texas, sent a corporal and five enlisted men to retrieve the cannon that had been loaned to the colonists. Many of the settlers believed Mexican authorities were manufacturing an excuse to attack the town and eliminate the militia. In a town meeting, three citizens voted to hand over the gun to forestall an attack; the remainder, including &quot;alcalde&quot; Andrew Ponton, voted to stand their ground. According to historian Stephen Hardin, &quot;the cannon became a point of honor and an unlikely rallying symbol. Gonzales citizens had no intention of handing over the weapon at a time of growing tension.&quot; The soldiers were escorted from town without the cannon.

=== Old Eighteen ===
&quot;Old Eighteen&quot; refers to the 18 Texians who delayed Mexican attempts to reclaim the Gonzales cannon until Texian Militia arrived, which instigated the ensuing battle. The phrase is a pastiche of &quot;Old Three Hundred&quot;. They are:

# William W. Arrington
#Simeon Bateman
# Valentine Bennet
# Joseph D. Clements
#Almon Cottle (brother of an Immortal 32)
# Jacob C. Darst (also Immortal 32)
# George W. Davis
#Almaron Dickinson 
#Graves Fulchear
# Benjamin Fuqua
#James Hinds
# Thomas Jackson (also Immortal 32)
#Albert Martin (also Immortal 32)
# Charles Mason
# Thomas R. Miller (also Immortal 32)
# John Sowell
# Winslow Turner
# Ezekiel Williams

==Prelude==
Ponton anticipated that Ugartechea would send more troops to force the return of the loaned cannon. As soon as the first group of soldiers left Gonzales, Ponton sent a messenger to the closest town, Mina, to request help. Word quickly spread that up to 300 soldiers were expected to march on Gonzales. Stephen F. Austin, one of the most respected men in Texas and the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the settlers, sent messengers to inform surrounding communities of the situation. Austin cautioned Texians to remain on the defensive, as any unprovoked attacks against Mexican forces could limit the support Texians might receive from the United States if war officially began.

On September 27, 1835, a detachment of 100 dragoons of the Segunda Compañía Volante de San Carlos de Álamo de Parras, led by lieutenant Francisco de Castañeda, left San Antonio de Béxar, carrying an official order for Ponton to return the cannon. Castañeda had been instructed to avoid using force if possible. When the troops neared Gonzales on September 29, they found that the settlers had removed the ferry and all other boats from the Guadalupe River. On the other side of the swiftly moving river waited eighteen Texians. Albert Martin, captain of the Gonzales Texian Militia company, informed the soldiers that Ponton was out of town, and until his return the army must remain on the west side of the river.

With no easy way to cross the river, Castañeda and his men made camp at the highest ground in the area, about from the river. Three Texians hurried to bury the cannon, while others traveled to nearby communities to ask for assistance. By the end of the day, more than 80 men had arrived from Fayette and Columbus. Texian Militia companies generally elected their own leaders, and the men now gathered in Gonzales invoked their right to choose their own captain rather than report to Martin. John Henry Moore of Fayette was elected leader, with Joseph Washington Elliot Wallace and Edward Burleson, both of Columbus, respectively elected second and third in command.

On September 30, Castañeda reiterated his request for the cannon and was again rebuffed. Texians insisted on discussing the matter directly with Ugartechea. According to their spokesman, until this was possible &quot;the only answer I can therefore give you is that I cannot now [and] will not deliver to you the cannon&quot;. Castañeda reported to Ugartechea that the Texians were stalling, likely to give reinforcements time to gather.

In San Antonio de Béxar, Ugartechea asked Dr. Launcelot Smither, a Gonzales resident in town on personal business, to help Castañeda convince the settlers to follow orders. When Smither arrived on October 1, he met with militia captain Mathew Caldwell to explain that the soldiers meant no harm if the settlers would peacefully return the cannon. Caldwell instructed Smither to bring Castañeda to the town the following morning to discuss the matter. At roughly the same time, Moore called a war council, which quickly voted to initiate a fight. It is unclear whether the war council was aware that Caldwell had promised Castañeda safe passage to Gonzales the next morning.

Texians dug up the cannon and mounted it on cart wheels. In the absence of cannonballs, they gathered metal scraps to fill the cannon. James C. Neill, who had served in an artillery company during the War of 1812, was given command of the cannon. He gathered several men, including Almaron Dickinson, also a former US Army field artilleryman, together to form the first artillery company of Texians. A local Methodist minister, W. P. Smith, blessed their activities in a sermon which made frequent reference to the American Revolution.

As the Texians made plans for an attack, Castañeda learned from a Coushatta Indian that about 140 men were gathered in Gonzales, with more expected. The Mexican soldiers began searching for a safe place to cross the river. At nightfall on October 1 they stopped to make camp, upriver from their previous spot.

==Battle==

Texians began crossing the river at about 7 pm. Less than half of the men were mounted, slowing their progress as they tracked the Mexican soldiers. A thick fog rolled in around midnight, further delaying them. At around 3am, Texians reached the new Mexican camp. A dog barked at their approach, alerting the Mexican soldiers, who began to fire. The noise caused one of the Texian horses to panic and throw his rider, who suffered a bloody nose. Moore and his men hid in the thick trees until dawn. As they waited, some of the Texians raided a nearby field and snacked on watermelon.

With the darkness and fog, Mexican soldiers could not estimate how many men had surrounded them. They withdrew to a nearby bluff. At about 6 am, Texians emerged from the trees and began firing at the Mexican soldiers. Lieutenant Gregorio Pérez counterattacked with 40 mounted soldiers. The Texians fell back to the trees and fired a volley, injuring a Mexican private. According to some accounts, the cannon fell out of the wagon upon the shot. Unable to safely maneuver among the trees, the Mexican horsemen returned to the bluff.

As the fog lifted, Castañeda sent Smither to request a meeting between the two commanders. Smither was promptly arrested by the Texians, who were suspicious of his presence among the Mexican soldiers. Nevertheless, Moore agreed to meet Castañeda. Moore explained that his followers no longer recognized the centralist government of Santa Anna and instead remained faithful to the constitution of 1824, which Santa Anna had repudiated. Castañeda revealed that he shared their federalist leanings, but that he was honor-bound to follow orders.

As Moore returned to camp, the Texians raised a homemade white banner with an image of the cannon painted in black in the center, over the words &quot;Come and Take It&quot;. The makeshift flag, lost later the same year, evoked the American Revolutionary-era slogan &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot;. Texians then fired their cannon at the Mexican camp. Realizing that he was outnumbered and outgunned, Castañeda led his troops back to San Antonio de Béxar. The troops were gone before the Texians finished reloading. In his report to Ugartechea, Castañeda wrote &quot;since the orders from your Lordship were for me to withdraw without compromising the honor of Mexican arms, I did so&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Two Mexican soldiers were killed in the attack. The only Texian casualty was the bloody nose suffered by the man bucked off his horse. Although the event was, as characterized by Davis, &quot;an inconsequential skirmish in which one side did not try to fight&quot;, Texians soon declared it a victory over Mexican troops. Despite its minimal military impact, Hardin asserts that the skirmish&#x27;s &quot;political significance was immeasurable&quot;. A large number of Texians had taken an armed stand against the Mexican army, and they had no intention of returning to their neutral stance towards Santa Anna&#x27;s government. Two days after the battle, Austin wrote to the San Felipe de Austin Committee of Public Safety, &quot;War is declared—public opinion has proclaimed it against a Military despotism—The campaign has commenced&quot;. News of the skirmish, originally called &quot;the fight at Williams&#x27; place&quot;, spread throughout the United States, encouraging many adventurers to come to Texas and assist in the fight against Mexico. Newspapers referred to the conflict as the &quot;Lexington of Texas&quot;; as the Battles of Lexington and Concord began the American Revolution, the Gonzales skirmish launched the Texas Revolution.

Before fighting had officially erupted, Santa Anna had realized that stronger measures were needed to ensure calm in Texas. He ordered his brother-in-law, General Martín Perfecto de Cos to bring approximately 500 soldiers to Texas. Cos and his men arrived in Goliad on October 2. Three days later, after learning of the events at Gonzales, the soldiers left for San Antonio de Béxar.

Gonzales became a rallying point for Texians opposed to Santa Anna&#x27;s policies. On October 11, they unanimously elected Austin their commander, despite his lack of military training. The following day, Austin led the men on a march towards San Antonio de Béxar to lay siege to Cos&#x27;s troops. By the end of the year, the Texians had driven all Mexican troops from Texas.

The cannon&#x27;s fate is disputed. According to the memoirs (written in the 1890s) of Gonzales blacksmith Noah Smithwick, the cannon was abandoned after the cart&#x27;s axles began to smoke during a march to San Antonio de Béxar to assist in Austin&#x27;s siege. Smithwick reported that the cannon was buried near a creek not far from Gonzales. A small iron cannon was exposed during a June 1936 flood near Gonzales. In 1979, this cannon was purchased by Dr. Patrick Wagner, who believed it matched Smithwick&#x27;s descriptions of the cannon used in the battle. The Curator of Military History at the Smithsonian Institution verified that Wagner&#x27;s cannon was a type of small swivel gun used in America through 1836. The Conservation Laboratory at the University of Texas confirmed that Wagner&#x27;s cannon had been buried in moist ground for an extended time period.

Writing in the &quot;Handbook of Texas&quot;, historian Thomas Ricks Lindley maintains that the Wagner cannon does not match the Smithwick account. The Wagner gun is made of iron and is smaller than a six-pounder. Lindley states that Francisco de Castañeda reported two cannons being used by the Texians in the battle, the large bronze cannon lent by the Mexicans and a much smaller iron cannon, two other Mexican accounts also recording both cannons in Gonzales.

Historians such as Lindley think it likely that the bronze six-pounder cannon which caused the dispute was taken to San Antonio de Béxar, where it was used during the Battle of the Alamo and captured by Mexican troops in March 1836. Lindley states that the bronze cannon was dug up in 1852 and in 1874 its metal was recast into a bell which hangs in St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in San Antonio; while the Texian&#x27;s small iron cannon was abandoned at Sandies Creek, uncovered by a flood in 1936, and is displayed in the Gonzales Memorial Museum as the &quot;Come and Take It&quot; cannon.

The battle is re-enacted during the Come and Take It celebration in Gonzales every October. In and around Gonzales are nine Texas historical markers which commemorate various locations used in the prelude to the battle.

<text>Roberto Carlos Braga (; born 19 April 1941) is a Brazilian singer-songwriter, also known as &quot;King of Latin Music&quot; or simply &quot;the King&quot;. Most of his songs were written in partnership with his friend Erasmo Carlos (no relation). Roberto Carlos has sold over 70 million albums around the world. He is considered one of the most influential artists in Brazil, being cited as a source of inspiration by many artists and bands. His net worth is estimated at US$160 million.

== Early life==
Roberto Carlos Braga was born in Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, at the southern part of the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo. He is the fourth and last son of watchmaker Robertino Braga (March 27, 1896 – January 27, 1980) and seamstress Laura Moreira Braga (10 April 1914 – 17 April 2010). The family lived in a modest home on top of a hill in the Nook neighbourhood. His siblings were Lauro Roberto Braga, Carlos Alberto Moreira Braga and Norminha. At age six, during the feast of St Peter, the patron saint of Cachoeiro do Itapemirim, Roberto Carlos was hit by a steam locomotive and had to have his right leg amputated just below his knee. He still uses a prosthesis, but avoids talking about it.

As a child he learned to play the guitar and the piano – first with his mother and later at the Itapemirim Music Conservatory. At 9 years old, he performed for the first time at a children&#x27;s show broadcast by Rádio Cachoeiro (he sang a bolero called &quot;Mal Amor&quot;). He won candies as the first prize. Years later, he recalled the occasion for the book &quot;Roberto Carlos Up Close&quot;, by Paulo Cesar de Araujo: &quot;I was very nervous, yet very happy to be able to sing on the radio. I got a lot of candies, which was the prize for the kids who&#x27;d sing there. It was a beautiful day.&quot; He became a regular performer on that particular show.

==Career==
===1960s===

Influenced by his idol Elvis Presley and the 1950s rock revolution, he rose to stardom as the main figure of the 1950s and 1960s musical movement known as Jovem Guarda (or &quot;Young Guard&quot;), which was a rip off from another TV Show. From the same name &quot;Jovem Guarda&quot; was the first manifestation of the Brazilian pop rock movement. Since then, Roberto Carlos has been called &quot;O Rei&quot; (the King).

When his first single and first LP (&quot;Louco por você&quot;, 1961) were commercial failures, Roberto Carlos was in danger of being fired from CBS in favor of , the first successful rock singer in Brazil. Nevertheless, Murilo was fired instead for clashing with musical director Evandro Ribeiro over repertoire and payment, opening up space for Roberto Carlos. During his first decade of recording, Roberto Carlos also starred in a few motion pictures directed by Roberto Farias, many of them inspired by the Beatles movies.

Jovem Guarda

Roberto Carlos insisted on investing time in young music, rock, and in 1962 released &quot;Splish Splash&quot;. With his friend Erasmo Carlos, Roberto recorded Portuguese versions of pop songs and wrote his own songs, such as &quot;Parei Na Contramão&quot; which became a hit. The following year the singer was back on the charts with the album &quot;É Proibido Fumar&quot;, in which, besides the title track, the highlight was the song &quot;O Calhambeque&quot;. Thus was born the &quot;Jovem Guarda&quot; (TV Show).

Nationally known, Roberto Carlos began to host the Jovem Guarda TV program in 1965 at TV Record, along with Erasmo Carlos and Wanderléa. The program further popularized the pop rock movement in Brazil and established the singer, who became one of the first idols of the young Brazilian culture. Also in 1965, the albums &quot;Roberto Carlos Canta Para A Juventude&quot; – with hits &quot;A Estoria do Homem Mau (Old Man Moses),&quot; &quot;Os Sete Cabeludos&quot;, &quot;Eu Sou Fã Do Monoquini&quot; and &quot;Eu Não Quero Ver Você Triste&quot; partnerships with Erasmo Carlos –and &quot;Jovem Guarda&quot; with the hits &quot;Quero Que Vá Tudo Pro Inferno&quot;, &quot;Lobo Mau&quot;, &quot;O Feio&quot; (Getúlio Cortes) and &quot;Não É Papo Pra Mim&quot; were released.

In 1966, Carlos presented the programs &quot;Roberto Carlos à Noite&quot;, &quot;Opus 7&quot;, &quot;Jovem Guarda em Alta Tensão&quot; e &quot;Todos os Jovens do Mundo&quot;, at TV Record, all of them short-lived. That year would be marked by a fight that nearly ended the partnership between him and Erasmo. The reason for the split was a failure of production of the &quot;Show in Si Monal ...&quot; TV Record, which paid homage to Erasmo. The production was to present a pot-pourri of Erasmo&#x27;s most famous compositions, including &quot;Parei na Contramão&quot; and &quot;Quero Que Vá Tudo Pro Inferno&quot;. The controversy was created because of these songs were composed in partnership with Roberto Carlos, but the credits were given only to Erasmo. The two quarreled, and the partnership was suspended for more than one year. During this period, Roberto wrote &quot;We There Yet?&quot; and &quot;Namoradinha de Um Amigo Meu&quot; were released on the LP &quot;Roberto Carlos&quot; that year (the album still had the hits &quot;Eu Te Darei O Céu&quot;, &quot;Esqueça&quot;, &quot;Negro Gato&quot; (Getúlio Cortes) and &quot;Nossa Canção&quot; (Luiz Ayrão).

In 1967, the friendship between Roberto and Erasmo was shaken, though the two still presented – along with Wanderléa – the &quot;Jovem Guarda&quot; show on TV Record. Roberto wrote his own hits like &quot;Como É Grande Meu Amor Por Você&quot;, &quot;Corro Demais&quot;, &quot;Quando&quot; and &quot;De vale tudo isso?&quot;, which would be released on the LP &quot;Roberto Carlos em Ritmo de Aventura&quot; soundtrack of movie with the same name, released the following year. The film was produced and directed by Roberto Farias and featured Roberto Carlos as protagonist, with José Lewgoy and Reginaldo Faria in the cast. The film became a box office success in the Brazilian cinema. With his many professional commitments, Roberto could not finish the lyrics for &quot;Eu Sou Terrível&quot;, which was to be the starting soundtrack of the feature. He asked his former partner Erasmo Carlos, who helped finalize the lyrics. Thus, friendship and partnership between the two resumed. Later that year, Roberto Carlos had his first performances abroad, in Cannes (France) and participated in several Brazilian Pop Music festivals. He placed fifth with the song &quot;Maria Carnaval e Cinzas&quot; (Luís Carlos Paraná). Some people objected to the presence of a Jovem Guarda icon.

In 1968 the LP &quot;O Inimitável&quot; was released. A transition record in the singer&#x27;s career, the album had influences in U.S. black music (soul / funk) and scored several hits, like &quot;Se Você Pensa&quot;, &quot;Eu Te Amo, Te Amo, Te Amo&quot;, &quot;É Meu É Meu É Meu&quot;, &quot;As Canções que você Fez Pra Mim&quot; (all partnerships with Erasmo Carlos), &quot;Ciúmes De Você&quot; (Luiz Ayrão), and &quot;Eu Não Vou Deixar Você Tão Só&quot; (Marcos Antonio). Later that year, Roberto Carlos became the first and only Brazilian to win the Festival of San Remo (Italy), with the song &quot;Canzone Per Te&quot;, Sergio Endrigo and Sergio Bardotti. The singer would change his style in 1969 and also stopped naming his albums. The album &quot;Roberto Carlos&quot; was marked by a greater romanticism instead of the traditional themes typical of the Jovem Guarda youth. Among the successes of this LP are &quot;As Curvas da Estrada De Santos&quot;, &quot;Sua Estupidez&quot; and &quot;As Flores do Jardim de Nossa Casa&quot;, all partnerships with Erasmo Carlos. Later that year, he starred in &quot;Roberto Carlos e o Diamante Cor-de-rosa&quot;, the second film directed by Roberto Farias and new success at the box office.

===1970s and 1980s===

 The 1970 decade was marked by the end of the Jovem Guarda and the bolstering the prestige of Roberto Carlos as a romantic artist in Brazil and abroad (USA, Europe and Latin America). The singer became the artist who would sell the most albums in the country. Several of his songs were recorded by other artists such as Julio Iglesias, Caravelli and Ray Conniff. In 1970, the singer made a successful series of shows in Canecão. Later that year, he launched his annual album, which brought such hits as &quot;Ana&quot;, &quot;Veste A Roupa Meu Bem&quot; and &quot;Jesus Cristo&quot;, a song which also marked his approach to religion.

The following year, &quot;Roberto Carlos a 300 km Por Hora&quot;, the last movie starring the singer, was released also a great national success. Also in 1971, another album was released, featuring the hits &quot;Detalhes,&quot; &quot;Amada Amante&quot;, &quot;Todos Estão Surdos&quot;, &quot;Debaixo dos Caracóis dos Seus Cabelos&quot; (homage to Caetano Veloso) and &quot;Como Dois E Dois&quot; (Caetano). The 1972 album resonated with &quot;A Montanha&quot;, &quot;Como Vai Você&quot;, and &quot;Quando As Crianças Saírem de Férias&quot; in addition to being the first LP to reach the milestone of one million copies sold, and in 1973, with &quot;Rotina&quot; and &quot;Proposta&quot;. On December 24, 1974, TV Globo aired a special show with singer, which got huge ratings. From that year, the program would be aired at the end of each year. That same year, he released another album, with hits like &quot;O Portão&quot; and &quot;Eu Quero Apenas&quot;.

The 1975 album had a hit with &quot;Além do Horizonte&quot; and a remake of his 1965 song &quot;Quero Que Vai Tudo Pro Inferno&quot;. The following year the singer would record the new LP in the CBS Studios in New York. The album spawned the songs &quot;Ilegal, Imoral e Engorda&quot; and &quot;Os Seus Botões&quot;.&quot; In 1977, Roberto Carlos released his annual album, with hits like &quot;Amigo&quot; (an homage to Erasmo Carlos), &quot;Muito Romântico&quot; (Caetano Veloso) and &quot;Cavalgada&quot; and reached #1 on the charts. The following year, another annual album was released, which featured the songs &quot;Café da Manhã&quot;, &quot;Força Estranha&quot; (Caetano Veloso) and &quot;Lady Laura&quot; – a song dedicated to his mother. The album sold 1,500,000 copies. In addition to albums that sold more than 1 million copies a year, Roberto Carlos&#x27;s shows were also popular; in 1978, the singer toured the country for six months, always with packed houses. When Pope John Paul II visited Mexico in 1979, he was greeted with the song &quot;Amigo&quot;, sung by a choir of children. The event was broadcast live to hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Roberto also engaged in support of the UN International Year of the Child.

In the early 1980s, he took part in another campaign, this time for the International Year of the Disabled. In 1981, the singer made international tours and recorded the first album in English – others would be released in Spanish, Italian and French. He also recorded the annual album, which featured hits like &quot;Emoções&quot;, &quot;Cama e Mesa&quot; and &quot;As Baleias&quot;. In 1982, Maria Bethânia participated in the yearly album, the duet &quot;Amiga.&quot; It was the first time the singer invited another artist to participate in the recordings on the disc. &quot;Roberto Carlos&quot; (1982) also had the hit song &quot;Fera Ferida&quot;, another collaboration with Erasmo.

After his first decade of success, Roberto Carlos moved towards a more serious, adult-oriented approach to singing, whilst consistently continuing to score hits in his country and throughout Latin America, as well as in Portugal, Spain and Italy. In the 1980s, Roberto Carlos also began recording in English and French (he had already recorded albums in Spanish, Italian, and, naturally, Portuguese). He went on to win the &quot;Globo de Cristal&quot; trophy, awarded by CBS to Brazilian artists who sell more than five million copies outside Brazil. At the same time, his albums continued to break records in his country. &quot;Caminhoneiro&quot; (1984) aired 3,000 times in a single day, soon topped by his own &quot;Verde e Amarelo&quot; (1985), with 3,500 airings. In 1985 he participated in the campaign to help children in Latin America, in the song Cantarê, cantarás, he performed with Julio Iglesias, Gloria Estefan, Jose Feliciano, Plácido Domingo, Cheech Marin and Menudo, among others. He won the 1988 Grammy for Best Latin American Singer and the following year he reached the top of Billboard&#x27;s Latin charts. Also in 1989, he had a hit with the song &quot;Amazonia&quot;. In the traditional year-end special Rede Globo he sang hits like &quot;Outra Vez&quot; alongside Simone.

In 1986, Roberto Carlos performed at Radio City Music Hall in New York and two years later became one of the only Brazilians ever to win a Grammy Award in the category of Best Latin Pop Album with &quot;Roberto Carlos / Tolo&quot;. In 1998, due to the illness of his wife Maria Rita, Roberto Carlos had to reconcile the disc recording and support for his wife hospitalized in São Paulo. His yearly record, that almost was not released, had only four new songs, including &quot;O Baile da Fazenda&quot;, a partnership with Erasmo Carlos and was attended special Dominguinhos. In 1999, the worsening state of health of Maria Rita, followed by her death in December of that year, made the singer failed to make the traditional end of year special on Rede Globo and to record a new album. The record company Sony has just launched &quot;The 30 Greatest Hits (Vol. 1 and 2)&quot;, paired with a collection of greatest hits and a new song, the religious &quot;Todas As Nossas Senhoras&quot;, written with Erasmo.

===1990s and 2000s===
Carlos continued to record through the 1990s, focusing on romantic songs. In the mid-1990s a retro-Jovem Guarda wave hit Brazil, and Carlos—who was considered a has-been amongst a younger generation familiar only with his romantic and sentimental hits directed at a middleaged audience—had his importance cited by younger musicians such as Cássia Eller, Adriana Calcanhotto, Chico Science e Nação Zumbi, Barão Vermelho and Skank. Skank also recorded &quot;Rei&quot;, a tribute to Roberto Carlos with his classic hits from the heyday of the Jovem Guarda epoch.

In 1992 he left his name on the Latin artist Walk of Fame in Miami in the United States. In 1994, Roberto Carlos managed to beat the Beatles&#x27; sales in Latin America, selling over 70 million records. In 1996, Roberto Carlos scored another success in partnership with Erasmo Carlos, &quot;Mulher de 40&quot;, and recorded along with Julio Iglesias, Gloria Estefan, Plácido Domingo, Ricky Martin, Jon Secada among others, the song in Spanish, &quot;Puedes Llegar&quot;, the theme of the Atlanta Olympics in the United States. In 1997, he launched the Spanish-language album &quot;Canciones Que Amo.&quot;

In 1998, Carlos&#x27;s second wife, Maria Rita, discovered she had cancer (she would die in 1999). After a one-year break, Roberto Carlos returned to recording and performing. In 2001, he broke his contract with Sony (formerly CBS), the recording company through which he had released a vast majority of his albums, due to reasons connected to his wife&#x27;s death. However, in a 2008 interview, Roberto Carlos stated that he had no intention of retiring from the music industry anytime soon and released an album later that year. In 2004, Carlos was awarded the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was later recognized as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year in 2015.

In December 2006, &quot;Duetos&quot; a CD with 14 tracks and a DVD with 16 numbers was released, which had taken of the special moments recorded for the Globo since the 1970s. Later that year Roberto Carlos won the Latin Grammy for best romantic music album (album &quot;Roberto Carlos&quot;, 2005). In the same period, the publisher Planeta launched the book &quot;Roberto Carlos em Detalhes&quot;, by Paulo Cesar de Araujo, an unauthorized biography about the singer, a result of 16 years of research and with testimonies of about 200 people who participated in the career of Roberto. Roberto Carlos repudiated the publication, claiming that there is untruth in it, and announced his intention to withdraw the work from circulation. The court ruled for Roberto Carlos and the book &quot;Roberto Carlos em Detalhes&quot; was pulled from stores at the end of February 2007. On 27 April 2007, after a long hearing at the Criminal Forum of Barra Funda, São Paulo, all copies of the book were recalled.

In January 2007, the singer travelled to Spain, where he recorded his first album in Spanish in a decade. In June, he performed at Canecão. In addition to special appearances by singers Gilberto Gil, Zeca Pagodinho, and journalists Nelson Motta and Leda Nagle and established actors and actresses, the show&#x27;s repertoire included the entirety of &quot;É Preciso Saber Viver&quot;, a song whose verse &quot;se o bem e o mal existem&quot; (If there are good and evil) the singer had long refused to sing long before, due to OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder).

Every year, Roberto Carlos hosts a special TV show singing his greatest hits along with special guests. The show has become a tradition in Brazilian television. The house where Carlos was born has also been converted into a museum dedicated to him.

In 2008, Roberto Carlos and Caetano Veloso did a show together in tribute to Antonio Carlos Jobim, which was recorded on CD and DVD &quot;Roberto Carlos, Caetano Veloso and Tom Jobim&#x27;s music&quot;. Jaques Morelenbaum, Daniel Jobim and Wanderlea participated in this show. In 2009, he began a tour celebrating 50 years of his career, and his first concert was on April 19 in Itapemirim, his hometown, the day he turned 68 years old. In April, the show &quot;They sing Roberto – DIVAS&quot;, at the Municipal Theater of São Paulo, was attended by the great singers of national music, such Adriana Calcanhotto, Alcione, Ana Carolina, Claudia Leitte, Daniela Mercury, Fafa de Belém, Fernanda Abreu, Ivete Sangalo, Luiza Possi, Marina Lima, Mart&#x27;nália, Nana Caymmi, Paula Toller, , Sandy, Wanderlea and Zizi Possi. The television host Hebe Camargo and the actress Marilia Pera also participated in the show. Roberto Carlos was considered by the &quot;Journal Times&quot; one of the 100 most influential Brazilians of 2009.

===2010s to present===
His mother Laura Moreira Braga died on 17 April 2010, at age 96. The news of her death was given minutes after a Roberto Carlos&#x27;s concert at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Through the 2010s, Roberto Carlos continued his yearly cruise ship concert project, &quot;Emoções em Alto Mar&quot; (&quot;Emotions in the High Seas&quot;). In the second half of 2011, the singer also held a concert in the city of Jerusalem, titled &quot;Emoções em Jerusalem&quot;.

Roberto Carlos was paid homage by the Beija-Flor samba school in the 2011 Carnival parade.

In 2013, &quot;Esse Cara Sou Eu&quot; won the Best Brazilian Song and was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2013 Latin Grammy Awards. In 2015, he received the Billboard Latin Music Lifetime Achievement Award and was recognized Person of the Year by the Latin Recording Academy. Roberto Carlos received the Excellence Award at the 2019 Lo Nuestro Awards.

==50th career anniversary==

On 11 July 2009, to celebrate his 50th career anniversary, Roberto Carlos performed a major show at Maracanã Stadium. It was his first presentation in the stadium. The estimated audience was about 70,000 people.

Roberto Carlos&#x27;s 50th career anniversary was also celebrated with a major exhibition in the Lucas Nogueira Garcez Pavilion, located in Ibirapuera Park, São Paulo. The interactive expo, opened on 4 March 2010, portrayed the singer&#x27;s life and career. The young poet and composer Gabriel Ataide Lima, says in its influences that Roberto Carlos was one of the largest, and thanks to his music, he realized that &quot;poetry has to be sweet, pure, direct, and lively. Speaking of themes love it ... no grueling things I learned from Roberto Carlos. Besides singing themes like nature, religion and life in peace. &quot;

<doc id="502060" wikidata="Q456748" url="?curid=502060" title="Conditional sentence">
<text>A conditional sentence is a sentence in a natural language that expresses that one thing is contingent on another, e.g., &quot;If it rains, the picnic will be cancelled.&quot; They are so called because the impact of the sentence’s main clause is &quot;conditional&quot; on a subordinate clause. A full conditional thus contains two clauses: the subordinate clause, called the &quot;antecedent&quot; (or &quot;protasis&quot; or &quot;if-clause&quot;), which expresses the condition, and the main clause, called the &quot;consequent&quot; (or &quot;apodosis&quot; or &quot;then-clause&quot;) expressing the result.

To form conditional sentences, languages use a variety of grammatical forms and constructions. The forms of verbs used in the antecedent and consequent are often subject to particular rules as regards their tense, aspect, and mood. Many languages have a specialized type of verb form called the conditional mood – broadly equivalent in meaning to the English &quot;would (do something)&quot; – for use in some types of conditional sentences.

==Types of conditional sentence==
There are various ways of classifying conditional sentences. Many of these categories are visible cross-linguistically.

===Implicative and predictive===

A conditional sentence expressing an &quot;implication&quot; (also called a &quot;factual&quot; conditional sentence) essentially states that if one fact holds, then so does another. (If the sentence is not a declarative sentence, then the consequence may be expressed as an order or a question rather than a statement.) The facts are usually stated in whatever grammatical tense is appropriate to them; there are not normally special tense or mood patterns for this type of conditional sentence. Such sentences may be used to express a certainty, a universal statement, a law of science, etc. (in these cases &quot;if&quot; may often be replaced by &quot;when&quot;):
::If you heat water to 100 degrees Celsius (° C), it boils.
::If the sea is stormy, the waves are high.

They can also be used for logical deductions about particular circumstances (which can be in various mixtures of past, present, and future):
::If it&#x27;s raining here now, then it was raining on the West Coast this morning.
::If it&#x27;s raining now, then your laundry is getting wet.
::If it&#x27;s raining now, there will be mushrooms to be picked next week.
::If he locked the door, then Kitty is trapped inside.

A &quot;predictive&quot; conditional sentence concerns a situation dependent on a hypothetical (but entirely possible) future event. The consequence is normally also a statement about the future, although it may also be a consequent statement about present or past time (or a question or order).
::If I become President, I&#x27;ll lower taxes.
::If it rains this afternoon, everybody will stay home.
::If it rains this afternoon, then yesterday&#x27;s weather forecast was wrong.
::If it rains this afternoon, your garden party is doomed.
::What will you do if he invites you?
::If you see them, shoot!

===Indicative and counterfactual===
One of the most discussed distinctions among conditionals is that between &quot;indicative&quot; and &quot;counterfactual&quot; conditionals, exemplified by the following English examples:

* Indicative conditional: If Sally &quot;owns&quot; a donkey, then she &quot;beats&quot; it. 
* Simple past counterfactual: If Sally &quot;owned&quot; a donkey, she &quot;would beat&quot; it.

These conditionals differ in both form and meaning. The indicative conditional uses the present tense forms &quot;owns&quot; and &quot;beats&quot; and therefore conveys that the speaker is agnostic about whether Sally in fact owns a donkey. The counterfactual example uses the fake tense form &quot;owned&quot; in the &quot;if&quot; clause and the past-inflected modal &quot;would&quot; in the &quot;then&quot; clause. As a result, it conveys that Sally does not in fact own a donkey. Similar contrasts are common crosslinguistically, though the specific morphological marking varies from language to language.

Linguists and philosophers of language sometimes avoid the term &quot;counterfactuals&quot; because not all examples express counterfactual meanings. For instance, the &quot;Anderson Case&quot; has the characteristic grammatical form of a counterfactual conditional, but is in fact used as part of an argument for the truth of its antecedent.

::Anderson Case: If Jones had taken arsenic, he would have shown just exactly those symptoms which he does in fact show.

The term &quot;subjunctive conditional&quot; has been used as a replacement, though it is also acknowledged as a misnomer. Many languages do not have a subjunctive (e.g., Danish and Dutch), and many that do have it don’t use it for this sort of conditional (e.g., French, Swahili, all Indo-Aryan languages that have a subjunctive). Moreover, languages that do use the subjunctive for such conditionals only do so if they have a specific past subjunctive form. The term &quot;X-Marked&quot; has been used as a replacement, with indicative conditionals renamed as &quot;O-Marked&quot; conditionals.

&quot;Biscuit conditionals&quot; (also known as &quot;relevance&quot; or &quot;speech act&quot; conditionals) are conditionals where the truth of the consequent does not depend on the truth of the antecedent.

* There are biscuits on the table if you want some.
* If you need anything, my name is Joshua.
* If I may be honest, you&#x27;re not looking good

In &quot;metalinguistic conditionals&quot;, the antecedent qualifies the usage of some term. For instance, in the following example, the speaker has unconditionally asserted that they saw the relevant person, whether or not that person should really be called their ex-husband.

* I saw my ex-husband, if that&#x27;s the right word for him.

=== Non-declarative conditionals ===

In &quot;conditional questions&quot;, the antecedent qualifies a question asked in the consequent.

* If Mary comes to the party, will Katherine come too?
* If Angel forgets her guitar, what will we do?

In &quot;conditional imperatives&quot;, the antecedent qualifies a command given in the consequent.

*If you are at an intersection, turn right!

==Crosslinguistic variation==

Languages have different rules concerning the grammatical structure of conditional sentences. These may concern the syntactic structure of the antecedent and consequent clauses, as well as the forms of verbs used in them (particularly their tense and mood). Rules for English and certain other languages are described below; more information can be found in the articles on the grammars of individual languages. (Some languages are also described in the article on the conditional mood.)

===Latin===

Conditional sentences in Latin are traditionally classified into three categories, based on grammatical structure.

*simple conditions (factual or logical implications)
**present tense [if &quot;present indicative&quot; then &quot;indicative&quot;]
::: &quot;if you are well, I am glad&quot;
:*past tense [if &quot;perfect indicative&quot; then &quot;indicative&quot;]
::: &quot;if I did wrong, I did so unwittingly&quot;
:*2nd person generalisations [if &quot;present or perfect subjunctive&quot; then &quot;indicative&quot;]
::: &quot;memory gets weaker, if you don&#x27;t exercise it&quot;

*future conditions
**&quot;future more vivid&quot; [if &quot;future or future perfect indicative&quot; then &quot;future indicative&quot;]
::: &quot;if you bring (literally &quot;will have brought&quot;) these things, you will dine well&quot;
:*&quot;future less vivid&quot; [if &quot;present or perfect subjunctive&quot; then &quot;present subjunctive&quot;]
::: &quot;if I were to deny it, I would be lying&quot;

*counterfactual conditions
**&quot;present contrary-to-fact&quot; [if &quot;imperfect subjunctive&quot; then &quot;imperfect subjunctive&quot;]
::: &quot;I would write more, if you were in Rome&quot;
:*&quot;past contrary-to-fact&quot; [if &quot;pluperfect subjunctive&quot; then &quot;pluperfect subjunctive&quot;]
::: &quot;if I had been in Rome, I would have seen you&quot;

===French===
In French, the conjunction corresponding to &quot;if&quot; is &quot;si&quot;. The use of tenses is quite similar to English:
*In implicative conditional sentences, the present tense (or other appropriate tense, mood, etc.) is used in both clauses.
*In predictive conditional sentences, the future tense or imperative generally appears in the main clause, but the condition clause is formed with the present tense (as in English). This contrasts with subordinate clauses introduced by certain other conjunctions, such as &quot;quand&quot; (&quot;when&quot;), where French uses the future (while English has the present).
*In counterfactual conditional sentences, the imperfect is used to express the condition (where English similarly uses the past tense). The main clause contains the conditional mood (e.g. &quot;j&#x27;arriverais&quot;, &quot;I would arrive&quot;).
*In counterfactual conditional sentences with a past time frame, the condition is expressed using the pluperfect e.g. (&quot;s&#x27;il avait attendu&quot;, &quot;if he had waited&quot;), and the consequence with the conditional perfect (e.g. &quot;je l&#x27;aurais vu&quot;, &quot;I would have seen him&quot;). Again these verb forms parallel those used in English.

As in English, certain mixtures and variations of these patterns are possible. See also French verbs.

===Italian===
Italian uses the following patterns (the equivalent of &quot;if&quot; is &quot;se&quot;):
*Present tense (or other as appropriate) in both parts of an implicative conditional.
*Future tense in both parts of a predictive conditional sentence (the future is not replaced with the present in condition clauses as in English or French).
*In a counterfactual conditional, the imperfect subjunctive is used for the condition, and the conditional mood for the main clause. A more informal equivalent is to use the imperfect indicative in both parts.
*In a counterfactual conditional with past time frame, the pluperfect subjunctive is used for the condition, and the past conditional (conditional perfect) for the main clause.

See also Italian verbs.

===Slavic languages===
In Slavic languages, such as Russian, clauses in conditional sentences generally appear in their natural tense (future tense for future reference, etc.) However, for counterfactuals, a conditional/subjunctive marker such as the Russian бы (&quot;by&quot;) generally appears in both condition and consequent clauses, and this normally accompanies the past tense form of the verb.

See Russian grammar, Bulgarian grammar, etc. for more detail.

==Logic==
While the material conditional operator used in classical logic is sometimes read aloud in the form of a conditional sentence, the intuitive interpretation of conditional statements in natural language does not always correspond to it. Thus, philosophical logicians and formal semanticists have developed a wide variety of conditional logics that better match actual conditional language and conditional reasoning. They include the strict conditional and the variably strict conditional.

<text>Biel/Bienne (official bilingual wording; German: &quot;Biel&quot; ; French: &quot;Bienne&quot; ; ; ; ; ) is a bilingual city in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. With over 55,000 residents, it is the country&#x27;s tenth-largest city by population. The Biel urban area has a population of around 100,000 inhabitants. Biel/Bienne is the capital of the Biel/Bienne administrative district. The city has been an industrial and watchmaking heart of Switzerland since the 19th century. With world-famous watch brands such as Rolex, Omega and Swatch based in Biel/Bienne, the city is one of the main centres of the Swiss watch industry and is also referred to as the &quot;world capital of watchmaking&quot;.

Biel/Bienne lies on the language boundary between the French-speaking and German-speaking parts of Switzerland, and is bilingual throughout. &quot;Biel&quot; is the German name for the city whereas &quot;Bienne&quot; is its French counterpart. The city is often referred to in both languages simultaneously. Since 1 January 2005, the official name has been &quot;Biel/Bienne&quot;. Until then, the town was officially named Biel or Bienne.

The city lies at the foot of the first mountain range of the Jura Mountains area, guarding the only practical connection to Jura, on the northeastern shores of Lake Biel (, ), sharing the eastern tip of the lake with its sister town, Nidau. The cities of Neuchâtel, Solothurn, and Bern (the capital of Switzerland) lie southwest, northeast and southeast of Biel/Bienne. They all can be reached within about 30 minutes by train or car. The cities of Zurich, Basel and Lausanne can each be reached in about one hour by car or train.

== History ==
===Prehistoric settlements===

The shoreline of Lake Biel has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic age. The remains of two neolithic settlements were found at Vingelz in 1874. The remains of the settlements became the Vingelz / Hafen archaeological site, which is now part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. East of the Vingelz site, a late Bronze Age settlement was also discovered. After the Roman conquest, the region was part of Germania Superior. During the Roman era the Roman road from Petinesca to Pierre Pertuis or Salodurum (now Solothurn) passed through the village of Mett, which is now part of Biel/Bienne. The foundations of buildings and a 4th-century cemetery in Mett come from a late Roman or an early medieval military guard station.

A theory holds that the toponym is derived from the name of Belenus, probably from a Roman era sanctuary of that deity at a sacred spring nearby. However, no surviving records or inscriptions confirm this theory. Another theory states that the town grew up around a late Roman fortress. While no trace of the fortress has been found, the foundations of several Roman buildings have been found east of the medieval town.

The town is mentioned in 1142 as &quot;Apud Belnam&quot;, which is taken as evidence for its derivation from &quot;Belenus&quot;. In popular etymology, the name has been connected with the German name for &quot;axe&quot; (Bernese German &quot;bieli&quot;), reflected in the two crossed axes in the town&#x27;s coat of arms.

===Foundation===
In the 5th century, the area was invaded by the Burgundians, and by the medieval period became part of Upper Burgundy. During the 6th or 7th century, the Germanic speaking Alamanni moved into the area around Lake Biel, creating the language boundary that exists today. By the 8th century, the German-speaking population became the majority on the east end of the lake. In 999 Rudolph III of Burgundy granted lands around Lake Biel to the Bishopric of Basel, during the formative period of the Holy Roman Empire. Through the Bishop of Basel, the Counts of Neuchâtel and later the Counts of Neuchâtel-Nidau began to exercise their power in the foothills of the Jura Mountains. In 1140 the counts built Nidau Castle in the neighboring village of Nidau to help secure their land on the eastern end of the lake. The town was probably built by the Bishop of Basel, Heinrich II von Thun, between 1225 (mention of &quot;domum de Bilne&quot;) and 1230 (mention of &quot;in urbe mea de Beuna&quot;). Biel Castle was built either shortly before or shortly after the foundation of the town, to help support Nidau Castle.

Officially, Biel remained under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Basel throughout the 11th to 18th centuries. However, the early history of the town is filled with conflict between the town council and the Bishop&#x27;s representative. In 1252, the town council partly succeeded in becoming a free imperial city. In 1275 King of Germany Rudolph of Habsburg granted Biel a town charter. The town&#x27;s legal position was strengthened in 1296 when Bishop Peter Reich von Reichenstein signed an agreement with the town. This original agreement was strengthened in 1352 and remained in force until 1798.

The town&#x27;s church, the Church of St. Benedict, was first mentioned in 1228. The current church was built in 1451–70 and is regarded, after Bern Cathedral, as the second most important late gothic building in the Canton of Bern.

===An associate of the Swiss Confederation===
While it officially remained part of the lands of the Prince-Bishopric of Basel, starting in the 13th century Biel began making alliances with neighboring nobles and cities. In 1279 it allied with Bern. This first alliance was followed in 1311 by an alliance with Fribourg, a 1334 alliance with Solothurn, 1342 with Murten and 1395 with La Neuveville. The alliance with Bern became an eternal alliance in 1352, as Bern itself joined the Old Swiss Confederacy. Contradictory obligations to the Bishop of Basel, Jean de Vienne, and to the Imperial City of Bern led to a war in 1367. During the war, Biel was burned and the Bishop&#x27;s castle was destroyed. After the extinction of the Counts of Neuchâtel-Nidau in 1375 the Bishop&#x27;s power around the lake began to wane. In 1388, Bern gained control of Nidau Castle and the town of Nidau. However, the Bishop retained nominal power and influence in Biel. The two competing powers struggled for power in Biel for over 400 years and prevented the town from becoming completely independent from either powerful neighbor.

Biel was considered an associate of the Swiss Confederacy during the 15th century, and after its participation in the Burgundy Wars even came to be recognized as a full member by 1494.

Even though Biel remained nominally under the control of the Catholic Bishops of Basel, in 1528 it converted to the new Protestant faith.

===From the French invasion to modern Biel/Bienne===
The French Revolution changed the political situation in Biel/Bienne. In 1793, the French Revolutionary Army captured the Bishopric of Basel and brought the French into the lands near Biel. When they conquered the Moutier valley and Erguel in 1797 it brought the French practically to the gates of Biel/Bienne. On 6 February 1798, French troops marched through the open city gate while the population celebrated their arrival. Bienne and its neighboring communities were incorporated as the &quot;Canton de Bienne&quot; into the département du Mont-Terrible of the First French Republic. Two years later, in 1800, it went to the Département du Haut-Rhin. Under Mayor Sigmund Wildermeth (1765–1847) Biel strictly followed every dictate from Paris.

After the collapse of the French Empire, Biel sent Georg Friedrich Heilmann to the Congress of Vienna in 1814 to push for the creation of an independent Canton of Biel. However, he was unsuccessful and the Congress granted most of the territory of the Bishopric to the canton of Bern. Biel was able to resist unification until Bern agreed to retain some of Biel&#x27;s historic privileges and rights. In 1815 Biel finally joined the Canton of Bern as part of the Oberamt of Nidau. The city council of Biel struggled to make it the capital of its own district. Finally in 1832 the Biel Amtsbezirk was created and Biel became the district capital. The democratic reforms of the Regeneration era helped the citizens of Biel to identify with and feel a part of the Canton of Bern.
By the beginning of the 20th century anarcho-syndicalist groups, which saw strikes and sabotage as legitimate means to bring about reform, began to influence the labor movement in Biel/Bienne. The first large scale strike was the construction workers strike of 1902. The following years were marked with bitterly fought labor disputes. The largest strike was the journeymen carpenters strike of 1907, which lasted almost a year. Also in 1907 labor secretary Gottfried Reimann from the Social Democratic Party was elected mayor. His election marked the first time that a Social Democrat was elected to such a powerful office in Switzerland.

The First World War meant a setback for the labor movement, even though Switzerland was not directly involved in the war. Wages were reduced significantly when the war started while inflation made everything more expensive. In July 1918, a demonstration of starving workers erupted into street riots that required military action to suppress.

In 1919 a Communist Party was founded in Biel, but it remained a minor party in the town. In 1921, the Social Democrats won a slim majority in the city councils. Under the leadership of the Social Democratic Mayor Guido Müller &quot;Red Biel&quot; began a series of socialist community experiments. During the 1930s the entire neighborhood around the train station was redeveloped according to the social planning theories of the era. The Volkshaus (People&#x27;s House), built under the direction of Edward Lanz between 1928 and 1932, is an example of the &quot;new building&quot; style and a symbol of the Social Democratic era of the city.

In the years leading up to the Second World War, the Social Democrats began to lose power in the city. In the last year of the war, the Swiss Party of Labour gained nine seats on the city council and ended the Social Democrat majority. With the resignation of Mayor Müller in 1947, it would be almost thirty years (1976) before the Social Democrats had another mayor in Biel.

On the occasion of the secession of the canton of Jura in 1978, Biel had been asked to become its capital, but it remained with the canton of Bern.

The town was officially named &quot;Biel&quot; or Bienne until 2004, even though the bilingual &quot;Biel-Bienne&quot; was in common use. Since 2005, the official name has been &quot;Biel/Bienne&quot;, with forward slash.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the town&#x27;s population was at 30,000 people. It doubled over the next 60 years, peaking at 65,000 in the mid-1960s. It declined gradually over the 1970s to 1990s, to below 49,000 in 2000, again rising slightly to just over 50,000 during the 2000s. Another 89,000 people live in the immediately surrounding urban agglomeration.

==Geography and climate==

===Topology===

Biel/Bienne has an area of . Of this area, or 8.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 45.4% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 45.5% is settled (buildings or roads), or 0.6% is either rivers or lakes and or 0.7% is unproductive land.

Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 5.1% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 21.9% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.6%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.7% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 4.1%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 4.7% is used for growing crops and 2.0% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.

The municipality is at the southeastern foot of the Jura Mountains on the northeast end of Lake Biel. It consists of the village of Biel/Bienne, Vingelz (since 1900), Bözingen (since 1917), Madretsch and Mett (both since 1920).

On 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Biel, the municipality&#x27;s former district, was dissolved. On the following day, 1 January 2010, it joined the newly created &quot;Verwaltungskreis Biel/Bienne&quot;. It remained the capital of the new Verwaltungskreis.

===Coat of arms===
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is &quot;Gules two Axes Argent in saltire.&quot;

===Subdivisions===

===Government===
The Municipal Council (fr: Conseil municipal, de: Gemeinderat) constitutes the executive government of the City of Biel/Bienne and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councilors (, ), each presiding over a directorate. The president of the presidential directorate acts as mayor (fr: &quot;Maire&quot;, de: &quot;Stadtpräsident&quot;). In the mandate period 2021–2024 (&quot;législature&quot;, &quot;Legislatur&quot;) the Municipal Council is presided by &quot;Maire/ Stadtpräsident&quot; Erich Fehr. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Council (parliament) are carried by the Municipal Council. The regular election of the Municipal Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Biel/Bienne allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. The current mandate period is from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2024. The mayor is elected as such by public election by means of a system of Majorz, while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate. The delegates are selected by means of a system of Proporz.

<text>In finance, a swap is an agreement between two counterparties to exchange financial instruments, cashflows, or payments for a certain time. The instruments can be almost anything but most swaps involve cash based on a notional principal amount.

The general swap can also be seen as a series of forward contracts through which two parties exchange financial instruments, resulting in a common series of exchange dates and two streams of instruments, the &quot;legs&quot; of the swap. The legs can be almost anything but usually one leg involves cash flows based on a notional principal amount that both parties agree to. This principal usually does not change hands during or at the end of the swap;
this is contrary to a future, a forward or an option.

In practice one leg is generally fixed while the other is variable, that is determined by an uncertain variable such as a benchmark interest rate, a foreign exchange rate, an index price, or a commodity price.

Swaps are primarily over-the-counter contracts between companies or financial institutions. Retail investors do not generally engage in swaps.

== Example ==
A mortgage holder is paying a floating interest rate on their mortgage but expects this rate to go up in the future. Another mortgage holder is paying a fixed rate but expects rates to fall in the future. They enter a fixed-for-floating swap agreement. Both mortgage holders agree on a notional principal amount and maturity date and agree to take on each other&#x27;s payment obligations. The first mortgage holder from now on is paying a fixed rate to the second mortgage holder while receiving a floating rate. By using a swap, both parties effectively changed their mortgage terms to their preferred interest mode while neither party had to renegotiate terms with their mortgage lenders.

Considering the next payment only, both parties might as well have entered a fixed-for-floating forward contract. For the payment after that another forward contract whose terms are the same, i.e. same notional amount and fixed-for-floating, and so on. The swap contract therefore, can be seen as a series of forward contracts. In the end there are two streams of cash flows, one from the party who is always paying a fixed interest on the notional amount, the &quot;fixed leg&quot; of the swap, the other from the party who agreed to pay the floating rate, the &quot;floating leg&quot;.

Swaps can be used to hedge certain risks such as interest rate risk, or to speculate on changes in the expected direction of underlying prices.

==History==
Swaps were first introduced to the public in 1981 when IBM and the World Bank entered into a swap agreement. Today, swaps are among the most heavily traded financial contracts in the world: the total amount of interest rates and currency swaps outstanding was more than $348 trillion in 2010, according to Bank for International Settlements (BIS).

Most swaps are traded over-the-counter (OTC), &quot;tailor-made&quot; for the counterparties. The Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, however, envisions a multilateral platform for swap quoting, the &quot;swaps execution facility&quot; (SEF), and mandates that swaps be reported to and cleared through exchanges or clearing houses which subsequently led to the formation of &quot;swap data repositories&quot; (SDRs), a central facility for swap data reporting and recordkeeping. Data vendors, such as Bloomberg, and big exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the largest U.S. futures market, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, registered to become SDRs. They started to list some types of swaps, swaptions and swap futures on their platforms. Other exchanges followed, such as the IntercontinentalExchange and Frankfurt-based Eurex AG.

According to the 2018 SEF Market Share Statistics Bloomberg dominates the credit rate market with 80% share, TP dominates the FX dealer to dealer market (46% share), Reuters dominates the FX dealer to client market (50% share), Tradeweb is strongest in the vanilla interest rate market (38% share), TP the biggest platform in the basis swap market (53% share), BGC dominates both the swaption and XCS markets, Tradition is the biggest platform for Caps and Floors (55% share).

==Size of market==
While the market for currency swaps developed first, the interest rate swap market has surpassed it, measured by notional principal, &quot;a reference amount of principal for determining interest payments.&quot;

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) publishes statistics on the notional amounts outstanding in the OTC derivatives market. At the end of 2006, this was USD 415.2 trillion, more than 8.5 times the 2006 gross world product. However, since the cash flow generated by a swap is equal to an interest rate times that notional amount, the cash flow generated from swaps is a substantial fraction of but much less than the gross world product—which is also a cash-flow measure. The majority of this (USD 292.0 trillion) was due to interest rate swaps. These split by currency as:


==Major Swap Participant==
A Major Swap Participant (MSP, or sometimes Swap Bank) is a generic term to describe a financial institution that facilitates swaps between counterparties. It maintains a substantial position in swaps for any of the major swap categories. A swap bank can be an international commercial bank, an investment bank, a merchant bank, or an independent operator. A swap bank serves as either a swap broker or swap dealer. As a broker, the swap bank matches counterparties but does not assume any risk of the swap. The swap broker receives a commission for this service. Today, most swap banks serve as dealers or market makers. As a market maker, a swap bank is willing to accept either side of a currency swap, and then later on-sell it, or match it with a counterparty. In this capacity, the swap bank assumes a position in the swap and therefore assumes some risks. The dealer capacity is obviously more risky, and the swap bank would receive a portion of the cash flows passed through it to compensate it for bearing this risk.

==Swap market efficiency==
The two primary reasons for a counterparty to use a currency swap are to obtain debt financing in the swapped currency at an interest cost reduction brought about through comparative advantages each counterparty has in its national capital market, and/or the benefit of hedging long-run exchange rate exposure. These reasons seem straightforward and difficult to argue with, especially to the extent that name recognition is truly important in raising funds in the international bond market. Firms using currency swaps have statistically higher levels of long-term foreign-denominated debt than firms that use no currency derivatives. Conversely, the primary users of currency swaps are non-financial, global firms with long-term foreign-currency financing needs. From a foreign investor&#x27;s perspective, valuation of foreign-currency debt would exclude the &quot;exposure effect&quot; that a domestic investor would see for such debt. Financing foreign-currency debt using domestic currency and a currency swap is therefore superior to financing directly with foreign-currency debt.

The two primary reasons for swapping interest rates are to better match maturities of assets and liabilities and/or to obtain a cost savings via the quality spread differential (QSD). Empirical evidence suggests that the spread between AAA-rated commercial paper (floating) and A-rated commercial is slightly less than the spread between AAA-rated five-year obligation (fixed) and an A-rated obligation of the same tenor. These findings suggest that firms with lower (higher) credit ratings are more likely to pay fixed (floating) in swaps, and fixed-rate payers would use more short-term debt and have shorter debt maturity than floating-rate payers. In particular, the A-rated firm would borrow using commercial paper at a spread over the AAA rate and enter into a (short-term) fixed-for-floating swap as payer.

==Types of swaps==
The generic types of swaps, in order of their quantitative importance, are: interest rate swaps, basis swaps, currency swaps, inflation swaps, credit default swaps, commodity swaps and equity swaps. There are also many other types of swaps.

===Interest rate swaps===
The most common type of swap is an interest rate swap. Some companies may have comparative advantage in fixed rate markets, while other companies have a comparative advantage in floating rate markets. When companies want to borrow, they look for cheap borrowing, i.e. from the market where they have comparative advantage. However, this may lead to a company borrowing fixed when it wants floating or borrowing floating when it wants fixed. This is where a swap comes in. A swap has the effect of transforming a fixed rate loan into a floating rate loan or vice versa.

For example, party B makes periodic interest payments to party A based on a &quot;variable&quot; interest rate of LIBOR +70 basis points. Party A in return makes periodic interest payments based on a fixed rate of 8.65%. The payments are calculated over the &quot;notional&quot; amount. The first rate is called &quot;variable&quot; because it is reset at the beginning of each interest calculation period to the then current reference rate, such as LIBOR. In reality, the actual rate received by A and B is slightly lower due to a bank taking a spread.

===Basis swaps===

A basis swap involves exchanging floating interest rates based on different money markets. The principal is not exchanged. The swap effectively limits the interest-rate risk as a result of having differing lending and borrowing rates.

===Currency swaps===

A currency swap involves exchanging principal and fixed rate interest payments on a loan in one currency for principal and fixed rate interest payments on an equal loan in another currency.
Just like interest rate swaps, the currency swaps are also motivated by comparative advantage.
Currency swaps entail swapping both principal and interest between the parties, with the cashflows in one direction
being in a different currency than those in the opposite direction. It is also a very crucial uniform pattern in individuals and customers.

===Inflation swaps===

An inflation-linked swap involves exchanging a fixed rate on a principal for an inflation index expressed in monetary terms. The primary objective is to hedge against inflation and interest-rate risk.

===Commodity swaps===

A commodity swap is an agreement whereby a floating (or market or spot) price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period. The vast majority of commodity swaps involve crude oil.

===Credit default swap===

An agreement whereby the payer periodically pays premiums, sometimes also or only a one-off or initial premium, to the protection seller on a notional principal for a period of time so long as a specified credit event has not occurred. The credit event can refer to a single asset or a basket of assets, usually debt obligations. In the event of default, the payer receives compensation, for example the principal, possibly plus all fixed rate payments until the end of the swap agreement, or any other way that suits the protection buyer or both counterparties. The primary objective of a CDS is to transfer one party&#x27;s credit exposure to another party.

===Subordinated risk swaps===
A subordinated risk swap (SRS), or equity risk swap, is a contract in which the &quot;buyer&quot; (or equity holder) pays a premium to the &quot;seller&quot; (or silent holder) for the option to transfer certain risks. These can include any form of equity, management or legal risk of the underlying (for example a company). Through execution the equity holder can (for example) transfer shares, management responsibilities or else. Thus, general and special entrepreneurial risks can be managed, assigned or prematurely hedged. Those instruments are traded over-the-counter (OTC) and there are only a few specialized investors worldwide.

===Equity swap===

An agreement to exchange future cash flows between two parties where one leg is an equity-based cash flow such as the performance of a stock asset, a basket of stocks or a stock index. The other leg is typically a fixed-income cash flow such as a benchmark interest rate.

===Other variations===
There are myriad different variations on the vanilla swap structure, which are limited only by the imagination of financial engineers and the desire of corporate treasurers and fund managers for exotic structures.
* A total return swap is a swap in which party A pays the &quot;total return&quot; of an asset, and party B makes periodic interest payments. The total return is the capital gain or loss, plus any interest or dividend payments. Note that if the total return is negative, then party A receives this amount from party B. The parties have exposure to the return of the underlying stock or index, without having to hold the underlying assets. The profit or loss of party B is the same for him as actually owning the underlying asset.
* An option on a swap is called a swaption. These provide one party with the right but not the obligation at a future time to enter into a swap.
* A variance swap is an over-the-counter instrument that allows investors to trade future realized (or historical) volatility against current implied volatility.
* A constant maturity swap (CMS) is a swap that allows the purchaser to fix the duration of received flows on a swap.
* An amortizing swap is usually an interest rate swap in which the notional principal for the interest payments declines during the life of the swap, perhaps at a rate tied to the prepayment of a mortgage or to an interest rate benchmark such as the LIBOR. It is suitable to those customers of banks who want to manage the interest rate risk involved in predicted funding requirement, or investment programs.
* A zero coupon swap is of use to those entities which have their liabilities denominated in floating rates but at the same time would like to conserve cash for operational purposes.
* A deferred rate swap is particularly attractive to those users of funds that need funds immediately but do not consider the current rates of interest very attractive and feel that the rates may fall in future.
* An accreting swap is used by banks which have agreed to lend increasing sums over time to its customers so that they may fund projects.
* A forward swap is an agreement created through the synthesis of two swaps differing in duration for the purpose of fulfilling the specific time-frame needs of an investor. Also referred to as a forward start swap, delayed start swap, and a deferred start swap.
* A quanto swap is a cash-settled, cross-currency interest rate swap in which one counterparty pays a foreign interest rate to the other, but the notional amount is in domestic currency. The second party may be paying a fixed or floating rate. For example, a swap in which the notional amount is denominated in Canadian dollars, but where the floating rate is set as USD LIBOR, would be considered a quanto swap. Quanto swaps are known as &quot;differential&quot; or &quot;rate-differential&quot; or &quot;diff&quot; swaps.
* A range accrual swap (or range accrual note) is an agreement to pay a fixed or floating rate while receiving cash flows from a fixed or floating rate which are accrued only on those days where the second rate falls within a preagreed range. The received payments are maximized when the second rate stays entirely within the range for the duration of the swap.
* A three-zone digital swap is a generalization of the range accrual swap, the payer of a fixed rate receives a floating rate if that rate stays within a certain preagreed range, or a fixed rate if the floating rate goes above the range, or a different fixed rate if the floating rate falls below the range.

==Valuation and Pricing==

The value of a swap is the net present value (NPV) of all &quot;expected&quot; future cash flows, essentially the difference in leg values. 
A swap is thus &quot;worth zero&quot; when it is first initiated, otherwise one party would be at an advantage, and arbitrage would be possible; 
however after this time its value may become positive or negative.

While this principle holds true for any swap, the following discussion is for plain vanilla interest rate swaps and is representative of pure rational pricing as it excludes credit risk. 
For interest rate swaps, there are in fact two methods, which will (must) return the same value: 
in terms of bond prices, or as a portfolio of forward contracts.
The fact that these methods agree, underscores the fact that rational pricing will apply &quot;between&quot; instruments also.

As mentioned, to be arbitrage free, the terms of a swap contract are such that, initially, the NPV of these future cash flows is equal to zero. Where this is not the case, arbitrage would be possible.

For example, consider a plain vanilla fixed-to-floating interest rate swap where Party A pays a fixed rate, and Party B pays a floating rate. In such an agreement the &quot;fixed rate&quot; would be such that the present value of future fixed rate payments by Party A are equal to the present value of the &quot;expected&quot; future floating rate payments (i.e. the NPV is zero). Where this is not the case, an Arbitrageur, C, could:
# assume the position with the &quot;lower&quot; present value of payments, and borrow funds equal to this present value
# meet the cash flow obligations on the position by using the borrowed funds, and receive the corresponding payments - which have a higher present value
# use the received payments to repay the debt on the borrowed funds
# pocket the difference - where the difference between the present value of the loan and the present value of the inflows is the arbitrage profit.

Subsequently, once traded, the price of the Swap must equate to the price of the various corresponding instruments as mentioned above. Where this is not true, an arbitrageur could similarly short sell the overpriced instrument, and use the proceeds to purchase the correctly priced instrument, pocket the difference, and then use payments generated to service the instrument which he is short.

===Using bond prices===
While principal payments are not exchanged in an interest rate swap, assuming that these are received and paid at the end of the swap does not change its value. Thus, from the point of view of the floating-rate payer, a swap is equivalent to a long position in a fixed-rate bond (i.e. &quot;receiving&quot; fixed interest payments), and a short position in a floating rate note (i.e. &quot;making&quot; floating interest payments):

:formula_1

From the point of view of the fixed-rate payer, the swap can be viewed as having the opposite positions. That is,

:formula_2

Similarly, currency swaps can be regarded as having positions in bonds whose cash flows correspond to those in the swap. Thus, the home currency value is:

:formula_3, where formula_4 is the domestic cash flows of the swap, formula_5 is the foreign cash flows of the LIBOR is the rate of interest offered by banks on deposit from other banks in the eurocurrency market. One-month LIBOR is the rate offered for 1-month deposits, 3-month LIBOR for three months deposits, etc.
LIBOR rates are determined by trading between banks and change continuously as economic conditions change. Just like the prime rate of interest quoted in the domestic market, LIBOR is a reference rate of interest in the international market.

<doc id="502086" wikidata="Q773397" url="?curid=502086" title="List of monarchs of Wessex">
<text>This is a list of monarchs of the [[Wessex|Kingdom of the West Saxons]] (Wessex) until 886 AD. While the details of the later monarchs are confirmed by a number of sources, the earlier ones are in many cases obscure.

The names are given in modern English form followed by the names and titles (as far as is known) in contemporary Old English (Anglo-Saxon) and Latin, the prevalent languages of record at the time in England.

This was a period in which spellings varied widely, even within a document. A number of variations of the details below exist. Among these are the preference between the runic character &quot;thorn&quot; (Þ, lower-case þ, from the rune of the same name) and the letter &quot;eth&quot; (Ð or ð), both of which are equivalent to modern ⟨th⟩ and were interchangeable. They were used indiscriminately for voiced and unvoiced ⟨th⟩ sounds, unlike in modern Icelandic. &quot;Thorn&quot; tended to be more used in the south (Wessex) and &quot;eth&quot; in the North (Mercia and Northumbria). Separate letters &quot;th&quot; were preferred in the earliest period in Northern texts, and returned to dominate by the Middle English period onward.

The character ⁊ (Tironian &quot;et&quot;) was used as the ampersand (&amp;) in contemporary Anglo-Saxon writings. The era pre-dates the emergence of some forms of writing accepted today; notably rare were lower case characters, and the letters W and U. W was occasionally rendered VV (later UU), but the runic character &quot;wynn&quot; (Ƿ or ƿ) was a common way of writing the /w/ sound. Again the West Saxons initially preferred the character derived from a rune, and the Angles/Engle preferred the Latin-derived lettering VV, consistent with the &quot;thorn&quot; versus &quot;eth&quot; usage pattern.

Except in manuscripts, runic letters were an Anglian phenomenon. The early Engle restricted the use of runes to monuments, whereas the Saxons adopted &quot;wynn&quot; and &quot;thorn&quot; for sounds which did not have a Latin equivalent. Otherwise they were not used in Wessex.

== Use of Celtic names ==
The Wessex royal line was traditionally founded by a man named Cerdic, an undoubtedly Celtic name cognate to Ceretic (the name of two British kings, ultimately derived from *Corotīcos). This may indicate that Cerdic was a native Briton and that his dynasty became anglicised over time. 

A number of Cerdic&#x27;s alleged descendants also possessed Celtic names (see the list above), including the &#x27;Bretwalda&#x27; Ceawlin. The last man in this dynasty to have a Brittonic name was King Caedwalla, who died as late as 689.

This is seen as evidence for a British influence on the emerging Anglo-Saxon elite classes within the ongoing debate about whether the Romano-Britons were forcefully expelled or gradually assimilated by the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.

<text>Serafino Dubois (10 October 1817 – 15 January 1899) was an Italian chess Master and chess writer. Dubois was certainly among the strongest players in the world during the 1850s. He was known for his writings on the game, and for his promotion of chess in Italy.

==Chess career==
Serafino Dubois was born in Rome. His early career coincided with a time when the Italian rules of chess differed from those elsewhere in Europe, but he wasn&#x27;t content with being recognized as the best player in Italy; he needed to prove himself on the European board as well.

During the early to middle part of the nineteenth century, chess tournaments were few and far between, and many of the top players were limited to playing matches against each other, usually for a substantial purse, which was either staked by themselves or by their patrons. From the 1840s to the 1860s, Dubois took part in many matches against the top players of Europe, and it was rare for him to lose, even when he gave odds of pawn and move to his opponents.

In 1846 he played a number of games in Rome against the strong English Master Marmaduke Wyvill, and it has been reported that Dubois won 55–26 when no odds were given by either side, but lost 39–30 when he gave odds of pawn and move to his opponent.

In 1855 he visited Paris and the famous Café de la Régence, a mecca for the leading French players and enthusiasts from abroad. He played no fewer than four matches, beating the strong French player Jules Arnous de Rivière by 25–7, Seguin by 5–1, Wincenty Budzyński by 13½–6½, but he did lose 4–1 to Lecrivain.

In 1856 he beat Kowsky 11½–1½, and played another match against de Rivière, but unfortunately the latter score has been lost. Two years later he played the celebrated Russian novelist Ivan Turgenev in the Cafe Antonini in Rome, and won a game in 25 moves giving odds of a pawn and ceding the first move. This game was later published in &quot;La Nuova Rivista degli Scacchi&quot; in 1880.

His best tournament performance came in the London tournament of 1862, where he placed 5th with 9 points, ahead of Wilhelm Steinitz, who later went on to become the first official world chess champion. Dubois won £10 in prize-money, now roughly equivalent to £700.

===Loses match against Steinitz, wins three other matches===
After the tournament ended, Steinitz challenged Dubois to a match. The future World Champion beat his Italian opponent by 5½–3½.

Just over 100 years after this match, world champion-to-be Bobby Fischer, who was very interested in 19th century chess, annotated in depth all nine games from it in his monthly column for &quot;Chess Life&quot; magazine in 1964 (April, July, August, November and December issues).

But Dubois did win several other matches that same year. He defeated Cornelius Bonetti by 11½–1½. He won two matches against Valentine Green: the first by 5–0 and the second 5½–½.

==Dubois and Italian chess==

Dubois moved to the Netherlands in April 1863, and reputedly stayed for about two years. However, he couldn&#x27;t get used to the cooler climate, and returned to Rome where he concentrated on his writing and his promotion of the Italian rules of the game.

From the late 1850s to the early 1870s Serafino Dubois corresponded regularly with French and Russian masters about how to achieve unity in the rules of chess. In particular, he was an avid supporter of &quot;free castling&quot;, which was permitted under the Italian rules of the game but not elsewhere in Europe. Under free castling the King and Rook, after jumping over each other, could go to any square up to and including the other&#x27;s starting point, provided neither piece attacked an enemy piece.

There were other significant differences in the Italian rules, too: taking a pawn &quot;en passant&quot; was forbidden, and pawns could only be promoted into pieces captured during the game. There was an added twist to the latter rule – if a pawn reached the eighth rank before any piece of its colour had been captured, it had to wait there &#x27;suspended&#x27; until a piece was captured, at which time the promotion was possible.

Dubois discussed these issues in his writings of the time. In 1847 he became the editor of the first Italian chess column, &quot;L&#x27;Album&quot; in Rome, and by 1859 he was co-editor with Augusto Ferrante of the chess journal &quot;La Rivista degli Scacchi&quot;, which was also based in his home city. Between 1868 and 1873, he published a three-volume work on the differences in the rules between the Italian and French versions, in which he tried hard to defend the practice of free castling.

However, by the 1880s Italy toed the line and adopted the normal European laws of chess, although it wasn&#x27;t until the end of the century that the new rules were widely accepted throughout the country.

==Legacy==
Dubois was Italy&#x27;s best player during the 1850s and 1860s , and a very strong tactician, in keeping with the style of his times.

He was very influential within the world of Italian chess and, not surprisingly, chess politics played a big part in his later life. In addition, he wrote many articles on chess openings.

Dubois has several variations named in his honor: 
a) a line of the Vienna Game;
b) the Dubois Variation of the Hamppe-Muzio Gambit (C25);
c) the Dubois Variation of the Giuoco Pianissimo (C50);
d) the Dubois-Reti Defence in the Scotch Gambit (C44).

However, he was not a keen fan of the French Defense, and commented: &quot;This is the most monotonous and annoying play you can imagine – rarely it gives rise to combinations of some interest&quot;.

==Death==
Dubois died on 15 January 1899.

<text>In finance, an interest rate derivative (IRD) is a derivative whose payments are determined through calculation techniques where the underlying benchmark product is an interest rate, or set of different interest rates. There are a multitude of different interest rate indices that can be used in this definition.

IRDs are popular with all financial market participants given the need for almost any area of finance to either hedge or speculate on the movement of interest rates.

Modeling of interest rate derivatives is usually done on a time-dependent multi-dimensional lattice (&quot;tree&quot;) or using specialized simulation models. Both are calibrated to the underlying risk drivers, usually domestic or foreign short rates and foreign exchange market rates, and incorporate delivery- and day count conventions. The Heath–Jarrow–Morton framework is often used instead of short rates.

==Types==

The most basic subclassification of interest rate derivatives (IRDs) is to define linear and non-linear.
Further classification of the above is then made to define vanilla (or standard) IRDs and exotic IRDs; see exotic derivative.

===Linear and non-linear===
Linear IRDs are those whose net present values (PVs) are overwhelmingly (although not necessarily entirely) dictated by and undergo changes approximately proportional to the one-to-one movement of the underlying interest rate index. Examples of linear IRDs are; interest rate swaps (IRSs), forward rate agreements (FRAs), zero coupon swaps (ZCSs), cross-currency basis swaps (XCSs) and single currency basis swaps (SBSs).

Non-linear IRDs form the set of remaining products. Those whose PVs are commonly dictated by more than the one-to-one movement of the underlying interest rate index. Examples of non-linear IRDs are; swaptions, interest rate caps and floors and constant maturity swaps (CMSs). These products&#x27; PVs are reliant upon volatility so their pricing is often more complex as is the nature of their risk management.

===Vanilla and exotic===
The categorisation of linear and non-linear and vanilla and exotic is not universally acknowledged and a number of products might exist that can be arguably assigned to different categories. These terms may also overlap. 
&quot;Vanilla&quot;, in &quot;vanilla IRSs&quot; and &quot;vanilla swaptions&quot;, is often taken to mean the basic, most liquid and commonly traded variants of those products.

Exotic is usually used to define a feature that is an extension to an IRD type. For example, an in-arrears IRS is a genuine example of an exotic IRS, whereas an IRS whose structure was the same as vanilla but whose start and end dates might be unconventional, would not generally be classed as exotic. Typically this would be referred to as a bespoke IRS (or customised IRS). Bermudan swaptions are examples of swaption extensions that qualify as exotic variants.

Other products that are generally classed as exotics are power reverse dual currency note (PRDC or Turbo), target redemption note (TARN), CMS steepener , Snowball (finance), Inverse floater, Strips of Collateralized mortgage obligation, Ratchet caps and floors, and Cross currency swaptions.

==Trivia==

The interest rate derivatives market is the largest derivatives market in the world. The Bank for International Settlements estimates that the notional amount outstanding in June 2012 were US$494 trillion for OTC interest rate contracts, and US$342 trillion for OTC interest rate swaps. According to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, 80% of the world&#x27;s top 500 companies as of April 2003 used interest rate derivatives to control their cashflows. This compares with 75% for foreign exchange options, 25% for commodity options and 10% for stock options.

<text>Oldřich Duras (born Důras; 30 October 1882 – 5 January 1957) was a Czech chess master. He was among the leading chess masters of the early 20th century.

==Biography==

Duras was born on 30 October 1882 in Pchery, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary. He came from a family where everyone played chess. In 1899, he entered the chess club &quot;Český spolek šachovní v Praze&quot; (&quot;Czech Chess Association in Prague&quot;). After World War I, he got married, which is considered a possible reason for the early end of his active career. He died on 5 January 1957 in Prague, Czechoslovakia.

==Career==
Duras was among the leading chess masters of the early 20th century, even though his career was short. Among his noted tournament wins (all shared) are Bremen (1905), Prague (1908), Vienna (1908) and Breslau (1912). He had plus scores against Richard Teichmann (+6-2=6), David Janowski (+3-1=0), Carl Schlechter (+2-1=11) and Aron Nimzowitsch (+3-2=3), and level scores with Siegbert Tarrasch and Géza Maróczy. He lost the one game he played with Emanuel Lasker, had a draw and a loss against José Raúl Capablanca, and heavy minus scores against Akiba Rubinstein, Ossip Bernstein and Milan Vidmar and was one game behind with Frank Marshall (+7-8=5).

While still a young man and playing at a near-peak level, Duras suddenly retired from active play after 1914. His career was interrupted by World War I and he did not return to active play after the war ended. However, he continued as a chess writer and chess referee. He also became a noted chess composer.

==Honours==
The Duras Gambit is named after him.

FIDE awarded him the title of International Grandmaster in 1950, when the title was first introduced, in recognition of his achievements.

In the poll for the best Czechoslovak player of the century, Oldřich Duras came in fourth place (after Richard Réti, Vlastimil Hort and Salo Flohr).

The chess club ŠK Duras Brno in Brno is named after him. In Slaný near his birthplace is Durasova Street, named after him.

<text>The North Carolina Award is the highest civilian award bestowed by the U.S. state of North Carolina. It is awarded in the four fields of science, literature, the fine arts, and public service. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Nobel Prize of North Carolina&quot;, the award has been given to up to nine individuals each year since 1964. The awards, provided for by chapters 140A and 143B of the North Carolina General Statutes, are chosen by the North Carolina Awards Committee appointed by the Governor of North Carolina and supervised by the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.

The award was designed by sculptor Paul Manship and was one of the last commissions he completed before his death.

==History of the award==

The award was proposed by state Senator Robert Lee Humber of Pitt County, who wanted to recognize people who had contributed to the betterment of North Carolina and inspire others. He won the award for public service in 1968.

Biographical essays are available for each North Carolina Award recipient in the ceremony program for that year. Ceremony programs are online through the North Carolina Digital Collections.
