<text>The NAMC YS-11 is a turboprop airliner designed and built by the Nihon Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation (NAMC), a Japanese consortium. It was the only post-war airliner to be wholly designed and manufactured in Japan until the development of the Mitsubishi SpaceJet during the 2010s, roughly 50 years later.

Development of the YS-11 can be largely attributed to Japan&#x27;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which had encouraged Japanese aircraft companies to collaborate on the development of a short-haul airliner as early as 1954. In 1959, NAMC was formed to design and produce an aircraft to satisfy MITI&#x27;s requirements, dubbed the YS-11. On 30 August 1962, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. Deliveries commenced on 30 March 1965, and commercial operations began the following month. The majority of orders for the type were issued from various Japanese airlines. While sales to such customers were swift in the YS-11&#x27;s initial years of availability, this limited market soon became saturated, leading to a slump in demand.

Production of the type came to an end in 1974 as a result of efforts to increase sales to international clients, including the creation of the better YS-11A variation. In the end, the YS-11 had shown that Japan was capable of building an airliner, but NAMC had racked up a huge debt, and the type is generally regarded as a commercial failure. Large numbers of the type continued to be in service until 2006, at which point tighter Japanese aircraft regulations imposed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism necessitated either the withdrawal or refitting of all YS-11s. By 2018, only a single example reportedly remained in commercial service.

==Development and design==
===Origins===

During the mid-to-late 1950s, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) identified a requirement for a short-haul airliner to replace Douglas DC-3s flying on Japan&#x27;s domestic routes, and encouraged companies in Japan&#x27;s aircraft industry to collaborate to develop and produce a domestic airliner to meet this need. Towards this purpose, in May 1957, the &quot;Commercial Transport Design Research Association&quot; was established and the availability of government subsidies guaranteed. From the government&#x27;s viewpoint, the development of such an airliner was viewed as a key initiative towards the post-war revival of the nation&#x27;s aircraft companies, which came in addition to the serious ambition to become a major international competitor in the global airliner business. Furthermore, while this requirement had been conceived primarily in a commercial context, there was an early recognition of the value for multiple branches of the Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) to be readily able to adopt the type as well; as a philosophy, this not only extended to the prospective airliner itself, but the various technologies involved in its development and manufacture.

In response to this encouragement, during 1957, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries, Shin Meiwa, Showa Aircraft Industry Company and Japan Aircraft Industry Company was established for the purpose of developing and manufacturing the envisioned airliner. Two years later, this partnership was formalised as the &quot;Nihon Aeroplane Manufacturing Company&quot; (NAMC). The ownership of NAMC was initially divided between the Japanese government, which held 54% of the shares, while the constituent aircraft manufacturers held an 18% stake and several components/materials suppliers owned 11%; the remaining shares were small stakes belonging to various banks, insurance companies, and stock firms who chose to invest in the programme. However, NAMC was essentially a &quot;paper company&quot;, being reliant upon both personnel and infrastructure provided by its constituent manufacturers.

NAMC designed a low-winged twin-turboprop-engined monoplane, capable of seating up to 60 passengers, dubbed the &quot;YS-11&quot;. Amongst the design team was Jiro Horikoshi, who had previously been the designer of the famed wartime Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. Another prominent engineer on the project was Teruo Tojo, the second son of Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, who later became chairman of Mitsubishi Motors. The twin-engined YS-11 was projected as delivering similar operational performance to the four-engined British-built Vickers Viscount, while possessing 50% greater capacity than the similarly configured Dutch-built Fokker F27 Friendship. MITI supervised the pricing of the aircraft in order to ensure that it was competitive with the American-built Martin 4-0-4.

Although the tentative aircraft was mainly designed and manufactured in Japan, the engine selected to power the airliner was the 2,275 kW (3,050 ehp) Rolls-Royce Dart RDa.10/1 powerplant, which was both developed and produced by British-based company Rolls-Royce. Furthermore, according to author Stephen C Mercado, due to the lack of available domestic technology at the time, several of the key aircraft systems, such as cabin pressurization, were copied from foreign sources; such information was gleaned from a combination of Japanese airlines, trading companies and diplomats. Throughout the YS-11&#x27;s production lifetime, its electronic equipment, avionics, mechanical and fuselage components were supplied by a combination of Japanese companies and foreign suppliers.

===Name===
The “YS” of the YS-11 comes from a combination of the first letter sounds of the two Japanese words yusō (transport) and sekkei (design), which refer to the Association for Research on Transport Aircraft Design (Yusōki sekkei kenkyū kyōkai). Meanwhile, the first “1” of the “11” refers to the various engine candidates considered for the YS-11; the Rolls-Royce Dart RDa.10/1, which was the engine selected, had been designated “number 1.” The second “1” refers to the aircraft specification plan selected for the YS-11, which had been one among many plans that differed by wing placement and size. There had also been a “plan 0” at one point.

A catchphrase developed around the public reveal of the YS-11 mockup, which was “Let’s meet on the 11th at Sugita in Yokohama.” Here, Yokohama represented the “Y,” the Sugita neighborhood stood for the “S,” and the 11th referred both to the plane and to the date of the public reveal (December 11, 1958). Because of this, it became common to read the “11” in “YS-11” as “eleven” (jūichi in Japanese). For those involved in designing the plane, meanwhile, the designation had originally been pronounced “YS-one-one” (or YS ichi ichi).

===Into flight===
On 30 August 1962, the first prototype performed its maiden flight from Nagoya Airport; it was soon followed by the second prototype, flying on 28 December 1962. Early flight testing revealed several issues to troubleshoot, including poor steering, excessive vibration and noise. There was also an acute lack of safety during sideways maneuvers; the wake of the propeller produced abnormal forces that inclined the aircraft to the right; all of the rudders were ineffective; and the maneuverability was worst of all. These problems produced a tailspin during the flight test, and were the direct cause of a crash. This was known as the “three rudder problem.”

In one prestigious early flight of the type, All Nippon Airways used a YS-11 to carry the Olympic torch in the run-up to the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. It received its Japanese Type certificate on 25 August 1964, while American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification followed on 9 September 1965. Prior to applying for certification, the FAA had been involved in the programme at NAMC&#x27;s invitation, performing informal project reviews so that defects could be identified and eliminated early on.

During the late 1960s, a lack of significant international sales led to the programme incurring persistent losses, the outstanding debt eventually growing to $600 million. Due to the organisation of the programme, the aircraft manufacturers themselves did not have any of this debt apportioned to themselves, NAMC being held solely responsible; Mercado criticised this approach as it meant there was no incentive for the individual companies to make cost savings while simultaneously guarantee profit to them on every plane produced. Furthermore, it had been alleged that some participants saw the YS-11 as only a training programme to develop their employees&#x27; skills, rather than a serious commercial initiative; some participants chose to rotate large numbers of staff in and out of the project for brief periods before re-tasking them to work on internal projects.

Mercado claims that the programme&#x27;s operational mindset was closer to that of a military project than a commercial one, while a preoccupation with government-issued performance criteria obstructed considerations towards the actual desires of the commercial operators, such as operating costs and cabin configuration, that the YS-11 was marketed towards. As this was Japan&#x27;s first, and for a long time only, post-war airliner, NAMC lacked any staff with experience in marketing towards airlines, a disadvantage against the salesmen of rival airframers. This failure to address a crucial factor in acquiring new customers has been attributed as a major contributing cause of the programme&#x27;s poor commercial reception.

The end of the YS-11 programme was precipitated by the 1971 Smithsonian Agreement, which led to an appreciation in the value of the Japanese yen and the resulting impact upon the nation&#x27;s economy. By this point, it was clear that there was little chance that the YS-11 could ever come close to breaking even. These myriad factors contributed to the decision for production to be terminated after the completion of 182 aircraft. On 11 May 1973, the last YS-11 was delivered to the Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force (JMSDF).

==Operational history==
On 23 October 1964, the first production YS-11 conducted its first flight; it was delivered to its customer on 30 March 1965. During April 1965, initial airline operations commenced with launch customer Toa Airways. By 1968, the YS-11 programme accounted for about half of all aircraft production taking place in Japan that year. Early deliveries were mainly made to Japanese airlines, but orders for the type slowed drastically after the satisfaction of the outstanding needs of the Japanese commuter airlines for which the aircraft had been designed. Initial attempts were made to market the airliner towards various countries across Southeast Asia; at one point, the Japanese government was allegedly encouraging such sales as a form of war reparations.

Seeking to make the aircraft more attractive to the highly active North American market, NAMC decided to develop the &quot;YS-11A&quot;, a new variant which possessed a higher gross weight. During 1966, a lease agreement was signed between NAMC and Hawaiian Air Lines, a move which was hailed as the &quot;first step&quot; in the programme&#x27;s new America-focused campaign. While a number of aircraft would be sold internationally, these were often at a loss as the sales price had been set so low, deliberately as to undercut competing airliners, but paid little heed to production costs; this deficit led to losses mounting more rapidly than anticipated.

A major customer for the YS-11 was the American operator Piedmont Airlines, who had been seeking the optimal modern airliner to serve their existing routes, which mostly comprised a number of small, mountainous airports. After evaluating numerous aircraft around the world, the company determined that the Japanese airliner was the most suitable; according to Piedmont&#x27;s president, Thomas H Davis: &quot;The YS‐11 was the only one we could find which would do it on an economical basis&quot;. During October 1967, Piedmont Airlines ordered a batch of ten YS-11A-200s along with an option for an additional ten aircraft for $22.5 million. The company was so impressed by its performance, it both exercised the option for ten aircraft and purchased an additional YS-11, operating a combined fleet of 21 YS-11s by mid-1970. Piedmont would be the type&#x27;s largest international operator; ultimately, no other airline would place another order of this scale.

===End of production===

Commercial sales of the YS-11 began to stall without a stable structure in place for sales. Especially outside of Japan, the YS-11 was forced to compete with other country&#x27;s models with long-term low deferred interest payments. Nor was it rare for NAMC to have to sell the YS-11 at a discount, as this was Japan&#x27;s first commercial airliner since the end of World War II, and had no proven track record. Additionally, it was also said that there was mismanagement of the program&#x27;s cost management, as initial estimates had neglected to include the cost advertising or company administration. Moreover, because multiple companies were involved with the aircraft manufacturing, it was unclear who held ultimate responsibility, nor could the price of delivered parts be reduced. An increase in former government employees appointed to the company began to spread a culture of bureaucracy, making necessary drastic management reforms impossible and further increasing the program&#x27;s deficit.

In particular, there was deficit in sales activities outside of Japan that were a result of fundamental problems in NAMC&#x27;s administrative activities in the United States, as indicated by the Japanese government Board of Audit; this is to say nothing of the unforeseen loss due to a less favorable currency exchange that resulted after the American government switched to a floating exchange rate in 1971. When Jenks Caldwell of Charlotte Aircraft Corporation, a sales dealer of used aircraft and aviation parts headquartered in North Carolina, expressed a strong desire to become a sales agent in the United States through a modification of YS-11A, NAMC signed an exclusive agency contract with his company to manage sales for North America, Latin America and Spain. However, Charlotte Aircraft did not actually carry out the promised activities, and when a sales agreement with Piedmont Airlines was concluded with Mitsui, Charlotte Aircraft demanded damages under their status as exclusive dealer, and Piedmont Airlines and Cruzeiro do Sul handed over 33 used aircraft traded in for YS-11 to Charlotte Aircraft; Japan&#x27;s Board of Audit complained these actions were unfair. This event became a problem in the Diet, and the managing director of NAMC resigned. NAMC had no experience of selling passenger planes, and so it concluded a contract with Charlotte Aircraft without conducting an investigation into the company&#x27;s trustworthiness or business practices, nor without creating a clause in the event Charlotte Aircraft refused to conduct sales. When the contract with Charlotte Aircraft was terminated, NAMC was forced to pay 23,000,000 yen and turn over used aircraft.

In addition, any requests for a reduction in sales price or delayed payments by airlines had to be reviewed by governmental organizations like the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. It was said that there were many instances of contracts that could not be concluded due to the absence of the various ministry&#x27;s approval.

By 1994, 112 YS-11s remained in service; the lengthy service life of the type, despite the short manufacturing lifespan, has been hailed by some officials as evidence of the type being successful in some respect. The YS-11 was slowly phased out by Japanese airlines up until the early 2000s, at which point the withdrawal rate spiked in response to new directives issued by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism that required all commercial aircraft in Japan to be fitted with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS); any aircraft lacking TCAS were forced to cease operations at the end of 2006. Reportedly, equipping a YS-11 with TCAS had been estimated as costing around ¥100 million (about US$1 million), such a refit was deemed economically unsound. Those aircraft that remained in a flight-worthy condition were typically sold to foreign companies. On 30 September 2006, Japan Air Commuter Flight 3806 marked the final flight of a YS-11 within Japan&#x27;s commercial aviation industry.

In 2007, the YS-11 was added to the Mechanical Engineering Heritage of Japan as item number 13. , fifteen were operated by the Japanese military, and two in Mexico. , only eight remained in service with the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, which were being used for flight checks and other ancillary purposes. , two aircraft remain in commercial service in South America and Africa. , the Japan Air Self-Defense Force retired the YS-11 after 57 years of service.

==In popular culture==
In railroad journals, YS-11 was linked to the 0 Series Shinkansen, another Japanese-made form of transportation that debuted around the time of the 1964 Olympics. Additionally, the Shinkansen and the YS-11 were both developed by individuals who were involved with the creation of military aircraft (this was to be expected with an airplane like the YS-11, but men like Migi Tadanao and Matsudaira Tadashi were also involved with the Shinkansen).

<text>Motor learning refers broadly to changes in an organism&#x27;s movements that reflect changes in the structure and function of the nervous system. Motor learning occurs over varying timescales and degrees of complexity: humans learn to walk or talk over the course of years, but continue to adjust to changes in height, weight, strength etc. over their lifetimes. Motor learning enables animals to gain new skills, and improves the smoothness and accuracy of movements, in some cases by calibrating simple movements like reflexes. Motor learning research often considers variables that contribute to motor program formation (i.e., underlying skilled motor behaviour), sensitivity of error-detection processes, and strength of movement schemas (see motor program). Motor learning is &quot;relatively permanent&quot;, as the capability to respond appropriately is acquired and retained. Temporary gains in performance during practice or in response to some perturbation are often termed motor adaptation, a transient form of learning. Neuroscience research on motor learning is concerned with which parts of the brain and spinal cord represent movements and motor programs and how the nervous system processes feedback to change the connectivity and synaptic strengths. At the behavioral level, research focuses on the design and effect of the main components driving motor learning, i.e. the structure of practice and the feedback. The timing and organization of practice can influence information retention, e.g. how tasks can be subdivided and practiced (also see varied practice), and the precise form of feedback can influence preparation, anticipation, and guidance of movement.

== Behavioural approach ==

=== Structure of practice and contextual interference ===

Contextual interference was originally defined as &quot;function interference in learning responsible for memory improvement&quot;. Contextual interference effect is &quot;the effect on learning of the degree of functional interference found in a practice situation when several tasks must be learned and are practiced together&quot;. Variability of practice (or varied practice) is an important component to contextual interference, as it places task variations within learning. Although varied practice may lead to poor performance throughout the acquisition phase, it is important for the development of the schemata, which is responsible for the assembly and improved retention and transfer of motor learning.

Despite the improvements in performance seen across a range of studies, one limitation of the contextual interference effect is the uncertainty with regard to the cause of performance improvements as so many variables are constantly manipulated. In a review of literature, the authors identify that there were few patterns to explain the improvements in experiments that use the contextual interference paradigm. Although there were no patterns in the literature, common areas and limitations that justified interference effects were identified:

:# Although the skills being learned required whole-body movements, most tasks had a common feature; they all contained components that could be isolated.
:# Most of the studies supporting interference effect used slow movements that enabled movement adjustments during movement execution.
:# According to some authors bilateral transfer may be elicited through alternate practice conditions, as a source of information can develop from both sides of the body. Despite improvements seen in these studies, interference effects would not be attributed to their improvements, and it would have been a coincidence of task characteristics and schedule of practice. 
:# The terminology of &quot;complex skills&quot; has not been well defined. Procedural manipulations, which vary between experiments (e.g., changing the similarity between tasks) has been cited as a contributor to skill complexity.

=== Feedback given during practice ===

Feedback is regarded as a critical variable for skill acquisition and is broadly defined as any kind of sensory information related to a response or movement. Intrinsic feedback is response-produced — it occurs normally when a movement is made and the sources may be internal or external to the body. Typical sources of intrinsic feedback include vision, proprioception and audition. Extrinsic feedback is augmented information provided by an external source, in addition to intrinsic feedback. Extrinsic feedback is sometimes categorized as knowledge of performance or knowledge of results.

Several studies have manipulated the presentation features of feedback information (e.g., frequency, delay, interpolated activities, and precision) in order to determine the optimal conditions for learning. See Figure 4, Figure 6, and summary Table 1 for a detailed explanation of feedback manipulation and knowledge of results (see below).

==== Knowledge of performance ====

Knowledge of performance (KP) or kinematic feedback refers to information provided to a performer, indicating the quality or patterning of their movement. It may include information such as displacement, velocity or joint motion. KP tends to be distinct from intrinsic feedback and more useful in real-world tasks. It is a strategy often employed by coaches or rehabilitation practitioners.

==== Knowledge of results ====
Knowledge of results (KR) is defined as extrinsic or augmented information provided to a performer after a response, indicating the success of their actions with regard to an environmental goal. KR may be redundant with intrinsic feedback, especially in real-world scenarios. However, in experimental studies, it refers to information provided over and above those sources of feedback that are naturally received when a response is made (i.e., response-produced feedback; Typically, KR is also verbal or verbalizable. The impact of KR on motor learning has been well-studied and some implications are described below.

===== Experimental design and knowledge of results =====
Often, experimenters fail to separate the relatively permanent aspect of change in the capability for responding (i.e. indicative of learning) from transient effects (i.e. indicative of performance). In order to account for this, transfer designs have been created which involve two distinct phases. To visualize the transfer design, imagine a 4x4 grid. The column headings may be titled &quot;Experiment #1&quot; and &quot;Experiment #2&quot; and indicate the conditions you wish to compare. The row headings are titled &quot;Acquisition&quot; and &quot;Transfer&quot; whereby:
# The acquisition block (2 columns) contains the test conditions in which some variable is manipulated (i.e. different levels of KR applied) and different groups receive different treatments. This block represents the transient effects of KR (i.e. performance)
# The transfer block (2 columns) contains the test conditions in which that variable is held constant (i.e. a common level of KR applied; normally a no-KR condition). When presented with a no-KR condition, this block represents the persistent effects of KR (i.e. learning). Conversely, if this block is given to subjects in a format where KR is available, transient and persistent effects of KR are convoluted and it is argued not interpretable for learning effects.
After a rest period, the change in the capability for responding (i.e. effects) are argued to be those attributed to learning, and the group with the most effective performance has learned the most.

===== Functional role of knowledge of results and potential confounding of effects =====
KR seems to have many different roles, some of which can be viewed as temporary or transient (i.e. performance effects). Three of these roles include: 1) motivation, 2) associative function, and 3) guidance. The motivational influence can increase the effort and interest of the performer in the task as well as maintain this interest once KR is removed. Though important to create interest in the task for performance and learning purposes, however the extent to which it affects learning is unknown. The associative function of KR is likely to be involved in the formation of associations between stimulus and response (i.e., Law of Effect). However, this additional effect is not able to account for findings in transfer tasks manipulating the relative frequency of KR; specifically, decreasing relative frequency results in enhanced learning. For an alternate discussion on how KR may calibrate the motor system to the outside world (see schema theory in motor program). The guidance role of KR is likely the most influential to learning as both internal and external sources of feedback play a guiding role in performance of a motor task. As the performer is informed of errors in task performance, the discrepancy can be used to continually improve performance in following trials. However, the &quot;guidance hypothesis&quot; postulates that provision of too much external, augmented feedback (e.g., KR) during practice may cause the learner to develop a harmful dependency on this source of feedback. This may lead to superior performance during practice but poor performance at transfer – an indication of poor motor learning. Additionally, it implies that, as the performer improves, the conditions of KR must be adapted according to the performer&#x27;s skill and difficulty of the task in order to maximize learning (see challenge point framework).

=== Specificity of learning hypothesis ===
The specificity of learning hypothesis suggests that learning is most effective when practice sessions include environment and movement conditions which closely resemble those required during performance of the task — replicating the target skill level and context for performance.p. 194 It suggests that the benefit of specificity in practice occurs because motor learning is combined with physical practice during the learned sport or skill.p. 90 Contrary to previous beliefs, skill learning is accomplished by alternating motor learning and physical performance, making the sources of feedback work together. The learning process, especially for a difficult task, results in the creation of a representation of the task where all relevant information pertaining to task performance is integrated. This representation becomes tightly coupled with increasing experience performing the task. As a result, removing or adding a significant source of information after a practice period where it was present or not, does not cause performance to deteriorate. Alternating motor learning and physical practice can ultimately lead to a great, if not better performance as opposed to just physical practice.

== Physiological approach ==
The cerebellum and basal ganglia are critical for motor learning. As a result of the universal need for properly calibrated movement, it is not surprising that the cerebellum and basal ganglia are widely conserved across vertebrates from fish to humans.

Through motor learning the human is capable of achieving very skilled behavior, and through repetitive training a degree of automaticity can be expected. And although this can be a refined process much has been learned from studies of simple behaviors. These behaviors include eyeblink conditioning, motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex, and birdsong. Research on &quot;Aplysia californica&quot;, the sea slug, has yielded detailed knowledge of the cellular mechanisms of a simple form of learning.

A type of motor learning occurs during operation of a brain–computer interface. For example, Mikhail Lebedev, Miguel Nicolelis and their colleagues recently demonstrated cortical plasticity that resulted in incorporation of an external actuator controlled through a brain–machine interface into the subject&#x27;s neural representation.

At a cellular level, motor learning manifests itself in the neurons of the motor cortex. Using single-cell recording techniques, Dr. Emilio Bizzi and his collaborators have shown the behavior of certain cells, known as &quot;memory cells,&quot; can undergo lasting alteration with practice.

Motor learning is also accomplished on the musculoskeletal level. Each motor neuron in the body innervates one or more muscle cells, and together these cells form what is known as a motor unit. For a person to perform even the simplest motor task, the activity of thousands of these motor units must be coordinated. It appears that the body handles this challenge by organizing motor units into modules of units whose activity is correlated.

== Disordered motor learning ==

=== Developmental coordination disorder ===
Impairments associated with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) involve difficulty in learning new motor skills as well as limited postural control and deficits in sensorimotor coordination. It appears that children with DCD are not able to improve performance of complex motor tasks by practice alone. However, there is evidence that task-specific training can improve performance of simpler tasks. Impaired skills learning may be correlated with brain activity, particularly, a reduction of brain activity in regions associated with skilled motor practice.

=== Apraxia ===
Motor learning has been applied to stroke recovery and neurorehabilitation, as rehabilitation is generally a process of relearning lost skills through practice and/or training. Although rehabilitation clinicians utilize practice as a major component within an intervention, a gap remains between motor control and motor learning research and rehabilitation practice. Common motor learning paradigms include robot arm paradigms, where individuals are encouraged to resist against a hand held device throughout specific arm movements. Another important concept to motor learning is the amount practice implemented in an intervention. Studies regarding the relationship between the amount of training received and the retention of the memory a set amount of time afterwards have been a popular focus in research. It has been shown that over learning leads to major improvements in long term retention and little effect on performance. Motor learning practice paradigms have compared the differences of different practice schedules, and it has proposed that repetition of the same movements is not enough in order to relearn a skill, as it is unclear whether true brain recovery is elicited through repetition alone. It is suggested that compensation methods develop through pure repetition and to elicit cortical changes (true recovery), individuals should be exposed to more challenging tasks. Research that has implemented motor learning and rehabilitation practice has been used within the stroke population and includes arm ability training, constraint-induced movement therapy, electromyograph-triggered neuromuscular stimulation, interactive robot therapy and virtual reality-based rehabilitation. A recent study ischemic conditioning was delivered via blood pressure cuff inflation and deflation to the arm, to facilitate learning. It showed for the first time in humans and animals, that ischemic conditioning can enhance motor learning and that the enhancement is retained over time. The potential benefits of ischemic conditioning extend far beyond stroke to other neuro-, geriatric, and pediatric rehabilitation populations. These findings were featured on Global Medical Discovery news.

<doc id="487910" wikidata="Q1883898" url="?curid=487910" title="Vestibulo-ocular reflex">
<text>The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is a reflex that acts to stabilize gaze during head movement, with eye movement due to activation of the vestibular system, it is also known as the cervico-ocular reflex. The reflex acts to stabilize images on the retinas of the eye during head movement. Gaze is held steadily on a location by producing eye movements in the direction opposite that of head movement. For example, when the head moves to the right, the eyes move to the left, meaning the image a person sees stays the same even though the head has turned. Since slight head movement is present all the time, VOR is necessary for stabilizing vision: people with an impaired reflex find it difficult to read using print, because the eyes do not stabilise during small head tremors, and also because damage to reflex can cause nystagmus.

The VOR does not depend on what is seen. It can also be activated by hot or cold stimulation of the inner ear, where the vestibular system sits, and works even in total darkness or when the eyes are closed. However, in the presence of light, the fixation reflex is also added to the movement. Most features of VOR are present in kittens raised in complete darkness.

In lower animals, the organs that coordinate balance and movement are not independent from eye movement. A fish, for instance, moves its eyes by reflex when its tail is moved. Humans have semicircular canals, neck muscle &quot;stretch&quot; receptors, and the utricle (gravity organ). Though the semicircular canals cause most of the reflexes which are responsive to acceleration, the maintaining of balance is mediated by the stretch of neck muscles and the pull of gravity on the utricle (otolith organ) of the inner ear.

The VOR has both rotational and translational aspects. When the head rotates about any axis (horizontal, vertical, or torsional) distant visual images are stabilized by rotating the eyes about the same axis, but in the opposite direction. When the head translates, for example during walking, the visual fixation point is maintained by rotating gaze direction in the opposite direction, by an amount that depends on distance.

==Function==
The vestibulo-ocular reflex is driven by signals arising from the vestibular system of the inner ear. The semicircular canals detect head rotation and provide the rotational component, whereas the otoliths detect head translation and drive the translational component. The signal for the horizontal rotational component travels via the vestibular nerve through the vestibular ganglion and end in the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem. From these nuclei, fibers cross to the abducens nucleus of the opposite side of the brain. Here, fibres synapse with 2 additional pathways. One pathway projects directly to the lateral rectus muscle of the eye via the abducens nerve. Another nerve tract projects from the abducens nucleus by the medial longitudinal fasciculus to the oculomotor nucleus of the opposite side, which contains motor neurons that drive eye muscle activity, specifically activating the medial rectus muscle of the eye through the oculomotor nerve.

Another pathway (not in picture) directly projects from the vestibular nucleus through the ascending tract of Deiter&#x27;s to the medial rectus muscle motor neuron of the same side. In addition there are inhibitory vestibular pathways to the ipsilateral abducens nucleus. However no direct vestibular neuron to medial rectus motoneuron pathway exists.

Similar pathways exist for the vertical and torsional components of the VOR.

=== Oculomotor integrator ===
In addition to these direct pathways, which drive the velocity of eye rotation, there is an indirect pathway that builds up the position signal needed to prevent the eye from rolling back to center when the head stops moving. This pathway is particularly important when the head is moving slowly because here position signals dominate over velocity signals. David A. Robinson discovered that the eye muscles require this dual velocity-position drive, and also proposed that it must arise in the brain by mathematically integrating the velocity signal and then sending the resulting position signal to the motoneurons. Robinson was correct: the &#x27;neural integrator&#x27; for horizontal eye position was found in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi in the medulla, and the neural integrator for vertical and torsional eye positions was found in the interstitial nucleus of Cajal in the midbrain. The same neural integrators also generate eye position for other conjugate eye movements such as saccades and smooth pursuit.

The integrator is leaky, with a characteristic leaking time of 20 s. For example, when the subject is sitting still and focusing on an object, and suddenly the light is turned off, the eyes would return to their neutral position in around 40 seconds even as the subject is attempting to keep the focus.

===Example===
For instance, if the head is turned clockwise as seen from above, then excitatory impulses are sent from the semicircular canal on the right side via the vestibular nerve through Scarpa&#x27;s ganglion and end in the right vestibular nuclei in the brainstem. From this nuclei excitatory fibres cross to the left abducens nucleus. There they project and stimulate the lateral rectus of the left eye via the abducens nerve. In addition, by the medial longitudinal fasciculus and oculomotor nuclei, they activate the medial rectus muscles on the right eye. As a result, both eyes will turn counter-clockwise.

Furthermore, some neurons from the right vestibular nucleus directly stimulate the right medial rectus motor neurons, and inhibits the right abducens nucleus.

=== Integrated neural control ===
The VOR is controlled by a neural integrator. The neuron from each horizontal semicircular canal fires at a rate of formula_1, where formula_2 is the sensed horizontal angular velocity of the semicircular canal. The motoneuron commanding the horizontal eye muscles fires at a rate of formula_3, where formula_4 is the horizontal turning angle, and formula_5 is its horizontal angular speed. The two terms account for the elasticity and viscosity of ocular tissue.

The rotational moment of inertia of the eye is negligible, as individuals wearing weighted contact lens that increases the rotational moment of inertia almost 100-fold still has the same VOR (p. 94 ).

===Speed===
The vestibulo-ocular reflex needs to be fast: for clear vision, head movement must be compensated almost immediately; otherwise, vision corresponds to a photograph taken with a shaky hand. Signals are sent from the semicircular canals using only three neurons, called the &quot;three neuron arc&quot;. This results in eye movements that lag head movement by less than 10 ms. The vestibulo-ocular reflex is one of the fastest reflexes in the human body.

=== VOR suppression ===
When a person tracks the movement of something with both their eyes and head together, the VOR is counterproductive to the goal of keeping the gaze and head angle aligned. Research indicates that there exists mechanisms in the brain to suppress the VOR using the active visual (retinal) feedback obtained by watching the object in motion. In the absence of visual feedback, such as when the object passes behind an opaque barrier, humans can continue to visually track the apparent position of the object using anticipatory (extra-retinal) systems within the brain, and the VOR is also suppressed during this activity. The VOR can even be cognitively suppressed, such as when following an imagined target with the eyes and head together, although the effect tends to be less dramatic than with visual feedback.

===Gain===
The &quot;gain&quot; of the VOR is defined as the change in the eye angle divided by the change in the head angle during the head turn. Ideally the gain of the rotational VOR is 1.0. The gain of the horizontal and vertical VOR is usually close to 1.0, but the gain of the torsional VOR (rotation around the line of sight) is generally low. The gain of the translational VOR has to be adjusted for distance, because of the geometry of motion parallax. When the head translates, the angular direction of near targets changes faster than the angular direction of far targets.

If the gain of the VOR is wrong (different from 1)—for example, if eye muscles are weak, or if a person puts on a new pair of eyeglasses—then head movement results in image motion on the retina, resulting in blurred vision. Under such conditions, motor learning adjusts the gain of the VOR to produce more accurate eye motion. This is what is referred to as VOR adaptation.

Nearsighted people who habitually wear negative spectacles have lower VOR gain. Farsighted people or aphakes who habitually wear positive spectacle have higher VOR gain. People who habitually wear contact lens show no change in VOR gain. Monocular, disconjugate adaptation of the VOR is possible, for example, after extraocular muscle palsy. (p. 27 )

The phase of the VOR can also adapt.

=== Leak ===
The oculomotor integrator is a leaky integrator, with a characteristic leaking time of ~20 s. If the leaking time is too low, some form of adaptation occurs to &quot;patch the leak&quot; to raise the leaking time. It is hypothesized that the leaking integrator is constructed by a feedback circuit with a gain of slightly below 1, and adaptation occurs by adjusting the gain of the feedback circuit. The hypothesis is tested by using an specially patterned optokinetic drum that simulates the visual effect of having a very leaky oculomotor integrator. After 1 hour of viewing, the integrator becomes &quot;anti-leaky&quot;, meaning that its value grows exponentially even in the absence of input. The eye motion becomes positive-feedback, meaning that if it is slightly to the left of a fixation target, it would drift even further to the left, and similarly for the right. It is also accompanied by nausea. (p. 84 )

=== Disruption by ethanol ===

Ethanol consumption can disrupt the VOR, reducing dynamic visual acuity. In normal conditions, the cupula and the endolymph are equal in density (both are approximately that of water). After ingesting ethanol, the ethanol diffuses into the cupula before it diffuses into the endolymph, because it is closer to blood capillaries. This makes the cupula temporarily lighter. In this state, if a person lies down with right cheek touching the ground, then the cupula in the left ear would float towards the left, creating an illusory sense of slow left-to-right head rotation. To compensate for this, the VOR moves the eyes right-to-left slowly, until it reaches the limit, and the eyes then pull to the right rapidly (nystagmus). This is the positional alcohol nystagmus, phase I (PAN I). The unusual vestibular stimulation also caused motion sickness symptoms: illusions of bodily rotations, dizziness, and nausea. These symptoms subside in a few seconds after assuming an upright posture.

After some time, the density of cupula and endolymph equalizes, removing the nystagmus effect. After ethanol is fully metabolized, the cupula returns to normal density first, creating nystagmus in the opposite direction (PAN II) during the hangover.

As predicted, heavy water (1.1 density of water) consumption has the exact opposite nystagmus effect compared to ethanol consumption. Consuming a mixture of heavy water (formula_6) and ethanol (formula_7) largely cancels out the effect. Macroglobulinaemia, or consuming glycerol (1.26 density of water), have similar effects as heavy water.

==Clinical significance==

=== Testing ===
This reflex can be tested by the &quot;rapid head impulse test&quot; or &quot;Halmagyi–Curthoys test&quot;, in which the head is rapidly moved to the side with force, and is controlled if the eyes succeed to remain to look in the same direction. When the function of the right balance system is reduced, by a disease or by an accident, a quick head movement to the right cannot be sensed properly anymore. As a consequence, no compensatory eye movement is generated, and the patient cannot fixate a point in space during this rapid head movement.

The head impulse test can be done at the bed side and used as a screening tool for problems with a person&#x27;s vestibular system. It can also be diagnostically tested by doing a video-head impulse test (VHIT). In this diagnostic test, a person wears highly sensitive goggles that detect rapid changes in eye movement. This test can provide site-specific information on vestibular system and its function.

Another way of testing the VOR response is a caloric reflex test, which is an attempt to induce nystagmus (compensatory eye movement in the absence of head motion) by pouring cold or warm water into the ear. Also available is bi-thermal air caloric irrigations, in which warm and cool air is administered into the ear.

The vestibulo-ocular reflex can be tested by the aforementioned caloric reflex test; this plays an important part in confirming diagnosis of brainstem death. A code of practice must be followed in this process, namely that of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges.

===Cervico-ocular reflex===
Summary: Cervico-ocular reflex, also known by its acronym COR, involves the achievement of stabilization of a visual target, and image on the retina, through adjustments of gaze impacted by neck and, or head movements or rotations. The process works in conjunction with the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). It is conspicuous in certain animals that cannot move their eyes much, such as owls.

<text>Thelma Houston ( Jackson; born May 7, 1946) is an American singer. Beginning her recording career in the late 1960s, Houston scored a number-one hit in 1977 with her recording of &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;, which won the Grammy for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Houston was born in Leland, Mississippi. Her mother was a cotton picker. She and her three sisters grew up primarily in Long Beach, California. After marrying and having two children, she joined the Art Reynolds Singers gospel group and was subsequently signed as a recording artist with Dunhill Records. Despite her surname, she is unrelated to Whitney Houston.

In 1969, Houston released her debut album, entitled &quot;Sunshower&quot;, produced, arranged and composed by Jimmy Webb except for one track. In 1971 she signed with Motown Records but her early recordings with them were largely unsuccessful. Her most notable single during that period was &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Doing Wrong for So Long&quot; which peaked at No. 64 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in 1974. However Houston&#x27;s vocal prowess on that track secured her a nomination for a Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance. In 1973 Motown Productions announced a projected biographical film of Dinah Washington which would star Houston; however the project was dropped due to difficulties in getting clearance from Washington&#x27;s relatives. In April 1974, Houston joined the cast of &quot;The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine&quot;, playing various characters during the show&#x27;s skits. The show was canceled in August and for the next several years her work was limited to demo recordings and performing at small venues.

Houston took acting classes and received her first role in the 1975 made-for-television film &quot;Death Scream&quot;. In that same year Sheffield Lab released &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the Music in Me&quot; a direct-to-disc recording by Thelma Houston and Pressure Cooker that went on to become a benchmark vinyl recording for audiophiles. The following year she recorded songs for the soundtrack of the film &quot;The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings&quot; starring Billy Dee Williams and James Earl Jones. In 1975 Houston appeared on the Golden Globe Award broadcast performing the nominated song &quot;On &amp; On&quot; and also was featured in a tribute to Berry Gordy on that year&#x27;s American Music Award broadcast singing &quot;You&#x27;ve Made Me So Very Happy&quot;. That year Houston&#x27;s version of &quot;Do You Know Where You&#x27;re Going To&quot; was being set for single release when it was pulled and the song given to Diana Ross to serve as the theme song for the movie &quot;Mahogany&quot;. In 1976 Houston sang backing vocals for Motown labelmate Jermaine Jackson on his album &quot;My Name Is Jermaine&quot;.

===&quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;===

Houston released her third solo album &quot;Any Way You Like It&quot; in 1976. The first single released was her version of Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes&#x27; 1975 song &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;. In February 1977 the track hit Number 1 in the U.S. on the R&amp;B and Club Play Singles charts, then in April 1977 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; won Houston the Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance at the Grammys for 1977. Besides its US success &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; became a hit in at least twelve countries, including the UK where it reached Number 13 despite the concurrent single release of the Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes original, which reached Number 7. Also in 1977 Houston teamed up with Jerry Butler to record the album &quot;Thelma &amp; Jerry&quot; and that November 1977 she co-starred in the film &quot;Game Show Models&quot;. It was announced in February 1977 that Houston would star as Bessie Smith in a filmation of the play &quot;Me and Bessie&quot;, to be produced by Motown; after an announcement that December that Houston was set to portray Bessie Smith in a biopic to be produced in 1978 by Columbia Pictures nothing more was heard of the project.

The second single from &quot;Any Way You Like It&quot; was Houston&#x27;s rendition of &quot;If It&#x27;s the Last Thing I Do&quot;, a standard written by Saul Chaplin and Sammy Cahn; the track had been recorded and prepped for single release in 1973 but canceled. The impact of &quot;If It&#x27;s the Last Thing I Do&quot; was far less than that of &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;, as the former fell short of both the R&amp;B top ten and the Pop top 40.

===Departure from Motown===
With the lead single from her 1978 album &quot;The Devil in Me&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m Here Again&quot;, Houston returned to the style of &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; without recapturing the earlier single&#x27;s success. Houston did enjoy considerable commercial success in 1978 via the inclusion of her track &quot;Love Masterpiece&quot; on the &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&quot; soundtrack album which sold double platinum but her own album release that year &quot;Ready to Roll&quot; again failing to consolidate the stardom augured by &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;. The album&#x27;s second single: &quot;Saturday Night, Sunday Morning&quot;, gradually accrued airplay entering the national charts in March 1979 and ascending as high as #34 (#19 R&amp;B) that June. &quot;Saturday Night, Sunday Morning&quot; was issued on a new album by Houston: &quot;Ride to the Rainbow&quot; but the track&#x27;s relative success was not enough to forestall Houston&#x27;s planned departure from Motown.

===1980s===
Houston continued recording music into the 1980s, beginning with the RCA release &quot;Breakwater Cat&quot; which reunited her with Jimmy Webb who produced her debut single &quot;Sunshower&quot; and which like their earlier collaboration was a commercially overlooked critical success. During the December 22, 1984 &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine interview, Houston admitted to &quot;&#x27;no real commercial success&#x27; since the single &#x27;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&#x27; broke on the Pop charts in late 1976&quot; indicating that the disco backlash had left her with &quot;no real base of audience support&quot; and that her current album &quot;Qualifying Heat&quot;, executive produced by Houston herself, was a concentrated initiative to restore her as a viable chart presence; the album featured three cuts from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis – including the single &quot;You Used to Hold Me So Tight&quot; – and production work from Glen Ballard, Dennis Lambert, Cliff Magness and – in his first known recording work – Lenny Kravitz (then billed as Romeo Blue), who each produced a cut apiece. &quot;You Use to Hold Me So Tight&quot; became Houston&#x27;s most successful post-1970s release with a No. 13 R&amp;B peak, but its parent album was a comparative failure – charting No. 41 R&amp;B – and Houston would not cut another album for six years.

The constant ranking of her 1980s releases as moderate or minor R&amp;B hits led Houston to concentrate on alternate exposure. After appearing in the independent film &quot;The Seventh Dwarf&quot; in 1979 Houston made guest-starring appearances into the mid-1980s in several popular television programs including &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;, &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; – a January 1986 appearance that featured her performing &quot;You Used to Hold Me So Tight&quot; – and &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;. Houston also appeared in the 1987 CBS after school special &quot;Little Miss Perfect&quot; (1987) – as &quot;Prison Singer&quot; – in the 1988 film &quot;And God Created Woman&quot;.

On the May 19, 1985 NBC broadcast &quot;Motown Returns to the Apollo&quot; Houston performed &quot;What a Diff&#x27;rence a Day Makes&quot; in the guise of Dinah Washington. Houston continued to contribute to movie soundtracks, recording &quot;Keep It Light&quot; for the 1985 film &quot;Into the Night&quot; and she remade Bill Withers&#x27; &quot;Lean on Me&quot; for the 1989 film entitled &quot;Lean on Me&quot;. Houston also co-wrote and sang back-up on the song &quot;Be Yourself&quot; for Patti LaBelle&#x27;s 1989 album of the same title.

===1990s===
The Fall of 1990 saw the release of Houston&#x27;s first album in six years, &quot;Throw You Down&quot;, a long-planned collaboration with producer Richard Perry which briefly extended Houston&#x27;s career as a minor R&amp;B chart presence. The title song reached No. 5 on the U.S. dance chart. A remix of &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; was released, and once again charted on the Hot Dance Club Play chart at No. 19 in 1995. Subsequent singles include &quot;I Need Somebody Tonight&quot; and &quot;All of That&quot;.

In 1994, Houston participated in an AIDS benefit at New York&#x27;s Algonquin Hotel, performing gospel music with Phoebe Snow, Chaka Khan and CeCe Peniston as &quot;Sisters of Glory&quot;. Intended as a one-off performance troupe, the Sisters of Glory remained together – with the addition of Mavis Staples and Lois Walden, and without Chaka Khan – to perform at Woodstock &#x27;94. Houston performed with the Sisters of Glory for the Pope in Vatican City and in 1995 Houston, Phoebe Snow, CeCe Peniston, Lois Walden and Albertina Walker recorded the Warner Brothers album &quot;Good News in Hard Times&quot; as the Sisters of Glory.

Houston provided lead vocals on several tracks of guitarist Scott Henderson&#x27;s 1997 Atlantic album, &quot;Tore Down House&quot;, and in 1998 she made cameo appearances in two films: in &quot;54&quot; Houston portrayed herself singing &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; supposedly at Studio 54, and in &quot;Beloved&quot; Houston played &#x27;One of The Thirty Women&#x27;.

===Recent career===

In 2000, Houston toured successfully throughout Australia in the stage musical version of &quot;Fame&quot;. In 2002 she again guested on a Scott Henderson album, providing lead vocals for two of the tracks on &quot;Well to the Bone&quot;. Upon returning to the U.S. Houston toured with Nile Rodgers and Chic, and was among the opening acts of the originally intended finale of Cher&#x27;s &quot;Farewell Tour&quot; in Toronto on October 31, 2003. Houston regularly performs at Teatro ZinZanni in Seattle and San Francisco.

Her version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; continues to be popular today. In recent years she has been invited to sing this song on dozens of TV shows and specials including NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Motown 45&quot; and &quot;The Disco Ball...A 30-Year Celebration&quot;, and PBS&#x27; specials &quot;American Soundtrack: Rhythm, Love and Soul&quot;, &quot;Soul Superstars&quot;, and &quot;Old School Superstars&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; was mentioned by VH1 as being among the greatest dance songs in 2000, and was ranked number eighty-six on the channel&#x27;s countdown of The 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders. She won an episode of the NBC show &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot; with her renditions of her own hit and &quot;Fallin&#x27;&quot; by Alicia Keys. On September 20, 2004, Houston&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame in New York City.

On August 14, 2007, Houston released her first studio album in seventeen years, &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Touch&quot;. The album was produced by Peitor Angell and features cover versions of songs by male artists such as Luther Vandross, Marvin Gaye, and Sting that Houston had been inspired by. The first single from the album was &quot;Brand New Day&quot;. On August 20, 2007, Houston&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Qualifying Heat&quot; was reissued as an import title in the U.S. with a bonus track.

She sang &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; on &quot;American Idol&quot; on April 22, 2009, and on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; on September 16, 2009.

On July 29, 2013, a collaboration between Thelma and Los Angeles-based producer Janitor, entitled &quot;Enemy&quot;, premiered on SoundCloud. Several tracks followed, culminating in the release of an EP, &quot;Forty-Two&quot;, in September. This is the first new material from Thelma Houston in six years.

She is featured on British singer Morrissey&#x27;s single &quot;Bobby, Don&#x27;t You Think They Know?&quot;, released on streaming platforms on January 10, 2020, from his album &quot;I Am Not a Dog on a Chain&quot;.

In 2024, Houston competed in season eleven of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Clock&quot;. She made it all the way to the semifinals, and finished in third place overall. As an encore, she sang her song &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;.

<doc id="487921" wikidata="Q1517140" url="?curid=487921" title="Long-term depression">
<text>In neurophysiology, long-term depression (LTD) is an activity-dependent reduction in the efficacy of neuronal synapses lasting hours or longer following a long patterned stimulus. LTD occurs in many areas of the CNS with varying mechanisms depending upon brain region and developmental progress. 

As the opposing process to long-term potentiation (LTP), LTD is one of several processes that serves to selectively weaken specific synapses in order to make constructive use of synaptic strengthening caused by LTP. This is necessary because, if allowed to continue increasing in strength, synapses would ultimately reach a ceiling level of efficiency, which would inhibit the encoding of new information. Both LTD and LTP are forms of synaptic plasticity. 

== Characterisation ==
LTD in the hippocampus and cerebellum have been the best characterized, but there are other brain areas in which mechanisms of LTD are understood. LTD has also been found to occur in different types of neurons that release various neurotransmitters, however, the most common neurotransmitter involved in LTD is L-glutamate. L-glutamate acts on the N-methyl-D- aspartate receptors (NMDARs), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs), kainate receptors (KARs), and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) during LTD. It can result from strong synaptic stimulation (as occurs in the cerebellar Purkinje cells) or from persistent weak synaptic stimulation (as in the hippocampus). Long-term potentiation (LTP) is the opposing process to LTD; it is the long-lasting increase of synaptic strength. In conjunction, LTD and LTP are factors affecting neuronal synaptic plasticity. LTD is thought to result mainly from a decrease in postsynaptic receptor density, although a decrease in presynaptic neurotransmitter release may also play a role. Cerebellar LTD has been hypothesized to be important for motor learning. However, it is likely that other plasticity mechanisms play a role as well. Hippocampal LTD may be important for the clearing of old memory traces. 
Hippocampal/cortical LTD can be dependent on NMDA receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), or endocannabinoids. The result of the underlying-LTD molecular mechanism in cerebellum is the phosphorylation of AMPA glutamate receptors and their elimination from the surface of the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell (PF-PC) synapse.

==Neural homeostasis==

It is highly important for neurons to maintain a variable range of neuronal output. If synapses were only reinforced by positive feedback, they would eventually come to the point of complete inactivity or too much activity. To prevent neurons from becoming static, there are two regulatory forms of plasticity that provide negative feedback: metaplasticity and scaling. Metaplasticity is expressed as a change in the capacity to provoke subsequent synaptic plasticity, including LTD and LTP. The Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro model (BCM model) proposes that a certain threshold exists such that a level of postsynaptic response below the threshold leads to LTD and above it leads to LTP. BCM theory further proposes that the level of this threshold depends upon the average amount of postsynaptic activity. Scaling has been found to occur when the strength of all of a neuron’s excitatory inputs are scaled up or down. LTD and LTP coincide with metaplasticity and synaptic scaling to maintain proper neuronal network function.

==General forms of LTD==

Long-term depression can be described as either homosynaptic plasticity or heterosynaptic plasticity. Homosynaptic LTD is restricted to the individual synapse that is activated by a low frequency stimulus. In other words, this form of LTD is activity-dependent, because the events causing the synaptic weakening occur at the same synapse that is being activated. Homosynaptic LTD is also associative in that it correlates the activation of the postsynaptic neuron with the firing of the presynaptic neuron. Heterosynaptic LTD, in contrast, occurs at synapses that are not potentiated or are inactive. The weakening of a synapse is independent of the activity of the presynaptic or postsynaptic neurons as a result of the firing of a distinct modulatory interneuron. Thus, this form of LTD impacts synapses nearby those receiving action potentials.

==Mechanisms that weaken synapses==

===Hippocampus===

LTD affects hippocampal synapses between the Schaffer collaterals and the CA1 pyramidal cells. LTD at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses depends on the timing and frequency of calcium influx. LTD occurs at these synapses when Schaffer collaterals are stimulated repetitively for extended time periods (10–15 minutes) at a low frequency (approximately 1 Hz). Depressed excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) result from this particular stimulation pattern. The magnitude of calcium signal in the postsynaptic cell largely determines whether LTD or LTP occurs. NMDA-receptor dependent LTD is induced by moderate rises in postsynaptic calcium levels. The threshold level in area CA1 is on a sliding scale that depends on the history of the synapse. If the synapse has already been subject to LTP, the threshold is raised, increasing the probability that a calcium influx will yield LTD. In this way, a &quot;negative feedback&quot; system maintains synaptic plasticity. Activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors, which belong to a class of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), is required for calcium entry into the CA1 postsynaptic cell. Change in voltage provides a graded control of postsynaptic Ca2+ by regulating NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ influx, which is responsible for initiating LTD.

While LTP is in part due to the activation of protein kinases, which subsequently phosphorylate target proteins, LTD arises from activation of calcium-dependent phosphatases that dephosphorylate the target proteins. Selective activation of these phosphatases by varying calcium levels might be responsible for the different effects of calcium observed during LTD. The activation of postsynaptic phosphatases causes internalization of synaptic AMPA receptors (also a type of iGluRs) into the postsynaptic cell by clathrin-coated endocytosis mechanisms, thereby reducing sensitivity to glutamate released by Schaffer collateral terminals.

=== Cerebellum ===

LTD occurs at synapses in cerebellar Purkinje neurons, which receive two forms of excitatory input, one from a single climbing fiber and one from hundreds of thousands of parallel fibers. LTD decreases the efficacy of parallel fiber synapse transmission, though, according to recent findings, it also impairs climbing fiber synapse transmission. Both parallel fibers and climbing fibers must be simultaneously activated for LTD to occur. With respect to calcium release however, it is best if the parallel fibers are activated a few hundred milliseconds before the climbing fibres. In one pathway, parallel fiber terminals release glutamate to activate AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic Purkinje cell. When glutamate binds to the AMPA receptor, the membrane depolarizes. Glutamate binding to the metabotropic receptor activates phospholipase C (PLC) and produces diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) second messengers. In the pathway initiated by activation of climbing fibers, calcium enters the postsynaptic cell through voltage-gated ion channels, raising intracellular calcium levels. Together, DAG and IP3 augment the calcium concentration rise by targeting IP3-sensitive receptors triggering release of calcium from intracellular stores as well as protein kinase C (PKC) activation (which is accomplished jointly by calcium and DAG). PKC phosphorylates AMPA receptors, which promotes their dissociation from scaffold proteins in the post-synaptic membrane and subsequent internalization. With the loss of AMPA receptors, the postsynaptic Purkinje cell response to glutamate release from parallel fibers is depressed. Calcium triggering in the cerebellum is a critical mechanism involved in long-term depression. Parallel fibre terminals and climbing fibres work together in a positive feedback loop for invoking high calcium release. LTD is involved in predictive control exerted by cerebellar circuitry and cerebellar reserve. 

==== Ca2+ involvement ====
Further research has determined calcium&#x27;s role in long-term depression induction. While other mechanisms of long-term depression are being investigated, calcium&#x27;s role in LTD is a defined and well understood mechanism by scientists. High calcium concentrations in the post-synaptic Purkinje cells is a necessity for the induction of long-term depression. There are several sources of calcium signaling that elicit LTD: climbing fibres and parallel fibres which converge onto Purkinje cells. Calcium signaling in the post-synaptic cell involved both spatial and temporal overlap of climbing fibre induced calcium release into dendrites as well as parallel fibre induced mGluRs and IP3 mediated calcium release. In the climbing fibres, AMPAR-mediated depolarization induces a regenerative action potential that spreads to the dendrites, which is generated by voltage-gated calcium channels. Paired with PF-mediated mGluR1 activation results in LTD induction. In the parallel fibres, GluRs are activated by constant activation of the parallel fibres which indirectly induces the IP3 to bind to its receptor (IP3) and activate calcium release from intracellular storage. In calcium induction, there is a positive feedback loop to regenerate calcium for long-term depression. Climbing and parallel fibres must be activated together to depolarize the Purkinje cells while activating mGlur1s. Timing is a critical component to CF and PF as well, a better calcium release involves PF activation a few hundred milliseconds before CF activity.

==== AMPAR phosphorylation ====
There is a series of signaling cascades, MAPK, in the cerebellum that plays a critical role in cerebellum LTD. The MAPK cascade is important in information processing within neurons and other various types of cells. The cascade includes MAPKKK, MAPKK, and MAPK. Each is dual phosphorylated by the other, MAPKKK dual phosphorylates MAPKK and in turn dual phosphorylates MAPK. There is a positive feedback loop that results from a simultaneous input of signals from PF-CF and increases DAG and Ca2+ in Purkinje dendritic spines. Calcium and DAG activate conventional PKC (cPKC), which then activates MAPKKK and the rest of the MAPK cascade. Activated MAPK and Ca2+ activate PLA2, AA and cPKC creating a positive feedback loop. Induced cPKC phosphorylates AMPA receptors and are eventually removed from the postsynaptic membrane via endocytosis. The timescale is for this process is approximately 40 minutes. Overall, the magnitude of the LTD correlates with AMPAR phosphorylation.

===Striatum===

The mechanisms of LTD differ in the two subregions of the striatum. LTD is induced at corticostriatal medium spiny neuron synapses in the dorsal striatum by a high frequency stimulus coupled with postsynaptic depolarization, coactivation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors and group I mGlu receptors, lack of NMDA receptor activation, and endocannabinoid activation.

In the prelimbic cortex of the striatum, three forms or LTD have been established. The mechanism of the first is similar to CA1-LTD: a low frequency stimulus induces LTD by activation of NMDA receptors, with postsynaptic depolarization and increased postsynaptic calcium influx. The second is initiated by a high frequency stimulus and is arbitrated by presynaptic mGlu receptor 2 or 3, resulting in a long term reduction in the involvement of P/Q-type calcium channels in glutamate release. The third form of LTD requires endocannabinoids, activation of mGlu receptors and repetitive stimulation of glutamatergic fibers (13 Hz for ten minutes), resulting in a long-term decrease in presynaptic glutamate release. It is proposed that LTD in GABAergic striatal neurons leads to a long-term decrease in inhibitory effects on the basal ganglia, influencing the storage of motor skills.

===Visual cortex===

Long-term depression has also been observed in the visual cortex, and it is proposed to be involved in ocular dominance. Recurring low-frequency stimulation of layer IV of the visual cortex or the white matter of the visual cortex causes LTD in layer III. In this form of LTD, low-frequency stimulation of one pathway results in LTD only for that input, making it homosynaptic. This type of LTD is similar to that found in the hippocampus, because it is triggered by a small elevation in postsynaptic calcium ions and activation of phosphatases. LTD has also been found to occur in this fashion in layer II. A different mechanism is at work in the LTD that occurs in layer V. In layer V, LTD requires low frequency stimulation, endocannabinoid signaling, and activation of presynaptic NR2B-containing NMDA receptors.

It has been found that paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) induces a form of homosynaptic LTD in the superficial layers of the visual cortex when the synapse is exposed to carbachol (CCh) and norepinephrine (NE).

The magnitude of this LTD is comparable to that which results from low frequency stimulation, but with fewer stimulation pulses (40 PPS for 900 low frequency stimulations). It is suggested that the effect of NE is to control the gain of NMDA receptor-dependent homosynaptic LTD. Like norepinephrine, acetylcholine is proposed to control the gain of NMDA receptor-dependent homosynaptic LTD, but it is likely to be a promoter of additional LTD mechanisms as well.

===Prefrontal cortex===

The neurotransmitter serotonin is involved in LTD induction in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The serotonin system in the PFC plays an important role in regulating cognition and emotion. Serotonin, in cooperation with a group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, facilitates LTD induction through augmentation of AMPA receptor internalization. This mechanism possibly underlies serotonin&#x27;s role in the control of cognitive and emotional processes that synaptic plasticity in PFC neurons mediates.

===Perirhinal cortex===

Computational models predict that LTD creates a gain in recognition memory storage capacity over that of LTP in the perirhinal cortex, and this prediction is confirmed by neurotransmitter receptor blocking experiments. It is proposed that there are multiple memory mechanisms in the perirhinal cortex. The exact mechanisms are not completely understood, however pieces of the mechanisms have been deciphered. Studies suggest that one perirhinal cortex LTD mechanism involves NMDA receptors and group I and II mGlu receptors 24 hours after the stimulus. The other LTD mechanism involves acetylcholine receptors and kainate receptors at a much earlier time, about 20 to 30 minutes after stimulus.

==Role of endocannabinoids==

Endocannabinoids affect long-lasting plasticity processes in various parts of the brain, serving both as regulators of pathways and necessary retrograde messengers in specific forms of LTD. In addition, LTD and LTP initiated by endocannabinoids are often expressed at the presynaptic level due to the retrograde nature of endocannabinoids. In regard to retrograde signaling, cannabinoid receptors function widely throughout the brain in presynaptic inhibition. Endocannabinoid retrograde signaling has been shown to effect LTD at corticostriatal synapses and glutamatergic synapses in the prelimbic cortex of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and it is also involved in spike-timing-dependent LTD in the visual cortex. Although endocannabinoid retrograde signaling has been shown to effect glutamatergic synapses, it can also effect GABAergic synapses with either hetero- or homosynaptic interactions. Endocannabinoids are implicated in LTD of inhibitory inputs (LTDi) within the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) as well as in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampus. Additionally, endocannabinoids play an important role in regulating various forms of synaptic plasticity. They are involved in inhibition of LTD at parallel fiber Purkinje neuron synapses in the cerebellum and NMDA receptor-dependent LTD in the hippocampus. 

==Spike timing-dependent plasticity==

Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) refers to the timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic action potentials. STDP is a form of neuroplasticity in which a millisecond-scale change in the timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes will cause differences in postsynaptic Ca2+ signals, inducing either LTP or LTD. LTD occurs when postsynaptic spikes precede presynaptic spikes by up to 20-50 ms. Whole-cell patch clamp experiments &quot;in vivo&quot; indicate that post-leading-pre spike delays elicit synaptic depression.
LTP is induced when neurotransmitter release occurs 5-15 ms before a back-propagating action potential, whereas LTD is induced when the stimulus occurs 5-15 ms after the back-propagating action potential. There is a plasticity window: if the presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes are too far apart (i.e., more than 15 ms apart), there is little chance of plasticity. The possible window for LTD is wider than that for LTP – although it is important to note that this threshold depends on synaptic history.

When postsynaptic action potential firing occurs prior to presynaptic afferent firing, both presynaptic endocannabinoid (CB1) receptors and NMDA receptors are stimulated at the same time. Postsynaptic spiking alleviates the Mg2+ block on NMDA receptors. The postsynaptic depolarization will subside by the time an EPSP occurs, enabling Mg2+ to return to its inhibitory binding site. Thus, the influx of Ca2+ in the postsynaptic cell is reduced. CB1 receptors detect postsynaptic activity levels via retrograde endocannabinoid release.

STDP selectively enhances and consolidates specific synaptic modifications (signals), while depressing global ones (noise). This results in a sharpened signal-to-noise ratio in human cortical networks that facilitates the detection of relevant signals during information processing in humans.

== Astrocyte Aid in LTD ==
Previous research has strictly focused on the aspects of neuronal LTD, however, emerging studies have shown astrocyte contribution to LTD in tripartite synapses. Through release of gliotransmitters, astrocytes are able to modulate synaptic activity when extracellular calcium levels rise. Astrocytes are experimentally shown to be involved with NMDA receptor dependent LTD in the somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and VTA by releasing glutamate or D-serine (as gliotransmitters) post-endocannabinoid interaction. Studies have shown that astrocytes are required for STDP, as they are able to reuptake glutamate from synapses (passively) and exchanging molecules within synapses such as releasing ATP to increase the adenosine levels in synapses to prevent LTD and produce LTP. Some forms of STDP that occur with NMDA receptors and mGluRs have shown that astrocyte cooperation is necessary, especially on the synapses of parallel fibers onto Purkinje cells.

==Motor learning and memory==

Long-term depression has long been hypothesized to be an important mechanism behind motor learning and memory. Cerebellar LTD is thought to lead to motor learning, and hippocampal LTD is thought to contribute to the decay of memory. However, recent studies have found that hippocampal LTD may not act as the reverse of LTP, but may instead contribute to spatial memory formation. Although LTD is now well characterized, these hypotheses about its contribution to motor learning and memory remain controversial.

Studies have connected deficient cerebellar LTD with impaired motor learning. In one study, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 mutant mice maintained a normal cerebellar anatomy but had weak LTD and consequently impaired motor learning. However the relationship between cerebellar LTD and motor learning has been seriously challenged. A study on rats and mice proved that normal motor learning occurs while LTD of Purkinje cells is prevented by (1R-1-benzo thiophen-5-yl-2[2-diethylamino)-ethoxy] ethanol hydrochloride (T-588). Likewise, LTD in mice was disrupted using several experimental techniques with no observable deficits in motor learning or performance. These taken together suggest that the correlation between cerebellar LTD and motor learning may have been illusory.

Studies on rats have made a connection between LTD in the hippocampus and memory. In one study, rats were exposed to a novel environment, and homosynaptic plasticity (LTD) in CA1 was observed. After the rats were brought back to their initial environment, LTD activity was lost. It was found that if the rats were exposed to novelty, the electrical stimulation required to depress synaptic transmission was of lower frequency than without novelty. When the rat was put in a novel environment, acetylcholine was released in the hippocampus from the medial septum fiber, resulting in LTD in CA1. Therefore, it has been concluded that acetylcholine facilitates LTD in CA1.

LTD has been correlated with spatial learning in rats, and it is crucial in forming a complete spatial map. It suggested that LTD and LTP work together to encode different aspects of spatial memory. 

New evidence suggests that LTP works to encode space, whereas LTD works to encode the features of space. Specifically, it is accepted that encoding of experience takes place on a hierarchy. Encoding of new space is the priority of LTP, while information about orientation in space could be encoded by LTD in the dentate gyrus, and the finer details of space could be encoded by LTD in the CA1.

===Cocaine as a model of LTD in drug addiction===

The addictive property of cocaine is believed to occur in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). After chronic cocaine use, the amount of AMPA receptors relative to NMDA receptors decreases in the medium spiny neurons in the NAc shell. This decrease in AMPA receptors is thought to occur through the same mechanism as NMDAR-dependent LTD, because this form of plasticity is reduced after cocaine use. After, the amount of AMPA receptors is ramped up in the NAc neurons during withdrawal. This is possibly due to homeostatic synaptic scaling. This increase in AMPA receptors causes a hyperexcitability in the NAc neurons (GABAergic MSNs). This leads to an increase of GABA release by projections from the NAc to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), making the dopaminergic neurons in the VTA less likely to fire, and thus resulting in the symptoms of withdrawal.

=== Alcohol as a model of LTD in Plasticity ===
In terms of addiction, alcohol has a similar effect on our brains as other drugs do, making the user feel pleasure or negate the user&#x27;s negative state of mind (if present). The cycle of consuming alcohol can lead to alcohol addiction, and eventually alcohol use disorder (AUD). Studies show that NMDA receptors role in learning can be hindered by alcohol in three major regions: dorsal striatum, neocortex, and hippocampus. In particular, these studies show that LTD due to alcohol is found in the dorsal striatum and the hippocampus, with deficits in the neocortex being caused by white and grey-matter degradation. Although LTD in the dorsal striatum was found when exposed to high frequency stimulation, a simulation of alcohol tolerance and withdrawal resulted in LTP in the same region. The main consensus when researching the alcohol and its effects on the hippocampus is that of which LTP is inhibited and LTD is produced. Specifically, LTD was found after activation of NMDA receptors in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, with evidence that an inhibition of glutamatergic interactions cause the hippocampal deficits.

==Current research==

Research on the role of LTD in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD) is ongoing. It has been suggested that a reduction in NMDAR-dependent LTD may be due to changes not only in postsynaptic AMPARs but also in NMDARs, and these changes are perhaps present in early and mild forms of Alzheimer-type dementia.

Additionally, researchers have recently discovered a new mechanism (which involves LTD) linking soluble amyloid beta protein (Aβ) with the synaptic injury and memory loss related to AD. While Aβ&#x27;s role in LTD regulation has not been clearly understood, it has been found that soluble Aβ facilitates hippocampal LTD and is mediated by a decrease in glutamate recycling at hippocampal synapses. Excess glutamate is a proposed contributor to the progressive neuronal loss involved in AD. Evidence that soluble Aβ enhances LTD through a mechanism involving altered glutamate uptake at hippocampal synapses has important implications for the initiation of synaptic failure in AD and in types of age-related Aβ accumulation. This research provides a novel understanding of the development of AD and proposes potential therapeutic targets for the disease. Further research is needed to understand how soluble amyloid beta protein specifically interferes with glutamate transporters.

In relation to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, the structural protein Tau, has been found to have certain effects on LTD. Although an argument is made that Tau is only found in axons as a structural supporter, and the misfolding of it progresses the pathophysiology of AD, there has been compelling evidence that shows Tau is also found in dendrites. One of the post translational modifications (PTMs) of Tau is phosphorylation, which the protein is reliant on to fold into its correct states -- meaning hyperphosphorylation (part of the pathophysiology of AD) can change folding dynamics and damage neurons. Although the full mechanism has not been discovered, it has been found that hyperphosphorylation in Tau has been seen to weaken synapses and facilitates LTD by aggregation. Furthermore, comparing different sizes of aggregate Tau oligomers had no difference in effect as they all inhibited LTP and facilitated LTD. 

In the field of research of cerebellum disorders, auto-antigens are involved in molecular cascades for induction of LTD of synaptic transmissions between parallel fibers (PFs) and Purkinje cells (PCs), a mechanism of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum. Anti-VGCC, anti-mGluR1, and anti-GluR delta Abs-associated cerebellar ataxias share one common pathophysiological mechanism: a deregulation in PF-PC LTD. This causes an impairment of restoration or maintenance of the internal model hold by the cerebellum and triggers cerebellar ataxias. These diseases are LTDpathies.

The mechanism of long-term depression has been well characterized in limited parts of the brain. However, the way in which LTD affects motor learning and memory is still not well understood. Determining this relationship is presently one of the major focuses of LTD research.

=== Neurodegeneration ===

Neurodegenerative diseases research remains inconclusive as to the mechanisms that triggers the degeneration in the brain. New evidence demonstrates there are similarities between the apoptotic pathway and LTD which involves the phosphorylation/activation of GSK3β. NMDAR-LTD(A) contributes to the elimination of excess synapses during development. This process is downregulated after synapses have stabilized, and is regulated by GSK3β. During neurodegeneration, there is the possibility that there is deregulation of GSK3β resulting in &#x27;synaptic pruning&#x27;. If there is excess removal of synapses, this illustrates early signs of neurodegeration and a link between apoptosis and neurodegeneration diseases.

<text>The neocortex, also called the neopallium, isocortex, or the six-layered cortex, is a set of layers of the mammalian cerebral cortex involved in higher-order brain functions such as sensory perception, cognition, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning and language. The neocortex is further subdivided into the true isocortex and the proisocortex.

In the human brain, the cerebral cortex consists of the larger neocortex and the smaller allocortex, respectively taking up 90% and 10%. The neocortex is made up of six layers, labelled from the outermost inwards, I to VI.

== Etymology == 
The term is from &quot;cortex&quot;, Latin, &quot;bark&quot; or &quot;rind&quot;, combined with &quot;neo-&quot;, Greek, &quot;new&quot;. &quot;Neopallium&quot; is a similar hybrid, from Latin &quot;pallium&quot;, &quot;cloak&quot;. &quot;Isocortex&quot; and &quot;allocortex&quot; are hybrids with Greek &quot;isos&quot;, &quot;same&quot;, and &quot;allos&quot;, &quot;other&quot;.

==Anatomy==
The neocortex is the most developed in its organisation and number of layers, of the cerebral tissues. The neocortex consists of the grey matter, or neuronal cell bodies and unmyelinated fibers, surrounding the deeper white matter (myelinated axons) in the cerebrum. This is a very thin layer though, about 2–4 mm thick. There are two types of cortex in the neocortex, the proisocortex and the true isocortex. The pro-isocortex is a transitional area between the true isocortex and the periallocortex (part of the allocortex). It is found in the cingulate cortex (part of the limbic system), in Brodmann&#x27;s areas 24, 25, 30 and 32, the insula and the parahippocampal gyrus.

Of all the mammals studied to date (including humans), a species of oceanic dolphin known as the long-finned pilot whale has been found to have the most neocortical neurons.

===Geometry===

The neocortex is smooth in rodents and other small mammals, whereas in elephants, dolphins and primates and other larger mammals it has deep grooves (sulci) and ridges (gyri). These folds allow the surface area of the neocortex to be greatly increased. All human brains have the same overall pattern of main gyri and sulci, although they differ in detail from one person to another. The mechanism by which the gyri form during embryogenesis is not entirely clear, and there are several competing hypotheses that explain gyrification, such as axonal tension, cortical buckling or differences in cellular proliferation rates in different areas of the cortex.

===Layers===

The neocortex contains both excitatory (~80%) and inhibitory (~20%) neurons, named for their effect on other neurons. The human neocortex consists of hundreds of different types of cells. The structure of the neocortex is relatively uniform (hence the alternative names &quot;iso-&quot; and &quot;homotypic&quot; cortex), consisting of six horizontal layers segregated principally by cell type and neuronal connections. However, there are many exceptions to this uniformity; for example, layer IV is small or missing in the primary motor cortex. There is some canonical circuitry within the cortex; for example, pyramidal neurons in the upper layers II and III project their axons to other areas of neocortex, while those in the deeper layers V and VI often project out of the cortex, e.g. to the thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord. Neurons in layer IV receive the majority of the synaptic connections from outside the cortex (mostly from thalamus), and themselves make short-range, local connections to other cortical layers. Thus, layer IV is the main recipient of incoming sensory information and distributes it to the other layers for further processing.

===Cortical columns===

The neocortex is often described as being arranged in vertical structures called cortical columns, patches of neocortex with a diameter of roughly 0.5 mm (and a depth of 2 mm, i.e., spanning all six layers). These columns are often thought of as the basic repeating functional units of the neocortex, but their many definitions, in terms of anatomy, size, or function, are generally not consistent with each other, leading to a lack of consensus regarding their structure or function or even whether it makes sense to try to understand the neocortex in terms of columns.

== Function ==
The neocortex is derived embryonically from the dorsal telencephalon, which is the rostral part of the forebrain. The neocortex is divided into regions demarcated by the cranial sutures in the skull above, into frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, which perform different functions. For example, the occipital lobe contains the primary visual cortex, and the temporal lobe contains the primary auditory cortex. Further subdivisions or areas of neocortex are responsible for more specific cognitive processes. In humans, the frontal lobe contains areas devoted to abilities that are enhanced in or unique to our species, such as complex language processing localized to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (Broca&#x27;s area). In humans and other primates, social and emotional processing is localized to the orbitofrontal cortex.

The neocortex has also been shown to play an influential role in sleep, memory and learning processes. Semantic memories appear to be stored in the neocortex, specifically the anterolateral temporal lobe of the neocortex. It is also involved in instrumental conditioning; responsible for transmitting sensory information and information about plans for movement to the basal ganglia. The firing rate of neurons in the neocortex also has an effect on slow-wave sleep. When the neurons are at rest and are hyperpolarizing, a period of inhibition occurs during a slow oscillation, called the down state. When the neurons of the neocortex are in the excitatory depolarizing phase and are firing briefly at a high rate, a period of excitation occurs during a slow oscillation, called the up state.

==Clinical significance==
Lesions that develop in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, interrupt the transfer of information from the sensory neocortex to the prefrontal neocortex. This disruption of sensory information contributes to the progressive symptoms seen in neurodegenerative disorders such as changes in personality, decline in cognitive abilities, and dementia. Damage to the neocortex of the anterolateral temporal lobe results in semantic dementia, which is the loss of memory of factual information (semantic memories). These symptoms can also be replicated by transcranial magnetic stimulation of this area. If damage is sustained to this area, patients do not develop anterograde amnesia and are able to recall episodic information.

==Evolution==

The neocortex is the newest part of the cerebral cortex to evolve (hence the prefix &quot;neo&quot; meaning new); the other part of the cerebral cortex is the allocortex. The cellular organization of the allocortex is different from the six-layered neocortex. In humans, 90% of the cerebral cortex and 76% of the entire brain is neocortex.

For a species to develop a larger neocortex, the brain must evolve in size so that it is large enough to support the region. Body size, basal metabolic rate and life history are factors affecting brain evolution and the coevolution of neocortex size and group size. The neocortex increased in size in response to pressures for greater cooperation and competition in early ancestors. With the size increase, there was greater voluntary inhibitory control of social behaviors resulting in increased social harmony.

The six-layer cortex appears to be a distinguishing feature of mammals; it has been found in the brains of all mammals, but not in any other animals. There is some debate, however, as to the cross-species nomenclature for &quot;neocortex&quot;. In avians, for instance, there are clear examples of cognitive processes that are thought to be neocortical in nature, despite the lack of the distinctive six-layer neocortical structure. Evidence suggest the avian pallium to be broadly equivalent to the mammalian neocortex. In a similar manner, reptiles, such as turtles, have primary sensory cortices. A consistent, alternative name has yet to be agreed upon.

==Neocortex ratio==
The neocortex ratio of a species is the ratio of the size of the neocortex to the rest of the brain. A high neocortex ratio is thought to correlate with a number of social variables such as group size and the complexity of social mating behaviors. Humans have a large neocortex as a percentage of total brain matter when compared with other mammals. For example, there is only a 30:1 ratio of neocortical gray matter to the size of the medulla oblongata in the brainstem of chimpanzees, while the ratio is 60:1 in humans.

<doc id="487923" wikidata="Q1484219" url="?curid=487923" title="Single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line">
<text>Single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line (SHDSL) is a form of symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL), a data communications technology for equal transmit and receive (i.e. symmetric) data rate over copper telephone lines, faster than a conventional voiceband modem can provide. As opposed to other DSL technologies, SHDSL employs trellis-coded pulse-amplitude modulation (TC-PAM). As a baseband transmission scheme, TC-PAM operates at frequencies that include those used by the analog voice plain old telephone service (POTS). As such, a frequency splitter, or DSL filter, cannot be used to allow a telephone line to be shared by both an SHDSL service and a POTS service at the same time. Support of symmetric data rates made SHDSL a popular choice by businesses for private branch exchange (PBX), virtual private network (VPN), web hosting and other data services.

SHDSL features symmetrical data rates in both the upstream and downstream directions, from 192 kbit/s to 2,312 kbit/s of payload in 8 kbit/s increments for one pair and 384 kbit/s to 4,624 kbit/s in 16 kbit/s increments for two pairs of wires. The reach varies according to the loop rate and noise conditions (more noise or higher rate means decreased reach) and may be up to 3,000 meters. The two pair feature may alternatively be used for increased reach applications by keeping the data rate low. Halving the data rate per pair will provide similar speeds to single pair lines while increasing the error/noise tolerance.

With the 32-TC-PAM modulation scheme described in Annexes F and G, symmetric data rates of up to 5,696 kbit/s are permitted on one pair in the optional extended SHDSL mode. Up to four pairs of wires may be bonded using M-pair bonding to produce data rates as high as M5,696 kbit/s. By using four bonded wire pairs, a single SHDSL interface can transmit up to 22,784 kbit/s.

The SHDSL payload may be either &#x27;clear channel&#x27; (unstructured), T1 or E1 (full rate or fractional), multiple ISDN Basic Rate Interface (BRI), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cells or Ethernet packets. A &#x27;dual bearer&#x27; mode allows a mixture of two separate streams (e.g. T1 and ATM) to share the SHDSL bandwidth.

==SHDSL standards==

The industry standard for SHDSL is defined by ITU-T recommendation G.991.2. This was first published in February 2001. SHDSL equipment is also known by the standard&#x27;s draft name of G.SHDSL. Major updates to G.991.2 were released in December 2003. Equipment conforming to the 2003 version of G.991.2 is often referred to by the standard&#x27;s draft name of G.SHDSL.bis or just SHDSL.bis. The updated G.991.2 features:
* Optional support for up to four copper pair connections (M-pair)
* Optional extensions to allow user data rates up to 5696 kbit/s per pair, described in Annexes F and G
* Optional support for dynamic rate repartitioning, allowing flexible change of the SHDSL data rate without service interruption, described in Annex E.10.3
* New payload definitions including Ethernet packet transfer mode (PTM), described in Annex E.11

SHDSL supersedes the older HDSL symmetric DSL technology defined in ITU-T G.991.1. SHDSL has largely been replaced by VDSL2 because of greater bandwidth, less interference and greater utilization.

In Europe, a variant of SHDSL was standardized by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) using the name &#x27;SDSL&#x27;. This ETSI variant is compatible with the ITU-T SHDSL standardized regional variant for Europe and must not be confused with the usage of the term SDSL in North America to refer to symmetric digital subscriber line.

<doc id="487928" wikidata="Q5977128" url="?curid=487928" title="I Feel Sick">
<text>I Feel Sick is a comic book created by artist Jhonen Vasquez, with colors by Rosearik Rikki Simons. Published in August 1999 through May 2000, it is a spin-off of Vasquez&#x27;s comic book series Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. I Feel Sick revolves around Devi D, a graphic designer who must face the same supernatural and psychological forces that drove Johnny C. to lunacy.

Published by Slave Labor Graphics, it was originally intended as a single paperback but was split into two issues. Vasquez said the creation process of I Feel Sick was cathartic. Devi&#x27;s problems working for Nerve Publishing and neglecting her own work are reminiscent of the peer pressure Vasquez experienced working on &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, an animated television series he created for Nickelodeon.

==Issue 1==
The first issue is published through Slave Labor Graphics in November 1999. It is later republished with paperback. 

=== Summary ===
The series begins as Devi attempts to destroy her own painting, but finds the painting untouched afterward. Tenna, her neighbor and friend, comes upstairs to check on her. This leads to a flashback about a date Devi had with a boy named Eddie. After the two fail to connect, Devi asks to go home and Eddie makes a forceful move on her while driving. The two crash into a tree where they are trapped in the car. Eddie has lost an eye and has glass shards inside of his brain. The only thing keeping him alive is the thought he still has a chance of sleeping with Devi. They are trapped in his car overnight until Eddie is eventually killed by a deployed airbag.

The flashback ends and Devi explains that the painting was one she never finished, and it has started talking to her. She has nicknamed the painting &quot;Sickness,&quot; and the only way to silence it is by working. Tenna suggests that she is just working too hard, but Devi believes supernatural forces are interfering with her painting, and past experiences have given her good reason to isolate herself. She tells a story about another date with a man who defecated himself at the dinner table (as seen in Issue 2 of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac). In another flashback, Devi is approached in a nightclub by a man dressed as a vampire. He tells her about his strange obsession with vampires. When he uses a smoke bomb to dramatically leave the conversation, he sets himself on fire. On another date, Devi joked about her date being a zombie, and he bites a waiter&#x27;s brain out of his skull.

Tenna is still unconvinced and asks why the &quot;spooky painting&quot; wants to make her go insane. Devi doesn&#x27;t know, but ever since she started a new freelance job, things have gotten worse. Constant distractions stop her from painting, like phone calls and people coming over. Even Tenna has become a huge distraction, and Devi asks her to leave.

Alone now, Devi asks the painting what it wants and why it&#x27;s distracting her from her work. The painting says it&#x27;s simply a voice in her head and not to bother fighting. It and its colleagues are professionals who have done this before. Devi vows to work as hard as she can until the painting dries up, and she stops talking. However, she accidentally injures her hands, meaning she can no longer paint to fight Sickness.

==Issue 2 ==
The second issue is first published through Slave Labor Graphics in January 2000, then experienced republishings through Slave Labor Graphics from 2003 to 2004. The latest edition (sixth edition) is published with paperback through SLG Publishing in January 2008. 

=== Summary ===
Devi promises to fight Sickness even without using her hands. Sickness says she is not the first person to catch them, one being the person who introduced the force to her. Devi realizes she is late for a meeting about a job illustrating a children&#x27;s book and rushes to meet her eccentric new boss, Mr. Nerves. He orders several outlandish changes to her painting for the book. During his lecture, Devi has a flashback to her date with Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. While overlooking the town, Johnny asks what happens when someone loses their defining trait, in this case, Johnny&#x27;s ability to paint.

After connecting Johnny&#x27;s story with her own, Devi quits her job and rushes home, determined to beat Sickness. Several distractions in her apartment&#x27;s hallway hinder her progress, and her morbidly obese neighbor blocks the hallway. Devi attempts to squeeze by and gets trapped. She hears a voice that claims to be the neighbor&#x27;s fat. It tells Devi that it&#x27;s psychic and will attempt to help her. It shows her a scene from her childhood when a boy by the name of Spidgey Simons gives her a Valentine&#x27;s Day card. Devi coughs chalk into his face and crumples up the card. The fat says Spidgey later died of a chalk-induced asthma attack, and he was the only boy that could ever understand her. 

Devi escapes and makes it to her room, finding Sickness now in the form of a doll. Sickness reveals it is using Devi&#x27;s mind to grow a real body, and if Devi tries to resist again, it will kill her. After Devi quit her job, Sickness had to accelerate its plans. It offers her powers similar to Johnny&#x27;s, and Devi appears to accept them. When Sickness lets down its guard, Devi pins it to a canvas with a paintbrush and removes its eyeballs. Devi says she has won and has complete control over her mind again. Now that she has Sickness&#x27;s eyes, it will become a tortured audience to her life. The series ends with Devi and Tenna overlooking the town, watching a plane crash into their apartment building.

==Characters==
===Devi D.===
The protagonist, Devi, is an introvert attacked by the same forces attacking Johnny, the protagonist of &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;. He was her love interest until he tried to kill her to &quot;immortalize the moment&quot;. Their date left Johnny with severe head trauma and made Devi into a recluse. Since then, Devi&#x27;s love life has consisted of a string of disastrous dates.

Since her appearance in &quot;JtHM&quot; issue 7, she has quit her job at the local bookstore to become a graphic designer and cover artist for Nerve Publishing.

===Tenna===
Tenna is Devi&#x27;s friend and neighbor who owns a squeaky toy named Spooky whom she talks to constantly. She believes Devi&#x27;s problems stem from her lack of social contact. She first appears in the fourth issue of &quot;JtHM&quot;, then called Tonja. A doll version of Spooky appears in Layla Miller&#x27;s room during the Marvel Comics &quot;House of M&quot; event.

===Psychic Fat Lady===
An obese woman with psychic fat who shares her visions that Devi will die in a plane crash. She lives downstairs from Devi and hasn&#x27;t left her apartment for at least a decade.

===Eddie===
One of Devi&#x27;s dates, who gets in a car accident with her, trapping the two inside the vehicle.

===Eric===
A teenager obsessed with vampires. He first appeared in a &quot;Meanwhile&quot; section in &quot;JTHM&quot; and also briefly in &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, in another form.
===Mr. Nevers===
Devi&#x27;s boss in the Graphic Arts department of Nerve Publishing. He received a lobotomy to remove the creative centers of his brain.

===Spidgey Simons===
According to the psychic fat, the only boy who would ever truly understand Devi and her last chance at true love. She rejected his Valentine&#x27;s Day card in first grade and coughed chalk into his face. He later died of a chalk-induced asthma attack.

===Johnny C.===

The main character from &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;, Johnny C. makes a cameo appearance. In a flashback, Devi remembers what led to their disastrous date in issue #2 of &quot;JtHM&quot; and realizes Johnny had the same sickness she has.

<doc id="487943" wikidata="Q124953110" url="?curid=487943" title="Inverted sugar syrup">
<text>Inverted sugar syrup is a syrup mixture of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose, made by splitting disaccharide sucrose. This mixture&#x27;s optical rotation is opposite to that of the original sugar, which is why it is called an &quot;invert&quot; sugar. Splitting is completed through hydrolytic saccharification.

It is 1.3x sweeter than table sugar, and foods that contain invert sugar retain moisture better and crystallize less easily than those that use table sugar instead. Bakers, who call it invert syrup, may use it more than other sweeteners.

Other names include invert sugar, simple syrup, sugar syrup, sugar water, bar syrup, and sucrose inversion.

==Production==

===Additives===
Commercially prepared enzyme-catalyzed solutions are inverted at . The optimum pH for inversion is 5.0. Invertase is added at a rate of about 0.15% of the syrup&#x27;s weight, and inversion time will be about 8 hours. When completed the syrup temperature is raised to inactivate the invertase, but the syrup is concentrated in a vacuum evaporator to preserve color.

Though inverted sugar syrup can be made by heating table sugar in water alone, the reaction can be sped up by adding lemon juice, cream of tartar, or other catalysts, often without changing the flavor noticeably. Common sugar can be inverted quickly by mixing sugar and citric acid or cream of tartar at a ratio of about 1000:1 by weight and adding water. If lemon juice, which is about five percent citric acid by weight, is used instead then the ratio becomes 50:1. Such a mixture, heated to and added to another food, prevents crystallization without tasting sour.

Commercially prepared hydrochloric-acid catalyzed solutions may be inverted at the relatively low temperature of . The optimum pH for acid-catalyzed inversion is 2.15. As the inversion temperature is increased, the inversion time decreases. They are then given a pH neutralization when the desired level of inversion is reached.

In confectionery and candy making, cream of tartar is commonly used as the acidulant, with typical amounts in the range of 0.15–0.25% of the sugar&#x27;s weight. The use of cream of tartar imparts a honey-like flavor to the syrup. After the inversion is completed, it may be neutralized with baking soda using a weight of 45% of the cream of tartar&#x27;s weight.

===For fermentation===
All constituent sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) support fermentation, so invert sugar solutions of any composition can be fermented.

Syrup is used to feed microbiological life, which requires oxygen found in the water. For example, kombucha is produced by fermenting inverted sugar syrup with tea using a &quot;symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast&quot; (SCOBY), and yeast in winemaking is used for ethanol fermentation. Cold water can hold more dissolved oxygen than warm water, but granulated sugar does not dissolve easily in cold water.

Water in a container with wide bottom surface area allows for faster dissolving of the sucrose, which only has to be mixed a few times periodically to form a homogeneous solution. Also, a mixer or blender may be used to rotate the sugar, in turns, if necessary.

==In other foods and products==
*Honey which is mostly a mixture of glucose and fructose, being similar to invert syrup therefore, can remain a liquid for longer periods of time.
*Jam contains invert sugar formed by the heating process and the acid content of the fruit. This sugar preserves the jam for long periods of time.
*Golden syrup is a syrup of about 55% invert syrup and 45% table sugar (sucrose).
*Fondant filling for chocolates is unique in that the conversion enzyme is added, but not activated by acidification (microenvironment pH adjustment) or cofactor addition depending on the enzymes, before the filling is enrobed with chocolate. The very viscous (and thus formable) filling then becomes less viscous with time, giving the creamy consistency desired. This results from the sub-optimal enzymes conditions purposely created by withholding activation factors, which allows only a fraction of the enzymes to be active, or allows all enzymes to proceed at only a fraction of the biological rate [biologically, it&#x27;s realistically a combination of both: a reduced number of functional enzymes, with the ones that do function having reduced catalytic kinetics/rates].
*Cadbury Creme Eggs are filled with inverted sugar syrup produced by processing fondant with invertase.
*Sour Patch Kids also contain inverted sugar to add sweet flavor.

===Sweetened beverages===
Inverted sugar syrup is the basis in sweetened beverages.

* Sweet reserve is a wine term referring to a portion of selected unfermented grape must, free of microorganisms, to be added to wine as a sweetening component. When wine ferments, glucose is fermented at a faster rate than fructose. Thus, arresting fermentation after a significant portion of the sugars have fermented results in a wine where the residual sugar consists mainly of fructose, while the use of sweet reserve will result in a wine where the sweetness comes from a mixture of glucose and fructose. 
* Alcoholic beverage manufacturers often add invert sugar in the production of drinks like gin, beer and sparkling wines for flavoring. Candi sugar, similar to invert sugar, is used in the brewing of Belgian-style beers to boost alcohol content without drastically increasing the body of the beer; it is frequently found in the styles of beer known as dubbel and tripel.

==Chemistry==

Table sugar (sucrose) is converted to invert sugar by hydrolysis. Heating a mixture or solution of table sugar and water breaks the chemical bond that links together the two simple-sugar components.

The balanced chemical equation for the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose is:

:C12H22O11 (sucrose) + H2O (water) → C6H12O6 (glucose) + C6H12O6 (fructose)

=== Optical rotation ===
Once a sucrose solution has had some of its sucrose turned into glucose and fructose the solution is no longer said to be pure. The gradual decrease in purity of a sucrose solution as it is hydrolyzed affects a chemical property of the solution called optical rotation that can be used to figure out how much of the sucrose has been hydrolyzed and therefore whether the solution has been inverted or not.

==== Definition and measurement ====
Plane polarized light can be shone through a sucrose solution as it is heated up for hydrolysis. Such light has an &#x27;angle&#x27; that can be measured using a tool called a polarimeter. When such light is shone through a solution of pure sucrose it comes out the other side with a different angle than when it entered, which is proportional to both the concentration of the sugar and the length of the path of light through the solution; its angle is therefore said to be &#x27;rotated&#x27; and how many degrees the angle has changed (the degree of its rotation or its &#x27;optical rotation&#x27;) is given a letter name, formula_1 (alpha). When the rotation between the angle the light has when it enters and when it exits is in the clockwise direction, the light is said to be &#x27;rotated right&#x27; and formula_1 is given to have a &quot;positive&quot; angle such as 64°. When the rotation between the angle the light has when it enters and when it exits is in the counterclockwise direction, the light is said to be &#x27;rotated left&#x27; and formula_1 is given a &quot;negative&quot; angle such as −39°.

==== Definition of the inversion point ====
When plane polarized light enters and exits a solution of &quot;pure&quot; sucrose its angle is rotated 66.5° (clockwise or to the right). As the sucrose is heated up and hydrolyzed the amount of glucose and fructose in the mixture increases and the optical rotation decreases. After formula_1 passes zero and becomes a negative optical rotation, meaning that the rotation between the angle the light has when it enters and when it exits is in the counter clockwise direction, it is said that the optical rotation has &#x27;inverted&#x27; its direction. This leads to the definition of an &#x27;inversion point&#x27; as the per cent amount sucrose that has to be hydrolyzed before formula_1 equals zero. Any solution which has passed the inversion point (and therefore has a negative value of formula_1) is said to be &#x27;inverted&#x27;.

==== Chirality and specific rotation ====
As the shapes of the molecules (&#x27;chemical structures&#x27;) of sucrose, glucose, and fructose are all asymmetrical the three sugars come in several different forms, called stereoisomers. The existence of these forms is what gives rise to these chemicals&#x27; optical properties. When plane polarized light passes through a pure solution of one of these &quot;forms&quot; of one of the sugars it is thought to hit and &#x27;glance off&#x27; certain asymmetrical chemical bonds within the molecule of that form of that sugar. Because those particular bonds (which in cyclic sugars like sucrose, glucose, and fructose include an anomeric bond) are different in each form of the sugar, each form rotates the light to a different degree.

When any one form of a sugar is purified and put in water, it rapidly takes other forms of the same sugar. This means that a solution of a pure sugar normally has all of its stereoisomers present in the solution in different amounts which usually do not change much. This has an &#x27;averaging&#x27; effect on all of the optical rotation angles (formula_1 values) of the different forms of the sugar and leads to the pure sugar solution having its own &#x27;total&#x27; optical rotation, which is called its &#x27;specific rotation&#x27; or &#x27;observed specific rotation&#x27; and which is written as formula_8.

In the circumstance of 20 °C, the specific optical rotation of sucrose is known to be 66.6°, glucose is 52.2°, and fructose is −92.4°.

==== Effects of water ====
Water molecules do not have chirality, therefore they do not have any effect on the measurement of optical rotation. When plane polarized light enters a body of pure water its angle is no different from when it exits. Thus, for water, formula_8 = 0°. Chemicals that, like water, have specific rotations that equal zero degrees are called &#x27;optically inactive&#x27; chemicals and like water, they do not need to be considered when calculating optical rotation, outside of the concentration and path length.

==== Mixtures in general ====
The overall optical rotation of a mixture of chemicals can be calculated if the proportion of the amount of each chemical in the solution is known. If there are formula_10-many optically active different chemicals (&#x27;chemical species&#x27;) in a solution and the molar concentration (the number of moles of each chemical per liter of liquid solution) of each chemical in the solution is known and written as formula_11 (where formula_12 is a number used to identify the chemical species); and if each species has a specific rotation (the optical rotation of that chemical were it made as a pure solution) written as formula_13, then the mixture has the overall optical rotationformula_14Where formula_15 is the mole fraction of the formula_16 species.

==== Fully hydrolyzed sucrose ====
Assuming no extra chemical products are formed by accident (that is, there are no side reactions) a completely hydrolyzed sucrose solution no longer has any sucrose and is a half-and-half mixture of glucose and fructose. This solution has the optical rotation
formula_17

==== Partly hydrolyzed sucrose ====
If a sucrose solution has been partly hydrolyzed, then it contains sucrose, glucose and fructose and its optical rotation angle depends on the relative amounts of each for the solution;formula_18Where formula_19, formula_20, and formula_21 stand for sucrose, glucose, and fructose.

The particular values of formula_22 do not need to be known to make use of this equation as the inversion point (per cent amount of sucrose that must be hydrolyzed before the solution is inverted) can be calculated from the specific rotation angles of the pure sugars. The reaction stoichiometry (the fact that hydrolyzing one sucrose molecule makes one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule) shows that when a solution begins with formula_23 moles of sucrose and no glucose nor fructose and formula_24 moles of sucrose are then hydrolyzed the resulting solution has formula_25 moles of sucrose, formula_24 moles of glucose and formula_24 moles of fructose. The total number of moles of sugars in the solution is therefore formula_28and the reaction progress (per cent completion of the hydrolysis reaction) equals formula_29. It can be shown that the solution&#x27;s optical rotation angle is a function of (explicitly depends on) this per cent reaction progress. When the quantity formula_30 is written as formula_31 and the reaction is formula_32 done, the optical rotation angle is
formula_33

By definition, formula_1 equals zero degrees at the &#x27;inversion point&#x27;; to find the inversion point, therefore, alpha is set equal to zero and the equation is manipulated to find formula_31. This givesformula_36Thus it is found that a sucrose solution is inverted once at least formula_37 of the sucrose has been hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose.

==== Monitoring reaction progress ====
Holding a sucrose solution at temperatures of hydrolyzes no more than about 85% of its sucrose. Finding formula_1 when r = 0.85 shows that the optical rotation of the solution after hydrolysis is done is −12.7° this reaction is said to invert the sugar because its final optical rotation is less than zero. A polarimeter can be used to figure out when the inversion is done by detecting whether the optical rotation of the solution at an earlier time in its hydrolysis reaction equals −12.7°.

<text>Robert Fletcher Nixon (born July 17, 1928) is a retired Canadian politician in the province of Ontario, Canada. The son of former Premier of Ontario Harry Nixon, he was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in a 1962 by-election following his father&#x27;s death. The younger Nixon was elected leader of the Ontario Liberal Party in 1967 and led them through three provincial elections, the first two where the Liberals retained their standing as the second-largest party and official opposition in the legislature.

Nixon resigned as party leader in 1976 and was succeeded by Stuart Smith after a leadership convention. Nixon remained a prominent member of the Liberal caucus after standing down from the party leadership, including two stints as interim opposition leader, and served as Provincial Treasurer and Deputy Premier in the government of David Peterson from 1985 to 1990.

==Background==

Nixon is the son of former Premier Harry Nixon and father of former federal MP Jane Stewart. When his father, who had been a member of the legislature since the 1919 provincial election, died on October 22, 1961, Nixon was chosen to run under the Liberal banner as his replacement. On January 18, 1962, he was elected as the member for the rural, southwestern Ontario riding of Brant. At this time, Ontario was dominated by the Progressive Conservative Party, then led by John Robarts. The PC party had won 71 of 98 seats in the previous general election and had governed the province since 1943. Nixon was re-elected in the 1963 provincial election.

==Leadership==
The Liberal Party had chosen Andy Thompson as its leader in September 1964, with the expectation that he would lead the party in the next provincial election. However, Thompson suffered a physical breakdown in late 1966 as a result of his involvement in an automobile accident in which two elderly women were seriously injured and withdrew from the position on the advice of his doctors. Nixon was chosen as the party&#x27;s interim leader on November 16, 1966, and soon declared his candidacy to become the party&#x27;s full-time leader. When no other candidates came forward, Nixon was acclaimed as party leader and Leader of the Opposition on January 7, 1967.

Nixon led the Liberal Party into the 1967 provincial election, held in October of that year. His campaign attempted to draw attention to water pollution and the high cost of housing in the province, though his efforts on the latter front were undercut by the federal Liberal government&#x27;s decision to increase interest payments on the National Housing Act in mid-campaign. Nixon increased the party&#x27;s caucus in the Legislative Assembly from 23 to 28 seats (the total number of MPPs was increased from 108 to 117 in this election, and that the third-place New Democratic Party increased its representation from seven MPPs to twenty).

===1970s===
John Robarts stepped down as Tory leader and Premier in 1971 and was replaced by William Davis. Davis led the Tories to an increased majority in the 1971 provincial election. Nixon&#x27;s Liberals were reduced to 20 seats, only one more than the NDP, and the party&#x27;s share of the popular vote sank to its lowest level in nearly fifty years. Nixon had previously predicted 40 seats for his party, and decided to step down as leader after the election&#x27;. He formally resigned in 1972, remaining as interim leader until a permanent successor could be chosen. The convention was scheduled for October 1973. The Davis government was weakened by a series of corruption scandals. Nixon changed his mind about retirement and entered the leadership contest to succeed himself. He defeated Norman Cafik on the third ballot, and resumed his official duties as party leader and leader of the opposition.

===1975 election===
By the 1975 election, the Tories had been in power for thirty-two years. Nixon and the Liberals, along with Stephen Lewis and the Ontario New Democratic Party, led aggressive campaigns against Davis, with Nixon and Davis personally trading barbs. Polls taken shortly before the election showed the Liberals with a provincial lead. The Tories were reduced to a minority government for the first time since 1945. While the Liberals increased their caucus from 20 to 35 seats, however, the NDP caucus increased from 19 to 38 seats and became the Official Opposition for the first time since 1951. Due to the almost even split between opposition parties and the fact that both the Liberals and the NDP hoped to win the next election, the two opposition parties were unable and unwilling to form a coalition to replace the Conservatives, and the Davis government was able to survive. For the next two years, the NDP offered unofficial support to the Davis government on several issues. Nixon resigned as leader for a second time and was replaced by Stuart Smith in 1976.

==Remaining in politics==
Nixon remained in the legislature, however, although he did not have any official parliamentary duties from 1976 to 1982. When Smith resigned as leader following a poor performance in the 1981 provincial election, Nixon briefly returned as interim leader of the opposition from January 25 to February 21, 1982, when David Peterson was chosen as Smith&#x27;s replacement.

There are reports that Nixon wanted to resign from provincial politics in 1984 and that he was actively seeking an appointment to the Canadian Senate. He was eventually talked out of this by Liberal organizer Keith Davey, who emphasized that Peterson needed his experience and argued that the Liberals could win the next provincial election. Nixon remained, and surprised some reporters prior to the 1985 provincial election by openly speculating about a future Liberal-NDP coalition.

==Provincial Treasurer==
The election itself produced no clear winner. The Progressive Conservatives, now under Frank Miller, were again reduced to a minority government, winning 52 seats out of 125. Unlike the situation in 1975, however, the Liberals clearly emerged as the dominant opposition party with 48 seats and a narrow victory over the Tories in the popular vote. Nixon took part in post-election negotiations with the third-place NDP, and helped bring about a two-year accord between the two parties, in which the NDP gave support to the Liberals in return for progressive legislation in certain fields.

The Progressive Conservative government was defeated in the house on June 26, 1985, and Nixon was sworn in as Peterson&#x27;s Treasurer, Minister of Economics, Minister of Revenue and Government House Leader in the first Ontario Liberal administration in forty-two years. From June 17, 1986, until the 1987 provincial election, he also served as interim Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet.

The Liberals won a majority in the 1987 election, and Nixon was appointed as Deputy Premier on September 29 of that year, also retaining the positions of Treasurer, Minister of Economics and Minister of Financial Institutions. He remained in these positions for the remainder of Peterson&#x27;s time in government. His government produced balanced budgets in 1989 and 1990, although some opposition members later criticized the methodology used to calculate revenues and expenditures in this period. In 1989, Nixon eliminated individual Ontario Health Insurance Plan premium charges.

==Back to Opposition==
Nixon&#x27;s tenure as Treasurer ended with the provincial election of 1990, as Peterson&#x27;s Liberals were upset by the NDP under Bob Rae. Peterson lost his seat, and Nixon fell below 50% support in his own riding for the only time in his career as he defeated an NDP challenger by about 1,500 votes. Peterson resigned as Liberal leader immediately after the election, and Nixon once again became his party&#x27;s interim leader on September 13, 1990, as well as leader of the opposition when the legislature returned to sit in November 1990.

==Retirement==
Nixon resigned from the legislature on July 31, 1991, accepting a federal appointment from the Mulroney government to conduct a review of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (Nixon later served as chair of this crown corporation from 1994 to 2001). He and his father had represented the riding of Brant continuously from 1919 until 1991. In the 1993 federal election, the riding elected Nixon&#x27;s daughter, Jane Stewart to the House of Commons of Canada, where she served in the Cabinet of Jean Chrétien.

In 1992 Nixon was appointed Agent-General of Ontario to the United Kingdom. He held this position until the London office, and 18 other offices throughout the world, was closed by Bob Rae&#x27;s NDP government as an economic measure in the mid-90s. Nixon supported Gerard Kennedy for the leadership of the provincial Liberal Party in 1996 and former Ontario New Democratic Party leader and Premier Bob Rae for the federal Liberal leadership in the 2006 leadership race.

In the 2013 Ontario Liberal Party leadership election Nixon endorsed Sandra Pupatello. In 2015, he was made a member of the Order of Ontario.

<doc id="487945" wikidata="Q5422751" url="?curid=487945" title="Eyeblink conditioning">
<text>Eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is a form of classical conditioning that has been used extensively to study neural structures and mechanisms that underlie learning and memory. The procedure is relatively simple and usually consists of pairing an auditory or visual stimulus (the conditioned stimulus (CS)) with an eyeblink-eliciting unconditioned stimulus (US) (e.g. a mild puff of air to the cornea or a mild shock). Naïve organisms initially produce a reflexive, unconditioned response (UR) (e.g. blink or extension of nictitating membrane) that follows US onset. After many CS-US pairings, an association is formed such that a learned blink, or conditioned response (CR), occurs and precedes US onset. The magnitude of learning is generally gauged by the percentage of all paired CS-US trials that result in a CR. Under optimal conditions, well-trained animals produce a high percentage of CRs (&gt; 90%). The conditions necessary for, and the physiological mechanisms that govern, eyeblink CR learning have been studied across many mammalian species, including mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, ferrets, cats, and humans. Historically, rabbits have been the most popular research subjects.

==CS-US contingency==

The order in which stimuli are presented is an important factor in all forms of classical conditioning. Forward conditioning describes a presentation format in which the CS precedes the US in time. That is, from the perspective of the research subject, experiencing the US is &quot;contingent&quot; upon having just experienced the CS. EBC is usually, but not always, conducted in this manner. Other stimulus contingencies include backward conditioning, in which US comes before CS, and simultaneous conditioning, in which CS and US are presented at the same time. In any case, the time between CS onset and US onset is the interstimulus interval (ISI). Animals are usually trained with a shorter ISI than humans, which can make interspecies comparisons difficult. 

===The delay and trace procedures===

In delay EBC, the CS onset precedes the US onset and the two stimuli overlap and coterminate, with the stimuli converging in the cerebellar cortex and interpositus nucleus. In the trace EBC, the CS precedes the US and there is a stimulus free period (trace interval) between CS offset and US onset. While both of these procedures require the cerebellum, the trace procedure also requires the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex.

==Neural circuitry==
===The blink reflex===
When a US is delivered to the cornea of the eye, sensory information is carried to the trigeminal nucleus and relayed both directly and indirectly (via reticular formation) to the accessory abducens and abducens motor nuclei (see Cranial nerve nucleus). Output from these nuclei control various eye muscles that work synergistically to produce an unconditioned blink response to corneal stimulation (reviewed, Christian &amp; Thompson, 2003). Electromyogram (EMG) activity of the orbicularis oculi muscle, which controls eyelid closure, is considered to be the most prominent and sensitive component of blinking (Lavond et al., 1990) and is, thus, the most common behaviorally-derived dependent variable in studies of EBC.

===US pathway===

The trigeminal nucleus also sends efferent projections to the inferior olive (IO), and this represents the US pathway for EBC. The critical region of the IO for eyeblink conditioning is the dorsal accessory olive (Brodal, 1981), and climbing fibers (CF) from this region send information about the US to the cerebellum (Brodal, Walberg &amp; Hoddevik, 1975; Thompson, 1989). Climbing fibers ultimately project to both the deep cerebellar nuclei and Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellar cortex.

===The CS pathway===

The pontine nuclei (PN) can support different CS modalities (auditory tone, light, etc.) for EBC as they receive projections from auditory, visual, somatosensory, and association systems (Glickstein et al., 1980; Brodal, 1981; Schmahmann &amp; Pandya, 1989; 1991; 1993). When the CS is a tone, auditory information is received via the cochlear nuclei (Steinmetz &amp; Sengelaub, 1992). The PN give rise to mossy fiber (MF) axons that carry CS-related information (Steinmetz et al., 1987; Lewis et al., 1987; Thompson et al., 1997) to the cerebellum via the middle cerebellar peduncle, and terminate in both the cerebellar nuclei, and at granule cells (GR) of the cerebellar cortex (Steinmetz &amp; Sengelaub, 1992). Granule cells give rise to parallel fiber (PF) axons which synapse onto PCs.

===CS-US convergence in the cerebellum===

Two cerebellar sites of CS-US convergence are 1) cells of the deep nuclear region in the cerebellum, and 2) PCs of the cortex. In addition to receiving converging CS and US input via the PN and IO, respectively, cells of the cerebellar nuclei receive GABA-ergic inhibitory input from PCs of the cerebellar cortex. Output from the interpositus nucleus includes projections to the red nucleus, and the red nucleus sends projections to the facial and abducens nuclei. These nuclei supply the motor output component of the reflexive eyeblink. Therefore, in addition to being a site of stimulus convergence, the deep nuclei are also the cerebellum&#x27;s output structure.

==Critical role of the interposed nucleus==

David A. McCormick, as a graduate student with Professor Richard F. Thompson, initially identified the cerebellum as the essential structure for learning and executing eyeblink CRs. Some scientists think that the interposed nucleus is the site critical to learning, retaining, and executing the conditioning blink response.

===Lesion studies===

The first evidence for the role of the cerebellum in EBC came from McCormick et al. (1981). They found that a unilateral cerebellar lesion which included both cortex and deep nuclei permanently abolished CRs. In subsequent studies, it was determined that lesions of the lateral interpositus and medial dentate nuclei were sufficient to prevent acquisition of CRs in naïve animals (Lincoln et al., 1982) and abolished CRs in well-trained animals (McCormick &amp; Thompson, 1984). Finally, the use of Kainic acid lesions, which destroy neuronal cell bodies and spare passing fibers, provided evidence for a highly localized region of cerebellar nuclear cells that are essential for learning and performing CRs (Lavond et al., 1985). The population of cells critical for EBC appears to be restricted to a ~ 1 mm3 area of dorsolateral anterior INP ipsilateral to the conditioned eye. Lesions to this area of INP result in an inability to acquire eyeblink CRs in naïve animals. Additionally, the permanence of the localized lesion effect is remarkable. In well-trained animals, CRs abolished as a result of lesion are not reacquired, even after extensive training that spans over 8 months (Steinmetz et al., 1992). These results demonstrate that a highly localized region of cerebellum must be intact for CR learning to occur in EBC.

===Reversible inactivation studies===

Reversible inactivation of the INP has provided further evidence for its role in EC. Methods used to temporarily inactivate nervous tissue include use of a cooling probe (&lt; 10 °C), and locally infusing Muscimol or Lidocaine. These methods are advantageous primarily because the experimenter can essentially turn neutral tissue on and off, &quot;per se&quot;. The effect of each of these inactivation protocols on CR learning and execution has been tested throughout the cerebellum and associated brainstem structures. When applied to the INP, temporary inactivation completely prevents learning of CRs in naïve animals, and learning occurs normally during post-inactivation training (Clark et al., 1992; Krupa et al., 1993; Nordholm et al., 1993; Krupa &amp; Thompson, 1997). Additionally, INP inactivation in well-trained animals results in a complete depression of conditioned responding, which returns to plateau levels when the INP comes back online (Clark et al., 1992).

===Neural recording studies===

Recordings of multiple-unit neuronal activity from rabbit INP during eyeblink conditioning have been possible with chronic electrode implants, and have revealed a population of cells that discharge prior to the initiation of the learned eyeblink CR and fire in a pattern of increased response frequency that predicted and modeled the temporal form of the behavioral CR (McCormick et al., 1981; 1982; 1983; Thompson, 1983; 1986; Foy et al., 1984; McCormick &amp; Thompson, 1984a; b; Berthier &amp; Moore, 1990; Gould &amp; Steinmetz, 1996). Similar results were found in the rat INP (Freeman &amp; Nicholson, 2000; Stanton &amp; Freemen, 2000; Rogers et al., 2001), thus demonstrating that underlying circuitry for this form of learning may be conserved across species. Although samples of single-unit activity from the INP and surrounding nuclei have revealed a multitude of response patterns during EBC (Tracy, 1995), many of the cells in the anterior dorsolateral INP significantly increase their firing rate in a precise temporal pattern that is delayed from CS onset and precedes CR onset (Foy et al., 1984; Berthier &amp; Moore, 1990). This pattern of responding is indicative of a structure that is capable of encoding learning and/or executing learned behavioral responses.

===Critical sites for learning downstream===
Alternative sites of synaptic plasticity critical to EBC have been posited to exist downstream from the cerebellum. Some proposed loci include the red nucleus (Tsukahara, Oda, and Notsu, 1981), the trigeminal nucleus and associated structures (Desmond &amp; Moore, 1983), or the facial motor nucleus (Woody et al., 1974). All of these structures have been ruled out as potential sites of plasticity critical to learning the eyeblink CR (Krupa, Thompson, and Thompson, 1993; Clark and Lavond, 1996; Krupa, Weng, and Thompson, 1996).

===Summary===

Taken together, results from lesion, inactivation, and neural recording studies seem to demonstrate that the dorsolateral portion of the anterior interpositus nucleus (INP) of the cerebellum, ipsilateral to the trained eye, is an essential site for CR acquisition and expression in EBC (Lincoln et al., 1982; Lavond et al., 1984a,b).
However recent studies (Nilaweera et al., 2006) found that temporary block of cerebellar output prevented normal acquisition of conditioned responses. The authors concluded that this form of associative learning in the rabbit eyeblink system requires extra-cerebellar learning and/or cerebellar learning that depends on the operation of cerebellar feedback loops.

==Role of the cerebellar cortex==

Two areas of cortex that are known to be involved in eyeblink conditioning are lobule HVI (Lavond et al., 1987; Lavond and Steinmetz, 1989; Yeo and Hardiman, 1992) and the anterior lobe ((ANT) Garcia, Steele, and Mauk, 1999). The importance of cerebellar cortex in EBC, relative to INP, is a matter of debate in the scientific community.

===Lesion studies===

Several studies have attempted to assess the role of the cerebellar cortex in eyeblink CR learning, and early studies focused on large aspiration lesions of cerebellar cortex. Lavond and Steinmetz (1989) completely removed lobules HVI/HVIIa and significant portions of ANT, sparing INP, and found significant acquisition deficits. Compared to controls, lesioned animals took seven times longer to reach learning criterion. Significant percentages of CRs were eventually reached by the cortically-lesioned animals, but the CRs were low in amplitude and poorly timed. Finally, large lesions of cerebellar cortex after learning do not abolish learned CRs (Lavond et al., 1987). One common factor in all of these cortical ablation studies was that portions of cortex were spared; making it possible to assume that other areas of cortex were compensating for the loss of tissue.

===The &quot;pcd&quot; mouse===

Classical conditioning of a Purkinje cell deficient mutant mouse strain helped to determine the extent to which spared regions in cerebellar cortex were compensating for lesioned regions in the studies mentioned above. These mice are born with PCs that die after about 3 weeks of life. Because PCs are the sole output neuron of the cortex, this model effectively lesions all of cerebellar cortex. Results of conditioning were similar to the cortical aspiration mice. Mice took significantly longer to produce CRs, and the timing and gain of the response were distorted (Chen et al., 1996). Therefore, although eyeblink CR learning deficits are associated with cerebellar cortex lesions, the structure does not appear, ultimately, to be essential for CR learning or retention.

===Reversible inactivation studies===

Results from cerebellar cortical inactivation studies are similar to those reported for lesion studies. For example, Krupa (1993) inactivated lobule HVI with the GABAA receptor agonist Muscimol and found significant acquisition deficits, but animals eventually learned. Clark et al. (1997) replicated these results with a cooling probe in HVI. Attwell, Rahman, and Yeo (2001) discovered similar disruption of with HVI inactivation. They infused the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX into HVI during acquisition training and found that CNQX-infused rabbits did not learn the eyeblink CR. However, post-acquisition CNQX infusions did not affect retention. These results are perplexing, given that animals ultimately learned the eyeblink CR in all other cerebellar cortical lesion and inactivation studies. One reason why this effect is so strong may be that Attwell et al., (2001) trained animals for only 4 days at an ISI that is outside of a range known to be optimal for learning [150–300 ms is an optimal CS-US interval and the magnitude of learning decreases as the ISI is increased (Schneiderman and Gormezano, 1964; Smith, Coleman, and Gormezano, 1969)].

===Neural recording studies===

Electrophysiological recording studies of cerebellar cortex have helped to better understand the role that PCs play in the eyeblink CR learning process. McCormick and Thompson (1984b) recorded PC activity during eyeblink training and found cell populations that discharged in a pattern apparently related the behavioral CR, while other PC populations discharged in patterns that coincided with either presentation of the CS or US. Similar results were found by Berthier and Moore (1986) with single unit recording of PCs in lobule HVI. They found that populations of neurons fire in relation to various aspects of eyeblink training, including CS and US presentation and CR execution. (Berthier and Moore, 1986; Gould and Steinmetz, 1996). Recently, similar stimulus- and response-related PC activity has been found in ANT (Green and Steinmetz, 2005). Finally, electrophysiological recordings of PCs in HVI and ANT have revealed a difference in the overall population responses of PCs. The majority of PCs show excitatory patterns of activity during eyeblink conditioning in HVI (Berthier and Moore, 1986; Gould and Steinmetz, 1996; Katz and Steinmetz, 1997), and inhibitory patterns of activity in ANT (Green and Steinmetz, 2005). In a single unit recording study where the individual Purkinje cells were shown to be located in the area controlling blinks and to receive climbing fibre input on US presentations, only inhibitory responses were found. In a recent study of similarly characterized Purkinje cells which were followed for up to more than fifteen hours, it was found that repeated presentations of the CS and US caused the gradual development of a pause in Purkinje cell firing. This pause response, called a Purkinje cell CR, was also obtained when direct mossy fibre stimulation was used as the CS and direct climbing fibre stimulation as the US. Unpaired presentations of the CS and US caused extinction of the Purkinje cell CR. When paired presentations were reintroduced after extinction, Purkinje cell CRs reappeared rapidly, mirroring the &quot;savings&quot; phenomenon demonstrated at the behavioral level. Purkinje cell CRs were also adaptively timed.

=== Feedback control of learning ===
The deep cerebellar nuclei have been shown to inhibit the inferior olive and this inhibition probably serves a negative feedback control function. As learning proceeds, the olive becomes inhibited and it has been shown that this inhibition has temporal properties that makes ideally suited to serve as a feedback signal for controlling learning. Stimulating this pathway during paired CS - US presentations causes extinction. Recordings from Purkinje cells show that the olive is depressed during the Purkinje cell CR.

===Summary===

Taken together, results from lesion, inactivation, and neural recording studies seem to demonstrate that the cerebellar cortex is not essential for basic eyeblink CR learning or retention, but that significant contributions from cortex underlie normal learning.

==Synaptic mechanisms underlying EBC==
===Parallel fiber – Purkinje cell synapse===

Long term depression (LTD) at the PF-PC synapse is hypothesized to have significant functional consequences for learning the behavioral CR in EBC (Ito, 1984). For example, as a result of training, INP cells discharge prior to CR execution and fire in a pattern of increased frequency of response that predicts the temporal form of the behavioral CR (McCormick &amp; Thompson, 1984). This pattern of activity clearly indicates that the INP is capable a generating a conditioned response. Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex tonically inhibit deep nuclear cells. Therefore, an LTD-mediated decrease in PC activity at the appropriate time during a CS-US interval could release the INP from tonic inhibition and allow for execution of a CR. An increase in PC activity could have the opposite effect, prohibiting or limiting CR execution. It has been hypothesized that CRs are generated by the INP as a result of release from PC inhibition (i.e. Perrett et al., 1993).

<text>Axiom is a free, general-purpose computer algebra system. It consists of an interpreter environment, a compiler and a library, which defines a strongly typed hierarchy.

== History ==
Two computer algebra systems named Scratchpad were developed by IBM. The first one was started in 1965 by James Griesmer at the request of Ralph Gomory, and written in Fortran. The development of this software was stopped before any public release. The second Scratchpad, originally named Scratchpad II, was developed from 1977 on, at Thomas J. Watson Research Center, under the direction of Richard Dimick Jenks.

The design is principally due to Richard D. Jenks (IBM Research), James H. Davenport (University of Bath), Barry M. Trager (IBM Research), David Y.Y. Yun (Southern Methodist University) and Victor S. Miller (IBM Research). Early consultants on the project were David Barton (University of California, Berkeley) and James W. Thatcher (IBM Research). Implementation included Robert Sutor (IBM Research), Scott C. Morrison (University of California, Berkeley), Christine J. Sundaresan (IBM Research), Timothy Daly (IBM Research), Patrizia Gianni (University of Pisa), Albrecht Fortenbacher (Universitaet Karlsruhe), Stephen M. Watt (IBM Research and University of Waterloo), Josh Cohen (Yale University), Michael Rothstein (Kent State University), Manuel Bronstein (IBM Research), Michael Monagan (Simon Fraser University), Jonathan Steinbach (IBM Research), William Burge (IBM Research), Jim Wen (IBM Research), William Sit (City College of New York), and Clifton Williamson (IBM Research)

Scratchpad II was renamed Axiom when IBM decided, circa 1990, to make it a commercial product. A few years later, it was sold to NAG. In 2001, it was withdrawn from the market and re-released under the Modified BSD License. Since then, the project&#x27;s lead developer has been Tim Daly.

In 2007, Axiom was forked twice, originating two different open-source projects: OpenAxiom and FriCAS, following &quot;serious disagreement about project goals&quot;. The Axiom project continued to be developed by Tim Daly.

The current research direction is &quot;Proving Axiom Sane&quot;, that is, logical, rational, judicious, and sound.

== Videos ==

The Axiom project has a major focus on providing documentation. Recently the project announced the first in a series of instructional videos, which are also available on the codice_1 website. The first video provides details on the Axiom information sources.

== Philosophy ==

The Axiom project focuses on the “30 Year Horizon”. The primary philosophy is that Axiom needs to develop several fundamental features in order to be useful to the next generation of computational mathematicians. Knuth&#x27;s literate programming technique is used throughout the source code. Axiom plans to use proof technology to prove the correctness of the algorithms (such as Coq and ACL2).

Axiom uses Docker Containers as part of a continuous release process. The latest image is available on any platform using docker and the commands:
docker pull daly/axiom

docker run -i -t daly/axiom axiom
== Design ==

In Axiom, each object has a type. Examples of types are mathematical structures (such as rings, fields, polynomials) as well as data structures from computer science (e.g., lists, trees, hash tables).

A function can take a type as argument, and its return value can also be a type. For example, codice_3 is a function, that takes an codice_4 as argument, and returns the field of fractions of its argument. As another example, the ring of formula_1 matrices with rational entries would be constructed as codice_5. Of course, when working in this domain, codice_6 is interpreted as the identity matrix and codice_7 would give the inverse of the matrix codice_8, if it exists.

Several operations can have the same name, and the types of both the arguments and the result are used to determine which operation is applied (cf. function overloading).

Axiom comes with an extension language called SPAD. All the mathematical knowledge of Axiom is written in this language. The interpreter accepts roughly the same language.

== Features ==

Within the interpreter environment, Axiom uses type inference and a heuristic algorithm to make explicit type annotations mostly unnecessary.

It features &#x27;HyperDoc&#x27;, an interactive browser-like help system, and can display two and three dimensional graphics, also providing interactive features like rotation and lighting. It also has a specialized interaction mode for Emacs, as well as a plugin for the TeXmacs editor.

Axiom has an implementation of the Risch algorithm for elementary integration, which was done by Manuel Bronstein and Barry Trager. While this implementation can find most elementary antiderivatives and whether they exist, it does have some non-implemented branches, and raises an error when such cases are encountered during integration.

<doc id="487949" wikidata="Q2079841" url="?curid=487949" title="Fear conditioning">
<text>Pavlovian fear conditioning is a behavioral paradigm in which organisms learn to predict aversive events. It is a form of learning in which an aversive stimulus (e.g. an electrical shock) is associated with a particular neutral context (e.g., a room) or neutral stimulus (e.g., a tone), resulting in the expression of fear responses to the originally neutral stimulus or context. This can be done by pairing the neutral stimulus with an aversive stimulus (e.g., an electric shock, loud noise, or unpleasant odor). Eventually, the neutral stimulus alone can elicit the state of fear. In the vocabulary of classical conditioning, the neutral stimulus or context is the &quot;conditional stimulus&quot; (CS), the aversive stimulus is the &quot;unconditional stimulus&quot; (US), and the fear is the &quot;conditional response&quot; (CR).

Fear conditioning has been studied in numerous species, from snails to humans. In humans, conditioned fear is often measured with verbal report and galvanic skin response. In other animals, conditioned fear is often measured with freezing (a period of watchful immobility) or fear potentiated startle (the augmentation of the startle reflex by a fearful stimulus). Changes in heart rate, breathing, and muscle responses via electromyography can also be used to measure conditioned fear. A number of theorists have argued that conditioned fear coincides substantially with the mechanisms, both functional and neural, of clinical anxiety disorders. Research into the acquisition, consolidation and extinction of conditioned fear promises to inform new drug based and psychotherapeutic treatments for an array of pathological conditions such as dissociation, phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Scientists have discovered that there is a set of brain connections that determine how fear memories are stored and recalled. While studying rats&#x27; ability to recall fear memories, researchers found a newly identified brain circuit is involved. Initially, the pre-limbic prefrontal cortex (PL) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) were identified in memory recall. A week later, the central amygdala (CeA) and the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) were identified in memory recall, which are responsible for maintaining fear memories. This study shows how there are shifting circuits between short term recall and long term recall of fear memories. There is no change in behavior or response, only change in where the memory was recalled from.

In addition to the amygdala, the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex are important in fear conditioning. Fear conditioning in the rat is stored at early times in the hippocampus, with alterations in hippocampal gene expression observed at 1 hour and 24 hours after the event. In the mouse, changed gene expression is also seen in the hippocampus at one hour and 24 hours after fear conditioning. These changes are transient in the hippocampal neurons, and almost none are present in the hippocampus after four weeks. By 4 weeks after the event, the memory of the fear conditioning event is more permanently stored in the anterior cingulate cortex.

== Neurobiology ==
===Neuronal gene expression===
As shown in the rodent brain, neuronal gene expression is dynamically changed in response to fear conditioning. In particular, the expressions of immediate early genes (IEGs) such as &quot;Egr1&quot;, &quot;c-Fos&quot;, and &quot;Arc&quot; are rapidly and selectively up-regulated in subsets of neurons in specific brain regions associated with learning and memory formation.

A review in 2022 describes multiple steps in up-regulating the IEGs in neurons in the hippocampus during fear conditioning. IEGs are similarly up-regulated in the amygdala during fear conditioning. The multiple steps in up-regulating IEGs include activation of transcription factors, formation of chromatin loops, interaction of enhancers with promoters in chromatin loops and topoisomerase II beta-initiated temporary DNA double-strand breaks.

At least two IEGs up-regulated by fear conditioning, &quot;Egr1&quot; and &quot;Dnmt3A2&quot; (shown to be an IEG by Oliveira et al.) affect DNA methylation, and thus expression, of many genes. Up-regulated EGR1 proteins associate with pre-existing nuclear TET1 proteins, and the EGR1 proteins bring TET1 proteins to hundreds of genes, allowing TET1 to initiate DNA demethylation of those genes. DNMT3A2 protein is a &quot;de novo&quot; DNA methyltransferase, adding methylation to cytosines in DNA. Expression of DNMT3A2 proteins in hippocampus neurons in culture preferentially targeted the addition of new methylation to more than 200 genes involved in synaptic plasticity. Expressions of IEGs are a source of the dynamic changes in subsequent neuronal gene expression in response to fear conditioning.

=== Amygdala ===
Fear conditioning is thought to depend upon an area of the brain called the amygdala. The amygdala is involved in acquisition, storage, and expression of conditioned fear memory. Lesion studies have revealed that lesions drilled into the amygdala before fear conditioning prevent the acquisition of the conditioned response of fear, and lesions drilled in the amygdala after conditioning cause conditioned responses to be forgotten. Electrophysiological recordings from the amygdala have demonstrated that cells in that region undergo long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity believed to underlie learning. Pharmacological studies, synaptic studies, and human studies also implicate the amygdala as chiefly responsible for fear learning and memory. Additionally, inhibition of neurons in the amygdala disrupts fear acquisition, while stimulation of those neurons can drive fear-related behaviors, such as freezing behavior in rodents. This indicates that proper function of the amygdala is both necessary for fear conditioning and sufficient to drive fear behaviors. The amygdala is not exclusively the fear center, but also an area for responding to various environmental stimuli. Several studies have shown that when faced with unpredictable neutral stimuli, amygdala activity increases. Therefore, even in situations of uncertainty and not necessarily fear, the amygdala plays a role in alerting other brain regions that encourage safety and survival responses.

In the mid-1950s Lawrence Weiskrantz demonstrated that monkeys with lesions of amygdala failed to avoid an aversive shock while the normal monkeys learned to avoid them. He concluded that a key function of the amygdala was to connect external stimuli with aversive consequences. Following Weiskrantz&#x27;s discovery many researchers used avoidance conditioning to study neural mechanisms of fear.

Joseph E. LeDoux has been instrumental in elucidating the amygdala&#x27;s role in fear conditioning. He was one of the first to show that the amygdala undergoes long-term potentiation during fear conditioning, and that ablation of amygdala cells disrupts both learning and expression of fear.

=== Hippocampus ===
Some types of fear conditioning (e.g. contextual and trace) also involve the hippocampus, an area of the brain believed to receive affective impulses from the amygdala and to integrate those impulses with previously existing information to make it meaningful. Some theoretical accounts of traumatic experiences suggest that amygdala-based fear bypasses the hippocampus during intense stress and can be stored somatically or as images that can return as physical symptoms or flashbacks without cognitive meaning.

The hippocampus is one of the brain regions that undergoes major alterations in gene expression after contextual fear conditioning. Contextual fear conditioning applied to a rat causes about 500 genes to be up-regulated (possibly due to DNA demethylation of CpG sites) and about 1,000 genes to be down-regulated (observed to be correlated with DNA methylation at CpG sites in promoter regions) (see Regulation of transcription in learning and memory). By 24 hours after the event, 9.17% of the genes in the genomes of rat hippocampus neurons are differentially methylated. The pattern of induced and repressed genes within hippocampal neurons appears to provide a molecular basis for forming the early transient memory of contextual fear conditioning in the hippocampus. When similar contextual fear conditioning was applied to a mouse, one hour after contextual fear conditioning there were 675 demethylated genes and 613 hypermethylated genes in the hippocampus region of the mouse brain. These changes were transient in the hippocampal neurons, and almost none of these DNA methylation alterations were present in the hippocampus after four weeks. However, in mice subjected to contextual fear conditioning, after four weeks there were more than 1,000 differentially methylated genes and more than 1,000 differentially expressed genes in the mouse anterior cingulate cortex where long-term memories are stored.

=== Molecular mechanisms ===
====Double-strand breaks====
More than 100 DNA double-strand breaks occur, both in the hippocampus and in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), in two peaks, at 10 minutes and at 30 minutes after contextual fear conditioning. This appears to be earlier than the DNA methylations and demethylations of neuron DNA in the hippocampus that were measured at one hour and 24 hours after contextual fear conditioning (described above in the section Hippocampus).

The double strand breaks occur at known memory-related immediate early genes (among other genes) in neurons after neuron activation. These double-strand breaks allow the genes to be transcribed and then translated into active proteins.

One immediate early gene newly transcribed after a double-strand break is EGR1. EGR1 is an important transcription factor in memory formation. It has an essential role in brain neuron epigenetic reprogramming. EGR1 recruits the TET1 protein that initiates a pathway of DNA demethylation. Removing DNA methylation marks allows the activation of downstream genes (see Regulation of gene expression#Regulation of transcription in learning and memory. EGR1 brings TET1 to promoter sites of genes that need to be demethylated and activated (transcribed) during memory formation. EGR-1, together with TET1, is employed in programming the distribution of DNA demethylation sites on brain DNA during memory formation and in long-term neuronal plasticity.

DNMT3A2 is another immediate early gene whose expression in neurons can be induced by sustained synaptic activity. DNMTs bind to DNA and methylate cytosines at particular locations in the genome. If this methylation is prevented by DNMT inhibitors, then memories do not form. If DNMT3A2 is over-expressed in the hippocampus of young adult mice it converts a weak learning experience into long-term memory and also enhances fear memory formation.

==== Intra-amygdala circuit ====
Neurons in the basolateral amygdala are responsible for the formation of conditioned fear memory. These neurons project to neurons in the central amygdala for the expression of a conditioned fear response. Damage to these areas in the amygdala would result in disruption of the expression of conditioned fear responses. Lesions in the basolateral amygdala have shown severe deficits in the expression of conditioned fear responses. Lesions in the central amygdala have shown mild deficits in the expression of conditioned fear responses.

===== NMDA receptors and glutamate =====
One of the major neurotransmitters involved in conditioned fear learning is glutamate. It has been suggested that NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in the amygdala are necessary for fear memory acquisition, because disruption of NMDAR function disrupts development of fear responses in rodents. In addition, the associative nature of fear conditioning is reflected in the role of NMDARs as coincident detectors, where NMDAR activation requires simultaneous depolarization by US inputs combined with concurrent CS activation.

Dopamine

In addition to glutamate, dopamine is involved in fear conditioning and extinction. Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars compacta, and dorsal raphe nucleus play a critical role in forming, consolidating, and retrieving fear-related memories. The amygdala is involved in the initial expression and acquisition of fear, while dopamine receptor activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum works to link fear expression to CS.

=== Epigenetics ===
Conditioned fear may be inherited transgenerationally. In one experiment, mice were conditioned to fear an acetophenone odor and then set up to breed subsequent generations of mice. Those subsequent generations of mice also showed a behavioral sensitivity to acetophenone, which was accompanied by neuroanatomical and epigenetic changes that are believed to have been inherited from the parents&#x27; gametes.

== Across development ==
The learning involved in conditioned fear, as well as the underlying neurobiology, changes dramatically from infancy, across childhood and adolescence, into adulthood and aging. Specifically, infant animals show an inability to develop fear associations, whereas their adult counterparts develop fear memories much more readily.

Previous research has indicated that adolescents show hampered fear extinction learning compared to children and adults. This finding may have clinical implications, as one of the most widely used treatments for anxiety disorders is exposure based therapy, which builds on the principles of fear extinction. The exact mechanisms underlying the developmental differences in fear extinction learning have not yet been discovered, although it has been suggested that age related differences in connectivity between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex can be one of the biological mechanisms underpinning the developmental change in fear extinction learning.

=== Prior experience with stress ===
A history of stressors preceding a traumatic event increases the effect of fear conditioning in rodents. This phenomenon, named Stress-Enhanced Fear Learning (SEFL), has been demonstrated in both young (e.g. Poulos et al. 2014) and adult (e.g. Rau et al. 2009) rodents. Biological mechanisms underpinning SEFL have not yet been made clear, though it has been associated with a rise in corticosterone, the stress hormone, following the initial stressor.

<text>The Battle of Beersheba (, ) was fought on 31 October 1917, when the British Empire&#x27;s Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) attacked and captured the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Yildirim Army Group garrison at Beersheba, beginning the Southern Palestine Offensive of the Sinai and Palestine campaign of World War I.

==Overview==
On 31 October 1917, infantry from the 60th (London) and the 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions of the XX Corps from the southwest conducted limited attacks in the morning, then the Anzac Mounted Division (Desert Mounted Corps) launched a series of attacks against the strong defences, which dominated the eastern side of Beersheba, resulting in their capture during the late afternoon. Shortly afterwards, the Australian Mounted Division&#x27;s 4th and 12th light horse regiments (4th Light Horse Brigade) conducted a mounted infantry charge with bayonets in their hands, their only weapon for mounted attack, as their rifles were slung across their backs. Part of the two regiments dismounted to attack entrenchments on Tel es Saba defending Beersheba. The remainder of the light horsemen continued their charge into the town, capturing the place and part of the garrison as it was withdrawing.

German general Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein was commander of the three divisions of the Ottoman Fourth Army. He further strengthened his defensive line stretching from Gaza to Beersheba after the EEF defeats at the first and second battles of Gaza in March and April 1917, and received reinforcements of two divisions. Meanwhile, Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode, commanding the EEF&#x27;s Eastern Force, began the stalemate in Southern Palestine, defending essentially the same entrenched lines held at the end of the second battle. He initiated regular mounted reconnaissance into the open eastern flank of the Gaza to Beersheba line towards Beersheba. The data provided by the Jewish Nili spy ring was particularly important for the conquest of Beersheba and Jerusalem. The information also contributed to the successful British offensive at Beersheba (October 1917), a key operation that opened the way to the eventual capture of Jerusalem. Detailed maps and reports of the Ottoman defensive positions enabled the British to carry out targeted attacks.

In June, the Ottoman Fourth Army was reorganised when the new Yildirim Army Group was established, commanded by German General Erich von Falkenhayn. About the same time, British General Edmund Allenby replaced General Archibald Murray as commander of the EEF. Allenby reorganised the EEF to give him direct command of three corps, in the process deactivating Chetwode&#x27;s Eastern Force and placing him in command of one of the two infantry corps. Chauvel&#x27;s Desert Column was renamed the Desert Mounted Corps. The stalemate continued through the summer in difficult conditions on the northern edge of the Negev Desert, while EEF reinforcements began to strengthen the divisions, which had suffered more than 10,000 casualties during the two battles for Gaza.

The primary functions of the EEF and the Ottoman Army during this time were to man the front lines and patrol the open eastern flank. Both sides conducted training of all units. The XXI Corps maintained the defences in the Gaza sector of the line by mid-October, while the battle of Passchendaele continued on the Western Front. Meanwhile, Allenby was preparing for the manoeuvre warfare attacks on the Ottoman defensive line, beginning with Beersheba, and for the subsequent advance to Jerusalem. He neared completion of this plan, with the arrival of the last reinforcements.

Beersheba was defended by lines of trenches supported by isolated redoubts on earthworks and hills, which covered all approaches to the town. The Ottoman garrison was eventually encircled by the two infantry and two mounted divisions, as they and their supporting artillery launched their attacks. The 60th (London) Division&#x27;s preliminary attack and capture of the redoubt on Hill 1070 led to the bombardment of the main Ottoman trench line. Then a joint attack by the 60th (London) and 74th (Yeomanry) divisions captured all their objectives. Meanwhile, the Anzac Mounted Division cut the road to the northeast of Beersheba, from Beersheba to Hebron and continuing to Jerusalem. Continuous fighting against the main redoubt and defences on Tel el Saba, which dominated the eastern approaches to the town, resulted in its capture in the afternoon.

During this fighting, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been sent to reinforce the Anzac Mounted Division. The 5th Mounted Brigade remained in corps reserve, armed with swords. With all brigades of both mounted divisions already committed to the battle, the only brigade available was the 4th Light Horse Brigade, which was ordered to capture Beersheba. These swordless mounted infantrymen galloped over the plain, riding towards the town and a redoubt, supported by entrenchments on a mound at Tel es Saba, south-east of Beersheba. The 4th Light Horse Regiment on the right jumped trenches, before turning to make a dismounted attack on the Ottoman infantry in the trenches, gun pits, and redoubts. Most of the 12th Light Horse Regiment on the left rode on, across the face of the main redoubt to find a gap in the Ottoman defenses, crossing the railway line into Beersheba to complete the first step of an offensive. This culminated in the EEF&#x27;s capture of Jerusalem six weeks later.

== Background ==

After their second defeat at Gaza in April, General Archibald Murray sacked the commander of Eastern Force, Lieutenant General Charles Dobell. Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode was promoted to command Eastern Force, while Harry Chauvel was promoted to lieutenant general with command of the Desert Column. Major General Edward Chaytor was promoted from the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, to command the Anzac Mounted Division replacing Chauvel. With the arrival of General Edmund Allenby in June, Murray was also relieved of command of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), and sent back to England.

Although the strategic priorities of Enver Pasha and the Ottoman general staff were to push the EEF back to the Suez Canal and retake Baghdad, Mesopotamia, and Persia, the EEF was fortunate that the victorious Ottoman forces were not in a position in April 1917 to launch a large-scale counterattack immediately after their second victory at Gaza. Such an attack against rudimentary EEF defences on the northern edge of the Negev could have been disastrous for the EEF. 

Instead, both sides constructed permanent defences stretching from the sea west of Gaza to Shellal on the Wadi Ghazzeh. From Shellal, the lightly entrenched EEF line extended to El Gamli before continuing south to Tel el Fara. The western sector, stretching from Gaza to Tel el Jemmi, was strongly entrenched, wired and defended by EEF and Ottoman infantry. The eastern sector, stretching east and south across the open plain, was patrolled by Desert Column&#x27;s mounted infantry and yeomanry. At every opportunity patrols and outposts harassed opposing forces, while wells and cisterns were mapped.

The town of Gaza was strongly defended, having been developed into &quot;a strong modern fortress, well entrenched and wired, with good observation and a glacis on its southern and south–eastern face&quot;. From Gaza, the formidable Ottoman front line stretching eastwards, dominated the country to the south, where the EEF was deployed in open, low-lying country cut by deep wadis. The Ottoman defences in the centre of the line, at Atawineh and Hairpin redoubts at Hareira and Teiaha, supported each other as they overlooked the plain, making a frontal attack virtually impossible. Between Gaza and Hareira, the Ottoman defences were strengthened and extended along the Gaza-to-Beersheba road, east of the Palestine Railway line from Beersheba. Although these trenches did not extend to Beersheba, strong fortifications made the isolated town into a fortress.
The open eastern flank was dominated by the Wadi Ghazzeh, which, at the beginning of the stalemate, could only be crossed in five places. These were at the mouth on the Mediterranean coast, the main Deir el Belah-to-Gaza road crossing, the Tel el Jemmi crossing (used during the first battle of Gaza), the Shellal crossing on the Khan Yunis-to-Beersheba road, and the Tel el Fara crossing on the Rafa-to-Beersheba road. The difficulty of crossing the wadi elsewhere was due to the perpendicular banks cut into the Gaza–Beersheba plain by regular floods. Additional crossings were constructed during the stalemate.

Beersheba (Hebrew: &quot;Be-er Sheva&quot;; Arabic: &quot;Bir es Sabe&quot;), at the foot of the Judean Hills, was built on the eastern bank of the Wadi es Saba, which joins the Wadi Ghazzeh at Bir el Esani, before stretching to the Mediterranean Sea. Located at the north-west end of a flat, treeless plain about long by wide, the town is surrounded by rocky hills and outcrops. To the north–north–east, away on the southern edge of the Judean Hills, the Tuweiyil Abu Jerwal rises to behind the town, overlooking it by ; lower hills range east and south, with a spur of the plateau of Edom on the south-east, extending towards the town.
Since ancient times, the town had been a trading centre, with roads radiating from it in all directions. To the north-east the only sealed, metalled motor road in the region stretched along a spine of the Judean Hills to Jerusalem via Edh Dhahriye, Hebron and Bethlehem, along the Wadi el Khalil (a tributary of the Wadi es Saba). To the north-west the road to Gaza away crossed the open plain, to the west the track to Rafa via Tel el Fara (on the Wadi Ghazzeh), while the southern road to Asluj and Hafir el Auja continued the metalled road from Jerusalem.

Beersheba was developed by the Ottoman Empire from a camel-trading centre on the northern edge of the Negev, halfway between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It was on the railway line which ran from Istanbul to Hafir el Auja, the main Ottoman desert base during the raid on the Suez Canal in 1915 until the EEF advance to Rafa outflanked it, and which was damaged beyond repair in May 1917 during an EEF raid. Beersheba&#x27;s hospital, army barracks, railway station with water tower, engine sheds, large storage buildings, and a square of houses, were well-designed and strongly-constructed stone buildings, with red tiled roofs and a German beer garden. The inhabitants of the region from Beersheba northwards varied. The population were mainly Sunni Arabs, with some Jewish and Christian colonists.

The EEF had already decided to invade Ottoman territory before the first battle of Gaza, on the basis of Britain&#x27;s three major war objectives: to maintain maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean; preserve the balance of power in Europe; and protect Egypt, India and the Persian Gulf. Despite the EEF&#x27;s defeats during the first two battles of Gaza, with about 10,000 casualties, Allenby planned an advance into Palestine and the capture of Jerusalem to secure the region and cut off the Ottoman forces in Mesopotamia from those in the Levant and on the Arabian Peninsula. The capture of Gaza, which dominated the coastal route from Egypt to Jaffa, was a first step towards these aims.

=== Lines of communication ===

During the stalemate from April to the end of October 1917, the EEF and the Ottoman Army improved their lines of communication, laid more railway and water lines and sent troops, guns and ammunition forward to defend their front lines. While the Ottoman lines of communication were shortened by the retreat across the Sinai, the EEF advance across the Sinai Peninsula into southern Palestine lengthened theirs, requiring a large investment in infrastructure. Since a brigade of light horse, mounted rifles, or mounted yeomanry (including infantry divisions) consisted of about 2,000 soldiers requiring ammunition, rations and supplies, this was a major undertaking.

By March 1917, of metalled road, of wire-and-brushwood roads and of water pipeline had been constructed, and of railway lines laid at a rate of one kilometre a day. The railhead had been from Gaza, but by mid-April the line had reached Deir el Belah, with a branch line to Shellal completed. Since the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps alone could not support a large offensive in advance of the railhead, horse- and mule-drawn wagon trains were established. Supply columns were designed to support military operations by infantry and mounted troops for about 24 hours beyond the railhead.

== Prelude ==

=== Ottoman force ===
Several weeks after the Ottoman victory at the Second Battle of Gaza, General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein, commander of the victorious 3rd, 16th and 53rd divisions of the Fourth Army, was reinforced by the 7th and 54th divisions. Until June 1917, Sheria was the headquarters of the German commanded Ottoman force defending the Gaza-Beersheba line, but as a consequence of EEF aerial bombing, it was moved to Huj in July. 

This force was reorganised into two corps to hold the Gaza-to-Beersheba line: the XX Corps (16th and 54th infantry divisions with the 178th Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Cavalry Division), and the XXII Corps (3rd, 7th, and 53rd infantry divisions). By July, the Ottoman force defending the Gaza-to-Beersheba line had increased to 151,742 rifles, 354 machine guns and 330 artillery guns. While the XXII Corps defended Gaza with the 3rd and 53rd divisions, the XX Corps was headquartered at Huj.

Beersheba was defended by the III Corps. It was commanded by the recently arrived Ismet (or Esmet) Bey, who had his headquarters in the town. The III Corps had defended Gallipoli in 1915. &quot;[T]he Ottoman Army could still hold its own against the British Army ... [and] showed a high level of operational and tactical mobility&quot; during the battles for the Gaza to Beersheba line. This corps consisted of the 67th and 81st regiments (27th Division), a total of 2,408 rifles, of whom 76 percent were Arab, the 6th and the 8th regiments of lancers (3rd Cavalry Division), the 48th Regiment (16th Division) and the 2nd Regiment (24th Division). The 143rd Regiment of the Ottoman XX Corps was about north-north-west of Beersheba in the Judean Hills, but took &quot;no part in the action&quot;. A total of 4,400 rifles, 60 machine guns and 28 field guns in these lancer and infantry regiments were available for the defence of Beersheba.

The tactical deployment of the Ottoman III, XX and XXII corps defending the Gaza-to-Beersheba line did not change when Enver Pasa activated the Yildirim Army Group, also known as Thunderbolt Army Group and Group F, in June 1917. This new group, commanded by German general and Ottoman marshal Erich von Falkenhayn, former Prussian minister of war, chief of staff of the German field armies and commander of the Ninth Army, was reinforced by surplus Ottoman units transferred from Galicia, Romania and Thrace after the collapse of Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erickson1,157/71,7,115&quot;&gt;Erickson 2001 pp. 159, 171, 2007 p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Yildirim Army Group consisted of the Fourth Army headquarters and Syrian units commanded by Cemal Pasa which remained in Syria, and the Fourth Army headquarters in Palestine commanded by Kress von Kressenstein. The Fourth Army headquarters in Palestine was inactivated on 26 September 1917, and reorganised into two armies and renamed. Six days later it was reactivated as the new Ottoman Eighth Army headquarters, still commanded by Kress von Kressenstein and responsible for the Palestine front. The new Seventh Army was also activated, commanded by Fevzi Pasa after the resignation of Mustafa Kemal.

==== Beersheba defences ====

The natural features around the town favoured defence. Beersheba, on a rolling plain devoid of trees or water to its west, was dotted with hills and tells to its north, south and east. These geographic features were strengthened by a series of entrenchments, fortifications and redoubts. Well-constructed trenches, protected by wire, fortified defences north-west, west and south-west of Beersheba. This semicircle of entrenchments included well-sited redoubts on a series of high points extending up to from the town.
Defending the east of Beersheba, Tel el Saba redoubt was manned by a battalion of the 48th Regiment and a machine-gun company. The 6th and 8th regiments of the 3rd Cavalry Division were deployed on the high ground to the north-east, in the foothills of the Judean Hills, to guard the Jerusalem road and keep Beersheba from being surrounded. To the west and south-west of the town, the 27th Division&#x27;s 67th and 81st infantry regiments were deployed in a fortified semicircular line of deep trenches and redoubts strengthened by barbed wire. These regiments consisted primarily of &quot;Arab farmers from the surrounding region, and although inexperienced fighters they were defending their own fields&quot;.

The defenders were deployed as follows:

* The 67th Infantry and the 81st Infantry regiments (27th Division), defended Beersheba from the west, and from south of the Wadi el Saba
* The 3rd Cavalry Division was deployed in the high ground northeast of the town,
* One battalion of the 48th Infantry Regiment (16th Division) and a machine gun company defended Tel es Saba, with the remainder of the regiment deployed to the south from the Khalasa road to Ras Ghannam
* Two battalions of the 2nd Regiment of Anatolian riflemen from Chanak, commanded by German officers, were deployed in trenches defending the south-east, facing the open plain south of Tel el Saba

=== EEF ===

The EEF was reinforced by the arrival in June and July of the 7th and 8th mounted brigades and the 60th (London) Division, transferred from Salonika; the 75th Division was formed in Egypt from territorial and Indian battalions. The arrival of the two mounted brigades made it possible to expand and reorganise the Desert Column into three divisions, with the establishment of the Yeomanry Mounted Division. However, 5,150 infantry and 400 yeomanry reinforcements were still needed in July to bring the infantry and mounted divisions that had taken part in the first two battles for Gaza, back up to strength. The last reinforcements to arrive before the battle, the 10th (Irish) Division, were marching north from Rafa on 29 October.

After General Allenby took command of the EEF at midnight on 28 June, he reorganised the force to reflect contemporary thinking and to resemble the organisation of Allenby&#x27;s army in France. He deactivated Eastern Force, establishing in its place two infantry and one mounted corps under his command: the XX, the XXI corps and the Desert Mounted Corps, formerly the Desert Column.

By 30 October, there were 47,500 rifles in the XX Corps. They were the 53rd (Welsh) Division, the 60th (London) Division, and the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, with the 10th (Irish) Division and the 1/2nd County of London Yeomanry attached, and about 15,000 troopers in two divisions of the Desert Mounted Corps deploying for the attack on Beersheba. Most of Allenby&#x27;s infantry were Territorial Force divisions, mobilised following the outbreak of the war. Several of the divisions had fought in the Gallipoli Campaign, the 52nd (Lowland) at Cape Helles, the 53rd (Welsh) at Suvla Bay, along with the 54th (East Anglian) Division.

The 60th (London) Division had served on the Western Front and at Salonika. The 74th (Yeomanry) Division had recently been formed from 18 under–strength yeomanry regiments which had fought dismounted at Gallipoli. The 10th (Irish) Division, a New Army (K1) division, had fought at Gallipoli, at Suvla Bay and Salonika. The light horse and mounted rifle brigades in the Anzac and the Australian Mounted Divisions had fought dismounted on Gallipoli.

==== Plan of attack ====

Chetwode&#x27;s XX Corps, with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade attached, and Chauvel&#x27;s Desert Mounted Corps, minus the Yeomanry Mounted Division at Shellal, would make the main attack on Beersheba. Bulfin&#x27;s XXI Corps held the Gaza sector entrenchments and the front line to the Mediterranean coast. Success at Beersheba depended on an attack with &quot;resolution and vigour&quot;, because if unsuccessful, the dry, inhospitable country on the northern edge of the Negev would force attacking divisions to retire.

Allenby&#x27;s army-level and corps-level plans set out their objectives. The XX Corps would advance from the south and south-west towards Beersheba. The 60th (London) and 74th (Yeomanry) divisions would attack the defences between the Khalassa-to-Beersheba road and the Wadi Saba. Beginning immediately after dawn, the two infantry divisions would attack the outer defences on the high ground west and south-west of Beersheba in two stages, preceded by a bombardment.

The left of the 60th (London) Division was to capture Hill 1070, also known as Point/Hill 1069, part of the outer defences. The main attack would begin when commanders of the 60th (London) and 74th (Yeomanry) divisions were &quot;satisfied that the wire was adequately cut&quot;. Their objectives were the trenches defending Beersheba and the Ottoman artillery batteries supporting them. Subsequently, they would hold the high ground on the west side of the town.

Their left flank would be protected by &quot;Smith&#x27;s Group&quot;, consisting of the 158th Brigade (53rd Division) minus two battalions and the Imperial Camel Brigade. This group, under orders from the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, held the section of the Beersheba defence stretching north from the Wadi es Saba, towards the Beersheba-to-Tel el Fara road. 

The 53rd (Welsh) Division, with a brigade of the 10th (Irish) Division attached, was deployed on a line stretching west to about from the Karm railway station. They would watch for a counterattack from Hareira to the north, and capture the Beersheba garrison if it attempted to retreat along the road to Gaza. The remainder of the 10th (Irish) Division in XX Corps reserve, was deployed east of the Wadi Ghuzzee at Shellal, where the Yeomanry Mounted Division, under Allenby, was to deploy a line of outposts connecting the XX and XXI corps, holding the Gaza end of the line near el Mendur.

The first stage of the attack by the Anzac Mounted Division, with the Australian Mounted Division in reserve, was to seize the Ottoman garrison&#x27;s northern line of retreat by cutting the road to Jerusalem. Secondly, the mounted divisions were to attack and capture Beersheba, and its water wells, as quickly as possible, to prevent the retreat of the Ottoman garrison. On their left, the 7th Mounted Brigade&#x27;s two regiments would link the XX Corps with the Desert Mounted Corps, and attack the defences south of the town.

==== Preliminary moves ====

Beginning on 24 October the Australian Mounted Division moved to Rashid Bek; the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade moved to Esani, following the 2nd Light Horse Brigade&#x27;s move to Bir &#x27;Asluj away, to develop the water supply, which remained inadequate on 27 October (when two regiments of the brigade at Asluj were sent back to water at Khalasa—returning at dawn on 29 October—so there would be enough water for the Anzac Mounted Division at Asluj). Allenby inspected the three projects to expand the water supply, at Khalasa from Esani, at Asluj, and the project at Shellal. He inspected preparations for the building of the forward railway (to begin simultaneously with the attack), and the rear units working in the deserted camps, making them appear still in use. He also inspected EEF formations as they made their way towards their assembly places, and while they waited in the forward areas. Allenby instilled in all a sense of the importance he attached to their work. However, the Ottoman forces were informed of the build-up: &quot;There is evidence that they [Yildirim Army Group] were fairly accurately informed of the British dispositions&quot;. This was confirmed on 28 October when the Yildirim Army Group knew that the camps at Khan Yunis and Rafa were empty. They placed three infantry divisions east of the Wadi Ghuzzee with a fourth—the 10th (Irish) Division—approaching the wadi, estimating more cavalry at Asluj and Khalasa.
Reconnaissance continued on Sunday, 28 October when the 5th Mounted Brigade rode to Ras Hablein, south of the Ras Ghannam area, reporting Ottoman troops occupying redoubts and a trench line east of Abu Shar and tents at Ras Hablein. The 6th Light Horse Regiment of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, reconnoitred the Wadi Shegeib el Soghair area, reporting that the Ras Ghannam entrenchments were occupied by Ottoman Army soldiers. By 13:15 on 29 October, the water supply at Asluj was reported capable of providing one &quot;drink per day per horse for the whole division&quot;. An hour later the Desert Mounted Corps ordered the Anzac Mounted Division (less two brigades) to move from Esani to Asluj &quot;tonight&quot;, and at dusk the Australian Mounted Division began their night march (following the Anzac Mounted Division) to Esani.

While the Australian Mounted Division and the Anzac Mounted Division prepared to move east on 29 October, the guns of British and French naval ships on the Mediterranean Sea joined in the bombardment of Gaza (which had begun two days earlier). Under orders from XX Corps the Yeomanry Mounted Division, detached from the Desert Mounted Corps, moved from the Mediterranean coast to the Wadi Ghuzzee between Shellal and Tel el Fara; the infantry brigades of the 74th (Yeomanry) Division advanced to the right of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, holding the line in front of el Buqqar while the leading units of the 60th (London) Division approached Maalaga and the 10th (Irish) Division approached from Rafa. By 21:15 on 29 October, the Anzac Mounted Division (Desert Mounted Corps) had assembled at Asluj, while the Australian Mounted Division began to arrive at Khalasa from Esani.

==== Approach marches, 30–31 October ====

The extensive and complex arrangements required to support the infantry attack from the west and the mounted attack from the east were completed by 30 October, when these attacking forces moved to positions within a day&#x27;s march of their deployment. Three divisions of XX Corps were concentrated in position: the 53rd (Welsh) Division at Goz el Geleib, the 60th (London) Division at Esani and the 74th (Yeomanry) Division at Khasif. In preparation for their final approach march, the Civil Service Rifles and the Queen&#x27;s Westminster Rifles (179th Brigade, 60th Division) were supplied with tea and rum for the following day. In their haversack rations were five onions, a tin of bully beef, a slice of cooked bacon, biscuits and dates.

Chetwode opened his advance XX Corps headquarters at 17:00 at el Buqqar, and a half-hour later the infantry approach marches began. The 74th (Yeomanry) Division advanced along the Tel el Fara-to-Beersheba road led by the 229th Brigade, with one brigade following to the north and another to the south of the road. The 60th (London) Division advanced from Abu Ghalyun, Bir el Esani and Rashid Bek in three brigade groups, the 181st Brigade (on the left) advanced north and south of the Wadi es Saba, while the 179th Brigade (on the right) advanced towards the Khalasa-to-Beersheba road. Their advance guard, the 2/13th Battalion, London Regiment, was attacked as they crossed the Wadi Halgon. Behind the 179th Brigade, the 180th Brigade in reserve advanced straight across from Esani. The XX Corps Cavalry Regiment, the Westminster Dragoons, concentrated to the south-east, covering the corps&#x27; right flank with orders to connect with the Desert Mounted Corps south of Beersheba. In the rear, the 53rd (Welsh) Division dug in along the Wadi Hanafish; the XX Corps artillery, the last to move, approached from el Buqqar to the Wadi Abushar, arriving at 03:15 on 31 October. Reconnaissance had established that the Tel el Fara-to-Beersheba track (via Khasif and el Buqqar) could be used by the mechanical transport required to move the heavy gun battery and ammunition into position before the attack. This job was done by 135 lorries in three companies which travelled across the Sinai from Cairo. In addition, ammunition was hauled forward by 134 Holt tractors.
The deployment of the infantry divisions was completed by the light of a full moon. The 60th (London) Division linked with the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, after reaching their line of deployment at 03:25 while being targeted by rifle and shell fire. As the Civil Service Rifles battalion approached to between from the Ottoman trenches, snipers fired on them.

Before they could deploy, the two mounted divisions of Desert Mounted Corps had to ride between , to bring them within striking distance of Beersheba at dawn on 31 October. Chauvel arrived at the Asluj Desert Mounted Corps headquarters during the afternoon of 30 October, when arrangements were completed for the continuation of the marches by the Anzac and Australian mounted divisions. The Anzac Mounted Division was at Asluj, the Australian Mounted Division was at Khalasa (three hours&#x27; march behind) and the 7th Mounted Brigade was at Bir el Esani. The No. 11 Light Armoured Motor Battery (LAMB) was sent ahead of the Anzac Mounted Division to a position on the north slopes of the Gebel el Shereif to guard their flank as they moved forward. The divisional headquarters at Asluj closed at 17:30, and the last Anzac divisional troops left the railway station a half-hour later.
From Asluj, the Anzac Mounted Division rode along the banks of the Wadi Imshash for about , arriving about midnight at the crossroads east of Thaffha. Here, the division paused for two hours before continuing in two columns. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade column rode northeast, following the track to Bir Arara where the leading regiment, the 7th Light Horse arrived at 02:00. They waited until 04:00 for the remainder of the brigade to arrive before continuing the advance towards Bir el Hamman. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade encountered an Ottoman outpost, occupying Hill 1390 south-west of Hamam, which fired on a screen of the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade. The 7th Light Horse Regiment moved forward to occupy the Hill 1200-to-Hill 1150 line north of Hamam, at 07:00, while the brigade remained at Bir el Hamam until 09:30. The Anzac Mounted Division (less the 2nd Light Horse Brigade)—led by the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment (New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade) in the second column—rode north from the crossroads east of Thaffha past Goz Esh Shegeib. Here a small force of Ottoman soldiers were &quot;brushed aside&quot; before the advance continued to Iswaiwin. As the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade approached Iswaiwin at 06:45, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade could be seen arriving at Bir el Hamman. Opposition units were seen in trenches near Hill 1070 (also known as Hill 1069, the EEF infantry&#x27;s first objective on the western side of Beersheba), and about two hostile squadrons were seen moving north from Beersheba towards Kh el Omry. Dust and smoke were also seen rising from Chetwode&#x27;s XX Corps artillery bombardment, west and south-west of Beersheba. After passing Iswaiwin, the Anzac Mounted Division concentrated near Khashim Zanna, on a line from Bir el Hamman to Bir Salim Abu Irgeig.

Following in reserve, the Australian Mounted Division marched out of Khalasa at 17:00 to arrive at Asluj at 20:30 on 30 October. After watering only their transport animals, they began their approach march from Asluj at 24:00 (following the Anzac Mounted Division on their ride) arriving at 04:50 on 31 October at the Thaffha crossroads. The division continued, until linking with Desert Mounted Corps headquarters at 10:15 and establishing their divisional headquarters at Khashim Zanna (on Hill 1180) at 12:30. Khashm Zanna, from Beersheba and south of the main Ottoman defence on the eastern side of Beersheba at Tel el Saba, gave a clear view of the Beersheba plain and the battlefield. Their headquarters joined the headquarters of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Desert Mounted Corps, which had arrived at dawn on 31 October.

The 7th Mounted Brigade advanced direct from Bir el Esani to the vicinity of Goz en Naam, cutting the Khalasa-to-Beersheba road and holding a line connecting the XX Corps on their left and the Australian Mounted Division on their right. At 07:45 the brigade reported to the EEF by pigeon that they were holding a position from Goz el Namm to Point 1210, and that Ras Harlein and Ras Ghannan were held by unknown numbers of defenders.

== Battle ==
=== Bombardment ===
The coordinated EEF bombardment began a &quot;multiple–dimensional phased attack&quot; at 05:55, including successful wire-cutting on two divisional fronts. The artillery was to subsequently shift its fire to target the Ottoman fortifications, trench lines and rear areas. During these bombardments, the newly organised heavy artillery groups were to conduct counter–battery work targeting Ottoman guns. During this bombardment, shells from Ottoman counter-battery artillery fire fell on some of the assembled infantry; the 231st Brigade, 74th (Yeomanry) Division, and the 179th Brigade, 60th (London) Division, suffered severely:

The EEF bombardment was suspended to allow dust to settle and artillery observers to check their targets; the wire appeared to be still intact, The bombardment resumed at 07:45.

=== Preliminary attacks ===

At 08:20 a final, intense ten-minute bombardment targeted the Ottoman trenches in front of the infantry, to cover the work of wire-cutting units. They cut gaps in the barbed wire entanglements so the battalions of the 181st Brigade, 60th (London) Division could launch their attack on Hill 1070, also known as Hill 1069. Then the 2/22nd Battalion, London Regiment, advanced to attack the redoubt on the hill, while the 2/24th Battalion, London Regiment, attacked some defences just to the north. The 181st Brigade quickly captured both objectives, taking 90 prisoners while suffering about 100 casualties.

During this attack, the leading brigades of the 74th (Yeomanry) Division advanced to conform to the 181st Brigade&#x27;s advance. As a consequence of accurate shrapnel fire the 231st Brigade moved slightly to the right forcing the 230th Brigade (on the left), to fill the gap with two supporting companies of the 10th Buffs. As the 74th (Yeomanry) Division&#x27;s advance approached the Ottoman trenches, heavy machine-gun fire slowed their progress. By 10:40, the 231st Brigade was within of the front line; the 230th Brigade was about behind. These advances (and the capture of Hill 1070) made it possible for the EEF&#x27;s heavy guns to move forward, to target barbed wire protecting the main Ottoman defensive line and Ottoman observation posts.

=== XX Corps attack ===

With the EEF guns moved forward into captured Ottoman positions, shelling recommenced at 10:30, continuing with pauses to let the dust settle until noon, when there was still some concern that the wire in front of the 74th (Yeomanry) Division had not been cut. &quot;In practice, much of the barbed wire had to be cut by the advancing troops as they came across the obstacle.&quot;

The commanders of the 60th (London) and 74th (Yeomanry) divisions decided to begin the main assault at 12:15, screened by dust and smoke from another bombardment. Four brigades—the 179th, the 181st, (60th Division) the 231st and the 230th (74th Division)—launched the attack with two battalions in the first line (except the 181st Brigade, which deployed three). The first-line battalions were mainly organised with two of their &quot;four companies in first line, each on a front of two platoons, the companies in two &#x27;waves&#x27; each of two lines&quot;, advancing between apart with a third wave to follow (if required) behind. The 2/22nd Battalion, London Regiment, remained to guard Hill 1070.

The 2/15th Battalion, London Regiment, on the right of the 179th Brigade, suffered severely from machine-gun fire; however, when the machine-gun positions were captured all resistance ceased. The 24th and 25th battalions of the Royal Welch Fusiliers of the 231st Brigade (74th Division) &quot;met with stout resistance&quot; at one location, where the Ottoman soldiers fought to the last man. Intense hand-to-hand fighting in the trenches continued until 13:30, when the Ottoman trench line on the western side of Beersheba (stretching from the Khalasa-to-Beersheba road in the south to the Wadi es Saba in the north) was captured. For his actions, Corporal John Collins was later awarded the Victoria Cross. 

During this fighting, the two Royal Welch Fusiliers battalions captured three-quarters of the prisoners, and suffered two-thirds of the casualties of the XX Corps. The XX Corps captured 419 prisoners, six guns, &quot;numerous machine guns&quot; and materiel; casualties included 136 killed, 1,010 wounded and five missing. Most casualties were from shrapnel from Ottoman artillery and machine guns during the preliminary bombardment.

The final objective of the XX Corps, as described in the &quot;XX Corps Instructions&quot;, was to destroy the opposition units at Beersheba, in cooperation with the Desert Mounted Corps. The instructions continued, &quot;The objective of the attack by the XX Corps on Z day is the capture of the line of works between the Khelasa–Beersheba road and the Wadi esh Sabe, the capture of the enemy guns between Beersheba and the trenches west of the town, and in co-operation with the cavalry to drive the enemy from the remainder of his defences at Beersheba&quot;. However, it is claimed, &quot;West of Beersheba the XX Corps had all its objectives and could without doubt have captured Beersheba itself before the mounted troops.&quot; 

The objective of the infantry divisions was not to capture Beersheba, but to keep the main garrison occupied while the Desert Mounted Corps captured the town. The official British historian stated, &quot;The capture of Beersheba itself was the task of the Desert Mounted Corps, which required the water in the town for its horses&quot;. &quot;XX Corps Instructions&quot; stated: &quot;outposts will be placed approximately on the &#x27;Blue Line&#x27; (Tracing &quot;A&quot;) to cover the consolidation of the position and reorganisation of the attacking troops.&quot; No units were to go beyond the &quot;Blue Line&quot; without orders or to capture guns.

After the capture of the main trenches, some guns from the 60th (London) and 74th (Yeomanry) divisions were to target defences north and south of the main attack; others were deployed forward into the captured position to pursue the Ottoman forces with fire, attack stubborn defenders and deal with counterattacks. A further advance by the 2/13th Battalion, London Regiment, 60th (London) Division, through the forward infantry battalions, attacked and captured two field guns beyond the final objective with Lewis guns after forcing the Ottoman detachments to retreat. Desert Mounted Corps headquarters reported seeing Ottoman troops retiring into Beersheba at midday, but it was not until late in the afternoon that two infantry brigades of the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the Imperial Camel Brigade, monitoring these defences north of the Wadi es Saba, became uncertain that the trenches were still defended.

The 230th Brigade (74th Division) was ordered to launch an attack at 18:00 and an hour later, the reserve 230th Brigade occupied the northern trenches &quot;with little difficulty&quot;. They had been abandoned by all but a few snipers, since Beersheba had already been captured by the light-horsemen&#x27;s charge which had begun at 16:30. The 60th (London) and 74th (Yeomanry) divisions bivouacked on the battlefield behind a line of outposts; the 53rd (Welsh) Division remained, covering the western flank while the 10th (Irish) Division bivouacked at Goz el Basal.

=== Ottoman reinforcements and withdrawals ===
With the loss of two battalions of the 67th Regiment defending the western side of Beersheba, Ismet Bey, commanding the Beersheba garrison, sent in his last reserve, the third battalion of the 2nd Regiment, to reinforce the south-western sector. At the same time, he withdrew two companies of the 81st Regiment (defending the area north of the Wadi es Saba) back into Beersheba.

=== Desert Mounted Corps attacks ===

The Anzac and the Australian mounted divisions rode between from Asluj and Khalasa respectively, circling south of Beersheba during the night of 30–31 October to get into position to attack from the east. The Australian Mounted Division (in Desert Mounted Corps reserve) deployed southeast of Beersheba, near Khashim Zanna, to support the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s attacks. The 8th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade, Australian Mounted Division) was deployed as a screen, linking with the 7th Mounted Brigade on their left and the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade on their right, in front of the Australian Mounted Division.

The first objective of the Anzac Mounted Division was to cut the road from Beersheba to Hebron and Jerusalem, about north-east of the town at Tel el Sakaty, also known as Sqati, to prevent reinforcement and retreat in that direction. The second objective, the redoubt on the height of Tel el Saba (which dominated the east side of Beersheba north and south) had to be captured, before an attack across the open ground could be launched. By dawn the Anzac Mounted Division was deployed with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade at Bir Salim abu Irqaiyiq, and the 1st Light Horse Brigade in support behind the New Zealanders, with the 2nd Light Horse Brigade concentrated near Bir Hammam.

While the infantry battle was being fought on the west side of Beersheba, Edward Chaytor (commanding the Anzac Mounted Division) ordered the 2nd Light Horse Brigade to attack Tel el Sakaty at 08:00 and gain control of the Jerusalem road. At the same time, he ordered the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (with the 1st Light Horse Brigade in support) to attack the Ottoman garrison holding fortifications on Tel el Saba. These hard-fought attacks continued into the afternoon, when two regiments of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade (Australian Mounted Division) were ordered to reinforce the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s attack on Tel el Saba.

==== Tel el Sakaty ====

Soon after the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s 2nd Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigades advances began at 09:00, they were targeted by heavy artillery fire from the hills on the north side of the Beersheba-to-Jerusalem road. The two brigades were also forced to slow their advance across the plain, cut by a number of narrow, deep wadis, which made fast riding impossible. At this time, shells from the XX Corps&#x27; bombardment could be seen bursting on the hills west of Beersheba.

At 10:05, the leading troops of the 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade; not to be confused with the 7th Mounted Brigade near Ras Ghannam to the south of Beersheba) were seen approaching Tel el Sakaty. By 11:17, they reported their advance was increasingly difficult due to hostile units defending the high ground south of Sakaty. An Ottoman convoy of 10 wagons was seen leaving Beersheba on the road to Jerusalem, and the regiment was ordered to cut the road before the convoy escaped. Through heavy shell and shrapnel bombardment and point-blank machine-gun fire, they galloped to a position just south of the road. 

While an artillery battery got into position to support the light-horse regiment&#x27;s attack on Tel el Sakaty, at 11:40 the 5th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) was ordered to engage the Ottoman left flank. As they crossed the Wadi Khalil and the road to Jerusalem, the 5th Light Horse Regiment was also heavily shelled by artillery and fired on by machine guns from the high ground north and northwest overlooking the area. Five minutes later, the 7th Light Horse Regiment cut the road and captured the convoy (47 prisoners, eight horses and eight wagons loaded with forage). However, the regiment was pinned down just beyond, in a small wadi in the rough country north of Wadi Khalil by the gun battery and machine guns located on Tel el Sakaty, above the road.

With the arrival of the 5th Light Horse Regiment, by 13:30 the two regiments, supported by artillery, were advancing to attack the high ground northeast of Sakaty. At 14:45, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade reported that three Ottoman guns appeared to have been put out of action by EEF artillery fire. While they continued to hold the road to Jerusalem, the 5th and 7th light horse regiments found cover in the Wadi Aiyan, although targeted from the high ground north of Sakaty by five Ottoman machine guns, where they remained until evening. The 1,100-strong Ottoman 3rd Cavalry Division defended this hilly area north of Beersheba.

The 5th and 7th light horse regiments (2nd Light Horse Brigade) continued to hold an outpost line during the night, covering the Beersheba-to-Jerusalem road and the northeastern approaches behind Tel el Sakaty. The remainder of the 7th Light Horse Regiment withdrew south at 18:00 to bivouac for the night, with the 5th Light Horse Regiment on the right. One squadron at a time was sent to water at Bir el Hamam, and a good water supply was also found in the Wadi Hora by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. The 7th Light Horse Regiment with two men injured (one wounded in action), captured a total of 49 prisoners, 39 of whom were captured in the Wadi Aiyan.

==== Tel el Saba ====

At about 08:55, some 200 Ottoman cavalry with transport and guns were seen moving north from Beersheba along the road to Jerusalem; shortly afterwards, an aircraft reported seeing a large camp at Tel el Saba. This was the main Ottoman defensive position on the east side of Beersheba, located on the prominent of Tel el Saba and dominating the eastern side of the town. With its steep sides littered by boulders, this flat–topped hill was strongly garrisoned by a battalion (described as 300 rifles and a machine gun company of eight machine guns) deployed for general defence. Without trees or scrub for cover, the area &quot;was swept by the fire of numerous machine guns and field guns concealed in the town ... [and] on the strongly entrenched hill of Tel el Saba&quot;. Enfilade fire from two directions would have annihilated attackers.

At 09:10 the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade advanced towards Tel el Saba with the intention of enveloping it from the north, supported by Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) (which came into action at a range of ). However, at that distance the artillery was unable to make a dent on the Ottoman defence. The brigade advanced with the Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiment on the right and the Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment on the left, each supported by four machine guns. Receiving heavy machine-gun and artillery fire, the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment formed an advance guard and rode to within of Tel el Saba across open country to the Wadi Saba. Here excellent cover for horses and machine guns was found, as well as good positions from which machine gunners could provide effective suppressive fire. The frontal attack would be launched on foot, since mounted attack from any direction was impossible. The Auckland regiment launched their attack under the north bank of the wadi, advancing on a narrow front under the good cover provided by the wadi. Due to heavy Ottoman machine-gun fire, from a point from the Ottoman position the attack was slowed; one troop at a time advanced under cover from New Zealand machine guns.

By 10:00, Chaytor ordered the 1st Light Horse Brigade to reinforce the attack on Tel el Saba from the south and cooperate in the attack. The brigade sent the 3rd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade), with one subsection of a machine-gun squadron, to cover the New Zealanders&#x27; left flank. At 10:15 they made a &quot;dashing advance&quot; across the plain against artillery and machine-gun fire. Shortly afterwards two of the squadrons took up an exposed position on the bank of the wadi, covering the attackers&#x27; left flank. Heavy machine gun, Hotchkiss gun and rifle fire targeted the Ottoman position, providing covering fire for the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment attack.

The Auckland and Canterbury mounted rifles regiments engaged Ottoman soldiers near a bend in the Wadi Saba southeast of Tel el Saba at 11:00; a dismounted attack was launched by the 3rd Light Horse Regiment (with one troop from the Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment) along the south bank of the Wadi Saba. This force covered the main attack by the rest of the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment, which advanced on the north bank supported by machine-gun cover fire. At the same time, the Inverness Battery, attached to the 1st Light Horse Brigade, came into action against Tel el Saba; it covered the advances of the 3rd Light Horse Regiment and the Somerset Battery, which had moved to within of Tel el Saba. By now, the attacking artillery was heavily shelling both Ottoman defensive positions and the hard-to-find Ottoman machine-gun positions. Their positions were communicated to the artillery by flags, and accurate shelling targeted them. Hostile aircraft began to circle the battlefield, dropping bombs on groups of led horses with many casualties.

By 13:00 the 2nd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) was ordered to reinforce the left of the 3rd Light Horse Regiment. About a half-hour later, the Australian Mounted Division&#x27;s 9th and 10th light horse regiments (3rd Light Horse Brigade) and two artillery batteries were also ordered to reinforce the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s attack on Tel el Saba. The horses of the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade were all watered at 13:10 in the Wadi Saba.

Orders for a general attack on Tel el Saba issued at 13:55, while the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company (HAC), moved to reinforce the attack at 14:00. At 14:05, a squadron of the 2nd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) was deployed to give effective covering fire on the right flank with machine and Hotchkiss guns and rifles, while the rest of the 2nd Light Horse Regiment attacked and captured two blockhouses. From these recent captures, they targeted the flank of the Tel el Saba defences, causing the defenders&#x27; fire to &quot;slacken&quot;. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment was, by now across the Wadi Khalil and firing on the rear of the Tel el Saba position, but they were held up by Ottoman defenders on the slopes of the hills overlooking the Beersheba-to-Jerusalem road. The Australian and New Zealand troops from across the Wadi Saba covered the attack on Tel el Saba by the 3rd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) on the left, while the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment on the right closed in from the northeast.

The Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment began their frontal assault at 14:05, advancing steadily in short rushes under cover of all available guns and machine guns, to gain the trenches on a hill on the eastern flank east of Tel el Saba at 14:40. Here, they captured 60 prisoners and three machine guns. Two of the captured machine guns were turned against the main Ottoman redoubt, greatly weakening their position. The attacking troops of the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment reorganised before launching their final assault. They &quot;moved forward steadily, and then rushed Tel el Saba, which fell at 15:00&quot; when a machine gun and several prisoners were captured. This captured machine gun was turned on escaping Ottoman soldiers running towards Beersheba. They killed about 25 Ottoman defenders on Tel el Saba and several others in the surrounding country; while 132 prisoners, four machine guns, rifles, ammunition and horses were captured. The Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment had seven killed and 200 wounded. One squadron of the 2nd Light Horse Regiment and one squadron of 3rd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) followed the retreating Ottoman soldiers to take up a position near the junction of the wadis to the west of Tel el Saba. From there, they fired on the retiring Ottoman units moving northwest over the high ground. At the same time, one squadron of the 2nd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) advanced against a counterattack launched from Beersheba, &quot;and drove it off&quot;. Orders were received by the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade at 17:50 to put Tel el Saba &quot;in a state of defence&quot; against the possibility of more counterattacks.

Chaytor began to move his headquarters to Tel el Saba when he saw that it had been captured at 15:00. Ottoman artillery began to target Tel el Saba a quarter-hour after its capture, and several hostile aircraft bombed the Tel. The attacks continued throughout the afternoon, and when the rest of the Anzac Divisional Headquarters moved to Tel el Saba at 18:00, they were machine-gunned by hostile aircraft. Hostile aircraft dropped five bombs at 17:00 on the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, killing four and wounding twenty-eight Australians. Forty-six horses were killed, and sixteen wounded. A bomb was dropped on the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance about the same time: &quot;[s]ome six horses lay disembowlled, blood running everywhere&quot;.
==== Ottoman response ====
During the final attack and capture of Tel el Saba, the 1st Light Horse Brigade reported at 14:20 a squadron of Ottoman cavalry leaving Beersheba and heading north. At about 14:30, they targeted the Anzac divisional headquarters with high-explosive shells fired from Ottoman field guns. However, after the capture of Tel el Saba &quot;Beersheba was now untenable and, unknown to the attackers, a withdrawal was ordered&quot;. German commander of the Eighth Army Kress von Kressenstein explained:
The understrength Turkish battalion entrusted with its defence doggedly held out with great courage and in so doing fulfilled its obligation. They held up two English cavalry divisions for six hours and had prevented them from expanding their outflanking manoeuvres around the Beersheba-Hebron road.

Ismet Bey, commanding the Beersheba garrison, ordered a general retirement north from Beersheba at 16:00. He withdrew to the headquarters of the 143rd Regiment (XX Corps), located about six miles (9.7 km) north of Beersheba in the Judean Hills. At the same time, the 27th Division&#x27;s engineers were ordered to destroy the Beersheba water supply. The 48th Regiment, which had been deployed to defend the southern sector of the Beersheba defences from the Khalasa road to Ras Ghannam with one battalion and a machine-gun company defending Tel el Saba, was the first unit to retire. They moved to establish a rearguard position on the Wadi Saba before the Australian light horsemen captured the town.

==== Beersheba ====

When Tel el Saba was captured at 15:00, the Anzac Mounted Division ordered an attack on the final objective: the town of Beersheba. Chaytor ordered the 1st and the 3rd light horse brigades to make a dismounted advance to the Beersheba Mosque in the northern outskirts of Beersheba, on a line stretching from Point 1020 northwest of Tel el Saba to Point 970 south of the town. These brigades were deployed with the 9th and 10th light horse regiments (3rd Light Horse Brigade) on the right, the 1st Light Horse Brigade in the centre, and the 4th Light Horse Brigade (Australian Mounted Division) on their left.

As the 1st and 3rd light horse brigades continued their dismounted attacks, they were shelled by Ottoman artillery. By 17:30 the 1st Light Horse Brigade had blocked all exits from Beersheba in the mosque area, including the hospital and barracks, capturing 96 prisoners, hospital staff, a priest, medical-corps details and 89 patients. The brigade established an outpost line in this sector, having suffered seven men killed and 83 wounded, 68 horses killed and 23 wounded. The 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) held an outpost line north of Beersheba during the night, when a group of Ottoman soldiers approached the line at about 21:00. They were surrounded on three sides before the regiment fired on them with machine-guns, killing 50.

==== Light horse charge ====

Allenby was at Chetwode&#x27;s XX Corps headquarters at el Buqqar when he sent a telegram to Chauvel, ordering the capture of Beersheba &quot;before nightfall&quot;. However, before the telegram reached Chauvel, the 4th Light Horse Brigade was preparing for their mounted attack. Aerial reconnaissance had established the feasibility of such an attack, since the trenches stretching across the direction of the charge were not reinforced by barbed wire or horse pits. The commander of the 12th Light Horse Regiment said:
When the possibility of a charge by mounted infantry riding home was raised in the Australian Mounted Division&#x27;s Preliminary Instruction No. 1 (dated 26 October 1917), it suggested the bayonet was equal to the sword as a weapon for mounted attack &quot;if used as a sword for pointing only&quot;. The preliminary instruction advised that the bayonet be hand-held, since controlling a horse during a charge would be difficult if the bayonet was fixed to the rifle. Divisional armourers were ordered to sharpen all bayonets &quot;at once.&quot; With a 17-inch blade, the 1907 pattern bayonet practically &quot;was&quot; a small sword.

At 11:30 Brigadier William Grant&#x27;s 4th Light Horse Brigade arrived at Iswaiwin, where men and horses rested while the battle was being fought by the XX Corps and the Anzac Mounted Division, until 15:45 when they were ordered to saddle up &quot;at once&quot;. At 16:00 Grant sent for the commanders and seconds-in-command of the 4th and 12th light horse regiments, issuing orders for their attack on Beersheba. The 4th Light Horse Regiment of Victorians and the New South Wales&#x27; 12th Light Horse Regiment were from Beersheba when they formed up behind a ridge about north of Hill 1280. 

On the left of the Anzac Mounted Division, the 4th Light Horse Regiment deployed north of the Iswaiwin-to-Beersheba road, also known as the Black W road, with the 12th Light Horse Regiment south of the road on their left. They were armed with &quot;neither sword nor lance [but] ... with bayonets in their hands&quot;. The regiment&#x27;s &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; squadrons formed three squadron lines (in that order) between apart, each squadron line extended to . One subsection of the 4th Machine Gun Squadron was attached to each regiment, although Lieutenant Colonel Murray Bourchier (commander of the 4th Light Horse Regiment which fought in the trenches and redoubt) said &quot;The Hotchkiss guns were useless, the fast pace affording no time to get them into action&quot;.
While &quot;direction was given to the movement&quot; by Grant and his brigade major, with Bourchier and Cameron leading their regiments the first half-mile was covered at a walk. Afterwards, Grant joined the reserve squadrons and regimental headquarters, while the regimental commanders remained &quot;never far behind the vanguard&quot;; &quot;[a]t 16:30 the two regiments moved off at the trot, deploying at once&quot;. As the leading squadrons, preceded by scouts in front, came within range of Ottoman riflemen manning the defences &quot;directly in their track&quot; a number of horses were hit by sustained rapid fire.

In these Ottoman trenches (primarily facing south, with a few shallow trenches facing east), the defenders saw the light horsemen charge and &quot;opened fire with shrapnel on the 4th and 12th Regiments immediately they deployed&quot;. As the advance became a gallop, the 12th Light Horse Regiment was fired on from the trenches on Ras Ghannam. The Notts Battery opened fire on machine-gunners in the trenches at Ras Ghannam; after a second shot, the Ottoman soldiers were seen in retreat. The two regiments had ridden nearly when the 12th Light Horse Regiment (on the left) was targeted by heavy machine-gun fire from the direction of Hill 1180, &quot;[c]oming from an effective range which could have proved destructive; but the vigilant officers of the Essex Battery ... got the range at once, and ... put them out of action with the first few shells&quot;. 

The charging regiments were again fired on about east of Beersheba. Here the Notts Battery silenced and drove out a garrison in a redoubt at Point 980 (indicated in red on the brigade&#x27;s war-diary sketch map) which was enfilading the charge. The remainder of the 4th Machine Gun Squadron and the reserve squadron of the 12th Light Horse Regiment, advanced towards Point 980 and the town in the wadi on the left, to protect the left flank of the charging regiments.

===== 4th Light Horse Regiment attacks trenches =====


As the 4th Light Horse Regiment approached the fortifications directly in front of them, their leading squadron jumped the advance trenches at the gallop and the main , trenches, defended by Ottoman soldiers. The leading squadron then dismounted in an area of tents and dugouts in the rear, where they were joined by a troop of the 12th Light Horse Regiment. While the lead horses were galloped to cover, the troopers launched a dismounted attack on the trenches and dugouts, killing between 30 and 40, before the remainder surrendered. The defenders &quot;fought grimly, and a considerable number were killed&quot;, while four Gallipoli veterans were shot dead as they dismounted a few feet from the Ottoman trenches.
As the second line of squadrons approached the Ottoman trenches, one of the troops in &quot;B&quot; squadron dismounted, to attack and capture the advance trench before continuing to support the attack on the main trenches. Stretcher-bearers rode forward, working amidst the dismounted fighting around the earthworks, where one was shot dead at close range. After capturing the redoubt east of Beersheba, it was consolidated by the 4th Light Horse Regiment, which held the area overnight in case of counterattack.

When the leading squadrons charged up to the trenches and the redoubt, the squadron commander and about 12 troopers of 12th Light Horse Regiment dismounted to attack with rifle and bayonet, while the remainder of the regiment continued to gallop past the redoubt on the right, to ride through a gap in the defensive line. 

When the second line squadron of the 12th Light Horse Regiment approached the trenches and redoubt, most of the squadron continued mounted riding through the gap. However, as both squadron commanders had dismounted to fight in the trenches and earthworks, the troopers who continued mounted were led by captains Robey and Davies. These leading troops stopped to assemble at a point near where the road from Asluj crossed the Wadi Saba, behind the main Ottoman defences. When Robey and Davies&#x27;s mounted troopers were reorganised, they rode along the Asluj road into Beersheba in force, to capture the town.

When they reached a red brick building in Beersheba near the mosque, Robey&#x27;s squadron rode towards the western side of the town, towards the north, to reach a point about south of the railway station, then they proceeded across the railway line before turning to the right, to finish up near an oval roofed building on the northern outskirts of the town. Meanwhile, Davies&#x27; squadron rode up the main street to join Robey on the northern outskirts. Here both squadrons turned about, to stop and capture an Ottoman column, attempting to escape Beersheba. Most of the column surrendered along with nine guns. One troop &quot;silenced&quot; Ottoman soldiers holding trenches east of Beersheba when about 60 of them tried to escape. They were recaptured by a troop from the 12th Light Horse Regiment&#x27;s &quot;C&quot; Squadron. A large proportion of the Ottoman troops in the town, were eventually killed or captured. It has been estimated more than half the Ottoman dismounted troops in Beersheba, were captured or killed, while 15 of the 28 guns in the town were captured. 

The 12th Light Horse Regiment handed over 37 officers and 63 other ranks prisoners to brigade headquarters at 23:00 with four guns and transport. Together the 4th and 12th light horse regiments captured 1,148 prisoners, 10 field guns, four machine guns, a huge quantity of military stores, an aerodrome, and railway rolling stock. Total captures by Desert Mounted Corps for the day amounted to 1,528 prisoners. All available engineer units were sent to develop the wells in the town but the supply was not great. Fortunately on 25 October there had been thunderstorms which left pools of water over a wide area from which the horses were watered.

The prisoners were moved to an area, near the railway viaduct on the outskirts of Beersheba, where they were assembled and counted. Only the 3rd Cavalry Division had managed to withdraw earlier in the day. Meanwhile, the 12th Light Horse Regiment established all round defensive positions, including picquets guarding the pumping station which were withdrawn at 23:00, when brigade headquarters arrived, and took over garrisoning duties. A patrol of one NCO and eight men made a reconnaissance at 23:00, towards the southwest returning at 03:00, with 23 prisoners to report &quot;All Clear.&quot; The 12th Light Horse Regiment bivouacked at 24:00 in Beersheba before being ordered at 04:00 to stand to arms and saddled up.

The capture of Beersheba by the 12th Light Horse Regiment has been largely written out of history. &quot;The honor and the glory of securing the town went to the 4th Australian Light Horse in a cavalry charge that in notoriety ranks with the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaklava in 1854.&quot; Allenby overlooks the 12th Light Horse Regiment&#x27;s capture of Beersheba in his report to Clive Wigram intended for King George V. According to him, only the 4th Light Horse Regiment, charged and captured the town. &quot;Time was short, and the Brigade Commander, Brigadier–General Grant DSO, sent his leading regiment to charge the trenches. This Regiment, the 4th Light Horse, galloped over the trenches, which were 8 feet deep and 4 feet wide, and full of Turks. This ended all resistance, and put a neat finish to the battle.&quot; His Despatches of 16 December 1917 to the Secretary of State for War, republished in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; do not identify further, the &quot;Australian Light Horse,&quot; be they regiments or brigades.

===== Supporting units =====
Chauvel ordered the 5th and 7th mounted brigades to move in support by following the charge, with the 7th Mounted Brigade covering the left as it advanced from the direction of Ras Ghannam; and at 16:40, the 11th Light Horse Regiment was ordered by the 4th Light Horse Brigade to advance in support. These supporting units have been described as the 11th Light Horse Regiment &quot;follow[ing] at the trot, and then came FitzGerald&#x27;s 5th Mounted Brigade, while away on the left the 7th Mounted Brigade advanced briskly along the Khalasa road&quot;, there was no &quot;substantial following in close support.

The 11th Light Horse Regiment&#x27;s 489 troopers and 23 officers were about to the southwest, covering the outpost line connecting the Australian Mounted Division with the 7th Mounted Brigade across the Iswaiwin-to-Beersheba road. They had replaced the 8th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) at 15:45. At 17:30 the 11th Light Horse Regiment moved to rejoin the 4th Light Horse Brigade headquarters, arriving in Beersheba at 19:30. The regiment then moved to the western and northern edges of the town, to man an outpost line against a counterattack.

The 5th Mounted Brigade, trained and armed for a mounted attack, was &quot;close behind Chauvel&#x27;s headquarters,&quot; while the 4th Light Horse Brigade was &quot;nearer Beersheba&quot;, when the decision to charge was made. &quot;Chauvel had hesitated for a moment whether to employ the 5th Mounted Brigade, which was in reserve and was armed with the sword unlike the Australians, but as the 4th Light Horse Brigade was close in he decided that it should attack.&quot; Although the 5th Mounted Brigade was ordered to advance on Beersheba in the rear of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, the Worcestershire Yeomanry saddled up and rode to water at Hannam at 16:00. The regiment eventually &quot;moved off as rearguard to Bde (5th Mounted Brigade)&quot; at 21:30, arriving in Beersheba at 00:30 on 1 November.

The 7th Mounted Brigade, with one section of the Light Armoured Motor Battery and one Ford car attached, had ridden out of Esani at 20:00 on 30 October across country (via Itweil el Semin) to Ras Ghannam on the Asluj-to-Beersheba road. They were about south of Beersheba, when they established links with the Desert Mounted Corps on the right and the XX Corps on the left, at the Khalasa-to-Beersheba road. Their orders were to hold a line covering Point 1210, south of Ras Ghannam and Gos en Naam. 

They established observation posts on a line south of Ras Ghannam stretching to Gos en Naam, established communications with the Australian Mounted Division south-west of Khashim Zanna at 09:00, and was in close touch with the XX Corps Cavalry Regiment. The remainder of the brigade assembled south of their outpost line, &quot;ready to act&quot;. At about 10:00 the 8th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) reported that its headquarters were at Point 1180, that Ras Ghannam was strongly defended, and that they were in touch with the 7th Mounted Brigade on their left. The 7th Mounted reported at 13:45 that their battery had shelled the opposition &quot;en masse&quot; on the northern slopes of Ras Ghannam.
At 16:00, when the Ottoman garrison was reported to have begun its retreat from Beersheba, the 7th Mounted Brigade received orders to cooperate (from the direction of Ras Ghannam) in the Australian Mounted Division attack on Beersheba. Verbal orders to cooperate in the attack were also received by the 7th Mounted Brigade from the 4th Light Horse Brigade half-an-hour later. The leading squadron of the Sherwood Rangers Regiment pushed forward with a squadron of the Notts Hussars, which had been holding the line from Point 1210 to Ras Ghannam. They arrived at Ras Ghannam at 16:50 to find the defenders gone &quot;without firing a shot&quot;. The rest of the Sherwood Rangers Regiment were occupying the trenches east of Ras Ghannam when they were informed that Beersheba had been captured by the 4th Light Horse Brigade. Then the 7th Mounted Brigade rode unopposed down the Asluj road into Beersheba to water their horses at about 23:00.

=== Casualties ===
The XX Corps captured 419 prisoners while Desert Mounted Corps captured 1,528 Ottoman soldiers. Ottoman casualties were believed to be about half that number, while around 500 dead were found on the battlefield.

The heaviest Allied losses were suffered by the British infantry of XX Corps (which lost 116 killed in action), although the total number of the British force killed during the battle was 171. The 4th Light Horse Brigade suffered a total of 35 killed and 39 wounded; of these, the 12th Light Horse Regiment suffered 20 killed and 19 wounded. Most of the wounded light horsemen fell during the charge, with the high percentage of killed-to-wounded occurring during hand-to-hand fighting in the trenches.

== Aftermath ==

The XX Corps and Desert Mounted Corps won a tactical victory of manoeuvre, forcing the Ottoman garrison at Beersheba to withdraw. Although the 53rd (Welsh) Division—with one brigade of the 10th (Irish) Division attached—had been deployed to prevent Ottoman units escaping the battle, the Beersheba garrison was able to withdraw &quot;up the Gaza road and to the north&quot; into the Judean Hills, along the road towards Hebron, Bethlehem and Jerusalem. The Beersheba garrison suffered many casualties. &quot;Stubborn fighting&quot; by strong Ottoman rearguards at Hareira, Tel es Sheria and Tel el Khuweilfe, delayed the EEF for seven days, as they continued to hold the remainder of the Gaza line. 

The Ottoman III Corps headquarters, which had withdrawn from Beersheba to Tel es Sheria during the battle, moved back to support the defence of the road to Hebron at Dhahriye, followed by the 143rd Regiment (24th Division) and 1,500 rifles of the former Beersheba Group, which had been reorganised at Tel es Sheria. The latter group moved to reinforce the defence of Tel el Khuweilfe, where the battle began on 1 November.

On 1 November attacks by the Anzac Mounted Division towards Tel el Khuweilfe and the road to Hebron and Jerusalem concerned the Ottoman defenders, who feared that a major cavalry attack could breakthrough the Ottoman line and capture the Seventh Army headquarters at Hebron. However, the EEF planned to break the Ottoman line in the centre, at Hareira and Sheria. As the fighting at Khuweilfe continued, a minor attack on Gaza was made overnight on 1/2 November. The main attacks on the centre at the Battle of Hareira and Sheria began on 6 November. Gaza was found to have been evacuated by its Ottoman defenders early on 7 November and Hareira was captured that morning. After strong resistance against the 60th (London) Division&#x27;s attacks against the Ottoman defenders at Sheria, supported by a light-horse charge on 7 November, the position was captured by infantry just before dusk, on 7 November.

The British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour contacted Baron Rothschild, a wealthy banker and head of the British branch of European Jewish causes, on 2 November, two days after the capture of Beersheba. In the Balfour Declaration, he proposed a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine, published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 9 November 1917. Also on 2 November, while congratulating Allenby for the victory at Beersheba, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, William Robertson, informed him that he was unlikely to receive reinforcements:
Henry Gullett&#x27;s claim that &quot;[f]rom then on to the end of the war the Turks never forgot Beersheba&quot; and that the German and Ottoman infantry, &quot;when galloped, as ... they frequently were, invariably shot wildly and surrendered early in the conflict,&quot; was disproved when solid Ottoman defence met the 11th and 12th light horse regiments&#x27; charge during fighting for Sheria on 7 November, and the yeomanry&#x27;s charge at Huj on 8 November 1917.

After Gaza was occupied on 7 November, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade (XXI Corps) rode through the ruins of Gaza to reach Beit Hanun at 13:00. The 157th Brigade (52nd Division) began the infantry pursuit along the Mediterranean shore, to reach Sheikh Hasan by 12:15. In the centre of the line, the Anzac Mounted Division found a gap on the eastern side of Sheria to begin their pursuit at daylight, on 7 November. After being held up at Sheria, the Australian Mounted Division and the 60th (London) Division advanced to capture Huj on 8 November. By that evening, all the Ottoman positions which had made up the Gaza-to-Beersheba line had been captured, and the defenders were in full retreat.

==Legacy==
===Australian identity===
The Battle of Beersheba is a significant event in Australian history. It has been called &quot;Australia&#x27;s first big achievement on the world stage&quot; and credited for additional travel by Australians to Israel. Historian Jonathan King has argued that &quot;the Battle of Beersheba should be the cornerstone of our Australia identity, replacing Gallipoli. Gallipoli was a British-led defeat. Beersheba was an Australian-led victory.&quot;

===Evangelical Christianity===
Some evangelical Christians have viewed the light-horsemen at the Battle of Beersheba as &quot;fulfilling a biblical prophecy by helping return Israel to the Jews&quot;.

===In Israel===
* In April 2008, Australia&#x27;s governor-general, Major General (ret) Michael Jeffery, and Israeli president, Shimon Peres, unveiled a monument to the light horse in Beersheba, Israel. It was made by Australian sculptor Peter Corlett with funding support from businessman Richard Pratt.
*In October 2017, the Beersheba ANZAC Memorial Centre was inaugurated in the presence of Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, The memorial centre was built within the grounds of the British war cemetery in Beersheba. The building resembles a horse head, commemorating the tens of thousands of horses that served and died throughout the war. It holds a small collection of war remnants dated back to the British conquest of Palestine.
*In September 2019, a life-size sculpture, &quot;The Aborigine and His Horse&quot;, was dedicated at Tzemach, commemorating Aborigine ANZAC members, dubbed the &quot;Queensland Black Watch&quot;, including cavalrymen who fought at Tzemach and Be&#x27;er Sheva. Descendants of those horsemen travelled from Australia to participate in the statue&#x27;s inauguration, &quot;another stage in the historic correction that Australian society is undergoing in their relations with the Aborigines.&quot;

== Works ==
&quot;Forty Thousand Horsemen&quot; and &quot;The Lighthorsemen&quot; are movies based on the events. 

An episode of &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Palestine 1917&quot; features the battle of Beersheba, later released as the direct-to-video film &quot;Daredevils of the Desert&quot;.

<text>Tracy Darrell Adkins (born January 13, 1962) is an American country music singer and actor. Adkins made his debut in 1996 with the album &quot;Dreamin&#x27; Out Loud&quot;, released on Capitol Records Nashville. Since then, he has released ten more studio albums and two Greatest Hits compilations. In addition, Adkins has charted more than 20 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country music charts, including the Number One hits &quot;(This Ain&#x27;t) No Thinkin&#x27; Thing&quot;, &quot;Ladies Love Country Boys&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss This&quot;, which peaked in 1997, 2007, and 2008, respectively.

&quot;I Left Something Turned on at Home&quot; went to No. 1 on Canada&#x27;s country chart. At least six of his studio albums have received gold or platinum certification in the United States; his highest-selling to date is 2005&#x27;s &quot;Songs About Me&quot;, which has been certified 2× Multi-Platinum for shipping two million copies. Adkins is widely known for his distinctive bass-baritone singing and speaking voice.

He has also made several appearances on television, including as a panelist on the game shows &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and &quot;Pyramid&quot;, as a 2008 finalist and as the 2013 winner on &quot;The All Star Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, as the voice for recurring character Elvin on &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, and the main role of Albie Roman on &quot;Monarch&quot;, as well as in television commercial voice-overs for KFC and Firestone.

Also, Adkins has written an autobiography titled &quot;A Personal Stand: Observations and Opinions from a Free-Thinking Roughneck&quot;, which was released in late 2007. He has appeared in numerous films, including &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot;, &quot;Moms&#x27; Night Out&quot;, and &quot;I Can Only Imagine&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Adkins was born in Sarepta, Louisiana, the son of Peggy Carraway and Aaron Doyle Adkins. His maternal uncle was the Christian musician James W. Carraway (1923–2008). His musical interest came at an early age when he was ten and his father bought him a guitar and hired someone to give him lessons.

At Sarepta High School, since defunct, Adkins joined a gospel music group called the New Commitments. He was also a member of the FFA. Later, Adkins attended Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. A walk-on offensive lineman on their football team, Adkins left the team after his freshman season due to a knee injury, without ever playing in a game. Adkins never graduated. After leaving college, he worked on an oil rig. He also played music in a band called Bayou. Adkins also worked as a pharmacy technician before pursuing a career in music. He lost the pinky finger on his left hand in an accident using a knife to open a bucket, and asked doctors to reattach the finger at an angle so that he could continue to play guitar. Adkins moved to play in honky-tonk bars for the next few years in the Ark-La-Tex area and eventually moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1992. In late-1994, Adkins met Rhonda Forlaw, who was an executive at Arista Records Nashville. Forlaw had numerous music industry friends come out to hear Adkins over the next few years. Scott Hendricks of Capitol Nashville signed him &quot;on the spot&quot; one night while Adkins was playing at Tillie and Lucy&#x27;s bar in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee.

==Music career==
===Early career===

Adkins&#x27; first single, which he wrote himself, &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in Texas&quot;, was released in 1996, reaching the Top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks charts. It was followed by the release of his debut album, &quot;Dreamin&#x27; Out Loud&quot;, later that year. The album produced several hit singles, including his first Top 5 single, &quot;Every Light in the House&quot;, his first Number One in &quot;(This Ain&#x27;t) No Thinkin&#x27; Thing&quot;, and another Top 5 hit in &quot;I Left Something Turned on at Home&quot;. The latter single was also a Number One hit in Canada. His second album, &quot;Big Time&quot;, produced a Top 5 in &quot;The Rest of Mine&quot;, but subsequent singles proved less successful. Adkins was named &quot;Top New Male Artist&quot; by the Academy of Country Music in 1997. In 1998, Adkins appeared on the PBS music program &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; (season 23). A change in management delayed the release of Adkins&#x27; third album, but the album (titled &quot;More...&quot;) was eventually released in late 1999. Although the album&#x27;s title track reached Top 10, &quot;More...&quot; failed to achieve gold status. Adkins&#x27; daughter, Mackenzie, was featured in the &quot;More&quot; video.

===2001–2004===
In 2001, Adkins was injured in a tractor accident and had to cancel touring temporarily. Shortly after the release of his &quot;Chrome&quot; album, he entered a 28-day alcohol rehabilitation program in Nashville. &quot;Chrome&quot; was his first album to reach the Top 5 on the country albums charts; its title track reached Top 10 in late 2002.

In 2003, Adkins released two albums—a Greatest Hits collection and &quot;Comin&#x27; on Strong&quot;. The same year, he was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry. He also made appearances as the center square on the game show Hollywood Squares, and did voice-overs in commercials for fast-food chain KFC. Only one single, &quot;Then They Do&quot;, was released from this Greatest Hits compilation. This album, which succeeded the Greatest Hits collection, produced two singles: the Top 5 single &quot;Hot Mama&quot; and &quot;Rough &amp; Ready&quot;, which peaked at No. 13.

Adkins and Travis Tritt played the roles of prison convicts in a February 2004 episode of the television series &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; (Greg &amp; Jimmy&#x27;s Criminals).

===2005–2007===
In March 2005, Adkins released his album entitled &quot;Songs About Me&quot;. The title track was released as its first single in December 2004. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Arlington&quot;, generated controversy over its content (a first-person account of a fictional soldier who was about to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery). It was followed by &quot;Honky Tonk Badonkadonk&quot;, which became a crossover hit, bringing Adkins into the Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for the first time.

2006 saw the release of Adkins&#x27; seventh studio album, &quot;Dangerous Man&quot;. &quot;Swing&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead-off single, peaked at No. 20, while the follow-up &quot;Ladies Love Country Boys&quot; became Adkins&#x27; second Number One single on the country charts and his first since &quot;(This Ain&#x27;t) No Thinkin&#x27; Thing&quot; in 1997. Adkins&#x27; daughter, Brianna, was featured in the &quot;Ladies Love Country Boys&quot; video. The album&#x27;s final release, &quot;I Wanna Feel Something&quot;, proved unsuccessful on the charts; as a result, Adkins announced that he would stop supporting the single.

In August 2007, Adkins released a single entitled &quot;I Got My Game On&quot;. Originally, the song was planned to be the lead-off to a new album, tentatively titled &quot;Game On&quot;; however, Adkins decided not to release a full album, and instead released his second Greatest Hits compilation, &quot;American Man: Greatest Hits Volume II&quot;, for which &quot;I Got My Game On&quot; served as the lead-off single. The album has also produced Adkins&#x27; fastest-climbing single to date in its second single, &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss This&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss This&quot; has also become his third Number One hit on the Hot Country Songs, as well as the most successful single to date on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (#12), Billboard Pop 100 (#19), and Hot Digital Songs charts (#8).

Adkins released his first book, entitled &quot;A Personal Stand: Observations and Opinions from a Free-Thinking Roughneck&quot;.

===2008–2009===

In 2008, Adkins released the single &quot;Muddy Water,&quot; the lead single from &quot;X&quot;, which was released on November 25. The video for &quot;Muddy Water&quot; has an appearance by fellow &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; competitor Stephen Baldwin as a man being baptized in a muddy river, and later approaching Adkins as a friend. It reached the Top 30 on the country charts, peaking at number 22. &quot;Marry for Money&quot; and &quot;All I Ask For Anymore&quot; were released as the album&#x27;s second and third singles, and both peaked at No. 14 on the country charts.

In November 2008, Adkins made an appearance at the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. He rode with his family on the &quot;Jimmy Dean&quot; float and performed his famous song &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss This&quot;. In 2009, Adkins appeared in local Kansas City commercials to advertise season tickets and the 50th season of the National Football League&#x27;s Kansas City Chiefs.

Adkins recorded a duet with country legend Ronnie Milsap called &quot;My First Ride&quot; to benefit fire-fighters and police officers in the U.S. and Canada. Then, after the song&#x27;s release, the label said &#x27;no&#x27; to radio stations playing it with no explanation given. Milsap led a protest at Capitol Records to &quot;Free Trace&quot; and allow the song to be played.

In November 2009, Adkins embarked on the Shine All Night Tour, a co-headline venture with fellow country artist Martina McBride. Also, in 2009, he recorded a duet with Blake Shelton titled &quot;Hillbilly Bone&quot;, which was released as the lead-off single from Shelton&#x27;s upcoming sixth album. On October 18, 2009, Adkins made an appearance on &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; to help Ty Pennington and his design team build a new home for the Marshall family.

===2010–2014: Move to Show Dog-Universal Music===

Adkins was a January–March 2008 contestant on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. Each celebrity contestant was playing for donations to their selected charity. Adkins played for the Food Allergy &amp; Anaphylaxis Network. Adkins chose the charity because his daughter suffers from life-threatening reactions to peanuts, milk, and eggs.

He was the project manager for his team, Plan B, in the first task, which was to sell meatballs and won $670,072, a Celebrity Apprentice record for a first task, for his charity The American Red Cross. Together with Vegas illusionist Penn Jillette, Adkins made it to the finals again (becoming the first and only person in the history of the show to do so), where Adkins won and became The All-Star Celebrity Apprentice. He also broke the record for the highest amount of money raised for his charity by any one person in the history of the show, with $1,524,072 raised for the American Red Cross.

<text>The Boyle Lectures are named after Robert Boyle, a prominent natural philosopher of the 17th century and son of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork. Under the terms of his Will, Robert Boyle endowed a series of lectures or sermons (originally eight each year) which were to consider the relationship between Christianity and the new natural philosophy (today&#x27;s &#x27;science&#x27;) then emerging in European society. Since 2004, this prestigious Lectures series has been organized, with the assistance of Board of the Boyle Lectures, by the International Society for Science and Religion (ISSR) and has been held at one of its original locations, the Wren church of St Mary-le-Bow on Cheapside in the City of London.

== History ==

=== Early lectures ===
The first such lecture was given in 1692 by Richard Bentley, to whom Isaac Newton had written:
The early lecturers were specifically charged to prove the truth of the Christian religion against Jews, Muslims and non-believers, without considering any controversies or differences that might exist between different Christian groups.

A clergyman was to be appointed to the lectureship for a term of no more than three years by Thomas Tenison (later Archbishop of Canterbury) and three other nominated trustees. Boyle had assigned the rent from his house in Crooked Lane to support the lectures but the income from that source soon disappeared. Archbishop Tenison then arranged that the rental income from a farm in the parish of Brill in Buckinghamshire was to be paid at the rate of £12.10.00 per quarter to the lecturer.

=== Revival ===
The Boyle Lectures were revived in 2004 at the famous Wren church of St Mary-le-Bow in the City of London by Dr Michael Byrne, a Fellow of Birkbeck College London. Financial support for the lectures has been provided by a number of patrons, principally the Worshipful Company of Grocers and the Worshipful Company of Mercers in the city. A book to mark the 10th anniversary of the revived series was edited by Russell Re Manning and Michael Byrne and published by SCM Press in 2013 as &#x27;Science and Religion in the Twenty-First Century: The Boyle Lectures 2004-2013&#x27;.

Having convened the first 15 lectures in the new series, Michael Byrne stepped down as Convenor in 2018. Management of the lecture then passed to the International Society for Science and Religion (ISSR) in cooperation with the Boyle Lectures Board of Trustees. Members of the board include John Boyle, 15th Earl of Cork; the Hon. Robert Boyle; Julian Tregoning, Past Master of the Grocers&#x27; Company; Xenia Dennan, Past Master of the Mercers Company; the Revd George R. Bush, Rector of St Mary-le-Bow; Emeritus Professor John Hedley Brooke; Dr Russell Re Manning; Professor Fraser Watts; and the Revd Michael Reiss, former President of the ISSR.

<text>Marcia Ball (born March 20, 1949) is an American blues singer and pianist raised in Vinton, Louisiana.

Ball was described in &quot;USA Today&quot; as &quot;a sensation, saucy singer and superb pianist... where Texas stomp-rock and Louisiana blues-swamp meet.&quot; The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; described her music as &quot;an irresistible celebratory blend of rollicking, two-fisted New Orleans piano, Louisiana swamp rock and smoldering Texas blues from a contemporary storyteller.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Ball was born in Orange, Texas, into a musical family. Her grandmother and aunt both played piano music of their time and Ball started piano lessons when she started school, and showed an early interest in New Orleans style piano playing, as exemplified by Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, and James Booker. She has named Irma Thomas, the New Orleans vocalist, as her chief vocal inspiration. Ball studied English at Louisiana State University in the 1960s while playing in a band called Gum. In 1970, at age 21, she started a progressive country band called Freda and the Firedogs in Austin, Texas, and began her solo career in 1974.

== Career ==
She began her recording career as a solo artist with Rounder Records in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 2001, she joined the Chicago-based Alligator Records. Her Rounder album, &quot;Sing It!&quot;, which featured vocalists Irma Thomas and Tracy Nelson, released in January 1998 was nominated for a Grammy Award and a Blues Music Award for &quot;Best Contemporary Blues Album.&quot; Ball received the 1998 Blues Music Award for &quot;Contemporary Female Vocalist of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Blues Instrumentalist-Keyboards.&quot;

She was awarded &quot;Contemporary Blues Album of the Year&quot; for her albums &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; (2002) and &quot;So Many Rivers&quot; (2004). The same year she also won &quot;Contemporary Blues Artist of the Year-Female.&quot; She won the &quot;Best Blues Instrumentalist-Keyboards&quot; again in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009. The BMA for Keyboards has since been renamed the Pinetop Perkins Piano Player Award and Ball has won it in 2012 and 2015. Her 2003 Alligator release, &quot;So Many Rivers&quot;, was nominated for a Grammy as were &quot;Live! Down The Road&quot; (2005) and &quot;Peace, Love &amp; BBQ&quot; (2008). She was inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame in 2018.

Ball has continued to work with Irma Thomas. In 2006, the two contributed a duet (&quot;Look Up&quot;) on the New Orleans Social Club release, &quot;Sing Me Back Home&quot; (Burgundy Records/Honey Darling Records). In 2007, the two contributed another duet (&quot;I Can&#x27;t Get New Orleans Off My Mind&quot;) to &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot; (Vanguard Records). She continues to play at nightclubs, particularly in Austin and New Orleans, and performs at music festivals in North America and overseas.

In May 2015, Ball won the &#x27;Pinetop Perkins Piano Player&#x27; award at the Blues Music Awards ceremony. She won the same award in 2019.

On October 25, 2018, Ball was inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame, where she first appeared during their inaugural season in 1976.

<doc id="487973" wikidata="Q5450779" url="?curid=487973" title="III Corps (Continuation War)">
<text>The III Corps () was a corps of the Finnish Army during the Continuation War, where Finland fought alongside Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union. Formed from the peacetime V Corps and subordinated to the German Army High Command Norway, III Corps fought initially in northern Finland on the flank of the German XXXVI Corps, participating in the Finno-German Operation Arctic Fox. In February 1944, it was moved to the Karelian Isthmus just prior to the launch of the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive. Following the Moscow Armistice, III Corps took overall command of the Finnish forces participating in the Lapland War, the removal of German forces from northern Finland.

==Mobilization and pre-war plans==
While the exact details of the Finno-German planning preceding the Continuation War remain unclear, it is known that on 25 May 1941 Finnish officers participated in negotiations with the Germans in Salzburg regarding plans for a future war with the Soviet Union. According to the plans proposed by the Germans, the Finns would be in charge of operations in the southeast of Finland and east of Lake Ladoga, with overall command of both Finnish and German troops in the area falling under the Finnish commander-in-chief, Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim. In turn, the Finns would subordinate the peacetime V Corps to the headquarters of the German Army of Norway. During follow-up negotiations in Berlin on 26 May, the Finnish general Erik Heinrichs stated that the Army of Norway could expect a Finnish contribution of two divisions, but emphasized that the Finnish forces concentrated in the Salla region would be needed in the south as soon as possible. Forward elements of the German troops began arriving in Finland on 1 June, and further talks followed in Helsinki over the period 3 to 6 June. The participants agreed that the southern border of the Army of Norway&#x27;s area of operations would be on the line Oulu–Oulujärvi–Lentiira–Belomorsk.

The Finnish mobilization began on 10 June 1941 under the pretext of &quot;additional exercises&quot; (). The Military Districts of Perä-Pohjola and Pohjois-Pohjanmaa called up the 3rd and 6th Divisions, which concentrated in the area between Kajaani and Savukoski under the command of the peacetime V Corps. As arranged in the previous month&#x27;s discussions, the corps, led by Major General Hjalmar Siilasvuo, was formally subordinated to the headquarters of the German Army of Norway on 15 June. On 18 June, the corps was re-designated as III Corps.

==In Northern Finland, 1941–1944==


Before the start of the hostilities, the 6th Division was transferred from the III Corps to the German XXXVI Corps. The German plans called for the III Corps, now consisting only of the 3rd Division, to cover the right (southern) flank of the Army of Norway. It was to advance first to the Ukhta–Kestenga line and this movement was to be followed by a continued advance to the Murmansk railroad and Kem. III Corps would be to the south of the German XXXVI Corps, with the unit areas of responsibility defined by the line Kuusamo–Oulanka–Chupa. III Corps thus secured the southern flank of Operation Silver Fox, targeting the capture of Murmansk. Siilasvuo divided the remaining forces of the III Corps into two formations. Group F, consisting of the main body of the 3rd Division, attacked east from Suomussalmi; its initial objective was Voknavolok, from where it was expected to continue towards Ukhta. Group J, formed around one regiment from the 3rd Division, attacked towards , with a follow-on objective of Kestenga. III Corps was ordered to launch its attack on 1 July, at 02:30.

It soon become apparent that III Corps was the only corps-level unit of the Army of Norway making significant progress, and the corps was reinforced with parts of SS Division Nord on 21 July. On 30 July, Adolf Hitler approved a modification to the Germans plans: operations of the two German corps of the Army of Norway were largely halted, and German reinforcements were allocated to support the attack of the III Corps. The main objective of the III Corps was to be the Murmansk railroad in the area of Loukhi. By end of July, SS Division Nord had been subordinated to III Corps in totality. As Siilasvuo did not trust the German officers to lead Finnish forces following their failures in the Salla region, the bulk of the combat strength of SS Division Nord was subordinated to Group J, the Finnish force consisting of a single regiment while the staff of the Division was subordinated into the III Corps HQ. This resulted in tension between the various commanders, as the officers of SS Division Nord viewed the subordination as a humiliation.

By 2 August, Group F had reached the Soviet defensive lines north of Ukhta, but failed to take the town due to strong resistance by the Soviet 54th Division. Renewed attempts in September fared no better. Group J had taken up positions east of Kestenga after being pushed back by the Soviet 88th Division which had recently arrived in the area. General Siilasvuo reported to &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Nikolaus von Falkenhorst that III Corps was unable to reach Loukhi, with both sides settling for stationary warfare in the sector. On 14 August, Group J was renamed Division J and Group F as 3rd Division. On the same date, Hitler ordered the attack on Ukhta to be halted, and for Division J, including SS-Division Nord, to go on the defensive. Concurrently with these changes, SS Division Nord was de-subordinated from Division J and was given its own sector alongside Division J&#x27;s as part of the III Corps&#x27;s northern group.

By 6 October the situation at the front had improved to a point where von Falkenhorst and Siilasvuo discussed continuing the III Corps&#x27;s advance towards Loukhi. Due to Hitler&#x27;s August order, the plan was phrased as III Corp improving its positions. To this end, on 16 October, von Falkenhorst approved a plan to capture &quot;a crossing of a railway and a highway east of Kestenga&quot;, indicating the real purpose of the operation was to cut the Murmansk railroad. The Finnish high command was informed about the operation on 25 October, but nobody informed the German high command, Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW). The operation began on 30 October, with III Corps encircling a Soviet regiment in the first two days. On 9 October, the Army of Norway reported to OKW that two regiments of the Soviet 88th Rifle Division had been virtually destroyed, but Finnish intelligence indicated that Soviets were reinforcing the area with the 186th Rifle Division from Murmansk.

On 5 November, Siilasvuo was informed by the Finnish high command that the attack should be halted for political reasons, and that no additional Finnish reinforcements would be forthcoming despite Siilasvuo&#x27;s wishes. The United States of America had given the Finnish government a note demanding the attack be stopped. This had caused Finnish President Risto Ryti to express his concern over the operation to Mannerheim. By 11 November, Siilasvuo was actively slowing down the attack by ordering construction of further field fortifications. On the same date, the headquarters of the German Army of Norway received a message from OKW, demanding an explanation for the III Corps&#x27;s attack. The message also reiterated a previous order for the whole Army of Norway sector to go to a defensive posture. On 17 November, Siilasvuo gave a written order to halt the attack. By December, the fighting in the area had calmed down.

In early 1942, the German forces in northern Finland and Norway were reorganized with the creation of the German Lapland Army (soon renamed the 20th Mountain Army) which took over Army of Norway&#x27;s responsibilities in northern Finland. As part of this reorganization, III Corps was transferred to the Lapland Army. On 4 July, III Corps was formally transferred back to Finnish command, where it was directly subordinated to the Finnish commander-in-chief Mannerheim, with the German XVIII Corps taking responsibility for the Kestenga area the previous day. The area of Ukhta remained a Finnish responsibility until 22 March 1944, when it was handed to the 20th Mountain Army.

==Karelian Isthmus, 1944==


In March 1942, Finnish defenses had been reorganized under three large formations named Kannas Group, Maaselkä Group and Aunus Group. After the end of the siege of Leningrad in January 1944, the Finnish high command prepared for a Soviet offensive. As part of these preparations, the Kannas Group, responsible for the Karelian Isthmus (), was split into two corps-level formations on 4 March. The western side of the isthmus became the responsibility of the IV Corps, with the eastern side of the isthmus being handed to the III Corps, the headquarters of which was moved to the area from northern Finland. Following this reorganization, on 6 July, III Corps consisted of the 15th Division, the 19th Brigade and some assets from the 18th Division that mostly acted as part of the commander-in-chief&#x27;s reserve. The 3rd Division, previously part of the III Corps and recently freed from its frontal duties in the Ukhta area, was subordinated directly to the commander-in-chief as reserve.

On 9 June 1944, the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive started with a preparatory attack against the sector of the IV Corps. The main thrust of the offensive, on the Karelian Isthmus, hit the IV Corps sector on 10 June and quickly breached the Finnish main defensive line. By 11 June, IV Corps had been pushed sufficiently far back that the flank of III Corps was endangered. Even after IV Corps had reached the secondary VT-line on 12 June, III Corps was still holding to its part of the original main defensive line. On 13 June, to protect the flank of the corps, the 18th Division was released from the reserve and subordinated to III Corps. Concurrently, preparations were started for a future retreat to the VT-line. By 14 June, the situation of the 15th Division was becoming increasingly untenable, and III Corps was given permission to retreat to the VT-line. The retreat began on the night of 14–15 June, and the bulk of III Corps had reached the secondary defensive line by the end of June 15, with the exception of some forces on the left-most flank on the shore of Lake Ladoga.

The situation on the western Karelian Isthmus continued to deteriorate, and on 16 June Mannerheim ordered the 18th Division to be moved to the Vyborg region to act as his reserve as soon as possible. Given the rapid Soviet advance to the west, the III Corps continued to be in danger of being cut off. In the following days, the corps conducted a series of delaying actions, eventually taking defensive positions along Vuoksi, on the VKT-line. By 20 June, III Corps had created a defensive line consisting of two divisions and a brigade. The front stabilized along the Vuoksi for the rest of the war, and Soviet forces failed to break the VKT-line on the III Corps sector despite several attempts.

==After the Continuation War==


A ceasefire was agreed in September 1944 between the Soviet Union and Finland, which led to the Moscow Armistice. One of the terms of the armistice required Finland to ensure the removal of any German forces remaining in Finland. In practice, this meant that unless the German 20th Mountain Army Corps voluntarily retreated from Finland by mid-September, Finnish forces would have to evict them by force. Initially, Germans fell back towards Norway in unofficial cooperation with the Finnish forces. However, following the failure of Operation Tanne Ost, where the German&#x27;s attempted capture Gogland from Finnish defenders on 14–15 September, as well as a general cessation of any voluntary movement towards Norway, Finno-German cooperation completely broke down. 

During the resulting Lapland War, III Corps was moved to northern Finland where it took overall command of all the Finnish forces participating in the fighting against the Germans. The resulting formation consisted of the 3rd, 6th, 11th, 15th divisions, the Armored Division and two brigades. Over the next months, the III Corps slowly pushed the Germans out of Lapland. 

As the Finnish Army completed its demobilization by early December, as mandated by the Moscow Armistice, the forces under III Corps were reduced from a peak strength of 75,000 to approximately 12,000 men. On 5 December the corps was re-designated 1st Division, which remained under Siilasvuo&#x27;s command. As the veterans of the Continuation War were demobilized and replaced by fresh conscripts, this latter part of the Lapland War became known in Finland as the &quot;Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot;. The final stages of the war saw the Germans only occupy a minor area of land in the Karesuvanto region, and the Finnish forces in the area were eventually reduced to a task force consisting of 700 men. The final German forces left Finland on 27 April 1945, signaling the end to the Lapland War.

<doc id="487974" wikidata="Q57199" url="?curid=487974" title="Joachim Peiper">
<text>Joachim Peiper (30 January 1915 – 14 July 1976) was a German &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) officer, convicted war criminal and car salesman. During the Second World War in Europe, Peiper served as personal adjutant to Heinrich Himmler, leader of the SS, and as a tank commander in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. German historian Jens Westemeier writes that Peiper personified Nazi ideology, as a purportedly ruthless glory-hound commander who was indifferent to the combat casualties of Battle Group Peiper, and who tolerated, expected, and indeed encouraged war crimes by his &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers.

As adjutant to Himmler, Peiper witnessed the SS implement the Holocaust with ethnic cleansing and genocide of Jews in Eastern Europe; facts that he obfuscated and denied in the post-War period. As a tank commander, Peiper served in the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) in the Eastern Front and in the Western Front, first as a battalion commander and then as a regimental commander. Peiper fought in the Third Battle of Kharkov and in the Battle of the Bulge, from which battles his eponymous battle group – &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; – became notorious for committing war crimes against civilians and PoWs.

Upon release from prison, Peiper worked for the Porsche and Volkswagen automobile companies and later moved to France, where he worked as a freelance translator. Throughout his post-war life, Peiper was very active in the social network of ex-SS men centred upon the right-wing organisation HIAG (Mutual Aid Association of Former Members of the Waffen-SS). In 1976, Peiper died from asphyxiation after communist arsonists discovered his identity and set his house on fire.

== Early life ==
Joachim Peiper was born on 30 January 1915 in Wilmersdorf, a district of Berlin, part of the German Empire. He was the third son of a middle-class family from German Silesia.

His father, Woldemar Peiper, had served as an officer in the Imperial German Army and fought in the 1904 campaign in German South West Africa.
He later contracted malaria and received a severe wound
which demobilised him from active duty in German Africa. In 1907 Woldemar resumed active duty in the Prussian army.
He rejoined the colours in the First World War
and was for a time deployed to Ottoman Turkey,
where he suffered chronic cardiac problems consequent to the previous malarial infection. Poor health then demobilised Woldemar from active duty in Asia Minor.

During the European interwar period, Woldemar joined a company of mercenary soldiers within the paramilitary &quot;Freikorps&quot; and actively participated in suppressing the Polish Silesian Uprisings (August 1919–July 1921) which aimed to annex German Silesia to the Second Polish Republic. In the Weimar Germany of the 1920s, the antisemitic canards of Nazi ideology – the Stab-in-the-back myth, the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, &quot;The International Jew&quot;, &quot;et cetera&quot; – had much appeal to the political conservatives and to the political reactionaries such as the &quot;Freikorps&quot; mercenary soldier Woldemar Peiper who were angry that Imperial Germany had lost the Great War.

Two of Woldemar&#x27;s sons, Horst and Joachim, followed the same life path of nationalist ideology and military service to Germany. In 1926, the eleven-year-old Joachim followed his middle brother, fourteen-year-old Horst Peiper, to become a boy scout; eventually, Joachim became interested in becoming a military officer.

Horst joined the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) and served in the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; as a guard in a Nazi concentration camp. Transferred to active duty as a &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldier, Horst fought in the Battle of France (1940) as part of the 3rd SS Panzer Division, and died in Poland in June 1941 in a never-fully-explained accident; rumour said that his fellow SS-men drove Horst to commit suicide because of his homosexuality.

Peiper&#x27;s eldest brother, Hans-Hasso (b. 1910) had a mental illness, and his suicide attempt resulted in cerebral damage that reduced him to a persistent vegetative state. Interned to a hospital in 1931, Hans died of tuberculosis in 1942.

==Pre-War Germany==
===SS career===
Joachim Peiper was eighteen years old when he joined the Hitler Youth in the company of Horst, his middle brother. In October 1933, Peiper volunteered for the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) and joined the Cavalry SS, where his first superior officer was Gustav Lombard, a zealous Nazi, and later a regimental commander in the SS Cavalry Brigade, who were notoriously efficient at the mass murder of Jews in occupied Soviet Union, notably in punitive operations such as the Pripyat Marshes massacres (July–August 1941) in Byelorussia.

On 23 January 1934, he was promoted to SS-&quot;Mann&quot; (SS Identity Card Nr. 132.496), which made Peiper an &quot;SS Man&quot; before the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; was independent of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) within the Nazi Party. Later that year, Peiper was promoted to SS-&quot;Sturmmann&quot; at the 1934 Nuremberg Rally, where his reputation attracted the notice of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler, for whom Peiper personified Aryanism, the master-race concept promoted by the Nazism taught at the SS officer school. Despite not being as tall, blond, and muscular as the Nordic recruits to the SS, Peiper compensated by being a handsome, personable, and self-confident SS officer.

The SS formally employed Peiper in January 1935, and later sent him to a military leadership course. As an SS leadership student Peiper received favourable and approving reviews from the SS instructors, yet received only conditional approval from the military psychologists, who noted Peiper&#x27;s egocentricity, negative attitude, and continual attempts to impress them with his personal connection to &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Himmler. The military psychologists concluded that Peiper might become either a &quot;difficult subordinate&quot; or an &quot;arrogant superior&quot; in the course of his career in the SS.

In the April 1935 – March 1936 period, Peiper trained as a military officer in the SS-Junker School, from which institution the director, Paul Hausser, graduated ideologically complicit Nazi leaders for the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. Besides military fieldcraft, the SS-Junker School taught the Nazi worldview that centred upon anti-Semitism.

The Nazi Party issued Peiper his NSDAP Identity Card Nr. 5.508.134 on 1 March 1938, two years after he became an SS man. In the post-War period, Peiper continually denied having been a member of the Nazi Party, because that fact contradicted his self-promoted image of a common man who was &quot;merely a soldier&quot; in the Second World War.

===Himmler&#x27;s Adjutant===
In June 1938, Peiper became an adjutant to &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Himmler, which tour of duty Himmler considered necessary administrative training for a promotable SS leader. In that time, the officers working within the Personal Staff Reichsführer-SS were under the command of SS functionary Karl Wolff. As a staff officer, Peiper worked in the anteroom of the SS Main Office in Berlin and became a favourite adjutant of Himmler. Peiper returned the admiration and by 1939, Peiper always was the adjutant of the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; at every official function.

==Invasion of Poland, 1939==

On 1 September 1939, Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland started the Second World War in Europe. Adjutant Peiper travelled in the personal train of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Himmler. Peiper occasionally was the liaison officer to Hitler, when the &quot;Führer&quot; travelled by train with Erwin Rommel, and when the &quot;Führer&quot; met with &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; generals near the front lines of the Eastern Front.

On 20 September, in the northern Polish city of Bydgoszcz, Himmler and Peiper witnessed the public executions of twenty Polish social leaders who might lead partisan resistance to Nazi occupation. That demonstration of the mechanics of the Holocaust – of ethnic cleansing – was realised by the paramilitary &quot;Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz&quot; an ethnic-German, self-defence militia commanded by Ludolf von Alvensleben, the local SS and Police leader. In later conversation with the explorer Ernst Schäfer, Peiper rationalised the actions of the SS to hunt and kill the Polish intelligentsia by ascribing sole command responsibility to Hitler and his superior orders to Himmler.

As a participant in the Nazi conquest of Poland for German &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, Peiper witnessed the administrative refinement of SS policies for more effective methods of killing during ethnic cleansing, designed to depopulate Polish lands for German colonists. On 13 December 1939, in west-central Poland, at the village of Owińska, near Poznań, Himmler and Peiper witnessed the &quot;Aktion T4&quot; poison-gas mass killing of mentally ill patients in a psychiatric hospital. In post-war interrogations by U.S. Army JAG and military intelligence interrogators, Peiper was factual and emotionally detached in describing his eye-witness experience of mass murder:

The [gassing] action was done before a circle of invited guests ... The insane were led into a prepared casemate, the door of which had a Plexiglas window. After the door was closed, one could see how, in the beginning, the insane still laughed and talked to each other. But, soon they sat down on the straw, obviously under the influence of the gas ... Very soon, they no longer moved. 

Throughout 1940, Himmler and Peiper made an inspection tour of the concentration camps of Nazi Germany, including the Neuengamme concentration camp in the north, and the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in the north-east of the country. In Occupied Poland, Himmler met with Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger, the Higher SS and Police Leader, and his subordinate, Odilo Globocnik, the SS bureaucrat responsible for deporting the Jews from the cities of Warsaw and Lublin and from the Polish territories already annexed as &quot;Lebensraum&quot; for Germany.

In April 1940, Himmler and Peiper continued their camp inspection tour at the Buchenwald concentration camp and the Flossenbürg concentration camp. The SS and Police Leader Wilhelm Rediess and the SS official Otto Rasch strove to develop quicker methods for killing civilians in order to depopulate Poland for German colonisation. In May 1940, Globocnik demonstrated for Himmler and Peiper the efficacy of the &quot;Aktion T4&quot; programme for the involuntary euthanasia of disabled and crippled people and also discussed Globocnik&#x27;s work in the Lublin Reservation programme for the control and confinement of the Jewish populations of the Greater Germanic Reich.

==Battle of France, 1940==
In May 1940, Himmler and Peiper followed the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; throughout the Battle of France. On 18 May, Peiper became a platoon leader in a unit of the LSSAH motorised regiment. For audacious soldiering in his platoon&#x27;s capture of a French artillery battery atop the hills of Wattenberg, south of Valenciennes, Peiper was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd class, and promoted to SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; (captain). On 19 June 1940, Peiper was awarded the Iron Cross 1st class for audacious soldiering. As a further reward and remuneration, Peiper took back to Germany a French sports car for his personal use; Himmler ordered the car be included in the motor-pool inventory of his personal staff. On 21 June 1940, Peiper returned to his role of personal adjutant to Himmler.

On 7 September 1940, Himmler thanked the commanders of the LSSAH motorised regiment: &quot;We had to have the toughness – this should be said and soon forgotten – to shoot thousands of leading Poles&quot;, and stressed the psychological problems suffered by &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers when they are &quot;carrying out executions&quot;, &quot;hauling away people&quot;, and &quot;evicting crying and hysterical women&quot; in order to clear the lands of Poland for German colonisation. After an official visit to Francoist Spain to meet Generalíssimo Francisco Franco in October 1940, Peiper was promoted to First Adjutant on 1 November 1940.

==Operation Barbarossa, 1941==
In February 1941, &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Himmler informed adjutant Peiper about the upcoming Operation Barbarossa (22 June – 5 December 1941), for the invasion, conquest, and German colonisation of the U.S.S.R: Red Army. Moreover, Himmler and his staff travelled to occupied Poland, occupied Norway, Nazi Austria, and occupied Greece to see the progress of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; operations there, including the depopulation of Poland for German colonisation.

About his visit to the Łódź ghetto, Peiper wrote that &quot;it was a macabre image: we saw how the Jewish Ghetto police, who wore hats without rims, and were armed with wooden clubs, inconsiderately made room for us.&quot; The episode in the Łódź ghetto indicates Peiper&#x27;s awareness of the criminality of the Nazi occupations, yet the anecdotes he wrote – about the Jewish Ghetto Police abusing the Jews – were meant to lessen the degree of his complicity in the war crimes of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; and of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.

In the 11–15 June 1941 period, adjutant Peiper participated in the SS conference wherein Himmler presented plans for killing of 30 million Slavs in eastern Europe, especially Russia; present were Kurt Wolff; Kurt Daluege (head of the Order Police), Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski (SS and Police Leader in Byelorussia); and Reinhard Heydrich (head of the Reich Security Main Office). When Nazi Germany invaded the U.S.S.R., on 22 June 1941, Himmler used a headquarters-train to tour the conquered Russian lands; Himmler and Peiper inspected the work of the &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; units who were depopulating the conquered lands. In Augustów, Poland, the &quot;Einsatzkommando Tilsit&quot; killed approximately 200 people; and in Grodno, Byelorussia, before Himmler and Peiper, Heydrich berated the leader of the local death squad for having shot only 96 Jews in a day. 

In July 1941, Himmler and Peiper were in Białystok to witness the progress of the depopulation of that city and of Poland by the Order Police battalions, and met with Bach-Zalewski to discuss the deployment of units of the &quot;Kommandostab Reichsführer-SS&quot; (&quot;Command Staff Reichsführer-SS&quot;), which comprised 25,000 &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers tasked to execute racial and ideological war against the peoples of Russia. The &quot;Kommandostab&quot; units were under the authority of the local Higher SS and Police Leaders, who identified the local populations of Jews and &quot;undesirables&quot; to be killed. 

As the first and second adjutants, Peiper and Werner Grothmann were aware of and handled all of Himmler&#x27;s orders and communications. Peiper delivered the &quot;Kommandostab&quot;&#x27;s daily body-count reports to Himmler. The 30 July 1941 report from Gustav Lombard&#x27;s SS cavalry indicated that they had shot 800 Jews; the 11 August 1941 report from Lombard indicated that they had shot 6,526 &quot;looters&quot; (Jews). Peiper likewise delivered to Himmler the daily &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; murder statistics that compared the numbers of people killed against the pre-war projections of the timetable for depopulating the U.S.S.R.

Peiper&#x27;s adjutancy to Himmler ended in the summer of 1941, and Peiper was reassigned to the LSSAH motorised regiment in October 1941. Peiper rejoined the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) whilst they fought in the Eastern Front, in the vicinity of the Black Sea. As the replacement for an injured company commander, Peiper assumed command of the 11th Company and fought the Red Army at Mariupol and Rostov-on-Don. Noted for his fighting spirit and aggressive leadership in battle, tank commander Peiper&#x27;s victories came at the cost of many German tanks and casualties among &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; infantry.

The division was followed by &quot;Einsatzgruppe D&quot;, who were responsible for killing the local Jews, other civilians, Commissars, Red Army soldiers, and partisans. To facilitate the depopulation of the lands of Russia, SS-General Sepp Dietrich, commander of the LSSAH, volunteered his &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; infantry to assist the &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; in the massacre of 1,800 people at the Gully of Petrushino. In May 1942, the LSSAH was sent to Vichy France for rest, recuperation, and refitting, and were subsequently reorganized into a &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; division. Peiper was promoted to commander of the 3rd Battalion.

===Blowtorch Battalion===
Peiper&#x27;s battalion left France in January 1943 for the Eastern Front, where the Wehrmacht had begun to lose the initiative, especially in the Battle of Stalingrad. During the Third Battle of Kharkov, the battalion became known for an audacious rescue of the encircled 320th Infantry Division. In a letter home, Peiper described hand-to-hand fighting with a Soviet ski battalion in an effort to lead the division, including its sick and wounded, to safety.

The rescue culminated in a fierce battle with the Soviet forces at the village of Krasnaya Polyana. Upon entering the village, Peiper&#x27;s troops made a terrible discovery. All the men in his small rearguard medical detachment who had been left there had been killed and then mutilated. An SS sergeant in Peiper&#x27;s ration supply company later stated that Peiper responded in kind: &quot;In the village, the two petrol trucks were burnt and 25 Germans killed by partisans and Soviet soldiers. As revenge, Peiper ordered the burning down of the whole village and the shooting of its inhabitants&quot;. (The testimony was obtained in November 1944 by the Western Allies.)

On 6 May 1943, Peiper was awarded the German Cross in Gold for his achievements in February 1943 around Kharkov, where his unit gained the nickname the &quot;Blowtorch Battalion&quot;. Reportedly, the nickname derived from the torching and slaughter of two Soviet villages where their inhabitants were either shot or burned.

Ukrainian sources, including surviving witness Ivan Kiselev, who was 14 at the time of the massacre, described the killings at the villages of Yefremovka and Semyonovka on 17 February 1943. On 12 February troops of the LSSAH occupied the two villages, where retreating Soviet forces had wounded two SS officers. In retaliation, five days later, LSSAH troops killed 872 men, women and children. Some 240 of these were burned alive in the church of Yefremovka.

In August 1944, when an SS commander, formerly of LSSAH, was captured south of Falaise in France and interrogated by the Allies, he stated that Peiper was &quot;particularly eager to execute the order to burn villages&quot;. Peiper wrote to Potthast in March 1943: &quot;Our reputation precedes us as a wave of terror and is one of our best weapons. Even old Genghis Khan would gladly have hired us as assistants.&quot;

On 9 March 1943, Peiper was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross, the most prestigious military decoration of the Third Reich, for which &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Himmler congratulated him in a live radio broadcast: &quot;Heartfelt congratulations for the Knight&#x27;s Cross, my dear Jochen! I am proud of you!&quot; In that stage of the Second World War, Nazi propaganda portrayed tank commander Peiper as an exemplary military leader. The official SS newspaper, &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; (The Black Corps) reported that Peiper&#x27;s actions in Kharkov demonstrated that he is a &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; tank commander who always is &quot;the master of the situation, in all its phases&quot;, that Peiper&#x27;s &quot;quick decision-making&quot; assured victory in the field through his &quot;bold and unorthodox orders&quot; and that he is &quot;a born leader, one filled with the highest sense of responsibility for the life of every one of his men, but who [was] also able to be hard, if necessary&quot; to complete the mission.

In the post-War period, such hyperbolic descriptions of the tactical prowess of the tank commander Peiper glamourised the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; man into a war hero of Germany. In the SS hierarchy, Peiper was an SS man and military officer who received, obeyed, and executed orders with minimal discussion, and expected that his soldiers receive, obey, and execute his orders without question.

In July 1943, the LSSAH tank division participated in Operation Citadel in the area of Kursk, in which &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; fought well against the Red Army. After Operation Citadel failed, the LSSAH tank division was redeployed from the Eastern Front in Russia to the north of Fascist Italy.

==Italy, 1943==
In August 1943, &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; was stationed in the Italian city of Cuneo, six kilometres north of the village of Boves in the commune of Boves. Fascist Italy ceased being a belligerent power of the Rome-Berlin Axis on 3 September 1943 with the signing of the Armistice of Cassibile between the Kingdom of Italy and the Allied Powers. Consequently, Nazi Germany responded on 8 September with Operation Achse, wherein &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; forces, including the LSSAH, invaded and occupied the north of Italy, in order to forcibly disarm the Italian army &quot;in situ&quot;.

===Massacre at Boves===
On 19 September 1943, in a firefight with the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; occupiers, partisan guerrillas of the Italian Resistance Movement killed one soldier and captured two others in the vicinity of Boves, in the Piedmont region of north-west Italy. In a later firefight with the partisans, a &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; infantry company failed to rescue their comrades from the partisans. After this, the armoured units of &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; assumed strategic control of the streets and the roads into and out of the village of Boves, and Peiper then threatened to destroy the village if the partisans did not release their &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; prisoners.

In an effort to avoid the Nazis&#x27; destruction of the Boves village, the local spokesmen of the Boves commune, the parish priest Giuseppe Bernardi and the businessman Alessandro Vasallo, successfully negotiated the partisans&#x27; release of their &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; prisoners and of the body of the SS soldier killed earlier. Despite the successfully negotiated release of the body and prisoners, Peiper ordered the soldiers of &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; to summarily kill 24 men of the Boves village in retaliation for the resistance of the villagers. They also killed a woman when they looted and burned her house.

In the after action report to the LSSAH headquarters, &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; described the Boves massacre as Peiper&#x27;s heroic defence against anti-German attacks by Communist partisans in which &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers battled, defeated, and killed 17 bandits and partisans, and that &quot;during the fights [with partisans] the villages of Boves and Costellar were burned down. [That] in nearly all [the] burning houses [stores of] ammunition exploded. Some bandits were shot.&quot;

==Ukraine, 1943==
In November 1943, the LSSAH fought in battles at Zhytomyr, in Ukraine. In the course of battle, although he lacked experience in leading tanks Peiper replaced the regiment&#x27;s dead commander and so assumed command of the 1st SS Panzer Regiment. In early December, Peiper was nominated for a medal for the successes of the 1st Regiment: the destruction of some Red Army artillery batteries and a division headquarters, having killed 2,280 Red Army soldiers in just two days of action (5-6 December), and delivering only three Red Army Prisoners of War (PoWs) to military intelligence. The recommendation for awarding the medal to Peiper described the scorched-earth attacks of the 1st SS Panzer Regiment, wherein tank commander Peiper &quot;attacked with all weapons and flame-throwers from his SPW&quot; armoured fighting vehicle to defeat the Red Army defenders, and then &quot;completely destroyed&quot; the village of Pekartchina.

Peiper&#x27;s over-aggressive style of leadership caused him to disregard tactical common sense in deploying the tanks and infantry forces of the 1st SS Panzer Regiment in battle against the Red Army. Peiper&#x27;s battlefield victories cost more &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; casualties (soldiers killed and soldiers wounded) than would have been lost with textbook tactics to achieve the same victory. Attacking without the benefit of prior reconnaissance by scout units, Peiper&#x27;s tank-and-infantry frontal assaults against entrenched Red Army units killed too many infantry and cost too much lost matériel for an essentially Pyrrhic victory; thus, after a month of Peiper&#x27;s command, the 1st SS Panzer Regiment had only twelve working tanks.

In December 1943, because of his destructive leadership of the 1st SS Panzer Regiment in Russia, the division command of the LSSAH relieved Peiper of combat duty and transferred him to staff-officer duty at the division headquarters. Despite his uneven battlefield performance in Russia, his political value for Nazi propaganda was greater than his shortcomings as a military officer; thus, on 27 January 1944, Hitler presented the Oak Leaves to Peiper.

==Western Front, 1944==
In March 1944, the LSSAH was withdrawn from the Eastern Front and sent to be reformed in Nazi-occupied Belgium. New and replacement soldiers were integrated into their ranks; most were adolescent boys, unlike the Nazi ideologue, fanatical soldiers from the 1930s. The difficult training and the brutal hazing-and-initiation rituals to which the new soldiers were subjected resulted in five soldiers being executed for not meeting the standards of &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot;; &quot;SS-Obersturmbannführer&quot; Peiper then ordered the new soldiers to look at the corpses of the failed soldiers. In 1956, the judicial authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany opened a war-crime case to investigate the accusation that Peiper deliberately killed some of his own &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers as a point of unit discipline. In 1966, Peiper claimed he knew nothing of it, and the lack of contradictory evidence and witnesses closed the case.

As the Allied invasion (Operation Overlord, 6 June 1944) began, the LSSAH were deployed to the coast of the English Channel to confront the expected Allied invasion at Pas de Calais in northern France; transport to the frontlines was limited, and the Allied air forces controlled the skies. From 18 July 1944, the &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; regiment saw action, but Peiper rarely was at the frontlines, because of the uneven terrain and the requisite radio silence. As with the other &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; and &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; units in the area, &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; fought defensively until Operation Cobra (25–31 July 1944) collapsed the German front when the U.S. Army destroyed every tank of the LSSAH and killed 25 per cent of their force of 19,618 soldiers.

After suffering a nervous breakdown during the fighting around Caen, Peiper was relieved of command on 2 August 1944. In September–October 1944 he was hospitalized; initially in Paris, and then to Tegernsee Reserve Hospital in Bavaria near his wife Sigi and children. 

So Peiper was not in command of the 1st SS Panzer Regiment during Operation Luttich (7–13 August 1944), the series of failed counter-attacks at Avranches.

He rejoined his regiment in October 1944. In November the 1st SS Panzer Corps was moved to the Cologne area to assist cleanup after Allied bombing. The new recruits were appalled by having to retrieve mashed and mangled bodies. Peiper remarked, &quot;Their hatred for the enemy was such ... I swear it. I could not always keep it under control.&quot; After going to Duren after a raid he confessed that he &quot;wanted to castrate the swine who did this with a broken glass bottle&quot; Peiper and his men wanted revenge. 

===Battle of the Bulge===

In the autumn of 1944, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; continually repelled Allied assaults to breach, penetrate, and cross the Siegfried Line, whilst Hitler sought the opportunity to seize the initiative on the Western Front. The result was Nazi Germany&#x27;s Ardennes Offensive, a desperate, strategic gambit whereby the German armies were intended to break through the U.S. lines in the Ardennes forest, cross the River Meuse, and then seize the city of Antwerp in order to break and divide the Allied front.

The 6th Panzer Army was to penetrate the American lines between Aachen and the Schnee Eifel, in order to seize the bridges over the Meuse, on both sides of the city of Liège. The 6th Panzer Army designated the LSSAH as the mobile-strike force, under the command of SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; Wilhelm Mohnke. Four combined-arms battle groups composed the 6th Panzer Division; Peiper commanded &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot;, the best-equipped battle group, which included the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion equipped with seventy-ton Tiger II tanks. &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; was to seize the bridges on the Meuse river between the cities of Liège and Huy. To address the shortage of fuel, headquarters provided Peiper with a map indicating the locations of U.S. Army fuel depots, where he intended to seize the fuel stores from the few U.S. Army soldiers manning those fuel dumps.

The 6th Panzer Army assigned &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; to routes that included narrow and single-lane roads, which compelled the infantry, armoured vehicles, and tanks to travel as a convoy approximately long. Peiper complained that the roads assigned were suitable for bicycles, but not for tanks; yet the chief of staff Fritz Krämer told Peiper: &quot;I don&#x27;t care how and what you do. Just make it to the Meuse. Even if you&#x27;ve only one tank left when you get there.&quot;

Peiper&#x27;s vehicles reached the point of departure at midnight, which delayed the attack by &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; by almost twenty-four hours. The plan was to advance through Losheimergraben, but the two infantry divisions tasked to open the route for &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; had failed to do so on the first day of battle. In the morning of 17 December, &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; captured Honsfeld and the U.S. Army&#x27;s stores of fuel. Peiper continued west until the road became impassable, a short distance from the town of Ligneuville; that detour compelled Peiper&#x27;s units towards the Baugnez crossroads, near the city of Malmedy, Belgium.

===War crimes===
During Peiper&#x27;s advance on 17 December 1944, his armoured units and half-tracks confronted a lightly armed convoy of about thirty American vehicles at the Baugnez crossroads near Malmedy. The troops, mainly elements of the American 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion, were quickly overcome and captured. Along with other American prisoners of war captured earlier, they were ordered to stand in a meadow before the Germans opened fire on them with machine guns, killing 84 soldiers, and leaving their bodies in the snow. The survivors were able to reach American lines later that day, and their story spread rapidly throughout the American front lines.

In Honsfeld, Peiper&#x27;s men murdered several other American prisoners. Other murders of POWs and civilians were reported in Büllingen, Ligneuville and Stavelot, Cheneux, La Gleize, and Stoumont on 17, 18, 19 and 20, 21 December. On 19 December, in the area between Stavelot and Trois-Ponts, while the Germans were trying to regain control of the bridge over the Amblève River (crucial for allowing reinforcements and supplies to reach them), men from &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; raped and killed a number of Belgian civilians. The battle group was eventually declared responsible for the deaths of 362 prisoners of war and 111 civilians.

===Defeat and retreat===

Peiper crossed Ligneuville and reached the heights of Stavelot on the left bank of the Amblève River at nightfall of the second day of the operation. The battle group paused for the night, allowing the Americans to reorganize. After heavy fighting, Peiper&#x27;s armour crossed the bridge on the Amblève. The spearhead continued on, without having fully secured Stavelot. By then, the surprise factor had been lost. The U.S. forces regrouped and blew up several bridges ahead of Peiper&#x27;s advance, trapping the battle group in the deep valley of the Amblève, downstream from Trois-Ponts. The weather also improved, permitting the Allied air forces to operate. Airstrikes destroyed or heavily damaged numerous German vehicles. Peiper&#x27;s command was in disarray: some units had lost their way among difficult terrain or in the dark, while company commanders preferred to stay with Peiper at the head of the column and thus were unable to provide guidance to their own units.

Peiper attacked Stoumont on 19 December and took the town amid heavy fighting. He was unable to protect his rear, which enabled American troops to cut him off from the only possible supply road for ammunition and fuel at Stavelot. Without supplies, and with no contact with other German units behind him, Peiper could advance no further. American attacks on Stoumont forced the remnants of the battle group to retreat to La Gleize. On 24 December, Peiper abandoned his vehicles and retreated with the remaining men. German wounded and American prisoners were also left behind. According to Peiper, 717 men returned to the German lines out of 3,000 at the beginning of the operation.

Despite the failure of Peiper&#x27;s battle group and the loss of all tanks, Mohnke recommended Peiper for a further award. The events at the Baugnez crossroads were described in glowing terms: &quot;Without regard for threats from the flanks and only inspired by the thought of a deep breakthrough, the Kampfgruppe proceeded ... to Ligneuville and destroyed at Baugnez an enemy supply column and after the annihilation of the units blocking their advance, succeeded in causing the staff of the 49th Anti-Aircraft Brigade to flee.&quot; Rather than a stain on Peiper&#x27;s honour, the killing of POWs was celebrated in official records. In January 1945, the Swords were added to his Knight&#x27;s Cross. The great fame of Peiper as a Waffen-SS commander during the Battle of the Bulge was born.

==Hungary, 1945==
In early 1945, in Hungary, &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; fought in Operation Southwind (17–24 February 1945) and in Operation Spring Awakening (6–15 March 1945) in the battles of which, despite killing many enemy soldiers, Peiper&#x27;s aggressive style of command cost many more wounded and dead &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers than were necessary to win the battle. On 1 May 1945, as the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler was forced into Austria, Peiper&#x27;s men learned of the death of the &quot;Führer&quot; the previous day. On 8 May, the German high command ordered the units of the Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler to surrender to the U.S. Army that was across the River Enns.

==Capture and arrest==
Flouting the high command&#x27;s order to surrender, Col. Peiper trekked home to Germany where American forces captured him on 22 May 1945. In late June 1945, U.S. Army war-crime investigators began the forensic investigation of the Malmedy massacre that the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; committed on 17 December 1944. The war crimes committed during the Battle of the Bulge were attributed to Battle Group Peiper, so the U.S. Army searched PoW camps for the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers assigned to Peiper&#x27;s command. Moreover, as the battle-group commander, Peiper headed the list of war criminals sought by the U.S. Army from among four million prisoners of war. On 21 August 1945, &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; Standartenführer Peiper was found and identified as the suspected author of the war-crime massacre of 84 U.S. soldiers in a farmer&#x27;s field near the city of Malmédy, Belgium.

In July 1945, during his interrogations by JAG and military intelligence officers, Peiper revealed his commitment to Nazism; when the Army interrogators asked his opinion about the plight of the Poles and the Jews, Peiper agitatedly replied that: &quot;All Jews are bad and all Poles are bad. We have just cleansed our society and moved &quot;these people&quot; into camps, and you let them loose!&quot; Moreover, as a &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; officer, Peiper also lamented to the Army interrogators that the U.S. government was wrong in having refused to incorporate the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; into the U.S. Army to &quot;prepare to fight the Russians&quot; in defence of Western civilisation.

In Upper Bavaria, at the U.S. military jail in Freising, the judicial and military intelligence interrogators soon learned that, although Peiper and his &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; troops were hardened soldiers, they had not been trained to withstand interrogation as prisoners of war. Being psychologically unsophisticated men, some SS PoWs readily answered the questions asked of them by the interrogators; other SS PoWs claimed they only spoke to interrogators after having endured threats, beatings, and mock trials.

In the course of his interrogations, Peiper assumed command responsibility for the actions of his soldiers. In December 1945, the Army transferred him to the prison at Schwäbisch Hall, and there integrated Peiper to a group of approximately 1,000 &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers and officers of the LSSAH who also awaited judicial processing for their war crimes. On 16 April 1946, the prison transferred 300 &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; POWs to the Dachau Concentration Camp, where a military tribunal would hear their war-crime cases.

==War crimes trial==

In the 16 May – 16 July 1946 period, at the Dachau Concentration Camp, a military tribunal heard the Malmedy Massacre Trial of 74 defendants, which featured &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; Lt. Col. Joachim Peiper (Cmdr. 1st SS Panzer Regiment) who committed the war crimes; Sepp Dietrich (Cmdr. 6th SS Panzer Army); Fritz Krämer (Dietrich&#x27;s chief of staff); and Hermann Prieß (Cmdr. I SS Panzer Corps). The U.S. Army&#x27;s war-crime bill of charges was based upon the facts reported in the sworn statements given by the Party, &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; PoWs in the Schwäbisch Hall prison.

To counter the evidence in the sworn statements of the Nazi defendants and the prosecution witnesses, the lead defence attorney, Lt. Col. Willis M. Everett, tried to show that the sworn statements had been obtained by inappropriate interrogation. Defence counsel Everett then called Lt. Col. Hal D. McCown, commander 2nd Battalion, 119th Infantry Regiment, to give testimony about his captivity – as a prisoner of war – of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; who captured him and his unit on 21 December 1944, in the vicinity of La Gleize, Belgium. In his trial testimony, Lt. Col. McCown said that he had not witnessed Col. Peiper&#x27;s &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers mistreating their American prisoners of war.
The prosecutor countered that, by the time Lt. Col. McCown and his soldiers had been captured on 21 December, battle group commander Peiper already was aware that the tactical situation of being out-numbered, out-gunned, and out-manoeuvred placed &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; in danger of imminent capture by the U.S. Army. While on 17 December 1944, the units of the Battle Group Peiper at Malmédy, Belgium were advancing to their objectives, by 21 December 1944, continual firefights with the U.S. Army had divided and dispersed scattered Battle Group Peiper, and thus almost trapped Peiper&#x27;s unit, and Peiper, at La Gleize. By that point, Peiper&#x27;s vehicles had little fuel and his soldiers had suffered 80 per cent casualty rates.

Defence counsel Everett called only Peiper to testify. In his testimony, Peiper communicated only calculation about the usefulness of his American prisoners of war, testifying that when the Peiper Battle Group fled afoot from the town of La Gleize, Col. Peiper made hostages of Lt. Col. McCown and some of his soldiers in order to protect his &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers from capture by the U.S. Army.

Despite the damning and incriminating facts that Peiper testified to the military tribunal, the other defendant SS-men, supported by their German lawyers, unwisely asked for the opportunity to testify. The prosecutor&#x27;s cross-examinations compelled the SS men to behave like &quot;a bunch of drowning rats ... turning on each other&quot; to survive; thus did the Nazi PoW testimonies – of soldiers and officers – about the Malmedy war crimes provide the military tribunal with reasons to condemn to death several of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; defendants.

The military tribunal were unconvinced by Peiper&#x27;s testimony that, as the commanding officer of the Battle Group Peiper, he, Col. Peiper, had no command responsibility for the summary execution of American PoWs by his &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers. When asked about having ordered his soldiers to summarily murder Belgian civilians, Peiper said that the dead people were partisan guerrillas – not civilians.

Two witnesses testified to having heard Peiper on two occasions order the summary execution of U.S. PoWs; yet, when the prosecutor asked whether or not he gave the orders for the summary executions, Peiper denied the veracity of the eyewitness testimony, claiming that the testimony had been coerced from men under mental duress and physical torture.

===Commuted death sentence===
On 16 July 1946, the military tribunal for the Malmedy Massacre Trial convicted Joachim Peiper of the war crimes of which he was accused and sentenced him to be hanged. In the judicial system of the U.S. Army, a sentence of death is automatically reviewed by the U.S. Army Review Board, and, in October 1947, death-sentence reviewers commuted some verdicts into long imprisonment for Nazi war criminals. In March 1948, Gen. Lucius D. Clay, the U.S. military governor of Occupied Germany, reviewed 43 death sentences, and confirmed the legality of only 12 death sentences, including the death sentence of &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; Col. Peiper.

In 1951, about politicking for the political rehabilitation of &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; Colonel Joachim Peiper, ex-general Heinz Guderian said to a correspondent:

At the moment, I&#x27;m negotiating with General Handy [in Heidelberg], because [he] wants to hang the unfortunate Peiper. McCloy is powerless, because the Malmedy trial is being handled by Eucom, and is not subordinate to McCloy. As a result, I have decided to cable President Truman and ask him if he is familiar with this idiocy.
In 1948, the judicial reviewers of the trial verdicts of the military tribunal commuted the war-crime death sentences of some &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; defendants in the Malmedy massacre trial to life imprisonment. In 1951, Peiper&#x27;s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. In 1954, it was further commuted to 35 years imprisonment. He was released on parole on 22 December 1956. When Peiper was told he was being released by two U.S. soldiers, he was so shocked that he stared at them silently. The political lobbying of the network of SS men arranged and realised Peiper&#x27;s early release from prison and his finding employment; the Mutual Aid Community of Former Members of the Waffen SS (HIAG) already had found employment for Frau Peiper near the Landsberg Prison wherein her husband resided. Thanks to the political influence of Albert Prinzing, an ex-functionary in the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) security service, Peiper was employed at the Porsche automobile company.

==Post-war revisionist==
On release from Landsberg Prison, Joachim Peiper acted discreetly and did not associate with known Nazis in public, especially with ex-&quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers and the Mutual Aid Association of Former Waffen-SS Members (HIAG); privately, Peiper remained a true-believer Nazi and member of the secret community of &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; in the Federal Republic of Germany.

In 1959, Peiper attended the national meeting of the Association of Knight&#x27;s Cross Recipients. He travelled with Walter Harzer, the HIAG historian, and reunited with Sepp Dietrich and Heinz Lammerding, who had also been formally identified as Nazi war criminals. His active social life in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; community included Peiper&#x27;s public participation in the funerals of dead Nazis such as those of Kurt Meyer, Paul Hausser, and Dietrich. Collaborating with the HIAG, Peiper secretly worked for the political rehabilitation of &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers and officers, by suppressing their war-crime records and misrepresenting them as war veterans of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. Nevertheless, self-awareness of his legalistic chicanery allowed Peiper to tell a friend: &quot;I, personally, think that every attempt at rehabilitation during our lifetime is unrealistic, but one can still collect material.&quot;

On 17 January 1957, the Porsche automobile company employed Peiper in Stuttgart. In the course of his employment, Italian trade union workers formally complained that Peiper was unacceptable as a co-worker because he remained a Nazi and because of the wartime Boves massacre committed by his command, the &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot;, in Italy. An owner of the car company, Ferry Porsche, personally intervened to promote Peiper into a management job, but the trade unions legally refused to work with Peiper; despite the friendship with Porsche, and because of lost sales of cars in the U.S. – for employing a Nazi war criminal – the Porsche automobile company dismissed Peiper from his employment.

On 30 December 1960, Peiper filed a lawsuit against the Porsche car company, wherein the attorney claimed that Joachim Peiper was not a Nazi war criminal because the Allies had used the Malmedy massacre trial (1946) as propaganda to defame the German people; likewise the Nuremberg trials (20 November 1945 – 1 October 1946) and the Malmedy massacre trial were anti-German propaganda. Peiper&#x27;s attorney cited documents by Freda Utley, a Holocaust denier academic, which said that the U.S. Army had tortured the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; defendants in the Malmedy massacre trial.

The court ordered that Porsche void the employment contract and indemnify Peiper for the dismissal. Moreover, that lost job allowed &quot;Der Freiwillige&quot;, the official newspaper of the HIAG, to misrepresent Peiper as having been &quot;unfairly sentenced&quot; for war crimes committed by other Nazis. The HIAG then found Peiper employment as a trainer of car salesmen at the Volkswagen automobile company.

==Further prosecutions==
In the early 1960s, Cold War geopolitics in western Europe required transforming Germany from enemy (Nazi Germany) to ally (Federal Republic of Germany) for consequent integration into NATO. Consequent to the relative de-Nazification of German society, the economy of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) disallowed ex-Nazis to hide among the educated staff of a business company in post-War Germany; a Nazi diploma was unacceptable for employment. The Adolf Eichmann trial (1961) and the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials (1963–1965) informed the world of the true, racist nature of Nazi Germany and their politics of official antisemitism and the Final Solution in order to realise the Holocaust – the purpose of Nazism.

Unlike in the aftermath of the Second World War (1939–1945) in Europe, when the Allies prosecuted war crimes under a limited remit (1945–1947), the Federal Republic of Germany continually extended the statute of limitations for the prosecution of war crimes in order to successfully hunt, capture, and prosecute the war criminals of the Nazi party, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, and the &quot;Gestapo&quot;. In their testimonies at the war-crime trials in the FRG, the Nazi war criminals repeatedly named &quot;SS-Obersturmbannführer&quot; Joachim Peiper as an active participant in the massacres of civilians and PoWs at the Eastern front and at the Western front of the War; among the fellow Nazis who betrayed Peiper in court were Karl Wolff (senior adjutant to Himmler) and Werner Grothmann (Peiper&#x27;s successor as adjutant to Himmler). At trial, the court heard Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski (&quot;Bandenbekämpfung&quot; chief for occupied Europe) speak of Himmler&#x27;s plans to &quot;rid Russia of thirty million Slavic people&quot; and Himmler&#x27;s pronouncements, at Minsk, that he was &quot;determined to eliminate the Jews&quot;.

In 1964, the village of Boves, Italy erected a monument commemorating the victims of the Boves Massacre committed by the &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; on 13 September 1943. Offended by that explicit, public identification as a war criminal, Peiper asked the Mutual Aid Association of Former Members of the Waffen-SS (HIAG) to legally defend him against that war-criminal label. Peiper&#x27;s defence attorney said that Italian Communists had fabricated evidence to substantiate false Nazi war-crime accusations; Peiper again repeated that Battle Group Peiper had to destroy the village of Boves in the course of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; defence against Communist partisans.

On 23 June 1964, the Central Office of the State Justice Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes formally accused Peiper of perpetrating the Boves Massacre in 1943. The formal accusation was based upon statements of two ex-partisans who recognized SS Lt. Col. Joachim Peiper from two published photographs in a picture-book about the Battle of the Bulge and from a photograph of &quot;SS-Obersturmbannführer&quot; Peiper observing the incineration of the village of Boves. In 1968, the German District Court in Stuttgart determined that Battle Group Peiper had set houses afire and that &quot;a portion of the victims killed was from rioting that was committed by [the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers]&quot;. Nevertheless, despite the battle group&#x27;s collective culpability for the war-crime at Boves, there was no evidence of the individual command responsibility that &quot;SS-Obersturmbannführer&quot; Joachim Peiper, himself, had directly ordered the massacre of villagers at Boves, Italy.

==Personal life==
In 1938, Peiper met and courted Sigurd Hinrichsen, a secretary who was a friend of Lina Heydrich (wife of Reinhard Heydrich) and a friend of Hedwig Potthast, secretary and mistress to Himmler. On 26 June 1939, Peiper married Sigurd in an SS ceremony; Himmler was the guest of honour. The Peipers lived in Berlin until its bombing in 1940; Sigurd Peiper then went to live in Rottach-Egern, Upper Bavaria, near Himmler&#x27;s second residence. They had three children.

==Final years==
In 1972, Joachim and Sigurd Peiper moved to Traves, Haute-Saône, in eastern France, where he owned a house. Under the pseudonym &quot;Rainer Buschmann&quot;, Peiper worked as a self-employed English-to-German translator for the German publisher Stuttgarter MotorBuch Verlag, translating books of military history. Despite his biography and working pseudonymously, they lived under his true, German name, &quot;Joachim Peiper&quot;, and soon attracted the notice of anti-fascists.
In 1974, a member of the French Resistance recognised Peiper and reported his presence in metropolitan France to the French Communist Party. In 1976, the historian of the French Communist Party searched the &quot;Gestapo&quot; files for the personnel file of &quot;SS-Oberststurmbannführer&quot; Joachim Peiper to determine his whereabouts. On 21 June 1976, anti-Nazi political activists distributed informational flyers to the Traves community informing them that Peiper was a Nazi war criminal residing among them. On 22 June 1976, an article in the &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; newspaper confirmed that Peiper was living in the village.

The confirmation of Peiper&#x27;s Nazi identity and presence in France attracted journalists to whom Peiper readily gave interviews, wherein he claimed that he was a victim of Communist harassment due to his role in the war. In an interview (&quot;J&#x27;ai payé&quot; &quot;I Already Have Paid&quot;), Peiper said he was an innocent man who had paid for his war crimes (referring to the Malmedy massacre) with twelve years of prison. He said he was innocent of the earlier Boves massacre war crime in Italy. He also said, &quot;In 1940, French people weren&#x27;t brave, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here&quot;. These insulting remarks angered the press and residents. It was reported that he and his wife left France and moved to West Germany due to death threats.

==Death==
On Bastille Day, 14 July 1976, French communists attacked and set fire to Peiper&#x27;s house in Traves. When the fire was extinguished, firefighters found the charred remains of a man holding a pistol and a .22 calibre rifle, as if defending himself. The arson investigators determined that person had died from smoke inhalation. The anti-Nazi political group The Avengers claimed responsibility for the arson that killed Peiper; nonetheless, because of the destruction caused by the arson, some French police authorities remained unconvinced that Joachim Peiper was the person found.

==Neo-Nazi legacy==
In the United States, Joachim Peiper is an idol of neo-Nazi Americans who romanticise the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; as German war heroes, rather than as Nazi war criminals. In the post-war period of the late 1940s and early 1950s, the cultural context – xenophobic Russo-American Cold War and reactionary McCarthyism – allowed historical, factual, and personal misrepresentations of Peiper to coalesce into the cult of personality practised by certain right-wing organisations, such as the HIAG (Mutual Aid Association of Former Members of the Waffen-SS) who sought his early release from war-crime imprisonment in West Germany. In American popular culture, Lt. Col. Peiper&#x27;s military bearing, good looks, commanding presence, and a chestful of Nazi medals earned him many right-wing admirers in civilian society and in military society.

In the U.S. military, the idolatry of Peiper penetrated the official publications of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). In 2019, the DoD Facebook account included a colourised military photograph of Peiper in &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; uniform in an audiovisual commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the U.S. Army fighting &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers at the Battle of the Bulge – which included the Malmedy Massacre (1944) committed by &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot;. Peiper&#x27;s &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; photograph provoked &quot;widespread backlash on social media&quot; because the DoD publication appeared to celebrate a Nazi war criminal as a German war hero; the DoD apologised and deleted the photograph. Despite that political misstep, the Pentagon used Peiper&#x27;s &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; photograph to represent the German enemy fighting the U.S. Army airborne corps in the Battle of the Bulge. Moreover, the Facebook page of the Army&#x27;s 10th Mountain Division also featured Peiper&#x27;s colourised &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; military photograph to represent the German enemy they fought in the Second World War.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; newspapers quoted Facebook commentators who said that the DoD&#x27;s positive military biography of the war criminal Joachim Peiper was a &quot;vile and disturbing&quot; exercise in historical negationism, which had the tone of &quot;a &#x27;fanboy-flavoured&#x27; piece&quot; of right-wing propaganda. Moreover, the researchers of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; traced the source of Peiper&#x27;s colourised photograph to the Twitter account of a pro-Nazi artist who publishes photographs of Nazis, with captions of supportive praise for Nazism and Hitler, and concluded that:

It remains unclear how Pentagon and Army officials cleared an image, apparently created by an artist who celebrates Nazi propaganda online, to be published alongside a tribute to the American soldiers who fought and died to defeat a fascist regime 75 years ago. But the misstep is just the latest in a month of embarrassing incidents for the U.S. Army, which has been recently slammed with multiple allegations of white supremacist activity.

<doc id="487976" wikidata="Q1742005" url="?curid=487976" title="&quot;King&quot; Bennie Nawahi">
<text>&quot;King&quot; Bennie Nawahi (July 3, 1899 – January 29, 1985) was an American steel guitarist from Hawaii who was popular in the U.S. during the 1920s and 1930s.

==Biography==

Benjamin Keakahiawa Nawahi was born in Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, one of 12 children. While not of royal descent, he was eventually nicknamed &quot;King&quot; as many show business personalities are for their particular genre.

Nawahi learned to play guitar in the parks of Honolulu for pennies, often teaming with Sol Hoopii, who would later become his rival for the title &quot;King of the Hawaiian Guitar&quot;, along with Sam Ku West. He was also known as &quot;King of the Ukulele&quot;.

In 1919 Nawahi played with his brother Joe&#x27;s band, the Hawaiian Novelty Five, on the Matsonia passenger liner that sailed between Honolulu and San Francisco. The group eventually became a staple on the Orpheum vaudeville circuit&#x27;s North America tour.

Bennie Nawahi separated from the group and embarked on a solo career as a singing ukulele player. Master showman Sid Grauman proclaimed him &quot;King of the Ukulele&quot; and the nickname stuck.

In 1920 an act of the United States Congress established &quot;Hawaii National Park&quot; (later split into Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and Haleakalā National Park), shining a spotlight on the islands. The 1920s became a heyday for all things Hawaiian, including novelty acts of the vaudeville genre. Among Nawahi&#x27;s novelty stunts was playing &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; on Hawaiian guitar with his feet. Tin Pan Alley went with the Hawaii craze and between 1915 and 1929 produced such ditties as &quot;Hello Hawaii How Are You?&quot; (1915) (when many pronounced the state&#x27;s name as How-Wah-Yah), &quot;Oh How She Could Yacki Hacki Wiki Wacki Woo&quot; (1916), &quot;Hula Hula Dream Girl&quot; (1924) and &quot;That Aloha Waltz&quot; (1928).

There is some evidence Bennie Nawahi also used the name &quot;J. Nawahi&quot;, as the Victor Library lists the tune &quot;Hula Blues&quot; by &quot;J. Nawahi (instrumentalist : steel guitar)&quot;.

By 1928 Nawahi had begun recording for multiple record labels, including Columbia, Victor, Q.R.S. and Grey Gull, under multiple names (including Red Devils, Q.R.S. Boys, Slim Smith, Hawaiian Beach Combers, Georgia Jumpers, Four Hawaiian Guitars and King Nawahi &amp; the International Cowboys), with bandmates that included soon to be Sons of the Pioneers, Tim Spencer (singer) and Leonard Slye (later to become cowboy star Roy Rogers).

==Blindness and later life==

One night in 1935 while driving home from a performance, Nawahi was suddenly struck blind. No medical cause was ever identified. The loss of vision was permanent, but he never allowed it to impede his life, as he continued performing and touring until the 1970s, when he was partially paralyzed by a stroke.

Nawahi set a remarkable swimming record for blind people in 1946. He swam the 22 miles of choppy Pacific Ocean waters from San Pedro, California to Santa Catalina Island in just over 22 hours, guided only by coach John Sonnichson and a bell on a lead boat.

He appeared briefly in the 1985 Academy Award-nominated documentary film on Roy Smeck, &quot;Wizard of the Strings&quot;.

He died in Long Beach, California on January 29, 1985.

<text>Vajiravudh (1 January 188126 November 1925) was the sixth king of Siam from the Chakri dynasty, titled Rama VI. He reigned from 1910 until his death in 1925. King Vajiravudh is best known for his efforts to create and promote Siamese nationalism. His reign was characterized by Siam&#x27;s movement further towards democracy and minimal participation in World War I. He had keen interests in Siamese history, archaeology, and literature, as well as economics, politics and world affairs, and founded the country&#x27;s first university, Chulalongkorn University.

==Education==

Vajiravudh was born on 1 January 1881 to Chulalongkorn and one of his four queens and half sister Saovabha Phongsri. In 1888, upon coming of age, Vajiravudh received the title &quot;Kromma Khun&quot; Debdvaravati (Prince of Ayutthaya). Also in 1888, Vajiravudh began suffering from a severe illness and was brought to Ko Sichang by his father to recover.

Prince Vajiravudh was first educated in the royal palace in Thai and English. His full siblings were Bahurada Manimaya, Tribejrutama Dhamrong, Chakrabongse Bhuvanath, Siriraj Kakudhabhand, Asdang Dejavudh, Chudadhuj Dharadilok and Prajadhipok, who succeeded him as King Rama VII. In 1895, his half-brother Crown Prince Vajirunhis died and Vajiravudh was appointed the new Crown Prince of Siam. In 1898, he continued his education in Britain at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and was commissioned as a captain in the Durham Light Infantry, which he served with for three months of exercises in the south of England upon graduation. He studied law and history at Christ Church, Oxford in 1899, where, coming from a royal household, he was a member of the exclusive Bullingdon Club. However, he suffered from appendicitis, which barred him from graduating in 1901. He visited other European countries while he lived in England, including Belgium where he inspected Blegny fort. He went to Berlin in May 1902 and Copenhagen in September 1902. He attended the 15 May 1902 enthronement ceremonies for King Alfonso XIII of Spain in Madrid. On behalf of his father, King Chulalongkorn, he attended the coronation of King Edward VII on 9 August 1902.

Crown Prince Vajiravudh left England in October 1902 and returned to Siam in January 1903, traveling via US and Japan. In 1904, he became a temporary monk in accordance with Siamese tradition. In 1907, his father Chulalongkorn travelled to Europe to seek treatment for his kidney disease, and Chulalongkorn made Vajiravudh Regent of Siam. One of Crown Prince Vajiravudh&#x27;s accomplishments during this regency was his supervision of the construction of the equestrian statue of King Chulalongkorn.

Chulalongkorn died on 23 October 1910, and Vajiravudh succeeded his father as king of Siam.

==Accession and early reforms==

Even before his coronation, Vajiravudh initiated several reforms. He organized Siam&#x27;s defence and established military academies. He created the rank of &quot;general&quot; for the first time in Siam, with his uncle, Prince Bhanurangsi Savangwongse as the first Siamese Field Marshal. On 11 November 1910, Vajiravudh underwent a provisional coronation ceremony, with a more lavish one planned for after the funerary rites of his father were complete.

His first act following his accession to the throne was to build the Royal Pages College, subsequently renamed Vajiravudh College by King Prajadhipok to honour his brother. It was built as an all-boy&#x27;s boarding school in the same tradition as English public schools such as Eton and Harrow. The school was built instead of a royal monastery, formerly a custom of Thai kings, as King Vajiravudh deemed that there were already too many temples in Bangkok. In his own hand written letter, King Vajiravudh wrote that &quot;In the Royal Pages College, what I want is not so much to turn out model boys, all of the same standard, all brilliant scholars with thousands of marks each, as to turn out efficient young men— young men who will be physically and morally clean, and who will be looking forward keenly to take up whatever burden the future of our state may lay upon them&quot;. Later he also raised the Civil Servant School to &quot;Chulalongkorn Academy for Civil Officials&quot;, then Chulalongkorn University. Both Vajiravudh College and Chulalongkorn University still benefit from the funds that King Vajiravudh set aside for the use of the two elite institutions. He also improved Siamese healthcare systems and set up some of the earliest public hospitals in Siam, Vajira Hospital in 1912 and Chulalongkorn Hospital in 1914.
In 1911, he established the Wild Tiger Corps []) a para-military corp outside of the established military hierarchy. Initially a ceremonial guard, it became a military force of 4,000 within its first year and consumed much of the King&#x27;s time and energy. It became the source of deep dissatisfaction between the army and the King. A branch for children was also established known as ( ) which became the Boy Scouts.

On 28 November 1911 Vajiravudh&#x27;s second and formal coronation was held with visiting royals from Europe and Japan as guests, a first for Siam, which festivities took 13 days. Later that year, the first airplane was flown in Siam.

The early years of Vajiravudh&#x27;s administration were largely dominated by his two uncles, Prince Damrong and Prince Devawongse, both of them Chulalongkorn&#x27;s right-hand men. However, the king disagreed with Prince Damrong, Minister of Interior, over Damrong&#x27;s negotiation of the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 that ceded four sultanates to the British Empire.

Vajiravudh reformed his father&#x27;s monthon system by creating the &quot;paks&quot; () or &quot;regions&quot; over the administrative monthons. Each pak was governed by an Uparaja (viceroy) directly responsible to the king. The &quot;Uparaja&quot; presided over the intendants of monthons in the region—thus concentrating local administrative powers in his hands—much to the dismay of Prince Damrong.

==Attempted coup==


Radicals expected a new constitution upon the coronation of Vajiravudh. However, no constitution was forthcoming. In 1911, the Wuchang Uprising that led to the fall of Qing dynasty prompted Siamese radicals to act. So, for the first time in Siam, an attempt was made to overthrow the monarchy and establish democracy.

The immediate cause, however, occurred even before Vajiravudh&#x27;s coronation. In 1909, Crown Prince Vajiravudh ordered a Thai Royal Military Academy student who had had an argument with one of Vajiravudh&#x27;s pages to be caned. Academy alumni were further provoked by Vajiravudh&#x27;s creation of the Wild Tiger Corps, seen by the army as a threat to their prerogatives.

The plotters were relatively young army and naval officers, students during the 1909 incident. The coup was planned for 1 April—the traditional Siamese New Year&#x27;s Day. They planned to elevate one of Vajiravudh&#x27;s half brothers, Prince Raphi Phatthanasak, to be the first president of Siam. They believed that, if the absolute monarchy were removed, Siam would achieve modernization as in Japan under Emperor Taishō. The coup leaders accused the king of devoting his time to writing and acting in theatrical plays with his companions. They also accused him of living a luxurious Western-style life, building Sanam Chan Palace and Lumphini Park, and owning expensive horses from Australia, while preaching austerity and nationalism to his subjects. The counter-argument is that the assertions were political and his developments were for the good of the state, in terms of impressing visiting dignitaries, or developing assets for the nation. Rama VI donated Lumphini Park, originally an exhibition ground on royal land, to the public in 1925 at his expense.

The coup plan was leaked. Captain Yut Kongyu, who was selected as the assassin by lottery, told &quot;Mom Chao&quot; Prawatpan, and then Prince Chakrabongse, of the intended coup. Prince Chakrabongse arrested all the conspirators. Their sentences were severe, ranging from execution to long-term imprisonment. However, Vajiravudh rescinded the punishments and released the plotters, saying that what they did was for the sake of the kingdom.

==Administration, economy, infrastructure==

Rama VI inherited his father&#x27;s plan of building a modern nation although he was more skeptical of outside methods. Disagreements occurred incessantly with &quot;old aristocrats&quot;, many of whom were his relatives such as the celebrated Prince Damrong, his uncle, who took charge of the Ministry of Interior. As more and more corruption in the newly created provinces was reported, Rama VI created a viceroy system. Viceroys, appointed directly by the king, were sent to supervise provincial governors and local officials.

In 1912, Vajiravudh announced the change in the solar calendar era from the Rattanakosin Era (R.S.) designated by Chulalongkorn to the Buddhist Era with the year beginning 1 April 2455 BE (1912 CE).

In 1913, Siam faced a financial crisis as the Chinese-Siamese Bank went bankrupt.

In 1914, Vajiravudh, having determined that the act providing for the invocation of martial law, first promulgated by his father in 1907, was not consistent with modern laws of war nor convenient for the preservation of the external or internal security of the state, changed to the modern form that, with minor amendments, continues in force.

Also in 1914, the construction of Don Mueang Airport began. In the same year the Siamese government borrowed from the Federated Malay States to extend railways to the south. In 1915, Vajiravudh himself visited the southern provinces to oversee railway construction. The Bangkok railway station at Hua Lamphong was then established as a center of Siamese railroads. Prince Damrong eventually left the Ministry of Interior in 1915. In 1916, Vajiravudh appointed his half-brother, Prince of Kamphang Phet, as the Head of the Railway Department.

The king continued his father&#x27;s rice varieties competition. He also continued the overall royal encouragement of development of rice varieties, founding the Rangsit Rice Experiment Station in 1916 (now called Pathum Thani Rice Research Center and run by the Ministry of Agriculture).

In 1917, Vajiravudh established the Nakorn Sri Thammarat Regiment as his personal guard. In the same year Vajiravudh founded Chulalongkorn University, the first university in Siam, named in honor of his father. In 1918, Vajiravudh founded the Dusit Thani near Dusit Palace as an experimental site for democracy. The democratic institutions were imitated including elections, parliament, and the press. Vajiravudh himself acted as one of the citizens of Dusit Thani, yet the city was criticized by others as another of Vajiravudh&#x27;s theatrical conceits.

During 1918–1919 the price of rice soared. The government faced public criticism due to its tepid response. The major cause of the problem was the hoarding of rice. Chinese millers and rice merchants bought huge amounts of rice from farmers for export to Singapore, the largest rice market in the region. Price speculation was rampant. The government imposed a ban on rice exports. At the same time, public servants asked for higher wages due to the rising cost of living. The public, mainly the urban &quot;middle-class&quot;, and Chinese traders became more and more unhappy with the government.

==World War I and Siamese nationalism==
On 22 July 1917 Vajiravudh declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary. He aligned Siam with the Allied Powers and expelled German and Austrian officials from the Railway Department and Siam Commercial Bank. He also put the properties of the Central Powers under a Siamese government protectorate. Vajiravudh saw the war as an opportunity to create and promote Siamese nationalism. He changed the Flag of Siam from the elephant banner to the tricolor banner. King Vajiravudh is considered by some writers to be the father of Thai nationalism, which was later built upon by Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram and Sarit Thanarat. The alternative view is that the idea of nationalism by Rama VI was a later political construct. Prince Chula Chakrabongse classified him as a liberal.

Vajiravudh wrote a letter (held in the Gloucestershire Archives, England) to his friend Maynard Colchester Wemyss setting out his reasons for going to war, dated 18 September 1917. Wemyss was guardian to King Bhumipol&#x27;s father and two of his brothers. Vajiravudh described the presence of Imperial German spy activity in Bangkok, allying with business groups for economic arrangements after a German take-over of Siam. Wemyss and the King also corresponded about Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s Asian aggression, on atrocities involving the Kaiser&#x27;s army in Belgium (the Rape of Belgium) and the killing of British civilians by naval bombardment during the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. In 1921, Rama VI wrote to Wemyss that in avoiding the &quot;German militaristic spirit . . . Thai people had been protected as free minds&quot;.
Vajiravudh introduced the practice of using the name Rama for the Chakri kings in deference to the dynasty and following western practice, being then himself Rama VI.

Other than 140,000 Vietnamese colonial troops and workers drafted by the French, Siamese troops were the only Southeast Asians in the European theatre of World War I. However, the Siamese troops did not see much action, as they arrived in Europe towards the end of the war. Participation in the war allowed Siam to later negotiate with the Western powers as a partner, albeit a junior one. Although the Siamese pilots who trained in France did not see combat because the war ended, Siam&#x27;s participation in the First World war led to the founding of the Royal Thai Airforce and the airborne postal service. The Royal Siamese Transport Corps (Ror Yor) and Medical Corps did see front line action, but not in combat. Nineteen soldiers died, some in accidents, but mainly from the Spanish Flu.

==Financial crisis==
In 1917, the price of silver rose and exceeded the face value of silver coins. The coins were then melted down and sold. The government solved this by changing the pure silver coin to alloy. Vajiravudh eventually forbade exports of Siamese coins. In 1918, the usage of 1-baht coins was nullified and 1-baht banknotes were introduced. Coins were recalled and kept as a national reserve. In 1919, Vajuravudh imposed a military-exemptation tax () nationwide including on the royal members. As the need for huge capital increased, a new bank, later known as the &quot;Government Savings Bank&quot;, was founded in 1923.

Though the Siamese forces that joined the march at Versailles returned triumphant in 1919, the worldwide economic problems caused by World War I were serious. In the same year, drought hit Siam and rice shortages ensued. The government forbade the export of rice, the main Siamese export since the Bowring Treaty. Queen Mother Saovabha, Vajiravudh&#x27;s mother, died in 1919. Siamese participation in World War I opened the way to reconciliation, first with the United States in 1920, then to redress the unequal treaties imposed by Western powers in the 19th century.

In spite of the financial crisis, railway constructions continued. The railway reached Narathiwat and was expanded north and east. The construction of the Rama VI Bridge carrying the railway over the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok began in 1922 and the same year the railway reached Chiang Mai. However, the treasury was in such straits that a large loan from Britain was negotiated. Also in 1922, an insurgency occurred in Pattani over new taxation policies. It was readily suppressed by the Nakorn Sri Thammarat Regiment. In 1923, Vajiravudh announced his six principles in the governance of Pattani Province, emphasizing local freedom and tax measures.

==Personal life==
===Vajiravudh as a writer===
King Vajiravudh was one of Thailand&#x27;s most highly renowned artists, writing modern novels, short stories, newspaper articles, poems, plays, and journals. He translated many works of English and French literature into Thai, Among his works were translations of three Shakespeare plays: &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot;, and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. He wrote many other pieces promoting Thai nationalism, one of his nationalistic works is &quot;&quot; () based on ancient French chivalric rhyme &quot;Mon âme à Dieu, Ma vie au Roi, Mon cœur aux Dames, L&#x27;honneur pour moi&quot;, and might also be influenced by Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. King Vajiravudh also composed nonfiction such as “The War of Polish Succession”, which he wrote while he was Crown Prince (see also external links below).

The king was among those writers who introduced mysteries and detective stories to the Thai reading public. He translated Agatha Christie&#x27;s Hercule Poirot novels into Thai, and created the character &quot;Nai Thong-In&quot; () as a Siamese consulting detective, using Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes and Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s Dupin as an archetypes. He translated Sax Rohmer&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Scorpion&quot;.

The king was well-versed in Sanskrit and Hindu literature, including the Ramayana and the Mahabharata epics. He translated many stories from the two epics into Thai and also wrote plays inspired by Hindu literature. He was influenced by Rama, the incarnation of Lord Vishnu and hero of the Ramayana epic, to the extent that he systemized and promoted the use of the name &quot;Rama&quot; as the (English) reign names of all Thai kings of the Bangkok (Rattanakosin) era. His own reign was dubbed as &quot;Rama VI&quot;. (See Rama (Kings of Thailand))

As a homage to his great, great, great-grandfather, Tao Sên-pom, King Vajiravudh published a fictional play in Thai, based on the Prince and designed for performance with musical accompaniment in 1913. Prince Sên-pom was the father of Chao Praya Chakri, Rama I. The drama centres on a tale of Siamese courtly romance. It is absorbing fun and well-written. A copy of the play was given as a present to the Armstrong family in Cragside House, Rothbury, where it remains in the library. On a trip to the English Lake District, Vajiravudh directed the performance of a play at the Stonehenge-like setting of Castlerigg Stone Circle, in the mountains near Keswick.

In 1914 King Vajiravudh published in a Thai newspaper an article titled &quot;Jews of the Orient&quot; ().Vajiravudh explicitly adopted Western antisemitic tropes and applied them to Chinese in Siam. The essay was written in the context of a recent strike by Chinese merchants and workers which had paralyzed Bangkok, and may also have been the product of Vajiravudh&#x27;s exposure to European anti-Semitism. The article described Chinese immigrants in Thailand as having excessive &quot;racial loyalty and astuteness in financial matters.&quot; The king wrote, &quot;Money is their God. Life itself is of little value compared with the leanest bank account.&quot;

===Marriages===
Vajiravudh had been a king without a queen for about ten years. In 1920, he met &quot;Her Serene Highness&quot; Princess Varnvimol at his theatre at Phayathai Palace. They were engaged and Princess Vanbimol was elevated to Princess Vallabhadevi. However, four months later in 1921, Vajiravudh nullified the engagement and pursued Princess Vallabha&#x27;s sister, Princess Lakshamilavan, whom he engaged. However, the marriage was never held and the couple then separated. Princess Vallabha Devi was house-arrested in the Grand Palace from then on.

In 1921, Vajiravudh married Prueang Sucharitakul, who was a daughter of Lord Suthammamontri and elevated her to Lady Sucharitsuda. He then married Sucharitsuda&#x27;s sister, Prabai Sucharitakul, with the title of Lady Indrani. In 1922, Lady Indrani was elevated to Princess and Queen Indrasakdisachi. However, the queen suffered two miscarriages. In 1924, Vajiravudh married Krueakaew Abhaiwongse, later renamed Suvadhana, a daughter of Lord Aphaiphubet. Queen Indrasakdisachi was then demoted to Princess Consort in 1925.

Vajiravudh had only one child, a daughter with Suvadhana, Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda (; 1925–2011). In his influential book &quot;Imagined Communities&quot;, Anglo-Irish political scientist and historian Benedict Anderson speculated that the king was homosexual and that this would have prevented him from accession if the law of succession had not been reformed. Anderson was the first modern scholar to break the taboo and write about the king&#x27;s personal preferences.

==Succession law==

In 1924, Vajiravudh promulgated his Law of Succession, which has since become the code for Chakri dynasty successions. According to the law, the throne would be passed to the king&#x27;s sons and grandsons. However, in the case of Vajiravudh who had no sons, the throne would pass to his eldest &quot;true&quot; or full brother, that is, a brother who shared both the same father and mother, Queen Saovabha Phongsri. The law gave priority to the descendants of princes born to Queen Saovabha, then to Queen Savang Vadhana, and then to Queen Sukhumala Marasri. The law also forbade princes whose mother was foreign from the throne. This referred to his brother, Prince Chakrabongse, who had married a Russian woman. His son, Prince Chula Chakrabongse, was therefore barred from the throne.

==Financial problems and death==

In 1924, King Vajiravudh, accompanied by Suvadhana, visited the Federated Malay States. The reconciliation with European powers on unequal treaties progressed gradually, while the financial crisis was taking a great toll on Siam as another loan was taken from Britain and the firing of numerous government officials occurred. In 1925 Vajiravudh had to dissolve his Nakorn Sri Thammarat Regiment and merged provinces into larger units to lower maintenance costs.

In November 1925, it was announced that Vajiravudh fell ill. Princess Consort Suvadhana was then pregnant. Vajiravudh then announced his succession instructions: if Princess Suvadhana gave birth to a son, the throne would go to him. If not, the throne would pass to his surviving brother, Prince Prajadhipok of Sukhothai. He barred Princess Inthrasaksachi from being interred with him in the future and instead granted that right to Princess Suvadhana. Vajiravudh also barred his uncle, Prince Damrong, from the government.

On the night of 25 November, Princess Suvadhana gave birth to a princess only two hours before Vajiravudh&#x27;s death. Vajiravudh glimpsed his sole daughter for the first and only time before his demise on the 26 November 1925. The throne passed to his brother, Prajadhipok, who named Vajiravudh&#x27;s daughter as Princess Bejaratana.

==Tributes to Vajiravudh==
The 1930 poem &quot;Elegia do rei de Sião&quot; (&quot;Elegy to the King of Siam&quot;) by Brazilian modernist poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade is dedicated to Vajiravudh.

<text>Pato Banton (born Patrick Murray; 28 January 1961) is a reggae singer and toaster from Birmingham, England. He received the nickname Pato Banton from his stepfather: its first name derives from the sound of a Jamaican owl calling &quot;patoo, patoo&quot;, while its second comes from the disc jockey slang word &quot;banton&quot;, meaning heavyweight lyricist or storyteller. In 1994, he achieved a number 1 on the UK Singles Chart with a cover of The Equals&#x27; &quot;Baby, Come Back&quot;, featuring Robin and Ali Campbell of UB40.

==Biography==
Banton first came to public attention in the early 1980s when he worked with The Beat. He recorded &quot;Pato and Roger a Go Talk&quot; with Ranking Roger, included on the 1982 album &quot;Special Beat Service&quot;. He went on to record a series of singles for Fashion Records and Don Christie Records. He was one of the guest artists that appeared on the UB40 album &quot;Baggariddim&quot; in 1985. His debut single &quot;Hello Tosh&quot; featured a parody on a well-know jingle. Banton&#x27;s debut album was the 1985, Mad Professor-produced &quot;Mad Professor Captures Pato Banton&quot;, followed in 1987 by &quot;Never Give In&quot;, which included a collaboration with Paul Shaffer and a follow-up to his earlier collaboration with Ranking Roger with &quot;Pato and Roger Come Again&quot;. After an EP in 1988, Banton released a more pop-oriented LP, &quot;Visions of the World&quot;, followed by 1990&#x27;s &quot;Wize Up! (No Compromise)&quot;, which included a college radio hit in &quot;Spirits in the Material World&quot; (The Police cover) and another collaboration, &quot;Wize Up!&quot;, this time with David Hinds of Steel Pulse.

Banton then worked on a live album with Mad Professor, and then released 1992&#x27;s &quot;Universal Love&quot;. The album featured a song covered by Banton called &quot;United We Stand&quot;, which was written by fellow Birmingham musician Ray Watts, of the group Beshara. After a 1994 British number one hit with &quot;Baby Come Back&quot; (originally by Eddy Grant performing with The Equals) with Robin and Ali Campbell of UB40, a best-of album was released, and Banton was invited by Sting to join him on his &quot;This Cowboy Song&quot; single. His collaboration with Reggae Revolution on a reinterpolation of the Young Rascals single &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot; reached number 14 on the UK Singles Chart in July and became a major hit in New Zealand, reaching number four on the RIANZ Singles Chart and staying in the top 20 for nine weeks. It was the country&#x27;s 47th best-selling single of the year, received a Gold sales certification for selling over 5,000 copies, and was featured on the soundtrack of the 1996 film Kazaam and 1998 hit Disney remake &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;. 1996&#x27;s &quot;Stay Positive,&quot; credited to Pato Banton &amp; The Reggae Revolution, was followed by &quot;Life Is a Miracle&quot; in 2000. &quot;Life Is a Miracle&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Reggae Album in the 2001 Grammy Awards.

<text>Eagle-Eye Lanoo Cherry (born 7 May 1968) is a Swedish singer and stage performer. His 1997 single &quot;Save Tonight&quot; achieved commercial success in Ireland, the United States and the United Kingdom, and was voted song of the year in New Zealand. Cherry is the son of American jazz artist Don Cherry and Swedish artist and designer Moki Cherry.

He pursued acting during high school, though Cherry&#x27;s acting career was eventually set aside as his musical career took precedence in his life with his debut album &quot;Desireless&quot; (1997). He has released several other albums since his debut, and has co-written for other artists and films, and has guest-starred on reality television. Cherry&#x27;s music is of the acoustic, rock, post-grunge and alternative rock genres.

He is fluent in both English and Swedish.

==Early life==
Cherry was born on 7 May 1968, in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of American jazz artist Don Cherry and Swedish painter/textile artist Monika Cherry (). Of Choctaw descent through his paternal grandmother and African-American through his grandfather, Cherry is the fourth of five siblings. He is the half-brother of singer Neneh Cherry (his mother&#x27;s daughter with Ahmadu Jah). Other half-siblings are violinist Jan Cherry, Christian Cherry, and jazz musician David Ornette Cherry. At the age of 12, Cherry was sent to school in New York City. He remained there to work as an actor and a drummer in various bands. At 16, he enrolled in the High School of Performing Arts in New York in the same class as Jennifer Aniston and Chaz Bono.

==Career==
In 1988, Cherry was credited as &quot;Teenager&quot; in the film &quot;Arthur 2: On the Rocks&quot;. In 1989, he was credited as &quot;Vet #1&quot; in &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;. In 1993, he starred on the short-lived NBC action/adventure television show &quot;South Beach&quot;.

Cherry&#x27;s father died in 1995. He returned to Stockholm to focus on his music rather than an acting career. He began writing and recording his debut album, &quot;Desireless&quot;, in his bedroom studio on an acoustic guitar. According to manager Tommy Manzi, Cherry&#x27;s perfectionism made him keep the recordings under wraps until the album was virtually complete. The album became a commercial success throughout the world. &quot;Desireless&quot; sold four million copies worldwide and was certified platinum in the United States.

Cherry co-wrote and sang on &quot;Wishing It Was&quot; on Santana&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Supernatural&quot;, as well as in films such as Wim Wenders&#x27; &quot;The Soul of a Man&quot;, &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot;, &quot;The Love of the Game&quot;, &quot;GO&quot;, &quot;Best Laid Plans&quot;, &quot;Holes&quot;, &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; and &quot;Over Her Dead Body&quot;. Some of his best-known songs include &quot;Save Tonight&quot;, &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot;, &quot;Are You Still Having Fun?&quot;, &quot;Long Way Around&quot;, &quot;Feels So Right&quot;, &quot;Skull Tattoo&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;.

On 27 November 2012, he appeared as musical guest on &quot;The Voice of Romania&quot;. His fifth album, &quot;Streets of You&quot;, was released on 26 October 2018.

<text>Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG) is a publisher of family board game products. AEG was formed by Jolly Blackburn in 1993. Blackburn left the company in 1995 and the majority of the company is now owned by President &amp; CEO John Zinser. The company is virtual and does not have a physical headquarters but it is legally domiciled in the city of Henderson, Nevada. 

AEG&#x27;s first product was &quot;Shadis&quot; Magazine (winner of the 1994, 1995, and 1996 Origins Awards for &quot;Best Professional Gaming Magazine&quot;). In 1994 the company began working on the development of the Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game; that game was published in 1995. Throughout the 1990s AEG expanded its CCG offerings and began designing and publishing Role-Playing Game and Miniatures Wargame Game products as well. The company has exited the CCG, RPG and Miniatures Wargame categories and now exclusively publishes family board games.

Including the three for &quot;Shadis&quot; mentioned above, AEG products have garnered twenty Origins Awards (see the individual articles noted below for more details).

In 2014, Love Letter was on the recommended list published by the Spiel des Jahres judges committee.

In 2022, Cascadia, which AEG co-publishes with Flatout Games won the Spiel des Jahres Game of the Year award. AEG &amp; Flatout licensed the game to Kosmos for the award-winning German language edition.

<doc id="488005" wikidata="Q512203" url="?curid=488005" title="Underwater hockey">
<text>Underwater hockey (UWH), also known as Octopush in the United Kingdom, is a globally played limited-contact sport in which two teams compete to manoeuvre a puck across the bottom of a swimming pool into the opposing team&#x27;s goal by propelling it with a hockey stick (or pusher).

A key challenge of the game is that players are not able to use breathing devices such as scuba gear whilst playing, they must hold their breath. The game originated in Portsmouth, England in 1954 when Alan Blake, a founder of the newly formed Southsea Sub-Aqua Club, invented the game he called Octopush as a means of keeping the club&#x27;s members interested and active over the cold winter months when open-water diving lost its appeal. Underwater hockey is now played worldwide, with the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques, abbreviated CMAS, as the world governing body. The first Underwater Hockey World Championship was held in Canada in 1980.

==History==

Originally called &quot;Octopush&quot; (and still known locally by that name in the United Kingdom), the original rules called for teams of eight players (hence &quot;octo-&quot;), a bat reminiscent of a tiny shuffleboard stick called a &quot;pusher&quot; (hence the &quot;-push&quot;), an uncoated lead puck called a &quot;squid&quot;, and a goal known at first as a &quot;cuttle&quot; but soon thereafter a &quot;gulley&quot;. Apart from &#x27;pusher&#x27; and to a lesser extent &#x27;Octopush&#x27; much of this original terminology is now consigned to history.

Underwater hockey was started in the United Kingdom by Alan Blake in 1954. Blake was a founder-member of the newly formed Southsea Sub-Aqua Club (British Sub-Aqua Club No.9), he and other divers including John Ventham, Jack Willis, and Frank Lilleker first played this game in the Guildhall Baths in Portsmouth, United Kingdom.

Despite this, CMAS, the world governing body for underwater hockey, still erroneously maintains on its website that the sport originated with the British Royal Navy in the same time period.

The first rules were tested in a 1954 two-on-two game and Alan Blake made the following announcement in the November 1954 issue of the British Sub-Aqua Club&#x27;s then-official magazine &quot;Neptune&quot;: &quot;Our indoor training programme is getting under way, including wet activities other than in baths, and our new underwater game &quot;Octopush&quot;. Of which more later when we have worked out the details&quot;.

The first Octopush competition was a three-way tournament between teams from Southsea, Bournemouth, and Brighton underwater hockey clubs in early 1955. Southsea won then, and they are still highly ranked at national level today winning 20 out of 52 national championships.

The sport spread to Durban, South Africa in the mid/late 1950s, thanks to the spearfishermen of the Durban Undersea Club (DUC), when dirty summer seas prevented the young bloods from getting their weekly exercise and excitement. The first games were played in the pool of club member Max Doveton. However it soon became so popular that weekly contests were held in a municipal pool. The UK&#x27;s Octopush used a small paddle to push the puck whilst the South Africans used a mini hockey stick. Whilst the &quot;long stick&quot; version of underwater hockey did spread outside of South Africa, the UK&#x27;s &#x27;short stick&#x27; version ultimately prevailed and is how UWH is universally played now.

In the Americas, the game first came to Canada in 1962 via Norm Leibeck, an unconventional Australian scuba diving instructor and dive shop owner, who introduced the sport to a Vancouver dive club. Ten years later, the Underwater Hockey Association of British Columbia (UHABC) was formed and received support from the BC government.

Underwater hockey has been played in Australia since 1966, again because of Norm Leibeck, the same Australian who returned from Canada with his Canadian bride Marlene, and it now attracts players from a wide range of backgrounds there. The first Australian Underwater Hockey Championships were held in Margaret River, Western Australia in 1975. A Women&#x27;s division was added to the championships in 1981 and a Junior division commenced in 1990.

In Asia, the game first came to the Philippines in the late 1970s through growing awareness of Octopush within the scuba diving community.

Footage from British Pathe of an early game at Aldershot Lido in 1967, and from British Sub-Aqua Club archives, is evidence of the evolution of the sport in terms of equipment and playing style. It can be seen that the game was much slower and the puck was not flicked at all, in contrast to the modern sport where the substantial changes in equipment, team size, and other factors have helped make the game the international sport it is today, with 68 teams from 19 countries competing at the 18th World Championship in 2013 at Eger in Hungary making this the pinnacle in terms of international competition to date.

==Geography ==

==Play==

Two teams of up to ten players compete, with six players in each team in play at any one time. The remaining four players are continually substituted into play from a substitution area, which may be either on deck or in the water outside the playing area.

Before the start of play the puck is placed in the centre of the pool, and the players wait in the water whilst touching the wall above the goal they are defending. At the start-of-play signal (usually a buzzer or a gong) members of both teams are free to swim anywhere in the play area and try to score by manoeuvring the puck into the opponents&#x27; goal using only their stick. Players hold their breath as they dive to the bottom of the pool (a form of dynamic apnoea, as in free-diving). Play continues until either a goal is scored, when players return to their wall to start a new point, or a break in play is signalled by a referee (most commonly due to a foul or calling time for the half).

Games consist of two halves of fifteen minutes with a three-minute half-time, with teams switching ends at the end of the first half. Timing of games can vary by competition due to a number of reasons, most commonly organisational logistics; however, tier tournaments tend not to see any variation.

Unlike most other sports, formations are read from front to back instead of back to front:

The typical playing formation is 3-3 consisting of three forwards and three backs. Other common formations include 2-3-1, 1-3-2, and 2-2-2. Formations are generally very fluid and are constantly evolving with different national teams being proponents of particular tweaks in formations. One example of this is New Zealand with their &quot;box formation&quot; (2-1-2-1). 


During the game, each team gets unlimited rolling substitution with the (maximum of) four players in their sub box. Substitution strategy is imperative in underwater hockey as errors might result in a foul i.e. too many players in the play area at one time (an offence punishable by the sin bin) or a tactical blunder (e.g. an incorrect balance of forwards and backs due to an incorrect substitution).

There are a number of penalties described in the official underwater hockey rules, ranging from the use of the stick against something (or someone) other than the puck, playing or stopping the puck with something other than the stick, and &quot;blocking&quot; (interposing one&#x27;s self between a teammate who possesses the puck and an opponent; one is allowed to play the puck but not merely block opponents with one&#x27;s body). If the penalty is minor, referees award an advantage puck: the team that committed the foul is pushed back from the puck, while the other team gets free possession. For major penalties such as a dangerous pass (e.g. striking an opponent&#x27;s head) or intentional or repeated fouls, the referees may eject players for a specified period of time or for the remainder of the game, or even - in the case of very serious or deliberate fouls - for the remainder of a tournament. A defender committing a serious foul sufficiently close to his own goal may be penalised by the award of a penalty shot or even a penalty goal awarded to the fouled player&#x27;s team.

Often players who are most successful in this game are strong swimmers, have a great ability to hold and recover their breath, and are able to produce great speed underwater while demonstrating learned skills in puck control. It is also important that they are able to work well with their team members and take full advantage of their individual skills.

== Variations of play ==

=== 4-a-side ===
4-a-side underwater hockey is when there is four people per team playing at a given time. The teams usually consist of up to eight players with four subs. 4-a-side competitions are less common, though notable examples are the Hamilton 4-asides, Dunedin 4&#x27;s (both New Zealand), and the BOA 4s.

==Classification==
There have been debates throughout the sport&#x27;s history on its classification as either a breath-control sports or an extreme-apnoea sport. Though a 2023 study on submersion times in matches ranging from club friendlies to national championship matches found that the average player&#x27;s submersion time was 12.1 seconds when in possession of the puck and 9.3 when without the puck, thus falling short of the 45 second breath hold requirement for clarification as an extreme-apnoea sport.

==Equipment==
Players wear a diving mask, snorkel and fins, and carry in one (either) hand a short stick or pusher for playing the puck. A full list of equipment is given below:

===Swimwear===

There are usually no restrictions on swimwear, however baggy trunks or shorts are not recommended as they reduce speed and increase drag in the water. Typical swimwear is swim briefs or jammers for male players and athletic style racerback two-piece swimsuits with drawstring bottoms or one-piece swimsuits for female players. Additionally, wetsuits are not allowed according to Rule 3.3.8 of the CMAS International Rules for Underwater Hockey, Eleventh Edition.

===Mask===

A diving mask is used for several reasons:
* Players can equalise their ears (using the Valsalva manoeuvre) as the nose is covered
* Unlike swim goggles, a mask sits outside the eye&#x27;s orbit, reducing the effects of any impact
* Improved underwater vision
A low-volume mask with minimal protrusion from the face reduces the likelihood of the mask being knocked causing it to leak or flood and temporarily obstruct the player&#x27;s vision. The published rules require masks to have two lenses to reduce the risk and extent of possible injury from puck impact; the danger of a single lens mask is that the aperture may be large enough to allow a puck to pass through it on impact, and hence into the player&#x27;s eyes. A number of webbing strap designs are available to replace the original head strap with a non-elastic strap that can reduce the possibility of the player being unmasked.

===Snorkel===
A snorkel enables players to watch the progress of the game without having to lift their head from the water to breathe. This allows them to keep their position on the surface, ready to join play once they are able. In order to maximise the efficiency of breathing and reduce drag underwater snorkels are often short with a wide bore and may include a drain valve. The published rules mandate that they must not be rigid or have any sharp edges or points.

The snorkel may accommodate an external mouthguard which may be worn in conjunction with, or instead of, an internal mouthguard.

===Fins===

Fins allow the player to swim faster through the water. A wide variety of fins are used in the sport, but large plastic/rubber composite fins or smaller, stiffer fibreglass or carbon fibre fins are commonplace at competitions. As with any of the equipment, the published rules mandate fins without sharp edges or corners. All sharp edges must be covered up by a protective film or tape to prevent injury. Players are also normally required to use closed-heel fins (without buckles) as a further injury prevention measure.

Even well-fitting full-foot fins can occasionally be pulled off during play, either because of physical contact with something in the playing area or as a result of the power the wearer is transmitting through them into the water. When this occurs, stopping to refit a lost fin takes time and reduces a team to only five players. Fin grips, also known as fin retainers or fin keepers, are triple-strap devices enabling a closed-heel fin to be held more securely on a player&#x27;s foot. They are worn around the arch, the heel and the instep to try and prevent the wearer&#x27;s foot from slipping out of the foot-pocket of the fin.

===Stick===

The stick (also referred to as a pusher) is relatively short and is coloured either white or black to indicate the player&#x27;s team. The stick may only be held in one hand, which is usually determined by the player&#x27;s handedness, although players may swap hands during play. The shape of the stick may affect playing style and is often a very personal choice. A wide variety of stick designs are allowed within the constraints of the rules of the game, the principal rules being that the stick (including the handle) must fit into a box of and that the stick must not be capable of surrounding either the puck or any part of the hand. A rule concerning the minimum radius of edges tries to address the risk of injury should body contact occur. Construction materials may be of wood or plastics and current rules now supersede those that previously required sticks to be homogeneous, although they almost always are anyway. Many underwater hockey players manufacture their own sticks to their preferred shape and style, although there are increasingly more mass-produced designs to suit the majority (such as Bentfish, Britbat, CanAm, Dorsal, Stingray etc.).

===Puck===

The puck is approximately the size of an ice hockey puck but is made of lead or lead-based material - (adult size weighs , junior ) - and is encapsulated or surrounded by a plastic covering which is usually performance-matched to different pool bottoms (e.g. tiles, concrete etc.) to facilitate good grip on the stick face while preventing excessive friction on the pool bottom. The puck&#x27;s weight brings it to rest on the pool bottom, though it can be lofted during passes.

===Caps===

Safety gear includes ear protection, usually in the form of a water polo cap and as a secondary indicator of the player&#x27;s team (coloured black/dark or white/pale as appropriate). Water referees wear red caps.

===Glove===

A glove should be worn on the playing hand to protect against pool-bottom abrasion and, in some designs, for protection against puck impact on knuckles and other vulnerable areas, however no rigid protection is permitted. Players may choose to wear a protective glove on both hands, either as additional protection from the pool bottom or, for ambidextrous players, to switch the stick between hands mid-play. A glove used in competition must be a contrasting colour to the wearer&#x27;s stick, but not orange which is reserved for referees&#x27; gloves - this is so water referees might be able to better distinguish between a pusher making a legal contact with the puck and a hand making an illegal contact with the puck. It is also usually preferred that a players glove is a different colour to the puck. As the puck is usually pink or orange it means players should avoid gloves coloured black, white, red, orange, yellow and pink. A referee at any match or tournament can ask a player to use different kit before they play, hence players should be careful when choosing the colour of their gloves. Blue is often used due to the limitations on glove colours, but others have also been used.

===Goal===

The goals (or &#x27;gulleys&#x27;) are wide and are sited on the pool bottom at opposite ends of the playing area in the centre of the end lines. They consist of a shallow slope leading up to a trough into which the puck may be pushed or flicked.

Goals are commonly constructed from aluminium, galvanised steel or stainless steel. This makes them negatively buoyant and durable in the chlorinated water of swimming pools.

==Referees==
Officiating the game are two (or three) water referees (i.e. in the pool with full snorkelling gear, and wearing a distinctive red cap, orange gloves and golden yellow shirt) to observe and referee play at the pool bottom, and one or more poolside deck referees to track time (both playing times and penalty times for penalised players), maintain the score, and call fouls (such as excessive number of players in play, failure to start a point from the end of the playing area, or another foul capable of being committed at or noticed from the surface). The deck (chief) referee responds to hand signals given by the water referees to start and stop play, including after an interruption such as a foul or time-out, or indeed to stop play if they themself see a rule infringement.

The Official Rules, which are available for download in PDF form without charge, define (with illustrations) a valid goal, the fouls and signals, the dimensions of the playing area, sticks, and goals, team composition and substitution procedure, and additional rules and arrangements for multi-team tournaments and championships.

==Spectators==
At a club or training level, underwater hockey is not seen as particularly spectator-friendly. Very few pools have underwater viewing ports, and since the action is all below the surface, an observer would usually have to enter the water to see the skill and complexities of the game. Spectators may either put on mask, fins and snorkel and enter the pool for a view of the playing area, or possibly take advantage of the work of underwater videographers who have recorded major tournaments. Such tournaments often have live footage on large screens for the spectators. The 2006 (Sheffield, England) and 2010 (Durban, South Africa) Underwater Hockey World Championships were screened poolside and simultaneously webcast live to spectators around the world, while the 2008 European Championship in Istanbul, Turkey had excellent video coverage but no live streaming.

Filming the games is challenging even for the experienced videographer, as the players&#x27; movements are fast and there are few places on the surface or beneath it which are free from their seemingly frenzied movements. Games are often played width-wise across a 50-metre pool to provide spaces in between simultaneous games for player substitutes, penalty boxes, coaches and camera crews. However, research and development of filming techniques is ongoing.

Organisers of major tournaments are usually the point of contact for acquiring footage of underwater hockey matches. Although no official worldwide repository exists for recorded games, there are websites and instructional DVDs. A variety of related footage can be found on video sharing sites.

==Injuries==

Although it is a limited-contact sport, there is a significant risk of injury. Many injuries are typical sports injuries such as sprains, torn muscles and light scratches. More major injuries might include deeper cuts, broken fingers, impacts to the head causing concussion or dental trauma, and there is also a minor risk of life-threatening injury from being struck on the head with the possibility of a major concussion or blackout underwater. There is an obvious risk of drowning if knocked unconscious underwater, but the players are under observation by the referees during competition, and players in any case tend to be very aware of what their teammates are doing or not doing; in practice an unconscious or seriously injured player is likely to be noticed and assisted or rescued very promptly. Personal protective equipment is available to reduce injury risks, and the published rules make items such as gloves, mouth guards and ear guards mandatory. There is a risk of pulmonary capillary stress failure (Hemoptysis) in some players.

==International competition==
===World Championships===

The Underwater Hockey World Championships, organised by the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS), have been held every two years since 1980. The tournament began with a men&#x27;s competition only, with a women&#x27;s tournament added in 1982. 1992 saw the addition of a men&#x27;s master&#x27;s tournament with the women&#x27;s master&#x27;s tournament coming in 1998. 2002 saw a youth league trialled at the tournament with a full U-19 division for both men and women coming in 2004.

In 2007, CMAS attempted to start the CMAS World Games, an Olympic-style event for all the sports CMAS governed. This ultimately failed, however, as it required all the sports to move away from their pre-established calendars, resulting in the 2007 World Games being the only one ever played. This move also caused a schism, with the World Aquachallenge Association attempting to create their own World Championships, but again just one version ultimately took place (in 2008), with CMAS asserting control again with the 2009 Championships but in the case of elite competitions only. In 2013, master&#x27;s tournaments were again added and the youth tournaments became a separate event, involving U-23 divisions in addition to the U-19 division. Elite and master&#x27;s competitions reverted to even years in 2016 with the youth competition remaining on odd years. This switch following the resumption of international hockey after the COVID-19 pandemic began with the 2023 elite and master&#x27;s World Championships.

At Elite level, New Zealand are the current Men&#x27;s World Champions, and Australia are the current Women&#x27;s World Champions.

At Masters level, United States are the current Men&#x27;s World Champions, and France are the current Women&#x27;s World Champions.

At U-24 level, New Zealand are the current Men&#x27;s World Champions, and New Zealand are the current Women&#x27;s World Champions.

At U-19 level, New Zealand are the current Men&#x27;s World Champions, and Australia are the current Women&#x27;s World Champions.

===European Championships===

The Underwater Hockey European Championships, also ran by CMAS, are every two years on alternate years to the world championships. Unlike the world championships there are no masters or youth division.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no editions have been played since 2019 where Turkey won the men&#x27;s competition and France won the women&#x27;s competition.

===South East Asian Games===

Underwater Hockey was included as a sport for the first and only time in South East Asia Games in 2019.

===Celtic Cup===
The Celtic Cup was instituted in 2022 for the national teams of Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.

==Governing bodies==

Political turmoil within the CMAS Underwater Hockey Commission (Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques), the underwater hockey world governing body, came to a head soon after the 2006 Underwater Hockey World Championships, resulting in the CMAS Underwater Hockey Commission members resigning en masse and soon thereafter forming an alternative &#x27;world governing body&#x27; solely for the sport of UWH, known as the World Aquachallenge Association (WAA), and which was officially ratified at the 1st WAA World Championship in April–May 2008. Consequently, from this point the UWH community had two world governing bodies, CMAS and WAA.

CMAS has continued to organise international world competitions on a bi-annual basis. CMAS tried unsuccessfully to hold another World Underwater Games event in 2009 after a successful event in 2007. These were intended to be multi-disciplinary events thereby grouping UWH with other CMAS-represented sports including fin swimming and underwater rugby. The 1st World Games were held in Bari, Italy in 2007 while the 2nd was scheduled for Tunisia in 2009 but was cancelled and rescheduled as an UWH-only event held in Kranj, Slovenia during August 2009. It was billed as a World Championship but only one non-European country competed (South Africa); France won the Open division while Great Britain took the Women&#x27;s title. In the years in between World Games CMAS holds Zone Championships (e.g. the 15th European Championship in Eger, Hungary during 2017).

WAA attempted to continue with the original World Championship series on a biennial basis during years ending with an even number. The 1st WAA Championships (renumbered; it would have been the CMAS 15th) was held in 2008 in Durban, South Africa. The 2nd competition was scheduled for Medellin, Colombia in August 2010 but it proceeded as an International Event without WAA sanctioning and became the precursor for the development of the independent America&#x27;s Cup International Tournament.

The European (CMAS) and the rest of the World (WAA) events following the split were held over exactly the same period in 2008 a continent apart. This dichotomy of championships coupled with the real possibility of future sanctions by CMAS on their member countries&#x27; organisations and athletes led to many countries being forced to choose which competition to send their team to. As a result, neither competition in 2008 was as well attended as had been the case in previous years, nor as competitive. Subsequently, no WAA sanctioned events have taken place since 2008. However, in Europe at least, well-organised international tournaments without CMAS or WAA influence (such as at Breda in the Netherlands, Barcelona in Spain, or České Budějovice in the Czech Republic) continue to be regularly attended by a range of club teams from across the continent.

In 2009, a new CMAS Underwater Hockey Commission was appointed for a 4-year period to guide the sport on a technical level and gradually it has reconsolidated the sport and produced a development plan to cope with future growth. The commission continues to work to develop relationships with CMAS Board of Directors and obtain support for its development plan.

As part of this plan the Commission developed an Age Group-based International Championship incorporating Under 19, Under 23 and Masters (Men &gt;35, Women &gt;32) Grades. This Championship was held in July 2011 in Dordrecht, Netherlands. The event was to be sanctioned by CMAS but the Dutch organising team withdrew their hosting bid and proceeded to host the event successfully with 36 teams participating. As the event was non-compliant with the CMAS Competition procedures, Scotland was able to compete as a separate country rather than within a combined entity as Great Britain.

As the surviving governing body, as of August 2013 CMAS has the following countries and territories affiliated with its Underwater Hockey Commission: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, United States of America.

<text>Donald Cameron MacDonald (December 7, 1913 – March 8, 2008) was a Canadian politician. Referred to in the media as the &quot;best premier Ontario never had,&quot; he represented the provincial riding of York South in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1955 to 1982. From 1953 to 1970 he was the leader of the social democratic Ontario section of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and its successor, the Ontario New Democratic Party.

== Early life and career ==

MacDonald was born in Cranbrook, British Columbia, and moved with his family to Tullochgorum, Quebec in 1923 and then earned a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree from Queen&#x27;s University.
He supported the Conservative Party of Canada in his youth, but became a democratic socialist after witnessing the social problems of the Great Depression. He worked for several years as a teacher and journalist, and was employed by the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; in the mid-1930s.

== Armed forces service ==

MacDonald joined the Royal Canadian Navy in 1942, and served in Canada during World War II as secretary of a top-secret intelligence committee, the main responsibility of which was to transmit enemy submarine positions to the Royal Canadian Air Force. He later became editor of &quot;Canadian Digest&quot;, a magazine published by the military that provided a cross section of articles from Canadian periodicals and newspapers, and was the host of &quot;Serviceman&#x27;s Forum&quot;, a regular series of broadcasts on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that were also aired by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Members of the military and civilian experts discussed issues of concern in these broadcasts.

== Political life ==

===CCF involvement===

MacDonald joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) while serving in Ottawa, Ontario in 1942. In 1946, he joined the national CCF staff and travelled the country as a party organizer. He was a candidate in the August 1953 federal election for the British Columbia riding of Kootenay East, and finished a strong third against Liberal Jim Byrne with 28% of the vote. He was persuaded to run for the Ontario CCF leadership later in the same year, and defeated Fred Young and Andrew Brewin for the position.

===Leading the party===
MacDonald took over the party in the middle of the Cold War and at the height of McCarthyism, when socialism was viewed with suspicion. The CCF had almost won power in Ontario ten years earlier, winning 34 seats in the 1943 provincial election, but by the time MacDonald became leader it held only two seats in the legislature. MacDonald was himself without a seat until the 1955 provincial election, when he defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent William Beech by 1,426 votes in York South. His victory increased the CCF&#x27;s legislative standing to three seats, and MacDonald quickly became known as one of the most vocal members of the legislature. He fought for issues such as prison reform and universal public healthcare, and emphasised pragmatism over doctrinaire socialism as he tried to appeal to voters as a moderate reformer. Some Toronto newspapers described him as the &quot;de facto&quot; opposition leader against Leslie Frost&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government. His pursuit of the Northern Ontario Natural Gas scandal led to the resignation of three members of Frost&#x27;s cabinet.

MacDonald slowly rebuilt the party during his tenure as leader, and provided it with a benevolent public face. The CCF grew to five seats in the 1959 provincial election. Following the founding of the federal New Democratic Party in 1961, he was acclaimed as the first leader of the Ontario NDP in October 1961. The new party won seven seats in the 1963 election, and MacDonald later expressed disappointment that a larger breakthrough did not occur.

As the province&#x27;s population became more urban and as social issues came to the forefront of political discussion, the NDP had a major breakthrough in the 1967 election rising from seven seats to 20. This new success led to increasing pressure for new leadership, as the party was seen as a potential victor and many activists felt a younger leader was needed to catch the mood of the times. Jim Renwick challenged MacDonald for the party leadership in 1968, but lost. In 1970, Stephen Lewis was able to marshall support among the Steelworkers union with which his family had strong links. (His father, David Lewis, had represented the steelworkers as a labour lawyer for many years.) MacDonald decided not to seek re-election as leader in order to avoid a divisive fight. At the leadership convention that fall, Stephen Lewis defeated Walter Pitman and succeeded MacDonald as Ontario NDP leader.

===1970 stepping away from leadership===
MacDonald was officially neutral in the 1970 leadership contest, but tacitly favoured Pitman. In his autobiography, MacDonald notes that he was initially skeptical about the younger Lewis&#x27;s leadership abilities, and believed that his election &quot;fitted conveniently into the Tory plans&quot; for the next election. The Progressive Conservative government was able to rally business support by depicting Lewis as dangerously left-wing, and the NDP did not gain seats in the 1971 election. MacDonald has also argued that the party&#x27;s breakthrough under Lewis in the 1975 election was made possible by Lewis&#x27;s decision to moderate his more strident views.

At the federal level, MacDonald attended the 1971 NDP Federal Leadership Convention and ran for party president. The 1960s youth-quake was moving into federal politics, and a group of New Left academics and activists called The Waffle presented the fiercest opposition to MacDonald and other &quot;establishment&quot; members. He was up against Carol Gudmundson — of the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan Waffle — in the battle for the party presidency. With the help of the union delegations, and the party&#x27;s establishment, MacDonald was victorious on April 23, 1971 and became the president during the same convention that saw Tommy Douglas pass the leadership torch on to David Lewis. He got 885 votes to Gudmundson&#x27;s 565, and started the trend that day that saw Waffle candidates getting defeated at almost every federal council and executive position.

===Retiring from York South and beyond===
MacDonald supported Ian Deans&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to replace Lewis as party leader in 1978, and helped to draft Bob Rae for the leadership in 1982. He then resigned as an MPP in 1982, to give Rae an opportunity to enter the legislature. MacDonald served as chair of the NDP caucus from 1982 to 1985, and was chair of the Ontario Election Finances Commission from 1986 to 1994.

MacDonald&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Happy Warrior: Political Memoirs&quot;, was published in 1988 and the second edition in 1998, to add the Rae years as the first NDP Ontario government.

He became a Member of the Order of Canada in 2003 and also holds an Order of Ontario.

===Paul Ferreira===
By the early 2000s, the NDP was near the bottom of their decline in MacDonald&#x27;s home riding. Rae had held the riding for 14 years before it fell to the Liberals in 1996. The riding&#x27;s name was changed to York South—Weston for the 1999 provincial election and it became a much larger riding than it was when he represented it.

In 2004, MacDonald supported a young NDP Provincial Executive member named Paul Ferreira in his campaign to be the area&#x27;s MPP. Ferreira would raise the NDP&#x27;s vote substantially from 3.7% to over 21%. While not good enough for a win, it allowed him to eventually, after four elections in two and half years, win the seat February 8, 2007. Donald MacDonald supported him through all these campaigns and was there to publicly congratulate Ferreira and pass on the generational torch at the victory party.

==Death==
MacDonald died in 2008 of heart failure at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. He was 94.

As with so many traditional dances in England and Europe, these characters are integral to the tradition, and their role was documented in all of the earliest published descriptions of the Northumbrian dance – descriptions which pre-date the introduction of the flexible rapper sword which so fundamentally changed the dance.

In early accounts of the sword dance in the Tyne Valley, the Tommy character was generally called &quot;The Captain&quot;, and the Betty character called &quot;Bessy&quot;. There were often additional characters, such as a doctor, who took part in a short play before the dance, similar to a Mummers play. The Tommy was either dressed up formally, with waistcoat, tailcoat and top hat, or in a grotesque garb of animal hides; occasionally, the Tommy was dressed in women&#x27;s clothing, like the Betty. Much is made of their role and clothing in the context of pagan fertility rituals; it is certainly probable that the characters and play are older than the sword dance itself, which would appear to have been appended to the older play tradition found all over England. 

In the modern dance, the Tommy introduces the dancers, usually with a traditional calling-on song, and then provides a running commentary and/or jokes to entertain the audience. The Tommy and Betty characters often join in with the rapper figures. 

The best known Tommy and Betty characters are probably the Newcastle Kingsmen&#x27;s characters, who have won the prize for best characters at several of the annual DERT competitions, including the national DERT 2004 and 2005 competitions. 

The Newcastle Kingsmen&#x27;s dance begins with the Tommy character singing the &quot;Calling On Song&quot;. The Betty character then joins in halfway through the dance - this delayed entrance (which is unusual in rapper sword teams) allows time for the Tommy to work through a repertoire of jokes, before the appearance of the Betty. The Betty seeks to have a high profile entrance such as appearing through a trap door, on a bicycle or carrying a vacuum cleaner. This entrance can help re-engage the audience; this is particularly valuable in large arenas or at foreign festivals.

<doc id="488015" wikidata="Q267471" url="?curid=488015" title="Yumi Matsutoya">
<text>, nicknamed , is a Japanese singer, composer, lyricist and pianist. Generally the writer of both the lyrics and the music in her songs, she is renowned for her idiosyncratic voice and live performances, and is one of the most prominent figures in the history of Japanese popular music.

Her recording career has been commercially successful with more than 42 million records sold. In 1990, her album &quot;The Gates of Heaven&quot; became the first album to be certified &quot;2x million&quot; by the RIAJ, and she has had twenty-one No. 1 albums listed on the Oricon charts. She is the only artist to have at least one number-one album every year on the Oricon charts for 18 consecutive years.

After gaining several years of experience as a session musician, she debuted as a singer-songwriter in 1972. During her early career, she worked under her birth name . In 1975, Arai became known as a composer for &quot;&quot;Ichigo Hakusho&quot; wo Mou Ichido&quot;, a commercially successful song recorded by the folk duo BanBan. She also gained popularity as a vocalist in the same year through the success of &quot;Ano Hi ni Kaeritai&quot;, which became her first number-one hit on Japan&#x27;s Oricon Charts. Other famous songs include &quot;Haru-yo, Koi&quot; and &quot;Sweet, Bitter Sweet&quot;.

She also uses the name Kureta Karuho (), which is derived from the Swedish film star Greta Garbo, when offering her work to other musicians. 

In &quot;The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture&quot;, it is written that &quot;Yuming incorporated influences from progressive rock and European pop to produce a sophisticated, upper-middle-class female Japanese voice and sound in a contemporary musical and journalistic world dominated by discussions of folk music and social critique. This musical idiom is generally thought to have been first realised on [...] &quot;Cobalt Hour&quot;&quot;. The album &quot;The 14th Moon&quot; and the three albums that ranked in the top 10 of the Japanese charts in 1976 (&quot;Cobalt Hour&quot;, &quot;Yuming Brand&quot;, and &quot;Hikōki-gumo&quot;) &quot;contained several songs which are considered to be early classics of the J-pop genre.&quot;

After marrying her musical collaborator Masataka Matsutoya in 1976, Arai began recording under her married name and has continued to do so. Throughout the 1980s, Matsutoya&#x27;s music was prominently featured in advertisements for Mitsubishi Motors in her native Japan and her image was used to promote their vehicles. In addition to multiple hit singles, she has obtained enormous commercial success on the Japanese Albums Chart, particularly during the late 1980s and the first half of the 1990s.

The magazine &quot;Shūkan Gendai&quot; ranked Matsutoya third (behind only Miyuki Nakajima and Masayoshi Son) in a list of the smartest Japanese figures that was determined based on the criteria of &quot;intelligence, determination, sensibility and capability&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Yumi Arai was born in 1954 in Hachiōji, Tokyo. She had three brothers and one sister, and her family ran a draper shop called Arai Gofukuten, established in 1912. When she was a junior high school student, she used to go to an Italian restaurant called Chianti, which had opened in 1960. In those days, many celebrities went to the restaurant; Akira Kurosawa, Yukio Mishima, Kōbō Abe, Seiji Ozawa, Ryu Murakami, Taro Okamoto, Kishin Shinoyama, and Hiroshi &quot;Monsieur&quot; Kamayatsu, who eventually became her first record producer. Alfa Music, the publishing company to which she belonged early her in career (later to become a full-fledged record label in 1977), was founded by people who were regular customers at Chianti.

Her nickname &quot;Yuming&quot; was given to her by Sy Chen (シー・ユー・チェン), a Chinese bassist she had a crush on when she was 13 years old. She began her music career when she was still young. At the age of 14, she worked as a musician for the first time. Having worked as a studio musician, she also wrote many original songs. When she was 17 years old, her first original song titled &quot;Ai wa Totsuzen ni&quot; was released. It was sung by Katsumi Kahashi, the former guitarist of the influential 1960s Japanese band The Tigers.

In April 1972, Arai entered Tama Art University. At the same time, she signed with then-publishing company Alfa as a music artist. At first, she wanted to be a songwriter. However, the founder of the publishing company, Kunihiko Murai, encouraged her to work as a singer-songwriter.

===Music career===

====Early career; works as Yumi Arai====
On July 5, 1972, Arai released her debut single &quot;Henji wa Iranai&quot;. It was produced by Hiroshi &quot;Monsieur&quot; Kamayatsu, the former vocalist of The Spiders. Released by Toshiba EMI, the label to which she would be affiliated and release all her albums throughout her career, under its Liberty sublabel (with Alfa acting as publishing company), her first single sold only 300 copies. (It would later feature in re-recorded form on her debut LP, &quot;Hikō-ki Gumo&quot;.)

She recorded her first full album, &quot;Hikō-ki Gumo&quot;, with the band Caramel Mama, better known as Tin Pan Alley, which consisted of Haruomi Hosono, Shigeru Suzuki, Tateo Hayashi and Masataka Matsutoya, and it was released by Toshiba EMI under its Express sublabel in November 1973; the title track (and lead-off track) was later used as the theme song for the movie &quot;The Wind Rises&quot; (2013). For her next album, &quot;MISSLIM&quot;, (1974), Masataka Matsutoya, who was the keyboardist of Tin Pan Alley, arranged all of her songs. Her third studio album, &quot;Cobalt Hour&quot; (1975), features her early famous song &quot;Sotsugyō Shashin&quot;. The same year, it was covered by the chorus group Hi-Fi Set (who also performed on the original song) on their first album with the same name. That cover version also succeeded as a single. In later years, it was covered by many Japanese artists and became one of Japan&#x27;s classic pop songs. The same year, the male folk duo BanBan recorded her song &quot;Ichigo Hakusho o Mou Ichido&quot; and reached number one on the Oricon chart. Because of the commercial success of other artists, she became famous as a songwriter.

Yumi achieved moderate success with her fifth single, &quot;Rouge no Dengon&quot; (&quot;Rouge Message&quot;), an up-tempo song considered to be a proto &quot;J-Pop&quot; classic. She gained a television appearance singing this song with the top Japanese girl group of the time, &quot;Candies&quot;, and the song has been covered by a number of artists over the years.

Her first top hit as a singer-songwriter was her sixth single &quot;Ano Hi ni Kaeritai&quot;. In August 1975, it was used as the theme song for the TBS TV drama &quot;Katei no Himitsu&quot;. Two months later, it was released as a single and reached the top of the Oricon chart. &quot;The 14th Moon&quot; (1976), her final album as Yumi Arai, featured Leland Sklar on bass and Mike Baird on drums. Since this album, Masataka Matsutoya has produced all her albums himself. She considers her nickname &quot;Yuming&quot; to also mean the name of the union with her husband. Following the success with &quot;Ano Hi ni Kaeritai&quot;, it became her first album to reach number one on the Oricon chart. Besides, in the end of the year chart in 1976, three of her albums (&quot;Cobalt Hour&quot;, &quot;Yuming Brand&quot;, and &quot;Hikō-ki Gumo&quot;) ranked in the top 10. Four years after her debut, she dominated the Japanese album charts. This astonishing record has never been broken by anyone since.

In 1989, her fifth single, &quot;Rouge no Dengon&quot; (from her third album), and third single, &quot;Yasashisa ni Tsutsumaretanara&quot; (the version used was from her second album), were featured as the theme songs of the film &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;. Nowadays, those tunes are known as her early notable songs. Some of her songs were deeply influenced by many American and European musicians, such as Joni Mitchell and Carole King. As a pioneering singer-songwriter who mixed Western culture and Japanese pop, she left a strong impression on Japanese popular music.

====Works as Yumi Matsutoya====
After marrying Masataka Matsutoya on November 29, 1976, she had considered retirement. But eventually she decided to continue to work as a musician, performing under her married name. In 1978, her memorable first album as Yumi Matsutoya, entitled &quot;Benisuzume&quot; was released. In the late 1970s and early 80s, she released two albums every year. However, those albums were less successful than the ones she released when she was single. Nevertheless, she wrote several of her well-known songs during those years, and her albums reached the top 10 on the Oricon chart.

Before the release of &quot;Benisuzume&quot;, a compilation named &quot;Album&quot; was released by Toshiba EMI. It mainly contained songs she had released as Yumi Arai, and two songs released as singles only. Matsutoya didn&#x27;t want to release this compilation; in her autobiography released in 1982, she writes about this album and calls it &quot;The biggest stain on my music career.&quot; Because of this, she never allowed the release of another compilation album until 1998. However, her ex-record-label-and-publishing-company Alfa Records had, after 1977 (when Alfa finally established itself as an independent record label), released many compilations which consisted of her old tunes without her permission. Hence, in the late 1990s, she bought the copyrights of all her songs that she had written under her maiden name; helping in this decision was the fact that Toshiba EMI had by then regained control, in 1994, of the Alfa catalogue, including the albums released by Toshiba EMI while Alfa was still a publishing company, thus her early catalogue being spared of Alfa&#x27;s 2001 sale to Sony after Alfa faced financial difficulties.

Her tenth album, &quot;Surf and Snow&quot; (1980), changed the negative tide for her. When the album was released, it did not sell as well as others had previously. However, in 1986, &quot;Koibito ga Santa Claus&quot; became popular as the theme song for the hit movie . The album eventually sold over 400,000 copies. In 1981, she returned to the top of Japanese pop music. Her husband wrote the score for the movie &quot;Nerawareta Gakuen&quot;, which was directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi and distributed by Kadokawa Pictures. She wrote &quot;Mamotte Agetai&quot; as the theme song for the movie. The single of this song reached number two on Oricon and sold nearly 700,000 copies. Following the success of the single, her eleventh album &quot;Sakuban Oaishimasho&quot; (1981) became her second number one album. From that year through 1997, 17 consecutive studio albums she released reached number one on the Oricon charts.

Ian Martin of &quot;The Japan Times&quot; wrote in 2016, &quot;At the same time she was contributing to Matsuda&#x27;s record-breaking run of No. 1 hit singles, Matsutoya’s own work retained an almost militant focus on albums, and the balance she struck between commercial success and artistic integrity is a source of inspiration to many aspiring musicians.&quot;

In 1982, she published an autobiography, &quot;Rouge no Dengon&quot;. In this book, she wrote about her life in an exaggerated style. She contemplated doing the artwork on her own albums. The artwork of the album &quot;Sakuban Oaishimasho&quot; (1981) was designed by Hipgnosis, and the video &quot;Compartment&quot; was produced by Storm Thorgerson, Aubrey Powell and Peter Christopherson. A logo design from the latter film also became the logo of &quot;Yuming&quot;, and was used as the cover of the 1984 album &quot;No Side&quot;. Aubrey Powell and Richard Evans of Hipgnosis also designed the cover of the 1983 album &quot;Voyager&quot;. Since the 1970s, she has also been famous as an artist who performs in concerts using gorgeous and novel sets. She used elaborate visual technology on the stage and it is said that they cost over a hundred million yen. She has released two live albums and several videos. In 1986, she released her first live album, &quot;Yuming Visualive DA-DI-DA,&quot;. It was released on CD and cassette tape only, and it became one of the rarest items among her fans for many years.

====Commercial peak and decline====
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, her albums consisted of mechanical sounds which featured synclavier. In addition, they were recorded by a lot of famous West Coast musicians. However, in later years, Masataka Matsutoya, her record producer and husband, regretted the cheap rhythm section on those albums. &quot;Before the Diamond Dust Fades...&quot; (1987) sold more than any of her albums at that time. In the late 1980s, her record sales increased. &quot;Delight Slight Light KISS&quot; (1988) became the first million-selling record for her. From this album in 1995 to the album &quot;Kathmandu&quot;, she released eight studio albums and all of them sold over million copies. Above all, two of those albums, &quot;The Gates of Heaven&quot; (1990), and &quot;The Dancing Sun&quot; (1994), sold over double-million copies. The former is the first double million-selling album in Japan. &quot;Dawn Purple&quot; (1991) sold over a million copies in one week after the album&#x27;s release. Her record sales were appraised by the Japanese music industry. &quot;Before the Diamond Dust Fades...&quot; won Japan Record Awards of 1988 and &quot;The Gates of Heaven&quot; won a Japanese gold disc grand prix of 1991.

&quot;The Gates of Heaven&quot; and several of her albums in those years reflected an optimistic atmosphere in Japan caused by the asset price bubble around the end of the 1980s and early 1990s. She was often called &quot;Charisma of Youth&quot; or &quot;The Enthusiastic Leader of Love&quot; in those days. After hearing from her record company Toshiba-EMI that single sales were quickly overtaking album sales due to a slowing economy, Matsutoya decided to make a difference. To make people buy the album, she did not release any physical singles at all for about four years in the early 1990s, although she did promote songs from her albums to radio as &quot;album cuts&quot;. Her albums &quot;The Gates of Heaven&quot; (1990), &quot;Dawn Purple&quot; (1991) and &quot;Tears And Reasons&quot; (1992) performed very well on the Oricon charts, boosted partially by airplay. However, in autumn 1993, she released &quot;Manatsu no Yo no Yume&quot;, the first physical single in four years since &quot;Anniversary&quot;, already known as the theme song of the TV drama &quot;Dare nimo Ienai&quot;. It sold over 1,400,000 copies and became the 89th best-selling single in Japan. It is her most successful single.

The next year, she produced the two-million-selling singles called &quot;Hello,My Friend&quot; and &quot;Haru-yo, Koi&quot;. Both of these singles were used in TV dramas (the former was featured on &quot;Kimi to Ita Natsu&quot;, the latter was used on the same titled program broadcast by NHK). The latter in particular is famous as one of her standard numbers. Those songs were also included on the album &quot;The Dancing Sun&quot;, which became her second double million-selling album on the strength of those popular tunes. That same year, the equity ratio of her record company (which was originally established by Toshiba Corporation in 1960 as Toshiba Musical Industries, and then renamed Toshiba-EMI when Toshiba sold 50% of the company to the British EMI Group in 1973) was changed, with EMI now owning a 55% stake in the company, while Toshiba owned the remaining 45% stake in the company.
She was interested in the spiritual world for many years, and this preference was often represented in her songs, a tendency that became deeper in the 1990s.

In August 1996, about twenty years after her marriage, Yumi Matsutoya came back as Yumi Arai and performed three days at Nakano Sunplaza, Tokyo. Excerpts of that live recording were released on video and CD. A month before the live performances, a newly recorded version of her early standard song, &quot;Machibuse&quot; (she did not sing it herself), was released as a single. Until 1995, she had released studio albums every year, but her popularity began to decline around 1996. After her twenty-ninth studio album, &quot;The Waves of Zuvuya&quot;, (1997) her record sale declined more and more.

As &quot;Yumi Matsutoya&quot;, she had not released any compilation albums since 1977. Formerly, she didn&#x27;t want to release compilation albums. However, in 1998, she released a double album compilation, &quot;Neue Musik: Yumi Matsutoya Complete Best Vol. 1&quot;. It included 28 songs and two new songs recorded with the former members of Tin-Pan-Alley. In addition, several songs of this album were selected by votes by her fans. At this stage, it is her biggest-selling and final four million-selling album.

====Recent years====
After the release of her well-sold compilation album, she declared that she would make the music she wants to. From 1999 on, she has released eight studio albums.

On June 30, 2007, Toshiba Corporation sold its remaining 45% stake in Matsutoya&#x27;s record label to EMI and gave EMI full ownership of the company. The label&#x27;s name was then changed from Toshiba-EMI to EMI Music Japan to reflect Toshiba&#x27;s divestiture from the business. In September 2012, the British EMI group was broken up and sold to various companies. On April 1, 2013, EMI Music Japan was absorbed into Universal Music Japan, became defunct as a company and was renamed to EMI Records Japan. Therefore, all of Matsutoya&#x27;s further releases will be through Universal Music Japan.

In 2013, it was announced that Matsutoya&#x27;s song &quot;Hikouki Gumo&quot;, would be used as the closing theme to the Studio Ghibli film &quot;The Wind Rises (Kaze Tachinu)&quot;.

====Awards and honors====
Matsutoya was decorated with the Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon in the 2013 spring honors list, released on April 29. The medal is in recognition of artistic, academic or athletic contributions.

==Production works==
===Songwriter===
As a songwriter and lyricist, Yumi Matsutoya wrote hundreds of songs for Hi-Fi Set, Asami Kobayashi, Kenji Sawada, Hiromi Gō, Toshihiko Tahara, Reimy and many other artists. Some of them became big hits, such as &quot;Ichigo Hakusho o Mou Ichido&quot; (Performed by Banban, 1975) and &quot;Machibuse&quot; (Performed by Seiko Miki, Hitomi Ishikawa, originally released in 1975). Many of her hit tunes were sung by idol singer Seiko Matsuda. Several songs sung by Matsuda reached number one on the Oricon singles chart, including &quot;Akai Sweet Pea&quot;, &quot;Nagisa no Balcony&quot; (1982) and &quot;Hitomi wa Diamond&quot; (1986). These singles are some of Matsuda&#x27;s best-known songs. Matsutoya has collaborated with many songwriters and lyricists, among them Yosui Inoue, Takashi Matsumoto, Kōki Mitani, , Shizuka Ijuin. She also co-wrote the Japanese lyrics to the Lynsey de Paul and Barry Blue penned song Sugar Shuffle with Asami Kobayashi, which appeared on Kobayashi&#x27;s Cryptograph album in 1984. When she writes songs for other musicians, she often uses the pseudonym . It is a parody on the name of Greta Garbo.

===Collaboration with other artists===
On her early albums, several famous 1970s Japanese singer-songwriters who had not yet succeeded at that time sang as the backing vocalists; Tatsuro Yamashita, Taeko Onuki, Akiko Yano and Minako Yoshida. Yamashita usually arranged the chorus parts of her songs in the &#x27;70s. But in later years, he criticized her late 1980s music career in his own song called &quot;Queen of Hype Blues&quot;. In her career spanning more than 30 years, Matsutoya has sung duets with many singers; including Takao Kisugi, Toshinobu Kubota, Masumi Okada, and Takao Tajima.

She has also recorded several collaboration singles with other musicians. In 1985, she released the song &quot;Imadakara&quot; with Kazumasa Oda and Kazuo Zaitsu. It was mostly composed by Oda and Matsutoya, arranged by Ryuichi Sakamoto and played by former Sadistic Mika Band members. At the live event performed in June the same year, having added Matsutoya as vocalist, the band reunited as &quot;Sadistic Yuming Band&quot; and performed this song.

In 1986, Matsutoya co-wrote &quot;Kissin&#x27; Christmas&quot;, a theme song for a TV program, with Keisuke Kuwata, the leader of Southern All Stars. Appearing only on TV, this song was a collaboration by two of the most successful Japanese songwriters. However, the song has never been released on any format.

In 1992, Matsutoya and Karl Smokey Ishii cooperated for the single &quot;Ai no Wave&quot;. She wrote it and the B-Side &quot;Roman no Dengon&quot; with him. The same year, Ishii had released &quot;Kimi ga Irudake de&quot;, the fifth best-selling single in Japan. Therefore, the single climbed to the top of the hit parade naturally. The title of &quot;Roman no Gengon&quot; was self-parody of their songs; it was named under Matsutoya&#x27;s &quot;Rouge no Dengon&quot; and Kome Kome Club&#x27;s &quot;Roman Hikou&quot;.

When her popularity quickly declined at the end of the 1990s, she recorded a song with the popular group Pocket Biscuits. They collaborated on the single &quot;Millennium&quot; in 2000, but it did not achieve the expected success.

In 2002, she penned the song &quot;Koi no Signal&quot; for the group Coming Century, a sub-unit of the popular boyband V6. Compared to other Coming Century songs of the time, the lyrics for the song were more heartfelt and optimistic.

In 2005, Matsutoya formed the group called &quot;Yumi Matsutoya and Friends of Love the Earth&quot; with four East Asian artists; Dick Lee from Singapore, Lim Hyung Joo from South Korea, amin and Xu Ke from China. 
Matsutoya wrote the song &quot;Smile Again&quot; for the new group, and it was released on iTMS only. When Matsutoya appeared at the Expo 2005 concert in September of the same year, they appeared as guests and sang this song. On New Year&#x27;s Eve the same year, they appeared in the Japanese traditional annual TV music program &quot;Kohaku Uta Gassen&quot;, and performed &quot;Smile Again&quot;. The next year, Matsutoya re-recorded the song and released it on her album &quot;A Girl in Summer&quot;. In autumn of 2006, this unit added more members. They had only one concert and released the new single &quot;Knockin&#x27; at the Door&quot; on CD.

In 2006, she wrote a song &quot;Still Crazy for You&quot; for Crazy Cats, a Japanese comedy team popular in the late 1950s and 1960s, and sang a duet with the vocalist Kei Tani. It was released as the group&#x27;s first new single since 1986, and climbed to No. 14 on the Oricon chart. It was the highest chart position they have ever reached.

In 2012 Yumi came to London to record &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; with Procol Harum, a band she considered an inspiration for her work. She sang a duet with Gary Brooker on this new version of the 1967 classic, which featured three verses and a guitar solo by Geoff Whitehorn. Yumi and Procol Harum then played a series of December concerts in major Japanese cities, one of which was recorded for a later television showing.

<text>Susan Ivanova () is a lead fictional character in the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, played by Claudia Christian.

==Character overview==
Susan Ivanova holds the rank of lieutenant commander during the first season and is promoted to the rank of commander in the second season. From the first through the fourth seasons of the series, Commander Ivanova was the first officer (XO) of the Babylon 5 space station. After the fourth season of the series, she was promoted to captain and given command of a new class of Earth Alliance warship, the &quot;Warlock-Class&quot;. She accepted the promotion because of the tragic events that happened on Babylon 5 at the very end of the Earth Alliance Civil War, in which she played a major role, including the death of Marcus Cole, who sacrificed his own life for hers. During the fifth and final season, she appears only once, in the series&#x27; final episode, holding the rank of general – a position for which she showed little enthusiasm for. She ultimately ends up as the new leader of the Anla&#x27;shok at the insistence of Delenn.

==Character description==
===Overview===
Like many of the show&#x27;s characters, Susan Ivanova seemed locked in a tragic cycle. The particular millstone around Ivanova&#x27;s neck was love – not only romantic, but familial as well. Deep down, she believes that &quot;all love is unrequited&quot;, perhaps believing that she is undeserving of true happiness. However, in spite of her troubled relationships with her mother, father, brother, and others, she is also fiercely loyal and caring about those to whom she is close. Given her troubled background, she also possesses a surprisingly good sense of humor, which often comes out at odd moments. She has a hot temper and this often leads other crew members to give her a wide berth whenever she is angry. She also possesses a strong sense of integrity and honesty. As a military leader she is brave to the point of recklessness, has the ability to think and act quickly in a crisis, and she can be creative and original in coming up with ways to resolve any situation she finds herself in.

While most of the major Earthforce characters have flown combat missions against raider fighters, Susan Ivanova is &quot;the one most consistently on the front lines of battle. She chases raiders and single-handedly destroys a small fleet&quot;, although other commentators note that she fires without a warning in &quot;Believers&quot; prompting author Andy Lane to ask, &quot;Is this standard Earthforce procedure -- shoot first and ask questions afterwards?&quot;

===Early life and career===
Susan Ivanova was born in St. Petersburg, Russian Consortium, in 2230. Her mother, Sophie, is established to have committed suicide when Susan was a child, which Ivanova blames on the Psi Corps. Sophie was a telepath who refused to join the Psi Corps and, as a result, was forced to take telepathy-inhibiting drugs regularly. The powerful depressant effect of these drugs gradually drained her energy and eventually led her to take her own life. Susan Ivanova eventually reveals that she is a latent telepath herself and lives in fear of discovery by the Psi Corps. She harbors a lasting grudge against the Psi Corps throughout the show, and blames them for the death of her mother. Her beloved brother, Ganya, died during the Earth-Minbari War, a piece of backstory set 10 years before the show. He was a fighter pilot aboard the Earth Alliance warship &quot;Lexington&quot; and was killed in the battle with the &quot;Black Star&quot;, the Minbari&#x27;s flagship. Due to her telepathic abilities, she was able to sense her brother&#x27;s death despite the vast distance between them. She also did not have a good relationship with her father, Andrei, who became irritable and emotionally distant after her mother&#x27;s death. In a first-season episode her father dies on Earth. She reconciles with him and forgives him before his death.

Over the course of the series Ivanova has two major notable interests. The first, with telepath Talia Winters, is non-sexual and largely implied, though after Talia is revealed as an unwilling sleeper agent and her subsequent departure from Babylon 5, Ivanova admits to possibly loving her. In the first season her relationship with Winters gets off to a rocky start, and her inherent distrust of anyone in Psi Corps leads Ivanova to behave rudely towards Talia. However, they eventually become friends. Ivanova is clearly hurt by the revelation that Talia is actually a &quot;sleeper&quot; Psi Corps agent who had been sent to spy on the command staff of Babylon 5. The second relationship, with Marcus Cole, also starts off badly, as Ivanova regards Marcus as reckless and annoying. However, they eventually become uneasy friends, and when he sacrifices his life to save hers at the end of the fourth season, Ivanova is devastated. She tells Dr. Franklin, B5&#x27;s medical chief and a close friend, that &quot;all love is unrequited&quot;, and wishes that she had returned his love and affection instead of being so sarcastic with him. The death of Marcus leads her to leave Babylon 5 and become captain of the newly commissioned &quot;Warlock&quot; class destroyer EAS &quot;Titans&quot;.

&quot;Babylon 5&quot; creator Joe Straczynski often spoke of Ivanova&#x27;s supposedly &quot;Russian&quot; temperament and character. His comments, as well as Ivanova&#x27;s own quips, hint that her world view may have been shaped by the history of the Russian people. In the future Earth shown on Babylon 5, the Russian people have united in a consortium and are clearly an important power on Earth. Yet, if Ivanova is any example, they remember vividly more difficult times under czars and communism. Although she is not openly religious, Ivanova is established as ethnically Jewish when she sits Shiva after her father&#x27;s death in season one, and is seen also lighting a menorah. An old friend of her family, a man she refers to as &quot;uncle&quot; who is a rabbi, visits her after her father&#x27;s death and she comes to accept her faith, if only in private. She does appear to have a belief in God, and she occasionally &quot;talks&quot; to God (in a rather joking manner) under her breath in a few episodes of the series. However, she keeps other aspects of her religious beliefs largely to herself, such as how strictly she follows the Jewish dietary laws, since in the episode &quot;Messages from Earth&quot;, Marcus procures a freshly prepared plate of bacon and eggs for her as a surprise to which she does not overtly object; bacon being generally avoided by observant Jews as it comes from pigs, which are specifically listed in the Torah as an unclean animal, and thus not kosher.

Ivanova is promoted several times during the series. She starts as a lieutenant commander, and is promoted to full commander in the second season. At the end of the fourth season, she is made captain. In &quot;Sleeping in Light&quot; (the series finale, set 18 years after the events of the fifth season), it is revealed that she is a general. She retires from Earth Force in this episode and becomes &quot;Ranger One&quot;, the head of the Rangers.

===Relationships===
Throughout her character arc in &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, Ivanova is involved in a series of relationships, during season one, an old flame, Malcolm Biggs comes to Babylon 5 eight years after their relationship ends to start a &#x27;business&#x27; and rekindle his relationship with Ivanova, before she realizes he is an agent of the xenophobic Homeguard in the episode &quot;The War Prayer&quot;.

All of Ivanova&#x27;s relationships end badly, the most emphasized being her relationship with Marcus Cole, a Ranger assigned to Babylon 5 in 2260. While he falls in love with her early on, she does not begin a romantic relationship with him, possibly because of pain from her previous failed relationships.

Their story comes to a tragic ending in the year 2261, when she is gravely injured in an epic battle to liberate Earth from the dictatorship of President Morgan Clark, aboard the White Star, the Minbari doctors determine that her injuries are too severe for her survival. She is sent to Babylon 5 to be made comfortable as the fleet is going into battle, Marcus searches for a way to save her, until he finds Dr. Stephen Franklin&#x27;s notes on The Alien Healing/Execution Device, a device that takes life energy from one individual and gives it to another.

Armed with the knowledge that it is stored for safekeeping on Babylon 5, he returns and uses it to save Ivanova&#x27;s life, at the cost of his own. Only then does Ivanova realize the depth of Marcus&#x27; love for her. Mourning the loss, she requests that his body be preserved in cryogenic suspension, in the hopes that he could someday be revived.

===Talia Winters===
While not depicted explicitly in the show, it is strongly hinted that there was a lesbian relationship between Talia Winters and Ivanova.

A badly edited scene in 2.19 &quot;Divided Loyalties&quot; led many to believe that a kiss between the two had been edited out. In response to this, J. Michael Straczynski stated, &quot;No, nothing was cut. We had a matching problem at one point in the edit, where Andrea reached with her left hand in one angle, and did not reach out with the other, and we had to come around for the shot on Ivanova, so it looked a tick off. But nothing was cut.&quot;

However, in the same discussion, Straczynski also mentions that, &quot;I didn&#x27;t show a kiss because, in my experience, it&#x27;s easier on all around if one steps into the shallow end of the pool first, and walks into the deep end rather than diving in and splashing everybody in the process&quot; and &quot;Susan and Talia had been dancing around one another for months; that night, though, would&#x27;ve been the first time they got physically intimate.&quot;

Also, in the same episode, Talia sleeps over at Ivanova&#x27;s apartment, and while the two are not seen in bed together, during the night Talia makes a &#x27;reaching&#x27; motion, as if expecting another person to be sharing the bed, and finding that person gone. Talia also mentions that, when she woke up, Ivanova was gone. Straczynski confirmed this in the script books.

Ivanova referred to Talia during a Minbari rebirth ceremony in the third season of Babylon 5. She told Delenn, the person who organised the ceremony &quot;I think I loved Talia.&quot;

===Departure from Babylon 5===
According to Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski, Claudia Christian declined to be in the fifth season – according to her they weren&#x27;t interested in having her. No agreement was reached and she was not in season five.
She was still able to appear in the final episode, as that episode was originally filmed as the finale of the fourth season and was moved forward. Ivanova did not appear in the episode that was created to serve as a new finale for season four.

This departure necessitated substantial changes to the fifth season of Babylon 5. A planned episode title, &quot;The Very Long Night of Susan Ivanova,&quot; was reused as &quot;The Very Long Night of Londo Mollari,&quot; though the episodes did not share a plot. Furthermore, a planned romantic relationship between Ivanova and the telepath Byron that would have continued her pattern of tragic relationships was changed to be a romance between Lyta Alexander and Byron, which in turn precipitated the events of the Telepath War. A new character, Elizabeth Lochley, was created to take Ivanova&#x27;s narrative role as commander of the station.

In the Season 5 episode A View from the Gallery, two maintenance workers discuss Ivanova&#x27;s sudden departure. They speculate on the reasons she left, mentioning contract and pay disputes and Marcus and his sacrifice before finally concluding that they will not ever know the true story.

==After the series==
Neither the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; movies released after the end of the series nor the spin-off series &quot;Crusade&quot; refer to Ivanova. However, Straczynski wrote a short story set far in the future of the series called Space, Time &amp; the Incurable Romantic which was published in Amazing Stories #602. This story features Marcus Cole being revived after a long time in stasis. The world that created the device Cole used to heal Ivanova (and kill himself in the process) has been discovered, and enough additional information has been found to revive him. While Ivanova herself does not appear, Cole uses some of her hair that was on his uniform and an imprint of her thought patterns and memories. He uses this to create a clone that believes she is Ivanova. He deliberately traps himself and the clone on a remote planet so that he can live out his days with her. The story has been confirmed as canon by Straczynski, who has gone on record to say that Ivanova never finds out about Marcus&#x27;s cloning of her and his deception, which gave Marcus his own happy ending without Ivanova having to grapple with the ethical issues involved.

== Reception and literary analysis ==
The character of Susan Ivanova has been subject to several literary analysis that focus on her feminine identity, or her military career and LGBT-related coming out or her Jewish background.

<text>Edward Bigelow Jolliffe (March 2, 1909 – March 18, 1998) was a Canadian social democratic politician and lawyer from Ontario. He was the first leader of the Ontario section of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and leader of the Official Opposition in the Ontario Legislature during the 1940s and 1950s. He was a Rhodes Scholar in the mid-1930s, and came back to Canada to help the CCF, after his studies were complete and being called to the bar in England and Ontario. After politics, he practised labour law in Toronto and would eventually become a labour adjudicator. In retirement, he moved to British Columbia, where he died in 1998.

==Early life and education==

His family had lived in Ontario for generations. His parents, the Reverend Charles and Gertrude Jolliffe, were missionaries for the Methodist Church of Canada, and were living near what was then known as Luchow, China. He was born at the Canadian Missionary hospital in Luchow, near Chunking on March 2, 1909. He was home-schooled in China by his mother until his early teens. When his family returned to Ontario, he attend Rockwood Public School and then went to high school at Guelph Collegiate Institute. He was an undergraduate at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Victoria College, the United Church College. He became the head of the Victoria Student Council, and was a member of the Hart House Debates Committee. In 1930, he won the Maurice Cody scholarship, and then became one of Ontario&#x27;s Rhodes Scholars that same year. He attended Christ Church, Oxford University for three years. As a member of Oxford&#x27;s Labour Club, he met David Lewis, the club&#x27;s leader and a fellow Canadian. Together they fought the Communist Red October club and fascists such as Lord Haw-Haw–William Joyce. Both he and Lewis planned a &#x27;silent&#x27; protest at Joyce&#x27;s February 1934 speech at Oxford. They carefully made sure that enough members from the Labour Club attended the meeting, and then in groups of two or three, strategically walked out of the speech, across the creaking wooden floors, effectively blotting out Joyce&#x27;s speech. The Blackshirts in the audience then caused riots in the street after the meeting and Jolliffe and Lewis were in the thick of it.

His Oxford experiences made him a socialist and he joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation shortly after it was formed in 1932 during his summer vacation. He helped form an overseas branch of the CCF at Oxford that year. He was called to the bar in England, and was the first Canadian to win the Arden scholarship. When Jolliffe permanently returned from Oxford, he worked as the CCF&#x27;s Ontario organizer and was called to the bar in Ontario and practised law in Toronto from 1938 onwards.

He was a candidate in the 1935 Canadian election in the Toronto riding of St. Paul&#x27;s, placing fourth. He ran again in the 1940 federal election, this time in the York East electoral district. He was noted for calling out the former federal Conservative government for neglecting World War I soldiers on their return home, and that this time, &quot;proper measures be taken to protect the future of Canadian soldiers and their dependents.&quot; He countered that a C.C.F. government would stop war profiteering and the protect the interests of the country&#x27;s soldiers and &quot;small taxpayers.&quot; He was soundly defeated, like every other Ontario CCF candidate, placing a distant third.

==Leader and 1943 election==
He became the first leader of the Ontario CCF in 1942. The following year, he led the party to within five seats of victory with 34 seats and 32% of the vote in the election of 1943 that elected a Conservative minority government under George Drew. He won the York South seat, and became its Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP).

==1945 &quot;Gestapo&quot; campaign==
In the 1945 Ontario election, Drew ran an anti-Semitic, union bashing, Red-baiting campaign. The previous two years of anti-socialist attacks by the Conservatives and their supporters, like Gladstone Murray and Montague A. Sanderson, were devastatingly effective against the previously popular CCF. Much of the source material for the anti-CCF campaign came from the Ontario Provincial Police(OPP)&#x27;s Special Investigation Branch&#x27;s agent D-208: Captain William J. Osbourne-Dempster. His office was supposed to be investigating war-time 5th column saboteurs. Instead, starting in November 1943, he was investigating, almost exclusively, Ontario opposition MPPs, mainly focusing on the CCF caucus. The fact that Jolliffe knew about these &#x27;secret&#x27; investigations as early as February 1944 led to one of the most infamous incidents in 20th-century Canadian politics.

===May 24, 1945 radio speech===
As can be discerned from the previous description, the 1945 campaign was anything but genteel and polite. Jolliffe replied by giving a radio speech (written with the assistance of Lister Sinclair) that accused Drew of running a political Gestapo in Ontario. In the speech excerpt below, Jolliffe alleged that a secret department of the Ontario Provincial Police was acting as a political police – spying on the opposition and the media.

The dramatic tone of the speech is Sinclair&#x27;s, as at the time, he was a dramatist, mostly writing for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). At the time, there was speculation among CCF supporters as to whether or not the speech damaged the party&#x27;s reputation. But as Gerald Caplan maintains in his book &quot;The Dilemma of Canadian Socialism&quot;, the CCF was already at 21 percent in popular support in the Gallop poll just prior to the speech. On election day, they received 22 percent of the popular vote, so at best it added an extra percentage point of support. At worst, it didn&#x27;t have an effect, which is highly unlikely.

Jolliffe&#x27;s inflammatory speech became the main issue of the campaign, and dominated coverage in the media for the rest of the election. Drew, and his Attorney-General Leslie Blackwell vehemently denied Jolliffe&#x27;s accusations, but the public outcry was too much for them to abate. On May 28, 1945, they appointed a Royal Commission to investigate these charges. Jolliffe&#x27;s CCF and the Ontario Liberal party wanted the election suspended until the Commission tabled its report. Drew ignored these requests and continued to hold the election on its original date, despite it being many months before the Commission&#x27;s findings could be made available.

===Election Day, June 4, 1945===
Jolliffe&#x27;s CCF went from 34 seats to 8, but almost garnering the same number of actual votes cast, though their percentage of the popular vote dropped from 32 to 22 percent. Drew, with his attack campaign, successfully drove the voter turn-out up, thereby driving the CCF&#x27;s percentage and seat totals down.

Monday, June 4, 1945, was one of Ontario&#x27;s most important elections in the 20th century according to Caplan and David Lewis. It shaped the province for the next 40 years, as the Conservatives won a massive majority in the Legislature, and would remain in government for the next 40 consecutive years.

After going from 34 seats to 8, as Caplan puts it, &quot;June 4 and June 11 [federal election], 1945, proved to be black days in CCF annuals: Socialism was effectively removed from the Canadian political agenda.&quot; The CCF would never fully recover from this defeat and would eventually cease as a party and morph into the Ontario New Democratic Party. Only then, and in the 1970s, did a social democratic party attain the popularity it had under Jolliffe in 1943.

For Ted Jolliffe, another election consequence was his tenure as the MPP from York South ended, at least for the time being. He lost the election but did better than any other CCF candidate in Toronto or in the outlying Yorks.

===LeBel Royal Commission===

Drew appointed Justice A.M. LeBel as the Royal Commissioner. His terms of reference were restricted to the question of whether Drew was personally responsible for the establishment of &quot;a secret political police organization, for the purpose of collecting, by secret spying, material to be used in attempt to keep him in power.&quot; Wider questions like why the OPP, Ontario Civil Servants, were keeping files on MPPs were not allowed.

Jolliffe would act as his own counsel throughout the commission, but was assisted by fellow CCF lawyer, Andrew Brewin. Both he and Brewin were able to establish, from several eyewitnesses, that agent D-208, Dempster, was spying on the CCF. What they could not prove, because they did not have access to the information in 1945, were the letters that Drew wrote to his supporter M.A. (Bugsy) Sanderson suggesting that he would finance any lawsuits or other charges stemming from the information provided by Dempster in his advertisements. Sanderson was, in late 1943 to 1945, along with Gladstone Murray, leading the libelous advertisement campaigns against the CCF in newspapers and bill-boards, with information gleaned from Dempster&#x27;s briefings. Jolliffe presented several witnesses that claimed to have seen these documents. But Jolliffe could not produce the actual letter, and Drew would deny ever writing it.

On October 11, 1945, Justice LeBel issued his report that essentially exonerated Drew and Blackwell. Due to Jolliffe presenting only circumstantial evidence that linked Drew to Dempster, Murray and Sanderson, the Commissioner found the information unconvincing, even though LeBel believed Dempster&#x27;s interaction with Sanderson and Murray was inappropriate.

Jolliffe&#x27;s motives regarding his accusations, as well as his choice of words, would be questioned for many years afterwards. That would change. In the late 1970s, when David Lewis was doing research for his &quot;Memoirs&quot; he came across archival evidence proving the charge. Due to Lewis&#x27;s discovery, Drew&#x27;s son Edward, placed extremely restrictive conditions on his father&#x27;s papers housed in the Public Archives of Canada that continue as of 2010.

As Lewis pointed out in his memoirs, &quot;We found that Premier Drew and Gladstone Murray did not disclose all information to the Lebel Commission; indeed, they deliberately prevaricated throughout. The head of the Government of Ontario had given false witness under testimony... The perpetrator of Ontario&#x27;s Watergate got away with it.&quot;

Jolliffe faced a leadership challenge in 1946, but was re-elected CCF leader.

==1948 re-elected MPP==
As a result of the 1948 Ontario election, the CCF recovered, winning 21 seats. Jolliffe again became Leader of the Opposition in Ontario and Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for York South. In 1951, however, as a result of the Cold War and the &quot;red scare&quot;, the CCF and labour movement acted to purge individuals (including CCF MPP Robert Carlin) suspected of being under Communist influence. Among the general public, support for socialism suffered: the CCF was reduced to only two seats in the 1951 election. Jolliffe lost his own seat and resigned as party leader in August 1953 in order to focus on his law practice.

==Post MPP career==
He returned to his previous career as a labour lawyer, founding the firm Jolliffe, Lewis and Osler with fellow CCF activist and future New Democratic Party leader, David Lewis in 1945. In the 1950s and 1960s, the firm assisted the United Steelworkers union in their fight with the Mine, Mill &amp; Smelter Workers union in Sudbury, Ontario. In 1968, he was appointed Chief Adjudicator under the (federal) Public Service Staff Relations Act, a position he held until 1978. He then became active as a labour arbitrator until his retirement. In 1972, an historical novel he wrote, entitled &quot;The First Hundred&quot;, was published by McClelland and Stewart Limited.

Ted Jolliffe was the first social democratic leader of the opposition in Ontario&#x27;s Legislature in 1943. He lived long enough to see Bob Rae and the NDP form the Ontario government in September 1990. He died on March 18, 1998, in Salt Spring Island, British Columbia.

<doc id="488035" wikidata="Q5518603" url="?curid=488035" title="Galilee (novel)">
<text>Galilee is a novel by British writer Clive Barker, published in 1998 by HarperCollins Publishers. It chronicles the rise and fall of two very different, but equally powerful dynasties. The first dynasty, the Gearys, are a glamorous and rich family, similar to the Kennedys, who have been a power in America since the Reconstruction. The Barbarossas are a family of godlike beings. The two parents, Cesaria and Nicodemus, came into existence during the Bronze Age, somewhere between Canaan and the city of Samarkand. They have since had four children, the eldest of which is the titular Galilee.

==Plot summary==
The novel begins with an introduction to the manor of L&#x27;Enfant where Cesaria lives along with three of her children, Marietta, Zabrina and Luman. Also living there is Edmund Maddox, the son of Nicodemus and a human woman. Maddox had been crippled in an accident many years before which also resulted in the death of Nicodemus and Maddox&#x27;s wife, Chiyojo. Maddox decides to write a book telling of the conflict between the Gearys and the Barbarossas and when brought to a dome at the top of L&#x27;Enfant is provided back the usage of his legs along with new knowledge that enables him to tell the story. Throughout the novel the reader is told various stories involving Maddox and his half-siblings.

The story initially begins with the baptism of Galilee and how a witness named Zelim became a prophet and eventually a spirit bound to Cesaria. In the present day, Maddox tells the story of how Rachel Pallenberg met Mitchell Geary and married him. The Geary family is led by Mitchell&#x27;s grandfather Cadmus, who while aged came back into power over the family after the mysterious murder of Mitchell&#x27;s father George. Things are initially happy for Rachel, and she befriends much of the fellow women in the Geary family including Margie, wife to Mitchell&#x27;s older brother Garrison. However, after a couple of years of marriage being married to Michell loses its luster. Things appear to be improving when Rachel becomes pregnant, but she suffers from a miscarriage and is told she can&#x27;t have any more children. She decides that she wants to leave Mitchell and tells him so after a visit to her hometown in Ohio. The two of them decide to wait a few weeks before making a final decision.

Margie tells Rachel of a house in Hawaii that is specifically meant for the usage of the Geary women. Rachel heads there and encounters a man named Niolopua, and sees Galilee arrive on his boat, the Samarkand. Galilee tells Rachel a story of a water god and later brings her on his boat. The two fall in love, but fight after Rachel receives a message about Margie being murdered by Garrison. Rachel returns to the U.S. while Galilee decides to kill himself by heading out on the Samarkand without supplies and leaving himself to the elements. Upon her return to the U.S., Rachel meets Danny, a former lover of Margie&#x27;s and agrees to take back some letters and pictures of his that were left in Margie&#x27;s apartment. There, she also finds a diary written by a man named Charles Holt from the Civil War.

Rachel reads Holt&#x27;s diary, telling of his experiences after the war with a cook named Nickleberry. They encounter a man named Galilee who Rachel soon realizes is the same Galilee in the present day when she reads of the same story that he told her when they first met. Meanwhile, Garrison, who has been released from prison, and Mitchell desire to destroy the Barbarossas and believe they can find their way to L&#x27;Enfant through the diary. Mitchell is eventually able to steal the diary from Rachel. With Cadmus close to death, Cesaria desires to see it and emits herself there, where she causes Cadmus to self-mutilate and die shortly afterwards. Rachel witnesses this and decides to return to Galilee. Meanwhile, Mitchell desires to have Rachel back and also heads there. Cesaria appears before Galilee and based on her encounter with Rachel convinces him to return to her. She summons a storm which causes the Samarkand to crash ashore. Rachel and Niolopua are able to find him and bring him back to their house. Mitchell meanwhile, who has brought a knife with him arrives and murders Niolopua, and tries to do the same to Galilee. The spirits of various Geary women appear however and he falls down the stairs, accidentally being stabbed by his knife and dies.

Galilee agrees to reveal how everything came about to Rachel. After encountering Holt and Nickleberry, Galilee traveled with them and was nearly killed by a mob, being saved by Nickleberry. The three of them arrive at L&#x27;Enfant but wear out their welcome. Holt kills himself while Galilee and Nickleberry depart. Galilee, feeling indebted to Nickleberry agrees to help make him rich. Nickleberry steals the identity of a dead soldier named Geary and with Galilee doing nefarious deeds for him becomes rich and powerful. He eventually marries a woman named Bedelia but is unable to satisfy her so Galilee assists. Galilee eventually runs away with Bedelia and she gives birth to Niolopua, but she eventually returns. On her death bed, years later, she makes the two of them agree that Galilee will always be there to comfort the Geary women at his house in Hawaii and he will no longer be bound to doing anything else for the Gearys. Wanting to make Rachel immortal, Galilee brings her to L&#x27;Enfant where and they see Cesaria, who forgives Galilee. Maddox meanwhile, having finished his book leaves L&#x27;Enfant to see the world.

==Reception==
Douglas E. Winter of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; wrote Barker&#x27;s &quot;everexpansive aesthetic and stylistic pursuits find an ideal structure, producing his most controlled and widely appealing novel.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote that it features a &quot;new richness of character, of its warpings and transfigurations by hatred and love, blood legacy and death.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the novel &quot;overheated and intermittently risible&quot; yet &quot;entertaining&quot;.

<doc id="488037" wikidata="Q16104629" url="?curid=488037" title="Michael Cassidy (Canadian politician)">
<text>Michael Morris Cassidy (born May 10, 1937) is a Canadian politician. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1971 to 1984, and in the House of Commons of Canada from 1984 to 1988. Cassidy was the leader of the New Democratic Party of Ontario from 1978 to 1982.

==Background==
Cassidy was born in Victoria, British Columbia, the son of Beatrice Pearce and Harry Cassidy, who was a founding member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, a one-time candidate for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party, and dean of the School of Social Work at the University of Toronto. After graduating from the University of Toronto Schools, he attended the University of Trinity College in the University of Toronto, and the London School of Economics. Cassidy worked as a journalist before entering political life, and was bureau chief of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in Ottawa for a period.

==Politics==
Cassidy was elected as an Ottawa alderman in January 1970. The following year, he was elected to the Ontario legislature for Ottawa Centre in the 1971 provincial election. Cassidy defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Garry Guzzo, who later served in the legislature from 1995 to 2003, by 182 votes. He did not immediately resign from his council seat, and held both positions until the provincial government banned concurrent tenure in 1972. Focussing on provincial politics, Cassidy was re-elected with an increased majority in the 1975 election, in which the NDP under Stephen Lewis reduced the Conservatives to a minority government and became the official opposition in the legislature.

The NDP fell back to third place, behind the Liberal Party, in the 1977 provincial election, and Lewis resigned as leader the following year. Cassidy entered the contest to succeed him and defeated Ian Deans and Michael Breaugh in February 1978. He had a difficult job following Lewis, who was a charismatic and dynamic figure. Cassidy, by comparison, had a rather dry personality. He was also the most left-wing of the three leadership candidates, and was not fully trusted by the party establishment. Cassidy&#x27;s policy advisor in the leadership campaign was James Laxer, a former leader of The Waffle NDP faction which had separated from the party in 1974. Some members of the NDP caucus considered his election as a serious mistake and encouraged him to resign before contesting an election. Cassidy ignored this advice and remained as leader.

The NDP fared poorly in the 1981 election, falling from 33 seats to 21. Their decline allowed the Progressive Conservatives to regain a majority government, while the Liberals neither gained nor lost seats. Cassidy faced a difficult re-election in Ottawa Centre, defeating PC candidate David Small by only 599 votes. He stepped down as leader after the campaign, and was replaced in 1982 by Bob Rae. Donald C. MacDonald, another former NDP leader, would later describe Cassidy&#x27;s leadership as &quot;an unhappy interlude for both him and the party&quot;. (MacDonald, &quot;The Happy Warrior&quot;, p. 186.)

Cassidy then resigned as Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in 1984 to enter national politics. He campaigned for the federal New Democratic Party in the 1984 election, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Dan Chilcott by 54 votes to win the Ottawa Centre riding; two-term Liberal MP John Leslie Evans fell to third place. He served in the 33rd Canadian Parliament. He lost his seat in the 1988 election, coming 762 votes behind Liberal challenger Mac Harb.

Cassidy was appointed to the board of directors of Ontario Hydro in the early 1990s, during Bob Rae&#x27;s tenure as premier. He was fired without notice on January 10, 1996 by the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris, but was reinstated by a court order on January 19. Cassidy opposed the Harris government&#x27;s plan to restructure and partially privatize the Crown corporation, and remained a director until 1997.

==Electoral record==



==Later life==
In 2005, Cassidy became involved in a battle to protect Tay River and the surrounding area from exploitation by multinational developers. He published an essay on the controversy in October 2005. Cassidy has also operated the Ottawa-based Ginger Group Consultants firm, providing lobbying, strategic planning and public relations work for labour organizations and related groups.

He was elected to Council in the Township of Lanark Highlands in 2003 but was defeated in 2006.

<text>SMRT Corporation is a multi-modal public transport operator in Singapore operating bus and rail services. A subsidiary of the Government of Singapore&#x27;s Temasek Holdings, it was established on 6 August 1987 and listed on the Singapore Exchange from 26 July 2000 until 31 October 2016. It is one of the two major operators of Singapore&#x27;s rail services along with SBS Transit.

Besides public transport, SMRT Corporation is involved in leasing advertising and commercial spaces within the transport network it operates, as well as in engaging operations and maintenance services, project management and engineering consultancy in Singapore and overseas. It also operates other transport services under its subsidiary Strides.

==History==

=== Background ===
In 1967, city planners forecast a need for a rail-based urban transport system in Singapore by 1992. Initial opposition by prominent ministers, among them Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee and Trades and Industry Minister Tony Tan, nearly shuttered the program due to financial grounds and concerns of jobs saturation in the construction industry. Goh instead endorsed the idea of an all-bus system recommended by Harvard University specialists, who argued would reduce the cost by 50% compared to the proposed MRT system. Public opinion was split on the matter, with several expressing concerns on the high cost and others being more focused on increasing the standard of living. Following a debate on whether a bus-only system would be more cost-effective, Communications Minister Ong Teng Cheong came to the conclusion that an all-bus system would be inadequate, as it would have to compete for road space in a land-scarce country. Ong was an architect and town planner by training and through his perseverance and dedication became the main figure behind the initial construction of the system.

Singapore&#x27;s MRT infrastructure is built, operated, and managed in accordance with a hybridised quasi-nationalised regulatory framework called the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF), in which the lines are constructed and the assets owned by the Land Transport Authority, a statutory board of the Government of Singapore.
===Mass Rapid Transit Corporation===
The Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC) was established on 14 October 1983 and took over the roles and responsibilities of the former provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority. The founding chairman was Michael Fam and the first executive director was Lim Leong Geok.

On 7 November 1987, the MRTC commenced operating services on Singapore&#x27;s first Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) section, consisting of five stations from Yio Chu Kang to Toa Payoh. On 1 September 1995, MRTC, along with Roads &amp; Transportation Division of the Public Works Department and Land Transportation Division of the Ministry of Communications, merged to form the Land Transport Authority. The operations of the MRT system were regrouped under SMRT Limited, as a private state-owned company owned by the government&#x27;s investment arm Temasek Holdings.

===Privatisation===
In 1998, ownership of the rail assets encompassing the operation of the MRT system network were transferred to SMRT Limited. The process was executed under a License and Operating Agreement, which stated the maintenance obligation of SMRT Limited covering the infrastructures and assets of the transit system. On 26 July 2000, SMRT Limited was listed on the Singapore Exchange as SMRT Corporation, with Temasek Holdings selling 33% of its shares.

In July 2001, SMRT launched a takeover bid for Trans-Island Bus Services (TIBS) that was accepted. The transaction was completed in December 2001, with TIBS being operated as a wholly owned subsidiary. As part of a corporate rebranding programme, TIBS was rebranded as SMRT Buses in May 2004.

===Nationalisation===
In September 2016, Temasek Holdings completed a successful takeover bid for the 46% of SMRT that it did not own which resulted in SMRT being delisted from the Singapore Exchange and returning to government control. All its train operating assets were sold to the government under the Land Transport Authority&#x27;s new Rail Financing Framework. The bus operating assets were also sold to the government under Land Transport Authority&#x27;s Bus Contracting Model.

Being asset light will allow SMRT to focus on the operational reliability of the public transport system and its business ventures overseas.

The buy-out was approved by the High Court of Singapore and the last day of trading of SMRT shares was 18 October 2016.

From 1 October 2016, the Land Transport Authority assumed all the rail operating assets from SMRT under a New Rail Financing Framework that allows the company to focus on its operational reliability.

===Post nationalisation===
In 2023, SMRT Corporation merged its taxi operations under Strides Taxi with Premier Taxis to form Strides Premier.

==Operations==
SMRT&#x27;s primary business is providing public-transport services in Singapore, with operations in the following (as of 2015):
* SMRT Buses – a fleet of up to 1,200 buses, serving the majority of housing estates in northern and north-western Singapore, as well as Jurong West Region (between Boon Lay, Joo Koon and Tuas) as of September 2024.
* SMRT Trains – 119 stations along the North–South, East–West, Circle and the Thomson–East Coast lines of the MRT network. Also operates 13 stations along the Bukit Panjang LRT line.

<doc id="488056" wikidata="Q499021" url="?curid=488056" title="Miner 2049er">
<text>Miner 2049er is a 1982 platformer game developed and published by Big Five Software in December 1982. It is set in a mine, where the player controls the Mountie Bounty Bob. The player controls Bounty Bob through multiple levels of a mine, with the goal of traversing all of the platforms in each level all while avoiding enemies and within a set amount of time.

Like his earlier games for Big Five, Programmer Bill Hogue based &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; on popular arcade games, specifically &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980) and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981). It was his first game for the Atari 8-bit computers. His previous games were monochromatic, and Hogue was excited at the opportunity to make the games in color for the system and wanted to surpass &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. The resulting game has ten stages, most of them with unique gameplay elements. Big Five Software developed a custom 16 kilobyte ROM cartridge for the game compared to the standard 8 kilobyte cart for the Atari computers.

&quot;Miner 2049er&quot; received positive press throughout 1983, appearing on best-of lists, with video game critics complimenting its colorful graphics, game design, and originality. Unlike most games at the time which received one or two ports for different computers and video game consoles, &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; was released for various home systems, with Kiren Hawken of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; stating the game was released on a total of 22 different systems. &quot;Video&quot; magazine&#x27;s editors commented on the game&#x27;s popularity in January 1984, declaring it &quot;the most widely played home electronic game of all time&quot; and that &quot;no home-arcade title has had the impact&quot; that &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; had.

Several sequels were developed to follow-up, with only &quot;Bounty Bob Strikes Back!&quot; (1985) being made by Hogue. The game received positive reviews in retrospectives from &quot;GameSpy&quot; and AllGame, Richard Stanton, in his book &quot;A Brief History of Video Games&quot; (2015), said that &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; was generally forgotten in the wake of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985).

==Gameplay==

&quot;Miner 2049er&quot; features a Mountie named Bounty Bob who has been chasing a wanted criminal into a series of uranium mines. The object of the game is to complete all levels of the mine. To complete a stage, Bob must survey the mine by moving left and right across every part of the floor of each level. Each screen must be fully traversed within a set time indicated at the top of the screen to progress to the next level. Levels feature different hazards such as gaps in platforms and radioactive waste to be avoided and slow moving platforms such as lifts. Other modes of transportation rapidly move Bob across the stage. These include transporters that warp Bob to different numbered doors, a cannon that must be powered by collecting TNT, interconnected slides which force Bob down a path. The original Atari computer and Atari 5200 versions of the game have ten different levels. This was changed in some ports: the Atari 2600 cartridge had three, the ColecoVision version has eleven, while the TI-99/4A port has eight.

The player has a set amount of five lives indicated at the top of the screen. The player loses them by interacting with a mutant enemies, falling from certain heights off a platform, and running out of time in a level. If Bob collects prospecting gear, such as candles and drills, the mutants turn green momentarily, making them vulnerable to Bob&#x27;s touch. Points are awarded for collecting prospecting gear, eliminating enemies and the remaining time at the end of a level. After the game is over, the player can add their name to a high score list if they scored high enough. The high score is not saved after the cartridge is removed from the computer.
==Development==
&quot;Miner 2049er&quot; was programmed by Bill Hogue of Big Five Software of Van Nuys, California. The company officially formed in 1980 and made computer games that were sold through mail order for the TRS-80 line of computers.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, video game clones of popular arcade games were rampant, and this growth of clones were followed on home computers. These clones often copied the gameplay and had similar names to their original influences, with titles like &quot;Munch Man&quot; (1982) or &quot;Snapper&quot; (1982) which were derivative of Namco&#x27;s &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980). Big Five Software&#x27;s games were primarily clones of popular arcade games prior to &quot;Miner 2049er&quot;. 

After finding that the TRS-80 game market was in decline, the team refocused their attention to making games for the Atari 400 and 800 computer line. As the TRS-80 had graphics that were monochrome and described by Hogue as &quot;limited&quot;, The game was Hogue&#x27;s first published game for Atari computers. His team chose to develop for the line, as they felt it was the best combination of graphics and sound and that their cartridge games could not as easily be pirated. The graphics and audio in the game are credited to Curtis A. Mikolyski, Jeff Konyu, Kelly Bakst, and Hogue. It was the group&#x27;s first color computer game. Hogue said he was obsessed with the advanced color capabilities of the Atari computers, which allowed for 15 different colors on the screen at any one time. A black-and-white version was developed for TRS-80 computers, but it was never released. The game was released on a 16-kilobyte ROM cartridge—a large amount of storage at the time, with other games for the Atari 400 and 800 computers such as &quot;Star Raiders&quot; (1980) and &quot;Missile Command&quot; (1981) requiring only 8-kilobyte ROMs. The group designed their own circuit boards to store the game at this size. The game was written in assembly language on an Atari computer.

The gameplay for &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; was developed first, followed later by the mining theme and narrative. Like their previous games, Big Five Software looked to arcade games for inspiration. Hogue recalled that the team really liked the climbing-aspects of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981) and believed they could improve on the gameplay formula. Hogue wanted to blend together the elements he found fun from different arcade games; specifically, the climbing from &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and both traversing the entire screen and enemies who can be made vulnerable from &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980). He recollected that &quot;I was never very good at &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, so I&#x27;m not sure why I borrowed any elements from the game.&quot; The mutant enemies were also inspired by &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, with Hogue discussing he used the arcade games ability to grab items to make enemies vulnerable to defeat for a short period of time. In &quot;Miner 2049er&quot;, Hogue described the level design &quot;a somewhat tedious process&quot; with all of the platforms that the player can step on being hard-coded, allowing level design to be tweaked by adjusting coordinates in the code. Other traversal methods such as the cannons and transporters were made as an iterative process, and that none of those gameplay mechanics were thought of ahead of time.

The games theme was inspired by the California Gold Rush of 1849, in which the miners were nicknamed 49ers. Some versions of the game feature a rendition of the song &quot;Clementine&quot; as part of the score. Hogue said the song was included as it was appropriate for the theme of a 1849 prospector. The game&#x27;s narrative was later changed to be in the future to explain the presence of mutant enemies.

No less than 15 companies were scheduled to produce versions of &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; for various video game consoles, computers, and handheld machines. Mike Livesay designed the adaptations of the game for the Apple II computer and for ColecoVision. Livesay initially approached Micro Fun about adapting the game for ColecoVision but was turned down by the company, which stated that they did not want third-party games. Despite this, Livesay reverse-engineered the ColecoVision and developed his own kit for it based on the Apple II. Livesay eventually got Micro Fun to agree to develop the ColecoVision version of the game, allowing him time to make more levels for it.

==Release==

Artist Scott Ross was responsible for the cover art for &quot;Miner 2049er&quot;. Ross had not seen anything about the game, and based his illustration on recollections of how prospectors looked in films he had seen. Ross recalled that &quot;there was no big discussion about what Bob looked like, and I&#x27;d no idea I&#x27;d draw the guy so many times in the future.&quot; 
&quot;Miner 2049er&quot; was first released for Atari computers in December 1982.

&quot;Creative Computing&quot; reported that plans were being finalized in October 1982 for a variety of other manufacturers to produce versions of &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; for popular home computers and video game systems. International Computer Group (ICG) handled the licensing of the game, with Hogue stating that &quot;Just about every computer imaginable had a port.&quot; This mass-licensing and large advertising campaign by ICG, was described by William Cassidy of &quot;GameSpy&quot; as being new for the video game industry. Most game development company would design a game for one platform, then have its in-house programmers port the game to one or two other systems if it was successful. Kiren Hawken of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine said the game was released to a total of 22 different systems, including a LCD handheld game. In 1983, the game was released for various systems, including the Atari 2600 in May, the Atari 5200 in July, the Colecovision in August, the TI-99/4A in October, and the IBM PC in November. &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; was the first independently produced game released for the Atari 5200 and the ColecoVision. It was released for systems like the Super Cassette Vision and some of the major Japanese 8-bit computers of the 1980s, including the PC-8800 series, Fujitsuo FM-7, and the Sharp X1.

The Atari 8-bit computer version of the game sold well, with one review stating that it sold in similar quantities to the highly publicized &quot;Ultima II&quot; (1982). By 1983, Joaquin Boaz wrote in &quot;InfoWorld&quot; that &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; was &quot;selling like crazy&quot;. &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; reported that the ColecoVision version of the game by Micro Fun was the number-one-selling video game of the year. In an article published in &quot;Video&quot; magazine in January 1984, the game was described as &quot;the most widely played home electronic game of all time&quot;, and the article also said that &quot;no home-arcade title has had the impact&quot; that the game had had to date. Livesay recalled the success of his ports of the game, saying that in &quot;six months later I was making $15,000 a month in royalties, which was a huge amount for a single, 24-year-old kid in the early &#x27;80s.&quot; In a 2007 interview, Hogue reflected on the popularity of the game, saying that it was &quot;a simple game and it&#x27;s clear at first glance what needs to be done to finish a level. But as you&#x27;re playing along you discover it wasn&#x27;t quite as easy as you thought.&quot;

In the early 1990s, Hogue licensed &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; to Mindscape, which designed a version of the game for Game Boy. This version which featured scrolling versions of levels from both the 1982 game and its sequel &quot;Bounty Bob Strikes Back!&quot; (1985). Hogue recalled that the Game Boy version was &quot;a really poor sales performer&quot; and that &quot;The developers weren&#x27;t integrating with me on a daily basis; there was more of a &#x27;We&#x27;ve done it, here it is,&#x27; approach.&quot;

In 2001, Hogue released the game and its sequel, &quot;Bounty Bob Strikes Back!&quot;, for free online with an embedded Atari 8-bit computer emulator. Hogue said that he released it this way, as opposed to releasing the games&#x27; ROMs, as &quot;I&#x27;d spent so much time back in the Eighties tweaking those color registers to achieve perfection and I wanted to see the game that way again.&quot;

Magmic released the game for mobile devices in 2007. The mobile version of the game features two versions of &quot;Miner 2049er&quot;: a new version with contemporary cartoon-style graphics of the game as well as a port of the original game, which was coded from scratch. Both versions feature gameplay similar to the original release. Both the Atari 800 and Atari 2600 versions of &quot;Miner2049er&quot; were included as part of the &quot;Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration&quot; (2022) compilation for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Steam, and Xbox One.

==Reception==

Reviewers from computer publications including &quot;ANALOG Computing&quot;, &quot;Creative Computing&quot; &quot;InfoWorld&quot;, &quot;SoftSide&quot; and &quot;Softalk&quot; highlighted the games graphics. Tom Hudson of &quot;Analog Computing&quot; praised them as not simply being &quot;just one-color graphics, but detailed multicolor objects&quot; and that the gameplay was not abandoned in favor of them. Owen Linzmayer of &quot;Creative Computing&quot; found the game did not use the Atari computers full graphic potential, but the game included &quot;one of the most dazzling visual effects&quot; on the computer system, with the animation of Bounty Bob dematerializing on the elevators. Writing for &quot;SoftSide&quot;, David Plotkin also complimented the attention to detail, noting the animated moving feet on Bob and how his facial expression changes as he jumps. Boaz also discussed the color in the randomly generated palettes that were applied to levels, which he felt broke up monotony in the game.

For the gameplay, Deborah Burns of &quot;Antic&quot; and Boaz commented on the difficulty of the game, with Burns stating it was more difficult than it appears and Boaz saying the game to be a &quot;gourmet&#x27;s delight that offers many, many levels of challenge.&quot; Linzmayer echoed this, comparing the game to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, which had four stages, while Big Five Software&#x27;s game had a &quot;stupefying ten separate boards, each with a different scenario.&quot; In his review of the ColecoVision version of the game, George Kopp of &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot; &quot;The struggle to get to the eleventh level is definitely worth it. The floating platforms here give the game all the grace and tension of a trapeze act in the Big Top.&quot; Hudson summarized that the game was &quot;one of those rare games which looks as if it were designed, not just thrown together.&quot;

A reviewer credited as &quot;MTY&quot; in the magazine &quot;Softline&quot; found that despite being similar to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, and &quot;Apple Panic&quot; (1981), the game was original and that &quot;unlike many arcade games, [&quot;Miner2049er&quot;] doesn&#x27;t require you to get faster as the pace picks up in order to attain the next level. It requires you to develop the different skills needed to survive.&quot; Harvey Kong Tin of &quot;Page 6&quot; said that as jumping has become part of computer games with &quot;The Pharaoh&#x27;s Curse&quot; (1983), &quot;&quot; (1983) and &quot;Jumpman&quot; (1983), &quot;Miner2049er&quot; ranked as the best of them. Margot Comstock Tommervik of &quot;Softalk&quot; (1983) concluded that the game &quot;might recall other games; but no-rip-off here-the pieces come together in a way that&#x27;s new and fresh, challenging and addictive; and delightful.&quot;

Reviewers like Plotkin and publications such as &quot;Computers &amp; Electronics&quot; commented in their reviews that the game was set to become a classic, while Tommervik said it was &quot;bound to be a hit.&quot; &quot;The Video Game Update&quot; listed Bill Hogue as the designer of the year in their 1983 awards listing. Scott Mace of &quot;InfoWorld&quot; listed it as the &quot;best arcade-type computer game&quot; of 1983, The game was awarded &quot;1984 Electronic Game of the Year&quot; at the 5th annual Arkie Awards by &quot;Video&quot; magazine. The game was included in various best of lists, such as the &quot;Electronic Fun with Computer &amp; Games&quot; list of the 50 Best Video Games in 1984 and Nick Walker of &quot;Computer Gamer&quot; included the game in his list of 15 classic games for the Atari computer line, citing it as &quot;The game that started the trend for jumping and climbing games and still one of the best.&quot;

Reviewing the VIC-20 version, &quot;The Video Game Update&quot; found the game &quot;addictive&quot; with graphics that were &quot;less than outstanding&quot;, but said that &quot;there are enough challenges in this game to keep the player busy for many, many hours of frustration and triumph.&quot; The magazine said the limitations of the Atari 2600 system meant that the graphics for that systems port were &quot;sacrificed somewhat&quot; and the game was &quot;considerably slower and less fluid than in the original computer game, but this version is still a very good game in its own right.&quot;
 Reviewers in &quot;Games&quot; found the Atari 2600 version slower-paced than the original, and could not be compared to the &quot;superb&quot; ColecoVision version. Other ports were praised, such as Arnie Katz writing that &quot;No previous Apple II game can match the fluidity of Miner&#x27;s control scheme.&quot; concluding that the game was &quot;new king of the computer climbing games.&quot; &quot;The Video Game Update&quot; also described the Intellivision version to be the &quot;best climbing game yet&quot; for the system.

===Retrospective reception===

In retrospective reviews, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; gave the ColecoVision version an 82% rating in 1989, recommending it for fans of traditional platform games as one of the best on the system. Brett Alan Weiss reviewed the Atari 5200 version, declaring it &quot;one of the best games of the early 1980s&quot;, noting that it was fast-paced, intricately designed, and a very long and diverse game. He said that unlike those in &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, pathways were not immediately obvious, and this made the game fun and more challenging. In their &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; article on the game, William Cassidy of &quot;GameSpy&quot; referring to the game as &quot;Hogue&#x27;s masterwork.&quot; Cassidy praised the graphics and game play as high quality for 1983 standards, and that the games variety was the stand out feature as most arcade games of the era had one or two screens, &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; had ten different levels.

Levi Buchanan of &quot;IGN&quot; declared the mobile version to be &quot;a pixel-perfect recreation of the original&quot;, finding the controls responsive for a mobile game. He found that the game was fun in 1984 and was also fun in 2007, and that the game merited a new audience. He recommended it for fans of games like &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and &quot;BurgerTime&quot; (1982). The mobile version was later released for iOS. Mike Abolins of &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; found the mobile version of the game to be slow-paced, writing that audiences who were familiar games like &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; would find the game slow-paced, and not conducive to repeated play. Richard Stanton, author of &quot;A Brief History of Video Games&quot; (2015), described that &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; was &quot;forgotten&quot; following the release of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985), a game that he described as making the 1982 game &quot;look like a fossil&quot;.

==Legacy==

Multiple games were directly influenced by &quot;Miner 2049er&quot;. Stanton said &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; contributed to the popularity of platform games on computers like the ZX Spectrum. This included Matthew Smith&#x27;s &quot;Manic Miner&quot; (1983), one of the first major British hit computer games. Smith said that Hogue&#x27;s game was a major influence on his game.
 &quot;Manic Miner&quot; borrows thematic and gameplay elements from &quot;Miner 2049er&quot;, such as the underground setting and oxygen levels measured with a timer. 

Following the games success, Hogue said that &quot;The licensees of [&quot;Miner 2049er&quot;] were crying out for another game, so I worked with Curtis Mikolyski while we attempted to create an even better game.&quot; A follow-up titled &quot;Scraper Caper&quot; was announced in 1983 but never released. The game was going to have vertical scrolling and a plot involving Bounty Bob becoming a fire fighter, running into buildings to save people. Hogue said to have thrown away the disks and tapes containing &quot;Scraper Caper&quot;. He later said he felt foolish for the decision to cancel the game as a lot of work was put into it. Another unreleased follow-up was an untitled game. The game would have a three-dimension look influenced by Atari&#x27;s game &quot;Crystal Castles&quot; (1983) and involved Bounty Bob being chased by fireballs. Hogue said the game production was halted as his team felt the design would not be superior to &quot;Miner 2049er&quot;.

Livesay was working on a game for Micro Fun titled &quot;Miner 2049er II&quot;, a title unrelated to &quot;Scraper Caper&quot;. The game was announced for released for the Apple II, Commodore 64, ColecoVision, and IBM PC. Hogue recalled the creation of this version was due to a Micro Fun getting increasingly annoyed with Big Five Software as they had a verbal agreement to do an Apple II version of their next game. Hogue said that &quot;It wasn&#x27;t like I wasn&#x27;t getting any money out of it, but creatively I wasn&#x27;t totally on board. And I don&#x27;t think I had an Apple II, so I didn&#x27;t have a way to play it – or even see it.&quot; &quot;Miner 2049er II&quot; was released for the Apple II in the fourth quarter of 1984. The next game in the series was &quot;Bounty Bob Strikes Back!&quot; (1985). Hogue stated that following the video game crash of 1983 and the release of &quot;Bounty Bob Strikes Back!&quot;, Big Five Software started scaling back their company operations until it was run out of Hogue&#x27;s home; he eventually closed the company and left the video game industry.

<doc id="488059" wikidata="Q13581044" url="?curid=488059" title="Magnetic cartridge">
<text>A magnetic cartridge, more commonly called a phonograph cartridge or phono cartridge or (colloquially) a pickup, is an electromechanical transducer that is used to play phonograph records on a turntable.

The cartridge contains a removable or permanently mounted stylus, the tip - usually a gemstone, such as diamond or sapphire - of which makes physical contact with the record&#x27;s groove. In popular usage and in disc jockey jargon, the stylus, and sometimes the entire cartridge, is often called the needle. As the stylus tracks the serrated groove, it vibrates a cantilever on which is mounted a permanent magnet which moves between the magnetic fields of sets of electromagnetic coils in the cartridge (or vice versa: the coils are mounted on the cantilever, and the magnets are in the cartridge). The shifting magnetic fields generate an electrical current in the coils. The electrical signal generated by the cartridge can be amplified and then converted into sound by a loudspeaker.

== History ==
The first commercially successful type of electrical phonograph pickup was introduced in 1925. Although electromagnetic, its resemblance to later magnetic cartridges is remote: it employed a bulky horseshoe magnet and used the same single-use steel needles which had been standard since the first mechanical transfer disc record players appeared in the 1890s. This early type of magnetic pickup dominated the market well into the 1930s, but by the end of that decade it had been superseded by the comparatively lightweight piezoelectric crystal pickup type.however the use of short-lived disposable metal needles remained standard. During the years immediately following World War II, as old record players with very heavy pickups were replaced, precision-ground and long-lasting stylus tips made of sapphire or the exotic hard metal osmium were increasingly popular. However, records made for home use were still made of the same abrasive shellac compound formulated to rapidly wear down the points of steel needles to fit the groove.

The introduction of the 33 rpm record LP &quot;album&quot; in 1948 and the 45 rpm record &quot;single&quot; in 1949 prompted consumers to upgrade to a new multi-speed record player with the required smaller-tipped &quot;microgroove&quot; stylus. Sapphire and diamond then became the standard stylus tip materials. At first, the new styli came installed in smaller, lighter piezoelectric crystal or ceramic cartridges of the general type found in inexpensive self-contained portable record players throughout the phonographic era. Ceramic cartridges continue to be used in most of the &quot;retro&quot; and compact record players currently being made, in part because they are comparatively robust and resistant to damage from careless handling, but mostly because they are inexpensive. However, during the 1950s, a new generation of small, lightweight, highly compliant magnetic cartridges appeared and quickly found favor among high-fidelity enthusiasts because of their audibly superior performance. The high compliance also reduced record wear. They soon became standard in all but the cheapest component audio systems and are the most common type of pickup cartridge in use today.

== Design and construction ==
The cartridge consists of several components: the stylus, cantilever, magnets, coils and body. The stylus is the part that, when in use, is the interface with the record surface and tracks the modulations in the groove. It is typically made of a small polished diamond or other industrial gemstone. The cantilever supports the stylus, and transmits the vibrations from it to the coil/magnet assembly. The former is typically made of boron or aluminium, and previously beryllium although some manufacturers market models with exotic gemstone cantilevers. Most models of moving magnet cartridges have detachable stylus–cantilever sub-assemblies that allow for their replacement without the need to remove and replace the entire cartridge when the stylus has become worn.

Coupled to the tonearm, the cartridge body&#x27;s function is to give the moving parts a stationary platform so that they can track the groove with precision.

== Types ==
In high-fidelity systems, crystal and ceramic pickups have been replaced by the magnetic cartridge, using either a moving magnet or a moving coil.

Compared to the crystal and ceramic pickups, the magnetic cartridge usually gives improved playback fidelity and reduced record wear by tracking the groove with lighter pressure. Magnetic cartridges use lower tracking forces and thus reduce the potential for groove damage. They also have a lower output voltage than a crystal or ceramic pickup, in the range of only a few millivolts, thus requiring greater amplification.

=== Moving Magnet (MM) and Moving Iron (MI) cartridges ===

In a moving magnet cartridge, the stylus cantilever carries a tiny permanent magnet, which is positioned between two sets of fixed coils (in a stereophonic cartridge), forming a tiny electromagnetic generator. As the magnet vibrates in response to the stylus following the record groove, it induces a tiny current in the coils.

Because the magnet is small and has little mass, and is not coupled mechanically to the generator (as in a ceramic cartridge), a properly adjusted stylus follows the groove more faithfully while requiring less tracking force (the downward pressure on the stylus).

Moving iron and induced magnet types (ADC being a well-known example) have a moving piece of iron or other ferrous alloy coupled to the cantilever (instead of a magnet), while a permanent, bigger magnet is over the coils, providing the necessary magnetic flux.

=== Moving Coil (MC) cartridges ===
The MC design is again a tiny electromagnetic generator, but (unlike an MM design) with the magnet and coils reversed: the coils are attached to the cantilever, and move within the field of a permanent magnet. The coils are tiny and made from very fine wire.

Since the number of windings that can be supported in such an armature is small, the output voltage level is correspondingly small. The resulting signal is only a few hundred microvolts, and thus more easily swamped by noise, induced hum, etc. Thus it is more challenging to design a preamplifier with the extremely low noise inputs needed for moving-coil cartridge, therefore a &quot;step up transformer&quot; is sometimes used instead.

However, there are available many &quot;high output&quot; moving coil cartridges that have output levels similar to MM cartridges.

Moving coil cartridges are extremely small precision instruments and are therefore generally expensive, but are frequently preferred by audiophiles due to a subjectively better performance.

=== Moving Micro Cross (MMC) cartridges ===

The MMC design was invented and patented by Bang &amp; Olufsen. The MMC cartridge is a variation of the Moving Iron (MI) design. Magnets and coils are stationary while a &quot;micro cross&quot; moves with the stylus, thereby varying the distances between the arms of the cross and the magnets. It is claimed that the MMC design allows for superior channel separation, since each channel&#x27;s movements appear on a separate axis.

=== Moving Magnet vs. Moving Coil ===

Moving magnet cartridges are more commonly found at the &#x27;lower-end&#x27; of the market, while the &#x27;higher-end&#x27; tends to be dominated by moving coil designs. The debate as to whether MM or MC designs can ultimately produce the better sound is often heated and subjective. The distinction between the two is often blurred by cost and design considerations - e.g. can an MC cartridge requiring another step-up amplification outperform well made MM cartridges that need simpler front-end stages?

* MC cartridges offer very low inductance and impedance, which means that the effects of capacitance (in the cable that goes from the cartridge to the preamp) are negligible, unlike MM cartridges, which comparatively sport very high inductance and impedance. In the latter, cable capacitance can negatively affect the flatness of frequency response and linearity of phase response. This would account for a potential sonic advantage to MC types.
* It is generally believed that MC cartridges sport lower moving masses. However, quality MM cartridges are able to offer as low or lower moving mass than some MC cartridges. For example, the state-of-the-art Technics EPC-100CMK4 with 0.055 mg of effective tip mass, of moving magnet design. Comparatively, the popular Denon DL-301 moving coil cartridge has an effective tip mass of 0.270 mg.
* To discriminate cartridges by engine (MC vs MM) overlooks the fact that the stylus tip shape (conical vs elliptical vs advanced shapes), mounting (bonded vs nude), cantilever material (aluminum vs boron vs beryllium) and cantilever design (solid rod vs rolled tube) have a significant influence in the sound, and this may account for more variation of sound quality than the engine type used.

MM cartridges generally have output of 3-6 mV, compatible with the MM inputs of preamplifiers. MC cartridges come in two varieties, low output
(usually &lt; 1.0 mV) and high output (more than 1.5 mV); there are also some with very low output (0.3 mV or less). High output MC cartridges are a
concession to compatibility with older preamp MM inputs; low output MC cartridges may generate excessive noise or have insufficient preamp gain to drive amplifiers to their rated output if used on MM inputs. Most solid state preamplifiers have separate high gain, low noise MC inputs to accommodate these. Cartridges with very low output need a separate pre-phono amplification stage before input to an MC or MM preamplifier stage.

=== &quot;London Decca&quot; Cartridges ===

The Decca phono cartridges were a unique design, with fixed magnets and coils. The stylus shaft was composed of the diamond tip, a short piece of soft iron, and an L-shaped cantilever made of non-magnetic steel. Since the iron was placed very close to the tip (within 1 mm), the motions of the tip could be tracked very accurately. Decca engineers called this &quot;positive scanning&quot;. Vertical and lateral compliance was controlled by the shape and thickness of the cantilever. Decca cartridges had a reputation for being very musical; however early versions required more tracking force than competitive designs - making record wear a concern.

<text>The Floralia was a festival of ancient Roman religion in honor of the goddess Flora, held on 27 April during the Republican era, or 28 April in the Julian calendar. The festival included &quot;Ludi Florae&quot;, the &quot;Games of Flora&quot;, which lasted for six days under the empire.

The festival had a licentious, pleasure-seeking atmosphere. In contrast to many festivals which had a patrician character, the games of Flora were plebeian in nature.

==Flora==

Flora is one of the most ancient goddesses of Roman religion and was one of fifteen deities to have her own state-supported high priest, the &quot;flamen Florialis&quot;. A goddess of flowers, vegetation, and fertility, she received sacrifices &quot;(piacula)&quot; in the sacred grove of the Arval Brothers, an archaic priesthood. Her altar at Rome was said to have been established by the Sabine king Titus Tatius during the semi-legendary Regal period. &quot;Flusalis&quot; (linguistically equivalent to &quot;Floralia&quot;) was a month on the Sabine calendar, and Varro counted Flora among the Sabine deities.

==Temples of Flora==
The Temple of Flora was built in Rome upon consultation with the Sibylline Books shortly after a drought that occurred around 241–238 BCE. The temple was located near the Circus Maximus on the lower slope of the Aventine Hill, a site associated with the plebeians of Rome. Games were instituted for the founding day of the temple (28 April), and were held only occasionally until continued crop damage led to their annual celebration beginning in 173.

&quot;Flora Rustica&quot; (&quot;Rural Flora&quot;) had another temple on the Quirinal Hill, the Temple of Flora Rustica, which may have been the location of the altar erected by Tatius.

==Games==

The games &quot;(ludi)&quot; of Flora were presented by the plebeian aediles and paid for by fines collected when public lands &quot;(ager publicus)&quot; were encroached upon. Cicero mentions his role in organizing games for Flora when he was aedile in 69 BC. The festival opened with theatrical performances &quot;(ludi scaenici)&quot;, and concluded with competitive events and spectacles at the Circus and a sacrifice to Flora. In AD 68, the entertainments at the Floralia presented under the emperor Galba featured a tightrope-walking elephant.

===Participation of prostitutes===
Prostitutes participated in the Floralia as well as the wine festival (Vinalia) on 23 April. According to the satirist Juvenal, prostitutes danced naked and fought in mock gladiator combat. Many prostitutes in ancient Rome were slaves, and even free women who worked as prostitutes lost their legal and social standing as citizens, but their inclusion at religious festivals indicates that they were not completely cast out from society.

==Observances==
Ovid says that hares and goats—animals considered fertile and salacious—were ceremonially released as part of the festivities. Persius says that the crowd was pelted with vetches, beans, and lupins, also symbols of fertility.

In contrast to the Cerealia, when white garments were worn, multi-colored clothing was customary. There may have been nocturnal observances, since sources mention measures taken to light the way after the theatrical performances.

A rite called the Florifertum is described by one source as involving the bearing &quot;(fert-)&quot; of wheat ears &quot;(spicae)&quot; into a shrine &quot;(sacrarium)&quot;. It is unclear whether the offering was made to Flora or to Ceres, or whether if made to Flora it occurred on 27 April or 3 May. Ovid describes a &quot;florifertum&quot; in honor of Juno Lucina on 1 March, a date also celebrated as the &quot;dies natalis&quot; (&quot;birthday&quot;) of Mars in whose conception Flora played a role.

<text>Jetstar Airways Pty Ltd, trading as Jetstar, is an Australian low-cost airline headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Qantas, created in response to the threat posed by the airline Virgin Blue (now known as Virgin Australia). Jetstar is part of Qantas&#x27; two-brand strategy of having Qantas Airways for the premium full-service market and Jetstar for the low-cost market. As of June 2015, Jetstar was carrying 8.5% of all passengers travelling in and out of Australia.

The airline operates an extensive domestic network as well as regional and international services from its main base at Melbourne Airport, using a mixed fleet consisting of the Airbus A320 family and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Like its Qantas parent, Jetstar competes with Virgin Australia. Qantas, through the Jetstar Group, also has stakes in airlines Jetstar Asia Airways and Jetstar Japan.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===
The airline was established by Qantas in 2001 as a low-cost domestic subsidiary. Qantas had previously acquired Impulse Airlines on 20 November 2001 and operated it under the QantasLink brand, but following the decision to launch a low-cost carrier, re-launched the airline under the Jetstar brand. Domestic passenger services began on 25 May 2004, soon after the sale of tickets for its inaugural flight in February 2004. International services to Christchurch, New Zealand commenced on 1 December 2005. Although owned by Qantas, its management operates largely independently of Qantas through the company formerly known as Impulse Airlines.

Originally the airline was headquartered on the grounds of Avalon Airport near Melbourne, and started flying out of Avalon Airport in mid 2004, but has since relocated its registered office to the suburb of Collingwood, Victoria, near the Melbourne central business district.

Reserved seating is provided on all routes and on 4 October 2006, Jetstar became the first Australian airline to allow customers to select their seat upon booking. Sister airline Jetstar Asia Airways took off from its Singapore hub to Hong Kong on 13 December 2004. This marked Qantas&#x27; entry into the Asian low-cost market and signified its intention to battle key competitor Singapore Airlines on its home ground. Qantas has a 49% stake in Jetstar Asia&#x27;s ownership.

On 1 December 2005, Jetstar commenced operations from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and the Gold Coast to Christchurch in New Zealand. On 7 December 2005, it was announced that Jetstar would establish the world&#x27;s first global low-cost airline. At the end of 2005, it was announced that Jetstar would fly to Perth from Avalon Airport.

In July 2006, Jetstar and Jetstar Asia were brought together under the &quot;Jetstar&quot; brand. Online bookings for both carriers were integrated into Jetstar.com.

In July 2007, Qantas acquired an 18% stake in Vietnam&#x27;s Pacific Airlines, to increase to 30% by 2010. The airline was relaunched on 23 May 2008 as &quot;Jetstar Pacific&quot;.

On 1 August 2008, Jetstar announced that it had signed an agreement with the Northern Territory Government to make Darwin International Airport an international hub with plans for seven aircraft to be based in Darwin. Under the agreement, Jetstar would be required to base three aircraft at Darwin by June 2009, with a further four by June 2012, with the Northern Territory Government to provide $5 million to set up the hub and a further $3 million for promotion of the new routes. In December 2013, Jetstar announced that it would be closing the Darwin base in May 2014 and re-positioning the based aircraft to Adelaide. Flights to Tokyo via Manila were to be discontinued while services to Singapore would be operated by Jetstar Asia with Singapore-based aircraft. The base closure was attributed to cost-cutting measures by parent company Qantas as well as increased competition from the re-introduction of flights by Asian carriers into Darwin Airport.

On 28 April 2009, Jetstar commenced daily direct services from Auckland to the Gold Coast and Sydney. On 10 June 2009, Jetstar commenced domestic New Zealand flights between Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Queenstown using Airbus A320 aircraft; services to Dunedin commenced later. Jetstar replaced Qantas subsidiary Jetconnect on these routes.

===Developments since 2010===
From 1 February 2011, Jetstar started its co-operation with the oneworld alliance, allowing people booking an itinerary with a full oneworld member to include a Jetstar flight in the itinerary. However, the flight must be sold via Jetstar&#x27;s corporate parent Qantas, under a QF flight number.

In August 2011, Jetstar&#x27;s parent Qantas announced that it would set up a new airline to be called Jetstar Japan, a joint venture of Jetstar, Japan Airlines, and Mitsubishi. The airline was expected to start operating in December 2012, but then launched ahead of schedule on 3 July 2012.

In March 2012, another Asian Jetstar branded airline was announced, Jetstar Hong Kong, a strategic partnership between Qantas and China Eastern Airlines, which was expected to commence operations in 2013. Although it took delivery of aircraft, Jetstar Hong Kong never commenced operations due to a revoked licence application.

In November 2013, Jetstar moved its head office from Melbourne&#x27;s CBD to the suburb of Collingwood. In February 2014, Jetstar signed a codeshare agreement with Emirates Airlines as a continuation of the agreement between Emirates and Qantas, Jetstar&#x27;s parent airline.

In mid-2014, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) took legal action against Jetstar and competitor Virgin Australia in respect of drip pricing. In November 2015 the Federal Court of Australia found that the ACCC&#x27;s claims that the two airlines engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by carrying out drip pricing were proven. In September 2022, Stephanie Tully was appointed as the new CEO of Jetstar.

===New Zealand operations===
Currently, the airline operates domestic and short-haul international services to Auckland, Christchurch, Queenstown, and Wellington, and domestic services to Dunedin, using their fleet of Airbus A320 family aircraft. Jetstar will add trans-Tasman flights between Dunedin and the Gold Coast, as well flights between Hamilton and the Gold Coast and Sydney from June 2025.


In June 2015, Jetstar announced that it would commence regional services in New Zealand, beginning in December 2015. The new services would be flown by five turboprops Bombardier Dash 8s operated by Eastern Australia Airlines—one of Qantas&#x27; subsidiary regional airlines—under the Jetstar brand. At least four new destinations would be served initially, with Hamilton, Rotorua, New Plymouth, Napier, Palmerston North, Nelson and Invercargill named as the cities under consideration. On 31 August 2015, Jetstar announced it had selected the first four regional centres it would serve at the commencement of operations on 1 December; these were Napier, Nelson, New Plymouth, and Palmerston North. All four cities had services to Auckland; Nelson also had services to Wellington.

Jetstar announced in November 2019 that they would be ceasing all of their regional routes in New Zealand because the routes were loss-making.

In mid March 2020, Jetstar suspended their New Zealand operations in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. On 15 August, Jetstar suspended its domestic operations in New Zealand after the Government implemented social distancing rules in response to a second outbreak in Auckland that month. The airline attracted criticism after it refused to offer cash refunds to passengers whose flights were affected by the cancellation, instead offering travel vouchers or to change dates.

In mid September 2020, Jetstar announced that it was resuming domestic flights in New Zealand after the New Zealand Government eliminated physical distancing requirements on aircraft.

In late May 2024, Jetstar Flight JQ225 slid off the runway at Christchurch Airport, after suffering steering issues caused by a possible hydraulic leak. The Civil Aviation Authority commenced an investigation into the incident.

== Corporate affairs ==
===Business figures===
The key trends for the Jetstar Group are (as of the financial year ending 30 June):
===Marketing===
From 2004 to 2006, the airline&#x27;s mascot, &quot;Julie The Jetstar Girl&quot;, was played by actress Magda Szubanski. The advertising slogan of Jetstar is &quot;All day every day low fares&quot;. In 2006, the jingle &quot;Let&#x27;s Fly Jetstar tonight&quot; and the use of Szubanski ceased and was replaced with &quot;It&#x27;s All About Choice / Fly Away&quot; (later &quot;Low Fares, Good Time&quot;).

====Television series====
The Nine Network began airing the series &quot;Going Places&quot; from October 2007. The eight-part series depicted the everyday lives of selected members of Jetstar&#x27;s Melbourne airport staff. The show followed the dramas of the check-in staff mid-flight, and new international recruits.

===Sponsorship===
Jetstar Airways was the major sponsor of the National Rugby League team, the Gold Coast Titans from 2008 until 2012. In July 2008, Jetstar Airways was named the Official Airline of the Australian national rugby league team. One of its A320s was decorated with special decals to advertise the relationship.

=== Fleet development ===

In October 2011, Qantas placed an order for 110 A320s, with 11 allocated to a planned new Qantas Group premium airline in Asia (never actually established) and 99 to various Jetstar-branded airlines including Jetstar Hong Kong, which received aircraft but never commenced operations. The order consisted of 32 A320ceos and 78 A320neos, with scope to convert some to the larger A321s.

In 2014, Qantas ordered another 21 A320neos, taking the total on order to 99.

In 2016, the operator or operators of the A320neos and A321neos (Jetstar or Qantas) remained unspecified.

In November 2017, the order consisted out of 54 A320neos and 45 A321neos as some of the A320neo orders were converted to A321neos.

In February 2018, eighteen of the orders were converted to A321LRs to allow Jetstar Airways to deploy some of its Boeing 787s onto other routes.

In June 2019, at the Paris Air Show, Qantas Group converted 26 A321neo orders to the A321XLR and 10 A321neo to the A321LR. In addition, 10 further A321XLRs were ordered. Total orders for the A320neo family were 109: 45 A320neos, 28 A321LRs, and 36 A321XLR. How these planes will be distributed throughout the Qantas Group has not been announced; some of the A321XLRs have been earmarked for Qantas by ex-CEO Alan Joyce. The rest of the aircraft will be allocated to their Jetstar subsidiaries. In July 2022, the airline took its first A321LR.

In November 2023, Jetstar announced a major revamp of its fleet of 11 787-8 Dreamliners from late 2025. The multi-million dollar aircraft upgrade will have new RECARO Seats in business and economy (with the business class offering increasing from 21 to 44), a lie-flat crew rest area, wi-fi connectivity to replace entertainment screens and a new livery to match the A321LR.

===Former fleet===

Jetstar formerly operated the following aircraft:

==In-flight service==

===Cabins===

On all Boeing 787 international routes, Jetstar offers a two-class service. 

;Business Class
Jetstar offers Business Class on its Boeing 787 aircraft. The Business Class cabin is fitted with 21 leather premium class seats in a 2-3-2 configuration, similar to Qantas domestic Business Class or Qantas international premium economy class. The service is inclusive of all meals and beverages, in-flight entertainment, and includes an increased baggage allowance of 30 kg. Business Max fares also include Qantas Club lounge access where available, and earn Qantas Frequent Flyer points.

;Economy Class
Jetstar offers either pre-purchased meals on wheels or buy on board service with food and beverages.

===In-flight entertainment===
The airline has an eponymously named inflight magazine. In November 2011, Jetstar became the first airline to offer passengers iPads for use as in-flight entertainment devices. The units, which are pre-loaded with movies, games, and magazines, are provided on flights over two hours duration and are available for a fee in Economy Class but are complimentary in the international Business Class cabin, although some aircraft have seat back entertainment screens. The options available are changed on a bi-monthly basis depending on customer feedback forms which are collected by head office through a random selection process.

Jetstar&#x27;s Boeing 787 aircraft are fitted with 10-inch seat-back on-demand entertainment screens in business class and 9-inch screens in economy class. While complimentary for Business Class passengers, Economy Class passengers will need to pre-purchase access to the on-demand entertainment screens or buy it on board.

==Jetstar Group==
In addition to owning 100% of Jetstar Airways in Australia, the Qantas Group owns varying stakes in other Jetstar-branded airlines in the Asia-Pacific region. These airlines represent a strategy to provide better growth for the Qantas Group by accessing the intra-Asia market: exploiting both its faster growth and/or its under-penetration by low-cost airlines.

Qantas partners with local investors as both a means to overcome foreign ownership or traffic rights restrictions and to keep the ventures &quot;capital light&quot;, i.e. reduce the capital investment required by Qantas and keep assets such as aircraft off the Qantas balance sheet.

From 2008 to 2020, the Group also consisted of Jetstar Pacific, a Vietnamese subsidiary which is also co-owned by Vietnam Airlines (nearly 70%). However, since July 2020, this carrier left the Jetstar Group and rebranded to Pacific Airlines.

The Jetstar Group is headed by CEO Stephanie Tully. The Jetstar Group consists of the following airlines:

 The final two aircraft (9V-VLA and 9V-VLB) were transferred from the Valuair AOC to the Jetstar Asia Airways AOC (as 9V-VLE and 9V-VLF) during April 2010. Although Jetstar Asia Airways generally maintains two aircraft in a hybrid Jetstar/Valuair livery, they sit on the Jetstar Asia Airways AOC.

 The Jetstar financial results include Jetstar Airways, Jetstar Asia Airways and Valuair as consolidated entities in the Qantas Group accounts. Despite Qantas owning only a minority stake in Jetstar Asia Airways and Valuair (51% owned and effectively controlled by Singaporean nationals as required under Singapore aviation regulations), Australian accounting standards have required them to be treated as consolidated entities since 8 April 2009. Jetstar Pacific Airlines and Jetstar Japan are treated as investments in associates and not consolidated in the Qantas Group accounts.

<text>Maia Emilia Ninel Morgenstern (; born 1 May 1962) is a Romanian film and stage actress, described by Florin Mitu of AMOS News as &quot;a symbol of Romanian theater and film&quot;. Internationally, she is best known for portraying the Blessed Virgin Mary in Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. In Romania, she has been nationally known since her 1992 role as Nela in &quot;Balanța&quot;, a film known in the United States as &quot;The Oak&quot;. The film is set during the waning days of Communist Romania. She received a star on the Romanian Walk of Fame in Bucharest on 1 May 2011.

==Biography==
Born in Bucharest, Romania, to a Jewish family, she 
attended the Zoia Kosmodeminskaia High School in her native city, and graduated from the Film and Theatre Academy of Bucharest in 1985. She then played at &quot;Teatrul Tineretului&quot; (Youth Theatre) in Piatra Neamț until 1988, and at the &quot;Teatrul Evreiesc de Stat&quot; (State Jewish Theatre) in Bucharest 1988, 1989, and 1990. From 1990 to 1998 she was a member of the company of the National Theatre in Bucharest, and since 1998 of Teatrul Bulandra, also in Bucharest. She continues to act at the Jewish State Theatre, other Bucharest theatres and theatres elsewhere in Romania. Among her notable stage roles in recent years, is a Romanian-language production of &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; (&quot;Îngerul Albastru&quot; in Romanian) at Bucharest&#x27;s Odeon Theatre. In 2001 - 2002 she played, to great critical acclaim, Lola Lola, the character made famous by Marlene Dietrich. At the same time, she also played the role of Kathleen Hogan in a Romanian-language production of Israel Horovitz&#x27;s &quot;Park Your Car in Harvard Yard&quot; at the State Jewish Theatre.

Morgenstern has appeared in numerous films, primarily in Romanian-language roles. In &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, she performs a role in Aramaic, but like the other actors in the cast of that film, she simply memorized her lines phonetically. She reported that she felt really proud to portray the Virgin Mary.

Her surname, Morgenstern, means &quot;Morning Star&quot; in German, is a title of the Virgin Mary, the character she played in &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. Mel Gibson, a devout Traditionalist Catholic, thought this of great significance when casting her. In interviews, she has defended &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; against allegations of antisemitism, saying that the high priest Caiaphas is portrayed not as a representative of the Jewish people, but as a leader of the establishment, adding that &quot;Authorities throughout history have persecuted individuals with revolutionary ideas.&quot;

On 29 March 2021, a Romanian man was arrested after Morgenstern received an email stating &quot;I intend to throw her in the gas chamber&quot;.

==Personal life==
She has been married twice, first to Claudiu Istodor (1983–1999), and then to Dumitru Băltățeanu (2001–2015). She has three children, one of them being actor Tudor Aaron.

==Awards, recognition==
She has won several major awards as an actress: 
* Best Actress for: &quot;Cei care platesc cu viața&quot; (&quot;Those who pay with their lives&quot;, 1991), Romanian Filmmakers Union
*UNITER (Romanian Theatrical Union) Lucia Sturdza Bulandra Prize (1990) for her stage role as Medea in &quot;Trilogia antică&quot; (&quot;Ancient Trilogy&quot;), directed by Andrei Șerban.
* Best Actress for: &quot;Balanța&quot; (1992), European Film Awards
* Best Actress for: &quot;Balanța&quot; (1992), Cinéma Tout Ecran (Geneva Film Festival)
* Best Actress for: &quot;Balanța&quot; (1992), Romanian Filmmakers Union
* UNITER best actress award (1993), for her role in &quot;Ghetto&quot; at the Romanian National Theatre.
* UNITER (1995) award for her performance in the stage production of &quot;&quot;.
* Best Film Actress for: &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004), Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards (EMMA Awards), UK
