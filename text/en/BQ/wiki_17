<text>Durness () is a village and civil parish in the north-west Highlands of Scotland. It lies on the north coast of the country in the traditional county of Sutherland, around north of Inverness. The area is remote, and the parish is huge and sparsely populated, covering an area from east of Loch Eriboll to Cape Wrath, the most north-westerly point of the Scottish mainland.

The population is dispersed and includes a number of townships including Kempie, Eriboll, Laid, , Sangobeg, Leirinmore, Smoo, Sangomore, Durine, Balnakeil and Keoldale.

==Etymology==
The name could be Norse &quot;Dyrnes&quot;, meaning &quot;deer/animal headland&quot;. No one knows for sure where the name derives; it has variously been translated as from &quot;Dorainn nis&quot; tempest point, or &quot;Dhu thir nis&quot; the point of the black land; or from the Norse for deerpoint. Or even from the main village &quot;Durine&quot; which would translate as &quot;Dubh Rinn&quot; the black (or fertile) promontory, with the Norse &quot;ness&quot; tacked onto an existing Gaelic name.

== Prehistory ==
The area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. To the south of the village at the former township of Cnocbreac can be seen the remains of two parallel turf dykes of Neolithic origin, the purpose of which is unknown. Archaeological investigations in 1995 turned up Neolithic, Norse and Iron Age artifacts in four caves (Smoo Cave, Glassknapper&#x27;s Cave, Antler Cave and Wetweather Cave) a few hundred meters from Durness. The majority of the artifacts from the cave were related to Viking/Norse or medieval activity. Fish bones, marine shells, plant remains and mammal and bird bones indicated the processing and consumption of marine and terrestrial foods. Iron slag and boat nails led the archaeologists to surmise that boats were repaired in the sheltered inlet. Four radiocarbon dates from Smoo Cave and Glassknapper&#x27;s Cave provide evidence for use of these sites between the eighth and 11th centuries AD. In May 1991, the body of a young Viking boy was discovered exposed by the erosion of the sand dunes at Faraid Head. At Sangobeg beach, a probably Viking settlement and the body of a prehistoric (170 BCE–30 CE) child was discovered in 2000.

==History==
Durness was formerly a part of the bishopric of Caithness and the old house at Balnakeil was originally the bishop&#x27;s summer residence. The church at Balnakeil dates back to the Culdean monks but the existing ruined church is said to have been built by the monks from Dornoch Cathedral in the 13th century.

At Ceannabeinne lies &quot;Clach a Breitheanas&quot; or the Judgement Stone. This was said to be where judgement was meted out to malefactors and those found guilty were thrown over the cliff to their doom below.

The parish of Durness was for centuries a part of Dùthaich MhicAoidh, the land of the Clan Mackay, who held their title to the land extending from Melvich in the east to Kylesku in the west. The area is also important to the Clan Morrison, who live with their traditional allies, the Clan Mackay. &quot;Many sanguinary battles, still recounted by tradition , were fought between the Mcleods and Macaulays on one side and the Morisons on the other. At last the Morisons were forced to leave Lewis and take refuge with that part of their clan which was settled in Duirness and Edderachyllius, Sutherland, where still, in 1793, the natives were all, except a few, of the three names of Mac Leay, Morison or Mcleod.&quot;

Loch Eriboll was used by the battle fleet of King Haakon of Norway on its way south to the disastrous Battle of Largs in 1266. During the Second World War, the battle cruiser &quot;Jamaica&quot; sustained an outbreak of measles on board and was quarantined in the loch for months. At cessation of hostilities in 1945 it saw the surrender of some 30 German U-boats. During the Second World War, the RAF built a Chain Home radar station at Sango near Durness. After the war there was also a ROTOR radar station at Faraid Head near Balnakeil, part of which is used by the modern military range and the accommodation area is used for various crafts.

In the early 19th century the population of the parish was around 1,100, spread widely throughout scattered small townships. The population today is much diminished, with the whole of the Durness area suffering greatly from the Highland Clearances, the first in 1809 and thereafter throughout the greater part of the 19th century until the Crofting Act of the 1886 finally gave crofters a measure of security of tenure. The Durness Riots of 1841 were caused by a clearance when the women of Ceannabeinne township defied the Sheriff Officer sent to deliver the summons of eviction and subsequent disorder occurred at the village inn in Durness when a second attempt was made, causing the officers to be again run out of town. In the first attempt, in August, 1841, a party of sheriff officers and constables were attacked by a mob of about 400 people who were armed with weapons, at the inn of Durine in the parish of Durness. The whole party were injured by the mob and some of them narrowly escaped with their lives. Their eviction papers were also burned by the mob in the presence of the leading sheriff officer who was of the surname Campbell. The second attempt was made by the police super-intendant, Phillip Mackay, but he was treated in a similar manner and returned home. Mackay made another attempt with a stronger force on 17 September 1841, again consisting of a party of sheriff officers and special constables, arriving the following evening. They were observed approaching and eventually 200 to 300 local people had gathered, all armed with weapons, to oppose them. The mob made a rush to seize Mackay, but they were defeated and Mackay and his men made it to the inn. However, the local mob now with an additional 100 people, smashed the windows and broke down the doors. The constables were all dragged outside and given similar treatment as before, being totally dispersed. The sheriff officers who were in another room were then also dragged outside and dispersed. The locals were later threatened that a military force would be raised against them and did not rise up again.

==Geography==
The main sources of employment in the village are crofting and tourism. It is the largest village in the northwestern corner of Scotland, has a population of around 400, and is on the A838 road. It is located on the north coast between the towns of Thurso, to the east, and Ullapool , to the south. This area is notable for being the most sparsely populated region in Western Europe. Until some 50 years ago, Durness was a predominantly Gaelic speaking area.

==Geology==
The landscape of the Durness area is a stark contrast to the surrounding areas due to a down-faulted, isolated wedge of Cambro-Ordovician Durness Group carbonates, also historically (and often now informally) known as the &#x27;Durness Limestone&#x27;. Although the unit outcrops as far south as Skye, the full sequence can only be seen in the Durness area, hence the name of the unit. This thick sequence (c. ) of dolomites with subordinate limestones and chert is softer than the surrounding hills which are formed of more resistant Lewisian Gneiss or Torridonian sandstones, sometimes capped by Cambrian Quartzite. As a result, the local area is generally flatter and more fertile than other areas in the North West Highlands due to the carbonate bedrock and resultant lime-rich soils.

An unusually wide variety of rock types for such a relatively small area can be found within the parish. This is partly due to extensive faulting in the area which has placed a variety rocks of different ages (Archaean – Ordovician) in contact with one another. A down-faulted section of the Moine Thrust can also be seen in the area at both Faraid Head and Sango Bay despite the main thrust area being found several miles east at Loch Eriboll. The thrust exposures within Sango Bay are the most accessible localities to observe the Moine Thrust Zone. Additionally, Sango Bay (geologically a graben) also exposes some of the best basin bounding fault outcrops in the British Isles.

Faraid Head is also important geologically for one of Scotland&#x27;s largest sand dune systems where the prominent headland is exposed to strong winds, building a variety of sand dunes types up to above sea level. The cliffs on the eastern side of this headland show the only preserved exposures of Moine metasediments west of the main outcrop of the Moine Thrust in Scotland (as a result of thrusting and later normal-faulting) and excellent machair examples have developed between the cliff top and the dunes, partly due to the high sea-shell content of the sands in the Durness area.

As a result, Durness is part of the North West Highlands Geopark and is a popular destination for both postgraduate and undergraduate geology students during the summer.

==Tourism==

Tourists are catered for by a campsite spectacularly sited on the cliffs above the beach (with easy access down to the beach), a hostel operated by Hostelling Scotland (housed in some converted army buildings), bed and breakfast accommodation, and two hotels and restaurants: Mackay&#x27;s and the Smoo Cave Hotel. The village is also used as a base by visitors to Cape Wrath.

The main attractions in Durness are Smoo Cave, a conjoined sea cave and freshwater cave with a small river running through it and a waterfall in wet weather, unspoilt beaches backed by cliffs and the local seabirds, seals, porpoises and minke whales. The surrounding coastline is some of Europe&#x27;s most isolated and spectacular, with the nearby Clo Mor Cliffs being the highest on the British mainland, at high.

Balnakeil Old Church, is a scheduled monument with the grave of Donuill Mac Morraichaidh, a serial bandit and murderer, inside one wall of the church so, it is said, &quot;that his enemies couldn&#x27;t walk over his grave&quot;. The area around Loch Croispol and Loch Borrallie abounds in archeological interest, from brochs to round houses to medieval and pre-clearances settlements.

The Balnakeil Craft Village can be found approximately outside Durness and is a collection of former MoD units dating from the 1950s, which now house various independent shops.

==Culture and community==
Durness is the birthplace and burial site of the poet Rob Donn, born at Achnacaillich in Strathmore in 1714. The Gaelic publication &quot;Am Fèillire&quot; remarked, in 1875, that he was known for being shrewd and satirical, as well as moral and mannerly.

== John Lennon ==
In 2007 Durness hosted the &quot;John Lennon Northern Lights Festival&quot;, a celebration of music, poetry, theatre and other cultural activities in celebration of the spirit of John Lennon who, when in childhood, took summer holidays in the village. Lennon returned for a visit in 1969 with Yoko Ono and their children but the visit was cut short when Lennon drove his car off the road by Loch Eriboll. The track &quot;In My Life&quot; from &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is said to be based on a poem about Durness which Lennon wrote on a teenage holiday in the area, although most of the original poem&#x27;s meaning was lost during songwriting with Paul McCartney. A monument dedicated to John Lennon has been erected in a memorial garden by the village hall and has three large stone slabs inscribed with lyrics from “In My Life”. The house where he stayed has now been demolished and replaced with a modern house. A plaque on the gable of the new house reads “John Lennon 1940-1980 Singer and Songwriter and member of The Beatles Spent many childhood holidays here”.

The Balnakeil craft village, established in 1963 on an unused military radar station near to Durness was the subject of a 1974 BBC documentary &quot;The Road to Balnakeil&quot; by Derek Cooper. Ceramic artist Lotte Glob was among early residents. The village is home to well-known chocolate manufacturers Cocoa Mountain.

There are claims that the rugged scenery around Durness and Cape Wrath may have inspired Tolkien in creating his Middle Earth epics.

A bench placed on the shore of Loch Borralie by actress Juliet Stevenson commemorates her elder brother Johnny who died in a car accident at the Kyle of Durness in 2000.

==Transport==
Durness is on the A838 road. This links the parish to the A836 at Tongue to the east, and loops around the coast through Rhiconich near Kinlochbervie, to meet the A836 again north of Lairg, which generally runs to Bonar Bridge and the south. The road is single track along most of its length. Bus services are sparse in the area, although one bus a day links Durness with the Far North railway line at Lairg railway station. This provides rail services north to Wick and south to Inverness.

==Education==
Durness primary school educates children from nursery age to age 11. In the 2012–13 academic year the school had 22 children enrolled, a figure which is predicted to decline to 13 by 2026–27. Children transfer to Kinlochbervie High School which opened in the 1990s. Before this school opened children had to lodge during the week to attend schools at Dornoch Academy or Golspie High School.

==Military Presence==
Cape Wrath, to the west of the parish across the Kyle of Durness is the site of the Cape Wrath Training Area, a military live firing range. The area is used for gunnery practice by naval and air forces as well as a training area for land forces. It is the only military firing range in the UK where aircraft are allowed to deliver bombs.

<doc id="490007" wikidata="Q3630915" url="?curid=490007" title="Hot Autumn">
<text>The Hot Autumn () of 1969–70 is a term used for a series of large strikes in the factories and industrial centers of Northern Italy, in which workers demanded better pay and better conditions. During 1969 and 1970 there were over 440 hours of strikes in the region. The decrease in the flow of labour migration from Southern Italy had resulted in nearly full employment levels in the northern part of the country, meaning that the workforce there now had the leverage to start exercising its influence.

==Overview==
Due to increased literacy levels in general and especially among workers, following a wave of student protests influenced by similar events in May 1968 in France, leftist students started agitating for social reforms and increased class consciousness. Workers joined in on these protests and began to demand increased wages. Many of them were being laid off because of increased efficiencies in factories. Not all of the workers&#x27; demands for collective control came about, but more basic demands such as a 40-hour work week and increased pay were achieved.

The reasons for discontent varied - while the usual demands for better pay and working conditions were a factor, the tensions were also increased by the fact that much of the workforce had migrated from the much poorer South. They were generally unhappy at the society that had forced them to leave their homes in search of work, and wanted to get back at the employers who, in their view, had been exploiting them with lower than average wages for so many years.

The phrase &quot;autunno caldo&quot; has since been applied in the Italian press to describe other periods marked by significant strikes, although in later decades, such seasonal strikes have more often been directed against government&#x27;s budget plans, which are usually planned and publicly debated during the autumn months.

The period known as the &quot;Hot Autumn&quot; in Italy began in the summer of 1968, which saw a series of strikes as workers demanded a flat-rate pay rise. The unrest that lasted from 1966 to 1972 began in the universities. These student movements set a precedent with their use of disruptive forms of protest which included strikes, demonstrations, and occupation of university buildings. Students formed assemblies where it was a not only a mass meeting, but a body which made binding decisions. This student movement eventually shifted from university issues and moved toward industrial struggles. Examples of the shift to industrial struggles can be seen through the protests that occurred in the car factories of Turin in 1969. 

Turin was the center of FIAT factories, and became the focus of continual wildcat strikes. Workers were supported by university students of the New Left, and demanded wage increases and the same conditions as white-collar workers within the company. The protests were also a scene of major violence as some protests drew the hostility of the police. A strike against high rents outside the factory gates in Corso Traiano was attacked by the police and incidents like this led to a running battle with the police. 

These protests were also influenced by the PCI, and often changed from Leninist to autonomist and &quot;operaista&quot; or from parties to activist networks. The period of the &quot;Hot Autumn&quot; was an attack on the established power relations in Italy and it was very explosive. The &quot;Hot Autumn&quot; was followed by the &quot;Years of Lead&quot;, which was a period of far-right and far-left violence including bombings, shootings and kidnappings.

==Context==

The Hot Autumn occurred at a time of major weakness within the Italian government. The Christian Democracy (Italy) had been in office for 20 years. During the latter stages of that time period, there was an overall degeneration, as people looked to vote for politicians who could give them favors, as the party could not be voted out. This overall clientelism within the Italian government led to both corruption and ineffective governance. The issues of the &quot;Hot Autumn&quot; can also be tied to the Confederazione Italiana dei Sindacati Lavoratori (Italian Confederation of Workers&#x27; Trade Unions, or CISL). The CISL was based on two principles, which were the importance of firm-level union activity, and the professionalization of union activists. 

By the 1970s and 1980s, it can be seen that the CISL was a bureaucratic and politicized organization. It was tied to factions of the Christian Democratic Party, where the passing of favors was how the Italian government was run. Economic problems also surrounded the formation and fallout of the &quot;Hot Autumn&quot; period. In the six years following 1969 there was a massive redistribution of income, and the share of GNP accruing to dependent labor went from 57 to 73 percent. Redistributing that income led to increased consumption and reduced savings and this was a problem already in debt. The &quot;Hot Autumn&quot; protests started at the university, but their transition to the industrial stage pointed out the weak governance of the first republic, for economic policies were ineffective and sparked many of the frustrations of the blue-collar working class.

<doc id="490008" wikidata="Q2144175" url="?curid=490008" title="Diving weighting system">
<text>A diving weighting system is ballast weight added to a diver or diving equipment to counteract excess buoyancy. They may be used by divers or on equipment such as diving bells, submersibles or camera housings.

Divers wear diver weighting systems, weight belts or weights to counteract the buoyancy of other diving equipment, such as diving suits and aluminium diving cylinders, and buoyancy of the diver. The scuba diver must be weighted sufficiently to be slightly negatively buoyant at the end of the dive when most of the breathing gas has been used, and needs to maintain neutral buoyancy at safety or obligatory decompression stops. During the dive, buoyancy is controlled by adjusting the volume of air in the buoyancy compensation device (BCD) and, if worn, the dry suit, in order to achieve negative, neutral, or positive buoyancy as needed. The amount of weight required is determined by the maximum overall positive buoyancy of the fully equipped but unweighted diver anticipated during the dive, with an empty buoyancy compensator and normally inflated dry suit. This depends on the diver&#x27;s mass and body composition, buoyancy of other diving gear worn (especially the diving suit), water salinity, weight of breathing gas consumed, and water temperature. It normally is in the range of to . The weights can be distributed to trim the diver to suit the purpose of the dive.

Surface-supplied divers may be more heavily weighted to facilitate underwater work, and may be unable to achieve neutral buoyancy, and rely on the diving stage, bell, umbilical, lifeline, shotline or jackstay for returning to the surface.

Freedivers may also use weights to counteract buoyancy of a wetsuit. However, they are more likely to weight for neutral buoyancy at a specific depth, and their weighting must take into account not only the compression of the suit with depth, but also the compression of the air in their lungs, and the consequent loss of buoyancy. As they have no decompression obligation, they do not have to be neutrally buoyant near the surface at the end of a dive.

If the weights have a method of quick release, they can provide a useful rescue mechanism: they can be dropped in an emergency to provide an instant increase in buoyancy which should return the diver to the surface. Dropping weights increases the risk of barotrauma and decompression sickness due to the possibility of an uncontrollable ascent to the surface. This risk can only be justified when the emergency is life-threatening or the risk of decompression sickness is small, as is the case in freediving and scuba diving when the dive is well short of the no-decompression limit for the depth. Often divers take great care to ensure the weights are not dropped accidentally, and heavily weighted divers may arrange their weights so subsets of the total weight can be dropped individually, allowing for a somewhat more controlled emergency ascent.

The weights are generally made of lead because of its high density, reasonably low cost, ease of casting into suitable shapes, and resistance to corrosion. The lead can be cast in blocks, cast shapes with slots for straps, or shaped as pellets known as &quot;shot&quot; and carried in bags. There is some concern that lead diving weights may constitute a toxic hazard to users and environment, but little evidence of significant risk.

==Function and use of weights==
Diver weighting systems have two functions; ballast, and trim adjustment. 

===Ballast===
The primary function of diving weights is as ballast, to prevent the diver from floating at times when he or she wishes to remain at depth.

====Freediving====
In freediving (breathhold) the weight system is almost exclusively a weight belt with quick release buckle, as the emergency release of the weights will usually allow the diver to float to the surface even if unconscious, where there is at least a chance of rescue. The weights are used mainly to neutralise the buoyancy of the exposure suit, as the diver is nearly neutral in most cases, and there is little other equipment carried. The weights required depend almost entirely on the buoyancy of the suit. Most freedivers will weight themselves to be positively buoyant at the surface, and use only enough weight to minimise the effort required to swim down against the buoyancy at the start of a dive, while retaining sufficient buoyancy at maximum depth to not require too much effort to swim back up to where the buoyancy becomes positive again. As a corollary to this practice, freedivers will use as thin a wetsuit as comfortably possible, to minimise buoyancy changes with depth due to suit compression.

====Scuba diving====
Buoyancy control is considered both an essential skill and one of the most difficult for the novice to master. Lack of proper buoyancy control increases the risk of disturbing or damaging the surroundings, and is a source of additional and unnecessary physical effort to maintain precise depth, which also increases stress.

The scuba diver generally has an operational need to control depth without resorting to a line to the surface or holding onto a structure or landform, or resting on the bottom. This requires the ability to achieve neutral buoyancy at any time during a dive, otherwise the effort expended to maintain depth by swimming against the buoyancy difference will both task load the diver and require an otherwise unnecessary expenditure of energy, increasing air consumption, and increasing the risk of loss of control and escalation to an accident. Maintaining depth by finning necessarily directs part of fin thrust upwards or downwards, and when near the bottom, downward thrust can disturb the benthos and stir up silt. The risk of fin-strike damage is also significant. 

A further requirement for scuba diving in most circumstances, is the ability to achieve significant positive buoyancy at any point of a dive. When at the surface, this is a standard procedure to enhance safety and convenience, and underwater it is generally a response to an emergency.

The average human body with a relaxed lungful of air is close to neutral buoyancy. If the air is exhaled, most people will sink in fresh water, and with full lungs, most will float in seawater. The amount of weight required to provide neutral buoyancy to the naked diver is usually trivial, though there are some people who require several kilograms of weight to become neutral in seawater due to low average density and large size. This is usually the case with people with a large proportion of body fat. As the diver is nearly neutral, most ballasting is needed to compensate for the buoyancy of the diver&#x27;s equipment.

The main components of the average scuba diver&#x27;s equipment which are positively buoyant are the components of the exposure suit. The two most commonly used exposure suit types are the dry suit and the wet suit. Both of these types of exposure suit use gas spaces to provide insulation, and these gas spaces are inherently buoyant. The buoyancy of a wet suit will decrease significantly with an increase in depth as the ambient pressure causes the volume of the gas bubbles in the neoprene to decrease. Measurements of volume change of neoprene foam used for wetsuits under hydrostatic compression show that about 30% of the volume, and therefore 30% of surface buoyancy, is lost in about the first 10 m, another 30% by about 60 m, and the volume appears to stabilise at about 65% loss by about 100 m. The total buoyancy loss of a wetsuit is proportional to the initial uncompressed volume. An average person has a surface area of about 2 m2, so the uncompressed volume of a full one piece 6 mm thick wetsuit will be in the order of 1.75 x 0.006 = 0.0105 m3, or roughly 10 litres. The mass will depend on the specific formulation of the foam, but will probably be in the order of 4 kg, for a net buoyancy of about 6 kg at the surface. Depending on the overall buoyancy of the diver, this will generally require 6 kg of additional weight to bring the diver to neutral buoyancy to allow reasonably easy descent The volume lost at 10 m is about 3litres, or 3 kg of buoyancy, rising to about 6 kg buoyancy lost at about 60 m. This could nearly double for a large person wearing a two-piece suit for cold water. This loss of buoyancy must be balanced by inflating the buoyancy compensator to maintain neutral buoyancy at depth.
A dry suit will also compress with depth, but the air space inside is continuous and can be topped up from a cylinder or vented to maintain an approximately constant volume. A large part of the ballast used by a diver is to balance the buoyancy of this gas space, but if the dry suit has a catastrophic flood, much of this buoyancy may be lost, and some way to compensate is necessary.

Another significant issue in open circuit scuba diver weighting is that the breathing gas is used up during a dive, and this gas has weight, so the total weight of the cylinder decreases, while its volume remains almost unchanged. As the diver needs to be neutral at the end of the dive, particularly at shallow depths for obligatory or safety decompression stops, sufficient ballast weight must be carried to allow for this reduction in weight of gas supply. (the density of air at normal atmospheric pressure is approximately 1.2 kg/m3, or approximately 0.075 lb/ft3) The amount of weight needed to compensate for gas use is easily calculable once the free gas volume and density are known.

Most of the rest of the diver&#x27;s equipment is negatively buoyant or nearly neutral, and more importantly, does not change in buoyancy during a dive, so its overall influence on buoyancy is static.

While it is possible to calculate the required ballast given the diver and all his or her equipment, this is not done in practice, as all the values would have to be measured accurately. The practical procedure is known as a buoyancy check, and is done by wearing all the equipment, with the tank(s) nearly empty, and the buoyancy compensator empty, in shallow water, and adding or removing weight until the diver is neutrally buoyant. The weight should then be distributed on the diver to provide correct trim, and a sufficient part of the weight should be carried in such a way that it can be removed quickly in an emergency to provide positive buoyancy at any point in the dive. This is not always possible, and in those cases an alternative method of providing positive buoyancy should be used.

A diver ballasted by following this procedure will be negatively buoyant during most of the dive unless the buoyancy compensator is used, to an extent which depends on the amount of breathing gas carried. A recreational dive using a single cylinder may use between 2 and 3 kg of gas during the dive, which is easy to manage, and provided that there is no decompression obligation, end-dive buoyancy is not critical. A long or deep technical dive may use 6 kg of back gas and another 2 to 3 kg of decompression gas. If there is a problem during the dive and reserves must be used, this could increase by up to 50%, and the diver must be able to stay down at the shallowest decompression stop. The extra weight and therefore negative buoyancy at the start of the dive could easily be as much as 13 kg for a diver carrying four cylinders. The buoyancy compensator is partially inflated when needed to support this negative buoyancy, and as breathing gas is used up during the dive, the volume of the buoyancy compensator will be reduced, by venting as required. The inconvenience of additional weight and managing the gas required to compensate for it in a dive that goes according to plan is the price that must be paid for the ability to decompress after an emergency which uses up most of the gas. There is little value in having enough gas to avoid drowning if the diver is killed or crippled by decompression sickness instead.

Examples:
* The common 80 ft3 (11 litre, 207 bar) cylinder carries about of air when full, so the diver should start the dive about negative and use about 1/10 ft3 (2.7 L)of air in the BCD to compensate at the start of a dive.
* A twin 12.2 litre 230 bar set carries about of Nitrox when full, so the diver should start the dive about negative and use about of gas in the BCD at the start of the dive.
* A twin 12.2 litre 230 bar with an 11 litre 207 bar deep deco mix and a 5.5 litre 207 bar shallow deco gas will carry of gas, and while it is unlikely that all will be used on the dive, it is possible, and the diver should be able to remain at the correct depth for decompression until all the gas is used up.
====Optimum weighting====

Optimum weighting for scuba allows the diver to achieve neutral buoyancy at any time during a dive while there is still usable breathing gas in any of the cylinders carried, using the least amount of ballast. Deviations from this optimum either make the diver buoyant while there is still usable breathing gas, which is a disadvantage in emergencies where decompression stops are required, or make the diver more negatively buoyant than necessary at the start of the dive with full cylinders, necessitating more gas in the buoyancy compensator for most of the dive, which is more sensitive to buoyancy changes with change in depth, and may make a larger buoyancy compensator necessary. These disadvantages can be compensated by skill, but more attention and effort is required throughout the dive.

====Surface-supplied diving====
In surface-supplied diving, and particularly in saturation diving, the loss of weights followed by positive buoyancy can expose the diver to potentially fatal decompression injury. Consequently, weight systems for surface-supplied diving where the diver is transported to the worksite by a diving bell or stage, are usually not provided with a quick-release system.

Much of the work done by surface-supplied divers is on the bottom, and weighted boots may be used to allow the diver to walk upright on the bottom. When working in this mode, several kilograms beyond the requirement for neutralising buoyancy may be useful, so that the diver is reasonably steady on the bottom and can exert useful force when working.

The lightweight demand helmets in general use by surface-supplied divers are integrally ballasted for neutral buoyancy in the water, so they do not float off the diver&#x27;s head or pull upwards on the neck, but the larger volume free-flow helmets would be too heavy and cumbersome if they had all the required weight built in. Therefore, they are either ballasted after dressing the diver by fastening weights to the lower parts of the helmet assembly, so the weight is carried on the shoulders when out of the water, or the helmet may be held down by a jocking strap and the harness weights provide the ballast.

The traditional copper helmet and corselet were generally weighted by suspending a large weight from support points on the front and back of the corselet, and the diver often also wore weighted boots to assist in remaining upright. The US Navy Mk V standard diving system used a heavy weighted belt buckled around the waist, suspended by shoulder straps which crossed over the breastplate of the helmet, directly transferring the load to the buoyant helmet when immersed, but with a relatively low centre of gravity. Combined with lacing of the suit legs and heavy weighted shoes, this reduced the risk of inversion accidents.

===Trim===

Trim is the diver&#x27;s attitude in the water, in terms of balance and alignment with the direction of motion. Optimum trim depends on the task at hand. For recreational divers this is usually swimming horizontally or observing the environment without making contact with benthic organisms. Ascent and descent at neutral buoyancy can be controlled well in horizontal or head-up trim, and descent can be most energy efficient head down, if the diver can effectively equalise the ears in this position. Freediving descents are usually head down, as the diver is usually buoyant at the start of the dive, and must fin downwards. Professional divers usually have work to do at the bottom, often in a fixed location, which is usually easier in upright trim, and some diving equipment is more comfortable and safer to use when relatively upright. 

Accurately controlled trim reduces horizontal swimming effort, as it reduces the sectional area of the diver passing through the water. A slight head down trim is recommended to reduce downward directed fin thrust during finning, and this reduces silting and fin impact with the bottom.

Trim weighting is mainly of importance to the free-swimming diver, and within this category is used extensively by scuba divers to allow the diver to remain horizontal in the water without effort. This ability is of great importance for both convenience and safety, and also reduces the environmental impact of divers on fragile benthic communities.

The free-swimming diver may need to trim erect or inverted at times, but in general, a horizontal trim has advantages both for reduction of drag when swimming horizontally, and for observing the bottom. A horizontal trim allows the diver to direct propulsive thrust from the fins directly to the rear, which minimises disturbance of sediments on the bottom, and reduces the risk of striking delicate benthic organisms with the fins. A stable horizontal trim requires that diver&#x27;s centre of gravity is directly below the centre of buoyancy (the centroid). Small errors can be compensated fairly easily, but large offsets may make it necessary for the diver to constantly exert significant effort towards maintaining the desired attitude, if it is actually possible. 

The position of the centre of buoyancy is largely beyond the control of the diver, though some control of suit volume is possible, the cylinder(s) may be shifted in the harness by a small amount, and the volume distribution of the buoyancy compensator has a large influence when inflated. Most of the control of trim available to the diver is in the positioning of ballast weights. The main ballast weights therefore should be placed as far as possible to provide an approximately neutral trim, which is usually possible by wearing the weights around the waist or just above the hips on a weight belt, or in weight pockets provided in the buoyancy compensator jacket or harness for this purpose. Fine tuning of trim can be done by placing smaller weights along the length of the diver to bring the centre of gravity to the desired position. There are several ways this can be done.

Ankle weights provide a large lever arm for a small amount of weight and are very effective at correcting head-down trim problems, but the addition of mass to the feet increases the work of propulsion significantly. This may not be noticed on a relaxed dive, where there is no need to swim far or fast, but if there is an emergency and the diver needs to swim hard, ankle weights will be a significant handicap, particularly if the diver is marginally fit for the conditions.

Tank bottom weights provide a much shorter lever arm, so need to be a much larger proportion of the total ballast, but do not interfere with propulsive efficiency the way ankle weights do. There are not really any other convenient places below the weight belt to add trim weights, so the most effective option is to carry the main weights as low as necessary, by using a suitable harness or integrated weight pocket buoyancy compensator which actually allows the weights to be placed correctly, so there is no need for longitudinal trim correction.

A less common problem is found when rebreathers have a counterlung towards the top of the torso. In this case there may be a need to attach weights near the counterlung. This is usually not a problem, and weight pockets for this purpose are often built into the rebreather harness or casing, and if necessary weights can be attached to the harness shoulder straps.

==Types of weight==
All or part of the weighting system may be carried in such a way that it can be quickly and easily jettisoned by the diver to increase buoyancy, the rest is usually attached more securely.

===Ditchable weights===
Breathhold and scuba divers generally carry some or all of their weights in a way that can be quickly and easily removed while under water. Removal of these weights should ensure that the diver can surface and remain positively buoyant at the surface. The technique for shedding weights in an emergency is a basic skill of scuba diving, which is trained at entry level. Research performed in 1976 analyzing diving accidents noted that in majority of diving accidents, divers failed to release their weight belts. Later evaluations in 2003 and 2004 both showed that failure to ditch the weight remained a problem.

====Weight belt====
Weight belts are the most common weighting system currently in use for recreational diving. Weight belts are often made of tough nylon webbing, but other materials such as rubber can be used. Weight belts for scuba and breathhold diving are generally fitted with a quick release buckle to allow the dumping of weight rapidly in an emergency.

A belt made of rubber with traditional pin buckle is called a &quot;Marseillaise belt&quot;. These belts are popular with freedivers as the rubber contracts on descent as the diving suit and lungs are compressed, keeping the belt tight throughout the dive.

The most common design of weight used with a belt consists of rectangular lead blocks with rounded edges and corners and two slots in them threaded onto the belt. These blocks can be coated in plastic, which further increases corrosion resistance. Coated weights are often marketed as being less abrasive to wetsuits. The weights may be constrained from sliding along the webbing by the use of metal or plastic belt sliders. This style of weight is generally about . Larger &quot;hip weights&quot; are usually curved for a better fit, and tend to be . 

Another popular style has a single slot through which the belt can be threaded. These are sometimes locked in position by squeezing the weight to grip the webbing, but this makes them difficult to remove when less weight is needed.

There are also weight designs which may be added to the belt by clipping on when needed.
Some weightbelts contain pouches to contain lead weights or round lead shot: this system allows the diver to add or remove weight more easily than with weights threaded onto the belt. The use of shot can also be more comfortable, as the shot conforms to the diver&#x27;s body. Weight belts using shot are called shot belts. Each shot pellet should be coated to prevent corrosion by sea water, as use of uncoated shotgun shot for sea diving would result in the lead eventually corroding into powdery lead chloride
====BCD integrated weights====

These are stored in pockets built into the buoyancy control device. Often a velcro flap or plastic clip holds the weights in place. The weights may also be contained in zippered or velcroed pouches that slot into special pockets in the BCD. The weight pouches often have handles, which must be pulled to drop the weights in an emergency or to remove the weights when exiting the water. Some designs also have smaller &quot;trim pouches&quot; located higher in the BCD, which may help the diver maintain neutral attitude in the water. Trim pouches typically can not be ditched quickly, and are designed to hold only 1-2 pounds (0.5–1 kg) each. Many integrated systems cannot carry as much weight as a separate weight belt: a typical capacity is 6 kg per pocket, with two pockets available. This may not be sufficient to counteract the buoyancy of dry suits with thick undergarments used in cold water.

Some BCD harness systems include a crotch strap to prevent the BCD from sliding up the wearer when inflated, or down when inverted, due to the weights.

====Weight harness====
A weight harness usually consists of a belt around the waist holding pouches for the weights, with shoulder straps for extra support and security. Often a velcro flap holds the weights in place. They have handles, which must be pulled to drop the weights in an emergency or to remove the weights when exiting the water. A weight harness allows the weights to be comfortably carried lower on the body than a weight belt, which must be high enough to be supported by the hips. This is an advantage for divers who have no discernible waist, or whose waist is too high to trim correctly if a weight belt is worn. These advantages may also be available on some styles of integrated BC weights. A weight harness may also incorporate a crotch strap or straps to prevent weight shift if the diver is in a steep head down posture.

====Clip-on weights====
These are weights which attach to the harness directly, but are removable by disengaging the clip mechanism. They can also be used to temporarily increase the weight of a conventional weight belt. Various sizes have been available, ranging from around 0.5 to 5 kg or more. The larger models are intended as ditchable primary weights, and are used in the same way as BCD integral weights or weight harness weighs, but clipped to the backplate or sidemount harness webbing, and the smaller versions are also useful at trim weights.

====Backpack weight pouch====
Some rebreathers (e.g. the Siebe Gorman CDBA) have a pouch containing lead balls each a bit over an inch diameter. The diver can release them by pulling a cord.

===Fixed weights===
Surface-supplied divers often carry their weights securely attached to reduce the risk of accidentally dropping them during a dive and losing control of their buoyancy. These may be carried on a weight belt with a secure buckle, supported by a weight harness, connected directly to the diving safety harness, or suspended from the corselet of the helmet. Heavily weighted footwear may also be used to stabilise the diver in an upright position.

In addition to the weight that can be dropped easily (&#x27;ditched&#x27;), some scuba divers add additional fixed weights to their gear, either to reduce the weight placed on the belt, which can cause lower back pain, or to shift the diver&#x27;s center of mass to achieve the optimum position in the water.
* Tank weights are attached to the diving cylinder to shift the center of mass backward and towards the head or feet, depending on placement.
** V-weights are long, narrow, weights which are carried in the groove between twinned cylinders. They may be carried singly or as a pair. Traditionally wedge sectioned lead castings, but also found in solid cylindrical format and as long narrow webbing weight pockets filled with shot.
** Tank trim weights are smaller weights , usually strapped towards the base of an aluminium cylinder to prevent it from trimming base-upward in seawater when side- or sling-mounted, when the gas is used up.
* Ankle weights, which are typically about 1 lb./0.5 kg of shot, are used to counteract the positive buoyancy of diving suit leggings, made worse in drysuits by the migration of the internal bubble of air to the feet, and positively buoyant fins. Some divers prefer negatively buoyant fins. The additional effort needed when finning with ankle weights or heavy fins increases the diver&#x27;s gas consumption.
* Metal backplates made from stainless steel, which may be used with wing style buoyancy compensators, move the center of mass upward and backward. Some backplates are fitted with an additional weight, often mounted in the central channel, also called a keel weight or a p-weight.
* Steel diving cylinders are preferred over aluminium cylinders by some divers—particularly cold water divers who must wear a suit that increases their overall buoyancy—because of their negative buoyancy. Most steel tanks stay negatively buoyant even when empty, aluminium tanks may become positively buoyant as the gas they contain is used. High-pressure (300bar) steel tanks are significantly negative.

==Hazards==
There are several operational hazards associated with diving weights:
* Over-weighting leading to inability to ascend or remain at the surface, or difficulties in ascent and buoyancy control. If severe, it may be necessary to ditch weights to get to the surface.
* Under-weighting leading to inability to descend or remain at a required depth. While inability to descend at the start of a dive may be considered an inconvenience, the inability to maintain depth at a required decompression stop at the end of the dive may put the diver at a severe risk of decompression sickness. 
* Inability or failure to ditch weight to establish buoyancy in an emergency. In an out of air emergency there may not be gas available to inflate the buoyancy compensator if it has been allowed to be insufficiently inflated. The only option left to reach the surface may be to ditch weights. A similar need may arise at the surface if there is a major loss of buoyancy. Occasionally a diver at the side of the boat will remove the scuba set with buoyancy compensator before passing up their weight belt, and then find it impossible to remain afloat because they are over-weighted. If they fail to grab the boat or ditch the belt the risk of drowning is high. 
* Loss of weight at depth at the wrong time. Ditching weights at depth to establish positive buoyancy will generally prevent a properly controlled ascent. The risk of drowning due to running out of breathing gas is exchanged for the risk of decompression sickness. Accidental loss of weights when there is no emergency will cause an emergency if there is a decompression obligation.
* Loss, damage or injury caused by mishandling. When passing the weights to a person on the boat, there is a risk that the weights may be dropped, and may hit the diver, or someone&#x27;s foot, demand valve, mask or camera, or may drop overboard to be lost, or possibly hit a diver under the boat. 
* Discomfort or stress injury related to weight distribution and support. A weight belt hanging from the small of the back of a horizontal diver to counteract suit buoyancy spread over the full length of the diver can cause lower back pain. When walking on land before and after a dive, the weight belt may exert painful pressure on the hip joints. 
* Additional work load due to sub-optimal distribution. The work of finning will generally be increased by using ankle weights which must be accelerated for every kick. When this is combined with other effects increasing the workload on the diver, it may cumulatively exceed the work capacity of the diver and result in a positive feedback loop of buildup of carbon dioxide.
Buoyancy and weighting problems have been implicated in a relatively high proportion of scuba diving fatalities. A relatively large number of bodies have been recovered with all weights still in place.

==Materials==
The most common material for personal dive weights is cast lead. The primary reason for using lead is its high density, as well as its relatively low melting point, low cost and easy availability compared to other high density materials. It is also resistant to corrosion in fresh and salt water. Most dive weights are cast by foundries and sold by dive shops to divers in a range of sizes, but some are made by divers for their own use. Scrap lead from sources such as fishing sinkers and wheel balance weights can be easily cast by a hobbyist in relatively cheap re-usable moulds, though this may expose them to vaporized lead fumes.

===Heavy metal toxicity===
Although lead is the least expensive dense (SG=11.34) material available, it is a toxic substance causing biological damage to wildlife and humans. The Centers for Disease Control has stated that no safe level of lead exposure in children has been determined, and that once lead has been absorbed into the body, its effects cannot be corrected. Even a very small amount of exposure causes a permanent reduction in intelligence, ability to focus attention, and academic ability. Lead can be inhaled or ingested as either a metal powder or powdered corrosion products, however most lead salts have very low solubility in water, and pure lead corrodes very slowly in seawater. Absorption through skin is not likely for metallic lead and inorganic corrosion products.

Although it is inexpensive to recycle lead from other sources into homemade dive weights, pure lead melts at and releases fumes at . The fumes will form oxides in the air and settle as dust on nearby surfaces. Even with good ventilation there will be lead oxide dust in the lead melting area.

Solid block weights can corrode and be damaged when dropped or impacting other weights. In flexible bag weights, the small pieces of lead shot will rub together when handled and used, releasing lead dust and corrosion products into the water. The amount of lead lost to the water is roughly proportional to the total surface area of the weights, and the amount of motion between contact surfaces and is greater for smaller sizes of shot.

Solubility of lead salts in seawater is low, though there is a significant role played by natural organic matter in complexing dissolved lead, and oceanic lead concentrations typically range from 1 to 36 ng/L, with from 50 to 300 ng/L in coastal waters affected by anthropogenic activities.

Diving is also sometimes practiced in swimming pools for training and exercise. Swimming pools can be contaminated by lead weights. Many divers using the same pool with lead weights will over time increase the lead contamination of the pool water until the water is changed.

There are no published studies on lead absorption by divers or diving support personnel due to handling weights, which suggests that it has not been considered a problem by diving medical experts or the occupational health and safety authorities.

===Alternative materials===
Other heavy metals have been considered as an alternative to lead. One example is bismuth which has a similar density (SG=9.78) and a low melting point. It is less toxic, and its salts are highly insoluble which limits absorption by the body. Tungsten (SG=19.25) is another possible replacement for lead, but it is very expensive by comparison, both as a material and to manufacture in suitable shapes.

Non-toxic materials such as iron (SG=7.87) can be used in place of lead and would not cause poisoning and contamination. However, the density of most such materials is significantly lower, so the dive weight needs to be of larger volume and therefore greater mass, to equal the negative buoyancy of the mass of lead it replaces. A lead weight of 1 kg would be replaced by an iron weight of 1 × (7.87/11.34) × ((11.34-1)/(7.87-1)) = 1.044 kg, a 4.4% additional load for the diver when out of the water.

Iron is also corroded much more easily in seawater than lead, and would need some form of protection to prevent rusting. Alloys of stainless steel are more resistant to corrosion, but, for the cheaper grades, need to be rinsed with freshwater after use to prevent corrosion in storage. The cost of shaping alternative materials may be considerably greater, particularly for small quantities. Stainless steel and tungsten dive weights for example are currently only obtainable by milling down a solid metal stock material in block or cylinder form, into the required shape. Direct casting of some of these materials in a foundry is possible, but would require high volume production for the casting processes to be cost effective.

===Encapsulation of lead weights===
Lead weights can be coated with a protective outer layer such as plastic or paint, and this is commonly used for lead abatement. This prevents the lead from corroding or being ground into dust by rubbing, and helps to cushion impacts. However the protection is reduced if the coating is cracked or otherwise damaged. Soft plastics may become brittle over time due to UV degradation from sunlight and loss of plasticizers, leading to cracking and shattering. Encapsulation materials are usually of near neutral buoyancy in water, and reduce the average density of the weights, making the weights slightly less effective, and increasing the overall weight in air of the diving equipment.

==Ballast on other diving and support equipment== 
*Clump weights for bells and stages:– A clump weight is a large ballast weight suspended from a cable which runs down from one side of the launch and recovery gantry, through a pair of sheaves on the sides of the weight, and up the other side back to the gantry, where it is fastened. The weight hangs freely between the two parts of the cable, and due to its weight, hangs horizontally and keeps the cable under tension with the vertical parts parallel. The bell hangs between the vertical parts of the cable, and has a fairlead on each side which slides along the cable as it is lowered or lifted. Deployment of the bell is by a primary lifting cable attached to the top. As the bell is lowered, the fairleads prevent it from rotating on the deployment cable, which would put twist into the umbilical and risk loops or snagging. The clump weight cables therefore function as guidelines or rails along which the bell is lowered to the workplace, and raised back to the platform.
*Releasable ballast on closed bells, atmospheric diving suits, remotely operated underwater vehicles and submersibles:– Solid weights which can be released by the operator, or automatically release in a power failure, to achieve positive buoyancy in an emergency, allowing the unit to float back to the surface. 
*Trim weights on atmospheric diving suits, remotely operated underwater vehicles, and submersibles, used to compensate for variations in payload.
*Ballast and trim weights on camera equipment and diver propulsion vehicles. Camera and light assemblies are often ballasted or provided with rigid buoyancy to provide neutral buoyancy and reasonably stable trim, as this makes it easier to hold the camera in place when setting up a shot. Similar considerations apply to video cameras, which must often be kept steady and in focus for relatively long periods. Diver propulsion vehicles are ballasted to neutral buoyancy and level trim to make it easier to steer them for long periods and at varying speeds, a procedure which is generally done using only one hand, so that the other is available for other work.

===Notes===
 Derivation of formula for equivalent apparent weight in water.

:Density = mass/volume, ρ = m/V so m = ρ × V
:Buoyancy in water: B = (ρ - ρwater) × V × g, where g = gravitational acceleration at earth&#x27; surface
:For two objects of different densities but the same buoyancy in water: B1 = B2 so (ρ1 - ρwater) × V1 × g = (ρ2 - ρwater) × V2 × g (g can be dropped from both sides)
::therefore: V1 = V2 × (ρ2 - ρwater) ÷ (ρ1 - ρwater)
:Also, for the same two objects in air (ignoring the buoyancy of the air): m1 = ρ1 × V1 and m2 = ρ2 × V2
::by substitution: m1 ÷ m2 = (ρ1 ÷ ρ2) × ((ρ2 - ρwater) ÷ (ρ1 - ρwater))
::so: m1 = (ρ1 ÷ ρ2) × ((ρ2 - ρwater) ÷ (ρ1 - ρwater)) × m2
:And the same works with SG in place of density: m1 = (SG1 ÷ SG2) × ((SG2 - SGwater) ÷ (SG1 - SGwater)) × m2
:And since SGwater = 1: m1 = (SG1 ÷ SG2) × ((SG2 - 1) ÷ (SG1 - 1)) × m2
:Substituting values for 1 kg lead, iron gives: 1kg lead × (7.87/11.34) × ((11.34-1)/(7.87-1)) = 1.044kg iron

<text>The Treaty of Kiel () or Peace of Kiel (Swedish and or &quot;&quot;) was concluded between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Kingdom of Sweden on one side and the Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway on the other side on 14 January 1814 in Kiel. It ended the hostilities between the parties in the ongoing Napoleonic Wars, where the United Kingdom and Sweden were part of the anti-French camp (the Sixth Coalition) while Denmark–Norway was allied to the French Empire.

Frederick VI of Denmark joined the anti-French alliance, ceded Heligoland to George III of the United Kingdom, and further ceded the Kingdom of Norway to Charles XIII, to enter a union with Sweden, in return for Swedish Pomerania. Specifically excluded from the exchange were the Norwegian dependencies of Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands, which remained in the union with Denmark. (Norway would unsuccessfully contest the Danish claim to all of Greenland in the Eastern Greenland Case of 1931–33.)

However, not all provisions of the treaty would come into force. Norway declared its independence, adopted a constitution and elected Crown Prince Christian Frederik as its own king. Sweden therefore refused to hand over Swedish Pomerania, which instead passed to Prussia after the Congress of Vienna in 1815. After a short war with Sweden, Norway accepted entering into a personal union with Sweden at the Convention of Moss. King Christian Frederik abdicated after convening an extraordinary Storting, which revised the Constitution to allow for the Union. It was formally established when the Storting elected Charles XIII as king of Norway on 4 November 1814.

==Background==
In the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark–Norway and the Kingdom of Sweden tried to maintain neutrality but soon became involved in the fighting, joining opposite camps. Swedish king Gustav IV Adolf entered an alliance with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Russian Empire against Napoleon Bonaparte in 1805, and declared war on Napoleonic France. The United Kingdom, which had declared war on France in 1803, paid subsidies to Sweden. Before Gustav IV Adolf marched his forces out of Swedish Pomerania, a province long coveted by Prussia, he negotiated an agreement that Prussia would not attack it. Denmark remained neutral.

In 1807, Napoleonic forces seized Swedish Pomerania and forced Prussia and Russia to sign the Treaty of Tilsit. Russia was therein obliged to attack Napoleon&#x27;s enemies, and since Gustav IV Adolf refused to break his alliance with the United Kingdom, the tsar invaded Finland and severed it from Sweden in the Finnish War, 1808/1809. Sweden could no longer uphold her anti-French foreign policy, and French Marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte was elected heir to the Swedish throne in 1810. Denmark–Norway entered an alliance with France after the British bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807.

In 1812, Napoleon&#x27;s forces were decimated in their failed attempt to subdue Russia, and started their westward retreat. Sweden allied with Russia on 30 August 1812, with the United Kingdom on 3 March 1813, and with Prussia on 22 April 1813. Previously, on 23 March 1813, she had declared war on Napoleon. Bernadotte&#x27;s condition for entering the anti-Napoleonic alliance was the gain of Norway, which the United Kingdom and Russia accepted in May 1813. Prussia however did not acknowledge this claim at first. Thus, Bernadotte hesitated to enter the war with full force, and only engaged in a campaign against Hamburg which on 30 June was re-conquered by allied French and Danish forces. When Prussia finally accepted the Swedish claim to Norway on 22 July, Sweden joined the alliance of Reichenbach concluded between Russia, the United Kingdom and Prussia on 14/15 June. With three armies (North, Main and Silesian, the Northern army under Bernadotte&#x27;s command), the allies subsequently cleared Northern Germany of French forces. Denmark, who had maintained the alliance with Napoleon because of the Swedish claim to Norway, was isolated and, as a consequence of the war, bankrupt. Bernadotte, now free to attack Denmark after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at Leipzig in Mid-October, took his combined Swedish/Russian Army and quickly defeated the outnumbered Danish Army and occupied Holstein and Schleswig during late December 1813. Frederick VI agreed to make peace once it was clear that Bernadotte would occupy Jutland and Zealand (with British naval assistance), if necessary to force the Norwegian cession.

==Dano-British treaty==

The treaty between the Kingdom of Denmark and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was negotiated by Danish diplomat Edmund Bourke and the British envoy at the Swedish court, Edward Thornton. It consisted of 14 articles, to which two articles were added in Brussels on 7 April.

In article III, the United Kingdom was obliged to return all occupied Danish possessions to the Danish king. Excepted was the island of Heligoland, where the British king was granted &quot;full and unlimited sovereignty&quot;.

In article VI, the Danish king joined the anti-Napoleonic alliance, and obliged himself to maintain an army of 10,000 men that was to be joined to the Allied forces in Northern Germany and likewise be commanded by the Swedish crown prince. This Danish contingent was to be treated the same way the Swedish contingent was treated, and the Danish king was to receive an annual 400,000 pounds of British subsidies for maintenance and pay of the army, to be paid in monthly installments as soon as the army entered Allied service.

Article VIII was concerned with the abolishment of slave trade. In article X, the British king promised the Danish king to negotiate further compensation for Denmark&#x27;s territorial cessions to Sweden in a pending final peace. In article XIII, older Dano-British treaties were confirmed.

The articles added in Brussels were concerned with the property of Danish subjects in the colonies or in ceded territories, which was to remain untouched by the British for the next three years, and equal treatment of Danish, British and Hanoveranian subjects, who were not to be prosecuted because of their participation in the war on different sides, nor because of their political or religious beliefs.

==Dano-Swedish treaty==
The treaty between the Kingdom of Denmark and the Kingdom of Sweden was negotiated by Danish diplomat Edmund Bourke (Burke) and Swedish envoy Baron Gustaf af Wetterstedt with British mediation. It consisted of 28 articles and one separate article. In article III, the Danish king promised to join the alliance against Napoleonic France, and with reference to the Dano-British treaty confirms his obligation to put part of his army under Swedish command.

In article IV, the Danish king in his and his successors&#x27; name &quot;irrevocably and forever&quot; renounced claims to the Kingdom of Norway, which would enter a union with Sweden under the Swedish king. The Norwegian kingdom was defined as consisting of the bishoprics of Christiansand, Bergen, Akershus and Trondheim, as well as the coastal islands and the northern regions of Nordland and Finnmark to the Russian border. Excepted were Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. The Norwegian subjects were freed of their obligations to the Danish king. In article VI, the Swedish crown took over the debts and financial obligations of Norway, which was to be determined by a joint Dano-Swedish commission.

Article VII ruled that Swedish Pomerania was to be handed over to Denmark. In article XV, it was ruled that the Swedish forces were to take over the Norwegian fortresses as soon as the treaty was ratified, and that they were to abandon Swedish Pomerania as soon as the Norwegian fortresses Fredriksten, Fredrikstad, Kongsvinger and Akershus were handed over. In article XIII, the Swedish king promised the Danish king to negotiate full compensation for the cession of Norway in a pending final peace, and the cession of Swedish Pomerania is described as a &quot;proof&quot; of this intention.

In article XII, the king of Sweden promised to maintain the Norwegian University of Christiania, and the Pomeranian University of Greifswald, which was to pass to Denmark according to article VII, and confirmed donations made before the exchange. Also, it was agreed in article XX that subjects of the Danish king could choose within the next six years whether they would finally settle in Norway or Denmark, whereby property in the realm which would not become the permanent residence was to be sold only to inhabitants of this realm. This provision was also enacted with respect to Swedish Pomerania. In article XVI, it was agreed that the governors general and all foreign-born officials of the exchanged territories, as long as they did not decide to remain, were removed from their offices. Article XXI obliged the Danish administration to hand over all civilian and military administrative documents and archives concerning Norway.

Article XVII provided for a mutual exchange of all prisoners of war. According to article XV, allied troops were to leave the Danish Duchy of Schleswig (Slesvig), but were allowed to remain in the German confederal Duchy of Holstein (Holsten), ruled in personal union with Denmark and Schleswig, to participate in the encirclement of Hamburg. In article XXVII, former Dano-Swedish peaces were confirmed as long as their provisions were not in conflict with the treaty of Kiel, namely the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660), the Treaty of Stockholm (June 1720), the Treaty of Frederiksborg (July 1720) and the Treaty of Jönköping (1809). A separate article was concerned with the cession of hostilities.

==Union between Sweden and Norway==
The Swedish crown prince intended to invade Norway to enforce the Treaty of Kiel. This was supported by the majority of people living in Sweden. However, the Swedish elite in Christiania supported resistance. The bishop Johan Nordahl Brun wrote to Claus Pavels and urged his religious colleagues in Christiania to grab their rifles so as to never surrender. There was a brief war but a ceasefire allowed for the union between Norway and Sweden to be established. The Norwegian Parliament voted for a constitution and elected the Swedish king to the Norwegian throne. So Danish sovereignty over Norway was superseded with Swedish sovereignty over Norway. As of 1814 a distinction was made between &quot;genuine Norwegians&quot; and those allegedly &quot;un-Norwegian&quot;. The Norwegian elite used this identity labeling to resist &quot;Swedification&quot;.

===Swedish Pomerania===

Due to the refusal of Norway to subordinate itself to the Swedish king, Charles XIII of Sweden did not hand over Swedish Pomerania to Frederick VI of Denmark. The problem was solved at the Congress of Vienna, when the Great Powers followed a plan worked out by Karl August von Hardenberg, prime minister of the Kingdom of Prussia, who proposed a ring exchange of territories and payments between the Kingdom of Denmark, the Kingdom of Hanover (ruled in personal union with Great Britain and Ireland), the Kingdom of Prussia and the Kingdom of Sweden.

According to Hardenberg&#x27;s plan, Prussia ceded East Frisia with Emden to Hanover, and in exchange received from Hanover the Duchy of Lauenburg. This duchy was then handed over from Prussia to Denmark, along with an additional payment of 3.5 million talers. Prussia also took over a Danish debt to Sweden of 600,000 talers, and agreed on an additional payment of 2 million talers to Sweden. Denmark and Sweden in turn relinquished their claims to Swedish Pomerania in favour of Prussia. Charles XIII of Sweden then released his Pomeranian subjects from their obligations towards Sweden on 1 October 1815, and on 23 October the province was handed over to von Ingersleben, president of Prussian Pomerania.

===East Greenland case===
Between 1931 and 1933, Norway contested the Danish possession of all of Greenland at the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. , this was the only case where possession of a polar territory was ever decided by an international court.

The Norwegian side argued that Denmark did not hold rights to any part of the island where she did not exact actual sovereignty, and accordingly proclaimed a Norwegian Eirik Raudes Land in eastern Greenland on 10 July 1931, which had been occupied in the previous month. On 5 April 1933 however, the court ruled that on the basis of the Treaty of Kiel and subsequent treaties, Denmark was the sovereign over the whole of Greenland.

<doc id="490020" wikidata="Q412429" url="?curid=490020" title="Furfural">
<text>Furfural is an organic compound with the formula C4H3OCHO. It is a colorless liquid, although commercial samples are often brown. It has an aldehyde group attached to the 2-position of furan. It is a product of the dehydration of sugars, as occurs in a variety of agricultural byproducts, including corncobs, oat, wheat bran, and sawdust. The name &quot;furfural&quot; comes from the Latin word , meaning bran, referring to its usual source. Furfural is derived only from dried biomass. In addition to ethanol, acetic acid, and sugar, furfural is one of the oldest known organic chemicals available readily purified from natural precursors.

== History ==
Furfural was first isolated in 1821 (published in 1832) by the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, who produced a small sample as a byproduct of formic acid synthesis. In 1840, the Scottish chemist John Stenhouse found that the same chemical could be produced by distilling a wide variety of crop materials, including corn, oats, bran, and sawdust, with aqueous sulfuric acid; he also determined furfural&#x27;s empirical formula (C5H4O2). George Fownes named this oil &quot;furfurol&quot; in 1845 (from &quot;furfur&quot; (bran), and &quot;oleum&quot; (oil)). In 1848, the French chemist Auguste Cahours determined that furfural was an aldehyde. Determining the structure of furfural required some time: the furfural molecule contains a cyclic ether (furan), which tends to break open when it&#x27;s treated with harsh reagents. In 1870, German chemist Adolf von Baeyer speculated about the structure of the chemically similar compounds furan and 2-furoic acid. Additional research by German chemist Heinrich Limpricht supported this idea. From work published in 1877, Baeyer had confirmed his previous belief on the structure of furfural. By 1886, furfurol was being called &quot;furfural&quot; (short for &quot;furfuraldehyde&quot;) and the correct chemical structure for furfural was being proposed. By 1887, the German chemist Willy Marckwald had inferred that some derivatives of furfural contained a furan nucleus. In 1901, the German chemist Carl Harries determined furan&#x27;s structure through work with succindialdehyde and 2-methylfuran, thereby also confirming furfural&#x27;s proposed structure.

Furfural remained relatively obscure until 1922, when the Quaker Oats Company began mass-producing it from oat hulls. Today, furfural is still produced from agricultural byproducts like sugarcane bagasse and corn cobs. The main countries producing furfural today are the Dominican Republic, South Africa and China.

==Properties==
Furfural dissolves readily in most polar organic solvents, but it is only slightly soluble in either water or alkanes.

Furfural participates in the same kinds of reactions as other aldehydes and other aromatic compounds. It exhibits less aromatic character than benzene, as can be seen from the fact that furfural is readily hydrogenated to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. When heated in the presence of acids, furfural irreversibly polymerizes, acting as a thermosetting polymer.

==Production==
Furfural may be obtained by the acid catalyzed dehydration of 5-carbon sugars (pentoses), particularly xylose. 
: → + 3 

These sugars may be obtained from pentosans obtained from hemicellulose present in lignocellulosic biomass.

Between 3% and 10% of the mass of crop residue feedstocks can be recovered as furfural, depending on the type of feedstock. Furfural and water evaporate together from the reaction mixture, and separate upon condensation. The global production capacity is about 800,000 tons as of 2012. China is the biggest supplier of furfural, and accounts for the greater part of global capacity. The other two major commercial producers are Illovo Sugar in South Africa and Central Romana in the Dominican Republic.

In the laboratory, furfural can be synthesized from plant material by heating with sulfuric acid or other acids. With the purpose to avoid toxic effluents, an effort to substitute sulfuric acid with easily separable and reusable solid acid catalysts has been studied around the world. The formation and extraction of xylose and subsequently furfural can be favored over the extraction of other sugars with varied conditions, such as acid concentration, temperature, and time.

In industrial production, some lignocellulosic residue remains after the removal of the furfural. This residue is dried and burned to provide steam for the operation of the furfural plant. Newer and more energy efficient plants have excess residue, which is or can be used for co-generation of electricity, cattle feed, activated carbon, mulch/fertiliser, etc.

==Uses and occurrence==
It is commonly found in many cooked or heated foods such as coffee (55–255 mg/kg) and whole grain bread (26 mg/kg).

In petrochemical industry, furfural is utilized as a specialized chemical solvent for diene extraction.

Furfural is an important renewable, non-petroleum based, chemical feedstock which can be converted into solvents, polymers, fuels and other useful chemicals by a range of catalytic reduction.

Hydrogenation of furfural provides furfuryl alcohol (FA), which is used to produce furan resins, which are exploited in thermoset polymer matrix composites, cements, adhesives, casting resins and coatings. Further hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol leads to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), which is used as a solvent in agricultural formulations and as an adjuvant to help herbicides penetrate the leaf structure.

Palladium-catalyzed decarbonylation on furfural manufactures industrially furan.

Another important solvent made from furfural is methyltetrahydrofuran. Furfural is used to make other furan derivatives, such as furoic acid, via oxidation, and furan itself via palladium catalyzed vapor phase decarbonylation.

There is a good market for value added chemicals that can be obtained from furfural.

== Safety ==

Furfural is carcinogenic in lab animals and mutagenic in single cell organisms, but there is no data on human subjects. It is classified in IARC Group 3 due to the lack of data on humans and too few tests on animals to satisfy Group 2A/2B criteria. It is hepatotoxic.

The median lethal dose is high, 650–900 mg/kg (oral, dogs), consistent with its pervasiveness in foods.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set a permissible exposure limit for furfural at 5ppm over an eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA), and also designates furfural as a risk for skin absorption.

<text>Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2) is Canada&#x27;s Tier 1 special operations force mandated with protecting Canadian national interests and combating terrorism threats both domestic and abroad. JTF2 serves under the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command of the Canadian Armed Forces and is typically compared to American Delta Force and SEAL Team Six, the British Special Air Service and Special Boat Service, the Australian Special Air Service Regiment and 2nd Commando Regiment, and the New Zealand Special Air Service. Most information concerning JTF2 is classified and is not usually commented on by the Canadian Armed Forces or the Canadian government. 

JTF2&#x27;s team of assaulters specialize in counterterrorism, direct action raids, hostage rescue, maritime special operations, special protection, and special reconnaissance often employed in complex, classified and dangerous missions against high-value targets backed up by specialized teams of supporting personnel.

==History==

In 1992, Deputy Minister of Defence Robert Fowler announced he was recommending to Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn that he disband the Royal Canadian Mounted Police&#x27;s Special Emergency Response Team (SERT) and create a new military counter-terrorism group. The decision was made largely because the Canadian Forces offered a greater pool of recruits for the program than civilian police forces, and it stemmed the public uproar about police being taught to use primarily lethal means.

In early 1993, the unit was activated with just over 100 members, primarily drawn from the Canadian Airborne Regiment and Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry. They were given the SERT facility on Dwyer Hill Road near Ottawa as their own base of operations, and permanently parked a Greyhound bus and a DC-9 aircraft on the grounds for use in training.

Its first scheduled action was Operation Campus, the protection of highways and water treatment plants around the Oka reserve while a police force tried to &quot;crack down on smuggling&quot; on the native reserve, immediately following the Oka crisis. However two daily newspapers in Quebec revealed the operation just days before it was to go into action, and it was cancelled.
The federal budget of December 2001 allocated approximately $120 million over six years to expand unit capabilities and double its size to an estimated 600 personnel, as part of the overall plan following the attacks of September 11, 2001.

On September 13, 2024, new buildings are undergoing construction at JTF 2&#x27;s Dwyer Hill headquarters to modernize their facilities with older buildings being scheduled to be torn down, which is contracted to EllisDon Corporation. A bridge will be constructed to Franktown Road, which will only be used by JTF 2 to transport their equipment. It&#x27;s expected to be completed by 2027.

==Operations==

===Bosnia===
JTF2 forces were inserted into Bosnia, operating in two- to four-man teams hunting for Serbian snipers who were targeting UN forces at the sniper alley. They were scheduled to free approximately 55 hostages in Operation Freedom55, but the mission was cancelled as the Bosnian Serbs released all the prisoners voluntarily.

===Haiti===
In 1996, JTF2 deployed to Haiti to advise the security forces of President René Préval on methods to repel the revolutionary army, train local SWAT teams and raid weapons smugglers in Port-au-Prince.

According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, JTF2 was also in Haiti at the time that Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide was ousted from power in 2004. They protected the Canadian embassy and secured the airport.

===War on Terror===
In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and the American declaration of a War on Terror, approximately 40 JTF2 soldiers were sent to southern Afghanistan in early December 2001 to be part of Task Force K-Bar, under the command of Captain Robert Harward. The Canadian public was not informed of the deployment. However, in Sean M. Maloney&#x27;s book &quot;Enduring the Freedom&quot;, it was reported that JTF2 was secretly deployed without Prime Minister Jean Chrétien&#x27;s permission in early October 2001. Under Task Force K-Bar, JTF2 worked extensively with the U.S. 3rd Special Forces Group; one of their first missions in Afghanistan was what Harward described as &quot;the first Coalition direct action mission since the Second World War.&quot; The joint operation with a team of Green Berets targeting a Taliban command node almost ended in disaster when a Chinook carrying JTF2 operators was forced to make a hard landing near the target site. While serving with Task Force K-Bar, Harward also stated that the JTF2 team under his command was his first choice for any direct action. JTF2 was based at the time in Kandahar Air Field.

Several months later, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; published an image on its front page showing operators in distinctive forest-green Canadian Forces combat uniforms delivering captured prisoners to the Americans. This prompted an outcry in Parliament as MPs were never informed these operations were underway. Vice Admiral Greg Maddison was called before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to address claims that Minister of Defence Art Eggleton had purposely misled the public and the government, even failing to inform the Prime Minister that JTF2 had been operating in Afghanistan. Segments of the Canadian media made much of the special forces handing over detainees, particularly those who may have been sent to Guantanamo Bay. In January 2002, JTF2 deployed reconnaissance teams to the series of caves discovered in Zhawar Kili, just south of Tora Bora. Airstrikes hit the sites before SOF teams were inserted into the area. A platoon from SEAL Team 3, including several of their Desert Patrol Vehicles, accompanied by a German Kommando Spezialkräfte (KSK) element and a Norwegian SOF team, spent some nine days conducting extensive site exploitation, clearing an estimated 70 caves and 60 structures in the area, recovering a huge amount of both intelligence and munitions, but they did not encounter any al-Qaeda fighters. In March 2002, JTF2 reconnaissance teams took part in Operation Anaconda; they also conducted close protection tasks and participated in numerous direct action missions, allegedly including the siege at Mirwais hospital in Kandahar, where a US Army Special Forces operational detachment-A (SFODA) killed a group of al-Qaeda terrorists hiding in a hospital ward; JTF2 also carried out numerous operations with the New Zealand Special Air Service. JTF2&#x27;s first rotation was completed when they returned to Canada in May 2002, to be replaced by a second, shorter term, deployment until October 2002.

In 2004, an estimated 40 members of JTF2 serving with Task Force K-Bar were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation by the U.S. government for service in Afghanistan. Very little is known on JTF2 operations in Afghanistan, but during a conference the former Chief of Defence Staff, General Rick Hillier, stated that JTF2 was in &quot;high demand&quot; and that they were considered to be &quot;world class&quot;. He went on to say that the unit was providing direct support to the Afghan government and was targeting the Taliban leadership in southern Afghanistan. He stated that &quot;trying to help neutralize those leaders is a key part of their role and that&#x27;s what they will continue to do.&quot;

On 26 November 2005, members of the terrorist group Swords of Righteousness Brigade – a small offshoot of possibly Islamic Army in Iraq (IAI), Ansar al-Islam (AAI), Army of Islam, or a cover name for their abduction cells, or freelance cash criminal abductors – kidnapped four members (two Canadian, one British, and one American) of the Christian Peacemaker Teams in Baghdad, Iraq. In response, Task Force Knight — the British special forces task force in Iraq — initiated Operation Lightwater; spearheaded by B Squadron, 22nd Special Air Service Regiment (SAS), the aim of which was to find and recover the hostages; a small team of JTF2 and Canadian intelligence experts joined the task force for the operation whilst the United States provided technical intelligence to the operation. Together the force carried out relentless raids across the city, building up a picture by exploiting intelligence in the search for the hostages, eventually on the 23 March 2006 the three remaining hostages were rescued by the SAS. The Pentagon and the British Foreign Office both commented on the instrumental role JTF2 played in rescuing the British and Canadian Christian Peacemaker Team that were being held hostage in Iraq. Involvement of JTF2 was not confirmed by Canadian officials.

There has been much speculation in the Canadian media on possible JTF2 operational deployments. As of 2001, the unit had 297 members, but by the end of the year, with the War on Terror becoming a reality, the federal government announced their intentions to increase it to 600 members within four years.

As of 2014, the unit was believed to be in Iraq as training personnel, under the Canadian Operation Impact which is part of Operation Inherent Resolve. The Canadian government has not denied or confirmed JTF2&#x27;s involvement.

In June 2017, it was reported that a JTF2 sniper in Iraq had shot and killed an ISIL fighter from a distance of , setting a world record for the longest confirmed kill. The shot was taken from a high-rise building using a standard Canadian military issued McMillan Tac-50 rifle, a .50 caliber (12.7×99mm) anti-materiel rifle commonly used by snipers in an anti-personnel role. The Canadian Forces designation is the C15 Long-Range Sniper Weapon (LRSW).

===Other actions===

Vice-Admiral Dean McFadden also confirmed that JTF2 would take a role in securing the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics.

JTF2 has also acted as bodyguards to Canadians travelling abroad, notably accompanying Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril and Raymond Chrétien to Zaire in November 1996. When photographs provided to the media were revealed to show the faces of JTF2 forces, they were redacted and reissued with the faces removed. In 1998, they accompanied General Roméo Dallaire to Tanzania where he was due to testify against a Rwandan Hutu official accused of complicity in the 1994 genocide. They similarly accompanied war crimes prosecutor Louise Arbour into Kosovo. In early November 2000, Conservative Defence Critic David Price stated that JTF2 had been deployed to Kosovo, however, this was denied by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and Defence Minister Art Eggleton.

The unit was believed to be operating with the Special Air Service and Special Boat Service in Operation Mobile, the Canadian operation in the 2011 Libyan civil war.

In August 2021, JTF2 and CSOR operators were deployed to Afghanistan to evacuate staff from the Canadian Embassy in Kabul.

In May 2022, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Ukraine to show solidarity and to witness the war for himself, alongside members of the cabinet. As part of the security detail, they were accompanied by members of JTF2.

In October 2023, JTF2 and other CANSOFCOM elements were deployed to Israel to help with security at the Canadian embassy. In March 2024, JTF2 operators were deployed to Haiti to protect the Canadian Embassy and staff.

==Unit accountability==
On 21 December 2006, a Federal Court judge rejected a request to proceed with a court martial against an unnamed JTF2 officer, accused of assaulting and mistreating a subordinate. Because court martial requests require that the accused be named, the judge suggested that they explore other avenues to proceed with the court martial.

JTF2 has acknowledged the death of one member. Master Corporal Anthony Klumpenhouwer, 25, died on April18, 2007, after falling off a communications tower in Kandahar, Afghanistan. In 2010, the investigation into Klumpenhouwer&#x27;s death was completed, and revealed that he had been knocked unconscious by a surge of electricity.

==Equipment==
Operators use a range of weapons including:
* SIG Sauer MCX
* Colt Canada series of rifles: C7, C8, and C8SFW 
* SIG Sauer SIG 716 G2 designated marksman rifle 
* Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 (A2/A3/SD) submachine gun 
* FN Herstal P90 personal defence weapon 
* SIG Sauer P226 sidearm 
* SIG Sauer P320 sidearm 
*Remington Model 870 and Benelli M3 shotguns
* FN Minimi C9A2 light machine gun
* Accuracy International AWP, C14 Timberwolf, Heckler &amp; Koch PSG1, M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System, McMillan TAC-50 and Barrett M82 sniper rifles 
* M203 grenade launcher, Heckler &amp; Koch GMG automatic grenade launcher, and Heckler &amp; Koch HK69A1 grenade launcher. 
* Rafael Spike-LR anti-tank guided missile 
* Saab Bofors Dynamics AT4 anti-tank weapon.
* Carl Gustaf 8.4cm recoilless rifle M4 version

JTF2 uses the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) special operations version. A replacement project was cancelled in 2010. In 2016, the DAGOR (Deployable Advanced Ground Off-road) vehicle by Polaris Defense was awarded the Ultra-Light Combat Vehicle (ULCV) contract to provide 78 vehicles to CANSOFCOM.

<text>A religious school is a school that either has a religious component in its operations or its curriculum, or exists primarily for the purpose of teaching aspects of a particular religion.

==For children==

A 2002 study in the United States found higher academic performance in children attending religious schools than those attending secular institutions, including when controlling for socioeconomic status.

A school can either be of two types, though the same word is used for both in some areas:

===Religious teaching===

Institutions solely or largely for teaching a particular religion, often outside regular school
*Cheder (Jewish)
*Hebrew school (Jewish)
*Madrasa (Muslim)
*Sunday school (Christian)
*Talmud Torah (Jewish)

===General education===

Institutions providing general education but run by a religious group, or in some way giving extra weight to a particular religion
*Bais Yaakov (Jewish girls school)
*Cathedral school (Christian)
*Catholic school
*Chabad (Jewish)
*Christian school
*Faith school UK term
*Jewish day school
*Lutheran school (Christian)
*Madrasa (Muslim) also general education in some places
*Parochial school USA in particular, former UK
*Separate school Canada

==For adults==

*Bible college (Christian)
*Madrasa (Muslim)
*Yeshiva (Jewish)

<doc id="490034" wikidata="Q11318286" url="?curid=490034" title="Parochial school">
<text>A parochial school is a private primary or secondary school affiliated with a religious organization, and whose curriculum includes general religious education in addition to secular subjects, such as science, mathematics and language arts. The word &quot;&quot; comes from the same root as &quot;parish&quot;, and parochial schools were originally the educational wing of the local parish church. Christian parochial schools are called &quot;church schools&quot; or &quot;Christian schools.&quot;

In addition to schools run by Christian organizations, there are also religious schools affiliated with Jewish, Muslim, and other groups; however, these are not usually called &quot;parochial&quot; because of the term&#x27;s historical association with Christian parishes.

==United Kingdom==

In British education, parish schools from the established church of the relevant constituent country formed the basis of the state-funded education system, and many schools retain a church connection while essentially providing secular education in accordance with standards set by the government of the country concerned. These are often primary schools, and may be designated as &quot;name&quot; C.E. School or &quot;name&quot; C.E. (Aided) School, depending on whether they are wholly or partly funded by the Church of England (the latter is more common).

In 2002, Frank Dobson proposed an amendment to the Education Bill (for England and Wales) which would limit the selection rights of faith schools by requiring them to offer at least a quarter of places to children of another or no religion, in order to increase inclusivity and lessening social division. The proposal was defeated in Parliament.

In 2005, David Bell, the head of the Office for Standards in Education said &quot;Faith should not be blind. I worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British society. This growth in faith schools needs to be carefully but sensitively monitored by government to ensure that pupils receive an understanding of not only their own faith but of other faiths and the wider tenets of British society&quot;. He criticised Islamic schools in particular, calling them a &quot;threat to national identity&quot;.

In October 2006, Bishop Kenneth Stevenson, speaking on behalf of the Church of England, said &quot;I want to make a specific commitment that all new Church of England schools should have at least 25% of places available to children with no requirement that they be from practising Christian families.&quot; This commitment applies only to new schools, not existing ones.

In September 2007, attempts to create the first secular school in Britain were blocked. Paul Kelley, head of Monkseaton High School in Tyneside, proposed plans to eliminate the daily act of Christian worship, and &quot;a fundamental change in the relationship with the school and the established religion of the country&quot;.

In November 2007, the Krishna-Avanti Hindu school in north-west London became the first school in the United Kingdom to make vegetarianism a condition of entry. Additionally, parents of pupils are expected to abstain from alcohol to prove they are followers of the faith.

In November 2007, the Jewish Free School in north London was found guilty of discrimination for giving preference to children who were born to Jewish mothers.

In January 2008 the House of Commons&#x27; Children, Schools and Families select committee raised concerns about the government&#x27;s plans for expanding faith schooling. The general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Mary Bousted, said &quot;Unless there are crucial changes in the way many faith schools run we fear divisions in society will be exacerbated. In our increasingly multi-faith and secular society it is hard to see why our taxes should be used to fund schools which discriminate against the majority of children and potential staff because they are not of the same faith&quot;.

===England===
English education includes many schools linked to the Church of England which sets the ethos of the school and can influence selection of pupils where there is competition for places. These form a large proportion of the 6,955 Christian faith schools in England. The Catholic Church also maintains schools. In addition, there are 36 Jewish, seven Muslim and two Sikh faith schools.

Faith schools follow the same national curriculum as state schools. Religious education in Church of England schools is monitored by the local diocese, but does not typically take up much more of the timetable than in secular schools. Although not state schools, there are around 700 unregulated madrassas in Britain, attended by approximately 100,000 Muslim children. Doctor Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, the leader of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain, has called for them to be subject to government inspection following publication of a 2006 report which highlighted widespread physical and sexual abuse. Voluntary-aided schools, such as Church of England and Catholic schools, are permitted to discriminate against teachers on the grounds of their religious opinions, attendance at worship and willingness to provide religious education.

===Scotland===
Scotland has its own educational system, distinct from that of England and Wales, reflecting the history of education in Scotland. Although schools existed in Scotland prior to the Reformation, widespread public education was pioneered by the Church of Scotland developing its aim of universal parish schools from 1560 onwards, and given state support by the Education Act 1633. It handed over its parish schools to the state in 1872. Although these schools are now known as &quot;non-denominational&quot; schools, and are open to all, their traditional links with the Presbyterian and Episcopalian churches and clergy remain in most cases.

Charitably funded Roman Catholic schools were brought into the state system by the Education (Scotland) Act 1918. Whilst maintaining a strong Catholic ethos, Scottish Catholic schools have long welcomed pupils from other faith backgrounds, though they tend to give precedence to non-Catholics who come from families of faith. In Scottish Catholic schools employment of non-Catholics or lapsed Catholics can be restricted by the Church. In some dioceses, one of the requirements for applicants baptised as Catholic is to possess a certificate which has been signed by their parish priest. Each diocese varies on the method of approval and the rigour with which it is applied. Non-Catholic applicants are not required to provide any religious documentation. Certain positions, such as headteachers, religious education teachers and guidance teachers are invariably held by practising Roman Catholics.

==United States==

Historically, most American parochial schools have been Catholic schools (often elementary schools attached to a local parish), as well as schools run by Seventh-day Adventists, Episcopalians, Lutherans, Calvinists and Orthodox Jews.
Since the 1960s thousands of Fundamentalist religious schools have been founded, especially in the South, though they are not usually called &quot;parochial&quot;. In addition to this, Conservative Mennonites, Amish, and Old Order Mennonites operate their own schools (the Old Order referring to theirs as &quot;parochial&quot;). Many fundamentalist Christian schools use curriculum from Abeka Books and Bob Jones University Press.

Catholic private and college preparatory schools also exist and are not necessarily connected with a parish. Often these schools, such as those in the Philadelphia area, prefer to be referred to as &quot;private Catholic schools,&quot; to distinguish themselves from the Archdiocesan parochial school system. In some Canadian provinces Catholic schools are publicly funded and in Ontario completely to the level of grade 12.

Generally within the Catholic parochial school system, parochial schools are open to all children in the parish. Thus parochial school systems function as quasi-public educational networks, in parallel to the state-school systems, the key difference being that parochial systems are largely supported by donations to the parish while state schools are funded by taxes. Often, the Catholic diocese or archdiocese, such as those in Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago will take a greater role in administration of the parochial schools within their jurisdiction. Out-of-pocket costs to the student attending a parochial school are usually greater than an equivalent public school. Although it costs parents more for their children to attend, teachers are generally paid less than those at an equivalent public school. For example, in 1998, they were paid about 45% less than public school teachers.

The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) operates an extensive parochial school system. The WELS school system is the fourth largest private school system in the United States.

===History===
The development of the American Catholic parochial school system can be divided into three phases. During the first (1750–1870), parochial schools appeared as &quot;ad hoc&quot; efforts by parishes, and most Catholic children attended public schools. During the second period (1870–1910), the Catholic hierarchy made a basic commitment to a separate Catholic school system. These parochial schools, like the big-city parishes around them, tended to be ethnically homogeneous; a German child would not be sent to an Irish school, nor vice versa, nor a Lithuanian pupil to either. Instruction in the language of the old country was common. In the third period (1910–1945), Catholic education was modernized and modeled after the public school systems, and ethnicity was deemphasized in many areas. In cities with large Catholic populations (such as Chicago and Boston) there was a flow of teachers, administrators, and students from one system to the other.

In addition to the Catholics, the German Lutherans and Calvinist Dutch also began parochial schools, as did Orthodox Jews.

Starting from about 1876, thirty nine states (out of 50) passed a constitutional amendment to their state constitutions, called &quot;Blaine Amendments,&quot; forbidding tax money be used to fund parochial schools. In 2002, the United States Supreme Court upheld an Ohio law allowing aid under specific circumstances.

In the 1920s, Oregon outlawed all non-public schools in an attempt to stamp out parochial schools, but in 1925 the Supreme Court overturned the law in &quot;Pierce v. Society of Sisters&quot;. There is a controversy over the legality of parish schools. In December 2018, Ed Mechmann, the director of public policy at the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York noted that the new regulations from the New York State Education Department would &quot;give local school boards virtually unlimited power over private religious schools. There is no protection against government officials who are hostile to religious schools or who just want to eliminate the competition.&quot;

==Russian Empire==
Parochial schools (, prikhodskie uchilishcha) was a system of elementary education in the Russian Empire which were part of the Ministry of National Enlightenment (Education). Parochial schools were introduced in 1804 following an educational reform of primary schools. Before that, in Russia existed arithmetic schools which were part of elementary education.

Along with regular parochial schools there also existed a well developed system of church-parochial schools of the Russian Orthodox Church which was also introduced in 1804.

Both schools parochial and church-parochial were funded by government.

==Philippines==
Since the Spanish Era, schools have been traditionally run by the predominant Catholic Church and its different religious institutes, such as the Order of Preachers and the Society of Jesus.

Currently, parochial schools are generally those run by local, territorial parishes, while Catholic schools are administered directly by dioceses or religious institutes.

===Metro Manila===
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila and its suffragan dioceses, parochial schools are supervised by the Manila Archdiocesan Parochial Schools Association and its affiliates like the Diocese of Cubao Educational System and the Parochial Schools Association of Novaliches. These organisations are overseen by the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines (the country&#x27;s governing Catholic body) through the Episcopal Commission on Catechism and Christian Education.

==India==

In Ancient India, Gurukula was the main system of education though some still exist today. Catholic educational institutions are second in numbers behind government run schools. There are 14,539. While the schools are centrally tracked by the Catholic Bishops Council of India, they are controlled by the diocese in which they are located. There are 13,004 primary and secondary Catholic schools, 243 special schools, 448 Catholic colleges, and 534 technical institutions.

<text>A taxpayer is a person or organization (such as a company) subject to pay a tax. Modern taxpayers may have an identification number, a reference number issued by a government to citizens or firms.

The term &quot;taxpayer&quot; generally characterizes one who pays taxes. A taxpayer is an individual or entity that is obligated to make payments to municipal or government taxation-agencies.
Taxes can exist in the form of income taxes and/or property taxes imposed on owners of real property (such as homes and vehicles), along with many other forms. People may pay taxes when they pay for goods and services which are taxed. The term &quot;taxpayer&quot; often refers to the workforce of a country which pays for government systems and projects through taxation. The taxpayers&#x27; money becomes part of the public funds, which comprise all money spent or invested by government to satisfy individual or collective needs or to generate future benefits. For tax purposes, business entities are also taxpayers, making their revenues and expenditures subject to taxation.

== Types of taxes ==
; Taxes on income
The government levy income taxes on personal and business revenue and interest income. In addition to income taxes, the government can also mandate that employers subtract payroll taxes from their workers&#x27; paychecks each pay period, and then match the sums deducted. Capital gains taxes are those paid on any profits made from the sale of an asset and are usually applied to stock and bond transactions. Estate taxes are imposed on the transfer of property upon the death of the owner.

; Taxes on property
Property tax, sometimes known as an ad valorem tax, is imposed on the value of real estate or other personal property. Property taxes are usually imposed by local governments and charged on a recurring basis. Real estate taxes are often subject to fluctuation based upon a jurisdiction&#x27;s assessment of the worth of a property based on its condition, location and market value, and/or changes to the amounts apportioned to various recipients of the tax.

; Taxes on goods and services
The sales tax is most often used as a method for states and local governments to raise revenue. Purchases made at the retail level are assessed a percentage of the sales price of a particular item. Rates vary between jurisdictions and the type of item bought. Excise taxes are based on the quantity of an item and not on its value. User fees are taxes that are assessed on a wide variety of services, including airline tickets, rental cars, toll roads, utilities, hotel rooms, licenses, financial transactions and many others. So-called sin taxes are imposed on items like cigarettes and alcohol. Luxury taxes are imposed on certain items, such as expensive cars or jewelry.

== Types of taxpayers ==
Taxpayers can be classified into two major categories – individual and corporation. A corporation is a legal entity that is separate from the owners for tax purposes. These major categories can be further divided in different subcategories.

Individual taxpayers can be classified as either a citizen or an alien (an alien is a person who resides within the borders of a country and is not a national of that country). A citizen can further be classified as either a resident citizen or a non-resident citizen.

Corporations can be classified into domestic, foreign and partnership. A foreign corporation is either resident foreign or non-resident foreign corporation. A resident foreign corporation is a foreign corporation engaged in trade or business in the country. A non-resident foreign corporation is a foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business within the country but deriving income from sources in the country. A partnership is a business structure where ownership and management responsibility of a company is split between two or more individuals. A partnership is not a legal entity that is separate from the owners and therefore the partnership itself does not pay taxes.

The classification depends on given country and may vary.

== Taxpayers&#x27; money ==
Taxpayers&#x27; money help to pay for the items on the federal budget. The gap between revenue (money collected via taxes) and spending is known as the budget deficit. The money the federal government borrows to cover the budget deficit is what creates the national debt. The government spends money for a variety of reasons: reduce inequality (&quot;safety net&quot; programs), provide public goods (fire, police, national defence), provide important public services like education and health (merit goods), debt interest payments, transport and military spending. The &quot;safety net&quot; programs are initiatives that give extra financial support to the elderly, unemployed, disabled and the poor. Examples include the earned income tax credit, child tax credits, unemployment insurance, food stamps, subsidized school meals, low-income housing assistance, energy assistance and more. The federal government spends its money in four major ways: direct payments, grants, contracts and insurance.

== Tax avoidance and tax evasion ==
Taxpayers may violate the law by not paying their mandatory taxes. This crime is called tax evasion. Tax evasion is an illegal practice where a person, organization or corporation intentionally avoids paying his true tax liability. Those caught evading taxes are generally subject to criminal charges and substantial penalties. It&#x27;s considered tax evasion if the taxpayer knowingly fails to report income or under-report income (claiming less income than you actually received from a specific source), provides false information to the IRS about business income or expenses, deliberately underpays taxes owed or substantially understates taxes (by stating a tax amount on return which is less than the amount owed for the income reported). Tax evasion differs from tax avoidance, which is the use of legal methods to modify an individual&#x27;s financial situation to lower the amount of income tax owed.

<text>Mallaig (; ) is a port in Morar, on the west coast of the Highlands of Scotland. It faces Skye from across the Sound of Sleat. The local railway station is the terminus of the West Highland Line (Fort William and Mallaig branch), and the town is linked to Fort William by the A830 road – the &quot;Road to the Isles&quot;.

==Development==
The village of Mallaig was founded in the 1840s when Lord Lovat, owner of North Morar Estate, divided up the farm of Mallaigvaig into 17 parcels of land and encouraged his tenants to move to the western part of the peninsula and turn to fishing as a way of life. The population and local economy expanded rapidly in the 20th century with the arrival of the railway.

Ferries operated by Caledonian MacBrayne and Western Isles Cruises sail from the port to Armadale on the Isle of Skye, Inverie in Knoydart, Lochboisdale on South Uist and the isles of Rùm, Eigg, Muck, and Canna. Mallaig is the main commercial fishing port on the west coast of Scotland, and during the 1960s was the busiest herring port in Europe. Mallaig prided itself at that time on its famous traditionally smoked kippers, the fishmonger Andy Race still providing genuine oak smoked kippers from the factory shop on the harbour. Mallaig and the surrounding area is a popular area for holidays.

Most of the community speaks English, with a minority of residents speaking both English and Gaelic. In addition, traditional Gaelic is still taught in Mallaig Primary School to pupils who choose to learn the language.

==Education==
Mallaig has extensive distance-learning facilities, allowing the local population access to all forms of education from leisure classes to university degrees through Lochaber College and the UHI Millennium Institute. The college is one of the most successful of its kind in Britain, with over 8 per cent of the local population accessing its facilities. The college has published a PDF version of the 19th century Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Condition of Crofters and Cottars in the Highlands and Islands report. Recently the Learning Centre has opened a marine-specific vocational centre and is at the forefront of developing Marine Certification courses for fishermen, as well as being a RYA certified centre.

Mallaig has its own primary school, which recently accepted the Gaelic-medium pupils from Lady Lovat Primary School in the nearby village of Morar. This allows Lady Lovat to focus more on its English-medium students.

Mallaig has a high school called Mallaig High School, which opened in 1989, although a secondary school had existed in a slightly different location. This caters for Mallaig, the villages of Morar and Arisaig, the nearby Small Isles of Eigg, Rùm, Muck and Canna, and the nearby Knoydart peninsula. The school has growing numbers of pupils from the Small Isles, unable to travel daily from home. These pupils are boarded in the school&#x27;s hostel.

==Local services==
Mallaig has several restaurants, cafes and takeaways, also a community-run swimming pool and leisure centre. The main focus is on the summer tourist trade, although some facilities open all year round, including the swimming pool. Mallaig has three hotels, much self-catering accommodation and several guest houses.

The village has a bank and three pubs. The compact centre is close to the harbour and railway station, with residential areas beyond to the south and east of the harbour. Most of the retail premises are on the main street, or on Davies Brae, which runs south from the centre. The swimming pool is at the high point of the village on Fank Brae.

There are two minimarkets and gift shops. An art gallery sells work by local artists. There is a small bookshop. A heritage centre next to the railway station is based around old photographs of the locality, but as Mallaig has only existed during the age of photography this offers a good introduction to the history and heritage of the locality. There are Roman Catholic and Church of Scotland churches, and a Fishermen&#x27;s Mission facility run by the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen. There is a small petrol station with restricted opening times near the harbour.

==Transport==

Completed in 1901, the West Highland Line links Mallaig railway station to Fort William, Oban and Glasgow. The line was voted the top rail journey in the world by readers of the independent travel magazine &quot;Wanderlust&quot; in 2009, ahead of the iconic Trans-Siberian and the Cuzco to Machu Picchu line in Peru. The five-hour trip to Glasgow Queen Street railway station passes through spectacular scenery, including seascapes, loch sides, mountain and moorland terrain. It offers views of Loch Lomond, the Gare Loch, Rannoch Moor, Ben Nevis, Glenfinnan, Glen Shiel and Loch Eil. The line also runs along the Clyde between Helensburgh and Glasgow and offers views across the estuary. In the years before the First World War, after the opening of the line in 1901, there was a fairly steady increase in the value of fish sold, exceeding £60,000 in 1914.
In the summer the Jacobite steam train service from Fort William visits Mallaig.

Shiel Buses operates a service from Mallaig to Fort William. Buses also run south along the A861 to the villages of Acharacle and Strontian.

Mallaig is an important ferry port, with regular Caledonian MacBrayne services to Armadale on the Isle of Skye, a 30-minute sailing operated by MV Loch Fyne and MV Lord of the Isles, the latter operating the morning service from Lochboisdale on South Uist to Mallaig, before shuttling between Mallaig and Armadale, then working the evening service back to Lochboisdale. It also runs a daily service operated by the MV Lochnevis, purpose-built for the route to the Small Isles of Canna, Rùm, Eigg and Muck, although the timetable and itinerary differ from day to day.

In addition, a local ferry service owned by a former lifeboatman, Bruce Watt, sails daily to Inverie in Knoydart, a remote village, and also calls by prior arrangement at Tarbet in Morar, a location only accessible by sea. This service also offers a non-landing cruise through scenic Loch Nevis.
==Mallaig as filming location==
The Mallaig railway was used during the filming of the Harry Potter series of films, and the Hogwarts Express could often be seen in the summer during periods of filming. Many other local areas were used for location filming.

The 1996 film &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; was largely filmed in Mallaig and the surrounding area, and the beach scenes of &quot;Local Hero&quot; were filmed at Morar and Arisaig, a few miles to the south.

<doc id="490040" wikidata="Q25651" url="?curid=490040" title="Slate Islands, Scotland">
<text>The Slate Islands are an island group in the Inner Hebrides, lying immediately off the west coast of Scotland, north of Jura and southwest of Oban. The main islands are Seil, Easdale, Luing, Shuna, Torsa and Belnahua. Scarba and Kerrera, which lie nearby are not usually included.

The underlying geology of the islands is Dalradian slate, which was quarried widely until the mid-20th century. Quarry working began in 1630 and at the turn of the 20th century, the quarries were yielding some eight million slates every year.

The Garvellachs lie to the southwest.

== Definition ==

Unlike some of Scotland&#x27;s larger archipelagos such as Orkney and the Outer Hebrides, which are distant from other islands and also have their own local authority, the Slate Islands have no formal definition. The islands from which the slate that gives rise to the name was quarried on a substantial commercial basis are Easdale, Belnahua, Luing and Seil. The website of the Slate Islands Heritage Trust also prominently lists these islands as their remit although other sources are slightly more inclusive.

According to the Gazetteer for Scotland these islands &quot;include Luing, Seil, Shuna, Torsay, Easdale, Belnahua and Fladda&quot;. W. H. Murray in &quot;The Companion Guide to the West Highlands of Scotland&quot; goes so far as to say: &quot;Seil and Luing, Shuna, Torsa, Belnahua and many others are collectively known as the Slate Islands.&quot; Torsa is a tidal island, joined to Luing at low tide. From a geological perspective Shuna has &quot;no workable slate&quot;, although limestone was once worked there. The neighbouring islands to the west, Lunga and Eilean Dubh Mòr, are constituted of quartzite, &quot;Scarba conglomerate&quot; and other rocks that lack a commercial value.
It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that this collective noun includes the commercially quarried Easdale, Belnahua, Luing and Seil, plus their larger and relatively recently inhabited close neighbours of Shuna and Torsa with the &quot;many others&quot; being the smaller uninhabited islands and skerries in their immediate vicinity. This then excludes Lunga and Eilean Dubh Mòr and their own outliers that lie to the west of Luing, between Scarba and The Garvellachs.

==Geography==

The main islands of the group are as follows.
Torsa was inhabited until the 1960s. Belnahua had a significant population during the height of the commercial slate quarrying there but in 1914 quarry work ceased, the island was completely abandoned and it has been uninhabited ever since.

Smaller islands, tidal islets only separated at higher stages of the tide, and skerries which are only exposed at lower stages of the tide pepper the seas surrounding the main islands. Most of them are obscure and only Fladda, which has an abandoned lighthouse keeper&#x27;s cottage, and perhaps Insh are ever likely to have been inhabited.

*Belnahua: Fladda, Ormsa
*Easdale: None 
*Luing: Diar Sgeir, Dubh-fheith, Dubh Sgeir, Eilean Loisgte, Fraoch Eilean (2), Funaich Mhòr, Glas Eilean, Rubh Aird Luing, Sgeir Bhuidhe
*Torsa: Eilean Fraoch, Glas Eilean, Torsa Beag
*Seil: Dubh-sgeir, Eilean à Chomraidh, Eilean Bàn-leac, Eilean Buidhe, Eilean Dùin, Eilean nam Beathach, Eilean nam Freumha, Eilean Tornal, Henderson&#x27;s Rock, Insh, Sgeir Beul na h-Uamhaidh
*Shuna: None

Eilean-a-beithich (&quot;island of the birches&quot;) located in Easdale Sound was once one of the Slate Islands. However, it was quarried for slate to a depth of below sea level leaving only the outer rim of the island. Part of this rim was breached by the sea in 1881 flooding the quarry and little visible sign of the island now remains.

==Etymology==
Belnahua is from the Scots Gaelic &quot;Beul na h-Uamha&quot;, meaning &quot;the mouth of the cave&quot; and Torsa is also a Gaelic name although ultimately derived from Old Norse. It means &quot;Thorir&#x27;s island&quot;. The derivations of the other main islands are less clear. Seil and Luing are probably pre-Gaelic in origin and of uncertain meaning. Shuna is &quot;Siùna&quot; in Gaelic and may derive from the Norse for &quot;sea island&quot;. Easdale appears to be the combination of &quot;eas&quot;, which is Gaelic for &quot;waterfall&quot; and &quot;dal&quot;, the Norse for &quot;valley&quot;. However, it is not clear why either description should apply to this tiny island which is low lying and has no waterfalls and the name may have come from the nearby village of the same name on Seil.

==Geology==
The most important bedrock on the islands from a commercial point of view is the Neoproterozoic age Easdale Slate Formation, a pyritic, graphitic pelite belonging to the Easdale Subgroup of the Dalradian Argyll Group. Zones of metamorphosed intrusive igneous rocks occur within the southeast of Seil and andesitic lavas of the Lorn Plateau Lava Formation dominate the west of the island. There are numerous NW-SE aligned basalt and microgabbro dykes which form a part of the ‘Mull Swarm’ which is of early Palaeogene age. Raised marine deposits of sand and gravel occur widely around the margins of some of the islands, a legacy of late Quaternary changes in relative sea-level.

Prior to the Pleistocene ice ages the Slate Islands were part of a long peninsula that ran from what is now mainland Scotland out through Scarba and Jura to Islay until the Firth of Lorn glacier cut through it, creating the islands that exist today. The entire area was covered by an ice sheet during the maximum extent of glaciation and deep channels were cut into what is now the sea bed, creating deep waters of or more in the Firth of Lorn.

==History==
From about the 6th to the 8th century AD the Cenél Loairn kindred controlled what is today known as Lorn, which region includes the Slate Islands, in the then kingdom of Dalriada. Their main base may have been at Dunollie near Oban.

By the late 8th century the area was a zone of conflict between the Celtic rulers of mainland Argyll and the newly arrived Norse settlers. It has been suggested that Seil may be the &quot;Innisibsolian&quot; referred to in the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;, which records a victory by the Scots over a Viking force during the time of Donald II. The Frankish &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot; may record the conquest of the Inner Hebrides by Vikings in 847 and there is an early reference to the Norse presence in the Irish records to a king of &quot;Viking Scotland&quot; whose heir Thórir brought an army to Ireland in 848. Although there are few written references to the Slate Islands for this period the influence of the Norse language on placenames suggests that these islands then became part of the Kingdom of the Isles. Clan MacDougall were an important force in the area responsible for their mainland territories to the Scots crown, but to the Kings of Norway for their island territories until the 1266 Treaty of Perth. At this point the Hebrides and Mann and all rights that the Norwegian crown &quot;had of old therein&quot; were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland.

During the Wars of Scottish Independence the MacDougalls sided with Clan Comyn against King Robert the Bruce, defeating him the Battle of Dalrigh in 1306. Two years later Bruce led three thousand veterans into Argyll against the MacDougalls and at the Battle of the Pass of Brander they were defeated and King Robert held most of their lands to be forfeit, including all their island possessions save for Kerrera. Their fortunes were restored somewhat under John Gallda MacDougall. In the mid-14th century, he relocated from England to Scotland, married a niece of the reigning David II, King of Scotland, and regained the clan&#x27;s ancestral lands in Lorn.

Three centuries later, Clan Dougall was on the losing side again. The failure of King James VII to regain the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland led to the MacDougalls losing much of their land to the Duke of Argyll. The Slate Islands then became part of the Netherlorn estates of the Breadalbane family, a branch of Clan Campbell. From the late 17th century the Dukes of Argyll began to lease land on a competitive basis rather than as a means of strengthening the welfare of their senior clansmen. This resulted in mass evictions in 1669, long before the clearances as such. During the 20th century the Breadalbane land on the islands was sold off as smaller farms and individual houses.

===Slate quarrying===

Easdale slate had been quarried from as early as the 12th century using seasonal labour from the Breadalbane&#x27;s Ardmaddy estate. In 1730 Colin Campbell of Carwhin was appointed as the Captain of Ardmaddy and tasked with exploiting the area&#x27;s natural resources. In 1745 Campbell created the Easdale Marble and Slate Company in order to place extractions from the area on a more commercial basis. At that point Easdale was producing 1 million slates per annum; when Thomas Pennant visited two years later production had increased by 250% and as further quarries were opened this further increased the company&#x27;s production to 5 million per annum by 1800.

Slate quarries were opened on Eilean-a-beithich, Belnahua, Luing and at Balvicar on Seil. Railway lines were laid to take the rock from the quarries to nearby harbours. Peak production was reached in the 1860s at 9 million slates per annum, with export destinations including England, Nova Scotia, the West Indies, the US, Norway and New Zealand. The 6th Earl of Breadalbane had less interest in the industry than his predecessors although during the time of the 7th Earl a new quarry was opened at Ardencaple in the north of Seil. However, disaster struck in 1881. In the early morning of the 22nd November a severe gale from the south-west wind and an exceptionally high tide flooded the quarries on Easdale and at Eilean-a-beithich &quot;a large rocky buttress which supported a sea wall gave way under the excessive pressure of water&quot;. Eilean-a-beithich was never re-opened although production did continue at Easdale, Luing and Balvicar. Changes in demand - clay tiles were rapidly replacing slate as the roofing material of choice - led to commercial production ceasing by 1911 on Seil and in 1914 on Belnahua. Balvicar quarry re-opened from the late 1940s until the early 1960s but slate is no longer mined anywhere in the Slate Islands.

The Isle of Insh was bequeathed to the National Trust for Scotland by the island&#x27;s former owner, David Brearley, when he died in 2016. After assessing the island&#x27;s &#x27;heritage significance&#x27; the trust attracted criticism when it subsequently decided to sell the island to a private company for £353,000 in 2019.

==Economy and transport== 
Today, the islands&#x27; commerce is largely dependent on agriculture, tourism and lobster fishing. The Ellenabeich Heritage Centre which opened in 2000, is run by the Slate Islands Heritage Trust. Located in a former slate quarry-worker&#x27;s cottage, the centre has displays about life in the 19th century, slate quarrying and the local flora, fauna and geology.

Seil has been linked to the Scottish mainland since 1792/3 when the Clachan Bridge, also known as the &quot;Bridge Over the Atlantic&quot;, was built by engineer Robert Mylne. Ferries from Seil depart from Ellenabeich to Easdale, and from Cuan to Luing across the Cuan Sound. The Easdale ferry uses a chain and cog wheels designed by John Whyte in the mid 19th century.

The Firth of Lorn is the seaway used by vessels going to and from Oban and Fort William from points south and the seas around the Slate Islands contain the sites of various shipwrecks. The greatest loss of life in the vicinity was suffered by the unladen Latvian vessel &quot;Helēna Faulbaums&quot;. She left the Mersey on 26 October 1936 en route for Blyth. Encountering a storm, she headed for the Firth of Lorn seeking shelter although the light load meant that the propeller was ineffective in the high seas. At 7pm her steering failed and captain ordered the anchors to be deployed but they could not hold in the deep waters. There is an extensive drying reef to the north of Belnahua and at 10pm that night the &quot;Helēna Faulbaums&quot; struck it broadside and foundered, sinking within ten minutes with the loss of 15 lives including two 18-year-old boys. Four sailors managed to scramble ashore and were rescued the next day by the Islay lifeboat and taken to Crinan. The bodies of the other crew members were washed ashore on Luing.

The waters surrounding all the Slate Islands are part of the Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura Marine Protected Area.

<doc id="490042" wikidata="Q2363433" url="?curid=490042" title="Withington">
<text>Withington is a suburb of Manchester, Greater Manchester, England. Historically part of Lancashire, it lies from Manchester city centre, about south of Fallowfield, north-east of Didsbury and also east of Chorlton-cum-Hardy. Withington has a population of just over 14,000 people, reducing at the 2011 census to 13,422.

In the early 13th century, Withington occupied a feudal estate that included the townships of Withington, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Moss Side, Rusholme, Burnage, Denton and Haughton, held by the Hathersage, Longford and Tatton families, and within the Manor of Manchester and Hundred of Salford in historic county boundaries of Lancashire.

Withington was largely rural until the mid-19th century when it experienced rapid socioeconomic development and urbanisation due to the Industrial Revolution, and Manchester&#x27;s growing level of industrialisation. Withington became part of Manchester in 1904.

Today, the residents of Withington comprise a mixture of families, university students and affluent &quot;young professionals&quot;—often themselves former students. This is in a large part due to its education links—particularly the proximity to the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University. As a consequence, Withington is predominantly an area of mixed affluence. It is also a centre for clinical excellence with one of the largest cancer treatment centres in Europe—Christie Hospital—and Withington Community Hospital.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
In Anglo-Saxon times the area was sparsely settled by Mercians and Danes and Didsbury may have been established in King Edward the Elder&#x27;s reign as a fortification against the Danes. Following the Norman Conquest the lands of south Lancashire were granted to Roger of Poitou and by the early 13th century the Manor of Withington appears to be a sub-manor of the Manor of Manchester.
The first recorded description of Withington referred to the area as a willow-copse farmstead, and giving rise to the Anglo-Saxon name &quot;Wīðign-tūn&quot;, with withy meaning &quot;willow branch used for bundling&quot;. In the early 13th century, the Manor of Withington covered a wide area including Withington, Didsbury, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Moss Side, Rusholme, Burnage, Denton and Haughton. The first Lord of the Manor of Withington is thought to have been William, son of Wulfrith de Withington.

Withington was one of the townships of the ancient parish of Manchester in the Salford Hundred of Lancashire, and a sub-manor of the Manor of Manchester. In the 13th century, Robert Grelle (sometimes Grelley), Lord of the Manchester Manor, granted free warren in Withington to Matthew de Hathersage (or Haversage), son of William, in exchange for one knight&#x27;s fee. Little is known of the Hathersage family, except that they descended to the Longford family, and are connected with the manors of Hathersage and Longford, both in Derbyshire. The lordship of Withington remained in the Hathersage/Longford family for over 300 years.

===Tudor, Stuart and Georgian periods===
At the end of the 16th century, Nicholas Longford sold Withington to the Mosleys (originally &#x27;Moseley&#x27;), an influential Anglo-Irish family of wool merchants who subsequently became wealthy landowners in Staffordshire: Nicholas Mosley later became Lord of the Manor of Manchester. Hough End Hall was built by Sir Nicholas Mosley in 1596 as the new Withington manor house—the original medieval manor house was situated south-east of the modern junction of Mauldeth Road West and Princess Road, which was surrounded by a moat. In 1750 it was demolished to make way for a farm building, but some of the moat was left. An Ordnance Survey map of 1845 shows it as &quot;Withington Old Hall&quot;, and it later came to be known as &quot;Chorlton&#x27;s Farm&quot; or &quot;Old Hall Farm&quot;. Today, the site is occupied by Eddisbury Avenue and no trace remains of the old house. There are still today some remnants of this moat underneath Old Moat Primary School, on Old Moat Lane. In the early 18th century, the Withington Manor was once again sold, this time to the Egertons of Tatton.

Withington as a village developed around Wilmslow Road, a main road, connecting Manchester to Wilmslow which was the only direct route between Manchester and Wilmslow at the time. Farming still dominated the area, although there is evidence in maps of a substantial cotton house on Cotton Lane, which later appears to become Withington Hall. Some historians dispute the cotton house as there is little record of it, and claim &quot;Cotton Lane&quot; comes from land in the area which was jointly held by the townships of Withington, Didsbury and Burnage (a relic of the medieval open field system). This area was the old village centre however, although the only relic of its former importance is the small flower display on the corner of Wilmslow Road and Cotton Lane.

===Victorian and later periods===
The trade in Withington, and consequent traffic on Wilmslow Road, increased steadily as the city of Manchester flourished in the early 19th century. Turnpike roads subsequently became increasingly unpopular, and were abolished completely in 1881. Cheaper transport in and out of Manchester became an important factor in the growth of the area. The Withington and West Didsbury railway station on the Manchester South District Line, run by the Midland Railway, provided train services to Manchester Central railway station. The railway station closed to passengers in 1961.

Withington&#x27;s Parish Church of St Paul was built in 1841; the architects of St Paul&#x27;s Church were Hayley &amp; Brown and it was extended in 1864. Many other chapels and churches proliferated, including Methodist, Presbyterian and Roman Catholic.

As the population increased, the need for schools grew. A day school was held in a schoolroom underneath the Wesleyan chapel on Old Hall Lane, until the Church of England established a new church school with public donations next to its new parish church in 1844, St Paul&#x27;s Primary School, on land donated by benefactor Wilbraham Egerton, 1st Earl Egerton.

Withington had a Huguenot population with family and commercial ties to Germany. Among them was the Souchay family, who lived at Withington House on Wilmslow Road (the present site of the telephone exchange at Old Broadway). Charles (or Carl) Souchay and his wife Adelaide (or Adelheid) were benefactors of St Paul&#x27;s church school, and the first wedding to take place at St Paul&#x27;s was the marriage of the eldest Souchay daughter in 1850. The Souchays were related to Cécile Mendelssohn Bartholdy, wife of the German composer Felix Mendelssohn. In the 1840s, Mendelssohn made several visits to Britain, and stayed on occasion with friends in the Withington/Didsbury area. Mendelssohn wrote a number of letters to friends from Eltville House, the residence of another member of the Souchay family, John D. Souchay, which was situated on the south-east corner of Fog Lane and Wilmslow Road (later renamed Didsbury Priory). An account exists of an occasion in April 1847 when Mendelssohn visited St Paul&#x27;s Church to play the newly installed pipe organ. The composer was suffering from ill health, and this proved to be his last British tour; less than six months later, on 4 November, aged 38, Mendelssohn died in Leipzig. The Souchays are buried in St Paul&#x27;s churchyard.

In 1861, a public library and village hall were opened. The library was rebuilt in 1927 with a neo-classical facade.

On 28 April 1910, French pilot Louis Paulhan landed his Farman biplane in Barcicroft Fields, Pytha Fold Farm on the borders of Withington, Burnage and Didsbury, at the end of the first powered flight from London to Manchester, with a six-hour overnight stop near Lichfield, Staffordshire. Paulhan beat the British contender, Claude Grahame-White, winning a £10,000 prize offered by the Daily Mail. Two special trains were chartered to Burnage railway station to take spectators to the landing. Paulhan&#x27;s progress was followed throughout by a special train carrying his wife, Henri Farman and his mechanics. A house in Paulhan Road is marked by a blue plaque to commemorate his achievement.

A large aerodrome was built in 1917–18 on the westerly edge of Withington, to the southwest of the junction of Mauldeth Road and Princess Road, on what is now the site of Houghend Playing Fields. The official name was Alexandra Park Aerodrome, but it was also variously referred to as &quot;Withington&quot; and &quot;Didsbury&quot;. Closure came in autumn 1924 when Lord Egerton of Tatton would not agree to the site&#x27;s continued use for flying. The large hangars were then demolished and Princess Road extended southwards through the eastern edge of the site.

==Governance==
Withington was anciently a township and chapelry within the parish of Manchester and hundred of Salford. In 1866 Withington became a separate civil parish. Following the Public Health Act 1875, Withington Town Hall was built in 1881 on Lapwing Lane, originally to house Withington Local Board of Health, then later occupied by the Withington Urban District Council, formed under the Local Government Act 1894. In 1904 the urban district was abolished and Withington became part of the County Borough of Manchester. The old Town Hall building has been converted into private apartments with new-build apartments to the south (back) and east (side). On 1 October 1933 the parish was abolished and merged with South Manchester. In 1901 the parish had a population of 16,050.

Manchester Withington is a Parliamentary Constituency which encompasses Withington village, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Burnage and Didsbury (East and West). Manchester Withington became the first constituency in the City of Manchester since 1929 to elect a Liberal (Democrat) MP upon John Leech&#x27;s gain in the 2005 General Election, when the constituency also experienced the largest swing of that election, taking the previously 11,524 majority Labour safe seat by 667 votes – a swing of 17%. This was possibly attributable to the constituency&#x27;s large student population. The previous incumbent of the seat, Keith Bradley, had held the seat for Labour for 18 years; Lucy Powell was chosen as the successor candidate to Keith Bradley in March 2007, to try to regain the seat at the next general election. However, Leech retained the seat for the Liberal Democrats at the 2010 General Election, with 44.6% of the vote (an increase of 2.4% over 2005); Powell came second with 40.5% of the vote (a decrease of 0.4%).

Historically, Withington was a much larger area than today. Since the district was absorbed into the City of Manchester in 1904, the three city wards of Didsbury, Fallowfield, and Withington took on their own identities and are now seen as distinct areas. The Conservative Party could once regard this area as a heartland for them, with its largely middle class population and relatively suburban image. The &#x27;flight of the middle classes&#x27; to rural Cheshire, however, led to many of Withington&#x27;s larger homes being sold off for student flats. This resulted in a changing socio-economic structure that would ultimately favour Labour and more recently, for a time, the Liberal-Democrats.

In the 2011, 2012 and 2014 local government elections however the Liberal-Democrats lost every Council seat in Withington Constituency and in the City of Manchester as a whole that they contested, leaving Labour with 95 out of 96 Council seats.

Withington and Old Moat wards are currently represented on Manchester City Council by three councillors each: Becky Chambers (Labour Party), Chris Wills (Labour and Co-operative Party), and Rebecca Moore (Labour) in Withington; Gavin White (Labour), Suzannah Reeves (Labour) and Garry Bridges (Labour) in Old Moat. Council elections took place on the 2 May 2019 with each ward returning one councillor, Becky Chambers and Garry Bridges respectively in Withington and Old Moat wards.

==Transport==


===Buses===

Withington has bus links into the Manchester city centre, partly because of its position on the Wilmslow Road bus corridor which is served by very frequent buses and has been said by some analysts to be the busiest in Europe. The majority of services are operated by Stagecoach Manchester and First Greater Manchester. Other bus routes run along Burton Road and Old Moat Lane to the city centre; there are also bus routes crossing Withington East-West.

===Railway===

Until the 1960s, Withington had a railway station on Palatine Road, &quot;Withington and West Didsbury&quot;, on the Midland Railway&#x27;s Manchester South District Railway. This station was closed in 1961 by British Rail; today the nearest railway station to Withington is , located to the east in Ladybarn.

===Metrolink Trams===

In 2013, the old Midland Railway line was reopened as a light rail line as part of the Manchester Metrolink network. Today, Metrolink trams provide a direct tram link to Manchester city centre on the South Manchester Line, serving , and tram stops. The name of Withington tram stop has been called into question as it is located on Princess Road, approximately from the centre of Withington.

The Metrolink line through Withington was first proposed in the early 1980s but funding was not secured until the 21st century. The project was then put on hold due to escalating costs; new funding was sought through the Manchester Congestion Charge,
but this was rejected in a public referendum in 2008. The project was revived in May 2009 with a new funding package from local and national government. Clearance work began on the line in 2011 and it was completed in 2013.

==Education==
Withington Girls&#x27; School was established in 1890 and provides private education for girls aged 7 to 18. Notable alumni include Judith Chalmers.

In the 1930s, the Manchester Grammar School moved to new premises in Fallowfield, from its original position near the site of the present Manchester Cathedral. Although seen to be in Fallowfield, its location is also within the boundaries of the Withington locality. The school has been attended by actors such as Ben Kingsley and Robert Powell, cricketer Mike Atherton, and writer and broadcaster Martin Sixsmith.

Withington is served by the following local primary schools:
* Ladybarn Primary School
* St Cuthbert&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School

<doc id="490043" wikidata="Q1551908" url="?curid=490043" title="Out Skerries">
<text>The Out Skerries are an archipelago of islets, some inhabited, in Shetland, Scotland, and are the easternmost part of Shetland. Locally, they are usually called Da Skerries or just Skerries.

==Geography==
The Out Skerries lie about northeast of Whalsay; and Bound Skerry forms the easternmost part of Shetland, lying just 300 km (around 190 miles) west from Tjeldstø in Norway. The main islands are Housay, Bruray and Grunay.

A large number of skerries, islets and stacks surround the main group. These include the Hevda Skerries and Wether Holm to the north, the Holm to the south and Lamba Stack and Flat Lamba Stack to the east. Stoura Stack and the Hogg are to the south of Grunay. Bound Skerry, which has a lighthouse, is flanked by Little Bound Skerry and Horn Skerry.

Beyond Mio Ness at the southwest tip of Housay are North and South Benelip and the Easter Skerries, as well as Filla, Short and Long Guen (the Guens), Bilia Skerry, and Swaba Stack. In an isolated group between the main Out Skerries and the Mainland, are Little Skerry and the Vongs, and Muckle Skerry is another outlier lying further north.

==Etymology==
Most of the Skerries placenames have a Norse origin. The &quot;Out&quot; name derives from one or both of two Old Norse words. &quot;Austr&quot; means &quot;east&quot; and may have been used to distinguish Out Skerries from Ve Skerries or &quot;west skerries&quot;, and &quot;utsker&quot; means &quot;outer&quot;. &quot;Skerry&quot; is from the Old Norse &quot;sker&quot; and refers to a small rocky island or a rocky reef.

Housay is from the Old Norse &quot;Húsey&quot; meaning &quot;house island&quot;, although this name is now little used by locals, who prefer &quot;West Isle&quot;. Bruray may be from the Norse &quot;brú&quot; and mean &quot;bridge island&quot; due to its position between West Isle and Grunay, the latter meaning simply &quot;green island&quot;. The derivation of Bound Skerry is more problematic, but may be from &quot;bønn&quot;, meaning &quot;forerunner&quot;, a reference to this being the first land a ship encounters en route to Shetland from Bergen.

==History==

===Prehistory===
There is evidence of Neolithic inhabitation including two house sites at Queyness. The Battle Pund is a rectangle across, marked out by boulders, dating from the Bronze Age. It is similar to a structure at Hjaltadans in Fetlar, but its purpose is unknown.

There is a massive ruined structure on the north shore of Grunay known locally as &quot;the broch&quot; although it is not known if it dates from the Iron Age, when such structures were built throughout the far north of Scotland. The name &quot;Benelips&quot; possibly originating from the Old Norse &quot;bon&quot; meaning &quot;to pray&quot; hints at the existence of an early Christian hermitage on these remote islets.

Dey (1991) speculates that the folklore of the troll-like trows, and perhaps that of the selkie may be based in part on the Norse arrival of the Norse settlers. She states that the conquest by the Vikings sent the indigenous, dark-haired Picts into hiding and that &quot;many stories exist in Shetland of these strange people, smaller and darker than the tall, blond Vikings who, having been driven off their land into sea caves, emerged at night to steal from the new land owners.&quot; The skerry of Trollsholm and its cleft of Trolli Geo indicate the presence of this folklore on Out Skerries.

===Historic period===
The Out Skerries have been permanently inhabited from the Norse period onwards.

There are a number of shipwrecks around the islands include the Dutch vessels &quot;Kennemerland&quot; (1664) and &quot;De Liefde&quot; (1711); and &quot;North Wind&quot; (1906), which was carrying wood which was salvaged and used by the islanders for their houses. Some of the gold from these wrecks was found in 1960. The wrecks of the &quot;Kennemerland&quot; and the Danish warship &quot;Wrangles Palais&quot; (1687) lie within a Historic Marine Protected Area.

Due to their remote and rugged nature, the islanders were accused of smuggling and wrecking. Tammy Tyrie&#x27;s Hidey Hol was used by islanders to avoid press gangs.

Until the early 20th century, a lot of sea () fishing was conducted from traditional fishing boats known as &quot;sixareens&quot;.
===World War II===
Being so close to Norway, the islands were of strategic importance in World War II and were a regular landfall for Norwegian boats carrying escapees from the Nazi occupation. The local coastguard were responsible for the refugees and at one point during the war were issued with a tommy gun, although initially no-one knew how to use it. German planes frequently flew over at low altitudes, strafing the Grunay lighthouse shore station in 1941 and dropping a bomb in 1942. The latter attack killed Mary Anderson, the only local casualty of the war and Grunay was evacuated shortly thereafter. A month later a Canadian bomber crashed on Grunay and in 1990, a plaque was raised to commemorate this event. Dey (1991) states that the bomber was a &quot;British&quot; Blenheim bomber with a crew of two Canadians and one Englishman. The plaque ceremony was attended by the family of F/Sgt Jay Oliver, one of the two Canadian casualties and Peter Johnson, a local man who had witnessed the crash aged eight years. During the war an official letter was sent in secret to the local sub-postmistress with instructions that it be opened in the event of a German invasion. After the war it was returned, unopened.

==Island life==
Around 35 people live on the two main islands, Housay and Bruray, just east of the main Shetland Islands group. A third island, Grunay, is currently uninhabited. The two main islands are linked by a bridge. There are two shops, an airstrip, a church on Housay, a police station, a fish processing factory and a community hall where dances are held (especially for the celebration for the annual Lerwick to Skerries Yacht Race held in August). The islands are famous for wildlife, with frequent sightings of rare birds.
There is little peat on the Out Skerries, so the residents have been granted rights to cut it on Whalsay. The soil in the islands is thin and infertile, but is heaped into riggs, for better cultivation of potatoes, carrots and swedes. The main industry on the islands is fishing. There is still some sheep farming, but it is far less important than it once was. Tourism on the other hand has increased.
The islands have a (mothballed) primary school. The primary school in 2015 had just one pupil. The previously open secondary school was the smallest in the UK; in 2010 the school had only three students. This secondary school was closed in 2014 by the approval of the Scottish government. In 2016 the school only had one student. The story went viral and he received 10,000 Christmas cards that year from all around the world.

The old schoolhouse found reuse as the second-smallest cinema in the UK (the smallest in Scotland), called Schoolhouse Cinema, which opened in 2017 and offers free admissions and free snacks.
==Transport==
*The Skerries Bridge, which links Bruray to Housay, was built in 1957, replacing the first bridge built in 1899.
*There is around a mile of road, along which most of the population lives.
*There is a ferry to the islands from Vidlin and Lerwick.
*There is a small airstrip on Bruray.

On television, Davenport is known for his roles in the ensemble drama series &quot;FlashForward,&quot; &quot;Smash&quot;, and &quot;The Morning Show&quot; as well as his leading role in the 2013 ITV drama series &quot;Breathless&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Davenport, the son of actor Nigel Davenport and actress Maria Aitken, was born in Wimbledon, London, and lived in Ibiza, Spain, for the first seven years of his life. His uncle is writer and former Conservative MP Jonathan Aitken, his maternal grandmother was socialite Penelope Aitken, his maternal grandfather was politician William Aitken, and one of his maternal great-grandfathers was John Maffey, 1st Baron Rugby. Through his uncle Jonathan Aitken&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth Rees-Williams, Davenport is a step-cousin of Damian, Jared, and Jamie Harris, her sons from her marriage to Richard Harris.

His parents divorced when he was seven, at which point he was sent to the independent Dragon School in Oxford, as his parents did not want him to become involved in the divorce proceedings. He then went on to attend Cheltenham College, a boarding independent school for boys (now co-educational), in the spa town of Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, followed by the British American Drama Academy in London.

Davenport took a gap year after attending Cheltenham College. A director from Theatr Clwyd in Wales was impressed by his performance in a summer drama course and asked Davenport to work for him. He performed bit parts in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, where he became friends with Rhys Ifans. The following year, he began attending the University of East Anglia (UEA), concentrating in film studies and English literature. He dabbled in acting again during his time at UEA, but considered becoming a member of a film crew rather than acting.

== Career ==
After Davenport&#x27;s graduation, his mother advised him to write to John Cleese requesting work on the set of his upcoming film, &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot;, so that he could gain experience behind the camera. Cleese instead sent Davenport&#x27;s letter to the casting department, and he was subsequently cast in his first onscreen role as a trainee zookeeper. After the production of &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot; was completed, Davenport found an agent who secured him an audition for the role of Miles Stewart in the BBC television drama series &quot;This Life&quot;.

Since then Davenport has played roles in many successful films and TV series, including &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, &quot;Coupling&quot; and &quot;Ultraviolet&quot;, as well as the box office hit &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, and its sequels, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; and &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;.

During his career Davenport has also performed voice-overs, having narrated the audio versions of John Buchan&#x27;s &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; and recorded parts in Anthony Burgess&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. He also provides the voice over for the British MasterCard advertisements (the American being done by Billy Crudup).

In 2006, he featured in the ITV1 drama &quot;The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant&quot; and in 2009 starred in the film &quot;The Boat That Rocked&quot;.
In 2007 Davenport was cast in &quot;Swingtown&quot;, a period and relationship drama for CBS about the impact of sexual and social liberation in 1970s American suburban households, with story arcs involving open marriages and key parties. The series was cancelled after one season.

In 2008, Davenport was cast in the ABC pilot &quot;FlashForward&quot;, which was based on a Robert J. Sawyer novel. In the series, Davenport played the character of Lloyd Simcoe, a physicist allegedly responsible for a worldwide blackout, which causes the whole world to see the future. The show was cancelled after a single season.

In February 2011, Davenport was cast in the NBC musical drama pilot &quot;Smash&quot;. It ran for two seasons and became a cult favorite on streaming services. The first season of the series follows a group of people putting on a Marilyn Monroe musical on Broadway. Davenport plays the musical&#x27;s director. The second season expands as the various cast members branch out into other productions; Davenport&#x27;s character, Derek Wills, quits the Broadway production of &quot;Bombshell&quot; to pursue a small off-Broadway musical and take it to Broadway with his protégé, Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee). The season ends with the two shows competing at the Tonys.

Davenport starred as the replacement singer in the video for Snow Patrol&#x27;s single &quot;Called Out in the Dark&quot;, released on YouTube on 17 August 2011, alongside Tara Summers and Gary Lightbody.

2018 saw Davenport&#x27;s Broadway debut playing the Earl of Warwick in a revival of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot; starring Condola Rashad.

==Personal life==
Davenport married actress Michelle Gomez. On 28 February 2023, Gomez announced on Instagram that she, Davenport, and their son had become naturalised American citizens.

<text>Petawawa ( ) is a town located in the eastern portion of Southern Ontario. Situated in the Ottawa Valley, with a population of 18,160 (2021 Census), Petawawa is the most populous municipality in Renfrew County.

==History==
The earliest settlement in the Petawawa area was inhabited by the Algonquin First Nation. The name of Petawawa originates from a local Algonquin language word, &quot;biidaawewe&quot;, meaning &quot;where one hears a noise like this&quot;. The original spelling of the name of the town was &quot;Petewawa&quot; and while there are no sources showing when it officially changed to Petawawa, Privy Council documents indicate the name Petawawa being formally used in correspondence as early as 27 March 1907. Research of photographs after 1916 with the former spelling have not been found. While the records of the official name change are non-existent, it has been speculated that the influx of immigration to the area changed the pronunciation of the word from its native roots to a more European pronunciation. Over time this may have changed the spelling of the Town&#x27;s name into the present day format.

In the late 19th century, the area was surveyed and settled by emigres from Scotland, Ireland and Germany. The land was unsuitable for crops, but the heavily forested surroundings were useful for logging. Petawawa was incorporated as a township in 1865. The Canadian military acquired land in the area in 1905, which later became Canadian Forces Base Petawawa. During this period it was used as an internment camp for German POWs during World War I. and World War II. Later, it became home to the Canadian Airborne Regiment before it was disbanded in 1995. Today, it is one of Canada&#x27;s largest ground forces bases with members deployed throughout the world on various missions supporting the United Nations in peacekeeping or the War on Terror.

In 1961, the urban area of Petawawa was incorporated as a separate village municipality. On July 1, 1997, the village and township amalgamated to form the Town of Petawawa.

==Geography==
The town lies on the west bank of the Ottawa River, at the confluence of the Petawawa River. Situated across the Ottawa River from the Laurentian Mountains, and east of Algonquin Park, Petawawa is a favourite stop for outdoor enthusiasts, anglers, hikers, canoers, and kayakers.

In addition to the primary urban core of Petawawa, the town also comprises the communities of Black Bay, Kramer Subdivision, Laurentian View, McGuire, Petawawa Point, Pine Meadows, Pine Ridge, Pinehurst Estates and Riverview.

===Climate===
Petawawa has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with long, cold, snowy winters and warm summers. 
== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Petawawa had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
Special Note: According to the 1961 Census Of Canada, in CS92-539, Table 6, Page 113, the Village Of Petawawa was Incorporated out of territory formerly belonging to the Township Of Petawawa on January 1st, 1961. Thus any earlier pre-1961 population figures for urban Petawawa were for unincorporated communities still belonging to the Township Of Petawawa at that time.

==Economy==
Petawawa&#x27;s primary employer is the Canadian Government. Most of Petawawa&#x27;s residents work as civilian employees, or as members of the Canadian Forces at CFB Petawawa which is home to 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group and 4 Canadian Division Support Group.

Another major employer is Chalk River Laboratories located nearby in Chalk River.

==Transportation==
Ontario Highway 17, Ontario Northlands bus service from Ottawa and the local commercial airport (Pembroke Airport) located in Petawawa, all provide access to this town.

<doc id="490060" wikidata="Q5457681" url="?curid=490060" title="Flast v. Cohen">
<text>Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968), was a United States Supreme Court case holding that federal taxpayers have standing to seek relief from the courts for claims that federal tax money is being used for unconstitutional purposes in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

The Supreme Court decided in &quot;Frothingham v. Mellon&quot; (1923), that a taxpayer did not have standing to sue the federal government to prevent expenditures if his only injury is an anticipated increase in taxes. &quot;Frothingham v. Mellon&quot; did not recognize a constitutional barrier against federal taxpayer lawsuits. Rather, it denied standing because the petitioner did not allege &quot;a breach by Congress of the specific constitutional limitations imposed upon an exercise of the taxing and spending power.&quot; Because the purpose of standing is to avoid burdening the court with situations in which there is no real controversy, standing is used to ensure that the parties in the suit are properly adversarial, &quot;not whether the issue itself is justiciable.&quot;

In 1968, Florence Flast joined several others in filing a lawsuit against Wilbur Cohen, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, contending that spending funds on religious schools violated the First Amendment&#x27;s ban on the establishment of religion. The district court denied standing, and the Supreme Court heard the appeal.

==Decision==
On June 10, 1968, the Court issued an 8–1 decision. 

Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Earl Warren established a &quot;double nexus&quot; test which a taxpayer must satisfy in order to have standing. First, he must &quot;establish a logical link between [taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.&quot; Second, &quot;show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations upon the exercise of the taxing and spending power and &quot;not&quot; simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art. I, §8.&quot; Only when both nexuses have been satisfied may the petitioner have standing to sue.

===Ruling===
The Court ruled that petitioners had satisfied both nexuses and therefore had standing to sue as taxpayers. First, their status as taxpayers only conferred standing to complain that expenditures made under the Congressional power to spend for the general welfare under the tax and spend clause were unconstitutional. Second, the Establishment Clause specifically limited the taxing and spending power: 

Our history vividly illustrates that one of the specific evils feared by those who drafted the Establishment Clause and fought for its adoption was that the taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion over another or to support religion in general. James Madison, who is generally regarded as the leading architect of the First Amendment, observed in his famous Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments that &quot;the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever...The Establishment Clause was designed as a specific bulwark against such potential abuses of governmental power, and that clause of the First Amendment operates as a specific constitutional limitation upon the exercise of by Congress of the taxing and spending power conferred by Art. I, §8.

The Court held that the taxpayers had standing to have their suit heard by a federal court. The Court, however, expressed &quot;no view at all on the merits of appellants&#x27; claims in this case.&quot;

=== Concurring Opinions ===
Justice William O. Douglas advocated dealing with the seeming contradiction by overturning &quot;Frothingham&quot; completely.

Justice Potter Stewart also concurred, emphasizing the ruling permitted standing where &quot;a specific expenditure of federal funds violates the Establishment Clause.&quot; Justice Abe Fortas wrote similarly but advocated further to &quot;confine the ruling&quot; strictly to cases of federal expenditure in violation of the Establishment Clause.

=== Dissent ===
In a strongly worded dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan argued against the majority&#x27;s decision. Harlan believed that &quot;Frothingham&quot; was correct in its conclusion, despite his disagreement with some of its reasoning. He argued that the United States collects and holds taxes not as a &quot;stakeholder or trustee&quot; for taxpayers, but as a &quot;surrogate for the population at large.&quot; Therefore, in alignment with &quot;Frothingham&quot;, Harlan believed that individuals did not have standing as taxpayers to sue over federal expenditures. He also expressed concern about the potential abuse of public actions, legal actions brought on behalf of the public, resulting from this ruling. Harlan argued that this ruling would upset the balance of powers, leading the Court towards becoming the &quot;Council of Revision&quot; as proposed but ultimately rejected in the Constitutional Convention.

== Significance ==
The &quot;Flast&quot; decision is most significant in contributing to establishing a standard for taxpayer standing; however, the &quot;Flast&quot; test has been primarily limited to cases rising under the Establishment Clause.

===&quot;Flast&quot; test===
The Court developed a two-part test to determine whether the plaintiffs had standing to sue. First, because a taxpayer alleges injury only by virtue of his liability for taxes, the Court held that &quot;a taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, § 8, of the Constitution.&quot; *479 Id., at 102, 88 S.Ct., at 1954. Second, the Court required the taxpayer to &quot;show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations upon the exercise of the taxing and spending power and &quot;not&quot; simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art. I, § 8.&quot; Id., at 102-103, 88 S.Ct., at 1954.&quot;

<text>M-1, also known as Woodward Avenue, is a north–south state trunkline highway in the Metro Detroit area of the US state of Michigan. The highway, called &quot;Detroit&#x27;s Main Street&quot;, runs from Detroit north-northwesterly to Pontiac. It is one of the five principal avenues of Detroit, along with Michigan, Grand River, Gratiot, and Jefferson avenues. These streets were platted in 1805 by Judge Augustus B. Woodward, namesake to Woodward Avenue. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has listed the highway as the Automotive Heritage Trail, an All-American Road in the National Scenic Byways Program. It has also been designated a Pure Michigan Byway by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), and was also included in the MotorCities National Heritage Area designated by the US Congress in 1998.

The trunkline is the dividing line between Detroit&#x27;s East and West sides and connects to some of the city&#x27;s major freeways like Interstate 94 (I-94, Edsel Ford Freeway) and M-8 (Davison Freeway). Woodward Avenue exits Detroit at M-102 (8 Mile Road) and runs through the city&#x27;s northern suburbs in Oakland County on its way to Pontiac. In between, Woodward Avenue passes through several historic districts in Detroit and provides access to many businesses in the area. The name &quot;Woodward Avenue&quot; has become synonymous with Detroit, cruising culture and the automotive industry.

Woodward Avenue was created after the Great Fire of 1805 in Detroit. The thoroughfare followed the route of the Saginaw Trail, an Indian trail that linked Detroit with Pontiac, Flint, and Saginaw. The Saginaw Trail connected to the Mackinaw Trail, which ran north to the Straits of Mackinac at the tip of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. In the age of the auto trails, Woodward Avenue was part of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway that connected Portland, Maine, with Portland, Oregon, through Ontario in Canada. It was also part of the Dixie Highway, which connected Michigan with Florida. Woodward Avenue was the location of the first mile (1.6 km) of concrete-paved roadway in the country. When Michigan created the State Trunkline Highway System in 1913, the roadway was included, numbered as part of M-10 in 1919. Later, it was part of US Highway 10 (US 10) following the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System. Since 1970, it has borne the M-1 designation. The roadway carried streetcar lines from the 1860s until the 1950s; a new streetcar line known as the QLine opened along part of M-1 in 2017.

==Route description==
Like other state highways in Michigan, the section of Woodward Avenue designated M-1 is maintained by MDOT. In 2021, the department&#x27;s traffic surveys showed that on average, 68,359 vehicles used the highway daily south of 14 Mile Road in and 15,909 vehicles did so each day in north of Chicago Boulevard in , the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. All of M-1 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. As well as the sections of Woodward Avenue in Pontiac that are part of Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75) and Business US 24 (Bus. US 24), all of M-1 is a Pure Michigan Byway and an All-American Road. Woodward Avenue is considered to be the divider between the East and West sides of the city of Detroit.

===Detroit and Highland Park===

Woodward Avenue starts at an intersection with Jefferson Avenue next to Hart Plaza about from the Detroit River. The plaza is regarded as the birthplace of the Ford Motor Company, and it is located near Huntington Plaza and the Renaissance Center, headquarters for General Motors (GM). The first block of Woodward Avenue, between Jefferson Avenue and Larned Street, is a pedestrian plaza, the Spirit of Detroit Plaza, home of the namesake statue used to symbolize the city. Woodward Avenue runs north-northwesterly away from the river through the heart of downtown Detroit and the Financial District. Along the way, it passes several important and historic sites, including notable buildings like One Woodward Avenue, the Guardian Building, and The Qube. Further north, Woodward Avenue runs around Campus Martius Park and enters the Lower Woodward Avenue Historic District, a retail, commercial, and residential district listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). After that historic district, the avenue travels through the middle of Grand Circus Park; the northern edge of the park is bounded by Adams Avenue, where state maintenance begins.

North of Adams Avenue, Woodward Avenue is a state trunkline designated M-1. The highway crosses to the west of Comerica Park and Ford Field, home of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Detroit Tigers and the National Football League&#x27;s Detroit Lions, respectively. Woodward passes the historic Fox Theatre before it crosses over I-75 (Fisher Freeway) without an interchange; access between the two highways is through the service drives that connect to adjacent interchanges. North of the freeway, M-1 passes Little Caesars Arena, home of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings and the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Detroit Pistons. A six-lane street, the highway travels through mixed residential and commercial areas of Midtown including the Midtown Woodward Historic District, another district listed on the NRHP. South of I-94, Woodward heads through the Cultural Center Historic District, which includes the campus of Wayne State University, the Detroit Public Library, and the Detroit Institute of Arts; the institute and the nearby Detroit Historical Museum showcase the city&#x27;s automotive history.
North of I-94, Woodward passes through New Center; this district is home to Cadillac Place, the former headquarters of GM. The neighborhoods on either side of the highway transition in composition north of New Center; this area is mostly residential in nature. Between the intersections with Webb Street/Woodland Street and Tuxedo Street/Tennyson Street, Woodward Avenue leaves the city of Detroit for the first time and crosses into Highland Park, an enclave within Detroit. It is within Highland Park that M-1 intersects M-8, the Davison Freeway. Woodward passes over the Davison, which was the first urban, depressed freeway in the US, at an interchange south of Highland Park&#x27;s downtown business district. M-1 crosses that district and runs next to the historic Highland Park Ford Plant, home of the original moving assembly line used to produce Model Ts; opened in 1910, the plant&#x27;s assembly line dropped the time needed to build a car from 12 hours to 93 minutes and allowed Ford to meet demand for the car.

M-1 crosses back into Detroit at the intersection with McNichols Road; the latter street occupies the 6 Mile location in Detroit&#x27;s Mile Road System. North of this intersection, Woodward Avenue widens into a boulevard, a divided street with a median; left turns along this section of roadway are made by performing a Michigan left maneuver using the U-turn crossovers in the median. Between McNichols and 7 Mile Road, Woodward Avenue travels to the east of the Detroit Golf Club in the Palmer Park area. North of 7 Mile, the highway runs to the west of the Michigan State Fairgrounds and to the east of the Palmer Woods Historic District. The northern edge of the fairgrounds is at M-102 (8 Mile Road), which is also where Woodward Avenue exits Detroit for the second time; the two boulevards cross in a large interchange.

===Oakland County===

Crossing the border into the suburb of Ferndale in Oakland County, the highway runs through residential neighborhoods but is lined with adjacent businesses. The intersection with 9 Mile Road marks the suburb&#x27;s downtown area. Further north in Pleasant Ridge, the north-northwesterly path of Woodward Avenue changes as the road turns to the northwest. After the curve, M-1 meets I-696 (Reuther Freeway); immediately north of this interchange in Huntington Woods is the Detroit Zoo. North of 11 Mile Road, Woodward Avenue forms the border between Berkley to the west and Royal Oak to the east. The highway passes the Roseland Park Cemetery north of 12 Mile Road before crossing fully into Royal Oak. Near 13 Mile Road, the trunkline passes through a commercial district anchored by a shopping center and Beaumont Hospital. North of 14 Mile Road in Birmingham, M-1 and Woodward Avenue leaves the original route, which is named Old Woodward Avenue, and runs to the east of it to bypass that suburb&#x27;s downtown area. The highway crosses the River Rouge and returns to its original routing north of Maple (15 Mile) Road.
North of Birmingham, Woodward crosses through part of Bloomfield Township for the first time before entering Bloomfield Hills. That suburb&#x27;s downtown is centered on the intersection with Long Lake Road; Woodward passes between a pair of golf courses north of there. The highway enters the south side of Pontiac&#x27;s residential neighborhoods after crossing back into Bloomfield Township. At the intersection with Square Lake Road, M-1 terminates. Woodward Avenue continues northwesterly into Pontiac carrying the BL I-75 and Bus. US 24 designations; it terminates after the two directions of the boulevard diverge and form a one-way loop around the city&#x27;s business district.

==Cultural significance==

===Scenic and historic designations===

Many historical sites are located along Woodward Avenue, which was included in the MotorCities National Heritage Area when it was created on November 6, 1998. The road was designated what is now called a Pure Michigan Byway by MDOT in 1999, and a National Scenic Byway by the FHWA National Scenic Byways Program on June 13, 2002, the only urban road at the time with that classification. It was later upgraded to All-American Road status on October 16, 2009; such roads have highly unique features and are significant enough to be tourist destinations unto themselves. In announcing the byway status in 2002, Norman Mineta, then United States Secretary of Transportation, said that &quot;Woodward Avenue put the world on wheels, and America&#x27;s automobile heritage is represented along this corridor.&quot;
The Woodward Avenue Action Association (WA3), the local agency that acts as the stewards and advocates for the All-American Road and Pure Michigan Byway designations as well as adjacent historical sites, obtained a grant for $45,000 (equivalent to $ in ) from the FHWA in 2011 to install a set of 50 custom road signs along M-1 between Detroit and Pontiac. WA3 sells replicas of these signs to discourage theft. Profits are also being used along with money from clothing and other merchandise to support the Woodward Avenue Beautification Fund, a special endowment created in 2010 to aid the 11 communities along the highway with maintenance and to defray costs associated with special events on the avenue.

As well as the custom signage, WA3 has received FHWA grant funding to erect a series of lighted &quot;tributes&quot;: solar-powered, lighted pillars that contain artwork related to the roadway. The $150,000 glass and concrete sculptures are being placed in the median along Woodward Avenue to serve as landmarks along the route of the roadway and to brand it for tourists. A total of 10 to 12 installations are planned for the length of the highway in Wayne and Oakland counties. The art project received a 2011 National Scenic Byway Award for the Byways interpretation category.

===Religion, entertainment, and cars===

The area around Woodward was once nicknamed &quot;Piety Hill&quot;. There are 22 churches on the NRHP along the street in Detroit and Highland Park. According to &quot;The Detroit News&quot;, the sounds of church bells and horse hooves were some of the most distinctive sounds on Sundays along Woodward Avenue in the early 20th century. The street was home to jazz clubs starting in the 1910s and 1920s, starting a period of transition. During the 1940s, ministers lobbied for a law to prevent the issuance of additional liquor licenses in their neighborhood; the law was later overturned in 1950. Nightclubs along Woodward hosted a burgeoning music scene in the early days of rock &#x27;n roll, and the area also had plenty of bars and burlesque shows as late as the 1970s. One local journalist called the mix of churches, clubs, and bars along Woodward Avenue &quot;a precarious balance between the sacred and the profane&quot;.

As well as music clubs, many of Detroit&#x27;s other major entertainment venues are located on or near Woodward in downtown Detroit, including the Fox Theatre, Majestic Theater, and the rest of the theater district, the second-largest in the country. During World War II, the area was likewise home to 24-hour movie theaters and bowling alleys. Curfews across the river in Windsor, Ontario, meant that many patrons during the war years were Canadian. They frequented the establishments along with the Americans, many of whom worked in the factories of the Detroit area. The theater district has undergone a renaissance after renovations and improvements during the 1980s and 1990s, leading to a resurgence in the performing arts in the city. In 2002, the Fox Theatre outsold the larger Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan, earning the &quot;No. 1 theater in North America&quot; title from &quot;Pollstar&quot;, an industry trade journal, and the district is considered the second largest in the country.
An adjacent sports and entertainment district has been created near Woodward Avenue in the 21st century. &quot;District Detroit&quot; as it is called includes Comerica Park (2000), Ford Field (2002) and Little Caesars Arena (2017), which are the home venues for all four of Detroit&#x27;s professional sports teams. The district is the most compact collection in any American city, according to Patrick Rishe, the director of the Sports Business Program at Washington University in St. Louis.

Woodward Avenue&#x27;s connection to Detroit&#x27;s automobile culture dates to the early 20th century. Around 100 automobile companies were founded along the roadway. Henry Ford developed and first produced the Model T in 1907–08 at his Piquette Avenue Plant to the east of Woodward Avenue. The first 12,000 Model Ts were built there, before Ford moved production of his cars to the Highland Park plant adjacent to Woodward Avenue in 1910. Employees at the plant used the streetcar system along Woodward to get to work; these lines also provided transportation options to assembly plant workers affected by gas rationing during World War II. During the 1950s and 1960s, automobile engineers street tested their cars along Woodward Avenue between 8 Mile and Square Lake roads; the roadway was the only such location where this activity was practiced.

===Woodward Dream Cruise===
Young carriage drivers raced one another along Woodward Avenue after the roadway was converted from logs to planks in 1848. They placed bets on each other&#x27;s carriages while racing from tavern to tavern. By 1958, the roadway was used for unofficial street racing with cars. The wide width, median and sections lacking a large commercial presence attracted a reputation for the competition. The numerous drive-ins, each with its dedicated local teenaged clientele, were also popular. Woodward had numerous car dealerships and automobile accessory shops in the age of the muscle car which completed the formula for young adults to &quot;cruise&quot;, race and hang out along the road.

The Woodward Dream Cruise takes place on Woodward Avenue between Pontiac and Ferndale during August of each year, evoking nostalgia of the 1950s and 1960s, when it was common for young drivers to cruise with their cars on Woodward Avenue. The event attracts huge crowds of classic car owners and admirers from around the world to the Metro Detroit area in celebration of Detroit&#x27;s automotive history; an estimated one million spectators attended the 2009 event. The cruise was founded in 1995 as a fundraiser for a soccer field in Ferndale. Neighboring cities joined in, and by 1997, auto manufacturers and other vendors had begun sponsoring the event.

==History==

===Indian trails and plank roads===

In 1701, the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes, rivers and Indian trails. One of these, the Saginaw Trail, followed what is now Woodward Avenue from the Detroit area north to Saginaw, where it connected with the Mackinaw Trail north to the Straits of Mackinac. The Town of Detroit created rights-of-way for the principal streets of the city in 1805. This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit, with a mandate from the territorial governor to improve on the previous plan. Two of these principal streets were established by the territorial government on September 18, 1805, as &quot;permanent public roads, avenues or highways&quot;, one of which was to run along the modern routing of Woodward Avenue. The wide avenues, in emulation of the street plan for Washington, DC, were intended to make Detroit look like the &quot;Paris of the West&quot;.

Augustus Woodward was a judge in the Michigan Territory appointed by his friend, President Thomas Jefferson. He was also a colonel in the territorial militia and a president of one of Detroit&#x27;s first banks. Woodward named the street for himself, responding whimsically to the resulting criticism: &quot;Not so. The avenue is named Woodward because it runs wood-ward, toward the woods.&quot; Other proposals for names included Court House Street or Market Street. For a time, one section was named Congress Street, Witherell Street, Saginaw Road or Saginaw Turnpike, with another section dubbed Pontiac Road. Unlike these other monikers, the avenue retained the judge&#x27;s name.

Detroit was incorporated in 1815, and the initial roadway to connect Detroit north to Pontiac along the Saginaw Trail was started in 1817; this was a corduroy road built by laying down logs and filling in the gaps with clay or sand. The territorial legislature authorized a survey of the roadway to Pontiac on December 7, 1818, and the route was approved by Governor Lewis Cass on December 15, 1819, the first to be done in the future state. The Michigan Legislature authorized the construction of a private plank road with tolls to connect Detroit with Pontiac in 1848. By the next year, and oak planks were laid along the road between the two communities. Tolls were for vehicles and for a herd of cattle. Tolls along some segments of Woodward Avenue remained in place as late as 1908.
The first automobile in Detroit was driven by Charles Brady King along Woodward Avenue on March 3, 1896, a few weeks before Henry Ford drove his first car in the city. In 1909, the first mile (1.6 km) of concrete roadway in the country was paved between 6 and 7 Mile roads at a cost of $14,000 (equivalent to $ in ).

===State Trunkline era===
On May 13, 1913, the Legislature created the state&#x27;s highway system; Woodward Avenue was included as part of &quot;Division 2&quot;. The full length was paved in 1916. The first crow&#x27;s nest traffic tower in the US was installed at the intersection of Woodward and Michigan avenues on October 9, 1917; the tower elevated a police officer above the center of the intersection to direct traffic before the structure was replaced in October 1920 with the world&#x27;s first four-way traffic light. The state signposted its highways in 1919, and Woodward Avenue was assigned the M-10 designation. The same year, two auto trail designations were applied to the avenue. The Theodore Roosevelt International Highway was created in February 1919, running from Detroit northward along Woodward Avenue. Later that year, the Dixie Highway was extended through Detroit to the Straits of Mackinac, following the route of the old Saginaw Trail northward along Woodward Avenue.

Since 1924, Woodward Avenue has hosted America&#x27;s Thanksgiving Parade, the second oldest Thanksgiving Day parade in the United States. In 1925, the intersection between Woodward Avenue and State Street was busier than Times Square. On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO); the M-10 designation along Woodward was replaced with US 10, a moniker that ran from Detroit to Seattle, Washington.

Legal disputes over a plan to widen Woodward Avenue dating back to 1874 were resolved in 1932. Permission was needed from a majority of the landowners along Woodward Avenue to finalize the deal. John W. Chandler, general manager of the Woodward Avenue Improvement Association, pledged not to shave his face until he had the necessary permissions in hand. This resolution allowed Woodward to be widened from . Several buildings were removed to clear the wider street path, and St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church was moved to avoid demolition. Work started in 1933 and cost $7.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) to complete.

A bypass of downtown Birmingham opened in 1939, drawing through traffic away from the busy Woodward Avenue–Maple Road intersection. The bypass was originally named Hunter Boulevard. On September 6, 1997, Birmingham renamed the bypass to Woodward Avenue, with the previous alignment of Woodward signed as Old Woodward Avenue.

In October 1969, AASHO approved a realignment of US 10 in the Detroit area; the next year the designation was rerouted to follow the Lodge Freeway (what is now M-10) and the portion of Jefferson Avenue between the Lodge Freeway and Randolph Street (then US 25, now M-3). The M-1 designation was applied to the section of Woodward Avenue from Jefferson Avenue in downtown Detroit to Square Lake Road along the southern border of Pontiac. Woodward north of Square Lake Road was designated as a business route of both US 10 and I-75. When US 10 was truncated to Bay City in 1986, the Bus. US 10 portion of Woodward became Bus. US 24.

In the early 1980s, M-1 was truncated in downtown Detroit, as the Woodward Mall was designated in the area around Cadillac Square. At the end of 2000, MDOT proposed several highway transfers in Detroit. Some of these involved transferring city streets in the Campus Martius Park area under the department&#x27;s jurisdiction to city control; another part of the proposal involved MDOT assuming control over a section of Woodward Avenue from Adams Avenue south to Grand River Avenue. These transfers were completed the following year. In 2004, the southern terminus was moved north three blocks to Adams Avenue. A massive address renumbering project ensued along Woodward Avenue in 1997, creating a consistent numbering system from downtown Detroit to Pontiac. Previously, each city along the route had its own address system. In June 2017, the southernmost block of Woodward Avenue south of Larned Street closed to automobiles to create a temporary pedestrian plaza. This closure was made permanent the following November.

===Streetcars and other public transportation===
On August 27, 1863, the Detroit City Railway Company (DCRC) established streetcar service along Woodward from Jefferson to Adams avenues. The company was formed by investors from Syracuse, New York, earlier that year. Later, on September 18, 1886, a separate electrified line, the Highland Park Railway, was added that ran along Woodward Avenue through Highland Park. In mid-December 1893, the main streetcar line was electrified by the DCRC. In 1901, the various lines throughout the city were consolidated as the Detroit United Railway.

Detroit took control of the Detroit Unified Railway on May 15, 1922; afterwards, the streetcar system became the city&#x27;s Department of Street Railways. Following the change in control, the city also formed the Detroit Rapid Transit Commission to build a subway system. Early proposals included a station under Woodward Avenue next to Detroit City Hall. In 1926, a four-line system encompassing of lines was proposed at a cost of $280 million (equivalent to $ in ). By 1929, plans were scaled back further in the face of tough local economic conditions; the plan submitted to voters included one line of that interconnected with the city&#x27;s streetcar system by way of two streetcar tunnels. The bond proposal failed by a 2.5:1 margin that year, killing any proposal for a city subway system in Detroit.

The streetcar system, like those in other cities across the US, fell into decline after World War II. Unlike the streetcar conspiracy alleged in other cities, the decline of Detroit&#x27;s publicly owned system was related to a multitude of different factors. Increased spending on roads benefitted competing bus lines, and zoning changes coupled with freeway construction shifted the city&#x27;s population to areas away from the older streetcar lines. During the early 1950s, several lines were converted to buses after labor strikes, and other lines were eliminated. On April 8, 1956, a parade was held when the last streetcars stopped running along Woodward Avenue and in Detroit; the remaining cars were sent to Mexico City.
In the first decade of the 21st century, local business and government officials proposed two projects to add modern streetcars to M-1, an approximately line from the transit center at Michigan Avenue north to the state fairgrounds, or a line in the downtown area only. Suggestions to unify the two plans were made in late 2008, and the Detroit City Council approved the sale of $125 million in bonds on April 11, 2011, for the longer system. Through various approvals in 2011, and subsequent changes including a bus rapid transit system with a dedicated Woodward Avenue bus lane, private investors who supported the shorter three-mile line to New Center continued developing that project.

On July 28, 2014, construction started for a streetcar line to stretch from downtown Detroit to Grand Boulevard in New Center. The line was to have 20 different stations serving 12 stops, with most of the stations curbside on either side of Woodward Avenue going uptown or downtown. The line will have center road stations at the north and south ends of the system. Named QLine in 2016, the system opened in May 2017. The last car of Detroit&#x27;s previous streetcar system was numbered 286, so the planners numbered the cars for the new line 287–292 to pick up where the old number series had left off.

<text>In cryptography, blinding is a technique by which an agent can provide a service to (i.e., compute a function for) a client in an encoded form without knowing either the real input or the real output. Blinding techniques also have applications to preventing side-channel attacks on encryption devices.

More precisely, Alice has an input &quot;x&quot; and Oscar has a function &quot;f&quot;. Alice would like Oscar to compute for her without revealing either &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot; to him. The reason for her wanting this might be that she doesn&#x27;t know the function &quot;f&quot; or that she does not have the resources to compute it.
Alice &quot;blinds&quot; the message by encoding it into some other input &quot;E&quot;(&quot;x&quot;); the encoding &quot;E&quot; must be a bijection on the input space of &quot;f&quot;, ideally a random permutation. Oscar gives her &quot;f&quot;(&quot;E&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)), to which she applies a decoding &quot;D&quot; to obtain .

Not all functions allow for blind computation. At other times, blinding must be applied with care. An example of the latter is Rabin–Williams signatures. If blinding is applied to the formatted message but the random value does not honor Jacobi requirements on &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, then it could lead to private key recovery. A demonstration of the recovery can be seen in discovered by Evgeny Sidorov.

A common application of blinding is in blind signatures. In a blind signature protocol, the signer digitally signs a message without being able to learn its content.

The one-time pad (OTP) is an application of blinding to the secure communication problem, by its very nature. Alice would like to send a message to Bob secretly, however all of their communication can be read by Oscar. Therefore, Alice sends the message after blinding it with a secret key or OTP that she shares with Bob. Bob reverses the blinding after receiving the message. In this example, the function 
&quot;f&quot; is the identity and &quot;E&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are both typically the XOR operation.

Blinding can also be used to prevent certain side-channel attacks on asymmetric encryption schemes. Side-channel attacks allow an adversary to recover information about the input to a cryptographic operation, by measuring something other than the algorithm&#x27;s result, e.g., power consumption, computation time, or radio-frequency emanations by a device. Typically these attacks depend on the attacker knowing the characteristics of the algorithm, as well as (some) inputs. In this setting, blinding serves to alter the algorithm&#x27;s input into some unpredictable state. Depending on the characteristics of the blinding function, this can prevent some or all leakage of useful information. Note that security depends also on the resistance of the blinding functions themselves to side-channel attacks.

For example, in RSA blinding involves computing the blinding operation , where &quot;r&quot; is a random integer between 1 and &quot;N&quot; and relatively prime to &quot;N&quot; (i.e. , &quot;x&quot; is the plaintext, &quot;e&quot; is the public RSA exponent and &quot;N&quot; is the RSA modulus. As usual, the decryption function is applied thus giving . Finally it is unblinded using the function . Multiplying by yields , as desired. When decrypting in this manner, an adversary who is able to measure time taken by this operation would not be able to make use of this information (by applying timing attacks RSA is known to be vulnerable to) as she does not know the constant &quot;r&quot; and hence has no knowledge of the real input fed to the RSA primitives.

<text>A backhoe loader, also called a loader backhoe, loader excavator, tractor excavator, digger or colloquially shortened to backhoe within the industry, is a heavy equipment vehicle that consists of a tractor-like unit fitted with a loader-style shovel/bucket on the front and a backhoe on the back. Due to its (relatively) small size and versatility, backhoe loaders are very common in urban engineering and small construction projects (such as building a small house, fixing urban roads, etc.) as well as developing countries. This type of machine is similar to and derived from what is now known as a TLB (Tractor-Loader-Backhoe), which is to say, an agricultural tractor fitted with a front loader and rear backhoe attachment.

The true development of the backhoe actually began in 1947 by the inventors that started the Wain-Roy Corporation of Hubbardston, Massachusetts. In 1947 Wain-Roy Corporation developed and tested the first actual backhoes. In April 1948 Wain-Roy Corporation sold the first all-hydraulic backhoes, mounted to a Ford Model 8N tractor, to the Connecticut Light and Power Company for $705.

==History==

Evolving in parallel to development in the U.S., backhoes were first produced in the UK in 1953 by JCB, but it was just a prototype. The world&#x27;s first backhoe loader with factory warranty was introduced in the U.S. by J.I. Case in 1957. Their Model 320 was the world&#x27;s first serial backhoe loader. Although based on a tractor, a backhoe loader was and is almost never called a &quot;tractor&quot; when both the loader and the backhoe are permanently attached. Backhoe loaders are also not generally used for towing and usually do not have a power take-off (PTO) as often this is used to drive the hydraulic pump operating the attachments. When the backhoe is permanently attached, the machine usually has a seat that can swivel to the rear to face the hoe controls. Removable backhoe attachments almost always have a separate seat on the attachment itself.
In Britain and Ireland they are commonly referred to simply as JCBs; they are popularly called &quot;JCB&quot; in India. In the United States, they are often referred to as &quot;backhoes&quot;, although the term &#x27;backhoe&#x27; only refers to one component.

In 1970, Hy-Dynamic, now a division of Bucyrus-Erie, manufacturer of the Dynahoe, was the first company to incorporate a four-wheel drive system into their backhoe loaders, allowing these models to go over almost any terrain with little difficulty. Since the backhoe was invented, several companies such as Caterpillar and John Deere have changed the backhoe&#x27;s back arm to be slightly curved like that of an excavator, which can allow more maneuverability.

==Use==
Backhoe loaders are very common and can be used for a wide variety of tasks: construction, small demolitions, light transportation of building materials, powering building equipment, digging holes/excavation, landscaping, breaking asphalt, and paving roads. Often, the backhoe bucket can also be replaced with powered attachments such as a breaker, grapple, auger, or a stump grinder. Enhanced articulation of attachments can be achieved with intermediate attachments such as the tiltrotator. Many backhoes feature quick coupler (quick-attach) mounting systems and auxiliary hydraulic circuits for simplified attachment mounting, increasing the machine&#x27;s utilization on the job site. Some loader buckets have a retractable bottom or &quot;clamshell&quot;, enabling it to empty its load more quickly and efficiently. Retractable-bottom loader buckets are also often used for grading and scraping. The front assembly may be a removable attachment or permanently mounted.

Because digging while on tires intrinsically causes the machine to rock, and the swinging weight of the backhoe could cause the vehicle to tip, most backhoe loaders use hydraulic outriggers or stabilizers at the rear when digging and lower the loader bucket for additional stability. This means that the bucket must be raised and the outriggers retracted when the vehicle needs to change positions, reducing efficiency. For this reason many companies offer miniature tracked excavators, which sacrifice the loader function and ability to be driven from site to site, for increased digging efficiency.

Their relatively small frame and precise control make backhoe-loaders very useful and common in urban engineering projects such as construction and repairs in areas too small for larger equipment. Their versatility and compact size makes them one of the most popular urban construction vehicles. For larger projects, a tracked excavator is generally used.

In recent years, small compact tractors have become very popular with private homeowners. Subcompact tractors, the size between a compact tractor and lawn tractor, are also often sold in backhoe loader setup, sometimes with a belly-mounted mower also included. These tractors offer private homeowners the ability to perform minor excavation projects.

<doc id="490071" wikidata="Q311436" url="?curid=490071" title="Juan Manuel de Rosas">
<text>Juan Manuel José Domingo Ortiz de Rozas y López de Osornio (30 March 1793 – 14 March 1877), nicknamed &quot;Restorer of the Laws&quot;, was an Argentine politician and army officer who ruled Buenos Aires Province and briefly the Argentine Confederation. Born into a wealthy family, Rosas independently amassed a personal fortune, acquiring large tracts of land in the process. Rosas enlisted his workers in a private militia, as was common for rural proprietors, and took part in the disputes that led to numerous civil wars in his country. Victorious in warfare, personally influential, and with vast landholdings and a loyal private army, Rosas became a caudillo, as provincial warlords in the region were known. He eventually reached the rank of brigadier general, the highest in the Argentine Army, and became the undisputed leader of the Federalist Party.

In December 1829, Rosas became governor of the province of Buenos Aires and established a dictatorship backed by state terrorism. In 1831, he signed the Federal Pact, recognising provincial autonomy and creating the Argentine Confederation. When his term of office ended in 1832, Rosas departed to the frontier to wage war on the indigenous peoples. After his supporters launched a coup in Buenos Aires, Rosas was asked to return and once again took office as governor. Rosas reestablished his dictatorship and formed the repressive &quot;, an armed parapolice that killed thousands of citizens. Elections became a farce, and the legislature and judiciary became docile instruments of his will. Rosas created a cult of personality and his regime became totalitarian in nature, with all aspects of society rigidly controlled.

Rosas faced many threats to his power during the late 1830s and early 1840s. He fought a war against the Peru–Bolivian Confederation, endured a blockade by France, faced a revolt in his own province and battled a major rebellion that lasted for years and spread to five northern Argentine provinces. Rosas persevered and extended his influence in the provinces, exercising effective control over them through direct and indirect means. By 1848, he had extended his power beyond the borders of Buenos Aires and was ruler of all of Argentina. Rosas also attempted to annex the neighbouring nations of Uruguay and Paraguay. France and Great Britain jointly retaliated against Argentine expansionism, blockading Buenos Aires for most of the late 1840s, but were unable to halt Rosas, whose prestige was greatly enhanced by his string of successes.

When the Empire of Brazil began aiding Uruguay in its struggle against Argentina, Rosas declared war in August 1851, starting the Platine War. This short conflict ended with Rosas being defeated and absconding to Britain. His last years were spent in exile living as a tenant farmer until his death in 1877. Rosas garnered an enduring public perception among Argentines as a brutal tyrant. Since the 1930s, an authoritarian, anti-Semitic, and racist political movement in Argentina called Revisionism tried to improve Rosas&#x27; reputation and establish a new dictatorship in the model of his regime. In 1989, his remains were repatriated by the government in an attempt to promote national unity, seeking to rehabilitate Rosas and pardon military personnel convicted of human rights abuses. Rosas remains a controversial figure in Argentina in the 21st century; he was represented on the 20 Argentine peso bill until 2017.

==Early life==

===Birth===

Juan Manuel José Domingo Ortiz de Rozas was born on 30 March 1793 at his family&#x27;s town house in Buenos Aires, the capital of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. He was the first child of León Ortiz de Rozas and Agustina López de Osornio. León Ortiz was the son of an immigrant from the Spanish Province of Burgos. A military officer with an undistinguished career, León Ortiz had married into a wealthy &quot; family. The young Juan Manuel de Rosas&#x27; character was heavily influenced by his mother Agustina, a strong-willed and domineering woman who derived these character traits from her father Clemente López de Osornio, a landowner who died defending his estate from an Indian attack in 1783.

As was common practice at the time, Rosas was schooled at home until the age of eight, and then enrolled in what was regarded the best private school in Buenos Aires. Though befitting the son of a wealthy landowner, his education was unremarkable. According to historian John Lynch, Rosas&#x27; education &quot;was supplemented by his own efforts in the years that followed. Rosas was not entirely unread, though the time, the place, and his own bias limited the choice of authors. He appears to have had a sympathetic, if superficial, acquaintance with minor political thinkers of French absolutism&quot;.

In 1806, a British expeditionary force invaded Buenos Aires. A 13-year-old Rosas served in distributing ammunition to troops in a force organised by Viceroy Santiago Liniers to counter the invasion. The British were defeated in August 1806, but returned a year later. Rosas was then assigned to the &quot;&quot; (a militia cavalry), although he was probably barred from active duty during this time due to illness.

===&quot;Estanciero&quot;===

After the British invasions had been repelled, Rosas and his family moved from Buenos Aires to their &quot;&quot; (ranch). His work there further shaped his character and outlook as part of the Platine region&#x27;s social establishment. In the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, owners of large landholdings (including the Rosas family) provided food, equipment and protection for families living in areas under their control. Their private defence forces consisted primarily of labourers who were drafted as soldiers. Most of these peons, as such workers were called, were gauchos.

The landed aristocracy of Spanish descent considered the illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised the majority of the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other labour force available, but were treated with contempt by the landowners. Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh, authoritarian temperament. He was known to dress like them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them to forget that he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.

Rosas acquired a working knowledge of administering ranch lands and, beginning in 1811, took charge of his family&#x27;s &quot;estancias&quot;. In 1813, he married Encarnación Ezcurra, daughter of a wealthy family from Buenos Aires. Soon afterwards, he sought to establish a career for himself, leaving his parents&#x27; estate. He produced salted meat and acquired landholdings in the process. As the years passed he became an &quot;estanciero&quot; (rancher) in his own right, accumulating land while establishing a successful partnership with second cousins from the politically powerful Anchorena clan. His hard work and organisational skills in deploying labour were key to his success, rather than creating new or applying nontraditional approaches to production.

==Rise to power==

===Caudillo===
The May Revolution of 1810 marked the early stage of a process which later led to the disintegration of Spain&#x27;s Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, independence and the eventual formation of Argentina. Rosas, like many landowners in the countryside, was suspicious of a movement advanced primarily by merchants and bureaucrats in the city of Buenos Aires. Rosas was specially outraged by the execution of Viceroy Santiago de Liniers at the hands of the revolutionaries. Rosas felt nostalgic about colonial times, seeing them as stable, orderly and prosperous.

When the Congress of Tucumán severed all remaining ties with Spain in July 1816, Rosas and his peers accepted independence as an accomplished fact. Independence resulted in a breakup of the territories that had formed the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. The province of Buenos Aires fought a civil war with the other provinces over the degree of autonomy which the provincial governments were supposed to have. The Unitarian Party supported the preeminence of Buenos Aires, while the Federalist Party defended provincial autonomy. A decade of strife over the issue destroyed the ties between capital and provinces, with new republics being declared throughout the country. Efforts by the Buenos Aires government to quash these independent states were met with determined local resistance. In 1820 Rosas and his gauchos, all dressed in red and nicknamed &quot;&quot; (&quot;Reds of the Mount&quot;), enlisted in the army of Buenos Aires as the Fifth Regiment of Militia. They repulsed invading provincial armies, saving Buenos Aires.

At the end of the conflict, Rosas returned to his &quot;estancias&quot; having acquired prestige for his military service. He was promoted to cavalry colonel and was awarded further landholdings by the government. These additions, together with his successful business and fresh property acquisitions, greatly boosted his wealth. By 1830, he was the 10th largest landowner in the province of Buenos Aires (in which the city of the same name was located), owning 300,000 cattle and of land. With his newly gained influence, military background, vast landholdings and a private army of gauchos loyal only to him, Rosas became the quintessential caudillo, as provincial warlords in the region were known. Rosas governance had a large impact on the Argentinian landscape, stiffening federal beliefs against the utilitarian resistance. He promoted self-determination while promoting his authority within Buenos Aires, directing conflicts with Utilitarian views that favored a centralized government. The issues between the Utilitarians and the Federalists constructed the course of Argentinian politics and contributed≈ to the future of the nation. 

===Governor of Buenos Aires===

National unity crumbled under the weight of a continuous round of civil wars, rebellions and coups. The Unitarian–Federalist struggle brought perennial instability while caudillos fought for power and laid waste to the countryside. By 1826, Rosas had built a power base, consisting of relatives, friends and clients, and joined the Federalist Party. He remained a strong advocate of his native province of Buenos Aires, with little concern for political ideology. In 1820, Rosas fought alongside the Unitarians because he saw the Federalist invasion as a menace to Buenos Aires. When the Unitarians sought to appease the Federalists by proposing to grant the other provinces a share in the customs revenues flowing through Buenos Aires, Rosas saw this as a threat to his province&#x27;s interests. In 1827, four provinces led by Federalist caudillos rebelled against the Unitarian government. Rosas was the driving force behind the Federalist takeover of Buenos Aires and the election of Manuel Dorrego as provincial governor that year. Rosas was awarded with the post of general commander of the rural militias of the province of Buenos Aires on 14 July, which increased his influence and power.

In December 1828 Juan Lavalle, the Unitarian governor of Buenos Aires had Dorrego seized and executed without trial. With Dorrego gone, Rosas filled the vacant Federalist leadership and rebelled against the Unitarians. He allied with Estanislao López, caudillo and ruler of Santa Fe Province, and they defeated Lavalle at the Battle of Márquez Bridge in April 1829. When Rosas entered the city of Buenos Aires in November of that year, he was hailed both as a victorious military leader and as the head of the Federalists. Rosas was considered a handsome man, standing tall with blond hair and &quot;piercing blue eyes&quot;. Charles Darwin, who met Rosas during the &quot;Beagle&quot; survey expedition, assessed him as &quot;a man of extraordinary character&quot;. British diplomat Henry Southern said that in &quot;appearance Rosas resembles an English gentleman farmer—his manners are courteous without being refined. He is affable and agreeable in conversation, which however nearly always turns on himself, but his tone is pleasant and agreeable enough. His memory is stupendous: and his accuracy in all points of detail never failing&quot;.

On 6 December 1829, the House of Representatives of Buenos Aires elected Rosas governor and granted him &quot;&quot; (extraordinary faculties). This marked the beginning of his regime, described by historians as a dictatorship. He saw himself as a benevolent dictator, saying: &quot;For me the ideal of good government would be paternal autocracy, intelligent, disinterested and indefatigable ... I have always admired the autocratic dictators who have been the first servants of their people. That is my great title: I have always sought to serve the country&quot;. He used his power to censor his critics and banish his enemies. He later justified these measures, stating: &quot;When I took over the government I found the government in anarchy, divided into warring factions, reduced to pure chaos, a hell in miniature ...&quot;

===Desert Campaign===
Rosas&#x27; early administration was preoccupied with the severe deficits, large public debts and the impact of currency devaluation which his government inherited. A great drought that began in December 1828, which would last until April 1832, greatly impacted the economy. The Unitarians were still at large, controlling several provinces that had banded together in the Unitarian League. The capture of José María Paz, the main Unitarian leader, in March 1831 resulted in the end of the Unitarian–Federalist civil war and the collapse of the Unitarian League. Rosas was content, for the moment, to agree to recognise provincial autonomy in the Federal Pact. In an effort to alleviate the government&#x27;s financial problems, he improved revenue collection while not raising taxes and curtailed expenditure.

By the end of his first term, Rosas was generally credited with having staved off political and financial instability, but he faced increased opposition in the House of Representatives. All members of the House were Federalists, as Rosas had restored the legislature that had been in place under Dorrego, and which had subsequently been dissolved by Lavalle. A liberal Federalist faction, which accepted dictatorship as a temporary necessity, called for the adoption of a constitution. Rosas was unwilling to govern constrained by a constitutional framework and only grudgingly relinquished his dictatorial powers. His term of office ended soon after, on 5 December 1832.

While the government in Buenos Aires was distracted with political infighting, ranchers began moving into territories in the south inhabited by indigenous peoples. The resulting conflict with native peoples necessitated a government response. Rosas steadfastly endorsed policies which supported this expansion. During his governorship he granted lands in the south to war veterans and to ranchers seeking alternative pasture lands during the drought. Although the south was regarded as a virtual desert at the time, it had great potential and resources for agricultural development, particularly for ranching operations. The government gave Rosas command of an army with orders to subdue the Indian tribes in the coveted territory. Rosas was generous to those Indians who surrendered, rewarding them with animals and goods. Although he personally disliked killing Indians, he relentlessly hunted those who refused to yield. The Desert Campaign lasted from 1833 to 1834, with Rosas subjugating the entire region. His conquest of the south opened many possibilities for further territorial expansion, which led him to state: &quot;The fine territories, which extend from the Andes to the coast and down to the Magellan Straits are now wide open for our children&quot;.
==Second governorship==

===Absolute power===

While Rosas was away on the Desert Campaign in October 1833, a group of &#x27; (Rosas&#x27; supporters) laid siege to Buenos Aires. Inside the city, Rosas&#x27; wife, Encarnación, assembled a contingent of associates to aid the besiegers. The Revolution of the Restorers, as the &#x27; coup came to be known, forced the provincial governor Juan Ramón Balcarce to resign. In quick succession, Balcarce was followed by two others who presided over weak and ineffective governments. The &#x27; (Rosism) had become a powerful faction within the Federalist Party, and pressured other factions to accept a return of Rosas, endowed with dictatorial powers, as the only way to restore stability. The House of Representatives yielded, and on 7 March 1835, Rosas was reelected governor and invested with the &#x27; (sum of public power).

A plebiscite was held to determine whether the citizens of Buenos Aires supported Rosas&#x27; reelection and resumption of dictatorial powers. During his governorship from 1829 to 1832, Rosas had reduced the election process to a farce. He had installed loyal associates as justices of the peace, powerful officeholders with administrative and judicial functions who were also charged with tax collection, leading militia and presiding over elections. Through the exclusion of voters and intimidation of the opposition, the justices of the peace delivered any result Rosas favored. Half of the members of the House of Representatives faced reelection each year, and the opposition to Rosas had quickly been eliminated through rigged elections, allowing him to control the legislature. Control over finances had been stripped from the legislature, and its approval of legislation turned into a rubber stamp to preserve a semblance of democracy. The result of the 1835 election was a predictable 99.9 per cent &quot;yes&quot; vote.

Rosas believed that the manipulation of elections were necessary for political stability, because most of the country&#x27;s population was illiterate. He acquired absolute power over the province with the assent and support of most &#x27; and businessmen, who shared his views. The &#x27; formed the power base on which Rosas relied. Lynch said that there &quot;was a great deal of group cohesion and solidarity among the landed class. Rosas was the center of a vast kinship group based on land. He was surrounded by a closely knit economic and political network linking deputies, law officers, officials, and military who were also landowners and related among themselves or with Rosas&quot;.

===Totalitarian regime===

Rosas&#x27; authority and influence spread far beyond the House of Representatives. He exercised tight control over the bureaucracy as well as his cabinet, stating: &quot;Do not imagine that my Ministers are anything but my Secretaries. I put them in their offices to listen and report, and nothing more&quot;. His supporters were rewarded with positions within the state apparatus, and anyone he deemed a threat was purged. Opposition newspapers were burned in public squares. Rosas created an elaborate cult of personality, presenting himself as an almighty and fatherlike figure who protected the people. His portraits were carried in street demonstrations and placed on church altars to be venerated. &quot;Rosismo&quot; was no longer a mere faction within the Federalist ranks; it had become a political movement. As early as 1829, Rosas had confided to an Uruguayan diplomatic envoy: &quot;I tell you I am not a Federalist, and I have never belonged to that party&quot;. During his governorship, he still claimed to have favoured Federalism against Unitarianism, although in practice Federalism had by that time been subsumed into the &quot;Rosismo&quot; movement.

Rosas established a totalitarian regime, in which the government sought to dictate every aspect of public and private life. It was mandated that the slogan &quot;Death to the Savage Unitarians&quot; be inscribed at the head of all official documents. Anyone on the state payroll—from military officers, priests, to civil servants and teachers—was obliged to wear a red badge with the inscription &quot;Federation or Death&quot;. Every male was required to have a &quot;federal look&quot;, i.e., to sport a large moustache and sideburns, leading many to wear false moustaches. The red colour—symbol of both the Federalist Party and of &#x27;—became omnipresent in the province of Buenos Aires. Soldiers wore red &#x27; (blankets worn as trousers), caps and jackets, and their horses sported red accoutrements. Civilians were also required to wear the colour. A red waistcoat, red badge and red hat band were required for men, while women wore ribbons in that colour and children donned school uniforms based upon &quot;&quot; paradigms. Building exteriors and interiors were also decorated in red.

Most Catholic clergy in Buenos Aires willingly backed Rosas&#x27; regime. The Jesuits, the only ones who refused to do so, were expelled from the country. The lower social strata in Buenos Aires, which formed the vast majority of its populace, experienced no improvement in the conditions under which they lived. When Rosas slashed expenditures, he cut resources from education, social services, general welfare and public works. None of the lands confiscated from Indians and Unitarians were turned over to rural workers, including gauchos. Black people did not experience any improvement in their conditions either. Rosas was a slave-owner, and helped revive the slave trade. Despite doing little to promote their interests, he remained popular among blacks and gauchos. He employed blacks, patronised their festivities and attended their &quot;candombles&quot;. The gauchos admired his leadership and willingness to fraternise with them to some extent.

===State terrorism===

In addition to purges, banishments and censorship, Rosas took measures against the opposition and anyone else he deemed a threat that historians have considered state terrorism. Terror was a tool used to intimidate dissident voices, to shore up support among his own partisans and to exterminate his foes. His targets were denounced, sometimes inaccurately, as having ties to Unitarians. Those victimised included members of his government and party who were suspected of being insufficiently loyal. If actual opponents were not at hand, the regime found other targets that were punished to make an example. A climate of fear was used to create unquestioning conformity to Rosas&#x27; dictates.

State terrorism was carried out by the &#x27;, an armed parapolice unit of the &#x27; security agency. The &#x27; and the &#x27; were creations of Rosas, who retained tight control over both. The tactics of the &quot;mazorqueros&quot; included neighborhood sweeps in which houses would be searched and occupants intimidated. Others who fell into their power were arrested, tortured and killed. Killings were generally by shooting, lance-thrusting or throat-slitting. Many were castrated, or had their beards scalped or their tongues cut out. Modern estimates report around 2,000 people were killed from 1829 until 1852.

Although a judicial system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He would sit in judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror as a tool of intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were antithetical to a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness as tools of intimidation.

==Struggle for dominance==

===Rebellions and foreign threat===

Throughout the late 1830s and early 1840s, Rosas faced a series of major threats to his power. The Unitarians found an ally in Andrés de Santa Cruz, the ruler of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. Rosas declared war against the Peru–Bolivian Confederation on 19 March 1837, joining the War of the Confederation between Chile and Peru–Bolivia. The &quot;&quot; army played a minor role in the conflict, which resulted in the overthrow of Santa Cruz and the dissolution of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. On 28 March 1838, France declared a blockade of the Port of Buenos Aires, eager to extend its influence over the region. Unable to confront the French, Rosas increased internal repression to forestall potential uprisings against his regime.

The blockade caused severe damage to the economy across all the provinces, as they exported their goods through the port of Buenos Aires. Despite the 1831 Federal Pact, all provinces had long been discontent with the &quot;de facto&quot; primacy that Buenos Aires province held over them. On 28 February 1839, the province of Corrientes revolted and attacked both Buenos Aires and Entre Ríos provinces. Rosas counterattacked and defeated the rebels, killing their leader, the governor of Corrientes. In June, Rosas uncovered a plot by dissident &quot;Rosistas&quot; to oust him from power in what became known as the Maza conspiracy. Rosas imprisoned some of the plotters and executed others. Manuel Vicente Maza, president of both the House of Representatives and the Supreme Court, was murdered by Rosas&#x27; &quot;&quot; agents within the halls of the parliament on the pretext that his son was involved in the conspiracy. In the countryside, &quot;estancieros&quot;, including a younger brother of Rosas, revolted, beginning the Rebellion of the South. The rebels attempted to ally with France, but were easily crushed, many losing their lives and properties in the process.

In September 1839, Juan Lavalle returned after ten years in exile. He allied with the governor of Corrientes, which revolted once again, and invaded Buenos Aires province at the head of Unitarian troops armed and supplied by the French. Emboldened by Lavalle&#x27;s actions, the provinces of Tucumán, Salta, La Rioja, Catamarca and Jujuy formed the Coalition of the North and also rebelled against Buenos Aires. Great Britain intervened on behalf of Rosas, and France lifted the blockade on 29 October 1840. The struggle with his internal enemies was hard-fought. By December 1842, Lavalle had been killed and the rebellious provinces subdued, except for Corrientes, which was only defeated in 1847. Terrorism was also employed on the battlefield, as the &quot;Rosistas&quot; refused to take prisoners. The defeated men had their throats cut and their heads put on display.

===Ruler of Argentina===

Around 1845, Rosas managed to establish absolute dominance over the region. His subordinates dominated all of Uruguay, with the exception of Montevideo. He offered help to the separatists of Ragamuffin War in order to seize the situation and possibly obtain control over the former Misiones Orientales territory. He exercised complete control over all aspects of society with the solid backing of the army. Rosas was raised from colonel to brigadier general (the highest army rank) on 18 December 1829. On 12 November 1840 he declined the newly created and higher rank of grand marshal (&quot;gran mariscal&quot;), which had been bestowed on him by the House of Representatives. The army was led by officers who had backgrounds and values similar to his. Confident of his power, Rosas made some concessions by returning confiscated properties to their owners, disbanding the &quot;&quot; and ending torture and political assassinations. The inhabitants of Buenos Aires still dressed and behaved according to the set of rules Rosas had imposed, but the climate of constant and widespread fear greatly diminished.

When Rosas was elected governor for the first time in 1829, he held no power outside the province of Buenos Aires. There was no national government or national parliament. The former Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata had been succeeded by the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, which by 1831, following the Federal Pact and officially from 22 May 1835, had increasingly been known as the Argentine Confederation, or simply, Argentina. Rosas&#x27; victory over the other Argentine provinces in the early 1840s turned them into satellites of Buenos Aires. He gradually put in place provincial governors who were either allied or too weak to have real independence, which allowed him to exercise dominance over all the provinces. By 1848, Rosas began calling his government the &quot;government of the confederacy&quot; and the &quot;general government&quot;, which would have been inconceivable a few years before. The next year, with acquiescence of the provinces, he named himself &quot;Supreme Head of the Confederacy&quot; and became the indisputable ruler of Argentina.

As Rosas aged and his health declined, the question of who would succeed him became a growing concern among his supporters. His wife Encarnación had died in October 1838 after a long illness. Although devastated by his loss, Rosas exploited her death to raise support for his regime. Not long after, at the age of 47, he began an affair with his fifteen-year-old maid, María Eugenia Castro, with whom he had five illegitimate children. From his marriage to Encarnación, Rosas had two children: Juan Bautista Pedro and Manuela Robustiana. Rosas established a hereditary dictatorship, naming the children from his marriage as his successors, stating that &quot;[t]hey are both worthy children of my beloved Encarnación, and if, God willing, I die, then you will find that they are capable of succeeding me&quot;. It is unknown whether Rosas was a closet monarchist. Later during his exile, Rosas declared that Princess Alice of the United Kingdom would be the ideal ruler for his country. Nonetheless, in public he stated that his regime was republican in nature.

==Apogee and downfall==

===Anglo-French blockade===
The breakup of the old Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata during the 1810s eventually resulted in the emergence of independent nations of Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay in the northern portion of the Viceroyalty, while its southern territories coalesced into the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Rosas planned to restore, if not all, at least a considerable part of the former borders of the old Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. He never recognised the independence of Paraguay and regarded it a rebel Argentine province that would inevitably be reconquered. He sent an army under Manuel Oribe who invaded Uruguay and conquered most of the country, except for its capital Montevideo that endured a long siege starting in 1843. When pressed by the British, Rosas declined to guarantee Uruguayan independence. In South America, all potential foreign threats to Rosas&#x27; plans of conquest collapsed, including Gran Colombia and the Peru–Bolivian Confederation, or were troubled by internal turmoil, as was the Empire of Brazil. To reinforce his claims over Uruguay and Paraguay, and maintain his dominance over the Argentine provinces, Rosas blockaded the port of Montevideo and closed the interior rivers to foreign trade.

The loss of trade was unacceptable to Britain and France. On 17 September 1845 both nations established the Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata and enforced the free navigation in the Río de la Plata Basin (or Platine region). Argentina resisted the pressure and fought back to a standstill. This undeclared war caused more economic harm to France and Britain than to Argentina. The British faced increasing pressure at home once they realised that the access gained to the other ports within the Platine region did not compensate for the loss of trade with Buenos Aires. Britain ended all hostilities and lifted the blockade on 15 July 1847, followed by France on 12 June 1848. Rosas had successfully resisted the two most powerful nations on Earth; his standing, and Argentina&#x27;s, increased among Hispanic American nations. The Venezuelan humanist Andrés Bello, summarizing the prevailing opinion, considered Rosas among &quot;the leading ranks of the great men of America&quot;.

Although his prestige was on the rise, Rosas made no serious attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation&#x27;s welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines to return to their homeland, but only because he was so confident of his control and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant Camila O&#x27;Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.

===Platine War===
Rosas failed to acknowledge that discontent was steadily growing throughout the country. Throughout the 1840s he became increasingly secluded in his country house in Palermo, some miles away from Buenos Aires. There he ruled and lived under heavy protection provided by guards and patrols. He declined to meet with his ministers and relied solely on secretaries. His daughter Manuela replaced his wife at his right hand and became the link between Rosas and the outside world. The reason for Rosas&#x27; increasing isolation was given by a member of his secretariat: &quot;The dictator is not stupid: he knows the people hate him; he goes in constant fear and always has one eye on the chance to rob and abuse them and the other on making a getaway. He has a horse ready saddled at the door of his office day and night&quot;.

Meanwhile, Brazil, now ascendant under Emperor Dom Pedro II, provided support to the Uruguayan government that still held out in Montevideo, as well as to the ambitious Justo José de Urquiza, a caudillo in Entre Ríos who rebelled against Rosas. Once one of Rosas&#x27; most trusted lieutenants, Urquiza now claimed to fight for a constitutional government, although his ambition to become head of state was barely disguised. In retaliation, Rosas declared war on Brazil on 18 August 1851, beginning the Platine War. The army under Oribe in Uruguay surrendered to Urquiza in October. With arms and financial aid given by Brazil, Urquiza then marched through Argentine territory heading to Buenos Aires.

Uncharacteristically, Rosas remained passive throughout the conflict, but lost heart once he came to realise that he had fallen into a trap. Even if he defeated Urquiza, his forces would probably be weakened enough to prevent him from challenging the Brazilian army that was ready to invade Argentina. With no other alternative, Rosas remarked: &quot;There is no other way; we have to play for the high stakes and go for everything. Here we are, and from here there is no retreat&quot;. After an unsuccessful battle against Urquiza on 3 February 1852, Rosas fled to Buenos Aires. Once there, he disguised himself and boarded a ship that took him to Britain to live in exile. Embittered, he remarked: &quot;It is not the people who have overthrown me. It is the monkeys, the Brazilians&quot;.

==Later years==

===Exile and death===

Rosas arrived in Plymouth in England on 26 April 1852. The British gave him asylum, paid for his travel and welcomed him with a 21-gun salute. These honours were granted because, according to the British Foreign Secretary James Harris, 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, &quot;General Rosas was no common refugee, but one who had shown great distinction and kindness to the British merchants who had traded with his country&quot;. Months before his fall, Rosas had arranged with the British chargé d&#x27;affaires Captain Robert Gore for protection and asylum in the event of his defeat. Both his children with Encarnación followed him into exile, although Juan Bautista soon returned with his family to Argentina. His daughter Manuela married the son of an old associate of Rosas, an act which the former dictator never forgave. A domineering father, Rosas wanted his daughter to remain devoted to him alone. Although he forbade her from writing or visiting, Manuela remained loyal to him and maintained contact.

The new Argentine government confiscated all of Rosas&#x27; properties and tried him as a criminal, later sentencing him to death. Rosas was appalled that most of his friends, supporters and allies abandoned him and became either silent or openly critical of him. &quot;Rosismo&quot; vanished overnight. &quot;The landed class, supporters and beneficiaries of Rosas, now had to make their peace—and their profits—with his successors. Survival, not allegiance, was their politics&quot;, argued Lynch. Urquiza, a one-time ally and later an enemy, reconciled with Rosas and sent him financial assistance, hoping for political support in return—although Rosas had scant political capital left. Rosas followed Argentina&#x27;s developments while in exile, always hoping for an opportunity to return, but he never again insinuated himself into Argentine affairs.

In exile Rosas was not destitute, but he lived modestly amid financial constraints during the remainder of his life. A very few loyal friends sent him money, but it was never enough. He sold one of his &quot;estancias&quot; before the confiscation and became a tenant farmer in Swaythling, near Southampton. He employed a housekeeper and two to four labourers, to whom he paid above-average wages. Despite constant concern over his shortage of funds, Rosas found joy in farm life, once remarking: &quot;I now consider myself happy on this farm, living in modest circumstances as you see, earning a living the hard way by the sweat of my brow&quot;. A contemporary described him in final years: &quot;He was then eighty, a man still handsome and imposing; his manners were most refined, and the modest environment did nothing to lessen his air of a great lord, inherited from his family&quot;. After a walk on a cold day, Rosas caught pneumonia and died at 07:00 on the morning of 14 March 1877. Following a private mass attended by his family and a few friends, he was buried in the town cemetery of Southampton.

==Legacy==
Serious attempts to reassess Rosas&#x27; reputation began in the 1880s with the publication of scholarly works by Adolfo Saldías and Ernesto Quesada. Later, a more blatant &quot;Revisionist&quot; movement would flourish under &#x27; (Nationalism). &#x27; was a political movement that appeared in Argentina in the 1920s and reached its apex in the 1930s. It was the Argentine equivalent of the authoritarian ideologies that arose during the same period, such as Nazism, Fascism and Integralism. Argentine Nationalism was an authoritarian, anti-Semitic, racist and misogynistic political movement with support for racially based pseudo-scientific theories such as eugenics. &#x27; (Revisionism) was the historiographical wing of Argentine &#x27;. The main goal of Argentine &#x27; was to establish a national dictatorship. For the &quot;Nacionalismo&quot; movement, Rosas and his regime were idealised and portrayed as paragons of governmental virtue. &quot;Revisionismo&quot; served as a useful tool, as the main purpose of the revisionists within the &#x27; agenda was to rehabilitate Rosas&#x27; image.

Despite a decades-long struggle, &quot;&quot; failed to be taken seriously. According to Michael Goebel, the revisionists had a &quot;lack of interest in scholarly standards&quot; and were known for &quot;their institutional marginality in the intellectual field&quot;. They also never succeeded in changing mainstream views regarding Rosas. William Spence Robertson said in 1930: &quot;Among the enigmatical personages of the &#x27;Age of Dictators&#x27; in South America none played a more spectacular role than the Argentine dictator, Juan Manuel de Rosas, whose gigantic and ominous figure bestrode the Plata River for more than twenty years. So despotic was his power that Argentine writers have themselves styled this age of their history as &#x27;The Tyranny of Rosas&#x27;.&quot; In 1961, William Dusenberry said: &quot;Rosas is a negative memory in Argentina. He left behind him the black legend of Argentine history—a legend which Argentines in general wish to forget. There is no monument to him in the entire nation; no park, plaza, or street bears his name&quot;.
In the 1980s, Argentina was a fractured, deeply divided nation, having faced military dictatorships, severe economic crises and a defeat in the Falklands War. President Carlos Menem decided to repatriate Rosas&#x27; remains and take advantage of the occasion to unite the Argentines. Menem believed that if the Argentines could forgive Rosas and his regime, they might do the same regarding the more recent and vividly remembered past. On 30 September 1989, an elaborate and enormous cortege organised by the government was held, after which the remains of the Argentine ruler were interred in his family vault at La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires. A week after the repatriation Menem felt able to pardon nearly 300 military personnel convicted of abuses in the Dirty War. Closely allied with neorevisionists, Menem (and his fellow Peronist presidential successors Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner) have honoured Rosas on banknotes, postage stamps and monuments, causing mixed reactions among the public. Rosas remains a controversial figure among Argentines, who &quot;have long been fascinated and outraged&quot; by him, as historian John Lynch noted.

<text>Cantor is a lunar impact crater that is located on the northern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. The outer rim of the crater has a distinctly hexagonal shape, and is slightly longer in the north–south direction. The interior walls are multiply d, although less so along the western rim. There is a low central peak at the midpoint of the floor.

The terrain surrounding Cantor is heavily impacted with many small craters. The old and heavily eroded crater H. G. Wells is located to the northwest. To the southeast is Kidinnu.

Prior to formal naming by the IAU in 1970, Cantor was called &quot;Crater 121&quot;.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cantor.

<doc id="490077" wikidata="Q1771526" url="?curid=490077" title="Constitution of Nauru">
<text>The [[constitution]] of the [[Republic of Nauru]] was adopted following national independence on 31 January 1968.

In 2007 there were political debates in progress with a view to amend aspects of the Constitution, owing to the challenge of widely acknowledged political instability. One notable issue being discussed was the possibility of making the office of President of Nauru directly elected by the population, instead of the office being indirectly elected by the Parliament of Nauru. Owing to frequent recourse to the votes of no confidence, changes of President have been frequent (i.e.: Bernard Dowiyogo was appointed President of Nauru a total of seven times, prior to his death in 2003). Supporters of making the office of President independent of a Parliamentary vote hope that increased stability will ensure from the adoption of such a measure. Skeptics are concerned that attempts may arise to set aside the elected President through the courts; bearing in mind also that under the Nauruan court system some appeals are actually heard in Australia.

== Arrangement of Parts ==
The Constitution of Nauru is divided into 11 parts and 6 schedules:

Part I (Articles 1 and 2) - The Republic of Nauru and the Supreme Law of Nauru&lt;br&gt;
Part II (Articles 3-15) - Protection of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms&lt;br&gt;
Part III (Articles 16-25) - The President and the Executive&lt;br&gt;
Part IV (Articles 26-47) - The Legislature&lt;br&gt;
Part V (Articles 48-57) - The Judicature&lt;br&gt;
Part VI (Articles 58-67) - Finance&lt;br&gt;
Part VII (Articles 68-70) - The Public Service&lt;br&gt;
Part VIII (Articles 71-76) - Citizenship&lt;br&gt;
Part IX (Articles 77-79) - Emergency Powers&lt;br&gt;
Part X (Articles 80-84) - General Provisions&lt;br&gt;
Part XI (Articles 85-100) - Transitional Provisions

<doc id="490081" wikidata="Q1071312" url="?curid=490081" title="My Little Pony">
<text>My Little Pony (MLP) is a toy line and media franchise developed by American toy company Hasbro. The first toys were developed by Bonnie Zacherle, Charles Muenchinger, and Steve D&#x27;Aguanno, and were produced in 1981. The ponies feature colorful bodies, manes and a unique symbol on one or both sides of their flanks. Such symbols are referred to in the three most recent incarnations as &quot;cutie marks&quot;. My Little Pony has been revamped several times with new and more modern looks to continue its appeal to the market, with each new look called a &quot;generation&quot; by the show&#x27;s collectors and fans. The franchise is mainly targeted at young girls, although in the 2010s, it gained a cult following by an unintended audience of adult, mostly male fans.

Following the original &quot;My Pretty Pony&quot; toy that was introduced in 1981, My Little Pony was launched in 1982 and the line became popular during the 1980s. The original toy line ran from 1982 to 1992 in the United States and to 1995 globally, and two animated specials, an animated feature-length film and two animated television series produced during the period up until 1992. The first incarnation&#x27;s popularity peaked in 1990, but the following year Hasbro decided to discontinue the toy line due to increased competition. One hundred fifty million ponies were sold in the 1980s.

The toy line was revived in 1997, but these toys proved unpopular and were discontinued in 1999. The brand saw a more popular revival in 2003 with toys that more closely resembled the original toy line, which sold approximately 100 million pony toys globally by 2010. Hasbro launched the fourth incarnation of the franchise in 2010, which started with the animated series &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot;, which ended on October 12, 2019. The brand grossed over million in retail sales in 2013, and over billion annually in retail sales in 2014 and 2015. Hasbro launched a fifth generation of toys and associated media starting September 24, 2021.

==History==
===&quot;My Pretty Pony&quot; (1981)===

&quot;My Pretty Pony&quot; is a pony figurine introduced by Hasbro in 1981 that was created by illustrator Bonnie Zacherle and sculptor Charles Muenchinger. &quot;My Pretty Pony&quot; is a ten-inch-tall hard plastic figurine that can wiggle its ears, swish its tail, and wink one eye. The original &quot;My Pretty Pony&quot; was followed by &quot;My Pretty Pony and Beautiful Baby&quot;, which came with an additional smaller &quot;baby&quot; pony figure. This was followed by pink and yellow versions of the original that have the now-hallmark symbol on the ponies&#x27; backsides, which preceded the &quot;My Little Pony&quot; figurines.

===1982–1992===
After the relative lack of success of the &quot;My Pretty Pony&quot; toy line, Hasbro introduced six smaller and colorful versions of the toy in 1982, sold under the title &quot;My Little Pony&quot;. The toy line led to many more merchandise under the &quot;My Little Pony&quot; brand, which later became unofficially known as the &quot;Generation One&quot; or &quot;G1&quot; of My Little Pony among collectors. This incarnation ended in 1992 in the United States, but was marketed internationally until 1995. Animations from mid-1980s (&quot;My Little Pony&quot; animated special, &quot;My Little Pony: Escape from Catrina&quot;, &quot;My Little Pony: The Movie&quot; and &quot;My Little Pony&quot; segment within &quot;My Little Pony &#x27;n Friends&quot; anthology series) and &quot;My Little Pony Tales&quot; from 1992 accompanied the line-up.

===1997–1999===
The 1997 incarnation was marketed by Hasbro as &quot;Friendship Garden&quot; and designated &quot;Generation 2&quot; by collectors. They were manufactured in redesigned poses with jewel eyes and turning heads and are smaller, slimmer, and longer-legged than their 1982 counterparts. The line was not successful in the U.S. and was discontinued in 1999, although it continued overseas for several years. Since the second generation was more popular in Western Europe, Hasbro continued to produce and sell them in Western Europe after 1998. Most were Earth Ponies, but a few unicorns were made internationally. Although no Pegasus Ponies were made, some adults had clip-on wings. In the early 2000s, several unicorns with clip-on wings (called the Magic Unicorns) were made. Two baby ponies were introduced, and none of the baby ponies were sold in the United States.

In Europe, the main location was renamed Ponyland instead of Friendship Gardens, and were discontinued with the inception of the &quot;G3&quot; toyline in 2003. Many ponies released in the last years of the line are considered rare. A number of playsets were introduced, including a mansion and a castle. Some of the licensed merchandise released in Europe included beanbag plushes, magazines, clothing, perfume, wrapping paper and coloring books. A CD-ROM game for PC, &quot;Friendship Gardens&quot;, was also released, which involved taking care of a pony and playing games along the way.

Some &quot;Generation Two&quot; ponies were sold as detachable key chains, including Morning Glory, Sundance, Light Heart and Ivy. Each pony comes with a comb attached to her neck by a string. The back of the package says, &quot;My Little Pony Logo and Pony Names are Trademarks of Hasbro Inc. Copyright 1998.&quot; They were produced under license by Fun-4-All Corporation and made in China.

====&quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Gardens&quot; (1998)====
&quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Gardens&quot; is a virtual pet game developed by Artech Studios and published by Hasbro Interactive.

===2003–2009===
The third incarnation of &quot;My Little Pony&quot;, which is often unofficially referred to as &quot;Generation Three&quot; or &quot;G3&quot; by collectors, began in 2003. The revamped line of dolls was targeted to a younger audience than the previous lines. Before the generation&#x27;s end in 2009, there were at least two minor revamps. A series of direct-to-video animated films (mostly produced by SD Entertainment) accompanied the line-up.

===2010–2021===

The next incarnation of &quot;My Little Pony&quot;, unofficially known as the &quot;Generation Four&quot;, was launched in 2010. It is set in a fictional location named Equestria, and the main characters include Twilight Sparkle, Spike, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Applejack, Rarity and Fluttershy. Television series &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot;, theatrical film &quot;My Little Pony: The Movie&quot;, as well as other related media accompany the current line-up. This era generated a fandom among grown-ups with the success of the television series.

&quot;My Little Pony: Equestria Girls&quot;, the anthropomorphic spin-off, was launched in 2013.

&quot;My Little Pony: Pony Life&quot;, a spin-off comedy series, launched in 2020 featuring a new, animation style.

=== 2021–present===

Hasbro announced the start of the current &quot;Generation Five&quot; toy line in February 2021, with a 3D CG-animated film (produced by Entertainment One and animated by Boulder Media) and a follow-up television series. Unlike previous generation changes which have generally featured a completely new set of characters, Generation Five will build upon the world and stories established in Generation Four from &quot;Friendship Is Magic&quot;, but will include a time jump as to introduce new characters and themes. According to Hasbro&#x27;s Emily Thompson, vice president of global brand management for Entertainment One, the new line is aimed at Generation Alpha, which &quot;has a higher emotional intelligence, and they expect a lot more from their entertainment&quot;; to that end, the themes of the show will be aimed around diversity and inclusion but will still include nods and Easter eggs to the prior generation.

The film and series takes place sometime after the end of &quot;Friendship Is Magic&quot;, where &quot;friendship and harmony have been replaced by paranoia and mistrust&quot; and the various pony species have segregated into their own tribes. The main characters of Generation Five includes Sunny Starscout (a female earth pony), Izzy Moonbow (a female unicorn) and Hitch Trailblazer, (a male earth pony), alongside Pegasus siblings Pipp Petals and Zipp Storm.

The film was originally slated for theatrical release by Paramount Pictures, but the release was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was sold to Netflix, with the film&#x27;s release date being set on September 24, 2021. Netflix also greenlit its follow-up CG-animated series, which will also debut on the streaming service.

The film was succeeded by a special and streaming television series titled &quot;My Little Pony: Make Your Mark&quot; in May and September 2022 respectively, and a Christmas-themed special, titled &quot;My Little Pony: Winter Wishday&quot; in November, on Netflix. A YouTube exclusive series titled, &quot;My Little Pony: Tell Your Tale&quot; premiered in April 2022. The second season of &quot;Make Your Mark&quot;, alongside its 44-minute special &quot;Bridlewoodstock&quot;, was released in June 2023. The final episodes of the &quot;Make Your Mark&quot; were released on November 23, 2023, alongside the special &quot;Secrets of Starlight&quot;. A Tell Your Tale special, &quot;The Blockywockys&quot; was released on April 4, 2024.

==Television series and films==
==Adult fans==
===Collectors===
&quot;My Little Pony&quot; toys drew the attention of collectors from their initial release. Media coverage in the 2000s reported on collectors&#x27; conventions, finding it odd that adult women are interested in &quot;My Little Pony&quot;. The 2004 &quot;My Little Pony Collectors&#x27; Convention&quot; reportedly had only one man among the attendees. When updating the toy line, Hasbro reassured collectors that it will produce &quot;My Little Pony&quot; editions for collectors.

Over 4,000 My Little Pony objects are on display until 2025 in Croydon, London in the &quot;Come As You Really Are&quot; exhibition.

===&quot;Friendship Is Magic&quot; fandom===
Despite Hasbro&#x27;s target demographic of young girls and their parents, the fourth incarnation of the franchise became a cultural and Internet phenomenon as the &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot; television series generated an unexpected fandom, with many male fans between 13 and 35 creating a large fanbase and a multitude of creative works, fan sites, and conventions. The fanbase has adopted the name &quot;brony&quot;, a blend of &quot;bro&quot; and &quot;pony&quot;, to describe themselves. The older fanbase had come as a surprise to Hasbro and staff members involved with the show. They have appreciated and embraced the fandom, adding nods to the fans within the show and the toys. Sherilyn Connelly and others have noted that bronies alienate other fans of the franchise by focusing on the fandom itself rather than the show.

== Social impact ==
===Consumerism===
&quot;My Little Pony&quot; is often derided for promoting consumerism. When the media adaptations of the franchise debuted, there was much controversy in the United States about television advertising targeted at children. Relaxed regulation in the 1980s on cross-referencing between programming and commercials led to toy-based shows, such as Mattel&#x27;s &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;, Hasbro&#x27;s &quot;Transformers&quot;, &quot;G. I. Joe&quot;, and later &quot;My Little Pony &#x27;n&#x27; Friends&quot;. While &quot;He-Man&quot; initially drew the most controversy, &quot;My Little Pony&quot; remained controversial for many decades later, even when it was not being produced; the criticism is much more harsh and enduring than similar franchises with toy lines. Sherilyn Connelly cites examples from authors and journalists who single out &quot;My Little Pony&quot; for being tied to toys and merchandise, often putting it &quot;first against the wall&quot; while sparing such criticism from the aforementioned Hasbro franchises, or franchises such as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Toy Story&quot;, and &quot;Lego&quot;. Connelly notes that professionals who work with children, for example psychologists and librarians, often have a positive view on the franchise; psychologist John Rosemond described &quot;My Little Pony&quot; toys as &quot;great, soothing, quiet-time toys&quot;, having none of the violence or sexuality of other toy franchises. The first animated series is often given as the worst example of a Saturday-morning cartoon, despite never airing on Saturday mornings. Even though no &quot;My Little Pony&quot; adaptation was airing on television for much of the 1990s and no toys were being produced, it was still often brought up as a contemporary example of aggressive marketing through television.

===Femininity===
Connelly contends that &quot;My Little Pony&quot; is singled out not because the franchise&#x27;s business methods or content standards are particularly different from other franchises&#x27;, but because it is overtly girly. Replying to criticism that &quot;My Little Pony&quot; is &quot;junk&quot; while &quot;Star Wars&quot; stems from &quot;integrity and creative vision&quot;, cartoonist Craig McCracken noted that both franchises can have integrity or be junk, depending on how they&#x27;re produced. Character designer Chris Battle pointed out that the media adaptation of &quot;My Little Pony&quot; is seen as less valid because it is aimed at girls. Director Lauren Faust, who was creative developer of the relaunch of the &quot;My Little Pony&quot; franchise in 2010, wrote that she expected people who have not even watched the animated series &quot;to instantly label it girly, stupid, cheap, for babies or an evil corporate commercial.&quot; Faust feels that the show&#x27;s femininity makes it a target of derision, regardless of its other qualities. Ellen Seiter, professor of media studies, observed that girl&#x27;s television shows are a ghettoization of girl culture, and the attacks on these shows is often aimed at their femininity. &quot;My Little Pony&quot; has been perceived as an icon of femininity and &quot;girlie-girls&quot;, particularly in the United Kingdom. The franchise has alternately been described as asexual and &quot;too&quot; sexual by the UK media.

===Fan-made sexualization===
The aforementioned fandom is known for its numerous pornographic and erotic fan works, collectively termed as &quot;clop&quot;.

It includes art, fan fiction, and games. The term &quot;clop&quot;, based on the onomatopoeic hoofbeat sound, also means masturbation in this context. &quot;Clop&quot; content emerged on the web around 2012 and typically focuses more on character romance. A study suggests about 19% of these fans, have engaged in &quot;clopping&quot;. Critics view it as a problematic aspect of the fandom, fearing it might taint the fandom&#x27;s reputation.

<doc id="490086" wikidata="Q7048017" url="?curid=490086" title="Diversity Immigrant Visa">
<text>The Diversity Immigrant Visa program, also known as the green card lottery, is a United States government lottery program for receiving an immigrant visa followed by a permanent resident card. The Immigration Act of 1990 established the current and permanent Diversity Visa (DV) program.

The lottery is administered by the Department of State and conducted under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). It provides up to 55,000 immigrant visas annually and aims to diversify the immigrant population in the United States, by selecting applicants from countries with low numbers of immigrants in the previous five years. More than 22 million people apply for the lottery each year, which means that fewer than 1 in 400 applicants receive visas.

Applicants enter the lottery by completing a form on the Department of State website, free of charge. Only those selected in the lottery must pay a fee to continue the process.

Attempts have been made to end the program since 2005.

==History==
===Legislative and administrative history=== 
Starting in 1986, the United States established several temporary immigrant visa programs outside of the usual immigration preferences (family members or by employment). The first program was NP-5, run from 1987 to 1989, where a limited number of visas was issued on a first-come, first-served basis. The second program was OP-1, run through a lottery from 1989 to 1991 and available for natives of countries with low levels of recent immigration to the United States. The third program, AA-1, from 1992 to 1994, was available for natives from a select group of countries that had been &quot;adversely affected&quot; by earlier immigration laws. Intentionally and in practice, people from Ireland and Northern Ireland benefited disproportionately from these programs. They were also known as the Donnelly, Berman and Morrison visas, respectively, after the sponsoring congressmen. The Government of Ireland has actively supported the various lottery bills and similar legislation since their inception.

The Donnelly visa benefited &quot;several thousand Irish&quot; (almost 4,000) and the Berman visa had some 500 Irish beneficiaries. Under the three-year Morrison program (1992–94), by far the largest in size, those born in Ireland or Northern Ireland received a set-aside of 40% of all diversity visas, for a total of 48,000 set aside visas out of 120,000. Natives or citizens of Poland, via the sheer volume of applicants, received the second largest number of visas. The United Kingdom came in a distant third with some 6,000 visas in the Morrison program.

The Immigration Act of 1990 was passed with bipartisan support and signed by President George H. W. Bush. The legislation established the current and permanent Diversity Visa (DV) program, where 55,000 immigrant visas are available in an annual lottery. The lottery aims to diversify the immigrant population in the United States, by selecting applicants mostly from countries with low numbers of immigrants to the United States in the previous five years.

From fiscal year 1999, the number of visas in the DV program was reduced by up to 5,000, to partially compensate the number of immigrants under the NACARA program, and from fiscal year 2025, also to compensate the number of immigrants under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024. As a result, the number of visas in the DV program was reduced to 50,000 from fiscal years 1999 to 2019, about 54,800 from 2020 to 2024, and about 51,350 in 2025.

The first DV lottery, for fiscal year 1995, was named DV-1. For fiscal years 1996 to 1999, the name was in the format DV-YY, where YY was the last two digits of the year. Since fiscal year 2000 the lotteries have been named in the format DV-YYYY, with the full year number. The year in the name refers to the fiscal year when the immigrant visas will be given, which starts in October of the previous calendar year, and the entry period for the lottery occurs almost a year earlier. Therefore, there is a two-year difference between the lottery name and its entry period. For example, for DV-2017 (fiscal year starting in October 2016), the entry period was in 2015.

Initially, the DV lottery was administered entirely by mail, and only winners were notified. The entry form moved to an online system starting in DV-2005, but still only winners were notified, by mail. Starting in DV-2010, all applicants are able to verify online whether they were selected. Notification of winners also by mail continued until DV-2011, but since DV-2012 it is done exclusively online.

In 2011, a computer error caused a non-random selection of lottery applicants, leading the Department of State to cancel the initial result. About 22,000 applicants had already been notified and were disappointed to find that their selection was canceled. The Department of State later ran a new selection after correcting the error.

Starting in 2019, for DV-2021, applicants had to hold a valid passport and provide its number on the lottery entry form. This requirement reduced the number of applicants by more than half compared to previous years. In 2022, the requirement was removed after a federal court found that the Department of State had not followed the proper procedure, with a public notice and comments, before implementing it. In 2024, the Department of State began the proper procedure to restore the passport requirement.

===Criticism and repeal efforts===
Criticism of the program has focused on instances of fraud, racism and the random nature of the lottery, as well as criminal or terrorist actions perpetrated by certain lottery winners.

In 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, an Egyptian immigrant who maintained residency in United States through his wife&#x27;s diversity visa, killed two people and injured four others at Los Angeles International Airport before being shot to death by an El Al security guard. This led to criticism of the lottery as a security threat.

Several attempts have been made to eliminate the lottery. In December 2005, the United States House of Representatives voted 273–148 to add an amendment to the border enforcement bill H.R. 4437 abolishing the DV. Opponents of the lottery said it was susceptible to fraud and was a way for terrorists to enter the country. The Senate never passed the bill. In March 2007, Congressman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) introduced , which would eliminate the Diversity Visa program. In June 2007, the U.S. House passed to eliminate funding for the program, and the Senate did likewise in September.

However, the final version of this bill with amendments, signed into law on December 26, 2007, did not include the removal of funds for the program. Although H.R. 2764 was an appropriation bill and could only cut funds for the lottery during one fiscal year, this was the first time that both the House and the Senate passed a bill to halt the Diversity Visa program.

Rep. Goodlatte reintroduced his Security and Fairness Enhancement for America Act (formerly H.R. 1430, now ) on May 7, 2009. The bill would have amended the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the diversity immigrant program completely, but did not pass. Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-TX) introduced the Save America Comprehensive Immigration Act of 2009 () on January 7, 2009. The bill would have doubled the number of diversity visas available to 110,000 yearly. This bill did not pass. A comprehensive analysis of DV lottery issues was prepared in 2011 by Congressional Research Service.

In 2013, the so-called &quot;Gang of Eight&quot; - a bi-partisan group of eight United States Senators - introduced a bill that would have comprehensively reformed the immigration system. The bill would have repealed the Diversity Immigrant Visa program. The legislation passed the Senate, but was defeated in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives amid Republican opposition.

In 2017, Sayfullo Habibullaevich Saipov, who had immigrated from Uzbekistan on a diversity visa in 2010, killed eight and injured eleven when he drove his truck down a bike path in Lower Manhattan. In response, President Donald Trump, who had earlier called for a return to a &quot;merit-based&quot; immigration system, called for an end to the program. Following Trump&#x27;s call to end the program, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, indicated that diversity visa lottery recipients lack thorough vetting, something Politifact rated as false, noting that all recipients of the visa undergo background checks, security screenings, and interviews by consular officers before arrival in the U.S.

==Process==
===Requirements===
To enter the lottery, applicants must have been born in an eligible country, with two exceptions: the applicant may claim the spouse&#x27;s country of birth instead if desired, or a parent&#x27;s country of birth if neither parent was born in the applicant&#x27;s country of birth and neither parent legally resided there when the applicant was born. The applicant&#x27;s country of residence or nationality is irrelevant to the lottery.

If selected in the lottery, to qualify for the immigrant visa, applicants must have completed at least a high school education or at least two years of work experience in an occupation which requires at least two other years of training or experience. They must also satisfy general requirements applicable to all immigrants, mainly related to health, criminal background and means of support.

Applicants enter the lottery by completing a form on the Department of State website, free of charge. Only those selected in the lottery must pay a fee to continue the process.

===Geographical distribution===
The visas are distributed among six regions: Africa, Asia, Europe (Turkey, Cyprus and all countries in the former Soviet Union are allocated to Europe, even though some of them are geographically entirely in Asia), Latin America (Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America), North America (consisting only of Canada and the Bahamas), and Oceania.

Dependent territories are treated as part of their respective sovereign countries, and disputed territories are allocated as recognized by the United States. For example, Bermuda is treated as part of the United Kingdom under Europe, the Gaza Strip is considered part of Egypt under Africa, and the West Bank is considered part of Jordan under Asia. However, there are some exceptions: Northern Ireland and Taiwan are treated as separate countries, and Macau is considered part of Portugal under Europe (even after its sovereignty returned to China in 1999).

Each region that was the origin of more than one sixth of the total number of immigrants to the United States via family and employment categories in the previous five years is considered a &quot;high-admission region&quot; (currently Latin America and Asia), and each region that was the origin of less than one sixth is a &quot;low-admission region&quot; (currently North America, Europe, Africa and Oceania). The proportion of diversity visas given to the low-admission group is set as the proportion of recent immigrants from the high-admission group (currently about 80%), and vice versa. Among regions of the same group, the diversity visas are allocated proportionally to their population, excluding ineligible countries (those that were the origin of more than 50,000 immigrants in the previous five years).

Within each region, the visas are not allocated among individual countries. All applicants from the same region are selected randomly as a whole, for the number of visas allocated for that region, but with the limitation that no single country may receive more than 7% of the total diversity visas (3,850).

Although only up to 55,000 diversity visas are available each year, the lottery selects more than 100,000 applicants. The reason for the larger selection is to ensure that all available diversity visas are eventually given each year, as some applicants are expected to fail general immigration requirements or may decide to withdraw and not to continue the process. As a result, some lottery winners who have received notifications might not obtain visas.

It is also possible that some visas remain available after all initially selected applicants are reviewed. In this case, additional applicants are selected later. For this reason, applicants who were not initially selected in the lottery should keep checking their status online periodically, until the end of the respective fiscal year.

===Ineligible countries===
Those born in any territory that was the origin of more than 50,000 immigrants to the United States via family and employment categories in the previous five years are not eligible to receive a diversity visa. For DV-2026 (the most recent lottery, with entry period in 2024), natives of the following nations were ineligible: Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China (mainland and Hong Kong), Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Venezuela, and Vietnam.

The limit of 50,000 immigrants refers only to people who immigrated via family and employment categories, and does not include other categories such as refugees, asylum seekers, or previous diversity immigrants. For this reason, Afghanistan, Guatemala and Ukraine were not on the ineligible list as of 2024, despite being the origin of over 50,000 total immigrants in the previous five years.

===Changes===
The first program was in fiscal year 1995, and the following 12 countries were ineligible from the start: Canada, China (mainland), Dominican Republic, El Salvador, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, United Kingdom and its dependent territories (except Northern Ireland and Hong Kong), and Vietnam. Since then, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Haiti, Honduras, Nigeria, Pakistan and Venezuela have been added to the ineligible list, Taiwan and the United Kingdom have been removed from it, and Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru, Poland and Russia have been added and later removed from the ineligible list, reflecting shifting levels of immigration from these countries.

Macau was ineligible as part of China only for DV-2002, whose entry period (October 2000) was after the transfer of sovereignty of Macau from Portugal to China (December 1999) but before enactment of the Macau Policy Act (December 2000), which specified that U.S. law would treat Macau as it did before the transfer. Hong Kong was considered as a separate country for the lottery and eligible from the start, but became ineligible as part of China from DV-2022.

==Statistics==




==Deceptive agencies==
There is no charge to enter the Diversity Visa lottery, and the only way to do so is by completing and sending the electronic form available at the U.S. Department of State website during the registration period. However, there are numerous companies and websites that charge a fee in order to complete the form for the applicant. The Department of State and the Federal Trade Commission have warned that some of these businesses falsely claim to increase someone&#x27;s chances of winning the lottery, or that they are affiliated with the U.S. government.

There have also been numerous cases of fraudulent emails and letters which falsely claim to have been sent by the Department of State and that the recipient has been granted a permanent resident card. These messages prompt the recipients to transfer a &quot;visa processing fee&quot; as a prerequisite for obtaining a &quot;guaranteed&quot; green card. The messages are sometimes sent to people who never participated in the lottery and can look trustworthy as they contain the recipient&#x27;s exact name and contact details and what appears to be a legal notice.

The Department of State has issued a warning against the scammers. It notes that any email claiming the recipient to be a winner of the lottery is fake because the Department has never notified and will not notify winners by email. The Department has urged recipients of such messages to notify the Internet Crime Complaint Center about the scam.

The office of inspector general has identified multiple problems with DV lottery in several countries, including Ukraine, Ghana, Albania in embassy inspection reports.

According to testimony from Stephen A. Edson before the House Judiciary Committee, &quot;in Bangladesh, for example, one agent is reported to have enrolled an entire phone book so that he could then either extort money from winning applicants who had never entered the program to begin with or sell their winning slots to others.&quot;

==Impact==
===Economic===
Labor economists and others have credited the Diversity Visa program for providing economic benefits to the United States and enhancing the competitiveness of the U.S. labor force.

Research by Lewis and several other economists shows that diverse and low-skilled immigrants lift the wages of native-born workers, as those immigrants are less substitutable to native-born workers.

Charles Kenny, an economist at the Center for Global Development, noted that research by Harvard economist Alberto Alesina found that countries with a higher share of foreign-born populations tended to have more innovation and higher incomes.

===Security===
In 2004, the State Department&#x27;s deputy inspector general warned that there were security risks to granting visas to winners from countries with ties to terrorism. A 2007 Government Accountability Office report however found no evidence that recipients of diversity visas posed a threat.

According to PolitiFact, &quot;there is at least one documented example of an individual who migrated through the diversity visa system and was later arrested on terrorism-related charges. But it is unclear that the diversity lottery has historically been used as a strategic entry point for terrorists.&quot;

The uncle of Akayed Ullah, the man who set off a bomb on a New York City Subway platform in 2017, won a diversity lottery, which enabled him to bring his nephew to the United States under the family reunification provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.

Experts on immigration note that the chances of winning the lottery are low and those who do win the lottery still have to undergo background checks and vetting, which makes the diversity lottery program a poor choice for immigrants considering launching terrorist attacks in the United States.

According to the Cato Institute, immigrants from the countries with the highest percentage of diversity visas have vastly lower incarceration rates than native-born Americans.

<doc id="490089" wikidata="Q1508876" url="?curid=490089" title="Peterborough Petes">
<text>The Peterborough Petes are a junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League. The team has played at the Peterborough Memorial Centre in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, since 1956, and is the oldest continuously operating team in the league.

==History==
The Petes were formed on October 1, 1956, when the Kitchener Canucks relocated to Peterborough after the 1955–56 season. They also became a sponsored junior team for the Montreal Canadiens of the NHL. The Petes played their first game on November 4, 1956, and won their first game on November 8, 1956.

The Petes have won the OHL Championship ten times, which is the second-most in OHL history behind the Oshawa Generals who have 13 and the most in the postwar era. The franchise’s most recent OHL Championship was in 2023 with a six game victory over the London Knights. They won the Memorial Cup once, in 1979.

===TPT Petes===
The team was sponsored by Toronto-Peterborough Transport (TPT) from 1956 to 1966. Scotty Bowman was brought in to coach by the Montreal Canadiens organization from the Ottawa-Hull Canadiens junior team, and led the team to a second-place finish in 1959. Peterborough defeated the Barrie Flyers, Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters and Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors in the playoffs to win their first OHA championship. Bowman and the TPT Petes went on to reach the Memorial Cup for the first time that year but fell to the Winnipeg Braves. The TPT Petes claimed their first Hamilton Spectator Trophy during the 1965-66 season, but were eliminated from the playoffs.

===Roger Neilson era (1966–1976)===
The team became known as the Peterborough Petes Hockey Club in 1966–67, which was also the beginning of Roger Neilson&#x27;s tenure as coach. The Petes wore the TPT logo on their sweaters until 1974–75, when their colours were changed to maroon and white and a new &quot;Petes&quot; logo was adopted.

Neilson led his team to seven consecutive winning seasons from 1968 to 1975, also finishing first overall in 1970–71, winning the J. Ross Robertson Cup in 1972, and were runners-up in 1973 and 1974. In the 1972 Memorial Cup, the Petes lost a close 2–1 game in the finals to the Cornwall Royals.

Neilson left behind a winning legacy in Peterborough and set the standard for coaches to come. Neilson was the first coach to use videotape analysis as a teaching method, leading to the nickname &quot;Captain Video,&quot; and also the first to use microphone headsets to communicate with his assistant coaches.

Neilson also pushed the envelope causing several rules to be rewritten. During one Petes game, his team was up one goal, but was down two men in a five on three situation for the last minute of the game. Realizing that more penalties could not be called under the existing rules, Neilson put too many men on the ice every ten seconds. The referees stopped the play and a faceoff was held relieving pressure on the defence. After this display the rule was changed so that a call for too many men on the ice in a 5 on 3 situation now leads to a penalty shot.

Neilson also discovered that if he put a defenceman in net instead of a goalie during a penalty shot, the defenceman could rush the attacker and greatly reduce the chances of a goal. Today the rule states that a team must use a goalie in net for a penalty shot, and that the goalie may not leave the crease until the attacking player touches the puck.

Neilson was promoted for the 1976–77 season, coaching the Dallas Black Hawks in the former Central Hockey League.

===Three seasons, three titles===
The Peterborough Petes won three consecutive OHL championships in 1978, 1979 and 1980. Gary Green coached the first two championships followed up by Mike Keenan in 1980. The Petes won the Hamilton Spectator Trophy two consecutive times in 1979 and 1980. Peterborough&#x27;s success also continued into the Memorial Cup, reaching the championship game all three years, and winning the national junior title in 1979.

Many future NHL stars played for Petes in these three years. Those of note are: Keith Acton, Bob Atwell, Keith Crowder, Ken Ellacott, Doug Evans, Dave Fenyves, Tom Fergus, Larry Floyd, Mark Kirton, Rick LaFerriere, Steve Larmer, Larry Murphy, Mark Reeds, Stuart Smith, Steve Smith, Bill Gardner, Tim Trimper and Jim Wiemer.

===Dick Todd era (1982–1993)===
Dick Todd started with the Petes as a trainer in the 1970s and was with the team through their three Memorial Cups. As a coach he led the team to two more Memorial Cup tournaments—in 1989 in Saskatoon, and in 1993 in Sault Ste. Marie. During Todd&#x27;s time as coach, the Petes won six division titles and had the best overall winning percentage in the OHL. Todd was awarded the Matt Leyden Trophy as OHL Coach of the Year in 1987–88.

===Memorial Cup 1996===
The Peterborough Petes celebrated their 40th anniversary in 1996. The Petes won the J. Ross Robertson Cup defeating the Guelph Storm in the finals, then and also played at home while hosting the Memorial Cup tournament in 1996. The club achieved a 100% sellout each tournament game, and lost in the final that year to the Granby Prédateurs.

===50th anniversary===

Todd returned as head coach of the Petes in 2004. Todd&#x27;s second season back behind the Petes bench, was the 50th anniversary of the Peterborough Petes founding. They are the oldest continuously operating franchise in the Ontario Hockey League (the rival Oshawa Generals date to 1937 but were inactive from 1953 to 1962).

The Petes celebrated their 50th anniversary in grand style, winning the J. Ross Robertson Cup on May 11, 2006, in a four-game sweep of the London Knights. Peterborough travelled to Moncton, New Brunswick, to play in the 2006 Memorial Cup, losing the third place tiebreaker game to the Vancouver Giants. Todd retired for good a few weeks after the Petes returned from Moncton.

===60th anniversary===
The 2015–16 season marked the 60th in franchise history.

===Rob Wilson era (2018–present)===
Under Rob Wilson, the franchise has made three playoff appearances. In 2023, the franchise won its tenth OHL championship, defeating the London Knights, earning its tenth trip to the Memorial Cup.

==Uniforms and logos==
From 1956 to 1974, the Petes wore the red, white &amp; blue colours of the Montreal Canadiens. In 1974–75, the club changed to the maroon &amp; white colours they wear today. In January 2000, a new &#x27;3rd&#x27; jersey was introduced, that used the maroon background, with white, black &amp; gold trim.

For the 2005–06 season, the Petes unveiled a 50th anniversary jersey that has a black background with maroon and gold trim. During January in the 2006–07 season, the Petes wore throwback jerseys for the TPT Petes.

==Arena==


The Peterborough Memorial Centre was constructed in 1956, and named in honour of the many war veterans who came from the region. It was built at the east of the fairground and horse track at the corner of Landsdowne and George streets.

The original design included a large stage at the south end of the arena, with an oversized portrait of Queen Elizabeth II above. The seats were all wooden and painted yellow, green and mauve. The Memorial Centre hosted the Memorial Cup tournament in 1996. The arena has a capacity of 4,329 for hockey, and an additional 1,000 for concerts.

In 2003, the Memorial Centre was renovated adding 24 luxury box suites, improved concessions, a licensed restaurant, new seats, boards, scoreboard and the addition of air conditioning. The renovated arena hosted the 2004 OHL All-Star Classic.

Canadian Football Hall of Fame inductee John Badham briefly served as the public address announcer for Peterborough Petes home games.

<text>Renfrew County is a county and census division in the Canadian province of Ontario. It straddles the west bank of the Ottawa River. There are 17 municipalities in the county. Its county seat is Pembroke, which is geographically within the county but administered independently.

==History==
===Bathurst District===
When Carleton County was withdrawn from Bathurst District in 1838, Renfrew County was severed from part of the remaining Lanark County, but the two remained united for electoral purposes. By 1845, all lands in the District had been surveyed into the following townships:

===United Counties of Lanark and Renfrew===
Effective January 1, 1850, Bathurst District was abolished, and the &quot;United Counties of Lanark and Renfrew&quot; replaced it for municipal and judicial purposes. The counties remained united for electoral purposes in the Parliament of the Province of Canada, referred to as the County of Lanark, until Renfrew gained its own seat in 1853.

The separation of Renfrew from Lanark began in 1861, with the creation of a Provisional Municipal Council that held its first meeting in June 1861. The United Counties were dissolved in August 1866.

===Geographical evolution===
The territory was originally described in 1838 as consisting of:

In 1851, Pakenham was transferred to Lanark, while Renfrew was expanded through the addition of:

In 1860, the newly surveyed townships of Miller and Canonto were transferred to Frontenac County, while the townships of Raglan, Lyndoch, Radcliffe and Brudenell were added to Renfrew. The final expansion of the County occurred in 1877-1878, with the transfer of the United Townships of Hagarty, Sherwood, Jones, Richards and Burns, and the United Townships of Head, Clara and Maria, from Nipissing District.

Once all lands had been surveyed in 1878, the County consisted of the following geographic townships:

*Admaston
*Alice
*Bagot
*Blythfield
*Bromley
*Brougham
*Brudenell
*Buchanan

==History==
From 1998 to 2002, the IceDogs enjoyed little success, finishing last in the OHL&#x27;s Central Division every year. During this building phase, the team had six head coaches within the span of 4 years, including the owner, Don Cherry. Mississauga drafted first overall each year, leading to two rookies of the year, including one of the highest touted NHL prospects in Jason Spezza.

The team changed ownership in 2002 with venture capitalist Joel Albin acquiring the team from owners Don Cherry, Retrocom, sports agent Elliott Kerr, and Trevor Whiffer - lawyer of Don Cherry and the general manager of the IceDogs&#x27;.

In the 2002–03 season, the IceDogs finished fourth in the Central Division and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, but lost in the first round in five games against the Ottawa 67&#x27;s.

2003–04 was the IceDogs&#x27; best season. The team finished second in the Central Division, two points behind the division champion Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors, and third overall in the Eastern Conference.

In the first round of the playoffs, the IceDogs defeated the Oshawa Generals in seven games, winning their first-ever playoff series. The IceDogs were down three games to two against the Barrie Colts in the second round but managed to come back and win the series in seven games. The surprise IceDogs then upset the St. Michael&#x27;s Majors in the Eastern Conference Championship series in six games to win the Bobby Orr Trophy and earn their first-ever trip to the Ontario Hockey League finals. The dream ended there as they fell to the Guelph Storm in four straight games in the OHL final, losing the fourth game at the Hershey Centre.

The 2004–05 season was another record setting season for the IceDogs. They won their first ever Central Division title and finished first in the Eastern Conference with 81 points. Despite regular season success, the IceDogs were upset in the first round of the playoffs by the eighth-seeded St. Michael&#x27;s Majors in five games. In 2005–06, the IceDogs started rebuilding and missed the playoffs again.

===Change in ownership===
On July 12, 2006, Eugene Melnyk, owner of the Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors and the NHL&#x27;s Ottawa Senators, bought the Mississauga IceDogs. 

After the 2006–07 season, Melnyk sold the IceDogs, and moved the Majors to the Hershey Centre in Mississauga. 

On January 8, 2007, Toronto businessman Tom Bitove proposed to buy the team with plans to move to Niagara Falls, but city council declined the proposal to build a new arena. As an alternative, the team approached the City of St. Catharines about moving the team into Jack Gatecliff Arena in the downtown core. St. Catharines City Council voted on a leasing arrangement on April 23, 2007, which passed. 

Bill Burke bought the IceDogs and relocated the team to St. Catharines in time for the 2007–08 season, to be known as the Niagara IceDogs. The IceDogs played their final game in Mississauga on April 1, 2007, losing in game 5 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals at home to the Sudbury Wolves.

==Coaches==
Former team owner and hockey commentator Donald S. Cherry stepped behind the bench to coach the IceDogs for the 2001–02 season, after going through five coaches in three years. The team had its best season to the date, but still failed to reach the playoffs. The IceDogs were one of the highest-selling road teams in the OHL that year, as many spectators attended games to see Don Cherry coach and seek autographs.

The Mississauga IceDogs had the first overall draft pick four years in a row, which produced two rookies of the year, and a total of ten alumni have played in the National Hockey League.

==Uniforms and logos==

The IceDogs&#x27; colours are red, white, black and silver. The logo is styled after Don Cherry&#x27;s pet bull terrier named Blue. It shows a snarling dog overtop of the IceDogs name with a maple leaf in the background. The original logo (inset right) looked like an ice crystalized dog with red eyes in front of a big letter &quot;M&quot; with a maple leaf in the corner. The logo was redesigned after their 5th season with the change in ownership.

==Arena==
The Mississauga IceDogs played their home games at the Hershey Centre in northeast Mississauga, near the junction of Highways 401, 403 and 410. The Hershey Centre hosted the OHL All-Star Game in 2000.

<text>The Guelph Storm are a major junior ice hockey team based in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. They have played in the OHL since the 1991–92 season. The team plays home games at the Sleeman Centre.

==History==
The franchise started as the Toronto Marlboros, who moved to Hamilton to become the Dukes of Hamilton in 1989. Following the 1990–91 season, the franchise was relocated to Guelph and a contest was held to name the team. Tom Douglas submitted the winning entry &quot;Storm&quot; and the team was renamed the Guelph Storm.

The first year in Guelph was dismal, but the building process for Guelph was soon successful. The Storm finished first place in the 1994–95 season. General Manager Mike Kelly was voted the OHL Executive of the Year and Craig Hartsburg voted the Coach of the Year for the Canadian Hockey League and the Ontario Hockey League. Draft picks from the early years in Guelph include Jeff O&#x27;Neill and Todd Bertuzzi.

Guelph reached the OHL finals in 1995 and 1996. The team qualified for the 1996 Memorial Cup by playing against the Memorial Cup host Peterborough Petes in the OHL final.

The Storm won their first J. Ross Robertson Cup in 1998. This success continued into the Memorial Cup Tournament as the Storm rallied to the Championship Game where they lost to the Portland Winter Hawks in overtime in the final game.

In the year 2000, the team moved from the historic but aging Guelph Memorial Gardens into the Guelph Sports and Entertainment Centre (since renamed the Sleeman Centre). The Storm were selected to host the 2002 Memorial Cup tournament. It marked the team&#x27;s third appearance in the national junior championship, their first as host team.

Two years later, the Storm won their second OHL Championship, and returned to the 2004 Memorial Cup hosted in Kelowna, British Columbia.

In the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, defenceman Drew Doughty was selected 2nd overall by the Los Angeles Kings, the highest ever selection of a Guelph Storm player.

In 2014, the Storm captured their third OHL Championship, and subsequently advanced to the 2014 Memorial Cup final, hosted in London, Ontario. The Edmonton Oil Kings won Cup championship on 25 May 2014 with a 6-3 win over the Storm.

In late April 2019, the team captured the Wayne Gretzky Trophy as 2019 OHL Western Conference Champions again winning the J. Ross Robertson Cup. On 12 May 2019, in the sixth game of the finals, the Storm defeated the Ottawa 67&#x27;s to win the OHL championship and were again headed to the Memorial Cup, their sixth appearance, to start on 17 May in Halifax. Nick Suzuki (a Montreal Canadiens prospect) earned the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award as OHL Playoff MVP. He was the third Storm player in the team&#x27;s history to win this award.

In 2021,the team agreed to stop using the song Cotton Eye Joe by the group Rednex during games after consultation with local groups alleging the song has racist origins.

==Uniforms and logos==
For the 2007/08 season, the team switched to a crimson and white colour scheme with the same logo that was on the last jerseys, except the &quot;stripes&quot; that appear across the &quot;belly&quot; of the Storm logo itself were modified from black to crimson. The white jersey has &quot;STORM&quot; written on top of the logo, and the crimson jersey has &quot;GUELPH&quot; above the logo. The new shoulder patches, featuring the alternate &quot;GS&quot; logo, have been redesigned and are meant to be read from the inside (the &quot;G&quot;) outward (the &quot;S&quot;).

The Guelph Storm primary logo is one of the team&#x27;s mascots &quot;Spyke&quot; surrounded by a twister with the team name above it. The team colours are white, grey, crimson and black. Home jerseys have a white background with &quot;STORM&quot; above the logo, and away jerseys have a crimson background with &quot;GUELPH&quot; above the logo.

The previous Guelph Storm logo was used from 1991 to 1995. The team colours then were white, blue, grey and black. Home jerseys had a white background and away jerseys had a blue background.

==Arenas==
The Guelph Storm played at the Guelph Memorial Gardens from 1991 until the year 2000 when moving to the new Guelph Sports and Entertainment Centre, since renamed the Sleeman Centre. The GSEC was built into what was a former Eaton&#x27;s department store in a downtown shopping mall. The GSEC hosted the 2001 Hershey Cup and the 2002 Memorial Cup.

<text>The Owen Sound Attack are a junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League based in Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada. Based in Owen Sound since 1989, and operating under the current name since 2000, the Attack play their home games at the J. D. McArthur Arena inside the Harry Lumley Bayshore Community Centre.

==History==
The Owen Sound OHL franchise was born when the Holody family moved the Guelph Platers to the city for the 1989–90 OHL season. The team kept the name of Owen Sound Platers.

The Owen Sound Attack were born in the late summer of the year 2000 as a community-based OHL franchise. When the Holody family decided to sell the Owen Sound Platers buyers were sought from any city.

Several local Owen Sound business people realized that an out-of-town buyer would mean losing the team to relocation. The most mentioned former OHL city was Cornwall, Ontario. This local business group banded together to purchase the team. After a bidding war and a summer-long legal battle with another suitor, the team remained in Owen Sound.

The ownership group elected for a name change and came up with the more modern sounding &quot;Owen Sound Attack&quot;. The 2004–05 season was the best regular season in the OHL history of Owen Sound. General Manager Mike Futa was recognized by the OHL for his work in building the team with the OHL Executive of the Year award. The club also played host to the OHL All-Star Classic in 2005.
In 2010–11, the Attack wore the jerseys of the 1951 Allan Cup Champion Owen Sound Mercurys as a throwback third jersey.

On April 27, 2011, the Owen Sound Attack earned their first OHL Conference Championship and their first berth in the Memorial Cup tournament since relocating from Guelph with a 10–4 win over the defending champion Windsor Spitfires and a result of the Memorial Cup host team, Mississauga St. Michael&#x27;s Majors winning their conference series, 4–1 over the Niagara IceDogs.

On May 15, 2011, the Attack won their first J. Ross Robertson Cup as OHL Champions, also since relocating from Guelph with a 3–2 overtime win over the Mississauga St. Michael&#x27;s Majors in the seventh game of the OHL finals.

As of the end of the 2013–14 season, the Attack were one of five OHL teams to win 30 or more games in the past four seasons, joining London, Guelph, Saginaw and Oshawa.

The Attack set a new franchise attendance mark in 2011–12 of 97,619 fans and set a new record the following year, eclipsing the 100,000 mark in 2012–13 and again in 2013–14.

==Players==

=== Owen Sound Platers award winners ===
Andrew Brunette won the 1992–93 Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy as the top scorer in the OHL with 62 Goals, 100 Assists and 162 Points. He also tied for the Canadian Hockey League&#x27;s scoring lead. Brunette was selected by the Washington Capitals 174th overall in the 7th round of 1993 NHL Entry Draft.

Jamie Storr was the 1993–94 OHL Goaltender of the Year. Storr was the starting goalie for back-to-back World Junior Hockey Championship Gold medals in 1993 and 1994. In the 1994 NHL Entry Draft he became what was then the highest-drafted goaltender overall in NHL history, by the Los Angeles Kings, 7th overall.

Dan Snyder, a former captain of the Owen Sound Platers, had his number 14 retired by the Owen Sound Attack in 2003. He is remembered in Owen Sound for his leadership on and off the ice. Snyder was twice voted his team&#x27;s Humanitarian of the Year. Snyder died from injuries suffered in a vehicular accident in 2003 after just beginning his NHL career with the Atlanta Thrashers, and the Ontario Hockey League renamed its Humanitarian of the Year award posthumously in his honour.

<text>People &amp; Planet is a network of student campaign groups in the UK. It is &quot;the largest student campaigning organisation in the country campaigning to alleviate world poverty, defend human rights and protect the environment.&quot;

==Organisation==
People &amp; Planet is Britain&#x27;s largest student network campaigning on global poverty, human rights, and the environment. The network has over 2,000 active members at 50 universities and 79 schools and colleges across the UK.

People &amp; Planet groups are autonomous and there is no formal membership system. The organisation is overseen by a Board of Trustees, the majority of whom are student members elected by the network. The support office, based in Oxford, provides training, outreach and resources to support groups and campaigns.

People &amp; Planet is funded primarily by grants from trusts and foundations. People &amp; Planet has a &quot;Fundraising and Activist Network&quot; allowing members to make regular monthly donations that provide invaluable unrestricted income to support the organisation&#x27;s work.

==History==

The organisation was founded in 1969 as &quot;Third World First&quot; by a group of students at Oxford University, supported by NGOs including Oxfam. In 1997, the network voted to change the name to People &amp; Planet.

Third World First was instrumental in setting up the magazine, &quot;The Internationalist&quot; which was later reincarnated as the now popular activist-magazine, The New Internationalist.

==Campaigns==

People &amp; Planet&#x27;s current campaign areas are climate action and the rights of migrants.

===Migrants&#x27; rights===

In 2015, People &amp; Planet students democratically decided to introduce a migrants&#x27; rights campaign at annual summer camp Power Shift: Training for Change. Staff worked with students to develop the Undoing Borders campaign, launched in 2016.

===Climate change===
Currently, People &amp; Planet are running a &quot;Fossil Free Careers&quot; campaign calling on UK universities careers&#x27; services to &quot;end recruitment pipelines into the oil, gas and mining industries.&quot; As of June 2023, 4 universities had committed to Fossil Free Careers: Wrexham Glyndwr University, The University of Bedfordshire, University of the Arts London and Bishops Grosseteste University. 15 Students&#x27; Unions have also agreed to boycott oil and gas recruitment events. 

In 2013, the People &amp; Planet network launched a new campaign targeting the fossil fuel industry, and in particular the role of fossil fuels. Working in partnership with 350.org, the Fossil Free UK campaign aims to sever the links between the fossil fuel industry and UK universities. These links include investments and endowments, academic research, sponsorship and partnership arrangements.

In 2017, People &amp; Planet introduced a new climate campaign targeting high-street banks over their financing of fossil fuels. Divest Barclays took particular aim at Barclays due to its status as the worst bank in Europe for providing finance to fossil fuel projects and companies. Students campaigned for universities and students&#x27; unions to boycott Barclays and took direct-action targeting Barclays&#x27; AGMs in 2018 and 2019.

People &amp; Planet&#x27;s previous climate change campaign, &quot;Going Greener&quot; aimed to create &#x27;Transition Universities&#x27;. It brings together a student movement on campus working towards low-carbon, resilient and community-led education institutions that achieve carbon emissions reductions of at least 50% by 2020.

===Past successes and campaigns===

People &amp; Planet activists have played a key role in action for social and environmental justice across a variety of campaigns.
*Largely due to pressure from People &amp; Planet groups, there are now over 100 Fairtrade universities and 106 Fairtrade secondary schools.
*The Ethics for USS (the University Superannuation Scheme) campaign persuaded the £20 billion lecturers’ pension fund to adopt a socially responsible investment policy. The legacy of the campaign was the founding of charity FairPensions (now ShareAction).
*People &amp; Planet supported the world&#x27;s largest ever garment boycott, which led to the establishment of the first recognised garment union in Honduras &amp; 1200 factory workers being re-employed.
*The Treat Aids Now campaign persuaded the UK government to lead an international commitment to provide HIV/AIDS treatment for all by 2010.
*As part of the Jubilee 2000 campaign, People &amp; Planet and other groups secured $88bn debt cancellation for the world&#x27;s poor.
*The &quot;Buy Right&quot; campaign, focusing on defending human rights within university supply chains. Universities are being encouraged to sign up to the Worker Rights Consortium, an independent monitoring organisation that supports workers in the garment industry in defending their workplace rights.
*People &amp; Planet was involved in setting up a new organisation, Electronics Watch, which will performed similar monitoring function in the Electronics sector. The associated Sweatshop Free campaign asked universities to affiliate to Electronics Watch.

==The People &amp; Planet University League==

People &amp; Planet&#x27;s &quot;University League&quot; is the only comprehensive and independent ranking of UK universities by environmental and ethical performance. In 2019, the People &amp; Planet University League was published in &quot;The Guardian.&quot;

The People &amp; Planet Green League was first published in 2007, as a way of driving forward environmental performance within the university sector. The People &amp; Planet University League publicly benchmarks the sector&#x27;s green credentials by combining universities&#x27; estates performance data with information about their environmental policies and management practices.

It initially scored UK universities on four key institutional factors needed to drive forward significant and sustained improvement in environmental performance, as highlighted by the Going Green report. These criteria were:

* The active, public support of senior university management for a programme of environmental performance improvement.
* Full-time staff dedicated to environmental management.
*A comprehensive review to investigate all the environmental impacts of the institution, and performance monitoring.
*A written, publicly available environmental policy.

Since the first Green League in 2007, People &amp; Planet has widened the criteria to assess both policy and performance of higher education institutions.

The University League is widely credited with shifting the UK&#x27;s Higher Education sector towards improved environmental management and performance. In 2012, People &amp; Planet awarded 46 First Class awards in the University League, compared to just 15 in 2007. Notable improvements have been measured in areas such as the proportion of renewable electricity used by universities (72%, up from 12% in 2007) and in the number of Fairtrade Universities (112, up from 41 in 2007).

In 2012, People &amp; Planet held its first ever Green League Graduation Ceremony in Westminster, celebrating the achievements of its top-ranking universities.

===Awards and Praise===

The Green League won &quot;Best Campaign&quot; at the 2007 British Environment and Media Awards.

The People &amp; Planet Green League has been shortlisted for the Green Gown Awards, administered by the Environmental Association for Universities and Colleges (EAUC).

==Notable people==

*Guy Hughes (1974–2006) was head of People &amp; Planet&#x27;s Campaigns until 2004 when, following the outbreak of war in Iraq, he set up Crisis Action, a UK initiative to help co-ordinate NGO responses to crisis situations.
*The environmental campaigner and journalist George Monbiot is patron of People &amp; Planet.
*Former members include Mark Lazarowicz, MP; Catherine Stihler, MEP (alumna and 52nd Rector at the University of St Andrews); and Mark Ballard, former MSP and Rector (at the University of Edinburgh) where the People &amp; Planet group was instrumental in his election in 2006, against a field including Magnus Linklater, Boris Johnson and John Pilger.
*The internationally published hymn writer and theologian Brian Wren is a former Coordinator of People &amp; Planet.

<text>Poon choi or puhn choi (pronounced: pun4 coi3 in Cantonese and pun choi in Hakka), pén cài in pinyin, is a traditional Hakka festival meal composed of many layers of different ingredients. It is served in large wooden, porcelain or metal basins called &quot;poon&quot;, due to the communal style of consumption. The Chinese name, transliterated as Poon choi, has been variously translated as &quot;big bowl feast&quot;, &quot;basin cuisine&quot; or &quot;Chinese casserole&quot;. The dish is also popular among the Cantonese people and has often been mistaken as a Cantonese dish.

==Origin==
According to tradition, Poon choi was invented during the late Song dynasty. When Mongol troops invaded Song China, the young Emperor fled to the area around Guangdong Province and Hong Kong. To serve the Emperor as well as his army, the locals collected all their best food available, cooked it. But there were not enough serving containers available, so they put the resulting meal in large wooden washbasins.

===Association with the New Territories===
In any event, Poon choi is associated with the early settlers of the New Territories, who had been driven south of the mainland by a series of barbarian invasions in China between the 13th and 17th centuries.

Walled village culture is well preserved in the New Territories and Poon choi gradually became a traditional dish of the walled villages. As Poon choi is a large dish portioned to be suitable for a communal meal, it was served whenever there were celebrations connected with rituals, weddings, festivals, ancestor worship and other local events as an expression of village dining culture.

==Ingredients==
Poon choi includes ingredients such as pork, beef, lamb, chicken, duck, abalone, ginseng, shark fin, fish maw, prawn, crab, dried mushroom, fishballs, squid, dried eel, dried shrimp, pigskin, chicken feet, duck feet, goose feet, bean curd and Chinese white radish.

Out of respect to their guests the villagers put only a relatively small amount of vegetables in Poon choi. To walled villagers, vegetables are not highly valued ingredients. In order to offer the best food during important annual events, villagers prefer to include mostly meat and seafood in Poon choi.

===Preparation of ingredients===
Three days are traditionally required for preparing and cooking the meal.

The first day: A trip to the mountains is required to gather firewood, which must be chopped to size. 
In ancient times when people did not have liquefied petroleum gas, plenty of firewood had to be available to cook all the food. Today, there are still many walled villages that adhere to the use of wood for fuel because the residents believe that liquefied petroleum gas is less strong and does not supply as much heat or last as long as firewood. Only a wood fire is believed to produce the real flavour of the dish.

The second day: Buy plenty of fresh ingredients
The walled village uses fresh ingredients, rarely frozen or refrigerated products, to make Poon choi. This is because these rural communities do not have refrigerators. It is also believed that only fresh ingredients can produce fresh and delicious Poon choi. Since traditional Poon choi is used for festive banquets in ancestral halls, it is considered disrespectful to the ancestors and gods if canned, frozen, or ready-to-eat products are used in its preparation.

The third day: Stew the pork
It takes a full day to achieve the desired taste so the stewing of the pork starts early in the morning. The Ancients cooked Weitou pork for at least 10 hours in order for the ‘half fat-half lean’ pork bellies to become tender and tasty.

A few decades ago, preparing Poon choi was considered a test for chefs because the long cooking time on a wooden stove required a great deal of patience and stove control.

===Layering===
Attentive layering of the ingredients contributes to the taste of the whole dish.

Appearance
Poon choi is special in that it is composed of many layers of different ingredients. Traditionally, it is also eaten layer by layer instead of first &quot;stirring everything up&quot;, although impatient diners may first snatch the popular daikon radish at the bottom with the help of the shared serving chopsticks.

Ingredients such as Chinese radishes, pigskins and bean curd are placed in the bottom of the container. In the middle of the dish there are usually pork and Chinese dried mushrooms. On the top, meat, seafood, and rare ingredients like abalone and sea cucumber are to be found.

It contributes to the attractiveness of Poon choi if dried noodles with egg are put on top to symbolise a crown.

Taste
Relatively dry ingredients such as seafood are placed on the top while other ingredients that can absorb sauce well are assigned to the bottom of the basin. This allows sauces to flow down to the bottom of the basin as people start eating from the top.

==Cultural aspects==
Poon choi is often served during religious rituals, festivals, special occasions and wedding banquets in the open areas of villages. From the 1990s, It became popular among urban dwellers as well and it can be enjoyed at many Cantonese restaurants in the autumn and winter or on special occasions throughout the year.

===Cultural values in the walled villages===
1. Showing gratitude to ancestors
The fact that villagers use only the best and freshest ingredients is a way they pay respect to their ancestors. This behaviour illustrates the character of traditional Chinese people, who keep their ancestors in mind and remain grateful to them. It also reflects their reputation of being very hospitable.

2. Teamwork and unity
Poon choi requires much manpower to prepare and cook the ingredients. So whenever there are any major events, respected villagers become the main chefs, leading and instructing the rest of the village in preparing the meal. In other words, cooking Poon choi requires teamwork among villagers, which unites them.

3. Family lineages
It is also noteworthy that different walled villages have different cooking method for preparing Poon choi in keeping with their own customs. The Poon choi recipes of every village are kept secret and not divulged to people who do not belong to the village. The recipe is regarded as a village inheritance passed from villager to villager and father to son over generations. Poon choi is thus a symbol of the continuity of the village and local family lineages.

4. Equality
Enjoying Poon choi demonstrates equality because the rich and the poor eat it together. There is no complicated etiquette, everyone can join in.

5. Signaling
If villagers do not hold a Poon choi feast, it means, for example, that a village does not approve of or accept a particular marriage.

=== Manner of eating ===
Traditional Poon choi is served in a big wooden basin. There is one on each table and every person at the table takes food from the basin, layer by layer, from the top to the bottom.

Today, people use &#x27;Gun Fai&#x27; (clean chopsticks used to move food from serving basin to personal bowl) to get the food. This more hygienic practice allows the diner to pick out particular pieces of food from the bottom of the serving basin as well. It is also becoming more acceptable to use these chopsticks to mix and turn over the food. Symbolic meanings are attached to this new custom: it causes people to work together, and it is an attempt to encourage fortune and luck coming to them.

==Poon Choi Characteristics==
Poon choi is a traditional food system in the walled villages. Whether it is festival celebration or worship ancestors, it is related to Poon choi. The villagers&#x27; gathering of basin meal is a crucial process in “confirmation of identity&quot;. Any family with a boy newly born will light up a lamp in the ancestral hall and invite the villagers to participate in the “lamp gathering&quot;, that is a Poon choi feast to celebrate the new male. After the ceremony was completed, the newborn male was officially recognized as a member of the village and had the right to inherit the property. As for the wedding tradition, the couple will raise a day to invite relatives to the Poon choi feast, which implies they are recognized the marriage. Also, after the spring and autumn ancestral worship, they reunited and ate Poon choi together.

The Poon choi is symbolized to &quot;unity&quot;. In the traditional Poon choi feast, people are not sent the invitation cards to the villagers. Only a red notice of the Poon Choi feast will be posted at the door of the village, their relatives and friends will naturally come to this festival. The villagers used the Poon choi feast to reach the whole village without any distinction, becoming an individual, united and harmonious. This symbolic meaning has been passed down to the present day, Poon choi is no longer limited in the walled village. It has been widely developed in Hong Kong, people will eat Poon choi during the Chinese New Year and other dinner party.

==Modern Poon choi==
===Reasons for popularity===
Poon choi meals are becoming more and more popular, one of the reasons being promotion by mass media, which widely publicise Poon choi events, such as the 1997 large-scale Poon choi banquet, and the Poon Choi banquet held by Heung Yee Kuk. Another reason is the economic downturn. Since Poon choi contains a large amount of many ingredients, Hong Kong people think the cost is lower than other types of restaurant meals. Poon choi also represents Hong Kong&#x27;s food culture and creativity. Although it is a traditional cuisine of Hong Kong walled villages the ingredients have changed over the past decades and become more diversified to suit peoples&#x27; varying palates and tastes.

Nowadays, Poon Choi stores are being launched in the urban districts. To maintain their competitiveness, these stores provide various conveniences and varieties to fulfill consumer needs and wants. They also invest the name Poon choi with meanings mostly symbolic of fortune as a gimmick to attract people.

===Location===
In the past, citizens had to take the time to visit the walled villages in order to enjoy Poon choi. It was of course also a valuable opportunity for them to escape the hustle and bustle of the city for a while.

Nowadays, eating Poon choi is not only limited to people living in or visiting walled villages. During festivals, urban citizens can now enjoy Poon choi from Chinese fast food restaurant, such as Café de Coral, Fairwood. Even when it is not festival time, residents can also purchase Poon choi in some specialised stores, like 八味香帝皇盆菜專門店, 洪運正宗盆菜, Poon choi has become a meal that people can enjoy anywhere and anytime.

In 2003, a Poon choi feast was held in the former Kai Tak airport. It had 660 tables, seating 12 people per table; together with the staff a total of nearly ten thousand people participated. This event broke the world record for the highest number of people gathered to eating Poon choi.

===Convenience===
Delivery service is provided so that the stores can ensure that all people, especially those living far away, can enjoy Poon choi and purchase it from a store. Delivery service is no doubt convenient when there are activities organised by local organisations or the government which feature a Poon choi feast. As these customers order bulk amounts, the stores give discounts or provide free materials, like tables, a gas stove, and tableware together with the Poon choi.

Ordering by phone or online enables customers to conveniently order Poon choi, since it eliminate the need for them to take time to visit the stores. The stores immediately start preparation once they have received the order, increasing efficiency.

The advertising leaflets from these stores usually offer customers a choice of big, medium and small amounts of Poon choi. With standard quantities and prices, people can easily determine how much they wish to order. Standardisation also reduces conflicts between the store and customers.

At present, stores use an aluminium foil cover to retain the heat of the wrapped Poon choi. Together with a large plastic bag with handles to bear the weight, this meal can easily be transported. No doubt these innovations ease the burden on customers in a hurry.

Different from traditional reheating methods, nowadays restaurants use a portable gas stove to warm the Poon choi before it is served. It can also be used at a table to maintain the warmth continuously and hence guarantee the quality and taste.

===Variety===
In the past, people ate Poon choi with rice only, but now they have more choices. They may choose other carbohydrates, like noodles or udon, depending on their eating habits.

Providing a variety of price categories allows people also to choose the diversity of delicacies which they can afford. Relatively high priced Poon choi includes luxury food such as abalones, shark fin, oyster, which people may select to gain honour by showing that they are generous and wealthy. Those who prefer a reasonable price can have a tasty meal with more common ingredients.

As an international hub, Hong Kong can provide diners with a variety of flavours. There is now available Japanese Poon choi, curry Poon choi, Western Poon choi, and vegetarian Poon choi, all in a bid to fulfill different needs and wants of customers, whether locals or tourists.

<text>Never Say Never Again is a 1983 spy film directed by Irvin Kershner. The film is based on the 1961 James Bond novel &quot;Thunderball&quot; by Ian Fleming, which in turn was based on an original story by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham, and Fleming. The novel had been previously adapted as the 1965 film &quot;Thunderball&quot;. &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; is the second and most recent &quot;James Bond&quot; film not to be produced by Eon Productions (the usual producer of the Bond series) but instead by Jack Schwartzman&#x27;s Taliafilm, and was distributed by Warner Bros. The film was executive produced by Kevin McClory, one of the original writers of the &quot;Thunderball&quot; storyline. McClory had retained the filming rights of the novel following a long legal battle dating from the 1960s.

Sean Connery played the role of Bond for the seventh and final time, marking his return to the character twelve years after &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971). The film&#x27;s title is a reference to Connery&#x27;s reported declaration in 1971 that he would &quot;never again&quot; play that role. As Connery was 52 at the time of filming, the script makes frequent reference to Bond as aging and past his prime – although Connery was three years younger than his replacement, Roger Moore. The storyline features Bond being reluctantly brought back into action to investigate the theft of two nuclear weapons by SPECTRE. Filming locations included France, Spain, the Bahamas and Elstree Studios in the United Kingdom.

&quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; was released by Warner Bros. on 7 October 1983, and opened to positive reviews. The film grossed $160 million at the box office, making it a commercial success, although it earned less overall than the Eon-produced &quot;Octopussy&quot;, released earlier the same year.

==Plot==
After MI6 agent James Bond fails a routine training exercise, his superior M orders him to a health clinic outside London to get back into shape. While there, Bond witnesses nurse Fatima Blush giving a sadomasochistic beating to a patient in a nearby room. The man&#x27;s face is bandaged and after Blush finishes her beating, he uses a machine which scans his eye. Bond is spotted by Blush, who sends assassin Lippe to kill him in the clinic gym. Bond kills Lippe in a fight which destroys a lot of the clinic&#x27;s furniture and equipment; M is forced to pay for the resulting damages and consequently suspends Bond from active duty.

Blush works for SPECTRE, a criminal organisation run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld; her charge is heroin-addicted United States Air Force pilot Jack Petachi. Petachi has undergone an operation on his right eye to make it match the retinal pattern of the US President, which he uses to circumvent security at RAF Station Swadley, an American military base in England. While doing so, he replaces the dummy warheads of two AGM-86B cruise missiles with live W80 nuclear warheads; SPECTRE then steals the warheads, intending to extort billions of dollars from NATO governments. Blush murders Petachi by causing his car to crash and explode, covering SPECTRE&#x27;s tracks.

Foreign Secretary Lord Ambrose orders a reluctant M to reactivate the double-0 section, and Bond is tasked with tracking down the missing weapons. Bond follows a lead to the Bahamas and finds Domino Petachi, Jack&#x27;s sister, and her wealthy lover Maximillian Largo, who is SPECTRE&#x27;s top agent.

When Largo&#x27;s yacht heads for Nice, France, Bond goes there and joins forces with his French contact Nicole, and his CIA counterpart, Felix Leiter. Bond goes to a health and beauty centre, posing as an employee. He gives a massage to Domino, who reveals that Largo is hosting an event at a casino that evening. At the charity event, Largo and Bond play a video game called &quot;Domination&quot;; the losing player of each turn receives electric shocks of increasing intensity in proportion to the amount wagered. After losing a few games, Bond wins, and while dancing with Domino, he informs her that Jack had been killed on Largo&#x27;s orders. Returning to his villa, Bond finds Nicole killed by Blush. After a chase on his Q-branch motorbike, Bond finds himself in an ambush and is captured by Blush. She admits to being impressed with him, and forces Bond to declare in writing that she is his &quot;Number One&quot; sexual partner. Bond distracts her with promises, then uses his Q-branch fountain pen gun to kill Blush with an explosive dart.

Bond and Leiter attempt to board Largo&#x27;s yacht, the &quot;Flying Saucer&quot;, in search of the missing nuclear warheads. Bond finds Domino and attempts to make Largo jealous by kissing her in front of a one-way mirror. Enraged, Largo traps Bond and takes him and Domino to Palmyra, Largo&#x27;s base of operations in North Africa. Largo punishes Domino for her betrayal by selling her to passing Arabs. Bond escapes from his prison and rescues her.

Domino and Bond reunite with Leiter on a U.S. Navy submarine. After the first warhead is found and defused in Washington, D.C., they track Largo to the Tears of Allah, a location below a desert oasis on the Ethiopian coast. Bond and Leiter infiltrate the underground facility and a gun battle erupts between Leiter&#x27;s team and Largo&#x27;s men in the temple. In the confusion, Largo makes a getaway with the second warhead. Bond catches and fights him underwater. Just as Largo tries to use a spear gun to shoot Bond, he is shot with a spear gun by Domino, taking revenge for Jack&#x27;s death. Bond then defuses the nuclear bomb underwater, saving the world. Bond retires from duty and returns to the Bahamas with Domino, vowing never again to be a secret agent although Domino doubts his sincerity.

==Production==
&quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; had its origins in the early 1960s, following the controversy over the 1961 &quot;Thunderball&quot; novel. Fleming had worked with independent producer Kevin McClory and scriptwriter Jack Whittingham on a script for a potential Bond film, to be called &quot;Longitude 78 West&quot;, which was subsequently abandoned because of the costs involved. Fleming, &quot;always reluctant to let a good idea lie idle&quot;, turned this into the novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;, for which he did not credit either McClory or Whittingham; McClory then took Fleming to the High Court in London for breach of copyright, and the matter was settled in 1963. After Eon Productions started producing the Bond films, it subsequently made a deal with McClory, who would produce &quot;Thunderball&quot;, and then not make any further version of the novel for a period of ten years, following the release of the Eon-produced version in 1965.

In the mid-1970s, McClory again started working on a second adaptation of &quot;Thunderball&quot; and, with the working title &quot;Warhead&quot;, he brought writer Len Deighton together with Sean Connery to work on a script. A lawsuit with Eon Productions ended in a ruling that McClory owned the sole rights to SPECTRE and Blofeld, forcing Eon to remove them from &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977). The script initially focused on SPECTRE shooting down aircraft over the Bermuda Triangle, before taking over Liberty Island and Ellis Island as staging areas for an invasion of New York City through the sewers under Wall Street. The script was purchased by Paramount Pictures in 1978. The script ran into difficulties, after accusations from Danjaq and United Artists that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based only on the novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;; once again, the project was delayed.

Towards the end of the 1970s, developments were reported on the project under the name &quot;James Bond of the Secret Service&quot;, but when producer Jack Schwartzman became involved in 1980, and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project, he decided against using Deighton&#x27;s script. The project returned to the original nuclear terrorism plot of the original &quot;Thunderball&quot;, in order to avoid another lawsuit from Danjaq, and after McClory saw Jimmy Carter mention the issue in a 1980 presidential debate with Ronald Reagan. Schwartzman brought on board scriptwriter Lorenzo Semple, Jr. to work on the screenplay. Schwartzman wanted him to make the screenplay &quot;somewhere in the middle&quot; between his campier projects such as &quot;Batman&quot;, and his more serious projects such as &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot;. Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the script, and asked Tom Mankiewicz, who had rewritten &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, to work on it; however, Mankiewicz declined, as he felt he was under a moral obligation to Albert R. Broccoli. Semple Jr. ultimately left the project, after Irvin Kershner was hired as director, and Schwartzman began cutting out the &quot;big numbers&quot; from his script to save on the budget. Connery then hired British television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts, despite much of the final shooting script being theirs. This was because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America. Clement and La Frenais continued rewriting during the production, often altering it from day to day.

The film underwent one final change in title: after Connery had finished filming &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, he had pledged that he would &quot;never again&quot; play Bond. Connery&#x27;s wife, Micheline, suggested the title &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, referring to her husband&#x27;s vow, and the producers acknowledged her contribution by listing on the end credits &quot;Title &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; by Micheline Connery&quot;. A final attempt by Fleming&#x27;s trustees to block the film was made in the High Court in London in the spring of 1983, but this was thrown out by the court and &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; was permitted to proceed.

===Cast and crew===
When producer Kevin McClory had first planned the film in 1964, he held initial talks with Richard Burton for the part of Bond, although the project came to nothing because of the legal issues involved. When the &quot;Warhead&quot; project was launched in the late 1970s, a number of actors were mentioned in the trade press, including Orson Welles for the part of Blofeld, Trevor Howard to play M and Richard Attenborough as director.

In 1978, the working title &quot;James Bond of the Secret Service&quot; was being used and Connery was in the frame once again, potentially going head-to-head with the next Eon Bond film, &quot;Moonraker&quot;. By 1980, with legal issues again causing the project to founder, Connery thought himself unlikely to play the role, as he stated in an interview in the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;: &quot;When I first worked on the script with Len I had no thought of actually being in the film.&quot; When producer Jack Schwartzman became involved, he asked Connery to play Bond; Connery agreed, negotiating a fee of $3 million ($ million in dollars), casting and script approval, and a percentage of the profits. Subsequent to Connery reprising the role, Semple altered the script to include several references to Bond&#x27;s advancing years – playing on Connery being 52 at the time of filming – and academic Jeremy Black has pointed out that there are other aspects of age and disillusionment in the film, such as the Shrubland&#x27;s porter referring to Bond&#x27;s car (&quot;They don&#x27;t make them like that anymore&quot;), the new M having no use for the 00 section and Q with his reduced budgets. Originally, Semple wanted to emphasize Bond&#x27;s age even further, writing the script to include him in semi-retirement working aboard a Scottish fishing trawler hunting Soviet Navy submarines in the North Sea. Connery&#x27;s casting was formally announced in March 1983.. He trained with Steven Seagal to help get in shape for the production.

For the main villain in the film, Maximillian Largo, Connery suggested Klaus Maria Brandauer, the lead of the 1981 Academy Award-winning Hungarian film &quot;Mephisto&quot;. Through the same route came Max von Sydow as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, although he still retained his Eon-originated white cat in the film. For the femme fatale, director Irvin Kershner selected former model and &quot;Playboy&quot; cover girl Barbara Carrera to play Fatima Blush – the name coming from one of the early scripts of &quot;Thunderball&quot;. Carrera said she modeled her performance on the Hindu goddess Kali, and to &quot;mix that in with a little bit of black widow and a little bit of praying mantis.&quot; Carrera&#x27;s performance as Fatima Blush earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, which she lost to Cher for her role in &quot;Silkwood&quot;.
Micheline Connery, Sean&#x27;s wife, had met up-and-coming actress Kim Basinger at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London and suggested her to Connery; he agreed after Dalila Di Lazzaro refused the Domino role. For the role of Felix Leiter, Connery spoke with Bernie Casey, saying that, as the Leiter role was never remembered by audiences, using a black Leiter might make him more memorable. Others cast included comedian Rowan Atkinson, who would later parody Bond in his role of Johnny English in 2003. Atkinson&#x27;s character was added by Clement and La Frenais after the production had already started, in order to provide the film with a comic relief. Edward Fox was cast as M in order to portray the character as a young technocrat in contrast to the older portrayal by Bernard Lee, and to parody the Thatcher ministry&#x27;s budget cuts to government services.

Connery wanted to persuade Richard Donner to direct the film, but after their meeting, Donner decided he disliked the script. Former Eon Productions&#x27; editor and director of &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, Peter R. Hunt, was approached to direct the film, but declined due to his previous work with Eon. Irvin Kershner, who had previously worked with Connery on &quot;A Fine Madness&quot; (1966), and had achieved success in 1980 with &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, was then hired. A number of the crew from the 1981 film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; were also appointed, including first assistant director David Tomblin, director of photography Douglas Slocombe, second unit director Mickey Moore and production designers Philip Harrison and Stephen Grimes.

===Filming===

Filming for &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; began on 27 September 1982 on the French Riviera for two months, before moving to Nassau, the Bahamas in mid-November, where filming took place at Clifton Pier, which was also one of the locations used in &quot;Thunderball&quot;. Largo&#x27;s Palmyran fortress was actually historic Fort Carré in Antibes. Largo&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Flying Saucer&quot;, was portrayed by the yacht &quot;Kingdom 5KR&quot;, then owned by Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi and called &quot;Nabila&quot;. The underwater scenes were filmed by Ricou Browning, who had coordinated the underwater scenes in the original &quot;Thunderball&quot;. Principal photography finished at Elstree Studios, where interior shots were filmed. Elstree also housed the Tears of Allah underwater cavern, which took three months to construct, while the Shrublands health spa was filmed at Luton Hoo. Most of the filming was completed in the spring of 1983, although there was some additional shooting during the summer of 1983.

Production on the film was troubled, with Connery taking on many of the production duties with assistant director David Tomblin. Director Irvin Kershner was critical of producer Jack Schwartzman, saying that, while he was a good businessman, &quot;he didn&#x27;t have the experience of a film producer&quot;. After the production ran out of money, Schwartzman had to fund further production out of his own pocket, and later admitted he had underestimated the amount the film would cost to make. There was tension on set between Schwartzman and Connery, who at times barely spoke to each other. Connery was unimpressed with the perceived lack of professionalism behind the scenes, and was on record as saying that the whole production was a &quot;bloody Mickey Mouse operation!&quot;

Steven Seagal, who was a martial arts instructor for this film, broke Connery&#x27;s wrist while training. On an episode of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, Connery revealed he did not know his wrist was broken until over a decade later.

===Music===
James Horner was both Kershner&#x27;s and Schwartzman&#x27;s first choice to compose the score, after they were impressed with his work on &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. Horner, who worked in London for most of the time, was unavailable, according to Kershner, though Schwartzman later claimed Sean Connery vetoed him. Frequent Bond composer John Barry was invited, but declined out of loyalty to Eon. The music for &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; was ultimately written by Michel Legrand, who composed a score similar to his work as a jazz pianist. The score has been criticised as &quot;anachronistic and misjudged&quot;, &quot;bizarrely intermittent&quot; and &quot;the most disappointing feature of the film&quot;. Legrand also wrote the main theme &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, which featured lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman — who had also worked with Legrand on the Academy Award-winning song &quot;The Windmills of Your Mind&quot; — and was performed by Lani Hall after Bonnie Tyler, who disliked the song, had reluctantly declined.

Phyllis Hyman also recorded a potential theme song, with music written by Stephen Forsyth and lyrics by Jim Ryan, but the song — an unsolicited submission — was passed over, given Legrand&#x27;s contractual obligations with the music.

===Legal substitutions===

Many of the elements of the Eon-produced Bond films were not present in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; for legal reasons. These included the gun barrel sequence, where a screen full of 007 symbols appeared instead, and similarly there was no &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; to use, although no effort was made to supply another tune. A pre-credits sequence was filmed but not used; instead, the film opens with the credits running over the top of the sequence of Bond on a training mission.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; opened on 7 October 1983 in 1,550 theatres, grossing an October record $10,958,157 over the four-day Columbus Day weekend, which was reported to be &quot;the best opening record of any James Bond film&quot; up to that point, surpassing &quot;Octopussy&quot;″s $8.9 million from June that year. The film had its UK premiere at the Warner West End cinema in London on 14 December 1983 with Prince Andrew in attendance before opening to the public in London the following day and across the UK on 16 December. It grossed $157,750 in its first 8 days in London from 8 screens in the West End, placing it at number one at the London box office. Worldwide, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; grossed $160 million, which was a solid return on the budget of $36 million. The film ultimately earned less than &quot;Octopussy&quot;, which grossed $187.5 million. It was the first James Bond film to be officially released in the Soviet Union, premiering in the summer of 1990 with a gala in Moscow.

Warner Bros. released &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; on VHS and Betamax in 1984, and on laserdisc in 1995. After Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer purchased the distribution rights in 1997 (see Legacy, below), the company has released the film on both VHS and DVD in 2001, and on Blu-ray in 2009.

===Contemporary reviews===
&quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; was broadly welcomed and praised by the critics: Ian Christie, writing in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, said that &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; was &quot;one of the better Bonds&quot;, finding the film &quot;superbly witty and entertaining, ... the dialogue is crisp and the fight scenes imaginative&quot;. Christie also thought that &quot;Connery has lost none of his charm and, if anything, is more appealing than ever as the stylish resolute hero&quot;. David Robinson, writing in &quot;The Times&quot; also concentrated on Connery, saying that: &quot;Connery ... is back, looking hardly a day older or thicker, and still outclassing every other exponent of the role, in the goodnatured throwaway with which he parries all the sex and violence on the way&quot;. For Robinson, the presence of Connery and Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximillian Largo &quot;very nearly make it all worthwhile.&quot; The reviewer for &quot;Time Out&quot; summed up &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; by saying: &quot;The action&#x27;s good, the photography excellent, the sets decent; but the real clincher is the fact that Bond is once more played by a man with the right stuff.&quot;

Derek Malcolm in &quot;The Guardian&quot; showed himself to be a fan of Connery&#x27;s Bond, saying the film contains &quot;the best Bond in the business&quot;, but nevertheless did not find &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; any more enjoyable than the recently released &quot;Octopussy&quot; (starring Roger Moore), or &quot;that either of them came very near to matching &quot;Dr. No&quot; or &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;&quot;. Malcolm&#x27;s main issue with the film was that he had a &quot;feeling that a constant struggle was going on between a desire to make a huge box-office success and the effort to make character as important as stunts&quot;. Malcolm summed up that &quot;the mix remains obstinately the same – up to scratch but not surpassing it&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Observer&quot;, Philip French noted that &quot;this curiously muted film ends up making no contribution of its own and inviting damaging comparisons with the original, hyper-confident &quot;Thunderball&quot;&quot;. French concluded that &quot;like an hour-glass full of damp sand, the picture moves with increasing slowness as it approaches a confused climax in the Persian Gulf&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, critic Jack Kroll thought the early part of the film was handled &quot;with wit and style&quot;, although he went on to say that the director was &quot;hamstrung by Lorenzo Semple&#x27;s script&quot;. Richard Schickel, writing in &quot;Time&quot;, praised the film and its cast. He wrote that Klaus Maria Brandauer&#x27;s character was &quot;played with silky, neurotic charm&quot;, while Barbara Carrera, playing Fatima Blush, &quot;deftly parodies all the fatal femmes who have slithered through Bond&#x27;s career&quot;. Schickel&#x27;s highest praise was saved for the return of Connery, observing &quot;it is good to see Connery&#x27;s grave stylishness in this role again. It makes Bond&#x27;s cynicism and opportunism seem the product of genuine worldliness (and world weariness) as opposed to Roger Moore&#x27;s mere twirpishness.&quot;

Janet Maslin, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was broadly praising of the film, saying she thought that &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; &quot;has noticeably more humor and character than the Bond films usually provide. It has a marvelous villain in Largo.&quot; Maslin also thought highly of Connery in the role, observing that &quot;in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, the formula is broadened to accommodate an older, seasoned man of much greater stature, and Mr. Connery expertly fills the bill.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Gary Arnold was fulsome in his praise, saying that &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; is &quot;one of the best James Bond adventure thrillers ever made&quot;, going on to say that &quot;this picture is likely to remain a cherished, savory example of commercial filmmaking at its most astute and accomplished.&quot; Arnold went further, saying that &quot;&quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; is the best acted Bond picture ever made, because it clearly surpasses any predecessors in the area of inventive and clever character delineation&quot;.

The critic for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Jay Scott, also praised the film, saying that &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; &quot;may be the only installment of the long-running series that has been helmed by a first-rate director.&quot; According to Scott, the director, with high-quality support cast, resulted in the &quot;classiest of all the Bonds&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film out of four stars, and wrote that &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, while consisting of a basic &quot;Bond plot&quot;, was different from other Bond films: &quot;For one thing, there&#x27;s more of a human element in the movie, and it comes from Klaus Maria Brandauer, as Largo.&quot; Ebert went on to add, &quot;there was never a Beatles reunion ... but here, by God, is Sean Connery as Sir James Bond. Good work, 007.&quot; Gene Siskel of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; also gave the film 3½ out of four stars, writing that the film was &quot;one of the best 007 adventures ever made&quot;.

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot;, and stated that &quot;&quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; is a complacent male sexist fantasy, where women can be only &quot;femmes fatales&quot; or passive victims.&quot;

===Retrospective reviews===
Because &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; is not an Eon-produced film, it has not been included in a number of subsequent reviews. Norman Wilner of MSN said that 1967&#x27;s &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; &quot;exist outside the &#x27;official&#x27; continuity, [and] are excluded from this list, just as they&#x27;re absent from MGM&#x27;s megabox. But take my word for it; they&#x27;re both pretty awful&quot;. Nevertheless, retrospective reviews of the film remain positive. Rotten Tomatoes sampled 55 critics and judged 71% of the reviews as positive, with a top critics&#x27; rating of 70%. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;While the rehashed story feels rather uninspired and unnecessary, the return of both Sean Connery and a more understated Bond make &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; a watchable retread.&quot; The score is still more positive than some of the Eon films, with Rotten Tomatoes ranking &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; 16th among all Bond films in 2008. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating generally favourable reviews. &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film three of a possible five stars, observing that &quot;Connery was perhaps wise to call it quits the first time round&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; a score of five out of ten, claiming that the film &quot;is more miss than hit&quot;. The reviewer also thought that the film was &quot;marred with too many clunky exposition scenes and not enough moments of Bond being Bond&quot;.

In 1995, Michael Sauter of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; as the ninth best Bond film to that point, after 17 films had been released. Sauter thought the film &quot;is successful only as a portrait of an over-the-hill superhero.&quot; He admitted that &quot;even past his prime, Connery proves that nobody does it better&quot;. James Berardinelli, in his review of &quot; Never Say Never Again&quot;, thinks the re-writing of the &quot;Thunderball&quot; story has led to a film which has &quot;a hokey, jokey feel, [it] is possibly the worst-written Bond script of all&quot;. Berardinelli concludes that &quot;it&#x27;s a major disappointment that, having lured back the original 007, the film makers couldn&#x27;t offer him something better than this drawn-out, hackneyed story.&quot; Critic Danny Peary wrote that &quot;it was great to see Sean Connery return as James Bond after a dozen years&quot;. He also thought the supporting cast was good, saying that Klaus Maria Brandauer&#x27;s Largo was &quot;neurotic, vulnerable ... one of the most complex of Bond&#x27;s foes&quot; and that Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger &quot;make lasting impressions.&quot; Peary also wrote that the &quot;film is exotic, well acted, and stylishly directed ... It would be one of the best Bond films if the finale weren&#x27;t disappointing. When will filmmakers realize that underwater fight scenes don&#x27;t work because viewers usually can&#x27;t tell the hero and villain apart and they know doubles are being used?&quot;

Jim Smith and Stephen Lavington, in their 2002 retrospective &quot;Bond Films&quot;, lament: &quot;The production chaos is visible on screen, with frequently mediocre editing, direction, stunt work and photography all emerging from the restricted budget. [...] At the time, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; got away with it, thanks to public and critical pleasure at seeing Connery again. Now it is dated, slow and (worst of all) looks cheap, faring badly when compared to even the poorest of the Eon films.&quot;

==Legacy==
Originally, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; was intended to start a series of Bond films produced by Schwartzman and starring Connery as James Bond, with McClory announcing the next planned film, &quot;S.P.E.C.T.R.E&quot;, in a February 1984 issue of &quot;Screen International&quot;. When Connery announced that he would not reprise his role as Bond in another film produced by Schwartzman three weeks before the deadline to purchase the rights to another film for $5 million, Schwartzman said that he was unlikely to make another film without a deal from MGM/UA and Danjaq.

In the 1990s, McClory announced plans to make another adaptation of the &quot;Thunderball&quot; story starring Timothy Dalton entitled &quot;Warhead 2000 AD&quot;, but the film was eventually scrapped. In 1997, Sony Pictures acquired McClory&#x27;s rights for an undisclosed amount, and subsequently announced that it intended to make a series of Bond films, as the company also held the rights to &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. This move prompted a round of litigation from MGM, which was settled out of court, forcing Sony to give up all claims on Bond; McClory still claimed he would proceed with another Bond film, and continued his case against MGM and Danjaq; on 27 August 2001, the court rejected McClory&#x27;s suit. McClory died in 2006; MGM&#x27;s acquisition of the rights to &quot;Casino Royale&quot; finally allowed Eon Productions to make a serious, non-satirical film adaptation of that novel the same year, with Daniel Craig as James Bond. Ultimately, in 2013, McClory&#x27;s heirs sold the &quot;Thunderball&quot; rights to Eon, allowing the company to reintroduce Blofeld to the Eon series in the film &quot;Spectre&quot;.

On 4 December 1997, MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights to &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; from Schwartzman&#x27;s company Taliafilm. The company has since handled the release of both the DVD and Blu-ray editions of the film.

<doc id="490105" wikidata="Q1026887" url="?curid=490105" title="Pulpwood">
<text>Pulpwood can be defined as timber that is ground and processed into a fibrous pulp. It is a versatile natural resource commonly used for paper-making but also made into low-grade wood and used for chips, energy, pellets, and engineered products.

Pulpwood can be derived from most types of trees. Categorizing trees into hardwood and softwood is the easiest way to characterize types of paper produced from pulpwood.

Hardwoods are raw material that are preferred for pulp used in printing papers. It has small dimensions in its fibres, which can be useful for small-scale uniformity, opacity, and surface smoothness, all important for printing paper.

Softwoods are the preferred raw material for strong papers, due to the length and slimness of the fibres. Low-density softwoods, such as firs with thin-walled fibres are preferred for papers with high demands for bonding-related strength characteristics. Some of these characteristics include tensile, burst, and surface strength.

Trees raised specifically for pulp production account for 15% of world pulp production, while old growth forests account for 9% and second/third plus generation forests account for the balance.

== Hardwood applications ==
Hardwood has anatomical structural differences to softwood, which influences physical properties, durability, workability, and bonding. Different types of cells complete the three main tasks in hardwoods compared to softwoods. The main tasks include stabilization, water conduit, and storage. 

Hardwood applications can be sectioned into four areas:

* Solid wood products
* Wood-based materials
* Use after modification
* Supplemental services

=== Solid wood products ===
Hardwoods (such as oak) are the preferred raw material for joists, roof structures and timber frames. The use of solid hardwoods has decreased during the last couple centuries, most likely due to the development of wood-based materials that allow for larger constructions not limited to the size of trees.

Trees of any size can be used for pulpwood, but trees that are 5-9 inches in diameter at breast height are normally used. These trees are cut after a saw timber harvest or as a separate operation to thin a crowded stand. Low-quality stands are completely harvested for pulpwood to regenerate the forest to more desirable species, as well as larger trees with disease or defects that prevent their use for lumber.

Additional fields of application include playgrounds, wood-facings, railway sleepers, bridges, and more. Furniture is another application of hardwood. Furniture made of pure solid wood is relatively rare. Most parts of furniture such as table boards, shelves or cabinet doors belong to wood-based materials because of their glued components. Solid wood can be used for chairs, tables, beds, upholstery frames, sideboards, cabinets, bathtubs, and more.

Hardwood is also used for interior work, such as parquet flooring, doors, and windows. Hardwood is especially preferred for parquet flooring. Tree species in darker colours are commonly used to give the flooring a &quot;used look,&quot; for visual appeal. Solid wood is used for front doors and windows, while internal doors are mainly made of wood-based panels.

=== Wood-based materials ===
Wood-based materials can be separated into a few different types. These include solid wood, ply, particle, and fibre materials. Solid wood materials are used as beam or panels. Typical tree species used for solid wood materials include beech, oak, birch, alder and chestnut. Hardwoods are commonly used for nonstructural products such as plywood.

Structural products such as cross laminated timber, are mainly composed of softwoods. Particle materials are ideal to use low-rate timber assortments and saw mill waste. Types of particle materials include particle board, mineral-bonded wood composites, oriented strand board, laminated strand lumber, and oriented strand lumber.

Fibre materials include fibreboards, insulating fibreboards, wood particle mouldings and wood plastic composites. The quality and processing of fibreboards and insulating fibreboards are influenced by the fibre percentage, the geometrical structural of the fibre, and the specific chemical composition of wood. The fibres of hardwoods are short, smooth and thin, and are suited for the dry production process because they do not mat. Ironically, hardwoods are barely used for fibreboards and insulating fibreboards.

=== Use after modification ===
The purposes of wood modification are dimensional stabilization and resistance increase. Wood can be modified in a multitude of ways, including but not limited to: chemical modification, heat treatment, ammonia treatment, electrodialysis, and more.

Chemical modification, heat treatment, and impregnation (with salts, metals, monomers and polymers) are the most used methods.

=== Supplemental services ===
Hardwood can be used in other ways outside of physical wood structures and paper. It can be used as a substance, such as through food production. The sawdust of beech and oak is used to grow edible mushrooms. Oak, beech and maple are used to cure meat or fish, while oak staves, chips and powder add aroma to wine. The sawdust of oak and robinia can be used to filter elements such as copper, nickel, zinc and cadmium. It can also be added to plastics. 60% of linoleum flooring consists of sawdust.

Wood can also be used as an energy source, with sawmill waste and low-rate timber. Combustion, wood gasification, and production of bioethanol are the three main ways hardwood is used for energy.

Combustion: split billets, chips and wood pellets. High-density wood species burn down slower, and the heat value depends on wood moisture content. Burning rate decreases with increasing density.

Wood gasification (synthetic natural gas and biomass to liquid): synthesis gas production is done by wood smouldering.

Bioethanol: start off by the splitting of cellulose and hemicelluloses in sugar by enzymes and acids, then the fermentation of the sugar with the aid of microorganisms. Lastly, the distillation and dewatering creates the bioethanol.

== Softwood applications ==
Softwoods come from gymnosperm trees that consists of needles and cones. When a sample of softwood is observed under a microscope, they appear to have no (visible) pores because of the presence of tracheids. Tracheids are a primitive element of xylem (fluid-conducting tissues). They consist of a single elongated cell and a secondary cellulosic wall containing a thick layer of lignin. Medullary rays and tracheids transport water and produce sap. Approximately 80% of timber comes from softwood, such as cedar trees, Douglas fir, juniper, pine, and many more.

Although they are called &#x27;softwood,&#x27; trees, they are not actually softer (in texture) in comparison to hardwood trees. The term just refers to wood that comes from gymnosperms or conifers. Some hardwood trees are even softer than specific softwood tree species.

Softwoods are used in wood manufacturing as well, and are sometimes preferred over hardwoods depending on the product being constructed. An important characteristic that softwoods have that make them a suitable pulpwood to build with, is that they can easily absorb any kind of finish. They can become very resistant and last for a long time (centuries). Softwoods tend to be cheaper than hardwood due to their growth rate and development being faster. They are versatile, strong, and can be managed easily. Some of the biggest softwood forests can be found in Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia.

=== Types of softwoods ===
Cedarwood: One of the most resistance and durable softwoods. Cedarwood is originally from the Mediterranean area and is highly resistant to water, bacteria, fungi, and insects. Their impressive resistance ability comes from the woods natural scent, which is sweet and pleasant. Its insect-repellent properties make cedar-wood ideal for the manufacturing of internal furniture, such as chests, boxes, and closets. The woods insulating properties make it suitable to be used for roofing material. Western Red Cedar is used to make musical instruments such as guitars and violins, due to its colour and resistance to warping and cracking.

Pinewood: Mostly found in the Northern Hemisphere, this type of wood is mainly used for domestic applications. It is resistance to shrinkage, swelling, and warping. It is used for outdoor wooden projects, such as decks. A disadvantage of pinewood is that over time, the wood could splinter, and items constructed from the specific type of pinewood used for making outdoor furniture/decks should be checked annually to prevent any risks to the people using them.

Firwood: This type of wood comes from Douglas Fir trees, and can be found in North America, Europe, North Africa, and Asia. It is strong and resistant to abrasion, and can be used for a diverse array of products. Some include furniture, doors, windows, and larger-scale items such as bridge parts, log homes, and commercial buildings. It can also be used for boat-building and aircraft construction, due to its sturdy and stable nature.

Redwood: This is mainly used for outdoor applications because of its resistance to weather conditions, insects, and rot. As a result of these characteristics, it is a premium building wood. It is another type of wood used to build decks, because of its natural strength, stability, and lifespan (can last a long time).

== Products ==
Pulpwood can be used for a multitude of different uses, some of them already mentioned above. Some of the main products it is used for is listed below.

=== Paper ===

Paper production is the most common and main use for pulpwood. Paper can be produced from both hardwood and softwood trees, and each species for both types of trees have specific and unique properties that make the type of paper and other products produced differ. The short fibres of hardwoods trees produce smoother and more uniform paper, like printing paper. Softwood trees have longer fibres that produce industrial papers like newsprint.

Wood is broken down mechanically or chemically. After the breakdown process, fibres (composed of two kinds of cellulose) and lignin are leftover. Lignin is the glue or cement that holds the fibres in wood together. Simply putting it, wood pulp is a large amount of individual wood fibres with the lignin removed. Wood pulp is naturally between dark brown to light grey in colour. Dark brown wood pulp is used for paper bags and boxes, and bleaching the pulp produces higher grades of paper (among other products).

==== Chemical Wood Pulp ====
The chemical method of breaking down wood pulp to make paper is more commonly used and energy efficient compared to the mechanical method. In the chemical method, the wood chips are &#x27;cooked&#x27; in large tanks. The tanks are called digesters, and are like pressure cookers. Chemicals, referred to as &#x27;cooking liquor&#x27; help break down wood chips into a mass of fibres. The chemicals used are: 1) sulfite salts with an excess of sulfur dioxide and 2) caustic soda and sodium sulfide (kraft process). The lignin of the wood is made soluble, resulting in fibre separation into whole fibres. Further purification by bleaching can also be done. Purifying the pulp by bleaching and by alkaline extraction is called alpha or dissolving pulp. This type of pulp is used for speciality papers, for rayon and cellulose film production, and for cellulose derivatives (nitrate and acetate.) 

==== Mechanical Pulp ====
With mechanical pulping, machines are used to grind wood chips into pulp, creating a pulp that retains most of its lignin. Due to the short fibres created by this process, the resulting paper is mostly used for newspapers, phone books, and other low-strength paper. Mechanical pulp can also be referred to as ground-wood pulp, and the grinding process starts by subjecting wood to an abrading action, either by pressing the wood against a revolving grinding stone or by passing chips through a mill.

Pulp grinders are usually powered by electric motors and automatically loaded. Most ground-wood pulp flows directly to an adjacent paper mill for use as stock. It is then formed into a sheet on a cylindrical vacuum filter, then pressed in a hydraulic press to a moisture content of about 50 percent. The pressed sheets result in the formation of bales.

=== Pellets ===
Pulpwood also produces wood pellets, which can be used for heating homes and electricity production. They can be formed by the grinding of biomass (in the form of unused tree tops), sawdust, or even entire trees, then compressed into small pellets to be stored, transported, and fed into boilers and furnaces. Softwood species are preferred to make wood pellets due to the resin content required to bind the particles together.

=== Firewood ===
Firewood is the oldest use of pulpwood. Poor quality trees are put to better use and burned as a crude energy source as heat, light and cooking fuels. Coppicing refers to the ancient and traditional woodland management technique that involves cutting trees at their base and creating a stool for new shoots to grow. During the stone age, coppicing was done to manage forests for the production of firewood fuels.

=== Biofuel ===
Biofuels refer to fuels derived from plant materials or manure. They are currently under debate whether they are a safe and environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels as a source of energy. The carbon in plants is produced by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere via photosynthesis, and burning biofuels/plant-derived fuels puts the same amount of CO2 back into the atmosphere.

Generating heat and electricity from wood-fuel is a multi step process.

# It starts off by drying the wood, followed by pyrolysis to produce gasses.
# Next, the gasses are purified and burnt to generate electricity 

The ash created during the pyrolysis process contains nutrients that are used as plant fertilizer, but it could also contain contaminants from the soils of the trees origin site.

Some of the potential sources of wood-fuel include early thinnings from commercial plantations, the residues from timber harvesting and arboricultural activities, coppicing and sawmills.

==Sources==

===Logging===
Early pulpwood operations were based on logging operations for sawn lumber. Transporting the log to the saw mill was a major problem, and using water to transport the lumber proved to be a successful tactic. Water transportation was the cheapest and only link between the mill and the tree site. As the search for accessible trees continued towards the sources of rivers, driving capacity was improved by various forms of river improvement. Dams were one of the methods of river improvement, as well as the use of impounded water to increase the natural flow of the river.

In the logging of mixed forest stands, the better trees are usually used for sawlogs for lumber production, while the inferior trees and components are harvested for pulpwood production. Pulpwood usually derives from four types of woody materials in a mixed logging operation:
* Open-grown trees, that are heavily branched low on the trunk, and so make poor sawlogs.
* Dead or diseased trees.
* Tops cut from trees harvested for sawlogs (branches are rarely used since they contain little usable wood after the bark has been removed).
* Small trees, too small to harvest for sawlogs.

Natural forest stands may also be harvested solely for pulpwood where, for various reasons, the value of the trees as sawlogs is low. This may be due to the predominant species in the forest stand (for example, some aspen forests in northern North America), or to the relative proximity of the nearest sawmill or pulp mill.

===Plantations===
To help feed pulp and paper mills, vast monocultures of conifers eucalyptus, acacia, and other species are being established both in the North and South, where fast tree growth, inexpensive land and labour, and lavish subsidies combine to make wood cheaper. As exotic trees invade native woodlands, grasslands, farmlands and pastures, consequences in most countries include impoverishment, environmental degradation, and rural strife.

Plantations are full of trees similar to forests, but they differ greatly. A forest is a complex, self-regenerating system, consisting of soil, water, microclimates, energy, a diverse ecosystem with a wide variety of plants and animals in mutual relation. In contrast, a commercial plantation is a cultivated area whose species and structure have been simplified dramatically to produce only a few goods, such as lumber, fuel, resin, oil or fruit. The trees in a plantation have a small range of species and ages, and require extensive and consistent human intervention.

Pulpwood is also harvested from tree farms established for the specific purpose of growing pulpwood, with little or minimal sawlog production. Monoculture of species intended specifically for pulpwood include loblolly and slash pines in the southern USA; various species of eucalyptus (most commonly &quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus grandis&quot;) in Latin America, Iberian Peninsula, Australia, south-east Asia.

Plantations normally replace crops, grasslands, or scrub forests. Since they are used for commercial necessities, they are established on healthy soil, with their objective being short cycles of rapid growth that requires a certain level of fertility and water supply. Therefore, they tend to occupy areas already being used by local people.

===Salvage cuttings===
Salvage cuts after forest fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, or other natural disasters are often used for pulpwood. An alternative source of wood for use in Kraft pulping is recovered lumber from demolition, industrial processing of wood and wooden pallets.

Salvage cutting is the removal of trees that have been killed or damaged by insects, disease, wind, ice, snow, volcanic activity, or wildfire. The purpose of salvage cutting is to recover the economic value of trees before they decay. Dead trees decay quickly, and the timing of salvage cutting is crucial to capture as much economic value as possible. Post-fire salvage cutting helps manage fuels and future fire behaviour, as long as logging slash is treated after the harvest.

===Wood residuals===
Saw residuals are used as pulpwood. The most important of these are the side cuttings from lumber edger. This gives wood with almost only sapwood and no heartwood. The sapwood is easier to pulp. due to a more open structure and less content of extractive than the heartwood. The fibre length of sapwood is generally longer than the fibre length of heartwood. The sapwood is also normally lighter and that is an advantage when producing mechanical pulp as less bleaching of wood pulp is needed.

Sawdust gives very short fibres that are suitable as part of the furnish for paper tissue and writing papers. Saw blades have become thinner and with smaller teeth making the sawdust too small as fibre source.

===Chemical composition of some pulpwoods===
==Alternative uses==
Sugar cane byproducts and bamboo are used in the commercial production of toilet paper.

Wood pulp has many modern-day uses other than paper-making and the other applications mentioned in the &quot;Softwood Applications,&quot; and &quot;Hardwood Applications&quot; sections. Their uses can range from hygiene products to innovation medical products.

Wood can also be used as raw material for new bio-products, such an environmentally friendly textile manufacturing technologies. There are a few ways pulpwood is being used to develop technologies that consume less energy and fewer chemicals.

# Pulp can be processed mechanically to produce tiny micro-fibrillated cellulose, which can be used to make fibres without any solvents. 
# Pulp is dissolved in an ionic fluid, then pressed to form thin strands that can be used to make yarn 
# Fibres are first separated, then the material becomes a liquid and converted into textile fibres.

<text>The Laramie Mountains are a range of moderately high peaks on the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the U.S states of Wyoming and Colorado. The range is the northernmost extension of the line of the ranges along the eastern side of the Rockies, and in particular of the higher peaks of the Front Range directly to the south. North of the range, the gap between the Laramie range and the Bighorn Mountains provided the route for historical trails, such as the Oregon Trail, the Mormon Trail, and the Pony Express.

The Laramie Mountains begin in northern Colorado and extend discontinuously into southeastern Wyoming between Cheyenne and Laramie and northward to Casper. (By some definitions the Laramies are only in Wyoming.) They are named after the Laramie River, which cuts through the range from southwest to northeast and joins the North Platte River east of the range in eastern Wyoming. The mountains in turn give their name to the Laramide orogeny, the uplift of the North American Plate approximately 70 million years ago that created the present Rocky Mountains.

The highest portions of the Laramie mountains are mostly in public ownership, forming part of the Medicine Bow-Routt and Roosevelt National Forests.

== Geography ==

The mountains consist of a series of Precambrian Sherman granite monadnocks rising above a broad erosion surface that form extensive unwooded parks whose surfaces are generally at about above sea level. The high peaks of the range, which are much lower than those commonly associated with the Rocky Mountains, rise abruptly above the surrounding peneplain to altitudes between and above sea level, with the exceptions of Laramie Peak in Wyoming which tops out at and South Bald Mountain in Colorado rising to . The granitic soils were formed from the erosion of the surrounding monadnocks and have an effective depth of less than .
Three principal life zones are represented in the Laramies: Upper Sonoran, Transition and Canadian. Some early sources indicated that the Hudsonian Zone occurs on Laramie Peak but there is nothing distinctive about either the flora or fauna on the top of this peak, for it consists of nothing but a large granite outcrop. On the eastern and north eastern slopes of the range the prairie/mountain transition is very gentle at the south end (between Cheyenne and Laramie) and much more abrupt and broken farther north. The elevation is lowest, about (1370 m), along the North Platte River. On the western slopes the total relief is much less, as the floors of the three intermontane basins that border the Laramies on this side (Shirley, Hanna and Laramie basins) rarely drop below . An extensive high plain and semi-desert extends from the Laramie Mountains south west as far as the Shirley Mountains. The Laramie Basin separates the Laramie Mountains from the Medicine Bow Mountains to the south and west, and its floor is above except for a few depressions and blowouts (such as Cooper Lake).

The Laramie Mountains are bisected by the Laramie River, which cuts a canyon through the mountains roughly due west of Wheatland, and then continues its generally eastward course to join the North Platte River near the town of Fort Laramie. The division marks the southern end of the continuous coniferous forest in the range, and separates the range into two parts. The southern part is generally drier and much more open, with little or no forest except for the southern end at Pole Mountain and surrounding area, where the interesting granite outcrops at Vedauwoo provide climbing practice and grand picnic scenery.

The range is prominently visible from Interstate 25 between Casper and Cheyenne. Interstate 80 and the Union Pacific Railroad cross the range between Cheyenne and Laramie on an outlying ramp of the High Plains called the &quot;Gangplank&quot;.

<text>The Gotha G.V was a heavy bomber used by the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; (Imperial German Air Service) during World War I. Designed for long-range service and built by Gothaer Waggonfabrik AG, the Gotha G.V was used principally as a night bomber.

== Development ==

Operational use of the Gotha G.IV demonstrated that the incorporation of the fuel tanks into the engine nacelles was a mistake. In a crash landing the tanks could rupture and spill fuel onto the hot engines. This posed a serious problem because landing accidents caused 75% of operational losses. In response Gothaer produced the G.V, which housed its fuel tanks inside the fuselage. The smaller engine nacelles were mounted on struts above the lower wing.

The Gotha G.V pilot seat was offset to port, with the fuel tanks immediately behind. This blocked the connecting walkway that previously on earlier machines allowed crew members to move between the three gun stations. All bombs were carried externally in this model.

The base variant of G.V offered no performance improvement over the G.IV. The G.V was up to 450 kg (990 lb) heavier than the G.IV due to additional equipment and the use of insufficiently seasoned timber. The Mercedes D.IVa engines could not produce the rated 190 kW (260 hp) due to inferior quality of fuel.

===Gotha tunnel===
The Gotha included an important innovation in the form of a &quot;gun tunnel&quot;, whereby the underside of the rear fuselage was arched, early versions allowing placement of a rearward-facing machine gun, protecting against attack from below, removing the blind spot. Later versions expanded the tunnel to remove the lower gun, providing a slot in the upper fuselage that allowed the rear gunner to remain stationary.

==Operational history==
The G.V entered service in August 1917. For the performance reasons aforementioned, it generally could not operate at altitudes as high as the G.IV.

==Variants==

===G.Va===
In February 1918, Gothaer tested a compound tail unit with biplane horizontal stabilizers and twin rudders. The new tail unit, known as the &quot;Kastensteuerung&quot;, improved the aircraft&#x27;s marginal directional control on one engine. The resulting G.Va subvariant incorporated the new tail, as well as a slightly shorter forward fuselage with an auxiliary nose landing gear. All 25 G.Va aircraft were delivered to &quot;Bogohl&quot; 3, the new designation for the former &quot;Kagohl&quot; 3.

===G.Vb===
Carried an increased payload compared to the earlier G.Va, and operated at a maximum takeoff weight of 4,550 kg (10,030 lb). To reduce the danger of flipping over during landing, Gothaer introduced the &quot;Stossfahrgestell&quot; (&quot;shock landing gear&quot;), a tandem two-bogie main landing gear. The &quot;Stossfahrgestell&quot; proved so good that it was fitted to all G.Vs in &quot;Bogohl&quot; 3. Some G.Vb aircraft also had Flettner servo tabs on the ailerons to reduce control forces.

&quot;Idflieg&quot; ordered 80 G.Vb aircraft, the first being delivered to &quot;Bogohl&quot; 3 in June 1918. By the Armistice, all 80 aircraft were built but the last batch did not reach the front and was delivered direct to the Allied special commission.

<text>The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO) is a reference work describing the state of opening theory in chess, originally published in five volumes from 1974 to 1979 by the Yugoslavian company Šahovski Informator (Chess Informant). It is currently undergoing its fifth edition. &quot;ECO&quot; may also refer to the opening classification system used by the encyclopedia.
==Overview==
Both &quot;ECO&quot; and &quot;Chess Informant&quot; are published by the Belgrade-based company Šahovski Informator. The moves are taken from thousands of master games and from published analysis in &quot;Informant&quot; and compiled by the editors, most of whom are grandmasters, who select the lines which they consider most relevant or critical. The chief editor since the first edition has been Aleksandar Matanović (1930-2023). The openings are provided in an &quot;ECO&quot; table that concisely presents the opening lines considered most critical by the editors. &quot;ECO&quot; covers the openings in more detail than rival single volume publications such as &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; and &quot;Nunn&#x27;s Chess Openings&quot;, but in less detail than specialized opening books.

The books are intended for an international audience and contain only a small amount of text, which is in several languages. The bulk of the content consists of diagrams of positions and chess moves, annotated with symbols, many of them developed by Chess Informant. Chess Informant pioneered the use of Figurine Algebraic Notation to avoid the use of initials for the names of the pieces, which vary between languages.

Instead of the traditional names for the openings, &quot;ECO&quot; has developed a coding system that has also been adopted by other chess publications. There are five main categories, &quot;A&quot; to &quot;E&quot;, corresponding to the five volumes of the earlier editions, each of which is further subdivided into 100 subcategories, for a total of 500 codes. The term &quot;ECO&quot; is often used as a shorthand for this coding system. &quot;ECO&quot; code is a registered trademark of Chess Informant.

It is the shortest and most sexually explicit of Fleming&#x27;s novels, as well as the only Bond novel told in the first person. Its narrator is a young Canadian woman, Viv Michel. Bond himself does not appear until two-thirds of the way through the book, arriving at precisely the right moment to save Viv from being raped and murdered by two criminals. Fleming wrote a prologue to the novel giving the character Viv credit as a co-author.

The story uses a recurring motif of Saint George against the dragon, and contains themes of power, and the moral ambiguity between those acting with good and evil intent. As the narrator who tells her own backstory and expresses her emotions and motives, Viv has been described as the best realised and most rounded female character in the Bond canon. The reviewers were largely negative, with some expressing a desire for a return to the structure and form of the previous Bond novels. In a letter to his editor after the reviews had been published, Fleming reflected that &quot;the experiment has obviously gone very much awry&quot;.

Following the negative reactions of critics, Fleming attempted to suppress elements of the novel: he blocked a paperback edition in the United Kingdom and, when he sold the film rights to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, they were permitted to use the title but none of the plot of the book. In the 1977 film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, the tenth in the Eon Productions series, only the title and the character of one of the villains, Jaws, is taken from in the book. The film was the third to star Roger Moore as Bond. A heavily adapted version of &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; appeared in &quot;The Daily Express&quot; newspaper in daily comic strip format between 1967 and 1968; a British paperback edition of the novel was published after Fleming&#x27;s death.

==Plot summary==
Fleming structured the novel in three sections—&quot;Me&quot;, &quot;Them&quot; and &quot;Him&quot;—to describe the phases of the story. In the prologue he described the origin of the manuscript:

I found what follows lying on my desk one morning. As you will see, it appears to be the first-person story of a young woman, evidently beautiful and not unskilled in the arts of love. According to her story, she appears to have been involved, both perilously and romantically, with the same James Bond whose secret service exploits I myself have written from time to time. With the manuscript was a note signed &quot;Vivienne Michel&quot; assuring me that what she had written was &quot;purest truth and from the depths of her heart&quot;. I was interested in this view of James Bond, through the wrong end of the telescope so to speak, and after obtaining clearance for certain minor infringements of the Official Secrets Act I have much pleasure in sponsoring its publication.

Me&lt;br&gt;
Vivienne &quot;Viv&quot; Michel, a young Canadian woman, narrates her own story, detailing her past love affairs. The first was with Derek Mallaby: the couple had sex in a field after being thrown out of a cinema in Windsor for indecent exposure. Their physical relationship ended that night, and Viv was subsequently rejected when Mallaby sent her a letter from Oxford University, where he was studying, saying he was forcibly engaged to someone else by his parents. Viv&#x27;s second love affair was with her German employer, Kurt Rainer, by whom she eventually became pregnant. She informed Rainer and he paid for her to go to Switzerland to have an abortion, telling her that their affair was over. After the procedure, Viv returned to her native Canada and started on a journey through North America. She stopped in the Adirondack Mountains to work at the Dreamy Pines motel, in the employ of the managers Jed and Mildred Phancey.

Them&lt;br&gt;
At the end of the vacation season, the Phanceys entrust Viv with looking after the motel for the night before the owner, Mr. Sanguinetti, can arrive to take inventory and close it up for the winter. Two mobsters, &quot;Sluggsy&quot; Morant and the steel-toothed Sol &quot;Horror&quot; Horowitz, both of whom work for Sanguinetti, arrive and say they are there to look over the motel for insurance purposes. The two have been hired by Sanguinetti to burn down the motel so that he can make a fraudulent insurance claim. The blame for the fire would fall on Viv, who was to perish in the incident. The men immediately start harassing Viv, making crude passes and aggressively asking her to dance; when she says she does not want to, they attack her, intending to rape her, when the door buzzer interrupts them.

Him&lt;br&gt;
The British secret service agent James Bond appears at the door asking for a room, having had a flat tyre while passing. Bond soon realises that Horror and Sluggsy are mobsters and that Viv is in danger. Bond pressures the gangsters into providing him a room. Bond tells Viv that he is in America in the wake of Operation Thunderball and had been detailed to protect a Russian nuclear expert who defected to the West. That night Sluggsy and Horror set fire to the motel and attempt to kill Bond and Viv. A gun battle ensues and, during their escape, Horror and Sluggsy&#x27;s car crashes into a lake. Bond and Viv retire to bed, but Sluggsy is still alive and makes a further attempt to kill them, before Bond shoots and kills him.

Viv wakes to find Bond gone, leaving a note in which he promises to send her police assistance and which he concludes by telling her not to dwell too much on the ugly events through which she has just lived. As Viv finishes reading the note, a large police detachment arrives. After taking her statement, the officer in charge of the detail reiterates Bond&#x27;s advice, but also warns Viv that all men involved in violent crime and espionage, regardless of which side they are on—including Bond himself—are dangerous and that Viv should avoid them. Viv reflects on this as she drives off at the end of the book, continuing her tour of America; despite the officer&#x27;s warning, she still devotes her thoughts to Bond.

==Background and writing history==
By January 1961 the author Ian Fleming had published eight books in the preceding eight years: seven novels and a collection of short stories. A ninth book, &quot;Thunderball&quot;, was being edited and prepared for production; it was released at the end of March 1961. Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica in January to write &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in &quot;Books and Bookmen&quot; magazine: &quot;I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour&#x27;s work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.&quot; He found writing &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; easier than any of his other books.

Fleming returned to London in March that year with a 113-page typescript, the shortest of any of the Bond books. Few alterations were made to the story before publication. After the book was published he wrote to Michael Howard, his editor at Jonathan Cape, to explain why he had changed his approach:

I had become increasingly surprised to find that my thrillers, which were designed for an adult audience, were being read in schools, and that young people were making a hero out of James Bond ... So it crossed my mind to write a cautionary tale about Bond, to put the record straight in the minds particularly of younger readers.&lt;br&gt;
It was impossible to do this in my usual narrative style and I therefore invented the fiction of a heroine through whom I could examine Bond from the other end of the gun barrel, so to speak. This I did by telling the story in her own words of her upbringing and love life, which consisted of two incidents, both of which were of a strongly cautionary nature.

Fleming found writing the Bond novels increasingly arduous and had thoughts of finishing the series by killing Bond in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, but changed his mind while writing. The novel is described by Fleming&#x27;s biographer Andrew Lycett as Fleming&#x27;s &quot;most sleazy and violent story ever&quot;. This, writes Lycett, may have been a reflection of Fleming&#x27;s state of mind at the time, particularly his ongoing marital difficulties: he was having an affair with his neighbour on Jamaica, Blanche Blackwell, and his wife, Ann was in a relationship with Hugh Gaitskell, the Leader of the British Labour Party. Fleming also had a strained professional relationship with the writer and director, Kevin McClory, with whom he was working on a film treatment which eventually Fleming published as the novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;.

Although Fleming did not date the events within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put the events of &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; in 1960; Griswold considers the story to have taken place in October 1961.

==Development==
===Plot inspirations===
For &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, Fleming borrowed from his surroundings and experiences, as he had done with all his writing up to that point. The Dreamy Pines Motel in the Adirondacks was based on one Fleming would drive past on the way to a friend&#x27;s Black Hole Hollow Farm in Vermont; Viv is seduced by Derek, a public school boy, in the Royalty Kinema, Windsor, in the same way Fleming—while at the nearby public school Eton—seduced a woman and lost his virginity in the same establishment. Her time with Derek in the area around Cookham, Berkshire, is similar to Fleming&#x27;s activities and experiences while he was at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

As he had done in his previous novels, Fleming borrowed names from his friends and associates to use in his book: Robert Harling, a colleague at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, gave his name to a printer in the story while another minor character, Frank Donaldson, was named after Jack Donaldson, a friend of Ann Fleming. One of Fleming&#x27;s neighbours in Jamaica was Vivienne Stuart, whose first name Fleming used for the novel&#x27;s central character.

===Characters===
The novelist Raymond Benson—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—sees Vivienne Michel as the best-realised female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, partly because the story is told in the first-person narrative with the first third of the novel dedicated to her biography. Benson notes that while Viv has been a victim of life in the past, she is wilful and tough too. Viv is not a fashionable stylish woman of the 1950s, but one who likes camping, fishing and other outdoor activities; Chancellor states that in this respect, she is, like Bond, an ideal from Fleming&#x27;s imagination.

The academic Christine Bold considers that Viv demonstrates a naïve view of life, and that the character reinforces Fleming&#x27;s misogynistic view of women as they had been portrayed in the earlier Bond stories. Bold sees that Viv &quot;underwrites Bond&#x27;s sexual dominance over women&quot; by sleeping with him after he saves her. It is at this point in the novel that Fleming (as Viv) writes &quot;All women love semi-rape. They love to be taken.&quot; The claim was one for which Fleming was criticised. The opinion of the journalist Ben Macintyre is that &quot;Fleming was not seriously defending rape, or even semi-rape, but trying to shock by reinforcing the idea of Bond&#x27;s essential cruelty. If so, he shocked far more than he intended, and he still does&quot;. Despite her rescue from near-rape and death, the author Nick Stone thinks that:

... at the end there is very little resolution for Vivienne, and next to no catharsis. The reader is left with the sense that she will only add the scars of her &#x27;night of screaming terror&#x27; at the hands of the villains to those inflicted from her past.

The other characters in the novel are given less attention by Fleming. The historian Jeremy Black describes how Viv&#x27;s second lover, Kurt, is a caricature of a German—a cruel racist with little capacity for love or affection—who forces her to have an abortion before ending their affair. According to Black, the two thugs, Sluggsy and Horror, are &quot;comic-book villains with comic-book names&quot;. Their characters are not given the same status as other villains in Bond stories, but are second-rate professional killers which, the writer Matthew Parker thinks, makes them more believable in the story. Chancellor considers the novel&#x27;s absence of a supervillain makes this one of Fleming&#x27;s weaker works.

==Style==
&quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; is distinct from the other Bond novels in not being a spy story, and without that aspect &quot;the full panoply of a Bond novel, animated by his presence, is absent&quot;, according to Black. Black sees the closest equivalent in the Bond canon is &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, the 1960 short story about marital relations Fleming wrote in the style of W. Somerset Maugham, a writer he greatly admired. The absence of the spy element in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, and the concentration on Viv&#x27;s early life, ensures the novel is the closest Fleming gets to kitchen sink realism in the Bond canon, as well as being the most sexually explicit of all of Fleming&#x27;s novels.

Benson analyses Fleming&#x27;s writing style and identifies what he describes as the &quot;Fleming Sweep&quot;: a stylistic point that sweeps the reader from one chapter to another using narrative hooks at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next: Benson considers that the Sweep in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; was still present, although the manuscript is ostensibly written by Viv.

The literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek observes that &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; is a love story; in this, the novel &quot;simply codifies a number of tendencies present in all ... [Fleming&#x27;s] fiction&quot;. Panek argues that there are strong elements of romance in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, &quot;Diamonds are Forever&quot;, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;Thunderball&quot; and &quot;Dr. No&quot;. When analysed from the romantic viewpoint, the threat of Viv&#x27;s rape from the two gangsters is held in counterpoint to the consensual sex between her and Bond.

==Themes==
Bold sees Bond as a when he appears in the novel. As with several other Bond stories, the concept of Bond as Saint George against the dragon underlies the storyline to &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, with Bond rescuing the maiden from imminent danger; Viv refers to Bond&#x27;s appearance directly connecting Bond to the medieval legend:

Apart from the excitement of his looks, his authority, his maleness, he had come from nowhere, like the prince in the fairy tales, and he had saved me from the dragon. But for him, I would now be dead, after suffering God knows what before. He could have changed the wheel on his car and gone off, or, when danger came, he could have saved his own skin. But he had fought for my life as if it had been his own. And then, when the dragon was dead, he had taken me as his reward.

The question of good and evil is raised in the novel, with the police captain warning Viv that there is no practical difference between good and bad in the murky world in which both Bond and organised crime operate. Benson notes that when Viv first saw Bond, she thought he was another of the gangsters. Black agrees, and also sees the misuse of power by those with dark motives in the novel, and the vulnerable being challenged and trapped by manipulative and powerful forces. Before the police officer&#x27;s conversation with Viv, Bond also discusses with her the question of good and evil and says there was little value in his job and his way of life, concluding:

It&#x27;s nothing but a complicated game, really. But then so&#x27;s international politics, diplomacy—all the trappings of nationalism and the power complex that goes on between countries. Nobody will stop playing the game. It&#x27;s like the hunting instinct.

==Publication and reception==
===Publication history===

&quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; was released in the UK on 16 April 1962 as a hardcover edition by the publishers Jonathan Cape; it was 221 pages long. To continue the conceit that Viv had given the script to Fleming, she was listed as a co-author of the work. As he had with all of the previous first editions, the artist Richard Chopping undertook the cover art. He raised his fee from the 200 guineas (£210) he had charged for &quot;Thunderball&quot; to 250 guineas (£262.50). The artwork included a Fairbairn–Sykes commando knife; Fleming borrowed one owned by his editor, Michael Howard at Jonathan Cape, as a model for Chopping. &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; was published in the US by Viking Books in April 1962; it was 211 pages long. In the US the story was also later published in &quot;Stag&quot; magazine, with the title changed to &quot;Motel Nymph&quot;.

Fleming later said of &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; that &quot;the experiment has obviously gone very much awry&quot;. Because of the sexual content in the novel, it was banned in a number of countries, including in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, South Africa and Australia.

The reception to the novel was so bad that Fleming requested there should be no reprints or paperback version of the book. For the British market no paperback version appeared until Pan Books published a copy in May 1967, after Fleming&#x27;s death in 1964. This sold 517,000 copies before the end of the year, the best first-year sales of any of Fleming&#x27;s works, with the exception of &quot;Thunderball&quot;, which sold 808,000 copies. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and, as at 2025, has never been out of print. In 2023 Ian Fleming Publications—the company that administers Fleming&#x27;s literary works—had the Bond series edited as part of a sensitivity review to remove or reword some racial or ethnic descriptors. The phrase &quot;sweet tang of rape&quot; from &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; was retained in the new release. The release of the bowdlerised series was on the 70th anniversary of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, the first Bond novel.

===Critical reception===
Critics did not welcome Fleming&#x27;s experiment with the Bond formula and the historian Black notes that &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; had the worst reception of all the Bond books. &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, for example, wrote &quot;Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! And to think of the books Mr Fleming once wrote!&quot; while &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; thought Fleming&#x27;s writing career was over: &quot;His ability to invent a plot has deserted him almost entirely and he has had to substitute for a fast-moving story the sorry misadventures of an upper-class tramp, told in dreary detail.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Observer&quot;, Maurice Richardson described the tale as &quot;a new and regrettable if not altogether unreadable variation&quot;, going on to hope that &quot;this doesn&#x27;t spell the total eclipse of Bond in a blaze of cornography&quot;. Richardson ended his piece by berating Fleming, asking &quot;why can&#x27;t this cunning author write up a bit instead of down?&quot; The critic for &quot;The Times&quot; was not dismissive of Bond, describing him as &quot;less a person than a cult&quot; who is &quot;ruthlessly, fashionably efficient in both love and war&quot;. Rather, the critic dismisses the experiment, writing that &quot;the novel lacks Mr. Fleming&#x27;s usual careful construction and must be written off as a disappointment.&quot; The reviewer John Fletcher thought that it was &quot;as if Mickey Spillane had tried to gatecrash his way into the Romantic Novelists&#x27; Association&quot;.

Philip Stead, writing in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; considered the novel&#x27;s plot to be &quot;a morbid version of that of Beauty and the Beast&quot;. The review noted that once Bond arrives on the scene to find Viv threatened by the two thugs, he &quot;solves [the problem] in his usual way. A great quantity of ammunition is expended, the zip-fastener is kept busy and the customary sexual consummation is associated with the kill.&quot; Vernon Scannell, as critic for &quot;The Listener&quot;, considered &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; to be &quot;as silly as it is unpleasant&quot;. What aggrieved him most, however, was that it was &quot;so unremittingly, so grindingly boring&quot;.

The critic for &quot;Time&quot; lamented the fact that &quot;unaccountably lacking in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; are the High-Stake Gambling Scene, the Meal-Ordering Scene, the Torture Scene, the battleship-grey Bentley and Blades Club&quot;. The critic also bemoaned the fact that &quot;among the shocks and disappointments 1962 still has in store ... is the discovery that the cruel, handsome, scarred face of James Bond does not turn up until more than halfway through Ian Fleming&#x27;s latest book&quot;. Anthony Boucher—a critic described by Fleming&#x27;s biographer, John Pearson, as &quot;throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man&quot;—meanwhile wrote that the &quot;author has reached an unprecedented low&quot;.

Not all reviews were negative. Esther Howard wrote in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;Surprisingly Ian Fleming&#x27;s new book is a romantic one and, except for some early sex in England (rather well done, this) only just as nasty as is needed to show how absolutely thrilling it is for ... the narrator to be rescued from both death and worse – than by a he-man like James Bond. Myself, I like the Daphne du Maurier touch and prefer it this way but I doubt his real fans will.&quot;

==Adaptations==

The previous Bond works were serialised in &quot;The Daily Express&quot;, but the newspaper turned down the opportunity to publish &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; as the story was too unlike the normal Bond books. The novel was adapted as a daily comic strip, written by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak. It was published in &quot;The Daily Express&quot; from 18 December 1967 to 3 October 1968 and syndicated around the world. &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; was the last of Fleming&#x27;s works to be adapted as a comic strip for the newspaper. The comic strip was reprinted in 2011 by Titan Books in the second volume of &quot;The James Bond Omnibus&quot;; the anthology also includes &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; and &quot;Octopussy&quot;.

In 1977 the name &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; was used for the tenth film in the Eon Productions series. It was the third to star Roger Moore as Bond. Although Fleming had insisted that no film should contain anything of the plot of the novel—and the rights for the use of the name were granted on the basis that only the title was used—the steel-toothed character of Horror was included, renamed for the film as Jaws.

<text>The Junkers EF 61 was a German prototype twin-engined high-altitude bomber aircraft of the 1930s. Only two examples were built, but it provided valuable information on pressure cabins which aided the design of later pressurised aircraft.

==Design and development==
The pressurised cabin of the Junkers EF 61 was based on that of the Junkers Ju 49. The EF 61 was one of the few German high-altitude bomber and reconnaissance projects before World War II. The project started in September 1935 and the maiden flight took place on 4 March 1937, but on 19 September of that year the EF 61 V1 was destroyed in a crash. The second prototype EF 61 V2 was ready in late 1937 but also crashed in December 1937, even before high-altitude testing had started. After that the project was abandoned.
The project eventually led to the high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft of the Junkers Ju 86 type in World War II.

<doc id="490134" wikidata="Q1890389" url="?curid=490134" title="Connected sum">
<text>In mathematics, specifically in topology, the operation of connected sum is a geometric modification on manifolds. Its effect is to join two given manifolds together near a chosen point on each. This construction plays a key role in the classification of closed surfaces.

More generally, one can also join manifolds together along identical submanifolds; this generalization is often called the fiber sum. There is also a closely related notion of a connected sum on knots, called the knot sum or composition of knots.

== Connected sum at a point ==

A connected sum of two &quot;m&quot;-dimensional manifolds is a manifold formed by deleting a ball inside each manifold and gluing together the resulting boundary spheres.

If both manifolds are oriented, there is a unique connected sum defined by having the gluing map reverse orientation. Although the construction uses the choice of the balls, the result is unique up to homeomorphism. One can also make this operation work in the smooth category, and then the result is unique up to diffeomorphism. There are subtle problems in the smooth case: not every diffeomorphism between the boundaries of the spheres gives the same composite manifold, even if the orientations are chosen correctly. For example, Milnor showed that two 7-cells can be glued along their boundary so that the result is an exotic sphere homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to a 7-sphere.

However, there is a canonical way to choose the gluing of formula_1 and formula_2 which gives a unique well-defined connected sum. Choose embeddings formula_3 and formula_4 so that formula_5 preserves orientation and formula_6 reverses orientation. Now obtain formula_7 from the disjoint sum
:formula_8
by identifying formula_9 with formula_10 for each unit vector formula_11 and each formula_12. Choose the orientation for formula_7 which is compatible with formula_1 and formula_2. The fact that this construction is well-defined depends crucially on the disc theorem, which is not at all obvious. For further details, see.

The operation of connected sum is denoted by formula_16.

The operation of connected sum has the sphere formula_17 as an identity; that is, formula_18 is homeomorphic (or diffeomorphic) to formula_19.

The classification of closed surfaces, a foundational and historically significant result in topology, states that any closed surface can be expressed as the connected sum of a sphere with some number formula_20 of tori and some number formula_21 of real projective planes.

== Connected sum along a submanifold ==

Let formula_1 and formula_2 be two smooth, oriented manifolds of equal dimension and formula_24 a smooth, closed, oriented manifold, embedded as a submanifold into both formula_1 and formula_26 Suppose furthermore that there exists an isomorphism of normal bundles

:formula_27

that reverses the orientation on each fiber. Then formula_28 induces an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism

:formula_29

where each normal bundle formula_30 is diffeomorphically identified with a neighborhood formula_31 of formula_24 in formula_33, and the map

:formula_34

is the orientation-reversing diffeomorphic involution

:formula_35

on normal vectors. The connected sum of formula_1 and formula_2 along formula_24 is then the space

:formula_39

obtained by gluing the deleted neighborhoods together by the orientation-preserving diffeomorphism. The sum is often denoted

:formula_40

Its diffeomorphism type depends on the choice of the two embeddings of formula_24 and on the choice of formula_28.

Loosely speaking, each normal fiber of the submanifold formula_24 contains a single point of formula_24, and the connected sum along formula_24 is simply the connected sum as described in the preceding section, performed along each fiber. For this reason, the connected sum along formula_24 is often called the fiber sum.

The special case of formula_24 a point recovers the connected sum of the preceding section.

== Connected sum along a codimension-two submanifold ==

Another important special case occurs when the dimension of formula_24 is two less than that of the formula_33. Then the isomorphism formula_28 of normal bundles exists whenever their Euler classes are opposite:

:formula_51

Furthermore, in this case the structure group of the normal bundles is the circle group formula_52; it follows that the choice of embeddings can be canonically identified with the group of homotopy classes of maps from formula_24 to the circle, which in turn equals the first integral cohomology group formula_54. So the diffeomorphism type of the sum depends on the choice of formula_28 and a choice of element from formula_54.

A connected sum along a codimension-two formula_24 can also be carried out in the category of symplectic manifolds; this elaboration is called the symplectic sum.

== Local operation ==

The connected sum is a local operation on manifolds, meaning that it alters the summands only in a neighborhood of formula_24. This implies, for example, that the sum can be carried out on a single manifold formula_19 containing two disjoint copies of formula_24, with the effect of gluing formula_19 to itself. For example, the connected sum of a 2-sphere at two distinct points of the sphere produces the 2-torus.

== Connected sum of knots ==

There is a closely related notion of the connected sum of two knots. In fact, if one regards a knot merely as a 1-manifold, then the connected sum of two knots is just their connected sum as a 1-dimensional manifold. However, the essential property of a knot is not its manifold structure (under which every knot is equivalent to a circle) but rather its embedding into the ambient space. So the connected sum of knots has a more elaborate definition that produces a well-defined embedding, as follows.

This procedure results in the projection of a new knot, a connected sum (or knot sum, or composition) of the original knots. For the connected sum of knots to be well defined, one has to consider oriented knots in 3-space. To define the connected sum for two oriented knots:

# Consider a planar projection of each knot and suppose these projections are disjoint.
# Find a rectangle in the plane where one pair of sides are arcs along each knot but is otherwise disjoint from the knots and so that the arcs of the knots on the sides of the rectangle are oriented around the boundary of the rectangle in the same direction.
# Now join the two knots together by deleting these arcs from the knots and adding the arcs that form the other pair of sides of the rectangle.

The resulting connected sum knot inherits an orientation consistent with the orientations of the two original knots, and the oriented ambient isotopy class of the result is well-defined, depending only on the oriented ambient isotopy classes of the original two knots.

Under this operation, oriented knots in 3-space form a commutative monoid with unique prime factorization, which allows us to define what is meant by a prime knot. Proof of commutativity can be seen by letting one summand shrink until it is very small and then pulling it along the other knot. The unknot is the unit. The two trefoil knots are the simplest prime knots. Higher-dimensional knots can be added by splicing the formula_62-spheres.

In three dimensions, the unknot cannot be written as the sum of two non-trivial knots. This fact follows from additivity of knot genus; another proof relies on an infinite construction sometimes called the Mazur swindle. In higher dimensions (with codimension at least three), it is possible to get an unknot by adding two nontrivial knots.

If one does not take into account the orientations of the knots, the connected sum operation is not well-defined on isotopy classes of (nonoriented) knots. To see this, consider two noninvertible knots &quot;K, L&quot; which are not equivalent (as unoriented knots); for example take the two pretzel knots &quot;K&quot; = &quot;P&quot;(3, 5, 7) and &quot;L&quot; = &quot;P&quot;(3, 5, 9). Let &quot;K&quot;+ and &quot;K&quot;− be &quot;K&quot; with its two inequivalent orientations, and let &quot;L&quot;+ and &quot;L&quot;− be &quot;L&quot; with its two inequivalent orientations. There are four oriented connected sums we may form:

* &quot;A&quot; = &quot;K&quot;+ # &quot;L&quot;+
* &quot;B&quot; = &quot;K&quot;− # &quot;L&quot;−
* &quot;C&quot; = &quot;K&quot;+ # &quot;L&quot;−
* &quot;D&quot; = &quot;K&quot;− # &quot;L&quot;+

The oriented ambient isotopy classes of these four oriented knots are all distinct, and, when one considers ambient isotopy of the knots without regard to orientation, there are two distinct equivalence classes: {&quot;A&quot; ~ &quot;B&quot;} and {&quot;C&quot; ~ &quot;D&quot;}. To see that &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are unoriented equivalent, simply note that they both may be constructed from the same pair of disjoint knot projections as above, the only difference being the orientations of the knots. Similarly, one sees that &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; may be constructed from the same pair of disjoint knot projections.

<doc id="490135" wikidata="Q5891416" url="?curid=490135" title="Homological conjectures in commutative algebra">
<text>In mathematics, homological conjectures have been a focus of research activity in commutative algebra since the early 1960s. They concern a number of interrelated (sometimes surprisingly so) conjectures relating various homological properties of a commutative ring to its internal ring structure, particularly its Krull dimension and depth.

The following list given by Melvin Hochster is considered definitive for this area. In the sequel, formula_1, and formula_2 refer to Noetherian commutative rings; formula_3 will be a local ring with maximal ideal formula_4, and formula_5 and formula_6 are finitely generated formula_3-modules.

# The Zero Divisor Theorem. If formula_8 has finite projective dimension and formula_9 is not a zero divisor on formula_5, then formula_11 is not a zero divisor on formula_3.
# Bass&#x27;s Question. If formula_8 has a finite injective resolution then formula_3 is a Cohen–Macaulay ring.
# The Intersection Theorem. If formula_15 has finite length, then the Krull dimension of &quot;N&quot; (i.e., the dimension of &quot;R&quot; modulo the annihilator of &quot;N&quot;) is at most the projective dimension of &quot;M&quot;.
# The New Intersection Theorem. Let formula_16 denote a finite complex of free &quot;R&quot;-modules such that formula_17 has finite length but is not 0. Then the (Krull dimension) formula_18.
# The Improved New Intersection Conjecture. Let formula_16 denote a finite complex of free &quot;R&quot;-modules such that formula_20 has finite length for formula_21 and formula_22 has a minimal generator that is killed by a power of the maximal ideal of &quot;R&quot;. Then formula_18.
# The Direct Summand Conjecture. If formula_24 is a module-finite ring extension with &quot;R&quot; regular (here, &quot;R&quot; need not be local but the problem reduces at once to the local case), then &quot;R&quot; is a direct summand of &quot;S&quot; as an &quot;R&quot;-module. The conjecture was proven by Yves André using a theory of perfectoid spaces.
# The Canonical Element Conjecture. Let formula_25 be a system of parameters for &quot;R&quot;, let formula_26 be a free &quot;R&quot;-resolution of the residue field of &quot;R&quot; with formula_27, and let formula_28 denote the Koszul complex of &quot;R&quot; with respect to formula_25. Lift the identity map formula_30 to a map of complexes. Then no matter what the choice of system of parameters or lifting, the last map from formula_31 is not 0.
# Existence of Balanced Big Cohen–Macaulay Modules Conjecture. There exists a (not necessarily finitely generated) &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;W&quot; such that &quot;mRW ≠ W&quot; and every system of parameters for &quot;R&quot; is a regular sequence on &quot;W&quot;.
# Cohen-Macaulayness of Direct Summands Conjecture. If &quot;R&quot; is a direct summand of a regular ring &quot;S&quot; as an &quot;R&quot;-module, then &quot;R&quot; is Cohen–Macaulay (&quot;R&quot; need not be local, but the result reduces at once to the case where &quot;R&quot; is local).
# The Vanishing Conjecture for Maps of Tor. Let formula_32 be homomorphisms where &quot;R&quot; is not necessarily local (one can reduce to that case however), with &quot;A, S&quot; regular and &quot;R&quot; finitely generated as an &quot;A&quot;-module. Let &quot;W&quot; be any &quot;A&quot;-module. Then the map formula_33 is zero for all formula_34.
# The Strong Direct Summand Conjecture. Let formula_24 be a map of complete local domains, and let &quot;Q&quot; be a height one prime ideal of &quot;S&quot; lying over formula_36, where &quot;R&quot; and formula_37 are both regular. Then formula_36 is a direct summand of &quot;Q&quot; considered as &quot;R&quot;-modules.
# Existence of Weakly Functorial Big Cohen-Macaulay Algebras Conjecture. Let formula_39 be a local homomorphism of complete local domains. Then there exists an &quot;R&quot;-algebra &quot;BR&quot; that is a balanced big Cohen–Macaulay algebra for &quot;R&quot;, an &quot;S&quot;-algebra formula_40 that is a balanced big Cohen-Macaulay algebra for &quot;S&quot;, and a homomorphism &quot;BR → BS&quot; such that the natural square given by these maps commutes.
# Serre&#x27;s Conjecture on Multiplicities. (cf. [[Serre&#x27;s multiplicity conjectures]].) Suppose that &quot;R&quot; is regular of dimension &quot;d&quot; and that formula_41 has finite length. Then formula_42, defined as the alternating sum of the lengths of the modules formula_43 is 0 if formula_44, and is positive if the sum is equal to &quot;d&quot;. (N.B. Jean-Pierre Serre proved that the sum cannot exceed &quot;d&quot;.)
# Small Cohen–Macaulay Modules Conjecture. If &quot;R&quot; is complete, then there exists a finitely-generated &quot;R&quot;-module formula_8 such that some (equivalently every) system of parameters for &quot;R&quot; is a regular sequence on &quot;M&quot;.

<text>The Hamzanama (Persian/Urdu: &quot;Hamzenâme&quot;, ) or Dastan-e-Amir Hamza (Persian/Urdu: , &quot;Dâstân-e Amir Hamze&quot;, ) narrates the legendary exploits of Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib, an uncle of Muhammad. Most of the stories are extremely fanciful, &quot;a continuous series of romantic interludes, threatening events, narrow escapes, and violent acts&quot;. The &quot;Hamzanama&quot; chronicles the fantastic adventures of Hamza as he and his band of heroes fight the enemies.

The stories, from a long-established oral tradition, were written down in Persian, the language of the courts of Persianate societies, in multiple volumes, presumably in the era of Mahmud of Ghazni (r. 998–1030). In the West, the work is best known for the enormous illustrated manuscript, the &quot;Akbar Hamzanama&quot;, commissioned by the Mughal emperor Akbar about 1562. The written text augmented the story as traditionally told orally in dastan performances. The dastan (storytelling tradition) about Amir Hamza persists far and wide up to Bengal and Arakan, as the Mughal Empire controlled those territories. The longest version of the &quot;Hamzanama&quot; exists in Urdu and contains 46 volumes comprising over 45,000 pages.
==History: versions and translations==
===Iranian origins===
In Persian, &quot;dastan&quot; and &quot;qissa&quot; both mean &quot;story,&quot; and the narrative genre they refer to goes back to medieval Iran. William L. Hanaway, who has made a close study of Persian dastans, describes them as &quot;popular romances&quot; that were &quot;created, elaborated, and transmitted&quot; by professional storytellers. At least as early as the ninth century, the dastan was a widely popular form of story-telling. Dastan-narrators told tales of heroic romance and adventure—stories about gallant princes and their encounters with evil kings, enemy champions, demons, magicians, &quot;jinns&quot;, divine emissaries, tricky secret agents called &quot;ayyars&quot;, and beautiful princesses who might be human or of the &quot;pari&quot; (&quot;fairy&quot;) race. Their ultimate subject matter was always simple: &quot;&quot;razm o bazm&quot;,&quot; the battlefield and the elegant courtly life, war and love. Hanaway mentions five principal dastans surviving from the pre-Safavid period (that is, from the 15th-century and earlier): those that grew up around the adventures of the world-conqueror Alexander (&quot;Alexander Romance&quot;), the great Persian king Darius, the Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Hamza, the legendary king Firoz Shah, and a trickster-hero named Samak the Ayyar. Of all the early dastans, the Hamza romance is thought to be the oldest.

The romance of Hamza claims to go back to the life of its hero, Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib, the paternal uncle of the Prophet, who was slain in the Battle of Uhud (625 CE) by a slave instigated by a woman named Hind bint Utbah, whose relatives Hamza had killed at Badr. Hind bint Utbah then went to the battlefield and mutilated the dead Hamza&#x27;s body, cutting off his ears and nose, cutting out his liver and chewing it to fulfill the vow of vengeance she had made. Later, when the Prophet conquered Mecca, Hind bint Utbah accepted Islam, and was pardoned.
It has been argued that the romance of Hamza may actually have begun with the adventures of a Persian namesake of the original Hamza: Hamza ibn Abdullah, a member of a radical Islamic sect called the Kharijites, who was the leader of a rebel movement against the caliph Harun al-Rashid and his successors. This Persian Hamzah lived in the early 9th-century, and seems to have been a dashing rebel whose colorful exploits gave rise to many stories. He was known to have fought against the Abbasid caliph-monarch, and the local warriors from Sistan, Makran, Sindh and Khorasan are said to have joined him in the battle, which lasted until the Caliph died. After the battle, Hamza left, inexplicably, for Sarandip (Ceylon) and China, leaving behind 5000 warriors to protect the powerless against the powerful. His disciples wrote the account of his travels and expeditions in a book &quot;Maghazi-e-Amir Hamza&quot;, which was the original source of &quot;Dastan-e-Amir Hamza&quot;. As these stories circulated, they eventually transferred to the earlier Hamza, who was an orthodox Muslim champion acceptable to all.

The seventeenth-century &quot;Zubdat ur-Rumuz&quot; actually gives two conflicting origin-stories for the &quot;Hamzanama&quot;. The first is that after Hamza&#x27;s death, ladies living near the Prophet&#x27;s house told praising anecdotes to get the Prophet&#x27;s attention; one Masud Makki then produced the first written version of these stories to divert the Meccans from their hostility to the Prophet. The second is that wise courtiers devised the romance to cure a brain fever suffered by one of the Abbasid caliphs. The 1909 Indo-Persian version also gives two conflicting sources. The first is that the dastan was invented by Abbas, who used to tell it to the Prophet, his nephew, to cheer him up with stories of his other uncle&#x27;s glory. The second is that the dastan was invented during the reign of Muawiyah I (661–79) to keep loyalty to the Prophet&#x27;s family alive among the people, despite official hostility and vilification.

In his study of the Arabian epic, Malcolm Lyons discusses &quot;Sirat Hamzat al-&quot;, which is a parallel cycle of tales about Amir Hamza in Arabic, with similarities of names and places to the &quot;Hamzanama&quot;: thus Anushirwan corresponds to Nausheravan, the vizier Buzurjmihr is synonymous to Buzurjmehr, and there are parallels for the Persian capital Midan and also jinn of Jabal Qaf. But it is difficult to prove who has borrowed from whom.

===Spread down to the 15th century===
The Hamza story soon grew, ramified, traveled and gradually spread over immense areas of the Muslim world. It was translated into Arabic (&quot;Sīrat Amīr Ḥamza&quot;); there is a twelfth-century Georgian version, and a fifteenth-century Turkish version twenty-four volumes long. Moreover, even in Iran the story continued to develop over time: by the mid-nineteenth century the Hamza romance had grown to such an extent that it was printed in an edition comprising about twelve hundred very large pages. By this time the dastan was often called &quot;Rumuz-e Hamza&quot; (The Subtleties of Hamza), and had also made itself conspicuously at home in India.

===Evolving Indian versions===
====Persian====
Annemarie Schimmel judges that the Hamza story must have been popular in the Indian subcontinent from the days of Mahmud of Ghazni in the early eleventh century. The earliest solid evidence, however, seems to be a late-fifteenth-century set of paintings that illustrate the story; these were crudely executed, possibly in Jaunpur, perhaps for a not-too-affluent patron.

In 1555, Babur noted with disapproval that the leading literary figure of Khurasan had recently &quot;wasted his time&quot; in composing an imitation of the cycle. The great emperor Akbar (1556–1605), far from sharing his grandfather&#x27;s attitude, conceived and supervised the immense task of illustrating the whole romance, producing a manuscript now known as the Akbar &quot;Hamzanama&quot;. As Akbar&#x27;s court chronicler tells us, Hamza&#x27;s adventures were &quot;represented in twelve volumes, and clever painters made the most astonishing illustrations for no less than one thousand and four hundred passages of the story.&quot; The illustrated manuscript thus created became the supreme achievement of Mughal art: &quot;of all the loot carried off from Delhi by Nadir Shah in 1739 (including the Peacock Throne), it was only the &quot;Hamza-nama&quot;, &#x27;painted with images that defy the imagination,&#x27; that Emperor Muhammad Shah pleaded to have returned.&quot;

The Hamza story left traces in the Deccan as well. One Persian romance-narrator, Haji Qissah-Khvan Hamadani, records his arrival in 1612 at Hyderabad, at the court of Sultan Abdullah Qutb Shah (1611-72) of Golconda. The Haji writes, &quot;I had brought with me a number of manuscripts of the &quot;Rumuz-e Hamza&quot;. When I presented them in the king&#x27;s service, I was ordered, &#x27;Prepare a summary of them.&#x27; In obedience to this order this book &quot;Zubdat ur-Rumuz&quot; (The Cream of the Rumuz) has been prepared.&quot; At least two other seventeenth-century Indo-Persian Hamza manuscripts survive, dated 1096 AH [1684–85 CE] and 1099 AH [1687–88 CE], as well as various undated and later ones.

In the course of countless retellings before faithful audiences, the Indo-Persian Hamza story seems to have grown generally longer and more elaborate throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. By the eighteenth century, the Hamza story was so well-known in India that it inspired an indigenous Indo-Persian imitation, the massive &quot;Bostan-e Khiyal&quot; (Garden of &quot;&quot;) by Mir Muhammad Taqi. By the nineteenth century, however, Persian was in a slow decline as an Indian language, for its political and cultural place was being taken by Pashto and the Indic languages. It is in these languages that the dastan found a hospitable environment to survive and flourish.

====Urdu====

The Hamza romance spread gradually, usually in its briefer and less elaborate forms, into a number of the modern languages of South Asia. Pashto and Sindhi were particularly hospitable to the Hamza story, and at least in Pashto it continues to flourish today, with printed pamphlet versions being produced. In Bengali it was popular among Muslims as early as the 18th-century, in a long verse romance called &quot;Amirhamjar puthi&quot;, which its authors, Fakir Garibullah and Saiyad Hamja, described as a translation from the Persian. This romance was printed repeatedly in pamphlet form in the nineteenth century, and even occasionally in the twentieth. Various Hindi versions were produced too—but above all, the story of Hamza flourished in Urdu.

The earliest Hamza retelling in Urdu exists in a late Dakhani prose version called &quot;Qissa-e Jang-e Amir Hamza&quot; (Qissa of the War of Amir Hamza) (1784). Very little is known about this work&#x27;s background. It was probably translated from a Persian text. In 1801, Khalil Ali Khan Ashk, a member of the Hindustani department of the famous Fort William College in Calcutta, composed the earliest printed version of the dastan in Urdu: the 500-page &quot;Dastan-e Amir Hamza&quot;, consisting of twenty-two dastans, or chapters, grouped into four &quot;volumes.&quot;

Ashk claims that the story he is telling goes back to the time of Mahmud of Ghazni, in the early eleventh century; he implies that his present text is a translation, or at least a rendering, of the written, presumably Persian text that the distinguished dastan-narrators of Mahmud&#x27;s court first set down. Ashk also claims that his sources, the narrators of Mahmud&#x27;s court, compiled fourteen volumes of Hamza&#x27;s adventures. However, we have no evidence that Mahmud of Ghazni ever sponsored the production of such a work. Gyan Chand Jain thinks that in fact Ashk based his version on the Dakhani &quot;Qissa-e jang-e amir Hamza&quot; because his plot agrees in many important particulars with the early Persian &quot;Qissa-e Hamza&quot;, though it disagrees in many others.

However, the most popular version of the dastan in Urdu was that of Aman Ali Khan Bahadur Ghalib Lakhnavi published by Hakim Mohtasham Elaih Press, Calcutta in 1855. In the 1860s, one of the early publications of Munshi Nawal Kishore, the legendary publisher from Lucknow, was Ashk&#x27;s &quot;Dastan-e Amir Hamza&quot;. Nawal Kishore eventually replaced Ashk&#x27;s version with a revised and improved &quot;Dastan-e amir Hamza&quot; (1871), explaining to the public that the Ashk version was marred by its &quot;archaic idioms and convoluted style.&quot; Munshi Nawal Kishore commissioned Maulvi Syed Abdullah Bilgrami to revise Ali Khan Bahadur Ghalib&#x27;s translation and published it in 1871. This version proved extraordinarily successful. The Bilgrami version has almost certainly been more often reprinted, and more widely read, than any other in Urdu. In 1887 Syed Tasadduq Husain, a proofreader at Nawal Kishore Press, revised and embellished this edition. In the twentieth century, Abdul Bari Aasi adapted this version by removing all the couplets from it and toning down the melodramatic scenes.

Owing to the popularity of the Ashk and Bilgrami versions in Urdu, Nawal Kishore also brought out in 1879 a counterpart work in Hindi called &quot;Amir Hamza Ki Dastan&quot;, by Pandits Kalicharan and Maheshdatt. This work was quite an undertaking in its own right: 520 large pages of typeset Devanagari script, in a prose adorned not with elegant Persian expressions but with exactly comparable Sanskritisms, and interspersed not with Persian verse forms but with Indic ones like &quot;kavitt&quot;, &quot;soratha&quot;, and &quot;chaupai&quot;. The &quot;Amir Hamza Ki Dastan&quot;, with its assimilation of a highly Islamic content into a self-consciously Sanskritized form, offers a fascinating early glimpse of the development of Hindi. The heirs of Nawal Kishore apparently published a 662-page Hindi version of the dastan as late as 1939.

During this same period Nawal Kishore added a third version of the Hamza story: a verse rendering of the romance, a new masnavi by Tota Ram Shayan called &quot;Tilism-e Shayan Ma ruf Bah Dastan-e Amir Hamza&quot; published in 1862. At 30,000 lines, it was the longest Urdu masnavi ever written in North India, with the exception of versions of the Arabian Nights. Yet Shayan is said to have composed it in only six months. This version too apparently found a good sale, for by 1893 Nawal Kishore was printing it for the sixth time.

==== 1881–1905 Kishore &quot;Dastan-e Amir Hamza&quot; ====
In 1881, Nawal Kishore finally began publishing his own elaborate multi-volume Hamza series. He hired Muhammad Husain Jah, Ahmad Husain Qamar, and Tasadduq Husain, the most famous Lucknow dastan-narrators, to compose the stories. This version of the &quot;Dastan-e Amir Hamza&quot; was an extraordinary achievement: not only the crowning glory of the Urdu dastan tradition, but also surely the longest single romance cycle in world literature, since the forty-six volumes average 900 pages each. Publication of the cycle began with the first four volumes of &quot;Tilism-e Hoshruba&quot; (&quot;The Stunning Tilism&quot;) by Muhammad Husain Jah; these volumes were published between 1883 and 1890, after which Jah had differences with Nawal Kishore and left the Press. These four volumes by Jah proved immensely popular, and are still considered the heart of the cycle. After Jah, the two main architects of the cycle, Ahmad Husain Qamar (nineteen volumes) and Tasadduq Husain (nineteen volumes) took over the work from 1892 to its completion around 1905.

These writers were not the original creators of the tales and by the time the Nawal Kishore Press began publishing them, they had already evolved in their form and structure. As these dastans were mainly meant for oral rendition, the storytellers added local colour to these tales. Storytelling had become a popular craft in India by nineteenth century. The storytellers narrated their long winding tales of suspense, mystery, adventure, magic, fantasy, and the marvellous rolled into one to their inquisitive audiences. Each day, the session would end at a point where the curious public would be left to wonder as to what happened next. Some of the most famous storytellers of Hamza dastan were Mir Ahmad Ali (who belonged to Lucknow but later moved to Rampur), Mir Qasim Ali, Hakim Sayed Asghar Ali Khan (who came to Rampur during the tenure of Nawab Mohammad Saeed Khan i.e. 1840–1855), Zamin Ali Jalal Lucknowi, Munshi Amba Prasad Rasa Lucknowi (a disciple of Mir Ahmad Ali who later converted to Islam and was rechristened Abdur Rahman), his son Ghulam Raza, Haider Mirza Tasawwur Lucknowi (a disciple of Asghar Ali), Haji Ali Ibn Mirza Makkhoo Beg, his son Syed Husain Zaidi and Murtuza Husain Visaal.

The final arrangement of the cycle was into eight &quot;daftars&quot; or sections. The first four &quot;daftars&quot;—the two-volume &quot;Naushervan-nama&quot; (The Book of Naushervan); the one-volume &quot;Kochak Bakhtar&quot; (The Lesser West); the one-volume &quot;Bala bakhtar&quot; (The Upper West); and the two-volume &quot;Iraj-nama&quot; (The Book of Iraj)—were closer to the Persian romance, and were linked more directly to Hamza&#x27;s own adventures, especially those of the earlier part of his life. Then came the fifth &quot;daftar&quot;, the &quot;Tilism-e Hoshruba&quot; itself, begun by Jah (four volumes) and completed by Qamar (three volumes). The remaining three &quot;daftars&quot;, though they make up the bulk of the cycle in quantity, emphasize the adventures of Hamza&#x27;s sons and grandsons, and are generally of less literary excellence. Though no library in the world has a full set of the forty-six volumes, a microfilm set at the Center for Research Libraries in Chicago is on the verge of completion. This immense cycle claims to be a translation of a (mythical) Persian original written by Faizi, one of the great literary figures of Akbar&#x27;s court; this claim is made repeatedly on frontispieces, and here and there within the text. Like this purported Persian original, the Urdu version thus contains exactly eight &quot;daftars&quot;—even though, as the Urdu cycle grew, the eighth &quot;daftar&quot; had to become longer and longer until it comprised twenty-seven volumes.

This astonishing treasure-house of romance, which at its best contains some of the finest narrative prose ever written in Urdu, is considered the delight of its age; many of its volumes were reprinted again and again, well into the twentieth century. Although towards the end of the nineteenth century dastans had reached an extraordinary peak of popularity, the fate of dastan literature was sealed by the first quarter of the twentieth century. By the time of the great dastan-narrator Mir Baqir Ali&#x27;s death in 1928, dastan volumes were being rejected by the educated elite in favor of Urdu and Hindi novels—many of which were in fact very dastan-like.

===Indonesian versions===

The &quot;Hikayat Amir Hamzah&quot; is the classical Malay version translated directly from the Persian originally written on traditional paper in old Jawi script. Versions are also found in other languages of Indonesia, including Javanese (&quot;Serat Menak&quot;), Sundanese (&quot;Amir Hamjah&quot;), Bugis, Balinese and Acehnese.

===Modern translations===
Two English-language translations have been published based on the 1871 Ghalib Lakhnavi and Abdullah Bilgrami version published by Munshi Nawal Kishore press. The first is an abridged translation called &quot;The Romance Tradition in Urdu&quot; by Frances Pritchett of Columbia University. It is available in an expanded version on the website of the translator. In 2008 Musharraf Ali Farooqi, a Pakistani-Canadian author, translated the Lakhnavi/Bilgrami version into English as &quot;The Adventures of Amir Hamza: Lord of the Auspicious Planetary Conjunction&quot;. He took seven years to translate this thousand-page adventure, producing a very close translation, without abridging the ornate passages.

A Pakistani author, Maqbool Jahangir, wrote &quot;Dastan-e-Amir Hamza&quot; for children in the Urdu language. His version contains 10 volumes and was published by Ferozsons (also Ferozsons Publishers).

==Synopsis==
===Dastan-e-Amir Hamza===
The collection of Hamza stories begins with a short section describing events that set the stage for the appearance of the central hero. In this case, the place is Ctesiphon (Madain) in Iraq, and the initial protagonist is Buzurjmehr, a child of humble parentage who displays both a remarkable ability to decipher ancient scripts and great acumen in political affairs. By luck and calculated design, Buzurjmehr displaces the current vizier, and attaches himself first to the reigning king, Kobad, and then to his successor, Naushervan. 
Nonetheless, a bitter rivalry has been seeded, for the widow of the wicked dead vizier bears a son she names Bakhtak Bakhtyar, and he in turn becomes a lifelong nemesis of both Hamza and Buzurjmehr. The latter soon relates a vision to Naushervan that a child still in embryo in Arabia will eventually bring about his downfall; Naushervan responds in Herod-like fashion, dispatching Buzurjmehr to Arabia with an order to kill all pregnant women. Emerging unscathed by this terrible threat are Hamza and Amar Umayya, who is destined to be Hamza&#x27;s faithful companion.

Unlike most Persian heroes, Hamza is not born to royalty, but is nonetheless of high birth, the son of the chief of Mecca. An auspicious horoscope prophesies an illustrious future for him. Hamza shows an early aversion to idol-worship, and with the aid of a supernatural instructor, develops a precocious mastery of various martial arts. He soon puts these skills to good use, defeating upstart warriors in individual combat, preventing the Yemeni army from interdicting tribute to Naushervan, and defending Mecca from predatory – but not religious – foes. Naushervan learns of these sundry exploits, and invites Hamza to his court, where he promises him his daughter Mihr Nigar in marriage. The girl is thrilled at this match, for she has long yearned for Hamza, and has had one soulful but chaste evening with him.

First, however, Naushervan sends Hamza to Ceylon to fend off a threat from Landhaur, and thence onto Greece, where Bakhtak Bakhtyar has insidiously poisoned the kings against him. Hamza, of course, proves his mettle in these and other tests, but his marriage to Mihr Nigar is forestalled by the treacherous Gostaham, who arranges her nuptials with another. Hamza is seriously wounded in battle with Zubin, Mihr Nigar&#x27;s prospective groom, and is rescued by the vazir of the pari king Shahpal, ruler of the realm of Qaf. In return for this act of kindness, Hamza gallantly agrees to subdue the rebellious elephant-eared Devs who have seized Shahpal&#x27;s kingdom. The whole expedition to Qaf is to take eighteen days, and Hamza insists on fulfilling this debt of honor before his wedding. However, he is destined to be detained in Qaf not for eighteen days, but for eighteen years.

At this point, the shape of the story radically changes: adventures take place simultaneously in Qaf and on earth, and the dastan moves back and forth in reporting them. While Hamza in Qaf is killing Devs, trying to deal with Shahpal&#x27;s powerful daughter Asman Pari whom he has been forced to marry, and looking desperately for ways to get home, Amar in the (human) World is holding Hamza&#x27;s forces together, moving from fort to fort, and trying to defend Mihr Nigar from Naushervan&#x27;s efforts to recapture her.

While Hamza and his allies navigate various shoals of courtly intrigue, they also wage a prolonged war against infidels. Although the ostensible goal of these conflicts is to eradicate idolatry and convert opponents to Islam, the latter is usually related with little fanfare at the end of the episode. Champions often proclaim their faith in Allah as they take to the battlefield, and sometimes reproach unbelievers for failing to grasp that the Muslims&#x27; past military success is prima facie evidence of the righteousness of their cause.

After eighteen years, much suffering, and more divine intervention, Hamza does finally escape from Qaf; he makes his way home, and is reunited with his loyal companions. In the longest and most elaborate scene in the dastan, he marries the faithful Mihr Nigar. But by this time, the story is nearing its end. About two-fifths of the text deals with Hamza&#x27;s early years, about two-fifths with the years in Qaf, and only one-fifth with the time after his return. The remaining years of Hamza&#x27;s long life are filled with activity; some of it is fruitful, but usually in a kind of equivocal way. Hamza and Mihr Nigar have one son, Qubad, who is killed at an early age; soon afterwards, Mihr Nigar herself is killed.

Hamza, distraught, vows to spend the rest of his life tending her tomb. But his enemies pursue him there, kidnap him, and torment him; his old companions rally round to rescue him, and his old life reclaims him. He fights against Naushervan and others, travels, has adventures, marries a series of wives. His sons and grandsons by various wives appear one by one, perform heroic feats, and frequently die young. He and Amar have a brief but traumatic quarrel. Toward the very end of his life he must enter the Dark Regions, pursuing a series of frightful cannibal kings; while their incursions are directly incited by Naushervan, Amar&#x27;s own act of vicarious cannibalism seems somehow implicated as well.

Almost all Hamza&#x27;s army is lost in the Dark Regions, and he returns in a state of grief and desolation. Finally, he is summoned by the Prophet, his nephew, back to Mecca to beat off an attack by the massed infidel armies of the world. He succeeds, losing all his companions except Amar in the process, but dies at the hands of the woman Hindah, whose son he had killed. She devours his liver, cuts his body into seventy pieces, then hastily accepts Islam to save herself. The Prophet and the angels pray over every piece of the body, and Hamzah is rewarded with the high celestial rank of Commander of the Faithful.

===Tilism-e Hoshruba===
In this new tale, Amir Hamza&#x27;s adventures bring him to Hoshruba, a magical world or &quot;tilism&quot;. The tilism of Hoshruba was conjured by sorcerers in defiance of Allah and the laws of the physical world. However, being a creation of magic, Hoshruba is not a permanent world. At the moment of its creation a person was named who would unravel this magical world at an appointed time using the tilism key.

With the passage of time, the whereabouts of the tilism key were forgotten, and the usurper Afrasiyab became the Master of the Tilism and Emperor of Sorcerers. Afrasiyab and his sorceress Empress Heyrat ruled over Hoshruba&#x27;s three regions named Zahir the Manifest, Batin the Hidden, and Zulmat the Dark, which contained countless dominions and smaller tilisms governed by sorcerer kings and sorceress queens, and where the dreaded Seven Monsters of the Grotto lurked.

Emperor Afrasiyab was among the seven immortal sorcerers of Hoshruba who could not be killed while their counterparts lived. His fortune came to reveal itself on the palms of his hands. His left hand warned him of inauspicious moments and the right hand revealed auspicious ones. Whenever anyone called out his name in the tilism, Afrasiyab&#x27;s magic alerted him to the call. He possessed the Book of Sameri that contained an account of every event inside and outside the tilism. Afrasiyab used a magic mirror that projected his body into his court during his absence, and many magic doubles who replaced him when he was in imminent danger. Besides sorcerers and sorceresses, the emperor also commanded magic slaves and magic slave girls who fought at his command and performed any and all tasks assigned them.

As Hoshruba&#x27;s time neared its end, Emperor Afrasiyab resolved to defend his empire and tilism, and foil the conqueror of the tilism when he appeared. The story of Hoshruba opens where the false god Laqa—an eighty-five-foot-tall, pitch-black giant – and one of Amir Hamza&#x27;s foremost enemies – is in flight after suffering a fresh defeat at Amir Hamza&#x27;s hands. He and his supporters arrive near Hoshruba and solicit the aid of the Emperor of Sorcerers.

Before long, Amir Hamza&#x27;s armies pursuing Laqa find themselves at war with Afrasiyab and his army of sorcerers. When hostilities break out Amir Hamza&#x27;s grandson, Prince Asad, is the designated conqueror of the tilism of Hoshruba. Prince Asad sets out at the head of a magnificent army to conquer Hoshruba. With him are five matchless tricksters headed by the prince of tricksters, the incomparable Amar Ayyar, whose native wit, and wondrous talents are a match for the most powerful sorcerer&#x27;s spells.

Upon learning of Prince Asad&#x27;s entry into the tilism with his army, Afrasiyab dispatches a number of sorcerers and five beautiful trickster girls to foil his mission. When the trickster girls kidnap the prince, Amar Ayyar and his band of misfits continue the mission of the conqueror of the tilism with the help of Heyrat&#x27;s sister, Bahar Jadu, a powerful sorceress of the tilism, who Afrasiyab had banished from his court to please his wife.

==Cultural influence==

The immense popularity of the dastan had a long-lasting effect on other forms of fictional narratives. The earliest novels in Urdu as well as Hindi often seem nothing more than simplified or bowdlerized forms of Dastans. Babu Devaki Nandan Khatri&#x27;s &quot;Chandrakanta&quot; and &quot;Chandrakanta Santati&quot; and Ratan Nath Dhar Sarshar&#x27;s &quot;Fasana-e-Azad&quot; are only the two most stellar examples of this genre. Chandrakanta bears the direct influence of dastans as witnessed in the case of eponymous protagonist Chandrakanta who is trapped in a tilism and the presence of notable ayyars. The dastan also influenced Munshi Premchand (1880-1936) who was fascinated and later on inspired by the stories of &quot;Tilism-e Hoshruba&quot; that he heard at the tobacconist shop in his childhood days. The conventions of the dastan narrative also conditioned Urdu theatre: the trickster Ayyar, permanent friend of Hamza provided the convention of the hero&#x27;s [comic] sidekick that achieved culmination in the Hindi cinema of the sixties.

The story is also performed in Indonesian puppet theatre, where it is called &quot;Wayang Menak&quot;. Here, Hamza is also known as Wong Agung Jayeng Rana or Amir Ambyah.

Frances Pritchett&#x27;s former student at Columbia University, Pasha Mohamad Khan, who currently teaches at McGill University, researches qissa/dastan (romances) and the art of dastan-goi (storytelling), including the &quot;Hamzanama&quot;.

<text>The Circus is a historic ring of large townhouses in the city of Bath, Somerset, England, forming a circle with three entrances. Designed by architect John Wood, the Elder, it was built between 1754 and 1768, and is regarded as a pre-eminent example of Georgian architecture. &quot;Circus&quot; (Latin) means a ring, oval or circle in English. The construction has been designated as a Grade I listed building.

The Circus is divided into three segments of equal length, with a lawn in the centre. Each segment faces one of the three entrances, ensuring a classical façade is always presented straight ahead.

==History==
The Circus, originally called the King&#x27;s Circus, was designed by the architect John Wood, the Elder. Convinced that Bath had been the principal centre of Druid activity in Britain, Wood surveyed Stonehenge, which has a diameter of at the outer earth bank, and designed the Circus with a diameter to mimic this.

Wood died less than three months after the first stone was laid; his son, John Wood, the Younger, completed the project to his father&#x27;s design. The initial leases for the south west segment were granted in 1755–1767, for the south east segment in 1762–1766, and for the north segment in 1764–1766.

The Circus was part of John Wood the Elder&#x27;s grand vision to recreate a classical Palladian architectural landscape for the city. Other projects included nearby Queen Square and the never-built Forum. The culmination of Wood&#x27;s career, the Circus is considered his masterpiece.

The painter Thomas Gainsborough lived in Number 17 between 1758 and 1774, using part of its space as his portrait studio. Number 15 was home to Admiral Sir Richard Bickerton and his family in the first half of the 19th century.

During the Bath Blitz of 25/26 April 1942, one of the Baedeker Blitz retaliatory raids on England following the Royal Air Force&#x27;s raid on Lübeck, a bomb fell into the Circus, demolishing several of the houses. These have since been reconstructed in the original style.

Architectural historian Dan Cruickshank selected the Circus as one of his five choices for the 2002 BBC television documentary series &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Buildings&quot;.

==Design==
Three Classical orders (Greek Doric, Roman/Composite and Corinthian) are used, one above the other, in the elegant curved facades. The frieze of the Doric entablature is decorated with alternating triglyphs and 525 pictorial emblems, including serpents, nautical symbols, devices representing the arts and sciences, and Masonic symbols. The parapet is adorned with stone acorn finials.

When viewed from the air, the Circus, along with Queen Square and the adjoining Gay Street, form a key shape, which is a masonic symbol similar to those that adorn many of Wood&#x27;s buildings.

The central area was originally paved with stone setts, covering a reservoir in the centre that supplied water to the houses. In 1800 the Circus residents enclosed the central part of the open space as a garden. Now, the central area is grassed over and is home to a group of five large plane trees, which are believed to date to around 1820. They are contributing factors to the Grade I listing of The Circus.

<text>Curiosity Killed the Cat were a British pop band formed in London in 1984, comprising singer Ben Volpeliere-Pierrot, guitarist Julian Godfrey Brookhouse, bassist Nick Thorpe and drummer Migi Drummond. The band achieved success in the UK in the late 1980s, with their debut album &quot;Keep Your Distance&quot; reaching No. 1 in 1987 and producing three top 20 hit singles in &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, &quot;Misfit&quot; and &quot;Ordinary Day&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Getahead&quot; in 1989, with another UK top 20 single &quot;Name and Number&quot;. 

In 1991, Thorpe left the band, with the remaining three members continuing under the shortened name Curiosity for their third and final album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Back to Front&quot;, which included the UK top 5 single &quot;Hang On in There Baby&quot;. The band split in 1994 although there have been occasional temporary reunions.

==Career==
The band played soulful, jazzy and funky pop music, and was initially signed to Mercury Records. They first came to notice of the UK music press when they worked with Andy Warhol for the video of their 1986 single &quot;Misfit&quot;. This featured the band in New York City and at one point featured frontman Ben Volpeliere-Pierrot dancing down a side street whilst Andy Warhol referenced Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1965 long-form promotional film for &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; by dropping pieces of white card in time to the music.

The single was initially unsuccessful but the release of their next single, &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, gave the band a top 3 hit in early 1987. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Keep Your Distance&quot;, entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 1 in April 1987, and stayed in the top ten for 13 weeks. Further singles included &quot;Ordinary Day&quot; (UK No. 11), &quot;Free&quot; (UK No. 56) and a re-release of &quot;Misfit&quot; (UK No. 7). &quot;Misfit&quot; was also their only U.S. charting single, peaking at No. 42.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Getahead&quot;, was released in 1989, led by the single &quot;Name and Number&quot; (UK No. 14), and its &quot;hey how you doin&#x27;&quot; refrain found itself in the top 10 two years later interpolated in the De La Soul song &quot;Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)&quot;. The album, however, was not as successful in comparison to their first album, peaking at No. 29.

After the lacklustre performance of &quot;Getahead&quot; and its second single &quot;First Place&quot;, the band shortened their name to &#x27;Curiosity&#x27; but were dropped by Mercury Records. Bass player Nick Thorpe then left the band. However, in 1992, the band (now a three-piece and signed to RCA Records) returned to the UK Top 3 with a cover of Johnny Bristol&#x27;s &quot;Hang On in There Baby&quot;. Despite this, the band&#x27;s follow up singles (covers of &quot;I Need Your Lovin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Gimme the Sunshine&quot;) were unsuccessful, which resulted in the album &quot;Back to Front&quot; only being released in Japan and selected overseas markets in 1994. The band then split up.

In 2001, the band reformed for an appearance on a National Lottery midweek show on BBC 1, and since then Volpeliere has toured under the name Curiosity Killed the Cat, on a number of 1980s revival packages.

In November 2015, a compilation album, called &quot;80&#x27;s Recovered&quot; featured many groups. Curiosity Killed the Cat did a cover of the Doobie Brothers track &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;&quot;, with a regular version, and a remix.

==Band members==
* Ben Volpeliere-Pierrot – vocals (born Martin Benedict Volpeliere-Pierrot, 19 May 1965, Earls Court, London)
* Julian Godfrey Brookhouse – guitar (born 15 May 1963, Putney, London)
* Nick Thorpe – bass guitar, keyboards (born Nicholas Bernard Thorp, 25 October 1964, Sunbury-on-Thames, Middlesex)
* Migi Drummond – drums (born Miguel John Drummond, 27 January 1964, Strawberry Hill, Middlesex)

Lead singer Ben Volpeliere-Pierrot was best known for wearing a beret in most pictures of the band. He later revealed it was in fact a peaked fisherman&#x27;s hat, turned round with the peak to the rear so that it resembled a beret. Ben VP (as he was billed on a number of solo singles in the mid-1990s) was frequently referred to as &#x27;Ben Vol-au-vent Parrot&#x27; in &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine, with &#x27;Bendy Ben&#x27; (or &#x27;Boozy Ben&#x27;) also used. He also appeared as a model on the front of Mike Read&#x27;s &quot;Pop Quiz&quot; board game.

In 1995, Migi Drummond and Nick Thorp set up Naked Records which was acquired a year later by software maker Eidos Plc.

Toby Andersen co-wrote all tracks and played keyboards on the album &quot;Keep Your Distance&quot;. Session guitarist/keyboard player Mike McEvoy (Michael J McEvoy) co-wrote the songs on their &quot;Getahead&quot; album and Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro played on three tracks (&quot;Cascade&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Grow Trees on Money&quot; and &quot;Who Are You&quot;).

<text>Esparto, halfah grass, or esparto grass is a fiber produced from two species of perennial grasses of north Africa, Spain and Portugal. It is used for crafts, such as cords, basketry, and espadrilles. &quot;Stipa tenacissima&quot; and &quot;Lygeum spartum&quot; are the species used to produce esparto.

&quot;Stipa tenacissima&quot; (&quot;Macrochloa tenacissima&quot;) produces the better and stronger esparto. It is endemic to the Mediterranean region (growing in Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt). Another name in Spanish for the plant is &quot;atocha,&quot; a pre-Roman word. &quot;Esparto&quot; or σπάρτο in Greek may refer to any woven products of sedge or broom, including cords and ropes. This species grows forming a steppic landscape – esparto grasslands – which covers large parts of Spain and Algeria.

==History==

Esparto leaves have been used for millennia. The oldest baskets of esparto, dating back 7,000 years, were found in a cave in southern Spain (Cueva de los Murciélagos, Albuñol, Granada). This collection is now in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain. There are many esparto remains in archaeological settlements from as long ago as the Neolithic period, including rugs, ropes, clothes, etc. Iberians used esparto rugs as floor coverings. For Greeks, Phoenicians and Romans, esparto was the best raw material for boat ropes. For centuries, esparto grasslands have been managed by local populations in order to boost the harvest, due to its economic value. In southern Spain there is an &quot;Esparto culture&quot;: a deep knowledge about the many uses of this fiber forms part of the traditions of these communities. After the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), esparto was declared a &quot;national fiber&quot;; there was even a National Esparto Service. The opening of markets to other fibers and plastics eventually led to the decline of the esparto industry.

== Application ==
Esparto leaves are traditionally harvested with a stick; usually of wood or iron, but in ancient times, of bone. The stick is used to pull up a handful of leaves at a time. The esparto is not normally used immediately after harvesting. Instead, the leaves are left to dry in the sun until they turn yellowish. This is the raw esparto, which is used for different basketry techniques. An alternative is to soak the leaves in water for about a month, before drying and then crushing them. This material is known as &quot;crushed esparto&quot;, which is stronger and easier to weave.
The main techniques are:
* Plaited esparto: people weave a long strip of raw esparto or crushed esparto. The artifact is made by sewing this strip in different ways. Every kind of plait has a different name. Examples (in Spanish) include the &quot;pleita&quot; (with raw esparto) and the &quot;recincho&quot; (with crushed esparto), but there is a rich Spanish vocabulary for the techniques and artifacts of the esparto craft. In many cases, different terms are used in different regions. Mainly, this vocabulary belongs to the Castilian and Catalan dialects of Valencia.
All techniques involve working with an odd number of strands, from 5 to 31 or more.
* Coiled esparto: sewing many esparto leaves into a spiral, every turn over the former one.
* Twinning esparto: similar to wicker basketry.
* Cofin braiding: a typical stitch to make &quot;cofines&quot;, a swallow basket used formerly in the olive oil mills to press the olive mass
* Snail basket stitch: this is a special stitch to make snail baskets, a specific basket to pick snails.
* Espadrilles: the former peasant footwear of southern Spain. These are made with crushed esparto.

There are many complementary techniques to end the baskets, square braids, cord edging, crown sinnet, points, etc. In the finest pieces, all leaves used must be the same size and diameter, and must always be joined in parallel.

Traditionally, esparto basketry has not been a professional product. Shepherds, farmers and other people of the countryside used to plait esparto on rainy days or in times not suitable for working.

Most craft tools and artifacts in the southern Spanish countryside for farming and livestock were made with esparto, such as harvesting baskets, items for the home, and containers/sacks for carts, horses, and donkeys.
There is a huge variety of items, many of which are well known and have a specific use, but others are the product of a special personal need or a free creation, such as toys for children or animals. Every kind of basket has a special name that describes its use. For example, a &quot;cesto rosero&quot; is a basket used traditionally to gather saffron flowers.

A special esparto basketry piece is the esparto canteen. Made with crushed esparto and waterproofed with pine pitch, they were used by the shepherds of southeastern Spain to carry water in the mountains. The Archaeological Museum of Cartagena has an example of a Roman esparto canteen two thousand years old.
Esparto was also used for making slingshots. In ancient times these were used as weapons of war, but could also be used for hunting or by shepherds to protect their livestock.

A wide strip of plaited raw esparto, named &quot;pleita&quot; in Spanish, is the traditional mold for Manchego cheese.

Another important use of esparto is in rope-making. Ropes could be made with raw esparto, crushed esparto or raked esparto (after crushed). A special rope was used to tie cereal bunches in harvest time. Other were used in vernacular architecture to tie reeds to the timber in roof building.

== Paper ==
Esparto grass is known for its use in papermaking. The fiber makes a high quality paper often used in book manufacturing. First used in Great Britain in 1850 by Thomas Routledge who imported it from southern Spain, and it was greatly exploited by Edward Lloyd at his paper mills at Bow-Bridge and Sittingbourne from the 1860s. Lloyd imported his raw materials from Oran and Arzew in Algeria. It has been extensively used in the UK and Europe, but due to transportation costs, it is rarely found in the United States. Most paper made from esparto is usually combined with 5% to 10% wood pulp.

The fibers are fairly short in relation to their width, yet do not create any significant amount of dust. Because of the short fiber length, the tensile strength of the paper is less than that of many other papers, but its resistance to shrinkage and stretching is superior, and the paper is a well-filled, dense paper with excellent inking qualities. It also has very good folding properties.

Some manufacturers of rolling paper may use esparto, which might lead to a slightly higher carcinogen level when burned.

==Other uses==
The old leaves, which are under the plant, were used to make the traditional torches of southern Spain, named &quot;hachos&quot;. They are also used by beekeepers to produce smoke while taking honey from the hives.
Shepherds would sometimes weave a makeshift spoon from esparto leaves to eat curdle.

<text>WALR-FM (104.1 MHz &quot;Kiss 104.1&quot;) is a commercial radio station licensed to Palmetto, Georgia and serving Metro Atlanta. It is owned by the Cox Media Group and airs an urban adult contemporary radio format. The studios are co-located with other Cox-owned radio stations and WSB-TV in Midtown Atlanta on West Peachtree Street.

WALR-FM is a Class C1 station with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts. The transmitter is on Duncan Memorial Highway (Route 166) in Winston, Georgia. WALR-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. Its HD2 digital subchannel carries a dance music format known as &quot;The Surge.&quot;

==Programming==
Mornings begin with Atlanta radio legend Frank Rodriguez, known professionally as Frank Ski. Middays are hosted by Dyron Ducati, followed by British rapper Monie Love in afternoons. In the evening, a &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; show is heard until midnight. On Sunday mornings, ordained minister Twanda Black hosts an urban gospel program. In 2018, Terri Avery became the Program Director.

==History==
===Early years===
On September 1, 1947, the station first signed on as WLAG-FM. Its city of license was LaGrange, Georgia, about southwest of Atlanta and near the Alabama border. It was the FM counterpart to WLAG 1240 AM, owned by the LaGrange Broadcasting Company. Both stations simulcast a country music format. WLAG-FM&#x27;s power was 29,500 watts and the antenna height was , so it was not heard in the Atlanta area. The station changed its call sign to WWCG in 1977 and continued with a country format.

In the early 1980s, the station got a big boost in power. It increased to 100,000 watts, using a tower taller than the Empire State Building, giving it coverage of much of the Atlanta radio market. It began broadcasting Al Ham&#x27;s syndicated &quot;Music Of Your Life&quot; adult standards format with call signs WJYF and WJYA-FM, a simulcast partner with WJYA (1080 AM).

In 1985, it was acquired by Zapis Communications, headed by Lee Zapis. In 1987, he switched the format to urban contemporary as WEKS, &quot;Urban Kiss 104.&quot;

Zapis then sold the station to NewCity Communications in 1989. NewCity had a plan to pair two different FM stations surrounding Atlanta to create one facility covering the market. To bring attention to the change, on June 21, WEKS went silent. The station signed back on the air on June 28, and began stunting with music played by local celebrities, including then-Atlanta mayor Andrew Young. Finally, at 3 p.m. on June 30, WEKS switched back to country music as WYAI (&quot;Y104&quot;), simulcasting with WYAY FM (Y106.7) on the other side of Atlanta. The two stations began competing with long-time Atlanta country leader WKHX.

On January 1, 1994, the simulcast ended, with 104.1 flipping to a smooth jazz format as &quot;Jazz Flavors 104.1&quot;. In addition, the station changed calls to WJZF to match the new branding.

Cox Enterprises, owner of WSB, WSB-FM, WSB-TV and two newspapers, entered into a local marketing agreement (LMA) with WJZF. Cox tried to buy the station in 1995. However, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) denied the request when challenged by Jacor Broadcasting, even though Cox intended to make changes to the WJZF signal &quot;to avoid cross-ownership conflicts.&quot;

===WALR &quot;Kiss 104&quot;===
The station that would later migrate to this frequency began in 1964 in Athens, Georgia as WDOL-FM at 104.7 MHz. At first it simulcast its AM sister station, 1370 WDOL. It later began airing separate programming, first as &quot;Love 104,&quot; then as &quot;Kiss 104.7&quot;, an urban contemporary station. (This new &quot;Kiss&quot; on 104.7 was a resurrection of the previous incarnation from WEKS mentioned above, although it only covered the eastern suburbs of the Atlanta market, from its Athens tower.)

On August 30, 2000, Cox and Salem Communications swapped frequencies. &quot;Kiss 104.7&quot; migrated to the 104.1 frequency, previously a Christian Contemporary music station known as &quot;The Fish.&quot; The former WALR-FM at 104.7 became &quot;104.7 the Fish&quot; WFSH-FM and the 104.1 frequency became Hot Urban AC, &quot;Kiss 104.1,&quot; taking the WALR-FM call sign. The smooth jazz format was picked up the following year by WJZZ (now WAMJ). Also, the AM simulcast on what is now WIFN ceased shortly after the switch although it continued to carry the WALR call sign under a changed format for some time. In Atlanta, the rights to the &quot;Kiss FM&quot; brand had been grandfathered; thus Clear Channel Communications (later iHeart), which trademarked the brand for its Top 40 stations, heard in many U.S. cities such as Los Angeles and Boston, did not attempt to take legal action against Cox.

===Switch to urban oldies===
On February 21, 2003, WALR-FM switched to Urban Oldies, while retaining the &quot;Kiss&quot; branding. Cox wanted to draw a distinction between &quot;Kiss&quot; and co-owned WFOX (97.1 FM). At the time, WFOX experimented with a format consisting of R&amp;B, hip hop and rap music from the 1980s to present. With the format shift, WALR-FM&#x27;s longtime slogan changed from &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s R&amp;B Station&quot; to &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Old School R&amp;B Station&quot;.

In late 2004, WALR switched to a new tower, closer to Atlanta. It also began broadcasting in IBOC digital radio, using the HD Radio system from iBiquity.

WALR-FM became the last Atlanta station owned by Cox Radio targeting the African-American audience. On August 16, 2010, co-owned WBTS flipped from rhythmic contemporary to WSBB-FM, a news-talk simulcast of WSB. Previously, co-owned WFOX had played urban contemporary music as &quot;97.1 Jamz&quot; until 2006, when it flipped to classic hits and classic rock as WSRV &quot;The River.&quot;

===Return to urban AC===
In June 2011, WALR-FM shifted back to urban AC; the station added more contemporary R&amp;B music and dropped some of the older titles, after spending eight years as a classic and gold-based R&amp;B and soul music format. This helped WALR-FM increase its listeners, especially against longtime CBS-owned WVEE and direct format rival WAMJ/WUMJ. WALR-FM&#x27;s logo and slogan were modified as well from &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Old School R&amp;B Station&quot; to &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s R&amp;B&quot;; in addition, the station&#x27;s branding was shortened to simply &quot;Kiss 104&quot;, omitting the &quot;.1&quot;. At the same time, WALR-FM dropped all weekend mix shows, and expanded its nighttime slow jams show. As of February 2012, the station has not been listed on the Mediabase urban AC add board.

In 2017, WALR-FM changed its city of license from LaGrange to Palmetto, Georgia, a suburban community about 15 miles southwest of downtown Atlanta. WALR-FM had been the longtime Atlanta affiliate for &quot;The Tom Joyner Morning Show&quot; and also carried the syndicated &quot;Michael Baisden Show&quot; in afternoons. The morning drive time show was replaced with Art Terrell and comedian Roy Wood Jr. on November 27, 2017. Wood decided to concentrate on his TV appearances and was replaced by Cory &quot;Zooman&quot; Miller. Baisden&#x27;s show was replaced by Sasha the Diva, who in turn was replaced by British rapper Monie Love in afternoons.

<text>Robert Markham is a pseudonym used by author Kingsley Amis to publish &quot;Colonel Sun&quot; in March 1968. The book was the first continuation James Bond novel following the death of Bond&#x27;s creator, Ian Fleming.

==Kingsley Amis==
Following the death of Ian Fleming on 12 August 1964, the rights to the Bond novels were held by Glidrose Publications (now Ian Fleming Publications). After Glidrose released the remaining Fleming works—&quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; and &quot;Octopussy and The Living Daylights&quot;—they decided to commission a sequel in order to retain rights in the Bond product. They chose Amis to write the first continuation Bond novel; Amis had previously produced &quot;The James Bond Dossier&quot;—a critical analysis of the Bond books—under his own name, and &quot;The Book of Bond&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek manual for prospective agents, using the pseudonym Lt.-Col. William (&quot;Bill&quot;) Tanner.

For the pseudonym, Peter Fleming - Ian Fleming&#x27;s brother - initially suggested &quot;George Glidrose&quot;. Jonathan Cape rejected this name, claiming that it had no selling or publicity power. Markham was then chosen. Despite this, Amis&#x27;s involvement as continuation author was not a secret; American editions of the book identified Amis as the author, though the main Robert Markham credit remained.

==Future ideas==
Amis had unhappily visited Mexico in January 1968. From this experience grew the idea for another Bond story. According to the New York Times Book Review, &quot;Mr. Amis never moves about by air, and cultivated his own deficiencies - his phrase - he went from St. Louis to Mexico City by train. En route, he remembered that Bond loved trains (&quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;) and found himself plotting an assassination on a train. Then as his train moved on, there occurred the inevitable sentence, &quot;Bond had never liked Acapulco.&quot;&quot; The plot would centre around tensions between British Honduras and Guatemala over rival claims to Mexico. A syndicated Associated Press story also implied that Amis may kill Bond off for good. According to the article, a bazooka-wielding bartender would blast Bond on a train in Mexico.

Amis was inconsistent if this would result in a novel or a short story. The 1970 Associated Press story claimed it would be Amis&#x27;s next book. However, in a 1968 letter to Robert Conquest, Amis clearly states that it would only be a short story. Amis also approached Glidrose with an idea for a Bond short story that would have featured a 70-year-old Bond coming out of retirement for one final mission, but permission was not granted.

<text>Peter Wallace Rodino Jr. (born Pelligrino Rodino Jr.; June 7, 1909 – May 7, 2005) was an American politician who was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1949 to 1989. A liberal Democrat, he represented parts of Newark, New Jersey and surrounding Essex and Hudson. He was the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives from New Jersey until passed by Chris Smith in 2021.

Rodino rose to prominence as the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, where he oversaw the 1974 impeachment hearings against President Richard Nixon that eventually led to the president&#x27;s resignation.

==Early life==
Rodino was born Pelligrino Rodino Jr. in the North Ward of Newark, New Jersey, on June 7, 1909. His father, Pelligrino Rodino (1883–1957), was born in Atripalda, a town in the province of Avellino, in a region of southern Italy known as Campania. Rodino Sr. emigrated to the United States around 1900 and worked as a machinist in a leather factory, as a cabinet maker and carpenter, and for thirty years as a toolmaker for General Motors (Hyatt Roller Bearing). His mother, Giuseppina (Margaret) Girard (1884–1913), was born in Newark. Pelligrino and Giuseppina were married in 1900. Pelligrino Rodino Jr., whose name was later &quot;Americanized&quot; to Peter, was the youngest of three children. Giuseppina Rodino died in 1913 of tuberculosis, when Rodino was 4; his father later married Antonia (Gemma) DeRobertis (Died 1944), the widow of Michael Paladino.

He attended McKinley Grammar School, graduating in February 1922. He attended Barringer High School. He went to college at the University of Newark and earned a law degree at the Newark Law School; both are now part of Rutgers University. His speech was badly affected by a childhood bout of diphtheria, and he conducted his own speech therapy, spending hours &quot;reciting Shakespeare through a mouth full of marbles&quot;. Rodino endured ten years of menial jobs while studying at night for a law degree at the New Jersey Law School. He worked for the Public Service Railroad and Transportation Company. Rodino worked as an insurance salesman and at Pennsylvania Railroad. He also worked at Ronson Art Metal Works making cigarette lighters. He taught public speaking and citizenship in Newark. He also worked as a songwriter.

Rodino served in the administration of President Franklin Roosevelt as an appeals agent for the Newark Draft Board. While the post exempted Rodino from the draft, he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1941, and served from 1942 to 1946. Rodino attended the British Officers Training University of England and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He was assigned to the First Armored Division in North Africa, and later in Italy with the Military Mission Italian Army, a joint Allied force. Due to his fluency in Italian, he was named the adjutant to the Commanding General of Rome. He earned a Bronze Star for service in Italy and North Africa; he was discharged with the rank of captain.

==State assembly candidate==
In 1940, Rodino made his first bid for public office as a Democratic candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly from Essex County. He lost the general election.

==U.S. Congressman==
In 1946, after World War II, Rodino ran for Congress against nine-term Republican incumbent Fred A. Hartley Jr. Hartley was nationally prominent as the House sponsor of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, known as Taft–Hartley. Hartley won by 5,730 votes, 44,619 (52.48%) to 38,889 (45.74%).

Hartley declined to seek re-election in 1948 and Rodino became a candidate for the open 10th district congressional seat. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary. In the general election, he faced Republican Anthony Giuliano, who had served as a State Assemblyman and as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. Rodino had the benefit of running on a ticket with president Harry Truman, who carried Essex and Hudson counties. Truman, campaigning in Newark on October 6, 1948, endorsed Rodino, saying: &quot;That means that here in Newark you&#x27;re going to send Rodino to the Congress, and Hugh Addonizio and Harry Dudkin to the House of Representatives. Every one of these men deserves your support. They will fight your battle in Washington, and how that fight needs to be made nobody knows better than I do. They will fight your battle there, and men like them all over the Nation will be fighting that battle—and will win that battle if you&#x27;re behind us—the battle for the people, a fight which started with Jefferson, continued with Jackson, was won by Franklin Roosevelt in 1934.&quot; Rodino won by 5,800 votes, 58,668 (50.72%) to 52,868 (45.70%).

Seeking a second term in 1950, Rodino faced Republican William H. Rawson, a six-term Essex County Freeholder. Rodino won by 21,819 votes: 60,432 (61.02%) to 38,613 (38.99%).

In 1952, Rodino faced a national political environment that was decidedly Republican, and GOP presidential candidate Dwight Eisenhower carried Rodino&#x27;s district by a large margin. But Rodino won a third term by 20,872 votes against Republican Alexander Matturri, 78,612 (56.87%) to 57,740 (41.77%).

Rodino defeated Republican William E. McGlynn, a two-term Councilman from Kearny, New Jersey who described himself as a &quot;middle of the road Eisenhower Republican&quot; by 26,328 votes, 62,384 (63.37%) to 36,056 (36.63%) in 1954.

In 1956, Rodino was re-elected by 15,550 votes, 71,311 (56.12%) to 55,761 (43.88%), against Republican G. George Addonizio, a first time candidate who had the same last name as a popular Democratic Congressman who was seeking re-election in a neighboring Essex County congressional district; George Addonizio and Hugh Addonizio were not related. George Addonizio cast himself as an Eisenhower Republican in a year the popular Republican president carried Rodino&#x27;s district by a wide margin in his re-election campaign. This was the last time Rodino&#x27;s general election percentage would fall below 60%. In a 1958 rematch with Addonizio, he won by 27,536 votes, 60,482 (63.90%) to 32,946 (34.81%). Rodino won 65% in 1960 and 73% in 1962.

He was re-elected in 1960 with 65% against Alphonse A. Miele, and in 1962 with 73% against Dr. Charles Allen Baretski, the Director of the Newark Public Library and the founder of the Institute of Polish Culture at Seton Hall University. In 1964, he defeated former Bloomfield Councilman Raymond W. Schroeder with 74% of the vote.

Rodino faced his first African American opponent in 1966, when Earl Harris, a Republican Essex County Freeholder (and future Newark city council president) ran against him. In a Democratic landslide year nationally and in New Jersey, Rodino beat Harris with 64% of the vote.

He was re-elected in 1968 (64% against Dr. Celestino Clemente, a surgeon), 1970 (70% against Griffin H. Jones, a Montclair lawyer), 1972 (80% against bakery owner Kenneth Miller), 1974 (81% against Newark-South Ward Republican Chairman John R. Taliaferro), 1976 (83% against Tony Grandison), 1978 (86% against John L. Pelt, an auto salesman), 1980 (85% against East Orange businessman Everett Jennings), 1982 (83% against Tim Lee), 1984 (84% against conservative activist Howard E. Berkeley), and 1986 (96%, with no Republican in the race).

For many years, Rodino shared a Washington apartment with Hugh Addonizio, a fellow Newark Democrat who was also elected to Congress in 1948 as a young World War II veteran. After Addonizio left Congress to become Mayor of Newark in 1962, Rodino became roommates with Addonizio&#x27;s successor, Democratic labor leader Joseph Minish. Rodino returned to his district every weekend.

===Democratic primary challenges===
From the 1970s onward, Rodino&#x27;s main challenge was in the Democratic primary. This was mainly because the cities anchoring his district, such as Newark, East Orange, Irvington, and Orange, saw substantial growth of African American populations as white voters moved to the suburbs. In 1972, the 10th district was redrawn as a black majority district. Rodino, who had spent a career fighting on behalf of civil rights, was now a white congressman in a district that was drawn to increase African American representation in Congress.

In 1972, Rodino faced his first serious challenge from an African American candidate in the Democratic primary. He considered moving into the neighboring 11th district, which lost its black, urban municipalities in redistricting and instead included suburban Essex County towns (including a slice of Rodino&#x27;s former territory); this would have forced a primary against Rodino&#x27;s colleague (and Capitol Hill roommate), Joseph Minish. While many of Rodino&#x27;s political advisers urged him to run in the 11th, Rodino decided to remain in the 10th and face two African American candidates: East Orange Mayor William S. Hart and former Assemblyman George C. Richardson of Newark Rodino beat Hart by 13,000 votes, 37,650 (57%) to 24,118 (37%). Richardson finished third with 3,086 votes (5%) and Wilburt Kornegy received 718 votes (1%).

Rodino faced another serious primary challenge in 1980, this time against Donald M. Payne, a former Essex County Freeholder who had carried the 10th district in his campaign for the Democratic nomination for Essex County Executive in 1978. At this point, Rodino was a national political figure and beat Payne by 17,118 votes, 26,943 (62.17%) to 9,825 (22.67%). Former Newark Municipal Court Judge Golden Johnson finished third with 5,316 votes (12.27%), followed by 1,251 (2.89%) for Rev. Russell E. Fox, a former Essex County Freeholder and East Orange school board member.

Payne ran again in 1986, and had the endorsements of newly elected Newark Mayor Sharpe James and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Rodino promised to retire in 1988 and beat Payne by 9,920 votes, 25,136 (59.49%) to 15,216 (36.01%). Payne was elected in 1988 and was re-elected eleven times without substantive opposition, never dropping below 75% of the vote and died in office on March 6, 2012.
==Legislative record==
During his first term, Rodino was a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. After winning re-election in 1950, he was assigned a seat on the House Judiciary Committee. He worked to enact legislation to assure equal rights, reform immigration policy and public safety. He was the author of majority reports on civil rights legislation of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, was the author of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Rodino was the floor manager of the 1966 Civil Rights Act. He was the Co-Sponsor of what became the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, and authored the bill that designated Columbus Day as a national holiday. From 1971 to 1973 he was the Chairman of the Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality Subcommittee and played a key role in passing the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.

Throughout his 40 years in Congress, Rodino held fast to a liberal agenda. He stopped the proposed constitutional amendments that would ban abortion, allow organized prayer in the public schools, and prohibit busing to achieve school integration. Still, he was one of the last liberal Members of Congress to oppose the Vietnam War. He was viewed as an expert on immigration and bankruptcy law. He was a strong supporter of fair-housing legislation, and a staunch ally of organized labor.

In 1973, Rodino voted against the confirmation of Gerald Ford as vice president as a protest against the policies of the Nixon administration.

In 1975, Rodino received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

==U.S. Senate campaign==
Rodino nearly gave up his House seat after three terms to seek the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate in 1954, when incumbent GOP Senator Robert C. Hendrickson was retiring after one term. Democrats believed they had a chance to pick up the open Senate seat and party bosses decided they would clear the field for a single candidate, avoiding a primary. Rodino actively sought support for the Senate seat, but Democrats instead went with another Congressman, Charles R. Howell.

==House leadership==

Rodino was the Assistant Majority Whip of the House from 1965 to 1972, and served as a member of the Democratic Steering &amp; Policy Committee during the same years. He was the Senior Member of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control in 1977 and from 1979 to 1988. He was a delegate to the North Atlantic Assembly where he was chaired the Scientific and Technical Committee; to the Working Group on the Control of Narcotics from 1962 to 1972; and to the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration dealing with refugee problems from 1962 to 1972. He was also a member of the Congressional Committees Investigating The Iran-Contra Affair in 1987.

==House Judiciary Committee chairman==
Rodino became chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in January 1973, at the start of the 93rd Congress. He succeeded Emanuel Celler, a 50-year incumbent, who had been defeated for renomination in the 1972 Democratic primary election.

Later in 1973, after President Richard Nixon fired Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox on October 20, in what became known as the &quot;Saturday Night Massacre&quot;, numerous presidential impeachment related resolutions were proposed in the House. Speaker of the House Carl Albert referred them to the Judiciary Committee. The resultant impeachment inquiry and public hearings put Rodino, who until then had kept a low profile in Congress, front and center in the political limelight. &quot;If fate had been looking for one of the powerhouses of Congress, it wouldn&#x27;t have picked me&quot;, he told a reporter at the time.

The committee spent eight months gathering evidence and pressing the president to comply with subpoenas for White House tape recordings and documents. In 2005, John Doar, who was Special Counsel to the Judiciary Committee during the Watergate hearings, said of Rodino:


As the Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on the first article of impeachment in July 1974, Rodino said: &quot;We have deliberated. We have been patient. We have been fair. Now the American people, the House of Representatives and the Constitution and the whole history of our republic demand that we make up our minds.&quot; The committee, with six Republicans joining the Democratic majority, passed three of the five articles of impeachment. In a 1989 interview with Susan Stamberg of National Public Radio, Rodino recalled that after the committee finished its work on the impeachment articles, he went to a room in back of the committee chambers, called his wife and cried. He also stated:

Rodino presided over Gerald Ford&#x27;s December 1973 vice presidential confirmation hearing before the House Judiciary Committee. He also was appointed twice by the House as one of the managers to conduct (prosecute) impeachment trials against U.S. federal judges: Nevada judge Harry Claiborne in 1986 (for tax evasion) and Florida judge (and later congressman) Alcee Hastings in 1988 (for perjury). While he served during the trial of Claiborne, he was replaced at the start of the 101st United States Congress as an impeachment manager for the Hastings trial, before the trial had begun.

==Vice presidential candidate==
Rodino emerged as a possible running mate for Jimmy Carter in 1976. About 50 House members signed a petition urging Carter to pick Rodino, and then-House Majority Leader Tip O&#x27;Neill told Charles Kirbo (the Atlanta lawyer that was heading up Carter&#x27;s vice presidential search) that Rodino would be his best choice. O&#x27;Neill said that Rodino was a Catholic from a northeastern state who could bring middle class Italians back into the Democratic fold.

After Kirbo finished vetting possible candidates, Carter created a short list of seven—Rodino, and Senators Walter Mondale, Frank Church, Henry Jackson, John Glenn, Edmund Muskie, and Adlai Stevenson III. In July, before Carter made his choice, Rodino withdrew his name from consideration. He cited his age (67) and a recurring case of glaucoma that he felt might strain his ability to campaign.

Instead, Rodino was asked to give the nominating speech for Carter at the Democratic National Convention in New York. &quot;With honest talk and plain truth, Jimmy Carter has appealed to the American people. His heart is honest, and the people will believe him. His purpose is right, and the people will follow him,&quot; Rodino said. &quot;As he has brought a united South back into the Democratic Party, he will bring a united Democratic Party back into the leadership of America and a united America back to a position of respect and esteem in the eyes of the world.&quot;

In 1972, 57 delegates to the Democratic National Convention voted for Rodino for vice president instead of Thomas Eagleton, who was picked by nominee George McGovern.

==Family==
Rodino married Marianna (Ann) Stango in 1941. They had two children: Margaret (Peggy) Stanziale and Peter W. Rodino III. Peggy Stanziale married Charles A. Stanziale Jr., whose father had served as a Democratic State Assemblyman in 1932 and later as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. Marianna Rodino died on December 3, 1980, at age 70. In 1989, he married Joy Judelson, who had worked on Rodino&#x27;s congressional staff from 1963 until 1969, when she left to go to law school. They were married until his death in 2005.

==Retirement==
On March 15, 1988, Rodino announced that he would retire from Congress after 20 terms. &quot;Our journey together has been a long and fulfilling one,&quot; Rodino said in a statement. He left the House in January 1989 and was replaced by Payne, who became the first African American Congressman from New Jersey.
On November 4, 1978, Vice-President Walter Mondale attended the dedication of the Peter W. Rodino Federal Building in Newark.

After leaving congress, he became a Distinguished Visiting Professor of Constitutional Law at Seton Hall University Law School in Newark. He was a member of the faculty from 1989 until his death in 2005. &quot;Between 1990 and 1999, he taught two seminars each year, providing students a unique opportunity to actively participate in research, study, and discussion of some of the many areas of law affected by his time in public office. Enrollment was limited to 25 students, and the courses were fully subscribed. Most of the term was taken up with traditional small class discussion of pertinent issues. Each student also undertook a research paper on a specific topic, with the research results being presented in the seminar in the latter stages of the term. Critique and commentary was provided by Professor Rodino. The first term seminar concentrated on Civil Rights and Immigration, including in particular the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1986 Immigration Reform &amp; Control Act. The second term seminar dealt with Watergate and the Iran Contra Affair. These courses were co-taught with Professors Gil Carrasco and E. Judson Jennings,&quot; according to Seton Hall. &quot;While at Seton Hall, Professor Rodino participated in many significant programs and events, including a Celebration of the Bicentennial of the Bill of Rights. He also wrote several important law review articles on the Ninth Amendment, the Special Prosecutor Statute, the Preamble to the Constitution, and the Presidency.&quot;

In 1998, when the House was considering articles of impeachment against president Bill Clinton, Rodino urged congressmen to be &quot;cautious, restrained and non-partisan when weighing whether such an investigation is warranted&quot;. He said: &quot;Even the thought of impeachment is a question that should be considered ever so judiciously, especially when it comes to an issue that wracks a country, a constitutional crisis, impeachment is not to be considered lightly.&quot;

He died on May 7, 2005, of congestive heart failure at the age of 95 at his home in West Orange, New Jersey. He lay in state at Seton Hall Law Chapel and the funeral mass was celebrated at St. Lucy&#x27;s Church in Newark. Burial took place at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in East Hanover, New Jersey.

<text>WZGC (92.9 FM) – branded &quot;92.9 The Game&quot; – is a commercial sports radio station licensed to serve Atlanta, Georgia, covering the Atlanta metropolitan area. Owned by Audacy, Inc., WZGC is the Atlanta affiliate for Infinity Sports Network; the flagship station for the Atlanta Falcons, Atlanta Hawks and Atlanta United FC radio networks; and the radio home of Randy McMichael. The WZGC studios are located at Colony Square in Midtown Atlanta, while the station transmitter is located in Atlanta&#x27;s North Druid Hills neighborhood. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WZGC broadcasts over one HD Radio channel, and is available online via Audacy.

==History==
===Classical (1955–1971)===
The station signed on the air on September 1, 1955, as WGKA-FM. Owned by Glenkaren Associates, it was the FM counterpart of WGKA (1190 AM), with studios at 1140 Peachtree Street NE. WGKA-FM was the first full-time FM classical music station in Atlanta.

===Rock (1971–1973)===
In 1971, the General Cinema Corporation acquired WGKA-AM-FM. Even though it was a movie theater chain, GCC wanted to branch out into broadcast media. The classical music remained on the AM station, while the FM station became WZGC (referring to the last two letters in General Cinema) in 1972, with an album-oriented rock format.

===Top 40 (1973–1989)===
In March 1973, the format switched to contemporary hit radio calling itself &quot;Z-93&quot;.

In the 1970s, many radios still only received AM signals. WQXI and WGST (920 AM) were the leading top 40 stations in Atlanta, but as FM listening increased, WZGC gained an audience. The station was acquired by First Media Corporation in 1976.

In the 1980s, the AM top 40 stations switched to other formats, leaving WZGC as Atlanta&#x27;s only contemporary hits station. Then, in 1986, WAPW (99.7 FM) debuted with its own popular top 40 format, with WZGC&#x27;s ratings declining as a result. The station switched to a rhythmic contemporary format during the summer of 1988.

===Classic rock (1989–2004)===
On January 3, 1989, that station changed to a classic rock format, while retaining the &quot;Z-93&quot; moniker. Infinity Broadcasting acquired WZGC in 1992; Infinity was renamed CBS Radio in December 2005.

===AAA (2004–2012)===
The name change to &quot;Dave FM&quot; and format switch to adult album alternative (AAA) came at 5 pm on July 21, 2004, following a stunt featuring all-Dave Matthews Band music. Dave&#x27;s first song was &quot;Orange Crush&quot; by R.E.M. WZGC installed an HD Radio transmitter in the early 2000s. The HD-2 subchannel carried an Americana format branded as &quot;Dave Roots&quot;.

===Sports talk (2012–present)===
Throughout its run as &quot;Dave FM&quot;, the station maintained decent ratings, though it was never an overall winner. However, in the summer of 2011, the station saw a drop in its Arbitron ratings. At the same time, CBS had enjoyed success with several of its FM stations that had switched to all sports formats in Dallas, Boston, Detroit and Pittsburgh. Due to this, CBS announced in July 2012 that WZGC would flip to all sports in October. Dave&#x27;s final day of programming, which started on September 29, after a three-day radiothon for Children&#x27;s Healthcare of Atlanta, consisted of the on-air staff hosting final shifts (including Steve Craig, Jill, Mara Davis, Charles, Yvonne Monet, Sully, Renee and Margot), as well as a &quot;Top 92 Songs of Dave FM&quot; countdown. Around 12:20 am on September 30, Dave FM ended regular programming with &quot;Little Lion Man&quot; by Mumford &amp; Sons (the #1 song in the countdown) and &quot;Atlanta&quot; by Butch Walker. The station ran on automation until the flip at 2 pm on October 24. The final song on &quot;Dave&quot; was &quot;Thank You Friends&quot; by Big Star.

Even though WZGC was owned by CBS Radio, it didn&#x27;t affiliate with CBS Sports Radio at launch, as the network already had an affiliate in Atlanta on WCNN. Because of this, WZGC had local sports hosts around the clock, all week long. Eventually, WCNN became an ESPN Radio affiliate, and WZGC added CBS Sports Radio programming to its overnight schedule.

On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on November 17.

On February 23, 2022, WZGC added The Bet to its HD2 subchannel.

<text>Turin Brakes are an English band, comprising original duo of Olly Knights and Gale Paridjanian, and long-term collaborators Rob Allum and Eddie Myer. They had a UK top 5 hit in 2003 with their song &quot;Painkiller (Summer Rain)&quot;. Since starting out in 1999, the band have sold around one million records worldwide. They are currently signed to Cooking Vinyl.

==History==

===1999–2001: Formation and &quot;The Optimist LP&quot; ===
The band was started by long-time friends Knights and Paridjanian. The two met at a young age and spent much of their childhood together, both receiving guitars as Christmas presents at the age of 10. Although they split after Knights went to film school and Paridjanian formed 100 Moments, a London based experimental rock band with Canadian born guitarist and songwriter Michael Brennan. Later moving to Canada and attempting to form a band in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, they soon reunited and collaborated on what would later become their first EP, &quot;The Door&quot;, which was eventually released through Anvil Records in 1999 as a limited vinyl release. This led to the band attracting the attention of larger record labels. Source Records would eventually release two more EPs, &quot;The State of Things EP&quot; and &quot;Fight or Flight&quot;, prompting &quot;NME&quot; to proclaim &quot;Turin Brakes inhabit a space which is entirely their own, fully formed and brutally emotive... give them the devotion they deserve.&quot;

Source reissued the song &quot;The Door&quot; before releasing their first album, &quot;The Optimist LP&quot;, in 2001. The album, which was released in the United States by Astralwerks, was greeted with critical praise, spawned several modestly successful UK singles, &quot;Underdog (Save Me)&quot; (reaching no. 39 in the UK Singles Charts ), &quot;Mind Over Money&quot; (reaching no. 31 ) and &quot;Emergency 72&quot;, and received a nomination for the Mercury Music Prize. In August 2001, the album was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry. A planned tour of the United States opening for the Stereophonics and Matthew Jay, was cancelled due to the September 11 terrorist attacks. Still, the band played at over 80 venues in Europe and the United States that year.

===2002–2004: &quot;Ether Song&quot; and mainstream success===
Early 2002, the band started work on their second album. After demo sessions in Rye, United Kingdom, the band flew to Los Angeles, California to record with producer Tony Hoffer in the Summer of 2002. In October 2002, this resulted in single &quot;Long Distance&quot; (reaching no. 31 ) and an arena tour supporting David Gray.

In February 2002, the band embarked on their biggest headline tour to date, covering 24 UK venues in a month, including two sold-out shows at Brixton Academy, a venue they frequently visited when growing up. On 1 March 2003, their single &quot;Pain Killer&quot; became their biggest hit to date, reaching the top 5 of the singles chart.

Turin Brakes&#x27; second album, &quot;Ether Song&quot;, was released on 3 March 2003. The album was a departure from the acoustic sound that had brought them success with their first album. The album was popular enough to reach number 4 in the UK Albums Chart upon its release and to be certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry four days after the release, on 7 March 2003.

After the successful release, the record company sought to replicate the commercial success by releasing a third single from the album, &quot;Average Man&quot;. However, UK radio stations didn&#x27;t embrace the single as they had with previous releases and the chart performance (no. 35) was seen as disappointment by fans and the record label.

The album&#x27;s commercial performance created some tension between the band and their label. In fact, between tours in the United States (their own headline tour and supporting David Gray) in the Summer of 2003, the band recorded a new single for a re-release of &quot;Ether Song&quot; with Tony Hoffer. The first re-release of &quot;Ether Song&quot;, featuring an orange version of the cover and single &quot;5 Mile&quot; was released on 6 October 2003. &quot;5 Mile&quot; charted higher than &quot;Average Man&quot; (no. 31 ) but was largely overlooked by UK radio stations. Overall, the album was re-released four times during its lifespan, and received various bonus discs between regions and versions. The band was on record as being unhappy with the way the record company was treating them and the fans regarding the release.

Following the success and stress of &quot;Ether Song&quot;, the band took a short break, but not before touring Australia and New Zealand and releasing a DJ mix album for Azuli Records&#x27; &quot;Late Night Tales&quot; series in February 2004. The mix album (2004) was a collection of some of their favourite songs and main influences, and also contained The Rolling Stones song &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot; as a cover. The band have done some DJ sets in the London area over the years.

The band spent the first half of 2004 writing and recording new material in their own studio, which they built in Brixton, London. That summer, they played a successful set at Somerset House, playing a selection of old and new material, including future singles &quot;Fishing For A Dream&quot; and &quot;Over And Over&quot;. Later that year, they found themselves part of the Band Aid 20 cast for the revamped Noughties take on &quot;Do They Know It’s Christmas&quot;, alongside Paul McCartney, Radiohead and Robbie Williams, giving them to date their only chart topper in the process.

===2005: &quot;JackInABox&quot; and &quot;Live at the Palladium&quot;===
Their third album, &quot;Jackinabox&quot;, was released to critical acclaim in early June 2005. Preceded by the single &quot;Fishing for a Dream,&quot; which did not do as well as the band hoped (charting at 32). Despite the lack of airplay or a hit single &quot;JackInABox&quot; still sold quite well, entering the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart in its first week and certified Silver by the BPI on 10 June 2005. The album was supported by the group&#x27;s first full-band tour of the United States, as well as the single &quot;Over and Over,&quot; which was serviced to U.S. radio.

Following the success of &quot;Jackinabox&quot; and its subsequent tour, a download-only album, &quot;Live at the Palladium&quot;, recorded in London was released in November 2005. Released one day after the concert took place in London, it was available on the band&#x27;s website. Later it also got a release on iTunes and did well in the download charts. In the October / November 2005 tour, the band also sold the &quot;Red Moon EP&quot;. This acoustic EP featured a new (acoustic) version of &quot;Red Moon&quot;, two new songs (live favourite &quot;Jet Trail&quot; and &quot;Love Is All You Deserve&quot;) and the &quot;Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot; cover &quot;Breaking The Girl&quot; (recorded at &quot;KCRW&quot;).

===2006–2008: &quot;Dark on Fire&quot;===
The band spent the first half of 2006 writing new songs, occasionally performing both new and old work at small gigs across the UK. The band did an intimate tour in November 2006 to try out new material. In January 2007 the band entered a recording studio in London to record their fourth album with producer Ethan Johns. After three weeks the band took a break (on 29 January Paridjanian&#x27;s wife gave birth to a daughter), but the sessions were resumed several weeks later in a bigger studio (also in London). On the last day of March 2007 the band announced that they had finished the recording sessions, and recorded 17 songs.

The new album, &quot;Dark on Fire&quot;, was released in the UK in September 2007, preceded by a download-only single. &quot;Stalker&quot;. On 14 January 2008 another download-only single was released: &quot;Something In My Eye&quot;. The b-side was a cover version of Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;Here Comes My Baby&quot;. Both singles failed to make an impact on the singles charts, but &quot;Dark on Fire&quot; did chart at no. 36 in the top 40.

===2008–2009: &quot;Bottled at Source&quot; and work with other artists===
In spring 2008, the band were special guests on the Hotel Cafe Tour hosted by Tom McRae. Also, the band did an acoustic tour in Germany. During that summer, the band played various summer festivals. As of November 2008, the band are back in the studio recording new material. Also, the band have been working with and writing for Take That, resulting in the bonus-track &quot;Here&quot; on 2008&#x27;s &quot;The Circus&quot;. They also worked with Pete Lawrie, Andy Steele, Dido and Lisa Mitchell.

In March 2009, the band announced they would make their live return later in the year with two acoustic shows at &quot;Folk in the Barn&quot; in Canterbury in May. In June 2009, it was announced that the band would be releasing a &#x27;Best Of&#x27; album, to mark the tenth anniversary of their debut single &quot;The Door&quot;, along with a festival slot at Latitude in late-July and a headline performance at London Theatre Royal, Drury Lane the following September. This album, &quot;Bottled at Source – The Best of the Source Years&quot;, was also their last album for the Source record label.

During the performance at Theatre Royal on 13 September, the band played brand-new songs off the untitled forthcoming album, which they hinted would come out in February 2010.

===2010–2012: &quot;Outbursts&quot;===
Their fifth album, &quot;Outbursts&quot;, was eventually released on 1 March 2010 on their new label, Cooking Vinyl. Its release was followed by a European tour and a US and Canada tour. The download single released from this album was Sea Change. Throughout the summer of 2010 the band played several festivals in the United Kingdom and Italy, including Glastonbury 2010 and Summer Sundae.

In November 2011, the band toured the United Kingdom to celebrate the tenth anniversary of their debut album The Optimist LP. The band played the complete debut album in the correct order, apart from hidden track &quot;Three Days Old&quot; and a second set of more recent work, including new song &quot;Rescue Squad&quot; and their re-working of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; song Chim Chim Cher-ee, which they released as a digital single to raise money for homeless charities. A live recording of their show at Koko in London on 11 November 2011 was released as a live album.

Throughout 2012, the band wrote new material and played intimate venues in the United Kingdom. In October 2012, Olly Knights released a solo album &quot;If Not Now When&quot; on Turin Brakes&#x27; own record label, The Complete ATOMIC. In November 2012, the band returned to their studio to record material for their sixth studio album.

===2013–2014: &quot;We Were Here&quot;===
The band premiered a new song, called &quot;Sleeper&quot;, in Naples, Italy. Recording of their sixth album, &quot;We Were Here&quot;, started on Monday 11 March 2013 at Rockfield Studios with producer Ali Staton and was released 30 September 2013 on the Cooking Vinyl label. The album was trailed by lead single &#x27;Time and Money&#x27; and followed by second single &#x27;Guess You Heard&#x27; in April 2014. The album reached number 46 in the UK album charts. After the release of the album, the band played their biggest UK tour in over a decade.

In 2014, the band played the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas and toured the United Kingdom, Italy, Ireland and the Netherlands. In 2015, the band started work on their seventh studio album. 

===2015–2017: &quot;Lost Property&quot;===
On 2 November 2015 the band announced its seventh album &quot;Lost Property&quot;, recorded at Rockfield Studios with producer Ali Staton, would be released on 29 January 2016 and released the video for the track &#x27;96&#x27;. A song from the album, &quot;Save You&quot;, appeared in the closing moments of the second episode, &quot;First Day&quot;, of the ABC drama &quot;Designated Survivor&quot; on 28 September 2016.

===2018–present: &quot;Invisible Storm&quot;===
On 26 January 2018 the band released their eighth album &quot;Invisible Storm&quot;, recorded at Rockfield Studios with producer Ali Staton, well received by the fans and critics, the album featured a more commercial sound than some of their previous work. Singles released included, &quot;Wait&quot;, &quot;Life Forms&quot; and &quot;Lost In The Woods&quot;.

==Sound==
Turin Brakes have often been compared to many of the new acoustic movement bands spawned in the late 1990s such as Elbow, Starsailor, and the Norwegian band Kings of Convenience, whose 2001 album entitled &quot;Quiet Is the New Loud&quot; is a helpful indicator of the band&#x27;s first album. With each record, Turin Brakes try to change their sound. While the first album features a lot of acoustic guitar, &quot;Ether Song&quot; featured more electric guitar and was, in total, a lot darker. The third album, &quot;Jackinabox&quot;, can be seen as a combination of the first two albums, with some funk influences.. While &quot;Dark on Fire&quot; featured a bigger sound produced by Ethan Johns, 2010&#x27;s &quot;Outbursts&quot; can be seen as a return to the sound of &quot;The Optimist LP&quot;. Turin Brakes formerly performed live as a five-piece outfit to achieve a full band sound, and were joined on stage (and often also in the studio) by Rob Allum (drums), Phil Marten (keyboards) and Eddie Myer (bass). Following Marten&#x27;s departure, they now perform as a four-piece band, with Gale&#x27;s guitar playing being more prominent and more richly contributing to the live sound.

On 6 September 2012, all four Turin Brakes members played at a &quot;Spirit of Talk Talk&quot; evening at 229 Great Portland Street where they joined some former members of Talk Talk to play a few hits including &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, with the band then playing a set of their own afterwards. Before playing the song &quot;Painkiller&quot; Gale announced to the audience that although it wouldn&#x27;t be obvious to most people the song was heavily influenced by Talk Talk and by the work they did with producer Phill Brown in the Kent countryside some years ago.

<text>WUBL (94.9 FM) is a commercial radio station known as 94-9 The Bull. It is owned by iHeartMedia and it plays a country music radio format. The studios and offices are located at the Peachtree Palisades Building in the Brookwood Hills district of Atlanta. It has local DJs in the daytime and at nighttime it carries two syndicated Premiere Networks country music programs, &quot;The Bobby Bones Show&quot; and &quot;After MidNite With Granger Smith&quot;.
The station&#x27;s radio transmitter is located just northeast of Atlanta near Druid Hills Road in North Druid Hills, with several other stations.

Along with WSB AM and WSB-FM, this station is a primary entry point (PEP) for Emergency Alert System messages for the state of Georgia.

==History==
=== Religious (1962–1972) ===
The station began on October 24, 1962, as religious WAVQ (changed to WAVO-FM in 1965), sister to WAVO (1420 AM). The station was signed on by the Great Commission Gospel Association, which was in the process of selling both outlets to Bob Jones University.

=== Easy listening/Soft rock (1972–2006) ===
In 1972, the format changed to easy listening with the WPCH callsign. In the early 1980s, the station&#x27;s format switched from easy listening to soft AC as a response to WSB-FM&#x27;s format change. The station was branded as &quot;FM95 WPCH&quot; until mid-1991, when the &quot;Peach 94.9&quot; name was adopted, reflecting its exact frequency for newer radios with digital tuning, and Atlanta&#x27;s nickname as the &quot;Big Peach&quot;. (This is derived from its main road of Peachtree Street, and New York being the &quot;Big Apple&quot;, as well as Atlanta being the &quot;New York of the South&quot;; the callsign is now on WPCH-TV as &quot;Peachtree TV&quot; in Atlanta.) The format changed to soft adult contemporary in 1990. The easy listening format was revived online as &quot;The Peach&quot; by Pretty Cool Media in 2021. The station enjoyed consistent ratings success through the 1990s and early 2000s.

In December 2002, the name &quot;Peach&quot; was dropped, and the station rebranded as WLTM &quot;94.9 Lite FM&quot;. Prior to Christmas each year, Lite FM played all Christmas music.

From 2005 to 2006, the station had Randy &amp; Spiff as its morning show. After it was canceled, they moved their show to 640 WGST later in 2007. The duo were formerly at WFOX &quot;Fox 97&quot; (now WSRV &quot;The River&quot;) and briefly at then sister Clear Channel station WLCL FM &quot;Cool 105.7&quot;. Lite&#x27;s morning show from May 2003 until March 2005 was married couple Gene and Julie Gates. The nighttime show was the syndicated Delilah. (However, Delilah was not on the new 96.7; instead it was aired on former competitor WSB-FM, &quot;B98.5FM&quot; from late December 2006 until 2011.)

=== Country (2006–present) ===
In the middle of its all-Christmas music format, and more than a week before Christmas Day, Lite FM changed to country music as &quot;The Bull&quot; at noon on December 18, 2006. WLTM&#x27;s call letters were then changed to WUBL. The old adult contemporary format officially moved to 96.7 FM two days later, and stayed there until December 26, 2007, when 96.7 switched to a classic country format to accompany WUBL. On January 7, 2008, WUBL added &quot;The Cledus T. Party&quot;, starring comedian/parody singer Cledus T. Judd, as its morning show.

Current personalities include: Kristen Gates (morning show co-host), Spencer Graves (morning show co-host), Art &quot;Mad Man&quot; Mehring (traffic), Angie Ward (mid-days), Otis &quot;O-Man&quot; (afternoons), Bobby Bones (Evenings), Aaron Micheal (Late Evenings)

==== HD radio ====
In 2011, the station changed its HD Radio channel 2 to simulcast Immanuel Broadcasting Network, whose flagship station is WCCV FM 91.7 in Cartersville. Two IBN-owned broadcast translators are actually assigned to WUBL instead of WCCV as their primary station: W265AV 100.9 Woodstock, and W223BP 92.5 Lithia Springs (previously W221CG 92.1 &quot;Kennesaw&quot;, which was actually near Hiram/Dallas), both transmitting IBN programming. WGST AM 640 was carried on WUBL&#x27;s HD3 channel, as well as on W222AF FM 92.3, which is also owned by Immanuel and formerly rebroadcast WCCV. However, W222AF was assigned directly to retransmit WGST, not WUBL.

In October 2012, not long after WGST became Spanish-language ESPN Deportes, WUBL HD-3 and W222AF split from WGST and became &quot;Comedy 92-3&quot;, the locally inserted affiliate name for the satellite-fed radio network 24/7 Comedy. This same local feed was also retransmitted on DTV radio by WANN-CD 29, on virtual channel 32.21, with 94-9 the Bull on 32.22. In early June 2013, WUBL HD-3 and WANN 32.21 reverted to airing WGST at the same time that station again started English-language programming. ESPN Deportes moved to WWPW FM 96.1 HD-3, and now that station simulcasts on W222AF, although the FCC database still indicates WUBL as its supposed &quot;primary&quot; station. For a while in late 2014, WUBL HD-3 simulcasted the urban oldies and classic hip-hop formats of &quot;Old School 99.3&quot; (relayed on translator W257DF FM 99.3) through a lease agreement with owner Steve Hedgwood. After that translator was forced off-air due to co-channel interference with WCON-FM, the &quot;Old School&quot; format remained on the HD-3 channel for a time before returning to a simulcast of WGST. (The &quot;Old School&quot; format would be revived on WTBS-LP FM 87.7 in January 2016.)

<text>WRDG (96.1 FM) – branded as &quot;96.1 The Beat&quot; – is a commercial urban contemporary radio station licensed to Atlanta, Georgia. Owned by iHeartMedia, the station serves the Atlanta metropolitan area. The WRDG studios are located in Atlanta&#x27;s Upper Westside district inside the Works ATL development, while the station transmitter resides in nearby North Druid Hills. Besides a standard analog transmission, WRDG broadcasts over three HD Radio channels, and is available online via iHeartRadio.

==History==
===Easy listening (1960–1972)===
On December 2, 1960, the station signed on the air as WGAA-FM, the FM counterpart to WGAA in Cedartown. Shortly after being established, the station was sold to Kenco Broadcasting for $25,000. Kenco was headed by Don Kennedy, James Lathom and Arthur Swan; Kennedy was an Atlanta radio and television personality, playing &quot;Officer Don&quot; on WSB-TV&#x27;s &quot;Popeye Club&quot; children&#x27;s show from 1956 to 1972. After the sale, WGAA-FM&#x27;s call letters were changed to WKLS, representing the initials of Kenco&#x27;s partners, &quot;Kennedy-Lathom-Swan&quot;. They sold it ten years later for $750,000.

From its earliest days until the early 1970s, the station played easy listening music. For its first several years on the air, WKLS was voice-tracked with most of the announcements and commercials read by Kennedy.

===MOR (1972–1974)===
By 1972, WKLS had moved to a middle of the road (MOR) format with popular adult music and live disc jockeys who served as friendly personalities. Its main slogan by then was &quot;WKLS...That&#x27;s &#x27;Klass&#x27;&quot;.

From 1977 to 1988, WKLS was co-owned with WKLS (970 AM); consequently, WKLS was formally known as WKLS-FM during this period. The following year, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) database shows it as having the call letters WEOA for a month from November to December (however, this may be a mistake).

===Album rock (1974–2006)===
WKLS made a dramatic change in 1974, as it flipped to an album rock format, using the moniker &quot;96 Rock&quot;, the branding it retained until November 2006. Key artists on WKLS in the 1970s, included The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Elton John, Carole King, The Who and Chicago. For a time in 1977, DJ &quot;Skinny&quot; Bobby Harper, who was the inspiration for Dr. Johnny Fever of the television sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, was a WKLS disc jockey. In the 1980s, the station was acquired by The Great American Radio &amp; TV Company, with Jacor Communications taking over in the 1990s.

In the early 1980s, &quot;96 Rock&quot; cultivated a somewhat macho image. The station often mocked competing stations which played Top 40 hits as &quot;wimp rock&quot;. WKLS began to play more heavy metal, which was increasing in popularity, especially among teenaged boys. However, a backlash began to develop among the station&#x27;s more mature listeners. In 1985, the station modified its playlist to a mix of older and newer titles. WKLS and its parent company Jacor was bought by San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications.

&quot;96 Rock&quot; continued to play a mixture of classic rock and new rock for nearly two decades. WKLS finally became exclusively a classic rock station in 2004. The 2004 change occurred when competing Atlanta station Z-93 (WZGC FM 92.9) became &quot;Dave FM&quot;, switching from classic rock to adult album alternative (AAA). This did not cause a dramatic change in 96 Rock&#x27;s playlist, however. Even before officially declaring itself a classic rock station, most of its songs were from past decades. Only a few new or recent songs were played an hour.

The station honored its history and tradition on several occasions. In 1984, WKLS celebrated its 10th anniversary by airing a Labor Day countdown of the top 296 songs from 1974 to 1984. The station&#x27;s 30th anniversary was recognized in 2004, with several promotions. Listeners were asked to write to the station and reminisce about events in their lives, in which 96 Rock played a memorable role. Some of this correspondence was read on the air and posted on the station&#x27;s website.

In April 2004, long-time morning drive time hosts The Regular Guys (Larry Wachs and Eric Von Haessler) were fired after they had inadvertently aired graphic sexual language from porn star Devin Lane when the content bled through a Honda commercial. That content, which aired the previous month, was intended to be played backwards. The Regular Guys wanted to mock the FCC indecency crackdown when they came back from the break. Regular Guys sidekick &quot;Southside&quot; Steve Rickman and former midday host Tim Rhodes took the morning time slot temporarily. A permanent replacement came in the form of the syndicated &quot;Bob &amp; Tom Show&quot;, as Rhodes and Rickman moved to the afternoon slot. The Regular Guys returned to Atlanta airwaves on March 21, 2005, and came back to 96 Rock in May, after a brief stint on co-owned talk radio station WGST. The return of the Regular Guys only lasted 18 months.

On October 23, 2006, Clear Channel Communications terminated the Regular Guys for good following an incident in which Wachs recorded bathroom conversations between the two morning show hosts on co-owned WWVA-FM while all three men were using the restroom. The recording was played on the air a couple of days later. The WWVA hosts (known as &quot;Yogi &amp; Panda&quot;) complained to management and subsequently sued Clear Channel and The Regular Guys. Wachs said, &quot;A case of a humorous prank has turned into a culture clash, a suppression of First Amendment rights, and a ridiculous smear campaign against me as well as termination of my income without due process.&quot;

===Active rock (2006–2012)===
On November 17, at 9am, Clear Channel dropped the station&#x27;s 32-year &quot;96 Rock&quot; moniker, replacing it with &quot;Project 9-6-1&quot;, and shifted to more of an active rock format. At the same time, alternative-formatted &quot;105.3 The Buzz&quot; (WBZY) ceased independent operations and began simulcasting the new format for several days, until a regional Mexican music format began. The new format on WKLS was intended to be somewhat of a merger between 96 Rock and The Buzz, although more personalities from The Buzz were on the new station than ones from 96 Rock.

On July 7, 2007, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; reported that the new morning show host for Project 9-6-1 would be &quot;Giant&quot; Brian Carothers, morning producer and sidekick for John DeBella at WMGK in Philadelphia. Carothers was joined by co-host Shaffee, former radio personality from long-time rock station WRIF in Detroit. &quot;The Giant Show&quot; debuted on October 1. On October 2, 2009, it was announced that &quot;Giant&quot; Brian Carothers would no longer be a part of the morning show and &quot;The Giant Show&quot; would be replaced by a show hosted by Shaffee and El Jefe, who was later replaced by Klinger.

On May 21, 2011, it was revealed that Shaffee and Klinger would no longer be a part of the morning show. Kidd Chris from WYSP Philadelphia announced on May 24, that he would be joining the morning show. He hosted mornings on Project 9-6-1 until the format&#x27;s demise.

===Top 40/CHR (2012–2024)===
On August 29, 2012, at 7pm, without warning, &quot;Project&quot; signed off following a farewell message from program director Chris &quot;The OC&quot; Williams, as he ended the station&#x27;s 38-year rock history with &quot;Free Bird&quot; by Lynyrd Skynyrd, with the rock format moving to its HD2 digital subchannel. After stunting with an hour of jockless pop songs and the opening chorus to &quot;Ready or Not&quot; by The Fugees, the station flipped to contemporary hit radio, branded as &quot;Power 96-1&quot;. The first (and ultimately, last) song on &quot;Power&quot; was &quot;Party Rock Anthem&quot; by LMFAO. The flip marked the second station in the market to use the &quot;Power&quot; branding, the first being WARM-FM/WAPW from 1986 to 1992. On September 11, WKLS changed call letters to WWPW to match the &quot;Power&quot; branding.

The nationally syndicated program &quot;Elvis Duran and the Morning Show&quot; was carried by WWPW from September 2012 until February 11, 2014. When Duran was discontinued, the station warned listeners about the change, and directed them to the iHeartRadio website and smartphone app. WWPW went a month without a morning show, playing music during morning drive time, calling it &quot;The Most New Hit Music in the Morning&quot;, until the station debuted a local morning show on March 17, with Scotty K, Riley Couture and Bret Mega.

On February 29, 2016, it was officially announced that &quot;Power Morning Show&quot; hosts Scotty K and Bret Mega were let go. This came as a surprise since the local morning show, and the station as a whole, had been gaining traction in the ratings. Some speculations had been made about Power mornings returning to a more music-intensive show. Word of their replacement was announced on March 19, with PK Kalentzis, formerly of &quot;The Playhouse&quot; morning show from Portland, Oregon, and KKHH in Houston, hosting mornings along with his wife Denise and Riley Couture beginning March 21. In November 2020, PK and Denise Kalentzis and co-host DuRyan Smith were let go as a result of budget cuts; in February 2021, WWPW would pick up &quot;The Jubal Show&quot; (syndicated from sister station KBKS in Seattle) for morning drive.

WWPW also carried the syndicated &quot;On-Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot;, hosted by Atlanta native Ryan Seacrest, in middays. Seacrest&#x27;s countdown show &quot;American Top 40&quot; was also heard Sunday mornings.

===Urban Contemporary (2024–present)===
On April 16, 2024, WWPW began promoting a &quot;big announcement&quot; at noon that day. At that time, WWPW assumed WRDG&#x27;s urban contemporary format and &quot;Beat&quot; branding, relaunching as &quot;96.1 The Beat&quot;. After a one hour simulcast, the Top 40/CHR format and &quot;Power&quot; branding would move to WRDG. The move comes as &quot;Power&quot; registered a 1.8 share in the March 2024 Nielsen ratings, well behind WWWQ&#x27;s 3 share. The two stations would swap call letters on April 23.

==Digital broadcasting==
WRDG broadcasts in IBOC digital radio, using the HD Radio system, with four subchannels:

* WRDG-HD1 is a digital simulcast of the analog signal.
* WRDG-HD2 airs a simulcast of sister station WWPW, which airs a contemporary hit radio format as &quot;Power 105.3&quot;.
* WRDG-HD3 airs the &quot;Atlanta’s Peach&quot; format.

In late March 2010, low-power digital TV station WANN-LD started carrying the audio of WKLS on one of its multiplexed, audio-only digital subchannels. Originally on virtual channel 32.13, it was then moved to 32.103, with 32.101 to 32.106 reserved for other iHeartMedia stations in Atlanta.

===HD2===
On January 30, 2006, WKLS added a separate digital subchannel known under the branding &quot;The Cabin&quot; and airing an adult album alternative format. WKLS-HD2 later changed names to &quot;The Alternative Project&quot; or &quot;Project 9-6-1&quot;.

Following the main channel&#x27;s format change to &quot;Power 96.1&quot; in August 2012, the &quot;Project 9-6-1&quot; rock format moved to the HD2 subchannel of WKLS as &quot;Project 9-6-2&quot;. Then on March 28, 2013, hours after the WWVA/WWLG simulcast flipped formats from rhythmic contemporary, WWPW-HD2 became &quot;Wild 96.1 HD2&quot;.

It eventually changed to a simulcast of sister station WRDG due to low signal strength in the eastern portions of Atlanta. This was later replaced with a rock format under the heritage &quot;96 Rock&quot; branding that was heard on the analog channel prior to 2006.

===HD3===
In June 2013, WWPW activated a third digital subchannel, WWPW-HD3, and began airing ESPN Deportes Spanish-language sports programming. The format was also carried on FM translator W222AF at 92.3 MHz. On October 2, 2015, W222AF/WWPW-HD3 flipped to Spanish adult contemporary with the branding &quot;Mia 92.3&quot;.

In July 2020, WWPW-HD3 switched to a simulcast of sister station WBIN. As of November 2022, the sub-channel was turned off.

The HD3 currently broadcasts the adult contemporary &quot;Peach&quot; format.

===HD4===
On September 24, 2020, the WWPW-HD4 subchannel changed formats from gospel to classic hits, still under the &quot;102.1 The King&quot; branding. On January 8, 2021, WWPW-HD4 rebranded as &quot;Fox FM&quot;, joining simulcasters WBAF (1090 AM) in Barnesville and WFDR (1370 AM) in Manchester. Syndicated programming on Fox FM includes &quot;Daily Dees&quot; hosted by Rick Dees in middays and &quot;Scott Shannon Presents America&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; on weekends.

As of August 2022, &quot;Fox FM&quot; is no longer broadcast on WWPW-HD4.

<text>WKHX-FM (101.5 MHz) is a commercial radio station licensed to Marietta, Georgia, featuring a country music format known as &quot;New Country 101.5&quot;. Owned by Cumulus Media, the station serves the Atlanta metropolitan area. WKHX-FM&#x27;s studios are located in Sandy Springs, while the transmitter is located west of Emory University, in unincorporated DeKalb County. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WKHX-FM broadcasts in HD Radio, and is available online.

==History==
The station signed on as WBIE-FM on November 11, 1959 under the ownership of Marietta Broadcasting. Initially, WBIE simulcast the variety programming of its sister station AM 1080 WBIE, but in February 1968 it adopted a full-time country music format. The station manager at the time, James M. Wilder, has a technology laboratory building named after him at Southern Polytechnic State University in Marietta.

Initially, WBIE-FM was powered at 3,500 watts, only heard in and around Marietta. In the 1970s, WBIE-FM boosted its power to the legal maximum of 100,000 watts, and became audible in Metro Atlanta. Its AM companion at 1080 switched its format to Adult Standards and its call sign to WCOB. The power boost made WBIE-FM a candidate to be bought by a large broadcasting company anxious for a strong FM signal in the growing Atlanta radio market.

&quot;Kicks 101.5&quot; debuted in November 1981 after Capital Cities Communications purchased WBIE-FM. Capital Cities switched WBIE-FM&#x27;s call letters to WKHX and made the station a contender in the Atlanta ratings. In 1987, WKHX programming began to be simulcast on Capital Cities-owned AM 590, formerly known as WAGA and WPLO. The AM station became WKHX, while 101.5 added an FM suffix, becoming WKHX-FM. Today, AM 590 is Christian radio WDWD, owned by Salem Media.

Capital Cities took over ABC, including its television and radio stations, in 1985. In 1995, ABC bought WKHX-FM&#x27;s rival country station, WYAY. Eventually, WYAY switched to news programming, and today is Christian Contemporary-formatted WAKL after being sold to the Educational Media Foundation in 2019. In December 2006, WKHX-FM got a new country music competitor in WUBL, owned by Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia).

WKHX-FM and other ABC Radio stations were acquired by Citadel Broadcasting in 2007, which was absorbed into Cumulus Media in September 2011. In October 2011, WKHX-FM modified its playlist from playing only &quot;new country&quot; music to mixing in some older hits from the 1990s to the present.

On November 13, 2019, WKHX began running liners promoting a &quot;big announcement&quot; to come at 3 p.m. the following day. Several liners had a wolf-howling sound effect, a nod to rumors on radio news websites (based on web domains registered by Cumulus as far back as September) that the station was to rebrand as &quot;The Wolf&quot;. At the promised time, the station rebranded, but instead as &quot;New Country 101.Five&quot;, and also introducing a new morning show host, JJ Kincaid, to team with existing co-host Dallas McCade, with the show being branded as &quot;Kincaid and Dallas&quot;.
