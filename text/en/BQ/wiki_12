<text>The Fairmont Château Laurier is a hotel with 429 guest rooms in the downtown core of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Located near the intersection of Rideau Street and Sussex Drive, it is designed in a French Gothic Revival Châteauesque style to complement the adjacent Parliament buildings. The hotel is above the Colonel By Valley, home of the Ottawa Locks of the Rideau Canal, and overlooks the Ottawa River. The main dining room (now the Laurier Room) overlooks Major&#x27;s Hill Park. The reception rooms consist of the Wedgewood-blue Adam Room, the Laurier Room defined with Roman columns, the Empire-style ballroom, and the Drawing Room decorated with cream and gold plaster ornament. The hotel was designated a national historic site in 1980.

==History==

===Grand Trunk Railway 1909–1923===

Grand Trunk Railway president Charles Melville Hays commissioned Château Laurier, and construction occurred between 1909 and 1912 for , in tandem with Ottawa&#x27;s downtown Union Station (now the Senate of Canada Building) across Rideau Street. A tunnel under Rideau Street links the two buildings. When the hotel first opened, private rooms cost $2 per night. Out of the 350 bedrooms, 155 had private baths, while the remaining 104 rooms were equipped with washstands with hot and cold water connections. In addition, dormitories and communal bathrooms were available, as well as rooms for travelling salespeople with sample tables for displaying goods.

The hotel showcases original Tiffany stained-glass windows and hand-moulded plaster decorations dating back to 1912. The building is adorned with Indiana limestone on the exterior walls. It features conical turrets, dormer windows, and a roof clad in copper. The gables are intricately carved with flowers, scrolls, and crests. The lobby floors are made of Belgian marble.
The plans for the hotel initially generated some controversy, as the Château was to be constructed on what was then a portion of Major&#x27;s Hill Park. Sir Wilfrid Laurier, then the Prime Minister of Canada, helped secure the important site for the construction, and the hotel was eventually named in his honour. Laurier&#x27;s government was also subsidizing the Grand Trunk Railway&#x27;s Pacific Line. Further conflict ensued when the original architect, Bradford Gilbert from New York, was dismissed due to disagreements with Grand Trunk executives. They then engaged the Montreal firm of Ross and Macfarlane, to complete the design.
The hotel was scheduled to open on 26 April 1912. However, Hays, who was en route to Canada for the hotel opening, tragically perished aboard the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; when it sank on 15 April. Grand Trunk officials held a more subdued opening ceremony on 12 June 1912, with Sir Wilfrid Laurier in attendance. The sub-basement housed laundry, repair shops, engineering and electrical departments. A barber shop was added in 1918.

In August 1914, Major Raymond Brutinel enrolled the first recruits for the Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade (CAMGB) at the hotel. A memorial plaque with a circular bas-relief of Brigadier-General Brutinel and a bas-relief of machine gunners on Vimy Ridge is dedicated to the memory of Brutinel, who commanded the CAMGB, the members of the Canadian Machine Gun Brigade who died on active service, and in honour of those who served.

===Canadian National Railway 1923–1988===
When the Grand Trunk became part of the Canadian National Railway in 1923, the Château Laurier became one of CN&#x27;s most important hotels. In addition to serving hotel guests, the Château Laurier has also served over the years as the home of two important Ottawa institutions. From July 1924 to October 2004, the building housed the local English- and French-language radio stations of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) on the top seventh and eighth floors. Celebrated portrait photographer Yousuf Karsh maintained his studio and residence at the Château Laurier from 1972 to 1992.

In 1929, a east wing addition by Montreal architect John Archibald and CN&#x27;s architect John Schofield along Mackenzie Avenue added 240 rooms. Although the exterior of the addition had a French-inspired design, the interior lobby resembled that of an English or Scottish baronial hall. It featured dark oak panelling, a railed gallery overlooking the double-height space, and trophies of the hunt. The lobby led to a convention hall, music room and gentlemen&#x27;s lounge. The ballroom featured a vaulted ceiling, columns and rich drapes. The ultra-modern kitchen was designed to cater to up to 5,000 people. The Jasper Tea Room, designed by Edwin Holgate in 1929, featured Pacific Coast aboriginal art, columns carved into totem poles surrounding a dance floor, and lamps decorated with motifs of bears, eagles and crows. From 1929 to 1991, the Canadian Grill was a softly-lit and dark-panelled below-ground restaurant where diners ate the specialty, roast prime rib of beef au jus and danced to live music.

In 1930, the hotel added a 60-foot (18 m) indoor pool in Art Deco style. In the 1930s and 1940s, the &quot;therapeutic&quot; spas offered electric therapy, ultra-violet ray lamps and alternate streams of hot and cold water to clients with nervous afflictions, polio or back problems.

For years, the hotel thrived, playing host to royalty, heads of state, political figures, celebrities and members of Canada&#x27;s elite. R. B. Bennett lived in a suite in the hotel during his term as Canadian prime minister, from 1930 to 1935.

In the early 1960s, radio and television host Alex Trebek lived and worked in the Chateau Laurier.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the construction of numerous competing hotels in the capital, as well as the closure of Union Station, led to a slow decline in the Château&#x27;s fortunes.

In 1965, the Jasper Lounge was redecorated to resemble an English tavern called the Cock and Lion featuring oak and old brick walls. The union protested management&#x27;s decision to replace the male waiters with young women in low-cut tops to serve in the new pub, but they lost the case in court.

In March 1968, Graham Nash and Joni Mitchell stayed at the Chateau while performing concerts in Ottawa. Nash visited Mitchell&#x27;s room, where she played him 18 of her current songs. Soon thereafter, the two began a romantic relationship that would be chronicled in the songs &quot;Willy&quot; by Mitchell and &quot;Our House&quot; by Nash.

In 1981, the hotel was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. The Westin Hotel opened across the street in 1983, and the owners undertook a renovation in the 1980s to refurbish and renovate the Château Laurier, thus restoring its position as Ottawa&#x27;s pre-eminent hotel. They added a new porte-cochère on Wellington Street, lightened the lobby&#x27;s dark wood and removed the animal trophies and barbershop. The fourth floor featured a separate lounge and concierge desk. The smoke shop was transformed into the Reading Room, and a skylit boutique mall replaced the Cock and Lion lounge. In 1985, Zoe&#x27;s Lounge, named for Zoé Laurier, Sir Wilfred Laurier&#x27;s wife, opened in a new glassed-in area overlooking Rideau Street.

By 1991, Peacock Alley, a spot for socializing and &quot;to see and be seen,&quot; situated on a wide corridor on the main level extending along the west side of the hotel, was replaced by the elegant restaurant Wilfrid&#x27;s. This new restaurant offered impressive views of the Parliament Buildings, the Rideau Canal locks and the Ottawa River.

===Canadian Pacific Hotels 1988–1999===
The hotel was operated by Canadian National Hotels until the chain was purchased by Canadian Pacific Hotels in 1988.

===Fairmont Hotels and Resorts 1999–present===

In 1999, it was renamed the Fairmont Château Laurier after Canadian Pacific Hotels bought the American Fairmont hotel chain and changed its name to Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. The new look was provided by Wilfrid&#x27;s on the main level, its big windows giving light and views of the Parliament Buildings, the Rideau Canal locks and the Ottawa River.

The hotel is just metres away from some of the capital&#x27;s most important landmarks and state/diplomatic buildings, including Parliament Hill, the Rideau Canal, the National Gallery of Canada, the ByWard Market, the National War Memorial, the U.S. Embassy, and the CF Rideau Centre. Given its proximity to these buildings and the fact that it has served as a home and meeting place for many notable political figures over the years, the hotel has often been referred to as &quot;the third chamber of Parliament.&quot;

The hotel was the inspiration for the &quot;Hotel du Canada&quot; at the Canada (Epcot) pavilion in Orlando, Florida. In 2000, the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada chose the building as one of the top 500 buildings produced in Canada during the last millennium. Coinciding with its 100th anniversary, Fairmont Château Laurier was included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in Doors Open Ottawa, held 2–3 June 2012.

In 2013, Capital Hotel Limited Partnership (an affiliate of Vancouver&#x27;s Larco Investments Ltd.) purchased the hotel but retained Fairmont to manage it. In September 2016, Larco proposed a significant addition to develop suites for long-term stays. The design of the addition differs considerably from that of the original building, and has been met with criticism. Ottawa council unanimously voted to download the power to approve the renovation to city staff in June 2018. Because of an unprecedented public outcry, there was a motion to revoke Larco&#x27;s Heritage permit until it submitted a design more aligned with the original structure. That motion was defeated by Ottawa Council by a vote of 13–10 on July 11, 2019, and the project proceeded.

Despite initial proceedings, UNESCO has requested that the extension on the hotel be re-assessed, as there are concerns about the integrity of the view of the surrounding canals.

In 2018, the hotel was the setting of the dramatic web series &quot;Chateau Laurier&quot;. Due to budget constraints, however, the series was actually filmed at the Fairmont Royal York in Toronto.

<doc id="489145" wikidata="Q11680831" url="?curid=489145" title="Communication studies">
<text>Communication studies (or communication science) is an academic discipline that deals with processes of human communication and behavior, patterns of communication in interpersonal relationships, social interactions and communication in different cultures. Communication is commonly defined as giving, receiving or exchanging ideas, information, signals or messages through appropriate media, enabling individuals or groups to persuade, to seek information, to give information or to express emotions effectively. Communication studies is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge that encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation at a level of individual agency and interaction to social and cultural communication systems at a macro level.

Scholarly communication theorists focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of communication, examining statistics in order to help substantiate claims. The range of social scientific methods to study communication has been expanding. Communication researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-20th century led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of communication. Conversely, the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically, and computationally focused techniques.

As a field of study, communication is applied to journalism, business, mass media, public relations, marketing, news and television broadcasting, interpersonal and intercultural communication, education, public administration, the problem of media-adequacy—and beyond. As all spheres of human activity and conveyance are affected by the interplay between social communication structure and individual agency, communication studies has gradually expanded its focus to other domains, such as health, medicine, economy, military and penal institutions, the Internet, social capital, and the role of communicative activity in the development of scientific knowledge.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Communication, a natural human behavior, became a topic of study in the 20th century. As communication technologies developed, so did the serious study of communication. During this time, a renewed interest in the studies of rhetoric, such as persuasion and public address, was created, which ultimately laid the foundation for several of the forms of communication studies that we know of today. The focus of communication studies developed further in the 20th century, eventually including means of communication such as mass communication, interpersonal communication, and oral interpretation. When World War I ended, the interest in studying communication intensified. The methods of communication that had been used during the war had challenged the beliefs many people had on the limits of it that existed prior to these events. Innovations were invented during this period of time that no one had ever seen before, like the aircraft telephones and throat microphones. However, new ways of communicating that had been discovered, especially the use of morse code through portable morse code machines, helped troops to communicate in a much more rapid pace than ever before. This then sparked ideas for even more advanced ways of communication to later be created and discovered.

The social science study was fully recognized as a legitimate discipline after World War II. Prior to being established as its own discipline, communication studies, was formed from three other major studies no: psychology, sociology, and political science. Communication studies focus on communication as central to the human experience, which involves understanding how people behave in creating, exchanging, and interpreting messages. Today, this accepted discipline now also encompasses more modern forms of communication studies as well, such as gender and communication, intercultural communication, political communication, health communication, and organizational communication.

=== Foundations of the academic discipline ===
The institutionalization of communication studies in U.S. higher education and research has often been traced to Columbia University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where early pioneers of the field worked after the Second World War.

Wilbur Schramm is considered the founder of the field of communication studies in the United States. Schramm was hugely influential in establishing communication as a field of study and in forming departments of communication studies across universities in the United States. He was the first individual to identify himself as a communication scholar; he created the first academic degree-granting programs with communication in their name; and he trained the first generation of communication scholars. Schramm had a background in English literature and developed communication studies partly by merging existing programs in speech communication, rhetoric, and journalism. He also edited a textbook &quot;The Process and Effects of Mass Communication&quot; (1954) that helped define the field, partly by claiming Paul Lazarsfeld, Harold Lasswell, Carl Hovland, and Kurt Lewin as its founding forefathers.

Schramm established three important communication institutes: the Institute of Communications Research (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), the Institute for Communication Research (Stanford University), and the East-West Communication Institute (Honolulu). The patterns of scholarly work in communication studies that were set in motion at these institutes continue to this day. Many of Schramm&#x27;s students, such as Everett Rogers and David Berlo went on to make important contributions of their own.

The first college of communication was founded at Michigan State University in 1958, led by scholars from Schramm&#x27;s original ICR and dedicated to studying communication scientifically using a quantitative approach. MSU was soon followed by important departments of communication at Purdue University, University of Texas-Austin, Stanford University, University of Iowa, University of Illinois, University of Pennsylvania, The University of Southern California, and Northwestern University.

Associations related to Communication Studies were founded or expanded during the 1950s. The National Society for the Study of Communication (NSSC) was founded in 1950 to encourage scholars to pursue communication research as a social science. This Association launched the Journal of Communication in the same year as its founding. Like many communication associations founded around this decade, the name of the association changed with the field. In 1968 the name changed to the International Communication Association (ICA).

===In the United States===
Undergraduate curricula aim to prepare students to interrogate the nature of communication in society, and the development of communication as a specific field.

The National Communication Association (NCA) recognizes several distinct but often overlapping specializations within the broader communication discipline including: technology, critical-cultural, health, intercultural, interpersonal-small group, mass communication, organizational, political, rhetorical, and environmental communication. Students take courses in these subject areas. Other programs and courses often integrated in communication programs include journalism, rhetoric, film criticism, theatre, public relations, political science (e.g., political campaign strategies, public speaking, effects of media on elections), as well as radio, television, computer-mediated communication, film production, and new media.

Many colleges in the United States offer a variety of different majors within the realm of communication studies, consisting of programs of study in the areas mentioned above. Communication studies is often perceived by many in society as being primarily centered around the media arts, however, those that become communication studies graduates could move on to have careers in areas ranging from media arts to public advocacy to marketing to non-profit organizations and even more.

=== In Canada ===
With the early influence of federal institutional inquiries, notably the 1951 &quot;Massey Commission&quot;, which &quot;investigated the overall state of culture in Canada&quot;, the study of communication in Canada has frequently focused on the development of a cohesive national culture, and on infrastructural empires of social and material circulation. Although influenced by the American Communication tradition and British Cultural Studies, Communication studies in Canada has been more directly oriented toward the state and the policy apparatus, for example the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. Influential thinkers from the Canadian communication tradition include Harold Innis, Marshall McLuhan, Florian Sauvageau, Gertrude Robinson, Marc Raboy, Dallas Smythe, James R. Taylor, François Cooren, Gail Guthrie Valaskakis and George Grant.

Communication studies within Canada are a relatively new discipline, however, there are programs and departments to support and teach this topic in about 13 Canadian universities and many colleges as well. The Communication et information from Laval, and the Canadian Journal of Communication from McGill University in Montréal, are two journals that exist in Canada. There are also organizations and associations, both national and in Québec, that appeal to the specific interests that are targeted towards these academics. These specific journals consist of representatives from the industry of communication, the government, and members of the public as a whole.

== Scope and topics ==
Communication studies integrates aspects of both social sciences and the humanities. As a social science, the discipline overlaps with sociology, psychology, anthropology, biology, political science, economics, and public policy. From a humanities perspective, communication is concerned with rhetoric and persuasion (traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece). Humanities approaches to communication often overlap with history, philosophy, English, and cultural studies.

Communication research informs politicians and policy makers, educators, strategists, legislators, business magnates, managers, social workers, non-governmental organizations, non-profit organizations, and people interested in resolving communication issues in general. There is often a great deal of crossover between social research, cultural research, market research, and other statistical fields.

Recent critiques have been made about the homogeneity of communication scholarship. For example, Chakravartty, et al. (2018) find that white scholars comprise the vast majority of publications, citations, and editorial positions. From a post-colonial point of view, this state is problematic because communication studies engages with a wide range of social justice concerns.
=== Business ===

Business communication emerged as a field of study in the late 20th century, due to the centrality of communication within business relationships. The scope of the field is difficult to define because of the various ways in which communication is used between employers, employees, consumers, and brands. Because of this, the focus of the field is usually placed on the demands of employers, which is more universally understood by the revision of the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of business standards to emphasize written and oral communication as an important characteristic in the curriculum. Business communication studies, therefore, revolve around the, ever changing, written and oral communication aspects directly related to the field of business. Implementation of modern business communication curriculums are enhancing the study of business communication as a whole, while further preparing those to be able to effectively communicate in the business community.

=== Healthcare ===

Health communication is a multidisciplinary field that practices the application of &quot;communication evidence, strategy, theory, and creativity&quot; in order to advance the well-being of people and populations. The term was first coined in 1975 by the International Communication Association and, in 1997, Health communication was officially recognized in the broader fields of Public Health Education and Health Promotion by the American Public Health Association. The discipline integrates components of various theories and models, with a focus on social marketing. It uses marketing to develop &quot;activities and interventions designed to positively change behaviors.&quot; This emergence affected several dynamics of the healthcare system. It brought elevated awareness to different avenues including promotional activities and communication between heath professionals and their employees, patients, and constituents. &quot;Efforts to create marketing-oriented organizations called for the widespread dissemination of information&quot;, putting a spotlight on theories of &quot;communication, the communication process, and the techniques that were being utilized to communicate in other settings.&quot; Now, health care organizations of all types are using things like social media. &quot;Uses include communicating with the community and patients; enhancing organizational visibility; marketing products and services; establishing a venue for acquiring news about activities, promotions, and fund-raising; providing a channel for patient resources and education; and providing customer service and support.&quot;

<text>Neftegorsk (), formerly Vostok (, lit. &quot;east&quot;) before 1970, is a ghost town in Sakhalin Oblast, Russia.

== Founding ==
The town was built in 1963. It was an urban-type oil-mining settlement, with its name meaning &quot;Oil Town&quot;.

== Destruction ==
The town was devastated by an earthquake on May 28, 1995, which measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, killing 1,989 out of a total population of 3,977. An oil-producing town in northern Sakhalin, many buildings in Neftegorsk had been built with low-quality concrete and were not designed to withstand seismic activity. As is common in remote Russian industrial towns, almost the entire population lived in a small number of high-density four-to-five-story apartment buildings. The earthquake destroyed many of these, reducing them to piles of rubble. On multiple streets in the small town, every building collapsed and all residents were killed. Because of the comprehensive nature of the death and destruction in Neftegorsk, it was decided not to be rebuilt, and a memorial was instead constructed in the area. The monument contains aerial pictures of the town both before and immediately after its destruction, allowing visitors a sense of scale of the disaster. Many survivors were relocated to other towns in Sakhalin such as Okha, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and Nogliki, while others left Sakhalin for the mainland.

<doc id="489150" wikidata="Q5677727" url="?curid=489150" title="Harvey v. Horan">
<text>Harvey v. Horan, 278 F. 3d 370 (4th Cir. 2002), is a federal court case dealing with felons&#x27; rights of access to DNA testing. The Eastern Virginia District Court originally found that felons were entitled access to DNA testing on potentially exculpatory evidence, but this finding was later overturned by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Nevertheless, the case paved the way for the Innocence Protection Act, which ensures that convicted offenders can try to prove their innocence by requesting DNA testing on evidence in government&#x27;s possession that was used in their case.

==The case==

On April 30, 1990, James Harvey was convicted of rape and forcible sodomy by a jury in Fairfax County Circuit Court. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. One piece of evidence used to convict Harvey was restriction fragment length polymorphism (&quot;RFLP&quot;) DNA testing. The victim had two assailants, and this test prevented both Harvey and his co-defendant from being excluded as a possible source of spermatozoa recovered from the victim through conventional serology. Harvey was also implicated by testimony from his co-defendant, the victim, and a third prosecution witness. However, this testimony indicated that Harvey had not ejaculated during the attack.

Harvey did not appeal his conviction but did file a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus. His petition was rejected by the Virginia Supreme Court in 1993. On February 25, 1994, Harvey filed action in federal district court against the Governor of Virginia under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a post-Civil War civil rights statute that allows citizens to sue state and local officials in federal courts for constitutional violations. He claimed that the state&#x27;s failure to re-test biological evidence from the case was a violation of his rights under the due process clause. On July 25, 1995, the district court dismissed Harvey&#x27;s petition, finding that he had not exhausted state remedies and would have to refile his claim for DNA testing as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under .

In 1996, the New York-based Innocence Project contacted the Virginia Division of Forensic Science on Harvey&#x27;s behalf, requesting the biological evidence form the case. The Innocence Project wanted to re-test the evidence using short tandem repeat (&quot;STR&quot;) DNA testing, which was unavailable at the time of Harvey&#x27;s trial. The Division of Forensic Science recommended that the Innocence Project bring its request to the Fairfax County Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney&#x27;s office. The Innocence Project made this request in February 1998 and July 1999. In October 1999, Commonwealth attorney Robert F. Horan Jr. denied the request for access to the evidence, asserting that even if Harvey were excluded as a contributor of genetic material, it would not prove his innocence due to the testimony indicating that he had not left any biological evidence behind.

Harvey then filed action in district court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Harvey&#x27;s attorneys cited this statute, which is most often used in cases of police brutality, because Harvey&#x27;s previous lawyers had missed a filing deadline in the more common criminal appeals process. They argued that Harvey&#x27;s right to due process was infringed because he was denied access to potentially exculpatory evidence. They said that the test could be decisive if it yielded certain result — for example, if the laboratory identified DNA from two men and neither of them was Harvey. They also noted that although the prosecutor claimed that his office would allow DNA testing in appropriate cases, Fairfax had never found an appropriate case.

On April 16, 2001, in Alexandria, Virginia, U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. ruled that Horan had violated Harvey&#x27;s right to due process under the 14th and 5th Amendment by refusing the test. In a 13-page opinion, Bryan stated, &quot;due process is not a technical conception with a fixed concept unrelated to time, place and circumstances. It is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.&quot; He found that Harvey had a due process right of access to the DNA evidence under &quot;Brady v. Maryland&quot; (1963) because the material could prove to be exculpatory evidence, asserting that &quot;denying the plaintiff access to potentially powerful exculpatory evidence would result in . . . a miscarriage of justice.&quot; Significantly, Bryan also concluded that Harvey&#x27;s claim was not in effect a petition for a writ of habeas corpus because Harvey was not seeking immediate release from prison or challenging his conviction. The judge ordered Horan to send all the evidence to the Virginia State Laboratory for testing. Although Bryant&#x27;s decision was not binding in other courts, it was significant because Bryant was the first judge to issue such an order.

==The appeal==

On September 26, 2001, Horan&#x27;s lawyer, Jack L. Gould, appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. He contended that § 1983 was not an appropriate vehicle for Harvey&#x27;s action. He stated that the procedural flaws in the claim required that it be dismissed because it was really a successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus and an attempt to get around strict rules and deadlines.

On January 23, 2002, the court concluded that Harvey&#x27;s rights had not been violated and that the lower court had erred in its decision. Fourth Circuit Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III wrote the opinion, in which Judge Niemeyer joined. Judge King wrote a concurring opinion.

The majority opinion stated that the claim was, in effect, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought without leave of court. According to a previous case, &quot;Heck v. Humphrey&quot; (1994), a convicted criminal defendant cannot bring a § 1983 action that would &quot;necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence&quot; unless the defendant can prove that his &quot;conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.&quot; In this decision, the Supreme Court found that civil tort actions are &quot;not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments.&quot; As such, the majority opinion in the appeal overturned the lower court&#x27;s ruling because it found that Harvey had substantively failed to make a claim under § 1983. Judge Wilkinson wrote that Harvey had attempted to circumvent habeas corpus requirements, which required exhaustion of remedies at the state level before moving to the federal level. By bringing his claim directly to federal court under § 1983, Harvey had violated procedure:

The opinion went on to state that Harvey&#x27;s action under § 1983 &quot;sought to invalidate a final state conviction whose lawfulness has in no way been impugned&quot;. Harvey claimed that he was challenging neither the fact nor the duration of his confinement, pointing out that he merely seeks evidence which could also prove his guilt. The court found this argument to be an evasion, saying, &quot;He is trying to use a § 1983 action as a discovery device to overturn his state conviction&quot;. The majority opinion asserted that the finality of convictions could not be challenged by advances in technology:

According to the majority opinion, the only purpose of Harvey&#x27;s claim was to challenge his conviction based on evidence that was available to him at the time of his trial. As such, the court concluded that Harvey&#x27;s rights had not been violated by Horan. The court also stated that Harvey could only make his claim in habeas corpus, but that even if he had the court would be forced to dismiss it, for he had already filed such a petition in federal court.

Circuit Judge King concurred in part and in judgment with the majority decision. While he agreed that the lower court&#x27;s decision was incorrect, he also contended that Harvey&#x27;s claim could properly be brought under § 1983. The judge stated that the act of providing Harvey access to evidence did not alone necessarily imply the invalidity of Harvey&#x27;s conviction. King agrees with Harvey&#x27;s attorney, Peter J. Neufeld, that the evidence could indeed inculpate Harvey and thus that § 1983 was a proper vehicle for bringing the action. However, King determined that since the material had been available to him at trial and since he had not been denied access to the legal system or evidence known to be exculpatory, Harvey did not have a legal claim to discover evidence under &quot;Brady v. Maryland&quot;. He stated that Harvey&#x27;s claim was invalid not because he violated procedure, but because he could not prove that a state actor deprived him of a federally protected right.

==Fallout==

After the January 2002 decision was handed down, Harvey applied to Virginia&#x27;s Fairfax Circuit Court for DNA testing based on a 2001 law allowing felons increased access to potentially exculpatory biological evidence that had not previously been subjected to the current DNA testing method. On March 1, 2002, the court ordered the Division of Forensic Science to conduct the testing. On May 15, 2002, after the testing was completed, the division filed a certificate of analysis stating that Harvey could not be eliminated as a possible contributor to the sperm fractions found on the victim. On September 24, 2002, Harvey filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Virginia Supreme Court, challenging the validity of the certificate of analysis and related test results. The court dismissed the petition on June 10, 2004, saying that it did not have jurisdiction to consider it.

Back in March 2002, the federal appeal had come before the full Fourth Circuit as an en banc reconsideration (as opposed to the original three-judge panel). By this time, the issue was moot, but two judges, J. Michael Luttig and Wilkinson, wrote anyway. Luttig wrote that the &quot;right of access to evidence for tests which ... could prove beyond any doubt that the individual in fact did not commit the crime, is constitutionally required ... as a matter of basic fairness.&quot; Luttig also concluded that there is &quot;a limited, constitutional, post-conviction right of access to previously produced forensic evidence for the purpose of [DNA] testing.&quot; Wilkinson responded by expressing hope that inmates like Harvey would have access to DNA testing but that it was a matter for the legislature to decide. Significantly, his majority opinion in the original appeal stated, &quot;our decision reflects the core democratic ideal that if this entitlement is to be conferred, it should be accomplished by legislative action rather than by a federal court as a matter of constitutional right.&quot;

Wilkinson&#x27;s hopes were manifested with the passage of the bipartisan Innocence Protection Act in 2004. On February 10, 2000, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the act after devoting nearly a year to evaluating flaws in the administration of the death penalty nationwide. A few months later, the bill was introduced in the House by Bill Delahunt (D-MA) and Ray LaHood (R-IL). Innocence Project co-founders Neufeld and Barry C. Scheck testified several times over the next few years as witnesses before hearings of committee on the Act. Both mentioned the &quot;Harvey v. Horan&quot; case in their testimony, saying that it was significant for being the first federal court decision in the country to recognize a constitutional right of access to post-conviction DNA testing. The Innocence Protection Act eventually passed in the House of Representatives by an overwhelming majority (393-14) on November 5, 2003. On October 9, 2004, the legislation, which was sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy, passed unanimously in the United States Senate after narrowly moving through the Senate Judiciary Committee.

In 2009, the United States Supreme Court addressed the issue of a due process right to DNA testing in &quot;District Attorney&#x27;s Office v. Osborne&quot;. The court decided that prisoners did not have a right to the testing. The decision only affects those few states that do not have laws similar to the federal Innocence Protection Act that explicitly give prisoners a right to DNA evidence.

<text>Little Man Tate is a 1991 American drama film directed by Jodie Foster (in her directorial debut) from a screenplay written by Scott Frank. The film stars Adam Hann-Byrd as Fred Tate, a seven-year-old child prodigy who struggles to self-actualize in social and psychological settings that largely fail to accommodate his intelligence. It also stars Foster, Dianne Wiest, Harry Connick Jr., David Hyde Pierce, Debi Mazar and P.J. Ochlan.

&quot;Little Man Tate&quot; was released theatrically on October 18, 1991, by Orion Pictures to critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised Foster&#x27;s direction, Frank&#x27;s screenplay and the performances of the cast. The film grossed $25 million domestically, on a $10 million budget.

==Plot==
Dede Tate is a young working-class woman of average intelligence and strong instincts, raising her seven-year-old son, Fred, alone. Fred shows every indication of being a genius. Fred&#x27;s reading and mathematics abilities are remarkable, and he plays the piano &quot;at competition level&quot;, but his intellect has isolated him from his public school classmates. He calls his mother, who loves him unconditionally, by her first name.

Fred&#x27;s abilities come to the attention of Jane Grierson, a former music prodigy and now a psychologist running a school for gifted children. She asks permission from Dede to admit Fred to the school, in order to develop his intellectual gifts in ways that a public school cannot. Dede is reluctant, preferring that Fred have a more normal upbringing, but when no one comes to Fred&#x27;s seventh birthday party, Dede consents.

Fred joins other brilliant young people, and participates in Jane&#x27;s Odyssey of the Mind event for part of the spring. There he meets one of his heroes, who is one of Jane&#x27;s prized pupils, the brilliant but slightly bizarre &quot;Mathemagician&quot; Damon Wells, a whiz at math who wears a black cape wherever he goes. After Fred unintentionally upstages Damon at one of the competitions at Odyssey of the Mind, the latter is upset with the former. Damon, however, warms up to Fred when out horseback riding on Jane&#x27;s ranch, and is Fred&#x27;s first insight to a world outside academia. Damon tells him: &quot;It&#x27;s not the size of a man&#x27;s IQ that matters; it&#x27;s how he uses it&quot;. Jane attempts to become more nurturing, but is unable to relate to Fred as anything other than a case study.

Fred is later enrolled at a university, where he studies quantum physics while his mother, aunt and cousins travel to Florida for the summer. An adult student named Eddie accidentally hits Fred with a globe when goofing around. To make it up to Fred, Eddie takes him out for a ride on his moped and shows him things such as how to shoot pool; it is good for Fred to spend time with someone who&#x27;s not a genius. However, when he walks into Eddie&#x27;s room while he&#x27;s in bed with a woman, Fred runs out and Eddie chases after him. Eddie explains that he cannot be a babysitter for Fred; although he enjoys his company, Fred needs to find friends closer to his own age. The return to isolation takes its toll on Fred, as he suffers from nightmares in which he is treated as a freak and an outsider.

Jane is asked to bring Fred onto a TV panel discussion show on the topic of gifted children. Fred attends but breaks down. Dede tunes into the program from Florida and reacts immediately to Fred’s visual appearance, remarking to herself, “you look like hell, kid.” On the air, Fred claims his mother is dead, and recites a childish poem (a word-for-word repetition of a poem by Matt Montini, one of his former grade school classmates) before taking off his microphone and walking out of the studio. Jane is unable to find Fred, and she and her assistant Garth communicate with Dede. Dede suspects Fred has gone home to their apartment, and flies back. She finds him there, and embraces him, with him calling her &quot;mom.” Jane appears at the door, and upon seeing that Fred has what he needs, turns and walks away.

One year later, Fred continues to attend Jane’s school and has adjusted to the pressures of being a child genius, particularly after an even younger student is admitted to Jane&#x27;s school. Dede hosts a well-attended birthday party for Fred, reconciling Fred&#x27;s emotional development with his intellect.

==Cast==
==Production==
Jodie Foster, who is herself a former child prodigy, was immediately impressed by the film&#x27;s narrative and was interested in directing it. Orion Pictures was on the verge of bankruptcy at the time and was skeptical about Foster directing the film. They ultimately agreed after she offered to act in the film without payment. The film includes certain autobiographical elements from Foster&#x27;s life.

Most of the film was shot in Over-the-Rhine and downtown Cincinnati. Other locations include the Cincinnati neighborhood of Clifton; the Village of Indian Hill; the University of Cincinnati&#x27;s McMicken Hall; Miami University&#x27;s Alumni Hall, Upham Hall, Hall Auditorium and the Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity House, in Oxford, Ohio; and both the Wexner Center and the Ohio Theater in Columbus, Ohio.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In its opening weekend in North America, &quot;Little Man Tate&quot; was #6 at the box office, grossing $2.3 million. The film grossed a total of $25 million domestically, against a $10 million budget becoming a commercial success.

===Critical response===
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives &quot;Little Man Tate&quot; an approval rating of 71% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 6.30/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100 based on 5 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four and commented on how the film&#x27;s premise is similar to Foster&#x27;s life, saying; &quot;&quot;Little Man Tate&quot; is the kind of movie you enjoy watching; it&#x27;s about interesting people finding out about themselves and as Foster creates this little man who sees a lot and knows a lot but is only gradually beginning to understand a lot, we can hear echoes, perhaps, of a young girl who once found it more interesting to study French than get her picture in the fan magazines&quot;.

<text>A xanthoma (pl. xanthomas or xanthomata) (condition: xanthomatosis) is a deposition of yellowish cholesterol-rich material that can appear anywhere in the body in various disease states. They are cutaneous manifestations of lipidosis in which lipids accumulate in large foam cells within the skin. They are associated with hyperlipidemias, both primary and secondary types.

Tendon xanthomas are associated with type II hyperlipidemia, chronic biliary tract obstruction, primary biliary cirrhosis, sitosterolemia and the rare metabolic disease cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis. Palmar xanthomata and tuberoeruptive xanthomata (over knees and elbows) occur in type III hyperlipidemia.

==Etymology==
The term xanthoma stems from Greek ξανθός (xanthós) &#x27;yellow&#x27;, and -ωμα -oma, a suffix forming nouns indicating a mass or tumor.

==Types==

===Xanthelasma===

A xanthelasma is a sharply demarcated yellowish collection of cholesterol underneath the skin, usually on or around the eyelids. Strictly, a xanthelasma is a distinct condition, being called a xanthoma only when becoming larger and nodular, assuming tumorous proportions. Still, it is often classified simply as a subtype of xanthoma.

===Xanthoma tuberosum===
Xanthoma tuberosum (also known as tuberous xanthoma) is characterized by xanthomas located over tuberosity of the joints.

===Xanthoma tendinosum===
Xanthoma tendinosum (also tendon xanthoma or tendinous xanthoma) is clinically characterized by papules and nodules found in the tendons of the hands, feet, and heel. Also associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).

===Eruptive xanthoma===
Eruptive xanthoma (ILDS E78.220) is clinically characterized by small, yellowish-orange to reddish-brown papules surrounded by an erythematous halo that appear suddenly all over the body, especially the hands, buttocks, and the extensor surfaces of the extremities. It tends to be associated with elevated triglycerides.

===Xanthoma planum===
Xanthoma planum (ILDS D76.370), also known as plane xanthoma, is clinically characterized by bands or rectangular plates (macules) and plaques in the dermis spread diffusely over large areas of the body.

===Palmar xanthoma===
Palmar xanthoma is clinically characterized by yellowish plaques that involve the palms and flexural surfaces of the fingers. Palmar xanthomas are characterised by yellowish to orange, flat macules or slightly elevated plaques, often with a central white area which may be localised or generalised. They often arise in the skin folds, especially the palmar creases. They occur in hyperlipoproteinaemia type III and type IIA, and in association with biliary cirrhosis. The presence of palmar xanthomata, like the presence of tendinous xanthomata, is indicative of hypercholesterolaemia.

===Tuberoeruptive xanthoma===
Tuberoeruptive xanthoma (ILDS E78.210) is clinically characterized by red papules and nodules that appear inflamed and tend to coalesce. Tuberous xanthomata are considered similar, and within the same disease spectrum as eruptive xanthomata.

===Other types===
Other types of xanthoma identified in the Medical Dictionary include:
* Xanthoma diabeticorum: a type of eruptive xanthoma, often with severe diabetes.
* Xanthoma disseminatum: a rare xanthoma consisting of non-X histiocytes on flexural (folded) surfaces, associated with diabetes insipidus.
* Verrucous xanthoma, or histiocytosis Y: a papilloma of the oral mucosa and skin whereby the connective tissue under the epithelium contains histiocytes.

<doc id="489163" wikidata="Q1932122" url="?curid=489163" title="A Night to Remember (Cyndi Lauper album)">
<text>A Night to Remember is the third studio album by American singer Cyndi Lauper, released on May 9, 1989, by Epic Records. The album was originally set to be released in 1988, under the name &quot;Kindred Spirit&quot;, but was delayed until 1989 and the songs from the initial project were reworked. Although the album managed to score a top-10 single, it did not enjoy the commercial success of her previous two albums, and was met with mixed-to-poor reviews and in interviews, Lauper refers to it as &quot;A Night to Forget&quot;. Worldwide, the album has sold more than 1.5 million copies.

==Background and production==
The album was originally conceptualized as a project called &quot;Kindred Spirit&quot;, due for release in October 1988, and was going to include the track &quot;Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China)&quot;, but when that song and the film it was featured in, &quot;Vibes&quot;, were unsuccessful, the album was reworked. The original &quot;Kindred Spirit&quot; tracklist included 10 songs, eight of which were eventually included on the final album. The two songs that were removed were &quot;Hole in My Heart,&quot; which would only appear on Japanese CD editions of &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back,&quot; written by Lauper and John Turi, which remains unreleased. The songs &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, &quot;Dancing With a Stranger&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be Your Friend&quot; were added to the tracklist later on after the release date was pushed back to 1989, with the other songs being remixed some time between their original 1988 planned release date and their eventual release. The song &quot;My First Night Without You&quot; was previewed in October 1988 at CBS UK&#x27;s annual conference, and the album was still known as &quot;Kindred Spirit&quot; at the time. By March 1989, the album&#x27;s title had changed to &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; and was initially announced for an April release with this title. Some proof sheets of the original album artwork exist with the alternate title and track listing.

&quot;Unabbreviated Love,&quot; penned by Lauper, Dusty Micale and Franke Previte, was recorded for the album but only appeared on the B-side of the &quot;My First Night Without You&quot; single.

The photo used in the album&#x27;s final cover artwork was taken at the intersection of Plymouth and Pearl Streets, just east of the Manhattan Bridge, in Brooklyn, New York.

==Critical reception==
Critically, the album was met with mixed-to-poor reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic website retrospectively gave the album two out of five stars and wrote that with the album Lauper tried &quot;becoming a self-consciously &quot;mature&quot; singer/songwriter&quot; and that the album&#x27;s songs didn&#x27;t &quot;always work&quot; except for &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; which made &quot;a lasting impression&quot; and illustrated &quot;what Lauper was attempting to achieve with the record&quot;. Chris Heim of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; pointed out that the album bears the same name as the 1958 film about the Titanic; he gave the album two and a half stars out of five and wrote that the &quot;crisp&quot; and &quot;spunky&quot; production and the &quot;appealing&quot; vocals &quot;can&#x27;t quite keep this album and its predictable pop love song cargo afloat.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; singled out Lauper&#x27;s voice as a strong point, while noting the material was inconsistent. Other reviewers were more harsh: &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;&#x27;s &quot;anonymous vocals, songs full of submissive cliches and slapdash production&quot;, while &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, in comparing the album to Lauper&#x27;s previous work, declared &quot;How embarrassing to have placed hope in this woman.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine gave the album a &#x27;spotlight&#x27; in its album reviews section for the May 20, 1989, issue. Despite this, the album was described as having &quot;somewhat unchallenging settings&quot;, though the lead single &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; was marked out as a &quot;solid&quot; start to the album campaign and album track &quot;Like a Cat&quot; was also highlighted as of interest. &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; gave a positive review of the album, calling it &quot;wayward, girlish pop aimed firmly at the charts&quot; as well as &quot;clever and sophisticated&quot;, and named it one of its &quot;albums of the week&quot;.

In a review for Cyndi&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Sisters of Avalon&quot;, &quot;People&quot; magazine retrospectively described &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; as &quot;joyless&quot; and blamed the album for her decline in popularity, stating that the album caused &quot;a large chunk of her considerable following&quot; to move on.

==Commercial performance==
The album sold moderately well but did not enjoy the same commercial success of her two previous albums, despite the success of the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;, which became a Top 10 hit, her last in the U.S.A., earning Lauper a Grammy nomination. In the UK, however, &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; was Lauper&#x27;s highest-charting album, peaking at No.9. According to the book &quot;St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture&quot; (Volume 3), the album sold half a million copies in the United States in 1989.

Although the album is called &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, Lauper jokingly preferred to call it &quot;A Night to Forget&quot;, given its poor reviews and disappointing sales, compounded by the problems she encountered with producer and boyfriend David Wolf⁠f during the production of the album. Although not certified by RIAA, BPI and others trade associations, according to Lauper&#x27;s official website, the album was certified platinum in Australia and United Kingdom and gold in Germany, Italy and United States. As of November 1989, the album had sold 1.3 million copies worldwide.

==Singles and popular album tracks==
* &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; was the album&#x27;s lead single and was released in April 1989. It was the most successful single from the album, reaching the top 10 of the singles charts in Canada, France, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the top 20 in Australia, Ireland, Finland and West Germany.
* &quot;My First Night Without You&quot; was released in July 1989 as the second single from the album worldwide. The song failed to achieve the same success as &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;, stalling at no. 62 in the United States and reaching low Top 50 positions in Australia, Belgium and France.
* &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; was the album&#x27;s third single in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, though failed to reach the top 100 in any of these territories.
* &quot;Heading West&quot; was released in December 1989 as the third single in the United Kingdom, where it reached no. 68 on the singles chart. It was also released as the third single from the album in Australia, Japan and continental Europe.
* &quot;Primitive&quot; was released in early 1990 as the fourth European single from the album but did not enter any singles charts. &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; named the song as a &quot;sure hit&quot; and described it as a &quot;punchy rock song&quot; with a &quot;good dance beat&quot;.
* &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; was released in 1991 as an exclusive single in Hong Kong.

Despite not yet being a single, &quot;Primitive&quot; did receive airplay in Greece beginning in June 1989. &quot;Insecurious&quot; received radio adds in the United Kingdom in July 1989, but never became a single despite this. Soon after the album&#x27;s release in Japan, &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; began receiving airplay on the radio station J-Wave in May 1989.

<text>Baron Acton, of Aldenham in the County of Shropshire, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 11 December 1869 for Sir John Dalberg-Acton, 8th Baronet, a prominent historian and Liberal Member of Parliament.

His son, the second Baron, was a diplomat and also held minor office in the Liberal administrations of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith. In 1919, he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Lyon, which was that of his father-in-law. His son, the third Baron, sold the family home in 1947 and settled in Rhodesia. The fourth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1989, lost his seat in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. However, on 17 April 2000, he was created a life peer as Baron Acton of Bridgnorth, of Aldenham in the County of Shropshire. Consequently, Lord Acton was able to return to the House of Lords, where he sat on the Labour benches. As of 2014, the titles are held by his son, the fifth Baron, who succeeded in 2010.

The Acton Baronetcy, of Aldenham in the County of Shropshire, was created in the Baronetage of England on 17 January 1644 for Edward Acton. He represented Bridgnorth in both the Short Parliament and the Long Parliament, and he was a supporter of Charles I during the Civil War. His son, the second Baronet, grandson, the third Baronet, and great-grandson, the fourth Baronet, all sat as Members of Parliament for Bridgnorth. On the death of the latter&#x27;s son, the fifth Baronet, the line of the eldest son of the second Baronet failed.

The title was inherited by the fifth Baronet&#x27;s second cousin once removed, the sixth Baronet. He was the son of Edward Acton, who had settled in Besançon in France as a physician; Edward (of Besançon) was the son of another Edward, son of Walter, second son of Sir Walter Acton (the second Baronet). The sixth Baronet served as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Naples and married his niece, Mary Anne Acton. He was created &quot;Duke of Modica&quot; by King Ferdinand III of Sicily but later renounced the title. Their second son, Charles Januarius Edward Acton, known as Cardinal Acton, was a prominent clergyman in the Catholic Church. 

Upon the sixth Baronet&#x27;s death in 1811, he was succeeded by his eldest son, the seventh Baronet. In 1832, he married Marie Louise Pelline von Dalberg, only child and heiress of Emmerich Joseph von Dalberg, Duke of Dalberg, a member of an ancient German aristocratic family. The Actons became heirs to the Marquess of Groppoli in Tuscany through the Duke&#x27;s wife Pellina Brignole-Sale. In 1833, the seventh Baronet assumed by Royal Licence the surname of Dalberg-Acton. He was succeeded by his son, the eighth Baronet, who in 1869 was elevated to the peerage as Baron Acton. 

In 1919, the second Baron assumed by Royal Licence the surname of Lyon-Dalberg-Acton. In 2010, upon the death of the fourth Baron, the Acton titles of baronet and baron passed to John Lyon-Dalberg-Acton. As of 31 December 2013, he has not formally proven his succession to the baronetcy and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy formally considered dormant.

The family seat was Aldenham Park near Bridgnorth, Shropshire, which was sold in 1959.

==Coat of arms==
The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the Lyon-Dalberg-Acton family is: Quarterly: 1st and 4th: &quot;Gules, semée of cross crosslets fitchée or two lions passant guardant in pale argent&quot; (for Acton); 2nd, quarterly: 1st and 4th: &quot;Azure, six fleurs-de-lis three two and one argent a chief dancetty of the last&quot;; 2nd and 3rd: &quot;Or, a cross patonce gules over all an escutcheon gules thereon a tower argent a chief dancetty of the last&quot; (for Dalberg); 3rd: &quot;Azure, a lion passant or between three plates each charged with a griffin&#x27;s head erased sable&quot; (for Lyon).

Alfredo Acton was awarded the title of baron in the Kingdom of Italy by &quot;motu proprio&quot; of Victor Emmanuel III in February 1925. From the marriage of Alfredo Acton with Livia Giudice Caracciolo, &quot;nobile dei principi&quot; of Villa and Cellammare (1878–1963), the Acton family received the title of Prince of Leporano and Neapolitan patrician. The title of the Kingdom of Naples was created on 1 January 1626 for Don Sergio Muscettola (d. 1646) passed to the Caracciolo family in the 19th century and then went to the Acton family.

In 1979, 30 June, Don Ferdinando obtained from Royal Letters Patent of Umberto II the renewal of the title of Duke of Spezzano and Count of Picerno with the confirmation of transmissibility of the titles to his daughter Maria Eleonora.

<doc id="489171" wikidata="Q381218" url="?curid=489171" title="Karel De Gucht">
<text>Karel Lodewijk Georgette Emmerence De Gucht (; born 27 January 1954) is a Belgian politician who was the European Commissioner for Trade from February 2010 until 31 October 2014. Previously, he served as Belgium&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2004 to 2009 and as the European Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response from 2009 to 2010.

==Early life and education==
De Gucht was born in Overmere, Belgium. He entered politics at a young age, and became president of the Flemish Liberal Students while studying at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Brussels. He graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in Law and practised as a lawyer, mainly in commercial matters, at the bar of Ghent. He later taught European Law at his university.

==Political career==
===Member of the European Parliament, 1980–1994===
De Gucht became a member of the European Parliament in 1980 and fulfilled this mandate until 1994. In 1989 he was the rapporteur of a landmark Parliamentary Declaration on the Fundamental Rights, leading eventually to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which was later integrated as an essential part of the Treaty of Lisbon.

===Career in national politics===
De Gucht entered the Flemish Parliament after the elections of 1994 and moved to the Belgian Federal Parliament in 2003, where he remained until 2004. In 1999 he was elected party president of the Flemish liberal party (Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten). Although he was elected to the Federal Parliament in the general election on 18 May 2003 and to the European Parliament in the elections of June 2004, he occupied the first seat only very briefly and the second not at all.

He entered the Belgian government on 18 July 2004 as Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs. He served as deputy prime minister in 2008–2009. He was Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE in 2006. He was a Member of the Security Council of the United Nations (2007–08) and Member of the European Council (2004–09).

===European Commission, 2009–2014===
In July 2009 De Gucht was appointed as the Belgian European Commissioner, in succession of Louis Michel. Like his predecessor, he was in charge of Development and Humanitarian Aid, but from February 2010 onwards, he became Commissioner of Trade in the Barroso II Commission, until 31 October 2014.

He prepared and launched free trade negotiations with the United States, the so-called Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). He achieved important trade agreements, among others with South-Korea (2011), Colombia and Peru (2013), Central America, Singapore, Georgia, Moldavia and Ukraine (2014). In October 2014 he concluded CETA, the free trade agreement with Canada and the first ever agreement with a G7 member. He oversaw the start of trade negotiations with Japan and Vietnam, resumed talks with Mercosur and began investment agreement negotiations with China. He also concluded landmark economic partnership agreements with West Africa (ECOWAS), South Africa (SADC) and Eastern Africa (EAC), covering together 75% of African economy.

De Gucht performed his ultimate duty as a commissioner by signing in Nairobi on 31 October 2014 the agreement with the Eastern African Community (EAC), consisting of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. He also played a key role in the conclusion of an Association Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine, which was a direct cause of Euromaidan and the Revolution of Dignity.

At the end of his mandate he enjoyed a strong reputation within the European Commission because of the progression in the trade portfolio during his mandate and because of his strong views on European policy questions. At the end of this mandate he decided to leave politics, except on the local level, where he will be the chairman of the local council.
==Controversies==
De Gucht is well known for his outspoken views on different political issues.

On a trip to Africa in late 2004, De Gucht sparked a diplomatic controversy when he said that &quot;there is a problem with the political class in the Congo&quot; and questioned its ability to tackle corruption. De Gucht received a lot of informal support in diplomatic circles and media and refused to retract his statement. Subsequent news stories suggested his concerns were well-founded.

In November 2008 he was accused by an anonymous person and by the president of the extreme-right party Vlaams Belang of insider trading. The Ghent public prosecutor ultimately decided not to pursue an investigation in the matter stating that &quot;from the investigations it appears that Mr. De Gucht has never abused his inside knowledge of the Fortis situation, more specifically the loss in the value of its shares&quot;, and closed the case.

Later in his career, De Gucht caused controversy by his active promotion of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Some critics accused him of being over-enthusiastic about the TTIP, playing down potential risks to European small and medium-sized companies associated with the so-called Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism, and even of ignoring public concerns about the ISDS.

<doc id="489173" wikidata="Q378681" url="?curid=489173" title="Peripheral artery disease">
<text>Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a vascular disorder that causes abnormal narrowing of arteries other than those that supply the heart or brain. PAD can happen in any blood vessel, but it is more common in the legs than the arms.

When narrowing occurs in the heart, it is called coronary artery disease (CAD), and in the brain, it is called cerebrovascular disease. Peripheral artery disease most commonly affects the legs, but other arteries may also be involved, such as those of the arms, neck, or kidneys.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a form of peripheral vascular disease. Vascular refers to the arteries and veins within the body. PAD differs from peripheral veinous disease. PAD means the arteries are narrowed or blocked—the vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood as it moves from the heart to other parts of the body. Peripheral veinous disease, on the other hand, refers to problems with veins—the vessels that bring the blood back to the heart.

The classic symptom is leg pain when walking, which resolves with rest and is known as intermittent claudication. Other symptoms include skin ulcers, bluish skin, cold skin, or abnormal nail and hair growth in the affected leg. Complications may include an infection or tissue death, which may require amputation; coronary artery disease; or stroke. Up to 50% of people with PAD do not have symptoms.

The greatest risk factor for PAD is cigarette smoking. Other risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems, and high blood cholesterol. PAD is primarily caused by the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries, which is called atherosclerosis, especially in individuals over 40 years old. Other mechanisms include artery spasm, blood clots, trauma, fibromuscular dysplasia, and vasculitis. PAD is typically diagnosed by finding an ankle-brachial index (ABI) less than 0.90, which is the systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure of the arm. Duplex ultrasonography and angiography may also be used. Angiography is more accurate and allows for treatment at the same time; however, it is associated with greater risks.
It is unclear if screening for peripheral artery disease in people without symptoms is useful, as it has not been properly studied. For those with intermittent claudication from PAD, stopping smoking and supervised exercise therapy may improve outcomes. Medications, including statins, ACE inhibitors, and cilostazol, may also help. Aspirin, which helps with thinning the blood and thus improving blood flow, does not appear to help those with mild disease but is usually recommended for those with more significant disease due to the increased risk of heart attacks. Anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin show no definitive scientific evidence of benefit in PAD. Surgical procedures used to treat PAD include bypass grafting, angioplasty, and atherectomy.
In 2015, about 155 million people had PAD worldwide. It becomes more common with age. In the developed world, it affects about 5.3% of 45- to 50-year-olds and 18.6% of 85- to 90-year-olds. In the developing world, it affects 4.6% of people between the ages of 45 and 50 and 15% of people between the ages of 85 and 90. PAD in the developed world is equally common among men and women, though in the developing world, women are more commonly affected. In 2015, PAD resulted in about 52,500 deaths, which is an increase from the 16,000 deaths in 1990.

==Signs and symptoms==

The signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease are based on the affected body part. About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms. The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication (IC), which typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain is usually located in the calf muscles of the affected leg and is relieved by rest. This occurs because during exercise, the muscles require more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised muscle. However, in PAD, the artery cannot respond appropriately to the increased muscular demand for oxygen. Therefore, the muscles are deprived of oxygen, leading to muscle pain that subsides with rest.

Other symptoms may include:
* Pain, aches, and/or cramps in the buttocks, hip, or thigh
* Muscle atrophy (muscle loss) of the affected limb
* Hair loss of the affected limb
* Skin that is smooth, shiny, or cool to the touch in the affected area
* Decreased or absent pulse in the feet
* Cold and/or numbness in the toes
* Sores/ulcers on the affected limb that do not heal

In individuals with severe PAD, complications may arise, including critical limb ischemia and gangrene. Critical limb ischemia occurs when the obstruction of blood flow in the artery is compromised to the point where the blood cannot maintain oxygenation of the tissue at rest. This can lead to pain at rest, a feeling of coldness, or numbness in the affected foot and toes. Other complications of severe PAD include lower limb tissue loss (amputation), arterial insufficiency ulcers, erectile dysfunction, and gangrene. People with diabetes are affected by gangrene of the feet at a rate that is 30 times higher than the unaffected population. Many of these severe complications, such as those leading to amputation, are irreversible.

==Causes==

=== Risk factors ===

Factors contributing to an increased risk of PAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis. These include age, sex, and ethnicity. PAD is twice as common in males as in females. In terms of ethnicity, PAD is more common in people of color compared to the white population in a 2:1 ratio. The factors with the greatest risk associations are hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. Presenting three of these factors or more increases the risk of developing PAD tenfold.
* Smoking – Tobacco use in any form is the single greatest risk factor for peripheral artery disease internationally. Smokers have up to a 10-fold increase in the risk of PAD in a dose-response relationship. Exposure to second-hand smoke has also been shown to promote changes in the lining of blood vessels (endothelium), which can lead to atherosclerosis. Smokers are 2–3 times more likely to have lower extremity PAD than coronary artery disease. Greater than 80%–90% of patients with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease are current or former smokers. The risk of PAD increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years smoked.
* High blood sugar – Diabetes mellitus is shown to increase the risk of PAD by 2–4 fold. It does this by causing endothelial and smooth-muscle cell dysfunction in peripheral arteries. The risk of developing lower extremity peripheral arterial disease is proportional to the severity and duration of diabetes.
* High blood cholesterol – Dyslipidemia is an unhealthy pattern of cholesterol or fat in the blood. Dyslipidemia is characterized by a high level of a protein called low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol), low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol), elevation of total cholesterol, and/or high triglyceride levels. This abnormality in blood cholesterol levels has been correlated with accelerated peripheral artery disease. Management of dyslipidemia by diet, exercise, and/or medication is associated with a major reduction in rates of heart attack and stroke.
* High blood pressure – Hypertension or elevated blood pressure can increase a person&#x27;s risk of developing PAD. Similarly to PAD, there is a known association between high blood pressure and heart attacks, strokes, and abdominal aortic aneurysms. High blood pressure increases the risk of intermittent claudication, the most common symptom of PAD, by 2.5- to 4-fold in men and women, respectively.
* Other risk factors that are being studied include levels of various inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, homocysteine, and lipoprotein A. Individuals with increased levels of homocysteine in their blood have a 2-fold risk of developing peripheral artery disease. While there are genetic factors leading to risk factors for peripheral artery disease, including diabetes and high blood pressure, there have been no specific genes or gene mutations directly associated with the development of peripheral artery disease.

===High risk populations===
Peripheral arterial disease is more common in these populations:
* All people who have leg symptoms with exertion (suggestive of claudication) or ischemic rest pain
* All people aged 65 years and over, regardless of risk factor status
* All people between 50 and 69 who have a cardiovascular risk factor (particularly diabetes or smoking)
* Age less than 50 years, with diabetes and one other atherosclerosis risk factor (smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or hyperhomocysteinemia)
* Individuals with an abnormal lower extremity pulse examination
* Those with known atherosclerotic coronary, carotid, or renal artery disease
* All people with a Framingham risk score of 10%–20%
* All people who have previously experienced chest pain

== Etiology and pathophysiology ==

Peripheral arterial disease is considered to be a set of chronic or acute syndromes, generally derived from the presence of occlusive arterial disease, which causes inadequate blood flow to the limbs.

As previously mentioned, the most common etiology of peripheral artery disease, especially in patients over 40 years old, is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a narrowing of the arteries caused by lipid or fat buildup and calcium deposition in the wall of the affected arteries.

The pathophysiology of atherosclerosis involves complex interactions between cholesterol and vascular cells. In the early stages of PAD, the arteries compensate for plaque buildup by dilating to preserve flow through the vessel. Eventually, the artery cannot dilate further, and the atherosclerotic plaque narrows the arterial flow lumen.

When there is an imbalance between the needs of the peripheral tissues and the blood supply, the affected person is faced with ischemia.

From the pathophysiologic point of view, a restriction of blood supply (ischemia) to the lower limbs can be classified as either functional or critical. Functional ischemia occurs when the blood flow is normal at rest but insufficient during exercise, presenting clinically as intermittent claudication. Critical ischemia is produced when the reduction in blood flow results in a perfusion deficit at rest and is defined by the presence of pain at rest or trophic lesions in the legs. In this situation, precise diagnosis is fundamental, as there is a clear risk of limb loss if adequate blood flow is not re-established, either by surgery or endovascular therapy. Differentiating between the two concepts is important to establish the therapeutic indication and the prognosis in patients with PAD.

Other causes include vasculitis and &quot;in situ&quot; thrombosis related to hypercoagulable states. Additional mechanisms of peripheral artery disease include arterial spasm and fibromuscular dysplasia. The cause and pathophysiology of arterial spasm are not fully understood, but it is hypothesized that they can occur secondary to trauma. The symptoms of claudication ensue when the artery spasms, or clamps down on itself, creating an obstruction. Like atherosclerosis, this leads to decreased blood flow to the tissue downstream of the obstruction. Thrombosis, or the formation of a blood clot, usually occurs due to stasis or trauma.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosing or identifying peripheral artery disease requires a history of symptoms and a physical exam, followed by confirmatory testing. These tests could include CT scans (Computed Tomographic Angiography), MRA scans (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), or ultrasounds for imaging. A physician will examine an individual for specific exam findings if symptoms are consistent with peripheral artery disease. Abnormal physical exam findings can lead a healthcare provider to consider the diagnosis. However, to confirm a diagnosis, confirmatory testing is required.

These findings are associated with peripheral artery disease:
* Decreased or absent pulses
* Muscle atrophy or wasting
* Noticeable blueness of the affected limb
* Decreased temperature (coolness) in the affected limb when compared to the other
* Thickened nails
* Smooth or shiny skin and hair loss
* Buerger&#x27;s test can check for pallor when the affected limb is in an elevated position. The limb is then moved from an elevated to a sitting position and checked for redness, which is called reactive hyperemia. Buerger&#x27;s test is an assessment of arterial sufficiency, which is the ability of the artery to supply oxygenated blood to the tissue that it goes to.
* Nonhealing lower extremity wound

If peripheral artery disease is suspected, the initial study is the ankle–brachial index (ABI). The ABI is a simple, non-invasive test that measures the ratio of systolic blood pressure in the ankle to the systolic blood pressure in the upper arm. This is based on the idea that if blood pressure readings in the ankle are lower than those in the arm, a blockage in the arteries that provide blood from the heart to the ankle is suspected. An ABI range of 0.90 to 1.40 is considered normal. A person is considered to have PAD when the ABI is ≤ 0.90. However, PAD can be further graded as mild to moderate if the ABI is between 0.41 and 0.90, and severe if the ABI is less than 0.40. These categories can provide insight into the disease course. Furthermore, ABI values of 0.91 to 0.99 are considered borderline, and values &gt;1.40 indicate noncompressible arteries. If an ABI &gt;1.40 is calculated, this could indicate vessel wall stiffness caused by calcification, which can occur in people with uncontrolled diabetes. Abnormally high ABIs (&gt;1.40) are usually considered false negatives, and thus, such results merit further investigation and higher-level studies. Individuals with noncompressible arteries have an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality within two years.

Individuals with suspected PAD with normal ABIs can undergo exercise testing for ABI. A baseline ABI is obtained before exercise. The patient is then asked to exercise (usually patients are made to walk on a treadmill at a constant speed) until claudication pain occurs (for a maximum of 5 minutes), after which the ankle pressure is again measured. A decrease in ABI of 15%–20% would be diagnostic of PAD.

If ABIs are abnormal, the next step is generally a lower limb Doppler ultrasound to look at the site of obstruction and the extent of atherosclerosis. Other imaging can be performed by angiography, where a catheter is inserted into the common femoral artery and selectively guided to the artery in question. While injecting a radio-dense contrast agent, an X-ray is taken. Any blood flow-limiting blockage found in the X-ray can be identified and treated by procedures including atherectomy, angioplasty, or stenting. Contrast angiography is the most readily available and widely used imaging technique. Modern computerized tomography (CT) scanners provide direct imaging of the arterial system. Studies have shown the sensitivity and specificity of CT in identifying lesions with &gt;50% stenosis to be 95% and 96%, respectively. As such, CT may be considered as an alternative to invasive angiography. An important distinction between the two is that, unlike invasive angiography, assessment of the arterial system with CT does not allow for vascular intervention.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a noninvasive diagnostic procedure that uses a combination of a large magnet, radio frequencies, and a computer to produce detailed images of blood vessels inside the body. The advantages of MRA include its safety and ability to provide high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging of the entire abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities in one sitting.

===Classification===

The two most commonly used methods to classify peripheral artery disease are the Fontaine and Rutherford classification systems. The Fontaine stages were introduced by René Fontaine in 1954 to define the severity of chronic limb ischemia:
* Stage I: asymptomatic
* Stage IIa: intermittent claudication after walking a distance of more than 200 meters
* Stage IIb: intermittent claudication after walking a distance of less than 200 meters
* Stage III: rest pain
* Stage IV: ulcers or gangrene of the limb

The Rutherford classification was created by the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society of Cardiovascular Surgery, introduced in 1986 and revised in 1997 (and known as the Rutherford classification after the lead author, Robert B. Rutherford). This classification system consists of four grades and seven categories (categories 0–6):
* Grade 0, Category 0: asymptomatic
* Grade I, Category 1: mild claudication
* Grade I, Category 2: moderate claudication
* Grade I, Category 3: severe claudication
* Grade II, Category 4: rest pain
* Grade III, Category 5: minor tissue loss; ischemic ulceration not exceeding ulcer of the digits of the foot
* Grade IV, Category 6: major tissue loss; severe ischemic ulcers or frank gangrene

Moderate to severe PAD, classified by Fontaine&#x27;s stages III to IV or Rutherford&#x27;s categories 4 to 5, presents a limb threat (risk of limb loss) in the form of critical limb ischemia.

Recently, the Society for Vascular Surgery came out with a classification system based on &quot;wound, ischemia and foot infection&quot; (WIfI). This classification system, published in 2013, was created to account for the demographic changes that have occurred over the past forty years, including the increased incidence of high blood sugar and evolving techniques and abilities for revascularization. This system was created on the basis that ischemia and angiographic disease patterns are not the sole determinants of amputation risk. The WIfI classification system is broken up into two parts: wounds and ischemia. Wounds are graded 0 through 3 based on the presence of ulceration, gangrene, and ischemia.
* Grade 0: no ulcer, no gangrene
* Grade 1: small, shallow ulcer; no gangrene
* Grade 2: deep ulcer with exposed tendon or bone, gangrene limited to toes
* Grade 3: extensive, full-thickness ulcer; gangrene extending to the forefoot or midfoot

Ischemia is graded 0 through 3 based on ABI, ankle systolic pressure, and toe pressure.
* Grade 0: ABI ≥0.80, ankle systolic pressure ≥100 mm Hg, toe pressure ≥60 mm Hg
* Grade 1: arterial brachial index 0.6 to 0.79, ankle systolic pressure 70 to 100 mm Hg, toe pressure 40 to 59 mm Hg
* Grade 2: ABI 0.4–0.59, ankle systolic pressure 50 to 70 mm Hg, toe pressure 30 to 39 mm Hg
* Grade 3: ABI ≤0.39, ankle systolic pressure &lt;50 mm Hg, toe pressure &lt;30 mm Hg

The TASC (and TASC II) classification suggests PAD treatment is based on the severity of the disease seen on an angiogram.

===Screening===
It is unclear if screening for disease in the general population is useful, as it has not been extensively studied. This includes screening with the ankle-brachial index (ABI), although a systematic review of the literature did not support the use of routine ABI screening in asymptomatic patients.

Testing for coronary artery disease or carotid artery disease is of unclear benefit. While PAD is a risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), there is no data on screening individuals with asymptomatic PAD for abdominal aortic aneurysms. For people with symptomatic PAD, screening by ultrasound for AAA is not unreasonable.

===Wearable devices and remote patient monitoring===
A 2022 review found that a variety of wearable medical devices measuring different parameters (such as body temperature) were being combined with remote patient monitoring of PAD patients, to improve health outcomes.

Some studies propose the development of devices measuring oxygen continuously during exercise. This is because resting perfusion and metabolic activity are extremely low and differences between non-patients and PAD patients are barely measurable. As such, testing of vascular function and energetics requires a physiological challenge. Pulse oximeters can be inconvenient to wear during exercise and only give oxygen values at discrete time points, nor is there sufficient evidence to support any use in identifying PAD. Some publications and studies therefore discuss the use of wearable sensors measuring oxygen levels continuously in PAD patients, such as through transcutaneous means. However, because transcutaneous measurements are affected by movement (such as during exercise) and body temperature, the use of oxygen sensors that are inserted subcutaneously as opposed to transcutaneously may most effectively help monitor a PAD patient’s progress and direct therapy decisions. To date, one oxygen sensing system has been approved for use in Europe to measure tissue perfusion in all PAD patients.

==Treatment==
Depending on the severity of the disease, these steps can be taken, according to these guidelines:

===Lifestyle===
* Stopping smoking (cigarettes promote PAD and are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease)
* Regular exercise for those with claudication helps open up alternative small vessels (collateral flow), and the limitation in walking often improves. Treadmill exercise (35 to 50 minutes, three or four times per week) has been reviewed as another treatment with several positive outcomes, including a reduction in cardiovascular events and improved quality of life. Supervised exercise programs increase pain-free walking time and the maximum walking distance in people with PAD.

===Medication===
* Management of diabetes
* Management of hypertension
* Management of high cholesterol, and antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel. Statins reduce clot formation and cholesterol levels, respectively, and can help with disease progression and address the other cardiovascular risks that the affected person is likely to have.

According to guidelines, taking aspirin or clopidogrel is recommended to reduce AMI (&quot;heart attack&quot;), stroke, and other causes of vascular death in people with symptomatic peripheral artery disease. It is recommended that aspirin and clopidogrel be taken alone and not in conjunction with one another (i.e., not as dual antiplatelet therapy). The recommended daily dosage of aspirin for treating PAD is between 75 and 325 mg, while the recommended daily dosage for clopidogrel is 75 mg. The effectiveness of both aspirin and clopidogrel to reduce the risk of cardiovascular ischemic events in people with symptomatic PAD is not well established. Research also suggests that low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin is effective as a new anti-thrombotic regimen for PAD.

Cilostazol can improve symptoms in some people. Pentoxifylline is of unclear benefit. Cilostazol may improve walking distance for people who experience claudication due to peripheral artery disease, but no strong evidence suggests that it improves the quality of life, decreases mortality, or decreases the risk of cardiovascular events.

Treatment with other drugs or vitamins is unsupported by clinical evidence, &quot;but trials evaluating the effect of folate and vitamin B12 on hyperhomocysteinemia, a putative vascular risk factor, are near completion&quot;.

===Revascularization===
After a trial of the best medical treatment outlined above, if symptoms persist, patients may be referred to a vascular or endovascular surgeon. The benefit of revascularization is thought to correspond to the severity of ischemia and the presence of other risk factors for limb loss, such as wound and infection severity.
* Angioplasty (or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty) can be done on solitary lesions in large arteries, such as the femoral artery, but may not have sustained benefits. Patency rates following angioplasty are highest for iliac arteries and decrease with arteries towards the toes. Other criteria that affect the outcome following revascularization are the length of the lesion and the number of lesions. There do not appear to be any long-term advantages or sustained benefits to placing a stent following angioplasty in order to hold the narrowing of the subsartorial artery open.
* Atherectomy, in which the plaque is scraped off the inside of the vessel wall (albeit with no better results than angioplasty).
* Vascular bypass grafting can be performed to circumvent a diseased area of the arterial vasculature. The great saphenous vein is used as a conduit if available, although artificial (Gore-Tex or PTFE) material is often used for long grafts when adequate venous conduit is unavailable.
* When gangrene has set in, amputation may be required to prevent infected tissues from causing sepsis, a life-threatening illness.
* Thrombolysis and thrombectomy are used in cases of arterial thrombosis or embolism.
* shockwave intravascular lithotripsy, a minimally invasive method that uses ultrasound waves to break up plaque within the artery without the need for penetration. The method was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in February 2021, and has been used as a complement to more widely-used methods of atherectomy.

===Guidelines===
A guideline from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association for the diagnosis and treatment of lower extremity, renal, mesenteric, and abdominal aortic PAD was compiled in 2013, combining the 2005 and 2011 guidelines. For chronic limb-threatening ischemia, the ACCF/AHA guidelines recommend balloon angioplasty only for people with a life expectancy of 2 years or less or those who do not have an autogenous vein available. For those with a life expectancy greater than 2 years or who have an autogenous vein, bypass surgery is recommended.

==Prognosis==
Individuals with PAD have an &quot;exceptionally elevated risk for cardiovascular events and the majority will eventually die of a cardiac or cerebrovascular etiology&quot;. Prognosis is correlated with the severity of the PAD as measured by an ABI. Large-vessel PAD increases mortality from cardiovascular disease significantly. PAD carries a greater than &quot;20% risk of a coronary event in 10 years&quot;.

The risk is low that an individual with claudication will develop severe ischemia and require amputation, but the risk of death from coronary events is three to four times higher than matched controls without claudication. Of patients with intermittent claudication, only &quot;7% will undergo lower-extremity bypass surgery, 4% major amputations, and 16% worsening claudication&quot;, but stroke and heart attack events are elevated, and the &quot;5-year mortality rate is estimated to be 30% (versus 10% in controls)&quot;.

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of PAD in the general population is 3–7%, affecting up to 20% of those over 70; 70%–80% of affected individuals are asymptomatic; only a minority ever require revascularization or amputation. Peripheral artery disease affects one in three diabetics over the age of 50. In the US, it affects 12–20 percent of Americans age 65 and older. Around 10 million Americans have PAD. Despite its prevalence and implications for cardiovascular risk, there are still low levels of awareness of risk factors and symptoms, with 26% of the population in the US reported to have knowledge of PAD.

In 2000, among people aged 40 years and older in the United States, rates of PAD were 4.3%. Rates were 14.5% for people aged 70 years or over. Within age groups, rates were generally higher for women than men. Non-Hispanic blacks had a rate of 7.9% compared to 4.4% in Non-Hispanic whites and 3.0% (1.4%–4.6%) in Mexican Americans.

The incidence of symptomatic PAD increases with age, from about 0.3% per year for men aged 40–55 years to about 1% per year for men aged over 75 years. The prevalence of PAD varies considerably depending on how PAD is defined and the age of the population being studied. People diagnosed with PAD have a greater risk of a MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Event) and stroke. Their risk of developing a reinfarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack within one year following a heart attack increases to 22.9%, compared to 11.4% for those without PAD.

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study trials in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, demonstrated that glycemic control is more strongly associated with microvascular disease than macrovascular disease. Pathologic changes occurring in small vessels may be more sensitive to chronically elevated glucose levels than atherosclerosis occurring in larger arteries.

==Research==
Research is being done on therapies to prevent the progression of PAD. In those who have developed critically poor blood flow to the legs, the benefit of autotransplantation of autologous mononuclear cells is unclear.

Only one randomized controlled trial has been conducted comparing vascular bypass to angioplasty for the treatment of severe PAD. The trial found no difference in amputation-free survival between vascular bypass and angioplasty at the planned clinical endpoint, but the trial has been criticized as being underpowered, limiting endovascular options, and comparing inappropriate endpoints. As of 2017, two randomized clinical trials are being conducted to better understand the optimal revascularization technique for severe PAD and critical limb ischemia (CLI), the BEST-CLI (Best Endovascular Versus Best Surgical Therapy for Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia) Trial and the BASIL-2 (Bypass Versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg – 2 )Trial.

In 2011, pCMV-vegf165 was registered in Russia as the first-in-class gene therapy drug for the treatment of PAD, including the advanced stage of critical limb ischemia.

<doc id="489174" wikidata="Q4862106" url="?curid=489174" title="Baron Annaly">
<text>Baron Annaly is a title that has been created three times, twice in the Peerage of Ireland and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Annaly is named after the ancient term for the general locale, which in turn was named after the original ancient king. The third creation is currently extant.

==History==
The first creation came in the Peerage of Ireland in 1766 when the lawyer and politician John Gore was made Baron Annaly, of Tenelick in the County of Longford. He had previously represented Jamestown and County Longford in the Irish House of Commons and served as Solicitor-General for Ireland from 1760 to 1764. Gore was the son of George Gore, younger son of Sir Arthur Gore, 1st Baronet, whose elder son Paul Gore was the grandfather of Arthur Gore, 1st Earl of Arran. George, like his son, was Attorney General and a High Court judge. Other members of the Gore family include the Gore baronets of Magharabeg, the Barons Harlech and the Earls Temple of Stowe (a title which has come into the family through marriage). On Lord Annaly&#x27;s death in 1784 the title became extinct.

The second creation came in the Peerage of Ireland in 1789 when Henry Gore was created Baron Annaly, of Tenelick, in the County of Longford. He was the younger brother of John Gore, 1st Baron Annaly of the 1766 creation. Gore had previously represented County Longford and Lanesborough in the Irish House of Commons. On his death in 1793 this title became extinct as well.

The third creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1863 when the Liberal politician Henry White was made Baron Annaly, of Annaly and Rathcline in the County of Longford. He had earlier represented County Dublin and County Longford in the House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of County Longford. White&#x27;s father Luke White had previously represented County Leitrim in Parliament as a Whig. The first Baron&#x27;s son, the second Baron, sat as a Liberal Member of Parliament for County Clare, County Longford and Kidderminster and served as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1862 to 1866 in the Liberal administrations of Lord Palmerston and Lord Russell. He was also Lord Lieutenant of County Longford.

, the title is held by his great-great-grandson, the sixth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1990. He served briefly as a government whip in 1994 in the Conservative government of John Major. However, Lord Annaly lost his seat in the House of Lords after the House of Lords Act of 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the upper chamber of Parliament.

The family seat was Luttrellstown Castle, near Clonsilla, Dublin in Republic of Ireland.

<doc id="489177" wikidata="Q357500" url="?curid=489177" title="Drop zone">
<text>A drop zone (DZ) is a place where parachutists or parachuted supplies land. It can be an area targeted for landing by paratroopers and airborne forces, or a base from which recreational parachutists and skydivers take off in aircraft and land under parachutes. In the latter case, it is often beside a small airport, frequently sharing the facility with other general aviation.

At recreational drop zones, an area is generally set side for parachute landings. Personnel at the site may include a drop zone operator or owner (DZO), manifestors (who maintain the flight manifest documents defining who flies and when), pilots, instructors or coaches, camera operators, parachute packers and riggers, and other general staff.

== History ==
The concept of a drop zone became relevant alongside the emerging relevance of parachuting, which had only begun taking place in the late eighteenth century. The first parachuting jump from an aircraft occurred in 1797 when Andre Jacques Garnerin descended above Paris landing in Parc Monceau, which then makes it the very first appointed drop zone. More specifically, the area where Garnerin landed is said to have been surrounded by a crowd, which means that the boundaries of the drop zone at Parc Monceau are marked by the surrounding crowd. After Garnerin’s jump, the idea of parachute jumping was abandoned due to the impractical nature of parachute design, until the idea became more popular with the increasing demands from entertainment-seeking public and the military. The beginning of World War I had made significant contribution to the development of parachuting due to the high demands from the military which influenced the increasing production and technological development of parachute design

Furthermore, the developments in aircraft design made the application of parachuting more feasible by improving the ease of personnel transportation allowing for the implementation of paratroopers – military parachutists. Paratroopers would conduct surprise attacks and seize military objectives, which meant that paratroopers were assigned or would choose drop zones that were less predictable and more extreme than what would usually be accepted by recreational parachutists. For example, during the Battle of Crete in 1941 the Germans deployed many paratroopers to seize Allied territory by establishing an airhead (a kind of drop zone which is used to receive allied reinforcements while defended in a threatened territory), which proved to the Allies the effectiveness of military parachuting. Post-World War II, parachuting continued to see development in military and recreational directions which led to the broadening of the definition of a drop zone now allowing for any place for skydiving to be called a drop zone (DZ)

== Military drop zone ==
In the military context a drop zone is any designated area where personnel and or equipment may be delivered by parachute or, in the case of certain items, by free drop. The specific parameters for DZ’s may vary between militaries. For example, NATO’s STANAG normative regulation for drop zone operation and engagement differs from the parameters set out by the United States Marine Corps.

STANAG, 1993 Drop Zone chapter considers a range of factors involved in appropriate drop engagement. Firstly, the airspeed of engagement over the drop zone is used to estimate the time to the landing at the drop zone. Drop altitude is another measurable variable which is calculated between the aircraft and the ground, taking into consideration the personnel, container delivery as well as the weight of the equipment delivered. The time between jumps is also considered which depends on the number of jumpers. Then, the methods of delivery are provided; there are usually three methods: low velocity to decrease airspeed most for sensitive equipment and personnel, high velocity for supplies and free drop. DZ obstacles include trees, water, powerlines or other conditions that may injure parachutists or damage equipment. Access to and size of DZ are calculated with regards to the obstacles and the number of jumpers; for example, one jumper the size of DZ should be at least 550m by 550m. Another important variable which determines the effectiveness of a DZ is the support team (DZST) servicing it. STANAG regulation suggests that there should be at least two trained members of personnel servicing a DZ. Primary missions of the DZST include wartime CDS drops to battalion or smaller size units, and peacetime visual meteorological conditions drops involving one to three aircraft for personnel, CDS, and heavy equipment. Another important function of DZST is to be familiar and mark the DZ appropriately for the incoming aircraft as well as being able to communicate the dangers or other conditions that surround the DZ (Jumpmaster Study Guide Supplemental Materials, 2020).

The technical element of DZ planning is well justified by the prevailing factors that cause injury during “combat jumping” up to this day. In 1945 airborne assault casualty rates from parachuting itself were around 6%, now persisting at around 3%. The factors causing the injuries are often related to communication with DZST and inappropriate injury assessments. Often the failure to communicate the cancelation of the mission, or no-go weather conditions are the reasons for chaotic and damaging combat jumps. On the other hand, the vast range of factors that constitute a safe drop zone is often unmet due to the extreme and unpredictable nature of military drop zones, which inevitably causes injuries. It was found that injury assessment during combat jumps is often overexaggerated and mission ineffective, making the importance of appropriate drop zone arrangement and support even more valid.

== Recreational drop zone ==
The earliest recreational parachuting jumps were made from balloons, and the first successful parachute descent was performed in 1797 over Paris. Free-falling jumps were not possible until 1908 Contests began in the US in 1926, and the first world championship was held in Yugoslavia in 1951. Competitors normally used aircraft to carry them to about 3600 m, and parachutes are usually opened at about 760 m. In skydiving parachutists compete in 4 world championship areas: free-fall individual style manoeuvres, combined with precision accuracy landing; 4 and 8-person group free-fall, with recreational jumping in groups of 2 to 100; open parachute formations and para-ski .

Skydiving in sport is practiced at a drop zone, a facility with authorization for parachute jumps. In some instances, first aid may be available at the DZ, but one study noted that injuries sustained only amounted to around 0.2% of all the skydives. Furthermore, the modern framework for skydiving drop zones is established in the official policy documents such as &quot;Parachute Descents Authorisation and Specification 2020&quot;, which defines DZs clearly in the civilian context.

In addition to regular jumps, many skydivers attend events called “boogies.” Boogies are special events hosted by one DZ to draw jumpers from surrounding DZs for jumping and partying. So, the purpose of a DZ is not only to facilitate recreational parachuting but also to bring people together in a community.

<doc id="489179" wikidata="Q983423" url="?curid=489179" title="Sean O'Keefe">
<text>Sean Charles O&#x27;Keefe (born January 27, 1956) is a university professor at Syracuse University Maxwell School, former chairman of Airbus Group, Inc., former Secretary of the Navy, former Administrator of NASA, and former chancellor of Louisiana State University (LSU). He is a former member of the board of directors of DuPont.

== Early life and education==
O&#x27;Keefe was born in Monterey, California, to Patricia (née Carlin; died 2010) and Patrick Gordon O&#x27;Keefe (born c. 1927), both natives of New Orleans. Patrick O&#x27;Keefe became a United States Navy engineer and over the years worked on nuclear submarines. The family lived on several naval bases during O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s childhood.

In 1973, he graduated from Wheeler High School in North Stonington, Connecticut. He attended Loyola University in New Orleans, graduating in 1977 with a Bachelor of Arts in History. He subsequently acquired his Master of Public Administration degree in 1978 from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.

==Career==
After receiving his master&#x27;s degree, he began his career as Presidential Management Intern and later was a budget analyst for the Department of Defense. He served on the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations staff for eight years, and was Staff Director of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.

===Comptroller, U.S. Department of Defense (1989–1992)===
In 1989, O&#x27;Keefe became Comptroller for the Department of Defense. Dubbed by some &quot;the Grim Reaper,&quot; he led efforts to cut defense programs the Pentagon&#x27;s senior leadership saw as unnecessary or wasteful. He was lauded for his handling of the financial aspects of the Gulf War, managing to collect large payments from U.S. allies which significantly offset the cost of the war.

===Secretary of the Navy (1992–1993)===
On July 7, 1992, President George H. W. Bush named him Acting Secretary of the Navy. He subsequently became permanent Secretary of the Navy and held that position until Bush left office on January 20, 1993. Although his time in office was less than seven months, it was eventful. Originally appointed to help clean up the &quot;Tailhook&quot; sexual harassment scandal, he also dealt with the draw down of Navy- and Marine Corps forces in the wake of the end of the Cold War, and he issued a new strategy policy statement for the sea services called &quot;...From the Sea&quot;.

After Bush left office, O&#x27;Keefe was Professor of Business Administration, Assistant to the Senior Vice President for Research and Dean of the Graduate School at Pennsylvania State University. He next became the Louis A. Bantle Professor of Business and Government Policy, an endowed chair at Syracuse University&#x27;s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.

===Deputy Director Office of Management and Budget (2001)===
From January to December 2001, O&#x27;Keefe served as deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in the George W. Bush administration, a job that strengthened his reputation as a &quot;bean counter&quot;.

===Administrator of NASA (2001–2004)===
O&#x27;Keefe became NASA administrator on December 21, 2001, after the United States Senate confirmed his nomination. He came to NASA without formal training in science or engineering (as was the case with James E. Webb who was NASA administrator from 1961 to 1968). O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s tenure at NASA can be divided into roughly three equal periods, each marked by a single problem or event of overriding importance. In the period December 2001 through January 2003, O&#x27;Keefe eliminated a $5 billion cost overrun in the construction of the International Space Station. In 2003, he dealt with the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; accident and its aftermath. From January 2004 through February 2005, O&#x27;Keefe re-organized NASA to start working on President George W. Bush&#x27;s newly announced Vision for Space Exploration to send humans to the Moon and Mars.

One of O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s most controversial decisions occurred in January 2004, when he cancelled an upcoming Space Shuttle mission to service the aging Hubble Space Telescope. O&#x27;Keefe claimed that, in light of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; accident, the mission would be too risky, since any potential shuttle damage while visiting the Hubble, would mean insufficient fuel to dock with the space station as a &quot;safe haven&quot;. While members of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) supported this decision numerous astronomers felt that the Hubble telescope was valuable enough to merit the risk. This resulted in strained relations between astronomers and the astronaut community.

In the buildup to the 2004 presidential election, a dispute in the press occurred between O&#x27;Keefe and NASA climatologist James Hansen. In 2003, it was claimed, O&#x27;Keefe warned Hansen not to discuss humanity&#x27;s role in global warming. &quot;The administrator [Mr. O&#x27;Keefe] interrupted me,&quot; Dr. Hansen said in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;he told me that I should not talk about dangerous anthropogenic interference, because we do not know enough or have enough evidence for what would constitute dangerous anthropogenic interference.&quot; O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s spokesperson said O&#x27;Keefe had not meant to admonish Hansen or suggest that research efforts should be cut. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Dr. Franco Einaudi, director of the NASA Earth Sciences Directorate at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and Dr. Hansen&#x27;s supervisor, said he was at the meeting between Dr. Hansen and Mr. O&#x27;Keefe. Dr. Einaudi confirmed that Mr. O&#x27;Keefe had interrupted the presentation to say that these were &quot;delicate issues&quot; and there was a lot of uncertainty about them. But, he added: &quot;Whether it is obvious to take that as an order or not is a question of judgment. Personally, I did not take it as an order.&quot;

O&#x27;Keefe responded to President Bush&#x27;s &#x27;Vision for Exploration&#x27; by hiring retired Navy Admiral Craig E. Steidle who had previously led development of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) as an associate administrator in charge of NASA&#x27;s new Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD). He developed a mission architecture for lunar exploration based on four launches of medium-lift vehicles and four space rendezvous per mission, which was immediately scrapped by Michael Griffin upon his arrival at NASA. NASA started over with the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS), sixteen months after Bush&#x27;s Vision for Space Exploration announcement. This led to the Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles (later cancelled) and the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle.

O&#x27;Keefe announced his resignation from NASA on December 13, 2004.

Asteroid 78905 Seanokeefe was named in honor of O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s role as NASA administrator.

===Chancellor of Louisiana State University (2005–2008)===
O&#x27;Keefe succeeded Mark Emmert on February 21, 2005. O&#x27;Keefe has been credited for establishing the Louisiana State University endowment through the $798 million &quot;Forever LSU Campaign&quot;, his second campaign as LSU&#x27;s chancellor. He became popular among students for interacting with them, especially during periodic &#x27;Chats with the Chancellor&#x27; across the campus throughout the semesters, and because of his encouraging emails. O&#x27;Keefe led LSU during its response to Hurricane Katrina in August and September 2005 when the campus was transformed into what has been called &quot;the largest acute-care field hospital established in a contingency in the nation&#x27;s history.&quot; On January 16, 2008, he announced that February 1, 2008 was his last day as chancellor.

O&#x27;Keefe lightly discussed his membership in the exclusive San Francisco Bohemian Club that has a 15- to 20-year waiting list, with the Louisiana State University student newspaper &quot;The Daily Reveille&quot;. During July 2005, O&#x27;Keefe had traveled to visit the famous Bohemian Grove near San Francisco as a member of the &#x27;Wayside Log camp&#x27;. The prior time in 1993 he was the guest of a member, one whom he later appointed to a NASA panel.

===EADS North America / Airbus Group North American Unit (2009–2014)===
In October 2009, EADS North America hired O&#x27;Keefe as CEO. His Washington connections were noted at a time when EADS was trying to secure a $35 billion U.S. Air Force contract for tanker aircraft in a competition with Boeing. O&#x27;Keefe brought aboard Paul Pastorek, the Louisiana state school superintendent from 2007 to 2011, as the EADS chief counsel and corporate secretary. O&#x27;Keefe and his teenaged son were among four survivors of an August 2010 seaplane crash near Aleknagik, Alaska; O&#x27;Keefe sustained serious injuries, while former US Senator Ted Stevens and four others were killed. In January 2011, O&#x27;Keefe assumed the additional responsibilities of chairman of the board of EADS, which was renamed Airbus Group&#x27;s North American Unit. In March 2014, O&#x27;Keefe stepped down as Chief Executive to address lingering medical issues from his 2010 airplane crash injuries.

===Syracuse University (2014–present)===
In November 2014 the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) announced that O&#x27;Keefe had joined CSIS as a Distinguished Senior Adviser. Simultaneously Syracuse University announced that O&#x27;Keefe had been appointed as a University Professor. O&#x27;Keefe has long been affiliated with Syracuse University since his graduation. From 1996 to 2001, O&#x27;Keefe was the Maxwell School&#x27;s Louis A. Bantle Professor of Business and Government Policy. He received Syracuse University Chancellor&#x27;s Award for Public Service for faculties in 1999 and the distinguished alumni Arents Award for Excellence in Public Service in 2011.

In 2020, O&#x27;Keefe, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and &quot;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.&quot; In 2024, O&#x27;Keefe again endorsed Biden but later shifted his support to Kamala Harris after Biden withdrew from the race.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Keefe and his wife, Laura, have three children. O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s great-grandfather was Arthur J. O&#x27;Keefe Sr., who from 1926 to 1929 was the mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana. His grandfather, Arthur O&#x27;Keefe Jr., was a member of the Louisiana State Senate from New Orleans from 1948 to 1950. His uncle is the former State Senate President, Michael H. O&#x27;Keefe. On August 9, 2010, O&#x27;Keefe survived the 2010 Alaska DHC-3 Otter crash which killed former Alaska senator Ted Stevens.

<doc id="489191" wikidata="Q1252297" url="?curid=489191" title="Douglas F4D Skyray">
<text>The Douglas F4D Skyray (later redesignated F-6 Skyray) is an American carrier-based supersonic fighter/interceptor designed and produced by the Douglas Aircraft Company. It was the first naval fighter to exceed the speed of sound in level flight and the last fighter produced by the Douglas Aircraft Company prior to its merger with McDonnell Aircraft to become McDonnell Douglas.

Development of the Skyray was started by Douglas during the late 1940s as the &quot;D-571-1&quot; design study. It was a delta wing interceptor capable of a high rate of climb as to permit the rapid interception of approaching hostile bombers. Douglas&#x27; proposal was selected by Navy officials to fulfil a formal requirement issued in 1948. The decision to adopt the Westinghouse J40 turbojet engine to power it would lead to considerable difficulties later on as this engine would be cancelled prior to entering production. Aerodynamic issues would also lead to a protracted development cycle, considerable design changes being made even after the maiden flight of a production standard Skyray having taken place in June 1954. The Skyray was declared ready for fleet introduction in April 1956, permitting its entry to service with both the United States Navy (USN) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) shortly thereafter.

The Skyray had a relatively brief service life, during which it never participated in actual combat. Despite this, it was the first carrier-launched aircraft to hold the world&#x27;s absolute speed record, having attained a top speed of 752.943 mph, (1,211.744 km/h). It also set a new time-to-altitude record, flying from a standing start to in two minutes and 36 seconds, all while flying at a 70° pitch angle. The last Skyrays were withdrawn from service in February 1964, although a handful continued to be flown for experimental purposes by National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) up to the end of the decade. The F5D Skylancer was an advanced development of the F4D Skyray that ultimately did not enter service.

==Design and development==
The Skyray originated within a design study, the &quot;D-571-1&quot;, performed by Douglas and funded by the United States Navy (USN). It was a fast-climbing pure interceptor that used a delta wing configuration and powered by a pair of Westinghouse J34 turbojet engines, which were equipped with afterburners for bursts of additional acceleration. The D-571-1 had a relatively thick wing with no conventional fuselage save for a pod-like cockpit in a forward position. A total of four 20mm cannons extended forward of the leading edge of the wing; alternative armaments consisted of spin-stabilized rockets. The design study had harnessed the designs and research of the German aerodynamicist Alexander Lippisch, who moved to the United States following the end of World War II, and whose work had been examined by several of Douglas&#x27;s design team. In June 1947, the Navy issued a contract to Douglas to proceed with preliminary investigation and engineering works on the concept up to the mockup stage.

As the design was refined, it was decided to reduce the wing&#x27;s thickness substantially to increase its high speed capabilities. The twin J34 engine arrangement was also swapped out for a single Westinghouse J40 engine. Only a single hydraulic system was incorporated, thus measures to permit manual reversion in the event of hydraulic failure were also included. Rockets also became the primary armament, which were housed in pylon-mounted pods underneath the wing. A formal operational requirement was issued by the Navy in 1948, however, according to aviation author Tommy H. Thomason, that the contract would be awarded to Douglas from the onset was an apparently foregone conclusion. Specifics of this requirement included the ability to intercept and destroy an enemy aircraft at an altitude of 50,000 ft (15,240 m) within five minutes of the alarm being sounded. At the time, Navy planners were particularly concerned by the threat posed to its carrier battle groups by high altitude Soviet bomber aircraft; furthermore, as early jet aircraft were fuel hungry and had limited endurance, to maximise an interceptor aircraft time on station the Navy desired for such an aircraft to possess a relatively high rate of climb so that it could be launched and rapidly reach its operational altitude.
On account of the numerous design changes, the mockup review was delayed by almost one year, taking place in March 1949. One criticism produced at this stage was that the nose-up attitude was greater than had been anticipated, necessitating changes to the aircraft&#x27;s nose and radome to improve the pilot&#x27;s external visibility. A more pressing issue would be the J40 engine intended to power the aircraft. Douglas&#x27; design team had decided to make accommodations to facilitate the use of other engines as a contingency measure; this approach proved to be quite fortunate as the J40 had a particularly troubled development, being eventually cancelled with no production units ever being delivered. As a temporary measure, the prototype had to be outfitted with an Allison J35 engine instead.

The long-term replacement for the J40 on production aircraft was the Pratt &amp; Whitney J57, a more powerful but considerably larger engine. As the original inlet design was not a good match for the J57, it had to be redesigned. The ensuing delays to the programme led to several other aircraft, such as the North American F-100 Super Sabre and the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19, beating it into operational service.

During June 1954, the first flight of a production standard Skyray occurred, after which an intense period of flight testing and remedial design work followed. The aft section needed to be reprofiled to eliminate undesirable buffeting as well as to reduce drag. In September 1955, initial carrier suitability trials were performed onboard USS &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;. No production aircraft were delivered until early 1956, it was declared ready for fleet introduction in April of that year. A total of 419 &quot;F4D-1&quot; (later designated &quot;F-6&quot; under the unified designation system) aircraft would be produced prior to the end of production in 1958.

The Skyray was a wide delta wing design with long, sharply swept, rounded wings. It was named for its resemblance to the manta ray. The thick wing roots contained the air intakes that fed its single turbojet engine. Fuel was contained both in the wings and the deep fuselage. Leading edge slats were fitted for increased lift during takeoff and landing while the trailing edges comprised mostly elevon control surfaces. Additional pitch trimmers were fitted inboard near the jet exhaust, and were locked upwards on takeoff and landing. It had a relatively unique design for the era, which was a key factor in the Skyray becoming one of the best-known early jet fighters. It was affectionately known as the &quot;Ford&quot; (after the &quot;Four&quot; and &quot;D&quot; of its designation). During 1953, Edward H. Heinemann was awarded the Collier Trophy in recognition of his design work on the F4D.

==Operational history==

During April 1956, VC-3 became the first squadron to attain operational status with the F4D-1. This unit was later redesignated VFAW-3 and assigned to NORAD, becoming the only United States Navy fighter squadron in what was predominantly a United States Air Force (USAF) and Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) organization. VFAW-3 was permanently based at NAS North Island in San Diego.

The United States Marine Corps (USMC) also operated the Skyray. When the Department of Defense adopted a uniform aircraft designation system patterned on the USAF&#x27;s aircraft designation system during September 1962, the F4D was redesignated as the &quot;F-6A Skyray&quot;. The &quot;F4D&quot; (old designation) should not be confused with the &quot;F-4D&quot; (new designation) – the latter being the &quot;D&quot; variant of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II operated by the USAF.

The Skyray was designed exclusively for the high-altitude interception role, with a high rate and angle of climb. It set a new time-to-altitude record, flying from a standing start to in two minutes and 36 seconds, all while flying at a 70° pitch angle. As a dedicated interceptor, the F4D was unsuited to the multi-mission capabilities that became increasingly in demand, thus the type had a relatively short career in both USN and USMC service. In addition to multiple Navy and Marine Corps squadrons, Naval Air Reserve and Marine Air Reserve squadrons VF-881, VF-882 and VMF-215 also flew the Skyray. The last operational squadron was VMF(AW)-115, which flew the Skyray until February 1964. A total of four aircraft were used for experimental purposes by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) (which was later renamed NASA) until 1969.

===F5D Skylancer===

The F5D Skylancer was derived from the F4D and intended to be a Mach 2 capable successor to the Skyray. Although four prototypes were built and flown, the project was cancelled as being too similar in mission parameters to the F8U Crusader and also to reduce dependence upon Douglas Aircraft, which was also producing several other aircraft for the U.S. Navy. This decision effectively removed Douglas from active fighter development.

<text>Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) is an API for Microsoft Windows which allows programs to become email-aware. While MAPI is designed to be independent of the protocol, it is usually used to communicate with Microsoft Exchange Server.

== Details ==
MAPI uses functions loosely based on the X.400 XAPIA standard. It includes facilities to access message transports, message stores, and directories.

While &quot;Simple MAPI&quot; (SMAPI) is a subset of 12 functions which enable developers to add basic messaging functionality, &quot;Extended MAPI&quot; (EMAPI) allows complete control over the messaging system on the client computer. This includes creation and management of messages, plus management of the client mailbox, and service providers. 

Simple MAPI is included with Microsoft Windows as part of Outlook Express/Windows Mail while the full Extended MAPI is included with Microsoft Outlook and Exchange.

In addition to the Extended MAPI client interface, programming calls can be made indirectly through the Simple MAPI API client interface, through the &quot;Common Messaging Calls&quot; (CMC) API client interface, or by the object-based &quot;CDO Library&quot; interface. These three methods are easier to use and designed for less complex messaging-enabled and -aware applications. (Simple MAPI and CMC were removed from Exchange 2003.)

MAPI was originally designed by Microsoft. The company founded its MS Mail team in 1987, but it was not until it acquired Consumers Software in 1991 to obtain &quot;Network Courier&quot; that it had a messaging product. Reworked, it was sold as MS PC Mail (or Microsoft Mail for PC Networking). The basic API to MS PC Mail was later known as MAPI version 0 (or &quot;MAPI0&quot;), to differentiate it from &quot;true&quot; MAPI.

== Service provider interface ==
The full Extended MAPI interface is required for interfacing messaging-based services to client applications such as Outlook. For example, several non-Microsoft e-mail server product vendors created &quot;MAPI service providers&quot; to allow their products to be accessed via Outlook. Notable examples include Axigen Mail Server, Kerio Connect, Scalix, Zimbra, HP OpenMail, IBM Lotus Notes, Zarafa/Kopano, and Bynari.

MAPI also had a service provider interface of sorts. Microsoft used this to interface MS Mail to an email system based on Xenix, for internal use.

Extended MAPI is the main e-mail data access method used by Outlook, to interface to Microsoft Exchange, via MAPI service providers shipped with Outlook.

== MAPI/RPC protocol details ==
Microsoft has released full details of the MAPI/RPC protocol since August 2007.

&quot;MAPI protocol&quot; is a colloquial name for the MAPI/RPC. At times, Microsoft has also called it &quot;Exchange RPC&quot; and &quot;Outlook-Exchange Transport Protocol&quot;.

Microsoft provides a sample MAPI/RPC-based application called MFCMAPI to assist developers. It is also widely used as a diagnostics tool by both developers and Microsoft Exchange administrators.

The original implementation was designed for use on a local network, or LAN.

With Exchange 2003 and Outlook 2010, Microsoft introduced RPC over HTTP (later renamed Outlook Anywhere) as a way to Exchange over the internet.

In 2014, Exchange 2013 SP1 introduced another variant, this time with a more &quot;normal&quot; HTTP-based stack known as &quot;MAPI over HTTP&quot;.

== Incompatibility with Internet Mail ==
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol has always supported the concept of mail with multiple authors, and distinguishes between the &quot;sender&quot; and &quot;authors&quot; whenever there is more than one of the latter. MAPI cannot represent separate authors and senders except through the delegation mechanism, which does not permit more than one author. Thus MAPI cannot accurately transmit group letters from scientific communities to legislators, or presentation of group research via email, or similar scenarios. When fully SMTP compliant mailers (e.g. Thunderbird) send perfectly formed SMTP messages with multiple authors into MAPI-dependent email infrastructures (such as Exchange/Outlook, O365, or Outlook.com) the messages must have their information density reduced to fit MAPI, presenting challenges for authentication and anti-spoofing technologies that rely on accurate message metadata transmission, and fundamentally changing messages to be something other than what was originally sent. Although the security implications impact all users, inability to represent multiple authorship is generally of little concern in purely hierarchical settings such as traditional businesses and military organizations, primarily impacting legislative and academic institutions.

== Reimplementations ==
Several open-source software projects have started working on implementing MAPI libraries, including:

* Grommunio/Gromox has C++20 implementations of MAPI/RPC and MAPI/HTTP servers.
* The OpenMapi project (now demised) had a C# implementation.
* Kopano Groupware Core has a C++2011 implementation called &quot;mapi4linux&quot; (continuation of the same from Zarafa), which offers an API that is source-backwards-compatible with the Messaging API (code written for M4L also build with the Windows SDK). Kopano GWC comes with a connector for the Zarafa/Kopano-based SOAP/HTTP transport.
* OpenChange has a &quot;libmapi&quot; component written in C that only partially resembles MAPI. (Lacks interfaces like IMsgStore, the OpenEntry function.)
* The OpenChange subproject Evolution-MAPI is a connector for Exchange implementing the MAPI/RPC transport.
* The GNOME Evolution project develops &quot;evolution-ews&quot;, which has implemented much of MAPI.

<text>Tatum Beatrice O&#x27;Neal (born November 5, 1963) is an American actress. At the age of 10, she became the youngest person ever to win a competitive Academy Award, for her performance as Addie Loggins in &quot;Paper Moon&quot; co-starring her father, Ryan O&#x27;Neal. She later starred in the films &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot;, &quot;Nickelodeon&quot;, and &quot;Little Darlings&quot;, and appeared in guest roles in the television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;, and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;.

== Family background ==
O&#x27;Neal was born in the Westwood area of Los Angeles, California, to actors Ryan O&#x27;Neal and Joanna Moore. Her brother, Griffin, was born in 1964. In 1967, her parents divorced and her father quickly married actress Leigh Taylor-Young, together having Tatum&#x27;s half-brother, Patrick. The two divorced in 1973. Tatum has another half-brother, Redmond, from Ryan O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s relationship with actress Farrah Fawcett. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s mother died of lung cancer at age 63, after a career in which she appeared in such movies as &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; and &quot;Follow That Dream&quot;. Her paternal ancestry is Irish, English, and Ashkenazi Jewish.

== Career ==

=== Young career ===

On April 2, 1974, at age ten, Tatum O&#x27;Neal won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress for her performance in &quot;Paper Moon,&quot; released in May 1973. The youngest ever to win a competitive Academy Award, she turned nine years old during filming in autumn 1972. O&#x27;Neal played the role of Addie Loggins, a child con artist being tutored by a Depression-era grifter played by her father. In her 2010 appearance on &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, O&#x27;Neal stated that her father had not attended the Academy Awards ceremony with her due to his busy schedule.

O&#x27;Neal starred in films such as &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; (1976) with Walter Matthau, &quot;International Velvet&quot; (1978) with Christopher Plummer and Anthony Hopkins, and &quot;Little Darlings&quot; (1980) with Kristy McNichol, and co-starred in &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; (1976) with her father and in &quot;Circle of Two&quot; (1980) with Richard Burton. 

She was cast in &quot;Split Image&quot; but had to be let go during filming because she was too young (seventeen) for night schools and was replaced by Karen Allen. She appeared as the title character in the &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; episode &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot; (1984).

=== Later career ===
O&#x27;Neal appeared in only five films during the next 15 years, one of them being &quot;Basquiat&quot; (1996) as Cynthia Kruger.

In the early 2000s, O&#x27;Neal returned to acting with guest appearances in &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot;, and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. In 2005, O&#x27;Neal began a recurring role as Maggie Gavin in the firehouse drama series &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, portraying the unbalanced and lively sister of Tommy Gavin, played by Denis Leary.

In January 2006, she participated in the second season of ABC&#x27;s reality series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with professional partner Nick Kosovich. They were eliminated in the second round. She went on to do commentary for the series on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;.

From 2006 to 2007, she portrayed the vindictive and psychotic Blythe Hunter in the MyNetworkTV drama &quot;Wicked Wicked Games&quot;. She appears opposite Nashawn Kearse and Vanessa Williams in the film &quot;My Brother&quot; (2007).

In 2008, she appeared in the Lifetime original film &quot;Fab Five: The Texas Cheerleader Scandal&quot;. The film is based on a true story which took place at McKinney North High School in Texas. She portrayed the mother of the main character, Brooke Tippit, and became close friends with the character&#x27;s actress, Ashley Benson, whom she mentored in acting.

In 2021, O&#x27;Neal appeared in the film Not to Forget, which aimed to raise awareness and funds for the fight against Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The movie, directed by Valerio Zanoli, stars Karen Grassle and five Academy Award winners: O&#x27;Neal, Cloris Leachman, Louis Gossett Jr., George Chakiris, and Olympia Dukakis.

== Personal life ==

=== Family and romantic relationships ===
One of O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s first reported relationships was with singer Michael Jackson in the late 1970s. In a 2002 interview with Martin Bashir, Jackson said that O&#x27;Neal tried to seduce him, but he was terrified by the idea of sex. O&#x27;Neal adamantly denied all of Jackson&#x27;s claims in her 2004 autobiography and stated that her relationship with Jackson was platonic.

O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s relationship with tennis player John McEnroe began in 1984 when she moved into his Central Park West apartment in New York City. They married in 1986. The couple have three children: Kevin, Sean and Emily. They separated in 1992 and were divorced in 1994. Following the divorce, O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s drug problems reemerged and she developed an addiction to heroin. As a result, McEnroe obtained custody of the children in 1998.

In 2011, Tatum and her father began to restore their relationship after 25 years. Their reunion and reconciliation process was captured in the short-lived Oprah Winfrey Network series &quot;Ryan and Tatum: The O&#x27;Neals&quot;. In 2015, she said she had begun dating women, while choosing not to identify herself as homosexual, bisexual or heterosexual, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not one or the other.&quot;

=== Arrest ===
On June 1, 2008, O&#x27;Neal was arrested for buying crack cocaine near her Manhattan apartment building. When police searched her, they allegedly found two bags of drugs—one of crack cocaine, one of powder cocaine—and an unused crack pipe. She was charged with a misdemeanor criminal possession of a controlled substance. Authorities released her without bail. On July 2, 2008, O&#x27;Neal pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in connection with the arrest and agreed to spend two half-day sessions in a drug treatment program.

=== Stroke ===
In May 2020, O’Neal suffered a massive stroke caused by a prescription drug overdose. She was discovered unconscious by a friend, and the stroke left her in a coma for a month and a half. When she reawakened, she could not remember how to speak. She has since struggled to relearn everything.

=== Autobiographies ===
In her 2004 autobiography, &quot;A Paper Life&quot;, O&#x27;Neal alleged that she was molested by her father&#x27;s drug dealer when she was 12. She also alleges physical and emotional abuse by her father, much of which she attributed to drug use. She also detailed her heroin addiction and its effects on her relationship with her children. Her father denied the allegations. In a prepared statement, Ryan O&#x27;Neal said: &quot;It is a sad day when malicious lies are told in order to become a &#x27;bestseller.

In 2011, O&#x27;Neal wrote a new collection of memoirs, &quot;Found: A Daughter&#x27;s Journey Home&quot;, which dealt with her tempestuous relationship with her father, volatile marriage to McEnroe, and recent drug arrest.

<doc id="489220" wikidata="Q844024" url="?curid=489220" title="Artibonite (department)">
<text>Artibonite (; ) is one of the ten departments of Haiti located in central Haiti. With an area of 4,887 km2 it is Haiti&#x27;s largest department. As of 2015, its estimated population was 1,727,524. The region is the country&#x27;s main rice-growing area. The main cities are Gonaïves (the capital) and Saint-Marc. In February 2004 an insurgency tried unsuccessfully to declare Artibonite&#x27;s independence.

== Etymology ==
The name L&#x27;Artibonite is derived from the Artibonite River, the longest river on Hispaniola. L&#x27;Artibonite is derived from the Taino &quot;ja&#x27;tibonicu&quot; meaning &quot;Great High Place of the Sacred Waters.&quot; Under Toussaint&#x27;s administration of the island, the department was known as Toussaint&#x27;s Department.

== History ==
===Taino Period===
During that period the actual department seats between the three casicas of Marien, Maguana, and Xaragua. The border between those chiefdoms is assumed to be the Artibonite River. Although the department&#x27;s capital Gonayibo is believed to have been part of the Xaragua chiefdom. 
Haitian traditional stories talk about the Taino Queen leaving annually followed by her nitaino her main city of Yaguana to go to Gonayibo and thus is the origin of Haitian Rara traditions.

Some Taino settlements in the departments are Gonaibo, Amani-y, the caves of Dondon and archeological places have been found in the Cote-des-Arcadins area.

===French Period===
Under the French administration the towns of St-Marc, L&#x27;Éstère. Mirebalais and Petite-Rivières-de-l&#x27;Artibonite were important French settlements with multiple plantations in the Valley.
During that period the town of St-Marc was under the control of the colonialists and was the seat of Assemblée Colonial or the Colonial Assembly.

===Haitian Revolution===
At the beginning of the Revolution, St-Marc was burned by Dessalines and Gonaives by Vernet under the order of Toussaint in response to Napoléon&#x27;s tyrannic behaviors.
Later on, Toussaint defeated the French troops at the Bataille-de-la-Ravine-à-Couleuvre near the town of Gonaives. 
In Gonaives the French captured Toussaint and he was later sent to France and died.

In April 1802 during the siege of Crête-à-Pierrot that lasted almost one month, the indigenous troops offer the French generals the greatest resistance. During that battle, Dessalines threatened to set fire to the gunpowder reserve in case the French would enter the fort. The Haitian hero Marie-Jeanne Lamartinière surprised the French troops with her courageous behavior.

===Haitian Period===
Gabart commander of St-Marc, Vernet commander of Gonaives, and Dessalines commander of the Indigenous Army are signatories of the Haitian Declaration of Independence.
Gonayiv is the first city to be gained from the French troops by the Indigenous Army, and Gabart freed St-Marc on September 4, 1803.

On January 1, 1804, the city of Gonaives hold the first Haitian political conference and witness the Declaration of Independence under the eyes of Dessalines, Henry, Pétion, Geffrard, Boirond Tonnerre, some British troops and many more.
The town of Dessalines became the world&#x27;s first black capital and the seat of the Haitian Empire.
Many times, the department has dissociated itself from Port-au-Prince and the West many times notably under the leadership of Henry Christophe, Nissage Saget, receiving Fabre Geffrard against Faustin.
In the contemporary period, Gonaives rose furiously in 1986 and 2004 overthrowing both Duvalier and Aristide.

The Bay of Gonaives is one of the best-protected bays in the country.
The Bay of St-Marc is the biggest U-shaped bay in the country.
The department doesn&#x27;t have any major fault line through it.

== Environment ==
One of Haiti&#x27;s biggest mangrove forests, harboring flamingos and other rare species, is located south of Gonaives. There are also sand dunes in that area.
There are many lagoons and rivers that run through the Valley. The largest lake in Artibonite is Bois-Neuf Lake south of St-Marc.

== Economy ==
The department has been in a state of economic decline since insurgencies and coups have reduced the nation&#x27;s stability. Since the election of President René Garcia Préval, the production of rice and other crops has been increasing.
The biggest economical catastrophe in the department is the Clinton induce low-tariffs on rice coming from the US, destroying the local economy.

Nonetheless, the economic potentials are multiple and over multiple industries.

<text>The vanishing hitchhiker (or variations such as the ghostly hitchhiker, disappearing hitchhiker, phantom hitchhiker) is an urban legend in which people travelling by vehicle, meet with or are accompanied by a hitchhiker who subsequently vanishes without explanation, often from a moving vehicle.

Public knowledge of the story expanded greatly with the 1981 publication of Jan Harold Brunvand&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker&quot;. In his book, Brunvand suggests that the story of &quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker&quot; can be traced as far back as the 1870s.&quot; Similar stories have been reported for centuries across the world in places like England, Ethiopia, Korea, France, South Africa, Tsarist Russia and in America among Chinese Americans, Mormons and Ozark mountaineers. 

What was probably the first vanishing hitchhiker legend can be found in the 400-year-old manuscript &quot;Om the tekn och widunder som föregingo thet liturgiske owäsendet&quot;, which translates approximately as &quot;About the signs and wonders that preceded the liturgical event&quot;. The author was Joen Petri Klint, a priest in diocese of Linköping, Sweden, and diligent collector of omens.

==Variations==
A common variation of the above involves the vanishing hitchhiker departing as would a normal passenger, having left some item in the vehicle, or having borrowed a garment for protection against the cold. The vanishing hitchhiker may also leave some form of information that encourages the motorist to make subsequent contact.

In such accounts of the legend, the garment borrowed is often found draped over a gravestone in a local cemetery. In this and other versions of the urban legend, the unsuspecting motorist makes contact with the family of a deceased person using the information the hitchhiker left behind and finds that the family&#x27;s description of the deceased matches the passenger the motorist picked up and also finds that they were killed in some unexpected way (usually a car accident) and that the driver&#x27;s encounter with the vanishing hitchhiker occurred on the anniversary of their death.

Other variations reverse this scenario, in that the hitchhiker meets a driver; the hitchhiker later learns that the driver is actually an apparition of a person who died earlier. The song &quot;Phantom 309&quot; is an example.

Not all vanishing hitchhiker legends involve ghosts. One popular variant in Hawaii involves the goddess Pele, travelling the roads incognito and rewarding kind travellers; other variants include hitchhikers who utter prophecies (typically of pending catastrophes or other evil events) before vanishing.

There is a similar story which is about two travellers sitting next to each other on a train (normally a man and a woman). One of them is reading a book and the other person asks what the book is about, and the first person says that it&#x27;s about ghosts. They then have a conversation about ghosts, and the second person asks the first if the latter believes in ghosts or has ever seen one, to which the first person claims never to have seen or believed in ghosts at all. The second person replies that this is doubtful, and vanishes. This was the version used in the &quot;Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark&quot; book series.

==Classifications==

===Beardsley and Hankey===
The first proper study of the story of the vanishing hitchhiker was undertaken in 1942–43 by American folklorists Richard Beardsley and Rosalie Hankey, who collected as many accounts as they could and attempted to analyze them.

The Beardsley-Hankey survey elicited 79 written accounts of encounters with vanishing hitchhikers, drawn from across the United States. They found: &quot;Four distinctly different versions, distinguishable because of obvious differences in development and essence.&quot; These are described as:
* A. Stories where the hitchhiker gives an address through which the motorist learns he has just given a lift to a ghost.
** 49 of the Beardsley-Hankey samples fell into this category, with responses from 16 states of the United States.
* B. Stories where the hitchhiker is an old woman who prophesies disaster or the end of World War II; subsequent inquiries likewise reveal her to be deceased.
** Nine of the samples fit this description, and eight of these came from the vicinity of Chicago. Beardsley and Hankey felt that this indicated a local origin, which they dated to approximately 1933: two of the version B hitchhikers in this sample foretold disaster at the Century of Progress Exposition and another foresaw calamity &quot;at the World&#x27;s Fair&quot;. The strict topicality of these unsuccessful forecasts did not appear to thwart the appearance of further Version &#x27;B&#x27; hitch-hikers, one of whom warned that Northerly Island, in Lake Michigan, would soon be submerged (this has not yet occurred).
* C. Stories where a girl is met at some place of entertainment, &quot;e.g.&quot;, dance, instead of on the road; she leaves some token (often the overcoat she borrowed from the motorist) on her grave by way of corroborating the experience and her identity.
** The uniformity amongst separate accounts of this variant led Beardsley and Hankey to strongly doubt its folkloric authenticity.
* D. Stories where the hitchhiker is later identified as a local divinity.

Beardsley and Hankey were particularly interested to note one instance (location: Kingston, New York, 1941) in which the vanishing hitchhiker was subsequently identified as the late Mother Cabrini, founder of the local Sacred Heart Orphanage, who was beatified for her work. The authors felt that this was a case of Version &#x27;B&#x27; glimpsed in transition to Version &#x27;D&#x27;.

Beardsley and Hankey concluded that Version &#x27;A&#x27; was closest to the original form of the story, containing the essential elements of the legend. Version &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;D&#x27;, they believed, were localized variations, while &#x27;C&#x27; was supposed to have started life as a separate ghost story which at some stage became conflated with the original vanishing hitchhiker story (Version &#x27;A&#x27;).

One of their conclusions certainly seems reflected in the continuation of vanishing hitchhiker stories: The hitchhiker is, in the majority of cases, female and the lift-giver male. Beardsley and Hankey&#x27;s sample contained 47 young female apparitions, 14 old lady apparitions, and 14 more of an indeterminate sort.

===Baughman===
Ernest W. Baughman&#x27;s &quot;Type- and Motif-Index of the Folk Tales of England and North America&quot; (1966) delineates the basic vanishing hitchhiker as follows:

Ghost of young woman asks for ride in automobile, disappears from closed car without the driver&#x27;s knowledge, after giving him an address to which she wishes to be taken. The driver asks person at the address about the rider, finds she has been dead for some time. (Often the driver finds that the ghost has made similar attempts to return, usually on the anniversary of death in automobile accident. Often, too, the ghost leaves some item such as a scarf or traveling bag in the car.)

Baughman&#x27;s classification system grades this basic story as motif E332.3.3.1.

Subcategories include:
* E332.3.3.1(a) for vanishing hitchhikers who reappear on anniversaries;
* E332.3.3.1(b) for vanishing hitchhikers who leave items in vehicles, unless the item is in a pool of water in which case it is E332.3.3.1(c);
* E332.3.3.1(d) is for accounts of sinister old ladies who prophesy disasters;
* E332.3.3.1(e) contains accounts of phantoms who are apparently sufficiently solid to engage in activities such as eating or drinking during their journey;
* E332.3.3.1(f) is for phantom parents who want to be taken to the sickbed of their dying son;
* E332.3.3.1(g) is for hitchhikers simply requesting a lift home;
* E332.3.3.1(h-j) are a category reserved exclusively for vanishing nuns (a surprisingly common variant), some of whom foretell the future.

Here, the phenomenon blends into religious encounters, with the next and last vanishing hitchhiker classification  – E332.3.3.2 – being for encounters with divinities who take to the road as hitchhikers. The legend of Saint Christopher is considered one of these, and the story of Philip the Evangelist being transported by God after encountering the Ethiopian on the road (Acts 8:26–39) is sometimes similarly interpreted.

== The first vanishing hitchhiker legend ==
The author was Joen Petri Klint, a priest in diocese of Linköping, Sweden, and diligent collector of omens.

In February 1602 a priest and two farmers were on their way home from the Candelmass market in Västergötland. A maid asked to go along. At an inn they got off to get a bite to eat, and the maid wanted something to drink, a jug of beer (a common beverage). The first time the innkeeper fetched beer, the jug was filled with malt, second time acorns, and finally blood. They were then horrified. The maid explained that this year will yield much grain; plenty of fruit on the trees; but war and pestilence. Then she disappeared into thin air.

The incident contains all the hallmarks of a &quot;vanishing hitchhiker&quot;. It fits well with Beardsley&#x27;s and Hankey&#x27;s B and C categories (when the hitchhiker disappeared after making a prediction). The beer&#x27;s transformations match Baughman&#x27;s category E332.3.3.1(b), when the maid left behind seed, acorns and blood, and category E332.3.3.1(d) when she predicted the future (however, Klint does not mention whether the prophecy was correct), as well as category E332.3.3.1(e) because she wanted something to drink, and E332.3.3.1(g) because she was on her way home.

==Skeptical reception==
Paranormal researcher Michael Goss in his book &quot;The Evidence for Phantom Hitch-Hikers&quot; discovered that many reports of vanishing hitchhikers turn out be based on folklore and hearsay stories. Goss also examined some cases and attributed them to hallucination of the experiencer. According to Goss most of the stories are &quot;fabricated, folklore creations retold in new settings.&quot;

Skeptic Joe Nickell, who investigated two alleged cases, concluded that there is no reliable evidence for vanishing hitchhikers. Historical examples have their origin in folklore tales and urban legends. Modern cases often involve conflicting accounts that may well be the result of exaggeration, illusion or hoaxing.

<text>The Oregon Zoo, originally the Portland Zoo and later the Washington Park Zoo, is a zoo located in Washington Park, Portland, Oregon, approximately southwest of downtown Portland. Founded in 1888, it is the oldest zoo west of the Mississippi River.

The zoo is owned by the regional Metro government. It currently holds more than 1,800 animals of more than 230 species, including 19 endangered species and 9 threatened species. The zoo also boasts an extensive plant collection throughout its animal exhibits and specialized gardens. The zoo also operates and maintains the narrow-gauge Washington Park &amp; Zoo Railway that previously connected to the International Rose Test Garden inside the park, but currently runs only within the zoo.

The Oregon Zoo is Oregon&#x27;s largest paid and arguably most popular visitor attraction, with more than 1.7 million visitors in 2018. The zoo is a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

==History==

=== Founding ===

The Oregon Zoo was founded in 1888, making it the oldest North American zoo west of the Mississippi. It all began with two bears purchased by Richard Knight – one brown bear and one grizzly. A former seaman turned pharmacist, Knight began collecting animals from his seafaring friends. He kept his collection in the back of his drug store on Third &amp; Morrison streets. When caring for the animals became too large a responsibility he sought to sell them to the city of Portland. Instead of buying the animals, the city offered to give Knight two circus cages and allowed him to place the caged bears on the grounds of City Park (now called Washington Park).

Care and feeding of the bears, however, still fell to the Knight family and friends. It was not long before Knight addressed the city council again regarding the bears. Just five months later, he offered to donate the bears, along with their cages, to the city. Portland City Council accepted his offer on November 7, 1888, and thus began the Portland Zoo. Located in Washington Park, it was sometimes referred to as the Washington Park Zoo.

By 1894, there were over 300 animals in the zoo’s collection. In 1925, the zoo moved to the site of the present Portland Japanese Garden, still within Washington Park.

=== Hoyt Park ===
The zoo moved again in 1958–59 to its current site, designed by Lawrence, Tucker &amp; Wallmann. This was located in Hoyt Park, west of Washington Park, but some years later the two parks were combined as Washington Park. At this time, the Portland Zoo Railway was constructed to connect the zoo to its former site in Washington Park and other attractions there. The zoo&#x27;s move to the new, much larger site was made in stages, over more than a year, with the first animals being moved in spring 1958 and limited public access being opened in June 1958, one day after the first section of the Zoo Railway opened. During the transition period the new zoo was only open on weekends, as most animals were still at the old site awaiting completion of their new enclosures. However, the new railway operated six days a week until mid-September. Meanwhile, the old zoo remained in operation, but in May 1959 was restricted to pedestrian access only, closed to automobile access, for its last months of operation.

=== Washington Park ===

The zoo at its current site opened on July 3, 1959. It was renamed the Portland Zoological Gardens at that time, but remained commonly known as the Portland Zoo. The elephants and big cats were not moved to the new zoo until November. A new interchange was constructed on the adjacent freeway, the Sunset Highway, for better access to the new zoo.

=== Elephants ===
The zoo rose it popularity locally in 1953, when Rosy the Asian elephant was acquired. The zoo became world-famous in 1962 when the Asian elephant &quot;Packy&quot; was born. He was the first elephant born in the Western Hemisphere in 44 years and was (as of 2010) the tallest Asian elephant in the United States at 10.5 ft (3.2 m) tall. A total of 28 more calves have been born at the Oregon Zoo, including seven sired by Packy (two of which, Shine and Rama, remained at the zoo), making it the most successful zoo elephant breeding program in the world. On August 23, 2008, Rose-Tu, the granddaughter of the zoo&#x27;s first elephant Rosy, gave birth to a son named Samudra. The birth made Samudra the first third-generation captive-born elephant in North America.

Attendance in 1962, the year Packy was born, was 1.2 million people. Over the next several years, the number of animals declined, from 450 (representing 150 species) in 1962 to 386 (representing 123 species) in 1976, and annual attendance also declining over the same period, reaching its lowest point in 1975, with 448,198 visitors.

On February 9, 2017, Oregon Zoo staff decided to euthanize Packy after a long struggle with drug-resistant tuberculosis. He was laid to rest at an unidentified city-owned &quot;wooded, grassy area&quot; that is not open to the public. At the time of his death, Packy was 54 years old.

=== Metropolitan Service District ===

Until 1971, the zoo was operated by the City, and then by the Portland Zoological Society under contract to the City. In 1976, area voters approved a tax levy plan under which the zoo was taken over by the Metropolitan Service District (or MSD, now known as Metro). Ownership of the zoo passed to Metro on July 1, 1976. Metro has continued expansion projects, aided by donors, sponsors and volunteers.

Later in 1976, MSD renamed the zoo the Washington Park Zoo after a naming contest. The railway was renamed the Washington Park and Zoo Railway two years later. The decline in attendance seen in the 1960s and 1970s eventually began to reverse, and the zoo recorded 752,632 visitors in 1984 and 897,189 in 1986.

=== Oregon Zoo ===

The Metro Council changed the zoo&#x27;s name from the Washington Park Zoo to the Oregon Zoo in April 1998. In September of that year, the zoo became accessible by the region&#x27;s MAX light rail system, with the opening of a Westside MAX line featuring an underground Washington Park station. In 2003, the zoo began participation in a California condor recovery program started by San Diego Wild Animal Park and Los Angeles Zoo. The program is designed to breed California condors to be released into the wild and save them from extinction.

In November 2008, regional voters approved a $125 million bond measure to improve infrastructure, enhance older exhibits and increase access to conservation education and the degree of sustainability. Attendance at the zoo reached a record 1.6 million visitors for their 2008 to 2009 year. The record was due in part to the birth of another baby elephant. A new record was set the following year with 1,612,359 people visiting the zoo. The zoo again brought in more than 1.7 million visitors in 2018.

==Exhibits==

=== Africa Rainforest ===
Opened in 1991, the Africa Rainforest exhibit covers and was built at a cost of $4.3 million. In addition to animals, the exhibit includes artwork and the Congo Ranger Station, a mock up of a safari expedition. Animals in the exhibit include Rodrigues fruit bats, straw-colored fruit bats, spotted-necked otters, West African slender-snouted crocodiles and crested porcupines. The rainforest includes three main areas: the Bamba Du Jon Swamp, which houses West African lungfish, African bullfrogs and reptiles; the rainforest aviary, which houses lesser flamingos, hadada ibises and white-faced whistling ducks and the main rainforest area.

===Africa Savanna===

The Africa Savanna exhibit first opened in April 1989 and is in size. This exhibit includes animals typical of East Africa and includes an aviary and areas for large mammals. These include eastern black rhinos, bontebok, Speke&#x27;s gazelle, naked mole-rats, red-tailed monkeys, Masai and reticulated giraffe, and African spurred tortoises. The zoo kept a plains zebra named Citation until her death in 2013. The zoo had also kept a pair of hippos named Poppy &amp; Bubbles until March 2018, when they were moved to the Fort Worth Zoo so the zoo could expand their rhinoceros habitat.

Predators of the Serengeti, a $6.8 million exhibit which opened in September 2009, expanded the Africa Savanna into the site of the former Alaska Tundra exhibit which used to house: Muskoxen and Grizzly Bears. Animals in the exhibit include African predators like lions, cheetahs and African wild dogs, along with other animals nearby such as common dwarf mongooses, ring-tailed lemurs, northern red-billed hornbills and a Central African rock python. The zoo previously had lions, but closed the exhibit in 1998 to build Steller Cove. The three new lions come from zoos in California, Virginia and Wisconsin. On September 4, 2013, it was announced that five-year-old Neka, one of the zoo&#x27;s two female lions, was pregnant and would likely soon give birth, it then happened in late 2013, as she gave birth to three cubs, named Kamali, Zalika and Angalia respectively. In August 2014, it was announced that the other lioness, Kya, was due herself. On September 8, 2014, Kya gave birth to a litter of four lion cubs. Three days later, however, one of the cubs had to be humanely euthanized due to an untreatable leg injury.

=== Discovery Plaza ===

Built in the remaining portion of the 1959 feline building (the rest was demolished to make way for Steller Cove), the Amur Cats exhibit is planted to evoke a northern Asian forest. The Discovery plaza exhibit now houses red pandas and Amur tigers.

The exhibit formerly contained a pair of Amur leopards with a 19 year old male named Boris being one of the oldest Amur leopards in captivity. Boris was euthanized on October 10, 2018 

===Elephant Lands===

Three female (Sung-Surin &quot;Shine&quot;, Rose-Tu, and Chendra; Lily died on November 29, 2018) and two male (Samudra and Samson) Asian elephants are displayed at the popular elephant exhibit. All were born at the zoo, with the exception of Chendra, who was orphaned in the wild; and Samson, who was acquired from the Albuquerque Zoo. Chendra is the first Borneo elephant in the United States. On November 30, 2012, at 2:17 a.m., Rose-Tu and the late Tusko (who are also the parents of Samudra) had a female calf Lily, weighing about 300 lbs (136 kg) at birth.

There is a swimming hole in which up to ten elephants can simultaneously completely submerge, sandy ground for comfortable walking and a scratching station, which the elephants often choose to scratch their head, sides, belly, etc. The exhibit was recently enlarged from to , expanding into the same location as the elk and wolves (now gone) once were. Construction for the expansion began in 2013, and included a variety of terrain (meadows, forests, and mud wallows with sand lining the whole enclosure), a timed-feeding system to provide more natural stimulation, and an eco-friendly heating system to keep them warm year-round. Areas of the exhibit such as the Encounter Habitat were completed in summer of 2014, and their new habitat was finished in autumn of 2015.

===Great Northwest===
This exhibit includes wildlife from the western portions of the Pacific Northwest, and has eight areas: Black Bear Ridge, Eagle Canyon, Cascade Stream and Pond, Cougar Crossing, Cascade Crest, Trillium Creek Family Farm, and Steller Cove. Cascade Canyon Trail connects each of the exhibits, except Steller Cove, and includes a suspension bridge that offers views of Black Bear Ridge.

Opened in 1998, Cascade Crest is a mountain-like exhibit made mostly of basalt and features a snow cave, cirque lake, and twisted alpine trees. The exhibit cost $11.6 million and is located near the entrance to the zoo. The only animals are mountain goats.

Black Bear Ridge is the next exhibit along the Cascade Canyon Trail. The $2 million area opened in 2007 and is home to American black bears Black Bear Ridge has three black bears (two males and one female) added in April 2010 after the previous three had been euthanized for health reasons. Their names are Tuff, Dale, and Cubby. A fourth, Takota, died in 2023 during a routine medical procedure.

Eagle Canyon is the next exhibit along the trail and has two bald eagles This area opened in 2004.

Cascade Stream and Pond is the oldest of the Great Northwest exhibits, having opened in 1982. It features North American beavers, North American river otters, painted turtles and ducks including buffleheads, cinnamon teals, hooded mergansers, northern pintails, northern shovelers, redheads and wood ducks.

Cougar Crossing features two cougars, Chinook and Paiute, in a facility that opened in 2006.

Next to Cougar Crossing is Condors of the Columbia. Three California condors, Kaweah, Tyrion and &quot;432&quot; (unnamed), moved into this new exhibit on May 24, 2014. These condors came from a large breeding facility located near Redland, Oregon.

The last area along the Cascade Canyon Trail is the Trillium Creek Family Farm. Opened in 2004 at a cost of $1 million, animals are presented by high school students who also explain local farming historical trends, technology, and demonstrate related activities such as composting, shearing, and agriculture. A variety of domestic animals such as pygmy and Pygora goats and chickens are part of the farm&#x27;s exhibits.

The final area of the Great Northwest Exhibit is the Steller Cove which features animals and plants from the Oregon Coast. The $11 million exhibit opened in 2000 and includes a tide pool and kelp forest populated with harbor seals and sea otters.

===Nature Exploration Station===
The Nature Exploration Station is part of the zoo&#x27;s education complex that opened in 2017. It includes interactive educational exhibits, an insect zoo with living insects and other arthropods, being raised for release into the wild. Some of the species include Australian walking sticks, emperor scorpions, giant African millipedes, Madagascar hissing cockroaches and Mexican redknee tarantulas.

===Penguinarium===

The zoo has a Penguinarium which exhibits Humboldt penguins, Originally built in 1959, it was extensively remodeled in 1982 to represent the Peruvian coast, and remodeled again in 2011 to improve water efficiency.

===Polar Passage===
Opened in 2021, Polar Passage features polar bears in an exhibit modeled on the Arctic tundra and coast that includes naturalistic landscaping, tundra plants, elevated areas for long views, shallow and deep saltwater pools, and areas to accommodate family groups.

===Primate Forest===
The Primate Forest contains Red Ape Reserve, a 2010 indoor/outdoor exhibit housing Bornean and Sumatran orangutans and northern white-cheeked gibbons, and a chimpanzee indoor/outdoor habitat that opened in 2021.

The zoo housed the world&#x27;s oldest Sumatran orangutan, Inji, who celebrated her 59th birthday on January 30, 2019. Inji was humanely euthanized January 9, 2021 after keepers noticed her failing health.

=== Behind the scenes animals ===
The zoo also houses some behind the scenes animals such as Blue and Gold macaws, rabbits, Toucans, reptiles, a kinkajou, a prehensile-tailed porcupine, and a two toed sloth.

==Other attractions==
* Wildlife Live! summer shows, weather permitting
* Summer concert series
* Zoolights: December holiday evenings light display
* Washington Park and Zoo Railway
* Carousel

==Public access==
Parking at the Oregon Zoo costs $2 per hour, to a maximum of $8 per day. 
The Washington Park light rail station provides regional public transit access to the Oregon Zoo. TriMet bus route 63-Washington Park no longer serves the zoo via Washington Park as of summer 2022.

==Conservation==

The Oregon Zoo collaborates with wildlife agencies and conservation organizations on recovery projects for imperiled species including California condors, western pond turtles, northern leopard frogs, Oregon silverspot butterflies and Taylor’s checkerspot butterflies. Through its Future for Wildlife grants program, the zoo funds projects that directly contribute to the survival, health and welfare of free-living populations and ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. The zoo manages a community science project to monitor the American pika and was the first zoo in the world to successfully breed critically endangered Columbia Basin pygmy rabbits and Oregon silverspot butterflies.

The zoo&#x27;s Integrated Conservation Action Plan (ICAP) centers on four regions: Pacific Northwest, Arctic, Southeast Asia and West Africa. In 2012 the Oregon Zoo became the first zoo to draw blood samples from polar bears without the use of anesthesia, leading to the development of a groundbreaking polar bear conservation science program. The zoo has since partnered with the U.S. Geological Survey on polar bear diet, energetics, and movement studies. In Borneo, the zoo supports elephant conservation by funding two ranger positions, and partners with Malaysian and Indonesian organizations to mitigate human-wildlife conflict and improve animal welfare for elephants and orangutans.

=== California Condors ===
In 2001 the zoo joined the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s California Condor Recovery Program. California Condors are slow to reproduce, laying only one egg every one to two years. In 2003 the first six condor breeding pairs were brought to the zoo&#x27;s 52-acre Johnsson Center for Wildlife Conservation. As of 2019, 79 chicks have hatched, 56 Oregon Zoo-reared birds have gone out to field pens for release, and over 50 have been released into the wild.

The zoo also manages community-based conservation education efforts, including the Non-Lead Hunting Education Program, to protect condors and other wildlife from lead poisoning, the greatest cause of wild condor mortality. Ingesting carcasses riddled with toxic lead fragments results in approximately 50 percent of known causes of condor deaths since 1992.

=== Pacific Northwest Frogs and Turtles ===
From 1998 to 2012 the zoo partnered on a recovery effort for endangered Oregon spotted frogs, a candidate for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act, and currently collaborates on a head-start and release program for northern leopard frogs. Frog eggs are collected and hatched at the Oregon Zoo or the Cedar Creek Correction Center, which has partnered with the zoo since 2009. Juvenile frogs are then released into the wild, with a goal of creating a self-sustaining population. The captive rearing project works in collaboration with regional zoos and aquariums to save Pacific Northwest frog species imperiled by loss of habitat, invasive predators and the deadly chytrid fungus, which has quickly spread from Africa to threaten amphibian populations worldwide.

The Oregon Zoo&#x27;s Western Pond Turtle Recovery Project has helped establish two new western pond turtle populations in the Columbia River Gorge, where invasive bullfrogs have driven the tiny species to the brink of extinction. Infant pond turtles are collected and raised in the project lab at the zoo until they large enough to be safely released back into the wild. More than 1,500 turtles have been released in the Columbia Gorge since 1990, with a 95 percent annual survival rate.

=== Butterflies ===
In 1999, at the request of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Oregon Zoo joined with Seattle&#x27;s Woodland Park Zoo in an Oregon silverspot butterfly captive rearing program to save a species once found from California to British Columbia and now reduced to five isolated populations. Around 2,000 butterflies have been raised from larvae and released each year at the Oregon coast. For this work the two zoos were jointly awarded the 2012 AZA North American Conservation Award. In 2019, the Oregon Zoo successfully bred a captive silverspot butterfly for the first time in the world, producing in 269 viable offspring.

Additionally, the zoo has partnered with the Coffee Creek Correctional Facility to train inmates who volunteer to help raise and care for the critically endangered Taylor&#x27;s butterfly. Habitat degradation due to invasive species, urban development and agriculture have reduced the Taylor&#x27;s checkerspots&#x27; native habitat by 99 percent. The Taylor&#x27;s checkerspot captive rearing project has raised and released over 28,000 butterflies.

=== Borneo Elephants ===
Oregon Zoo’s Care and Conservation of Borneo Elephants program supports projects in Sabah, Malaysia, to reduce human-wildlife conflict, create safe travel corridors for elephants and other wildlife in degraded landscapes and provide care for injured or orphaned elephants. The Zoo partners with Seratu Aatai to promote co-existence between people and elephants through research and educational outreach to local communities, government agencies, the palm oil industry and academics.

In 2015 the Woodland Park Zoo, Houston Zoo, Oregon Zoo and HUTAN-KOCP founded the “Borneo Elephant Zoo Alliance” with the goal of ensuring long-term survival of the Bornean elephant in the wild. The alliance focuses on enhancing scientific knowledge of elephant ecology and conservation status and reducing human-animal conflict in the Kinabatangan River area through community outreach, public policy, and use of technology. In recent years, Oregon Zoo’s work with HUTAN-KOCP has focused primarily on forest preservation and reforestation for the benefit of both elephants and orangutans.

Intertwined with these efforts is managing the impact of palm oil production. The Oregon Zoo is a member of the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), which has developed and is implementing global environmental and social standards for sustainable palm oil. As a member, the Oregon Zoo has committed to using only RSPO certified palm oil.

==Incidents and controversies==

The birth of Packy in 1962 began an elephant breeding program at the Oregon Zoo, resulting in a total of 28 elephant calves being born to date, of which seven were sired by Packy. Of these, however, 15 died prematurely and the whereabouts of two calves are unknown. Some elephants such as Stoney, Sabu, and Prince were sold to the circus, a few elephants such as Hanako and Dino were loaned to other zoos, whereas Emma and Teak were sold to private buyers.

On July 4, 1970, three intoxicated men broke into the zoo at night. One of them was killed by the zoo&#x27;s two lions while he was showing off by lowering himself into their enclosure. The next night, one of the men broke into the zoo again and shot both of the lions. The incident stirred a public outcry against the men, including the victim of the mauling and sparked a wave of donations to replace the lions.

In April 2000, Rose-Tu, a female elephant born at the zoo, was severely abused by her handler, resulting in 176 lacerations including puncture wounds allegedly due to the handler attempting to shove a bullhook into her anus. It was speculated that the trauma suffered by her as a result of this experience may have compromised her ability to raise calves. The handler was dismissed by the zoo and sentenced to two years probation and 120 hours of community service, the most severe punishment allowed by state laws at the time. As fallout from this incident, Animal Legal Defense Fund authored the &quot;Rose-Tu law&quot;, signed by Governor John Kitzhaber in 2001. The law made Oregon the first U.S. state to legally recognize the link between animal abuse and violence toward people, and increased the penalties for animal abuse.

In December 2012, the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; brought to light that the new-born elephant Lily, sired by Tusko, a bull elephant on loan from the elephant rental company &quot;Have Trunk Will Travel&quot;, was contracted to be owned by the private company. After widespread public outcry, the zoo raised funds to acquire both Tusko and Lily from &quot;Have Trunk Will Travel&quot; for $400,000 in February 2013.

In May 2014, then-director Kim Smith and lead veterinarian Dr. Mitch Finnegan were dismissed by Metro, the agency governing the Zoo, over alleged lapses in protocols following the death of Kutai, a 20-year-old orangutan, during surgery. After the Zoo protested the veterinarian&#x27;s termination at Metro Council, he was rehired in July.

In June 2014, six tamarin monkeys died two days after arriving at the zoo from Harvard&#x27;s New England Primate Research Center. The incident, along with previous primate deaths in Massachusetts, prompted a USDA investigation of the Harvard center that had transported the monkeys.

<text>Tribology is the science and engineering of understanding friction, lubrication and wear phenomena for interacting surfaces in relative motion. It is highly interdisciplinary, drawing on many academic fields, including physics, chemistry, materials science, mathematics, biology and engineering. The fundamental objects of study in tribology are tribosystems, which are physical systems of contacting surfaces. Subfields of tribology include biotribology, nanotribology and space tribology. It is also related to other areas such as the coupling of corrosion and tribology in tribocorrosion and the contact mechanics of how surfaces in contact deform.
Approximately 20% of the total energy expenditure of the world is due to the impact of friction and wear in the transportation, manufacturing, power generation, and residential sectors.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;tribology&quot; derives from the Greek root τριβ- of the verb , &quot;&quot;, &quot;I rub&quot; in classic Greek, and the suffix &quot;-logy&quot; from , &quot;&quot; &quot;study of&quot;, &quot;knowledge of&quot;. Peter Jost coined the word in 1966, in the eponymous report which highlighted the cost of friction, wear and corrosion to the UK economy.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Despite the relatively recent naming of the field of tribology, quantitative studies of friction can be traced as far back as 1493, when Leonardo da Vinci first noted the two fundamental &#x27;laws&#x27; of friction. According to Leonardo, frictional resistance was the same for two different objects of the same weight but making contact over different widths and lengths. He also observed that the force needed to overcome friction doubles as weight doubles. However, Leonardo&#x27;s findings remained unpublished in his notebooks.

The two fundamental &#x27;laws&#x27; of friction were first published (in 1699) by Guillaume Amontons, with whose name they are now usually associated. They state that:
* the force of friction acting between two sliding surfaces is proportional to the load pressing the surfaces together
* the force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact between the two surfaces.
Although not universally applicable, these simple statements hold for a surprisingly wide range of systems. These laws were further developed by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (in 1785), who noticed that static friction force may depend on the contact time and sliding (kinetic) friction may depend on sliding velocity, normal force and contact area.

In 1798, Charles Hatchett and Henry Cavendish carried out the first reliable test on frictional wear. In a study commissioned by the Privy Council of the UK, they used a simple reciprocating machine to evaluate the wear rate of gold coins. They found that coins with grit between them wore at a faster rate compared to self-mated coins. In 1860, Theodor Reye proposed . In 1953, John Frederick Archard developed the Archard equation which describes sliding wear and is based on the theory of asperity contact.

Other pioneers of tribology research are Australian physicist Frank Philip Bowden and British physicist David Tabor, both of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. Together they wrote the seminal textbook &quot;The Friction and Lubrication of Solids&quot; (Part I originally published in 1950 and Part II in 1964). Michael J. Neale was another leader in the field during the mid-to-late 1900s. He specialized in solving problems in machine design by applying his knowledge of tribology. Neale was respected as an educator with a gift for integrating theoretical work with his own practical experience to produce easy-to-understand design guides. &quot;The Tribology Handbook&quot;, which he first edited in 1973 and updated in 1995, is still used around the world and forms the basis of numerous training courses for engineering designers.

Duncan Dowson surveyed the history of tribology in his 1997 book &quot;History of Tribology&quot; (2nd edition). This covers developments from prehistory, through early civilizations (Mesopotamia, ancient Egypt) and highlights the key developments up to the end of the twentieth century.

=== The Jost report ===
The term &quot;tribology&quot; became widely used following &quot;The Jost Report&quot; published in 1966. The report highlighted the huge cost of friction, wear and corrosion to the UK economy (1.1–1.4% of GDP). As a result, the UK government established several national centres to address tribological problems. Since then the term has diffused into the international community, with many specialists now identifying as &quot;tribologists&quot;.

== Significance ==
Despite considerable research since the Jost Report, the global impact of friction and wear on energy consumption, economic expenditure, and carbon dioxide emissions are still considerable. In 2017, Kenneth Holmberg and Ali Erdemir attempted to quantify their impact worldwide. They considered the four main energy consuming sectors: transport, manufacturing, power generation, and residential. The following were concluded: 
* In total, ~23% of the world&#x27;s energy consumption originates from tribological contacts. Of that, 20% is to overcome friction and 3% to remanufacture worn parts and spare equipment due to wear and wear-related.
* By taking advantage of the new technologies for friction reduction and wear protection, energy losses due to friction and wear in vehicles, machinery and other equipment worldwide could be reduced by 40% in the long term (15 years) and 18% in the short term (8 years). On a global scale, these savings would amount to 1.4% of GDP annually and 8.7% of total energy consumption in the long term.
* The largest short term energy savings are envisioned in transport (25%) and in power generation (20%) while the potential savings in the manufacturing and residential sectors are estimated to be ~10%. In the longer term, savings would be 55%, 40%, 25%, and 20%, respectively.
* Implementing advanced tribological technologies can also reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 1,460 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2) and result in 450,000 million Euros cost savings in the short term. In the long term, the reduction could be as large as 3,140 MtCO2 and the cost savings 970,000 million Euros.

Classical tribology covering such applications as ball bearings, gear drives, clutches, brakes, etc. was developed in the context of mechanical engineering. But in the last decades tribology expanded to qualitatively new fields of applications, in particular micro- and nanotechnology as well as biology and medicine.

== Fundamental concepts ==
=== Tribosystem ===
The concept of tribosystems is used to provide a detailed assessment of relevant inputs, outputs and losses to tribological systems. Knowledge of these parameters allows tribologists to devise test procedures for tribological systems.

=== Tribofilm ===

Tribofilms are thin films that form on tribologically stressed surfaces. They play an important role in reducing friction and wear in tribological systems.

=== Stribeck curve ===
The Stribeck curve shows how friction in fluid-lubricated contacts is a non-linear function of lubricant viscosity, entrainment velocity and contact load.

== Physics ==
=== Friction ===

The word friction comes from the Latin &quot;frictionem&quot;, which means rubbing. This term is used to describe all those dissipative phenomena, capable of producing heat and of opposing the relative motion between two surfaces. There are two main types of friction:
; Static friction: Which occurs between surfaces in a fixed state, or relatively stationary.
; Dynamic friction: Which occurs between surfaces in relative motion.

The study of friction phenomena is a predominantly empirical study and does not allow to reach precise results, but only to useful approximate conclusions. This inability to obtain a definite result is due to the extreme complexity of the phenomenon. If it is studied more closely it presents new elements, which, in turn, make the global description even more complex.

==== Laws of friction ====
All the theories and studies on friction can be simplified into three main laws, which are valid in most cases:
; First Law of Amontons: The frictional force is directly proportional to the normal load.
; Second Law of Amontons: Friction is independent of the apparent area of contact.
; Third Law of Coulomb: Dynamic friction is independent of the relative sliding speed.
Coulomb later found deviations from Amontons&#x27; laws in some cases. In systems with significant nonuniform stress fields, Amontons&#x27; laws are not satisfied macroscopically because local slip occurs before the entire system slides.

==== Static friction====
Consider a block of a certain mass m, placed in a quiet position on a horizontal plane. If you want to move the block, an external force formula_1 must be applied, in this way we observe a certain resistance to the motion given by a force equal to and opposite to the applied force, which is precisely the static frictional force formula_2.

By continuously increasing the applied force, we obtain a value such that the block starts instantly to move. At this point, also taking into account the first two friction laws stated above, it is possible to define the static friction force as a force equal in modulus to the minimum force required to cause the motion of the block, and the coefficient of static friction formula_3 as the ratio of the static friction force formula_2. and the normal force at block formula_5, obtainingformula_6

==== Dynamic friction ====
Once the block has been put into motion, the block experiences a friction force with a lesser intensity than the static friction force formula_2. The friction force during relative motion is known as the dynamic friction force formula_8. In this case it is necessary to take into account not only the first two laws of Amontons, but also of the law of Coulomb, so as to be able to affirm that the relationship between dynamic friction force formula_8, coefficient of dynamic friction &quot;k&quot; and normal force &quot;N&quot; is the following:formula_10

==== Static and dynamic friction coefficient ====

At this point it is possible to summarize the main properties of the static friction coefficients formula_3 and the dynamic one formula_12.

These coefficients are dimensionless quantities, given by the ratio between the intensity of the friction force formula_13and the intensity of the applied load formula_14, depending on the type of surfaces that are involved in a mutual contact, and in any case, the condition is always valid such that: formula_15.

Usually, the value of both coefficients does not exceed the unit and can be considered constant only within certain ranges of forces and velocities, outside of which there are extreme conditions that modify these coefficients and variables. 

In systems with significant nonuniform stress fields, the macroscopic static friction coefficient depends on the external pressure, system size, or shape because local slip occurs before the system slides. 

The following table shows the values of the static and dynamic friction coefficients for common materials:
==== Rolling friction ====

In the case of bodies capable of rolling, there is a particular type of friction, in which the sliding phenomenon, typical of dynamic friction, does not occur, but there is also a force that opposes the motion, which also excludes the case of static friction. This type of friction is called rolling friction. Now we want to observe in detail what happens to a wheel that rolls on a horizontal plane. Initially the wheel is immobile and the forces acting on it are the weight force formula_16 and the normal force formula_17given by the response to the weight of the floor.

At this point the wheel is set in motion, causing a displacement at the point of application of the normal force which is now applied in front of the center of the wheel, at a distance &quot;b&quot;, which is equal to the value of the rolling friction coefficient. The opposition to the motion is caused by the separation of the normal force and the weight force at the exact moment in which the rolling starts, so the value of the torque given by the rolling friction force isformula_18What happens in detail at the microscopic level between the wheel and the supporting surface is described in Figure, where it is possible to observe what is the behavior of the reaction forces of the deformed plane acting on an immobile wheel.

Rolling the wheel continuously causes imperceptible deformations of the plane and, once passed to a subsequent point, the plane returns to its initial state. In the compression phase the plane opposes the motion of the wheel, while in the decompression phase it provides a positive contribution to the motion.

The force of rolling friction depends, therefore, on the small deformations suffered by the supporting surface and by the wheel itself, and can be expressed as formula_19, where it is possible to express &quot;b&quot; in relation to the sliding friction coefficient formula_3 as formula_21, with &quot;r&quot; being the wheel radius.

==== The surfaces ====
Going even deeper, it is possible to study not only the most external surface of the metal, but also the immediately more internal states, linked to the history of the metal, its composition and the manufacturing processes undergone by the latter.

it is possible to divide the metal into four different layers:
# Crystalline structure – basic structure of the metal, bulk interior form;
# Machined layer – layer which may also have inclusions of foreign material and which derives from the processing processes to which the metal has been subjected;
# Hardened layer – has a crystalline structure of greater hardness than the inner layers, thanks to the rapid cooling to which they are subjected in the working processes;
# Outer layer or oxide layer – layer that is created due to chemical interaction with the metal&#x27;s environment and from the deposition of impurities.

The layer of oxides and impurities (third body) has a fundamental tribological importance, in fact it usually contributes to reducing friction. Another fact of fundamental importance regarding oxides is that if you could clean and smooth the surface in order to obtain a pure &quot;metal surface&quot;, what we would observe is the union of the two surfaces in contact. In fact, in the absence of thin layers of contaminants, the atoms of the metal in question, are not able to distinguish one body from another, thus going to form a single body if put in contact.

==== The origin of friction ====
Contact between surfaces is made up of a large number of microscopic regions, in the literature called asperities or junctions of contact, where atom-to-atom contact takes place. The phenomenon of friction, and therefore of the dissipation of energy, is due precisely to the deformations that such regions undergo due to the load and relative movement. Plastic, elastic, or rupture deformations can be observed:

* Plastic deformations – permanent deformations of the shape of the bumps;
* Elastic deformations – deformations in which the energy expended in the compression phase is almost entirely recovered in the decompression phase (elastic hysteresis);
* Break deformations – deformations that lead to the breaking of bumps and the creation of new contact areas.

The energy that is dissipated during the phenomenon is transformed into heat, thus increasing the temperature of the surfaces in contact. The increase in temperature also depends on the relative speed and the roughness of the material, it can be so high as to even lead to the fusion of the materials involved.

In friction phenomena, temperature is fundamental in many areas of application. For example, a rise in temperature may result in a sharp reduction of the friction coefficient, and consequently, the effectiveness of the brakes.

==== The cohesion theory ====
The adhesion theory states that in the case of spherical asperities in contact with each other, subjected to a formula_14 load, a deformation is observed, which, as the load increases, passes from an elastic to a plastic deformation. This phenomenon involves an enlargement of the real contact area formula_23, which for this reason can be expressed as:formula_24where D is the hardness of the material definable as the applied load divided by the area of the contact surface.
If at this point the two surfaces are sliding between them, a resistance to shear stress &quot;t&quot; is observed, given by the presence of adhesive bonds, which were created precisely because of the plastic deformations, and therefore the frictional force will be given byformula_25At this point, since the coefficient of friction is the ratio between the intensity of the frictional force and that of the applied load, it is possible to state thatformula_26thus relating to the two material properties: shear strength &quot;t&quot; and hardness. To obtain low value friction coefficients formula_3 it is possible to resort to materials which require less shear stress, but which are also very hard. In the case of lubricants, in fact, we use a substrate of material with low cutting stress &quot;t&quot;, placed on a very hard material.

The force acting between two solids in contact will not only have normal components, as implied so far, but will also have tangential components. This further complicates the description of the interactions between roughness, because due to this tangential component plastic deformation comes with a lower load than when ignoring this component. A more realistic description then of the area of each single junction that is created is given byformula_28with formula_29 constant and a &quot;tangent&quot; force formula_30 applied to the joint.
To obtain even more realistic considerations, the phenomenon of the third body should also be considered, i.e., the presence of foreign materials, such as moisture, oxides or lubricants, between the two solids in contact. A coefficient c is then introduced which is able to correlate the shear strength &quot;t&quot; of the pure &quot;material&quot; and that of the third body formula_31formula_32with 0 &lt; &quot;c&quot; &lt; 1.

By studying the behavior at the limits it will be that for &quot;c&quot; = 0, &quot;t&quot; = 0 and for &quot;c&quot; = 1 it returns to the condition in which the surfaces are directly in contact and there is no presence of a third body. Keeping in mind what has just been said, it is possible to correct the friction coefficient formula as follows:formula_33In conclusion, the case of elastic bodies in interaction with each other is considered.
Similarly to what we have just seen, it is possible to define an equation of the typeformula_34where, in this case, &quot;K&quot; depends on the elastic properties of the materials. Also for the elastic bodies the tangential force depends on the coefficient &quot;c&quot; seen above, and it will beformula_35and therefore a fairly exhaustive description of the friction coefficient can be obtainedformula_36

==== Friction measurements ====
The simplest and most immediate method for evaluating the friction coefficient of two surfaces is the use of an inclined plane on which a block of material is made to slide. As can be seen in the figure, the normal force of the plane is given by formula_37, while the frictional force is equal to formula_38. This allows us to state that the coefficient of friction can be calculated very easily, by means of the tangent of the angle in which the block begins to slip. In fact we haveformula_39Then from the inclined plane we moved on to more sophisticated systems, which allow us to consider all the possible environmental conditions in which the measurement is made, such as the cross-roller machine or the pin and disk machine. Today there are digital machines such as the &quot;Friction Tester&quot; which allows, by means of a software support, to insert all the desired variables. Another widely used process is the ring compression test. A flat ring of the material to be studied is plastically deformed by means of a press, if the deformation is an expansion in both the inner and the outer circle, then there will be low or zero friction coefficients. Otherwise for a deformation that expands only in the inner circle there will be increasing friction coefficients.

=== Lubrication ===

To reduce friction between surfaces and keep wear under control, materials called lubricants are used. Unlike what you might think, these are not just oils or fats, but any fluid material that is characterized by viscosity, such as air and water. Of course, some lubricants are more suitable than others, depending on the type of use they are intended for: air and water, for example, are readily available, but the former can only be used under limited load and speed conditions, while the second can contribute to the wear of materials.

What we try to achieve by means of these materials is a perfect fluid lubrication, or a lubrication such that it is possible to avoid direct contact between the surfaces in question, inserting a lubricant film between them. To do this there are two possibilities, depending on the type of application, the costs to address and the level of &quot;perfection&quot; of the lubrication desired to be achieved, there is a choice between:
* Fluidostatic lubrication (or hydrostatic in the case of mineral oils) – which consists in the insertion of lubricating material under pressure between the surfaces in contact;
* Fluid fluid lubrication (or hydrodynamics) – which consists in exploiting the relative motion between the surfaces to make the lubricating material penetrate.

==== Viscosity ====

The viscosity is the equivalent of friction in fluids, it describes, in fact, the ability of fluids to resist the forces that cause a change in shape.

Thanks to Newton&#x27;s studies, a deeper understanding of the phenomenon has been achieved. He, in fact, introduced the concept of laminar flow: &quot;a flow in which the velocity changes from layer to layer&quot;. It is possible to ideally divide a fluid between two surfaces (formula_40, formula_41) of area A, in various layers.

The layer in contact with the surface formula_41, which moves with a velocity &quot;v&quot; due to an applied force &quot;F&quot;, will have the same velocity as &quot;v&quot; of the slab, while each immediately following layer will vary this velocity of a quantity &quot;dv&quot;, up to the layer in contact with the immobile surface formula_40, which will have zero speed.

From what has been said, it is possible to state that the force &quot;F&quot;, necessary to cause a rolling motion in a fluid contained between two plates, is proportional to the area of the two surfaces and to the speed gradient:formula_44At this point we can introduce a proportional constant formula_3, which corresponds to the dynamic viscosity coefficient of the fluid, to obtain the following equation, known as Newton&#x27;s lawformula_46The speed varies by the same amount &quot;dv&quot; of layer in layer and then the condition occurs so that &quot;dv&quot; / &quot;dy&quot; = &quot;v&quot; / &quot;L&quot;, where &quot;L&quot; is the distance between the surfaces formula_40 and formula_41, and then we can simplify the equation by writingformula_49The viscosity formula_3 is high in fluids that strongly oppose the motion, while it is contained for fluids that flow easily.

To determine what kind of flow is in the study, we observe its Reynolds numberformula_51This is a constant that depends on the fluid mass formula_52 of the fluid, on its viscosity formula_3 and on the diameter &quot;L&quot; of the tube in which the fluid flows. If the Reynolds number is relatively low then there is a laminar flow, whereas for formula_54 the flow becomes turbulent.

To conclude we want to underline that it is possible to divide the fluids into two types according to their viscosity:

# Newtonian fluids, or fluids in which viscosity is a function of temperature and fluid pressure only and not of velocity gradient;
# Non-Newtonian fluids, or fluids in which viscosity also depends on the velocity gradient.

==== Viscosity as a function of temperature and pressure ====
Temperature and pressure are two fundamental factors to evaluate when choosing a lubricant instead of another. Consider the effects of temperature initially.

There are three main causes of temperature variation that can affect the behavior of the lubricant:

* Weather conditions;
* Local thermal factors (like for car engines or refrigeration pumps);
* Energy dissipation due to rubbing between surfaces.

In order to classify the various lubricants according to their viscosity behavior as a function of temperature, in 1929 the viscosity index (V.I.) was introduced by Dean and Davis. These assigned the best lubricant then available, namely the oil of Pennsylvania, the viscosity index 100, and at the worst, the American oil of the Gulf Coast, the value 0. To determine the value of the intermediate oil index, the following procedure is used: two reference oils are chosen so that the oil in question has the same viscosity at 100 °C, and the following equation is used to determine the viscosity indexformula_55This process has some disadvantages:

* For mixtures of oils the results are not exact;
* There is no information if you are outside the fixed temperature range;
* With the advancement of the technologies, oils with V.I. more than 100, which can not be described by the method above.

In the case of oils with V.I. above 100 you can use a different relationship that allows you to get exact resultsformula_56formula_57where, in this case, H is the viscosity at of the oil with V.I. = 100 and v is the kinematic viscosity of the study oil at .

We can therefore say, in conclusion, that an increase in temperature leads to a decrease in the viscosity of the oil. It is also useful to keep in mind that, in the same way, an increase in pressure implies an increase in viscosity. To evaluate the effects of pressure on viscosity, the following equation is usedformula_58where formula_59 is the pressure viscosity coefficient p, formula_60 is the viscosity coefficient at atmospheric pressure and formula_61 is a constant that describes the relationship between viscosity and pressure.

==== Viscosity measures ====
To determine the viscosity of a fluid, viscosimeters are used which can be divided into 3 main categories:
* Capillary viscometers, in which the viscosity of the fluid is measured by sliding it into a capillary tube;
* Solid drop viscometers, in which viscosity is measured by calculating the velocity of a solid that moves in the fluid;
* Rotational viscometers, in which viscosity is obtained by evaluating the flow of fluid placed between two surfaces in relative motion.

The first two types of viscometers are mainly used for Newtonian fluids, while the third is very versatile.

=== Wear ===

The wear is the progressive involuntary removal of material from a surface in relative motion with another or with a fluid. We can distinguish two different types of wear: moderate wear and severe wear. The first case concerns low loads and smooth surfaces, while the second concerns significantly higher loads and compatible and rough surfaces, in which the wear processes are much more violent. Wear plays a fundamental role in tribological studies, since it causes changes in the shape of the components used in the construction of machinery (for example). These worn parts must be replaced and this entails both a problem of an economic nature, due to the cost of replacement, and a functional problem, since if these components are not replaced in time, more serious damage could occur to the machine in its complex. This phenomenon, however, has not only negative sides, indeed, it is often used to reduce the roughness of some materials, eliminating the asperities. Erroneously we tend to imagine wear in a direct correlation with friction, in reality these two phenomena can not be easily connected. There may be conditions such that low friction can result in significant wear and vice versa. In order for this phenomenon to occur, certain implementation times are required, which may change depending on some variables, such as load, speed, lubrication and environmental conditions, and there are different wear mechanisms, which may occur simultaneously or even combined with each other:
# Adhesive wear;
# Abrasive wear;
# Fatigue wear;
# Corrosive wear;
# Rubbing wear or fretting;
# Erosion wear;
# Other minor wear phenomena (wear by impact, cavitation, wear-fusion, wear-spreading).

==== Adhesive wear ====
As known, the contact between two surfaces occurs through the interaction between asperities. If a shearing force is applied in the contact area, it may be possible to detach a small part of the weaker material, due to its adhesion to the harder surface. What is described is precisely the mechanism of the adhesive wear represented in the figure. This type of wear is very problematic, since it involves high wear speeds, but at the same time it is possible to reduce adhesion by increasing surface roughness and hardness of the surfaces involved, or by inserting layers of contaminants such as oxygen, oxides, water, or oils. In conclusion, the behavior of the adhesive wear volume can be described by means of three main laws

; Law 1 – Distance: The mass involved in wear is proportional to the distance traveled in the rubbing between the surfaces.
; Law 2 – Load: The mass involved in wear is proportional to the applied load.
; Law 3 – Hardness: The mass involved in wear is inversely proportional to the hardness of the &quot;less&quot; hard material.

An important aspect of wear is emission of wear particles into the environment which increasingly threatens human health and ecology. The first researcher who investigated this topic was Ernest Rabinowicz.

==== Abrasive wear ====
The abrasive wear consists of the cutting effort of hard surfaces that act on softer surfaces and can be caused either by the roughness that as tips cut off the material against which they rub (two-body abrasive wear), or from particles of hard material that interpose between two surfaces in relative motion (three-body abrasive wear). At application levels, the two-body wear is easily eliminated by means of an adequate surface finish, while the three-body wear can bring serious problems and must therefore be removed as much as possible by means of suitable filters, even before of a weighted machine design.

==== Fatigue wear ====
The fatigue wear is a type of wear that is caused by alternative loads, which cause local contact forces repeated over time, which in turn lead to deterioration of the materials involved. The most immediate example of this type of wear is that of a comb. If you slide a finger over the teeth of the comb over and over again, it is observed that at some point one or more teeth of the comb come off. This phenomenon can lead to the breaking of the surfaces due to mechanical or thermal causes. The first case is that described above in which a repeated load causes high contact stresses. The second case, however, is caused by the thermal expansion of the materials involved in the process. To reduce this type of wear, therefore, it is good to try to decrease both the contact forces and the thermal cycling, that is the frequency with which different temperatures intervene. For optimal results it is also good to eliminate, as much as possible, impurities between surfaces, local defects and inclusions of foreign materials in the bodies involved.

==== Corrosive wear ====
The corrosive wear occurs in the presence of metals that oxidize or corrode. When the pure metal surfaces come into contact with the surrounding environment, oxide films are created on their surfaces because of the contaminants present in the environment itself, such as water, oxygen or acids. These films are continually removed from the abrasive and adhesive wear mechanisms, continually recreated by pure-contaminating metal interactions. Clearly this type of wear can be reduced by trying to create an &#x27;ad hoc&#x27; environment, free of pollutants and sensible to minimal thermal changes. Corrosive wear can also be positive in some applications. In fact, the oxides that are created, contribute to decrease the coefficient of friction between the surfaces, or, being in many cases harder than the metal to which they belong, can be used as excellent abrasives.

==== Rubbing wear or fretting ====
The rubbing wear occurs in systems subject to more or less intense vibrations, which cause relative movements between the surfaces in contact within the order of nanometers. These microscopic relative movements cause both adhesive wear, caused by the displacement itself, and abrasive wear, caused by the particles produced in the adhesive phase, which remain trapped between the surfaces. This type of wear can be accelerated by the presence of corrosive substances and the increase in temperature.

==== Erosion wear ====
The erosion wear occurs when free particles, which can be either solid or liquid, hit a surface, causing abrasion. The mechanisms involved are of various kinds and depend on certain parameters, such as the impact angle, the particle size, the impact velocity and the material of which the particles are made up.

==== Factors affecting wear ====
Among the main factors influencing wear we find
* Hardness
* Mutual Solubility
* Crystalline structure

It has been verified that the harder a material is, the more it decreases. In the same way, the less two materials are mutually soluble, the more the wear tends to decrease. Finally, as regards the crystalline structure, it is possible to state that some structures are more suitable to resist the wear of others, such as a hexagonal structure with a compact distribution, which can only deform by slipping along the base planes.

==== Wear rate ====
To provide an assessment of the damage caused by wear, we use a dimensionless coefficient called wear rate, given by the ratio between the height change of the body formula_62 and the length of the relative sliding formula_63.formula_64This coefficient makes it possible to subdivide, depending on its size, the damage suffered by various materials in different situations, passing from a modest degree of wear, through a medium, to a degree of severe wear.

Instead, to express the volume of wear V it is possible to use the Holm equation

* formula_65 (for adhesive wear)
* formula_66 (for abrasive wear)

where W / H represents the real contact area, l the length of the distance traveled and k and formula_67 are experimental dimensional factors.

==== Wear measurement ====
In experimental measurements of material wear, it is often necessary to recreate fairly small wear rates and to accelerate times. The phenomena, which in reality develop after years, in the laboratory must occur after a few days. A first evaluation of the wear processes is a visual inspection of the superficial profile of the body in the study, including a comparison before and after the occurrence of the wear phenomenon. In this first analysis the possible variations of the hardness and of the superficial geometry of the material are observed. Another method of investigation is that of the radioactive tracer, used to evaluate wear at macroscopic levels. One of the two materials in contact, involved in a wear process, is marked with a radioactive tracer. In this way, the particles of this material, which will be removed, will be easily visible and accessible. Finally, to accelerate wear times, one of the best-known techniques used is that of the high pressure contact tests. In this case, to obtain the desired results it is sufficient to apply the load on a very reduced contact area.

== Applications ==
=== Transport and manufacturing ===
Historically, tribology research concentrated on the design and effective lubrication of machine components, particularly for bearings. However, the study of tribology extends into most aspects of modern technology and any system where one material slides over another can be affected by complex tribological interactions.

Traditionally, tribology research in the transport industry focused on reliability, ensuring the safe, continuous operation of machine components. Nowadays, due to an increased focus on energy consumption, efficiency has become increasingly important and thus lubricants have become progressively more complex and sophisticated in order to achieve this. Tribology also plays an important role in manufacturing. For example, in metal-forming operations, friction increases tool wear and the power required to work a piece. This results in increased costs due to more frequent tool replacement, loss of tolerance as tool dimensions shift, and greater forces required to shape a piece.

One of the more common materials in aerospace specifically is copper matrix self-lubricating composites, which use solid lubricants. These lubricants are mixed in with the copper and other materials, which is effectively done by resonant acoustic mixing.

The use of lubricants which minimize direct surface contact reduces tool wear and power requirements. It is also necessary to know the effects of manufacturing, all manufacturing methods leave a unique system fingerprint (i.e. surface topography) which will influence the tribocontact (e.g. lubricant film formation).

=== Fields ===

Tribology research ranges from macro to nano scales, in areas as diverse as the movement of continental plates and glaciers to the locomotion of animals and insects. Tribology research is traditionally concentrated on transport and manufacturing sectors, but this has considerably diversified. Tribology research can be loosely divided into the following fields (with some overlap):
* Classical tribology is concerned with friction and wear in machine elements (such as rolling-element bearings, gears, plain bearings, brakes, clutches, wheels and fluid bearings) as well as manufacturing processes (such as metal forming).
* Biotribology studies friction, wear and lubrication in biological systems. The field is gaining importance as human lifetime expectancy increases. Human hip and knee joints are typical biotribology systems.
* Green tribology aims to minimize the environmental impact of tribological systems along their entire lifecycle. In particular, green tribology aims to reduce tribological losses (e.g., friction and wear) using technologies with minimal environmental impact. This is in contrast to traditional tribology, where the means of reducing tribological losses are not holistically evaluated. 
* Geotribology studies friction, wear, and lubrication of geological systems, such as glaciers and faults. 
* Nanotribology studies tribological phenomena at nanoscopic scales. The field is becoming increasingly important as devices become smaller (e.g. micro/nanoelectromechanical systems, MEMS/NEMS), and research has been aided by the invention of Atomic Force Microscopy. 
* Computational tribology aims to model the behavior of tribological systems through multiphysics simulations, combining disciplines such as contact mechanics, fracture mechanics and computational fluid dynamics.
* Space tribology studies tribological systems that can operate under the extreme environmental conditions of outer space. In particular, this requires lubricants with low vapor pressure that can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.
* Open system tribology studies tribological systems that are exposed to and affected by the natural environment.
* Triboinformatics is an application of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Big Data methods to tribological systems.

Recently, intensive studies of superlubricity (phenomenon of vanishing friction) have sparked due to increasing demand for energy savings. Furthermore, the development of new materials, such as graphene and ionic liquids, allows for fundamentally new approaches to solve tribological problems.

=== Societies ===
There are now numerous national and international societies, including: the Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers (STLE) in the US, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and Institute of Physics (IMechE Tribology Group, IOP Tribology Group) in the UK, the German Society for Tribology (Gesellschaft für Tribologie), the Korean Tribology Society (KTS), the Malaysian Tribology Society (MYTRIBOS), the Japanese Society of Tribologists (JAST), the Tribology Society of India (TSI), the Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society (Chinese Tribology Institute) and the International Tribology Council.

=== Research approach ===
Tribology research is mostly empirical, which can be explained by the vast number of parameters that influence friction and wear in tribological contacts. Thus, most research fields rely heavily on the use of standardized tribometers and test procedures as well component-level test rigs.

<doc id="489230" wikidata="Q1025966" url="?curid=489230" title="Pattani, Thailand">
<text>Pattani is a town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) in the far south of Thailand, near the border with Malaysia. It is the capital of Pattani Province. The city has a population of 44,353 (2018). It covers the whole &quot;tambon&quot; Sabarang, Anoru and Chabang Tiko of Mueang Pattani district.

Pattani lies 1,056 km south of Bangkok, and is located at the mouth of the Pattani River. A small port is known to have existed at the river mouth Kuala Bekah in the 16th century. The historic centre of Patani was originally located a few miles away where the Krue Se Mosque is located. The older capital of Patani was captured and sacked by Siam in 1785.

The local dialect of Malay is called Pattani Malay or Yawi in Thai (derived from Jawi).

==Etymology==
Some believe that the name &quot;Pattani&quot; originated from Malay name Patani (Jawi: ڤطاني), which can mean &quot;this beach&quot; in Pattani Malay language. (In standard Malay, this would be &quot;pantai ini&quot;.) According to a legend, the founder of Pattani was a raja from Kota Malikha named Phaya Tunakpa. Phaya Tunakpa went hunting one day and saw a beautiful albino mouse-deer the size of a goat, which then disappeared. He asked his men where the animal had gone, and they replied: &quot;Pata ning lah!&quot; (&quot;This beach!&quot; in the Pattani Malay language). They searched for the mouse-deer but found instead an old couple, where the old man identified himself as Che&#x27; Tani (&quot;Mister Tani&quot;). The old man said that he was sent by the raja&#x27;s grandfather to build a new town further beyond but had fallen ill on the journey; as he could not go any further, he stayed at that place. The raja then ordered a town be built at the site where the mouse-deer had disappeared. The town became Patani, which is believed to be named either after &quot;this beach&quot; where the mouse-deer had disappeared. Alternatively, it has also been said to be named after the old man as Pak Tani meaning &quot;Father Tani&quot;.

Some also say the word Pattani is derived from &quot;Petani&quot; in Malay which means &quot;farmer&quot;. Another suggestion is that it derives from a Sanskrit word &quot;pathini&quot;, meaning &quot;virgin nymph&quot;; &quot;Pathini&quot; is also said to be the title of a daughter of Merong Mahawangsa, founder of the preceding kingdom of Langkasuka.

==History==
Modern Pattani is located at the mouth of the Pattani River. The river may have changed course and empty into the sea at the current location in the 16th century. A small port existed in the current location at Kuala Bekah (Kuala Sungai Patani) at the mouth of Patani River by the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Kuala Bekah was one of the two river mouths of old Pattani, the other being Kuala Ru, near which was the old historical centre of the Patani Kingdom that ruled over the region of Patani. The older centre was located 6–7 km to the east of the present city; near Ban Kru Se or Kampong Kersik, which is where the Krue Se Mosque is located. Pattani was captured and sacked by the Siamese in 1785. The town centre developed in the current location and the Sultan moved to Cabang Tiga at the southern side of present-day Pattani in the 19th century. The Patani City municipality was established in 1935 by royal decree.

==Climate==
Pattani has a tropical monsoon climate according to the Köppen climate classification, with a lengthy wet season and a brief dry season. The temperatures and humidity are high year round, with slightly higher temperatures in April, just as the monsoon arrives. The wet season is long, lasting May-December, and the dry season short, covering only January-April. The months of October, November, and December are particularly wet.

<doc id="489248" wikidata="Q596690" url="?curid=489248" title="Superdelegate">
<text>In American politics, a superdelegate is a delegate to a presidential nominating convention who is seated automatically. 

In Democratic National Conventions, superdelegates—described in formal party rules as the party leaders and elected official (PLEO) category—make up slightly under 15% of all convention delegates. Before 2018, Democratic superdelegates were free to support any candidate for the presidential nomination in all rounds of balloting. (This contrasts with pledged delegates, who were selected based on the party presidential primaries and caucuses in each U.S. state, in which voters choose among candidates for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination.) In 2018, the Democratic National Committee reduced the influence of superdelegates by barring them from voting on the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention, allowing them to vote only in a contested convention. In 2024, the Democratic National Committee voted to adopt new rules that allowed superdelegates to vote during the signature collection and on the first ballot of a virtual roll call for the presidential nomination, even without a candidate securing a majority of the convention&#x27;s delegates using only pledged delegates, which were earned by the candidate during the primary process. 

In Republican National Conventions, three Republican Party leaders of each state, territory, and Washington D.C. are automatically seated as delegates, but they are pledged to vote according to the results of their party branch&#x27;s presidential primaries at least on the first ballot.

==In Democratic National Conventions==
===Description of superdelegates===
Of all the delegates to the Democratic National Convention, slightly under 15% are superdelegates. According to the Pew Research Center, superdelegates are &quot;the embodiment of the institutional Democratic Party – everyone from former presidents, congressional leaders and big-money fundraisers to mayors, labor leaders and longtime local party functionaries.&quot; Democratic superdelegates are formally described (in Rule 9.A) as automatic (or unpledged) party leader and elected official (PLEO) delegates; each falls into one or more of the following categories based on other positions they hold: 

# Elected members of the Democratic National Committee. Elected DNC members include &quot;the chairs and vice chairs of each state and territorial Democratic Party; 212 national committeemen and committeewomen elected to represent their states; top officials of the DNC itself and several of its auxiliary groups (such as the Democratic Attorneys General Association, the National Federation of Democratic Women and the Young Democrats of America); and 75 at-large members who are nominated by the party chairman and chosen by the full DNC.&quot; Most at-large DNC members &quot;are local party leaders, officeholders and donors or representatives of important Democratic constituencies, such as organized labor.&quot; At the 2016 Democratic National Convention, there were 437 DNC members (with 433 votes) who were superdelegates.
# Democratic governors (including territorial governors and the mayor of the District of Columbia). There were 21 Democratic governors who were superdelegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.
# Democratic members of Congress. There were 191 U.S. representatives (including non-voting delegates from Washington, D.C., and territories) and 47 U.S. senators (including Washington, D.C., shadow senators) who were superdelegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.
# Any sitting Democratic president or vice president, if applicable. 
# Distinguished party leaders: consisting of all former Democratic presidents, vice presidents, congressional leaders (Democratic speakers of the U.S. House of Representatives, Democratic minority leaders of the House, and Democratic leaders of the Senate, and DNC chairs). There were 20 of these who were superdelegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

Because the number of superdelegates depends on the number of Democratic members of Congress and Democratic governors, the exact number of superdelegates may change during the primary season (ahead of the convention) due to officials&#x27; deaths, resignations, or special elections. 

Not all superdelegates attend the convention. For example, during his time in Congress, Democratic U.S. Representative Jim Matheson skipped every convention. Former Vice President Al Gore skipped the 2016 Convention.

====State residency====
Under party rules, automatic delegates shall &quot;legally reside in their respective state and ... shall be recognized as part of their state&#x27;s delegation&quot; (Rule 9.E). For example, in the 2008 convention, former Maine Governor Kenneth M. Curtis was a superdelegate (by virtue of his position as a past DNC chair), but because he had moved to Florida in 2006, he was counted as part of the Florida delegation, not the Maine delegation.

====Loss of superdelegate status====
Additionally, under party rules, automatic delegates are automatically disqualified if they have &quot;publicly expressed support for the election of, or has endorsed, a presidential candidate of another political party&quot; (Rule 9.E) and no delegate &quot;shall participate or vote in the nominating process for a Democratic presidential candidate who also participates in the nominating processes of any other party for the corresponding elections&quot; (Rule 2.E). Thus, a person who would otherwise qualify as a superdelegate loses his or her superdelegate status by endorsing another party&#x27;s presidential candidate. In 2008, Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut endorsed Republican John McCain, which, according to the chairwoman of the Connecticut Democratic Party, resulted in his disqualification as a superdelegate. Lieberman&#x27;s status had, however, previously been questioned because, although he was a registered Democratic voter and caucused with the Democrats, he won re-election as the candidate of the Connecticut for Lieberman Party and was listed as an &quot;Independent Democrat&quot; on the ballot. Lieberman did not attend the Democratic Convention; he was instead a speaker at the Republican Convention.

==== Comparison with pledged delegates ====
The remaining 85% of delegates are pledged to a candidate and chosen in primaries and caucuses. Unlike the Republican primary process (in which many states have a &quot;winner-take-all&quot; process, awarding all or most votes to the candidate who wins a plurality of the vote), Democrats follow a proportionality rule. All candidates who received at least 15% of the vote are awarded delegates in proportion to their share of the vote. Most pledged delegates are allotted based on candidates&#x27; proportions of the vote at the district level (these generally correspond to congressional districts, but in some states correspond to state senate districts or specially designated &quot;delegate districts&quot;). Additional delegates (the &quot;at-large&quot; delegates) are awarded to candidates based on statewide results. Finally, there are pledged &quot;party leader and elected official&quot; (PLEO) delegates. These are large city mayors, state legislative leaders, and county party officials who are pledged to a certain candidate; like the statewide at-large delegates, pledged PLEO delegates are allocated proportionally to presidential candidates based on the statewide primary or caucus vote. The district, at-large, and PLEO delegates collectively constitute a state or territory&#x27;s pledged delegation. 

Unlike superdelegates, who may support a candidate of their choice, pledged delegates generally must support the candidate to whom they are pledged. Since 1982, the party rules have stated that: &quot;Delegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.&quot; 

If a candidate who has earned pledged delegates drops out before the national convention, then that candidate&#x27;s delegates who were elected at the district level are released from their obligation to the dropped-out candidate. Pledged delegates who are allocated at the district level to a candidate who subsequently drops out of the race become &quot;free agents&quot;: they often support the candidate whom the dropped-out candidate endorses, but are not obligated to do so. By contrast, statewide pledged delegates are usually proportionally reallocated to candidates still in the race at the time when the states formally elect their delegates: this typically takes place at a statewide convention held after the primary or caucus, but before the national convention in mid-summer.

By contrast, many superdelegates choose to announce endorsements, but they are not bound to those preferences, and may support any candidate they wish, including a candidate who has dropped out of the presidential race.

===History ===
====Origins====
In the aftermath of the chaotic 1968 Democratic National Convention, the Democratic Party sought to shift the balance of power in the selection of the party&#x27;s presidential candidate to primary elections and caucuses, mandating that all delegates be chosen via mechanisms open to all party members; these rules were implemented following the recommendations of the McGovern-Fraser Commission. This increased grassroots control of Democratic conventions. However, after Democratic nominee George McGovern lost in a landslide to Richard Nixon in 1972, and after a decisive fight over the rules at the 1980 convention between supporters of Jimmy Carter and supporters of Edward M. Kennedy, followed by Carter&#x27;s defeat by Ronald Reagan in 1980, the party changed its nominating rules again.

A commission headed by North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt issued a report in 1982, on a 47–6 vote, to set aside 550 unpledged delegate seats held by party officials, to vote alongside the 3,300 Democratic pledged votes. This partial reversal of the trend toward grassroots control was supported by mainstream party leaders in Congress, as well as organized labor. It increases the power of the institutional party &quot;regulars&quot; against insurgent &quot;outsider&quot; maverick candidates. Their initial proposal to have superdelegates represent 30% of all delegates to the national convention was defeated in favor of a compromise proposal by Geraldine A. Ferraro, in which superdelegates made up about 14% of delegates. The proportion of superdelegates eventually expanded over time, reaching about 20% at the 2008 convention. 

====1984 and 1988====
In 1984, only state party chairs and vice chairs were guaranteed superdelegate status. The remaining spots were divided two ways. Democratic members of Congress were allowed to select up to 60% of their members to fill some of these spots. The remaining positions were left to the state parties to fill with priority given to governors and big-city mayors, led by Democrats and based on population. In the 1984 election, the major contenders for the presidential nomination were Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson, and Walter Mondale. Entering the final handful of primaries on June 5, Mondale was leading Hart in the delegate count, with Jackson far behind. The battle for delegates became more dramatic that night when Hart won three primaries, including the big prize of California in a cliffhanger. The Mondale campaign said, and some news reports agreed, that Mondale secured the needed 1,967 delegates to clinch the nomination that night in spite of losing California. But the Associated Press concluded he was &quot;barely short of the magic majority.&quot; Mondale wanted to make it indisputable that he had enough delegate votes, and his campaign set a deadline of one minute before noon; he made 50 calls in three hours to nail down an additional 40 superdelegates and declared at a press conference that he had 2,008 delegate votes. At the convention in July, Mondale won on the first ballot.

In 1988, this process was simplified. Democrats in Congress were now allowed to select up to 80% of their members. All Democratic National Committee members and all Democratic governors were given superdelegate status. This year also saw the addition of the &quot;distinguished party leader&quot; category (although former DNC chairs were not added to this category until 1996, and former House and Senate minority leaders were not added until 2000). In 1992 was the addition of a category of unpledged &quot;add-ons&quot;, a fixed number of spots allocated to the states, intended for other party leaders and elected officials not already covered by the previous categories. Finally, beginning in 1996, all Democratic members of Congress were given superdelegate status. The superdelegates have not always prevailed, however. Howard Dean took an early lead in delegate counts before the first primaries in the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries, but was later defeated by John Kerry, who won a succession of primaries and caucuses and, ultimately, the nomination. In 1988, a study found that delegates selected through the primary and caucus process were not substantively different from superdelegates in terms of issue viewpoints. However, superdelegates are more likely to prefer candidates with Washington experience than outsider candidates.

====2008 election====
At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, the superdelegates made up approximately one-fifth of the total number of delegates. The closeness of the race between the leading contenders, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, led to speculation that the superdelegates would play a decisive role in selecting the nominee, a prospect that caused unease among some Democratic Party leaders. Obama led in pledged delegates at the end of voting in the state contests while not winning enough to secure the nomination without the superdelegates. In May 2008, however, Obama took the lead in superdelegate endorsements for the first time; Clinton dropped out four days after Obama clinched the nomination.

Pledged delegates from state caucuses and primaries eventually numbered 3,573, casting 3,566 votes, resulting in a total number of delegate votes of 4,419. A candidate needed a majority of that total, or 2,209, to win the nomination. Superdelegates accounted for 19.6% of convention delegates, while delegates chosen in the Democratic caucuses and primaries accounted for approximately four-fifths (80.4%) of the Democratic convention delegates. At the convention, Obama won 3,188.5 delegate votes and Clinton won 1,010.5 with 1 abstention and 218 delegates not voting.

====2016 election====
In 2016, a campaign for superdelegates was a feature of the campaign between former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination; Sanders&#x27; campaigns and his supporters initially criticized the role of superdelegates, the majority of whom favored Clinton. Several mainstream media outlets included superdelegates in the candidate delegate totals during the primary elections although superdelegates do not vote until the convention and may change their minds on whom they are planning to vote for anytime before the convention. The DNC asked media outlets to not include superdelegate pledges in delegate totals, but many outlets, including the Associated Press, NBC, CBS, and Politico, continued to report total pledged delegates, lumping together superdelegates and pledged delegates. Sanders supporters objected to this practice, argued that it inflated Clinton&#x27;s lead and discouraged Sanders supporters.
Sanders initially said that the candidate with the majority of pledged delegates should be the nominee; in May 2016, after falling behind in the elected delegate count, he shifted, pushed for a contested convention and arguing that, &quot;The responsibility that superdelegates have is to decide what is best for this country and what is best for the Democratic Party.&quot; Ultimately, Clinton won the nomination without relying on the votes of superdelegates; she led Sanders by a substantial number of elected delegates (from primary and caucus votes), as well by a substantial margin in the popular vote. She became the presumptive nominee in early June 2016, after the California primary; at the time, Clinton had 1812 pledged delegates and 572 superdelegates, and Sanders had 1520 pledged delegates and 46 superdelegates. Sanders continued to campaign after the last Democratic primary, unsuccessfully seeking to persuade superdelegates to switch their allegiance to him; ultimately, he conceded the race and endorsed Clinton on July 12, 2016.

====Reform of superdelegates====
=====DNC Unity Reform Commission (2016–17)=====
On July 23, 2016, ahead of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, the 2016 DNC Rules Committee voted overwhelmingly (158–6) to adopt a superdelegate reform package. The new rules were the result of a compromise between the Hillary Clinton and the Bernie Sanders presidential campaigns; in the past, Sanders had pressed for the complete elimination of superdelegates.

Under the reform package, a 21-member unity commission, chaired by Clinton supporter Jennifer O&#x27;Malley Dillon and vice-chaired by Sanders supporter Larry Cohen, was appointed after the 2016 general election. The commission&#x27;s recommendations would be voted on at the next Democratic National Committee meeting, well before the beginning of the 2020 Democratic primaries. The commission was to consider &quot;a mix of Clinton and Sanders ideas&quot;: expanding the ability of eligible voters to participate in caucuses (an idea supported by Clinton) and expanding the ability of unaffiliated or new voters to join the Democratic Party and vote in Democratic primaries via same-day registration and re-registration (an idea supported by Sanders). The commission drew comparisons to the McGovern–Fraser Commission, which established party primary reforms before the 1972 Democratic National Convention.

By April 2017, the complete commission had been appointed. In accordance with the compromise agreement, the 21 members include, in addition to O&#x27;Malley Dillon and Cohen; nine members selected by Clinton, seven selected by Sanders, and three selected by the DNC chair (Tom Perez). By May 2017, the DNC Unity Reform Commission had begun to meet to begin drafting reforms, including superdelegate reform as well as primary calendar and caucus reform.

The commission met in the summer and fall of 2017. Different proposals on superdelegates were considered by the party. One proposal was to bind all or some superdelegates to the results of state primaries and caucuses. Whether to abolish superdelegates altogether remained controversial within the party. In December 2017, the Unity Commission&#x27;s recommendations were delivered to the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee. Perez and Deputy DNC Chair Keith Ellison co-authored an op-ed for CNN, announcing that the party would make a &quot;significant&quot; cut in the number of superdelegates who vote to decide on the presidential nominee. 

=====&quot;Adoption of superdelegate reform (2018)&quot;=====
Ultimately, the DNC decided to prevent superdelegates from voting on the first ballot, instead of reducing their numbers. On August 25, 2018, the DNC approved a plan to reduce the influence of superdelegates by barring them from voting on the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention, allowing them to vote only in a contested convention (&quot;i.e.&quot;, if a Democratic National Convention did not choose the nominee on the first ballot, because no candidate received an absolute majority [more than 50%] of the pledged delegates elected from the outcome of primaries and caucuses). This does not preclude superdelegates from publicly endorsing a candidate of their choosing before the convention.

The plan, which was endorsed by DNC chair Tom Perez, former DNC chair Howard Dean, and other party leaders, passed by an overwhelming margin; the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that the compromise was a &quot;rare mind meld between the Democratic establishment and progressive activists who have often chided the party&#x27;s elite.&quot; The only dissenter on the DNC Rules Committee was former DNC chairman Donald L. Fowler, who argued that the existing system worked.

====2020 election====
The first Democratic presidential primaries cycle under the new 2016–2018 superdelegate reform measures took place in 2020.

====2024 election====
The Democratic National Committee held a virtual nomination vote in the first week of August 2024 to select its nominee for president. The virtual nomination rules allowed superdelegates to vote for a presidential candidate during the first ballot of the virtual roll call even though no candidate secured an overwhelming majority of pledged delegates earned during the primaries.

=== Criticism and defenses===
The votes of superdelegates have never actually determined the Democratic nominee, although in 1984 they may have helped Walter Mondale win on the first ballot at the convention.
====Critics====
Critics have assailed superdelegates&#x27; role in Democratic National Conventions both before and after the 2017 reforms. Susan Estrich argued in 2008 that superdelegates have more power than other delegates because of their greater freedom to vote as they wish beginning with the first ballot. (Superdelegates&#x27; ability to vote on the first ballot was eliminated after the 2017 reform.) U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton&#x27;s former running mate, said in 2017 that he agreed with Bernie Sanders that superdelegates should be eliminated from the process: &quot;I have long believed there should be no superdelegates. These positions are given undue influence in the popular nominating contest and make the process less democratic.&quot; Prominent Democratic strategists Bob Shrum and Bill Carrick have also opposed superdelegates, and called for them to be dropped from the nominating process.

The role of superdelegates in the nominating process has also been criticized as unrepresentative. In 2007, &quot;Politico&quot; found that about half of the superdelegates were white men, compared to 28% of the Democratic primary electorate. Of the superdelegates at the 2016 Convention, 58% were male and 62% were non-Hispanic white (20% were black and 11% were Hispanic). The average age was about 60. There is no bar on lobbyists serving as DNC members (and thus superdelegates); ABC News found that about 9% of superdelegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention (67 people in all) were former or current lobbyists registered on the federal and state level.

====Defenders====
Author Jonathan Rauch and political scientist Ray La Raja argued in 2019 that the U.S. has given too much power to primary voters, and that this inflicts harms to democracy. They argue that &quot;the role of superdelegates in the Democratic nomination process could be strengthened instead of weakened&quot; and that this form of early vetting was positive, suggesting that this formal form of the &quot;invisible primary&quot; can be a positive force to counter-balance populism &quot;by restoring the Madisonian pillars of pluralism, checks on power, and deliberative institutions.&quot;

In February 2016, U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chair of the Democratic National Committee, defended the role of superdelegates in an interview with Jake Tapper, arguing that unpledged delegates ensure &quot;that party leaders and elected officials don&#x27;t have to be in a position where they are running against grass-roots activists&quot; and minimizes competition between the two groups.

==In Republican National Conventions==
In the Republican Party, as in the Democratic Party, members of the party&#x27;s national committee automatically become delegates. There are three Republican National Committee delegates (the national committeeman, national committeewoman, and party chair) for each state, territory, and Washington, D.C..

At the 2012 Republican National Convention, convention rules were amended to obligate unpledged RNC members (the &quot;superdelegates&quot;) to vote according to the result of the primaries held in their states. Pledged delegates selected by Republican primaries are assigned either on a proportional or a &quot;winner-take-all&quot; basis.

However, if a candidate does not win the party&#x27;s nomination on the first ballot (&quot;i.e.&quot;, by securing a majority—more than 50%), then some delegates become &quot;unbound&quot; free agents, depending on rules specific to state parties. For most states, delegates are &quot;unbound&quot; as soon as a first ballot concludes without a nominee being selected; for other states (including Texas) delegates are not unbound until a second ballot also fails to produce a majority for a candidate; and delegates from some other states (including Kansas and Alabama) remain bound to their candidate until the candidate releases them. These rules apply to both pledged delegates and superdelegates, meaning that superdelegates would play a role in selecting the nominee at a contested convention.

Superdelegates make up about 7% of all delegates to Republican national conventions. In the 2008 Republican National Convention, 123 RNC delegates among the 2,380 total delegates were not pledged to any candidate. In the 2016 Republican National Convention, 168 delegates among the 2,472 total delegates were &quot;super&quot; (unbound).

<text>A laser broom is a proposed ground-based laser beam-powered propulsion system that sweeps space debris out of the path of artificial satellites (such as the International Space Station) to prevent collateral damage to space equipment. It heats up one side of the debris to shift its orbit trajectory, altering the path to hit the atmosphere sooner. Space researchers have proposed that a laser broom may help mitigate Kessler syndrome, a runaway cascade of collision events between orbiting objects. Additionally, laser broom systems mounted on satellites or space station have also been proposed.

==Mechanism==

Lasers brooms are proposed to target space debris between in diameter. Collisions with these high-velocity debris not only cause considerable damage to the satellites but secondary fragmented debris from the collided satellite parts. A laser broom is intended to be used at a high power to penetrate through the atmosphere and ablate material from the targeted debris. The ablating material imparts a small thrust that lowers its orbital perigee towards the upper atmosphere, thereby increasing drag so that its remaining orbital life is cut short. The laser would operate in a pulsed fashion to avoid the target from self-shielding via its ablated plasma. The power levels of lasers in this concept are well below the power levels in concepts for more rapidly effective anti-satellite weapons.

Research into this field reveal the precise physical constraints required, noting the significant relevance to the space debris&#x27;s orientation and resultant trajectory of the ablated object. Using a laser guide star and adaptive optics, a sufficiently large ground-based laser (1 megajoule pulsed HF laser) can offset the orbits of dozens of debris daily at a reasonable cost.

==History==

The Space Shuttle routinely showed evidence of &quot;tiny&quot; impacts upon post-flight inspection.

&quot;Orion&quot; was a proposed ground-based laser broom project in the 1990s, estimated to cost $500 million.

A space-based laser also called &quot;Project Orion&quot; was planned to be installed on the International Space Station in 2003. In 2015, Japanese researchers proposed adding laser broom capabilities to the Extreme Universe Space Observatory telescope, to be launched to the ISS in 2017.

In 2014, the European CLEANSPACE project published a report studying a global architecture of debris tracking and removal laser stations.

<text>Baron Aldington, of Bispham in the County Borough of Blackpool, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 29 January 1962 for the Conservative politician and businessman, Sir Toby Low. On 16 November 1999 he was made a life peer as Baron Low, of Bispham in the County of Lancashire, as were all hereditary peers of the first creation following the House of Lords Act 1999. On his death in 2000 the life peerage became extinct while he was succeeded in the hereditary barony by his son Charles, the second and () present holder of the title.

Lord Aldington was controversially accused of sending 70,000 cossacks and their families who had surrendered to the British forces in Austria after the Second World War over the border to the Soviets. This highly secret act contravened the Geneva Convention as they were not citizens of the USSR, and it was obvious that they would be massacred or sent to GULAGs. The historian Nikolai Tolstoy said as much in print and was sued by Aldington in 1989 for defamation. In a highly controversial court case, Aldington won and Tolstoy was asked to pay £1.5m in damages and £0.5m for Aldington&#x27;s legal fees.

==Barons Aldington (1962)==
*Toby Austin Richard William Low, 1st Baron Aldington, Baron Low (1914–2000)
*Charles Harold Stuart Low, 2nd Baron Aldington (b. 1948)

The heir apparent and sole heir to the peerage is the present holder&#x27;s son, Philip Toby Augustus Low (b. 1990)

== Cameras ==
=== Rangefinder film cameras ===
Seiki Kogaku (now Canon) began to develop and subsequently to produce rangefinder cameras with the Kwanon prototype in 1933, based on the Leica II 35mm camera, with separate rangefinder and view finder systems (3 windows). Production began with the Hansa Canon on the Leica III format through World War II. Post war, Canon resumed production of pre-war designs in early 1946 with the JII viewfinder and the S1 rangefinder. But in late 1946 they introduced the SII which departed from the Leica design by offering a combined viewfinder/rangefinder system, reducing the windows on the front of the camera to two. However, in most other respects these cameras remained visually similar to the Leica III.

* Kwanon (1933) Nippon Kogaku (now Nikon) provided Seiki Kogaku with funding, Nikkor lenses, rangefinders, and technical assistance
* Canon (1936) Known today as the &quot;Original Canon&quot; The viewfinder moved to the top of the camera, differing from the Leica
* Hansa Canon (1936) Omiya Trading Co marketed original Canon with the Hansa name above the Canon name on the top
* Canon S (1939) Standard model. The word &quot;Hansa&quot; disappeared from the brand name, and was replaced with just &quot;Canon&quot; 
* Canon NS (1939) New Standard. A Canon S without the slow shutter speeds
* Canon J (1939) J stands for Junior a non-rangefinder model.
* Canon J II (1946) Similar if not the same as prewar cameras
* Canon S (1946) Similar if not the same as prewar cameras
* Canon S II (1946) A redesign with combined range finder and viewfinder functions – two windows
* Canon II B (1949)
* Canon II C (1950)
* Canon III (1951)
* Canon IV (1951)
* Canon III A (1951)
* Canon IV S (1952)
* Canon II A (1952)
* Canon II D (1952)
* Canon IV SB (1952)
* Canon II AF (1953)
* Canon II F (1953)
* Canon II AX (1953)
* Canon II S (1954)
* Canon IV Sb2 (1954)
* Canon II S2 (1955)
* Canon II D2 (1955)
* Canon II F2 (1955)

In 1956, Canon departed from the Leica II Style and developed a more contemporary look, along with a Contax style self-timer level to the left of the lens mount. This was the first Canon camera with a swing-open camera back for film loading. Upper end models had a new three-mode viewfinders and winding triggers.

* Canonet (1961) Lower priced simpler camera
* Canon 7 (1961) Including a built-in meter and improved viewfinder system.

Canon partnered with US manufacturer Bell &amp; Howell between 1961–1976 and a few Canon products were sold in the US under the Bell &amp; Howell brand e.g. Canon 7 Rangefinder, Canon EX-EE, and the Canon TX.

=== SLR cameras ===

==== Canonflex SLR ====
Canon developed and produced the Canon R lens mount for film SLR cameras in 1959. The FL lens mount replaced R-mounts in 1964.
* Canonflex (1959) – Planned as Canon&#x27;s first professional-class SLR camera body, but it was not successful. Available with builtin motor-drive option (not detachable).
* Canonflex R2000 (1960) – An upgrade with 1/2000 shutter speed (up from 1/1000)
* Canonflex RP (1960) – simplified Canonflex without the interchangeable prism/viewer
* Canonflex RM (1962) – A redesign of the RP with builtin metering and a lower profile prism. Offered with an f/1.2 58mm lens option

Details 

==== FL-mount SLR ====
Canon developed and produced the Canon FL lens-mount standard for film SLR cameras from 1964 to replace the Canon R lens-mount standard. The FD lens mount standard replaced FL-mounts in 1971.
* Canon FX (1964)
* Canon FP (1964)
* Canon Pellix (1965)
* Canon FT QL (1966)
* Canon Pellix QL (1966)
* Canon TL (1968)

==== EE-mount SLR ====
In 1969 Canon introduced an economy camera/lens system where the rear three elements (in two groups) were built-on-to the camera, and several front element options could be interchanged. This had been used by Zeiss-Ikon in their mid-level cameras of their Contaflex series, and by Kodak in early interchangeable lenses for the top-end Retina series (later going to full lenses). Canon offered four lens options: 35mm f/3.5, 50mm f/1.8, 95mm f/3.5, and 125mm f/3.5.

Through the lens metering was center weighted and automatic exposure was shutter speed priority. Only two cameras were offered and the line was not successful.

* Canon EXEE (1969)
* Canon EX Auto (1972) improved auto flash features

==== FD-mount SLR ====
Canon developed and produced the Canon FD lens mount standard for film SLR cameras from 1971 to replace the FL lens mount standard.
The FD mount had two variants – original lenses used a breechlock collar to mount whilst later versions used a standard bayonet twist lock with a short twist action.
The EF lens mount standard superseded FD-mounts in 1987. Canon ceased to produce FD-mount cameras in 1994.

===== F series =====
* Canon F-1 (1971) – Reputed as Canon&#x27;s first successful professional-class SLR camera body. The 1959 Canonflex professional camera system (above) failed and was down-featured for the consumer market.

==== EOS ====
In 1987, Canon introduced the EOS Single-lens reflex camera system along with the EF lens-mount standard to replace the 16-year-old FD lens-mount standard; EOS became the sole SLR camera-system used by Canon . Canon also used EOS for its digital SLR cameras. All current film and digital SLR cameras produced by Canon use the EOS autofocus system. Canon introduced this system in 1987 along with the EF lens mount standard. The last non-EOS based SLR camera produced by Canon, the Canon T90 of 1986, is widely regarded as the template for the EOS line of camera bodies, although the T90 employed the older FD lens-mount standard.

=== PIXMA series ===
Since about 2005 Canon introduced a numbering scheme for some whereby the least significant (non-zero) digit signifies the geographic region (&quot;3&quot; signifying Japan) the device is sold in. This leads to a large number of models, all belonging to the same family, but possibly incompatible to some degree, and also makes it difficult to ascertain whether a device is unique or part of an existing family. The software driver filename will often use the family designation.

Some MP devices have fax capability (MP740).

== Lenses ==
=== EF and EF-S line ===
&quot;See Canon EF lenses for the product line-up&quot;.
&quot;See Canon EF-S lenses for the product line-up&quot;.

EF-S lenses are built for APS-C 1.6x crop sensors, so they only work with models that use this sensor size. When EF-S lenses are used on a 35mm (full frame) camera the back element will hit the mirror assembly or cause substantial vignetting since the sensor is bigger than the image produced by the lens.

=== FD line ===
&quot;See Canon FD lenses for the product line-up&quot;.

First elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1905 election, Ferguson served as Minister of Lands, Forest, and Mines in the government of William Howard Hearst from 1914 to 1919. Ferguson approved the reservation of of pulpwood on crown land to the Mead Corporation, and a further to Abitibi Power and Paper Company although the &quot;Crown Timber Act&quot; required pulp limits to be sold by public tender. He declared, &quot;My ambition has been to see the largest paper industry in the world established in the Province, and my attitude towards the pulp and paper industry has been directed towards assisting in bringing this about.&quot; After becoming Premier of Ontario in 1923, Ferguson reserved a further to Abitibi.

In addition, he sold timber limits to the Shevlin-Clarke Lumber Company (headed by the fellow Conservative James Arthur Mathieu) for less than half the price they would have normally fetched, and the company later paid a fine of $1.5 million for breaching the &quot;Crown Timber Act&quot;. The transactions were criticized in a subsequent inquiry, in which the commission reported:

Ferguson became leader of the Conservative Party upon the defeat of the Hearst government that year.

==Premiership==
In the 1923 election, the Ontario Conservative Party came to power under Ferguson&#x27;s leadership by defeating the United Farmers of Ontario-Labour coalition government of Ernest C. Drury. The Conservatives won 75 of the 111 seats in the legislature. Ferguson&#x27;s government encouraged private investment in industry and the development of the province&#x27;s natural resources as a means of achieving prosperity. It was re-elected in the 1926 election with 72 seats and in 1929 with 90 seats.

===French policy===

In 1911, Ferguson argued in the legislature that &quot;no language other than English should be used as a medium of instruction in the schools of this Province&quot; although that a significant proportion of the population was French-Canadian. Sectarian politics was still rife in Ontario, and the Conservatives relied on a base of Orange support. Ferguson was prepared to pander to the Orangemen with anti-Catholic and anti-French rhetoric.

In 1912, the Ontario government passed Regulation 17, which greatly restricted the use of French language instruction. The legislation outraged Quebec and was an irritant to national unity during the First World War. When Ferguson became premier, he reversed himself by moderating the legislation and allowing more French-language instruction. His government, however, refused to extend funding for the Catholic separate schools past Grade 8.

Ferguson&#x27;s reversal on Regulation 17 was a concession needed for his alliance with Quebec Premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau. Ferguson and Taschereau formed an axis against the federal government to demand more provincial rights and defend the provinces&#x27; ownership of natural resources such as water power (hydro-electric generation).

===Liquor policy===
The Ferguson government, eager for new tax revenue, held a plebiscite in 1924 to soften the province&#x27;s temperance laws. A slim majority voted against prohibition, which led Ferguson&#x27;s government to permit the sale of beer with an alcohol content of no more than 4.4 proof, about 2.2%. Such brew became known as Fergie&#x27;s foam.

The 1926 provincial election was fought on the issue of the government&#x27;s proposal to repeal the &quot;Ontario Temperance Act&quot; and to permit controlled sales of liquor in government-owned stores. Attorney-General William Folger Nickle, who had supported the government&#x27;s earlier decision to allow the sale of low-alcohol beer, was opposed to going any further softening of temperance laws and resigned from Cabinet to run against the government as a Prohibitionist candidate against the repeal of the law. Ferguson&#x27;s Conservatives were re-elected with a slightly reduced majority.

In 1927, the government introduced legislation to establish the Liquor Control Board of Ontario and to allow the sale of alcohol by government-owned and operated liquor stores. That moderate stance on temperance allowed the government to isolate the Liberals, who until 1930 took a hard prohibitionist stance by opposing even regulated liquor sales and so alienated all but the most hardline temperance advocates.

===Other issues===
The Tories remained hostile to labour and immigrants and were not prepared to provide social relief when the Great Depression threw thousands out of work and into poverty. The Ferguson government also opposed federal government plans for an old-age pension.

== Posthumous Honours ==
In September of 1949, the Kemptville Nursery located in Ferguson&#x27;s home town of Kemptville was renamed to the Ferguson Forest Center in honour of Ferguson.

==Later life==
In December 1930, Ferguson left provincial politics to accept an appointment as Canadian High Commissioner in London. He was succeeded as party leader and premier by George Stewart Henry.

From 1945 to 1946, he served as Chancellor of the University of Western Ontario.

He also gave his name to the Ferguson Block, a government office building at Queen&#x27;s Park in Toronto as well as the residence cafeteria at University College in the University of Toronto, which is called the Howard Ferguson Dining Hall. A University College scholarship is named after him.

Ferguson died on February 21, 1946, in Toronto.

<text>The Karawanks or Karavankas or Karavanks (; , ) are a mountain range of the Southern Limestone Alps on the border between Slovenia to the south and Austria to the north. With a total length of in an east–west direction, the Karawanks chain is one of the longest ranges in Europe. It is traversed by important trade routes and has a great tourist significance. Geographically and geologically, it is divided into the higher Western Karawanks and the lower-lying Eastern Karawanks. It is traversed by the Periadriatic Seam, separating the Apulian tectonic plate from the Eurasian Plate.

Near the summit of the Dreiländereck (1,508 m) is the tripoint of the three countries: Austria, Italy and Slovenia.

==Geography==

The Karawanks form the continuation of the Carnic Alps east of the Slizza stream near the tripoint of Austria, Slovenia and Italy at Arnoldstein. They are confined by the Drava Valley in the north (called &quot;Rosental/Rož&quot;) and the Sava in the south, separating it from the adjacent Julian Alps. In the east, they border on the Kamnik–Savinja Alps and Pohorje ranges.

A number of mountain passes on important trade routes cross the range, like Wurzen (&quot;Koreno&quot;), Loibl (&quot;Ljubelj&quot;) or Seeberg (&quot;Jezero&quot;), which have been used since prehistory. Nowadays the Austrian Karawanken Autobahn (A11) runs from Villach to the Karavanke motorway tunnel, which traverses the Western Karawanks connecting it with the Slovenian A2 motorway at Jesenice. A parallel railway line crosses the range through the Karawanks railway tunnel.

The Karawanks are a popular mountaineering area with numerous mountain huts. Many of the peaks offer a good view of the Klagenfurt basin on the Austrian side and the Ljubljana basin on the Slovene side. The northern Austrian side is rocky and precipitous while the Slovenian side is less steep, covered with spruce forests and low bushy pine at lower elevations with grass higher up.

==History==

The Karawanks were settled already in the Stone Age, as indicated particularly by findings from Potok Cave. In Roman times, they represented the southern border of the Noricum province, and later, of the Slavic principality of Carantania. The ancient geographer Claudius Ptolemy mentioned the &quot;Karwankas&quot; mountains about 150 AD. The name probably is derived from Celtic &quot;karv&quot; &#x27;deer&#x27;, a connection that has survived in the &quot;Košuta&quot; (Slovene for &#x27;hind&#x27;) massif.

From the first half of the 11th century, the Karawanks formed the border between the territory of the Duchy of Carinthia and the adjacent March of Carniola in the south. After Carniola had been elevated to a duchy in 1364, both lands became part of Inner Austria and were crown lands of the Habsburg monarchy from 1526 up to World War I. The northern slopes of the Karawanks had been historically settled by Carinthian Slovenes, nevertheless in October 1920, the Carinthian Plebiscite decided that the crest was the border between the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia); only the municipality of Jezersko had already passed from Carinthia to Yugoslavia.

In the final weeks of the Second World War the Karawanks passes witnessed intense fighting. The 24th SS &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; (battlegroup) commanded by SS-&quot;Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen&quot;-SS (Brigadier) Heinz Harmel was ordered to keep the Karawanken passes open between Yugoslavia and Austria. This task was critical in allowing German forces to withdraw from Yugoslavia in order to surrender to British rather than Yugoslav forces. The &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; succeeded in its final task, and was one of the last German units to surrender, when it encountered the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945.

After World War II the Karawanks remained the border between Austria and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and finally the independent Slovenia from 1991. Since the entry of Slovenia to the Schengen Area in 2007, a free movement of people and goods across the Karawanks has been allowed, and the two countries started to aim for an economic integration of their border areas.

==Notable peaks==

The place names have German as well as Slovenian names, and today the peaks along the main chain of the Karawanks are usually displayed in Slovene and German on hiking maps:

<text>Hiram Cronk (April 19, 1800 – May 13, 1905) was the last surviving U.S. veteran of the War of 1812.

==Early life and military service==
Hiram Cronk was born in Frankfort, New York, on April 19, 1800. He was mustered into federal service as a private in Captain Edmund Fuller&#x27;s Company (detached from the New York Militia) on October 8, 1814. Having served five weeks in defense of Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, he was mustered out on November 16, 1814. 
The Cronk family was of Dutch descent.

==Later life and death==

Cronk spent most of his life working as a shoemaker. For his wartime service, he received a pension of $12 per month. In 1903, Congress increased it to $25 per month. He also received a special pension of $72 per month from the State of New York. He died in Dunn Brook, Oneida County, New York, on May 13, 1905, at the age of 105.

After his death, Cronk&#x27;s body was displayed in the main lobby of New York City Hall. An estimated 925,000 people paid their respects. He is interred in the Mount of Victory, Cypress Hills National Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York.

<doc id="489273" wikidata="Q713084" url="?curid=489273" title="Artinian ring">
<text>In mathematics, specifically abstract algebra, an Artinian ring (sometimes Artin ring) is a ring that satisfies the descending chain condition on (one-sided) ideals; that is, there is no infinite descending sequence of ideals. Artinian rings are named after Emil Artin, who first discovered that the descending chain condition for ideals simultaneously generalizes finite rings and rings that are finite-dimensional vector spaces over fields. The definition of Artinian rings may be restated by interchanging the descending chain condition with an equivalent notion: the minimum condition.

Precisely, a ring is left Artinian if it satisfies the descending chain condition on left ideals, right Artinian if it satisfies the descending chain condition on right ideals, and Artinian or two-sided Artinian if it is both left and right Artinian. For commutative rings the left and right definitions coincide, but in general they are distinct from each other.

The Wedderburn–Artin theorem characterizes every simple Artinian ring as a ring of matrices over a division ring. This implies that a simple ring is left Artinian if and only if it is right Artinian.

The same definition and terminology can be applied to modules, with ideals replaced by submodules.

Although the descending chain condition appears dual to the ascending chain condition, in rings it is in fact the stronger condition. Specifically, a consequence of the Akizuki–Hopkins–Levitzki theorem is that a left (resp. right) Artinian ring is automatically a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring. This is not true for general modules; that is, an Artinian module need not be a Noetherian module.

== Examples and counterexamples ==
* An integral domain is Artinian if and only if it is a field.
* A ring with finitely many, say left, ideals is left Artinian. In particular, a finite ring (e.g., formula_1) is left and right Artinian.
* Let &quot;k&quot; be a field. Then formula_2 is Artinian for every positive integer &quot;n&quot;.
* Similarly, formula_3 is an Artinian ring with maximal ideal formula_4.
* Let formula_5 be an endomorphism between a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot;. Then the subalgebra formula_6 generated by formula_5 is a commutative Artinian ring.
* If &quot;I&quot; is a nonzero ideal of a Dedekind domain &quot;A&quot;, then formula_8 is a principal Artinian ring.
* For each formula_9, the full matrix ring formula_10 over a left Artinian (resp. left Noetherian) ring &quot;R&quot; is left Artinian (resp. left Noetherian).

The following two are examples of non-Artinian rings.
* If &quot;R&quot; is any ring, then the polynomial ring &quot;R&quot;[&quot;x&quot;] is not Artinian, since the ideal generated by formula_11 is (properly) contained in the ideal generated by formula_12 for all natural numbers &quot;n&quot;. In contrast, if &quot;R&quot; is Noetherian so is &quot;R&quot;[&quot;x&quot;] by the Hilbert basis theorem.
* The ring of integers formula_13 is a Noetherian ring but is not Artinian.

== Modules over Artinian rings ==
Let &quot;M&quot; be a left module over a left Artinian ring. Then the following are equivalent (Hopkins&#x27; theorem): (i) &quot;M&quot; is finitely generated, (ii) &quot;M&quot; has finite length (i.e., has composition series), (iii) &quot;M&quot; is Noetherian, (iv) &quot;M&quot; is Artinian.

== Commutative Artinian rings ==
Let &quot;A&quot; be a commutative Noetherian ring with unity. Then the following are equivalent.
* &quot;A&quot; is Artinian.
* &quot;A&quot; is a finite product of commutative Artinian local rings.
* is a semisimple ring, where nil(&quot;A&quot;) is the nilradical of &quot;A&quot;.
* Every finitely generated module over &quot;A&quot; has finite length. (see above)
* &quot;A&quot; has Krull dimension zero. (In particular, the nilradical is the Jacobson radical since prime ideals are maximal.)
* formula_14 is finite and discrete.
* formula_14 is discrete.

Let &quot;k&quot; be a field and &quot;A&quot; finitely generated &quot;k&quot;-algebra. Then &quot;A&quot; is Artinian if and only if &quot;A&quot; is finitely generated as &quot;k&quot;-module.

An Artinian local ring is complete. A quotient and localization of an Artinian ring is Artinian.

== Simple Artinian ring ==
One version of the Wedderburn–Artin theorem states that a simple Artinian ring &quot;A&quot; is a matrix ring over a division ring. Indeed, let &quot;I&quot; be a minimal (nonzero) right ideal of &quot;A&quot;, which exists since &quot;A&quot; is Artinian (and the rest of the proof does not use the fact that &quot;A&quot; is Artinian). Then, since formula_16 is a two-sided ideal, formula_17 since &quot;A&quot; is simple. Thus, we can choose formula_18 so that formula_19. Assume &quot;k&quot; is minimal with respect that property. Consider the map of right &quot;A&quot;-modules:
: formula_20

It is surjective. If it is not injective, then, say, formula_21 with nonzero formula_22. Then, by the minimality of &quot;I&quot;, we have: formula_23. It follows:
: formula_24,
which contradicts the minimality of &quot;k&quot;. Hence, formula_25 and thus formula_26.

<text>George Stewart Henry (July 16, 1871 – September 2, 1958) was a farmer, businessman and politician in Ontario, Canada. He served as the tenth premier of Ontario from 1930 to 1934. He had acted as minister of highways while Ontario greatly expanded its highway system. Henry continued the expansion as premier, but his party did not provide relief during the Great Depression and lost the 1934 election.

==Background==
Henry was born in Township of King, York County, Ontario, the son of William and Louisa Henry (née Stewart).

He attended Upper Canada College for high school and moved on to the University of Toronto, where he received a Bachelor of Arts. He earned his LL.B. at Osgoode Hall Law School. He also spent a year at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph and decided to become a farmer in East York, Ontario.

He was a member of York Township Council from 1903 to 1910, was Township reeve from 1906 to 1910, and elected warden of York County in 1909.

==Political career==

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1913 as a Conservative in the riding of York East. In 1918, he was appointed as Minister of Agriculture. In 1920, he ran for the leadership of the provincial Conservatives at that party&#x27;s first-ever leadership convention but lost to Howard Ferguson who led the party to victory in the subsequent general election. From 1923 to 1930, Henry served as Minister of Highways in the Ferguson government and expanded on the highway system that was initiated by the previous government of Ernest C. Drury. When Ferguson stepped down in 1930, barely a year into the Great Depression, Henry succeeded him as Conservative Party leader and as Premier of Ontario. Henry continued his programme of building roads and extended Ontario&#x27;s highway system from to .

Construction of Canada&#x27;s first four-lane controlled access superhighway, the Toronto to Niagara Falls Queen Elizabeth Way, was the most lasting achievement of the highway program.

Henry was opposed to government intervention to deal with the economy. Aside from building roads, his government did little to alleviate public suffering during the Great Depression, such as unemployment in the cities, or the collapse of prices for farm products in the country. Henry&#x27;s government, like the federal government of RB Bennett, established work camps for jobless men. They were established not so much to provide social welfare but rather as social control: to evacuate the potentially radical element from the cities. The work camps also provided a source of labour for the construction of Henry&#x27;s highway system.

In the 1934 election, Henry sought a new mandate from the voters in his first election as Premier. Some felt that the government had little to offer beyond more road construction, and the Tories were soundly defeated by the Ontario Liberal Party, led by Mitchell Hepburn. He became the Leader of the Opposition from 1934 to 1936, when he retired as the Conservative leader.

==Henry Farm==
In 1898, Henry bought the farm house and property in which he would spend almost all of his adult life after he had graduated from the Ontario Agricultural College. The &quot;Mulholland Homestead&quot; had been settled by his great-grandfather Henry Mulholland, who sold it in the early 19th century.

The farm was located in what was then known as Todmorden, and contained . He sold it in 1958 for approximately million to a British construction firm that was planning on building a housing division. He died ten days after he had completed the sale, on September 2, 1958. It became a suburban housing subdivision in the 1960s, Henry Farm, in City of North York, which is now part of the amalgamated City of Toronto.

A public high school near his former homestead was named after him, George S. Henry Academy.

<text>The Kamnik–Savinja Alps () are a mountain range of the Southern Limestone Alps. They lie in northern Slovenia, except for the northernmost part, which lies in Austria.

The western part of the range was named the Kamnik Alps () in 1778 by the scientists Belsazar Hacquet and Franz Xaver von Wulfen, after the town of Kamnik (&quot;Stein&quot;) in the valley of the Kamnik Bistrica River. Its eastern part was named the Savinja Alps (&quot;Sanntaler Alpen&quot;) or Solčava Alps (&quot;Sulzbacher Alpen&quot;) by the mountaineer Johannes von Frischauf in 1875, after the settlement of Solčava (&quot;Sulzbach&quot;) and the main river, the upper Savinja (&quot;Sann&quot;).

==Geography==
The Kamnik–Savinja Alps are located south of the Karawanks range at the border of Austria and Slovenia, stretching from the Sava River in the west to the Savinja in the east, where the adjacent Slovenian Prealps with the Pohorje range, the Celje Hills at the Dravinja River, as well as the Sava Hills are located. In the northwest, the valley of Vellach Creek (at ) leading to Bad Vellach is the southernmost point of both the Austrian state of Carinthia and Austria as a whole.

The entire main chain is today part of Slovenia. Historically it formed the border between the Inner Austrian duchies of Carinthia, Styria, and Carniola. The tripoint was located at the Carinthia Mount Rinka ().

There is also a small glacier below Mount Skuta, which is the easternmost glacier in the Southern Alps.

==Mountains and passes==
The most important peaks are:
* Grintovec – 
* Kočna – 
* Skuta – 
* Carinthia Mount Rinka – 
* Planjava – 
* Ojstrica – 
* Brana – 
* Kalce Ridge – 
* Cold Mountain – 
* Storžič – 
* Krofička – 

In total, 28 peaks surpass 2,000 m. The total area of the Slovene part is about 900 km2. About three-quarters of the area is covered with forest, and many of the higher peaks are bleak and rocky.

The most important passes are the Seebergsattel () between Austrian Carinthia and Slovenia&#x27;s Municipality of Jezersko, as well as the Pavlič Pass. On the Slovenian side, there is a skiing area, whereas tourism in the Vellach Valley focuses on health spas.

<doc id="489289" wikidata="Q1069641" url="?curid=489289" title="Chemoreceptor">
<text>A chemoreceptor, also known as chemosensor, is a specialized sensory receptor which transduces a chemical substance (endogenous or induced) to generate a biological signal. This signal may be in the form of an action potential, if the chemoreceptor is a neuron, or in the form of a neurotransmitter that can activate a nerve fiber if the chemoreceptor is a specialized cell, such as taste receptors, or an internal peripheral chemoreceptor, such as the carotid bodies. In physiology, a chemoreceptor detects changes in the normal environment, such as an increase in blood levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) or a decrease in blood levels of oxygen (hypoxia), and transmits that information to the central nervous system which engages body responses to restore homeostasis.

In bacteria, chemoreceptors are essential in the mediation of chemotaxis.

==Cellular chemoreceptors==

===In prokaryotes===
Bacteria utilize complex long helical proteins as chemoreceptors, permitting signals to travel long distances across the cell&#x27;s membrane. Chemoreceptors allow bacteria to react to chemical stimuli in their environment and regulate their movement accordingly. In archaea, transmembrane receptors comprise only 57% of chemoreceptors, while in bacteria the percentage rises to 87%. This is an indicator that chemoreceptors play a heightened role in the sensing of cytosolic signals in archaea.

===In eukaryotes===
Primary cilia, present in many types of mammalian cells, serve as &quot;cellular antennae&quot;. The motile function of these cilia is lost in favour of their sensory specialization.

==Plant chemoreceptors==

Plants have various mechanisms to perceive danger in their environment. Plants are able to detect pathogens and microbes through surface level receptor kinases (PRK). Additionally, receptor-like proteins (RLPs) containing ligand binding receptor domains capture pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) which consequently initiates the plant&#x27;s innate immunity for a defense response.

Plant receptor kinases are also used for growth and hormone induction among other important biochemical processes. These reactions are triggered by a series of signaling pathways which are initiated by plant chemically sensitive receptors. Plant hormone receptors can either be integrated in plant cells or situate outside the cell, in order to facilitate chemical structure and composition. There are 5 major categories of hormones that are unique to plants which once bound to the receptor, will trigger a response in target cells. These include auxin, abscisic acid, gibberellin, cytokinin, and ethylene. Once bound, hormones can induce, inhibit, or maintain function of the target response.

== Classes ==
There are two main classes of chemoreceptor: direct and distance. 
* Examples of &quot;distance chemoreceptors&quot; are:
**olfactory receptor neurons in the olfactory system: Olfaction involves the ability to detect chemicals in the gaseous state. In vertebrates, the olfactory system detects odors and pheromones in the nasal cavity. Within the olfactory system there are two anatomically distinct organs: the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and the vomeronasal organ (VNO). It was initially thought that the MOE is responsible for the detection of odorants, while the VNO detects pheromones. The current view, however, is that both systems can detect odorants and pheromones. Olfaction in invertebrates differs from olfaction in vertebrates. For example, in insects, olfactory sensilla are present on their antennae.
* Examples of &quot;direct chemoreceptors&quot; include: 
** Taste receptors in the gustatory system: The primary use of gustation as a type of chemoreception is for the detection of tasteants. Aqueous chemical compounds come into contact with chemoreceptors in the mouth, such as taste buds on the tongue, and trigger responses. These chemical compounds can either trigger an appetitive response for nutrients, or a defensive response against toxins depending on which receptors fire. Fish and crustaceans, who are constantly in an aqueous environment, use their gustatory system to identify certain chemicals in the mixture for the purpose of localization and ingestion of food. 
**Insects use contact chemoreception to recognize certain chemicals such as cuticular hydrocarbons and chemicals specific to host plants. Contact chemoreception is more commonly seen in insects but is also involved in the mating behavior of some vertebrates. The contact chemoreceptor is specific to one type of chemical.

== Sensory organs ==
*Olfaction: In terrestrial vertebrates, olfaction occurs in the nose. Volatile chemical stimuli enter the nose and eventually reach the olfactory epithelium which houses the chemoreceptor cells known as olfactory sensory neurons often referred to as OSNs. Embedded in the olfactory epithelium are three types of cells: supporting cells, basal cells, and OSNs. While all three types of cells are integral to normal function of the epithelium, only OSN serve as receptor cells, i.e. responding to the chemicals and generating an action potential that travels down the olfactory nerve to reach the brain. In insects, antennae act as distance chemoreceptors. For example, antennae on moths are made up of long feathery hairs that increase sensory surface area. Each long hair from the main antenna also has smaller sensilla that are used for volatile olfaction. Since moths are mainly nocturnal animals, the development of greater olfaction aids them in navigating the night.
*Gustation: In many terrestrial vertebrates, the tongue serves as the primary gustatory sensory organ. As a muscle located in the mouth, it acts to manipulate and discern the composition of food in the initial stages of digestion. The tongue is rich in vasculature, allowing the chemoreceptors located on the top surface of the organ to transmit sensory information to the brain. Salivary glands in the mouth allow for molecules to reach chemoreceptors in an aqueous solution. The chemoreceptors of the tongue fall into two distinct superfamilies of G protein-coupled receptors. GPCR&#x27;s are intramembrane proteins than bind to an extracellular ligand- in this case chemicals from food- and begin a diverse array of signaling cascades that can result in an action potential registering as input in an organism&#x27;s brain. Large quantities of chemoreceptors with discrete ligand-binding domains provide for the five basic tastes: sour, salty, bitter, sweet, and savory. The salty and sour tastes work directly through the ion channels, the sweet and bitter taste work through G protein-coupled receptors, and the savory sensation is activated by glutamate.Gustatory chemosensors are not just present on the tongue but also on different cells of the gut epithelium where they communicates the sensory information to several effector systems involved in the regulation of appetite, immune responses, and gastrointestinal motility.
*Contact Chemoreception: Contact chemoreception is dependent on the physical contact of the receptor with the stimulus. The receptors are short hairs or cones that have a single pore at, or close to the tip of the projection. They are known as uniporous receptors. Some receptors are flexible, while others are rigid and do not bend with contact. They are mostly found in the mouthparts, but can also occur on the antennae or legs of some insects. There is a collection of dendrites located near the pores of the receptors, yet the distribution of these dendrites changes depending on the organism being examined. The method of transduction of the signal from the dendrites differs depending on the organism and the chemical it is responding to.

When inputs from the environment are significant to the survival of the organism, the input must be detected. As all life processes are ultimately based on chemistry it is natural that detection and passing on of the external input will involve chemical events. The chemistry of the environment is, of course, relevant to survival, and detection of chemical input from the outside may well articulate directly with cell chemicals.

Chemoreception is important for the detection of food, habitat, conspecifics including mates, and predators. For example, the emissions of a predator&#x27;s food source, such as odors or pheromones, may be in the air or on a surface where the food source has been. Cells in the head, usually the air passages or mouth, have chemical receptors on their surface that change when in contact with the emissions. It passes in either chemical or electrochemical form to the central processor, the brain or spinal cord. The resulting output from the CNS (central nervous system) makes body actions that will engage the food and enhance survival.

==Physiology==

* Carotid bodies and aortic bodies detect changes primarily in pCO2 and H+ ion concentration. They also sense decrease in partial pressure of O2, but to a lesser degree than for pCO2 and H+ ion concentration.
* The chemoreceptor trigger zone is an area of the medulla in the brain that receives inputs from blood-borne drugs or hormones, and communicates with the vomiting center (area postrema) to induce vomiting.
* Primary cilia play important roles in chemosensation. In adult tissues, these cilia regulate cell proliferation in response to external stimuli, such as tissue damage. In humans, improper functioning of primary cilia is associated with important diseases known as ciliopathies.

===Control of breathing===
Particular chemoreceptors, called ASICs, detect the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. To do this, they monitor the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood, which decrease the pH of the blood. This can be a direct consequence of an increase in carbon dioxide concentration, because aqueous carbon dioxide in the presence of carbonic anhydrase reacts to form a proton and a bicarbonate ion.

The response is that the respiratory centre (in the medulla), sends nervous impulses to the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm, via the intercostal nerve and the phrenic nerve, respectively, to increase breathing rate and the volume of the lungs during inhalation.

Chemoreceptors that regulate the depth and rhythm of breathing are broken down into two categories.

* central chemoreceptors are located on the ventrolateral surface of medulla oblongata and detect changes in pH of cerebrospinal fluid. They have also been shown experimentally to respond to hypercapnic hypoxia (elevated , decreased O2), and eventually desensitize, partly due to redistribution of bicarbonate out of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and increased renal excretion of bicarbonate. These are sensitive to pH and .
* peripheral chemoreceptors: consists of aortic and carotid bodies. Aortic body detects changes in blood oxygen and carbon dioxide, but not pH, while carotid body detects all three. They do not desensitize. Their effect on breathing rate is less than that of the central chemoreceptors.

=== Heart rate ===
The response to stimulation of chemoreceptors on the heart rate is complicated. Chemoreceptors in the heart or nearby large arteries, as well as chemoreceptors in the lungs, can affect heart rate. Activation of these peripheral chemoreceptors from sensing decreased O2, increased CO2 and a decreased pH is relayed to cardiac centers by the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the medulla of the brainstem. This increases the sympathetic nervous stimulation on the heart and a corresponding increase in heart rate and contractility in most cases. These factors include activation of stretch receptors due to increased ventilation and the release of circulating catecholamines.

However, if respiratory activity is arrested (e.g. in a patient with a high cervical spinal cord injury), then the primary cardiac reflex to transient hypercapnia and hypoxia is a profound bradycardia and coronary vasodilation through vagal stimulation and systemic vasoconstriction by sympathetic stimulation. In normal cases, if there is reflexive increase in respiratory activity in response to chemoreceptor activation, the increased sympathetic activity on the cardiovascular system would act to increase heart rate and contractility.

<text>Pigbag were a British post-punk band, best known for their instrumentals, active between 1980 and 1983.

==Origin and formation==

Pigbag were formed in Cheltenham in late 1980 by Chris Hamlin, a fashion student at Cheltenham Art College. Hamlin recruited multi-instrumentalist Roger Freeman, an old friend from his hometown of Birmingham, along with Chris Lee on trumpet and James Johnstone, a guitarist, record shop assistant and newcomer to the alto sax, for initial jam sessions which would eventually evolve into Pigbag. The group would jam in parks and various other places, but their usual practice space was Hamlin&#x27;s flat in Beech House, on the corner of St James&#x27;s Square and St George&#x27;s Place in Cheltenham.

After a couple of months they decided to expand the line-up, adding a rhythm section and rehearsing more seriously. They recruited Andrew &quot;Chip&quot; Carpenter on drums and Mark &quot;Miff&quot; Smith on bass, both old school friends of Johnstone&#x27;s, and former members of their previous band Hardware. It was at these jam sessions that &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Pigbag&quot; was developed from an idea Chris Hamlin and James Johnson had had before the band was formed. The song would become their signature tune.

When Hamlin heard that Simon Underwood had left The Pop Group he invited him to join the nascent band (to replace Mark Smith who had left by this point), the band then trading under the tentative name Us Corporation. Through a friend who knew Mark Stewart, The Pop Group&#x27;s vocalist, Hamlin and Johnstone acquired Underwood&#x27;s address and hitched down to Bristol to convince him, using tape recordings of their jam sessions. To their surprise Underwood agreed, also suggesting his friend Ollie Moore as tenor sax player.

Through Underwood&#x27;s connections with Dick O&#x27;Dell, then manager of The Slits and head of Y Records, they landed their first gig, supporting The Slits at Romeo and Juliet&#x27;s in Bristol on 21 October 1980. They played a twenty-minute version of what was to become &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Pigbag&quot; to a positive reception, and the next day O&#x27;Dell invited them to record the track for Y Records. At this point they adopted the name Pigbag, in reference to Chris Hamlin&#x27;s scruffy cloth bag bearing a screen-printed warthog.

==Early recordings==
The band made their first recordings in 1981 at Berry Street Studios in London. Later that year they released their first single, the instrumental &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got A Brand New Pigbag&quot;, on Y Records, distributed by Rough Trade, the title being a pun on James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got A Brand New Bag&quot;. The track became an underground dance hit. The song, and the remix &quot;Reach Up (Papa&#x27;s Got A Brand New Pigbag)&quot; by Paul Oakenfold under the alias Perfecto Allstarz (which became a UK and Irish Top 10 hit in early 1995), has become a stadium anthem in English football (particularly in the Football League), originally adopted by Queens Park Rangers supporters in 1994 after some of their fans took it on as an anthem at a music venue in Westbourne Park, often played or chanted before a match or at half time, or after the scoring of a goal, and often incorporating the name of a player into the song.

Around this time Hamlin left the band, feeling that he had created an unmanageable group with too many egos to contend with, and that he was &quot;losing control of the band&quot;. Soon afterwards he recorded a version of &quot;Swinging on a Star&quot; which was never released.

During September and October 1981, the band toured the US, playing in New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Northampton, MA, San Francisco and Berkeley, California. They followed &quot;Papa...&quot; with &quot;Sunny Day&quot;, a similarly brash, bright and funky track for which Ed Steinberg shot a video in New York. It became their first to chart on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at 53. They also recorded another single, &quot;Getting Up&quot;, in early 1982 which peaked at 61. March 1982 saw the release of their first album &quot;Dr Heckle and Mr Jive&quot;, which reached the Top 20 of the UK album chart, and topped the UK Indie Chart for several weeks, despite including only one of their previous singles - &quot;Getting Up&quot;. 

The band embarked on a long and gruelling college tour in the spring of 1982, which placed them under considerable strain. Roger Freeman was replaced by Brian Nevill for several gigs. Club play and the extensive tour had stimulated demand for &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Pigbag&quot;, which was consequently re-released on Stiff Records, peaking at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart and giving the band their only significant mainstream success.

The band made two appearances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, on 8 and 22 April 1982. Brian Nevill sat in on both appearances, and Paul &quot;Nellee&quot; Hooper (later producer for Björk, Madonna and Soul II Soul) also appeared with the band, although he was never a band member and did not play on any of the Pigbag recordings. The first &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance also saw Roger Freeman&#x27;s departure from the band. Already stressed from touring, Freeman refused to switch his donkey jacket for the suits which the band had decided to all wear for the show, so departed from the band the day before the recording. He went on to record the 1986 non-stop forty-minute prototype chill-out / house album &quot;Designer Beatnik&quot; with ex-Duran Duran member Stephen Duffy under the name Dr Calculus mdma (the cover photo showing the &quot;Spirit of Ecstasy&quot; car mascot).

==Later career==
On 27 April 1982, a new line-up, including Brian Nevill and Oscar Verden, started rehearsing. The band changed their sound slightly, following up with &quot;The Big Bean&quot;, a slower track with a more Caribbean vibe, which peaked at No. 40 in the UK Singles Chart. The single was recorded at Abbey Road Studios on 5 and 6 June 1982. This was followed by a short UK tour, then a European one, and dates in New York on 9 and 10 July and in Japan from 18 to 31 July.

Soon afterwards Angela Jaeger, a New York jazz singer, joined the band. Jaeger had previously sung with a band called The Drowning Craze. The next LP, &quot;Lend An Ear&quot;, was recorded in the late summer of 1982, and the band appeared on the Christmas edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

Underwood and Jaeger were married at Hammersmith Registry Office in 1983, attended by many notables from the music scene, including Johnny Rotten. During 1983, the band released a single, &quot;Hit The &#x27;O&#x27; Deck&quot; (a reference to turntables), and the album recorded the previous year, &quot;Lend An Ear&quot;. The band toured the UK from 14 February to 13 March 1983. A European tour followed from 29 March to 16 April. Their last live gig was in Portsmouth on 28 April 1983.

Following a poor critical reception to the new direction and differences in the band, Pigbag split in June 1983, with Johnstone, Jaeger and Underwood forming Instinct. Y Records released two posthumous albums, &quot;Pigbag&quot; (including seven live tracks and one remix), and &quot;Favourite Things&quot; (including all the singles plus a few other album tracks). The press accused Dick O&#x27;Dell of releasing the albums purely to buoy Y Records&#x27; finances, which were in trouble following the failure of most of their roster to make significant sales (with the possible exception of Shriekback, who instead fell out with O&#x27;Dell and left the label).

Kaz Records (part of Castle Communications) took over Y Records&#x27; operations when the label finally went bankrupt, and have subsequently released &quot;Discology: The Best Of Pigbag&quot; on CD.

==Legacy==
Although never hugely commercially successful, Pigbag had a distinctive sound. Members of the band went on to record with many other bands, some still active today. Their career took place during the huge mushrooming and cross-pollination of genres that followed the punk movement, and their music can be said to incorporate elements of punk, jazz, funk, ska, reggae and even tribal world music, such as afrobeat, all accompanied with undeniable pop sensibility. Pigbag&#x27;s influence can be heard today in the more funk-influenced percussive side of the post-punk revival, in such bands as !!! and LCD Soundsystem.

Their single &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Pigbag&quot; has entered mainstream consciousness, and is considered a classic pop hit of its era. It is removed somewhat from the rest of the band&#x27;s career, to the effect that Pigbag are sometimes considered one-hit wonders. It has been used extensively as soundtrack music and at sporting events, particularly by Middlesbrough Football Club and Queens Park Rangers, and is still a popular dance record in clubs. In 2003, an anthem row erupted before a play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff between Cardiff and Queens Park Rangers. Eventually neither &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; nor &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; were played and the clubs could choose their own song. Cardiff opted for &quot;Men of Harlech&quot;, while QPR went for &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got A Brand New Pigbag&quot;.

The track was sampled in Alex Gaudino&#x27;s song &quot;Watch Out&quot; and has been covered by several other artists. It featured on the soundtrack of the 2006 film of Alan Bennet&#x27;s &quot;The History Boys&quot;. English group Madness have included a cover version of the song in their live set on occasion. In Canada, the song was used as the theme for &quot;The NewMusic&quot;, a music newsmagazine show for over 25 years. British gymnast Claudia Fragapane used a remix for her floor music between 2015 and 2016.

In practice, &quot;JIS encoding&quot; usually refers to JIS X 0208 character data encoded with JIS X 0202. For instance, the IANA uses the codice_1 label to refer to JIS X 0202, and the codice_2 label to refer to the profile thereof defined by .

Other encoding mechanisms for JIS characters include the Shift JIS encoding and EUC-JP. Shift JIS adds the kanji, full-width hiragana and full-width katakana from JIS X 0208 to JIS X 0201 in a backward compatible way. Shift JIS is perhaps the most widely used encoding in Japan, as the compatibility with the single-byte JIS X 0201 character set made it possible for electronic equipment manufacturers (such as cash register manufacturers) to offer an upgrade from older cheaper equipment that was not capable of displaying kanji to newer equipment while retaining character-set compatibility.

EUC-JP is used on UNIX systems, where the JIS encodings are incompatible with POSIX standards.

A more recent alternative to JIS coded characters is Unicode (UCS coded characters), particularly in the UTF-8 encoding mechanism.

<doc id="489296" wikidata="Q973658" url="?curid=489296" title="Caudillo">
<text>A caudillo ( , ; , from Latin , diminutive of &quot;caput&quot; &quot;head&quot;) is a type of personalist leader wielding military and political power. There is no precise English translation for the term, though it is often used interchangeably with &quot;military dictator,&quot; &quot;warlord&quot; and &quot;strongman&quot;. The term is historically associated with Spain and Hispanic America, after virtually all of the regions in the latter won independence in the early nineteenth century.

The roots of &quot;caudillismo&quot; may be tied to the framework of rule in medieval and early modern Spain during the Reconquista from the Moors. Spanish conquistadors such as Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro exhibit characteristics of the &quot;caudillo&quot;, being successful military leaders, having mutual reliance on the leader and their supporters, and rewarding them for their loyalty. An important characteristic of the &quot;caudillo&quot; is their charisma, which drew in followers that could be utilized to change the political climate and shape state-formation in the post colonial era. The followers of &quot;caudillos&quot;, called &quot;gauchos&quot; were common people whom the &quot;caudillos&quot; could charm and persuade into joining their cause. Often the caudillo would take on the role of the provider as a substitute for the shortcomings of those in the government. It created a type of father-child bond between the &quot;caudillo&quot; and &quot;gaucho&quot; that strengthened loyalties and made the &quot;caudillos&quot; powerful. However, the paternalist view towards the relationship between the caudillo and the gaucho assumes that the caudillo has all of the power in the relationship and ignores that much of that power comes from the gaucho&#x27;s decision to follow a particular caudillo.

During the colonial era, the Spanish crown asserted its power and established a plethora of bureaucratic institutions that prevented personalist rule. Historian John Lynch argues that the rise of &quot;caudillos&quot; in Spanish America is rooted not in the distant Spanish past but in the immediate context of the Spanish American wars of independence. The wars overthrew colonial rule and left a power vacuum in the early nineteenth century. &quot;Caudillos&quot; were very influential in the history of Spanish America and left a legacy that has influenced political movements in the modern era. The term is often used pejoratively by critics of a regime. However, Spain&#x27;s General Francisco Franco (1936–1975) proudly took the title as his own during and after his military overthrow of the Second Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). Spanish censors during his rule attacked publishers who applied the term to Hispanic American strongmen. &quot;Caudillos&quot;&#x27; exercise of power is a form considered authoritarian. Most societies have had personalist leaders at times, but Hispanic America has had many more, the majority of whom were not self-described &quot;caudillos&quot;. However, scholars have applied the term to a variety of Hispanic-American leaders.

==Spanish American &quot;caudillos&quot;==
Since Spanish American independence in the early nineteenth century, the region has been noted for its number of &quot;caudillos&quot; and the duration of their rule. The early nineteenth century is sometimes called &quot;The Age of Caudillos&quot;, with Juan Manuel de Rosas, dictator of Argentina, and his contemporary in Mexico, Antonio López de Santa Anna, dominating national politics. Weak nation-states in Spanish America fostered the continuation of &quot;caudillismo&quot; from the late nineteenth century into the twentieth century. The lack of government attention to the needs of the people, allowed for there to be space for caudillos to fill those roles to give aid to peasants. The formation of Mexico&#x27;s Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1929 effectively ended &quot;caudillismo&quot;. Men characterized as &quot;caudillos&quot; have ruled in Cuba (Gerardo Machado, Fulgencio Batista, Fidel Castro), Panama (Omar Torrijos, Manuel Noriega), the Dominican Republic (Desiderio Arias, Cipriano Bencosme), Paraguay (Alfredo Stroessner), Argentina (Juan Perón and other military strongmen), and Chile (Augusto Pinochet). &quot;Caudillos&quot; have been the subject of literature in Spanish America.

Hispanic America is not unique in having strong leaders emerge during times of turmoil. The cause of their emergence in Spanish America is generally seen to be in the destruction of the Spanish colonial state structure after the wars of independence, and in the importance of leaders from the independence struggles for providing government in the post-independence period, when nation-states came into being. Historian John Lynch states that &quot;Before 1810 the caudillo was unknown. … The caudillo entered history as a local hero whom larger events promoted to a military chieftain.&quot; In a rural area that lacked any institutions of the state, and where the environment was one of violence and anarchy, a &quot;caudillo&quot; could impose order, often by using violence himself to achieve it. His local control as a strongman needed to be maintained by assuring the loyalty of his followers, so his bestowing of material rewards reinforced his own position. &quot;Caudillos&quot; could also maintain their position by protecting the interests of regional elites. A local strongman who built a regional base could aspire to become a national &quot;caudillo&quot;, taking control of the state. In this situation, &quot;caudillos&quot; could bestow patronage on a large retinue of clients, who in turn gave him their loyalty. In general, &quot;caudillos&quot;″ power benefited elites. But these strongmen were also mediators between elites and the popular classes, recruiting them into the power base, but also restraining them from achieving power themselves. For example, Federalist caudillos in the Argentinian provinces were able to build relationships with the rural poor; namely the gauchos and monteneros.  As the war of the Triple Alliance spread, ideological language shifts occurred in Buenos Aires by the ruling Unitarians, who began referring to rural caudillos as barbarians and enemies of civilization.  Unitarians tried to criminalize the federalists, Illegitimizing their political position.  Caudillos were not leading partisan bands, according to the Unitarians, but rather war lords leading bandits. The resulting placement of national guard troops being stationed in the provinces, who would be tasked with law enforcement and specifically separation from the caudillos.  As a next step political strategy, the Unitarians would also construct schools, providing compulsory education, emphasizing pro-unitarian political thought. Caudillos were effectively estranged by the effort and soon became a historical footnote in the process.

There were a few strongmen who either rose from a humble background to protect the interests of indigenous groups or other rural marginalized groups, or strongly identified with those groups; historian E. Bradford Burns referred to them as &quot;folk &quot;caudillos&quot;,&quot;. In his analysis, they contrasted with Europeanized elites who viewed the lower orders with contempt. He gives examples of Juan Facundo Quiroga, Martín Güemes, and other Argentine &quot;caudillos&quot;, most importantly Juan Manuel de Rosas, who were popular and populist &quot;caudillos&quot;. Burns attributes the urban elites&#x27; bafflement and their contempt for followers of these folk &quot;caudillos&quot; for much of the negative role assigned to &quot;caudillos&quot;.

National &quot;caudillos&quot; often sought to legitimize their rule by holding titles of authority such as &quot;President of the Republic&quot;. If the constitution put formal limits on presidential power and term limits, &quot;caudillos&quot; could bend or break the rules to maintain power, a practice dubbed .

Caudillo politics were not monolithic, they tended to follow the politics that would serve them best by keeping them in power and allowing them to retain their following. Ideologically, &quot;caudillos&quot; could be either liberal or conservative. Liberalism had an advantage in the post-independence period, drawing on the ideas of the liberators and creating the institutional frameworks of the new nation-states via written constitutions. Free trade as an economic policy created market-oriented economies. The model that these nation-states often adopted was federalism, keeping power in the component regions. Federalism, however, tended toward centrifugalism and fragmentation and was characterized by weak central governments. Conservative &quot;caudillos&quot; also emerged around 1830. New nation-states often rejected the institutions of the colonial era as legacies to be rejected, but the Roman Catholic Church and traditional values remained strong in many regions, supported by elites seeking to maintain their power in the new order. Conservative &quot;caudillos&quot;, supported by the Church and elites, moved to the creation of strong, central governments.

==Independence era==
Although there was the hope of some Spanish American leaders of independence that the political contours of regions would reconstitute the former viceroyalties, but with local autonomy. The Roman Catholic Church as an institution remained strong and the militaries won victories against royalist forces. The state as an institution in most areas was weak. Conflicts over the form the new governments should take were rampant, and veterans of the wars of independence saw themselves as the leaders of the nation-states they had helped bring into being. These &quot;caudillos&quot; were able to maintain their power through their connection with their &quot;gauchos&quot;. Unlike their traditional elite counterparts, &quot;caudillos&quot; sought to keep the relationships with their supporters strong. They often lived near or amongst the &quot;common people&quot;, so they were able to develop personal connections and experience problems first hand that otherwise might have been ignored by the elites. &quot;Gauchos&quot; would influence the political opinion of the common people, or peasants, through oral culture. They would tell stories and write songs and poems that shed their &quot;caudillos&quot; and the &quot;caudillos&quot;&#x27; ideals in a positive light. Their influence on the political climate allowed the common people to be a driving force of nation-building rather than just elite leaders.

In the wake of the violence and political disruption, new nations were faced with widespread property destruction, the disappearance of trade, and states that lacked political authority. The first few decades after independence saw the rise of strongmen with roots in the military. Spanish America had known no other type of regime than monarchy, and Mexico established one under a royalist general-turned-insurgent Agustín de Iturbide. In Spanish America, new sovereign states grappled with the question of balancing a central authority, usually in the hands of the traditional elites, with some kind of representation of the new &quot;citizenry&quot; of the republics. Constitutions were written laying out the division of powers, but the rule of personalist strongmen, &quot;caudillos,&quot; dominated. Dictatorial powers were granted to some &quot;caudillos&quot;, nominally ruling as presidents under a constitution, as &quot;constitutional dictators&quot;.

===Major leaders of the independence era===
==Early nineteenth-century &quot;caudillos&quot;==
There were a number of strongmen who went beyond raw struggles for power and its spoils and established &quot;integrative dictatorships&quot;. These regimes attempted to curtail centrifugal forces, often termed &quot;federalism&quot;, where regions or states of a nation-state had more autonomy and instead established the hegemony of the central government. According to political scientist Peter H. Smith, these include Juan Manuel de Rosas in Argentina; Diego Portales of Chile, whose system lasted nearly a century; and Porfirio Díaz of Mexico. Rosas and Díaz were military men, who continued to rely on armed forces to maintain themselves in power.

=== Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean ===

This region was vulnerable to stronger powers, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom. Cuba remained in the hands of the Spanish crown until 1898. The United States seized a huge part of Mexico. Britain attempted to set up a protectorate on the Mosquito Coast of Central America. The two strongmen of this early century were Antonio López de Santa Anna in Mexico and Rafael Carrera in Guatemala.
Mexico began its revolt against Spain in 1810, gaining independence in 1821. Political divisions in the post-independence period were labeled federalist, seeking a weak central government and often associated with liberalism, and centralist, who sought a strong central state and defense of traditional institutional structures, particularly the Mexican Army and the Roman Catholic Church. Many regional strongmen were in the Federalist-Liberal camp, which supported local control and the continuation of their power. The quintessential Mexican &quot;caudillo&quot;, who gained national power for decades, was Santa Anna, who was initially a Liberal but became a Conservative and sought strengthening of the central government. Following the Mexican–American War, regional caudillos such as Juan Álvarez of the state of Guerrero and Santiago Vidaurri of Nuevo León-Coahuila ousted Santa Anna in the Revolution of Ayutla, bringing Liberals to power. Álvarez follows the pattern of the &quot;folk &quot;caudillo&quot;&quot;, whom historian François Chevalier calls a &quot;good &quot;cacique&quot;, [who] protected the mainly indigenous and mestizo peasants of Guerrero, who in turn gave him their loyalty&quot;. Álvarez briefly served as President of Mexico, returning to his home state, leaving ideological liberals to institute the era of La Reforma. During the era of the Mexican Reform and the French intervention in Mexico, there were a number of generals who had regional personal followings. Important figures whose local power had consequences nationally included Mariano Escobedo in San Luis Potosí; Ramón Corona in Jalisco and Durango; and Porfirio Díaz in parts of Veracruz, Puebla, and Oaxaca. There were other &quot;caudillos&quot; whose power was more local but still important, including Gerónimo Treviño and Francisco Narajo in Nuevo León, Servando Canales and Juan Cortina in Tamaulipas, Florencio Antillón in Guanajuato, Ignacio Pesqueira in Sonora, Luis Terrazas in Chihuahua, and Manuel Lozada in Tepic. Following the defeat of the French in 1867, the government of Benito Juárez and his successor following his death, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, faced opponents who objected to their increasingly Centralist administrations. Those opponents gravitated to supporting Díaz, a military hero of the French intervention, who challenged Juárez and Lerdo by attempting rebellions, the second of which, the Plan of Tuxtepec, was successful in 1876. Juárez and Lerdo removed some &quot;caudillos&quot; from office, but this prompted them to rebel. These included Trinidad García de la Cadena in Zacatecas, Luis Mier y Terán in Veracruz, Juan Haro in Tampico, Juan N. Méndez in Puebla, Vicente Jiménez in Guerrero, and Juan Cortina in Matamoros. &quot;That they slowly gathered around Porfirio Díaz is the story of the rise of Porfirian Mexico.&quot;

=== Bolivarian republics: Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela ===
Simón Bolívar, the foremost leader of independence in Spanish America, attempted to recreate the Viceroyalty of New Granada in the nation of Gran Colombia. As with other areas of Spanish America, centrifugal forces caused the country to fragment into separate nation-states. Bolivar saw the need for political stability, which could be put into effect with a president-for-life and the power to name his successor. In 1828 his supporters called on him to assume dictatorial powers and &quot;save the republic&quot;. However, the political turmoil continued and Bolívar stepped down in 1830, going into self-imposed exile and dying shortly thereafter. &quot;He is revered as the one person who made the greatest contribution to Spanish American independence&quot; and admired by both the political left for opposing slavery and distrust of the U.S. and the right, which admires his authoritarianism.

Veterans of the wars of independence assumed the leadership of the newly created nation-states, each with a new constitution. Despite constitutions and ideological labels of liberals and conservatives, personalist and opportunistic leaders dominated the early nineteenth century. As with Mexico and Central America, the political turmoil and penury of the governments of the Bolivarian republics prevented foreign investors from risking their capital there.

One caudillo who was progressive for his time was Bolivia&#x27;s Manuel Isidoro Belzu, who served as the fourteenth president from 1848 until 1855. The former president, Jose Miguel de Velasco, executed a coup for the presidency in 1848, promising the position of Minister of War to Belzu. Belzu seized power for himself once the coup was completed and cemented his position as president by quashing a counter-coup by Velasco. During his presidency, Belzu instituted several reforms to the country&#x27;s economy in an effort to redistribute wealth more equitably. He rewarded the work of the poor and dispossessed. Like Paraguay&#x27;s Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia, Belzu chose to enact the aforementioned welfare programs because the idea of communalism was more in tune with the traditional values of native populations than the emphasis on private property that other caudillos embraced. Belzu was also known for his nationalization of the country&#x27;s profitable mining industry – he enacted protectionist policies to reserve Bolivian resources for Bolivian use, provoking the ire of British, Peruvian, and Chilean shipping and mining interests. Many of Belzu&#x27;s policies won him favor among the long-downtrodden indigenous peoples of Bolivia, but came at the cost of enraging wealthy Creole Bolivians as well as foreign countries like Britain that sought to use resources from Bolivian mines. Belzu took steps to legitimize his leadership, and was at one point democratically elected. Despite his popularity in many sectors, Belzu had many powerful enemies and he survived 40 assassination attempts. His enemies wanted to destroy the state-run projects that helped nationalist program but likewise improved the public sphere on which the country&#x27;s poor were reliant. However, the despotism that is so rife among the caudillos also found a home with Belzu – from the early 1850s until his abdication of power in 1855, he is said to have ruled despotically, making himself very wealthy in the process. Belzu considered returning to the presidency in 1861, but he was gunned down by one of his rivals by the time he tried to run for presidency again. He was unable to leave a legacy and his populist programs died with him. After Bolivia&#x27;s independence, Bolivia lost half of its territory to neighboring countries including Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Brazil through the war and agreements reached under the threat of invasion.

===Southern Cone: Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay===
In contrast to most of Spanish America, post-independence Chile experienced political stability under the authoritarian rule of conservatives, backed by the landowning class. Although he never sought the presidency, cabinet minister Diego Portales (1793–1837) is credited with creating a strong, centralized regime that lasted 30 years. In general, Chile prospered with an export-oriented economy based on agriculture and mining, an exception to most of the Spanish-American regimes.

In the former Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata, political instability and violence were more typical of the era. In Argentina, Juan Manuel de Rosas (r. 1829–1852) dominated the Argentine confederation. He came from a wealthy landowning family, but also acquired large tracts of land in Buenos Aires Province. Rosas despised &quot;the principles of political democracy and liberty [and] provided order in a region that had known near-anarchy since independence&quot;.

During his two-decade reign, Rosas rose to power and created an empire. He used his military experience to gain support from gauchos and estancias to create an army that would challenge the leadership of Argentina. After his rise to power using the rural workers, he changed his system in favor of using the military. He attempted to impose a ban on imported goods to help and win the support of the artisans in Argentina, but failed. He was forced to lift the ban on certain imports, like textiles, which opened a trade with Great Britain. Through his power over the imports and exports, the military, the police, and even the legislative branch of government, Rosas created a monopoly that would ensure his remaining in power for over two decades. By the 1850s, Rosas was under attack by the very people who had helped him gain power. He was driven out of power and eventually ended up in Great Britain, where he died in 1877.

Uruguay attained independence from Brazil and Argentina and was ruled by Fructuoso Rivera. In Paraguay, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia (r. 1814–1840) was Supreme Dictator of the Republic, maintaining the landlocked country&#x27;s independence from Argentina and other foreign powers. Sealed off from outside trade, Paraguay developed economic self-sufficiency under Francia. He based society on communal properties, rather than centralized authoritarianism, attempting to revert to the methods of the communal Indian society that existed previously in Paraguay. After independence the state gained control of the land which was once under control of the Church and the Spanish state. Francia created state ranches and rented out land for the use of citizens who were able to pay a fee. Francia&#x27;s repressive measures included crushing the power of the elite American-born Spaniards and curbing the power of the Roman Catholic Church. Francia allowed for religious freedom and abolished the tithe. He actively encouraged miscegenation. He has been a controversial figure in Hispanic American history: many modern historians credit him with bringing stability to Paraguay, preserving independence, and &quot;bequeathing to his successors an egalitarian, homogeneous nation&quot;. However, because of his crackdown on the wealthy elite and the subsequent weakening of their power, he was accused of anti-clericalism. Nevertheless, Paraguay prospered under Francia in terms of economics and trade through a trade route with Buenos Aires, which was opposed by the wealthy Argentinian elites. &quot;Sometimes counted among the dictators of the era, contemporary history has viewed Francia as an honest, populist leader who promoted sovereign economic prosperity in a war-torn Paraguay.&quot;

==&quot;Caudillos&quot; in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries==
In the late nineteenth century, regimes in Spanish America were more stable and often less dominated by military men. Foreign investors, particularly the British, began building infrastructure in countries of greatest interest to the UK&#x27;s economic needs. Such projects included railways, telegraph lines, and port facilities, which cut transportation time and costs and sped up communications. Stable political regimes that could ensure the security of foreign investments, facilitate extraction of resources, and production of agricultural crops and animals were the necessary structures. Industrialization also took hold in a few countries (Mexico, Argentina, Colombia) to produce consumer goods locally. In general, foreign governments and entrepreneurs had no interest in directly administering countries of Hispanic America in a formal colonial arrangement so long as their interests could be nurtured by modernizing national governments, often seen as neocolonialism. There are a number of examples of in Hispanic America whereby presidents continue in office beyond the legal term limits, with constitutional revision, plebiscites, and the creation of family dynasties, such as the Somoza family in Nicaragua.

===Mexico===

A major example of a modernizing caudillo of the late nineteenth century is Díaz (r. 1876–1911), whose period of control is known as the Porfiriato. His slogan was &quot;order and progress&quot;, which was enforced by armed men controlled by the president, the &quot;Rurales&quot;. Díaz was averse to being dependent on the Mexican army, since as a general and leader of a coup d&#x27;état himself, he knew their potential for intervening in national politics. Díaz coopted or crushed regional opposition to his regime, creating a political machine to forward his vision of modern Mexico. Desirous of economic development that necessitated foreign investment, Díaz sought capital and expertise from European powers (Britain, France, and Germany) to offset the closer power of the United States. Although elections were held in Mexico at regular intervals, they were by nature not democratic. The huge rural, illiterate, and mostly indigenous populations were more to be feared by the government than as a source for regime support. When Díaz failed to find a political solution to his succession, the Mexican Revolution erupted after the fraudulent 1910 general election.

Diaz came to power by a coup under the Plan of Tuxtepec and became president of Mexico 1876–1880, succeeded by his military and political &quot;compadre&quot; Manuel González (1880–1884) and returned to the presidency until he was overthrown in 1911 in the Mexican Revolution.

During the decade-long civil war, a number of regional caudillos arose. Pascual Orozco helped oust Díaz at the early stage of the Revolution, but then turned against Francisco I. Madero, who had been elected to the presidency in 1911. Pancho Villa also helped oust Díaz, supported Madero, and following his murder in 1913, became a general in the Constitutionalist Army commanded by civilian Venustiano Carranza. Emiliano Zapata, peasant leader from the state of Morelos, opposed to Díaz and every subsequent Mexican government until his murder in 1919 by Carranza&#x27;s agents. Álvaro Obregón emerged as another brilliant general from northern Mexico, defeating Villa&#x27;s Division of the North in 1915 after Villa had broken with Carranza. Obregón and fellow Sonoran generals Plutarco Elías Calles and Adolfo de la Huerta overthrew Carranza in 1920 under the Plan of Agua Prieta, with the presidency in the 1920s going in turn from de la Huerta, to Obregón, to Calles, and back to Obregón. During Calles&#x27;s presidency (1924–1928), he stringently enforced the anticlerical laws of the Mexican Constitution of 1917, leading to the Cristero War, a failed major uprising under the leadership of some regional caudillos, including Saturnino Cedillo of San Luis Potosí. Obregón was elected again in 1928, but was assassinated before he could again resume the presidency. In 1929, Plutarco Elías Calles founded a political party, then known as the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (PNR), and became the (&quot;maximum chief&quot;), the power behind the presidency in a period known as the Maximato (1928–1934); PNR&#x27;s iteration as the Institutional Revolutionary Party dominated Mexican politics until 2000 and functioned as a brake on the personalist power of regional caudillos in Mexico.

===Central America===
With the improvement of transportation, tropical products such as coffee and bananas could be transported to a growing consumer market in the United States. In Guatemala Justo Rufino Barrios ruled as a Liberal autocrat and expanded coffee cultivation.

==&quot;Caudillos&quot; in literature==
Fictional Hispanic American &quot;caudillos&quot;, sometimes based on real historical figures, are important in literature. Colombian Nobel Prize winner Gabriel García Márquez published two works with strongmen as main characters: &quot;The Autumn of the Patriarch&quot; and &quot;The General in his Labyrinth&quot;, the latter a controversial novel about Simón Bolívar. In 1946, Nobel Prize laureate Miguel Ángel Asturias published &quot;El Señor Presidente&quot;, based on the life of Manuel Estrada Cabrera (1898–1920), which was translated to English in 1975. In 1974, Augusto Roa Bastos published &quot;I, the Supreme&quot; based on Francia&#x27;s life. In Mexico, two fictional &quot;caudillos&quot; are depicted by Mariano Azuela&#x27;s 1916 novel &quot;The Underdogs&quot; and Carlos Fuentes&#x27;s novel &quot;The Death of Artemio Cruz&quot;. In 1929, Mexican writer Martín Luis Guzmán published his novel &quot;La sombra del caudillo&quot;, a powerful critic of such strongmen. An outlier in terms of subject matter is Rómulo Gallegos&#x27;s &quot;Doña Bárbara&quot;, depicting a woman &quot;caudillo&quot;.

<text>Arthur Sturgis Hardy, (December 14, 1837 – June 13, 1901) was a Canadian lawyer and Liberal politician who served as the fourth premier of Ontario from 1896 to 1899.

In 1889, as Commissioner of Crown Lands, Hardy established the Algonquin and Rondeau provincial parks. Well known for his support of Mowat&#x27;s liberalism, he was described in &quot;Grip&quot; as a hard-nosed and down-to-earth politician in Mowat&#x27;s service:

Entering his sixties and having been in government for over twenty years, Hardy lacked the energy and strength to take the government forward or excite the populace when he succeeded Mowat as both Premier and Attorney-General in 1896. Initially reluctant to accept the positions, he said:

Aware of his weakness, he relied heavily on his minister of education, George William Ross.

Because there were Liberal governments in both Ottawa and Ontario, Hardy was urged to reassure French-speaking Catholics&#x27; concerns over the Manitoba Schools Question by appointing François-Eugène-Alfred Évanturel as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. In the 1898 election, Hardy&#x27;s government was returned with a narrow six seat majority due to the collapse of the agrarian Patrons of Industry party which had served as the Liberal&#x27;s allies in the legislature, as well as the rise of Catholic and urban support for the Conservatives under James Pliny Whitney.

Hardy&#x27;s most significant—and controversial—achievement occurred in 1898 with passage of an Act providing for all pine cut under licence on crown lands to be sawn into lumber in Canada. Michigan lumbermen sought to have the amendment disallowed for encroaching on the federal trade and commerce power, but Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s government refused to do so.

Exhausted and needing money, Hardy retired from politics in 1899 and died two years later from appendicitis. Hardy&#x27;s body was originally interred at Greenwood Cemetery, however 34 years after his death, his son Senator Arthur Charles Hardy had the remains of Hardy, his wife, and their daughter Gladys Mary Starr moved to Farringdon Burial Ground.

==Legacy==

An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected in Brantford, Ontario, by the province to commemorate Hardy&#x27;s role in Ontario&#x27;s history. On June 25, 2009, a new plaque was unveiled to commemorate Hardy under the initiative of Premiers&#x27; Gravesites Program. Local politicians, guests and family members paid tribute to the former politician. The family included his great-great-great-granddaughter and the children of his great-nephew Hagood Hardy.

<text>Albert Henry Woolson (February 11, 1850 – August 2, 1956) was the last known surviving member of the Union Army who served in the American Civil War; he was also the last surviving Civil War veteran on either side whose status is undisputed. At least three men who outlived Woolson claimed to be Confederate veterans, but one has been debunked and the other two are unverified. The last surviving Union soldier to see combat was James Hard (1843–1953).

==Biography==
Woolson was born in Antwerp, New York, to Willard P. Woolson (1811–1862) and Caroline Baldwin (ca. 1822–unknown). He claimed to be born on February 11, 1847, but his entry in the 1850 United States census lists him as born in 1850. Entries in the later census records and in the 1905 Minnesota state census support the conclusion that he was born in 1850.

His father, Willard Woolson, enlisted in the Union Army. Willard was wounded at the Battle of Shiloh and was transported to an Army hospital in Windom, Minnesota, where he would die of his wounds. Albert and his mother moved to Windom to accompany Willard. Albert enlisted as a drummer boy in Company C, 1st Minnesota Heavy Artillery Regiment on October 10, 1864, becoming the company&#x27;s drummer. However, the company never saw action, and Albert Woolson was discharged on September 7, 1865.

Woolson returned to Minnesota, where he lived the rest of his life. He was a carpenter and later a member of the Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R.), a powerful political organization made up of Civil War veterans where he became senior vice commander in chief in 1953.

In his final days, he lived at 215 East Fifth Street in Duluth, Minnesota. Woolson died at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Duluth on August 2, 1956, at what was then thought to be the age of 109, of a &quot;recurring lung congestion condition&quot;. He was twice widowed and was survived by six daughters and two sons. Woolson was buried with full military honors by the National Guard at Park Hill Cemetery.

Following his death, President Dwight D. Eisenhower said: 
The American people have lost the last personal link with the Union Army ... His passing brings sorrow to the hearts of all of us who cherished the memory of the brave men on both sides of the War Between the States. 

==Legacy==
Woolson and fellow drummer boy Frank Mayer marched together, both aged 99, in the Memorial Day Parade in May 1949, to lay a wreath at the tomb of General Grant in New York City.

&quot;Life&quot; magazine ran a seven-page article upon the death of Albert Woolson, in the August 20, 1956, issue. The article included much information about the G.A.R., with pictures or drawings of several encampments (conventions). Also included were photos of the last three living Confederate soldiers (status and age disputed): William Lundy, 108; Walter Williams, 113; and John Salling, 110.

In mid-2006, new census research indicated that Albert Woolson was actually 106 years old, being listed as less than one year old in the 1850 census. Previous research in 1991 had suggested he was only a year younger than claimed (108 instead of 109), although this does not affect his veteran status.

After his death, the Grand Army of the Republic was dissolved because Woolson was its last surviving member.

Some of Woolson&#x27;s artifacts are on display at the Veterans Memorial Hall gallery, a program of St. Louis County Historical Society, in the St. Louis County Depot in downtown Duluth, Minnesota.

The 2011–2012 &quot;Minnesota Legislative Manual&quot; was dedicated to him.

In 1956, a monument of Woolson was erected in Gettysburg as a memorial to the Grand Army of the Republic. A twin statue is on display outside the St. Louis County Depot in downtown Duluth, Minnesota.

<text>Chitterlings ( ), sometimes spelled chitlins or chittlins, are a food most commonly made from the small intestines of pigs, though cow, lamb, goose and goat may also be used.

They may be filled with a forcemeat to make sausage. 

==Etymology and early usage==

&quot;Chitterling&quot; is first documented in Middle English in the form , . Various other spellings and dialect forms were used. The primary form and derivation are uncertain.

A 1743 English cookery book &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Companion: or, An Infallible Guide to the Fair Sex&quot; contained a recipe for &quot;Calf&#x27;s Chitterlings&quot; which was essentially a bacon and offal sausage in a calf&#x27;s intestine casing. The recipe explained the use of calves&#x27;, rather than the more usual pigs&#x27;, intestines with the comment that &quot;[these] sort of... puddings must be made in summer, when hogs are seldom killed&quot;. This recipe was repeated by the English cookery writer Hannah Glasse in her 1784 cookery book &quot;Art of Cookery&quot;.

Linguist Paul Anthony Jones has written, &quot;in the late 1500s a &quot;chitterling&quot; was an ornate type of neck ruff, so called because its frilled edge looked like the folds of a slaughtered animal&#x27;s entrails&quot;.

==Preparation==

Disease can be spread by chitterlings not cleaned properly and undercooked. Pathogens include &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot;, and &quot;Salmonella&quot;. Chitterlings are often soaked and rinsed thoroughly in several different cycles of cool water, and repeatedly picked clean by hand. They may then be turned inside out, cleaned and boiled, sometimes in baking soda or salt, and the water discarded.

==Regional traditions==
As pigs are a common source of meat in many parts of the world, the dish known as chitterlings can be found in most pork-eating cultures. Chitterlings made from pig intestines are popular in many parts of Europe, and are also eaten in the southern United States.

===Europe===
====Balkans, Greece, and Turkey====
Kokoretsi, , or are usually prepared and stuffed, then grilled on a spit. In several countries such as Turkey, Greece, Albania, and Bulgaria, lamb intestines are widely used. In Turkish cuisine, the intestines are often chopped and cooked with oregano, peppers, and other spices.

====France====
 are a traditional dish in Gironde. They are made of pigs&#x27; small intestines, boiled in bouillon, then grilled on a fire of grapevine cane. This is considered an expensive delicacy.

Andouillette is a type of sausage, found especially in Troyes, which is made predominantly of pig chitterlings.

Andouille is another kind of French chitterlings sausage found especially in Brittany and Normandy.

Saucisson is a type of sausage, which traditionally uses chitterlings both as a packaging and as an ingredient.

====Spain====
 are a traditional dish in Madrid. The dish consists of sheep&#x27;s small intestines, spleen, and pancreas, fried in their own fat in such a manner that they form small spirals. The dish is served hot, often with French fries. Few establishments today serve , as this is considered to be more of a speciality than a common dish. It is most commonly served during festivals.

: A traditional dish from Cuenca is , braided sheep&#x27;s intestines rolled on a vine branch and usually broiled, but also sometimes fried, and sometimes smoked, usually served hot as an appetizer or tapa. A similar dish from La Rioja is , and from the province of Aragon, , all made with sheep&#x27;s intestines and served as tapas.

====United Kingdom====
Chitterlings were common peasant food in medieval England, and remained a staple of the diet of low-income families right up until the late nineteenth century and not uncommon into the mid-twentieth century. Thomas Hardy wrote of chitterlings in his novel &quot;Tess of the D&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;, when the father of a poor family, John Durbeyfield, talks of what he would like to eat:
Tell &#x27;em at home that I should like for supper—well, lamb&#x27;s fry if they can get it; and if they can&#x27;t, black-pot; and if they can&#x27;t get that, well, chitterlings will do.
It illustrates that chitterlings were the poorest choice of poor food. George Sturt, writing in 1919 details the food eaten by his farming family in Farnborough when he was a child (probably around 1830):
During the winter they had chance to weary of almost every form and kind of pig-meat: hog&#x27;s puddings, gammons, chitterlings, souse, salted spareribs—they knew all the varieties and welcomed any change. Mutton they almost never tasted: but sometimes they had a calf&#x27;s head; sometimes even, though less often, a joint of veal.
Chitterlings are the subject of a song by 1970s Scrumpy and Western comedy folk band, The Wurzels, who come from the southwest of England.

Haggis, made with sheep intestine, is still a common traditional food in Scotland.

===Latin America and the Caribbean===
People in the Caribbean and in Latin America eat chitterlings. (in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay) or (in Chile) (from the Quechua , meaning &#x27;intestine&#x27;) is the cow&#x27;s small intestine used as a foodstuff. Other name variations from country to country are (Paraguay), or (Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico), (Brazil, Peru, Panama), , or (Colombia), (Venezuela), (Ecuador), (Jamaica), and (Mexico).

====Jamaica====
In Jamaica, chitterlings are usually prepared in a number of ways. Usually the intestines of a goat are used as part of the ingredients of Mannish water or goat belly soup. Sometimes goat head may be included and may simply be called goat head soup, even though most of the ingredients do not constitute goat head alone. The intestines of a cow are usually prepared as a stew in one of three ways. The most popular would be curried tripe and beans where the intestines are cooked down with butter beans and curry powder. A similar stew is also made with butter beans but without the curry powder. Less common is a stew that is prepared with red kidney beans instead of butter beans and with no curry powder. In this latter case the stew has a very dark red colour and usually has a thick consistency. In most cases, chitterlings are commonly eaten with white rice, though rice and peas may be preferred.

====Mexico====
In Mexico, are very popular served as a in tacos. They are cleaned, boiled, sliced, and then fried until crispy. They are often served with a spicy, tangy tomatillo-based salsa. In Guadalajara, along with the traditional preparation for tacos, they are often prepared as a dish, served with a specialized sauce in a bowl and accompanied by a stack of tortillas, additional complementary sauces, limes, and salt.

===United States===
Though no longer commonly consumed, chitterlings, commonly called &quot;chitlins&quot;, are a traditional food of the Southern United States that spread nationwide with the Black Migration. They are carefully cleaned and rinsed several times before they are boiled or stewed for several hours. A common practice is to place a halved onion in the pot to mitigate the very unpleasant odor that can be particularly strong when the chitterlings begin to cook. Chitterlings sometimes are battered and fried after the stewing process and commonly are served with apple cider vinegar and hot sauce as condiments. Attempts have been made to modernize the dish with microwaveable chitterling snacks developed in the 2010s.

Chitterlings have a strong connection with African-American soul food in the U.S. A common assumption is that the Southern consumption of chitterlings arose in the pre–Civil War era of slavery when less desirable parts of the pig, like pigs feet and hog jowls, were given to slaves, while the better cuts went to the slave masters, who were thus said to be &quot;living high on the hog&quot;. However, culinary historian Adrian Miller points out that, &quot;Enslaved people did eat chitlins, but white people were eating them as well. In fact, if you look at slave narratives and oral histories of the era, there were quite a few references of making chitlins for the master, and eating intestines was something that was in white culture for centuries before we get to the American South. People that went on hunts would eat the intestines as prized delicacies.&quot;

Still Miller calls chitterlings &quot;an iconic dish in African American food traditions, [with] a working-class vibe, even though the dish has shown up at high-class affairs&quot;. When plantations held early winter hog-killings, they preserved all parts of the animal that could be preserved by pickling, salting or smoking. Chitterlings, which could not be preserved, were cooked immediately as part of a post-slaughter celebration and served mainly (although not exclusively) to slaves. Because of this tie to special occasions, chitterlings have retained a role as a holiday delicacy, but gained a mixed reputation among African Americans, with some rejecting them as a relic of oppression and others embracing them as a delicacy.

In 1952&#x27;s &quot;Invisible Man&quot;, novelist Ralph Ellison touched on this mixed cultural role of chitterlings among African Americans. By the 1960s the dish had become politicized among black people as a symbol both good and bad. Prominent activists from Eldridge Cleaver to Elijah Muhammad to Dick Gregory criticized chitterlings (and often soul food in general), but the dish was also seen as &quot;a way of celebrating the resistance and spirit of survival and creativity that emerged despite the horrific history of racism in this country&quot; in Miller&#x27;s words.

In 2003, the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Anacostia Museum and Center for African American History and Culture accepted the papers of Shauna Anderson and her restaurant, The Chitlin Market, as part of its emerging collection of materials about African American celebrations, foods and foodways. In 2007, the Prince Georges County, Maryland government shut down The Chitlin Market when the restaurant&#x27;s location was rezoned from commercial to residential.

White Southerners, especially of rural origin, have sometimes celebrated the eating of chitterlings. In the 20th century, eating clubs devoted to the dish arose in cities from Raleigh, North Carolina, to Nashville, Tennessee. The town of Salley, South Carolina, has held an annual Chitlin&#x27; Strut Festival since 1966 on the Saturday after Thanksgiving and includes a fried chitterling–eating contest.

The Chitlin&#x27; Circuit, a collection of performance venues for African Americans, is named for this &quot;potent symbol of resilience in African American creative culture&quot;. In 1965, blues harmonica player and vocalist Junior Wells recorded a song, &quot;Chitlin Con Carne&quot; on his acclaimed Delmark Records album, &quot;Hoodoo Man Blues&quot;. Jazz guitarist Kenny Burrell recorded the unrelated jazz blues &quot;Chitlins con Carne&quot; on 1963&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Blue&quot; (covered by others including Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble on &quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot;.) Other notable blues songs with references to chitlins were recorded in 1929 by Peg Leg Howell (&quot;Chittlin&#x27; Supper&quot;), and in 1934 by the Memphis Jug Band (&quot;Rukus Juice and Chittlin&#x27;&quot;). Gus Jenkins, Johnny Otis, and Arthur Williams have also recorded songs with a reference to chitlins in their title. The bluegrass standard &quot;It&#x27;s Chitlin Cooking Time In Cheatham County&quot; takes its name from the dish and Cheatham County, Tennessee.

===Asia and Australasia===
Chitterlings are also eaten as a dish in many East Asian cuisines.

====China====
Both large and small intestine (typically pig) is eaten throughout China. Large intestine is called , literally &#x27;fat intestine&#x27; because it is fatty. Small intestine is called , literally &#x27;pig powder intestine&#x27; because it contains a white, pasty or powdery substance called chyme. The character or &#x27;pig&#x27; is added at the beginning to disambiguate. This is because in Cantonese cuisine, there is a dish called &quot;cheong fun&quot; which uses intestine-shaped noodles.

Large intestine is typically chopped into rings and has a stronger odor than small intestine. It is added to stir-fry dishes and soups. It is also slow-cooked or boiled and served as a standalone dish. It releases oil that may be visible in the dish. Small intestine is normally chopped into tubes and may be simply boiled and served with a dipping sauce. Preparation techniques and serving presentations for both small and large intestine vary greatly within the country.

====Japan====
In Japan, chitterlings or are often fried and sold on skewers or in &quot;kushikatsu&quot; () or restaurants and street vendor pushcarts. When grilled, it is usually called , as in Horumonyaki. It is also served as a soup called with miso, ginger, and finely chopped green onions to cut the smell, as well as other ingredients and internal organs such as the stomach, depending on the preparer. In Okinawa, the soup is called and served without miso as the chitterlings are put through a long cleaning process to get rid of the smell so the miso is not needed. In Nagoya it is called and is served with red miso and without the soup.

<text>Sir George William Ross (September 18, 1841 – March 7, 1914) was an educator and politician in the Canadian province of Ontario. He was the fifth premier of Ontario from 1899 to 1905.

==Early life==
Born near Nairn, in Middlesex County, Upper Canada, Ross worked as a school teacher, a school inspector and a newspaper publisher before he got into politics.

Ross&#x27;s parents had emigrated from Tain in the Highlands of Scotland in 1831 and the language of his youth was Scottish Gaelic. He, along with his fellow Canadian Gaels, held a lifelong love for the language. As a tribute, a short biographical account of Ross was printed in Gaelic in Ontario in the year following his death.

==Early political career==
He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal in the 1872 election, and was re-elected in the 1874 and 1878 elections. During his time as an MP, he actively defended the &quot;Canada Temperance Act&quot;, which favoured the &quot;local option&quot; approach for implementing prohibition.

He was initially declared re-elected again in the 1882 election, but his victory was challenged, and the next year the vote was declared void.

Rather than run again, Ross moved to provincial politics when he was offered the position of Minister of Education for Ontario in the Liberal government of Sir Oliver Mowat in 1883. He oversaw the transformation of former mechanics&#x27; institutes into more than 300 public libraries, the expansion of the kindergarten system, and the creation of a provincial School of Pedagogy for the training of school inspectors and masters. Ross increased grants to the education system, expanded the authority of the provincial Department of Education, and oversaw the expansion of the university system and the federation of a number of smaller colleges with the University of Toronto. He also, controversially, established an oligopoly for the supply of textbooks to Ontario schools that was in effect from 1885 until 1907.

Ross implemented a system of gradated education from kindergarten (a new innovation that Ross was the first to recognise as part of the provincial school system) to university, unifying what had been separately organised systems. During his time as Minister of Education (1883–99), Ross established both Arbor Day and Empire Day, in order to inculcate in students both the desire to keep the school grounds attractive as well as a sense of patriotism. With regard to this latter, under his ministry, both Canadian history and military training became part of the curriculum in high schools in Ontario. This mandatory cadet training became controversial with the general public after the two World Wars, and was finally phased out entirely in 1944.

The Conservative opposition protested against the possibility of increased support for the Catholic Church&#x27;s Separate school system, while the Catholic minority agitated for the same high schools and other facilities that the public (Protestant) school system enjoyed. The Protestant Protective Association was formed by Orangemen in the 1890s to oppose the expansion of Catholic rights, and to attempt to exclude Catholics from public life in the province.

==Premier of Ontario==
After Mowat&#x27;s retirement as Premier, and a short interregnum triggered by Arthur S. Hardy, Ross became Premier (and Provincial Treasurer) on October 21, 1899. Nicknamed as the &quot;Father of New Ontario&quot;, he was present in the development of Northern Ontario:

* promoting the development of its natural resources through extending manufacturing conditions already in effect for pine timber to spruce and other softwood,
* introducing a bounty on the refining of nickel ore within the province,
* initiating a survey of Northern Ontario, which promoted the potential of the Great Clay Belt for settlement, and
* establishing the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway.

The Liberal government was tired, however, after almost thirty years in office, and Ross could do little to revive its fortunes. In the provincial election of 1902, the Liberal majority was cut to one seat, but at a time when parties lacked the discipline over their members they would later develop, that was not enough for a secure government.

The Ross administration was rocked by a series of controversies in its second term:

* a vote-buying scandal based on allegations brought forward by Robert Roswell Gamey engulfed the government,
* demands for prohibition split the party,
* support for the insolvent industrial empire of Francis Hector Clergue in Sault Ste. Marie led to charges of favouritism, and
* its reluctance towards the cause of public ownership of electricity generation was strongly criticized by the Opposition under James Pliny Whitney, especially when it was revealed that The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company (of which Ross was President) was a significant investor in the Electrical Development Company.

Leading a stagnating and drifting government, Ross called an election for January 25, 1905, in which the Liberals lost 22 seats and the Conservatives under James P. Whitney won 69, making Whitney the new Premier.

==Senator==
Ross remained Liberal leader until 1907, when Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier recommended him for an appointment to the Senate of Canada. In 1910, Ross received a knighthood from King George V for his years of public service in both Federal and Provincial politics. He wrote two books about his life in politics, and died in 1914.

==Family==
Ross was the father of Duncan Campbell Ross, who sat in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing Middlesex West from 1907 to 1908 and Middlesex North from 1908 to 1909, and later as an MP for Middlesex West from 1909 to 1921.

<doc id="489304" wikidata="Q8006931" url="?curid=489304" title="William Coates (longevity claimant)">
<text>William Coates (June 2, 1911 – February 24, 2004) was an American man from Maryland who was an unverified claimant as a supercentenarian whose actual age was subsequently disputed. 

Coates came to wider prominence when he was covered in a 1999 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article regarding a celebration of his 110th birthday, with some further coverage in 2002. When Coates died on 24 February 2004, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that he had &quot;nine children, 21 grandchildren and 37 great-grandchildren from two relationships&quot;. 

On his death, news reports said Coates was believed to have been the oldest man in the United States aged 114 years, based upon his nursing home records that gave his year of birth as 1889. The reports noted there was no birth certificate, but also noted that a lack of a birth certificate would &quot;not have been uncommon for African Americans of his generation&quot;. 

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; quoted the director of a Maryland senior center who had done research on county centenarians as saying Coates was born June 2, 1889. If the claim was correct, Coates was the world&#x27;s oldest person after the death of Mitoyo Kawate, and its oldest man after the death of Yukichi Chuganji.

However, in March 2004, one week after Coates&#x27; death, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran a longer follow-up story which quoted the Gerontology Research Group (GRG) who said that a register of William J. Coates with his parents and siblings in the 1930 United States census listed his age as 18 years old. The census data would mean that Coates was 92 at the time of his death. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted in their March 2004 follow-up story that none of Coates&#x27; relatives had ever claimed he was 114, and that they knew little of his life. The &quot;Post&quot; quoted a distressed relative&#x27;s reaction saying &quot;The &quot;Post&quot; should have researched that [earlier, February 2004] story and gotten their facts straight before it was ever released in the first place&quot;. 

In an interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2005, GRG Director Robert Young said regarding Coates that &quot;We had so much information that he was lying&quot;, and &quot;He was listed as eight years old in the 1920 Census and 18 in the 1930 Census&quot;.

<doc id="489306" wikidata="Q626440" url="?curid=489306" title="Arashi">
<text>is a Japanese boy band consisting of five members formed under the Johnny &amp; Associates talent agency. The members are Satoshi Ohno, Sho Sakurai, Masaki Aiba, Kazunari Ninomiya, and Jun Matsumoto. Arashi officially formed on September 15, 1999, in Honolulu, Hawaii, and made their debut CD on November 3, 1999. The group was initially signed to Pony Canyon and released one studio album and six singles—beginning with their 1999 eponymous debut single before moving to the Johnny&#x27;s subsidiary label J Storm in 2001, which was initially set up for their succeeding releases. While their debut single sold close to a million copies, the group took a mixture of pop and alternate/contemporary approach to its music which attracted core followers, but subsequently faced commercially slow sales.

With the release of their eighteenth single &quot;Love So Sweet&quot;, Arashi began to gain commercial success as it was used as the opening theme song for the high-rating drama &quot;Hana Yori Dango 2&quot; whose protagonist is played by Matsumoto, making it one of the top five best-selling singles of 2007 in Japan and the group&#x27;s first single to exceed 400,000 copies sold overall in nearly seven years. For the next two years, Arashi gained a number of achievements and records as they became the first artist to place the top two rankings on the &quot;Oricon&quot; singles yearly chart for two consecutive years with their singles &quot;Truth / Kaze no Mukō e&quot; and &quot;One Love&quot; in 2008 and &quot;Believe / Kumorinochi, Kaisei&quot; and &quot;Ashita no Kioku / Crazy Moon (Kimi wa Muteki)&quot; in 2009, simultaneously topped the 2009 &quot;Oricon&quot; singles, album and music DVD yearly charts, and became the third artist in &quot;Oricon&quot; history to monopolize the top three best-selling singles of the year. In 2010, all six of Arashi&#x27;s singles ranked within the top ten of the &quot;Oricon&quot; singles yearly chart, and their million-selling studio album &quot;Boku no Miteiru Fūkei&quot; was named the best-selling album of the year in Japan. , the group had sold over 58.8 million copies of albums, singles and videos and became the best selling boy band in Asia. Since then, Arashi has continued to release chart-topping singles and albums, perform in sold-out concert tours, host a number of variety shows, and remain an influential figure in Japanese media.

On January 27, 2019, Arashi announced that group activities would be suspended as of December 31, 2020.

==History==

===1999–2001: Debut and departure from Pony Canyon===
Johnny &amp; Associates announced the group&#x27;s debut on September 15, 1999, through a press conference aboard a cruise ship off the coast of Honolulu, Hawaii. Then-president Johnny Kitagawa chose five trainees from the Johnny&#x27;s Jr. division of the agency to become the members of Arashi, the Japanese word for &quot;Storm&quot;, and to represent the agency&#x27;s thrust of &quot;creating a storm throughout the world&quot;. On November 3, 1999, they made their CD debut by releasing the single &quot;Arashi&quot;, which became the theme song for the FIVB Volleyball Men&#x27;s World Cup hosted by Japan in 1999. It went on to become a major hit, selling 557,430 copies in its first week and almost a million copies by the end of its chart run.

On April 5, 2000, Arashi released their second single, &quot;Sunrise Nippon/Horizon&quot;, which debuted at number-one on the &quot;Oricon&quot; weekly singles chart selling 304,340 copies. The next day, the group began their first concert tour at Osaka Hall. In July, the group released their next single &quot;Typhoon Generation&quot;, which debuted at number three on the weekly singles chart with 256,510 copies sold, and continued to chart for nine weeks before leaving the charts. After holding more concerts in August, the group released their last single of 2000, &quot;Kansha Kangeki Ame Arashi&quot;. The single debuted at number two on the &quot;Oricon&quot; weekly singles chart and had first-week sales of 258,720.

In January 2001, Arashi released their first studio album, &quot;Arashi No.1 Ichigou: Arashi wa Arashi o Yobu!&quot;. The album debuted at number-one on the &quot;Oricon&quot; weekly album chart with initial sales of 267,220 copies. Until the release of their tenth anniversary compilation album &quot;All the Best! 1999–2009&quot;, the album remained the group&#x27;s best-selling album with overall sales of about 323,030 for nearly ten years. From March 25 to April 30, 2001, the group embarked on their first nationwide concert tour &quot;Arashi Spring Concert 2001&quot;. The tour took place in Sendai, Osaka, Nagoya, Hokkaidō, Fukuoka, Hiroshima, Kanazawa, Toyama, and Tokyo with an unprecedented twenty-six performances. Before moving to a private record label by the end of 2001, Arashi released &quot;Jidai&quot; as their final single under Pony Canyon. Used as the theme song for Matsumoto&#x27;s drama &quot;Kindaichi Shōnen no Jikenbo 3&quot;, it was named Best Theme Song in the 30th Television Drama Academy Awards.

===2002–2005: J Storm and decline in sales===
Arashi began 2002 by releasing their first single under J Storm. &quot;A Day in Our Life&quot; was used as the theme song for Sakurai&#x27;s comedy drama &quot;Kisarazu Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot; and debuted atop of the &quot;Oricon&quot; weekly singles chart selling 226,480 copies. Their subsequent releases of the year, &quot;Nice na Kokoroiki&quot; and &quot;Pikanchi&quot;, were used as the theme songs for the anime &quot;Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo&quot; and Arashi&#x27;s movie respectively.

Starting in 2003, the group would only release two singles every year until 2007. Both singles released in 2003, &quot;Tomadoi Nagara&quot; and &quot;Hadashi no Mirai/Kotoba Yori Taisetsu na Mono&quot;, debuted at number two on the charts. The song &quot;Kotoba Yori Taisetsu na Mono&quot; marked the first time a member contributed to the penning of a single, as many of the group&#x27;s songs are produced by other lyricists, composers, or musicians. Sakurai, who is the designated rapper of Arashi, has since written all the incorporated rap lyrics of the group&#x27;s releases.

The year 2004 was Arashi&#x27;s fifth anniversary since debut. They began the year by releasing their twelfth single, &quot;Pikanchi Double&quot;, in February as the theme song for their second movie . Selling 89,106 copies in the first week, it is Arashi&#x27;s lowest-selling single to date. In celebration of their anniversary, the group released a greatest hits album &quot;5x5 The Best Selection of 2002–2004&quot;, which included their second 2004 single &quot;Hitomi no Naka no Galaxy/Hero&quot;.

In 2005, on New Year&#x27;s Day, Arashi released their first concert DVD since &quot;How&#x27;s It Going?&quot; in 2003 titled &quot;2004 Arashi! Iza, Now Tour!!&quot;. From July 26 to August 24, they embarked on a summer tour titled &quot;One&quot; to support their album of the same name. One of the highlights of the tour included the live performance their first single of the year, &quot;Sakura Sake&quot;, on top of , a transparent stage that travels over the top of the audience. Invented by Matsumoto, &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Moving Stage&quot; has since been used in a majority of Arashi&#x27;s concerts to allow them to move closer to the audience seated at a distance from the main stage. In November, Arashi released a theme song for the manga-based drama &quot;Hana Yori Dango&quot;, which starred Matsumoto as one of the lead actors. &quot;Wish&quot; went on to sell an estimated 178,000 copies in its first week and over 300,000 copies by the end of its chart run, making it their first single to sell over 300,000 copies in total in nearly three years since &quot;A Day in Our Life&quot; in 2002.

===2006: International activities in Asia===
By 2006, the group&#x27;s singles and albums were being released outside Japan. Their studio album, &quot;Arashic&quot;, was released not only in Japan, but also in Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. The album was successful in Korea as the first 10,000 copies of the album were sold out on the first day, and it even topped the non-Korean sales charts on the third week of July.

In the midst of Arashi&#x27;s summer concert tour &quot;Arachic Arashic Arasick Cool and Soul&quot;, the group embarked on a publicity tour around Asia called &quot;Jet Storm Tour&quot; on July 31. The group visited Taiwan, Thailand and South Korea, countries which later became part of their 2006 Asia tour, all in one day to hold press conferences and promote their &quot;Arashic&quot; album. For two days, September 16 and 17, Arashi held their first concerts in Taipei at the Taipei Arena.

Performing &quot;Arashi&quot;, &quot;Wish&quot; and &quot;Kitto Daijōbu&quot;, which was their first single release of the year, the group represented Japan in the 3rd annual Asia Song Festival in South Korea on September 22. Almost two months later, they became the first group from Johnny&#x27;s to perform individual concerts in South Korea. According to &quot;The Korea Times&quot;, the concerts in Korea were decided because about 1,500 Korean fans gathered at the Incheon International Airport during the group&#x27;s Jet Storm Tour. Arashi proved popular to Korean fans when their concert tickets were sold out in an hour, as some 150,000 people rushed to book tickets online.

The group traveled back to Japan and then released their second and final the single of the year &quot;Aozora Pedal&quot;, which was written and composed by Japanese musician Shikao Suga and used for Sakurai&#x27;s movie &quot;Honey and Clover&quot;. Although Arashi had planned to return to Thailand to hold a concert on October 7, it was canceled due to a military coup d&#x27;état.

===2007: Returning to the Japanese market===
On February 21, the group released their first single of the year, &quot;Love So Sweet&quot;, the theme song for the high-rating drama &quot;Hana Yori Dango 2&quot;, which peaked at the number-one spot on the &quot;Oricon&quot; daily and weekly charts. It is also Arashi&#x27;s first single to sell more than 200,000 copies in a week in almost five years. Their nineteenth single &quot;We Can Make It!&quot;, released on May 2, also charted number-one on the &quot;Oricon&quot; daily and weekly charts.

In April, the group performed in one of their largest concerts: &quot;Arashi Around Asia in Dome&quot;, a continuation of their Triumphant Homecoming concert held in January, which was aimed to celebrate the successful Asia tour. &quot;Arashi Around Asia in Dome&quot; was held at the Kyocera Dome in Osaka and at Tokyo Dome, making it Arashi&#x27;s first time performing there. On July 14, Arashi launched their summer tour titled &quot;Time – Kotoba no Chikara&quot; to support their seventh studio album &quot;Time&quot;. The album sold over 190,000 copies in its first week, not only extending the group&#x27;s string of number-one releases but also propelling the album to reach Platinum status by Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ).

Also in July, the TBS drama production of the manga &quot;Yamada Tarō Monogatari&quot;, which starred Ninomiya and Sakurai, began. Arashi sang the theme song of the drama, titled &quot;Happiness&quot;, and released it on September 5 as their third single of the year. The year proved successful for the group as all of their singles ranked within the Top 30 of the annual &quot;Oricon&quot; charts, with &quot;Love So Sweet&quot; ranking fourth in single sales overall, making it the group&#x27;s first single to rank within the Top 10 on the annual charts. &quot;Love So Sweet&quot; was also named one of &quot;The Best 10 Singles&quot; in the 22nd Japan Gold Disc Awards in 2008.

===2008: Rising popularity in Japan===
The group&#x27;s success in 2007 sparked renewed public interest. In February, Arashi released their first single of the year, &quot;Step and Go&quot;, which debuted at the top of the &quot;Oricon&quot; weekly chart for having sold 324,223 copies, making it as the group&#x27;s first single to exceed 300,000 copies sold in the first week since &quot;Sunrise Nippon/Horizon&quot; in 2000. The same month, it was announced that the group would be doing a concert tour of the five major domes in Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Sapporo. The tour, titled &quot;Arashi Marks 2008 Dream-A-Live&quot;, consisted of ten performances, from May 16 in Osaka to July 6 in Sapporo. The only other Johnny&#x27;s artists who have done a five dome tour were SMAP and KinKi Kids. The tour also coincided with their eighth studio album, &quot;Dream &quot;A&quot; Live&quot;, which was reported to be a hit with male buyers by &quot;Oricon&quot; despite the fact that most releases by Johnny&#x27;s artists are geared towards female teens and young adults. In the midst of the tour, Arashi released their twenty-second single &quot;One Love&quot;, the theme song for the last production of the &quot;Hana Yori Dango&quot; trilogy. Like &quot;Step and Go&quot;, the single sold over 300,000 copies in its first week and charted at number-one of the weekly singles chart.

As the start of the group&#x27;s second Asia tour, Arashi became the third musical group—after SMAP and Dreams Come True—to perform at the National Olympic Stadium in Tokyo as their first major outdoor concert on September 5. The first two legs of the tour included a return to Taipei and Seoul while the third leg was a first time trip to Shanghai. The concert in Shanghai also marked Johnny &amp; Associates&#x27; first concert in China. Almost a month after the release of &quot;One Love&quot;, their twenty-third single, &quot;Truth/Kaze no Mukō e&quot;, was released. Debuting atop of the &quot;Oricon&quot; weekly charts, the double A-side single sold 467,288 copies. Before the group&#x27;s concert in Shanghai on November 15, they released their fourth single of the year, &quot;Beautiful Days&quot;, which was used as the theme song for Ninomiya&#x27;s drama &quot;Ryūsei no Kizuna&quot;. Although &quot;Beautiful Days&quot; only had a little over a month to chart before the &quot;Oricon&quot; charting period for 2008 ended on December 11, the single managed to climb up to be the tenth best-selling single of the year. Their concert DVD &quot;Summer Tour 2007 Final Time - Kotoba no Chikara&quot;, released on April 16, also ranked as the second best-selling music DVD of 2008 and ranked sixth place in the general DVD category.

===2009: 10th anniversary===
The group released two double A-side singles, &quot;Believe/Kumorinochi, Kaisei&quot; and &quot;Ashita no Kioku/Crazy Moon (Kimi wa Muteki)&quot;, on March 4 and May 27 respectively. Both singles sold over 500,000 copies in first week sales, making Arashi the first artist to have two consecutive singles exceed the 500,000 mark within a week in seven years seven months since Keisuke Kuwata.

At the end of June, Arashi announced their tenth anniversary tour &quot;Arashi Anniversary Tour 5x10&quot;, which included three consecutive shows at the National Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. They became the first artist to play at the stadium for three consecutive days. Their third single of the year, &quot;Everything&quot;, was released on July 1 and sold nearly 342,000 copies in the first week. On August 19, Arashi released their greatest hits album &quot;All the Best! 1999–2009&quot;, which featured most of their singles since debut, a new song with lyrics written by the members themselves, and a limited edition third disc containing ten of the group&#x27;s selections. The album sold over 753,000 copies in the first week. Thirteen days after the release, the album broke the one million mark, a first in Arashi&#x27;s history. It became the first album of 2009 to break one million.

On November 11, Arashi released &quot;My Girl&quot; as their last single of the year. It debuted atop of the &quot;Oricon&quot; daily chart by selling about 178,000 copies on the first day and about 432,000 copies by the end of its first week. It was announced on November 17 that Arashi had thus monopolized the top four best first-week sales for singles of 2009.

On November 20, Arashi held an event organized by House Foods called &quot;Arashi in Tokyo DisneySea Premium Event&quot;. Reserving the entire theme park for one night, the group performed a special medley of Christmas songs and their own songs such as &quot;Arashi&quot; and &quot;One Love&quot;, which made the Arashi the first celebrity to sing their own songs at Tokyo DisneySea.

Arashi attended the 60th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen on New Year&#x27;s Eve, making it not only the group&#x27;s first time performing on the show but also the first time in twenty-one years another group from Johnny&#x27;s other than SMAP and Tokio, the two traditional participants, performed at Kōhaku.

===2010: Continued success===
On January 5, it was announced that Arashi would provide the song &quot;Yurase, Ima o&quot; as the theme song for the 2010 Winter Olympics news coverage on NTV. On January 6, Sakurai announced that Arashi would provide the theme song &quot;Troublemaker&quot; for his then-upcoming comedy drama. The next day, &quot;Mezamashi TV&quot; aired the first preview of the theme song for the drama special &quot;Saigo no Yakusoku&quot;, the group&#x27;s first drama together in nearly ten years. The theme song &quot;Sora Takaku&quot; was announced during the press conference for the drama special on December 15, 2009. Of the three newly recorded songs, only &quot;Troublemaker&quot; and &quot;Yurase, Ima o&quot; were included in the group&#x27;s first single of the year released on March 3, with &quot;Troublemaker&quot; being the A-side song.

On February 24, the 24th Japan Gold Disc Awards awarded Arashi the &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; prize and nine other awards in various categories. As a result, they became the first artist to win ten awards at once.

It was announced on April 5 that Arashi would provide the theme song &quot;Monster&quot;, which was released on May 19 as a single, for Ohno&#x27;s fantasy comedy drama based on Fujiko Fujio&#x27;s manga series &quot;Kaibutsu-kun&quot;. On May 24, &quot;Monster&quot; debuted at number-one on the &quot;Oricon&quot; weekly chart selling 543,000 copies in its first week, making Arashi the first act to have thirty consecutive singles rank in &quot;Oricon&#x27;s&quot; weekly Top 3 since their debut.

On June 5, it was announced that the group was to release their first studio album in two years and four months since &quot;Dream &quot;A&quot; Live&quot; (April 2008) and hold a nationwide concert tour at the National Olympic Stadium in Tokyo for four days and the five major domes in Osaka, Sapporo, Tokyo, Nagoya and Fukuoka. Although the four days are not consecutive, Arashi became the first to hold four concerts at the National Olympic Stadium in the same tour.

The group&#x27;s song &quot;Love Rainbow&quot; was used as the theme song for the romance drama starring Matsumoto and Yūko Takeuchi. &quot;To Be Free&quot;, Arashi&#x27;s third single of 2010, became the group&#x27;s twentieth consecutive number-one single since &quot;Pikanchi Double&quot; (2004) on July 13. Together with Ohno&#x27;s solo single , which was released on the same day as &quot;To Be Free&quot; and placed at number-two, Arashi and Ohno accomplished the rare feat of a group and a solo artist from the group simultaneously taking the top two spots for the first time in nearly ten years.

Arashi provided the theme song &quot;Dear Snow&quot; for the live-action movie adaptation of the award-winning &quot;Ōoku: The Inner Chambers&quot; manga starring Ninomiya and Kou Shibasaki. On August 10, Arashi&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Boku no Miteiru Fūkei&quot; placed at number-one on the &quot;Oricon&quot; weekly album chart, selling around 731,000 copies. The album maintained its number-one spot in the second week, making it Arashi&#x27;s first studio album to lead the &quot;Oricon&quot; weekly album chart for two consecutive weeks. By selling around another 125,000 copies, the album has sold a total of 856,000 copies. In September, Japan Airlines (JAL) launched a domestic Boeing 777-200 bearing both the images of the members of Arashi and the title of their &quot;Boku no Miteiru Fūkei&quot; album, which was sold with a specially designed cover in-flight.

The film was recognized as the first live film in history to reach No. 1 at the domestic box office, as well as being the No. 1 grossing live film of all time by a domestic artist. In March 2022, the film was redistributed in Japan, and screened also in the United States. On December 23, 2023 it was revealed that the film would be screened nationwide on New Years Eve, as a &quot;vocal support screening&quot;, a first for Dolby Cinemas. It will display a special message from the group&#x27;s members before the screening. They also released &quot;Arafes 2020 at National Stadium&quot; on Blu-ray and DVD on July 28, 2021. It topped the Oricon video chart with first-week sales of 647,783 copies.

Arashi had success on the charts in 2021 with the release of the digital albums &quot;Ura Ara Best (1999–2007, 2008–2011, 2012–2015, 2016–2020)&quot; and &quot;5×20 All the Best!! 1999–2019 (Special Edition)&quot; on July 16. The five albums occupied the top five of the Oricon Weekly Digital Album Ranking chart in the week after release, making it the first time the band monopolized the top five on a Japanese chart.

Arashi released &quot;This Is Arashi Live 2020.12.31&quot; on December 29, 2021. According to Oricon, it achieved first place in three video categories at the same time with first-week sales of 637,000 copies and with this, their works have had sales of more than 500,000 copies in the first week for nine consecutive years.

Until 2023, Arashi was one of the Johnny&#x27;s groups that appeared in a large quantity of commercials, either as a group or as individuals. That ended in September, after the Johnny Kitagawa sexual assault hearings. Most of the businesses that held commercial contracts with Johnny&#x27;s announced that they would stop using Johnny&#x27;s talent in their commercials and promos, while only a few where considering to continue, depending on the agency&#x27;s actions. Among the companies that decided to stop using Johnny&#x27;s talent, either permanently or temporarily, that have ties to Arashi and the members, are Morinaga, Asahi, Tokio Marine Nichido, Kao, Daiichi Sankyo, and JAL. As of 14 September 2023, only Aflac Japan declared the possibility of an individual contract for Sakurai., while JCB recognized the 13-year history they had with Ninomiya and lamented having to let him go for the time being.

After the press conference given by J&amp;A&#x27;s new president and vicepresident, Noriyuki Higashiyama and Yoshihiko Inohara, respectively, on October 2, where the future of the agency was revealed, Sakurai, as Monday&#x27;s newscaster in NTV&#x27;s News Zero, the same day of the conference, revealed that the 5 members had been in contact and had been briefed about some of the decisions taken by the agency. When asked by main caster Yumiko Udo about the plans of the group, given the possibility of establishing individual or group contracts with the new agency that would be responsible of the talent, as stated in the conference, Sakurai replied, &quot;Is it a contract between the new company and an individual corporation, or Arashi Co., Ltd.? Is it a contract with the group, the individual. or both? I think we need to put all the possible options on the table and think carefully.&quot; All members, except for Ohno, have continued to have individual works, so the decision taken could affect the outcome of the group as a whole.

Ninomiya announced he would become independent from the agency on 24 October 2023. Regarding his participation as member of Arashi, he said he would continue to work together with the rest when they resume activities, stating that he would continue being part of Arashi from the following day and as long as Arashi exists.

===2024: Hiatus in the year of the 25th Anniversary===

The group donated ¥67.5 million yen to support the victims of the January 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake. This came after discussions the members had on how they could provide assistance. Arashi posted a heartfelt message on their social media accounts, signing off with each one of the members&#x27; names at the end. The money came from the December 31, 2023 special screening of their concert movie &quot;ARASHI Anniversary Tour 5×20 FILM “Record of Memories”&quot;

On April 10, 2024, the fan club received a report that Arashi had established a company with the five members that was later shared on Starto Entertainment&#x27;s website. The report featured wording that referred to independent activities and decision-taking while considering the fans that have continued to support them. The news of this report resulted in spiking trends across SNS and social media that remained hopeful for news of the group&#x27;s return to the music scene.

On April 12, 2024, Oricon released its &quot;Reiwa Ranking&quot; lists. Arashi&#x27;s album &quot;5×20 All the BEST!! 1999-2019&#x27; won first place in the &quot;Album sales ranking&quot; for the 5-year period, with over 2 million units sold. In the Music DVD / BluRay division, Arashi&#x27;s &quot;ARASHI Anniversary Tour 5×20&quot; took the first place in the BluRay ranking, with 639,964 units sold, while it, &quot;5×20 All the BEST!! CLIPS 1999-2019&quot; and &quot;Arafes 2020 at Japan&#x27;s National Stadium&quot; took the 3 top spots in the Music DVD / BluRay combined ranking, with a sales total of 1,073,982, 849,263 and 784,360 units, respectively.

On April 19, 2024, lawyer Takashi Shinomiya, representative director of Arashi&#x27;s company, posted on his X (previously Twitter) that a group agent contract had been established between Arashi and Starto. A similar contract was eatablished by Tokio, making Arashi the second group with a group agent contract with the new agency.

Although still on hiatus, and with no news about a return to the concert arenas, Arashi is still active behind the scenes, as they celebrate their 25th anniversary. In a message to their fan club, and later revealed through their social media, on September 15, 2024, Arashi shared 6 projects they have to celebrate their anniversary with the fans:
* 12 concerts that were in DVDs, made into Bluray to be released on November 3

==Filmography==

Aside from their music careers, Arashi has also appeared in dramas and movies, done radio shows, commercials, and acted as the main hosts for events. A short Fuji TV drama called &quot;V no Arashi&quot; became one of the group&#x27;s first activities together as it was broadcast just about a month after the announcement of their formation in Hawaii. Although it would not be until 2010 would the group act in another drama together titled &quot;Saigo no Yakusoku&quot;, they have worked together on movies in 2002, 2004, and 2007.

Since 2001, Arashi has hosted their own variety shows, starting with &quot;Mayonaka no Arashi&quot; on NTV.

Besides their NTV television specials that would air almost twice a year around 7:00 p.m. (JST), Arashi did not have any variety shows that aired during primetime until TBS gave the group their first primetime show titled &quot;Himitsu no Arashi-chan&quot; in 2008. In 2010, NTV began to broadcast another Arashi-hosted primetime show titled &quot;Arashi ni Shiyagare&quot;, which aired every Saturday at 10:00 p.m JST.

The group split their donations between the Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures, with each one receiving about 100 million yen. About 50 million yen comprises the members’ total royalties received from the sale of the pocket edition of their book &quot;Nippon no Arashi&quot;.

The single was released in digital form on June 22, and on CD on August 12.

===Waku-Waku School of Arashi===
After the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in March, Arashi considered canceling their &quot;ARASHI LIVE TOUR Beautiful World&quot; concerts scheduled from June 24 to 26, 2011, at Tokyo Dome. However, in April, they decided to use those three days to hold charity events instead. Part of the proceeds from a possible total audience of 225,000 were donated to charity. The release of a pocket-sized version of their book &quot;Nippon no Arashi&quot;, which originally distributed to 40,000 schools in 2010, was also announced on May 19, 2011. All of the revenue was donated to charity.

As part of that tour, Arashi started the &quot;Waku-Waku School of Arashi&quot; as a charity event, and repeated it every year since until 2019.

In all of the events, one of the members would offer the &quot;class&quot; as teacher, while the rest of the members acted as students. Starting in 2015, other Johnny&#x27;s groups&#x27; members would participate as students / assistants to Arashi.

<doc id="489307" wikidata="Q1153920" url="?curid=489307" title="Tsuzuki-ku, Yokohama">
<text>is one of the 18 wards of the city of Yokohama in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of 2010, the ward had an estimated population of 199,258 and a density of 7,130 persons per km2. The total area was 27.93 km2.

==Geography==
Tsuzuki Ward is located in eastern Kanagawa Prefecture, and north of the geographic center of the city of Yokohama.

===Surrounding municipalities===
*Kōhoku Ward
*Midori Ward
*Aoba Ward

==History==
The area around present-day Tsuzuki Ward was formerly part of Tsutsuki District in Musashi Province. During the Edo period, it was a rural region classified as &quot;tenryō&quot; territory controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, but administered through various &quot;hatamoto&quot;. After the Meiji Restoration, the area became part of the new Kanagawa Prefecture. In the cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, the area was divided into numerous villages. In April 1939, the area was annexed by the neighboring city of Yokohama, becoming part of Kōhoku Ward. In a major administrative reorganization of October 1, 1969, Kōhoku was divided, with parts of the present-day area of Tsuzuki becoming part of the new Midori-ku. On November 6, 1994, Kōhoku and Midori were recombined, and then re-divided into four Wards (Kōhoku, Midori, Tsuzuki and Aoba). The division and re-division of Wards has much to do with the development of northern Yokohama by railroad companies. The opening of the Tōkyū Den-en-toshi Line and associated residential communities led to the rapid suburban development in this region. This was followed by the project in the 1980s and early 1990s. The core of the Kōhoku New Town became a significant commercial centre once the subway line extension between Shin-Yokohama and Azamino was completed in 1993. The influx of new population resulted in the entire “Kōhoku New Town” being re-organized into the new Tsuzuki Ward.

==Economy==
Tsuzuki Ward is primarily a regional commercial center and bedroom community for central Yokohama, Kawasaki and Tokyo. There is some light manufacturing and residual agriculture. Prior to World War II, the area was known for its production of chrysanthemums. Car Make T&amp;E and Weld X Overdose Techniques Factory are headquartered in Tsuzuki Ward.

Larry was born in Maryborough Qld. He was a champion swimmer but was lured to the sport of basketball by his primary school teacher Ray Alloway.

<text>The Yunokawa Onsen (湯の川温泉) is a well known onsen in Japan on the northern island of Hokkaidō. It is located on the outskirts of Hakodate city close to Hakodate Airport.

==History==
In the Ainu language, the meaning of Yunokawa is a hot spring river.

This onsen is considered by Japanese to be one of the three major hot springs in Hokkaidō. Its origins are said to date back to 1653 when a lord of the Matsumae clan was healed of an incurable illness by bathing in its waters. Legend says that Seiryoin (清涼院), the 9th Lord of Matsumae Domain&#x27;s mother, had him bathe for medical purposes in the Yunokawa Onsen in 1653. Having recovered from illness, and she had the Yakushido (薬師堂) rebuilt to honor his recovery and it was dedicated to Waniguchi (鰐口).

==Water profile==

The hot spring water contains various minerals including sodium, calcium chloride and sulphur.

Most of the slightly reddish hot spring water from this Onsen contains sodium, calcium, and chloride. It is believed the water can treat nerve and joint pains, fatigue, sprains, women’s diseases, among other health problems.

==Features==
In the nearby Hakodate city area there is a tropical botanical garden where a population of Japanese snow monkeys live. In colder months, the monkeys frequently use the hot springs on the garden grounds.

<doc id="489321" wikidata="Q651753" url="?curid=489321" title="Paradise Kiss">
<text>Paradise Kiss is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Ai Yazawa. It appeared as a serial in Shodensha&#x27;s fashion magazine &quot;&quot; from March 1999 to March 2003, with its chapters collected in five volumes. A 12-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Aniplex and studio Madhouse, aired on Fuji TV&#x27;s Noitamina programming block from October to December 2005. A live-action film adaptation was released in Japan in 2011.

==Plot==
Yukari Hayasaka, a third-year student at an elite college preparatory high school, is under pressure from her mother to study for her exams and enter college. On her way to school, she catches the attention of Paradise Kiss, a fashion collective of four senior students from Yazawa School of Arts: Miwako, Arashi, Isabella, and their leader, George. The students attempt to recruit Yukari as a model for their senior project at the school&#x27;s upcoming fashion showcase, but she initially rejects them. Yukari later comes to understand the students&#x27; passion for fashion, admiring how they are able to live freely, and agrees to become their model.

As Yukari spends more time at Paradise Kiss&#x27; studio, she begins skipping cram school to help with sewing beads onto their dress. At the same time, she becomes drawn to George, and the two immediately fall into a whirlwind romance. Despite their mutual attraction, Yukari finds herself frustrated at George&#x27;s unpredictable and twisted behavior, as well as him prioritizing career and independence over love. Inspired to be true to herself, Yukari tells her mother the truth but runs away from home and drops out of school after she opposes her decision. Yukari gets a job modeling for Miwako&#x27;s sister&#x27;s brand, Happy Berry, which connects her to a modeling agency, but they are unable to sign her without her parents&#x27; permission. After an encounter with George&#x27;s negligent mother, Yukari begins to understand him more and returns home, convincing her mother to allow her to become a model and attending school once again.

Once Paradise Kiss completes their dress, Yukari models it at the senior project showcase. Despite the praise, they win only second place. As graduation draws near, Paradise Kiss sees little outside success and sells only one dress at a co-signment shop. Meanwhile, George is undecided about his career path, but his friend and senior, Kaori, visits him to convince him to continue studying design, which causes Yukari to become jealous. By graduation, Paradise Kiss disbands. George decides to study design in Paris and invites Yukari to come with him, but Yukari declines due to her budding modeling career. Realizing that their lifestyles are incompatible and their relationship will progress no further, the two become distant and quietly move on with their lives. Yukari hopes to become a model in Paris to be with him once again.

10 years later, Yukari is unable to become a model in Paris but pursues other career paths in entertainment in Japan. She is also married to her classmate, Hiroyuki, and they are invited to watch a Broadway show with costumes designed by George.

==Characters==
: 
: Yukari is a third-year high school student at a prestigious school under pressure from her strict mother to study for her university entrance exams. Her routinely, mundane life changes when she meets the members of Paradise Kiss, and while she initially is condescending towards them, she comes to admire their dedication towards their dreams. Through Paradise Kiss, Yukari slowly begins to realize her own identity and independence, eventually deciding to pursue modelling. At the same time, Yukari falls into an intense romance with Paradise Kiss&#x27; leader, George, and throughout their time together, she struggles between expressing her true feelings for him and trying to match his ideals. She is nicknamed &quot;Caroline&quot; by Miwako and &quot;Carrie&quot; by Isabella. In the end, after George goes to Paris to study fashion design, Yukari moves on with her life as a model and marries Hiroyuki. In the live-action film, she rejects Hiroyuki and finds George again while on a modelling job in New York.
: 
: Nicknamed , he is a senior at Yazawa School of Arts with a gift for fashion design, particularly in haute couture. Although his personality can appear cold, he lives like a hedonist and has extravagant ideas on everything, most of which are not accepted by the mainstream. George is bisexual, describing himself as an &quot;equal opportunity lover&quot;. He refers to Yukari as both his muse and a tease. He explains his manipulative behavior as his desire for her to become an independent woman that makes her own decisions and takes responsibility for them. George&#x27;s appearance is loosely based on Brian Slade of &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;. Yukari humorously questions if he is actually an alien because of his distinctive blue hair and eyes. George is alternately cold and warm to Yukari, confusing her and causing intense fights between the two of them. The lifestyle that he lives is that of a wealthy young bachelor with a high-end loft apartment and a vintage Jaguar. George&#x27;s wealthy father pays for his living arrangements and tuition at Yazagaku, though he rarely sees him because his mother was only a mistress. His mother, a former fashion model, often complains that he looks and acts just like his father despite his intense disdain for him. In the end, after Paradise Kiss fails to sell a single dress, he goes with Isabella to Paris to pursue fashion design. He mails Yukari a key to the storage unit that stores all of the clothing that he&#x27;s designed, including the fashion show dress. In the anime and manga, George sends Yukari and her husband a ticket to a broadway show where he served as costume designer. In the live action movie, it&#x27;s revealed that he&#x27;s kept the magazines that Yukari has modelled in, and they kiss when she finds his studio again. 
: 
:Miwako is a third-year student at Yazawa School of Arts who first appeared in &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot;. A member of Paradise Kiss, Miwako is the younger sister of Mikako Kouda, the protagonist of &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot; and the founder of the fashion brand Happy Berry. She carries around a jar of candy that makes her feel better by reminding her of how she is loved.
: 
:Arashi is a third-year student at Yazawa School of Arts who first appeared in a side story of &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot;. He is the son of Risa Kanzaki, a character from &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot;, who has a punk rock aesthetic and plays in a band. Arashi is the most level-headed memeber of Paradise Kiss who offers a practical and realistic perspective towards Yukari and the others. While Arashi is childhood friends with Miwako and Hiroyuki, he is in love with Miwako and initially forced himself on her to keep her from entering a romantic relationship with Hiroyuki, to whom he feels inferior towards. Because of his jealousy and fear of losing Miwako, he forbids her from contacting Hiroyuki. At the end of the series, Arashi has reconciled his friendship with Hiroyuki and married Miwako, having a daughter together.
: 
:Isabella is the mother figure to the members of ParaKiss. Isabella was born into a wealthy family and was the inspiration for George&#x27;s very first dress during childhood, becoming his first client. She often had the habit of taking every piece of clothing that he finished. As a child, she had always wanted gorgeous dresses, and George was the one that fulfilled her wish. Isabella provides a source of support to Yukari when she needs it the most, whether it be regarding her relationship with George or choice to abandon her studies. Isabella is a transgender woman and she is mortified when anyone refers to her as her birth name.
: 
:Hiroyuki is a third-year student who first appeared in a side story of &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot;. Yukari&#x27;s classmate, an intelligent and handsome prodigy who is the object of Yukari&#x27;s affections at the beginning of the story. Hiroyuki was once in love with Miwako, but Arashi forbade her from seeing him. He gives advice to Arashi on how to come to terms with his feelings for Miwako and his past actions and soon after the three of them mend their friendship. Hiroyuki is at the top of his class and aspires to become a physician. He eventually falls for Yukari, and foolishly assumed that a girl like her would never show interest in him.

=====Second English release=====


===Anime===
Produced by Fuji TV, Aniplex, Dentsu, Shodensha and Madhouse, the &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot; anime series was broadcast on Fuji TV&#x27;s Noitamina programming block from October 14 to December 30, 2005. It was directed by Osamu Kobayashi, who also wrote the series scripts. Nobuteru Yūki served as character designer and chief animation director, while noted fashion creator Atsurō Tayama designed the outfits and THE BABYS and Narasaki (of &quot;Coaltar of the Deepers&quot;) composed the music. The anime was licensed for release in North America by Geneon Entertainment. On July 3, 2008, Geneon and Funimation Entertainment announced an agreement to distribute select titles in North America. While Geneon retained the license, Funimation Entertainment assumed exclusive rights to the manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of select titles. &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot; was one of several titles involved in the deal. Funimation let the license expire in 2011.

The opening theme song is &quot;Lonely in Gorgeous&quot; by Tomoko Kawase (as alter ego Tommy february6). The ending theme features Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s hit song &quot;Do You Want To&quot;. Both songs appear on the &quot;Paradise Kiss Original Soundtrack&quot; released on December 21, 2005.

====Production====
In an interview in the January, 2007 issue of &quot;Newtype USA&quot;, director Kobayashi revealed many of the personal decisions which went into restructuring the manga into a television series. Wanting to avoid straying too far from the source material without approval, Kobayashi worked closely with Ai Yazawa on the new interpretations of the characters. In many instances, Yazawa was concerned that taking the original material straight would distract casual viewers or worse drive them away. Chief among these concerns was the handling of George&#x27;s bisexual nature and interest in sadomasochism. Yazawa agreed that the dialogue should reflect this, but that actual onscreen depictions (as can be found in the original manga) were to be avoided. However, Kobayashi felt this was not being entirely true to the character, so he included a few hints of this side of George in the final episode. In another instance of modification, this time brought by Kobayashi, the character design of Arashi was modified to suit a scruffier, less slick appearance. &quot;I wanted to make him look like Lupin the 3rd... sort of slouching and walking around with his hands in his pockets,&quot; Kobayashi explained. In agreement with the director, Yazawa went for the change.

One area Yazawa and Kobayashi did not agree on was the casting of Shunsuke Mizutani as Arashi. The fact that he was not a professional voice actor, but rather a musician, was the cause of this debate. Kobayashi had wanted a more natural performance that did not sound like the typical voice acting found in anime. &quot;Yazawa and I even had a few rows because of that,&quot; Kobayashi explains. &quot;But after she&#x27;d seen about three episodes, she finally admitted that Mizutani&#x27;s voice is a great match, and I was able to relax.&quot;

In relation to the clothing design, despite Tayama&#x27;s involvement with all of George&#x27;s outfits, most of the clothing was left largely as originally depicted in the manga. Director Kobayashi had specifically requested a real designer to work on the project, and Tayama&#x27;s role on the production had originally been conceived as reworking the designs to fit better with the real world, but much to everyone&#x27;s surprise, the original manga designs by Ai Yazawa were already quite good. So, Tayama mostly was involved in updating the clothes to suit the very latest hot trends, and touching up the designs to make them look and behave realistically when animated. He also provided cloth samples and photographs with all of his illustrations to aid the animators with getting the textures right. Besides George&#x27;s outfits, the majority of clothing for the other characters was designed by art director and stylist Asami Kiyokawa. After the rough designs were completed, texture artist Yoshikazu Suehiro drew all of the textures and lace by hand, and then scanned them into the computer and digitally applied them as textures during the animation coloring process.

====Episodes====
===Live-action film===

Together with the Japanese production company IMJ, Fox International produced a live-action, Japanese-language film based on &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot;; the film had an estimated budget of US$3–4 million.

The live-action film features Keiko Kitagawa as Yukari Hayasaka and Osamu Mukai as George. Other cast members are Natsuki Katō as Kaori Aso, Aya Ōmasa as Miwako Sakurada, Kento Kaku as Arashi Nagase, Shunji Igarashi as Isabella Yamamoto, and Yūsuke Yamamoto as Tokumori Hiroyuki.

The film was released in Japan in June 2011. It featured the songs &quot;Hello (Paradise Kiss)&quot; and &quot;You&quot; by Yui.

==Reception==
Melissa Sternenberg of THEM Anime Reviews called the character designs and animation &quot;fresh and appealing&quot; with the closing and opening sequences &quot;some of the best of the Fall 2005 season,&quot; and praised the animation and artwork, especially the fashion designs. However, she felt the series went wrong in cramming the story into 12 episodes, saying 26 episodes would have been better, and said that she disliked the main characters. However, she said that the sentimentality of ParaKiss seems to &quot;accurately reflect the real fashion world&quot;.

Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network had a more positive view, saying that apart from the established characters, the show&#x27;s true star is the &quot;costume design&quot; which is shown in much detail, with a &quot;delicate balancing of realism with drama.&quot; He said that the treatment of the series is &quot;unusually thoughtful&quot;, and that the series is &quot;about being young...having dreams...[and] romance.&quot; He called the series a &quot;refreshingly mature story&quot;, but said it is not for &quot;those in search of reassuring escapism.&quot;

In 2024, through a survey of 100 people by &quot;TV Maga&quot; (a web magazine operated by ), &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot; was voted second for most fashionable manga, along with &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot;, another series by Yazawa.

<doc id="489322" wikidata="Q1137848" url="?curid=489322" title="Every Little Thing (band)">
<text>Every Little Thing (also known as ELT by their fans) is a pop/soft rock duo from 
Japan who debuted in August 1996 with the release of their first single called &quot;Feel My Heart&quot;. Their name is usually written in English, and only rarely in &quot;katakana&quot;. They gained massive popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As of 2013, Every Little Thing has sold over 23 million copies of singles and albums throughout Japan. Their second studio album, &quot;Time to Destination&quot;, is the best-selling album of the band with over 3.5 million copies sold, and became the 10th best-selling album of all time in Japan.

Every Little Thing was originally a trio but became a duo in 2000 with Kaori Mochida as the singer and Ichiro Ito as the guitarist. Mitsuru Igarashi left ELT following the release of their third original album, &quot;Eternity&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early careers===
Ito began playing guitar in local bands around the US Yokota Air Base in Fussa, Tokyo, performing cover versions of songs by rock acts like Van Halen to local sailors. He initially intended to play drums.

Mochida made her debut as a baby in an advertisement for diapers as her mom hoped she would enter the entertainment business. In 1991, at the age of 13, she joined the eight-member girl group The Kuro Buta All-Stars. Though not successful, the experience convinced her to record a two track demo, featuring the two songs, &quot;Mouichido&quot; (The Kuro Buta All-Stars) and a cover song from 1970s/1980s singer-songwriter Mariya Takeuchi.

She sent the demo to Avex Trax, where Mitsuru Igarashi was a producer looking for a girl for a new duo with him as the keyboardist. Impressed by her strong yet sweet voice, Igarashi asked her to join as a duo, and then asked his guitarist friend Ichiro Ito, then working as a studio receptionist, to help on the first single &quot;Feel My Heart&quot;, created by Igarashi. Ito, over ten years Mochida&#x27;s senior, has said that when first meeting the young Mochida wearing gyaru style thick platform boots, he didn&#x27;t even know how to strike up conversation.

===Debut and success===
The band released their debut single &quot;Feel My Heart&quot; on August 7, 1996. The single peaked at number 24 on the Oricon charts. Their first studio album, called &quot;Everlasting&quot; was a big success, selling nearly two million copies in Japan, and marking ELT as a popular group with a bright future. The band reached number 1 at the Oricon charts for the first time with their fourth single, &quot;For the Moment.&quot;

Their second studio album, entitled &quot;Time to Destination&quot;, was released on April 15, 1998, and it became one of the best-selling albums of that year, with over 3.5 million copies sold. The album ended up being the band&#x27;s best-selling album, as well as the 10th best-selling album of all time in Japan. This album also included their best-selling single, &quot;Time Goes By&quot;, which reached nearly 1.15 million copies sold.

===Departure of Igarashi and change in sound===
Upon the release of the third studio album, &quot;Eternity&quot;, released in March 2000, Mitsuru Igarashi suddenly decided to leave the band. Ito later said that the decision was dropped on them without warning, right before a tour, and it forced them to change their sound. The remaining duo decided to tour acoustically for the next two years in order to find their feet, but also enjoyed more creative freedom over the songs. The single &quot;Rescue me&quot; was the last that Igarashi participated in and with the release of their 16th single, &quot;Ai no Kakera&quot; in October 2000, ELT transitioned their style from Igarashi&#x27;s signature synthesized pop-rock sound to a more acoustic soft-rock sound. Their single &quot;Fragile&quot; released on New Year&#x27;s Day 2001 became ELT&#x27;s second biggest hit ever, vindicating their new direction, selling approximately 829,580 copies; its c/w song &quot;Jirenma&quot; was one of the ending songs for the anime movie &quot;Initial D Third Stage&quot;. their fourth album and first as a duo, &quot;4 Force&quot;, was released on March 22, 2001. The album was their first not to top the Japanese Oricon charts, but still managed to sell more than a million copies and was awarded as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; at the Japan Gold Disc Awards.

In 2003 the band released their fifth album, &quot;Many Pieces&quot;, which topped the Oricon charts. The album had five promotional singles prior to its release, including &quot;Jump&quot;, the first attempt of Mochida in music composing, &quot;Untitled: 4 Ballads&quot;, their number one EP which got platinum status in Japan, and also &quot;Grip!&quot;, which was used as an opening theme of anime television series &quot;InuYasha&quot;.

In November 2004 the duo released their single &quot;Koibumi&quot; that was a surprise for many, because it performed comparatively well on the charts, selling more than many of their previous singles. In 2005 they released only one single, the soft rock song &quot;Kimi no Te&quot;, and the acoustic compilation album &quot;Acoustic : Latte&quot;.

During Every Little Thing&#x27;s 2004–2005 &quot;Commonplace Tour&quot;, Mochida suffered from bronchitis which further affected her singing style during the tour as well as on their 7th album, &quot;Crispy Park&quot;, released on August 9, 2006 (their 10th anniversary day). Mochida’s singing style has changed slightly on every album, going from a clear, soothing voice to a high and cuter voice. A 2006–2007 concert tour followed their tenth anniversary album release. Their 31st single, &quot;Swimmy&quot;, theme song for the drama series &quot;Kekkon Dekinai Otoko&quot;, was released in October 2006.

===Tenth anniversary and solo endeavours===
For celebrating their tenth anniversary, Every Little Thing held a two-day special live at the Nippon Budokan on March 6 and 7, 2006. Their 2008 album &quot;Door&quot; released on March 5, 2008 peaked at number 2 on the Oricon charts. Mochida has said of the album, that &quot;I used to sing without thinking. But now I convey thoughts that are hard to explain when I communicate with people in my daily life. It&#x27;s harder than before; but we reap much more joy.&quot;

On November 20, 2008, it was announced that Mochida would be starting a solo career in 2009, but both she and Itoh would continue as a duo. In this period both members released solo material. Mochida released her first solo album, &quot;Moka&quot; on August 12, 2009, and also participated briefly in the special unit Caocao, along with Takao Tajima, member of Original Love. On August 5, 2009, Ito released a mini-album on his own titled &quot;Diversity&quot;, which featured vocals of Idoling!!!, Ayuse Kozue, and others.

In 2009, after nine years of departed ways, Every Little Thing began working again with former band member Mitsuru Igarashi. Igarashi composed and produced several songs on the band&#x27;s ninth album &quot;Change&quot;, released in March 2010, including its three promotional singles: &quot;Dream Goes On&quot;, &quot;Tsumetai Ame&quot; and the album title song.

In July, 2011, the band released their 41st single &quot;Sora/Koe&quot;. Both songs were used as theme songs of the 2011 &quot;Pokémon&quot; movie. On September 21, 2011, the band released their tenth album, &quot;Ordinary&quot;, which debuted at number 2 on the Oricon charts.

As of 2013 they are on tour promoting their On N On single which portrays a timeline of their current performance history. Concert information and dates available at Avex trex official site, https://web.archive.org/web/20121224083337/http://www.avexnet.or.jp/elt/live.html

<doc id="489323" wikidata="Q3787266" url="?curid=489323" title="Jugemu">
<text>is a famous story, a form of Japanese spoken entertainment. It has a simple story, with the most humorous part being the repetition of a ridiculously long name. It is often used in training for entertainers.

==Plot==

A couple could not think of a suitable name for their newborn son. The father went to the local temple and asked the chief priest to think of an auspicious name. The priest suggested &quot;Jugemu&quot; (), and several other names. The father could not decide which name he preferred, and therefore, gave the baby all of the names.

Jugemu&#x27;s full name is:

&lt;poem&gt;



&lt;/poem&gt;
(the NHK version, partially replaced with kanji)

In one version of the tale, Jugemu got into a fight with a friend one day, and the friend suffered a large bump on his head. In protest, he went crying to Jugemu&#x27;s parents. However, due to the amount of time it took to recite his name, by the time he finished, the bump on his head had already healed.

Another version states that Jugemu fell into a well and drowned; everyone who had to pass along the news spent a lot of time reciting his entire name. In yet another variant, Jugemu fell into a lake, and his parents barely arrived in time to save him.

==Interpretation of Jugemu&#x27;s name==
Each part of Jugemu&#x27;s name that the priest had suggested has an auspicious meaning:

; Jugemu
: &quot;limitless life&quot;.
; Gokō-no Surikire
: &quot;five of rubbing off (the rock)&quot;. In Japanese Buddhist lore, a heavenly maiden would visit the human world once in every three thousand years, leaving friction marks on a huge rock with her dress. Eventually, the rock would wear down to nothing in the span of one , or 4 billion () years. The priest thus blesses the child to live at least 20 billion () years, essentially for eternity.
; Kaijarisuigyo
: &quot;gravel in the sea and fish in water&quot;. The amount of gravel and number of fish in the world is meant to represent the degree of the child&#x27;s luck and fortune.
; Suigyōmatsu
: &quot;where water eventually goes&quot;. Because water is free to go anywhere, the child is blessed with boundless well-being wherever he goes.
; Unraimatsu
: &quot;where clouds originally come&quot;. Because clouds come from anywhere, this is similar to the above.
; Fūraimatsu
: &quot;where wind originally comes&quot;. Similar to the above.
; Kuunerutokoro
: &quot;places to eat and sleep&quot;. It is fortunate to have both food and shelter at any time.
; Sumutokoro
: &quot;places to live&quot;. Same as above.
; Yaburakōji-no burakōji
: &quot;&quot;Ardisia japonica&quot; (marlberry) bushes in Yabura Trail&quot;. The plant&#x27;s modern Japanese name is , and it is considered to be imbued with energy year-round. has no inherent meaning, but is inferred to be with the pluralizing suffix.
; Paipo, Shūringan, Gūrindai, Ponpokopī, Ponpokonā
: These are invented names of a kingdom and royal family in Ancient China. Paipo was a rich and peaceful kingdom, where King Shūringan and Queen Gūrindai reigned. They gave birth to Princess Ponpokopī and Princess Ponpokonā, and all of them enjoyed longevity.
; Chōkyūmei
: &quot;long and lasting life&quot;.
; Chōsuke
: &quot;blessed for a long time&quot;.

==History==
Japanese folklore studies classify &quot;Jugemu&quot; as a variant of tale type &quot;The Child with a Long Name&quot;. In the English speaking world, children&#x27;s literature of this type is known by the titles &quot;Tikki Tikki Tembo&quot; and &quot;Nicki Nicki Tembo&quot;.

An early version of this type is &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Sunk down the waters for greed&#x27;), in a book of jokes published in 1703, created by comedian Yonezawa Hikohachi. In it, a stepmother renames her sons. The stepson whom she hates is given a short name , and her precious own son given a long . One day, falls into a river, but people swiftly rescue him. Another day, the mother&#x27;s own son is swept by the river. She cries &quot;Somebody, please! is drowning!&quot;, but the boy is lost to the river as no-one comes to save him due to the time it takes her to say his name. Both names are garbled forms of phrases taken from Sino-Japanese readings of Chinese Buddhist sutras. The punchline is a Japanese pun involving the word .

A book of horror stories published in 1805 contains &quot;&quot; (&#x27;A tale of a man who named his son with a strange name, and regretted it&#x27;). In it, a man wishes to name his first son with a unique and long name. He consults a Confucian scholar, who recommends the name . A tutor of Japanese poetry sneers at this, opposing such use of foreign language to name a Japanese&#x27;s son. The tutor proposes , a traditional poem of good fortune. The scholar and the tutor starts quarrelling, so the father decides to make the name by himself. He solemnly declares it will be

One day, the boy falls into a well. People panic to rescue the boy, but for every message they recite the long name. The boy dies, &quot;blue and swollen&quot;.

The name by the Confucian is taken from a translated Chinese Confucian textbook about &quot;Great Learning&quot;. The poem that the tutor referred to, in its original form , is a palindrome of Japanese morae (similar to syllables). The story gives no explanation of the origin or meanings of &quot;Tekitekini&quot;. The book was written by a storywriter and storyteller with pen name Tozuisha.

The name &quot;Jugemu&quot; appears in a 1884 magazine article, and the full story in a 1912 book. Another 1912 document suggests that the story of &quot;Jugemu&quot; may have existed by the mid-19th century.

According to a memoire published in 1927, there was another performed around the 1880s. In it, the first child is named by a Shinto priest, but dies in infancy; the parents ask a Buddhist priest to name their second child. The name is The name is taken from a dharani (Buddhist chants in Sanskrit) in Lotus Sutra chapter 26. One day the child falls into a well and drowns; the punchline is a black humor relating Buddhist chants to Japanese funerals. This version is titled &quot;&quot;. By the mid-20th century, it was no longer performed.

&quot;Jugemu&quot; is performed not only in ( theaters), but also to other audiences and on mass media, especially for children.

&quot;Jugemu&quot; was on a 1926 newspaper&#x27;s radio broadcast program, with the full name printed. There was another broadcast in 1932, this time for children, and the name printed on newspaper again. The story is told in children&#x27;s magazines from as early as 1926. Even a prominent Japanese dictionary describes the full name, since its 1991 edition. Television stations broadcast it also in children&#x27;s programs. In 2003, NHK children&#x27;s TV program (&quot;Let&#x27;s play with Japanese language&quot;) featured a game of reciting the name from memory. The program proved popular. There were schools that make all pupils memorize and recite it.

Since 2005, several elementary school textbooks include &quot;Jugemu&quot;.

<doc id="489324" wikidata="Q1322032" url="?curid=489324" title="Tokio (band)">
<text>Tokio is a Japanese rock/pop band formed by Johnny &amp; Associates that debuted in 1994. It is made up of three men who were signed with Sony Music Entertainment from 1994 to 2001, with Universal Music Japan from 2001 to 2008, and are now signed under J Storm, a label owned by Johnny &amp; Associates. In addition to their activities as a band, the members of Tokio also act in dozens of dramas and host variety programmes, both as a group and individually.

The group&#x27;s name &quot;Tokio&quot; was the old English romanization for Japan&#x27;s capital Tokyo, and remains the current transliteration in several European languages. Unlike most other bands under Johnny &amp; Associates, where all of the band members are usually only vocalists, Tokio only has one main vocalist, a drummer, a guitarist, a bassist, and a keyboardist. Bassist Tatsuya Yamaguchi was kicked out of the band in May 2018 following a sexual harassment scandal involving a high-school-aged girl. Subsequently, less choreography is used in concerts and promotional videos, and their music is often more rock-centric.

Since their debut in 1994, they have sold about 9 million copies.

== History ==

===1989–1993: Formation===
Like the members of SMAP, the members of Tokio performed as background dancers for the idol group Hikaru Genji mainly in the form of the back-dancing group Heikeha, which also involved members of the band V6. In 1989, guitarist Shigeru Joshima and bassist Tatsuya Yamaguchi discovered they both played instruments in their own bands and decided to form their own, practicing in private and unknown to the company, calling themselves Joshima Band, or &quot;Joh Band&quot; for short. At one point, they also called themselves &#x27;JURIA&#x27;, combining their names using Joshima&#x27;s &quot;J&quot;, &quot;URI&quot; from the melon-shape of Yamaguchi&#x27;s face, and rhythm-guitarist member Takehito Asakura&#x27;s &quot;A&quot;. Eventually, Johnny accepted them as a band, giving them the name &quot;Tokio Band&quot;. At this point, members included Joshima, Yamaguchi, and new support member, rhythm guitarist Kazuhisa Watanabe.

In 1990, the original Tokio was formed when Joshima was put together with drummer Masahiro Matsuoka and keyboardist Taichi Kokubun, both of whom had also joined Joshima and Yamaguchi in a few of their practices in the past. Rhythm guitarist and vocalist Hiromu Kojima joined the group soon after this. During this time, Joshima underwent negotiations with Johnny Kitagawa himself into allowing Yamaguchi to join the band, and soon he became an official member as well. Tomoya Nagase, another Junior vocalist who had been making more and more headlines, began appearing with the newly formed Tokio on occasion as a support member, which created a bit of odd tension as the group appeared in magazines and on the radio with five members, but on TV and live performances with six members. One of their first live tours included one with the band SAY・S and included all six members.

===1994–1999: Debut and onward===
In 1994, just before the release of the band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Love You Only&quot;, founding member Hiromu Kojima was succeeded by Nagase following Kojima&#x27;s departure. Their debut single was released on September 21, 1994. Two months later, on November 21, 1994, their debut and self-titled album, &quot;Tokio&quot; was released. Their very first performance after their debut was held on New Year&#x27;s Eve at the 1994 &quot;NHK Kouhakutagassen&quot;.

Soon after the release of &quot;Tokio&quot;, the band&#x27;s first remix album was released in 1995, titled &quot;Tokio Remix&quot;. In 1996, the band recorded the song &quot;7 O&#x27;Clock News&quot; to be used as the theme song for the anime version of &quot;Kodocha&quot;. Due to licensing issues however, the song was not used as the theme song for the North American release of the series. Also in 1996, the band&#x27;s first compilation album was released, titled &quot;Best E.P Selection of Tokio&quot;.

Throughout the rest of the decade, Tokio released 18 more singles and four more studio albums: &quot;Bad Boys Bound&quot;, &quot;Blowing&quot;, &quot;Wild &amp; Mild&quot;, and &quot;Graffiti&quot;. From 1997 and onwards, some of the band&#x27;s singles were used as theme songs in television shows, usually drama shows. In 1997, &quot;Furarete Genki&quot; was used as the theme song to &quot;Psychometrer Eiji&quot; a drama Matsuoka starred in, and &quot;Julia&quot; was used as the theme song for &quot;Seiji No Mikata&quot;, a drama that starred Taichi Kokubun. In 1999, &quot;Love &amp; Peace&quot; was used as the theme song to &quot;Love and Peace&quot;, another drama that Matsuoka starred in, and &quot;Ai no Arashi&quot; was used as the theme song for &quot;Psychometrer Eiji 2&quot;.

===2000–2004: Rise in popularity===
In early 2000, Tokio released the album &quot;Yesterday &amp; Today&quot;. Following the release of the single &quot;Doitsu Mo Koitsu Mo&quot; in early 2001, Tokio switch recording labels from Sony Music Entertainment to UMG. From the following single, &quot;Oh!Heaven&quot; was the theme song for &quot;Tengoku ni Ichiban Chikai Otoko&quot;, a drama that starred Matsuoka, and &quot;Hitoribotchino haburashi&quot; was the theme song for &quot;Mukodono!&quot;, a drama starring Tomoya Nagase. From then on, the majority of subsequently released singles would be used as theme songs for dramas starring members of Tokio. In December 2001, the first album under Universal Music, &quot;5 Ahead&quot;, was released.

In May 2001, Tokio released their second compilation album, titled &quot;Best EP Selection of Tokio II&quot;. Since the release of the single &quot;Ding Dong / Glider&quot; in late 2002, the promotional videos for Tokio songs are directed by Masahiro Matsuoka. 2003 saw the release of the seventh studio album, &quot;Glider&quot; in February. In 2003, &quot;Ambitious Japan!&quot; was used as the theme song for JR Central&#x27;s &quot;Nozomi&quot; train services on the Tōkaidō &amp; San&#x27;yō Shinkansen lines.

In 2004, Taichi Kokubun took a leave from Tokio to form the temporary music unit &quot;Toraji Haiji&quot; with KinKi Kids member Tsuyoshi Domoto. Together they recorded the theme song for the movie &quot;Fantastipo&quot;, in which they starred in. To commemorate the tenth anniversary of their debut, Tokio released their first cover album, &quot;TOK10&quot; in September 2004. It became the band&#x27;s first number-one album.

===2005–2017: Established band===

In February 2005, the tenth full-length album (not including compilation albums), &quot;Act II&quot; was released. They released the single &quot;Ashita o Mezashite!&quot; on December 7, 2005. Tomoya Nagase composed and co-arranged the single with his lyrics, making it their first single composed by a member of the group. In 2005, Tokio was selected to be the host for the Johnny&#x27;s Countdown 2005-2006 concert, a yearly event that counts down to the New Year. In 2006, Tokio released the single &quot;Sorafune&quot;, which sold over 400,000 copies and charted for over four months, making it their most successful single. The Tokio single &quot;Get Your Dream&quot; was used as the theme song in Japan for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Later in 2006, the group released their longest studio album to date, &quot;Harvest&quot;, containing seventeen tracks and two remix tracks.

In 2008, Tokio&#x27;s shortest album was released, titled &quot;Sugar&quot;. The seven-track album contains the three singles released in 2007. Also in 2008, the band changed recording labels for the second time, switching to J Storm, a label owned by Johnny &amp; Associates. Subsequently, all albums, singles, and other releases previously released under Universal Music were re-released on June 24, 2009.

Their first release under the new label was the four-track single &quot;Amagasa/Akireru Kurai Bokura wa Negaō&quot; on September 3, 2008. &quot;Amagasa&quot; was composed by Ringo Shiina with her lyrics and was arranged by Tokyo Jihen. Tokio released another four-track single titled &quot;Taiyō to Sabaku no Bara/Subeki Koto&quot; on August 19, 2009. After releasing the single &quot;Advance/Mata Asa ga Kuru&quot; on February 3, 2010, they released the single &quot;Haruka&quot; on June 16, 2010. &quot;Haruka&quot; went on to become their first number-one since December 2007. On 11 August 2010, they released the single &quot;NaNaNa (Taiyo Nante Irane)&quot;, written by Kōji Tamaki and arranged by Anzen Chitai. Next they released the single &quot;Miageta Ryūsei&quot;, which was used as the theme song for &quot;Kōkōsei Restaurant&quot;, a drama starring Matsuoka. Ahead of the Plus tour, which ran from March to May 2011, Tokio released their first digital single, &quot;Plus&quot;, on dwango.jp for a limited time.

On 22 August 2012, Tokio released their twelfth studio album titled &quot;17&quot;, their first full-length album in six years. To support the album, the band embarked on the 1718 tour, which ran until September. Tokio&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;Heart&quot;, was released in July 2014. It included two new songs, &quot;Heart&quot; and &quot;Kokoro&quot;, written by Nagase and Joshima. &quot;Heart&quot; went on to become the band&#x27;s second number-one album. Tokio&#x27;s final single, &quot;Kumo&quot;, was released on 30 August 2017.

===2018–present: Music hiatus===
On 25 April 2018, news broke that Yamaguchi had been referred to prosecutors for allegedly kissing a girl against her will at his home in February 2018. On 6 May 2018, Johnny &amp; Associates announced that they had terminated their contract with Yamaguchi. As a result of the scandal, Tokio indefinitely suspended all music activities.

In July 2020, Nagase announced that he was to leave the band to pursue his own endeavors. On 31 March 2021, he withdrew from Tokio and retired from the entertainment industry.

On 1 April 2021, the 3 remaining members established a new company called Tokio Co., Ltd., an affiliate to Johnny &amp; Associates. Joshima was made the president of the company, while Kokubun and Matsuoka became the vice presidents. On 2 October 2023, it was informed that Joshima would become plenipotentiary president and CEO of the company, taking over the role held by Julie K. Fujishima. This was informed in the company&#x27;s official site. Kokubun and Matsuoka remain as vicepresidents.
