<text>The Counter-Enlightenment refers to a loose collection of intellectual stances that arose during the European Enlightenment in opposition to its mainstream attitudes and ideals. The Counter-Enlightenment is generally seen to have continued from the 18th century into the early 19th century, especially with the rise of Romanticism. Its thinkers did not necessarily agree to a set of counter-doctrines but instead each challenged specific elements of Enlightenment thinking, such as the belief in progress, the rationality of all humans, liberal democracy, and the increasing secularisation of European society.

Scholars differ on who is to be included among the major figures of the Counter-Enlightenment. In Italy, Giambattista Vico criticised the spread of reductionism and the Cartesian method, which he saw as unimaginative and stiffling creative thinking. Decades later, Joseph de Maistre in Sardinia and Edmund Burke in Britain both criticised the anti-religious ideas of the Enlightenment for leading to the Reign of Terror and a totalitarian police state following the French Revolution. The ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Johann Georg Hamann were also significant to the rise of the Counter-Enlightenment with French and German Romanticism respectively.

In the late 20th century, the concept of the Counter-Enlightenment was popularised by pro-Enlightenment historian Isaiah Berlin as a tradition of relativist, anti-rationalist, vitalist, and organic thinkers stemming largely from Hamann and subsequent German Romantics. While Berlin is largely credited with having refined and promoted the concept, the first known use of the term in English occurred in 1949 and there were several earlier uses of it across other European languages, including by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.

== Term usage ==
=== Early usage ===
Despite criticism of the Enlightenment being a widely discussed topic in twentieth- and twenty-first century thought, the term &quot;Counter-Enlightenment&quot; was slow to enter general usage. It was first mentioned briefly in English in William Barrett&#x27;s 1949 article &quot;Art, Aristocracy and Reason&quot; in &quot;Partisan Review.&quot; He used the term again in his 1958 book on existentialism, &quot;Irrational Man;&quot; however, his comment on Enlightenment criticism was very limited. In Germany, the expression &quot;Gegen-Aufklärung&quot; has a longer history. It was probably coined by Friedrich Nietzsche in &quot;Nachgelassene Fragmente&quot; in 1877.

Lewis White Beck used this term in his &quot;Early German Philosophy&quot; (1969), a book about Counter-Enlightenment in Germany. Beck claims that there is a counter-movement arising in Germany in reaction to Frederick II&#x27;s secular authoritarian state. On the other hand, Johann Georg Hamann and his fellow philosophers believe that a more organic conception of social and political life, a more vitalistic view of nature, and an appreciation for beauty and the spiritual life of man have been neglected by the eighteenth century.

=== Isaiah Berlin ===
Isaiah Berlin established this term&#x27;s place in the history of ideas. He used it to refer to a movement that arose primarily in late 18th- and early 19th-century Germany against the rationalism, universalism and empiricism that are commonly associated with the Enlightenment. Berlin&#x27;s essay &quot;The Counter-Enlightenment&quot; was first published in 1973, and later reprinted in a collection of his works, &quot;Against the Current&quot;, in 1981. The term has been more widely used since.

Berlin argues that, while there were opponents of the Enlightenment outside of Germany (e.g. Joseph de Maistre) and before the 1770s (e.g. Giambattista Vico), Counter-Enlightenment thought did not take hold until the Germans &quot;rebelled against the dead hand of France in the realms of culture, art and philosophy, and avenged themselves by launching the great counter-attack against the Enlightenment.&quot; This German reaction to the imperialistic universalism of the French Enlightenment and Revolution, which had been forced on them first by the francophile Frederick II of Prussia, then by the armies of Revolutionary France and finally by Napoleon, was crucial to the shift of consciousness that occurred in Europe at this time, leading eventually to Romanticism. The consequence of this revolt against the Enlightenment was pluralism. The opponents to the Enlightenment played a more crucial role than its proponents, some of whom were monists, whose political, intellectual and ideological offspring have been &quot;terreur&quot; and totalitarianism.

=== Darrin McMahon ===
In his book &quot;Enemies of the Enlightenment&quot; (2001), historian Darrin McMahon extends the Counter-Enlightenment back to pre-Revolutionary France and down to the level of &quot;Grub Street&quot;. McMahon focuses on the early opponents to the Enlightenment in France, unearthing a long-forgotten &quot;Grub Street&quot; literature in the late 18th and early 19th centuries aimed at the &quot;philosophes&quot;. He delves into the obscure world of the &quot;low Counter-Enlightenment&quot; that attacked the &quot;encyclopédistes&quot; and fought to prevent the dissemination of Enlightenment ideas in the second half of the century. Many people from earlier times attacked the Enlightenment for undermining religion and the social and political order. It later became a major theme of conservative criticism of the Enlightenment. After the French Revolution, it appeared to vindicate the warnings of the &quot;anti-philosophes&quot; in the decades prior to 1789.

=== Graeme Garrard ===
Cardiff University professor Graeme Garrard claims that historian William R. Everdell was the first to situate Rousseau as the &quot;founder of the Counter-Enlightenment&quot; in his 1971 dissertation and in his 1987 book, &quot;Christian Apologetics in France, 1730–1790: The Roots of Romantic Religion&quot;. In his 1996 article, &quot;the Origin of the Counter-Enlightenment: Rousseau and the New Religion of Sincerity&quot;, in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; (Vol. 90, No. 2), Arthur M. Melzer corroborates Everdell&#x27;s view in placing the origin of the Counter-Enlightenment in the religious writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, further showing Rousseau as the man who fired the first shot in the war between the Enlightenment and its opponents. Graeme Garrard follows Melzer in his &quot;Rousseau&#x27;s Counter-Enlightenment&quot; (2003). This contradicts Berlin&#x27;s depiction of Rousseau as a &quot;philosophe&quot; (albeit an erratic one) who shared the basic beliefs of his Enlightenment contemporaries. But similar to McMahon, Garrard traces the beginning of Counter-Enlightenment thought back to France and prior to the German &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement of the 1770s. Garrard&#x27;s book &quot;Counter-Enlightenments&quot; (2006) broadens the term even further, arguing against Berlin that there was no single &quot;movement&quot; called &quot;The Counter-Enlightenment&quot;. Rather, there have been many Counter-Enlightenments, from the middle of the 18th century to the 20th century among critical theorists, postmodernists and feminists. The Enlightenment has opponents on all points of its ideological compass, from the far left to the far right, and all points in between. Each of the Enlightenment&#x27;s challengers depicted it as they saw it or wanted others to see it, resulting in a vast range of portraits, many of which are not only different but incompatible.

=== James Schmidt ===
The idea of Counter-Enlightenment has evolved in the following years. The historian James Schmidt questioned the idea of &quot;Enlightenment&quot; and therefore of the existence of a movement opposing it. As the conception of &quot;Enlightenment&quot; has become more complex and difficult to maintain, so has the idea of the &quot;Counter-Enlightenment&quot;. Advances in Enlightenment scholarship in the last quarter-century have challenged the stereotypical view of the 18th century as an &quot;Age of Reason&quot;, leading Schmidt to speculate on whether the Enlightenment might not actually be a creation of its opponents, but the other way round. The fact that the term &quot;Enlightenment&quot; was first used in 1894 in English to refer to a historical period supports the argument that it was a late construction projected back onto the 18th century.

==The French Revolution==
By the mid-1790s, the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution fueled a major reaction against the Enlightenment. Many leaders of the French Revolution and their supporters made Voltaire and Rousseau, as well as Marquis de Condorcet&#x27;s ideas of reason, progress, anti-clericalism, and emancipation, central themes to their movement. It led to an unavoidable backlash to the Enlightenment as there were people opposed to the revolution. Many counter-revolutionary writers, such as Edmund Burke, Joseph de Maistre and Augustin Barruel, asserted an intrinsic link between the Enlightenment and the Revolution. They blamed the Enlightenment for undermining traditional beliefs that sustained the &quot;ancien regime&quot;. As the Revolution became increasingly bloody, the idea of &quot;Enlightenment&quot; was discredited, too. Hence, the French Revolution and its aftermath have contributed to the development of Counter-Enlightenment thought.

Edmund Burke was among the first of the Revolution&#x27;s opponents to relate the &quot;philosophes&quot; to the instability in France in the 1790s. His &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790) identifies the Enlightenment as the principal cause of the French revolution. In Burke&#x27;s opinion, the &quot;philosophes&quot; provided the revolutionary leaders with the theories on which their political schemes were based.

Augustin Barruel&#x27;s Counter-Enlightenment ideas were well developed before the revolution. He worked as an editor for the anti-&quot;philosophes&quot; literary journal, &quot;L&#x27;Année Littéraire&quot;. Barruel argues in his &quot;Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism&quot; (1797) that the Revolution was the consequence of a conspiracy of &quot;philosophes&quot; and freemasons.

In &quot;Considerations on France&quot; (1797), Joseph de Maistre interprets the Revolution as divine punishment for the sins of the Enlightenment. According to him, &quot;the revolutionary storm is an overwhelming force of nature unleashed on Europe by God that mocked human pretensions.&quot;

==Romanticism==

In the 1770s, the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement started in Germany. It questioned some key assumptions and implications of the &quot;Aufklärung&quot; and the term &quot;Romanticism&quot; was first coined. Many early Romantic writers such as Chateaubriand, Friedrich von Hardenberg (Novalis) and Samuel Taylor Coleridge inherited the Counter-Revolutionary antipathy towards the &quot;philosophes&quot;. All three directly blamed the &quot;philosophes&quot; in France and the &quot;Aufklärer&quot; in Germany for devaluing beauty, spirit and history in favour of a view of man as a soulless machine and a view of the universe as a meaningless, disenchanted void lacking richness and beauty. One particular concern to early Romantic writers was the allegedly anti-religious nature of the Enlightenment since the &quot;philosophes&quot; and &quot;Aufklärer&quot; were generally deists, opposed to revealed religion. Some historians, such as Hamann, nevertheless contend that this view of the Enlightenment as an age hostile to religion is common ground between these Romantic writers and many of their conservative Counter-Revolutionary predecessors. However, not many have commented on the Enlightenment, except for Chateaubriand, Novalis, and Coleridge, since the term itself did not exist at the time and most of their contemporaries ignored it.
The historian Jacques Barzun argues that Romanticism has its roots in the Enlightenment. It was not anti-rational, but rather balanced rationality against the competing claims of intuition and the sense of justice. This view is expressed in Goya&#x27;s &quot;Sleep of Reason&quot;, in which the nightmarish owl offers the dozing social critic of &quot;Los Caprichos&quot; a piece of drawing chalk. Even the rational critic is inspired by irrational dream-content under the gaze of the sharp-eyed lynx. Marshall Brown makes much the same argument as Barzun in &quot;Romanticism and Enlightenment&quot;, questioning the stark opposition between these two periods.

By the middle of the 19th century, the memory of the French Revolution was fading and so was the influence of Romanticism. In this optimistic age of science and industry, there were few critics of the Enlightenment, and few explicit defenders. Friedrich Nietzsche is a notable and highly influential exception. After an initial defence of the Enlightenment in his so-called &quot;middle period&quot; (late 1870s to early 1880s), Nietzsche turned vehemently against it.

== Totalitarianism and Fascism ==
=== Totalitarianism as a product of the Enlightenment ===
After World War II, the Enlightenment re-emerged as a key organizing concept in social and political thought and the history of ideas. The Counter-Enlightenment literature blaming the 18th-century Age of Reason for both 18th and 20th-century totalitarianism also resurged. The &quot;locus classicus&quot; of this view is Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno&#x27;s &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; (1947), which traces the degeneration of the general concept of enlightenment from ancient Greece (epitomized by the cunning &quot;bourgeois&quot; hero Odysseus) to 20th-century fascism.

The authors take &quot;enlightenment&quot; as their target including its 18th-century formwhich we now call &quot;The Enlightenment&quot;. They claim it is epitomized by the Marquis de Sade. However, there were philosophers rejecting Adorno and Horkheimer&#x27;s claim that Sade&#x27;s moral skepticism is actually coherent, or that it reflects Enlightenment thought.

=== Nazism and Fascism as products of the Counter-Enlightenment ===
Later, some historians argued that Fascism was a product of the Counter-Enlightenment itself. For example, Ze&#x27;ev Sternhell called Fascism &quot;an exacerbated form of the tradition of counter-Enlightenment&quot;: with Fascism, &quot;Europe created for the first time a set of political movements and regimes whose project was nothing but the destruction of Enlightenment culture.&quot; Similar opinion were expressed by such historians as Georges Bensoussan and Enzo Traverso, who noted &quot;Counter-Enlightenment tendencies, combined with industrial and technical progress, a state monopoly over violence, and the rationalisation of methods of domination&quot; and &quot;Counter-Enlightenment (Gegenaufklärung) and the cult of modern technology, a synthesis of Teutonic mythologies and biological nationalism&quot; in Nazism, thus recognizing it as grounded on intellectual traditions of counter-Enlightenment, but mixing them with &quot;instrumental reason&quot; which allowed adopting &quot;the methods of industrial production and scientific management were employed&quot; for such irrational goals as raciae extermination. Prior to these historians, various philosophers described Fascism as a &quot;revolt against reason&quot; and a force hostile to scientific objectivity and rational inqury, namely Umberto Eco, Bertrand Russell, Richard Wolin and Jason Stanley.

<text>Carl Strandlund (5 March 1899 – 26 December 1974) was a Swedish-born American inventor and entrepreneur.

==Background==
Carl Gunnar Strandlund was born in Sundsvall in Västernorrland County, Sweden. Strandlund came to the United States at the age of four and grew up in Moline, Illinois. As a young man, he took correspondence school classes in engineering. His grandfather had been an engineer in Sweden. His father worked in the United States for John Deere.

==Career==
Strandlund held over 150 farm implement patents through his work as a production engineer at the Minneapolis-Moline tractor company, including the creation of rubber tires for tractors. He later served as president of the Oliver Farm Equipment Company.

He was hired by the Chicago Vitreous Enamel Product Company to transform the factory for defense production. Strandlund invented manufacturing techniques to build non-warping metal plates for tanks during World War II, created air conditioning systems for movie theaters, and invented a wallpaper-removing machine. The company rewarded him with a promotion to vice president and general manager in September 1943.

Strandlund was most noted for inventing and promoting the Lustron house (built of porcelain-enameled steel panels - ) to help address the housing shortage after World War II. 2498 homes were built 1948–1950 at a large assembly plant in Columbus, Ohio, through financing from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The Lustron plant assembly line was some 9 miles long and the plant consumed more power than the rest of the entire city of Columbus. Mismanagement, politics, and corruption were blamed for the downfall of Lustron, which shut down amid foreclosure and bankruptcy in 1953. As of 2004, the majority of the 2,498 Lustron homes built were still standing. Fifty Lustrons have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In a September 12, 1982, &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; article, Strandlund&#x27;s widow Clara related how Strandlund reacted to the closure of Lustron: &quot;He was physically and mentally destroyed,&quot; she said. &quot;Everything we had went. They took everything but our home.&quot; He died in Edina, a suburb of Minneapolis, at the age of 75. Strandlund is interred next to his wife Clara at Lakewood Cemetery, Minneapolis, MN.

<doc id="505770" wikidata="Q1573058" url="?curid=505770" title="Slave states and free states">
<text>In the United States before 1865, a slave state was a state in which slavery and the internal or domestic slave trade were legal, while a free state was one in which they were prohibited. Between 1812 and 1850, it was considered by the slave states to be politically imperative that the number of free states not exceed the number of slave states, so new states were admitted in slave–free pairs. There were, nonetheless, some slaves in most free states up to the 1840 census, and the Fugitive Slave Clause of the U.S. Constitution, as implemented by the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, provided that a slave did not become free by entering a free state and must be returned to their owner. Enforcement of these laws became one of the controversies which arose between slave and free states.

By the 18th century, slavery was legal throughout the Thirteen Colonies, after which rebel colonies started to abolish the practice. Pennsylvania abolished slavery in 1780, and about half of the states had abolished slavery by the end of the Revolutionary War or in the first decades of the new country, although this did not always mean that existing slaves became free. Vermont — having declared its independence from Britain in 1777 and thus not being one of the Thirteen Colonies — banned slavery in the same year, before being admitted as a state in 1791.

Slavery was a divisive issue in the United States. It was a major issue during the writing of the U.S. Constitution in 1787, the subject of political crises in the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the Compromise of 1850 and was the primary cause of the American Civil War in 1861. Just before the Civil War, there were 19 free states and 15 slave states. The most recent free state, Kansas, had entered the Union after its own years-long bloody fight over slavery. During the war, slavery was abolished in some of the slave states, and the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in December 1865, abolished slavery throughout the United States, except as punishment for a crime.

==History==

===Early history===


Slavery was established as a legal institution in each of the Thirteen Colonies, starting from 1619 on wards with the arrival of &quot;twenty and odd&quot; enslaved Africans in Virginia. Although indigenous peoples were also sold into slavery, the vast majority of the enslaved population consisted of Africans brought to the Americas via the Atlantic slave trade. Due to a lower prevalence of tropical diseases and better treatment, the enslaved population in the colonies had a higher life expectancy than in the West Indies and South America, leading to a rapid increase in population in the decades prior to the American Revolution. Organized political and social movements to abolish slavery began in the mid-18th century. The sentiments of the American Revolution and the promise of equality evoked by the Declaration of Independence stood in contrast to the status of most black people, either free or enslaved, in the colonies. Despite this, thousands of black Americans fought for the Patriot cause for a combination of reasons. Thousands also joined the British, encouraged by offers of freedom such as the Philipsburg Proclamation.

In the 1770s, enslaved black people throughout New England began sending petitions to northern legislatures demanding freedom. 5 Northern states adopted policies to at least gradually abolish slavery: Pennsylvania in 1780, New Hampshire and Massachusetts in 1783, and Connecticut and Rhode Island in 1784. The Republic of Vermont had limited slavery in 1777, while it was still independent before it joined the United States as the 14th state in 1791. These state jurisdictions thus enacted the first abolition laws in the Atlantic World. By 1804 (including New York (1799) and New Jersey (1804)), all of the Northern states had abolished slavery or set measures in place to gradually abolish it, although there were still hundreds of ex-slaves working without pay as indentured servants in Northern states as late as the 1840 census (see Slavery in the United States#Abolitionism in the North).

In the South, Kentucky was created as a slave state from Virginia (1792), and Tennessee was created as a slave state from North Carolina (1796). By 1804, before the creation of new states from the federal western territories, the number of slave and free states was 8 each. By the time of Missouri Compromise of 1820, the dividing line between the slave and free states was called the Mason-Dixon line (between Maryland and Pennsylvania), with its westward extension being the Ohio River.

The 1787 Constitutional Convention debated slavery, and for a time slavery was a major impediment to passage of the new constitution. As a compromise, slavery was acknowledged but never mentioned explicitly in the Constitution. The Fugitive Slave Clause, Article 4, section 2, clause 3, for example, refers to a &quot;Person held to Service or Labor.&quot; In addition, Article 1, section 9, clause 1 of the Constitution prohibited Congress from abolishing the importation of slaves, but in a compromise, the prohibition could be lifted by Congress in 20 years, and slaves were referred to as &quot;Persons.&quot; The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves passed easily in 1807 and took effect on January 1, 1808. However, the ban on importation spurred an expansion in the domestic slave trade, which remained legal until slavery was banned entirely in 1865 by the 13th Amendment.
 In the late 1850s, an unsuccessful campaign was launched by several southern states to resume the international slave trade, to restock their slave populations, but this met with strong opposition. However, there was a large natural increase in the slave population throughout the late 18th and 19th centuries, while some illegal smuggling of African slaves continued via Spanish Cuba.

One of the other compromises of the Constitution was the creation of the Three-Fifths Clause by which slave states acquired increased representation in the House of Representatives and Electoral College equivalent to 60% of their disenfranchised slave populations. Slave states had wanted 100% of their slaves to be counted, whereas Northern states argued that none should be.

===New territories===

The Northwest Ordinance of 1787, passed just before the U.S. Constitution was ratified, had prohibited slavery in the federal Northwest Territory. The southern boundary of the territory was the Ohio River, which was regarded as a westward extension of the Mason-Dixon line. The territory was generally settled by New Englanders and American Revolutionary War veterans granted land there. The 6 states created from the territory were all free states: Ohio (1803), Indiana (1816), Illinois (1818), Michigan (1837), Wisconsin (1848), and Minnesota (1858).

By 1815, the momentum for antislavery reform appeared to run out of steam, with half the states having already abolished slavery (Northeast), prohibited it from the start (Midwest), or committed to eliminating it, and half committed to continuing the institution indefinitely (South).
The potential for political conflict over slavery at the federal level made politicians concerned about the balance of power in the Senate, where each state was represented by two senators. With an equal number of slave states and free states, the Senate was equally divided on issues important to the South. As the population of the free states began to outstrip the population of the slave states, leading to control of the House of Representatives by free states, the Senate became the preoccupation of slave-state politicians interested in maintaining a congressional veto over federal policy with regard to slavery and other issues important to the South. As a result of this preoccupation, slave states and free states were often admitted into the Union in opposite pairs to maintain the existing Senate balance between slave and free states.
====Missouri Compromise====
Controversy over whether Missouri should be admitted as a slave state resulted in the Missouri Compromise of 1821, which specified that territory acquired in the Louisiana Purchase north of latitude 36° 30&#x27;, which described most of Missouri&#x27;s southern border, would, except for Missouri, become free states, and territory south of that line would become slave states. As part of the compromise, Maine, on August 19, 1821, was admitted as a free state.

====Texas and the Mexican Cession====

The admission of Texas (1845) and the acquisition of the vast new Mexican Cession territories (1848), after the Mexican–American War, created further north–south conflict. Although the settled portion of Texas was an area rich in cotton plantations and dependent on slave labor, the territory acquired in the Mountain West did not seem hospitable to cotton or slavery.

As part of the Compromise of 1850, California was admitted as a free state without a slave state being admitted; California&#x27;s admission also meant there would be no slave state on the Pacific coast. To avoid creating a free state majority in the Senate, California agreed to send one pro-slavery and one anti-slavery senator to Congress.

====Last battles====
The difficulty of identifying territory that could be organized into additional slave states stalled the process of opening the western territories to settlement. Slave-state politicians made efforts to annex Cuba (see: Lopez Expedition and Ostend Manifesto, 1852) and Nicaragua (see: Filibuster War, 1856–57), with intentions to create new slave states. Parts of Northern Mexico were also coveted, with Senator Albert Brown declaring &quot;I want Tamaulipas, Potosi, and one or two other Mexican States; and I want them all for the same reason – for the plantation and spreading of slavery&quot;.

====Kansas====

In 1854, the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was superseded by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which allowed white male settlers in the new territories to determine, by vote (popular sovereignty), whether they would allow slavery within each territory. The result was that pro- and anti-slavery elements flooded into Kansas with the goal of voting slavery up or down, leading to bloody fighting. An effort was initiated to organize Kansas for admission as a slave state, paired with Minnesota, but the admission of Kansas as a slave state was blocked because its proposed pro-slavery constitution (the Lecompton Constitution) had not been approved in an honest election. Anti-slavery proponents during the &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; period of the later 1850s were called &quot;Free-Staters&quot; and &quot;Free-Soilers&quot;, and fought against pro-slavery Border Ruffians from Missouri. The animosity escalated throughout the 1850s, culminating in numerous skirmishes and devastation on both sides of the question. Nevertheless, the North prevented Kansas Territory from becoming a slave state, and when Southern members of Congress departed &quot;en masse&quot; in early 1861, Kansas was immediately admitted to the Union as a free state.

When the admission of Minnesota proceeded unimpeded in 1858, the balance in the Senate ended; this was compounded by the subsequent admission of Oregon as a free state in 1859.

==== Slave and free state pairs ====
The following table shows the balance between slave and free states that began in 1812. The Statehood columns provide the year the state either ratified the U.S. Constitution or was admitted to the Union. The date ranges in the Abolition column for Free States indicate when gradual abolition laws were adopted and when slavery finally ended, except for states where slavery was outlawed in a specific year.


From 1812 through 1850, maintaining the balance of free and slave state votes in the Senate was considered of paramount importance if the Union were to be preserved, and states were typically admitted in pairs:


California was admitted as a free state in 1850 without an accompanying slave state, though certain concessions were made to the slave states as part of the Compromise of 1850. Three more free states were admitted in the final years before the Civil War, disrupting the balance that the slave states had tried to maintain.


====Civil War====
The American Civil War (1861–1865) disrupted and eventually ended slavery. Eleven slave states joined the Confederacy, while the border states of Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouriall slave statesremained in the Union, although Kentucky and Missouri also had competing Confederate state governments. In 1863 western Virginia, much of which had remained loyal to the Union, was admitted as the new state of West Virginia with a commitment to gradual emancipation. The following year Nevada, a free state in the West, was also admitted.


===Special cases===

====West Virginia====
During the Civil War, a Unionist government in Wheeling, Virginia, presented a statehood bill to Congress to create a new state from 48 counties in western Virginia. The new state would eventually incorporate 50 counties. The issue of slavery in the new state delayed approval of the bill. In the Senate Charles Sumner objected to the admission of a new slave state, while Benjamin Wade defended statehood as long as a gradual emancipation clause would be included in the new state constitution. Two senators represented the Unionist Virginia government, John S. Carlile and Waitman T. Willey. Senator Carlile objected that Congress had no right to impose emancipation on West Virginia, while Willey proposed a compromise amendment to the state constitution for gradual abolition. Sumner attempted to add his own amendment to the bill, which was defeated, and the statehood bill passed both houses of Congress with the addition of what became known as the Willey Amendment. President Lincoln signed the bill on December 31, 1862. Voters in western Virginia approved the Willey Amendment on March 26, 1863.

President Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, which exempted from emancipation the border states (four slave states loyal to the Union) as well as some territories occupied by Union forces within Confederate states. Two additional counties were added to West Virginia in late 1863, Berkeley and Jefferson. The slaves in Berkeley were also under exemption but not those in Jefferson County. As of the census of 1860, the 49 exempted counties held some 6000 slaves over 21 years of age who would not have been emancipated, about 40% of the total slave population. The terms of the Willey Amendment only freed children, at birth or as they came of age, and prohibited the importation of slaves.

West Virginia became the 35th state on June 20, 1863, and the last slave state admitted to the Union. Eighteen months later, the West Virginia legislature completely abolished slavery, and also ratified the 13th Amendment on February 3, 1865.

====Washington D.C.====

In the District of Columbia, formed with land from two slave states, Maryland and Virginia, the slave trade was abolished by the Compromise of 1850. So as to avoid losing the profitable slave-trading businesses in Alexandria (one was Franklin and Armfield), Alexandria County, D.C., requested that it be returned to Virginia, where the slave trade was legal; this took place in 1847. Slavery in the District of Columbia remained legal until 1862, when, over strong opposition from slaveholding residents, Congress passed the DC Compensated Emancipation Act. &quot;Some enslavers refused to acknowledge the law and attempted to keep enslaved people in bondage illegally. Congress passed a supplemental law in July 1862 that allowed these victims to file petitions on their own behalf.&quot;

====Utah Territory====

Although it did not become a state until 1896, as an organized territory, Utah legalized slavery under the 1852 territorial Act in Relation to Service and similar Act for the Relief of Indian Slaves and Prisoners.

Brigham Young and his group of Mormon pioneers had arrived in Utah in 1847, during the Mexican–American War, when Utah Territory was Mexican territory. They ignored the Mexican ban on slavery. They viewed slavery as consistent with the Mormon view on Black people.

On June 19, 1862, fulfilling a part of his 1860 campaign platform, President Lincoln signed the law ending slavery in Utah Territory and all other territories.

==== California ====

While California&#x27;s state constitution outlawed slavery, the 1850 Act for the Government and Protection of Indians allowed the indenture of Native Californians. This law provided for apprenticing or indenturing Indian children to Whites, and also punished vagrant Indians by hiring them out to the highest bidder at a public auction if the Indian could not provide sufficient bond or bail. The new settlers took 10,000 to 27,000 California Native Americans as forced laborers, including 4,000 to 7,000 children. In April 1863, after the declaration of the Emancipation Proclamation, the California legislature abolished all forms of legal indenture and apprenticeship for Native Americans.

===End of non-penal slavery===

At the start of the Civil War, there were 34 states in the United States, 15 of which were slave states. Eleven of these slave states, after conventions devoted to the topic, issued declarations of secession from the United States, created the Confederate States of America, and were represented in the Confederate Congress. The slave states that stayed in the Union – Maryland, Missouri, Delaware, and Kentucky (called border states) – retained their representatives in the U.S. Congress. By the time the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863, Tennessee was already under Union control. Accordingly, the Proclamation applied only in the 10 remaining Confederate states. During the war, abolition of slavery was required by President Abraham Lincoln for readmission of Confederate states.

The U.S. Congress, after the departure of the powerful Southern contingent in 1861, was generally abolitionist: In a plan endorsed by Abraham Lincoln, slavery in the District of Columbia, which the Southern contingent had protected, was abolished in 1862.

In Southern states, freedom for slaves typically followed the Union army&#x27;s gaining control of an area. The Emancipation Proclamation declared all enslaved people in areas then under Confederate control free, but, in practice, freedom required either slaves reaching Union lines or Union forces reaching their area. As Union forces advanced from January 1, 1863, to June 19, 1865, slaves were freed.

West Virginia did not abolish slavery in its first proposed constitution of 1861, though it did ban the importation of slaves. In 1863, voters approved the Willey Amendment, which provided for gradual abolition of slavery, with the last enslaved people scheduled to be freed in 1884. On February 3, 1865, the state legislature approved immediate abolition.

The Restored Government of Virginia – the Unionist government that governed the limited territory then under Union control that had not left to form West Virginia – voted to end slavery at a constitutional convention on March 10, 1864. Arkansas, part of which came under Union control by 1864, adopted an anti-slavery constitution on March 16, 1864. 
Louisiana – much of which had been under Union control since 1862 – abolished slavery through a new state constitution approved by voters September 5, 1864. The border states of Maryland (November 1, 1864) and Missouri (January 11, 1865) abolished slavery before the war&#x27;s end. The Union-occupied state of Tennessee abolished slavery by popular vote on a constitutional amendment that took effect February 22, 1865.

However, slavery legally persisted in Delaware, Kentucky, and (to a very limited extent, due to a trade ban but continued gradual abolition) New Jersey, until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery throughout the United States, except as punishment for a crime, on December 18, 1865, ending the distinction between slave and free states. As such, slavery in the United States technically existed longer in the North than in the South.

<text>Batch production is a method of manufacturing where the products are made as specified groups or amounts, within a time frame. A batch can go through a series of steps in a large manufacturing process to make the final desired product. Batch production is used for many types of manufacturing that may need smaller amounts of production at a time to ensure specific quality standards or changes in the process. This is opposed to large mass production or continuous production methods, where the product or process does not need to be checked or changed as frequently or periodically.

== Characteristics ==
In the manufacturing batch production process, the machines are in chronological order directly related to the manufacturing process. The batch production method is also used so any temporary changes or modifications can be made to the product if necessary during the manufacturing process. For example, if a product needed a sudden change in material or details changed, it can be done in between batches. As opposed to assembly production or mass production where such changes cannot be easily made. The time between batches is called cycle time. Each batch may be assigned a lot number.

===Advantages===

Because batch production involves small batches, it is good for quality control. For example, if there is a mistake in the process, it can be fixed without as much loss compared to mass production. This can also save money by taking less risk for newer plans and products etc. As a result, this allows batch manufacturing to be changed or modified depending on company needs. In certain cases, batch production may require less expensive equipment, thus reducing the capital cost required to set up this type of system.

===Disadvantages===
There can be downtime between individual batches. Or if the product is constantly changing or being modified throughout the process, this also can cost downtime. Other disadvantages are that smaller batches need more planning, scheduling and control over the process and collecting data. Because of these factors, items made using batch production may have higher unit cost and take more time compared to continuous production.

<doc id="505791" wikidata="Q422484" url="?curid=505791" title="Ribonucleotide">
<text>In biochemistry, a ribonucleotide is a nucleotide containing ribose as its pentose component. It is considered a molecular precursor of nucleic acids. Nucleotides are the basic building blocks of DNA and RNA. Ribonucleotides themselves are basic monomeric building blocks for RNA. Deoxyribonucleotides, formed by reducing ribonucleotides with the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), are essential building blocks for DNA. There are several differences between DNA deoxyribonucleotides and RNA ribonucleotides. Successive nucleotides are linked together via phosphodiester bonds.

Ribonucleotides are also utilized in other cellular functions. These special monomers are utilized in both cell regulation and cell signaling as seen in adenosine-monophosphate (AMP). Furthermore, ribonucleotides can be converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency in organisms. Ribonucleotides can be converted to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) to regulate hormones in organisms as well. In living organisms, the most common bases for ribonucleotides are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), or uracil (U). The nitrogenous bases are classified into two parent compounds, purine and pyrimidine.

==Structure==

===General structure===


The general structure of a ribonucleotide consists of a phosphate group, a ribose sugar group, and a nucleobase, in which the nucleobase can either be adenine, guanine, cytosine, or uracil. Without the phosphate group, the composition of the nucleobase and sugar is known as a nucleoside. The interchangeable nitrogenous nucleobases are derived from two parent compounds, purine and pyrimidine. Nucleotides are heterocyclic compounds, that is, they contain at least two different chemical elements as members of its rings.

Both RNA and DNA contain two major purine bases, adenine (A) and guanine (G), and two major pyrimidines. In both DNA and RNA, one of the pyrimidines is cytosine (C). However, DNA and RNA differ in the second major pyrimidine. DNA contains thymine (T) while RNA contains uracil (U). There are some rare cases where thymine does occur in RNA and uracil in DNA.

Here are the 4 major ribonucleotides (ribonucleoside 5&#x27;-monophosphate) which are the structural units of RNAs.
===DNA deoxyribonucleotides versus RNA ribonucleotides===

In ribonucleotides, the sugar component is ribose while in deoxyribonucleotides, the sugar component is deoxyribose. Instead of a hydroxyl group at the second carbon in the ribose ring, it is replaced by a hydrogen atom.

Both types of pentoses in DNA and RNA are in their β-furanose (closed five-membered ring) form and they define the identity of a nucleic acid. DNA is defined by containing 2&#x27;-deoxy-ribose nucleic acid while RNA is defined by containing ribose nucleic acid.

In some occasions, DNA and RNA may contain some minor bases. Methylated forms of the major bases are most common in DNA. In viral DNA, some bases may be hydroxymethylated or glucosylated. In RNA, minor or modified bases occur more frequently. Some examples include hypoxanthine, dihydrouracil, methylated forms of uracil, cytosine, and guanine, as well as modified nucleoside pseudouridine. Nucleotides with phosphate groups in positions other than on the 5&#x27; carbon have also been observed. Examples include ribonucleoside 2&#x27;,3&#x27;-cyclic monophosphates which are isolatable intermediates, and ribonucleoside 3&#x27;-monophosphates which are end products of the hydrolysis of RNA by certain ribonucleases. Other variations include adenosine 3&#x27;,5&#x27;-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine 3&#x27;,5&#x27;-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP).

===Linking successive nucleotides===

Ribonucleotides are linked together to form RNA strands via phosphodiester bonds. The 5&#x27;-phosphate group of one nucleotide is linked to the 3&#x27;-hydroxyl group of the next nucleotide, creating a backbone of alternating phosphate and pentose residues. There is no phosphodiester bond at each end of the polynucleotide. Phosphodiester bonds are formed between ribonucleotides by the enzyme RNA polymerase. The RNA chain is synthesized from the 5&#x27; end to the 3&#x27; end as the 3&#x27;-hydroxyl group of the last ribonucleotide in the chain acts as a nucleophile and launches a hydrophilic attack on the 5&#x27;-triphosphate of the incoming ribonucleotide, releasing pyrophosphate as a by- product. Due to the physical properties of the nucleotides, the backbone of RNA is very hydrophilic and polar. At neutral pH, nucleic acids are highly charged as each phosphate group carries a negative charge.

Both DNA and RNA are built from nucleoside phosphates, also known as mononucleotide monomers, which are thermodynamically less likely to combine than amino acids. Phosphodiester bonds, when hydrolyzed, release a considerable amount of free energy. Therefore, nucleic acids tend to spontaneously hydrolyze into mononucleotides. The precursors for RNA are GTP, CTP, UTP and ATP, which is a major source of energy in group-transfer reactions.

==Function==

===Precursors of deoxyribonucleotides===
Scientists believe that RNA was developed before DNA.

The reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides is catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an essential enzyme for all living organisms since it is responsible for the last step in the synthesis of the four deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) necessary for DNA replication and repair. The reaction also requires two other proteins: thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase. Ribonucleoside diphosphate (NDP) is reduced by thioredoxin to a deoxyribonucleoside diphosphate (dNTP).

The general reaction is:
Ribonucleoside diphosphate + NADPH + Deoxyribonucleoside diphosphate + + 
To illustrate this equation, dATP and dGTP are synthesized from ADP and GDP, respectively. They are first reduced by RNR and then phosphorylated by nucleoside diphosphate kinases to dATP and dGTP. Ribonucleotide reductase is controlled by allosteric interactions. Once dATP binds to ribonucleotide reductase, the overall catalytic activity of the enzyme decreases, as it signifies an abundance of deoxyribonucleotides. This feedback inhibition is reversed once ATP binds.

===Ribonucleotide discrimination===
During DNA synthesis, DNA polymerases must select against ribonucleotides, present at much higher levels compared with deoxyribonucleotides. It is crucial that there is selectivity as DNA replication has to be accurate to maintain the organism&#x27;s genome. It has been shown that the active sites of Y-family DNA polymerases are responsible for maintaining a high selectivity against ribonucleotides. Most DNA polymerases are also equipped to exclude ribonucleotides from their active site through a bulky side chain residue that can sterically block the 2&#x27;-hydroxyl group of the ribose ring. However, many nuclear replicative and repair DNA polymerases incorporate ribonucleotides into DNA, suggesting that the exclusion mechanism is not perfect.

==Synthesis==

===Ribonucleotide synthesis===

Ribonucleotides can be synthesized in organisms from smaller molecules through the de novo pathway or recycled through the salvage pathway. In the case of the de novo pathway, both purines and pyrimidines are synthesized from components derived from precursors of amino acids, ribose-5-phosphates, , and .

De novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides is fairly complex, consisting of several enzymatic reactions. Utilizing the five-ring sugar structure as a base, the purine ring is built a few atoms at a time in an eleven-step process that leads to the formation of inosinate (IMP). Essentially, IMP is converted into the purine nucleotides required for nucleic acid synthesis.

The pathway begins with the conversion of Ribose-5-Phosphate(R5P) to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) by enzyme ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase (PRPS1). PRPP is then converted to 5-phosphoribosylamine (5-PRA) as glutamine donates an amino group to the C-1 of PRPP. In a condensation reaction, enzyme GAR synthetase, along with glycine and ATP, activates the glycine carboxylase group of 5-PRA to form Glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR). Co-enzyme N10-formyl-THF, along with enzyme GAR transformylase, then donates a one-carbon unit to the amino group onto the glycine of GAR, followed by glutamine addition by enzyme FGAR amidotransferase, leading to the formation of formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide (FGAM). Dehydration of FGAM by enzyme FGAM cyclase results in the closure of the imidazole ring, as 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR). A carboxyl group is attached to AIR by N5-CAIR synthetase to form N5-Carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (N5-CAIR), which is then converted to Carboxyamino-imidazole ribonucleotide (CAIR) with enzyme N5-CAIR mutase. Enzyme SAICAR synthetase, along with amino group from aspartate forms an amide bond to create N-succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (SAICAR). Continuing down the pathway, the removal of the carbon skeleton of aspartate by SAICAR lyase results in 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). Enzyme AICAR transformylase assists in the final carbon transfer from N10-formyltetrahydrofolate, forming N-formylaminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (FAICAR). Lastly, closure of the second ring structure is carried out by IMP synthase to form IMP, where IMP fate would lead to the formation of a purine nucleotide.

Synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides is a much simpler process. The formation of the pyrimidine ring begins with the conversion of Aspartate to N-Carbamoylaspartate by undergoing a condensation reaction with carbamoyl phosphate. Dihydroorotase and dihydroorotase dehydrogenase then converts N-Carbamoylaspartate to orotate. Orotate is covalently linked with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) by orotate phosphoribysol-transferase yielding orotidine monophosphate (OMP). OMP follows with the decarboxylation by orotidylate decarboxylase to form the Uridylate (UMP) ribonucleotide structure. UMP can then be converted to Uridine-5&#x27;-trisphosphate (UTP) by two kinases reaction. Formation of Cytidine-5&#x27;-trisphosphate (CTP) from UTP can be achieved by cytidylate synthetase by an acyl phosphate intermediate.

==Prebiotic synthesis of ribonucleotides==

In order to understand how life arose, knowledge is required of the chemical pathways that permit formation of the key building blocks of life under plausible prebiotic conditions. According to the RNA world hypothesis free-floating ribonucleotides were present in the primitive soup. These were the fundamental molecules that combined in series to form RNA. Molecules as complex as RNA must have arisen from small molecules whose reactivity was governed by physico-chemical processes. RNA is composed of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, both of which are necessary for reliable information transfer, and thus Darwinian natural selection and evolution. The synthesis of activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides was demonstrated under plausible prebiotic conditions. The starting materials for the synthesis (cyanamide, cyanoacetylene, glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde and inorganic phosphate) were considered to be plausible prebiotic feedstock molecules. Nam et al. demonstrated the direct condensation of nucleobases with ribose to give ribonucleosides in aqueous microdroplets, a key step leading to RNA formation. Also, a plausible prebiotic process for synthesizing pyrimidine and purine ribonucleotides using wet-dry cycles was presented by Becker et al.

==History==
Prior to James Watson and Francis Crick&#x27;s landmark paper that detailed the structure of DNA from Rosalind Franklin&#x27;s X-ray crystallography image, there were several historical scientists that also contributed to its discovery. Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss physician, who, in 1869, was first to isolate and identify nucleic substance from the nuclei of white blood cells he later called &quot;nuclein&quot;, paving the way for the discovery of DNA. Following Mieschers work, was the German biochemist, Albrecht Kossel, who, in 1878, isolated the non-protein components of &quot;nuclein&quot;, and discovered the five nucleobases present in nucleic acids: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine and uracil. Although some fundamental facts were known about nucleic acids due to these early discoveries, its structure and function remained a mystery.

It wasn&#x27;t until the discovery of nucleotides in 1919 by Phoebus Levene, a Russian-Lithuanian biochemist that re-opened the gates of the DNA discovery. Levene first identified the carbohydrate component present in yeast RNA was in fact ribose. However, it was not until his discovery that the carbohydrate component in thymus nucleic acid was also a sugar but lacked one oxygen atom, termed deoxyribose, that his discovery was widely appreciated by the scientific community. Eventually, Levene was able to identify the correct order of which the components of RNA and DNA are put together, a phosphate-sugar-base unit, in which he later called a nucleotide. Although the order of nucleotide components were well understood by Levene, the structure of nucleotide arrangement in space and its genetic code still remained a mystery during the early years of his career.

<doc id="505797" wikidata="Q815841" url="?curid=505797" title="Devshirme">
<text>Devshirme (, usually translated as &quot;child levy&quot; or &quot;blood tax&quot;) was the Ottoman practice of forcibly recruiting soldiers and bureaucrats from among the children of their Balkan Christian subjects and raising them in the religion of Islam. Those coming from the Balkans came primarily from noble Balkan families and rayah (poor) classes. It is first mentioned in written records in 1438, but probably started earlier. It created a faction of soldiers and officials loyal to the Sultan. It counterbalanced the Turkish nobility, who sometimes opposed the Sultan.

The system produced a considerable number of grand viziers from the 15th century to the 17th century. This was the second most powerful position in the Ottoman Empire, after the sultan. Initially, the grand viziers were exclusively of Turk origin, but after there were troubles between Sultan Mehmed II and the Turkish grand vizier Çandarlı Halil Pasha the Younger, who was the first grand vizier to be executed, there was a rise of slave administrators (&quot;devshirme&quot;). They were much easier for the sultans to control, compared to free administrators of Turkish aristocratic extraction. The devshirme also produced many of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s provincial governors, military commanders, and divans from the 15th to the 17th century. Sometimes, the devshirme recruits were castrated and became eunuchs. Although often destined for the harem, many eunuchs of devshirme origin went on to hold important positions in the military and the government, such as grand viziers Hadım Ali Pasha, Sinan Borovinić, and Hadım Hasan Pasha.

Ottoman officials would take male Christian children, aged 7 to 20, from Eastern, Southern and Southeastern Europe, and relocate them to Istanbul, where they were converted, circumcised, assimilated and trained to serve into the Janissary infantry corps or palace duties. Devshirme were rarely sold, though some could end up as slaves in private households. The fact that they were taken forcibly from their parents made the devshirme system resented by locals. However, revolts were rare, with the exception of a revolt against the devshirme in Albania in 1565. Ordered to cut all ties with their families, some managed to use their positions to help their families. Muslims were not allowed into the system (with some exceptions), but some Muslim families smuggled their sons in anyway. According to Speros Vryonis, &quot;The Ottomans took advantage of the general Christian fear of losing their children and used offers of devshirme exemption in negotiations for surrender of Christian lands. Such exemptions were included in the surrender terms granted to Jannina, Galata, Morea, Chios, etc. Christians who engaged in specialized activities important to the Ottoman state were exempted from the blood tax on their children by way of recognition of the importance of their labors for the empire. Exemption from this tribute was considered a privilege and not a penalty.&quot;

Many scholars consider the practice of devshirme as violating Islamic law. David Nicolle writes that enslavement of Christian boys violates the &quot;dhimmi&quot; protections guaranteed in Islam, but Halil İnalcık argues that the devshirme were not slaves once converted to Islam. The boys were given a formal education, and trained in science, warfare and bureaucratic administration, and became advisers to the sultan, elite infantry, generals in the army, admirals in the navy, and bureaucrats working on finance in the Ottoman Empire. They were separated according to ability and could rise in rank based on merit. The most talented, the &quot;ichoghlani&quot; (Turkish &quot;iç oğlanı&quot;) were trained for the highest positions in the empire. Others joined the military, including the famed janissaries.

The practice began to die out as Ottoman soldiers preferred recruiting their own sons into the army, rather than sons from Christian families. In 1594, Muslims were officially allowed to take the positions held by the &quot;devshirme&quot; and the system of recruiting Christians effectively stopped by 1648. An attempt to re-institute it in 1703 was resisted by its Ottoman members, who coveted the military and civilian posts. Finally, in the early days of Ahmet III&#x27;s reign, the practice of devshirme was abolished. In modern times, the Devshirme is considered to fall within the definition of genocide.

== History ==
The devshirme (from the Turkish word meaning &#x27;to collect&#x27;) came up out of the system of slavery that developed in the early centuries of the Ottoman Empire, and which reached this final development during the reign of Sultan Bayazit I. The were mostly prisoners from war, hostages or slaves that were purchased by the state. The Ottoman Empire, beginning with Murad I, felt a need to &quot;counteract the power of (Turkic) nobles by developing Christian vassal soldiers and converted as his personal troops, independent of the regular army.&quot; This elite force, which served the Ottoman Sultan directly, was called (The Hearth of the Porte Servants). They were divided into two main groups: cavalry and infantry. The cavalry was commonly known as the (The Cavalry of the Servants of the Porte) and the infantry as the janissaries (, meaning &quot;the New Corps&quot;). The devshirme conscripts were set apart from the janissaries in that they were not a cavalry group, rather exclusively infantry.

At first, the soldiers serving in these corps were selected from the slaves captured during war. However, a new system commonly known as devshirme was soon adopted. In this system, children of the rural Christian populations of the Balkans were conscripted before adolescence and were brought up as Muslims. Upon reaching adolescence, these children were enrolled in one of the four imperial institutions: the palace, the scribes, the Muslim clergy, and the military. Those enrolled in the military would become either part of the Janissary corps (1363), or part of another corps. The most promising were sent to the palace school (), where they were destined for a career within the palace itself and could attain the highest office of state, Grand Vizier, the Sultan&#x27;s powerful chief minister and military deputy. In the beginning of the Ottoman Empire, this office was held only by Turks. However, after there were problems between sultan Mehmed II and the Turkish Çandarlı Halil Pasha the Younger, who became the first grand vizier to be executed, there was a rise of slave administrators devshirme. They were much easier to control for the sultans, as compared to free administrators of Turkish noble origin. They were also less subject to influence from court factions. From the very beginning, the Turcoman were a danger that undermined the Sultan&#x27;s creation of a strong state. Thus, the establishment of this class counterbalanced the Turkish nobility, who sometimes opposed the Sultan.

An early Greek source mentioning devshirme () is a speech by Archbishop Isidore Glabas, made on 28 February 1395, titled: &quot;On the abduction of children according to sultan&#x27;s order and on the Future Judgment&quot;. The speech includes references to the violent Islamization of children and their hard training in the use of dogs and falcons.

A reference to devshirme is made in a poem composed in Greek by Ioannes Axayiolis, who appeals to Emperor Charles V of Germany to liberate the Christians from the Turks. The text is found in the of 1624. In another account, the Roman Catholic bishop of Chios in 1646 writes to the director of the Catholic Greek Gymnasion of Rome asking the latter to accept Paulos Omeros, a 12-year-old boy from Chios, to save him from the devshirme.

The recruitment of children took place every three to four years and at times even annually, according to the needs of the Sultan. The largest loss of children coincided with the peak of Ottoman expansion in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries under the rule of Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent.

== The life of the devshirme ==
According to historian William Gervase Clarence-Smith, Christian children were taken by Ottoman officials, every four to seven years, their age ranging from 7 to 20. Those younger than 8 were called (nursling) and (child). One for every forty households was chosen, they had to be unmarried and once taken were ordered to cut all ties with their family.

Christian parents undeniably resented the forced recruitment of their children, as a result they would beg and often seek to buy their children out of the levy. The Balkan peasantry tried to evade the tribute collectors, with many attempting to substitute their children in Bosnia. Many sources (including Paolo Giovio) mention different ways to avoid the devshirme such as: marrying the boys at the age of 12, mutilating them or have both father and son convert to Islam. Conversion to Islam was used in Bosnia and Herzegovina to escape the system. In Albania and Epirus the practice led to a Christian revolt where the inhabitants killed the recruiting officials in the year 1565. In Naousa, after killing the recruiting officials the parents fled to the mountains but were later caught and executed in 1705.

Any parent who refused to have their child taken as a slave was put to death, and children who attempted to resist being taken from their families as janissaries by fleeing would lead to the Turks arresting and then torturing their parents to death (Many children who attempted to flee on their own returned after hearing of their parents torture). Such was the case of an Athenian boy who returned from hiding to save his father&#x27;s life but chose to die himself rather than abandon his faith and convert to Islam. A firman in 1601 gave strict orders to Ottoman officials to kill any parent that resisted:
Sources show that it was not rare for the older youth to attempt to preserve their faith and some recollection of their homeland and their families. For instance, Stephan Gerlach writes:
Greek scholar Janus Lascaris visited Constantinople in 1491 and met many janissaries who not only remembered their former religion and their native land but also favored their former coreligionists. The renegade Hersek, the sultan&#x27;s relative by marriage, told him that he regretted having left the religion of his fathers and that he prayed at night before the cross which he kept carefully concealed.

In his memoir, Konstantin Mihailović (1430–1501), a Serbian who was abducted in his youth and marched away by the Turks, saw nothing “prestigious” or “lucrative” about becoming a janissary. “We always thought about killing the Turks and running away by ourselves among the mountains,” he writes, “but our youth did not permit us to do that.” Once when he and a group of other boys broke free and escaped, “the whole region pursued us, and having caught and bound us, they beat us and tortured us and dragged us behind horses.”

It is said that: &quot;Even those personally chosen by the Sultan found nothing admirable about their lot.&quot; After Ottoman Sultan Murad II took eight Christian youths into his service, they made a pact to assassinate him by night, saying “If we kill this Turkish dog, then all of Christendom will be freed [from Ottoman tyranny]; but if we are caught, then we will become martyrs before God with the others.” When their plot was exposed, and Murad inquired what caused them to “dare attempt this,” they responded, “None other than our great sorrow for our fathers and dear friends.” He had the children slowly tortured over the course of a year before beheading them.

On the other hand, since the devshirme could reach powerful positions, some Muslim families tried to have the recruiters take their sons so that they could achieve professional advancement. Sometimes people of both religion, or family in great needs, attempted to bribe scouts to take their children. The boys were forced to convert to Islam.

In Epirus, a traditional folk song expressed this resentment by cursing the Sultan and admonishing against the kidnapping of boys:

The Tübingen manuscript written by Andre Argyros and John Tholoites and given to Martin Crusius in 1585 shows what the Christian parents thought of the Janissaries:
Stephen Gerlach gives the case of a Greek Mother from Panormus in Anatolia who had two boys and begged God every day to take them away because she would soon be forced to give up one of them. The distress expressed here was motivated not only by religious considerations, but also by the low opinion the Byzantines held for Turks (whom they called barbarians).

In desperation the parents would appeal to the Pope and western powers for help. A petition of the Albanians of Himarë in the year 1581, addressed to the Pope reads: &quot;Holiest father, if you could convince him and save us and the children of Greece, that are taken every day and are turned into Turks, if you could only do this, God may bless you. Amen”.

In 1456 Greeks living on the western coast of Anatolia appealed to the Knights Hospitalers of Rhodes for help.
The children were taken from their families and transported to Istanbul. Upon their arrival, they were forcibly converted to Islam, examined and made to serve the empire. The system produced infantry corps soldiers as well as civilian administrators and high-ranked military officials.&quot; Their village, district and province, parentage, date of birth, and physical appearance was recorded. Albertus Bobovius wrote in 1686 that diseases were common among the devshirme and that strict discipline was enforced. Although the influence of Turkic nobility continued in the Ottoman court until Mehmet II (see Çandarlı Halil), the Ottoman ruling class slowly came to be ruled exclusively by the devshirme, creating a separate social class. This class of rulers was chosen from the brightest of devshirme and handpicked to serve in the palace institution, known as the Enderûn. They had to accompany the Sultan on campaigns, but exceptional service would be rewarded by assignments outside the palace. Those chosen for the scribe institution, known as , were also granted prestigious positions. At the religious institution, İlmiye, all orthodox Muslim clergy of the Ottoman Empire were educated and sent to provinces or served in the capital.

The children were subjected to a draconian training system: “They make them drudge day and night, and they give them no bed to sleep on and very little food.” They were allowed to “speak to each other only when it is urgently necessary” and were made to “pray together without fail at four prescribed times every day.” As “for any little offense, they beat them cruelly with sticks, rarely hitting them less than a hundred times, and often as much as a thousand. After punishments the boys have to come to them and kiss their clothing and thank them for the cudgelings they have received. You can see, then, that moral degradation and humiliation are part of the training system,” writes 16th century Italian diplomat Giovan Francesco Morosini (cardinal). They were “degraded to the level of animals” and showed a “dog-like devotion to the sultan”, writes Vasiliki Papouli. Many possibly suffered from Stockholm Syndrome.

Tavernier noted in 1678 that the janissaries looked more like a religious order than a military corps. The members of the organization were not banned from marriage, as Tavernier further noted, but it was very uncommon for them. He went on to write that their numbers had increased to a hundred thousand but only due to a degeneration of regulations, with many of them in fact being &quot;fake&quot; janissaries, posing as such for tax exemptions and other social privileges. He noted that the actual number of janissaries was in fact much lower. Shaw writes that their number was 30,000 under Suleiman the Magnificent. By the 1650s, the number of janissaries had increased to 50,000, but by this time, the devshirme had largely been abandoned as a method of recruitment.

According to Cleveland, the devshirme system offered &quot;limitless opportunities to the young men who became a part of it.&quot; Basilike Papoulia wrote that &quot;the devishirme was the &#x27;forcible removal&#x27;, in the form of a tribute, of children of the Christian subjects from their ethnic, religious and cultural environment and their transportation into the Turkish-Islamic environment with the aim of employing them in the service of the Palace, the army, and the state, whereby they were on the one hand to serve the Sultan as slaves and freedmen and on the other to form the ruling class of the State.&quot; Accordingly, Papoulia agrees with Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb and Harold Bowen, authors of &quot;Islamic Society and the West&quot;, that the devshirme was a penalization imposed on the Balkan peoples since their ancestors had resisted the Ottoman invasion. Vladimir Minorsky states, &quot;The most striking manifestation of this fact is the unprecedented system of devshirme, i.e. the periodic conscription of &#x27;tribute boys&#x27;, by which the children of Christians were wrung from their families, churches, and communities to be molded into Ottoman praetorians owing their allegiance to the Sultan and the official faith of Islam.&quot; This system as explained by Çandarlı Kara Halil Hayreddin Pasha, founder of the Janissaries: &quot;The conquered are slaves of the conquerors, to whom their goods, their women, and their children belong as lawful possession&quot;.

== Status under Islamic law ==
According to scholars, the practice of devshirme was a clear violation of sharia or Islamic law. David Nicolle writes that since the boys were &quot;effectively enslaved&quot; under the devshirme system, this was a violation of the protections guaranteed under Islamic law to People of the Book. The practice of devshirme also involved forced conversions to Islam. This is disputed by Turkish historian Halil İnalcık, who argues that the devshirme were not slaves once converted to Islam.

Some scholars point out that the early Ottoman Empire did not care about the details of sharia and thus did not see any problems with devshirme. During this time, the Ottomans believed that the Qanun, the law enacted by the Sultan, superseded sharia even though the latter was treated with respect. The devshirme was just one example in which the Sultan&#x27;s wishes superseded the sharia (another example is that Ottoman sultans set maximum interest rates even though sharia totally prohibits interest). James L. Gelvin explains that Ottoman jurists were able to get around that injunction with an extraordinarily creative legal manoeuvre by arguing that although Islamic tradition forbade the enslavement of Christians, Balkan Christians were different because they had converted to Christianity after the advent of Islam. (This was true of most rural Christians in the Balkans, but not the Greeks.) William Gervase Clarence-Smith points out that the reasoning is not accepted in the Hanafi school of law, which the Ottoman Empire claimed to have practiced.

Contemporary Ottoman chroniclers had mixed opinions on the practice. An Ottoman historian of the 1500s, Mustafa Âlî, admitted that devshirme violated sharia but was allowed only out of necessity. Others argued the Muslim conqueror had the right to one fifth of war booty and could thus take the Christian boys; however, Islamic law allows no such booty from communities that had submitted peacefully to conquest and certainly not from their descendants.

== Ethnicity of the devshirme and exemptions ==
The devshirme were collected once every four or five years from rural provinces in Eastern Europe, Southeastern Europe and Anatolia. They were mainly collected from Christian subjects, with a few exceptions. However, some Muslim families managed to smuggle their sons in anyway. The devshirme levy was not applied to the major cities of the empire, and children of local craftsmen in rural towns were also exempt, as it was considered that conscripting them would harm the economy.

According to Bernard Lewis, the janissaries were mainly recruited from the Slavic and Albanian populations of the Balkans. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica and the Encyclopaedia of Islam, in the early days of the empire, all Christians were enrolled indiscriminately. Later, those from Albania, Bosnia and Bulgaria were preferred. What is certain is that devshirme were primarily recruited from Christians living in the Balkans. Since Muslim Bosnians were the only Muslim ethnic group allowed to be recruited, an armed guard was required to lead the Bosnians on their way to Istanbul to avoid any Turkish boys from being smuggled into their ranks.

Jews were exempt from this service. Armenians are also believed to have been exempt from the levy by many scholars, although a 1997 publication that examined Armenian colophons from the 15th to the 17th centuries and foreign travelers of the time concluded that Armenians were not exempt. Boys who were orphans or were their family&#x27;s only son were exempt.

Well-known examples of Ottomans who had been recruited as devshirme include Skanderbeg, Sinan Pasha and Sokollu Mehmed Pasha.

=== Unifying factor ===
The diversity of the devshirme also served as a unifying factor for the Ottoman Empire. Greeks, Armenians, Albanians, and other ethnicities would see that the Sultan was Turkish, but his viziers were Albanian, Bulgarian, Greek and other ethnicities. The ethnic diversity in high-level and powerful positions of the Ottoman Empire helped to unite the diverse groups under its jurisdiction. They also prevented a hereditary aristocracy from forming but held sway over the Sultan themselves and practically formed their own aristocracy.

== Devshirme in the Ottoman Palace School ==

The primary objective of the Palace School was to train the ablest children for leadership positions, either as military leaders or as high administrators to serve the Devlet. Although there are many resemblances between Enderûn and other palace schools of the previous civilizations, such as those of the Abbasids, the Seljuks or the contemporary European palace schools, Enderûn was unique with respect to the background of the student body and its meritocratic system. In the strict draft phase, students were taken forcefully from the Christian population of the Empire and were converted to Islam. Jews and Roma were exempted from devshirme and so were all Muslims.

Those entrusted to find those children were scouts, who were specially-trained agents, throughout the Balkans. Scouts were recruiting youngsters according to their talent and ability with school subjects, in addition to their personality, character and physical perfection. The Enderûn candidates were not supposed to be orphans or the only child in their family to ensure that the candidates had strong family values. They also had to not have already learned to speak Turkish or a craft or trade. The ideal age of a recruit was between 10 and 20 years of age. Mehmed Refik Beg mentioned that a youth with a bodily defect, no matter how slight, was never admitted into palace service, since Turks believed that a strong soul and a good mind could be found only in a perfect body.

The selected children were dressed in red so that they could not easily escape on their way to Constantinople. The cost of the devshirme service and their clothes were paid by their villages or communities. The boys were gathered into cohorts of a hundred or more to walk to Constantinople, where they were circumcised and divided between the palace schools and the military training. Anyone not chosen for the palace spent years being toughened by hard labor on farms in Anatolia until they were old enough for the military.

The brightest youths who fit into the general guidelines and had a strong primary education were then given to selected Muslim families across Anatolia to complete the enculturation process. They would later attend schools across Anatolia to complete their training for six to seven years to qualify as ordinary military officers. They would get the highest salaries amongst the administrators of the empire and very well respected in public.

== Eunuchs ==
White eunuchs were sometimes recruited from among the devshirme. Unlike the black eunuchs, who were usually castrated in their place of origin, the devshirme were castrated at the palace. The palace eunuchs who supervised them often came from the same background as the devshirme (the Balkans). A considerable number of eunuchs of devshirme origin went on to hold important positions in the government and the military, and many of them became grand vizier, like Hadım Ali Pasha, Sinan Borovinić, Hadım Hasan Pasha, Hadim Mesih Pasha and Hadım Mehmed Pasha. Others, like Sofu Hadım Ali Pasha, Hadım Şehabeddin, Hadım Yakup Pasha of Bosnia, Hadım Ali Pasha of Buda, Hadım Suleiman Pasha and his namesake Hadım Suleiman Pasha, became prominent admirals and generals.

== Decline ==
According to the historian Cemal Kafadar, one of the main reasons for the decline of the devshirme system was that the size of the janissary corps had to be expanded to compensate for the decline in the importance of the sipahi cavalry forces, which itself was a result of changes in early modern warfare such as the introduction of firearms and increased importance of infantry. Indeed, the janissary corps would soon become the empire&#x27;s largest single military corps. As a result, by the late 16th century, the devshirme system had become increasingly abandoned for less rigid recruitment methods, which allowed Muslims to enter directly into the janissary corps.

In 1632, the janissaries attempted an unsuccessful coup against Murad IV, who then imposed a loyalty oath on them. In 1638 or 1648, the devshirme-based recruiting system of the janissary corps formally came to an end. In an order sent in multiple copies to authorities throughout the European provinces in 1666, a devshirme recruitment target of between 300 and 320 was set for an area covering the whole of the central and western Balkans. On the accession of sultan Suleiman II in 1687, only 130 janissary inductees were graduated to the janissary ranks. The system was finally abolished in the early part of Ahmet III&#x27;s reign (1703–1730).

After Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798, there was a reform movement in Sultan Selim III&#x27;s regime to reduce the numbers of the askeri class, who were the first class citizens or military class (also called janissaries). Selim was taken prisoner and murdered by the janissaries. The successor to the sultan, Mahmud II, was patient but remembered the results of the uprising in 1807. In 1826, he created the basis of a new modern army, the Asakir-i Mansure-i Muhammediye, which caused a revolt among the janissaries. The authorities kept the janissaries in their barracks and slaughtered thousands of them. That development entered the Ottoman history annals as the Auspicious Incident.

<text>Claude Nougaro (, ; 9 September 1929 – 4 March 2004) was a French jazz singer and poet.

==Life and career==
Claude Nougaro was born on 9 September 1929 in Toulouse to a respected French opera singer, Pierre Nougaro, and a piano teacher, Liette Tellini. His maternal grandparents were Italian; his grandfather was born in Livorno, Tuscany and his grandmother in San Damiano d&#x27;Asti, Piedmont. He was raised by his grandparents in Toulouse where he heard Glenn Miller, Édith Piaf and Louis Armstrong (among others) on the radio. In 1947 he failed his baccalaureat and began a career in journalism, writing for various journals including &quot;Le Journal des Curistes&quot; at Vichy and &quot;L&#x27;Echo d&#x27;Alger&quot;. At the same time he wrote songs for Marcel Amont (&quot;Le barbier de Belleville&quot;, &quot;Le balayeur du roi&quot;) and Philippe Clay (&quot;Joseph&quot;, &quot;La sentinelle&quot;). He met Georges Brassens, who became his friend and mentor.

In 1949, he performed his military service in the Foreign Legion at Rabat, Morocco.

He sent his lyrics to Marguerite Monnot, Édith Piaf&#x27;s songwriter, who put them to music. (&quot;Méphisto&quot;, &quot;Le Sentier de la guerre&quot;). He started to sing for a livelihood in 1959 in a Parisian cabaret in Montmartre, the Lapin Agile.

In 1962, he decided to sing his works himself: &quot;Une petite fille&quot; and &quot;Cécile ma fille&quot; (dedicated to his daughter, born in 1962, and to his wife Sylvie, whom he met at the Lapin Agile). These songs made him immediately known to a larger public, which he had already started to penetrate by participating in the concerts of Dalida. A car accident immobilised him for several months in 1963. The following year he travelled to Brazil, and sang in prestigious halls: the Olympia and the Théâtre de la Ville in Paris, and the Palais d&#x27;Hiver in Lyon. Following the death of his friend Jacques Audiberti in 1965 Nougaro wrote, in homage, the song &quot;Chanson pour le maçon&quot;. The events of May 1968 inspired him to the torrential &quot;Paris Mai&quot;, a plea for life, which would be banned from the airwaves. The same year he recorded his first live album at the Olympia: &quot;Une soirée avec Claude Nougaro&quot;.

His career continued normally, punctuated by success: &quot;Le jazz et la java&quot;, &quot;Tu verras&quot;, &quot;Île de Ré&quot;, &quot;Armstrong&quot;, &quot;Toulouse&quot;, &quot;Petit taureau&quot;. But in 1984, his recording company did not renew his contract. Nougaro left for New York, seeking inspiration, and while there wrote and recorded a self-financed disc, &quot;Nougayork&quot;, whose resounding success was a surprise. In 1988 Victoires de la musique rewarded him with &quot;best album&quot; and &quot;best artist&quot;, and between 1993 and 1997 he released three new albums.

His health deteriorated after 1995, when he underwent a heart operation. In 2003, his condition left him unable to appear at the Festival du Verbe at Toulouse. From 1998 to 2004 he devoted himself more to concerts and festivals, apart from an album in aid of children suffering from AIDS. Having undergone further surgery in early 2004, he died of cancer in March, at the age of 74.

She was named after the German town Minden and the Battle of Minden of 1759, a decisive victory of British and Prussian forces over France in the Seven Years&#x27; War. The town is about 75 km away from Hanover, from where the House of Hanover comes—the dynasty which ruled the United Kingdom from 1714 until 1901.

==Construction==

Jamsetjee Bomanjee Wadia of the Wadia Group built &quot;Minden&quot;. She was launched from the Duncan Docks in Bombay, India, and was built of teak.

The &quot;Bombay Courier&quot;, 23 June 1810 wrote:“On Tuesday last His Majesty’s Ship, the &quot;Minden&quot; built in the new docks (Bombay) by Jamsetji Bomanji Wadia was floated into the stream at high water, after the usual ceremony of breaking the bottle had been performed by the Honorable Governor Jonathan Duncan. Also In having produced the &quot;Minden&quot;, Bombay is entitled to the distinguished praise of providing the first and only British ship of the line built out of the limits of the Mother Country; and in the opinion of very competent judges, the &quot;Minden&quot;, for beauty of construction and strength of frame, may stand in competition with any man-o-war that has come out of the most celebrated Dockyards of Great Britain. For the skill of its architects, for the superiority of its timber, and for the excellence of its docks, Bombay may now claim a distinguished place among naval arsenals”.

==Service history==
&quot;Minden&quot; sailed from Bombay on 8 February 1811 on her first cruise, under the command of Edward Wallis Hoare, and manned by the crew of the . In March she sailed from Madras to take part in the invasion of Java. On 29 July two of her boats, under the command of Lieutenant Edmund Lyons, with only 35 officers and men aboard, attacked and captured the fort covering the harbour of Marrack, to the westward of Batavia. The Naval General Service Medal with the clasp &quot;30 July Boat Service 1811&quot; was issued to survivors of this action in 1848. The Dutch and French forces in Java surrendered in September. &quot;Minden&quot; then sailed for the UK and escorted convoys to the East Indies, the Cape of Good Hope, South America, and the coast of Africa.

&quot;Minden&quot; sailed from Portsmouth under Captain Alexander Skene on 6 August 1812 arriving at Madras, India on 29 January 1813 where she then served as the flagship of Vice Admiral Sir Samuel Hood, Commander in Chief of the East Indies Station. While there, she was first commanded by Captain William Webley, then by Captain Joseph Prior, and thereafter (20 April 1814) by Captain George Henderson (until 14 January 1815). &quot;In the summer of 1814 [Admiral Hood] made a voyage, in his majesty’s ship &quot;Minden&quot;, to the eastern parts of his station.” He eventually arrived at Semarang, Java on 29 June 1814. Hood then &quot;sailed on the &quot;Minden&quot; from Batavia on 1 August 1814 for Madras, where he [later] died on 24 December of that year.”. The &quot;Minden&quot; remained in the East Indies until September 1815 when she returned to England, arriving at Portsmouth on 4 February 1816.

[A number of blogs and articles on the internet repeat an old myth that HMS &quot;Minden&quot; saw service during the War of 1812 in the Chesapeake Bay and that Francis Scott Key was aboard her when he wrote the words which became the lyrics for &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

 Such claims have been proven wrong by over 100 official British documents, newspaper accounts from that time, and from personal first-hand accounts. (See preceding paragraph and also these sources:) ]

In late July 1816 &quot;Minden&quot; sailed from Plymouth Sound, as part of an Anglo-Dutch fleet that made an attack on Algiers on 27 August. The Naval General Service Medal with the clasp &quot;Algiers&quot; was issued to survivors of this battle in 1848.

&quot;Minden&quot; then sailed for the East Indies, and was reported to be at Trincomalee in 1819. In July 1830 &quot;Minden&quot; was at Plymouth. She was commissioned there on 19 March 1836 and sailed for the Tagus joining the British squadron. In 1839 she was at Malta, returning to Plymouth in early 1840.
She was at Devonport dockyard when it suffered severe damage in a large scale fire on 25 September 1840, it started in the North Dock on which was completely gutted, spread to the &quot;Minden&quot; whose fire was successfully put out, and spread to nearby buildings and equipment.

A typhoon destroyed the shore-based Royal Naval Hospital at Hong Kong on 22 July 1841, and &quot;Minden&quot; was commissioned at Plymouth in December 1841 to serve as a hospital ship there. She was stationed at Hong Kong as a hospital ship from 1842 until she was replaced by in 1846. &quot;Minden&quot; then served there as stores ship until sold for scrapping in August 1861.

In memory of the ship, two streets were named after her, Minden Row and Minden Avenue, located behind Signal Hill of Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon, Hong Kong.

<doc id="505806" wikidata="Q269153" url="?curid=505806" title="Kay Kendall">
<text>Justine Kay Kendall McCarthy (21 May 1927 – 6 September 1959) was an English actress and comedienne. She began her film career in the musical film &quot;London Town&quot; (1946), a financial failure. Kendall worked regularly until her appearance in the comedy film &quot;Genevieve&quot; (1953) brought her widespread recognition. Prolific in British films, Kendall also achieved some popularity with American audiences, and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her role in the musical-comedy film &quot;Les Girls&quot; (1957).

She began a romantic relationship with actor Rex Harrison after they appeared together in the comedy film &quot;The Constant Husband&quot; (1955) and they were married in 1957. Harrison learned from Kendall&#x27;s doctor that she had been diagnosed with myeloid leukaemia, a fact that was kept from Kendall, who believed she was suffering from an iron deficiency. The actor cared for Kendall until her death in 1959 at the age of 32.

==Early life==
Kendall was born at Stanley House, Hull Road, in Withernsea, a coastal resort in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. Kendall&#x27;s father was Terrence &quot;Terry&quot; McCarthy (a.k.a. Terry Kendall) (1901-1994), the vaudevillian son of music hall star Marie Kendall (1873–1964). Kay&#x27;s mother was the former Gladys Drewery (1900–1990).

She had two elder siblings, Terrence Justin &quot;Terry&quot; Kendall McCarthy (born 1923) and Patricia Kim &quot;Pat&quot; Kendall McCarthy (a.k.a. Kim Kendall, born 1925). By her father&#x27;s second marriage to his professional dancing partner, Dora Spencer, she had a younger half-brother, Cavan Spencer Kendall McCarthy (a.k.a. Cavan Kendall) (1942–1999). Young Justine attended various schools, including St Leonard&#x27;s (Brighton), St Margaret&#x27;s (near Oban, Scotland), and the Lydia Kyasht Dancing Academy (London).

==Career==
Her first major screen role was in the 1946 musical &quot;London Town&quot;, one of the more expensive flops in British film history. She co-starred with Petula Clark again in the drama film &quot;Dance Hall&quot; (1950), and was featured in a quick succession of minor films before achieving fame in &quot;Genevieve&quot; (1953).

She followed this film with the even more popular first film in the &quot;Doctor&quot; series, the comedy &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; (1954) with her friend Dirk Bogarde. She was under contract to the Rank Organisation but unhappy with the parts offered, turning down &quot;Value for Money&quot; (1955), &quot;As Long as They&#x27;re Happy&quot; (1955) and &quot;Doctor at Sea&quot; (1955).

She appeared in the drama &quot;Simon and Laura&quot; (1955) with Peter Finch; the comedy &quot;Abdulla the Great&quot; (1955) with Sydney Chaplin and Gregory Ratoff; and the epic historical film &quot;The Adventures of Quentin Durward&quot; (1955), with Robert Taylor and Robert Morley. In October 1956, John Davis, managing director of Rank, announced her as one of the actors under contract that Davis thought would become an international star.

In October and November 1957, she appeared in two episodes of the short-lived American television series &quot;The Polly Bergen Show&quot;. and also starred as herself in Series 3 episode 17 of &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; on 17 January 1958. The production title was &quot;Phil Silvers Presents Kay Kendall&quot;.

In 1958, Kendall won a Golden Globe Award for her performance as Lady Sybil Wren in &quot;Les Girls&quot;, the story of three showgirls in postwar Paris (with Mitzi Gaynor and Taina Elg). The following year she starred opposite Harrison in the comedy &quot;The Reluctant Debutante&quot;.

Kendall died in 1959, aged 32, soon after completing her last film, the comedy &quot;Once More, with Feeling!&quot; (1960), starring opposite Yul Brynner.

===Critical assessment===
Stanley Donen, who produced and directed &quot;Once More, with Feeling!&quot;, said: &quot;She was completely unpredictable. She was an instinctive comedienne with a real clown sense. No one has had it since Carole Lombard – and Kay was a better actress.&quot;

&quot;As they say about crime victims, Kay Kendall was in the wrong place at the wrong time,&quot; wrote Rhoda Koenig, a critic writing for &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2006. &quot;In her case, the crime was a waste of talent. One of the most delightful of British actresses... few of her films gave her a chance to shine. A natural screwball heroine, Kendall was born too late for the 1930s comedies in which she would have been the equal of the scatty but scintillating Carole Lombard or Claudette Colbert, and too soon for the naughtiness and absurdity of the 1960s... Kendall was beautiful and funny. She was a true comedienne, unafraid to compromise her ladylike appearance with pratfalls, pop eyes and comic drunk scenes. Kendall could get away with such antics without looking vulgar.&quot;

==Personal life==
Early in her career, Kendall had a lengthy romance with actor Sydney Chaplin, the second son of actor Charlie Chaplin by his second wife, actress Lita Grey. She also had affairs with a Swedish prince and grocery heir James Sainsbury and reportedly had a romance with the future Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

In 1955, she starred opposite Rex Harrison in &quot;The Constant Husband&quot;, and they had an affair. Harrison was married to actress Lilli Palmer at the time. However, when he learned from Kendall&#x27;s doctor that she had been diagnosed with myeloid leukaemia, he and Palmer agreed to divorce so that he could marry Kendall and provide for her care. Kendall married Harrison in 1957.

Kendall never was told of her illness and believed she merely had an iron deficiency. Regarding the divorce, Palmer said she was not upset because she had a lover too. Palmer and Harrison planned to remarry after Kendall&#x27;s death, but Palmer fell in love with her companion, actor Carlos Thompson, and married him.

==Death==
Kendall&#x27;s gravesite is in the churchyard of St John-at-Hampstead Church. Part of the inscription on her gravestone reads &quot;KATE / Deeply loved wife of / REX&quot;. In September 2013 her final resting place was restored by the Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America.
==Legacy==
Kendall&#x27;s life is recounted in the 2002 biography &quot;The Brief, Madcap Life of Kay Kendall&quot; by Eve Golden and Kim Elizabeth Kendall.

Situated near where Kendall once lived, the late 19th-century lighthouse in Withernsea houses a museum that contains exhibits dedicated to local history, including a memorial to Kendall and displays of many artifacts and photographs associated with her life and times.

The Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund supports scientific research into leukaemia.

On 6 September 2014, a blue plaque commemorating Kay Kendall was erected by the Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America and unveiled at her former home in Withernsea to mark the 55th anniversary of her death.

<text>Concord Records is an American record label owned by Concord and based in Los Angeles, California. Concord Records was launched in 1995 as an imprint designed to reach beyond the company&#x27;s foundational Concord Jazz label. The label&#x27;s artists have won 14 GRAMMY Awards and 88 GRAMMY nominations.

The original logo, a stylized eighth note incorporating the C and J of &quot;Concord Jazz&quot;, was created by Bay Area graphic designer Dan Buck, who also worked on several album covers for the company.

==History==
In 1999, Concord Records was purchased by a consortium led by Hal Gaba and television producer Norman Lear. Its offices were moved from Concord, California to Beverly Hills in 2002. That same year, Concord partnered with Starbucks to release Ray Charles&#x27;s &quot;Genius Loves Company&quot;, which won eight GRAMMY Awards, including Album of the Year.

Concord Records purchased the Fantasy Label Group in 2004, and in December 2006 announced the reactivation of the Stax Records label as a forum for newly recorded music.

In 2005, it was announced that Concord Records had purchased Telarc Records and its subsidiary Heads Up, in a deal whose terms were not divulged.

In 2007, Concord Records started the Hear Music label in association with Starbucks, signing such artists as Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell, and John Mellencamp. Although Starbucks ceased to be an active partner a year later, Concord kept Hear active, having a Top 5 album in 2010 with Carole King and James Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Live at the Troubadour&quot;.

In 2008, Village Roadshow Pictures Group and Concord Music Group completed their merger, resulting in the creation of the Village Roadshow Entertainment Group.

Kenny G signed to Concord in early 2008, Herb Alpert in early 2009. On June 5, 2009, Dave Koz signed to Concord.

In 2010, it was announced that Paul McCartney&#x27;s solo and Wings catalogs would be globally distributed by Concord Music Group.

<doc id="505811" wikidata="Q3176269" url="?curid=505811" title="Joe Morgan">
<text>Joe Leonard Morgan (September 19, 1943 – October 11, 2020) was an American professional baseball second baseman who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Colt .45s / Astros, Cincinnati Reds, San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, and Oakland Athletics from 1963 to 1984. He won two World Series championships with the Reds in 1975 and 1976 and was also named the National League Most Valuable Player in each of those years. Considered one of the greatest second basemen of all time, Morgan was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990 in his first year of eligibility.

After retiring as an active player, Morgan became a baseball broadcaster for the Reds, Giants, ABC, and ESPN, as well as a stint in the mid-to-late 1990s on NBC&#x27;s postseason telecasts, teamed with Bob Costas and Bob Uecker. He hosted a weekly nationally syndicated radio show on Sports USA, while serving as a special advisor to the Reds.

==Playing career==
Morgan was African American and the oldest of six children. Born in Bonham, Texas, he lived there until he was five years old. His family then moved to Oakland, California. Morgan was nicknamed &quot;Little Joe&quot; for his diminutive stature. As a youth, he played American Legion baseball on a team sponsored by Post 471 in Oakland. Morgan was a standout baseball player at Castlemont High School, but did not receive any offers from major league teams due to his size. He played college baseball at Oakland City College before being signed by the Houston Colt .45s as an amateur free agent in 1962, receiving a $3,000 signing bonus and a $500 per month salary.

=== Houston Colt .45s/Astros ===
Morgan made his major league baseball debut on September 21, 1963. Despite going on to win multiple World Series and MVPs for the Reds, he said his debut for the Colt .45s was the highlight of his career.
Early in his career, Morgan struggled with his swing because he kept his back elbow down too low. Teammate Nellie Fox (also a stocky second baseman) suggested to Morgan that while at the plate he should flap his back arm like a chicken to keep his elbow up. Morgan followed the advice, and his flapping arm became his signature.

Morgan played his first nine major league seasons for the Houston Astros, compiling 72 home runs and 219 stolen bases. He was named an All-Star twice during this period, in 1966 and 1970. On June 25, 1966, Morgan was struck on the kneecap by a line drive (hit by Lee Maye) during batting practice. The broken kneecap forced Morgan out of the lineup for 40 games, during which the Astros went 11–29 (for a .275 winning percentage).

Although Morgan played with distinction for Houston, the Astros wanted more power in their lineup. Additionally, manager Harry Walker considered Morgan a troublemaker. As a result, they traded Morgan to the Cincinnati Reds as part of a blockbuster multi-player deal on November 29, 1971, announced at baseball&#x27;s winter meetings.

===Cincinnati Reds===
To this day the aforementioned trade is considered an epoch-making deal for Cincinnati, although at the time many experts felt that the Astros got the better end of the deal. Power-hitting Lee May, All-Star second baseman Tommy Helms, and outfielder/pinch hitter Jimmy Stewart went to the Astros. In addition to Morgan, included in the deal to the Reds were César Gerónimo (who became their regular right fielder and then center fielder), starting pitcher Jack Billingham, veteran infielder Denis Menke, and minor league outfielder Ed Armbrister. Morgan joined leadoff hitter Pete Rose as prolific catalysts at the top of the Reds&#x27; lineup. Morgan added home run power, not always displayed with the Astros in the cavernous Astrodome, outstanding speed and excellent defense.
As part of the Big Red Machine, Morgan made eight consecutive All-Star Game appearances (1972–79) to go along with his 1966 and 1970 appearances with Houston. Morgan, along with teammates Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, Tony Pérez, and Dave Concepción, led the Reds to consecutive championships in the World Series. He drove in Ken Griffey for the winning run in Game 7 of the 1975 World Series. Morgan was also the National League MVP in 1975 and 1976. He was the first second baseman in the history of the National League to win the MVP back to back. In Morgan&#x27;s NL MVP years he combined for a .324 batting average, 44 home runs, 205 runs batted in, 246 bases on balls, and 127 stolen bases.

Morgan was an extremely capable hitter—especially in clutch situations. While his lifetime average was only .271, he hit between .288 and .327 during his peak years with the Reds. Additionally, he drew many walks, resulting in an excellent .392 on-base percentage. He also hit 268 home runs to go with his 449 doubles and 96 triples, excellent power for a middle infielder of his era, and was considered by some the finest base stealer of his generation (689 steals at greater than 80% success rate). Besides his prowess at the plate and on the bases, Morgan was an exceptional infielder, winning the Gold Glove Award in consecutive years from 1973 to 1977. His short height proved an asset to him, as he had one of baseball&#x27;s smallest strike zones. &quot;The umpires gave him everything. If he didn&#x27;t swing at the pitch, it was a ball,&quot; recalled Tommy John.

===Later career===
Morgan returned to Houston in 1980 as a free agent on a reported contract of $255,000 for one season. He helped the young Astros win the NL West, batting .243 in 141 games while leading the league in walks with 93. The Astros then lost the National League Championship Series to the Philadelphia Phillies. Morgan bristled with team manager Bill Virdon at being taken out in late innings for Rafael Landestoy. Late in the year, Morgan expressed to one reporter his doubt in playing for Virdon again.

Morgan signed onto the San Francisco Giants for the next two seasons. The 1982 season had a bumpy start for the team, but they were neck and neck for second place with the Los Angeles Dodgers (each behind Atlanta) with a three-game set to possibly determine the division race. The Dodgers eliminated San Francisco on the second-to-last day, but Morgan hit a go-ahead three run home run to give the Giants a lead they would not relinquish that saw Los Angeles eliminated in favor of the Braves winning the NL West; Morgan batted .240 and played in just 90 games, his lowest number of games played since 1968. Morgan won the 1982 Willie Mac Award for his spirit and leadership. He batted .289 in 134 games the following season for the Giants.
Morgan was acquired along with Al Holland by the Phillies from the Giants for Mike Krukow, Mark Davis and minor-league outfielder C.L. Penigar on December 14, 1982. He was reunited with former Reds teammates Pete Rose and Tony Pérez. The lineup was soon dubbed the &quot;Wheeze Kids&quot;, referring to the considerable age in their starting lineup, where just one starting player was under 30 years old. On his 40th birthday in 1983, Morgan had four hits, including two home runs and a double, at Veterans Stadium.

The Phillies beat the Dodgers in the NLCS to reach the World Series for the second time in four seasons. Morgan got to play in the World Series for the final time, facing off against the Baltimore Orioles. In Game 1, he hit a home run in the sixth inning to tie the game; he became the second oldest player to hit a home run in the World Series (Enos Slaughter was a few months older at the age of 40). He went 5-for-19 in the Series, which included a second home run in Game 5, but the Phillies lost in five games. Morgan finished his career with the Oakland Athletics in 1984, playing 116 games and batting .244. He collected a hit in his final game on September 30, collecting a double in his one at-bat before being taken out of the game.

==Post-playing career==

===Hall of Fame===
In 1990, Morgan was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame with more than 81% of the vote. He entered together with Jim Palmer, both in their first year of eligibility. Morgan and Palmer were the 25th/26th players in MLB history to be elected in their first year of eligibility.

In 2017, Morgan wrote a letter to the Hall of Fame in which he asked that players who had cheated by using performance-enhancing steroids not be elected into the Hall.

===Legacy===
After his career ended, Morgan was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1987, and his jersey number 8 was retired. The Reds dedicated a statue for Morgan at Great American Ball Park in 2013.
In the &quot;New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, Bill James named Morgan the best second baseman in baseball history, ahead of #2 Eddie Collins and #3 Rogers Hornsby. He also named Morgan as the &quot;greatest percentages player in baseball history&quot;, due to his strong fielding percentage, stolen base percentage, walk-to-strikeout ratio, and walks per plate appearance. The statement was included with the caveat that many players in baseball history could not be included in the formula due to lack of data. In the four decades since Morgan&#x27;s retirement, only one player (Rickey Henderson) has had as many home runs and stolen bases as Morgan did for a career. Morgan had at least 20 home runs and 50 stolen bases in the same season three times during his career, including twice with at least 60 steals.

In 1999, Morgan ranked Number 60 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

Morgan served as a member of the board of the Baseball Assistance Team, a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro league players through financial and medical hardships. In addition, since 1994, he served on the board of directors for the Baseball Hall of Fame, and was vice-chairman from 2000 until his death in 2020.

==Broadcasting career==

===Local gigs and college baseball===
Morgan started his broadcasting career in 1985 for the Cincinnati Reds. On September 11, 1985, Morgan, along with his television broadcasting partner Ken Wilson, was on hand to call Pete Rose&#x27;s record-breaking 4,192nd career hit. A year later, Morgan started a nine-year stint as an announcer for the San Francisco Giants. Morgan added one more local gig when he joined the Oakland Athletics&#x27; broadcasting team for the 1995 season.

In 1986, ESPN hired Morgan to call &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; and College World Series games.

===ABC Sports===
From 1988 to 1989, Morgan served as an announcer for ABC, where he helped announce &quot;Monday Night&quot; and &quot;Thursday Night Baseball&quot; games (providing backup for the led announcing crew composed of Al Michaels, Tim McCarver, and Jim Palmer), the 1988 American League Championship Series with Gary Bender and Reggie Jackson, and served as a field reporter for the 1989 World Series along with Gary Thorne (Morgan&#x27;s regular season partner in 1989). Morgan was on the field at San Francisco&#x27;s Candlestick Park alongside Hall of Famer Willie Mays (whom Morgan was getting set to interview) the moment the Loma Prieta earthquake hit.

===NBC Sports===
From 1994 to 2000, Morgan teamed with Bob Costas and Bob Uecker (until 1997) to call baseball games on NBC (and in association with The Baseball Network from 1994 to 1995). During this period, Morgan helped call three World Series (1995, 1997, and 1999) and four All-Star Games (1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000). Morgan also called three American League Championship Series (1996, 1998, and 2000) and three National League Championship Series (1995 alongside Greg Gumbel, 1997, and 1999).

Morgan spent a previous stint (1986–1987) with NBC calling regional &quot;Game of the Week&quot; telecasts alongside Bob Carpenter. During NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1985 and 1987 National League Championship Series, Morgan served as a pregame analyst alongside hosts Dick Enberg (in 1985) and Marv Albert (in 1987).

===ESPN===

Morgan was a member of ESPN&#x27;s lead baseball broadcast team alongside Jon Miller and Orel Hershiser. Besides teaming with Miller for &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; (since its inception in 1990) telecasts, Morgan also teamed with Miller for League Championship Series and World Series broadcasts on ESPN Radio.

In 1999, Morgan teamed with his then-NBC colleague Bob Costas to call two weekday night telecasts for ESPN. The first was on Wednesday, August 25 with Detroit Tigers playing against the Seattle Mariners. The second was on Tuesday, September 21 with the Atlanta Braves playing against the New York Mets. He won two Sports Emmy Awards for Outstanding Sports Event Analyst in 1998 and 2005.

In 2006, he called the Little League World Series Championship with Brent Musburger and Orel Hershiser on ABC, replacing the recently fired Harold Reynolds. During the 2006 MLB playoffs, the network had Morgan pull double duty by calling the first half of the Mets–Dodgers playoff game at Shea Stadium before traveling across town to call the Yankees–Tigers night game at Yankee Stadium.

In 2009, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s Joe Posnanski spoke about the perceived disparity between Morgan&#x27;s celebrated playing style and his on-air persona:
:&quot;The disconnect between Morgan the player and Morgan the announcer is one that I&#x27;m just not sure anyone has figured. Bill James tells a great story about how one time Jon Miller showed Morgan Bill&#x27;s &quot;New Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, which has Morgan ranked as the best second baseman of all time, ahead of Rogers Hornsby. Well, Morgan starts griping that this was ridiculous, that Hornsby hit .358 in his career, and Morgan never hit .358, and so on. And there it was, perfectly aligned—Joe Morgan the announcer arguing against Joe Morgan the player.&quot;

In the wake of Morgan taking an official role with the Cincinnati Reds as a &quot;special adviser to baseball operations&quot;, it was announced on November 8, 2010, that Morgan would not be returning for the 2011 season as an announcer on &quot;ESPN Sunday Night Baseball&quot;. His former broadcast partner Jon Miller&#x27;s contract expired in 2010 and ESPN chose not to renew his contract. Morgan and Miller were replaced by Bobby Valentine and Dan Shulman, respectively (while ESPN retained Orel Hershiser, who joined the &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; telecasts in 2010).

===Other appearances===
Morgan was also a broadcaster in the &quot;MLB 2K&quot; video game series from 2K Sports.

It was announced on June 17, 2011, that Morgan would begin a daily, one-hour general-sports-talk radio program on Sports USA Radio Network, beginning on August 22 of that year.

===Return to the Reds===
In April 2010, Morgan returned to the Reds as an advisor to baseball operations, including community outreach for the Reds.

==Personal life==
Morgan married Gloria Stewart, his high school girlfriend, on April 3, 1967. They had two children, and divorced in the 1980s. He then married Theresa Behymer in 1990. They had twins in 1991.

In March 1988, while transiting through Los Angeles International Airport, Morgan was violently thrown to the floor, handcuffed, and arrested by Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detectives who profiled him as a drug courier. He filed and won a civil rights case against the LAPD in 1991, and was awarded $540,000. In 1993, a federal court upheld his claim that his civil rights had been violated.

In 2015, Morgan was diagnosed with Myelodysplastic syndrome, which developed into leukemia. He received a bone marrow transplant from one of his daughters. Morgan died on October 11, 2020, at the age of 77, at his home in Danville, California. He suffered from a non-specified polyneuropathy in the time leading up to his death. Behymer-Morgan survives him.

<text>Eleanor Jane Mondale Poling (January 19, 1960 – September 17, 2011) was an American radio personality, television host, actress,and political activist.

==Biography==

Mondale was the only daughter of Joan Mondale and former Vice President Walter Mondale. Her older brother is former Minnesota State Senator Theodore Adams &quot;Ted&quot; Mondale. Her younger brother is attorney William Hall Mondale, the former assistant Attorney General of Minnesota (1990–2000). For her senior year of high school, Mondale attended St. Timothy&#x27;s, a boarding school outside of Baltimore. After graduating from St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, she moved to begin a career in Hollywood.

==Personal life==

After she completed her college education, Mondale quickly earned a reputation in the media for being a &quot;wild child&quot;, although she claimed many of the rumors were unfounded. She was married three times and had no children. She was involved with some high-profile men, including, reportedly, former President Bill Clinton, during his time in office.

Mondale&#x27;s first marriage, to football player Keith Van Horne, lasted from April 9, 1988, until August 1989, when Van Horne filed for divorce. In 1990, she dated rock singer-songwriter Warren Zevon, traveling on tour with him to Australia. She also dated Washington Redskins offensive tackle George Starke.

Mondale&#x27;s second marriage, from June 21, 1991, to November 1991, was to Greg Malban, a DJ known as Greg Thunder.

In 1999, Mondale sold her house in Los Angeles to move to New York to be with her then-boyfriend, New York plastic and reconstructive surgeon Joe DeBellis.

In June 2005, Mondale married Minneapolis musician Chan Poling of the group The New Standards and The Suburbs. Mondale and Poling lived on a small farm in Minnesota, where they raised miniature horses until her death.

===Acting career===
Mondale took time off from college in 1981 to move to Hollywood. She worked briefly as an extra and had one speaking line in the TV series &quot;240-Robert&quot;. She then returned to St. Lawrence University, in Canton, New York, graduating in 1982. By January 1983, Mondale was back in Hollywood, where she had small roles on such TV shows as &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, &quot;Dynasty&quot;, and &quot;Matt Houston&quot;.

Eleanor Mondale was a regular guest on Howard Stern&#x27;s E! TV show during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

===Journalism career===
Mondale began her journalism career while still in Los Angeles, taking a job at KABC-TV in 1985. She left the station in late 1985 and soon moved to Chicago, getting her first radio break as a helicopter reporter at WMAQ (AM). She continued taking fill-in radio news jobs at various Chicago radio stations, including WCKG-FM. She also was waiting for the pilot of a King World Productions show, &quot;The Rock &#x27;n Roll Evening News&quot;, to be sold. Within a few months the show began airing in national syndication, with Mondale working as its Midwest correspondent.

In 1986, Mondale signed a one-year contract with powerhouse Chicago radio station WGN (AM) to appear as a frequent contributor to programs. In early 1987, Mondale joined Chicago radio station WCKG-FM as a morning news anchor. In June 1987, Mondale shifted to being the co-host of WCKG&#x27;s morning show alongside John Fisher. In early 1988, Mondale took a leave of absence from WCKG to collaborate with a Chicago writer on a book about the children of U.S. presidents.

In June 1989, Mondale took a job in Minneapolis as an entertainment reporter for WCCO-TV. In March 1990, Mondale quit unexpectedly just a few days before a local magazine was to publish a feature on Mondale titled &quot;Walter and Joan&#x27;s Wild Child&quot;.

After leaving WCCO and spending some time in Australia, Mondale became a morning sidekick on WLOL-FM in Minneapolis, where she remained until the station was bought by Minnesota Public Radio in 1991. She also hosted &quot;The Great American TV Poll&quot; on the Lifetime cable channel.

In April 1991, Mondale returned to Chicago&#x27;s airwaves as a morning sidekick at WKQX, working alongside morning host Robert Murphy. Mondale and fellow sidekick Dan Walker were forced out of WKQX in January 1993.

After leaving WKQX, Mondale began working in television. In March 1993, Mondale and Robin Leach co-hosted a two-hour special on national television about Madonna titled &quot;Madonna Exposed&quot;. In early 1994, Mondale began working as a correspondent for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show.

In mid-1994, Mondale landed a job as anchor/host of &quot;Q and E&quot;, a half-hour weekly celebrity show airing on E!, and was also a regular correspondent for the network&#x27;s news division. In 1996, Mondale was hired by CBS as a Los Angeles-based correspondent for&quot;This Morning&quot;.

Mondale also later hosted the E! shows &quot;Wild On&quot; in 1997 and &quot;E! News Live&quot;. She worked on ESPN as a reporter on the horse racing events, which lasted two years (2002–2003). She covered for ESPN2 the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. After ESPN, she co-hosted &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Auto Shows&quot; for the Speed Channel in 2004 and 2005. She worked for the CBS Television show &quot;This Morning&quot;.

In 2006, after battling brain cancer for the first time, Mondale signed on as a host at WCCO-AM. She remained there until 2009, when she left the airwaves to go on disability because of her cancer&#x27;s recurrence.

In 2013, she was posthumously inducted into the Minnesota Broadcasting Hall of Fame.

===Film career===
Mondale had five speaking lines in the opening minutes of the 1991 film &quot;Drop Dead Fred&quot;.
She appeared in the 1999 film &quot;Ground Control&quot; as Christine, and narrated the feature documentary film &quot;&quot; (2008), which details the life of her father and aspects of her own childhood.
She also appeared in the short film &quot;Mirage&quot; (2004), directed by Sayer Frey and produced by Shelli Ainsworth.

===Illness and death===
After a bout of seizures, Mondale was diagnosed with brain cancer in June 2005. In the summer of 2006, the cancer was in remission, but she announced in February 2008 that a small tumor had returned and that she would seek treatment at the Mayo Clinic. Mondale was again diagnosed with brain cancer in August 2009 and was scheduled to undergo surgery later that month. She died from the disease at her home in Minnesota on September 17, 2011, at the age of 51.

<text>The Philadelphia Main Line, known simply as the Main Line, is an informally delineated historical and social region of suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Lying along the former Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s once prestigious Main Line, it runs northwest from Center City Philadelphia parallel to Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, also known as U.S. Route 30.

The railroad first connected the Main Line towns in the 19th century. They became home to sprawling country estates belonging to Philadelphia&#x27;s wealthiest families, and over the decades became a bastion of &quot;old money&quot;. The Main Line includes some of the wealthiest communities in the country, including Gladwyne, Villanova, Radnor, Haverford, and Merion. Today, the railroad is Amtrak&#x27;s Keystone Corridor, along which SEPTA&#x27;s Paoli/Thorndale Line operates.

==History==

===17th and 18th centuries===

The Main Line region was long part of Lenapehoking, the homeland of the matrilineal Lenape Native Americans (the &quot;true people&quot;, or &quot;Delaware Indians&quot;). Europeans arrived in the 1600s, after William Penn sold a tract of land, called the Welsh Tract, to a group of Welsh Quakers in London in 1681. This accounts for the many Welsh place names in the area. However, what might be termed the &quot;Celtification&quot; of many Main Line place and street names occurred long after colonial times. So, for instance, as a marketing device to attract wealthy new residents, the area once awkwardly named Athensville became the more culturally glamorous Ardmore (Ardmore is a place name found in Ireland and Scotland) in 1873.

===19th century===

The Pennsylvania Railroad built its main line during the early 19th century as part of the Main Line of Public Works that spanned Pennsylvania. Later in the century, the railroad, which owned much of the land surrounding the tracks, encouraged the development of this picturesque environment by building way stations along the portion of its track closest to Philadelphia. The benefits of what was touted as &quot;healthy yet cultivated country living&quot; attracted Philadelphia&#x27;s social elite, many of whom had one house in the city and another larger &quot;country home&quot; on the Main Line.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, many wealthy Philadelphia families moved to the Main Line suburbs. Part of the national trend of suburbanization, this drove rapid investment, prosperity, and growth that turned the area into greater Philadelphia&#x27;s most affluent and fashionable region. Estates with sweeping lawns and towering maples, the débutante balls and the Merion Cricket Club, which drew crowds of 25,000 spectators to its matches in the early 1900s, were the setting for the 1940 Grant/Hepburn/Stewart motion picture &quot;The Philadelphia Story.&quot;

The railroad placed stops about two minutes apart, starting with Overbrook. The surrounding communities became known by the railroad station names which started at Broad Street Station in Center City Philadelphia and went on to 32nd Street Station, replaced by 30th Street Station in 1933, the 52nd Street Station (decommissioned), and then the Main Line stations: Overbrook, Merion, Narberth, Wynnewood, Ardmore, Haverford, Bryn Mawr, Rosemont, Villanova, Radnor, St. Davids, Wayne, Strafford, Devon, Berwyn, Daylesford, Paoli, and Malvern. At least five of these station buildings, along with the first Bryn Mawr Hotel, were designed by Wilson Brothers &amp; Company. 

A branch line of the Main Line (currently known as SEPTA&#x27;s Cynwyd Line) extended to the communities now known as Bala and Cynwyd (via Wynnefield Station in Philadelphia), then proceeded to the West Laurel Hill Cemetery, where there was once a station, and crossed back into Philadelphia over the Schuylkill River via the famous Manayunk Bridge. Broad Street Station was replaced with Suburban Station in 1930, and 30th Street Station replaced 32nd Street three years later. Suburban service now extends west of the Main Line to the communities of Exton, Whitford, Downingtown, and Thorndale.

The railroad line then continued on to Chicago, with major stations at Lancaster, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. The railroad, since taken over by Amtrak, is still in service, although its route is slightly different from the original. It also serves the Paoli/Thorndale Line of the SEPTA Regional Rail system.

===Gilded Age===

It was not only extremely wealthy people on the Main Line in the period 1880–1920. Wealthy households required large numbers of servants in order to maintain their lifestyle. Often these servants were Black migrants from the South and recent immigrants from Europe. For example, in the 1900 census, Tredyffrin Township was 13.5% Black; another 15% had been born in Europe. The two largest countries of origin were Italy and Ireland. The corresponding figures for Lower Merion Township were 6% Black and 15% born in Europe; almost 11% were from Ireland.

Another dimension of this story is illustrated by the community of Mount Pleasant, in Tredyffrin Township just north of Wayne. This is a community that became predominantly Black in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

As of the 1920 census, most of the Black residents in the Mount Pleasant region, or their parents, had come from the South. Many of the men in this neighborhood, along Henry Avenue and Mount Pleasant Avenue, were employed by the railroad, as quarry workers, or as chauffeurs and gardeners by private families. The occupations often given for women were cooks and laundresses. This remains a predominantly Black community to the present day.

===21st century===

Today, the Main Line is another name for the western suburbs of Philadelphia along Lancaster Avenue (U.S. Route 30) and the former main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad and extending from the city limits to, traditionally, Bryn Mawr and ultimately Paoli, an area of about . The upper- and upper middle-class enclave has historically been one of the bastions of &quot;old money&quot; in the Northeast, along with places like Long Island&#x27;s North Shore (AKA: &quot;Gold Coast&quot;); Westchester County, New York; Middlesex County, Massachusetts; and Fairfield County, Connecticut.

Neighborhoods along the Main Line include nineteenth and early twentieth-century railroad suburbs and post-war subdivisions, as well as a few surviving buildings from before the suburban development era. The area today is known primarily for several educational institutions as well as robust suburban life.

==Geography==
===Core towns===
The original Main Line towns are widely considered to follow the acronym &quot;Old Maids Never Wed And Have Babies.&quot; From Philadelphia, they are:
*Overbrook
*Merion
*Narberth
*Wynnewood
*Ardmore
*Haverford
*Bryn Mawr

These seven towns are characterized as one of the primary bastions of old money in Southeastern Pennsylvania. They are comparably more dense than other suburbs and have lively, walkable downtowns. All of these communities were established along Lancaster Avenue prior to the railroad&#x27;s construction.

As early as 1887, Bala and Cynwyd were also included in atlases of the Pennsylvania Railroad in Lower Merion Township and Montgomery County. By 1908, one of the first atlases to refer specifically to the &quot;Main Line&quot; as a socio-cultural entity includes:
*Bala
*Cynwyd

The following towns are often grouped with the core Main Line:
*Wayne
*Paoli
*Malvern

===Infill communities===
Beyond these nine communities, many others have grown in the 20th century, either in between the core towns or nearby them, including:
*Gladwyne, immediately to the northeast of Bryn Mawr
*Villanova and Radnor, between Bryn Mawr and Wayne
*Strafford, Devon, and Berwyn, between Wayne and Paoli

These communities are primarily residential and consist of larger lot sizes than in the nine core towns. All of them, except Gladwyne, are on the railroad and have their own station stop.

==Demographics==
There is no collective data for the Main Line, so all data is by ZIP Code. The median family income on the Main Line is $192,630. In comparison, the median family income for the state of Pennsylvania is $87,500. The following ZIP codes are those within the previously mentioned municipalities that make up the Main Line. All data are from the 2022 American Communities Survey. 

==Transportation==

The Main Line is served by numerous modes of transportation among which are three commuter rail lines operated by SEPTA. Connecting the region directly with Center City Philadelphia are the Paoli/Thorndale Line which shares the former Pennsylvania Railroad four track Keystone Corridor grade with Amtrak, and the Manayunk/Norristown Line which operates over the former Reading Railroad Norristown grade. The light rail Norristown High Speed Line runs over the Philadelphia and Western Railroad line between 69th Street Transportation Center in Upper Darby and Norristown Transportation Center in Norristown. Amtrak&#x27;s intercity &quot;Keystone Service&quot; (New York City to Harrisburg) and &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; (New York City to Pittsburgh) also serve the region with stops at the jointly operated Amtrak/SEPTA stations at Ardmore and Paoli.

The main thoroughfare through the Main Line is U.S. Route 30 which follows Lancaster Avenue (formerly the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike) running east to west and serves as the backbone of the region by connecting a large majority of its towns and municipalities. Other highways serving the area are the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76) which connects it to Philadelphia, and the Blue Route (I-476) which runs north to south connecting the region with the Northeast Extension and the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the north, and to Philadelphia International Airport and I-95 to the south. Along the northern edge of the Main Line, US 202 runs from the Schuylkill Expressway in a southwesterly direction, crossing US 30 in Frazer.

SEPTA also commissions suburban buses on Routes 105 and 106 to run from the 69th Street Transportation Center in Upper Darby to Rosemont (Route 105) and Paoli (Route 106). These buses run almost entirely along Lancaster Avenue.

SEPTA also offers light rail service through the Norristown High Speed Line. The Norristown High Speed Line runs along the Main Line from Upper Darby to Ithan Avenue Station and Villanova Station before making a northward turn at the junction of Lancaster Avenue and the Blue Route toward Norristown.

==Recreation and attractions==

* The Appleford Estate: A 300-year-old estate located in Villanova. Today it is maintained as an arboretum and a bird sanctuary.

The trail also connects to the pedestrian-only Manayunk Bridge on the Schuylkill River, which opened in 2015.
*Chanticleer Garden: An estate and botanical garden located in Wayne, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
*The Devon Horse Show: The oldest and largest multi-breed horse show in the U.S.
*Harriton House: Located in Bryn Mawr, was built in 1704 by a Welsh Quaker named Rowland Ellis. He named the estate &quot;Bryn Mawr&quot;, meaning &quot;high hill&quot; in Welsh, which is where the community gained its name. The house&#x27;s best known occupant was Charles Thomson, the first and only secretary of the Continental Congress in Philadelphia.
*Historic Waynesborough: Revolutionary war hero Anthony Wayne&#x27;s historic estate. Alternatively known as Waynesborough, this is where Anthony Wayne was born. It is registered as a National Historic Landmark and is a historic house museum.

*The Lower Merion Academy was built in 1812, and is a -story, five-bay, stuccoed stone building with cupola in the Federal style. It was renovated in 1938, in the Colonial Revival style. Located in Bala Cynwyd, it is still used for educational purposes and now also houses The Lower Merion Historical Society. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The free education provided to local children in the Academy predated Pennsylvania&#x27;s state laws mandating free public schooling (1834–1836).
*Completed in 1715, The Merion Friends Meeting House, in Merion Station, is the third oldest Quaker Meeting House in the United States. It is still in active use by the Society of Friends. The property also includes stables and a cemetery, with an estimated 2,000 burials (many of which are unmarked in accordance with early Quaker custom). Construction began in 1695, and the meeting house exhibits distinctively Welsh architectural features, including a cross- or T-shape building plan, that distinguish it from later Quaker meeting houses. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1999.
*The Woodmont Estate

==Sporting and social clubs==

<text>A term limit is a legal restriction on the number of terms a person may serve in a particular elected office. When term limits are found in presidential and semi-presidential systems they act as a method of curbing the potential for monopoly, where a leader effectively becomes &quot;president for life&quot;. This is intended to protect a republic Term limits may be a lifetime limit on the number of terms an officeholder may serve, or a limit on the number of consecutive terms.

==History==
===Europe===

Term limits date back to Ancient Greece and the Roman Republic, as well as the Republic of Venice. In ancient Athenian democracy, many officeholders were limited to a single term. Council members were allowed a maximum of two terms. The position of Strategos could be held for an indefinite number of terms. In the Roman Republic, a law was passed imposing a limit of a single term on the office of censor. The annual magistrates, including the tribune of the plebs, the aedile, the quaestor, the praetor, and the consul, were forbidden reelection until a number of years had passed. The office of dictator was nearly unrestricted with the exception that it was limited to a single six-month term. Successive Roman leaders weakened this restriction until Julius Caesar became a perpetual dictator and ended the republic.

Term limits returned in medieval Europe through the Novgorod Republic, the Pskov Republic, the Republic of Genoa, and the Republic of Florence.

The first modern constitutional term limit was established in the French First Republic by the Constitution of 1795, which established five-year terms to the French Directory and banned consecutive terms. Napoleon ended the practice of term limits in 1799 in much the same way as Julius Caesar had. The French Constitution of 1848 reestablished term limits, but this was abolished by Napoleon&#x27;s nephew, Napoleon III.

Many post-Soviet republics established presidential systems with five-year term limits after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The President of Russia is allowed a maximum of two consecutive terms, but the 2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia reset incumbent president Vladimir Putin&#x27;s term count, allowing him to stand for two additional terms. The President of Belarus was limited to two terms, but the limit was abolished in 2004.

=== United States ===

A predecessor of modern term limits in the Americas dates back to the 1682 Pennsylvania Charter of Liberties and the colonial frame of government of the same year, authored by William Penn and providing for triennial rotation of the Provincial Council, the upper house of the colonial legislature. Presidents of the United States typically honored an informal tradition of only serving two terms in office, but this limit was not enshrined into law until the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1951 after Franklin D. Roosevelt had been elected to an unprecedented third and fourth terms.

=== Latin America ===
As the countries of Latin America modeled presidential republics after the government of the United States in the 19th century, they established term limits for their presidents based on the two-term precedent of the United States. In response to presidents overstaying their term, some of these term limits were eventually replaced by a limit of one term without reelection.

In Mexico, Porfirio Díaz evaded term limits, running for eight terms before being forced into exile in 1911. A new constitution in 1917 established a one term limit. After Álvaro Obregón violated this law and ran for a second term, he was assassinated. Currently, members of the Congress of Mexico cannot be reelected consecutively under article 50 and 59 of the Constitution of Mexico, and the President of Mexico is limited to a single six-year term, called the sexenio.

The President of Argentina was limited to one consecutive six-year term, but the Constitution of Argentina was amended in 1994, loosening the term limit to a maximum of two consecutive four-year terms.

In 1997, the Constitution of Brazil was amended, loosening the term limit for the President of Brazil from one five-year term to two four-year terms.

In 2004, the term limit for the President of Colombia was increased from one term to two terms before reverting to one term in 2015.

The 2009 Venezuelan constitutional referendum abolished term limits in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 16/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
Following the 1911 Revolution, Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet Yuan Shikai became the second President of the Republic of China. He was initially subject to a maximum of two five-year terms, but the term was then lengthened to ten years and the term limit was removed.

In 1948, the Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion abolished the term limit for the President of the Republic of China and established Chiang Kai-shek as the country&#x27;s military leader. The term limit was restored after the provisions were repealed in 1991.

The President of South Korea was initially permitted to serve a maximum of two four-year terms when the office was created in 1948, but the term limit was removed in 1954 so that Syngman Rhee could run for a third term. After Rhee was elected to a fourth term, the First Republic of Korea was overthrown. The two term limit was restored, but it was expanded to three terms in 1969 and abolished again in 1972. A one seven-year term limit was established in 1981, which was reduced to five years in 1988.

Under the original Constitution of Indonesia, there were no presidential or vice-presidential term limits, but since the first amendment in 1999 holders of both offices are limited to two terms each.

The Philippines established term limits following independence from the United States, but they were abolished by Ferdinand Marcos in the 1970s. Term limits were restored in the 1987 constitution, after Marcos was deposed in the People Power Revolution. The President is limited to one six-year term.

Between 1982 and 2018, the Constitution of China stipulated that the president, vice president, premier and vice premiers could not serve more than two consecutive terms, though there was no term limit for the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, who usually represented the paramount leader of China. In March 2018, the National People&#x27;s Congress passed a set of constitutional amendments, including abolishing the term limits for the president and vice president, as well as enhancing the central role of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), allowing CCP leader Xi Jinping to continue as paramount leader indefinitely.

The President of Tajikistan was initially limited to one five-year term under the 1994 Constitution of Tajikistan. This was increased to one seven-year term in 1999 and to two seven-year terms in 2003. The term limit was reset for President Emomali Rahmon in 2006, and the term limit was abolished in 2016.

The Prime Minister of Pakistan was limited to one five-year term until the limit was abolished in 2011.

The Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia is subjected to a term limit. Once elected, he is only allowed to serve for a single five-year term and cannot renew for a second term consecutively. This rule makes Malaysia among two constitutional monarchies in the world that is subjected to a term limit, the other being Andorra (with the President of France serving as one of its co-princes).

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
Liberia briefly limited its presidents to an eight-year term between 1944 and 1951. As the countries of sub-Saharan Africa were decolonised in the mid-20th century, most of the new governments established presidential systems, but term limits were rarely established. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Rwanda, and Togo were the only countries to establish them, but they were abolished soon afterward. After the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in 1989-90 and ensuing wave of democratization in Eastern Europe, many African engaged in similar political democratizations and established term limits.

The President of Uganda was limited to two five-year terms in 1995. President Yoweri Museveni had previously served two terms, but these were not counted toward the new two term limit. The term limit was abolished in 2005, allowing Museveni to continue as president.

In Kenya, the 2010 constitution limits the president to a maximum of two five-year terms just like county governors. Before the promulgation of the 2010 constitution, term limits did not exist. The first president, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta ruled for 15 years and died in office. His vice president, Daniel Moi took over in 1978 and ruled for 24 years before Mwai Kibaki took over. Kibaki ruled for ten years, in a tenure that was characterized by major political reforms leading to the 2010 constitution. Immediate former President Uhuru Kenyatta was the first president under the new law, a position he served for two terms of 5 years each and was succeeded by his deputy William Ruto in September 2022. A member of President Ruto&#x27;s United Democratic Alliance party revealed plans to scrap the term limits on 7 November 2022 but the leadership dismissed him saying that was his personal opinion which he was entitled to.

The 1999 constitution of Nigeria limits the President at the Federal level, and Governors at the state level to serving two four-year terms. This has been strictly followed since 1999.

The 2010 constitution of Niger limited the President to two five-year terms. Mahamadou Issoufou was the only president to step down after being term limited.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, only South Africa (since 1994) Ghana (since 1993), Kenya (since 1964), and Nigeria (since 1999) have experienced a peaceful transition of power from one president to another after the expiry of term limits. Some countries have either scrapped the requirement or do not have it in their laws.

=== Middle East and North Africa ===
The 2019 Egyptian constitutional referendum included amendments to expand the presidential term from four to six years and allow President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to stand for a third term over the constitutional limit of two terms.

Term limits were one of the major demands of protesters during the Arab Spring.

==Mechanism==

Term limits are an element of constitutionalism that serves to limit the negative effects of democracy.

Term limits may take the form of consecutive term limits or lifetime term limits. With consecutive term limits, an officeholder can only serve a certain number of terms before they have to stop running for that office. After a set period of time, the clock resets on the limit, and the officeholder may run for election to their original office and serve up to the limit again. With lifetime limits, once an officeholder has served up to the limit, they may never again run for election to that office. Lifetime limits are much more restrictive than consecutive limits.

Countries that operate a parliamentary system of government are less likely to employ term limits on their leaders. This is because such leaders rarely have a set &quot;term&quot; at all: rather, they serve as long as they have the confidence of the parliament, a period which could potentially last for life. Many parliaments can be dissolved for snap elections which means some parliaments can last for mere months while others can continue until their expiration dates. Nevertheless, such countries may impose term limits on the holders of other offices—in republics, for example, a ceremonial presidency may have a term limit, especially if the office holds reserve powers.

Due in part to a lack of legal term limits in African countries, Mo Ibrahim created the Ibrahim Prize with an associated cash prize to incentivize African leaders to promote human rights and democratic transfer of power.

== Violation of term limits ==

Many presidents have tried to overstay their respective term limits by various methods. Between 1960 and 2010, more than one quarter of term-limited presidents successfully extended or violated their term limits to stay in power, and the enforcement of term limits is recognized as one of the great challenges in democratic development. Term limits typically receive greater domestic and international recognition than other mechanisms of democracy, and attempts to violate term limits are typically met with strong resistance by a country&#x27;s population and on the world stage. The violation of term limits is strongly correlated with democratic backsliding and the erosion of human rights.

Whether a president seeks to subvert term limits may be affected by how much wealth can be gained from the office, opportunities for acquiring wealth after leaving office, what constraints are in place to enforce term limits, how much control leader has over other branches of government or a political party, precedent in the region, and the likelihood of facing criminal prosecution upon leaving office. Presidents are more likely to be successful in violating term limits if they control the other branches of government, whether through their political parties or through insufficient checks and balances. Though violation of term limits is more common in less democratic countries, political opposition, foreign governments, and the citizenry can still enforce term limits in nondemocratic countries.

A president may attempt to circumvent term limits indirectly by extending their rule without an additional term. This may be done by extending the length of the term or postponing elections. In some cases, a president may circumvent term limits by officially stepping down from office but maintaining &quot;de facto&quot; control of the government.

<text>Robert Allan Caro (born October 30, 1935) is an American journalist and author known for his biographies of United States political figures Robert Moses and Lyndon Johnson.

After working for many years as a reporter, Caro wrote &quot;The Power Broker&quot; (1974), a biography of New York urban planner Robert Moses, which was chosen by the Modern Library as one of the hundred greatest nonfiction books of the twentieth century. He has since written four of a planned five volumes of &quot;The Years of Lyndon Johnson&quot; (1982, 1990, 2002, 2012), a biography of the former president. Caro has been described as &quot;the most influential biographer of the last century&quot;.

For his biographies, Caro has won two Pulitzer Prizes in Biography, two National Book Awards (including one for Lifetime Achievement), the Francis Parkman Prize, three National Book Critics Circle Awards, the Mencken Award for Best Book, the Carr P. Collins Award from the Texas Institute of Letters, the D. B. Hardeman Prize, and a Gold Medal in Biography from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2010 President Barack Obama awarded Caro the National Humanities Medal.

Due to Caro&#x27;s reputation for exhaustive research and detail, he is sometimes invoked by reviewers of other writers who are called &quot;Caro-esque&quot; for their own extensive research.

==Life and career==
Caro was born in New York City, the son of Jewish parents Celia (née Mendelow), born in New York, and Benjamin Caro, born in Warsaw, Poland. He grew up on Central Park West at 94th Street. His father, a businessman, spoke Yiddish as well as English, but he did not speak either very often. He was &quot;very silent,&quot; Caro said, and became more so after Caro&#x27;s mother died, after a long illness, when Robert was 12. It was his mother&#x27;s deathbed wish that he should go to the Horace Mann School, an exclusive private school in the Riverdale section of The Bronx. As a student there, Caro translated an edition of his school newspaper into Russian and mailed 10,000 copies to students in the USSR. Graduating in 1953, he went on to Princeton University, where he majored in English. He became managing editor of &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot;, second to Johnny Apple, later a prominent editor at &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

His writings, both in class and out, had been lengthy since his years at Horace Mann. A short story he wrote for &quot;The Princeton Tiger&quot;, the school&#x27;s humor magazine, took up almost an entire issue. His 235-page long senior thesis on existentialism in Hemingway, titled &quot;Heading Out: A Study of the Development of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s Thought&quot;, was so long, Caro claims, that the university&#x27;s English department subsequently established a maximum length for senior theses by its students. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1957.

According to a 2012 &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; profile, &quot;Caro said he now thinks that Princeton, which he chose because of its parties, was one of his mistakes, and that he should have gone to Harvard. Princeton in the mid-1950s was hardly known for being hospitable towards the Jewish community, and though Caro says he did not personally suffer from anti-Semitism, he saw plenty of students who did.&quot; He had a sports column in the &quot;Princetonian&quot; and also wrote for the &quot;Princeton Tiger&quot; humor magazine.

Caro began his professional career as a reporter with the &quot;New Brunswick Daily Home News&quot;, now merged into the &quot;Home News Tribune&quot;, in New Jersey. He took a brief leave to work as a publicist for the Middlesex County Democratic Party. He left politics after an incident where he was accompanying the party chair to polling places on election day. A police officer reported to the party chair that some African Americans Caro saw being loaded into a police van, under arrest, were poll watchers who &quot;had been giving them some trouble&quot;. Caro left politics right there. &quot;I still think about it,&quot; he recalled in the 2012 &quot;Times Magazine&quot; profile. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t the roughness of the police that made such an impression. It was themeekness isn&#x27;t the right wordthe acceptance of those people of what was happening.&quot;

After briefly enrolling in the English doctoral program at Rutgers University, where he served as a teaching assistant, he spent six years as an investigative reporter with the Long Island newspaper &quot;Newsday&quot;. An early article, &quot;Anatomy of a $9 Burglary,&quot; investigating the lives of those affected by a theft of $9 from a Long Island home, was held by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a strong example of Caro&#x27;s ceaseless research process to uncover the deep truth behind a story. One of the articles he wrote was a long series about why a proposed bridge across Long Island Sound from Rye to Oyster Bay, championed by Robert Moses, would have been inadvisable, requiring piers so large it would disrupt tidal flows in the sound, amongst other problems. Caro believed that his work had influenced even the state&#x27;s powerful governor Nelson Rockefeller to reconsider the idea, until he saw the state&#x27;s Assembly vote overwhelmingly to pass a preliminary measure for the bridge. 

&quot;That was one of the transformational moments of my life,&quot; Caro said years later. It led him to think about Moses for the first time. &quot;I got in the car and drove home to Long Island, and I kept thinking to myself: &#x27;Everything you&#x27;ve been doing is baloney. You&#x27;ve been writing under the belief that power in a democracy comes from the ballot box. But here&#x27;s a guy who has never been elected to anything, who has enough power to turn the entire state around, and you don&#x27;t have the slightest idea how he got it.&#x27;&quot;

Caro gave a speech to introduce Senator Ted Kennedy on the second day of the 2004 Democratic National Convention, emphasizing the importance of courage in American leaders.

==Work==

===&quot;The Power Broker&quot;===
Caro spent the academic year of 1965–1966 as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University. During a class on urban planning and land use, the experience of watching Moses returned to him.

To do so, Caro began work on a biography of Moses, &quot;The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York&quot;, also a study of Caro&#x27;s favorite theme: the acquisition and use of power. He expected it would take nine months to complete, but instead it took him until 1974. The work was based on extensive research and a total of 522 interviews, including several with Michael Madigan (who worked for Moses for 35 years); numerous interviews with Sidney Shapiro (Moses&#x27;s general manager for forty years) and seven interviews with Moses himself. Caro also interviewed men who worked for and knew Moses&#x27;s mentor, New York Governor Al Smith. During the 1967–1968 academic year, Caro worked on the book as a Carnegie Fellow at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.

His wife, Ina, functioned as his research assistant. Her master&#x27;s thesis on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge stemmed from this work. At one point she sold the family home and took a teaching job so Robert would be financially able to finish the book.

&quot;The Power Broker&quot; is widely viewed as a seminal work because it combined painstaking historical research with a smoothly flowing narrative writing style. The success of this approach was evident in his chapter on the construction of the Cross-Bronx Expressway, where Caro reported the controversy from all perspectives, including that of neighborhood residents. The result was a work of powerful literary as well as academic interest. Upon its publication, Moses responded to the biography in a 23-page statement repudiating the book.

===&quot;The Years of Lyndon Johnson&quot;===

Following &quot;The Power Broker&quot;, Caro turned his attention to President Lyndon B. Johnson. Caro&#x27;s editor Robert Gottlieb initially suggested the Johnson project to Caro in preference to the planned follow-up to the Moses volume, a biography of Fiorello LaGuardia. The ex-president had recently died and Caro had already decided, before meeting with Gottlieb on the subject, to undertake his biography; he &quot;wanted to write about power&quot;. 

Caro retraced Johnson&#x27;s life by temporarily moving to rural Texas and Washington, D.C., in order to better understand Johnson&#x27;s upbringing and to interview anyone who had known Johnson. The work, entitled &quot;The Years of Lyndon Johnson&quot;, was originally intended as a trilogy, but is projected to encompass five volumes:

# &quot;The Path to Power&quot; (1982) covers Johnson&#x27;s life up to his failed 1941 campaign for the United States Senate.
# &quot;Means of Ascent&quot; (1990) commences in the aftermath of that defeat and continues through his election to that office in 1948.
# &quot;Master of the Senate&quot; (2002) chronicles Johnson&#x27;s rapid ascent and rule as Senate Majority Leader.
# &quot;The Passage of Power&quot; (2012) details the 1960 election, LBJ&#x27;s life as vice president, the JFK assassination and his first days as president.
# One as-of-yet unpublished final volume.
In November 2011, Caro announced that the full project had expanded to five volumes with the fifth requiring another two to three years to write. It will cover Johnson and Vietnam, the Great Society and civil rights era, his decision not to run in 1968, and eventual retirement.
In a 2017 interview, Caro expressed his intent to embark shortly on a research trip to Vietnam. In an interview with &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; in January 2018, Caro indicated he did not know when the book would be finished, mentioning anywhere from two to ten years.

As of January 2020, Caro had completed 600 typed manuscript pages and was working on a section relating to the passage of Medicare in 1965.

Caro&#x27;s books portray Johnson as a complex and contradictory character: at the same time a scheming opportunist and visionary progressive. Caro argues, for example, that Johnson&#x27;s victory in the 1948 runoff for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate was only achieved through extensive fraud and ballot box stuffing, although this is set in the practices of the time and in the context of Johnson&#x27;s previous defeat in his 1941 race for the Senate, the victim of exactly similar chicanery. Caro highlighted some of Johnson&#x27;s campaign contributions, such as those from the Texas construction firm Brown and Root. In 1962 the company was acquired by another Texas firm, Halliburton, which became a major contractor in the Vietnam War. 

Caro argued that Johnson was awarded the Silver Star in World War II for political as well as military reasons, and that he later lied to journalists and the public about the circumstances for which it was awarded. Caro&#x27;s portrayal of Johnson also notes his struggles on behalf of progressive causes such as the Voting Rights Act, and his consummate skill in getting this enacted in spite of intense opposition from Southern Democrats.

Among sources close to the late president, Johnson&#x27;s widow Lady Bird Johnson &quot;spoke to [Caro] several times and then abruptly stopped without giving a reason, and Bill Moyers, Johnson&#x27;s press secretary, has never consented to be interviewed, but most of Johnson&#x27;s closest friends, including John Connally and George Christian, Johnson&#x27;s last press secretary, who spoke to Caro practically on his deathbed, have gone on the record&quot;.

While writing the books, Caro read the works of the novelist Leo Tolstoy and the historian Edward Gibbon, alternating between the two. &quot;There&#x27;s almost a view that if it&#x27;s well written it can&#x27;t be good history,&quot; he told Mark Rozzo of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2002. &quot;In my view, it&#x27;s not good history unless it is well written. History is a narrative. History is a story. If you&#x27;re not telling a story, you&#x27;re not being faithful to history.&quot;

===Caro&#x27;s editors and publishers===
Caro&#x27;s books have been published by Alfred A. Knopf, first under editor-in-chief Robert Gottlieb and then by Sonny Mehta after Gottlieb&#x27;s temporary departure to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1987. Gottlieb remained Caro&#x27;s primary editor throughout. &quot;We have these unbelievable angry exchanges, but it&#x27;s always worth it to me,&quot; Caro said of his relationship with Gottlieb. &quot;Sometimes we can spend two hours discussing whether to combine two paragraphs.&quot; Following the deaths of Mehta and Gottlieb, primary editing responsibility fell to his long-time second editor Kathy Hourigan.

A 2022 documentary, &quot;Turn Every Page: The Adventures of Robert Caro and Robert Gottlieb&quot;, examined Caro and Gottlieb&#x27;s working relationship.

=== Future projects ===
Caro has expressed hope of writing a &quot;full-scale memoir&quot; after completing &quot;The Years of Lyndon Johnson&quot;. His 2019 book &quot;Working&quot; has been described as a &quot;semi-memoir&quot; focused on &quot;Caro&#x27;s selection of observations...on the arts of researching, interviewing and writing&quot;.

When asked about other works he would have pursued, Caro replied a biography on Al Smith, commenting &quot;the more you learn about Al Smith, the more you realize he is probably the most forgotten consequential figure in American history.&quot;

=== Writing process ===
After conducting his years-long research, Caro attempts to &quot;see the whole book right down to the last line,&quot; by putting up an outline on a 22-foot corkboard before writing the first manuscript, as a way to prevent writer&#x27;s block. He writes several successive drafts in longhand on discontinued &quot;legal pads, white with narrow lines,&quot; which Caro has mass-ordered and keeps in East Hampton. Subsequently, Caro types his books on Smith Corona Electra 210 typewriters, which &quot;The New Republic&quot; called &quot;a model practically synonymous with him&quot;. 

Upon the publication of &quot;The Passage of Power&quot; in 2012, Caro owned 14 Smith Coronas, which came down to 11 in 2019. One of these, the one used when writing &quot;The Power Broker&quot;, was placed on display in the New-York Historical Society&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Turn Every Page&quot;: Inside the Robert A. Caro Archive&quot; exhibition. Since production of these was discontinued, Caro uses his reserve to supply parts when these become defective. The typewriters are supplied to him from individuals who, upon knowing his use of the Smith Coronas, send theirs to him. Other individuals have attempted to sell Caro theirs. However, he only answers letters offering them as gifts.

Since Caro retypes several versions of his manuscripts before submitting them for publication, he prefers a bolder text, which he achieves by using cotton ribbon, instead of the now-common nylon. As the former were discontinued, his wife Ina found a supplier that would manufacture them on the condition that Caro order a dozen gross, or 1,728 units. He edits with the use of red 314 Berol Draughting pencils and keeps &quot;a ledger tracking how many words he has written against his stringent 1,000-word daily goal&quot;. Though he now works in an office, at one point he wrote &quot;in the woods ... in a shack, a 12×15 ... put on cinderblocks&quot;.

==Awards and honors==

For his biographies of Robert Moses and Lyndon B. Johnson, Caro has won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography twice, the National Book Critics Circle Award for the Best Nonfiction Book of the Year three times, and has won various other major literary honors, including two National Book Awards (one for Lifetime Achievement), the Gold Medal in Biography from the American Academy of Art and Letters, and the Francis Parkman Prize.

In October 2007, Caro was named a &quot;Holtzbrinck Distinguished Visitor&quot; at the American Academy in Berlin, Germany but then was unable to attend.

In 2010, he received the National Humanities Medal from President Obama, the highest award in the humanities given in the United States. Delivering remarks at the end of the ceremony, the President said, &quot;I think about Robert Caro and reading &quot;The Power Broker&quot; back when I was 22 years old and just being mesmerized, and I&#x27;m sure it helped to shape how I think about politics.&quot; In 2011, Robert Caro was the recipient of the 2011 BIO Award given each year by members of Biographers International &quot;to a colleague who had made a major contribution in the advancement of the art and craft of real life depiction&quot;.

==Family==

After graduation from Princeton, Caro married Ina Joan Sloshberg, who was then still a student at Connecticut College. The Caros have a son, Chase Arthur, and three grandchildren, who live in White Plains.

Caro has described his wife as &quot;the whole team&quot; on all five of his books. She sold their house and took a job teaching school to fund work on &quot;The Power Broker&quot; and is the only other person who conducted research for his books.

Ina is the author of &quot;The Road from the Past: Traveling Through History in France&quot; (1996), a book which Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. called, at the presentation of her honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from The City University of New York in 2011, &quot;the essential traveling companion ... for all who love France and its history&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; reviewer Peter Prescott commented, &quot;I&#x27;d rather go to France with Ina Caro than with Henry Adams or Henry James. The unique premise of her intelligent and discerning book is so startling that it&#x27;s a wonder no one has thought of it before.&quot; Ina frequently writes about her travels through France in her blog, &quot;Paris to the Past&quot;. In June 2011, W. W. Norton published her second book, &quot;Paris to the Past: Traveling Through French History by Train&quot;.

Robert Caro had a younger sibling, Michael, a retired real estate manager, who died in 2018.

Caro&#x27;s son, Chase, pled guilty to second-degree grand larceny in 2007 for stealing over $750,000 from three former clients in the course of real estate transactions. In April 2008, he was sentenced to – years in prison after admitting to stealing $310,000 meant for his grandparents&#x27; trust fund. Chase agreed to pay restitution of $1.1 million, which includes funds from a third theft. All his sentences ran concurrently. , Chase works in information technology.

== Legacy ==
Due to Caro&#x27;s work ethic and voluminous work several authors have been compared to him and labelled as &quot;Caro-esque&quot;, &quot;Caro-like&quot; or &quot;in the Caro mold&quot; for their own extensive research. These include Renata Adler, Taylor Branch, David Garrow, Garrett Graff, Gerard Henderson, Jason Horowitz, Francis Jennings, Robert G. Kaiser, David Paul Kuhn, Roland Lazenby, David Maraniss, David McCullough, Charles Moore, Edmund Morris, Roger Morris, David Nasaw, Richard Neustadt, Les and Tamara Payne, Steven Pressfield, Michael Shnayerson, Lytton Strachey, Julia E. Sweig, William T. Vollmann, Mark Lewisohn, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee&#x27;s Research Department.

In 2011, his alma mater, Horace Mann School, began awarding the Robert Caro &#x27;53 Prize for Literary Excellence in the Writing of History, at a ceremony held annually at the head of school&#x27;s home. In 2017, the school named a classroom at Tillinghast Hall, the &quot;Robert A. Caro &#x27;53 History Classroom&quot;, to which Caro reacted by stating that it would be &quot;hard for [him] to think of anything that would make [him] happier&quot;.

&quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, the 2019 film directed by Edward Norton, loosely based on the 1999 novel of the same name by Jonathan Lethem, was inspired by Caro&#x27;s biography of Robert Moses, &quot;The Power Broker&quot;. León Krauze wrote in &quot;Slate&quot; comparing Norton&#x27;s character in that film to Caro himself.

In January 2020, the New-York Historical Society acquired Caro&#x27;s complete archive, consisting of &quot;200 linear feet of material&quot;, part of which will be digitized and made wholly available to researchers in a Robert A. Caro Study Space. A permanent exhibition, named &quot;Robert Caro Working&quot;, after his 2019 book &quot;Working&quot;, will be set up at the Society&#x27;s library. Caro stated that he was &quot;just plain delighted&quot; since his &quot;favorite aunt often took&quot; him there, as well as having spoken there and &quot;been a recipient of its awards&quot;. 

An exhibition called &quot;&quot;Turn Every Page&quot;: Inside the Robert A. Caro Archive&quot; opened on October 22, 2021, becoming &quot;the first permanent public exhibition of an archive devoted to a living author in the country&quot;. The title comes from advice that then-editor of &quot;Newsday&quot;, Alan Hathway, gave to Caro as a young reporter on Caro&#x27;s first investigative assignment. According to Caro, Hathway &quot;looked at me for what I remember as a very long time … &#x27;Just remember,&#x27; he said. &#x27;Turn every page. Never assume anything. Turn every goddamn page.&#x27;&quot; The advice is the title of the 2022 documentary on Caro and editor Robert Gottlieb&#x27;s collaborations, directed by the latter&#x27;s daughter, Lizzie Gottlieb.

<text>Unique Art Manufacturing Company was an American toy company, founded in 1916, based in Newark, New Jersey that made inexpensive toys, including wind-up mechanical toys, out of lithographed tin. One of its early products was a wind-up toy featuring two tin boxers.

The company scored a hit in the 1940s when it acquired the rights to a popular comic strip and released the Li&#x27;l Abner Dogpatch Band for Christmas 1945. The windup toy featured Abner dancing, Pappy on drums, Mammy with a drum stick, and Daisy Mae playing piano. Unique followed with a Howdy Doody band several years later.

Unique&#x27;s president, Samuel Berger, was a good friend of toy magnate Louis Marx, and the two men&#x27;s companies at times cooperated, with Marx providing tooling to Unique and sometimes acting as a distributor for Unique&#x27;s products.

In 1949, Unique began producing lithographed tin O gauge toy trains, using tooling of its own design along with some recycled tooling from the defunct Dorfan Company. Unique sold its trains inexpensively, in boxed sets like Marx and also produced a circus set that was distributed on a car-by-car basis by the Jewel Tea Company. Marx saw this as a betrayal and responded with a new line similar in size to Unique&#x27;s, but with lithographed rolling stock that looked more realistic. Unique found itself unable to compete, and withdrew its trains from the marketplace by 1951.

Although Unique only captured a small portion of the toy train craze of the early 1950s, a tin typewriter toy introduced during the same time frame did take market share away from Marx, who produced a similar toy. Marx responded by moving production of its typewriter toy to Japan in order to undercut Unique&#x27;s price.

The circumstances surrounding Unique Art&#x27;s eventual demise is unclear, but the company appears to have disappeared in 1952, when it was picked up in a corporate merger by the Jerry O&#x27;Mahony Diner Company, with some evidence of Marx picking up parts of the line.

<doc id="505831" wikidata="Q2095678" url="?curid=505831" title="Battle of Assaye">
<text>The Battle of Assaye was a major battle of the Second Anglo-Maratha War fought between the Maratha Confederacy and the British East India Company. It occurred on 23 September 1803 near Assaye in western India. An outnumbered Indian and British force, under the command of Major General Arthur Wellesley (who later became the Duke of Wellington), defeated the combined Maratha army of Daulatrao Scindia and the Bhonsle Raja of Berar. The battle was Wellesley&#x27;s first major victory and the one he later described as his finest accomplishment on the battlefield, even more so than his more famous victories in the Peninsular War, and his defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo.

From August 1803, Wellesley&#x27;s army and a separate force under the command of his subordinate, Colonel James Stevenson, pursued the Maratha cavalry-based army, which had threatened to raid south into Hyderabad. After several weeks of pursuit and countermarching, Scindia reinforced the combined Maratha army with his modernized infantry and artillery as the British forces closed in on his position. Wellesley received intelligence indicating the location of the Maratha encampment on 21 September and devised a plan whereby his two armies would converge on the Maratha position three days later. Wellesley&#x27;s force, however, encountered the Maratha Army, under the command of Colonel Anthony Pohlmann, a German formerly in British service, farther south than he anticipated. Although outnumbered, Wellesley resolved to attack at once, believing that the Maratha army would soon move off. Both sides suffered heavily in the ensuing battle; Maratha artillery inflicted large numbers of casualties among Wellesley&#x27;s troops, but the vast numbers of Maratha cavalry proved largely ineffective. A combination of bayonet and cavalry charges eventually forced the Maratha army to retreat, with the loss of most of their guns, but Wellesley&#x27;s army was too battered and exhausted to pursue.

Wellesley&#x27;s victory at Assaye, preceded by the capture of Ahmednagar and followed by victories at Argaon and Gawilghur, resulted in the defeat of Scindia and Berar&#x27;s armies in the Deccan. Wellesley&#x27;s progress in the Deccan was matched by Lieutenant General Gerard Lake&#x27;s successful campaigns in northern India and led to the British becoming the dominant power in the heartland of India.

==Background==
Feuding between the two dominant powers within the Maratha Empire, Yashwant Rao Holkar and Daulat Rao Scindia, led to civil war at the turn of the 19th century. The hostilities culminated in the Battle of Poona in October 1802 where Holkar defeated a combined army of Scindia and Baji Rao II – the Peshwa and nominal overlord of the Maratha Empire. Scindia retreated into his dominions to the north, but Baji Rao was driven from his territory and sought refuge with the East India Company at Bassein. He appealed to the company for assistance, offering to accept its authority if he were restored to his principality at Poona. Lord Mornington, the ambitious Governor-General of British India, seized on the opportunity to extend Company influence into the Maratha Empire which he perceived as the final obstacle to Britain being the dominant force in the Indian subcontinent. The Treaty of Bassein was signed in December whereby the Company agreed to restore Baji Rao in return for control over his foreign affairs and a garrison of 6,000 Company troops permanently stationed in Poona. The restoration was commanded by Lord Mornington&#x27;s younger brother, Major General Arthur Wellesley, who in March 1803 marched on Poona from Mysore with 15,000 Company troops and 9,000 Hyderabad allies. Wellesley entered Poona without opposition on 20 April, and Baji Rao was formally restored to his throne on 13 May.

The treaty gave offence to the other Maratha leaders, who deemed that the system of subsidiary alliances with the British was an unwarranted interference into their affairs and fatal to the independent Maratha states. The Maratha leaders refused to submit to the Peshwa&#x27;s authority and tensions were raised further when Holkar raided into Hyderabad in May, claiming that the Nizam of Hyderabad (a British ally) owed him money. Mornington consequently engaged the various Maratha chieftains in negotiations. Lieutenant Colonel John Collins was sent to Scindia&#x27;s camp to discuss his objections and propose a defensive alliance. However, Scindia had formed a military alliance with the Rajah of Berar with a view to bringing the Maratha leaders into a coalition against the British, and had begun to mass his forces on the Nizam&#x27;s border. Wellesley, who had been given control over the company&#x27;s military and political affairs in central India in June, demanded Scindia declare his intentions and withdraw his forces or face the prospect of war. After a protracted period of negotiations, Collins reported to Wellesley on 3 August that Scindia refused to give an answer and would not withdraw his troops. Wellesley&#x27;s response was to declare war on Scindia and Berar &quot;in order to secure the interests of the British government and its allies&quot;.

==Prelude==
The East India Company attacked the two principal Maratha forces of Scindia and the Raja of Berar from the north and the south. Of the other Maratha leaders, Holkar was hesitant to enter the war in cooperation with his rival, Scindia, and remained aloof from the hostilities, and the Gaekwad of Baroda placed himself under British protection. Operations in the north were directed by Lieutenant General Gerard Lake who entered Maratha territory from Cawnpore to face Scindia&#x27;s main army which was commanded by the French mercenary Pierre Perron. A second British force, under the command of Major General Wellesley, confronted a combined army of Scindia and Berar in the Deccan. Wellesley was determined to gain the initiative through offensive action and told his senior subordinate, Colonel James Stevenson, that &quot;a long defensive war would ruin us and will answer no purpose whatever&quot;.

The Maratha army in the Deccan was largely composed of fast-moving cavalry able to live off the land. Consequently, Wellesley planned to work in conjunction with a separate force under Colonel Stevenson to enable his slower troops to outmanoeuvre the Maratha army and force it into a position where it could not avoid a pitched battle. Stevenson was despatched from Hyderabad with an army of some 10,000 men to Jafarabad to deny Scindia and Berar the chance to raid east into the Nizam&#x27;s territory. In the meantime, Wellesley moved north from his camp near the Godavari River on 8 August with some 13,500 troops and headed towards Scindia&#x27;s nearest stronghold – the walled town and fort at Ahmednagar. The bulk of his forces were Company troops from Mysore: five sepoy infantry battalions of the Madras Native Infantry and three squadrons of Madras Native Cavalry. The core contingent of British Army regulars included cavalry from the 19th Light Dragoons and two battalions of Scottish infantry from the 74th and 78th Regiment of Foot. Irregular light cavalry were also provided by the company&#x27;s Mysore and Maratha allies.

Wellesley reached Ahmednagar later the same day after a march and immediately ordered an escalade assault on the town rather than enter into a time-consuming siege. The walled town, which was garrisoned by 1,000 Arab mercenaries, upwards of 60 cannon and one of Scindia&#x27;s infantry battalions under the command of French officers, was captured with minimal losses after a brief action. The adjacent fort&#x27;s defenders capitulated four days later once the walls were breached by British artillery. With the fortification providing a base for future operations into Maratha territory, Wellesley installed a garrison and headed north towards the Nizam&#x27;s city of Aurangabad. Along the way he captured Scindia&#x27;s other possessions south of the Godavari and established a series of guarded bridges and ferries along the river to maintain his communication and supply lines.

===Maratha reinforcements===

The Marathas slipped past Stevenson and advanced on Hyderabad. After receiving reports of their movement on 30 August, Wellesley hurried east down to the Godavari to intercept. Stevenson, meanwhile, marched westwards to the Maratha city of Jalna, which he took by storm. Scindia learned of Wellesley&#x27;s intentions and returned to a position north of Jalna. Unable to make a clean break from the pursuing British, he abandoned plans to raid into Hyderabad and instead assembled his infantry and artillery. The combined Maratha army was around 50,000 strong, the core of which was 10,800 well-equipped regular infantry organised into three brigades, trained and commanded by European adventurer and mercenary officers. Colonel Anthony Pohlmann, a Hanoverian and former East India Company sergeant, commanded the largest brigade with eight battalions. A further brigade with five battalions was provided by Begum Samru, and was commanded on her behalf by a Frenchman, Colonel Jean Saleur. The third brigade had four battalions and was commanded by Dutchman Major John James Dupont. In addition, the Maratha force included 10,000–20,000 of Berar&#x27;s irregular infantry, some 30,000–40,000 irregular light cavalry and over 100 guns ranging in size from one to 18-pounders.

After several weeks of chasing down the Maratha army, Wellesley and Stevenson met at Budnapoor on 21 September and received intelligence that the Maratha army was at Borkardan, around to the north. They agreed on a plan by which their two armies – moving separately along either side of a range of hills with Wellesley to the east and Stevenson to the west – would converge on Borkardan on 24 September. Wellesley&#x27;s force reached Paugy on the afternoon of 22 September and departed camp before dawn. By noon, the army had marched to Naulniah, a small town south of Borkardan, where they intended to rest before joining Stevenson to attack the Maratha army the next day. At this point, Wellesley received further intelligence that, rather than being at Borkardan, the Maratha army was camped just north, but their cavalry had moved off and the infantry were about to follow.

At about 13:00, Wellesley went forward with a cavalry escort to reconnoitre the Maratha position. The rest of his army followed closely behind, apart from a battalion of sepoys left at Naulniah to guard the baggage. In all, Wellesley had 4,500 troops at his disposal, plus 5,000 Mysore and Maratha horse and 17 cannon. Aware that the British were nearby, the Maratha chiefs had positioned their army in a strong defensive position along a tongue of land stretching east from Borkardan between the Kailna River and its tributary the Juah. However, Scindia and Berar did not believe Wellesley would attack with his small force and had moved away from the area in the morning. Command of their army was given to Pohlmann, who had positioned his infantry to the east of the Maratha camp in the plains around the village of Assaye on the southern bank of the Juah.

To his surprise, Wellesley found the entire combined army before him. Nevertheless, he resolved to attack at once, believing that if he waited for Stevenson, the Marathas would have the chance to slip away and force the pursuit to drag on. Wellesley was also eager to forge a reputation for himself, and despite his numerical disadvantage, he was confident that the Maratha&#x27;s irregular forces would be swept aside by his disciplined troops, and only Scindia&#x27;s regular infantry could be expected to stand and fight.

==Battle==

===Initial manoeuvres===
Pohlmann struck camp and deployed his infantry battalions in a line facing southwards behind the steep banks of the Kailna with his cannon arrayed directly in front. The great mass of Maratha cavalry was kept on the right flank and Berar&#x27;s irregular infantry garrisoned Assaye to the rear. The only observable crossing point over the river was a small ford directly ahead of the Maratha position. Pohlmann&#x27;s strategy was to funnel the British and Madras troops across the ford into the mouth of his cannon, and then on to the massed infantry and cavalry behind. Wellesley&#x27;s local guides assured him that no other ford existed nearby, but he quickly discarded the option of a frontal assault as suicide. While reconnoitring he had noticed two unguarded villages, Peepulgaon and Waroor, one on each bank of the Kaitna beyond the Maratha left. On the assumption that a ford must exist between the two villages, Wellesley ordered the area to be further reconnoitred by his Chief Engineer, Captain John Johnson, who reported that there was indeed a ford at that spot. Thus Wellesley led his army east to the crossing in an attempt to launch an attack on Pohlmann&#x27;s left flank.

At around 15:00, the British crossed to the northern bank of the Kaitna unopposed apart from a distant harassing fire from the Maratha cannon which was largely inaccurate but succeeded in decapitating Wellesley&#x27;s dragoon orderly. Once across, Wellesley ordered his six infantry battalions to form into two lines, with his cavalry as a reserve in a third. His allied Maratha and Mysore cavalry were ordered to remain south of the Kaitna to keep in check a large body of Maratha cavalry which hovered around the British rear. Pohlmann soon recognised Wellesley&#x27;s intentions and swung his infantry and guns through 90 degrees to establish a new line spread approximately across the isthmus with their right flank on the Kaitna and the left on Assaye. Although the new position secured the Maratha flanks, it restricted Pohlmann from bringing his superior numbers into action.

The Maratha redeployment was swifter and more efficient than Wellesley had anticipated and he immediately reacted by extending his front to deny Pohlmann the opportunity to outflank him. A battalion of pickets and the 74th Highlanders, which formed the right of the first and second lines, were ordered to move obliquely to the right. This allowed the 78th to anchor the left flank and Madras infantry battalions (the 1/10th, 1/8th, 1/4th and 2/12th) to form the centre of the British line. Wellesley&#x27;s intention was to force back the Marathas from their guns and then – operating by his left to avoid the heavily defended Assaye – throw them back on the Juah and complete their destruction with his cavalry.

===British infantry attack===

The Maratha cannonade intensified as the British redeployed. Although British artillery was brought forward to counter, it was ineffective against the mass firepower of the Maratha guns and quickly disabled through the weight of shot directed against it. British casualties mounted as the Maratha guns turned their attention to the infantry and subjected them to a barrage of canister, grape and round shot. Wellesley decided that his only option to neutralise the artillery and get his men out of the killing field was to advance directly into the mouth of the Maratha artillery. He ordered his cannon to be abandoned and gave the command for his infantry to march forward with bayonets fixed.

The Maratha cannonade punched holes in the British line, but the infantry maintained a steady pace, closing up the gaps in their ranks as they advanced. The 78th Highlanders were the first to reach the enemy in the southern sector next to the River Kailna. They paused from the Maratha gunners and unleashed a volley of musket fire before launching into a bayonet charge. The four battalions of Madras infantry to the right of the 78th, accompanied by the Madras Pioneers, reached Pohlmann&#x27;s line shortly afterwards and attacked in the same fashion. The gunners stood by their cannon but were no match for the bayonets of the British and Madras troops who swiftly pressed on towards the Maratha infantry. However, instead of meeting the charge, the Maratha right broke and fled northwards towards the Juah, causing the rest of the southern half of the line to follow. The officers of the Madras battalions temporarily lost control as the sepoys, encouraged by their success, pushed too far in pursuit. Maratha cavalry momentarily threatened to charge, but were checked by the 78th, who remained in order and re-formed to face the danger.

In the northern sector of the battlefield however, Wellesley&#x27;s right flank was in turmoil. The commander of the pickets, Lieutenant Colonel William Orrock, had mistaken his orders and continued his oblique path directly towards Assaye. Major Samuel Swinton of the 74th Regiment was ordered to support the pickets and followed close behind. This created a large gap in the centre of the British line and brought the two battalions under a barrage of cannonade from the artillery around the village and the Maratha left. The two battalions began to fall back in disarray, and Pohlmann ordered his remaining infantry and cavalry forward to attack. The Marathas gave no quarter; the pickets were virtually annihilated, but the remnants of the 74th were able to form a rough square behind hastily piled bodies of dead. Realising that the destruction of his right would leave his army exposed and outflanked, Wellesley ordered a detachment of British cavalry under Colonel Patrick Maxwell, consisting of the 19th Light Dragoons and elements of the 4th and 5th Madras Native Cavalry, into action. From their position at the rear, the cavalry dashed directly towards the 74th&#x27;s square, crashed into the swarming attackers and routed them. Maxwell pressed his advantage and continued his charge into the Maratha infantry and guns on the right, driving them backwards and across the Juah &quot;with great slaughter&quot;.

===Culmination===

A number of Maratha gunners who had feigned death when the British advanced over their position re-manned their guns and began to pour cannon fire into the rear of the 74th and Madras infantry. Wellesley ordered his four sepoy battalions to re-form and ward off any threat from the Maratha infantry and cavalry while the 78th were sent back to retake the Maratha gun line. Wellesley, meanwhile, galloped back to 7th Madras Native Cavalry, which had been held back in reserve to the east, and led a cavalry charge from the opposite direction. The gunners again stood their ground but were eventually driven from their guns and this time it was ensured that all those who remained were dead.

While Wellesley was preoccupied with re-taking the gun line, Pohlmann rallied his infantry and redeployed them into a semicircle with their backs to the Juah; their right flank across the river and their left in Assaye. However, most of the Maratha cannon, which had inflicted heavy losses on Wellesley&#x27;s infantry, had been captured or lay abandoned on the battlefield. Reluctant to join the fray, the Maratha cavalry lingered in the distance to the west. Most were Pindarries: loosely organised and lightly armed horsemen whose traditional role was to cut down fleeing enemy troops, harass convoy lines and carry out raids into enemy territory. They were not trained to attack well-formed infantry or heavily armed European cavalry, and did not play a further part in the battle.

With the remanned Maratha artillery silenced, Wellesley turned his attention to Pohlmann&#x27;s reformed infantry. Although Maxwell had suffered heavy losses, he had rallied his cavalry and returned to the field of battle. Wellesley ordered him to charge the Maratha left flank, while the infantry moved forward as a single line to meet the centre and right. The cavalry spurred forward but were met with a volley of canister shot which struck Maxwell, killing him instantly. Their momentum lost, the cavalry did not complete their charge, but veered away from the Maratha line at the last moment. The British and Madras infantry marched on against the Maratha position. Pohlmann&#x27;s men, their morale low, did not wait for the attack and instead retreated northwards across the Juah. Maratha sources claim the line marched away from the battlefield in an orderly manner on Pohlmann&#x27;s orders, but British accounts claim the Maratha infantry fled in an uncontrolled panic. Berar&#x27;s irregulars inside Assaye, now leaderless and having witnessed the fate of the regular infantry, abandoned the village and marched off northwards at around 18:00, followed shortly afterwards by the Maratha cavalry. Wellesley&#x27;s troops were exhausted and in no condition to pursue, and the native allied cavalry which had remained on the south bank of the Kailna and had not been engaged, refused to pursue without the support of the British and Madras cavalry.

==Aftermath==

The East India Company and British Army casualties amounted to 428 killed, 1,138 wounded and 18 missing; a total of 1,584 – over a third of the force engaged in combat. The 74th and the picket battalion were decimated; from a strength of about 500, the 74th lost ten officers killed and seven wounded, and 124 other ranks killed and 270 wounded. The pickets lost all their officers except their commander, Lieutenant Colonel William Orrock, and had only about 75 men remaining. Of the ten officers forming the general&#x27;s staff, eight were wounded or had their horses killed. Wellesley himself lost two horses; the first was shot from underneath him and the second was speared as he led the charge to re-capture the Maratha gun line.

The number of Maratha casualties is more difficult to ascertain. Despatches from British officers give a figure of 1,200 dead and many more wounded but some modern historians have estimated a total of 6,000 dead and wounded. The Marathas also surrendered seven stands of colours, large amounts of stores and ammunition and 98 cannon – most of which were later taken into service by the East India Company. Although Scindia and Berar&#x27;s army was not finished as a fighting force, several of Scindia&#x27;s regular infantry battalions and artillery crews had been destroyed. Their command structure had also been damaged: many of their European officers, including Colonel Pohlmann and Major Dupont, surrendered to the Company – which had offered amnesty to Europeans in the service of the Maratha armies – or deserted and sought employment with other native chieftains.

The sound of the guns at Assaye was heard by Stevenson who immediately broke up his camp to the west in an attempt to join the battle. However, he was misled by his guide and marched first on Borkardan before he reached the battlefield on the evening of 24 September. Suspecting that his guide had intentionally led him astray, Stevenson later had him hanged. He remained with Wellesley to assist with the wounded – troops were still being carried from the battlefield four days after the engagement – until ordered to recommence the pursuit of the Maratha army on 26 September. Wellesley remained to the south while he established a hospital at Ajanta and awaited reinforcements from Poona. Two months later, he combined with Stevenson to rout Scindia and Berar&#x27;s demoralised and weakened army at Argaon, and shortly afterwards stormed Berar&#x27;s fortress at Gawilghur. These victories, coupled with Lieutenant General Lake&#x27;s successful campaign in the north, induced the two Maratha chiefs to sue for peace.
Wellesley later told Stevenson that &quot;I should not like to see again such a loss as I sustained on the 23rd September, even if attended by such a gain&quot;, and in later life he referred to Assaye as &quot;the bloodiest for the numbers that I ever saw&quot;. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Munro, the Company&#x27;s district collector at Mysore, was critical of the high proportion of casualties and questioned Wellesley&#x27;s decision not to wait for Stevenson. He wrote to Wellesley: &quot;I am tempted to think that you did it with a view of sharing the glory with the smallest numbers&quot;. In response, Wellesley politely rebuffed Munro&#x27;s accusations and defended his action as necessary because he had received and acted upon incorrect intelligence regarding the Maratha position. Assaye was 34-year-old Wellesley&#x27;s first major success and despite his anguish over the heavy losses, it was a battle he always held in the highest estimation. After his retirement from active military service, the Duke of Wellington (as he later became known) considered Assaye the finest thing he ever did in the way of fighting even when compared to his later military career.

Lord Mornington and his Council lauded the battle as a &quot;most brilliant and important victory&quot;, and presented each of the Madras units and British regiments involved in the engagement with a set of honorary colours. The British regiments and native units were also awarded the Assaye battle honour and most were later given permission to adopt an Assaye elephant as part of their insignia. A public monument was also erected by the East India Company at Fort William, Calcutta to commemorate the victory. The 74th Regiment of foot later became known as the &quot;Assaye regiment&quot; due to their stand at the battle and their modern-day successors, the Royal Highland Fusiliers (2 SCOTS), still celebrate the anniversary of the battle each year. Of the native infantry battalions, only the Madras Sappers survive in their original form in the Indian Army but they no longer celebrate Assaye as it has been declared a repugnant battle honour by the Government of India.

==In fiction==
* Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s fictional character Richard Sharpe earned his battlefield promotion to officer&#x27;s rank by saving Wellesley&#x27;s life at the Battle of Assaye. The novel &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Triumph&quot; (HarperCollins, 1998, ) depicts the campaign and the battle in detail. Both men&#x27;s memories of Assaye are mentioned several more times throughout the series as Sharpe and Wellington&#x27;s careers progress. The television adaptation differs and depicts Sharpe saving Wellesley&#x27;s life from French soldiers in Spain during the later Peninsular War.

<doc id="505833" wikidata="Q398881" url="?curid=505833" title="AgustaWestland AW101">
<text>The AgustaWestland AW101 is a medium-lift helicopter in military and civil use. First flown in 1987, it was developed by a joint venture between Westland Helicopters in the United Kingdom and Agusta in Italy in response to national requirements for a modern naval utility helicopter. Several operators, including the armed forces of Britain, Denmark, and Portugal, use the name Merlin for their AW101 aircraft. It is manufactured at factories in Yeovil, England, and Vergiate, Italy. Licensed assembly work has also taken place in Japan and the United States.

Prior to 2007, the aircraft had been marketed under the designation EH101. The original designation was EHI 01, from the name given to the Anglo-Italian joint venture—European Helicopter Industries—but a transcription error changed this to EH101. In 2000, Westland Helicopters and Agusta merged to form AgustaWestland, leading to the type&#x27;s current designation.

The AW101 entered into service in 1999 and has since replaced several older helicopter types, such as the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King, performing roles such as medium-sized transport, anti-submarine warfare, search and rescue, and ship-based utility operations. The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) operates the CH-149 Cormorant variant for air-sea rescue. Another variant, the Lockheed Martin VH-71 Kestrel, was produced to serve in the United States presidential transport fleet before the program was cancelled and the aircraft sold off to Canada for parts. Civil operators use the AW101 for passenger and VIP transportation. The type has been deployed to active combat theatres, such as in support of coalition forces during the Iraq War and the war in Afghanistan.

==Development==
===Origins===
In 1977, the UK Ministry of Defence issued a requirement for an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter to replace the Royal Navy&#x27;s Westland Sea Kings, which were becoming inadequate in the face of advances in Soviet submarine technology. Westland Helicopters put together a proposal, designated WG.34, for a three-engined helicopter of similar dimensions to the Sea King; the WG.34 was to feature more autonomy and a greater range than its predecessor. At the same time, the Italian Navy (&quot;Marina Militare&quot;) was also considering the replacement of its fleet of Sea Kings, which had been built by the Italian company Agusta; Westland and Agusta soon began talks regarding the joint development of a successor helicopter.

Agusta and Westland finalised an agreement to work on the project together, and formed a jointly owned new company, EH Industries Limited (EHI), to pursue the development and marketing of the new helicopter to potential operators. On 12 June 1981, the UK government confirmed its participation in the project, allocated an initial budget of £20 million to develop nine pre-series examples. A major agreement, which secured funding for the majority of the EH101&#x27;s development program, was signed by both the British and Italian governments in 1984. At the 1985 Paris Air Show, Agusta showed a mock-up of a utility version of the new helicopter, leading to a more generalised design that could be customised to meet the needs of various civilian or military customers. The first prototype flew on 9 October 1987.

In 1987, Canada selected the EH101 to replace its Sea Kings in the anti-submarine warfare and search and rescue roles. The EH101&#x27;s third engine and increased range compared favourably with rival aircraft, such as the Sikorsky Seahawk. The range and de-icing capability were also seen as vital for North Atlantic operations. The fledgling EH101, of which up to 50 were on order to replace the Canadian Armed Forces&#x27;s (CAF) Sea Kings, found itself subject to a wider political battle between the country&#x27;s Conservative and Liberal parties, the latter viewing the aircraft as too costly. Critics attacked the EH101 purchase as excessive and unnecessary after the Cold War&#x27;s end in the early 1990s. Wide-ranging cost estimates were presented by both proponents and opponents of the EH101 procurement, with opponents backing life extensions of Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King and Boeing Vertol CH-113 Labrador helicopter fleets. The EH101 controversy was seen as a factor in the 1993 Canadian federal election. The order was cancelled by the new Liberal government in 1993 resulting in a $470 million cancellation fee.

===Into production===
Several pre-production aircraft were assembled during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The first pre-production aircraft had its first flight powered by General Electric CT7-2A engines on 9 October 1987. Flight tests were suspended for six months following the crash of the second pre-production aircraft on 21 January 1993. On 6 June 1993, the first EH101 took its maiden flight with the Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 turboshaft engine. Nine prototypes were built to explore military and civil applications, including a &quot;heliliner&quot; configuration. In February 1995, Britain formally placed its first order for a total of 22 EH101s; this was quickly followed by Italy&#x27;s order for 16 EH101s in October 1995. The EH101 order was not without controversy, the RAF had declared its preference for an all-Chinook fleet; also, Boeing allegedly offered cheaper terms for the Chinook. RAF deliveries began in 1997; RN deliveries started the following year.

Following the merger of Westland and Agusta to form AgustaWestland in 2000, there was no need for the separate EHI entity; the EH101 was formally re-branded as the AW101 in 2007. By April 2009, more than 180 AW101s had been sold worldwide; the combined operational fleet had also accumulated a total of 170,000 flying hours.

===Further developments===
In November 2007, Algeria signed a contract for six AW101 helicopters. In August 2012, it was reported that Algeria had signed an agreement with AgustaWestland for the provision of up to 80 helicopters, 42 of which were to be AW101s. Under the terms of this arrangement, early aircraft were to be manufactured by AgustaWestland, while Algeria was to commence the assembly of some AW101s later on.

By September 2013 AgustaWestland was in the process of acquiring civil certification for the AW101; prospective customers include offshore oil platform operators and VIP clients. As of February 2014, AgustaWestland was considering adapting the AW101 as a heavyweight unmanned aerial vehicle, it is proposed that in this configuration an AW101 could be optionally crewed.

On 7 June 2010, it was announced that Boeing had acquired a manufacturing licence and the rights from AgustaWestland for US production of a localised AW101 variant, designated as the Boeing 101. In October 2012, the aircraft was submitted in a U.S. Air Force competition to replace the HH-60 Pave Hawk; however, the bid was dropped three months later.

==Design==

===Overview===

The AW101 follows a conventional design layout, but makes use of advanced technologies, such as the design of the rotor blades, avionics systems, and extensive use of composite materials. The fuselage structure is modular and comprises an aluminium–lithium alloy, designed to be both light and damage-resistant. The AW101 is designed for operating in extreme weather conditions; it is fitted with a de-icing system and rated to operate in temperatures ranging between −45 and +50 °C. The aircraft&#x27;s control systems allow the AW101 to maintain a stable hover in crosswinds.

An active vibration control system, known as the &quot;active control of structural response system&quot;, reduces airframe vibration by up to 80%, increasing crew comfort and minimising buildup of stress on the airframe. The cockpit is fitted with armoured seats for the crew, and can withstand an impact velocity of over 10 m/s. Dual flight controls are provided, though the AW101 can be flown by a single person. The pilots&#x27; instrument displays include six full-colour high-definition screens and an optional mission display; a digital map or forward looking infrared (FLIR) display can also be installed.

===Powerplant===

The AW101 is powered by three turboshaft engines. Initially the Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 producing and the General Electric CT7 producing were the two available engine types, but by 2020 new aircraft were only being sold with the CT7-8E. The RTM322 powerplant was specifically developed for the AW101; it was subsequently adopted on the AgustaWestland WAH-64 Apache and the NHIndustries NH90 helicopters. According to Rolls-Royce, about 80% of AW101s use the RTM322

The engines power an diameter five-bladed main rotor. The rotor blades are constructed from carbon/glass with nomex honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping of the main rotor blades is derived from the BERP rotor blades first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade tip and reduces the acoustic signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed this increases the AW101&#x27;s maximum take-off weight.

Each engine is supplied by a separate fuel tank using dual booster pumps. Optional fourth and fifth tanks can be added to act as a reservoir supply, topping up the main tanks during flight, increasing range or endurance. The AW101 can also be fitted with a probe for aerial refuelling. Self-sealing fuel tanks are an optional item to be selected by the customer. An inlet particle separator system can be installed, protecting the engine when operating in sandy environments.

===Armament and defensive systems===
Most variants of the AW101 are equipped with self-defence systems, such as chaff and flare dispensers, directed infrared countermeasures (infrared jammers), ESM (electronic support measures in the form of RF heads), and a laser detection and warning system. British Merlins have been outfitted with protective armour against small-arms fire. A side-mounted forward looking infrared (FLIR) imaging sensor has been fitted to some variants.

Two hardpoints are present in the underside of the airframe on which the HM1 model can carry four Sting Ray torpedoes or Mk 11 Mod 3 depth charges. Some customers have chosen to deploy the Marte anti-ship missile on the AW101; as of 2011, the Royal Navy is considering equipping their Merlin fleet with an anti-surface missile. The Mk1, Mk3 and Mk3A variants can mount general purpose machine guns in up to five locations in the main cabin, aimed out of both door and window apertures. AgustaWestland has examined the integration of rockets and additional ground-attack weapons.

===Avionics===
Westland and IBM formed a consortium in 1991 to perform the helicopter&#x27;s complex systems integration. The AW101 features a network of helicopter management and mission systems designed to reduce pilot workload and enable the helicopter to undertake a wide variety of missions. A digital automatic flight control system (AFCS) is employed by the AW101. The AFCS allows the operation of a four-axis (pitch, roll, yaw and collective) autopilot and the automatic stabilisation system, and is linked in with the aircraft&#x27;s flight management systems. The AFCS, manufactured by Smiths Aerospace, is a dual-duplex system using two flight computers to provide redundancy and fault-tolerance.

The AW101&#x27;s navigation system includes a GPS receiver and inertial navigation system, VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR), instrument landing system (ILS), TACAN, and automatic direction finding. The Mk1 and Mk3 are equipped with a Doppler velocity system (DVS) which provides relative ground velocities; the DVS is also linked into the AFCS as part of the autostabilisation system. For safety, the aircraft is equipped with obstacle and terrain avoidance warning systems, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), and both voice and flight data recorders.

The AW101 was initially equipped with the Ferranti Blue Kestrel search and detection radar which is capable of 360 degree scanning and can detect small targets as far as 25 nautical miles away. As part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Merlin HM2 upgrade program, Lockheed Martin implemented a series of improvements to the radar, notably allowing it to track 40 times the number of targets previously capable. Danish EH101s are fitted with the RDR-1600 search and weather radar. Mk 2 Royal Navy Merlins are equipped with the AQS903 anti-submarine system for processing sonographic data from sonobuoys to detect and target submerged submarines. The AQS903 was derived from the AQS901 system on the earlier Hawker Siddeley Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft.

===Crew and cargo===

The AW101 is typically operated by a crew of three: a pilot, an observer, and a crewman/operator. The pilot is able to fly for the majority of a mission in a hands-off mode, enabled by the sophisticated autopilot. All crew members have individual access to management computers and tactical information.

The fuselage has a volume of and the cargo compartment is in length, wide and high. The military version of the AW101 can accommodate up to 24 seated or 45 standing combat troops and their equipment. Alternative loads include a medical team and 16 stretchers, and cargo pallets.

The ramp, , can take a load, allowing it to carry vehicles such as Land Rovers. The ramp and cabin floor are fitted with flush tie-down points. A cargo hook under the fuselage can carry external loads of via the use of a semi-automatic cargo release unit (SACRU). A rescue hoist and a hover trim controller are fitted at the cargo door. An optional cargo winch can be installed near to the rear ramp.

==Operational history==

===Royal Navy===

The British Royal Navy&#x27;s final order was for 44 ASW aircraft, originally designated &quot;Merlin HAS.1&quot; (Helicopter, Anti-Submarine Mark 1) but soon changed to &quot;Merlin HM1&quot; (Helicopter, Maritime Mark 1). The first fully operational Merlin was delivered on 17 May 1997, entering service on 2 June 2000. All aircraft were delivered by the end of 2002, and are operated by 3 Fleet Air Arm squadrons: 814 NAS, 820 NAS, 824 NAS and 829 NAS (now disbanded and merged with 814 NAS), all based at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall. 700 NAS was the Merlin Operational Evaluation Unit from 2000 to 2008. In March 2004, Navy Merlins were temporarily grounded following an incident at RNAS Culdrose in which a tail rotor failed due to a manufacturing defect. An improved tail rotor was designed and adopted on most AW101s which significantly reduced associated maintenance.

In 1995, it was announced that the Navy&#x27;s Westland Lynx helicopters would be retired in favour of an all-Merlin fleet. However, the subsequent Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010 stated that the future naval helicopters would be the Merlin and the Wildcat, a derivative of the Lynx. Royal Navy Merlins have seen action in the Caribbean, on counter-narcotics and hurricane support duties, as well as maritime security duties in the Persian Gulf. Merlins have also seen active duty in Iraq, providing support to British and coalition forces based in the region.

The Merlin HM1 has been cleared to operate from the Royal Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships, Type 23 frigates, Type 45 destroyer and several Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) vessels including the . 30 aircraft have been upgraded to &quot;Merlin HM2&quot; standard under the £750m Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme; Lockheed Martin UK delivered the final HM2 on 11 July 2016. The HM2 has a new mission system, digital cockpit, electro-optical camera and multi-static sonar processing. The HM2 achieved IOC on 30 June 2014 after flying 480 hours from &quot;Illustrious&quot; during Exercise Deep Blue earlier that month. It was also reported that some of the eight airframes not scheduled to be upgraded for financial reasons may be updated. Five HM2s are in maintenance at a time, leaving 25 available, of which 14 were theoretically to be assigned to the . However, in practice with just 30 Merlin HM2s in service, it may be impossible to deploy 14 aircraft on a single operational carrier on a full time basis. During the 2021 carrier strike group deployment to the Pacific, for instance, seven Merlins were embarked with the task group.

In addition to its ASW role, the HM2 will be able to carry an airborne early warning (AEW) pod known as the Crowsnest, replacing the Sea King ASaC7. In September 2011, Thales UK proposed re-using Sea King ASaC7 equipment, such as the Searchwater 2000, on the Merlin; Lockheed Martin has proposed developing a new multi-functional sensor for both the AW101 and other aircraft. Lockheed originally planned to use a derivative of the F-35&#x27;s APG-81 radar; however, a rival Elta system and the Thales system both commenced flight trials in 2014. On 22 May 2015, the MOD and prime contractor Lockheed Martin UK selected Thales to provide the radar and mission system for the Crowsnest. Initial operating capability of the system was significantly delayed. While Crowsnest was deployed with the U.K. carrier strike group in 2021, it experienced operating challenges and revised plans meant that Crowsnest achieved initial operating capability in July 2023. Full operating capability is expected in 2024/25. It has been reported that initially only five Merlins will be equipped with Crowsnest, three of these being normally assigned to the &quot;high readiness&quot; aircraft carrier.

Problems with Merlin/Crowsnest have caused the Royal Navy to look for a replacement. As of 2023 the system, which is still to achieve full operating capability, has a planned retirement date of 2029. In 2021, the UK&#x27;s Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) announced that options would be examined and might draw on the already existing Project Vixen, researching the utility of a naval unmanned system that could encompass strike, AEW, and air-to-air refuelling components. If implemented, the replacement of Merlin/Crowsnest by another system would permit all Merlin helicopters to focus on ASW operations for the remainder of their service lives.

On 15 December 2009, plans were announced to transfer RAF Merlin HC3s and HC3As to the Royal Navy&#x27;s Commando Helicopter Force to replace retiring Sea King HC4 helicopters. The Sea King was set to retire in 2016, leaving the Navy operating a combination of the Wildcat and Merlin. 846 NAS reformed with ex-RAF Merlin HC3s on 30 September 2014; 845 NAS followed on 9 July 2015. On 25 May 2018, the first of 25 converted Royal Marines Commando Merlin Mk4/4A were delivered to Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Yeovilton. In July 2020, the Merlin HM2 and HC4/4A helicopters were planned to be in service until 2029 and 2030, respectively. On 11 June 2021, it was confirmed that their Out of Service Date (OSD) had been moved to 2040.
By the end of 2022, all HC helicopters were upgraded to the HC4/4A Commando Merlin standard.

===Royal Air Force===
The RAF ordered 22 Merlin HC3 for transport missions, the first of which entered service in January 2001 with No. 28 Squadron RAF based at RAF Benson. The type is equipped with extended-range fuel tanks and is capable of air-to-air refuelling. The Merlin is frequently utilised for troop transport duties and for the transport of bulky objects, either internally or underslung, including vehicles and artillery. The Merlin Depth Maintenance Facility at RNAS Culdrose performed most tasks upon the Merlin HC3.

The Merlin&#x27;s first operational deployment was to the Balkans region in 2003. RAF Merlins were first deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Telic in 2004, supporting coalition forces and were operated as the main medevac asset in southern Iraq; both Flight Lieutenant Kev Harris and Flight Lieutenant Michelle Goodman were awarded the DFC during this period. Merlins routinely operated around Basra until Britain&#x27;s withdrawal in June 2009.

In 2002, Westland made an unsuccessful unsolicited offer to the British Ministry of Defence, proposing an enhanced Merlin variant intended to satisfy the demand for additional lift capacity. An alternative measure was the acquisition of six AW101s from Denmark in 2007; designated &quot;Merlin HC3A&quot;, these were assigned to the RAF, allowing Merlins to be deployed in Afghanistan. The HC3A is used for training and not for frontline operations due to various configuration differences. In December 2007, a second Merlin squadron, No. 78 Squadron was formed at RAF Benson.
In 2009, five Merlin Mk3s were operating in Afghanistan, transporting troops and supplies. The deployment to Afghanistan was criticised as the aircraft reportedly lacked protective Kevlar armour. By July 2010, the Merlin fleet was fully fitted with ballistic armour. The deployment of Merlins to Afghanistan allowed the detachment of Sea Kings to be withdrawn from the region in October 2011. As part of the UK drawdown in Afghanistan, Merlins were withdrawn from theatre in June 2013.

In 2012, the RAF&#x27;s Merlin HC3/3A fleet began to be transferred to the Royal Navy for use by the Commando Helicopter Force. Royal Navy personnel worked alongside RAF crew at Benson to build experience during the transition. The £454m Merlin Life Sustainment Programme resulted in 25 HC3/3A airframes being fitted with the cockpit electronics of the HM2, folding tails and main rotor heads, strengthened landing gear, deck lashing mounting points, obsolescence updates, fast-roping points and a common emergency egress system. The first HC4 began flight trials in September 2017, with an IOC in mid-2018; an interim folding main rotor head will be fitted to some HC3 for shipborne operations prior to the HC4 upgrade.

Command of the UK Merlin HC3/3A fleet was formally transferred from the RAF to the Royal Navy during a ceremony at RAF Benson on 30 September 2014. As part of the same ceremony, the RAF&#x27;s 78 Sqn was disbanded and the Royal Navy&#x27;s 846 Naval Air Squadron stood-up with the Merlin. The RAF&#x27;s 28(AC) continued to operate as part of the Commando Helicopter Force until July 2015, when 28(AC) Sqn stood down and 845 Naval Air Squadron stood-up. 846 NAS relocated from RAF Benson to RNAS Yeovilton in March 2015, with 845 NAS following in June 2016.

===Italian Navy===
In 1997, the Italian government ordered 16 AW101 helicopters for the Italian Navy, with options for four more. These AW101 included eight of the anti-surface/submarine (ASuW/ASW) version, four airborne early warning (AEW), four amphibious support helicopters (ASH). The government then exercised its option for four additional ASH helicopters, which were delivered by 2006. The same year the government ordered two more AW101 ASH helicopters in a slightly modified version.

The first Italian Navy production helicopter (&quot;MM81480&quot;) flew on 4 October 1999 and was officially presented to the press on 6 December 1999. Italy accepted delivery of the 21st AW101, configured for anti-submarine warfare, on 4 August 2009. In total 22 AW101 helicopters have been delivered to the Italian Navy.

Italian AW101s have operated from a variety of ships and have seen service overseas; in 2009 the Italian Navy used its AW101 fleet as executive transports for visiting heads of state and officials during the 35th G8 summit. In 2010, the Italian Navy deployed three AW101s to Afghanistan, where they were flown in both the transport and utility roles. In 2011, it was reported that the Italian contingent in Afghanistan, consisting of AW101s, had been providing coverage of a wide area of the country.

===Italian Air Force===
In June 2011 the AW101 was chosen by the Italian Air Force to replace its ageing Sea King HH-3F helicopters in the combat search and rescue role. A total of 15 helicopters in the HH-101A variant were ordered and delivered between 2016 and 2020.

===Royal Canadian Air Force===

In 1997, in light of the declining condition of its helicopter fleet, Canada launched the Canadian Search and Rescue Helicopter competition. It was won by the EH101, which was designated &quot;CH-149 Cormorant&quot; in Canadian service.

In 2004, the EH101 was entered into a Canadian competition to replace the shipboard Sea King fleet, but the Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone was selected. In 2013, following difficulties with the CH-148 procurement, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) was reported to be seriously considering cancelling the contract with Sikorsky and was investigating the possibility of procuring the AW101 instead. However, an initial batch of six Cyclones was delivered to the RCAF in June 2015.

In December 2022, Canada&#x27;s Department of National Defence announced a C$1.24-billion contract for procurement of three additional aircraft and upgrades to the existing fleet to current configuration of the helicopter; this will increase the fleet to 16 aircraft. The RCAF also acquired its own advanced training simulator configured to the new modernized cockpit.

===Royal Danish Air Force===
In 2001, the Royal Danish Air Force (RDAF) announced the purchase of eight EH101s for SAR duties and six tactical troop transports for 722 Squadron. The last of the 14 AW101s was delivered in March 2007 and the first SAR AW101s became operational out of Karup Airport in April 2007. In 2007, the six troop transport AW101s were transferred to the British MOD; in exchange, the British government ordered six new-build AW101s as replacements for the RDAF.
Danish AW101s have a higher gross weight capacity of 15,600 kg and were, as delivered, coated in a paint designed to reduce the aircraft&#x27;s infrared signature. In the SAR role, RDAF AW101s have a crew of six and were initially painted yellow to distinguish themselves from AW101 allocated to military duties, but were later painted green, and all 14 AW101s are used for SAR and troop transport.

On 28 January 2008, the drive shaft of a Danish AW101 broke, leading to an emergency landing at Billund Airport. Following the incident, the Danish fleet was grounded as a precaution and the AW101&#x27;s future was publicly debated. In the first six months of 2008, the RDAF reported an operational availability of roughly 50%, well below the target of 80%, partly due to an inadequate maintenance organisation and staff shortages.

In January 2011, the Danish Ministry of Defence reportedly could not afford the retrofitting of the AW101 fleet for Afghanistan operations, against earlier reports of a deployment in 2012. In February 2013, &quot;Aviation Week&quot; reported that earlier reliability problems had been resolved and that a full upgrade package would be applied to Danish AW101s; these included the addition of electronic warfare pods and a new electro-optical system, in advance of a deployment in Afghanistan in 2014. In September 2013, Danish AW101s were to receive L-3 Wescam MX-15 electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors; SAR aircraft already carry the FLIR Systems Star Safire II EO/IR sensor.

===Royal Norwegian Air Force===

On 25 October 2007, a project started that had the intent to replace all Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters with new rescue helicopters by 2020. On 19 December 2013, a contract was signed between AgustaWestland and the government, for the purchase of 16 AW101 helicopters. The agreement came about after fierce competition between different manufacturers to satisfy the Norwegian requirements. Participants were AgustaWestland, Eurocopter, NHIndustries, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and Boeing. The government considered that AgustaWestland AW101 met the requirements and specifications in the best possible way.

On 12 June 2017, Per-Willy Amundsen, Minister of Justice and Public Security, announced the opening of Leonardo&#x27;s AW101 Norway Training Centre at Stavanger Sola Air Station. The training centre includes an AW101 Full Flight Simulator (FFS), jointly developed by Leonardo and CAE to Level D, which is a CAE Series 3000 device, along with an AW101 SAR console training system linked to the FFS to provide rear crew training. The first training course at the centre started prior to delivery of the first rotorcraft. The training centre will be used by both Norwegian and foreign AW101 customers.

The first AW101 was delivered in November 2017. The Norwegian AW101s officially started operating in the rescue role on 1 September 2020. The Sea King was phased out in December 2023, after 47 years of service as rescue helicopter in the Royal Norwegian Air force, and replaced with the AW101. The AW101 is named &quot;SAR Queen&quot; in Norwegian service.

===Portuguese Air Force===
The Portuguese Air Force had purchased 12 Merlins under a €446 million contract, the first of which was delivered on 22 December 2004. The type has been used to conduct transport, search and rescue, and maritime surveillance missions, progressively replacing the Aérospatiale Puma previously tasked with these missions. The main role of Portuguese AW101s is to perform search and rescue missions within Portugal&#x27;s maritime zone. They are operated by 751 Squadron and are kept on constant alert at three bases: Montijo near Lisbon, Lajes Field on the Azores, and Porto Santo Island.

===Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force===
The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) ordered 14 aircraft in 2003 to use in both the airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM) and transport roles. The AW101 was modified by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and the Japan Defense Agency designated the model MCH-101. Special features include the automated folding of the rotor and tail. For the mine-hunting role, the MCH-101 has been outfitted with Northrop Grumman&#x27;s AQS-24A airborne mine-hunting system and AN/AES-1 Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) for a complete surface-to-bottom mine detection capability, as well as Mk-104 acoustic mine sweeping gear.

In 2002, AgustaWestland, Kawasaki and Marubeni entered a general agreement for cooperation; Kawasaki began the assembly of both the CH-101 and the MCH-101 in 2003. Kawasaki also began licensed production of the RTM322 engines in 2005. In a separate agreement between Marubeni and AgustaWestland, a supply depot was established in Japan to support the MCH-101 and CH-101 fleets. The first MCH-101 was delivered to the JMSDF on 3 March 2006.

The MCH-101 will replace the MH-53E (S-80-M-1) in the AMCM role. The CH-101 will operate in the transport/support role for Antarctic expeditions, replacing the Sikorsky S-61A, and will be working in coordination with the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.

After a whistle-blower alleged that the MSDF&#x27;s preference had been improperly changed an investigation was launched. On 16 December 2016 the Japanese Ministry of Defense (the Defense Agency having been upgraded to a ministry in 2007) stated that it had not confirmed lobbying efforts but the ministry admonished Tomohisa Takei, the JMSDF chief of staff, for mentioning the MCH-101 by name during the procurement process to his subordinates. This had come after MSDF officials had reported that the Mitsubishi-built SH helicopters may be best.

===VIP and other usage===
AgustaWestland developed a specialised luxury variant, the AW101 VVIP (Very Very Important Person, i.e. a head of state), aimed at business and VIP customers. As of April 2009, 15% of all AW101s sold were for VIP purposes. By September 2013, customers operating the VIP variant included Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Turkmenistan.

The AW101 was being acquired by the United States Marine Corps under the VXX program as a replacement for the Presidential Marine One helicopters. Designated &quot;VH-71 Kestrel&quot;, the variant was heavily customised and equipped with various self-defence systems. However the programme encountered significant cost overruns and political opposition, which led to the procurement being scrapped in June 2009. After the cancellation, the delivered helicopters were sold to Canada for $164 million, where they were used as source of spare parts for its fleet of AgustaWestland CH-149 Cormorant search-and-rescue helicopters. Separately, the Marine Corps had also conducted studies into the adoption of the EH101 as a fall-back option to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor during the 1990s.

In April 2009, India ordered 12 AW101 to serve as executive transport helicopters for the Indian president and prime minister. The selection followed field trial assessments between the AW101 and the Sikorsky S-92 held in 2008. However, the procurement was put on hold and subsequently cancelled due to the 2013 Indian helicopter bribery scandal, in which Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland&#x27;s parent company, was accused of using bribery to win the contract. The three helicopters delivered as part of the contract may be returned to the manufacturer as part of the arbitration process.

===Potential operators===
The Royal Norwegian Air Force is considering ordering the AW101 Merlins for anti-submarine use.

<doc id="505837" wikidata="Q4381730" url="?curid=505837" title="AgustaWestland CH-149 Cormorant">
<text>The AgustaWestland CH-149 Cormorant is the air-sea rescue variant of the AgustaWestland AW101 (formerly EH101) helicopter for the Canadian Armed Forces. Developed by AgustaWestland in Italy (now merged as part of Leonardo), the CH-149 is a medium-lift helicopter for military applications.

==Design and development==
In 1977, the British Ministry of Defence issued a requirement for an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter to replace the Royal Navy&#x27;s Westland Sea Kings. Westland responded with design &quot;WG.34&quot; that was approved for development. Meanwhile, the &quot;Marina Militare&quot; (Italian Navy) was also seeking a replacement for its Agusta-built Sea Kings, leading Agusta to discussions with Westland about the possibility of a joint development. This culminated in the joint venture being finalised in November 1979 and a new company called EH Industries was formed to manage the project the following year - EH being an abbreviation for &quot;Elicottero Helicopter&quot;, the Italian and English words for &quot;helicopter.&quot; As the design studies progressed, EH became aware of a broader market for an aircraft with the same capabilities required by the British and Italian navies, leading to a more generalised design that could be customised. After a lengthy development, the first prototype flew on October 9, 1987.

Following the lead of the UK and Italy, the Canadian government placed a C$4.4 billion order in 1987 for 48 (later 42) EH101s to replace the Canadian Forces&#x27;s Sikorsky CH-124 Sea Kings and Boeing Vertol CH-113 Labradors. These were to be assembled in Canada under the designations &quot;CH-148 Petrel&quot; (33 originally, reduced to 28) and &quot;CH-149 Chimo&quot; (15) in the anti-submarine warfare and air-sea rescue roles respectively. The replacement programme was cancelled, however, after a change of government in 1993, leading to the payment of $157.8 million in cancellation penalties.

In 1998, the Canadian government announced that the CH-113s would now be replaced by a new scaled down search-and-rescue variant of the EH101, carrying the designation &quot;CH-149 Cormorant&quot;. Unlike the Petrel/Chimo contract, these 15 aircraft were to be built entirely in Europe. The first two aircraft arrived in Canada in September 2001 and entered service the following year.

When it became obvious that the Sea Kings were in need of immediate replacement, the EH101 was again part of a Canadian competition (Maritime Helicopter Project), against a variant of the Sikorsky H-92, for a total price tag of C$5 billion. The Sikorsky entry won the competition on July 23, 2004, with the first six delivered June 2015.

==Operational history==
The first operational CH-149 flight occurred in 2002 when a Cormorant of 442 Squadron performed a medical evacuation from a merchant ship offshore in Hecate Strait. An even more dramatic demonstration of Cormorant capabilities occurred in January 2003 when a 103 Squadron CH-149 successfully flew a 1,200 km round-trip rescue mission to the Finnish ro-ro cargo ship MS &quot;Camilla&quot; off Newfoundland. Two refuelling stops at the Hibernia oil platform were required. This rescue became the subject of an installment of the 2007 National Geographic Channel documentary series &quot;Trapped&quot;.

On October 25, 2006, a search and rescue crew from 442 Squadron in Comox, British Columbia, conducted a rescue from the side of a cliff in a box canyon with the CH-149 Cormorant which Canadian Forces Captain Sean Morris described as &quot;pretty much the worst situation I&#x27;ve been in my entire life.&quot; Captain Morris and his colleagues received international recognition for the rescue as the first Canadian winner of the Prince Philip Helicopter Rescue Award issued by the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators in the UK 

In August 2010, the Canadian Forces fleet of 14 CH-149 Cormorants passed 40,000 operational hours. The fleet had a higher flying rate than any other AW101 fleet and Cormorant 901, currently stationed at Canadian Forces Base Comox with 442 Squadron, has the highest number of airframe hours on any of the AW101s anywhere in the world. The worldwide fleet of 190 AW101 helicopters had achieved in excess of 200,000 flight hours in Canada, UK, Italy, Denmark, Portugal, and Japan.

In June 2011, several former USN VH-71s, which are also based on the AW101, were purchased by Canada to be used as spare parts for the CH-149 fleet. In 2013, Canada was reportedly studying whether up to four of the VH-71s could be certified for operational use.

In 2017, the Liberal government announced funding for the mid-life upgrade of the fleet, to be led by &#x27;Team Cormorant&#x27;, a team composed of Leonardo Helicopters, IMP Aerospace and Defense, CAE, GE Canada and Collins Aerospace. Estimated at around C$1.5bn, the programmes would offer a common fleet featuring latest avionic and mission systems, advanced radars and sensors, vision enhancement and tracking systems as well as a new GE CT7-8E engine. On May 10, 2017, a report by the Senate Standing Committee on National Security and Defence recommended the government move forward with a proposal to expand the Cormorant fleet by upgrading the 14 CH-149 aircraft and converting 7 VH-71 airframes currently in storage to the same operational capability. This would expand the Cormorant fleet to 21 aircraft, and keep them operational until 2040. This recommendation was not adopted by the Liberal Government and instead, in August 2019, the Government announced that &quot;at least&quot; two additional Cormorant helicopters would be purchased while the other 14 would be modernized. Ostensibly this might have permitted some Cormorant helicopters to be based at CFB Trenton in central Canada, in addition to other bases on the East and West coasts. However, by 2021 it was reported that the entire acquisition had been put on hold, at least temporarily, as being &quot;unaffordable&quot;.

In December 2022, the C$1.2 billion mid-life fleet upgrade was awarded to Leonardo U.K. Ltd. This contract will upgrade the existing fleet to the Model 612 standard. Additionally, the contract will add three new aircraft to the fleet, by using predominantly new and some used parts from the VH-71 and current CH-149 fleets which includes transmissions, landing gears and control surfaces. A second, C$78 million contract with CAE Inc. was also announced for a domestic flight simulator to &quot;address[...] the need for an improved training solution.&quot;

** 442 Transport and Rescue Squadron

==Incidents and accidents==
* Upon its entry to service, the AW101 experienced tail rotor hub cracking issues; including one British Merlin crashing on 30 March 2004 which was caused by this issue. The CH-149 Cormorant has been grounded and been placed on limited flight status multiple times due to hub cracks; all 15 aircraft in Canadian inventory showed cracks of varying degrees shortly after entry to service in 2004. A subsequent redesign was issued in 2005; out of the six aircraft which had the new hubs installed, three showed cracking one month later. A new Articulated Tail Rotor (ATR) with elastomeric bearings has been adopted on the AW101, based on a proven design used on the AW139 medium-twin helicopter. The ATR is now standard issue on new AW101s and is offered for retrofit on existing fleets.
* On 13 July 2006, a CH-149 of 413 Transport and Rescue Squadron crashed into the waters of Chedabucto Bay off the coast of Canso, Nova Scotia while flying in heavy fog during a search and rescue exercise with a Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary vessel. Three Canadian Forces personnel were killed and four others were injured. Mechanical failure was formally ruled out as the cause of the crash. On 11 March 2008, the Directorate of Flight Safety for the Canadian Forces announced that pilot error was the cause, and that Canadian Forces officials were aware of a lack of training received by pilots. Preliminary reports indicate that pilots were unaware of the proper use of the autopilot, leading to a controlled flight into terrain.
* A Cormorant crashed on March 10, 2022 during a training exercise at 9 Wing in Gander, Newfoundland. A seat malfunction caused the loss of outside visual references in combination with severe vertical vibration resulted in an unrecognized spatial disorientation of the pilot flying. The right outboard wheel, the right horizontal stabilizer, and the main rotor blades impacted the runway near simultaneously. The aircraft was destroyed. Four of the six occupants sustained minor injuries while two occupants sustained serious injuries.

<doc id="505846" wikidata="Q5318392" url="?curid=505846" title="Dyad symmetry">
<text>In genetics, dyad symmetry refers to two areas of a DNA strand whose base pair sequences are inverted repeats of each other. They are often described as palindromes.

For example, the following shows dyad symmetry between sequences GAATAC and GTATTC which are reverse complements of each other.
...GAATAC...CTG...GTATTC...

==Involvement in transcription==
Since the two reverse complementary sequences will fold and base-pair with each other, the sequence of bases between them form a hairpin loop. This structure is thought to destabilize the binding of RNA polymerase enzyme to DNA (hence terminating transcription). Dyad symmetry is known to have a role in the rho independent method of transcription termination in &quot;E. coli&quot;. Regions of dyad symmetry in the DNA sequence stall the RNA polymerase enzyme as it transcribes them.

==Involvement in prophage integration==
Temperate bacteriophages integrate into the host genome at specific interrupted dyad symmetry sequences using the phage encoded enzyme integrase (see prophage integration).

<doc id="505847" wikidata="Q3494356" url="?curid=505847" title="Left-handed specialist">
<text>In baseball, a left-handed specialist (also known as lefty specialist) is a relief pitcher who throws left-handed and specializes in pitching to left-handed batters, weak right-handed batters, and switch-hitters who bat poorly right-handed. Because baseball practices permanent substitution, these pitchers frequently pitch to a very small number of batters in any given game (historically, often only one), and rarely pitch to strictly right-handed batters. Most Major League Baseball (MLB) teams have several left-handed pitchers on their rosters, at least one of whom is a left-handed specialist. A left-handed specialist is sometimes called a &quot;LOOGY&quot; (or Lefty One-Out GuY), coined by John Sickels, and may be used pejoratively.

==Pitching style==
The pitcher generally has an advantage when his handedness is the same as the batter&#x27;s, and the batter has an advantage when they are opposite. This is because a right-handed pitcher&#x27;s breaking balls move to the left from the pitcher&#x27;s perspective, which causes it to cross the plate with its lateral movement away from a right-handed batter but towards a left-handed batter (and vice versa for a left-handed pitcher), and because batters generally find it easier to hit a ball that is over the plate. Furthermore, since most pitchers are right-handed, left-handed batters generally have less experience with left-handed pitchers. A left-handed pitcher may also be brought in to face a switch-hitter who generally bats left-handed, forcing the batter to shift to his less-effective right-handed stance or to take the disadvantages of batting left-handed against a left-handed pitcher. Research from 2011 to 2013 has shown that a pinch hitter (usually right-handed) is often used when a left-handed reliever is inserted in the game, thereby reducing or negating the pitcher&#x27;s platoon split advantage. Only a handful of left-handed relievers face a higher percentage of left-handed batters than right-handed batters over the course of a season.

==History==
In the MLB season, there were 28 left-handed relievers who were not their team&#x27;s closer and pitched 45 or more games. Only four averaged fewer than an inning per appearance. From 2001 to 2004, over 75 percent of left handed relievers meeting those criteria averaged less than one inning. Left-handed reliever John Candelaria was one of the early specialists in 1991, pitching 59 games and averaged .571 innings. In 1992, he allowed no earned runs—excluding inherited runners—in 43 of the 50 games. Jesse Orosco became a left-handed specialist later in his 24-season career and retired at the age of 46. From 1991 to 2003, he never averaged more than an inning pitched per appearance.

During the MLB season, there were seven relief pitchers who averaged less than two outs recorded per appearance, all of whom were left-handed. Joe Thatcher, a left-handed specialist, appeared in 72 games with innings pitched, and had the fewest outs recorded per appearance, with 1.6.

Mike Myers is considered one of the most successful LOOGY pitchers of all time, having made 883 appearances for nine different teams over the span of a 13 year career, 1995–2007. During that time, he threw innings. Recognizing the limited skill and playing time of pitchers in the role, Myers has said &quot;We were like the field goal kicker, but only when the kicker was called in when the game was on the line. It was their best against you, every time, and you couldn&#x27;t mess up.&quot;

German-born Will Ohman discovered his talent by accident while playing catch as a walk-on player for Pepperdine University when he tried a different slider grip and noticed an extreme break on the ball. He went on to pitch in 483 major league games over 10 seasons between 2000 and 2012. Explaining the precarious nature of the position, Ohman said, &quot;I was the last guy on the roster in every clubhouse I was in. You do your job and other people get the glory.&quot;

===Three-batter minimum===
Since the start of the MLB season, all pitchers, whether starters or relievers, have been required to face at least three batters, or pitch to the end of the half-inning in which they enter the game. Exceptions are allowed only for incapacitating injury or illness while pitching. Journalist Anthony Castrovince of &quot;MLB.com&quot; opined that the new rule would &quot;effectively end the so-called &quot;LOOGY&quot; (left-handed one-out guy) and other specialist roles in which pitchers are brought in for one very specific matchup.&quot;

==Right-handed specialist==
The right-handed specialist (sometimes called a &quot;ROOGY&quot;, for Righty One-Out GuY) is the less common vice versa contrast to the left-handed specialist, due to there being a higher percentage of right-handed batters and pitchers in Major League Baseball, but they are occasionally featured.

<text>Port Perry is a community located in Scugog, Ontario, Canada. The town is located northeast of central Toronto, north of Oshawa, and east of Whitby. Port Perry has a population of 9,553 as of 2021.
Port Perry serves as the administrative and commercial centre for the township of Scugog. The town is home to a 24-bed hospital (Lakeridge Health Port Perry), Scugog Township&#x27;s municipal offices and many retail establishments. Port Perry serves as a hub for many small communities in the Scugog area, such as Greenbank, Raglan, Caesarea, Blackstock and Nestleton/Nestleton Station. The Great Blue Heron Charitable Casino is a major employer. Located at the basin of the Trent-Severn Waterways is Lake Scugog, one of Ontario&#x27;s largest man-made lakes.

==History==

The area around Port Perry was first surveyed as part of Reach Township by Major Samuel Street Wilmot in 1809. The first settler in the area was Reuben Crandell, a United Empire Loyalist who built a homestead with his wife in May 1821. Their original home is still in use and can be seen on King Street between Prince Albert and Manchester. In November 1821, Lucy Ann Crandell became the first child of European descent born in the area. In 1831, Crandell and his family moved to a homestead at what became Crandell&#x27;s Corners (later called Borelia). It had its own Post Office, near the present-day junction of Queen Street and Highway 7A.

Settler Peter Perry laid out village lots on the shore of Lake Scugog in 1848 on the site of a former native village known as Scugog Village. The townsite was named Port Perry in 1852 and its first Postmaster was Joseph Bigelow. It was incorporated as a village in 1871. At the time there was an intense rivalry between Port Perry and two nearby towns, Prince Albert and Manchester. Expecting great things for &quot;his&quot; town, Peter Perry predicted that goats would eat grass off of Prince Albert&#x27;s main street.

At the time, Prince Albert sat astride a planked toll road running south to Whitby. Grain and lumber from areas throughout the area south-east of Lake Simcoe fed through Prince Albert, which was a major grain trading area. Perry and others in Port Perry felt a railway was a much better option, and Perry&#x27;s prediction would eventually come true.

A group of local businessmen started the process of bringing the railway to the town in 1867, and the first train on the Port Whitby and Port Perry Railway reached the terminus in Port Perry in 1872. In the following year the grain elevator was built, still standing today as Canada&#x27;s oldest existing grain elevator. Cargo from all over northern Ontario was shipped via the Trent-Severn Waterway to Port Perry via Lake Scugog, and then via the railway to Whitby, where it could be loaded onto the CP or CN mainlines running along the shore of Lake Ontario, or onto ships in Port Whitby. Businesses quickly moved out of Prince Albert and moved to Port Perry, leaving Prince Albert effectively a suburb of Port Perry today. The Port Perry Granary still stands as a tall sentinel on the shores of Lake Scugog and proud of being Canada&#x27;s oldest grain elevator outlasting numerous fires and modern day demolition.

The village was amalgamated with Cartwright, Reach and Scugog Townships to form the Township of Scugog in 1974 upon the creation of the Regional Municipality of Durham.

An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected at the Scugog Shores Museum by the province to commemorate cartoonist Jimmy Frise&#x27;s role in Ontario&#x27;s heritage.

==Culture and recreation==

Port Perry&#x27;s Victorian-era downtown is a tourist destination, with clothing stores, restaurants, cafés, bookstores, galleries and antique shops. In the summer, the town features the festivals Mississauga First Nation Pow Wow, the Highland Games, the Dragon Boat Races and StreetFest. Port Perry is also home to the Theatre on The Ridge summer theatre festival featuring 6 shows performed at Townhall 1873 during July and August. Its annual fair, held every Labour Day weekend, has been running for over 150 years. There are also golf courses, both public and private. Other attractions in Port Perry and surrounding area include the Great Blue Heron Charity Casino, Scugog Memorial Library (featuring the Kent Farndale Art Gallery), the Scugog Shores Historical Museum and the Town Hall 1873 Centre for the Performing Arts.

At many local farms, visitors may pick their own seasonal fruit (strawberries, raspberries, apples). In the summer, bass tournaments and lakeside activities are also featured.

The Lake Scugog shoreline offers two popular lakeside parks, Palmer and Birdseye. There are active fishing seasons, both winter and summer. In the winter months, Lake Scugog is dotted with ice-fishing huts and is a destination for ice fishermen and snowmobilers.

===Scugog Community Recreation Centre===
The township of Scugog built the Scugog Community Recreation Centre in the late 1977 as a replacement for the old downtown arena. The original facility contained just one pad with 6 dressing rooms. In 1995 a community centre was built and In 2004 there was a second pad attached to the complex.

The Rec centre contains: 2 Ice Rinks, 2 seasonal floor pads in the summer, 3 meeting rooms, 1 banquet hall, 1 commercial kitchen and 2 multi purpose rec rooms. The centre also hosts the Scugog Sports Hall of Fame, and is the main hub for Camp Scugog.

The arena is home to North Durham Minor Hockey, the Central Ontario Wolves and the Port Perry Lumberjacks.

==In film==
Port Perry has attracted many film crews over the years, both for feature film and television; it doubled as the fictional Maine town of Mooseport in the 2004 film &quot;Welcome to Mooseport&quot; and was used briefly as a small town in New Hampshire during the sixth season of &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

The town was the primary production location for the 1996 film, &quot;Fly Away Home&quot;, based on Port Perry inventor Bill Lishman&#x27;s experiments in the 1980s and 1990s imprinting geese in order to alter and preserve migration routes. The film fictionalized Lishman&#x27;s personal life, but used him as a consultant for its aerial and technical production.

Port Perry is also used as exteriors for the TV series &quot;Hemlock Grove&quot; which is set in Western Pennsylvania.

American TV Series &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; (Season 1) was shot around Downtown Port Perry in 2020–2021. The town&#x27;s &quot;Piano Inn &amp; Cafe&quot; was changed into a &quot;JJ&#x27;s Ale House&quot; for the shoot.

Port Perry was used as a small town known as Lakeside for season three of the Amazon show &quot;American Gods (TV series)&quot;. They painted the shop portion of the Mill black, and the &quot;PORT PERRY&quot; wording at the top of the Old Mill was changed to &quot;LAKESIDE&quot; for the duration of filming.

Outdoor scenes of the movie Thanksgiving were filmed in downtown Port Perry.

<doc id="505867" wikidata="Q311395" url="?curid=505867" title="Glycine (plant)">
<text>Glycine is a genus in the bean family Fabaceae. The best known species is the cultivated soybean (&quot;Glycine max&quot;). While the majority of the species are found only in Australia, the soybean&#x27;s native range is in East Asia. A few species extend from Australia to East Asia (e.g., &quot;G. tomentella&quot; and &quot;G. tabacina&quot;).
&quot;Glycine&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species: the engrailed, nutmeg and turnip moths have all been recorded on soybean.

==Taxonomy==
The genus name &quot;Glycine&quot; has had a tangled taxonomic history. It was first introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Linnaeus listed eight species. The first was &quot;Glycine apios&quot;, for which he gave the pre-Linnaean synonym &quot;Apios americana&quot;. The genus name is derived from the Greek &quot;glykys&quot;, meaning &#x27;sweet&#x27;. Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Glycine apios&quot;, now accepted as &quot;Apios americana&quot;, has edible roots, which were used as food by Native Americans in the United States. In 1966, Bernard Verdcourt discovered that the designated type species of Linnaeus&#x27;s genus, &quot;Glycine javanica&quot;, was actually a member of the genus &quot;Pueraria&quot; with an abnormal inflorescence. Linnaeus&#x27;s eight species are now placed in seven genera other than &quot;Glycine&quot;. Verdcourt proposed that since Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Glycine&quot; was so confused, the genus should instead be based on the species &quot;Glycine clandestina&quot;, first described by Carl Ludwig Willdenow in 1802. The proposal was agreed in 1978, and &quot;Glycine&quot; is a rejected name in favour of the conserved name &quot;Glycine&quot; A consequence of the changes is that the justification for the genus name no longer exists, since none of the species with edible roots are now placed in &quot;Glycine&quot;.

, Plants of the World Online accepted 28 species.

<text>Kate Wilhelm (June 8, 1928 – March 8, 2018) was an American author. She wrote novels and stories in the science fiction, mystery, and suspense genres, including the Hugo Award–winning &quot;Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang&quot;. Wilhelm established the Clarion Workshop along with her husband Damon Knight and writer Robin Scott Wilson.

==Life==
Katie Gertrude Meredith was born in Toledo, Ohio, daughter of Jesse and Ann Meredith. She graduated from high school in Louisville, Kentucky, and worked as a model, telephone operator, sales clerk, switchboard operator, and underwriter for an insurance company.

She married Joseph Wilhelm in 1947 and had two sons. The couple divorced in 1962 and Wilhelm married Damon Knight in 1963. She and her husband lived in Eugene, Oregon, until his death in 2002 and she remained there until her own death in 2018.

==Career==
Her first published short fiction was &quot;The Pint-Size Genie&quot; in the October 1956 issue of &quot;Fantastic&quot;, edited by Paul W. Fairman (assisted by Cele Goldsmith, who was responsible for looking at unsolicited submissions to the magazine). The next year, her first accepted story, &quot;The Mile-Long Spaceship&quot;, was published in John W. Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, and ten of her speculative fiction stories were published during 1958 and 1959. Her debut novel was a murder mystery, &quot;More Bitter Than Death&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1963), and her science fiction novel debut, &quot;The Clone&quot; (1965) co-written with Theodore L. Thomas, was a finalist for the annual Nebula Award.

Her work has been published in &quot;Quark/&quot;, &quot;Orbit&quot;, &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Locus&quot;, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, &quot;Fantastic&quot;, &quot;Omni&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;.

She and her second husband, Damon Knight, mentored many authors and helped to establish the Clarion Writers Workshop and the Milford Writer&#x27;s Workshop. After his death in 2002, Wilhelm continued to host monthly workshops, as well as lecturing at other events, until her death.

==Recognition==

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Wilhelm in 2003, its eighth class of two deceased and two living writers.

In 2009, she received one of three inaugural Solstice Awards from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (founded by Knight in 1965), which recognize &quot;significant impact on the science fiction or fantasy landscape&quot;.

The Nebula Award trophy was designed for the first awards by J. A. Lawrence, based on a sketch by Wilhelm.

She also won a few annual genre awards for particular works:

* Nebula Award for Best Short Story, 1968, &quot;The Planners&quot;
* Hugo Award for Best Novel and Locus Award for Best Novel, both 1977, &quot;Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang&quot;
* Nebula Award for Best Novelette, 1986, &quot;The Girl Who Fell into the Sky&quot;
* Nebula Award for Best Short Story, 1987, &quot;Forever Yours, Anna&quot;
* Hugo Award (best related book) and Locus Award (best nonfiction), both 2006, &quot;Storyteller: Writing Lessons and More from 27 Years of the Clarion Writers&#x27; Workshop&quot; (Small Beer Press, 2005; )

The Hugo- and Locus Award-winning novel &quot;Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang&quot; was also a finalist for the Nebula Award, winner of the short-lived Jupiter Award from science fiction instructors, and third place for the academic John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.

In 2016, the SFWA renamed the Solstice Award the Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award.

<text>The lactose&quot; operon(lac&quot; operon) is an operon required for the transport and metabolism of lactose in &quot;E. coli&quot; and many other enteric bacteria. Although glucose is the preferred carbon source for most enteric bacteria, the &quot;lac&quot; operon allows for the effective digestion of lactose when glucose is not available through the activity of β-galactosidase. Gene regulation of the &quot;lac&quot; operon was the first genetic regulatory mechanism to be understood clearly, so it has become a foremost example of prokaryotic gene regulation. It is often discussed in introductory molecular and cellular biology classes for this reason. This lactose metabolism system was used by François Jacob and Jacques Monod to determine how a biological cell knows which enzyme to synthesize. Their work on the &quot;lac&quot; operon won them the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 1965.

Most bacterial cells including &quot;E. coli&quot; lack introns in their genome. They also lack a nuclear membrane. Hence the gene regulation by &quot;lac&quot; operon occurs at the transcriptional level, by controlling transcription of DNA. 

Bacterial operons are polycistronic transcripts that are able to produce multiple proteins from one mRNA transcript. In this case, when lactose is required as a sugar source for the bacterium, the three genes of the &quot;lac&quot; operon can be transcribed and their subsequent proteins translated: &quot;lacZ&quot;, &quot;lacY&quot;, and &quot;lacA&quot;. The gene product of &quot;lacZ&quot; is β-galactosidase which cleaves lactose, a disaccharide, into glucose and galactose. &quot;lacY&quot; encodes β-galactoside permease, a membrane protein which becomes embedded in the Plasma membrane to enable the cellular transport of lactose into the cell. Finally, &quot;lacA&quot; encodes β-galactoside transacetylase. 


Note that the number of base pairs in diagram given above are not to scale. There are in fact over 5300 base pairs in the &quot;lac&quot; operon. 

It would be wasteful to produce enzymes when no lactose is available or if a preferable energy source such as glucose were available. The &quot;lac&quot; operon uses a two-part control mechanism to ensure that the cell expends energy producing the enzymes encoded by the &quot;lac&quot; operon only when necessary. 

In the absence of lactose, the &quot;lac&quot; repressor, encoded by &quot;lacI,&quot; halts production of the enzymes and transport proteins encoded by the &quot;lac&quot; operon. It does so by blocking the DNA dependent RNA polymerase. This blocking/ halting is not perfect, and a minimal amount of gene expression does take place all the time. The repressor protein is always expressed, but the &quot;lac&quot; operon (i.e. enzymes and transport proteins) are almost completely repressed, allowing for a small level of background expression. If this weren&#x27;t the case, there would be no lacY transporter protein in the cellular membrane; consequently, the &quot;lac&quot; operon would not be able to detect the presence of lactose.

When lactose is available but not glucose, then some lactose enters the cell using pre-existing transport protein encoded by lacY. This lactose then combines with the repressor and inactivates it, hence allowing the &quot;lac&quot; operon to be expressed. Then more β-galactoside permease is synthesized allowing even more lactose to enter and the enzymes encoded by lacZ and lacA can digest it. 

However, in the presence of glucose, regardless of the presence of lactose, the operon will be repressed. This is because the catabolite activator protein (CAP), required for production of the enzymes, remains inactive, and EIIAGlc shuts down lactose permease to prevent transport of lactose into the cell. This dual control mechanism causes the sequential utilization of glucose and lactose in two distinct growth phases, known as diauxie.

== Structure ==

*The &quot;lac&quot; operon consists of 3 structural genes, and a promoter, a terminator, regulator, and an operator. The three structural genes are: &quot;lacZ&quot;, &quot;lacY&quot;, and &quot;lacA&quot;.
**&quot;lacZ&quot; encodes β-galactosidase (LacZ), an intracellular enzyme that cleaves the disaccharide lactose into glucose and galactose.
** &quot;lacY&quot; encodes β-galactoside permease (LacY), a transmembrane symporter that pumps β-galactosides including lactose into the cell using a proton gradient in the same direction. Permease increases the permeability of the cell to β-galactosides.
** &quot;lacA&quot; encodes β-galactoside transacetylase (LacA), an enzyme that transfers an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to thiogalactoside.

Only &quot;lacZ&quot; and &quot;lacY&quot; appear to be necessary for lactose catabolic pathway.

By numbers, &quot;lacI&quot; has 1100 bps, &quot;lacZ&quot; has 3000 bps, &quot;lacY&quot; has 800 bps, &quot;lacA&quot; has 800 bps, with 3 bps corresponding to 1 amino acid.

===Genetic nomenclature===
Three-letter abbreviations are used to describe phenotypes in bacteria including &quot;E. coli&quot;.

Examples include:
* Lac (the ability to use lactose),
* His (the ability to synthesize the amino acid histidine)
* Mot (swimming motility)
* SmR (resistance to the antibiotic streptomycin)

In the case of Lac, wild type cells are Lac+ and are able to use lactose as a carbon and energy source, while Lac− mutant derivatives cannot use lactose. The same three letters are typically used (lower-case, italicized) to label the genes involved in a particular phenotype, where each different gene is additionally distinguished by an extra letter. The &quot;lac&quot; genes encoding enzymes are &quot;lacZ&quot;, &quot;lacY&quot;, and &quot;lacA&quot;. The fourth &quot;lac&quot; gene is &quot;lacI&quot;, encoding the lactose repressor—&quot;I&quot; stands for &quot;inducibility&quot;.

One may distinguish between &quot;structural&quot; genes encoding enzymes, and regulatory genes encoding proteins that affect gene expression. Current usage expands the phenotypic nomenclature to apply to proteins: thus, LacZ is the protein product of the &quot;lacZ&quot; gene, β-galactosidase. Various short sequences that are not genes also affect gene expression, including the &quot;lac&quot; promoter, &quot;lac p&quot;, and the &quot;lac&quot; operator, &quot;lac o&quot;. Although it is not strictly standard usage, mutations affecting &quot;lac o&quot; are referred to as &quot;lac o&quot;c, for historical reasons.

==Regulation==
Specific control of the &quot;lac&quot; genes depends on the availability of the substrate lactose to the bacterium. The proteins are not produced by the bacterium when lactose is unavailable as a carbon source.
The &quot;lac&quot; genes are organized into an operon; that is, they are oriented in the same direction immediately adjacent on the chromosome and are co-transcribed into a single polycistronic mRNA molecule. Transcription of all genes starts with the binding of the enzyme RNA polymerase (RNAP), a DNA-binding protein, which binds to a specific DNA binding site, the promoter, immediately upstream of the genes. Binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter is aided by the cAMP-bound catabolite activator protein (CAP, also known as the cAMP receptor protein). However, the &quot;lacI&quot; gene (regulatory gene for &quot;lac&quot; operon) produces a protein that blocks RNAP from binding to the operator of the operon. This protein can only be removed when allolactose binds to it, and inactivates it. The protein that is formed by the &quot;lacI&quot; gene is known as the lac repressor. The type of regulation that the &quot;lac&quot; operon undergoes is referred to as negative inducible, meaning that the gene is turned off by the regulatory factor (&quot;lac&quot; repressor) unless some molecule (lactose) is added. Once the repressor is removed, RNAP then proceeds to transcribe all three genes (&quot;lacZYA&quot;) into mRNA. Each of the three genes on the mRNA strand has its own Shine-Dalgarno sequence, so the genes are independently translated. The DNA sequence of the &quot;E. coli&quot; &quot;lac&quot; operon, the &quot;lacZYA&quot; mRNA, and the &quot;lacI &quot; genes are available from GenBank (view).

The first control mechanism is the regulatory response to lactose, which uses an intracellular &quot;regulatory protein&quot; called the &quot;lactose repressor&quot; to hinder production of β-galactosidase in the absence of lactose. The &quot;lacI&quot; gene coding for the repressor lies nearby the &quot;lac&quot; operon and is always expressed (&quot;constitutive&quot;). If lactose is missing from the growth medium, the repressor binds very tightly to a short DNA sequence just downstream of the promoter near the beginning of &quot;lacZ&quot; called the &quot;lac operator&quot;. The repressor binding to the operator interferes with binding of RNAP to the promoter, and therefore mRNA encoding LacZ and LacY is only made at very low levels. When cells are grown in the presence of lactose, however, a lactose metabolite called allolactose, made from lactose by the product of the &quot;lacZ&quot; gene, binds to the repressor, causing an allosteric shift. Thus altered, the repressor is unable to bind to the operator, allowing RNAP to transcribe the &quot;lac&quot; genes and thereby leading to higher levels of the encoded proteins.

The second control mechanism is a response to glucose, which uses the catabolite activator protein (CAP) homodimer to greatly increase production of β-galactosidase in the absence of glucose. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a signal molecule whose prevalence is inversely proportional to that of glucose. It binds to the CAP, which in turn allows the CAP to bind to the CAP binding site (a 16 bp DNA sequence upstream of the promoter on the left in the diagram below, about 60 bp upstream of the transcription start site), which assists the RNAP in binding to the DNA. In the absence of glucose, the cAMP concentration is high and binding of CAP-cAMP to the DNA significantly increases the production of β-galactosidase, enabling the cell to hydrolyse lactose and release galactose and glucose.

More recently inducer exclusion was shown to block expression of the &quot;lac&quot; operon when glucose is present. Glucose is transported into the cell by the PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system. The phosphate group of phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred via a phosphorylation cascade consisting of the general PTS (phosphotransferase system) proteins HPr and EIA and the glucose-specific PTS proteins EIIAGlc and EIIBGlc, the cytoplasmic domain of the EII glucose transporter. Transport of glucose is accompanied by its phosphorylation by EIIBGlc, draining the phosphate group from the other PTS proteins, including EIIAGlc. The unphosphorylated form of EIIAGlc binds to the &quot;lac&quot; permease and prevents it from bringing lactose into the cell. Therefore, if both glucose and lactose are present, the transport of glucose blocks the transport of the inducer of the &quot;lac&quot; operon.

===Repressor structure===
The lac repressor is a four-part protein, a tetramer, with identical subunits. Each subunit contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif capable of binding to DNA. The operator site where repressor binds is a DNA sequence with inverted repeat symmetry. The two DNA half-sites of the operator together bind to two of the subunits of the repressor. Although the other two subunits of repressor are not doing anything in this model, this property was not understood for many years.

Eventually it was discovered that two additional operators are involved in &quot;lac&quot; regulation. One (O3) lies about −90 bp upstream of O1 in the end of the &quot;lacI&quot; gene, and the other (O2) is about +410 bp downstream of O1 in the early part of &quot;lacZ&quot;. These two sites were not found in the early work because they have redundant functions and individual mutations do not affect repression very much. Single mutations to either O2 or O3 have only 2 to 3-fold effects. However, their importance is demonstrated by the fact that a double mutant defective in both O2 and O3 is dramatically de-repressed (by about 70-fold).

In the current model, &quot;lac&quot; repressor is bound simultaneously to both the main operator O1 and to either O2 or O3. The intervening DNA loops out from the complex. The redundant nature of the two minor operators suggests that it is not a specific looped complex that is important. One idea is that the system works through tethering; if bound repressor releases from O1 momentarily, binding to a minor operator keeps it in the vicinity, so that it may rebind quickly. This would increase the affinity of repressor for O1.

====Mechanism of induction====
The repressor is an allosteric protein, i.e. it can assume either one of two slightly different shapes, which are in equilibrium with each other. In one form the repressor will bind to the operator DNA with high specificity, and in the other form it has lost its specificity. According to the classical model of induction, binding of the inducer, either allolactose or IPTG, to the repressor affects the distribution of repressor between the two shapes. Thus, repressor with inducer bound is stabilized in the non-DNA-binding conformation. However, this simple model cannot be the whole story, because repressor is bound quite stably to DNA, yet it is released rapidly by addition of inducer. Therefore, it seems clear that an inducer can also bind to the repressor when the repressor is already bound to DNA. It is still not entirely known what the exact mechanism of binding is.

====Role of non-specific binding====

Non-specific binding of the repressor to DNA plays a crucial role in the repression and induction of the Lac-operon. The specific binding site for the Lac-repressor protein is the operator. The non-specific interaction is mediated mainly by charge-charge interactions while binding to the operator is reinforced by hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, there is an abundance of non-specific DNA sequences to which the repressor can bind. Essentially, any sequence that is not the operator, is considered non-specific. Studies have shown, that without the presence of non-specific binding, induction (or unrepression) of the Lac-operon could not occur even with saturated levels of inducer. It had been demonstrated that, without non-specific binding, the basal level of induction is ten thousand times smaller than observed normally. This is because the non-specific DNA acts as sort of a &quot;sink&quot; for the repressor proteins, distracting them from the operator. The non-specific sequences decrease the amount of available repressor in the cell. This in turn reduces the amount of inducer required to unrepress the system.

===Lactose analogs===

A number of lactose derivatives or analogs have been described that are useful for work with the &quot;lac&quot; operon. These compounds are mainly substituted galactosides, where the glucose moiety of lactose is replaced by another chemical group.

* Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is frequently used as an inducer of the &quot;lac&quot; operon for physiological work. IPTG binds to repressor and inactivates it, but is not a substrate for β-galactosidase. One advantage of IPTG for &quot;in vivo&quot; studies is that since it cannot be metabolized by &quot;E. coli&quot;. Its concentration remains constant and the rate of expression of &quot;lac p/o&quot;-controlled genes is not a variable in the experiment. IPTG intake is dependent on the action of lactose permease in &quot;P. fluorescens&quot;, but not in &quot;E. coli&quot;.
* Phenyl-β-D-galactose (phenyl-Gal) is a substrate for β-galactosidase, but does not inactivate repressor and so is not an inducer. Since wild type cells produce very little β-galactosidase, they cannot grow on phenyl-Gal as a carbon and energy source. Mutants lacking repressor are able to grow on phenyl-Gal. Thus, minimal medium containing only phenyl-Gal as a source of carbon and energy is selective for repressor mutants and operator mutants. If 108 cells of a wild type strain are plated on agar plates containing phenyl-Gal, the rare colonies which grow are mainly spontaneous mutants affecting the repressor. The relative distribution of repressor and operator mutants is affected by the target size. Since the &quot;lacI gene&quot; encoding repressor is about 50 times larger than the operator, repressor mutants predominate in the selection.
* Thiomethyl galactoside [TMG] is another lactose analog. These inhibit the lacI repressor. At low inducer concentrations, both TMG and IPTG can enter the cell through the lactose permease. However at high inducer concentrations, both analogs can enter the cell independently. TMG can reduce growth rates at high extracellular concentrations.
* Other compounds serve as colorful indicators of β-galactosidase activity.
** ONPG is cleaved to produce the intensely yellow compound, orthonitrophenol and galactose, and is commonly used as a substrate for assay of β-galactosidase &quot;in vitro&quot;. 
** Colonies that produce β-galactosidase are turned blue by X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside) which is an artificial substrate for B-galactosidase whose cleavage results in galactose and 4-Cl,3-Br indigo thus producing a deep blue color.
* Allolactose is an isomer of lactose and is the inducer of the &quot;lac&quot; operon. Lactose is galactose-β(1→4)-glucose, whereas allolactose is galactose-β(1→6)-glucose. Lactose is converted to allolactose by β-galactosidase in an alternative reaction to the hydrolytic one. A physiological experiment which demonstrates the role of LacZ in production of the &quot;true&quot; inducer in &quot;E. coli&quot; cells is the observation that a null mutant of &quot;lacZ&quot; can still produce LacY permease when grown with IPTG, a non-hydrolyzable analog of allolactose, but not when grown with lactose. The explanation is that processing of lactose to allolactose (catalyzed by β-galactosidase) is needed to produce the inducer inside the cell.

==Development of the classic model==

The experimental microorganism used by François Jacob and Jacques Monod was the common laboratory bacterium, &quot;E. coli&quot;, but many of the basic regulatory concepts that were discovered by Jacob and Monod are fundamental to cellular regulation in all organisms. The key idea is that proteins are not synthesized when they are not needed—&quot;E. coli&quot; conserves cellular resources and energy by not making the three Lac proteins when there is no need to metabolize lactose, such as when other sugars like glucose are available. The following section discusses how &quot;E. coli&quot; controls certain genes in response to metabolic needs.

During World War II, Monod was testing the effects of combinations of sugars as nutrient sources for &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;B. subtilis&quot;. Monod was following up on similar studies that had been conducted by other scientists with bacteria and yeast. He found that bacteria grown with two different sugars often displayed two phases of growth. For example, if glucose and lactose were both provided, glucose was metabolized first (growth phase I, see Figure 2) and then lactose (growth phase II). Lactose was not metabolized during the first part of the diauxic growth curve because β-galactosidase was not made when both glucose and lactose were present in the medium. Monod named this phenomenon diauxie.

Monod then focused his attention on the induction of β-galactosidase formation that occurred when lactose was the sole sugar in the culture medium.

===Classification of regulatory mutants===

A conceptual breakthrough of Jacob and Monod was to recognize the distinction between regulatory substances and sites where they act to change gene expression. A former soldier, Jacob used the analogy of a bomber that would release its lethal cargo upon receipt of a special radio transmission or signal. A working system requires both a ground transmitter and a receiver in the airplane. Now, suppose that the usual transmitter is broken. This system can be made to work by introduction of a second, functional transmitter. In contrast, he said, consider a bomber with a defective receiver. The behavior of &quot;this&quot; bomber cannot be changed by introduction of a second, functional aeroplane.

To analyze regulatory mutants of the &quot;lac&quot; operon, Jacob developed a system by which a second copy of the &quot;lac&quot; genes (&quot;lacI&quot; with its promoter, and &quot;lacZYA&quot; with promoter and operator) could be introduced into a single cell. A culture of such bacteria, which are diploid for the &quot;lac&quot; genes but otherwise normal, is then tested for the regulatory phenotype. In particular, it is determined whether LacZ and LacY are made even in the absence of IPTG (due to the &quot;lactose repressor&quot; produced by the mutant gene being non-functional). This experiment, in which genes or gene clusters are tested pairwise, is called a &quot;complementation test&quot;.
This test is illustrated in the figure (&quot;lacA&quot; is omitted for simplicity). First, certain haploid states are shown (i.e. the cell carries only a single copy of the &quot;lac&quot; genes). Panel (a) shows repression, (b) shows induction by IPTG, and (c) and (d) show the effect of a mutation to the &quot;lacI&quot; gene or to the operator, respectively. In panel (e) the complementation test for repressor is shown. If one copy of the &quot;lac&quot; genes carries a mutation in &quot;lacI&quot;, but the second copy is wild type for &quot;lacI&quot;, the resulting phenotype is normal—but lacZ is expressed when exposed to inducer IPTG. Mutations affecting repressor are said to be &quot;recessive&quot; to wild type (and that wild type is &quot;dominant&quot;), and this is explained by the fact that repressor is a small protein which can diffuse in the cell. The copy of the &quot;lac&quot; operon adjacent to the defective &quot;lacI&quot; gene is effectively shut off by protein produced from the second copy of &quot;lacI&quot;.

If the same experiment is carried out using an operator mutation, a different result is obtained (panel (f)). The phenotype of a cell carrying one mutant and one wild type operator site is that LacZ and LacY are produced even in the absence of the inducer IPTG; because the damaged operator site, does not permit binding of the repressor to inhibit transcription of the structural genes. The operator mutation is dominant. When the operator site where repressor must bind is damaged by mutation, the presence of a second functional site in the same cell makes no difference to expression of genes controlled by the mutant site.

A more sophisticated version of this experiment uses &quot;marked&quot; operons to distinguish between the two copies of the &quot;lac&quot; genes and show that the unregulated structural gene(s) is(are) the one(s) next to the mutant operator (panel (g). For example, suppose that one copy is marked by a mutation inactivating &quot;lacZ&quot; so that it can only produce the LacY protein, while the second copy carries a mutation affecting &quot;lacY&quot; and can only produce LacZ. In this version, only the copy of the &quot;lac&quot; operon that is adjacent to the mutant operator is expressed without IPTG. We say that the operator mutation is &quot;cis-dominant&quot;, it is dominant to wild type but affects only the copy of the operon which is immediately adjacent to it.

This explanation is misleading in an important sense, because it proceeds from a description of the experiment and then explains the results in terms of a model. But in fact, it is often true that the model comes first, and an experiment is fashioned specifically to test the model. Jacob and Monod first imagined that there must be a &quot;site&quot; in DNA with the properties of the operator, and then designed their complementation tests to show this.

The dominance of operator mutants also suggests a procedure to select them specifically. If regulatory mutants are selected from a culture of wild type using phenyl-Gal, as described above, operator mutations are rare compared to repressor mutants because the target-size is so small. But if instead we start with a strain which carries two copies of the whole &quot;lac&quot; region (that is diploid for &quot;lac&quot;), the repressor mutations (which still occur) are not recovered because complementation by the second, wild type &quot;lacI&quot; gene confers a wild type phenotype. In contrast, mutation of one copy of the operator confers a mutant phenotype because it is dominant to the second, wild type copy.

===Regulation by cyclic AMP===
Source:

Explanation of diauxie depended on the characterization of additional mutations affecting the &quot;lac&quot; genes other than those explained by the classical model. Two other genes, &quot;cya&quot; and &quot;crp&quot;, subsequently were identified that mapped far from &quot;lac&quot;, and that, when mutated, result in a decreased level of expression in the &quot;presence&quot; of IPTG and even in strains of the bacterium lacking the repressor or operator. The discovery of cAMP in &quot;E. coli&quot; led to the demonstration that mutants defective the &quot;cya&quot; gene but not the &quot;crp&quot; gene could be restored to full activity by the addition of cAMP to the medium.

The &quot;cya&quot; gene encodes adenylate cyclase, which produces cAMP. In a &quot;cya&quot; mutant, the absence of cAMP makes the expression of the &quot;lacZYA&quot; genes more than ten times lower than normal. Addition of cAMP corrects the low Lac expression characteristic of &quot;cya&quot; mutants. The second gene, &quot;crp&quot;, encodes a protein called catabolite activator protein (CAP) or cAMP receptor protein (CRP).

However the lactose metabolism enzymes are made in small quantities in the presence of both glucose and lactose (sometimes called leaky expression) due to the fact that the RNAP can still sometimes bind and initiate transcription even in the absence of CAP. Leaky expression is necessary in order to allow for metabolism of some lactose after the glucose source is expended, but before &quot;lac&quot; expression is fully activated.

In summary:

* When lactose is absent then there is very little Lac enzyme production (the operator has Lac repressor bound to it).
* When lactose is present but a preferred carbon source (like glucose) is also present then a small amount of enzyme is produced (Lac repressor is not bound to the operator).
* When glucose is absent, CAP-cAMP binds to a specific DNA site upstream of the promoter and makes a direct protein-protein interaction with RNAP that facilitates the binding of RNAP to the promoter.

The delay between growth phases reflects the time needed to produce sufficient quantities of lactose-metabolizing enzymes. First, the CAP regulatory protein has to assemble on the &quot;lac&quot; promoter, resulting in an increase in the production of &quot;lac&quot; mRNA. More available copies of the &quot;lac&quot; mRNA results in the production (see translation) of significantly more copies of LacZ (β-galactosidase, for lactose metabolism) and LacY (lactose permease to transport lactose into the cell). After a delay needed to increase the level of the lactose metabolizing enzymes, the bacteria enter into a new rapid phase of cell growth.

Two puzzles of catabolite repression relate to how cAMP levels are coupled to the presence of glucose, and secondly, why the cells should even bother. After lactose is cleaved it actually forms glucose and galactose (easily converted to glucose). In metabolic terms, lactose is just as &quot;good&quot; a carbon and energy source as glucose. The cAMP level is related not to intracellular glucose concentration but to the rate of glucose transport, which influences the activity of adenylate cyclase. (In addition, glucose transport also leads to direct inhibition of the lactose permease.) As to why &quot;E. coli&quot; works this way, one can only speculate. All enteric bacteria ferment glucose, which suggests they encounter it frequently. It is possible that a small difference in efficiency of transport or metabolism of glucose v. lactose makes it advantageous for cells to regulate the &quot;lac&quot; operon in this way.

==Use in molecular biology==

The &quot;lac&quot; gene and its derivatives are amenable to use as a reporter gene in a number of bacterial-based selection techniques such as two hybrid analysis, in which the successful binding of a transcriptional activator to a specific promoter sequence must be determined. In LB plates containing X-gal, the colour change from white colonies to a shade of blue corresponds to about 20–100 β-galactosidase units, while tetrazolium lactose and MacConkey lactose media have a range of 100–1000 units, being most sensitive in the high and low parts of this range respectively. Since MacConkey lactose and tetrazolium lactose media both rely on the products of lactose breakdown, they require the presence of both &quot;lacZ&quot; and &quot;lacY&quot; genes. The many &quot;lac&quot; fusion techniques which include only the &quot;lacZ&quot; gene are thus suited to X-gal plates or ONPG liquid broths.

<text>The Ohio Country (Ohio Territory, Ohio Valley) was a name used for a loosely defined region of colonial North America west of the Appalachian Mountains and south of Lake Erie.

Control of the territory and the region&#x27;s fur trade was disputed in the 17th century by the Iroquois, Huron, Algonquin, other Native American tribes, and France. New France claimed this area as part of the administrative district of La Louisiane. France and Britain fought the French and Indian War over this area in the mid-18th century as the North American front of their Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763). Following the British victory, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to the British Empire in the 1763 Treaty of Paris.

During the following decades, several minor frontier wars, including Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion and Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War, were fought in the territory. In 1783, the Ohio Country became unorganized U.S. territory under the Treaty of Paris that officially ended the American Revolutionary War and became one of the first American frontier regions of the United States. Several of the original U.S. states had overlapping claims to portions of it, based on historical royal and colonial charters. The states&#x27; claims were largely extinguished after negotiations with the federal government by 1787, and it became part of the larger, organized Territory Northwest of the River Ohio. Most of the former areas north-west of the Ohio River were eventually organized as the state of Ohio, admitted to the Union in 1803.

==History==
===Pre-colonial period===

In the 17th century, the area north of the Ohio River was occupied by the Algonquian-speaking Shawnee and some Siouan language-speaking tribes, such as the Omaha and Ponca. Around 1660, during a conflict known as the Beaver Wars, the Iroquois and allied tribes seized control of the Ohio Country, driving out the Shawnee and Siouan peoples. Those tribes mostly moved further northwest and west, with several eventually settling west of the Mississippi River. In the east, the Iroquois (or &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;) conquered and absorbed the Erie (who also spoke an Iroquoian language) during this time. The Ohio Country, however, remained largely uninhabited for decades, used primarily as a hunting ground by the Iroquois peoples.

In the 1720s, a number of Native American groups began to migrate into the Ohio Country from the east, driven by pressure from encroaching European colonists. By 1724, Delaware Indians had established the village of Kittanning on the Allegheny River in present-day western Pennsylvania. With them came those Shawnee who had historically expanded further to the east. Other eastern bands of the scattered Shawnee tribe began to return to the Ohio Country in the decades that followed. A number of Seneca and other Iroquois peoples also migrated to the Ohio Country, moving away from the Anglo-French rivalries and warfare south of Lake Ontario. The Seneca were the westernmost of the original Five Nations of the Iroquois centered in western New York. In 1722, the Tuscarora, an Iroquoian-speaking tribe from the Carolinas, completed a migration to the area and were allowed to settle near the lands of the Oneida. They were considered cousins to the Iroquois and became the sixth nation in the confederacy.

===Colonial period===

In the late 1740s and the second half of the 18th century, the British and French angled for control of the territory. The English intended to gain control of the area by sheer number of settlers on the ground. In 1749, The Crown through the government of the Colony of Virginia granted the Ohio Company a beneficial deal on this territory on the condition that it be settled by colonists from the Thirteen Colonies.

====French and Indian War====

With the arrival of Europeans to America, both Great Britain and France had claimed the territory and sent fur traders into the area to do business with the Ohio Country Indians. The Iroquois League also claimed the region by right of conquest. The rivalry among the two European nations, the Iroquois nations, and the Ohio valley Indian tribes for control of the region played an important part in the French and Indian War that lasted from 1754 through 1760. Having initially remained neutral, eventually the Ohio Country Indians largely sided with the French who were more interested in hunting in the region and were not actively settling the area as was their British colonial rivals. Armed with supplies and guns from the French, the Indians launched raids against their enemies via the Kittanning Path east of the Alleghenies. After they destroyed Fort Granville in the summer of 1756, Pennsylvania&#x27;s Proprietary Governor John Penn ordered Captain John Armstrong to destroy the Shawnee villages west of the Alleghenies, hoping to put an end to their raiding activities. Meanwhile, other British and colonial forces drove the French from Fort Duquesne. They built Fort Pitt at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers that form the Ohio River. After being defeated by Britain, France ceded their claims to the entire Ohio Country in the 1763 Treaty of Paris. They had done so, however, without consulting their Native American allies who—in many cases—continued the fight against the colonial frontiersmen.

Colonies such as Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York, and Connecticut claimed some of the westward lands as had been granted by their original charters. The area, however, was officially closed to European settlement by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, an attempt to preserve the western lands as territory exclusively set aside for use by Native American peoples. By enacting the treaty, the British Crown no longer recognized prior claims that the colonies made on this territory. On June 22, 1774, Parliament in England passed the Quebec Act, which annexed the region to the Province of Quebec. Colonists in the Thirteen Colonies considered this one of the Intolerable Acts that contributed to the call for American Revolution the following year, which began in earnest the following year, in 1775.

===American Revolution and afterward===

Despite the Crown&#x27;s actions limiting westward expansion, frontiersmen from the Virginia and Pennsylvania colonies had migrated across the Allegheny Mountains for over a decade since the Proclamation. This eventually led them into conflict with the Shawnee tribes that claimed the area as their hunting grounds. The Shawnee, who referred to the settlers as the &#x27;long knives&#x27;, viewed the colonists as competitors to their resources and a threat to their way of life. Because of this, the Shawnee and other Indian tribes of the Ohio Country, chose to side with the British against the American colonists during the American Revolutionary War. They hoped to expel the colonists permanently from their lands.

In 1778, after several Patriot military victories in the region by an expeditionary force led by General George Rogers Clark, the Virginia legislature organized a nominal civil government over the area. They called this first official territory Illinois County, Virginia. It encompassed all of the lands lying west and north of the Ohio River to which Virginia had previously laid claim.

The high water mark of the Native American struggle to retain control of the region was in 1782, when the Ohio Valley Indian Nations met with the British in a war council at &quot;Chalawgatha&quot;, a Shawnee village located along the Little Miami River, where they planned what was to become a successful rout of the Americans two weeks later at the Battle of Blue Licks. In 1783, following the Treaty of Paris in which America had gained its independence, Britain ceded its claims over the area to the new United States. The new federal government immediately opened this area to settlement by American pioneers, considering it unorganized territory. The Ohio Country quickly became one of the most desirable locations for Trans-Appalachian settlements, in particular among veterans of the Revolutionary War, who were often granted land in lieu of pay for their military service during the war.

In the treaties of Fort Stanwix (late 1784) and Fort McIntosh (early 1785), the United States fixed boundaries between territory open to settlement and the native tribal lands. The Shawnee and other tribes, however, continued to resist American encroachment into their historic hunting grounds. This resistance eventually led to the Northwest Indian War.

==States&#x27; claims==

Considered highly desirable, the area was subject to the overlapping and conflicting territorial ambitions of several eastern states:
* Connecticut claimed a strip of land across the northern part of the region, delineated by the westward extension of its northern and southern state boundaries, called the Connecticut Western Reserve.
* New York claimed an elastic part of the region based on its perceived sovereignty over the Iroquois, though the majority of the four tribes, allies of the British, resettled in Upper Quebec and Ontario).
* Pennsylvania claimed land as a westward extension of its colonial boundaries.
* Virginia, claimed the entire region and more, originally based on the charter of the Virginia Colony. It later claimed Illinois County by right of conquest.

==Incorporation of the Northwest Territory==

After negotiation with the federal government, these states ceded their claims to the United States between 1780 and 1786. In July 1787, most of Ohio Country, the southern peninsula of what is today the state of Michigan, and eastern Illinois Country were incorporated as the Territory Northwest of the River Ohio. In 1803, most of what was formerly Ohio Country north and west of the Ohio River was admitted to the union as the state of Ohio.

<text>The Parliament of Malaysia (; Jawi: ) is the national legislature of Malaysia, based on the Westminster system. The bicameral parliament consists of the Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives, lit. &quot;People&#x27;s Assembly&quot;) and the Dewan Negara (Senate, lit. &quot;State Assembly&quot;). The Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King), as the head of state, is the third component of Parliament.

The Parliament assembles in the Malaysian Houses of Parliament, located in the national capital city of Kuala Lumpur.

The term &quot;Member of Parliament (MP)&quot; usually refers to a member of the Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of the Parliament. The term &quot;Senator&quot; usually refers to a member of the Dewan Negara, the upper house of the Parliament.

== History ==
=== Colonial and the Federation of Malaya ===
Historically, none of the states forming the Federation of Malaysia had parliaments before independence, save for Sarawak which had its own Council Negeri which enabled local participation and representation in administrative work since 1863. Although the British colonial government had permitted the forming of legislative councils for Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak, these were not the supreme makers of law, and remained subordinate to the British High Commissioner or the Rajah, in case of Sarawak.

The Reid Commission, which drafted the Constitution of Malaya — Malaya gained independence in 1957, ahead of the other states that would later form Malaysia – modelled the Malayan system of government after the British system: a bicameral parliament, with one house being directly elected, and the other having limited powers with some members being appointed by the King, as is the case with the British House of Commons and House of Lords. In line with the federal nature of the new country, the upper house would also have members elected by state legislative assemblies in addition to members appointed by the King.

The Constitution provided for the pre-independence Federal Legislative Council to continue to sit as the legislative body of the new country until 1959, when the first post-independence general election were held and the first Parliament of Malaya were elected.

Parliament first sat at the former headquarters building of the Federated Malay States Volunteer Force on a hill near Jalan Tun Ismail (Maxwell Road). The Dewan Negara met in a hall on the ground floor while the Dewan Rakyat met in the hall on the first floor. With the completion of Parliament House in 1962, comprising a three-storey main building for the two houses of Parliament to meet, and an 18-storey tower for the offices of Ministers and members of Parliament, both houses moved there.

=== Malaysia ===
In 1963, when Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore merged to form Malaysia, the Malayan Parliament was adopted for use as the Parliament of Malaysia. Both Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara were expanded to include representatives from the new states. When Singapore seceded from Malaysia in 1965, it ceased to be represented in the Parliament of Malaysia.

Significant change regarding the composition of Dewan Negara occurred during this period. Under the 1957 Constitution of Malaya, senators elected by the state assemblies were in the majority, totalling 22 members with 2 for each state, while there were only 16 appointed members. The 1963 Constitution of Malaysia retains the provision that each state sends two senators, but subsequent amendments gradually increased the number of appointed members to 40 (plus another 4 appointed for representing the federal territories), leaving state-elected members in the minority and effectively diminishing the states&#x27; representation in Dewan Negara.

Parliament has been suspended twice in the history of Malaysia. The first suspension of Parliament occurred after the 13 May race riots in 1969, where a state of emergency was declared and the nation was run by the National Operations Council (NOC) for two years until the Parliament reconvened in February 1971. Fifty years later, the Parliament was suspended a second time in the history in January 2021 during the 2021 Malaysian state of emergency due to rising COVID-19 infections and political instability in the country. The suspension lasted only for 6 months and the Parliament was reconvened in July 2021.

Debates in Parliament are broadcast on radio and television occasionally, such as during the tabling of a budget. Proposals from the opposition to broadcast all debates live have been repeatedly rejected by the government; in one instance, a Minister said that the government was concerned over the poor conduct of the opposition as being inappropriate for broadcasting. The prohibitive cost (RM100,000 per sitting) was also cited as a reason.

In 2006, Information Minister Zainuddin Maidin cited the controversy over speeches made at the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) — the leading party in the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition – annual general assembly as a reason to avoid telecasting Parliamentary debates. Zainuddin said that &quot;our society has not attained a mental maturity where it is insensitive to racial issues&quot;, citing the controversy over a delegate who said Malays would fight &quot;to the last drop of blood&quot; to defend the special provisions granted to them as bumiputra under the Constitution.

Since 2013, parliamentary debates are broadcast live on state television TV1.

== Composition and powers ==

As the ultimate legislative body in Malaysia, the Parliament is responsible for passing, amending and repealing acts of law. It is subordinate to the Head of State, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, under Article 39 of the Constitution.

The Dewan Rakyat consists of 222 members of Parliament (MPs) elected from single-member constituencies drawn based on population in a general election using the first-past-the-post system. A general election is held every five years or when Parliament is dissolved by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on the advice of the Prime Minister. Suffrage is given to registered voters 18 years and above, however voting is not compulsory. The age requirement to stand for election is 18 years and above. When a member of Parliament dies, resigns or become disqualified to hold a seat, a by-election is held in his constituency unless the tenure for the current Parliament is less than two years, where the seat is simply left vacant until the next general election.

The Dewan Negara consists of 70 members (Senators); 26 are elected by the 13 state assemblies (2 senators per state), 4 are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to represent the 3 federal territories (2 for Kuala Lumpur, 1 each for Putrajaya and Labuan). The rest 40 members are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on the advice of the Prime Minister. Senators must be 30 years or above, and are appointed to a three-year term for a maximum of two terms. The dissolution of the Parliament does not affect the Dewan Negara.

Members of Parliament are permitted to speak on any subject without fear of censure outside Parliament; the only body that can censure an MP is the House Committee of Privileges. Parliamentary immunity takes effect from the moment a member of Parliament is sworn in, and only applies when that member has the floor; it does not apply to statements made outside the House. An exception to this rule are portions of the constitution related to the social contract, such as the Articles governing citizenship, Bumiputera (Malays and indigenous people) priorities, the Malay language, etc. — all public questioning of these provisions is illegal under the 1971 amendments to the Sedition Act, which Parliament passed in the wake of the 1969 13 May race riots. Members of Parliament are also forbidden from criticising the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and judges. Parliamentary immunity and other such privileges are set out by Article 63 of the Constitution; as such, the specific exceptions to such immunity had to be included in the Constitution by amendment after the 13 May incident.

The executive government, comprising the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, is drawn from the members of Parliament and is responsible to the Parliament. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong appoints the Prime Minister, who is the Head of Government but constitutionally subordinant to His Majesty, from the Dewan Rakyat. In practice, the Prime Minister shall be the one who commands the confidence of the majority of the Dewan Rakyat. The Prime Minister then submits a list containing the names of members of his Cabinet, who will then be appointed as Ministers by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. Members of the Cabinet must also be members of Parliament, usually from the Dewan Rakyat. The Cabinet formulates government policy and drafts bills, meeting in private. The members must accept &quot;collective responsibility&quot; for the decisions the Cabinet makes, even if some members disagree with it; if they do not wish to be held responsible for Cabinet decisions, they must resign. Although the Constitution makes no provision for it, there is also a Deputy Prime Minister, who is the &quot;de facto&quot; successor of the Prime Minister should he die, resign or be otherwise incapacitated.

If the Prime Minister loses the confidence of the Dewan Rakyat, whether by losing a no-confidence vote or by failing to pass a budget, he must either submit his resignation to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, or ask His Majesty to dissolve the Parliament. If His Majesty refuses to dissolve the Parliament (one of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong discretionary powers), the Cabinet must resign and the Yang di-Pertuan Agong will appoint a new Prime Minister.

Although the judiciary is constitutionally an independent branch of the government, after the 1988 constitutional crisis, the judiciary was made subject to Parliament; judicial powers are held by Parliament, and vested by it in the courts, instead of being directly held by the judiciary as before. The Attorney-General was also conferred the power to instruct the courts on what cases to hear, where they would be heard, and whether to discontinue a particular case.

After the general elections in 2008, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, leader of the People&#x27;s Justice Party and wife of former deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim became the leader of the opposition. She is the first female in Malaysian history to have held this position. Wan Azizah is described as the &quot;brains&quot; behind the coalition of her own party, the &#x27;leftist&#x27; Democratic Action Party (DAP) and the religion based Pan Malaysian Islamic Party.

== Procedure ==
Parliament meets from Monday to Thursday when it is in session, as Friday is part of the weekend in the states of Johor, Kelantan, Kedah, and Terengganu. However, the lower house (Dewan Rakyat) also meets on Friday for a day (usually on September to November) during the federal budget presentation.

A proposed act of law begins its life when a particular government minister or ministry prepares a first draft with the assistance of the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department. The draft, known as a bill, is then discussed by the Cabinet. If it is agreed to be submitted to Parliament, the bill is distributed to all MPs. It then goes through three readings before the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot;. The first reading is where the minister or his deputy submits it to Parliament. At the second reading, the bill is discussed and debated by MPs. Until the mid-1970s, both English and Malay (the national language) were used for debates, but henceforth, only Malay was permitted, unless permission was obtained from the Speaker of the House. At the third reading, the minister or his deputy formally submit it to a vote for approval. A 2/3 majority is usually required to pass the bill, but in certain cases, a simple majority suffices. Should the bill pass, it is sent to the &quot;Dewan Negara&quot;, where the three readings are carried out again. The &quot;Dewan Negara&quot; may choose not to pass the bill, but this only delays its passage by a month, or in some cases, a year; once this period expires, the bill is considered to have been passed by the house.

If the bill passes, it is presented to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, who has 30 days to consider the bill. Should he disagree with it, he returns it to Parliament with a list of suggested amendments. Parliament must then reconsider the bill and its proposed amendments and return it to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong within 30 days if they pass it again. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong then has another 30 days to give the royal assent; otherwise, it passes into law. The law does not take effect until it is published in the Government Gazette.

The government attempts to maintain top secrecy regarding bills debated; MPs generally receive copies of bills only a few days before they are debated, and newspapers are rarely provided with copies of the bills before they are debated. In some cases, such as a 1968 amendment to the Constitution, an MP may be presented with a bill to be debated on the same day it is tabled, and all three readings may be carried out that day itself. In rare circumstances, the government may release a White paper containing particular proposals that will eventually be incorporated into a bill; this has been done for legislation such as the Universities and University Colleges Act.

Although the process above assumes only the government can propose bills, there also exists a process for Private Member&#x27;s Bills. However, as in most other legislatures following the Westminster System, few members of Parliament actually introduce bills. To present a Private Member&#x27;s Bill, the member in question must seek the leave of the House in question to debate the bill before it is moved. Originally, it was allowed to debate the bill in the process of seeking leave, but this process was discontinued by an amendment to the Standing Orders of Parliament. It is also possible for members of the &quot;Dewan Negara&quot; (Senate) to initiate bills; however, only cabinet ministers are permitted to move finance-related bills, which must be tabled in the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot;.

It is often alleged that legislation proposed by the opposition parties, which must naturally be in the form of a Private Member&#x27;s Bill, is not seriously considered by Parliament. Some have gone as far as to claim that the rights of members of Parliament to debate proposed bills have been severely curtailed by incidents such as an amendment of the Standing Orders that permitted the Speaker of the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot; to amend written copies of MPs&#x27; speeches before they were made. Nevertheless, some of these critics also suggest that &quot;Government officials often face sharp questioning in Parliament, although this is not always reported in detail in the press.&quot;

Most motions are typically approved or rejected by a voice vote; divisions are generally rare. In 2008, the 12th Parliament saw the first division on the question of a supply bill.

In June 2008, two MPs announced they would be supporting a motion of no confidence against the Prime Minister, another first in the history of Parliament. The procedure surrounding a vote of no confidence is not entirely clear; as of 18 June 2008 it appeared there was no provision in the Standing Orders for whether a simple majority or a 2/3 supermajority would be necessary to pass a vote of no confidence

== Relationship with the government ==
In theory, based on the Constitution of Malaysia, the government is accountable to Parliament. However, there has been substantial controversy over the independence of the Malaysian Parliament, with many viewing it simply as a rubber stamp, whereby government MPs attend parliamentary votes purely to approve decisions made by the executive branch of the government (particularly decisions made by Prime Minister and/or the Cabinet). Constitutional scholar Shad Saleem Faruqi has calculated that 80% of all bills the government introduced from 1991 to 1995 were passed without a single amendment. According to him, another 15% were withdrawn due to pressure from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or other countries, while only 5% were amended or otherwise altered by Parliament. Shad concludes that &quot;the legislative process is basically an executive process, not a parliamentary process.&quot; In practice, almost all laws are passed without any amendments from either non-executive government MPs or opposition MPs. Furthermore, all laws have been passed based on the official line set down by leaders of the governing political party; no laws have been passed through a conscience vote. Party whips in Malaysia play a minimal role unlike their counterparts in the United Kingdom, as party discipline in Malaysia is very strict and almost every parliamentary vote is based on the official position of the respective political party coalitions (every parliamentary bill passed into law, was voted in favour by all government MPs).

=== Checks and balances ===
Theoretically, the executive branch of the government held in check by the legislative and judiciary branches. Parliament largely exerts control on the government through question time, where MPs question members of the cabinet on government policy, and through Select committees that are formed to look into a particular issue.

Formally, Parliament exercises control over legislation and financial affairs. However, the legislature has been condemned as having a &quot;tendency to confer wide powers on ministers to enact delegated legislation&quot;, and a substantial portion of the government&#x27;s revenue is not under Parliament&#x27;s purview; government-linked companies, such as Petronas, are generally not accountable to Parliament. In his 1970 book &quot;The Malay Dilemma&quot;, former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad stated: &quot;In the main, Parliamentary sittings were regarded as a pleasant formality which afforded members opportunities to be heard and quoted, but which would have absolutely no effect on the course of the Government. ... The sittings were a concession to a superfluous democratic practice. Its main value lay in the opportunity to flaunt Government strength.&quot; Critics have regarded Parliament as a &quot;safe outlet for the grievances of backbenchers or opposition members,&quot; and meant largely to &quot;endorse government or ruling party proposals&quot; rather than act as a check on them.

Party loyalty is strictly enforced by the Barisan Nasional coalition government, which has controlled Parliament throughout most years of Malaysia&#x27;s existence. Those who have voted against the frontbench position, such as Shahrir Abdul Samad, have been sanctioned by being coerced to resign from party positions. Although there is no precedent of an MP being removed from the house for crossing the floor, two Penang State Legislative Assemblymen who abstained from voting on an opposition-tabled motion in the State Legislative Assembly were suspended, and a stern warning was issued by then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad stating that representatives from BN would likely be dismissed if they crossed the floor. This was later affirmed by Mahathir&#x27;s successor, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who issued an official directive prohibiting BN MPs from voting for opposition-tabled motions in Parliament.

At one time, there was an attempt led by government backbenchers to gain Abdullah&#x27;s support for a policy change which would permit some discretion in voting, but Abdullah insisted that MPs have &quot;no leeway or freedom to do as they like&quot;. A similar policy is in place in the non-partisan &quot;Dewan Negara&quot; — when in 2005, several Senators refused to support the Islamic Family Law (Federal Territories) (Amendment) Bill 2005, Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department Nazri Aziz said that although the government would take note of the complaints, &quot;the cabinet did not allow senators to exercise conscience voting on this issue&quot;.

There have been only six Select Committees formed since 1970, when Parliament reconvened after the May 13 Incident. Of these, three were formed between 2002 and 2005. Although question time exists for Parliament to check the power of the executive, it has been argued that the question time allotted for MPs to question the government on its policies is insufficient or ineffective. Shad has calculated that as each question time session lasts only an hour, at the most, twelve questions can be asked. Opposition Leader Lim Kit Siang of the Democratic Action Party (DAP) calculated that over the space of three days (from 10 to 13 October 2005), only 32 questions were answered orally. Of these 32 questions, only nine or 28% percent were answered by the Ministers concerned. The rest were answered either by Deputy Ministers (41%) or Parliamentary Secretaries (31%). After the 2008 general election, Abdullah reshuffled his Cabinet, eliminating Parliamentary Secretaries, which &quot;The Sun&quot; greeted as a move &quot;forcing ministers and deputy ministers to answer questions in Parliament&quot;.

Time is allocated for discussion of the annual budget after it is tabled by the Minister of Finance; however, most MPs spend much of the time questioning the government on other issues. Shad contends that although about 20 days are given for discussion of the budget, &quot;the budget debate is used to hit the government on the head about everything else other than the budget. From potholes to education policy to illegal immigrants.&quot; If Parliament votes to reject the budget, it is taken as a vote of no-confidence, forcing the government out of office. The government will then either have to reform itself with a new cabinet and possibly new Prime Minister, or call for a general election. As a result, Shad states that &quot;MPs may criticize, they may have their say but the government will have its way&quot; when it comes to the budget.

With the judiciary, it is possible for the courts to declare a particular act of Parliament unconstitutional. However, this has never occurred. Parliament is not involved in the process of judicial appointments.

=== Department of Parliament controversy ===

In early October 2005, the Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department in charge of parliamentary affairs, Nazri Aziz, announced the formation of a Department of Parliament to oversee its day-to-day running. The leader of the Opposition, Lim Kit Siang, immediately announced a &quot;Save Parliament&quot; campaign to &quot;ensure that Parliament does not become a victim in the second most serious assault on the doctrine of separation of powers in the 48-year history of the nation&quot;.

Nazri soon backed down, saying he had meant an office (although he stated &quot;jabatan&quot;, which means department; &quot;pejabat&quot; is the Malay word for office) and not Department (&quot;Jabatan&quot;) of Parliament. The New Straits Times, a newspaper owned by the United Malays National Organisation (a key member of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition) wrote in an editorial that &quot;ministerial authority was established over Parliament the building&quot; and not Parliament the institution and that &quot;[i]f the new &#x27;department&#x27; and its management and staff do their jobs well, the rakyat (people) would have even more of a right to expect their MPs to do theirs by turning up for Dewan sessions, preserving that quaint tradition of the quorum, on behalf of their constituencies.&quot;

Lim was dissatisfied with such a response and went ahead with a &quot;Save Parliament&quot; roundtable attended by several MPs (including Nazri) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Although Lim thanked Nazri (the only Barisan Nasional MP in attendance), he stated that the proposed department remained a threat to Parliament&#x27;s independence, and had to be &quot;seen in the context of the relentless erosion and diminution of parliamentary powers and functions by the Executive&quot;. In a statement, the roundtable found that &quot;Nazri&#x27;s explanations were not convincing&quot; and urged &quot;Nazri to halt all implementation of the Cabinet decision to establish a Department or Office of Parliament until MPs and the civil society could approve and support the proposal&quot;.

On 13 October in the Dewan Rakyat, Ahmad Shabery Cheek (BN MP for Kemaman) tabled a motion to reinstate the Parliamentary Services Act 1963 (which would provide for a parliamentary service independent of the Public Service Department currently handling parliamentary affairs) that had been repealed (upon the unilateral suggestion of then-Speaker Zahir Ismail) in 1992. Ahmad Shabery demanded to know if the government would make the status of parliament as an independent institution clear, and stated that &quot;Aside from nice flooring, chairs and walls, we don&#x27;t even have a library that can make us proud, no in-house outlet selling copies of different Acts that are passed in Parliament itself and no proper information centre.&quot;

Nazri responded that the motion would have to be referred to the House Committee for review. Shahrir Abdul Samad, chairman of the Barisan Nasional Backbenchers Club, then insisted that the Act be immediately restored without being referred to the Committee, and called on all MPs who supported the motion to stand. Several immediately stood, with some Opposition MPs shouting &quot;bangun, bangun&quot; (stand up, stand up). Following Shahrir&#x27;s lead, a majority of the BN MPs also stood, including some frontbenchers. However, several ministers, including Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar (who had supported repealing the Act in 1992) remained seated. Nazri then stated that the matter would remain with the Committee, as he did not want it dealt with in a slipshod manner.

The following day, Lim called on Kamaruddin Mohd Baria, who would have taken the post of Parliament Head of Administration, not to report for duty in his new post. Meanwhile, the Dewan Negara House Committee held a specially-convened meeting, which called on the government to revive the Act and to call off all moves to change the administrative structure of Parliament. The President of the Dewan Negara, Abdul Hamid Pawanteh, also stated that he had not been informed &quot;at all&quot; by the government regarding the new department or office of Parliament. Later the same day, Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department Mohd Radzi Sheikh Ahmad stated that the government had agreed to revive the Act.

However, on 17 October, Nazri refused to budge on the issue of the new post of &quot;Parliament Head of Administration&quot; (which would make the current Parliamentary Secretary, who is accountable to Parliament and not the executive, redundant). He also stated that the Parliamentary Services Act would have to go through the Dewan Rakyat House Committee and endorsed by the Dewan Rakyat before being sent to the cabinet for approval. In his blog, Lim slammed Nazri for overlooking &quot;the fact that when the Parliamentary Privilege Act was repealed in 1992, it was not at the recommendation of the Dewan Rakyat House Committee but merely at the unilateral request of the Speaker.&quot;

== Dewan Negara ==

The Dewan Negara (Malay for &quot;Senate&quot;, literally &quot;National Council&quot;) is the upper house of the Parliament of Malaysia, consisting of 70 senators of whom 26 are elected by the state legislative assemblies, with two senators for each state, while the other 44 are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King), including four of whom are appointed to represent the federal territories. The term of office is 3 years and senators may only be re-appointed once, consecutively or non-consecutively.

The &quot;Dewan Negara&quot; usually reviews legislation that has been passed by the lower house, the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot;. All bills must usually be passed by both the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot; and the &quot;Dewan Negara&quot; (the Senate), before they are sent to the King for royal assent. However, if the &quot;Dewan Negara&quot; rejects a bill, it can only delay the bill&#x27;s passage by a maximum of a year before it is sent to the King. Like the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot;, the &quot;Dewan Negara&quot; meets at the Malaysian Houses of Parliament in Kuala Lumpur.

== Dewan Rakyat ==


The Dewan Rakyat (Malay for &quot;House of Representatives&quot;, literally &quot;People&#x27;s Hall&quot;) is the lower house of the Parliament of Malaysia, consisting of 222 Members of Parliament (MPs) elected during elections from federal constituencies drawn by the Election Commission. The term of office is at most 5 years and MPs may be re-elected indefinitely. However, an elected MP cannot concurrently serve as a senator.

The eligibility for appointment as minister or deputy minister is when they are elected as MP or appointed as senator. Therefore, a senator who is appointed as minister (or deputy minister) shall be seated in the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot; to answer parliamentary question. Nevertheless, they are not involved in the parliamentary voting session.

The &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot; usually proposes legislation through a draft known as a &#x27;bill&#x27;. All bills must usually be passed by both the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot; (House of Representatives) and the &quot;Dewan Negara&quot;, before they are sent to the King for royal assent. However, if the &quot;Dewan Negara&quot; rejects a bill, it can only delay the bill&#x27;s passage by a maximum of a year before it is sent to the King. Like the &quot;Dewan Negara&quot;, the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot; meets at the Malaysian Houses of Parliament in Kuala Lumpur.

== Trivia ==
Members of Parliament are allowed to wear Malaysian batik clothing on Thursdays during parliamentary sessions; the wearing of batik in Parliament is not mandatory and is purely voluntary.

<doc id="505878" wikidata="Q687591" url="?curid=505878" title="Capital gains tax">
<text>A capital gains tax (CGT) is the tax on profits realized on the sale of a non-inventory asset. The most common capital gains are realized from the sale of stocks, bonds, precious metals, real estate, and property.

Not all countries impose a capital gains tax, and most have different rates of taxation for individuals compared to corporations. Countries that do not impose a capital gains tax include Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, the Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man, Jamaica, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Singapore, and others. In some countries, such as New Zealand and Singapore, professional traders and those who trade frequently are taxed on such profits as a business income. In Sweden, a so-called investment savings account (ISK – &quot;investeringssparkonto&quot;) was introduced in 2012 in response to a decision by Parliament to stimulate saving in funds and equities. There is no tax on capital gains in ISKs; instead, the saver pays an annual standard low rate of tax. Fund savers nowadays mainly choose to save in funds via investment savings accounts.

Capital gains taxes are payable on most valuable items or assets sold at a profit. Antiques, shares, precious metals and second homes could be all subject to the tax if the profit is large enough. This lower boundary of profit is set by the government. If the profit is lower than this limit it is tax-free. The profit is in most cases the difference between the amount (or value) an asset is sold for and the amount it was bought for.

The tax rate on capital gains may depend on the sellers income. For example, in the UK the CGT is currently (tax year 2021–22) 10% for incomes under £50,270 and 20% for higher incomes. There is an additional tax that adds 8% to the existing tax rate if the profit comes from residential property. If any property or asset is sold at a loss, it is possible to offset it against annual gains. It is also possible to carry forward losses if these are properly registered with HMRC. The CGT allowance for one tax year in the UK is currently £3,000 for an individual and double (£6,000) for a married couple or in a civil partnership. For equities, national and state legislation often has a large array of fiscal obligations that must be respected regarding capital gains. Taxes are charged by the state over the transactions, dividends and capital gains on the stock market. However, these fiscal obligations may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

==As an obstacle to sale==
The CGT can be considered a cost of selling which can be greater than, for example, transaction costs or provisions. The literature provides information that barriers for trading negatively affects the investors&#x27; willingness to trade, which in turn can change assets prices.

Companies with tax-sensitive customers are particularly reactive to capital gains tax and its change. CGT and changes to it affect trading and the stock market. Investors must be ready to react sensibly to these changes, taking into account the cumulative capital gains of their customers. They are sales must be delayed due to an unfavorable market conditions caused by capital gains tax. A study by Li Jin (2006) showed that great capital gains discourage selling. On the contrary to this fact, small capital gains stimulate the trade and investors are more likely to sell.
&quot;It is easy to show that to be willing to sell now the investor must believe that the stock price will go down permanently. Thus, a capital gains tax can create a potentially large barrier to selling. Of course, the foregoing calculation ignores the possibility that there might be another taxtiming option: Given capital gains tax rates fluctuate over time, it might be worthwhile to time the realization of capital gains and wait until a subsequent regime lowers the capital gains tax rate.&quot;

==Savings and investment in open economy==
A capital tax influences an open economy in many ways. The international capital market that has hugely developed in the past few decades (in the 2nd half of the 20th century) is helping countries to deal with some gaps between investments and savings. Funds for borrowing money from abroad are helping to decrease the difference between domestic savings and domestic investments. Borrowing money from foreigners is rising when the capital that flows to another country is taxed. This tax, however, does not influence domestic investment. In the long run, the country that has borrowed some money and has a debt, usually has to pay this debt for example by exporting some products abroad. It affects the standard of living in this country. That is also why &quot;the foreign capital is not a perfect substitute for domestic savings.&quot;
In 1982, the United States was the world&#x27;s greatest creditor; however it went from this stage to being the greatest debtor in the world in four years. In 1982, the U.S. owned $147 billion of assets that were excess over and above the value of U.S. assets owned by foreigners. In 1986, this value inverted to negative $250 billion.

== Locked-in effect ==
Because capital gains are taxed only upon realization, an individual who owns a security that has increased in value may be less likely to sell it. The seller knows that when sold, tax is levied on the positive difference of the price at which the security was bought and the price at sale. If the seller chooses not to sell, the tax is postponed to later date. Postponing allows more time for the security to grow in value and generate returns. If the seller delays the sale, though the absolute value of the tax is greater than if they had not delayed, the present discounted value of the tax is reduced; thus allowing the security to grow undoes the tax. Therefore, the seller has an incentive to hold the securities longer than they would have without capital gains tax. This distortion has been called the locked-in effect or lock-in effect.

Martin Feldstein, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Reagan has claimed that the effect is so large that reducing the capital gains tax would lead individuals to sell securities that they previously had refused to sell, to such an extent that government revenues would actually increase. 1994 estimates suggest that a permanent reduction in the capital gains tax rate would have little effect.

== Administrative expenses ==
With collecting of any type of tax come administrative costs associated with collecting, administering and managing the collection of capital gains taxes. These costs are directly incurred by governments that collect taxes, and ultimately its citizens. Unfortunately, no studies (at least that Fraser Institute researchers knew of in 2007) specifically analyze the costs associated with capital gains taxes.

Canadian researcher Francois Vailancourt in 1989 examines the administrative costs associated with personal income taxes and two payroll taxes (CPP/QPP and UI). The costs include processing costs, administration and accommodation costs, capital expenses, and litigation costs. These costs represented roughly 1% of the gross revenues collected by these three tax sources. The paper does not show exactly what costs are incurred by capital gains tax.

== Compliance costs ==
Tax compliance costs are incurred when fulfilling the recording and filing requirements associated with paying a tax. These costs include such expenses as bookkeeping, reporting, calculating, and remitting tax payments. A study from 1992, which may be outdated due to technological advancements, found that American taxpayers who received capital gains income incurred higher compliance costs than those who did not. From a survey of 2,000 Minnesota households, the authors found that having capital gains increased the time individuals spent on paying taxes by 7.9 hours, increased the money they spent on professional tax assistance by about $21, and increased the total cost of compliance by $143 per taxpayer (not adjusted for inflation) per year.

Altogether the study concludes that very few studies measure compliance costs associated with capital gains tax, but those few that do clearly indicate that compliance costs are not insignificant. Therefore, the costs must be taken into consideration when assessing tax policy.

== Tax evasion ==
Capital gains taxes have also led some taxpayers to evade the payment of the tax. The level of tax evasion is the extent to which actual tax revenue collected by government differs from that which would have been collected if every taxpayer paid exactly what is required by law. Tax evasion has important implications for the efficiency of taxes, since resources spent on evading the tax could be put to more productive uses.

Professor James Poterba&#x27;s work from 1987 in the American Economic Review studied the relationship between capital gains taxes and tax evasion: a 1% decrease in capital gains tax rate increases the reported tax base by 0.4% (amounting to a 0.6% decrease in tax collected).

A more recent study from the &quot;Journal of Public Economics&quot; provides support for Poterba&#x27;s work with evidence from a unique data set of shareholder information from the 1989 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. The study estimates that a one percentage-point increase in the marginal tax rate on capital gains is associated with a 0.42% increase in evasion (amounting to a 0.58% increase in tax collected). In addition, the authors find that the average level of evasion was 11% of the total capital gains.

==By country==

=== Albania ===
In Albania, capital gains on the sale of stocks or shares are taxable at 15%. This tax rate also applies to capital gains made from transfers of ownership of real estate, both land or buildings. Individual income tax rate on dividends is 8%.

===Argentina===
There is no specific capital gains tax in Argentina; however, there is a 9% to 35% tax for fiscal residents on their world revenues, including capital gains.

===Australia===
Australia collects capital gains tax only upon realized capital gains, except for certain provisions relating to deferred-interest debt such as zero-coupon bonds. The tax is not separate in its own right, but forms part of the income-tax system. The proceeds of an asset sold less its &quot;cost base&quot; (the original cost plus additions for cost price increases over time) are the capital gain. Discounts and other concessions apply to certain taxpayers in varying circumstances. Capital gains tax is collected from assets anywhere in the world, not only in Australia.

Capital gains tax (CGT) is the levy applied to profits from selling your assets. Despite its designation as ‘capital gains tax,’ it is not a standalone tax but rather a constituent part of Australia’s income tax. When you sell assets (typically upon ceasing ownership), a CGT event is triggered, and you must disclose capital gains and losses in your income tax return.

From 21 September 1999, after a report by Alan Reynolds, the 50% capital gains tax discount has been in place for individuals and for some trusts that acquired the asset after that time and that have held the asset for more than 12 months, however the tax is levied without any adjustment to the cost base for inflation. The amount left after applying the discount is added to the assessable income of the taxpayer for that financial year.

For individuals, the most significant exemption is the principal family home when not used for business purposes such as rental income or home-based business activity. The sale of personal residential property is normally exempt from capital gains tax, except for gains realized during any period in which the property was unused as a personal residence (for example, while leased to other tenants) or portions attributable to business use. Capital gains or losses as a general rule can be disregarded for CGT purposes when assets were acquired before 20 September 1985 (pre-CGT).

===Austria===
Austria taxes capital gains at 25% (on checking account and &quot;Sparbuch&quot; interest) or 27.5% (all other types of capital gains). There is an exception for capital gains from the sale of shares of foreign entities (with opaque taxation) if the participation exceeds 10% and shares are held for over one year (so-called &quot;Schachtelprivileg&quot;).

=== Belarus ===
In Belarus, capital gains are included in the total income of the individual taxpayer. Income from the sale of one house, apartment, building, land plot, garage and a car parking space within 5 years and more is not taxable. However, income from the second sale and every subsequent sale of an immovable property of the same type within a five-year period is fully taxable.

Income derived from the disposal of one vehicle within a calendar year is exempted from PIT, but is subject to PIT with standard terms for every subsequent disposal of a vehicle.

Income derived from the disposal of shares in a statutory capital of a Belarusian company is exempted from PIT as long as the taxpayer was in possession of these shares for a continuous period of no less than three years.

Income derived from the sale of securities is subject to PIT in compliance with the Tax Code.

The capital gains tax rate in Belarus is 18% for disposal of stocks/shares.

===Belgium===
Under the participation exemption, capital gains realised by a Belgian resident company on shares in a Belgian or foreign company are fully exempt from corporate income tax, provided that the dividends on the shares qualify for the participation exemption. For purposes of the participation exemption for capital gains the minimum participation test is not required.
Unrealised capital gains on shares that are recognised in the financial statements (which recognition is not mandatory) are taxable. But a roll-over relief is granted if, and as long as, the gain is booked in a separate reserve account on the balance sheet and is not used for distribution or allocation of any kind.

As a counterpart to the new exemption of realised capital gains, capital losses on shares, both realised and unrealised, are no longer tax deductible. However, the loss incurred in connection with the liquidation of a subsidiary company remains deductible up to the amount of the paid-up share capital.

Other capital gains are taxed at the ordinary rate. If the total amount of sales is used for the purchase of depreciable fixed assets within 3 years, the taxation of the capital gains will be spread over the depreciable period of these assets.

===Brazil===
Capital gain taxes are only paid on realized gains. At the current stage, taxes are 15% for transactions longer than one-day-old and 20% for day trading, both transactions are due payable at the following month after selling or closing the position. Dividends are tax free, since the issuer company has already paid to &quot;RECEITA FEDERAL&quot; (the Brazilian tax office). Derivatives (futures and options) follow the same rules for tax purposes as company stocks. When selling less than R$20.000 (Brazilian Reais) within a month (and not operating in day trading), the financial operation is considered tax-free. Also, non-residents have no tax on capital gains.

===Bulgaria===
The Corporate tax rate is 10%.
The personal tax rate is flat at 10%.
There is no capital gains tax on equity instruments traded on the BSE.

===Canada===
A Capital Gains tax was first introduced in Canada by Pierre Trudeau and his finance minister Edgar Benson in the 1971 Canadian federal budget.

Some exceptions apply, such as selling one&#x27;s primary residence which may be exempt from taxation. Capital gains made by investments in a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) are not taxed.

Since the 2013 budget, interest can no longer be claimed as a capital gain. The formula is the same for capital losses and these can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future years&#x27; capital gains; capital losses not used in the current year can also be carried back to the previous three tax years to offset capital gains tax paid in those years.

If one&#x27;s income is primarily derived from capital gains then it may not qualify for the 50% multiplier and will instead be taxed at the full income tax rate. CRA has a number of criteria to determine whether this will be the case.

For corporations as for individuals, 50% of realized capital gains are taxable. The net taxable capital gains (which can be calculated as 50% of total capital gains minus 50% of total capital losses) are subject to income tax at normal corporate tax rates. If more than 50% of a small business&#x27;s income is derived from specified investment business activities (which include income from capital gains) they are not permitted to claim the small business deduction.

Capital gains earned on income in a Registered Retirement Savings Plan are not taxed at the time the gain is realized (i.e., when the holder sells a stock that has appreciated inside of their RRSP) but they are taxed when the funds are withdrawn from the registered plan (usually after being converted to a Registered Income Fund at the age of 71.) These gains are then taxed at the individual&#x27;s full marginal rate.

Capital gains earned on income in a TFSA are not taxed at the time the gain is realized. Any money withdrawn from a TFSA, including capital gains, are also not taxed.

Unrealized capital gains are generally not taxed, except for the deemed disposition when emigrating out of Canada or inheritance by a non-spouse.

In 2022, with price levels surging, some economists have argued that the capital gain tax should be adjusted for inflation, saying that without such adjustment, it taxes &quot;fictional gains&quot;, which discourages investment.

===China===

The applicable tax rate for capital gains in China depends upon the nature of the taxpayer (i.e. whether the taxpayer is a person or company) and whether the taxpayer is resident or non-resident for tax purposes. It should however be noted that, unlike common law tax systems, Chinese income tax legislation does not provide a distinction between income and capital. What is commonly referred to by taxpayers and practitioners as capital gain tax is actually within the income tax framework, rather than a separate regime.

Tax-resident enterprises will be taxed at 25% in accordance with the Enterprise Income Tax Law. Non-resident enterprises will be taxed at 10% on capital gains in accordance with the Implementing Regulations to the Enterprise Income Tax Law. In practice, where a resident of a treaty partner alienates assets situated in China as part of its ordinary course of business the gains so derived will likely be assessed as if it is a capital gain, rather than business profit. This is somewhat contradictory with the basic principles of double taxation treaty.

The only tax circular specifically addressing the PRC income tax treatment of income derived by QFIIs from the holding and trading of Chinese securities is Guo Shui Han (2009) No.47 (&quot;Circular 47&quot;) issued by the State Administration of Taxation (&quot;SAT&quot;) on 23 January 2009. The circular addresses the withholding tax treatment of dividends and interest received by QFIIs from PRC resident companies, however, circular 47 is silent on the treatment of capital gains derived by QFIIs on the trading of A-shares. It is generally accepted that Circular 47 is intentionally silent on capital gains and a possible indication that SAT is considering, but still undecided on, whether to grant tax exemption or other concessionary treatment to capital gains derived by QFIIs. Nevertheless, it is noted that there have been cases where QFIIs withdraw capital from China after paying 10% withholding tax on gains derived through share trading over the years on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This uncertainty has caused significant problems for those investment managers investing in A-Shares. Guo Shui Han (2009) No. 698 (&quot;Circular 698&quot;) was issued on 10 December 2009 addressing the PRC corporate income tax treatment on the transfer of PRC equity interest by non-PRC tax resident enterprises directly or indirectly, however has not resolved the uncertain tax position with regards A-Shares. With respect to Circular 698 itself, there are views that it is not consistent with the Enterprise Income Tax Law as well as double taxation treaties signed by the Chinese government. The validity of the Circular is controversial, especially in light of recent developments in the international arena, such as the TPG case in Australia and Vodafone case in India.

=== Colombia ===
Under Colombian law, there are different kinds of capital gains subject to taxation:
* Gains derived from the sale of assets (shares, bonds, etc.) held for a minimum of 2 years.
* Gains derived from the liquidation of a company that has been in existence for a minimum of 2 years.
* Gains derived from inheritances, donations or legacies (portion of estate received by spouse or heir)
* Gains derived from gambling and lotteries
The general capital gains tax rate in Colombia is 10%, with the exception of lottery or gambling winnings, which are taxed at 20%.

===Croatia===
The capital gains tax in Croatia is 10%. It was introduced in 2015 at a rate of 12% and reduced to 10% in 2021.

===Cyprus===
Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is imposed at the rate of 20% on:

* The gains from the disposal of immovable property situated in Cyprus. 
* The gains from the disposal of shares in companies which own immovable property in Cyprus and that are not listed in any recognized Stock Exchange. 
* The gains from the disposal of shares in companies which directly or indirectly participate in other companies which hold immovable property in Cyprus provided that at least 50% of the market value of the shares sold is derived from property situated in Cyprus (the disposal proceeds subject to CGT in this case are restricted to the market value of the immovable property held directly or indirectly by the company of which the shares are sold).
* Any trading nature profits derived from the sale of shares of companies which directly or indirectly own immovable property in Cyprus provided that such profit is exempt from taxation under income tax.
No CGT is imposed on the subsequent disposal of properties which are acquired in the period from 17 July 2015 up to 31 December 2016.

===Czech Republic===
Capital gains in the Czech Republic are taxed as income for companies and individuals. The Czech income tax rate for an individual&#x27;s income in 2010 is a flat 15% rate. Corporate tax in 2024 is 21%. Capital gains from the sale of shares by a company owning 10% or more is entitled to participation exemption under certain terms. For an individual, gain from the sale of a primary private dwelling, held for at least 3 years, is tax exempt. Or, when not used as a main residence, if held for more than 5 years. Any capital gains realized on the disposal of securities up to annual gross sale amount of CZK 100,000 are tax exempt for the taxpayer.

===Denmark===
Share dividends and realized capital gains on shares are charged 27% to individuals of gains up to DKK 48,300 (2013-level, adjusted annually), and at 42% of gains above that. Carryforward of realized losses on shares is allowed.

Individuals&#x27; interest income from bank deposits and bonds, realized gains on property and other capital gains are taxed up to 59%, however, several exemptions occur, such as on selling one&#x27;s principal private residence or on gains on selling bonds. Interest paid on loans is deductible, although in case the net capital income is negative, only approx. 33% tax credit applies.

Companies are taxed at 25%. Share dividends are taxed at 28%.

===Ecuador===
Corporate taxation:

Residence for tax purposes is based on the place of incorporation.

Resident entities are taxed on worldwide income. Nonresidents are subject to tax only on Ecuador-source income.

Capital gains are treated as ordinary income and taxed at the normal corporate rate.

The standard rate is 22%, with a reduced rate of 15% applying where corporate profits are reinvested for the purchase of machinery or equipment and/or the acquisition of new technology. Companies engaged in the exploration or exploitation of hydrocarbon also are subject to the standard corporate tax rate.

Personal taxation:

Resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income; nonresidents are taxed only on Ecuadorian-source income.

An individual is deemed to be resident if they are in Ecuador for more than 6 months in a year.

Capital gains are treated as ordinary income and taxed at the normal rate.

Rates are progressive from 0% to 35%.

===Egypt===
After the Egyptian Revolution, there was a proposal for a 10% capital gains tax.
This proposal was implemented on 29 May 2014.
Egypt exempt bonus shares from a new 10 percent capital gains tax on profits made on the stock market as the country&#x27;s Finance Minister Hany Dimian said on 30 May 2014, and distributions of bonus shares will be exempt from the taxes, and the new tax will not be retroactive.

===Estonia===
There is no separate capital gains tax in Estonia. For residents of Estonia all capital gains are taxed the same as regular income, the rate of which currently stands at 20%. Resident natural persons that have investment account can realise capital gains on some classes of assets tax free until withdrawal of funds from the investment account. For resident legal persons (includes partnerships) no tax is payable for realising capital gain (or receiving any other type of income), but only on payment of dividends, payments from capital (exceeding contributions to capital) and payments not related to business. The income tax rate for resident legal persons is 20% (payment of 80 units of dividends triggers 20 units of tax due).

===Finland===
The capital gains tax in Finland is 30% on realized capital income and 34% if the realized capital income is over 30,000 euros. The capital gains tax in 2011 was 28% on realized capital income. Carryforward of realized losses is allowed for five years. However, capital gains from the sale of residential homes is tax-free after two years of residence, with certain limitations.

Dividends from a publicly listed company are 85% taxable resulting in the CGT rate to be 25,5% or 28,9%. The company distributing the dividend will apply a 25,5% withholding tax.

===France===

For residents, there are two options for treating capital gains (shares, bonds, interests, etc.). 
It was introduced by President Emmanuel Macron as a key promise of its campaign and is called the Prélèvement Forfaitaire Unique – PFU. The first option is a flat 30% rate. The second option is to opt for the former treatment whereby gains are taxed at 17.2% for &quot;social contributions&quot; and (if the instrument has been held for at least two years) 60% of the gains are taxed as individual revenue (tax scale between 0–45%). The following year, 6.8% of the gains can be deducted from the tax base. For equities bought after 1 January 2018, the 60% reduction for 2-year long hold does not apply anymore.

If shares are held in a special account (called a PEA), the gain is subject only to &quot;social contributions&quot; (17.2%) provided that the PEA is held for at least five years. The maximum amount that can be deposited in the PEA is €150,000.

The gain realized on the sale of a principal residence is not taxable. A gain realized on the sale of other real estate held at least 30 years, however, is not taxable, although this will become subject to 15.5% social security taxes as of 2012. (There is a sliding scale for non-principal residence property owned for between 22 and 30 years.)

Non-residents are generally taxable on capital gains realized on French real estate and on some French financial instruments, subject to any applicable double tax treaty. Social security taxes, however, are not usually payable by non-residents. A French tax representative will be mandatory for non-residents who sell a property for an amount over 150.000 euros or who own the real estate for more than 15 years.

===Germany===

In January 2009, Germany introduced a very strict capital gains tax (called Abgeltungsteuer in German) for shares, funds, certificates, bank interest rates etc. Capital gains tax only applies to financial instruments (shares, bonds etc.) that have been bought after 31 December 2008. Instruments bought before this date are exempt from capital gains tax (assuming that they have been held for at least 12 months), even if they are sold in 2009 or later, barring a change of law. Certificates are treated specially, and only qualify for tax exemption if they have been bought before 15 March 2007.

Real estate continues to be exempt from capital gains tax if it has been held for more than ten years.
The German capital gains tax is 25% plus Solidarity surcharge (add-on tax initially introduced to finance the five eastern states of Germany – Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg – and the cost of the reunification, but later kept to finance all kinds of public funded projects in all Germany), plus Kirchensteuer (church tax, voluntarily), resulting in an effective tax rate of about 26.4–29%.
Deductions of expenses such as custodian fees, travel to annual shareholder meetings, legal and tax advice, interest paid on loans to buy shares, etc., are no longer permitted starting in 2009.

There is an allowance (Freistellungsauftrag) on capital gains income in Germany of €1000 per person per year of which you do not have to be taxed, if appropriate forms are completed.

===Greece===
Transfer of non-listed shares is subject to capital gain tax at the rate of 15%. Transfer of listed shares is also taxed at 15% unless specific conditions/exemptions apply. A transfer duty of 2‰ is imposed on the gross sale proceeds of listed shares.
Other sources say there is no tax in the case of capital gain from trading in the stock market as long as the individual owns less than 0.5% of the publicly listed company.

Dividends distributed within taxable periods commencing after 1 January 2020 arising from entities operating under the legal form of Société Anonyme (or Limited Liability) are taxed via corporate withholding taxation at the flat rate of 5% (said rate was set to 10% for the dividends distributed during the year 2019).

===Hong Kong===
In general, Hong Kong has no capital gains tax. However, employees who receive shares or options as part of their remuneration are taxed at the normal Hong Kong income tax rate on the value of the shares or options at the end of any vesting period less any amount that the individual paid for the grant.

If part of the vesting period is spent outside Hong Kong, then the tax payable in Hong Kong is pro-rated based on the proportion of time spent working in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has very few double tax agreements and hence there is little relief available for double taxation. Therefore, it is possible (depending on the country of origin) for employees moving to Hong Kong to pay full income tax on vested shares in both their country of origin and in Hong Kong. Similarly, an employee leaving Hong Kong can incur double taxation on the unrealized capital gains of their vested shares.

The Hong Kong taxation of capital gains on employee shares or options that are subject to a vesting period, is at odds with the treatment of unrestricted shares or options which are free of capital gains tax.

For those who do trading professionally (buying and selling securities frequently to obtain an income for living) as &quot;traders&quot;, this will be considered income subject to personal income tax rates.

===Hungary===
Since 1 January 2016 there is one flat tax rate (15%) on capital income. This includes: selling stocks, bonds, mutual funds shares and also interests from bank deposits. Since January 2010, Hungarian citizens can open special &quot;long-term&quot; accounts. The tax rate on capital gains from securities held in such an account is 10% after a three-year holding period, and 0% after the account&#x27;s maximum five years period is expired. From 1 August 2013 residents also were obligated to pay an additional 6% of health insurance tax (&quot;EHO&quot;) on their capital gain. The 6% health insurance tax on capital gains was abolished on 1 January 2017.

===Iceland===

From 1 January 2018 the capital gains tax in Iceland is 22%. It was 20% prior to that (for a full year, from 2011 to 2017), which in turn was a result of a progressive raises in the preceding years.

===India===
As of 2018, equities listed on recognised stock exchange are considered long term capital if the holding period is one year or more. Until 31 January 2017, all Long term capital gains from equities were exempt as per section 10 (38) if shares are sold through recognized stock exchange and Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is paid on the sale. STT in India is currently between 0.017% and 0.1% of total amount received on sale of securities through a recognized Indian stock exchange like the NSE or BSE. From fiscal year 2018–2019, exemption u/s 10(38) has been withdrawn and section 112A has been introduced. The long term capital gain shall be taxable on equities at 10% if the gain exceeds Rs. as per the new section.

However, if equities are held for less than one year and is sold through recognised stock exchange then short term capital gain is taxable at a flat rate of 15% u/s 111A and other surcharges, educational cess are imposed.(w.e.f. 1 April 2009.)

In respect of Immovable property, the holding period has been reduced to two years to be eligible for long term capital gain. Whereas, many other capital investments like Jewellery etc. are considered long term if the holding period is three or more years and are taxed at 20% u/s 112.

After 2024 changes equity sales are taxed at 12.5 percent if held for more than 1 year and 20 percent if held for less than 1 year. Indexation benefit from home capital gains has been removed and the tax rate has been bought down to 12.5 percent from 20 percent.

Capital Gains Tax Rates for Fiscal Year 2017–18 (Assessment Year 2018–19)
===Indonesia===
Capital gains are generally assessable at standard income rates. The exceptions are:
* Sale of land and/or buildings located in Indonesia. The tax is 5% final tax (or 2.5% from 8 September 2016) on the taxable sale value or the actual proceeds, whichever is higher.
* Sale of shares traded in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The tax is 0.1% final tax on the sales proceeds.

===Ireland===
Since 5 December 2012, there is a 33% tax on capital gains which generally does not make any allowance for inflation. There are several exclusions and deductions (e.g. agricultural land, primary residence, transfers between spouses). Gains made where the asset was originally purchased before 2003 attract indexation relief (the cost of the asset can be multiplied by a published factor to reflect inflation). Costs of purchase and sale are deductible, and every person has an exempt band of €1,270 per year. Purchases made before 1 January 2002 will have been in the Irish currency of the time, the Irish Punt. When indexing such values to present value, they firstly need to be converted to Euro by multiplying by 1.27 and then indexing to present value.

The absence of indexation relief for transactions on assets acquired since 2003 means that the headline rate of 33% is not directly comparable and is higher than would otherwise be the case in jurisdictions where inflation is taken into account.

The tax rate is 23% on certain investment policies, and rises to 40% on certain offshore gains when they are not declared in time.

Tax on capital gains arising in the first eleven months of the year must be paid by 15 December, and tax on capital gains arising in the last month of the year must be paid by the following 31 January.

===Israel===
The capital gains tax in Israel is set at 25% of the real gains derived from the sale of securities (30% for a substantial shareholder). Non-inflation indexed bonds are taxed nominally at 15% (or 20% for a substantial shareholder).

===Italy===
Capital gains tax of corporate income tax 27.5% (IRES) on gains derived from disposals of participations and extraordinary capital gains. For individuals (IRPEF), capital gains shall incur a 26% tax.

===Japan===
In Japan, from 1989 to 2003, there were two options for paying tax on capital gains from the sale of listed stocks. The first, , taxed all proceeds (regardless of profit or loss) at 1.05%. The second method, declaring proceeds as , required individuals to declare 26% of proceeds on their income tax statement. Many traders in Japan used both systems, declaring profits on the Withholding Tax system and losses as taxable income, minimizing the amount of income tax paid.

In 2003, Japan scrapped the system above in favor of a flat 20% tax on gains, though the rate was temporarily halved at 10% and after being postponed a few times the return to the normal rate of 20% is now set for 2014. Losses can be carried forward for three years. Starting in 2009, losses can alternatively be deducted from dividend income declared as &quot;Separate Income&quot; since the tax rate on both categories is equal (i.e., 20% temporarily halved to 10%). Aggregating profits and dividends to reach a single figure taxed at the same rate is fairly innovative.

===Kenya===
Capital gains taxes were abolished in Kenya in 1985 to spur growth in the securities and property market. The Kenyan Parliament passed a motion in August 2014 to reintroduce capital gains tax in January 2015 and &quot;is expected to increase the cost of land transaction as investors pass on the cost to buyers. The tax will also affect those investing in shares and debt in the capital markets.&quot; The capital gains tax came into effect on 1 January 2015 with 5% as the general applicable tax rate.

===Latvia===
As of 1 January 2018 the new corporate income tax act is applicable, according to which the company&#x27;s profit is taxable at a rate of 20% only upon the distribution of profits. In general the capital gain arising on the disposal of a capital asset is treated as an ordinary income and is subject to a 20% corporate income tax only, when the profit is distributed.

A Latvian company can reduce the tax base by the capital gains the company has earned from the sale of shares, if the Latvian company has held those shares for at least 36 months. If a Latvian holding company sells the shares which it has owned for less than three years, the company should not pay tax at the moment of the sale (but when the capital gain is distributed). However, if the company has held the shares for three years or more, the company can distribute the capital gains as dividends tax-free (except, real estate companies).

Personal income tax like dividends, interest and income from life insurance contracts and private pension funds are taxed at 10%. Capital gains on the disposal of capital assets (such as real estate, shares and bonds) are taxed at 20%.

===Lithuania===
Capital gains in Lithuania are taxed as a general taxable income, therefore personal income tax or corporate income tax apply. As of 2021, 15% tax rate is applied for the disposal of securities and sale of property.

===Malaysia===
As of January 1, 2024, Malaysia has implemented a Capital Gains Tax (CGT), marking a significant shift in its tax regime. The tax applies primarily to unlisted shares in Malaysian companies and foreign capital assets, with specific exemptions and rates.

Key Highlights:

# Scope of Taxation:
#* CGT applies to unlisted shares in Malaysian companies and gains from foreign assets brought into Malaysia.
#* Disposals of unlisted shares between January 1 and February 29, 2024, are exempt, making the effective start date March 1, 2024.
# Tax Rates:
#* For assets acquired before January 1, 2024: Tax is either 10% on chargeable income or 2% on the gross disposal price.
#* For assets acquired on or after January 1, 2024: Taxed at 10% of chargeable income.
#* Gains from foreign capital assets are taxed at prevailing income tax rates when received in Malaysia.
# Filing and Compliance:
#* Tax returns must be submitted electronically via the MyTax portal within 60 days of disposal.
#* A Tax Identification Number and Digital Certificate are required for filing.
# Exemptions:
#* Unit trusts are exempt from CGT and income tax on foreign-sourced income until 2028 and 2026, respectively.
#* Real Property Gains Tax (RPGT) continues to apply separately to property transactions.

This move broadens Malaysia’s tax base and aligns with global tax standards, particularly for foreign capital gains. It signifies the government’s effort to enhance revenue streams while maintaining clarity and exemptions for specific entities.

===Mexico===
There is 10% tax rate for profits in the stock market in Mexico.

===Moldova===
Under the Moldovan Tax Code a capital gain is defined as the difference between the acquisition and the disposition price of the capital asset. Only this difference (i.e. the gain) is taxable. The applicable rate is half (1/2) of the income tax rate, which is 12% for individuals and companies after the changes to the tax code from 1 October 2018. Thus, the current capital gains tax is 6% for both individuals and companies. Earlier, between 2008 and 2011, this tax stood at 0% for companies, as the corporate income tax rate has been lowered to 0% to attract foreign investments and to boost the economy.

Not all types of assets are &quot;capital assets&quot;. Capital assets include: real estate; shares; stakes in limited liability companies etc.

=== Montenegro ===
In Montenegro, capital gains are included in taxable income and are subject to the standard 9% corporate tax rate. They are calculated in accordance with the tax rules and can only be offset against capital losses.

=== Morocco ===
In Morocco, capital gains made from the sale of properties by individuals are taxable with a flat tax rate of 20% of the capital gains. The taxed amount must be higher than 3% of the selling price of the property.

An exemption from the individual income tax in the case of making capital gains by selling a property is applicable if the property is used as a principal residence for a duration of at least six years.

===Nepal===
In Nepal, Capital Gain Tax refers to gain occurred on the sale of any assets or properties. Since 17 July 2021, the Government of Nepal has introduced the Long Term Tax and Short Term Tax on the gain after sale of shares. For individuals, the Long Term Tax rate is 5% of the gain after deduction of brokerage and commission and the Short Term Tax rate is 7.5% of the gain after deduction of brokerage and commission.

===Netherlands===
Capital gains generally are exempt from tax. However, exceptions apply to the following assets:

* Capital gains realised on the disposal of business assets (including real estate) and on the disposal of other assets that qualify as income from independently performed activities;
* Capital gains on liquidation of a company;
* Capital gains derived from the sale of a substantial interest in a company (that is, 5% of the issued share capital).

Taxable income under Box 2 category includes dividends and capital gains from a substantial shareholding (inkomsten uit aanmerkelijk belang) (i.e. a shareholding of at least 5%). Income that falls into the Box 2 category is taxed at a flat rate of 25%.

Box 3: taxable income from savings and investments (viz. real estate). However a &quot;theoretical capital yield&quot; of 4% is taxed at a rate of 30% (so 1.2%) but only if the savings plus stocks of a person exceed a threshold of 25.000 euros. This will be raised to a threshold of 30.000 euros in 2018, together with other changes so that people with less wealth, pay lower taxes.

In general an individual will not have to pay tax on capital gains. So if the main residence is sold or shares are sold the profit is not taxable. This is different if the transaction(s) exceed(s) normal asset management. In that case the capital gain is treated as income from other activities or even business income.
Relevant are:

* the number of transactions – the more transactions the sooner it is assumed that activities exceed normal asset management;
* specific knowledge of the individual – if the individual is a professional trader, the personal transactions will be seen as taxable income sooner than if the individual does not have specific knowledge or experience;
* work which is invested in the asset – if maintenance of a property is taken care of by an external party the activities may be seen as normal asset management, if the owner does all the maintenance himself and even the renovations the tax authorities will argue that this is no longer normal asset management.

So it depends on the actual facts and circumstances how the capital gain is treated. Even judges do not always decide the same.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand has no capital gains tax, however income tax may be charged on profits from the sale of personal property and land that was acquired for the purposes of resale. This tax is often avoided and not usually enforced, perhaps due to the difficulty in proving intent at the time of purchase. However, there were a few cases of the IRD enforcing the law; in 2004 the government gathered $106.6 million checking on property sales from Queenstown, Wanaka and some areas of Auckland.

Generally profits from frequent stock trading will be deemed taxable income.

In a speech delivered on 3 June 2009, New Zealand Treasury Secretary John Whitehead called for a capital gains tax to be included in reforms to New Zealand&#x27;s taxation system. The introduction of a capital gains tax was proposed by the Labour Party as an election campaign strategy in the 2011 and 2014 general elections.

On 17 May 2015, the Fifth National Government announced it would tighten rules for taxing profits on the sale of property. From 1 October 2015, any person selling a residential property within two years of purchase would be taxed on the profits at their marginal income tax rate. This is known as the bright line test. The seller&#x27;s main home is exempt, as well as properties inherited from deceased estates or transferred as part of a relationship settlement. To help enforcement, all buyers need to supply their IRD number at settlement. Shortly after taking office in 2017, the new Labour government extended the bright line test threshold first from two years to five years, and later to ten years.

In mid-February 2019, the Labour-led Coalition government&#x27;s independent Tax Working Group recommended implementing a capital gains tax to lower the personal tax rate and to target &quot;polluters&quot;. This proposed tax would cover assets such as land, shares, investment properties, business assets and intellectual property but would exclude family homes, cars, boats, and art. The Working Group proposed setting a top tax rate of 33%. The Working Group&#x27;s chairman Cullen claimed that the capital gains tax would raise NZ$8.3 billion over the next five years, which would be invested into increased social security benefits. In mid-April 2019, the Coalition government announced that it would not be implementing a capital gains tax, citing the inability of members of the governing coalition to reach a consensus on capital gains taxation.

===Norway===
The individual capital gains tax in Norway is 22% (2019). Gains from certain investment vehicles like stocks and bonds are multiplied by 1.44 before calculating tax, resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.68%. In most cases, there is no capital gains tax on profits from sale of one&#x27;s principal home. This tax was introduced in 2006 through a reform that eliminated the &quot;RISK-system&quot;, which intended to avoid the double taxation of capital. The new shareholder model, introduced in 2006, aims to reduce the difference in taxation of capital and labor by taxing dividends beyond a certain level as ordinary income. This means that focus was moved from capital to individuals and their level of income. This system also introduced a deductible allowance equal to the share&#x27;s acquisition value times the average rate for Treasury bills with a 3-month period adjusted for tax. Shielding interest shall secure financial neutrality in that it returns the taxpayer what he or she alternatively would have achieved in a safe, passive capital placement exempt from additional taxation. The main purpose of the allowance is to prevent adverse shifts in investment and corporate financing structure as a result of the dividend tax. According to the papers explaining the new policy, a dividend tax without such shielding could push up the pressures on the rate of return on equity investments and lead Norwegian investors from equities to bonds, property etc.

===Pakistan===
Capital Gains Tax (CGT) in Pakistan is levied on the profit from selling capital assets, which include property, jewelry, artwork, and collectibles, securities excluding stock-in-trade, depreciable assets, and personal-use items, as defined by the Income Tax Ordinance 2001.The gain is determined by subtracting the asset’s adjusted cost—factoring in purchase price and allowable improvements—from the sale proceeds. Tax rates vary by asset type, holding period, and the taxpayer’s filing status, with, for example, listed securities acquired on or after 1 July 2013 generally taxed at 15%, while gains on immovable property (acquired before July 01, 2024) are subject to a sliding scale that favors longer holding periods. Properties acquired after July 1, 2024 are subject to fix rate of 15%. Assets hold for personal use or exempt from Capital Gains Tax, however gold along with other precious items are categorized as a taxable asset in Pakistan, subject to capital gains tax under Sections 37(5)(d) and 38(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance. Capital gains tax other than from securities, stocks and immovable properties are charged with an individual tax slabs for upto 45%.

===Philippines===

There is a 6% Capital Gains Tax and a 1.5% Documentary Stamps on the disposal of real estate in the Philippines. While the Capital Gain Tax is imposed on the gains presumed to have been realized by the seller from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of capital assets located in the Philippines, including other forms of conditional sale, the Documentary Stamp Tax is imposed on documents, instruments, loan agreements and papers evidencing the acceptance, assignment, sale or transfer of an obligation, rights, or property incident thereto. These two taxes are imposed on the actual price the property has been sold, or on its current Market Value, or on its Zonal Value whichever is higher. Zonal valuation in the Philippines is set by its tax collecting agency, the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Most often, real estate transactions in the Philippines are being sealed higher than their corresponding Market and Zonal values.
As a standard process, the Capital Gain Tax is paid for by the seller, while the Documentary Stamp is paid for by the buyer. However, either of the two parties may pay both taxes depending on the agreement they entered into.

Tax Rates:
For real property
*6%, higher of fair market value (zonal or assessed value) and selling price
For Shares of Stocks Not Traded in the Stock Exchange
*15%, net of tax basis and directly attributable cost

===Poland===
Since 2002 there is one flat tax rate (19%) on capital income. It includes: selling stocks, bonds, mutual funds shares and also interests from bank deposits. The tax was introduced by Marek Belka when acting as the Finance Minister and therefore is informally called the &quot;Belka tax&quot; (pl. &quot;podatek Belki&quot;).

===Portugal===
There is a capital gains tax on sale of home and property. Any capital gain (&quot;mais-valia&quot;) arising is taxable as income. For residents this is on a sliding scale from 12 to 40%. However, for residents the taxable gain is reduced by 50%. Proven costs that have increased the value during the last five years can be deducted. For non-residents, the capital gain is taxed at a uniform rate of 25%. The capital gain which arises on the sale of own homes or residences, which are the elected main residence of the taxpayer or his family, is tax free if the total profit on sale is reinvested in the acquisition of another home, own residence or building plot in Portugal.

In 1986 and 1987 Portuguese corporations changed their capital structure by increasing the weight of equity capital. This was particularly notorious on quoted companies. In these two years, the government set up a large number of tax incentives to promote equity capital and to encourage the quotation on the Lisbon Stock Exchange. Until 2010, for stock held for more than twelve months the capital gain was exempt. The capital gain of stock held for shorter periods of time was taxable on 10%.

From 2010 onwards, for residents, all capital gain of stock above €500 is taxable on 20%. Investment funds, banks and corporations are exempted of capital gain tax over stock.

As of 2013, it is 28%.

===Romania===
In Romania, the net capital gain is subject to income tax at the flat rate of 10%. The taxable amount is calculated based on the difference between the sale price and the acquisition price of the shares. In general, broker/transaction fees in connection with the acquisition or sale are tax deductible.

The individual has to report any sale of shares (i.e. capital gain/loss) through the annual return by 25 May of the year following the one in which the sale was performed and pay the related taxes, based on a self-assessment made considering the information reflected in the annual return, within the same reporting deadline (i.e. 25 May). The health insurance contribution (10%, capped) is also due if the total yearly income from capital gains, alone or together with other categories of income reaches the annual threshold of 12 minimum gross salaries (30600 RON, approx. €6100 as of 2022).

===Russia===
There is no separate tax on capital gains; rather, gains or gross receipt from sale of assets are absorbed into income tax base. Taxation of individual and corporate taxpayers is distinctly different:
* Capital gains of individual taxpayers are tax free if the taxpayer owned the asset for at least three years. If not, gains on sales of real estate and securities are absorbed into their personal income tax base and taxed at 13% (residents) and 30% (non-residents). A tax resident is any individual residing in the Russian Federation for more than 183 days in the past year.
* Capital gains of resident corporate taxpayers operating under the &quot;general tax framework&quot; are taxed as ordinary business profits at the common rate of 20%, regardless of the ownership period. Small businesses operating under the &quot;simplified tax framework&quot; pay tax not on capital gains, but on gross receipts at 6% or 15%.
* Dividends that may be included into gains on disposal of securities are taxed at source at 13% (residents) and 15% (non-residents) for either corporate or individual taxpayers.

===Serbia===
Capital gains are subject to a 15% tax for residents and 20% for nonresidents (based on the tax assessment).

===Slovakia===
Individuals pay 19% or 25% capital gains tax. They are also required to pay 14% health insurance from capital gains.

=== Slovenia ===
Individuals pay tax at a tax rate of 27.5%. However, for every five years of ownenership, the rate is reduced: 20% (after five years), 15% (after ten years), 10% (after fifteen years); after twenty years there is no tax. Exception is a tax rate of 40% which applies only to profit on the disposal of derivative in less than one year after purchasing it.

===South Africa===
For legal persons in South Africa, 80% of their net profit will attract CGT and for natural persons 40%. This portion of the net gain will be taxed at their marginal tax rate. As an effective tax rate this means a maximum effective rate of 18% (45% maximum marginal tax rate) for individuals is payable, and for corporate taxpayers a maximum of 22.4%. The annual individual and special trust exemption is R40 000.

===South Korea===
For individuals holding less than 3% of listed company, there is only 0.3% trade tax for sales of shares. Exchange traded funds are exempt from any trade tax. For larger than 3% shareholders of listed companies or for sales of shares in any unlisted company, capital gains tax in South Korea is 11% for tax residents for sales of shares in small- and medium-sized companies. Rates of 22% and 33% apply in certain other situations. Those who have been resident in Korea for less than five years are exempt from capital gains tax on foreign assets.

Realised capital losses can be offset against future capital gains for up to 4 years following the year of realisation.
===Sri Lanka===
Currently, there is no capital gains tax in Sri Lanka.

===Sweden===
Capital gains tax in Sweden is up to 30% on realized capital income.

There is no capital gains tax on net capital gains made in an ISK (Investeringssparkonto or &quot;Investor Savings Account&quot;), but no offsetting or writing off of capital losses against other income either. Instead, ISK&#x27;s are taxed yearly as 30% of the assumed gains which is determined based on the current interest levels. As of 2021, the tax is at the minimum level of 0,375% of the total account balance.

===Switzerland===
&quot;Securities:&quot;

There is generally no capital gains tax in Switzerland for natural persons on trades of securities.

The exception are persons considered to be &quot;professional traders&quot;. The decision to classify a person as such is made subjectively on a case-by-case basis by the tax authorities. However, it is rather infrequent and there is a set of safe harbour criteria which guarantee non-professional status:
* holding each security for at least 6 months,
* low trading volume: sum of buying prices and sale proceeds is less than 500% of capital at the beginning of the year,
* realized capital gains make up less than 50% of income during the tax year,
* no use of foreign capital, or the interest paid on it is less than the dividend income,
* derivatives (especially options) are used solely to safeguard own portfolio risk.

Violating any of them does not automatically result in professional trader status, but may prompt a tax authority to look into individual circumstances and argue for such a status. Professional traders are treated as self-employed persons for tax purposes: realized capital gains are taxed as individual income from self-employment activity and are subject to social contributions (AHV, currently at 10.55% rate for self-employed); capital losses may get deducted from income over the course of up to 7 next years.

For companies, capital gains are taxed as ordinary income at corporate rates.

&quot;Real estate:&quot;

Capital gains tax is levied on the sale of real estate property in all cantons. Taxation rules vary significantly by canton.

For natural persons, the tax generally follows a separate progression from income taxes, diminishes with number of years held, and often can be postponed in cases like inheritance or for buying a replacement home. The tax is levied by canton or municipality only; there is no tax at the federal level. However, natural persons involved in real estate trading in a professional manner may be treated as self-employed and taxed at higher rates similarly to a company and, additionally, social contributions would then need to be paid.

For companies, capital gains are taxed as ordinary income at the federal level, and at the cantonal and municipal level, depending on the canton, either as ordinary income or at a special lower tax progression, as for natural persons.

===Taiwan===
There is no separate capital gains tax in Taiwan. Capital gains are usually taxed as ordinary income. Prior to 1 January 2016, there was a capital gains tax on securities.

No tax is collected from individual investors whose annual transactions are below T$1 billion ($33 million). Transactions above T$1 billion will be charged with a 0.1 percent tax.

===Thailand===
There is no separate capital gains tax in Thailand. If capital gains arise outside of Thailand and the gains are not transferred back to Thailand in the same year it is not taxable. All earned income in Thailand from capital gains is taxed the same as regular income. However, if individual earns capital gain from security in the Stock Exchange of Thailand, it is exempted from personal income tax.

===Turkey===
==== Individual taxation ====

Residence: Individuals who are in Turkey for a continuous period (including temporary absences) of more than six
months in any calendar year are deemed to be resident for tax purposes. However, foreign individuals who are on
assignment in Turkey for a specific business project or mission, or those in Turkey for holiday, health care, or educational
purposes are not regarded as resident, even if they stay for more than six months.

Basis: Residents are taxed on worldwide income; nonresidents are taxed only on Turkish-source income.

==== Withholding tax ====
Dividends: No withholding tax is imposed on dividends paid to a resident company. Dividends paid to a resident or
nonresident individual, or a nonresident company, are subject to a 15% withholding tax, unless the rate is reduced under
a tax treaty.

Interest: No withholding tax is imposed on interest paid to residents. Interest on loans payable to a foreign state,
international institution, foreign bank, or a foreign corporation that qualifies as a “financial entity” is subject to a 0%
withholding tax. A 10% rate applies to interest paid on loans from other nonresident entities and individuals, unless the
rate is reduced under a tax treaty.

Royalties: No withholding tax is imposed on royalties paid to a resident company. A 20% withholding tax is imposed on

=== Uganda ===
Uganda taxes capital gains as part of gross income.

=== Ukraine ===
Ukraine introduced capital-gains taxes on property sales from 1 January 2006.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Authorities in the UAE have reported considering the introduction of capital-gains taxes on property transactions and on property-based securities.

===United Kingdom===
====History====
Channon observes that one of the primary drivers to the introduction of CGT in the UK was the rapid growth in property values post World War II. This led to property developers deliberately leaving office blocks empty so that a rental income could not be established and greater capital gains made. The capital gains tax system was therefore introduced by chancellor James Callaghan in 1965.

====Basics====
Individuals who are residents or ordinarily residents in the United Kingdom (and trustees of various trusts), who are on the basic tax rate are subject to capital gains tax of 18% on profits from residential property, and 10% on gains from all other chargeable assets.

For higher rate taxpayers, the rate is 28% on profits from residential property, and 20% on everything else.

There are exceptions such as for principal private residences, holdings in individual savings accounts or gilts. Certain other gains are allowed to be rolled over upon re-investment. Investments in some start up enterprises are also exempt from CGT. Entrepreneurs&#x27; relief allows a lower rate of CGT (10%) to be paid by people who have been involved for a year with a trading company and have a 5% or more shareholding.

Shares in companies with trading properties are eligible for entrepreneurs&#x27; relief, but not investment properties.

In the 2021–22 tax year, taxpayers can make £12,300 in capital gains before they have to pay any tax – and couples can pool their allowance. This is the same as it was the year before.

====Corporate notes====

Companies are subject to corporation tax on their &quot;chargeable gains&quot; (the amounts of which are calculated along the lines of capital gains tax in the United Kingdom). Companies cannot claim taper relief, but can claim an indexation allowance to offset the effect of inflation. A corporate substantial shareholdings exemption was introduced on 1 April 2002 for holdings of 10% or more of the shares in another company (30% or more for shares held by a life assurance company&#x27;s long-term insurance fund). This is effectively a form of UK participation exemption. Almost all of the corporation tax raised on chargeable gains is paid by life assurance companies taxed on the I minus E basis.

The rules governing the taxation of capital gains in the United Kingdom for individuals and companies are contained in the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.

====Background to changes to 18% rate====
In the Chancellor&#x27;s October 2007 Autumn Statement, draft proposals were announced that would change the applicable rates of CGT as of 6 April 2008. Under these proposals, an individual&#x27;s annual exemption will continue but taper relief will cease and a single rate of capital gains tax at 18% will be applied to chargeable gains. This new single rate would replace the individual&#x27;s marginal (Income Tax) rate of tax for CGT purposes. The changes were introduced, at least in part, because the UK government felt that private equity firms were making excessive profits by benefiting from overly generous taper relief on business assets.

The changes were criticised by a number of groups including the Federation of Small Businesses, who claimed that the new rules would increase the CGT liability of small businesses and discourage entrepreneurship in the UK. At the time of the proposals there was concern that the changes would lead to a bulk selling of assets just before the start of the 2008–09 tax year to benefit from existing taper relief. Capital Gains Tax rose to 28% on 23 June 2010 at 00:00.

On 6 April 2016, new lower rates of 10% (for basic taxpayers) and 20% (for higher taxpayers) were introduced for non-property disposals.

====Historical====
Individuals paid capital gains tax at their highest marginal rate of income tax (0%, 10%, 20% or 40% in the tax year 2007/8) but from 6 April 1998 were able to claim a &quot;taper relief&quot; which reduced the amount of a gain that is subject to capital gains tax (thus reducing the effective rate of tax) depending on whether the asset is a &quot;business asset&quot; or a &quot;non-business asset&quot; and the length of the period of ownership. Taper relief provided up to a 75% reduction (leaving 25% taxable) in taxable gains for business assets, and 40% (leaving 60% taxable), for non-business assets, for an individual. Taper relief replaced indexation allowance for individuals, which could still be claimed for assets held prior to 6 April 1998 from the date of purchase until that date, but was itself abolished on 5 April 2008.

===United States===
In the United States, with certain exceptions, individuals and corporations pay income tax on the net total of all their capital gains. Short-term capital gains are taxed at a higher rate: the ordinary income tax rate. The tax rate for individuals on &quot;long-term capital gains&quot;, which are gains on assets that have been held for over one year before being sold, is lower than the ordinary income tax rate, and in some tax brackets there is no tax due on such gains.

The tax rate on long-term gains was reduced in 1997 via the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 from 28% to 20% and again in 2003, via the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, from 20% to 15% for individuals whose highest tax bracket is 15% or more, or from 10% to 5% for individuals in the lowest two income tax brackets (whose highest tax bracket is less than 15%). (See progressive tax.) The reduced 15% tax rate on qualified dividends and capital gains, previously scheduled to expire in 2008, was extended through 2010 as a result of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act signed into law by President Bush on 17 May 2006, which also reduced the 5% rate to 0%. Toward the end of 2010, President Obama signed a law extending the reduced rate on eligible dividends until the end of 2012.

The law allows for individuals to defer capital gains taxes with tax planning strategies such as the structured sale (ensured installment sale), charitable trust (CRT), installment sale, private annuity trust, a 1031 exchange, or an opportunity zone. The United States, unlike almost all other countries, taxes its citizens (with some exceptions) on their worldwide income no matter where in the world they reside. U.S. citizens therefore find it difficult to take advantage of personal tax havens. Although there are some offshore bank accounts that advertise as tax havens, U.S. law requires reporting of income from those accounts, and willful failure to do so constitutes tax evasion.

==Deferring or reducing capital gains tax==
Taxpayers may defer capital gains taxes by simply deferring the sale of the asset.

Depending on the specifics of national tax law, taxpayers may be able to defer, reduce, or avoid capital gains taxes using the following strategies:

*A nation may tax at a lower rate the gains on investments in favored industries or sectors, such as small business.
*Tax can be reduced when property ownership is transferred to family members in the low-income bracket. In the U.S., if in the year of selling the property your family member falls within the 10% to 12% ordinary income tax bracket, he or she could avoid the capital gains tax entirely.
*There may be accounts with tax-favored status. The most advantageous let gains accumulate in the account without taxes; however, taxes may be owed when the taxpayer withdraws funds from the account.
*Selling an asset at a loss may create a &quot;tax loss&quot; that can be applied to offset gains realized in the future, and avoid or reduce taxes on those gains. Tax losses are a business asset, but the business must avoid &quot;sham&quot; transactions, such as selling to oneself or a subsidiary for no legitimate purpose other than to create a tax loss.
*Tax may be waived if the asset is given to a charity.
*Tax may be deferred if the taxpayer sells the asset but receives payment from the buyer over a period of years. However, the taxpayer bears the risk of a default by the buyer during that period. A structured sale or purchase of an annuity may be ways to defer taxes.
*In certain transactions, the basis (original cost) of the asset is changed. In the U.S., the basis for an inherited asset becomes its value at the time of the inheritance.
*Tax may be deferred if the seller of an asset puts the funds into the purchase of a &quot;like-kind&quot; asset. In the U.S., this is called a 1031 exchange and is now generally available only for business-related real estate and tangible property.
*Tax may be deferred if the capital gain income is reinvested into certain geographic areas. In the U.S., the Opportunity Zone program was created to &quot;recycle capital into the economy that would otherwise be &#x27;frozen&#x27; in place due to investors&#x27; reluctance to trigger capital gains taxes&quot; and &quot;bring investment and development to lower income areas that do not otherwise receive a great deal of attention&quot;.

<text>VEISHEA (pronounced &quot;VEE-sha&quot;) was an annual week-long celebration held each spring on the campus of Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. The celebration featured a parade and many open-house demonstrations of the university facilities and departments. Campus organizations exhibited products and technologies and held fund raisers for various charity groups. In addition, VEISHEA brought speakers, lecturers, and entertainers to Iowa State. Throughout its over eight-decade history it hosted such guests as Bob Hope, John Wayne, Presidents Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan, and Lyndon Johnson, and performers Diana Ross, Mike Jones (rapper), Billy Joel, Sonny and Cher, the Goo Goo Dolls, The Tony Bruno Band, and The Black Eyed Peas. VEISHEA was the largest student run festival in the nation, bringing in tens of thousands of visitors to the campus each year.

A 2014 disturbance led ISU President Steven Leath to suspend VEISHEA, and in August 2014 Leath announced that VEISHEA was being permanently discontinued with the VEISHEA name being retired.

The name of the festival was an acronym for the colleges of the university that existed when the festival was founded in 1922:
* Veterinary Medicine
* Engineering
* Industrial Science
* Home Economics
* Agriculture.

The &quot;Iowa State Daily&quot;, the university&#x27;s student newspaper, has spelled VEISHEA as an acronym and as a word, with only the first letter capitalized. Official university paraphernalia regarding the event still put it in full caps, per the trademark owned by VEISHEA and maintained by Iowa State University Trademark Licensing.

==Beginning and history==
In the early 1900s, the campus of what was then known as Iowa State College was host to multiple events in the spring, as each college celebrated its history and recruited prospective students by holding an individual celebration—such as the Ag Carnival, the Home Economists&#x27; &quot;HEC Day,&quot; and the Engineers&#x27; St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade. In 1922 it was decided that by combining the separate celebrations, it would be possible to preserve tradition without students taking time off from several consecutive weeks of class. Additionally, a large celebration would be a more effective advertisement for the university than several small celebrations. Professor Frank &quot;Shorty&quot; Paine conceptualized the name &quot;VEISHEA&quot; in order to allow the combined celebration to pay homage to each of the colleges and celebrations from which it was born.

VEISHEA was since its inception, a wholly student run event. The first VEISHEA Central Committee, led by Wallace McKee of the class of 1922 met in Beardshear Hall, since the Memorial Union (where student organization offices are currently housed) was not yet built. After months of planning, the first VEISHEA was held May 11–13, 1922. The event managed to combine highlights of each college celebration into one showcase of the entire Iowa State College. Longstanding traditions which became part of VEISHEA included the May Queen pageant, the knighting of senior Engineering students into the Knights of the Order of St. Patrick, and the traditional vaudeville show of the Ag Carnival. Other events included 33 department open houses, a mock battle hosted by the ROTC, a parade themed &quot;History of Iowa State as it is Today,&quot; and the student written and performed &quot;Nite Show,&quot; titled &quot;Scandals of 1922.&quot;

==Traditions==
 VEISHEA encompassed many of the same traditions and ideals embodied in the original 1922 celebration, as well as newer traditions focused on celebrating the Iowa State community. Some of these traditions included:
* VEISHEA Village – VEISHEA Saturday was host to open houses, a cultural festival, an international food fair, and carnival games for children all grouped under the banner of VEISHEA Village. Booths on campus included demonstrations of science and agriculture, refreshments, and entertainment. All together, over 80 departments, clubs, and student groups participated in VEISHEA .
* Stars Over VEISHEA – Originally a yearly student-written musical called the &quot;Nite Show&quot;, in 1930 the directors decided to transition to instead perform Broadway classics. The show was then moved outside to Clyde Willams field in 1939 and renamed &quot;Stars Over VEISHEA&quot; (or SOV). In later years SOV became a joint production of VEISHEA and Iowa State Theatre, so the show was no longer produced and directed by students, but students still participated in all aspects of the show&#x27;s planning and performance.
* Parade – What began in 1922 as a parade of floats built by departmental clubs. blossomed into one of the highlights of the VEISHEA celebration, with attendance estimates sometimes reaching as high as 75,000 people. The later manifestation of the parade includes balloons, student groups, marching bands, and dancers, as well as the traditional floats. The parade was led by the Grand Marshal, who is traditionally a distinguished guest.
* Swans – In 1935, the VEISHEA Central Committee donated a pair of swans to Lake LaVerne, the lake at the base of the Memorial Union. After a naming contest, they were christened Lancelot and Elaine. More than 70 years later, Lancelot and Elaine (albeit different swans) continue to be a fixture on campus. For this reason, the swan was one of VEISHEA&#x27;s symbols, and was represented in the current VEISHEA logo.
* Cherry pies – A tradition older than VEISHEA itself, the Division of Home Economics began selling cherry pies as a fundraiser in 1919. Now sponsored by the Department of Apparel, Events, &amp; Hospitality Management, approximately 12,000 cherry pies were made and sold each year, with the money going to support departmental scholarships.

==Problems==
In later years, rioting and disturbances tarnished the VEISHEA celebration. Riots marred the event in 1988, 1992 and 1994. During the 1997 VEISHEA festival, Harold &quot;Uri&quot; Sellers, a VEISHEA visitor was murdered in a stabbing on the front lawn at Adelante Fraternity by another VEISHEA visitor, Michael Runyan.

In 2004 a riot occurred during the early morning hours of April 18 after Ames Police dispersed about 400 people at a nuisance party. This crowd grew, intensified, and eventually became violent, ultimately causing over $250,000 in damage to public and private property.

Following the disturbance, some students made claims that police used excessive force in controlling rioters. However, a nine-month investigation by the Iowa Attorney General&#x27;s office found no wrongdoing on the part of police.

The 2004 riots marred what had been a very successful celebration. On April 27, ISU president Gregory L. Geoffroy announced that VEISHEA would not be held in 2005. This was met with disappointment both on and off campus. One man who had his business damaged had taken out a full-page ad asking the school not to cancel the event. Geoffroy also announced the formation of a task force to study the causes of the riots.

2005 marked the first time in 82 years that VEISHEA was not held.

VEISHEA&#x27;s return in 2006, as well as celebrations in 2007 and 2008, were incident-free. Much of the credit was given to the implementation of new policies recommended by the riot task force, including:
* On Campus Events Events were moved onto campus and away from the flashpoint that was created by the mix of bars and student housing in Campustown.
* Police-Student Relations Police have implemented yearly campaigns to build relationships between students and the police, including running ads and giving out free T-shirts.

In 2014 a riot occurred in the early morning of April 9, with one reported injury. In response, Iowa State president Steven Leath suspended the remainder of the 2014 VEISHEA celebrations and created a task force to discuss the future of VEISHEA.

In early June the task force voted unanimously to recommend ending VEISHEA in its current form. On June 13, 2014, the task force voted to recommend that the school continue to have a “overarching, university-wide event.&quot; However the task force also recommended it not be called VEISHEA.

On August 7, 2014, President Leath announced that VEISHEA would no longer be held, and that the VEISHEA name was being retired. He said that some of the events that had been associated with VEISHEA would likely continue, but the time frame and the content would need to be evaluated.

<text>The Territory of Alabama (sometimes Alabama Territory) was an organized incorporated territory of the United States. The Alabama Territory was carved from the Mississippi Territory on August 15, 1817 and lasted until December 14, 1819, when it was admitted to the Union as the twenty-second state.

==History==
The Alabama Territory[n] was designated by two interdependent Acts of the Congress of the United States, passed by both chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives on March 1 and 3, 1817, but it did not become effective until October 10, 1817. The delay was due to a provision in the Congressional Organic Act passed in Washington, which stated that the act would only take effect if and when the western part of the Mississippi Territory (1798–1817) were to form a state constitution and government on the road to statehood. A state constitution for Mississippi was drawn up and adopted by Mississippian delegates on August 15, 1817, elections were held the next month in September, and the first legislative session convened in October, with the western part of the Mississippi Territory existing since 1798 becoming the State of Mississippi on December 10, 1817.

St. Stephens, located in the central area of the Alabama Territory on the Tombigbee River, was the only territorial capital during the period. William Wyatt Bibb (1781–1820), formerly of Georgia was the only territorial governor, later elected to that position after achieving statehood.

On December 14, 1819, Alabama was admitted to the federal Union as the 22nd state, with appointed territorial governor William W. Bibb (1781-1820), formerly of &amp;Georgia, becoming the elected first state governor (1819–1820).

==Territorial evolution of Alabama==

*Territories of the Kingdom of Spain and its worldwide Spanish Empire that would later become part of the future territories of Alabama:
**La Florida (Spanish Florida), 1565–1763
**Florida Occidental (West Florida), 1783–1821
***Mobile District
*Possession of the Kingdom of Great Britain since 1763, in the Treaty of Paris (1763) ending the French and Indian War (1756–1763), (known as the Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe), until 1783, with the Treaty of Paris (1783) that the lands would later be ceded to become part of the newly independent United States after 1776,
*Organized as the old Southwest Territory or Territory of the Southwest [also then occasionally known as the &quot;Territory South of the Ohio River&quot;] (1790–1796), then later
*Reorganized and renamed as the Mississippi Territory (1798–1817), then the
*Territory of Alabama was carved out of the eastern half in 1817 until 1819:
*West Florida, 1763–1783 (briefly possessed by Britain, acquired from Spain.
*U.S. states that ceded territorial claims that would later become part of the future State of Alabama:
**State of South Carolina, 1787
**State of Georgia, 1802 (sold the disputed Yazoo lands to the U.S. Federal government)
*U.S. territory with land that would later become part of the Territory of Alabama:
**Mississippi Territory, 1798–1817
*U.S. state created from the Alabama Territory, 1817–1819:
**State of Alabama, December 14, 1819 to present

<text>A diminutive is a word obtained by modifying a root word to convey a slighter degree of its root meaning, either to convey the smallness of the object or quality named, or to convey a sense of intimacy or endearment, and sometimes to belittle something or someone. A (abbreviated ) is a word-formation device used to express such meanings. A is a diminutive form with two diminutive suffixes rather than one.

== Purpose ==
Diminutives are often employed as nicknames and pet names when speaking to small children and when expressing extreme tenderness and intimacy to an adult. The opposite of the diminutive form is the augmentative.

In some contexts, diminutives are also employed in a pejorative sense to denote that someone or something is weak or childish. For example, one of the last Western Roman emperors was Romulus Augustus, but his name was diminutivized to &quot;Romulus Augustulus&quot; to express his powerlessness.

== Formation == 
In many languages, diminutives are word forms that are formed from the root word by affixation. In most languages, diminutives can also be formed as multi-word constructions such as &quot;Tiny Tim&quot;, or &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;.

In most languages that form diminutives by affixation, this is a productive part of the language. For example, in Spanish can be a nickname for someone who is overweight, and by adding an suffix, it becomes which is more affectionate. Examples for a double diminutive having two diminutive suffixes are in Polish → → or Italian → → ). 

In English, the alteration of meaning is often conveyed through clipping, making the words shorter and more colloquial. Diminutives formed by adding affixes in other languages are often longer and (as colloquial) not necessarily understood.

While many languages apply a grammatical diminutive to nouns, a few – including Slovak, Dutch, Spanish, Romanian, Latin, Polish, Bulgarian, Czech, Russian and Estonian – also use it for adjectives (in Polish: → → ) and even other parts of speech (Ukrainian → → — to sleep or Slovak → → — to sleep, → — to run). 

Diminutives in isolating languages may grammaticalize strategies other than suffixes or prefixes. In Mandarin Chinese, for example, other than the nominal prefix 小- &quot;xiǎo-&quot; and nominal suffixes -儿/-兒 &quot;-r&quot; and -子 &quot;-zi&quot;, reduplication is a productive strategy, e.g., → and → . In formal Mandarin usage, the use of diminutives is relatively infrequent, as they tend to be considered to be rather colloquial than formal. Some Wu Chinese dialects use a tonal affix for nominal diminutives; that is, diminutives are formed by changing the tone of the word.

For extensive examples of diminutive formation in a variety of languages, see List of diminutives by language.

* &quot;Chuck&quot; from Charles
* &quot;darling&quot; from dear
* &quot;duckling&quot; or &quot;duckie&quot; from duck

<doc id="505896" wikidata="Q795545" url="?curid=505896" title="Indian white-eye">
<text>The Indian white-eye (Zosterops palpebrosus), formerly the Oriental white-eye, is a small species of passerine bird in the white-eye family. It is a resident breeder in open woodland on the Indian subcontinent. They forage in small groups, feeding on nectar and small insects. They are easily identified by the distinctive white eye-ring and overall yellowish upperparts. The range previously extended eastwards to Southeast Asia, Indonesia and Malaysia. Their name was recently changed due to previous members of Zosterops palpebrosus in Southeast Asia being renamed to a new species, making the Indian White-eye a more geographically accurate term for this species.

==Taxonomy==
The Indian white-eye was described by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1824 from a specimen collected in Bengal. He coined the binomial name &quot;Sylvia palpebrosa&quot;. The English and scientific names refer to the conspicuous ring of white feathers round the eyes, &quot;palpebrosus&quot; being Neo-Latin for &quot;having prominent eyelids&quot;, from the Latin &quot;palpebrae&quot; &quot;eyelids&quot;.

The English name of this species was changed from &quot;Oriental white-eye&quot; to &quot;Indian white-eye&quot; to more accurately reflect the geographic range following the reorganisation of the taxa with the introduction of Hume&#x27;s white-eye (&quot;Zosterops auriventer&quot;), the warbling white-eye (&quot;Zosterops japonicus&quot;) and Swinhoe&#x27;s white-eye (&quot;Zosterops simplex&quot;).

==Description==

This bird is small (about 8–9 cm long) with yellowish olive upper parts, a white eye ring, yellow throat and, a vent. The belly is whitish grey but may have yellow in some subspecies. The sexes look similar. The species is widespread and is part of a superspecies complex that includes &quot;Zosterops japonicus&quot;, &quot;Zosterops meyeni&quot; and possibly others. The taxonomy of the group is still unclear with some island populations being distinctive while some subspecies are not well supported. The population from Flores, Indonesia for instance is found closer to the pale white-eye. The family itself is now questioned since they are nested along with the &quot;Stachyris&quot; babblers.

About eleven subspecies are well recognised, these include the nominate form (type locality Bengal, India) which is found from Oman and Arabia, Afghanistan, northern India and extends into China and northern Myanmar. The population in the Western Ghats and hills of southern India is placed in &quot;nilgiriensis&quot; while &quot;salimalii&quot; of the Eastern Ghats hills (Shevaroy, Chitteri, Seshachalam, Nallamalai) is sometimes subsumed into the nominate race. The population of the plains of India, Laccadives and Sri Lanka are sometimes placed in &quot;egregius&quot; (= &quot;egregia&quot;) but is restricted by other works to the population in Sri Lanka. The populations in southern Myanmar, Thailand and Laos are placed in &quot;siamensis&quot;. The Nicobar Islands form is &quot;nicobaricus&quot; and is sometimes also used for the population on the Andaman Islands which are, however, a distinctive and unnamed population. The populations from southern Thailand to western Cambodia are placed in &quot;williamsoni&quot;. Other Southeast Asian island forms include &quot;auriventer&quot; (=&quot;aureiventer&quot;), &quot;buxtoni&quot;, &quot;melanurus&quot; and &quot;unicus&quot;.

Race &quot;occidentis&quot; (now often subsumed into the nominate race) of the Western Himalayas has the upper side dark green and the flanks are tinged in brown. The form &quot;salimalii&quot; has a shorter bill and is brighter yellow-green above. Some authors consider the nominate race to be restricted to Sikkim, Bhutan, Assam and Yunnan and consider the peninsular race as &quot;occidentis&quot; (or &quot;amabilis&quot; if the form from Kathiawar described by Koelz is considered valid).

In Sri Lanka, race &quot;egregia&quot; is smaller and has a brighter back and throat than the endemic Sri Lanka white-eye, &quot;Zosterops ceylonensis&quot; found in the central hills.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is found in a wide range of habitats from scrub to moist forest. They sometimes occur in mangrove areas, such as in the Karachi region, Pakistan, and on islands they may lead a more insectivorous life. They are somewhat rare only in the drier desert regions of western India.

A feral population was detected in San Diego, California, in the 1980s and subsequently eradicated.

==Behaviour and ecology==

These white-eyes are sociable, forming flocks which only separate on the approach of the breeding season. They are highly arboreal and only rarely descend to the ground. The breeding season is February to September but April is the peak breeding season and the compact cup nest is a placed like a hammock on the fork of a branch. The nest is made of cobwebs, lichens and plant fibre. The nest is built in about 4 days and the two pale blue eggs are laid within a couple of days of each other. The eggs hatch in about 10 days. Both sexes take care of brooding the chicks which fledge in about 10 days. 

Though mainly insectivorous, the Indian white-eye will also eat nectar and fruits of various kinds.

They call frequently as they forage and the usual contact call is a soft nasal &quot;cheer&quot;. They pollinate flowers when they visit them for flower insects (such as thrips) and possibly nectar (questioned) that form their diet. The forehead is sometimes coloured by pollen leading to mistaken identifications. They have been observed bathing in dew accumulated on leaves.

When nesting, they may mob palm squirrels but being small birds they are usually on the defensive. Their predators include bats (esp. &quot;Megaderma lyra&quot;) and birds such as the white-throated kingfisher. Endoparasitic Haemosporidia of the genus &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; and &quot;Dorisa&quot; have been isolated from the species although these rarely cause death.

Like some other white-eyes, they sometimes steal nest material from the nests of other birds. Cases of interspecific feeding have been noted with white-eyes feeding the chicks of a paradise flycatcher.

Although not strong fliers, they are capable of dispersing in winds and storms to new areas including offshore islands. A feral population of this species established itself in California during the 1980s requiring their capture and destruction. They were captured by luring them using call playback and live decoys into mistnets.

<text>D&#x27;Youville University (D&#x27;Youville or DYU) is a private university in Buffalo, New York. It was founded as D&#x27;Youville College in 1908 and named by the Grey Nuns after the patroness saint Marie-Marguerite d&#x27;Youville. As of fall 2022 D&#x27;Youville College served 2,518 students and had 54 degree majors the health sciences, business, and liberal arts for undergraduate and graduate students. In February 2022, the New York State Board of Regents approved a name change to D&#x27;Youville University.

== Campus ==
Located in Western New York on the Lower West Side of the City of Buffalo, the campus is in an urban setting a few blocks from the Peace Bridge on the Canadian border. The campus has 15 buildings with classrooms, laboratories, residential and athletics facilities. There are two student housing buildings and one outdoor athletics complex.

D&#x27;Youville is on Porter Ave, one of seven parkways in the Buffalo Olmsted Park System. The Park System was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in 1868, ten years after designing Central Park in New York City.

CannonDesign was retained to develop D&#x27;Youville&#x27;s most recent campus Master Plan and the major priorities of that planning effort are focused toward revitalizing the campus in ways that improve its connection to the Buffalo Olmsted Park System, as well as beautifying the Lower West Side of Buffalo and improving the connectivity and traffic flow through the local neighborhoods. Prior campus planning has also been conducted in collaboration with Stiegliz Snyder Architecture and University at Buffalo&#x27;s Department of Urban and Regional Planning.

== History ==

=== Immigration ===
Marie-Marguerite d&#x27;Youville (1701-1771) was born in Quebec, she married François d’Youville in 1722 and had six children. Following the passing of François, Marguerite was left to raise two young children, after burying her father, her husband, and four of their children. Her desire to serve those in need went against the social conventions of Marguerite’s generation, leading her and three other women to establish the Sisters of Charity in 1737 — a service-oriented organization commonly known as the Grey Nuns. The Sisters of Charity committed themselves to fighting for the rights of the most marginalized of society in Canada. After 1840, the order rapidly expanded, and over the next 100 years became a major provider of health care and other social services throughout Quebec, Western and Northern Canada, and the northern United States.

Following an invitation from the Oblates of Mary Immaculate (O.M.I.), the Grey Nuns moved from Canada to Buffalo, New York in October 1857. Initially, the Grey Nuns lived in a 6-room convent when they opened the Holy Angels School. The school&#x27;s first official building was the Koessler Administration Building, which was built in 1872 but not dedicated and named as such until 2003. The Koessler Administration Building was expanded three times to meet the growing needs of the Grey Nuns. First, east and west wing expansions were constructed in the last 1800s. Then, the Prospect Ave wing was added in 1907.

=== Incorporation ===

D&#x27;Youville was founded as an all-girls Roman Catholic school. The institution was incorporated and filed in the Secretary of State&#x27;s Office on February 13, 1865, under the name, &quot;The Holy Angels Infirmary Academy and Industrial School for Benevolent, Charitable, and Scientific Purposes&quot;. The New York State Legislature granted a charter to become a college on April 8, 1908, being accredited by the University of the State of New York. This initial charter was amended to change the name of incorporation to &quot;D&#x27;Youville College,&quot; after the patroness Saint Marie-Marguerite d&#x27;Youville. D&#x27;Youville was initially founded as an institution focused on education and the liberal arts, with particular emphasis on women, students of immigrant status, and populations that lived in under-resourced communities. In February 2022, the &quot;D&#x27;Youville College&quot; charter was amended again to become &quot;D&#x27;Youville University.&quot; 
On May 12, 1912, D’Youville conferred three Bachelor of Arts degrees to Mary Brennen, Pauline Garnett, and Elizabeth Gosselin, one Master of Arts degree to Helena Sheehan, and one honorary Doctor of Music degree to Elizabeth Cronin. Mary Brennan, of the first graduating class of D’Youville wrote the following to describe D&#x27;Youville at the time of her graduation: “The popular opinion was that girls’ schools were completely impractical, a little sewing, a little painting, some music, enough English and history to enhance your conversation and social graces. D’Youville was far from such. Each girl was given the opportunity to fit herself for the business world, to be a well-educated helpmate as wife and mother. There were excellent courses in languages, in science, mathematics and history taught by superior professors...certainly none in sewing or etiquette.”Over the next several decades objectives of study emphasized the teaching professions and intellectual interests guided students toward extra-curricular activities focusing on dance, music, drama, language, and political debate. The entire student body was 37 in 1912, then enrollment grew from 104 to around 400 students at the end of the 1940s. As the United States entered into WWII, D&#x27;Youville expanded its educational focus to include nursing programs and became the first college to offer baccalaureate degree programs for women in Western New York. Student enrollment continued to grow steadily though the mid-century period. At the same time the population of Buffalo, New York approached its peak of approximately 580,000 people.

=== Mid-century expansion ===

As the U.S. economy bounced back from the great depression in the 1950s, D&#x27;Youville&#x27;s enrollment began increasing and stimulated need for a larger campus. As a result of D’Youville&#x27;s growth during the late 1950s and 1960s, many of the campus buildings possess a mid-century architectural style. 

Six campus buildings were erected between 1956 and 1969, largely driven by the vision and fundraising of Sister Francis Xavier Lynch. The original campus library building was built in 1956. Madonna Hall was built in 1959. Mary Agnes Hall was built in 1964. The Health Science Building was erected in 1966 and is currently referred to as the Dr. Pauline M. Alt Building. The College Center and Gymnasium were constructed in 1969. Marguerite Hall was also constructed in 1969.

D&#x27;Youville remained a women&#x27;s college until 1970, men started being admitted in 1971.

The transition to co-ed was controversial and met with resistance at the time, however, the change was necessary to navigate enrollment declines as many other regional institutions had already transitioned to co-ed before D&#x27;Youville. The financial difficulties surrounding the enrollment decline necessitated the sale of Mary Agnes Hall less than 10 years after it was built, which has since been operated as Mary Agnus Manor, an adult assisted living facility. The purchase of an old laundry mat building adjacent to campus in 1978 was the first evidence that D&#x27;Youville&#x27;s financial situation had stabilized following the co-ed transition.

In 1984, President Ronald Reagan spoke at D&#x27;Youville during a campaign event with the Italian and Polish communities near the end of his first term in office after participating in the dedication of the Santa Maria Towers. This event is referenced as the only visit that President Reagan ever made to Buffalo, New York, and as a result, a memorial service with residents and community leaders was also held at D&#x27;Youville 20 years later when he died in 2004.

=== 21st-century growth ===

A second period of stability and growth occurred around the turn of the century, largely driven by the growing number of Canadian students attracted by a favorable currency exchange rate. D&#x27;Youville enrollment growth was also attributed to the addition of masters and professional health professions degree programs in the 1980s, which expanded the institution&#x27;s focus beyond a liberal arts college. This natural evolution progressed in the early 2000s with the addition of several doctoral degree programs. These major academic changes began the vision of becoming a university, which was formalized by a 2007 board of trustees vote directing administration to request New York State Education Department&#x27;s approval for D&#x27;Youville to be changed from college to university. The pursuit of &#x27;university status&#x27; was achieved in February 2022. 

Renovation and new construction added 6 buildings between 1999 and 2015. In 1999, D&#x27;Youville renovated the Holy Angels School building, built in 1905, to become the Montante Family Library. D&#x27;Youville&#x27;s original library building was demolished in 2000, and the Bauer Family Academic Center was built to replace it in 2001. The 222 Connecticut Street Apartment Complex was built in 2005. The D’Youville Academic Center was built in 2010. The Dobson Athletic Complex and the Dr. Charles and Mary Schweitzer Bauer School of Arts, Science and Education were built in 2015.
=== Recent developments ===
In 2020, D’Youville purchased the Holy Angels Church, Rectory, and Convent, which was adjacent to the campus. The university opened a Health Professions Hub building in June 2021, which includes an inter-professional clinic and laboratory, pharmacy, rehabilitation gym, simulation labs, dietetics kitchen, and events space. D&#x27;Youville is also in process of a larger campus renovation plan, including student service centers, the renovation of active learning classrooms, student residence halls and dining hall renovations, the Kavinoky Theater and the Koessler Administration Building. Renovations to the 4th and 5th floors on the Koessler Administration Building were recognized with the Buffalo Business First Collegiate Brick-by-Brick award in 2021. The Health Profession Hub was recognized by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Buffalo/Western New York with the 2021 highest design honor award. The school was designated as a university in February, 2022.

In 2024, the university featured an AI robot, Sophia, as its commencement speaker. 

== Organization ==
D&#x27;Youville is a non-profit organization with $69.5 million (2018) in expenses that is governed by a 22-member board of trustees. Five of the trustees are elected as officers, including the president of the university. Board members typically serve three 3-year terms.

In July 2016, Sister Denise Roche stepped down from serving as D&#x27;Youville president for 36 years and was succeeded by interim President William Mariani. In December 2016 the Board of Trustees appointed Lorrie Clemo to become the next president. Clemo officially began her appointment in January 2017 as the 15th President of D&#x27;Youville and as the first lay president to lead the institution.

The president works with an administrative cabinet called the president&#x27;s council. D&#x27;Youville also has a faculty senate, a student government association, and an alumni board. The academic departments of the university are organized into 4 academic schools led by deans, including the Patricia H. Garman School of Nursing, School of Health Professions, School of Pharmacy, and School of Science, Arts and Education.

Prior to this change the institution was working 37.5 hours workweeks. The shift to a 4-day workweek started as a 6 month trial technology driven health and wellness initiative, and was then made permanent.

==Student life==

=== Athletics ===


D&#x27;Youville was approved July 2020 to compete at the NCAA Division II level, as a new provisional member of the East Coast Conference (ECC) beginning in the 2020–21 season.

D&#x27;Youville joined the Northeast Conference in Division I for men&#x27;s volleyball in 2022.

D&#x27;Youville previously competed at the NCAA Division III level, as a member of the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference (AMCC) from 2009–10 to 2019–20, and as a member of the North Eastern Athletic Conference (NEAC; now known as the United East Conference) from 2004–05 to 2008–09. D&#x27;Youville will become eligible for Division II national championships in 2023–24. Given that the NCAA operates a single bowling championship open to members of all NCAA divisions, bowling is the only sport that D&#x27;Youville will be eligible for a national championship during their provisional transition period.

As part of the transition to NCAA Division II, D&#x27;Youville announced a change of their mascot&#x27;s identity from the Spartans to the Saints, giving symbolism to the patroness Saint Marie-Marguerite d&#x27;Youville. The new athletics mascot is depicted as a St. Bernard and as part of the rebranding campaign, D&#x27;Youville unveiled a pair of St. Bernard puppies, Maggie and Saint, which now roam the campus as their official mascots.

The athletic department announced the addition of men&#x27;s lacrosse and esports as new sports beginning in 2021–22, bringing the institution to have 16 intercollegiate programs.

=== Student organizations ===
The Student Government Association of D&#x27;Youville consists of an elected senate and an executive council. The Senate is organized into 4 committees: public relations, student outreach, student action, and student engagement. D&#x27;Youville has over 45 campus clubs and organizations which sponsor events, activities and community service.

=== Housing ===
D&#x27;Youville has two student housing buildings. Marguerite Hall is a traditional 12-story housing building consisting primarily of traditional two-person dorm rooms. The 222 Apartment Complex is a four-story housing building primarily consisting of four-bedroom apartment suites each with two bathrooms and a shared kitchen and common room.

=== Media ===
A variety of student-sponsored and institutional-sponsored newspapers, magazines and periodicals have been published at D&#x27;Youville. The &quot;D&#x27;Youville Magazine&quot; was first published in 1910 and ran through the 1960s, primarily serving as an outlet for student papers as well as other literary publications and commentary. The &quot;D&#x27;Youvillian&quot; began in the 1930s and was published through the 1990s, primarily serving as a student yearbook. The &quot;D&#x27;Mensions Magazine&quot; is the alumni periodical that is currently being published.

=== Theatre ===

The 240-seat Kavinoky Theatre on D&#x27;Youville&#x27;s campus was initially built in the early 1900s as an Edwardian recital hall designed for vocal performances, string quartets, and piano recitals. Music was an essential aspect of student life and coursework up until the 1950s, as choir and glee club were two of the most well attended student organizations. 

In the mid-1970s, the recital hall was re-envisioned to become a fully functional professional theatre for plays and musicals. A capital campaign was led by Edward Kavinoky, the board of trustees chairman at the time, to renovate the space and extend the stage to support theatre productions. The theater was dedicated to Edward Kavinoky after his passing in 1977, and the renovations were completed in 1980. The Kavinoky Theatre was renovated again to have new paint, carpet and seating in 2020, partially sponsored by the New York State Council on the Arts. Recently, the Kavinoky Theatre has produced shows such as &quot;To Kill a Mocking Bird,&quot; &quot;Hairspray&quot;, &quot;1984&quot;, &quot;Spamalot&quot;, and &quot;Sweeny Todd&quot;.

=== Public art ===
In 2008, D&#x27;Youville unveiled a -foot bronze statue of Marie-Marguerite d&#x27;Youville created by David Derner in front of the Koessler Administration Building. The statue depicts an orphan girl looking up at d&#x27;Youville, while a cat plays with a key that the girl had just dropped on the ground. The statue plaque highlights d&#x27;Youville&#x27;s life span (1701-1771) and her title &quot;Mother of Universal Charity,&quot; which was given to her by Pope John XXIII in 1959.

On October 11, 2019, in alignment to National Coming Out Day for the LGBTQ+ community, D&#x27;Youville host an inclusivity event named &quot;From the closet to the sidewalk&quot; and unveiled the &quot;As is&quot; mural by Casey Millbrand. According to Millbrand, the public art is intended to represent &quot;individuality, acceptance, and inclusion&quot;.

On June 19, 2020, in alignment to the Juneteenth holiday celebration, D&#x27;Youville unveiled the &quot;Black Matter is Life&quot; mural by Maxx Moses. The mural was positioned adjacent to Millbrand&#x27;s &quot;As is&quot; mural and was intended to address racial justice.

August 12, 2021, to finalize the Health Professions Hub building, &quot;the Tree of Y&quot; mural was painted on the facade by Maya Hayuk. The mural was organized in partnership with the Albright-Knox Art Gallery as part of their Public Art Initiative. The mural is 45 feet high, 95 wide, and used around 95 gallons of paint to complete.

<doc id="505902" wikidata="Q6804993" url="?curid=505902" title="Medaille University">
<text>Medaille University was a private college in Buffalo, New York. The Sisters of St. Joseph founded Medaille in 1937, naming it after their founder, Jean Paul Médaille. It later became nonsectarian and coeducational. The college served roughly 1,600 students, mainly from Western New York and Southern Ontario, during its final years.

In May 2022, the Board of Regents of the New York State Department of Education approved Medaille College&#x27;s request to be designated a university. Due to ongoing financial and enrollment challenges, Medaille announced its closure effective August 31, 2023.

== History ==
The Sisters of St. Joseph opened the Institute of the Sisters of Saint Joseph in 1875. This training center for nuns and other vowed women who wanted to serve the church in education, laid the first foundations for what would later eventually become Medaille College.

Degrees were first offered in 1937. At that time, the school&#x27;s name was Mount Saint Joseph Teachers&#x27; College. In 1964, it became Mount Saint Joseph College and in 1968, Medaille College. Most graduates went on to teach at Catholic schools in New York State.

=== Conflicts over academic freedom ===
In 2002, President John J. Donohue fired tenured professor Therese Dillon Warden and suspended professor Uhuru Watson. In addition, two other non-tenured professors were likewise punished. They all had allegedly passed around confidential meeting minutes from the tenure and promotion committee and were forbidden to enter campus. Many colleagues protested the disciplinary action as a violation of academic freedom. Kenneth Weshues stated that &quot;Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of individuals at the college have been harmed&quot; due to a &quot;social ill that has laid the college low.&quot;

In May 2021, Medaille was sanctioned by the American Association of University Professors for eliminating shared governance with the faculty during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Cancelled acquisition and closure ===
In 2022, Medaille and nearby Trocaire College signed a memorandum of understanding that set &quot;in motion a cooperative agreement that would fulfill the missions of both institutions into the future.&quot; Six buildings on Medaille&#x27;s campus were sold to Trocaire in January 2023 and on April 4, it was announced by interim Medaille President Dr. Lori Quigley that Trocaire College would be acquiring Medaille with a scheduled closing date of July 31, 2023. The university was to become a part of Trocaire, while some sports teams would keep using the Medaille Mavericks name. A month later Trocaire College announced they would no longer be acquiring Medaille.

On May 15, 2023, Medaille University announced that it would close on August 31, 2023 and ceased academic operations on that date. A few months later, Niagara University was named as the legacy school for Medaille, as required by state law, agreeing to hold all of the latter&#x27;s &quot;academic records, student transcripts, and academic catalogs&quot;.

==Campuses==

Medaille&#x27;s main campus was in Buffalo, New York and 40% of the students lived on campus. It was within the Olmsted Crescent, a historic area of parkways and landscape designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. In January 2023, six campus buildings on Medaille&#x27;s Buffalo campus were sold to Trocaire College.

Medaille also had a branch campus in Rochester. This campus offered undergraduate degrees for adult students in business administration, and graduate degrees in business administration and organizational leadership, as well as mental health counseling.

The vast majority of students were from New York State. In 2015, 3% came from out of state.

==Athletics==

Medaille was a charter member of the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference, as an NCAA Division III school.

AMCC Championships:

* Baseball - 2007
* Men’s Basketball - 2008–2009, 2009–2010, 2011–2012, 2014–2015, 2016–2017, 2021-2022
* Women&#x27;s basketball - 2005–06, 2006–07, 2007–08, 2009–2010
* Men&#x27;s soccer - 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010. 
* The 2010 men&#x27;s soccer team reached Sweet 16 in 2010, the furthest any Medaille sports team ever advanced. Also that same year, their undefeated streak in the AMCC of five years was finally snapped. On September 25, 2010, the Franciscan University Barons pulled off a huge upset, winning the match 2–1.

<doc id="505904" wikidata="Q2225715" url="?curid=505904" title="Sri Lanka white-eye">
<text>The Sri Lanka white-eye (Zosterops ceylonensis) is a small passerine bird in the white-eye family, which is endemic to Sri Lanka. It is a resident breeder in forests, gardens and plantations, mainly in the highlands.

== Taxonomy ==
A study showed that it is not sister to the other Sri Lankan species, the Indian White-eye (&quot;Zosterops palpebrosus&quot;), and it also suggested that it is the root species which gave rise to all white-eyes on Earth. This raises further questions on white-eye origins.

==Description==

This bird is slightly larger than the Indian white-eye (about 11 cm long) which it replaces above 4000 ft. The upper parts of the body and sides of neck are dark olive-green. The rump appears paler green while the crown and forehead appear darker. The wings and tail are brown edged with green on the back. The typical ring of tiny white feathers around the eye is present. The lores are dark and there is a dark streak below the eye. The chin, throat and upper breast are greenish-yellow as are the thighs and vent. The belly region is greyish white. The dark bill has a slaty base to the lower mandible. The legs are dark. The iris is yellow to reddish-brown.

This species can be distinguished from the widespread Indian white-eye, &quot;Zosterops palpebrosus&quot;, by its larger size, duller green back and more extensive yellow on the breast. It has a darker patch between the eye and the bill.

It is sociable, forming large flocks which only disperse with the approach of the breeding season. It builds a tree nest and lays 3 unspotted pale blue eggs.

Though mainly insectivorous, the Sri Lankan white-eye will also eat nectar and fruits of various kinds.

The English and scientific names refer to the conspicuous ring of white feathers around the eyes, &quot;Zosterops&quot; being Greek for &quot;girdle-eye&quot;.

==In culture==
In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as &quot;Lanka Sithasiya&quot; in the Sinhala language. This bird appears on a 35c Sri Lankan postage stamp first issued in 1983.

<doc id="505908" wikidata="Q7844818" url="?curid=505908" title="Trocaire College">
<text>Trocaire College is a private Roman Catholic college in Buffalo, New York. Founded in 1958 by the Sisters of Mercy, Trocaire College offers degrees in healthcare, business, and technology. It has an extension site in Williamsville, New York. Total enrollment across both locations is approximately 1,300 students.

==History==
Trocaire was founded in 1958 by the Sisters of Mercy as Sancta Maria College to train women of the order. In 1965 it admitted laywomen and in 1972 enrolled male students. In 1967 the college was renamed &quot;Trocaire College.&quot; The word &quot;Trócaire&quot; means &quot;Mercy&quot; in the Irish language. This is an homage to the religious order which founded the college, the Sisters of Mercy, who were founded in Dublin, Ireland in 1831.

In August 2022, Trocaire and nearby Medaille University signed a cooperative agreement. In January 2023, Trocaire purchased six buildings from Medaille. In April 2023, it was announced by interim Medaille University President Dr. Lori Quigley that Trocaire College would be acquiring Medaille in a merger of both collegiate institutions, planned for July 31, 2023. However, less than a month later, in May 2023, Trocaire College President Bassam Deeb announced they would no longer be acquiring Medaille and that the merger was off.

==Academics==
Trocaire College offers certificate, Associate&#x27;s degree, and Bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in healthcare, business, and technology. It focuses on offering career-oriented programs in growing fields. The college is home to the oldest private Associate&#x27;s Degree in Nursing program in western New York.

<doc id="505920" wikidata="Q1701206" url="?curid=505920" title="Waffle House">
<text>Waffle House, Inc. is an American restaurant chain with over 2000 locations in 25 states in the United States. The bulk of the locations are in the Midwest and the South, where the chain is a regional cultural icon. The menu consists mainly of Southern breakfast food. Waffle House is headquartered in Norcross, Georgia, in the Atlanta metropolitan area.
==History==
=== Founding ===
The first Waffle House opened on Labor Day weekend in 1955 at 2719 East College Avenue in Avondale Estates, Georgia. That restaurant was conceived and founded by Joe Rogers Sr. and Tom Forkner. Rogers started in the restaurant business as a short-order cook in 1947 at the Toddle House in New Haven, Connecticut. By 1949, he had become a regional manager with the now-defunct Memphis-based Toddle House chain. He then moved to Atlanta, where he met Tom Forkner while buying a house from him in Avondale Estates.

Rogers&#x27;s concept was to combine the speed of fast food with table service with around-the-clock availability. Forkner suggested naming the restaurant &quot;Waffle House&quot;, as waffles were the most profitable item on the 16-item menu. Rogers continued to work with Toddle House, and, to avoid conflict of interest, sold his interest to Forkner in 1956.

=== 1960s-1990s ===
In 1960, Rogers asked to buy into Toddle House, and was subsequently refused. Afterwards, he moved back to Atlanta and rejoined Waffle House, now a chain of three restaurants, to run restaurant operations. Shortly after Rogers returned full-time, Forkner followed suit and left Ben S. Forkner Realty.

After opening a fourth restaurant in 1960, the company began franchising its restaurants and slowly grew to 27 stores by the late 1960s, before growth accelerated. 

=== Since 2000 ===
In 2007, Waffle House repurchased the original restaurant, which had been sold by the chain in the early 1970s. The company restored it using original blueprints for use as a private company museum. The museum is used primarily for internal corporate events and tours.

In 2008, one of the biggest Waffle House franchises in the southeast, North Lake Foods, was bought out by Waffle House, Inc. North Lake Foods filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and closed some stores. Waffle House, Inc. plans to rehabilitate the franchise. In early 2009, East Coast Waffles bought North Lake Foods to become a new franchise.

The founders of the Waffle House brand died in 2017 within two months of each other: Joe Rogers Sr. died on March3 and Tom Forkner on April 26. On September 8, 2024, it was reported that Walter G. Ehmer, who oversaw Waffle House since 2012, had died.

==Operations==
Each Waffle House location is open 24 hours daily. This schedule has inspired the urban myth that &quot;Waffle House doors have no locks&quot;.
The chain&#x27;s restaurants almost always have jukeboxes, which have traditionally played 45-rpm singles and, in some cases, CDs. Waffle House has released music through its own record label, Waffle Records. It has released songs from &quot;Saturday Night At My Place&quot; by Gary Garcia released in 1995 to &quot;They&#x27;re Cooking Up My Order&quot; by Alfreda Gerald released in 2006. The co-founder Joe Rogers had high standards and said, &quot;If it sounded like a commercial, it got the ax.&quot; If the song makes the cut, it will be recorded and make its way to Waffle House jukeboxes. The songs are on ordinary discs, which are produced for Waffle House and are not commercially sold, but the chain has made a CD of some of the songs available for sale. Other artists that recorded for Waffle Records include Eddie Middleton who recorded &quot;Good Food Fast&quot; and &quot;Waffle Doo-Wop,&quot; which was composed and produced by Jerry Buckner.

The company claims to be the world&#x27;s leading seller of several of its menu items—the namesake waffles, ham, pork chops, grits, and T-bone steaks. It also claims that it serves 2% of all eggs in the U.S.

In the 1960s, S. Truett Cathy, the owner of a local diner called the Dwarf House, contracted with Waffle House to sell his proprietary chicken sandwich, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich. However, the Chick-fil-A sandwich quickly overtook Waffle House&#x27;s own items in sales and Waffle House ended the deal, prompting Cathy to spin off Chick-fil-A into its own chain.

=== Waffle and Steak ===
For years, Waffle House was known as &quot;Waffle and Steak&quot; in Indiana due to another chain of restaurants owning the rights to the Waffle House name in the state. The original Indiana Waffle House chain has started using the name &quot;Sunshine Cafe&quot;. However, the d/b/a for &quot;Sunshine Cafe&quot; belongs to &quot;Waffle House Greenwood Inc.&quot;, established in 1981. The oldest &quot;Waffle House&quot; entity listed with the Corporations office of the Indiana Secretary of State is &quot;Waffle House of Bloomington, Indiana, Inc.&quot; established in 1967, and, like Waffle House Greenwood, it is still an active corporation. The Bloomington operation, the city&#x27;s second oldest restaurant, closed in 2013, and was demolished to make way for an apartment complex. (Many of the Waffle House corporations in Indiana have been dissolved.) &quot;Waffle House Inc.&quot; of Norcross, Georgia, registered with Indiana in 1974. In 2005, the Waffle and Steak restaurants all adopted the &quot;Waffle House&quot; moniker, bringing the entire chain under the name.

==Food safety==
In 2004, in response to a serious &quot;Salmonella&quot; problem in 2003 at a Chili&#x27;s location in Vernon Hills, Illinois, and by four deaths in 1993 from &quot;E. coli&quot; in undercooked hamburger at a Jack in the Box, the television news magazine &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; investigated sanitation practices of popular American family restaurant chains, measuring the number of critical violations per inspection. The Waffle House averaged 1.6 critical violations per inspection. Waffle House&#x27;s response to the study pointed out that they prepare all meals in an open kitchen, and consumers can readily observe their sanitation practices themselves.

On September 17, 2019, customers who ate at a Waffle House in Goose Creek, South Carolina, were exposed to Hepatitis A. One of the employees who had worked there tested positive for Hepatitis A. After upper management found out, they immediately shut down the Goose Creek Waffle House location to sanitize the facility. DHEC officials said they would be working with Waffle House to investigate possible exposures and provide guidance for preventive treatment for anyone who may be affected.

==In popular culture==
Waffle House has developed into a cultural icon. Part of Waffle House&#x27;s fame is that they are prominent along Interstate highways in the South.

A now defunct Geocities website, The Waffle House Shrine, hosted employee and customer comments about their experiences with Waffle House.

Waffle House has become known as an internet meme for viral videos of fights on its premises, which have been attributed to the combination of being open 24/7 and its customers often being under the influence of alcohol, though this reputation has been described as a self-fufilling prophecy with similar violence regularly taking place in other retail outlets.

==Disaster recovery==

According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Waffle House is one of the top four corporations, along with Walmart, The Home Depot, and Lowe&#x27;s, for disaster response. Waffle House has an extensive disaster management plan with on-site and portable generators, and positions food and ice ahead of severe weather events such as a hurricane. This helps mitigate the effects of a storm on the power grid and the supply chains. The company prepares &quot;jump teams&quot; of recovery staff and supplies, brought in from outside disaster-affected areas, so that local staff can focus on helping their own homes and families. The ability of a Waffle House to remain open after a severe storm, possibly with a limited menu, is used by FEMA as a measure of disaster recovery known as the Waffle House Index.

<doc id="505929" wikidata="Q336894" url="?curid=505929" title="Particle velocity">
<text>Particle velocity (denoted or ) is the velocity of a particle (real or imagined) in a medium as it transmits a wave. The SI unit of particle velocity is the metre per second (m/s). In many cases this is a longitudinal wave of pressure as with sound, but it can also be a transverse wave as with the vibration of a taut string.

When applied to a sound wave through a medium of a fluid like air, particle velocity would be the physical speed of a parcel of fluid as it moves back and forth in the direction the sound wave is travelling as it passes.

Particle velocity should not be confused with the speed of the wave as it passes through the medium, i.e. in the case of a sound wave, particle velocity is not the same as the speed of sound. The wave moves relatively fast, while the particles oscillate around their original position with a relatively small particle velocity. Particle velocity should also not be confused with the velocity of individual molecules, which depends mostly on the temperature and molecular mass.

In applications involving sound, the particle velocity is usually measured using a logarithmic decibel scale called particle velocity level. Mostly pressure sensors (microphones) are used to measure sound pressure which is then propagated to the velocity field using Green&#x27;s function.

==Mathematical definition==
Particle velocity, denoted formula_1, is defined by
:formula_2
where formula_3 is the particle displacement.

==Progressive sine waves==
The particle displacement of a &quot;progressive sine wave&quot; is given by
:formula_4
where
*formula_5 is the amplitude of the particle displacement;
*formula_6 is the phase shift of the particle displacement;
*formula_7 is the angular wavevector;
*formula_8 is the angular frequency.

It follows that the particle velocity and the sound pressure along the direction of propagation of the sound wave &quot;x&quot; are given by
:formula_9
:formula_10
where
*formula_11 is the amplitude of the particle velocity;
*formula_12 is the phase shift of the particle velocity;
*formula_13 is the amplitude of the acoustic pressure;
*formula_14 is the phase shift of the acoustic pressure.

Taking the Laplace transforms of formula_15 and formula_16 with respect to time yields
:formula_17
:formula_18

Since formula_19, the amplitude of the specific acoustic impedance is given by
:formula_20

Consequently, the amplitude of the particle velocity is related to those of the particle displacement and the sound pressure by
:formula_21
:formula_22

==Particle velocity level==
Sound velocity level (SVL) or acoustic velocity level or particle velocity level is a logarithmic measure of the effective particle velocity of a sound relative to a reference value.&lt;br&gt;
Sound velocity level, denoted &quot;L&quot;&quot;v&quot; and measured in dB, is defined by
:formula_23
where
*&quot;v&quot; is the root mean square particle velocity;
*&quot;v&quot;0 is the &quot;reference particle velocity&quot;;
* is the neper;
* is the bel;
* is the decibel.

The commonly used reference particle velocity in air is
:formula_24
The proper notations for sound velocity level using this reference are or , but the notations , , dBSVL, or dBSVL are very common, even though they are not accepted by the SI.

<doc id="505934" wikidata="Q7921788" url="?curid=505934" title="Vermont Technical College">
<text>Vermont Technical College (Vermont Tech or VTC) was a public technical college in Vermont. Its main residential campuses were located in Randolph Center and Williston. In addition, there were regional campuses distance sites, and nursing campuses in locations throughout the state.

Founded in 1866 as the Randolph Normal School, the mission of the school evolved through time, finally becoming a technical institute in 1957. On July 1, 2023, VTC merged with Northern Vermont University and Castleton University to become Vermont State University. 

==History==
In 1806, the Vermont House of Representatives passed a law creating the Orange County Grammar School in Randolph. The school provided education through the high school grades and by the 1850s its state mandate had expanded to include teacher training. In 1866, Edward Conant, the principal of the Orange County Grammar School, expanded its course offerings to make it a full-fledged normal school for the education and training of teachers. Later that year, the Vermont General Assembly passed legislation making the change official, and the school became the Randolph Normal School.

In 1910, the Randolph Normal School was selected by the legislature as the location for the Vermont School of Agriculture. In 1957, technical courses were added to the curriculum, and the Vermont School of Agriculture was renamed the Vermont Agriculture and Technical Institute (VATI). In 1962, VATI was authorized by the state to award associate degrees and became Vermont Technical College (VTC). VTC began awarding bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 1993 and master&#x27;s degrees in 2015.

For many years, the Vermont public colleges have experienced financial stress and chronic underfunding. Exacerbated by COVID-19, in April 2020, Vermont State Colleges system Chancellor Jeb Spaulding recommended closing the Vermont Technical College residential campus in Randolph as well as all operations/campuses of Northern Vermont University. Under the proposal, some of the Vermont Tech academic programs would be consolidated in Williston. The proposal was abandoned after public opposition, with the Vermont State Colleges instead announcing it would merge its four-year schools as Vermont State University. 
== Academics ==
VTC offered bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and associate degrees. Its five schools included: Agriculture, Plant, &amp; Animal Sciences; Engineering &amp; Computing; General Education; Nursing &amp; Health Professions; and Professional Studies &amp; Management. The schools offered degrees in over 50 majors.

== Athletics ==

The Vermont Tech athletic teams are called the Knights. The college is a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA), primarily competing in the Yankee Small College Conference (YSCC) since the 2011–12 academic year. The Knights previously competed in the Sunrise Athletic Conference of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 2006–07 to 2010–11.

The Vermont State University Randolph Knights continue to play as of 2023.

== Student life ==

=== Student radio station ===
WVTC, Vermont Tech&#x27;s 300-watt fully licensed radio station, broadcasts online and locally at 90.7 FM. The station is located at Morey Hall on VTC&#x27;s Randolph Center campus. WVTC is operated and maintained by the students of VTC through the school&#x27;s Radio Club, and is financially supported by VTC Student Council.

=== CubeSat lab ===
The Vermont Tech CubeSat Lab launched its first satellite, the &quot;Vermont Lunar CubeSat&quot;, a 1U CubeSat on November 19, 2013. Intended to orbit for three to five years, the satellite was fully functional until reentry on November 21, 2015. Vermont Tech&#x27;s CubeSat was the first successful satellite launched by a New England college or university. Vermont Tech subsequently aided in developing the flight software for the Lunar IceCube, a satellite intended for deployment as part of the NASA Space Launch System&#x27;s first flight in 2022.

<text>John Owens (1790 – 29 July 1846) was an English merchant and philanthropist, whose bequest helped found part of the University of Manchester.

==Life and career==
Owens was born in Manchester, England, in 1790. His father was Owen Owens, a native of Holywell in Flintshire, Wales, who married Sarah Humphreys in 1788 and soon after moved with her to the rapidly industrialising town of Manchester. Once there, he became a prosperous merchant.

Historians such as H. B. Charlton and William Whyte have noted that details of the life of John Owens are sparse and that, according to Whyte, he is historically a &quot;shadowy&quot; character. The only one of three brothers to survive infancy, Owens was educated at a private school at Ardwick Green until around the age of 14. He then began work for his father&#x27;s firm, which advertised itself as &quot;hat-linings, currier and furrier&quot;. Certainly by 1819, and probably in 1815, he had become a partner in the business, which by then described itself as &quot;manufacturers&quot; and, since 1812, had been exporting its products rather than being completely reliant on domestic trade. The range of products had expanded to include umbrellas and various cotton goods made using the outwork system and almost entirely exported to the Americas. It was based at Carpenter&#x27;s Lane, off Tib Street in Manchester, while Owens lived with his father at Nelson Street, variously described as being in Chorlton on Medlock and Rusholme.

From 1825, the Owens family were for 18 years investors in the cotton-spinning business of Samuel Faulkner, whose son, George, had been a friend of John Owens since his schooldays. Their £10,000 investment produced an annual return of almost 10 per cent until it was decided to withdraw the capital. Following the retirement of Owen Owens from the family business around 1830, the hard-working, somewhat parsimonious John Owens expanded its geographic market while reducing its range of goods. The cheap cotton products ceased to be manufactured but the countries to which it exported now included China, India and the Middle East. By 1840, Owens was also attempting to leverage the profits from that business by speculating in shares and moneylending. It was these new activities that most concerned him from thereon. the remaining years of his life.

Unlike his garrulous father, Owens was a quiet, book-ish person. He was often ill, never married, did not mix much with other business people in Manchester, and had few friends other than George Faulkner. He was a Liberal in politics and a Congregationalist by religion, although in his later life he stopped worshipping in chapel and instead attended the nearby Anglican St Saviour&#x27;s Church. Whyte says that both Samuel Wilson Warneford, &quot;a grasping, avaricious, bigoted reactionary&quot; whose riches did much to develop higher education at Queen&#x27;s College, Birmingham, and Owens - &quot;a parsimonious, work-obsessed, easily offended bachelor, who gave little to charity in his lifetime&quot; - were &quot;disagreeable men, with deep pockets and few friends&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
Owen Owens died in January 1844 and John Owens made a final will in 1845, having rushed through a provisional document in the previous May when he had become very ill. From very soon after his father&#x27;s death, Owens had desired to bequeath some of his estate for charitable purposes, including the foundation of a college in Manchester. It is sometimes claimed, although there is no evidence to support it, that this desire to fund a new college was done at the suggestion of his friends, George Faulkner and Samuel Fletcher. Historian Brian Clapp also believes there is probably no truth in claims that Owens had intended to leave his entire estate to Faulkner, since the final document left a considerable proportion to other people.

Owens died at Nelson Street on 29 July 1846. His bequests to friends and charities amounted to some £52,000, while for the college he left £96,654. Among the conditions for its foundation the most important was that which discountenanced any sort of religious test for students or teachers. He was buried at St John&#x27;s Church, Manchester: the memorial to him there was subsequently moved into the John Owens Building of the university.

The eponymous Owens College, Manchester, opened in 1851 and is now part of the University of Manchester.

<text>Ezequiel Martínez Estrada (September 14, 1895 – November 4, 1964) was an Argentine writer, poet, essayist, and literary critic. An admired biographer and critic, he was often political in his writings, and was a confirmed anti-Peronist. While in his middle years he was identified with the ideas of Nietzsche or Kafka, in his last years he was closely identified with the Cuban revolution and Fidel Castro.

== Life ==
Originally from rural Argentina, Martínez Estrada was born in San José de la Esquina, in Santa Fe Province and grew up until the age of twelve there and in Goyena, a village in the southern reaches of Buenos Aires province. (In 1937, he would buy a farm in Goyena). In 1907, his parents separated, and he went to live with his aunt Elisa in Buenos Aires, and to study at the Colegio Avellaneda. It appears that his formal studies were cut short due to poverty. By 1914 he was working at the central post office in Buenos Aires; he would remain in Buenos Aires until retiring in 1946.

Within a few years, he began to establish a reputation as a poet; he also published a few short essays. In 1921 he married the Italian-born artist Agustina Morriconi, who definitely subordinated her career and unquestioned talents to his; she was, by all accounts, the muse of much of his poetry.

Beginning in 1924, Martínez Estrada taught literature at the Colegio Nacional of the Universidad Nacional de La Plata. He would continue this for decades, losing the job only when Juan Domingo Perón rose to power in 1945 (and returning briefly after Perón fell from power in 1956).

In 1933, responding to the 1930 Argentinian coup by José Félix Uriburu, Martínez Estrada published &quot;Radiografía de la pampa&quot;, the first of a series of rather pessimistic sociological-psychological-historical essays that would make his reputation. That year, Martínez Estrada received the first of what were to be a series of national literary prizes. It is also about that time that he began travelling abroad; his generally favorable impressions during a U.S.-government-sponsored 1942 visit to the United States are recounted in his posthumously published &quot;Panorama de los Estados Unidos&quot;; his impressions on this visit apparently contrasted sharply with his earlier and later anti-Americanism.

In 1946 Martínez Estrada became a regular contributor to the Argentine magazine &quot;Sur&quot;, edited and published by Victoria Ocampo. His contributions to &quot;Sur&quot; included poems, essays, and Kafkaesque short stories.

During the Perón years, Martínez Estrada suffered from an extremely disabling form of neurodermatitis, quite possibly psychosomatic. After the fall of Perón, his health recovered, but still feeling himself a bit of a voice crying in the wilderness, he embarked on a series of writings he called his &quot;catilinarias&quot; (after Cicero&#x27;s Catiline Orations), a series of acerbic writings directed at the Argentine elite, both in government and among the intellectuals, predicting that Argentina faced a century of &quot;Pre-Peronism, Peronism, and Post-Peronism.&quot; During this time, he returned briefly to the Colegio Nacional, then was appointed as an Extraordinary Professor at the Universidad Nacional del Sur, in Bahía Blanca.

Beginning in mid-1959, Martínez Estrada began what became a semi-exile lasting nearly to the end of his life. First he went on a lecture tour of Chile, then to a peace conference in Vienna, where he met the Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén. In September 1959, he went on to Mexico, where he remained for a year at the Institute of Political Science at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and wrote &quot;Diferencias y semejanzas entre los países de América Latina&quot; (&quot;Differences and resemblances among the Latin American countries&quot;), a long essay even broader than its title might suggest, in that it also drew parallels to Asia and Africa, and generally cast his lot with the emerging Third World-ist view, condemning imperialism and colonialism and expressing his admiration for the revolution then in progress in Cuba, which proved to be his next destination (although with some brief trips back to Argentina).

From September 1960 until November 1962, Martínez Estrada served as director of the Center for Latin American Studies of Cuba&#x27;s Casa de las Américas. There, he became very much a part of the heady intellectual atmosphere of the first years of the revolution: above all, he studied the life and works of José Martí. He also edited two books of Fidel Castro&#x27;s speeches, and numerous writings and pamphlets including &quot;El nuevo mundo, la isla de Utopía y la isla de Cuba&quot; (&quot;The New World, the Island of Utopia, and the Island of Cuba&quot;), in which he saw Cuba as having a manifest destiny, under which the indigenous Taínos of Cuba were linked to the &quot;Amaurotos&quot; of Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; and Castro&#x27;s Cuba to the ideal Cuba of Martí.

Martínez Estrada left Cuba shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis. With his health beginning to fail, with Cuba expelled from the OAS, and with a need to attend to his own economic affairs, he decided that he &quot;would better serve the revolution from abroad.&quot; After a brief stop in Mexico he returned to Argentina, to Bahía Blanca, and to his status as a voice in the wilderness. He completed his three books on Martí (none of which were published in his lifetime and one of which remains unpublished ), wrote a work on Balzac, and continued to write poems (notably his &quot;Tres poemas del anochecer&quot; -- &quot;Three Poems at Dusk&quot;—the last work he published in &quot;Sur&quot;). He spoke of returning to Cuba; it is not entirely clear whether his failure to do so was entirely a matter of his health or related to traces of disillusionment with the revolution that are evidenced in his correspondence. He died November 4, 1964, in Bahía Blanca.

== Works ==
The themes of Martínez Estrada&#x27;s work can largely be gleaned from his choices of whom to write about. The names Nietzsche, Montaigne, and Kafka presumably speak for themselves, but there is also a specifically Latin American theme of skepticism about certain aspects of modernity to be found in his writings. In looking at the works of Domingo Sarmiento, he picked up Sarmiento&#x27;s themes of &quot;civilization&quot; and &quot;barbarism&quot;, but with a greater ambivalence about the virtues of civilization than were found in the earlier writer. Writing about 19th-century naturalist Guillermo Enrique Hudson, Martínez Estrada showed himself to be in sympathy with the idea of a return to a more paradisical natural world. He shared with his older contemporary Horacio Quiroga a concern for the mediocrity, injustice, and dehumanization of contemporary industrial / technological society. Like Sarmiento and José Martí, he believed that as a writer he could not only comment upon the world, but influence it. Towards the end of his life, this led to his support for the Cuban revolution and to his &quot;catilinarias&quot;, acerbic writings on Argentine politics and culture.

<text>Acoustic impedance and specific acoustic impedance are measures of the opposition that a system presents to the acoustic flow resulting from an acoustic pressure applied to the system. The SI unit of acoustic impedance is the pascal-second per cubic metre (symbol Pa·s/m3), or in the MKS system the rayl per square metre (Rayl/m2), while that of specific acoustic impedance is the pascal-second per metre (Pa·s/m), or in the MKS system the rayl (Rayl). There is a close analogy with electrical impedance, which measures the opposition that a system presents to the electric current resulting from a voltage applied to the system.

== Mathematical definitions==
=== Acoustic impedance ===
For a linear time-invariant system, the relationship between the acoustic pressure applied to the system and the resulting acoustic volume flow rate through a surface perpendicular to the direction of that pressure at its point of application is given by:
: formula_1
or equivalently by
: formula_2
where
* &quot;p&quot; is the acoustic pressure;
* &quot;Q&quot; is the acoustic volume flow rate;
* formula_3 is the convolution operator;
* &quot;R&quot; is the acoustic resistance in the &quot;time domain&quot;;
* &quot;G&quot; = &quot;R&quot; is the acoustic conductance in the &quot;time domain&quot; (&quot;R&quot; is the convolution inverse of &quot;R&quot;).

Acoustic impedance, denoted &quot;Z&quot;, is the Laplace transform, or the Fourier transform, or the analytic representation of &quot;time domain&quot; acoustic resistance:
: formula_4
: formula_5
: formula_6
where
* formula_7 is the Laplace transform operator;
* formula_8 is the Fourier transform operator;
* subscript &quot;a&quot; is the analytic representation operator;
* &quot;Q&quot; is the convolution inverse of &quot;Q&quot;.

Acoustic resistance, denoted &quot;R&quot;, and acoustic reactance, denoted &quot;X&quot;, are the real part and imaginary part of acoustic impedance respectively:
: formula_9
: formula_10
: formula_11
where
* &quot;i&quot; is the imaginary unit;
* in &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), &quot;R&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is &quot;not&quot; the Laplace transform of the time domain acoustic resistance &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is;
* in &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;), &quot;R&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) is &quot;not&quot; the Fourier transform of the time domain acoustic resistance &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) is;
* in &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the time domain acoustic resistance and &quot;X&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the Hilbert transform of the time domain acoustic resistance &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), according to the definition of the analytic representation.

Inductive acoustic reactance, denoted &quot;X&quot;&quot;L&quot;, and capacitive acoustic reactance, denoted &quot;X&quot;&quot;C&quot;, are the positive part and negative part of acoustic reactance respectively:
: formula_12
: formula_13
: formula_14

: formula_15
: formula_16
: formula_17
where
* &quot;Z&quot; is the convolution inverse of &quot;Z&quot;; 
* &quot;p&quot; is the convolution inverse of &quot;p&quot;.

Acoustic conductance, denoted &quot;G&quot;, and acoustic susceptance, denoted &quot;B&quot;, are the real part and imaginary part of acoustic admittance respectively:
: formula_18
: formula_19
: formula_20
where
* in &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), &quot;G&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is &quot;not&quot; the Laplace transform of the time domain acoustic conductance &quot;G&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is;
* in &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;), &quot;G&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) is &quot;not&quot; the Fourier transform of the time domain acoustic conductance &quot;G&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) is;
* in &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;G&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the time domain acoustic conductance and &quot;B&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the Hilbert transform of the time domain acoustic conductance &quot;G&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), according to the definition of the analytic representation.

Acoustic resistance represents the energy transfer of an acoustic wave. The pressure and motion are in phase, so work is done on the medium ahead of the wave. Acoustic reactance represents the pressure that is out of phase with the motion and causes no average energy transfer. For example, a closed bulb connected to an organ pipe will have air moving into it and pressure, but they are out of phase so no net energy is transmitted into it. While the pressure rises, air moves in, and while it falls, it moves out, but the average pressure when the air moves in is the same as that when it moves out, so the power flows back and forth but with no time averaged energy transfer. A further electrical analogy is a capacitor connected across a power line: current flows through the capacitor but it is out of phase with the voltage, so no net power is transmitted into it.

=== Specific acoustic impedance ===
For a linear time-invariant system, the relationship between the acoustic pressure applied to the system and the resulting particle velocity in the direction of that pressure at its point of application is given by
: formula_21
or equivalently by:
: formula_22
where
* &quot;p&quot; is the acoustic pressure;
* &quot;v&quot; is the particle velocity;
* &quot;r&quot; is the specific acoustic resistance in the &quot;time domain&quot;;
* &quot;g&quot; = &quot;r&quot; is the specific acoustic conductance in the &quot;time domain&quot; (&quot;r&quot; is the convolution inverse of &quot;r&quot;).

Specific acoustic impedance, denoted &quot;z&quot; is the Laplace transform, or the Fourier transform, or the analytic representation of &quot;time domain&quot; specific acoustic resistance:
: formula_23
: formula_24
: formula_25
where &quot;v&quot; is the convolution inverse of &quot;v&quot;.

Specific acoustic resistance, denoted &quot;r&quot;, and specific acoustic reactance, denoted &quot;x&quot;, are the real part and imaginary part of specific acoustic impedance respectively:
: formula_26
: formula_27
: formula_28
where
* in &quot;z&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), &quot;r&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is &quot;not&quot; the Laplace transform of the time domain specific acoustic resistance &quot;r&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;z&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is;
* in &quot;z&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;), &quot;r&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) is &quot;not&quot; the Fourier transform of the time domain specific acoustic resistance &quot;r&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;z&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) is;
* in &quot;z&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;r&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the time domain specific acoustic resistance and &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the Hilbert transform of the time domain specific acoustic resistance &quot;r&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), according to the definition of the analytic representation.

Specific inductive acoustic reactance, denoted &quot;x&quot;&quot;L&quot;, and specific capacitive acoustic reactance, denoted &quot;x&quot;&quot;C&quot;, are the positive part and negative part of specific acoustic reactance respectively:
: formula_29
: formula_30
: formula_31

Specific acoustic admittance, denoted &quot;y&quot;, is the Laplace transform, or the Fourier transform, or the analytic representation of &quot;time domain&quot; specific acoustic conductance:
: formula_32
: formula_33
: formula_34
where
* &quot;z&quot; is the convolution inverse of &quot;z&quot;;
* &quot;p&quot; is the convolution inverse of &quot;p&quot;.

Specific acoustic conductance, denoted &quot;g&quot;, and specific acoustic susceptance, denoted &quot;b&quot;, are the real part and imaginary part of specific acoustic admittance respectively:
: formula_35
: formula_36
: formula_37
where
* in &quot;y&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), &quot;g&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is &quot;not&quot; the Laplace transform of the time domain acoustic conductance &quot;g&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;y&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is;
* in &quot;y&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;), &quot;g&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) is &quot;not&quot; the Fourier transform of the time domain acoustic conductance &quot;g&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;y&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) is;
* in &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;g&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the time domain acoustic conductance and &quot;b&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the Hilbert transform of the time domain acoustic conductance &quot;g&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), according to the definition of the analytic representation.

Specific acoustic impedance &quot;z&quot; is an intensive property of a particular &quot;medium&quot; (e.g., the &quot;z&quot; of air or water can be specified); on the other hand, acoustic impedance &quot;Z&quot; is an extensive property of a particular &quot;medium and geometry&quot; (e.g., the &quot;Z&quot; of a particular duct filled with air can be specified).

=== Acoustic ohm ===
The acoustic ohm is a unit of measurement of acoustic impedance. The SI unit of pressure is the pascal and of flow is cubic metres per second, so the acoustic ohm is equal to 1 Pa·s/m3.

The acoustic ohm can be applied to fluid flow outside the domain of acoustics. For such applications a hydraulic ohm with an identical definition may be used. A hydraulic ohm measurement would be the ratio of hydraulic pressure to hydraulic volume flow.

=== Relationship ===
For a &quot;one-dimensional&quot; wave passing through an aperture with area &quot;A&quot;, the acoustic volume flow rate &quot;Q&quot; is the volume of medium passing per second through the aperture; if the acoustic flow moves a distance , then the volume of medium passing through is , so:
: formula_38
If the wave is one-dimensional, it yields
: formula_39
: formula_40
: formula_41

== Characteristic acoustic impedance ==
=== Characteristic specific acoustic impedance ===
The constitutive law of nondispersive linear acoustics in one dimension gives a relation between stress and strain:
: formula_42
where
* &quot;p&quot; is the acoustic pressure in the medium;
* &quot;ρ&quot; is the volumetric mass density of the medium;
* &quot;c&quot; is the speed of the sound waves traveling in the medium;
* &quot;δ&quot; is the particle displacement;
* &quot;x&quot; is the space variable along the direction of propagation of the sound waves.

This equation is valid both for fluids and solids. In
* fluids, (&quot;K&quot; stands for the bulk modulus);
* solids, (&quot;G&quot; stands for the shear modulus) for longitudinal waves and for transverse waves.

Newton&#x27;s second law applied locally in the medium gives:
: formula_43
Combining this equation with the previous one yields the one-dimensional wave equation:
: formula_44
The &quot;plane waves&quot;
: formula_45
that are solutions of this wave equation are composed of the sum of &quot;two progressive plane waves&quot; traveling along &quot;x&quot; with the same speed and &quot;in opposite ways&quot;:
: formula_46
from which can be derived
: formula_47
: formula_48
For &quot;progressive&quot; plane waves:
: formula_49
or
: formula_50
Finally, the specific acoustic impedance &quot;z&quot; is
: formula_51
: formula_52
: formula_53
The absolute value of this specific acoustic impedance is often called characteristic specific acoustic impedance and denoted &quot;z&quot;0:
: formula_54
The equations also show that
: formula_55

=== Effect of temperature ===
Temperature acts on speed of sound and mass density and thus on specific acoustic impedance.
=== Characteristic acoustic impedance ===
For a &quot;one dimensional&quot; wave passing through an aperture with area &quot;A&quot;, , so if the wave is a progressive plane wave, then:
: formula_56
: formula_57
: formula_58
The absolute value of this acoustic impedance is often called characteristic acoustic impedance and denoted &quot;Z&quot;0:
: formula_59
and the characteristic specific acoustic impedance is
: formula_60

If the aperture with area &quot;A&quot; is the start of a pipe and a plane wave is sent into the pipe, the wave passing through the aperture is a progressive plane wave in the absence of reflections, and the usually reflections from the other end of the pipe, whether open or closed, are the sum of waves travelling from one end to the other. (It is possible to have no reflections when the pipe is very long, because of the long time taken for the reflected waves to return, and their attenuation through losses at the pipe wall.) Such reflections and resultant standing waves are very important in the design and operation of musical wind instruments.

<doc id="505947" wikidata="Q192359" url="?curid=505947" title="João Gilberto">
<text>João Gilberto (born João Gilberto do Prado Pereira de Oliveira – ; 10 June 1931 – 6 July 2019) was a Brazilian guitarist, singer, and composer who was a pioneer of the musical genre of bossa nova in the late 1950s. Around the world, he was often called the &quot;father of bossa nova&quot;; in his native Brazil, he was referred to as &quot;O Mito&quot; (&quot;The Legend&quot;).
In 1965, the album &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; was the first jazz record to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It also won Best Jazz Instrumental Album – Individual or Group and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.
Gilberto&#x27;s &quot;Amoroso&quot; was nominated for a Grammy in 1978 in the category Best Jazz Vocal Performance. In 2001 he won in the Best World Music Album category with &quot;João voz e violão&quot;.

== Early life ==
João Gilberto was born in Juazeiro, Bahia, the son of Joviniano Domingos de Oliveira, a wealthy merchant, and Martinha do Prado Pereira de Oliveira. He lived in his native city until 1942, when he began to study in Aracaju, Sergipe, returning to Juazeiro in 1946. At the age of 14, Gilberto got his first guitar from his grandfather despite disapproval from Gilberto&#x27;s father. Still in Juazeiro, he formed his first band, called &quot;Enamorados do Ritmo&quot;. Gilberto moved to Salvador, Bahia, in 1947. During his three years in the city, he dropped out of his studies to dedicate himself exclusively to music and at the age of 18 began his artistic career as a crooner at the Rádio Sociedade da Bahia.

== Career ==

Gilberto&#x27;s first recordings were released in Brazil as two-song, 78-rpm singles between 1951 and 1959. In the 1960s Brazilian singles evolved to the &quot;double compact&quot; format, and Gilberto released some EPs in this new format, which carried four songs on a 45-rpm record. In 1956, he returned to Rio and struck up old acquaintances, most significantly with Antônio Carlos Jobim, who was by then working as a composer, producer and arranger with Odeon Records. Jobim was impressed with Gilberto&#x27;s new style of guitar playing and set about finding a suitable song to pitch the style to Odeon management.

In 1963, Gilberto collaborated with American jazz musician Stan Getz on the album &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; which was released the following year. Jobim played the piano for the album while Gilberto&#x27;s then-wife Astrud performed the vocals in English while he sang in Portuguese. Although Astrud Gilberto was only in the recording studio to be with her husband, João Gilberto requested her to sing on several of the tracks as he could not sing in English. This resulted in a duet between the two on the track &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; which became a major hit from the album. At the 7th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; won three awards including Album of the Year, which marked the first time a jazz album received the accolade.

Gilberto was known for his demanding acoustic and noise-control standards. During a recording session of the song &quot;Rosa Morena&quot;, he insisted on 28 takes to get the pronunciation of the &quot;o&quot; in &quot;Rosa&quot; just right. Nonetheless, despite his high acoustic standards, he skipped a contractually required sound check prior to a July 2003 performance at the Hollywood Bowl, in Los Angeles. This negligence (and the ensuing sound fiasco) prompted the audience to stream from the venue before the concert ended. In 1997, Gilberto sued record label EMI over their reissue of several of his early works, which he contended had been poorly remastered. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;A statement by his lawyer at the time declared that the reissues contained sound effects that &#x27;did not pertain to the original recordings, banalizing the work of a great artist.&quot; Following the incident, EMI ceased production of the albums in question, and, as of 2008, the lawsuit has yet to reach a decision.

In 2001, Gilberto won the Grammy for the Best World Music Album category in the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards for his work in the album &quot;João Voz e Violão&quot;. A year later, he was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.

In September 2003, Gilberto performed four shows in Japan. His performance at the Tokyo International Forum on 12 September was recorded for a live album titled &quot;In Tokyo&quot; which was released in 2004. At the 6th Annual Latin Grammy Awards in 2005, &quot;In Tokyo&quot; received a nomination for Best MPB Album. On 17 May 2017, Gilberto received an honorary doctorate in music from Columbia University but did not attend the commencement ceremony.

His posthumous album &quot;Relicário: João Gilberto (Ao Vivo no Sesc 1998)&quot; received an honorable mention by the Associação Paulista de Críticos de Arte in their list of the 50 best Brazilian albums of 2023.

===Role in bossa nova===
With the introduction of the microphone and the amplifier in Brazil, Gilberto realized that the sound source did not need to be emitted intensely, regarding the voice and instrument, which favored subtle and internalized interpretations. On the other hand, at the time of the first &quot;bossa nova&quot; recordings, Brazil still did not have high fidelity recording equipment capable of reproducing more complex sonorities. Due to that, Gilberto and Tom Jobim, Gilberto&#x27;s first arranger, elaborated complex harmonies under the influence of American music, and at the same time they simplified the general sound, because of the equipment limitation.

In July 1958, Elizete Cardoso released the famous LP, &quot;Canção do Amor Demais&quot;, containing songs by Tom Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes. The record, however, would enter the history of Brazilian popular music for another reason: Gilberto accompanied Cardoso on guitar on the tracks &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; and &quot;Outra Vez&quot;, these being the first recordings of the so-called &quot;bossa nova beat&quot;. In August of that year, Gilberto released a 78 rpm record containing &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; and &quot;Bim Bom&quot;, recorded at Odeon, with collaborations from Jobim, Dorival Caymmi and Aloysio de Oliveira. This record inaugurated the &quot;bossa nova&quot; genre and soon became a commercial success. Gilberto&#x27;s recording had arrangements by Jobim and the participation of Milton Banana, among other artists. Gilberto innovated by using two microphones to record, one for the voice and one for the guitar. This way, the harmony became more clearly heard. Until then, songs were recorded with only one microphone, emphasizing the voice to the detriment of the guitar. With this innovation, voice and guitar could compete equally, if the voice maintained a natural intensity. Thus, it was necessary to issue the voice in a volume close to that of ordinary speech. With Gilberto, voice and guitar are kept at the same volume intensity, with the microphones picking up both sound sources equally, and, if required, changing the volume of both would be in equal proportion. In 1959, Gilberto released another 78 rpm, containing &quot;Desafinado&quot; by Jobim and Newton Mendonça, and &quot;Hô-bá-lá-lá&quot;, written by himself. In March 1959, he released the LP &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot;, which became a sales success and had a major impact in the history of Brazilian music.

==Musical style==
Gilberto&#x27;s style combines traditional elements of samba with more contemporary jazz. His &quot;unique&quot; acoustic guitar style involves a syncopated rhythm of plucked chords, with chord progressions rooted in the jazz tradition. His vocal style has been described as &quot;laid-back and understated&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Gilberto at number 81 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. Leonardo Rocha, in his obituary for the BBC, states that Gilberto&#x27;s music describes &quot;a period of huge optimism in Brazil&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gilberto first married the singer Astrud Weinert, with whom he collaborated on the hit recording of &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;; the couple had a son called João Marcelo. They divorced, and he later married the singer Miúcha (died 2018); they had two daughters, including Bebel Gilberto. They later separated. Gilberto also had a daughter with Claudia Faissol, a journalist.

Gilberto lived alone from around 2009. His final years were marked by money problems as well as declining health. In 2011, he was sued and evicted from an apartment in Leblon by his landlord, Countess Georgina Brandolini d&#x27;Adda. It was reported in December 2017 that his daughter Bebel was seeking control of his financial affairs because of his declining mental state and increasing indebtedness.

On 6 July 2019, Gilberto died at his apartment in Rio de Janeiro. His body was buried in Niterói following a private ceremony on 8 July 2019.

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; after his death, Dom Phillips described Gilberto as &quot;.. one of the country&#x27;s greatest musicians and composers, a reclusive genius in a nation of extroverts whose work recalled happier, more optimistic times for a deeply divided nation.&quot; In &quot;The Washington Post&quot; pop critic Chris Richards said, &quot;His voice was one of the most intimate sounds of the 20th century – more melodic than a sigh, more rhythmic than chitchat, only just barely. Every syllable that appeared on his lips carried an air of effortlessness, but Gilberto had worked hard to locate that sacred place where a human breath becomes music.&quot;

<text>John Hadley (16 April 1682 – 14 February 1744) was an English mathematician, and laid claim to the invention of the octant, two years after Thomas Godfrey claimed the same.

==Biography==
He was born in Bloomsbury, London the eldest son of George Hadley of Osidge, East Barnet, Hertfordshire and his wife Katherine FitzJames. His younger brother George Hadley became a noted meteorologist.

In 1717 John became a member (and later vice-president) of the Royal Society of London. In 1729 he inherited his father&#x27;s East Barnet estate.

He died in East Barnet in 1744 and is buried in the local churchyard with other members of his family. He had married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Hodges, FRS (former Attorney General of Barbados) and had one child, a son and heir John, born in 1738.

==Work==
In 1730 Hadley invented the reflecting octant, which could be used to measure the altitude of the sun or other celestial objects above the horizon at sea. A mobile arm carrying a mirror and pivoting on a graduated arc provides a reflected image of the celestial body overlapping the image of the horizon, which is observed directly. If the position of the object on the sky and the time of the observation are known, it is easy for the user to calculate his own latitude. The octant proved extremely valuable for navigation and displaced the use of other instruments such as the Davis quadrant. An American, Thomas Godfrey, independently invented the octant at approximately the same time.

Hadley also developed ways to make precision aspheric and parabolic objective mirrors for reflecting telescopes. In 1721 he showed the first parabolic Newtonian telescope to the Royal Society. This Newtonian, with a primary mirror, compared favorably with the large aerial refracting telescopes of the day. He also made Gregorian telescopes with accurately shaped mirrors.

==Honors==
Mons Hadley and Rima Hadley on the Moon are named after him. 
The Oasis Trust Academy in Ponders End in north London is called Oasis Academy Hadley in his honour.

<text>Eurodicautom was the pioneering terminology database of the European Commission, created in 1975, initially for use by translators and other Commission staff. By 1980 it was consultable on line within the Commission. As the European Community grew it was expanded from six to seven, nine and finally eleven languages (plus Latin for scientific names). Public user interfaces were added later, providing the general public with free access to multilingual terminology in the fields of activity of the European Union. The students of Rennes University UFR2, LEA, technical translator and terminologist department, regularly worked on reviewing and creating entries to the existing database in several languages. 

In 2007, Eurodicautom was replaced by Interactive Terminology for Europe (IATE).
