<text>The Battle of Caporetto (also known as the Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo, the Battle of Kobarid or the Battle of Karfreit) took place on the Italian front of World War I.

The battle was fought between the Kingdom of Italy and the Central Powers and took place from 24 October to 19 November 1917, near the town of Kobarid (now in north-western Slovenia, then part of the Austrian Littoral), and near the river Isonzo. The battle was named after the Italian name of the town (also known as &quot;Karfreit&quot; in German).

Austro-Hungarian forces, reinforced by German units, were able to break into the Italian front line and rout the Italian forces opposing them. The battle was a demonstration of the effectiveness of the use of stormtroopers and the infiltration tactics developed in part by Oskar von Hutier. The use of poison gas by the Germans also played a key role in the collapse of the Italian Second Army.

The rest of the Italian Army retreated to the Piave River; its effective strength declined from 1,800,000 troops down to 1,000,000 and the government of Prime Minister Paolo Boselli collapsed.

==Prelude==

 Throughout the spring and summer of 1917, the Italians had launched numerous offensives on the Austro-Hungarian Lines in the Isonzo Sector, with the 11th Battle of the Isonzo being the most successful in pushing back the Austro-Hungarians. After the Italian success in the 11th Battle of the Isonzo, Emperor Karl knew a breakthrough was going to happen at any moment, as both the Austro-Hungarians and Italians were exhausted, and running out of men to sustain the war. So, he wrote to Kaiser Wilhelm II and requested that German forces be deployed to Italy.
In August 1917 Paul von Hindenburg and Arthur Arz von Straußenburg decided to send troops from the Eastern Front to the Isonzo Sector. Erich Ludendorff was opposed to this but was overruled. Later, in September three experts from the Imperial General Staff, led by the chemist Otto Hahn, went to the Isonzo front to find a site suitable for a gas attack. They proposed attacking the quiet Caporetto sector, where a good road ran west through a mountain valley to the Venetian Plain. The Germans also sent Lieutenant General Konrad Krafft von Dellmensingen, an expert in mountain warfare, to reconnoitre the ground.

The Austro-Hungarian Army Group Boroević, commanded by Svetozar Boroević, was prepared for the offensive. In addition, a new 14th Army was formed with nine Austrian and six to eight German divisions, which were commanded by the German Otto von Below. The German divisions were Ludendorff&#x27;s general reserve. Lieutenant Colonel Georg Wetzell, Ludendorff&#x27;s strategic adviser, advised Ludendorff to use the German divisions to attack a weakpoint in the Italian line. The Italians inadvertently helped by providing weather information over their radio.

The German and Austro-Hungarian battle plan was to use Otto von Below&#x27;s German divisions, which would be guided by Konrad Krafft to attack a part of the Julian Alps which was near the northeastern corner of the Venetian salient. Meanwhile, Svetozar&#x27;s Austro-Hungarian army would attack the eastern end of the salient and a stretch of ground near the Adriatic shore.

The buildup of German and Austro-Hungarian military forces in the region was noticed by Italian air reconnaissance.

==Battle==

Foul weather, as well as lack of readiness in some of the Austro-Hungarian divisions and in particular of their artillery, delayed the attack for two days but on 24 October there was no wind and the front was misted over. At 02:00, in the northern area of the battle (near Bovec/Plezzo) 894 metal tubes similar to Livens Projectors (), dug into a reverse slope, were triggered electrically to simultaneously fire canisters containing of chlorine-arsenic agent and diphosgene, smothering the Italian trenches in a dense cloud of poison gas. Knowing that their gas masks could protect them only for two hours or less, the defenders fled, but 500–600 were killed. Other parts of the valley were bombed with gas from common grenades. Then the front was quiet until 06:00, when all the Italian wire and trenches to be attacked were bombarded by mortars.

At 06:41, 2,200 guns opened fire, many targeting the valley road along which reserves were advancing to plug the gap. At 08:00 two large mines were detonated under strong points on the heights bordering the valley and the infantry attacked. Soon they penetrated the almost undefended Italian fortifications in the valley, breaching the defensive line of the Italian Second Army between the IV and XXVII Corps. To protect the attackers&#x27; flanks, Alpine Troops infiltrated the strong points and batteries along the crests of the adjoining ridges, Matajur and Kolovrat, laying out their telephone lines as they advanced to maintain contact with their artillery. Specially-trained and equipped stormtrooper units led attacks, making use of the new German model 08/15 Maxim light machine gun, light trench mortars, mountain guns, flamethrowers and hand grenades.

The attackers in the valley marched almost unopposed along the excellent road toward Italy, some advanced on the first day. The Italian army beat back the attackers on either side of the sector where the central column attacked, but von Below&#x27;s successful central penetration threw the entire Italian army into disarray. Forces had to be moved along the Italian front in an attempt to stem von Below&#x27;s breakout, but this only weakened other points along the line and invited further attacks. At this point, the entire Italian position was threatened.

The Italian 2nd Army commander Luigi Capello was bedridden with fever. Recognizing that his forces were ill-prepared for this attack and were being routed, Capello requested permission to withdraw to the Tagliamento River. Cadorna, who believed the Italian force could regroup and hold out, denied the request. Finally, on 30 October 1917, Cadorna ordered the majority of the Italian force to retreat to the other side of the Tagliamento. It took the Italians four full days to cross the river, and by this time the German and Austro-Hungarian armies were on their heels, ambushing the defenders whenever they could. These ambushes would become known as the Battle of Pozzuolo. Eventually, the retreating Italian soldiers were able to break through the Austro-German encirclement and retreat to the Tagliamento. Then, on 2 November, after an attack by Captain Emil Redl&#x27;s 4th Battalion of the 4th Bosnian Infantry Regiment, the 55th Infantry Division (Austria-Hungary) established a bridgehead across the Tagliamento River. About this time, however, the rapid success of the attack caught up with them. The German and Austro-Hungarian supply lines were stretched to the breaking point and unable to launch another attack to isolate a part of the Italian army against the Adriatic. Cadorna was able to retreat further and by 10 November had established a position on the Piave River and Monte Grappa.

Even before the battle, Germany was struggling to feed and supply its armies in the field. Erwin Rommel, who as a junior officer won the Pour le Mérite for his accomplishments in the battle, often bemoaned the demands placed upon his &quot;poorly fed troops&quot;. The Allied blockade of the German Empire, which the Kaiserliche Marine had been unable to break, had led to food shortages and widespread malnutrition in Germany and the Central Powers in general. The inadequate provisioning, as well as the grueling night marches preliminary to the Battle of Caporetto, took a toll on the German and Austro-Hungarian forces. Despite these logistical problems, the initial assault was extremely successful. However, as the area controlled by the combined Central Powers forces expanded, an already limited logistical capacity was overstrained. By the time the attack reached the Piave, the soldiers of the Central Powers were running low on supplies and were feeling the effects of exhaustion. As the Italians began to counter the pressure put on them, the German forces lost momentum and were once again caught up in another round of attrition warfare.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
Brian R. Sullivan called Caporetto &quot;the greatest defeat in Italian military history.&quot; John R. Schindler wrote &quot;By any standard, Twelfth Isonzo [Caporetto] and its aftermath represented an unprecedented catastrophe for Italian arms.&quot; The disaster &quot;came as a shock&quot; and &quot;triggered a search for scapegoats,&quot; culminating in a 1919 Italian military commission that investigated the causes of the debacle. At Rapallo, a Supreme War Council was created to improve Allied military co-operation and develop a common strategy. Luigi Cadorna was forced to resign after the defeat, a final straw according to the Prime Minister, Vittorio Emanuele Orlando. Cadorna was known to have maintained poor relations with the other generals on his staff and by the start of the battle, had sacked 217 generals, 255 colonels and 355 battalion commanders. 

In addition, he was detested by his troops as being too harsh. Cadorna had been directing the battle some behind the front and retreated another to Padua. Cadorna was replaced by Armando Diaz and Pietro Badoglio, who commanded one of the corps easily overwhelmed by the Germans in the early stages of the battle, but escaped from all charges during the commission hearings. Italian propaganda offices were established, promising land and social justice to soldiers. Italy also accepted a more cautious military strategy from this point on. Diaz concentrated his efforts on rebuilding his shattered forces while taking advantage of the national rejuvenation that had been spurred by invasion and defeat.

===Casualties===

Italian losses were enormous: 13,000 were killed, 30,000 wounded and 265,000–275,000 were taken prisoner. Morale was so low among the Italian troops, mainly due to Cadorna&#x27;s harsh disciplinary regime, that most of these surrendered willingly. 3,152 artillery pieces, 3,000 machine guns and 1,712 mortars were lost, along with a vast amount of stores and equipment. In contrast, the Austro-Hungarians and Germans sustained around 70,000 casualties.

===Subsequent operations===
The last push of Austro-Hungarian and German forces was met and defeated by Italian forces at the First Battle of Monte Grappa: they had advanced more than in the direction of Venice, but they were not able to cross the Piave River. Up to this point the Italians had been left to fight on their own but, after the Battle of Caporetto, Britain and France sent reinforcements to the Italians. They were reinforced by six French infantry divisions and five British infantry divisions as well as sizeable air contingents. However, these troops played no role in stemming the advancing Germans and Austro-Hungarians, because they were deployed on the Mincio River, some behind the Piave, as the British and French strategists did not believe the Piave line could be held.

The Piave served as a natural barrier where the Italians could establish a new defensive line, which was held during the subsequent Battle of the Piave River and later served as springboard for the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, where the Austro-Hungarian army was finally defeated after eleven days of resistance. On 5 November, Allied officials came together at Rapallo to form the Supreme War Council.

==Legacy==

Opera Nazionale Combattenti, an Italian charitable organization, was set up in December 1917 in the immediate aftermath of the battle, to provide assistance to veterans of the First World War; it was closed in 1977.

After the battle, the term &quot;Caporetto&quot; gained a particular resonance in Italy. It is used to denote a terrible defeat – the failed General Strike of 1922 by the socialists was referred to by Mussolini as the &quot;Caporetto of Italian Socialism&quot;. Many years after the war, Caporetto was still being used to destroy the credibility of the liberal state.

The Battle of Caporetto has been the subject of a number of books. British writer and military historian Cyril Falls&#x27;s one volume &quot;The Battle of Caporetto&quot; is an operational and tactical account of the battle as the centerpiece of the larger campaign in northeastern Italy. &quot;Infanterie greift an&quot; (&quot;Infantry Attacks&quot;), an interwar memoir and military handbook written by the future German field marshal Erwin Rommel, features the actions of then lieutenant Rommel and units he led during the battle, providing insight into &quot;stormtrooper&quot; tactics. The Swedish author F.J. Nordstedt (pseud. Christian Braw) wrote about the battle in his novel &quot;Caporetto&quot;. The bloody aftermath of Caporetto was vividly described by Ernest Hemingway in his novel &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;. Curzio Malaparte wrote an excoriation of the battle in his first book, &quot;Viva Caporetto&quot;, published in 1921. It was censored by the state and suppressed; it was finally published in 1980. The battle also features prominently in the novel &quot;Questa storia&quot; by Alessandro Baricco.

Today, a museum in the town of Kobarid is dedicated to the Isonzo Battles in general, and the Caporetto Battle in particular.

 was a district located in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan.

The original district areas contained some parts of the present city of Fukuyama. The district hall was placed together with Fukatsu District (later merged with Yasuna District to form Fukayasu District) at the town of Fukuyama in Fukatsu District, but in 1898, their own district hall was placed at the town of Tomo (now the town of Tomo in the city of Fukuyama).

In 1954, the town of Matsunaga and 6 villages merged and gained city status to become the city of Matsunaga (later in 1966, the city merged with the city of Fukuyama and dissolved). Afterwards, the towns and villages within the district continued on to merge either into the cities of Fukuyama and Onomichi, and the last remaining town of Numakuma merged into the city of Fukuyama on February 1, 2005, and Numakuma District dissolved.

==The following towns and villages were part of the district (as of the 1889 municipal status enforcement)==
* Tomo (鞆町)

<text>William Benjamin Lenoir (March 14, 1939 – August 26, 2010) was an American electrical engineer and NASA astronaut.

==Early life and education==
William Benjamin Lenoir was born on March 14, 1939, in Miami, Florida, as a son of Samuel Staples Lenoir (1910–1989) and Iona Catherine Lenoir (née Yann; 1915–1977). He attended Coral Gables Elementary School, Ponce de Leon Junior High School, and graduated from Coral Gables Senior High School in 1957. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1961, where he was an active member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE). Lenoir continued at MIT, earning a Master of Science degree in 1962, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in EECS in 1965. While working for his doctoral degree, Lenoir received an award for excelling at teaching undergraduate courses.

From 1964 to 1965, Lenoir was an instructor at MIT; and in 1965, he was named associate professor of electrical engineering. His work at MIT included teaching electromagnetic theory and systems theory, as well as performing research in remote sensing. He was an investigator in several satellite experiments and continued research in this area while fulfilling his astronaut assignments.

==NASA career==
Lenoir was working on Apollo Applications experiments at MIT when he saw an advertisement in a science magazine recruiting NASA astronauts. He sent in an application and was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967. He completed the initial academic training and a 53-week course in flight training at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas. He received his wings with distinguished graduate honors in April 1969.

Lenoir was backup science pilot for Skylab 3 and Skylab 4, the second and third crewed missions in the Skylab program. During Skylab 4, he was co-leader of the visual observations project and coordinator between the flight crew and the principal investigators for the solar science experiments.

From September 1974 to July 1976, Lenoir spent approximately one-half of his time as leader of the NASA Satellite Power Team. This team was formed to investigate the potential of large-scale satellite power systems for terrestrial utility consumption and to make program recommendations to NASA Headquarters. Lenoir supported the Space Shuttle program in the areas of orbit operations, training, extravehicular activity, and payload deployment and retrieval.

Lenoir flew as a mission specialist on STS-5 (November 11–16, 1982), the first Space Shuttle flight to deploy commercial satellites, and logged over 122 hours in space. Following STS-5, Lenoir was responsible for the direction and management of mission development within the Astronaut Office.

Lenoir resigned from NASA in September 1984, to assume a position with the management and technology consulting firm of Booz Allen Hamilton in Arlington, Virginia. He returned to NASA in June 1989 as the Associate Administrator for Space Flight, responsible for the development, operating and implementation of the necessary policy for the Space Shuttle and all U.S. government civil launch activities.

Lenoir resigned from NASA again in April 1992, to become vice president of the Applied Systems Division at Booz Allen Hamilton in Bethesda, Maryland.

===Spaceflight experience===

STS-5 launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 11, 1982. This was the first operational flight of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; and became known as the &quot;We Deliver&quot; mission. Two commercial communications satellites with Payload Assist Module upper stages (PAM-D) were successfully deployed from the Orbiter&#x27;s cargo bay, a new first. This activity was shared with the world when the onboard television tape was played to the control center later that evening. In addition to collecting precise data to document the Shuttle&#x27;s performance during launch, boost, orbit, atmospheric entry and landing phases, STS-5 carried a Getaway Special experiment, three Student Involvement Project experiments, and medical experiments. STS-5 was the last flight to carry the Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) package to support flight testing.

Lenoir and Allen were to perform a spacewalk, the first of the Shuttle program, to test newly developed space suits. The space suits were developed as cheaper and less complicated alternatives to the Apollo versions. The test was delayed by one day due to Lenoir succumbing to motion sickness. Then an underperforming oxygen regulator in Lenoir&#x27;s suit caused them to cancel the extravehicular activity (EVA) entirely. It was the first time in the history of the space program that an EVA had been cancelled due to space suit issues.

The STS-5 crew successfully concluded the 5-day orbital flight of &quot;Columbia&quot; with the first entry and landing through a cloud deck to a hard-surface runway, demonstrating maximum braking. STS-5 completed 81 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on November 16, 1982.

==Personal life==
Lenoir was married twice. He had three children.

Lenoir logged over 3,000 hours of flying time in jet aircraft.

==Death==
Lenoir died August 26, 2010, after suffering head injuries during a bicycle accident near his home in Sandoval County, New Mexico.

==Organizations==
Lenoir was a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Eta Kappa Nu and the Society of Sigma Xi.

==Honors and awards==
Lenoir received a number of honors. He was a Sloan Scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, winner of the Carleton E. Tucker Award for Teaching Excellence at MIT, and recipient of the NASA Exceptional Service Medal (1974) and NASA Space Flight Medal (1982).

<text>The Diana monkey (Cercopithecus diana) is an Old World monkey found in the high canopy forests in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and western Côte d’Ivoire Named for its white brow which is said to resemble the bow of the Roman goddess Diana, this black-grey guenon has a white throat, crescent-shaped browband, ruff and beard.

==Taxonomy==
Two taxa formerly considered subspecies of the Diana monkey have recently been elevated to full species status: the Roloway monkey (&quot;C. roloway&quot;) is found in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Ghana, and the Dryas monkey (&quot;C. dryas&quot;) found in the DR Congo.

==Distribution==
This species can be found in West Africa, from Sierra Leone to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

== Habitat ==
The Diana monkey is found in the primary forests, and does not thrive in secondary forests. The species is regarded as endangered by the IUCN as well as by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the chief dangers to them being habitat destruction (they are now virtually confined to coastal areas) and hunting for bushmeat.

==Description==
The Diana monkey ranges from 40 to 55 cm in length, excluding its tail, which is of a uniform 3–4 cm diameter and 50–75 cm long. Adults weigh between 4–7 kg.

They are generally black or dark grey, but have a white throat, crescent-shaped browband, ruff and beard; the browband gave the species its common name, since it was held to resemble the crescent on the brow of the goddess Diana. The monkeys&#x27; underarms are also white, and they have a white stripe down their thighs, while the backs of their thighs, and their lower backs, are a chestnut colour. Apart from the browband, ruff and beard, and some fringes on their limbs, their fur is rough and tough.

==Biology and behavior==
Individual, healthy Diana monkeys may live for up to 20 years. This species of monkey is active during the day, and feeds at all levels of the canopy, rarely venturing down to the ground for fear of predation. Diana monkeys retreat to the upper levels of the trees at night, though they do not make nests, preferring to sleep on branches. They feed mainly on fruit, blossoms and leaves, as well as occasional insects and invertebrates. The monkeys, in turn, are hunted and preyed upon by various animals, including the crowned hawk-eagle, the African leopard, the common chimpanzee, and humans.

The Diana monkey is a noisy presence in the forest. Its marked coloration allows a wide range of visual social signals. Female Diana monkeys produce specific alarm calls, alert calls and greeting/contact calls, depending on the occasion; in moments of predatory threat, they utilise distinct calls based on the specific predator in question, with some research suggesting that the vocabulary of the females’ vocalisations is larger and more variable than that of the males.

Other forest residents, such as the yellow-casqued hornbill (in addition to other birds) and other primates, are able to discriminate between these and use them to take appropriate action, should a mutual threat be present in the immediate area. A similar system is observed in India with the axis deer (or chital) on the ground and the Hanuman langur in the trees above them; the two species are seemingly inseparable, living in near-symbiosis as the forest’s carnivore &quot;warning-system&quot;. The deer make shrill barks and calls if they spot a tiger, leopard, dhole, or wolf; the monkeys (likewise) scream and alert the deer of any potential threat and, in turn, their commotion alerts every animal within the area.

Diana Monkeys communicate both to local group members and distant competitors with different kind of alarm sounds. Diana Monkeys produce loud noises to make other monkeys aware of leopards or other competitors in their area.

Groups consist of a single male with a number of reproducing females and their infants. In good conditions, adult females reproduce annually. Gestation lasts about 5 months, and the young nurse for a further 6 months. Normally, only a single infant is born. Although the young are born in a fairly well-developed condition, with open eyes and able to grasp their mothers, at least in zoo conditions, Diana monkey mothers appear anxious and possessive, rarely letting young infants leave them. As infants grow, however, they become very playful. Juveniles reach sexual maturity at an age of about 3 years. Daughters remain in their mothers&#x27; social groups, while males leave their natal groups shortly before attaining sexual maturity.

==Human relevance==
Like most primates, Diana monkeys can carry diseases that can be communicated to humans, like yellow fever and tuberculosis. Native tribes in the tropical forest of West Africa poach Diana monkeys, which are sold as luxury meat and seen as a commodity.

<text>was a town located in Futami District, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 4,918 and a density of 58.50 persons per km2. The total area was 84.07 km2.

On April 1, 2004, Kisa, along with the towns of Mirasaka and Miwa, the villages of Funo, Kimita and Sakugi (all from Futami District), and the town of Kōnu (from Kōnu District), was merged with the expanded city of Miyoshi and no longer exists as an independent municipality.

It was located 65 miles north-east of Hiroshima City. The town was divided into about a half dozen village level units, each with its own elementary and nursery schools. Okuda Genzo, a famous Japanese painter, was born in a small farmhouse in Kisa in the first half of the 20th century.

The town had a legend that it received its name when Emperor Go-Toba stopped off in Kisa on the way to an island in the Sea of Japan after he was sent there by the government for instigating a rebellion. Another theory is that it comes from &quot;kisaibe&quot; (Empress&#x27;s estimate).

<doc id="503694" wikidata="Q7400105" url="?curid=503694" title="Saijō, Hiroshima (Shōbara)">
<text>was a town located in Hiba District, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. The site of a feudal castle from the Sengoku period, it was first incorporated as a town in 1898. It then went through several mergers with other towns and villages in the area before being incorporated itself into the city of Shōbara in March 2005. It is now a municipal division within Shōbara.

There are three elementary schools, a junior high school, and a high school located in Saijō. The area is served by the JR West Geibi and Kisuki railway lines. Saijō is located on Japan National Route 183 and 314, and is crossed by three major Hiroshima Prefectural Highways and ten smaller prefectural highways.

==Etymology==
The name of , which literally means &quot;West Castle Town&quot;, is derived from the castle which was built in the area by a feudal lord during the Sengoku period. A comparable castle was built in the nearby Tōjō (which means &quot;East Castle Town&quot;). Neither castle is still standing, though you can view parts of the ruins (mostly foundation and other walls).

==History==
During the 5th century A.D., a kofun grave chamber was constructed in the area. On February 10, 1898, the village of Saijō was incorporated into the town of Saijō. On October 1 of the same year, the districts of Ezo, Nuka, and Mikami, along with the town of Saijō and the villages of Mikoto and Yahoko, were combined to create Hiba District.

A new town of Saijō was created on February 11, 1942 when the original town of Saijō and the village of Mikoto merged. Due to geographic considerations, the Miino Yukiasa section of Yahoko Village was split off on December 1, 1953 and merged with Hachikawa Village in the Nita District of Shimane Prefecture.

The town of Saijō reincorporated on March 31, 1954 when it merged with the village of Yahoko. Fifty-one years later, the towns of Saijō, Hiwa, Kuchiwa, Takano, and Tōjō from Hiba District, Hiroshima, and the town of Sōryō (from Kōnu District) all merged with the city of Shōbara. After 106 years of independent history, the town of Saijō ceased to exist, and it became a municipal division within Shōbara.

==Demographics==
As of November 2021, the town had a population of 3,146 and a density of 13.86 persons per km². The total area was 226.91 km².

==Education==
There are currently four public schools in operation in Saijō.

==Transportation==

===Highways===
Japan National Route 314 travels south from Shimane Prefecture, then turns east toward Okayama Prefecture after briefly joining Japan National Route 183 for about 1 km at Bingo-Ochiai Station. The Hibayama Onsen is located on Route 314 about halfway between Bingo-Ochiai Station and Yuki Station. Route 314 originates in Fukuyama, Hiroshima and terminates in Unnan, Shimane.

Japan National Route 183 originates in Naka-ku, Hiroshima and terminates in Yonago, Tottori. It travels through Saijō northeast from near Hirako Station, generally following the Geibi Line until the Geibi Line turns southeast at the Yahoko Post Office. Route 183 instead continues northeast past the turnoff for Dōgoyama Takahara Ski Resort before entering Tottori Prefecture.

===Railways===
JR West operates multiple stations along two rail lines in Saijō. Along the Geibi, service in Saijō begins with Hirako Station about southwest of Bingo-Saijō Station, located in the heart of Saijō. Hibayama Station is next as you go north, located about north of Mikoto Elementary School.

Bingo-Ochiai Station, located north of Hibayama, connects with the Kisuki Line and is just a few hundred meters south of the Akagi Internal Medicine Clinic. The next station is Dōgoyama Station, located by rail (though only about via Japan National Route 314). Dōgoyama Station gives quick access to Takaohara Ski Resort, Snow Resort Nekoyama, and Dōgoyama Takahara Ski Resort (all within ), as well as Kurokan Park and the Suzuran no Yu onsen (both within ).

The Kisuki Line travels from Bingo-Ochiai Station to Yuki Station before going to Miinohara Station in Shimane Prefecture.

<doc id="503701" wikidata="Q3254748" url="?curid=503701" title="List of Chicago &quot;L&quot; stations">
<text>The Chicago &quot;L&quot; is a rapid transit system that serves the city of Chicago and seven of its surrounding suburbs. The system is operated by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). On an average weekday, 759,866 passengers ride the &quot;L&quot;, making it the second-busiest rapid transit system in the United States, behind the New York City Subway.

The system began as three separate companies, which built lines traveling from Chicago&#x27;s central business district to the south and the west. The first of these was the Chicago and South Side Rapid Transit Railroad which opened on June 6, 1892. The Lake Street Elevated Railroad opened the following year and the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad followed in 1895. Initially, the &quot;L&quot; lines operated independently of each other, but in 1897, they were combined into one physically unified system with the completion of the Union Loop and connecting trackage. In 1900, the Northwestern Elevated Railroad entered operation, finalizing the basic structure of the system: a hub and spoke distribution paradigm radiating north, west, and south from downtown Chicago. The system expanded outward from this with new branches or line extensions until 1930. 

Due to the ruined financial state of the privately owned Chicago Rapid Transit Company and the Chicago Surface Lines, a public agency (the CTA) was created in 1947 to take over and save the rapid transit and streetcar systems. Starting in 1948, the CTA began systematically shutting down many stations and lines that saw little use in order to improve service and reduce costs. Expansion resumed in September 1969 with the opening of a new line in the median of the Dan Ryan Expressway and continued until October 31, 1993, with the opening of the Orange Line. The newest line is the Pink Line, which opened on June 25, 2006 was created by rerouting the Blue Line&#x27;s Douglas branch into a separate service.

, the system has 146 stations on eight lines operating on of track. A total of 103 stations are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and are accessible to passengers with disabilities. The majority of &quot;L&quot; stations are named for the streets or intersections on which they are located; others are named for neighborhoods, suburbs, destinations, or a combination of these. The newest station is on the Green Line, which opened on August 5, 2024.

==Notes==
* On May 16, 1908, the Northwestern Elevated Railroad&#x27;s rapid transit service replaced the service of the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s Evanston branch north of Sheridan Park (Wilson Avenue). Stations noted existed prior to the start of &quot;L&quot; service.
* Clark/Lake is listed twice because the elevated and subway sections opened as separate stations in 1895 and 1951, respectively. 
* Forest Park existed as an interurban station on the Aurora Elgin and Chicago Railway prior to the start of &quot;L&quot; service. March 11, 1905, is the day the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad began operating over the tracks of the AE&amp;C and &quot;L&quot; service began.

<doc id="503702" wikidata="Q11554366" url="?curid=503702" title="Yuki, Hiroshima (Jinseki)">
<text>Yuki (油木町, Yuki-chō) was a town located in Jinseki District, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 3,089 and a population density of 31.51 persons per km². The total area of Yuki was 98.02 km². Yuki was well known for its sake and miso production, especially from the local Shinrai and Shinryu establishments, which were notable for their craftsmanship and traditional brewing methods.

On November 5, 2004, Yuki, along with the towns of Jinseki and Sanwa, and the village of Toyomatsu (all from Jinseki District), was merged to create the town of Jinsekikōgen.

== History and Culture ==
The region around Yuki has a history deeply connected to agricultural traditions and the production of local goods, such as sake and miso. These products, particularly those from Shinrai and Shinryu, are widely recognized within Hiroshima Prefecture for their quality and traditional production methods. The cultural heritage of the area is preserved at the Jinseki Folk Museum, where visitors can explore exhibits on the history of the Jinseki District, including items from the Jomon period and traditional folk tools. The museum also displays artifacts from the Taishakukyo Kannondo Cave Ruins nearby, providing insights into the ancient history of the region.

== Mergers ==
On November 5, 2004, as part of Japan&#x27;s nationwide municipality mergers (平成の大合併, &quot;Heisei no Daigappei&quot;), Yuki was merged with other neighboring municipalities—Jinseki, Sanwa, and Toyomatsu—to form Jinsekikōgen. This merger aimed to streamline administrative functions and promote regional development.

<doc id="503709" wikidata="Q319950" url="?curid=503709" title="Sergio Osmeña">
<text>Sergio Osmeña Sr. (, ; ; September 9, 1878 – October 19, 1961) was a Filipino lawyer and politician who served as the fourth president of the Philippines from 1944 to 1946. He was vice president under Manuel L. Quezon. Upon Quezon&#x27;s sudden death in 1944, Osmeña succeeded him at age 65, becoming the oldest person to assume the Philippine presidency until Rodrigo Duterte took office in 2016 at age 71. A founder of the Nacionalista Party, Osmeña was also the first Visayan to become president.

Prior to his accession in 1944, Osmeña served as governor of Cebu from 1906 to 1907, member and first speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives from 1907 to 1922, and senator from the 10th senatorial district for thirteen years, in which capacity he served as Senate president pro tempore. In 1935, he was nominated to be the running-mate of Senate President Manuel L. Quezon for the presidential election that year. The duo were overwhelmingly re-elected in 1941.

He was the patriarch of the prominent Osmeña family, which includes his son, former senator Sergio Osmeña Jr., and his grandsons, former senators Sergio Osmeña III and John Henry Osmeña, ex-governor Lito Osmeña, and former Cebu City mayor Tomas Osmeña.

==Early life and education==
Osmeña was born on September 9, 1878, in the then-municipality of Cebu in Cebu. His biological father was Don Antonio Sanson, a socially prominent and wealthy Chinese &quot;mestizo&quot; businessman and haciendero known for his vast landholdings throughout Cebu. Sanson came from one of Cebu&#x27;s oldest and most illustrious families. His mother, Juana Osmeña y Suico (born in 1858 or 1859 – died in 1941), was reportedly 20 years old at the time. However, since Sanson was already married to another woman, Osmeña was considered illegitimate. As a result, he took on his mother&#x27;s surname.

Osmeña was secretive of his parentage. He would frequent Sanson&#x27;s farm in Borbon, suggesting he was aware of the identity of his real father.

The Osmeña family, a rich and prominent clan of Chinese Filipino heritage with vast business interests in Cebu, warmed to him as he established himself as a prominent figure in local society.

Osmeña received his elementary education at the Colegio de San Carlos and graduated in 1892. Osmeña continued his education in Manila, studying in San Juan de Letran College where he first met Manuel L. Quezon, a classmate of his, as well as Juan Sumulong and Emilio Jacinto. He took up law at the University of Santo Tomas and placed second in the 1903 bar examination. He served on the war staff of General Emilio Aguinaldo as a courier and journalist. In 1900, he founded the Cebu newspaper &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot; (English: &#x27;The New Day&#x27;) which lasted for three years.

==Public service in Cebu==
When Cebu Governor Juan Climaco was sent as a member of the Board of Commissioners of the St. Louis Purchase Expedition, Osmeña was appointed acting governor. When Climaco returned, he was appointed as provincial fiscal. His stint there elevated him in politics when he was elected governor of Cebu in 1906.

==Congressional career==


===House of Representatives===
While governor, he successfully ran for a seat in the first Philippine Assembly inaugurated in 1907 and was elected as its first speaker. Osmeña was 29 years old and already the highest-ranking Filipino official. He and another provincial politician, Manuel L. Quezon of Tayabas, set up the Nacionalista Party as a foil to the Partido Federalista of Manila-based politicians. During his speakership, members of the assembly sought to initiate policies that constantly clashed with the opinions of American superiors in the Philippine Commission that ultimately did not pass. Three important bills from the assembly were rejected by the Philippine Commission.
# the repeal of the sedition law which imposed penalties on any Filipino who advocated independence;
# the repeal of the flag law which banned display of the Filipino flag;
# the grant of more powers to the local governments.

The Americans&#x27; authority did not stop the assembly under him from initiating transformative legislation that would come to pass. These included the creation of a Council of State and a Board of Control that enabled the Philippine legislature to share some of the executive powers of the American governor-general.

=== Quezon-Osmeña alliance ===
Osmeña was friends and classmates with Manuel L. Quezon, who was the majority floor leader of the Philippine Assembly under Osmeña&#x27;s speakership. When the Jones Law was passed, Quezon was elected as Senate president and Osmeña remained speaker.

===Senate===
In 1922, Osmeña was elected to the Senate representing the 10th senatorial district. During his time as president pro tempore of the senate, he became acting senate president briefly in 1930 after Senate President Quezon went ill.

He went to the United States as part of the OsRox Mission in 1933, to secure passage of the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Independence Bill, which was superseded by the Tydings–McDuffie Act in March 1934.

====Rivalry with Quezon====
Despite being a political ally of Quezon, he had been in controversy with him in 1922, over party principles, and in 1933 concerning the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Bill.

Osmeña supported the controversial Hare–Hawes–Cutting Bill as it provided independence for the Philippines. Quezon, meanwhile, wanted to reject the bill due to certain provisions like the maintenance of U.S. military bases. After their return from the United States in August 1933, Osmeña, along with Manuel Roxas, campaigned for the ratification of it in the Philippine Legislature. Quezon, on the other hand, campaigned for its rejection.

Due to the HHC Controversy, Osmeña&#x27;s faction was defeated during the 1934 national elections.

== Vice-presidency (1935–1944) ==

Osmena was inaugurated vice-president, along with Quezon as president, on November 15, 1935. Quezon had originally been barred by the Philippine constitution from seeking re-election. However, in 1940, constitutional amendments were ratified allowing him to seek re-election for a fresh term ending in 1943. In the 1941 presidential elections, Quezon was re-elected over former Senator Juan Sumulong with nearly 82% of the vote. Re-elected in 1941, Osmeña remained vice president during the Japanese occupation when the government was in exile. As vice-president, Osmeña concurrently served as secretary of public instruction from 1935 to 1940, and again from 1941 to 1944.

The outbreak of World War II and the Japanese invasion resulted in periodic and drastic changes to the government structure. Executive Order 390, December 22, 1941, abolished the Department of the Interior and established a new line of succession. Executive Order 396, December 24, 1941, further reorganized and grouped the cabinet, with the functions of secretary of justice assigned to the chief justice of the Supreme Court.

==Quezon-Osmeña impasse==
By 1943, the Philippine government-in-exile was faced with a serious crisis. According to the amendments to the 1935 Constitution, Quezon&#x27;s term as president was to expire on December 30, 1943, and Vice-President Sergio Osmeña would automatically succeed him to serve out the remainder of term until 1945. This eventuality was brought to the attention of Quezon by Osmeña himself, who wrote the former to this effect. Aside from replying to this letter informing Osmeña that it would not be wise and prudent to effect any such change under the circumstances, Quezon issued a press release along the same line. Osmeña then requested the opinion of U.S. attorney general Homer Cummings, who upheld Osmeña&#x27;s view as more in keeping the law. Quezon, however, remained adamant. He accordingly sought U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s decision. The latter chose to remain aloof from the controversy, suggesting instead that the Philippine officials themselves solve the impasse. A cabinet meeting was then convened by Quezon. Aside from Quezon and Osmeña, others present in this momentous meeting were Resident Commissioner Joaquin Elizalde, Brig. Gen. Carlos P. Romulo, and Cabinet Secretaries Andres Soriano and Jaime Hernandez. Following a spirited discussion, the Cabinet adopted Elizalde&#x27;s opinion favoring the decision and Quezon announced his plan to retire in California.

After the meeting, however, Osmeña approached Quezon and broached his plan to ask the U.S. Congress to suspend the constitutional provisions for presidential succession until after the Philippines should have been liberated. This legal way out was agreeable to Quezon and the members of his Cabinet. Proper steps were taken to carry out the proposal. Sponsored by Senator Tydings and Congressman Bell, the pertinent Joint Resolution No. 95 was unanimously approved by the Senate on a voice vote and passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 181 to 107 on November 12, 1943.

== Presidency (1944–1946) ==
Osmeña became president of the Commonwealth on Quezon&#x27;s death in 1944. He was sworn in by Associate Justice Robert Jackson in Washington, D.C. on August 1. Osmeña delivered his inaugural speech on August 10.


===Administration and cabinet===
===Liberation===
Osmeña accompanied U.S. General Douglas MacArthur during the landing of U.S. forces in Leyte on October 20, 1944, starting the liberation of the Philippines during the Second World War. Upon establishing the beachhead, MacArthur immediately transferred authority to Osmeña, the successor of Manuel Quezon, as Philippine Commonwealth president.

===Domestic policies===

====Restoration of the Commonwealth====
With Manila liberated, General of the Army, Douglas MacArthur, on behalf of the United States, turned over the reins of government of the Philippines to Commonwealth president Sergio Osmeña, on February 27, 1945, amidst brief, but impressive, ceremonies held at the Malacañang Palace. Osmeña, after thanking the United States through General MacArthur, announced the restoration of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and worked out the salvation of the Philippines from the ravages of war.

====Government reorganization====
Osmeña proceeded with the immediate reorganization of the government and its diverse dependencies. On April 8, 1945, he formed his Cabinet, administering the oath of office to its component members. Later, Osmeña received the Council of State to help him solve the major problems confronting the nation. Government offices and bureaus were gradually reestablished. A number of new ones were created to meet needs then current. Also restored were the Supreme Court of the Philippines and the inferior courts. The Court of Appeals was abolished, and its appellate jurisdiction was transferred to the Supreme Court, the members of which were increased to eleven – one chief justice and ten associate justices – in order to attend to the new responsibilities. Slowly but steadily, as the liberating forces freed the other portions of the country, provincial and municipal governments were established by the Commonwealth to take over from the military authorities.

====Rehabilitation of the Philippine National Bank====
Following the restoration of the Commonwealth government, Congress was reorganized. Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino were elected as Senate president and Senate president pro tempore, respectively. In the House of Representatives, Jose Zulueta of Iloilo was elected as speaker and Prospero Sanidad as Speaker pro tempore. The opening session of the Congress was personally addressed by Osmeña, who reported on the Commonwealth government-in-exile and proposed vital pieces of legislation.

The first Commonwealth Congress earnestly took up the various pending assignments to solve the pressing matters affecting the Philippines, especially in regard to relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. The first bill enacted was Commonwealth Act No. 672 – rehabilitating the Philippine National Bank.

====People&#x27;s court====
Yielding to American pressure, on September 25, 1945, the Congress enacted Commonwealth Act No. 682 creating the People&#x27;s Court and the Office of Special Prosecutors to deal with the pending cases of &quot;collaboration&quot;.

===Foreign policies===

====United Nations Charter====
Osmeña sent the Philippine delegation, which was headed by Carlos P. Romulo, to the San Francisco gathering for the promulgation of the Charter of the United Nations on June 26, 1945. Other members of the delegation were Maximo Kalaw, Carlos P. Garcia, Pedro Lopez, Francisco Delegado, Urbano Zafra, Alejandro Melchor, and Vicente Sinco. The 28th signatory nation of the United Nations, the Philippines was one of the fifty-one nations that drafted the UN Charter. Once approved by Philippine delegation, the UN Charter was ratified by the Congress of the Philippines and deposited with the U.S. State Department on October 11, 1945.

====Foreign Relations Office====
To prepare for the forthcoming independent status of the Philippines, Osmeña created the Office of Foreign Relations. Vicente Sinco was appointed as its first commissioner, with cabinet rank. In this connection, Osmeña also entered into an agreement with the United States government to send five Filipino trainees to the U.S. State Department to prepare themselves for diplomatic service. They were sent by U.S. State Department to the United States embassies in Moscow and Mexico City and consulates in Saigon and Singapore.

====International banking====
On December 5, 1945, Osmeña appointed Resident Commissioner Carlos P. Romulo as his representative to accept Philippine membership in the International Monetary Fund and in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which bodies had been conceived in the Bretton Woods Agreement, in which the Philippine had also taken part. Romulo signed said membership on December 27, 1945, on behalf of the Philippines.

====Bell Trade Act====
On April 30, 1946, the United States Congress, at last, approved the Bell Act, which as early as January 20 had been reported to the Ways and Means Committee of the lower house, having been already passed by the Senate. Osmeña and Resident Commissioner Romulo had urged the passage of this bill, with United States High Commissioner, Paul V. McNutt, exerting similar pressure.

The Act gave the Philippines eight years of free trade with the United States, then twenty years during which tariffs would be upped gradually until they were in line with the rest of the American tariff policy. The law also fixed some quotas for certain products: sugar – ; cordage – ; coconut oil – ; cigars – . This aid was coupled with that to be obtained from the recently passed Tydings Damage bill, which provided some nine hundred million dollars for payment of war damages, of which one million was earmarked to compensate for church losses. The sum of two hundred and forty million dollars was to be periodically allocated by the United States president as good will. Also, sixty million pieces of surplus property were transferred to the Philippines government.

===1946 presidential election===

Soon after the reconstitution of the Commonwealth government in 1945, Senators Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino and their allies called for an early national election to choose the president and vice president of the Philippines and members of the Congress. In December 1945, the House Insular Affairs of the United States Congress approved the joint resolution setting the date of the election on no later than April 30, 1946.

Prompted by this congressional action, Osmeña called the Philippine Congress to a three-day special session. Congress enacted Commonwealth Act No. 725, setting the date of the election on April 23, 1946. The act was signed by Osmeña on January 5, 1946.
Three parties presented their respective candidates for the different national elective positions. These were the Nacionalista PartyConservative (Osmeña) wing, the Liberal wing of the Nacionalista Party and the Partido Modernista. The Nacionalistas had Osmeña and Senator Eulogio Rodriguez as their candidates for president and vice president, respectively. The Modernistas chose Hilario Camino Moncado and Luis Salvador for the same positions. The standard bearers of the Liberals were Senators Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino. On January 3, 1946, Osmeña announced his re-election bid. On January 22, 1946, Eulogio Rodriguez was nominated as Osmeña&#x27;s running mate for vice president, in a convention held at Ciro&#x27;s Club in Manila. According to the &quot;Manila Chronicle&quot;:The convention opened at 10:15 a.m. when the acting secretary of the party, Vicente Farmoso, called the confab to order. Congressman José C. Romero [&quot;sic&quot;], who delivered the keynote speech accused Senate President Manuel Roxas and his followers &quot;of fanning the flames of discontent among the people, of capitalizing on the people&#x27;s hardship, and of minimizing the accomplishment of the [Osmeña] Administration. These men with the Messiah complex have been the bane of the country and of the world. This is the mentality that produces Hitlers and the Mussolinis, and their desire to climb to power. they even want to destroy the party which placed them where they are today.&quot;

Senator Carlos P. Garcia, who delivered the nomination speech for President Sergio Osmeña, made a long recital of Osmeña&#x27;s achievements, his virtues as public official and as private citizen.

Entering the convention hall at about 7:30 p.m., President Osmeña, accompanied by the committee on notification, was greeted with rounds of cheer and applause as he ascended the platform. President Osmeña delivered his speech which was a general outline of his future plans once elected. He emphasized that as far as his party is concerned, independence is a close issue. It is definitely coming on 4 July 1946

On January 19, 1946, Senator Roxas announced his candidacy for president in a convention held in Santa Ana Cabaret in Makati, Rizal. According to the &quot;Manila Chronicle&quot;:...more than three thousand (by conservative estimate there were only 1,000 plus) delegates, party members and hero worshipers jammed into suburban, well known Santa Ana Cabaret (biggest in the world) to acclaim ex-katipunero and Bagong Katipunan organizer Manuel Acuña Roxas as the guidon bearer of the Nacionalista Party&#x27;s Liberal Wing. The delegates, who came from all over the Islands, met in formal convention from 10:50 am and did not break up till about 5:30 pm.

They elected 1. Mariano J. Cuenco, professional Osmeñaphobe, as temporary chairman; 2. José Avelino and ex-pharmacist Antonio Zacarias permanent chairman and secretary, respectively; 3. nominated forty-four candidates for senators; 4. heard the generalissimo himself deliver an oratorical masterpiece consisting of 50 per cent attacks against the (Osmeña) Administration, 50 per cent promises, pledges. Rabid Roxasites greeted the Roxas acceptance speech with hysterical applause.

Osmeña tried to prevent the split in the Nacionalista Party by offering Senator Roxas the position of Philippine Regent Commissioner to the United States but Roxas turned down the offer. A new political organization was born, the Liberal wing of the Nacionalista Party, which would later become the Liberal Party of the Philippines.

A total of 2,218,847 voters went to the polls to elect a president and vice president. who were to be the Commonwealth&#x27;s last and the Republic&#x27;s first. Four days after election day, the Liberal Party candidates were proclaimed victors. Roxas registered an overwhelming majority of votes in 34 provinces and nine cities: Abra, Agusan, Albay, Antique, Bataan, Batanes, Batangas, Bukidnon, Bulacan, Cagayan, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Capiz, Cavite, Cotabato, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Isabela, Laguna, La Union, Leyte, Marinduque, Mindoro, Misamis Oriental, Negros Occidental, Nueva Vizcaya, Palawan, Pangasinan, Rizal, Romblon, Samar, Sorsogon, Sulu, Surigao, Tayabas, Zambales, Manila, Quezon City, Bacolod (Negros Occidental), Iloilo City (Iloilo), Baguio (Mountain Province), Zamboanga City (Zamboanga), Tagaytay (Cavite), Cavite City (Cavite) and San Pablo (Laguna).

== Post-presidency and death (1946–1961) ==

After his electoral defeat, Osmeña retired to his home in Cebu City. He died of pulmonary edema at age 83 on October 19, 1961, at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City. President Carlos P. Garcia declared October 20 to November 3 as &quot;period of national mourning,&quot; wherein all flags in the country are flown at half-mast as a sign of mourning.

Osmeña was accorded a state funeral. On October 20, 1961, his remains lay in state at Malate Church in Manila before being transferred to Malacañang. On October 22, these were transported to Cebu City to lie in state at the Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral and, on the next day, at the Cebu Provincial Capitol. These were then returned to Manila to lie in state at Malacañang once again from October 24 to 25, followed by a necrological service for Osmeña at the Legislative Building until October 26. His remains were buried at Manila North Cemetery at noon of October 26.

==2023 paternity test==
For almost a century, the father of Sergio Osmeña had not been certain. Historical records has suggested that either Chinese immigrant and businessman Pedro Lee Gotiaoco or another businessman Antonio Sanson could have been the former president&#x27;s father. In 2023, Osmeña&#x27;s descendants Maria Lourdes Bernardo and Annabelle Osmeña-Aboitiz launched a paternity project to determine the father of their ancestor. Y-DNA testing was conducted and in June 2023, Sanson was determined to be Sergio Osmeña&#x27;s biological father.

<text>The Central–Mid-Levels escalator and walkway system in Hong Kong is the longest outdoor covered escalator system in the world. The system covers over in distance and traverses an elevation of over from bottom to top. It opened in 1993 to provide an improved link between Central and the Mid-Levels on Hong Kong Island.

The escalators at top stage of the escalator system between Robinson Road and Conduit Road have been replaced, and went operational on 11 July 2018. In early 2019, three refurbished escalators between Mosque Street and Robinson Road went operational. In June 2019, two replaced escalators between Caine Road and Elgin Street opened to the public. The escalator between Gage Street and Wellington Street is currently under refurbishment.

Apart from serving as a mode of transport, the system is also a tourist attraction and is lined with restaurants, bars, and shops.

==History==
=== Origins ===
The project was first publicly mooted in the early 1980s. The government found that much of the east-west traffic in the area arose from north-south travel demand, as the steep topography did not allow for major roads to be built straight up the hill. There was talk of linking Central and Mid-Levels with escalators, a monorail, or a cable-car system.

In late 1982, private consultants Peter Y.S. Pun and Associates and MVA Asia were commissioned to investigate traffic improvement measures in Central. In their report entitled &quot;A Study of the Transport Requirements of the Mid-Levels and Central District&quot;, the consultant recommended, among other things, to build an &quot;escalator assisted pedestrian route&quot; linking Mid-Levels to the existing Central Elevated Walkway system and a new bus terminus that they proposed should be built on the site of the Central Market. This proposal was well-received by Mid-Levels residents.

=== Construction and opening ===
The Highways Department commissioned Maunsell Consultants Asia to draw up a detailed design for the system. The Executive Council approved the project on 16 March 1990. Construction began at the end of February 1991, and was carried out by a joint venture between Hong Kong contractor Paul Y. – ITC Construction and the French company Sogen. It took two and a half years to build, and opened to the public at 6:00 am on 15 October 1993.

The opening of the escalator fuelled the proliferation of new restaurants and other commercial operations in the intermediate levels, and contributed to the development of the &quot;SoHo&quot; entertainment district. New businesses opened up in the first or second floors of existing buildings, and added signage to attract escalator riders.

=== Capital cost ===
The system cost HK$240 million (US$31 million) to build, although it was originally approved in March 1990 with a budget of $100 million and annual maintenance costs of $950,000. In November 1996, the Director of Audit issued a report that called the project a &quot;white elephant&quot;, saying that it failed to achieve the primary objective of reducing traffic between the Mid-Levels and Central, as well as over-running its budget by 153 per cent. The Highways Department&#x27;s poor handling of the project was the main reason for having five cost revisions of the project since the budget had been initially approved. The Director of Audit blamed it for failing to address the risks and complexities associated with the project in the pre-tender estimates, and costs rising because of delays. Land resumption costs were also underestimated by $74 million (or 180 per cent). The report also points out that a &quot;before-and-after&quot; study by the Transport Department indicated no obvious reduction in traffic congestion.

==Description==
===Route===
The escalators exist because Hong Kong Island is dominated by steep, hilly terrain, which makes it the home of several unusual methods of transport up and down the slopes. The Central–Mid-Levels escalator system was featured on the CNN website as one of the &quot;coolest commutes&quot; in the world in March 2015.

It links Queen&#x27;s Road Central in Central with Conduit Road in the Mid-Levels, travelling primarily up Cochrane Street and Shelley Street. At Queen&#x27;s Road Central, the Central–Mid-Levels escalators system is connected through Central Market to the Central Elevated Walkway, an extensive footbridge network covering the Central area.

The escalator system is long with a vertical climb of . The total travel time is twenty minutes, but many people walk while the escalator moves to shorten their trip. Due to the geographical situation, the same distance is equivalent to several miles of zigzagging roads if travelling by car. According to Guinness World Records, these escalators together form the longest outdoor covered escalator system.

===Design===
The system includes 18 escalators and three inclined moving walkways. Due to the complex terrain, parts of the system run on elevated concrete structures, while other sections sit at ground level.

The moving walkways have a tread width of one metre (3.28 feet), allowing faster pedestrians to pass slower users. In line with Hong Kong escalator etiquette, slower or idle users generally keep to the right. The three walkways have inclines of 8.1°, 11.9° and 11.7°. Eleven of the escalators have a typical 30° incline, while the remaining seven have a non-standard 17.5° incline.

All the walkways (except for at-grade road crossings) are covered to protect users from the rain, although the sides are open to the elements. The roofing structure was designed to be visually attractive, and incorporates translucent polycarbonate to allow sunlight to illuminate the walkways.

== Operations ==



=== Daily patronage ===
The Transport Department conducted patronage surveys for the entire system in 2005 and 2010. In 2005, the system saw about 54,000 daily pedestrian trips. This grew to 85,000 trips in 2010. The department noted that the escalator has relieved demand for public transport, but has not led to many motorists giving up driving or reduced traffic congestion, in line with the traffic planning principle of induced demand.

=== Management and maintenance ===
Management and maintenance of the system is the responsibility of the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD). It is monitored during operating hours by staff in a control room near Caine Road. The system is equipped with 75 CCTV cameras, LED variable-message signage, and a public address system with about 200 speakers. Since 2014, EMSD has contracted out management and maintenance to a private company. As of 2014, the annual maintenance cost of the system is about HK$12.5 million.
The entire system is being refurbished in stages in a project expected to last from 2018 to 2022.

=== Tidal flow ===
The one-way escalators and moving walkways run downhill from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and then uphill from 10 a.m. to midnight daily. Users wanting to travel in the opposite direction must use the staircases and ramps along the escalator, which consists of total 782 steps between Conduit Road and Queen&#x27;s Road Central footbridge. There is an entrance and exit on each road it passes, often on both sides of the road.

== Bisecting streets ==
The system runs through the whole length of Cochrane Street (named for Rear Admiral Thomas Alexander Cochrane) between Queen&#x27;s Road Central and Hollywood Road. Then it runs along the entire length of a ladder street, Shelley Street.

The whole system bisects the following streets/roads:
* Queen Victoria Street ()
* Des Voeux Road Central ()
* Queen&#x27;s Road Central ()
* Stanley Street ()
* Wellington Street ()
* Gage Street ()
* Lyndhurst Terrace ()
* Old Bailey Street ()
* Hollywood Road ()
* Staunton Street () – SoHo area
* Elgin Street ()
* Caine Road ()
* Mosque Street ()
* Mosque Junction ()
* Robinson Road ()
* Conduit Road ()

==As film location==
The Central–Mid-Levels escalators have been used as filming locations for several films, including:

* &quot;Chungking Express&quot; (1994). Director Wong Kar-wai stated: &quot;That interests me because no one has made a movie there. When we were scouting for locations we found the light there entirely appropriate.&quot;
* &quot;Chinese Box&quot; (1997). Set in the months immediately preceding the 1997 handover of Hong Kong, the flat-cum-office of the main character John (Jeremy Irons) is located directly at the Central–Mid-Levels escalators.
* The Batman film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008). Filming took place there 6–11 November 2007.

<text>The guenons (, ) are Old World monkeys of the genus Cercopithecus (). Not all members of this genus have the word &quot;guenon&quot; in their common names; also, because of changes in scientific classification, some monkeys in other genera may have common names that include the word &quot;guenon&quot;. Nonetheless, the use of the term guenon for monkeys of this genus is widely accepted.

All members of the genus are endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, and most are forest monkeys. Many of the species are quite local in their ranges, and some have even more local subspecies. Many are threatened or endangered because of habitat loss. The species currently placed in the genus &quot;Chlorocebus&quot;, such as vervet monkeys and green monkeys, were formerly considered as a single species in this genus, &quot;Cercopithecus aethiops&quot;.

In the English language, the word &quot;guenon&quot; is apparently of French origin. In French, &quot;guenon&quot; was the common name for all species and individuals, both males and females, from the genus &quot;Cercopithecus&quot;. In all other monkey and apes species, the French word &quot;guenon&quot; designates only the females. The three species such as the L&#x27;hoest&#x27;s monkey, Preuss&#x27;s monkey and the sun-tailed monkey were formerly included in the genus and now listed in a different genus &quot;Allochrocebus&quot;

==Classification==

The genus &quot;Cercopithecus&quot;, derived from the Ancient Greek terms (&quot;kérkos&quot;, “tail”) and (&quot;píthēkos&quot;, &quot;ape&quot;), was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.

==Species list==








===Hybrids===
The red-tailed monkey (&quot;Cercopithecus ascanius&quot;) is known to hybridize with the blue monkey (&quot;C. mitis&quot;) in several locations in the wild in Africa.

<doc id="503715" wikidata="Q3156800" url="?curid=503715" title="J. Frank Dobie">
<text>James Frank Dobie (September 26, 1888 – September 18, 1964) was an American folklorist, writer, and newspaper columnist best known for his many books depicting the richness and traditions of life in rural Texas during the days of the open range. He was known in his lifetime for his outspoken liberal views against Texas state politics, and he carried out a long, personal war against what he saw as braggart Texans, religious prejudice, restraints on individual liberty, and the mechanized world&#x27;s assault on the human spirit. He was instrumental in saving the Texas Longhorn breed of cattle from extinction.

==Early years==
James Frank Dobie was born on a ranch in Live Oak County, Texas, and was the eldest of six children. When he was young, his father Richard read to him from the Bible and his mother Ella read to him from books such as &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; and &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. At 16, Dobie moved to Alice, the seat of Jim Wells County, Texas, where he lived with his grandparents and finished high school at William Adams High School.

In 1906, Dobie enrolled in Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, where he was introduced to English poetry by a professor who urged him to become a writer. While in college he also met Bertha McKee (1890–1974), whom he married in 1916.

After graduating in 1910, Dobie worked briefly for newspapers in San Antonio and Galveston before gaining his first teaching job at a high school in Alpine in southwestern Texas. In 1911, he returned to Georgetown to teach at Southwestern Preparatory School.

In 1913, Dobie went to Columbia University to work on a master&#x27;s degree, and the next year, returned to Texas to join the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin. He also became affiliated with the Texas Folklore Society. In 1917, he left the university to serve in the field artillery in World War I. He was briefly sent overseas at the end of the war and was discharged in 1919.

==Early writing career==
Dobie began to publish his first articles in 1919; by 1920 he was writing articles mostly about Longhorn cattle and life in the southwest. That year, he left the University of Texas faculty to work on his uncle&#x27;s ranch in La Salle County, north of Laredo, where he developed a desire to write about Texas ranch life and southwestern folklore.

After a year on the ranch, Dobie returned to UT and began to use its library and the Texas Folklore Society&#x27;s resources to write about the vanishing way of life on rural Texas ranches. In 1922, he became the Texas Folklore Society&#x27;s secretary and began a program for publication, holding the post of secretary-editor for 21 years. In 1923, unable to get a promotion without a PhD, Dobie accepted a job at Oklahoma A&amp;M College as chair of its English department. While in Oklahoma, he wrote for the &quot;Country Gentleman&quot;. He returned to Austin in 1925 after receiving a token promotion with help from friends.

In 1929, Dobie published his first book, &quot;A Vaquero of the Brush Country&quot;, which helped establish him as an authentic voice of Texas and southwestern culture. While the title page said the book was &quot;Partly from the Reminiscences of John Young&quot;, the author was given as J. Frank Dobie. The book was the result of a collaboration between Dobie and Young, a former open-range &quot;vaquero&quot; who had fought against the encroachment of barbed wire on southwest Texas&#x27;s rangelands. Young had written Dobie for help in writing his autobiography, saying that he intended to use the profits from the book to build a hotel for cattlemen in San Antonio. Dobie agreed to help Young; he rearranged the raw material of Young&#x27;s reminiscences and rewrote it in the prose of historical writing.

Although Lawrence Clark Powell, an authority on western writing at the University of California, wrote in the preface to the 1957 edition, &quot;it was unmistakably Dobie on every page, in every paragraph, sentence, and word&quot;, in 1994 Young&#x27;s heirs filed a petition with the U.S. District Court For the Western District Of Texas asserting that Young and Dobie coauthored the book. The matter of &quot;A Vaquero of the Brush Country&quot;&#x27;s authorship was ultimately resolved in this litigation between Young&#x27;s descendants, Dobie&#x27;s estate, and the University of Texas, holders of interests in the copyright. The court ruled that Young and Dobie are the joint authors of &quot;A Vaquero of the Brush Country.&quot;

In 1931, Dobie published &quot;Coronado&#x27;s Children&quot;, a collection of folklore about lost mines and lost treasures. This was followed by a series of books in the 1930s. In 1941 he published &quot;The Longhorns&quot;, a commercial and critical success that got a full-page review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. It is considered one of the best descriptions of the traditions of the Texas Longhorn cattle breed during the 19th century. In 1932, UT named Dobie the first full professor not to possess a PhD

In 1937, Dobie was visiting Thomas Calloway Lea, Jr., a friend and prominent attorney in El Paso. After seeing Lea&#x27;s son Tom Lea&#x27;s artwork, Dobie asked the younger man to illustrate the book he was working on, &quot;Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver&quot;. Tom Lea also illustrated &quot;The Longhorns&quot;, as well as a biography of Texas pioneer John C. Duval. Dobie and Lea remained good friends for the rest of Dobie&#x27;s life.

In 1939, Dobie began publishing a Sunday newspaper column in which he routinely poked fun at Texas politics. A liberal Democrat, he often found an easy target for his words in the antics of the state&#x27;s politicians. Of state politics, he once wrote, &quot;When I get ready to explain homemade fascism in America, I can take my example from the state capitol of Texas.&quot;

==Later writing career==
During World War II, Dobie taught American history at Cambridge University, and he took a leave of absence from the University of Texas to return to Europe after the war to teach in England, Germany, and Austria, later writing of his experiences at Cambridge in &quot;A Texan in England&quot;. When the UT Board of Regents fired President Homer Rainey for his liberal views, Dobie was outraged and made his views known publicly, causing Texas Governor Coke Stevenson to say that Dobie too should be dismissed. Dobie&#x27;s subsequent request for an extension of his leave of absence was rejected, and he was dismissed from UT in 1947. After his dismissal, Dobie published another series of books and anthologies of stories about the open range.

==Death and legacy==
On September 14, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson, a longtime political rival of Stevenson, awarded Dobie the Medal of Freedom. Dobie died four days later. His funeral was held in Hogg Auditorium at the University of Texas; he is interred at the Texas State Cemetery.

In 1965, Dobie was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

===Dobie Paisano Fellowship===
In 1959, after a severe illness, Dobie sold his ranch in Marble Falls and bought a ranch 14 miles southwest of Austin, which he named &quot;Paisano&quot;. He used the ranch as a writer&#x27;s retreat until his death in 1964. A movement to preserve the ranch promptly started, and longtime friend Ralph A. Johnston purchased the Paisano Ranch to take it off the market. By 1966, he had transferred the deed to the University of Texas. The university has said:

Paisano will be operated by the University as a permanent memorial to J. Frank Dobie, and the primary use will be to encourage creative artistic effort in all fields, particularly in writing. It will be kept in its present more or less natural state and the ranch house will be kept in simple style, very much as it was when Frank Dobie occupied it.

Two fellowships of six months each are awarded by a committee chosen by the presidents of UT-Austin and the Texas Institute of Letters. The applicants must be native Texans, or Texas residents for at least two years, or persons whose writing is substantially identified with the state.

<text>A digital image is an image composed of picture elements, also known as pixels, each with &quot;finite&quot;, &quot;discrete quantities&quot; of numeric representation for its intensity or gray level that is an output from its two-dimensional functions fed as input by its spatial coordinates denoted with &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. Depending on whether the image resolution is fixed, it may be of vector or raster type. 

==Raster==

Raster images have a finite set of digital values, called &quot;picture elements&quot; or pixels. The digital image contains a fixed number of rows and columns of pixels. Pixels are the smallest individual element in an image, holding quantized values that represent the brightness of a given color at any specific point.

Typically, the pixels are stored in computer memory as a raster image or raster map, a two-dimensional array of small integers. These values are often transmitted or stored in a compressed form.

Raster images can be created by a variety of input devices and techniques, such as digital cameras, scanners, coordinate-measuring machines, seismographic profiling, airborne radar, and more. They can also be synthesized from arbitrary non-image data, such as mathematical functions or three-dimensional geometric models; the latter being a major sub-area of computer graphics. The field of digital image processing is the study of algorithms for their transformation.

===Raster file formats===

Most users come into contact with raster images through digital cameras, which use any of several image file formats.

Some digital cameras give access to almost all the data captured by the camera, using a raw image format. &quot;The Universal Photographic Imaging Guidelines (UPDIG)&quot; suggests these formats be used when possible since raw files produce the best quality images. These file formats allow the photographer and the processing agent the greatest level of control and accuracy for output. Their use is inhibited by the prevalence of proprietary information (trade secrets) for some camera makers, but there have been initiatives such as OpenRAW to influence manufacturers to release these records publicly. An alternative may be Digital Negative (DNG), a proprietary Adobe product described as &quot;the public, archival format for digital camera raw data&quot;. Although this format is not yet universally accepted, support for the product is growing, and increasingly professional archivists and conservationists, working for respectable organizations, variously suggest or recommend DNG for archival purposes.

==Vector==
Vector images resulted from mathematical geometry (vector). In mathematical terms, a vector consists of both a magnitude, or length, and a direction.

Often, both raster and vector elements will be combined in one image; for example, in the case of a billboard with text (vector) and photographs (raster).

Example of vector file types are EPS, PDF, and AI.

==Image viewing==

Image viewer software displayed on images. Web browsers can display standard internet images formats including JPEG, GIF and PNG. Some can show SVG format which is a standard W3C format. In the past, when the Internet was still slow, it was common to provide &quot;preview&quot; images that would load and appear on the website before being replaced by the main image (to give at preliminary impression). Now Internet is fast enough and this preview image is seldom used.

Some scientific images can be very large (for instance, the 46 gigapixel size image of the Milky Way, about 194 Gb in size). Such images are difficult to download and are usually browsed online through more complex web interfaces.

Some viewers offer a slideshow utility to display a sequence of images.

==History==


Early digital fax machines such as the Bartlane cable picture transmission system preceded digital cameras and computers by decades.
The first picture to be scanned, stored, and recreated in digital pixels was displayed on the Standards Eastern Automatic Computer (SEAC) at NIST. The advancement of digital imagery continued in the early 1960s, alongside development of the space program and in medical research. Projects at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, MIT, Bell Labs and the University of Maryland, among others, used digital images to advance satellite imagery, wirephoto standards conversion, medical imaging, videophone technology, character recognition, and photo enhancement.

Rapid advances in digital imaging began with the introduction of MOS integrated circuits in the 1960s and microprocessors in the early 1970s, alongside progress in related computer memory storage, display technologies, and data compression algorithms.

The invention of computerized axial tomography (CAT scanning), using x-rays to produce a digital image of a &quot;slice&quot; through a three-dimensional object, was of great importance to medical diagnostics. As well as origination of digital images, digitization of analog images allowed the enhancement and restoration of archaeological artifacts and began to be used in fields as diverse as nuclear medicine, astronomy, law enforcement, defence and industry.

Advances in microprocessor technology paved the way for the development and marketing of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) for use in a wide range of image capture devices and gradually displaced the use of analog film and tape in photography and videography towards the end of the 20th century. The computing power necessary to process digital image capture also allowed computer-generated digital images to achieve a level of refinement close to photorealism.

===Digital image sensors===
The first semiconductor image sensor was the CCD, developed by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith at Bell Labs in 1969. While researching MOS technology, they realized that an electric charge was the analogy of the magnetic bubble and that it could be stored on a tiny MOS capacitor. As it was fairly straightforward to fabricate a series of MOS capacitors in a row, they connected a suitable voltage to them so that the charge could be stepped along from one to the next. The CCD is a semiconductor circuit that was later used in the first digital video cameras for television broadcasting.

Early CCD sensors suffered from shutter lag. This was largely resolved with the invention of the pinned photodiode (PPD). It was invented by Nobukazu Teranishi, Hiromitsu Shiraki and Yasuo Ishihara at NEC in 1980. It was a photodetector structure with low lag, low noise, high quantum efficiency and low dark current. In 1987, the PPD began to be incorporated into most CCD devices, becoming a fixture in consumer electronic video cameras and then digital still cameras. Since then, the PPD has been used in nearly all CCD sensors and then CMOS sensors.

The NMOS active-pixel sensor (APS) was invented by Olympus in Japan during the mid-1980s. This was enabled by advances in MOS semiconductor device fabrication, with MOSFET scaling reaching smaller micron and then sub-micron levels. The NMOS APS was fabricated by Tsutomu Nakamura&#x27;s team at Olympus in 1985. The CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor) was later developed by Eric Fossum&#x27;s team at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1993. By 2007, sales of CMOS sensors had surpassed CCD sensors.

===Digital image compression===
An important development in digital image compression technology was the discrete cosine transform (DCT), a lossy compression technique first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972. DCT compression is used in JPEG, which was introduced by the Joint Photographic Experts Group in 1992. JPEG compresses images down to much smaller file sizes, and has become the most widely used image file format on the Internet.

==Mosaic==

In digital imaging, a &quot;mosaic&quot; is a combination of non-overlapping images, arranged in some tessellation. 
Gigapixel images are an example of such digital image mosaics.
Satellite imagery are often mosaicked to cover Earth regions.

Interactive viewing is provided by virtual-reality photography.

<text>HMS M33 is an of the Royal Navy. Built in 1915, she saw active service in the Mediterranean during the First World War and in Russia during the Allied Intervention in 1919. She was used subsequently as a mine-laying training ship, fuelling hulk, boom defence workshop and floating office, being renamed HMS &quot;Minerva andHulk &quot;C23 during her long life. She passed to Hampshire County Council in the 1980s and was then handed over to the National Museum of the Royal Navy in 2014. A programme of conservation was undertaken to enable her to be opened to the public. HMS &quot;M33&quot; is located within Portsmouth Historic Dockyard and opened to visitors on 7 August 2015 following a service of dedication. She is one of only three surviving Royal Navy warships of the First World War and the only surviving Allied ship from the Gallipoli Campaign, the other being the Ottoman minelayer Nusret, preserved in Çanakkale.

==Construction==
&quot;M33&quot; was built as part of the rapid ship construction campaign following the outbreak of the First World War by Harland &amp; Wolff, Belfast. Ordered in March 1915, she was launched in May and commissioned in June; an impressive shipbuilding feat, especially considering that numerous other ships of her type were being built in the same period.

==First World War==
Armed with a pair of guns and having a shallow draught, &quot;M33&quot; was designed for coastal bombardment. Commanded by Lieutenant Commander Preston-Thomas, her first active operation was the support of the British landings at Suvla during the Battle of Gallipoli in August 1915. She remained stationed at Gallipoli until the evacuation in January 1916. For the remainder of the war she served in the Mediterranean and was involved in the seizure of the Greek fleet at Salamis Bay on 1 September 1916.

==Russian Intervention==
&quot;M33&quot; next saw service, along with five other monitors (, , , and ), which were sent to Murmansk in 1919 to relieve the North Russian Expeditionary Force. In June, &quot;M33&quot; moved to Archangel and her shallow draught enabled her to travel up the Dvina River to cover the withdrawal of British and White Russian forces. At one time the river level was so low the ship&#x27;s guns had to be removed and transported by cart, with the crew placing as much weight on her stern to keep the propellers in the water and to push M33 over the mudbanks. &quot;M25&quot; and &quot;M27&quot; were not so fortunate and had to be scuttled on 16 September 1919 after running aground. &quot;M33&quot; safely returned to Chatham in October.

==Harbour service and restoration==
In 1925 &quot;M33&quot; became a mine-laying training ship and was renamed HMS &quot;Minerva&quot; on 3 February 1925. She went through a number of roles for the remainder of her career including fuelling hulk and boom defence workshop. Her name was changed again in 1939, this time to Hulk &quot;C23&quot;. In 1946 she became a floating office at the Royal Clarence Victualling Yard at Gosport.

Put up for sale in 1984, in July 1987 she left Portsmouth on the barge Pacific Goliath alongside HMS Trincomalee; that ship had been placed on a cradle to support her wooden hull, but M.33 with her flat bottom could be placed on the barge instead. In Hartlepool early restoration work was undertaken including painting her back to wartime colours and restoration of her superstructure. She later passed to Hampshire County Council and was towed back to Portsmouth to begin further restoration, she was moored in No.1 Basin near HMS Victory.

HMS M.33 is listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, she is now located at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, close to . She was opened to the public for the first time as part of the National Museum of the Royal Navy on 7 August 2015. &quot;M33&quot; is one of only three surviving British warships that served during the First World War, the others being and , although a number of auxiliary vessels and small craft have also survived.

<text>This timeline of the telephone covers landline, radio, and cellular telephony technologies and provides many important dates in the history of the telephone.




==1667 to 1875==
* 1667: Robert Hooke creates an acoustic string telephone that conveys sounds over a taut extended wire by mechanical vibrations.
* 1844: Innocenzo Manzetti first suggests the idea of an electric &quot;speaking telegraph&quot;, or telephone.
* 1849: Antonio Meucci demonstrates a communicating device to individuals in Havana. It is disputed that this is an electromagnetic telephone, but it is said to involve direct transmission of electricity into the user&#x27;s body.
* 1854: Charles Bourseul publishes a description of a make-and-break telephone transmitter and receiver in &quot;L&#x27;Illustration&quot;, (Paris) but does not construct a working instrument.
* 1854: Meucci demonstrates an electric voice-operated device in New York, but it is not clear what kind of device he demonstrated.
* 1860: Johann Philipp Reis of Germany demonstrates a make-and-break transmitter after the design of Bourseul and a knitting-needle receiver. Witnesses said they heard human voices being transmitted.
* 1861: Johann Philipp Reis transfers voice electrically over a distance of 340 feet with his Reis telephone. To prove that speech can be recognized successfully at the receiving end, he uses the phrase &quot;The horse does not eat cucumber salad&quot; as an example because this phrase is hard to understand acoustically in German.
* 1864: In an attempt to give his musical automaton a voice, Innocenzo Manzetti invents the &#x27;speaking telegraph&#x27;. He shows no interest in patenting his device, but it is reported in newspapers.
* 1865: Meucci reads of Manzetti&#x27;s invention and writes to the editors of two newspapers claiming priority and quoting his first experiment in 1849. He writes &quot;I do not wish to deny Mr. Manzetti his invention, I only wish to observe that two thoughts could be found to contain the same discovery, and that by uniting the two ideas one can more easily reach the certainty about a thing this important.&quot;
* 1871: Meucci files a patent caveat (a statement of intention to file a patent application) for a Sound Telegraph, but it does not describe an electromagnetic telephone.
* 1872: Elisha Gray founds the Western Electric Manufacturing Company.
* 1872: Professor Vanderwyde demonstrates Reis&#x27;s telephone in New York.
* July 1873: Thomas Edison notes varying resistance in carbon grains due to pressure, and builds a rheostat based on the principle but abandons it because of its sensitivity to vibration.
* May 1874: Gray invents an electromagnet device for transmitting musical tones. Some of his receivers use a metallic diaphragm.
* July 1874: Alexander Graham Bell conceives the theoretical concept for the telephone while vacationing at his parents&#x27; farm near Brantford, Ontario, Canada. Alexander Melville Bell records notes of his son&#x27;s conversation in his personal journal.
* 29 December 1874: Gray demonstrates his musical tones device and transmits &quot;familiar melodies through telegraph wire&quot; at the Presbyterian Church in Highland Park, Illinois.
* 4 May 1875: Bell conceives of using varying resistance in a wire conducting electric current to create a varying current amplitude.
* 2 June 1875: Bell transmits the sound of a plucked steel reed using electromagnet instruments.
* 1 July 1875: Bell uses a bi-directional &quot;gallows&quot; telephone that was able to transmit &quot;indistinct but voice-like sounds&quot; rather than clear speech. Both the transmitter and the receiver were identical membrane electromagnet instruments.
* 1875: Thomas Edison experiments with acoustic telegraphy and, in November, builds an electro-dynamic receiver but does not exploit it.

== 1876 to 1878 ==

* 11 February 1876: Elisha Gray invents a liquid transmitter for use with a telephone, but he did not make one.
* 14 February 1876
** about 9:30am: Gray or his lawyer brings Gray&#x27;s patent caveat for the telephone to the Washington, D.C. Patent Office (a caveat was a notice of intention to file a patent application. It was like a patent application, but without a request for examination, for the purpose of notifying the patent office of a possible invention in process).
** about 11:30am: Bell&#x27;s lawyer brings to the same patent office Bell&#x27;s patent application for the telephone. Bell&#x27;s lawyer requests that it be registered immediately in the cash receipts blotter.
** about 1:30pm: Approximately two hours later Elisha Gray&#x27;s patent caveat is registered in the cash blotter. Although his caveat was not a full application, Gray could have converted it into a patent application and contested Bell&#x27;s priority, but did not do so because of advice from his lawyer and his involvement with acoustic telegraphy. The result was that the patent was awarded to Bell.
* 7 March 1876: Bell&#x27;s U.S. Patent, No. 174,465 for the telephone is granted.
* 10 March 1876: Bell first successfully transmits speech, saying &quot;Mr. Watson, come here! I want to see you!&quot; using a liquid transmitter as described in Gray&#x27;s caveat, and Bell&#x27;s own electromagnetic receiver.

<text>Quanzhou is a prefecture-level port city on the north bank of the Jin River, beside the Taiwan Strait in southern Fujian, People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is Fujian&#x27;s largest most populous metropolitan region, with an area of and a population of 8,782,285 as of the 2020 census. Its built-up area is home to 6,669,711 inhabitants, encompassing the Licheng, Fengze, and Luojiang urban districts; Jinjiang, Nan&#x27;an, and Shishi cities; Hui&#x27;an County; and the Quanzhou District for Taiwanese Investment. Quanzhou was China&#x27;s 12th-largest extended metropolitan area in 2010.

Quanzhou was China&#x27;s major port for foreign traders, who knew it as Zaiton, during the 11th through 14th centuries. It was visited by both Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta; both travelers praised it as one of the most prosperous and glorious cities in the world. It was the naval base from which the Mongol attacks on Japan and Java were primarily launched and a cosmopolitan center with Buddhist and Hindu temples, Islamic mosques, and Christian churches, including a Catholic cathedral and Franciscan friaries. A failed revolt prompted a massacre of the city&#x27;s foreign communities in 1357. Economic dislocations—including piracy and an imperial overreaction to it during the Ming and Qing—reduced its prosperity, with Japanese trade shifting to Ningbo and Zhapu and other foreign trade restricted to Guangzhou. Quanzhou became an opium-smuggling center in the 19th century but the siltation of its harbor hindered trade by larger ships.

Because of its importance for medieval maritime commerce, unique mix of religious buildings, and extensive archeological remains, &quot;&quot; was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2021.

==Names==
Quanzhou (also known as Zayton or Zaiton in British and American historical sources) is the atonal pinyin romanization of the city&#x27;s Chinese name , using its pronunciation in the Mandarin dialect. The name derives from the city&#x27;s former status as the seat of the imperial Chinese Quan (&quot;Spring&quot;) Prefecture. Ch&#x27;üan-chou was the Wade-Giles romanization of the same name; other forms include Chwanchow-foo, Chwan-chau fu, Chwanchew, Ts&#x27;üan-chou, Tswanchow-foo, Tswanchau, T&#x27;swan-chau fu, Ts&#x27;wan-chiu, Ts&#x27;wan-chow-fu, Thsiouan-tchéou-fou, and Thsíouan-chéou-fou. The romanizations Chuan-chiu, Choan-Chiu, and Shanju reflect the local Hokkien pronunciation.

The Postal Map name of the city was &quot;Chinchew&quot;, an English variant of Chincheo, which is also the historical Spanish, Portuguese (and later also Dutch and French) name for the city. The exact etymon of the term is uncertain with multiple explanations on the matter. Historically, &quot;Chincheo&quot; or also &quot;Chengchio&quot; or &quot;Chenchiu&quot; was likely a name that originally referred to neighboring Zhangzhou, due to the name generally being used by European sailors to denote the Bay of Amoy and its hinterland, or even the whole Fujian province. The confusion is also discussed by Charles R. Boxer (1953) and the 1902 Encyclopedia in that it is apparently the transcription of the local Quanzhou Hokkien pronunciation of the name of Zhangzhou, Quanzhou Hokkien (IPA: /t͡ɕiɪŋ³³ t͡ɕiu³³/), the major Fujianese port in the 16th and 17th centuries, specifically the old port of Yuegang in Haicheng, Zhangzhou, trading with Spanish Manila and Portuguese Macao. It is uncertain when exactly and why Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and later also British and French sailors first applied the name to Quanzhou, but perhaps there were initially some confusion due to miscommunication on first language contact by European sailors with Hokkien speakers around the Bay of Amoy, which the term later stuck and continued due to the language barrier among Hokkien speakers and those who do not speak the language. Another by Duncan (1902) claims that it comes from a supposed previous &quot;Tsuien-chow&quot; Mandarin romanization (Mandarin ; IPA: /t͡ɕʰy̯ɛn³⁵ ʈ͡ʂoʊ̯⁵⁵/). In the &quot;Chineesch-Hollandsch Woordenboek van het Emoi dialekt&quot; (1882), a Hokkien-Dutch Dictionary from Dutch Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) of the Dutch East Indies, the name of the Quanzhou dialect of Hokkien is transcribed as the &quot;Tsin-tsiu dialekt&quot;. It is uncertain which term they transcribed &quot;Tsin-tsiu&quot; from, specifically the first syllable, unless it was simply their attempt at giving a Hokkien term to explain the origins of &quot;Chincheo&quot;. On that regard though, as part of Quanzhou prefecture and directly adjacent from the historic city of Quanzhou over the Jin River lies Jinjiang, called in Hokkien ; Tâi-lô: &quot;Tsìn-kang&quot;, which is now also a county-level city. The now county-level city of Jinjiang (Hokkien: ) has the exact same name in Hokkien as the Jin River (Hokkien: ; IPA: /t͡sin⁵⁵⁴ kaŋ³³/), directly in between the historic city of Quanzhou to its west and to the north of Jinjiang, which both the river and the county-level city got their name from the Jin dynasty (晉朝) from when the earliest Min-speaking Chinese settlers coming from the Min River area settled the banks of the Jin River around 284 AD. Zhou () or at least Hokkien originally referred to alluvial islands in the middle of rivers or at the mouth of rivers, which can somewhat geographically describe the historic city of Quanzhou&#x27;s geographic position in between the Jin River and the Luoyang River. Similarly, Zhangzhou () is also named with Hokkien with Hokkien referring to Hokkien , which is the old name of the Jiulong River (Hokkien: ) that surrounds the historic city of Zhangzhou.

Its Arabic name Zaiton or &quot;Zayton&quot; (), once popular in English, means &quot;[City] of Olives&quot; and is a calque of Quanzhou&#x27;s former Chinese epithet, Hokkien or Mandarin , which is derived from the avenues of tung oil-bearing tung trees ordered to be planted around the city by the city&#x27;s 10th-century ruler Liu Congxiao. Variant transcriptions from the Arabic name include Caiton, Çaiton, Çayton, Zaytún, Zaitûn, Zaitún, and Zaitūn. The etymology of satin derives from &quot;Zaitun&quot;. 

==Geography==

Quanzhou proper lies on a split of land between the estuaries of the Jin River and Luoyang River as they flow into on the Taiwan Strait. Its surrounding prefecture extends west halfway across the province and is hilly and mountainous. Along with Xiamen and Zhangzhou to its south and Putian to its north, it makes up Fujian Province&#x27;s Southern Coast region. In its mountainous interior, it borders Longyan to the southwest and Sanming to the northwest.

===Climate===
The city features a humid subtropical climate. Quanzhou has four distinct seasons. Its moderate temperature ranges from 0 to 38 degrees Celsius. In summer, there are typhoons that bring rain and some damage to the city.

=== Earthquakes ===
Major earthquakes have been experienced in 1394 and on 29 December 1604.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
 () used the area as a base of operations for the Chen State before he was subdued by the Sui general Yang Su in the AD590s. Quanzhou proper was established under the Tang in 718 on a spit of land between two branches of the Jin River. Muslim traders reached the city early on in its existence, along with their existing trade at Guangzhou and Yangzhou.

=== Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period ===

In the early period of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, Quanzhou was a part of Min state. After Min was destroyed by the Southern Tang, the Qingyuan Circuit rose up in the original southern territory of Min. The Qingyuan Circuit was a &quot;de facto&quot; independent entity that lasted 29 years (949–978) with 4 rulers. Its territory included present-day southern Fujian and Putian, with Quanzhou as its capital. Its founder, Liu Congxiao, the Prince of Jinjiang and &quot;Jiedushi&quot; (military governor) of Qingyuan Circuit, vigorously expanded overseas trade and city development. Erythrina trees were planted throughout Quanzhou city, so Quanzhou was called Erythrina City. In 964, the circuit was renamed the Pinghai Circuit. In 978, Chen Hongjin, the &quot;Jiedushi&quot; of Pinghai Circuit, was forced to surrender to the Northern Song to avoid war and ravage.

===Song dynasty===
Already connected to inland Fujian by roads and canals, Quanzhou grew to international importance in the first century of the Northern Song. It received an office of the maritime trade bureau (shibosi, 市舶司) in 1079 or 1087 and functioned as the starting point of the Maritime Silk Road into the Yuan, eclipsing both the overland trade routes and Guangzhou. A 1095 inscription records two convoys, each of twenty ships, arriving from the Southern Seas each year. Quanzhou&#x27;s maritime trade developed the area&#x27;s ceramics, sugar, alcohol, and salt industries. Ninety per cent of Fujian&#x27;s ceramic production at the time was jade-colored celadon, produced for export. Frankincense was such a coveted import that promotions for the trade superintendents at Guangzhou and Quanzhou were tied to the amount they were able to bring in during their terms in office. During this period it was one of the world&#x27;s largest and most cosmopolitan seaports. By 1120, its prefecture claimed a population of around 500,000. Its Luoyang Bridge was formerly the most celebrated bridge in China and the 12th century Anping Bridge is also well known.Quanzhou initially continued to thrive under the Southern Song. A 1206 report listed merchants from Arabia, Iran, the Indian subcontinent, Sumatra, Cambodia, Brunei, Java, Champa, Burma, Anatolia, Korea, Japan and the city-states of the Philippines. One of its customs inspectors, Zhao Rugua, completed his compendious &quot;Description of Barbarian Nations&quot; , recording the people, places, and items involved in China&#x27;s foreign trade in his age. Other imperial records from the time use it as the zero mile for distances between China and foreign countries. Tamil merchants carved idols of Vishnu and Shiva and constructed Hindu temples in Quanzhou. Over the course of the 13th century, however, Quanzhou&#x27;s prosperity declined due to instability among its trading partners and increasing restrictions introduced by the Southern Song in an attempt to restrict the outflow of copper and bronze currency from areas forced to use hyperinflating paper money. The increasing importance of Japan to China&#x27;s foreign trade also benefited Ningbonese merchants at Quanzhou&#x27;s expense, given their extensive contacts with Japan&#x27;s major ports on Hakata Bay on Kyushu.

===Yuan dynasty===
In 1277 under the Mongolian Yuan dynasty a superintendent of foreign trade was established in the city. The superintendent Pu Shougeng was Muslim and used his contacts to restore the city&#x27;s trade under its new rulers. He was broadly successful, restoring much of the port&#x27;s former greatness. His office became hereditary to his descendants.

Into the 1280s Quanzhou sometimes served as the provincial capital for Fujian. Its population was around 455,000 in 1283, the major items of trade being pepper and other spices, gemstones, pearls, and porcelain.

Marco Polo recorded that the Yuan emperors derived &quot;a vast revenue&quot; from their 10 percent duty on the port&#x27;s commerce; he called Quanzhou&#x27;s port &quot;one of the two greatest havens in the world for commerce&quot; and &quot;the Alexandria of the East&quot;. Ibn Battuta simply called it the greatest port in the world. Polo noted its tattoo artists were famed throughout Southeast Asia. It was the point of departure for Marco Polo&#x27;s 1292 return expedition, escorting the 17-year-old Mongolian princess Kököchin to her fiancé in the Persian Ilkhanate; a few decades later, it was the point of arrival and departure for Ibn Battuta. Kublai Khan&#x27;s invasions of Japan and Java sailed primarily from its port. The Islamic geographer Abulfeda noted, in , that its city walls remained ruined from its conquest by the Mongols. In the mid-1320s Friar Odoric noted the town&#x27;s two Franciscan friaries, but admitted the Buddhist monasteries were much larger, with over 3000 monks in one.

Between 1357 and 1367 the Yisibaxi Muslim Persian garrison started the Ispah rebellion against the Yuan dynasty in Quanzhou and southern Fujian due to increasingly anti-Muslim laws. Persian militia leaders (賽甫丁) and (阿迷里丁) led the revolt. Arabic official (那兀纳) assassinated Amir ad-Din in 1362 and took control of the Muslim rebel forces. The Muslim rebels tried to strike north and took over some parts of Xinghua but were defeated at Fuzhou. Yuan provincial loyalist forces from Fuzhou defeated the Muslim rebels in 1367. Sayf ad-Din and Amir ad-Din fought for Fuzhou and Xinghua for five years. They both were murdered by another Muslim called Nawuna in 1362 so he then took control of Quanzhou and the Ispah garrison for five more years until his defeat by the Yuan authorities.
Nawuna was killed in turn by Chen Youding. Chen began a campaign of persecution against the city&#x27;s Sunni community—including massacres and grave desecration—that eventually became a three-days anti-foreign massacre. Emigrants fleeing the persecution rose to prominent positions throughout Southeast Asia, spurring the development of Islam on Java and elsewhere. The Yuan were expelled in 1368, and they turned against Pu Shougeng&#x27;s family and the Muslims and slaughtered Pu Shougeng&#x27;s descendants in the Ispah rebellion. Mosques and other buildings with foreign architecture were almost all destroyed and the Yuan imperial soldiers killed most of the descendants of Pu Shougeng and mutilated their corpses.

=== Ming and early Qing dynasties ===

The Ming discouraged foreign commerce other than formal tributary missions. By 1473 trade had declined to the point that Quanzhou was no longer the headquarters of the imperial customs service for Fujian. The Wokou, who came from many different ethnicities, including Japanese, Korean, and Chinese, forced Quanzhou&#x27;s Superintendency of Trade to close completely in 1522.

During the Qing dynasty the Sea Ban did not help the city&#x27;s traders or fishermen. They were forced to abandon their access to the sea for years at a time and coastal farmers forced to relocate miles inland to inner counties like Yongchun and Anxi. Violent large scale clan fights with the thousands of non-native families from Guangdong who were deported to Quanzhou city by the Qing immediately occurred.

=== 19th century to present day ===
In the 19th century, the city walls still protected a circuit of but embraced much vacant ground. The bay began to attract Jardines&#x27; and Dents&#x27; opium ships from 1832. Following the First Opium War, Governor Henry Pottinger proposed using Quanzhou as an official opium depot to keep the trade out of Hong Kong and the other treaty ports but the rents sought by the imperial commissioner Qiying were too high.

When Chinese pirates overran the receiving ships in Shenhu Bay to capture their stockpiles of silver bullion in 1847, however, the traders moved to Quanzhou Bay regardless. Around 1862, a Protestant mission was set up in Quanzhou. As late as the middle of the century, large Chinese junks could still access the town easily, trading in tea, sugar, tobacco, porcelain, and nankeens, but sand bars created by the rivers around the town had generally incapacitated its harbor by the First World War. It remained a large and prosperous city, but conducted its maritime trade through Anhai.

After the Chinese Civil War, Kinmen became disconnected from Quanzhou with the Nationalists successfully defended Kinmen in battle from a Communist takeover attempt.

==Administrative divisions==
The prefecture-level city of Quanzhou administers four districts, three county-level cities, four counties, and two special economic districts. The People&#x27;s Republic of China claims Kinmen Islands (Quemoy) (administered and also claimed by the Republic of China) as Kinmen County under the administration of Quanzhou.
:*Since its founding in 1949, the People&#x27;s Republic of China (&quot;Mainland China&quot;) has claimed the Kinmen Islands (Quemoy) as part of Quanzhou but has never controlled them; they are administered by and also claimed by the Republic of China (Taiwan).

==Demographics==
As of the 2010 census, Quanzhou has a population of 8,128,530. Its built-up area is home to 6,107,475 inhabitants, encompassing the Licheng, Fengze, and Luojiang urban districts; Jinjiang, Nan&#x27;an, and Shishi cities; Hui&#x27;an County; and the Quanzhou District for Taiwanese Investment.

===Religion===

Medieval Quanzhou was long one of the most cosmopolitan Chinese cities, with Chinese folk religious temples, Buddhist temples, Taoist temples and Hindu temples; Islamic mosques; and Christian churches, including Nestorian and a cathedral (financed by a rich Armenian lady) and two Franciscan friaries. Andrew of Perugia served as the Roman Catholic bishop of the city from 1322. Odoric of Pordenone was responsible for relocating the relics of the four Franciscans martyred at Thane in India in 1321 to the mission in Quanzhou. English Presbyterian missionaries raised a chapel around 1862. The Qingjing Mosque dates to 1009 but is now preserved as a museum. The Buddhist Kaiyuan Temple has been repeatedly rebuilt but includes two 5-story 13th-century pagodas. Among the most popular folk or Taoist memorial hall is Guan Yue Memorial Hall () that is dedicated to Lord Yue and famous Lord Guan, who is honored for his righteousness and the spirit of brotherhood. Jinjiang also preserves the Cao&#x27;an monastery (), originally constructed by Manicheans under the Yuan but now used by New Age spiritualists, and a Confucian Memorial Hall (, &quot;Wenmiao&quot;).

===Language===

Locals speak the Quanzhou dialect of Hokkien (Min Nan) partly the same as the Amoy dialect spoken in Xiamen, and similar to Malaysian Hokkien, Singaporean Hokkien, Philippine Hokkien, and Quanzhou-descended Taiwanese dialects. It is unintelligible with Mandarin. Many overseas Chinese whose ancestors came from the Quanzhou area, especially those in Southeast Asia, often speak mainly Hokkien at home. Around the &quot;Southern Min triangle area,&quot; which includes Quanzhou, Xiamen and Zhangzhou, locals all speak the Hokkien language. The dialects of Hokkien itself that they speak are similar but have different tones and sometimes different pronunciation and vocabulary.

===Emigration===

Quanzhou has been a source for Chinese emigration to Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Some of these communities date to Quanzhou&#x27;s heyday a millennium ago under the Song and Yuan dynasties. About 6 million overseas Chinese trace their ancestry to Quanzhou and Tong&#x27;an county. Most of them live in Southeast Asia, including Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand.

==Economy==
Historically Quanzhou exported black tea, camphor, sugar, indigo, tobacco, ceramics, cloth made of grass, and minerals. As of 1832 Quanzhou imported, primarily from Guangzhou, wool cloth, wine, and watches. The East India Company was exporting an estimated £150,000 a year in black tea from Quanzhou.

Today Quanzhou is a major exporter of agricultural products such as tea, banana, lychee, and rice. It is also a major producer of quarry granite and ceramics. Other industries include textiles, footwear, fashion and apparel, packaging, machinery, paper and petrochemicals.

Its GDP ranked first in Fujian Province for 20 years from 1991 to 2010. In 2008 Quanzhou&#x27;s textile and apparel production accounted for 10 percent of China&#x27;s overall apparel production, stone exports account for 50 percent of Chinese stone exports, resin handicraft exports account for 70 percent of the country&#x27;s total, ceramic exports account for 67 percent of the country&#x27;s total, candy production accounts for 20 percent, and the production of sport and tourism shoes accounts for 80% of Chinese, and 20 percent of world production.

Quanzhou is known today as China&#x27;s &quot;shoe city&quot;. Quanzhou&#x27;s 3,000 shoe factories produce 500 million pairs a year, making nearly one in every four pairs of sneakers made in China.

== Cars ==
Quanzhou is the biggest automotive market in Fujian. It has the highest rate of private automobile possession. Quanzhou is connected by major roads from Fuzhou to the north and Xiamen to the south.

== Transport ==

Quanzhou is an important transport hub within southeastern Fujian province. Many export industries in the Fujian interior cities will transport goods to Quanzhou ports. Quanzhou Port was one of the most prosperous port in Tang dynasty and is now still an important Chinese port for exporting.

There is a passenger ferry terminal in Shijing, Nan&#x27;an, Fujian, with regular service to the Shuitou Port in the ROC-controlled Kinmen Island.

=== Airport ===
Quanzhou Jinjiang International Airport is Quanzhou&#x27;s sole airport, served by passenger flights within mainland China and other regional/international destinations throughout southeast Asia, including Hong Kong, Macau, Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok etc. Major airlines operated in JJN are Xiamen Air, Shenzhen Airlines and West Air.

=== Railway ===
The Zhangping–Quanzhou–Xiaocuo railway connects several cargo stations within Quanzhou Prefecture with the interior of Fujian and the rest of the country. Until 2014 this line also had passenger service, with fairly slow passenger trains from Beijing.

Passenger trains from China terminated at the Quanzhou East Railway Station, a few kilometers northeast of the center of the city. Passenger service on this line was terminated, and Quanzhou East railway station closed 9 December 2014.

Since 2010 Quanzhou is served by the high-speed Fuzhou–Xiamen railway, part of the Hangzhou–Fuzhou–Shenzhen high-speed railway, which runs along China&#x27;s southeastern sea coast. High-speed trains on this line stop at Quanzhou railway station (in Beifeng Subdistrict of Fengze District, some 10 miles north of Quanzhou city center) and Jinjiang railway station. Trains to Xiamen take under 45 minutes, making it a convenient weekend or day trip. By 2015 direct high-speed service has become available to a number of cities in the country&#x27;s interior, from Beijing to Chongqing and Guiyang.

=== Long-distance bus ===

<text>Oromia (, ) is a regional state in Ethiopia and the homeland of the Oromo people. Under Article 49 of Ethiopian Constitution, the capital of Oromia is Addis Ababa, also called Finfinne. The provision of the article maintains special interest of Oromia by utilizing social services and natural resources of Addis Ababa.

It is bordered by the Somali Region to the east; the Amhara Region, the Afar Region and the Benishangul-Gumuz Region to the north; Dire Dawa to the northeast; the South Sudanese state of Upper Nile, Gambela Region, South West Ethiopia Region, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples&#x27; Region and Sidama Region to the west; the Eastern Province of Kenya to the south; as well as Addis Ababa as an enclave surrounded by a Special Zone in its centre and the Harari Region as an enclave surrounded by East Hararghe in its east.

In August 2013, the Ethiopian Central Statistics Agency projected the 2017 population of Oromia as 35,467,001; making it the largest regional state by population. It is also the largest regional state covering 

==History==
The Oromo people are one of the oldest Cushitic peoples inhabiting the Horn of Africa. There is still no reliable estimate of the history of their settlement in the region, however, many indications suggest that they have been living in the north of Kenya and south-east Ethiopia for more than 7,000 years, until the great expansion in 1520 when they expanded to the south-west and some areas in the north.

The Oromo remained independent until the last quarter of the 19th century, when they lost their sovereignty. From 1881 to 1886, Emperor Menelik II conducted several unsuccessful invasion campaigns against their territory. The Arsi Oromo demonstrated fierce resistance against this Abyssinian conquest, putting up stiff opposition against an enemy equipped with modern European firearms. They were ultimately defeated in 1886.

In the 1940s some Arsi Oromo together with people from Bale province joined the Harari Kulub movement, an affiliate of the Somali Youth League that opposed Amhara Christian domination of Hararghe. The Ethiopian government violently suppressed these ethno-religious movements. During the 1970s the Arsi formed alliances with Somalia.

In 1967, the imperial regime of Haile Selassie I outlawed the Mecha and Tulama Self-Help Association (MTSHA), an Oromo social movement, and conducted mass arrests and executions of its members. The group&#x27;s leader, Colonel General Tadesse Birru, who was a prominent military officer, was among those arrested. The actions by the regime sparked outrage among the Oromo community, ultimately leading to the formation of the Oromo Liberation Front in 1973. The Oromos perceived the rule of Emperor Haile Selassie as oppressive, as the Oromo language was banned from education and use in administration, and speakers were privately and publicly mocked. The Amhara culture dominated throughout the eras of military and monarchic rule.

Both the imperial and the Derg government relocated numerous Amharas into southern Ethiopia, including the present day Oromia region, in order to alleviate drought in the north of the country. They also served in government administration, courts, church and even in school, where Oromo texts were eliminated and replaced by Amharic. Further disruption under the Derg regime came through the forced concentration and resettlement of peasant communities in fewer villages. The Abyssinian elites perceived the Oromo identity and languages as opposing the expansion of an Ethiopian national identity.

In the early 1990s, the Ethiopian Democratic People&#x27;s Republic began to lose its control over Ethiopia. The OLF failed to maintain strong alliances with the other two rebel groups at the time: the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front (EPLF) and the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF). In 1990, the TPLF created an umbrella organization for several rebel groups in Ethiopia, the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). The EPRDF&#x27;s Oromo subordinate, the Oromo People&#x27;s Democratic Organization (OPDO) was seen as an attempted replacement for the OLF.

On 28 May 1991, the EPRDF seized power and established a transitional government. The EPRDF and the OLF pledged to work together in the new government; however, they were largely unable to cooperate, as the OLF saw the OPDO as an EPRDF ploy to limit their influence. In 1992, the OLF announced that it was withdrawing from the transitional government because of &quot;harassment and [the]assassinations of its members&quot;. In response, the EPRDF sent soldiers to destroy OLA camps. Despite initial victories against the EPRDF, the OLF were eventually overwhelmed by the EPRDF&#x27;s superior numbers and weaponry, forcing OLA soldiers to use guerrilla warfare instead of traditional tactics. In the late 1990s, most of the OLF&#x27;s leaders had escaped Ethiopia, and the land originally administered by the OLF had been seized by the Ethiopian government, now led by the EPRDF.

Prior to the establishment of present-day Addis Ababa the location was called Finfinne in Oromo, a name which refers to the presence of hot springs. The area was previously inhabited by various Oromo clans.

In 2000, Oromia&#x27;s capital was moved from Addis Ababa to Adama. Because this move sparked considerable controversy and protests among Oromo students, the Oromo Peoples&#x27; Democratic Organization (OPDO), part of the ruling EPRDF coalition, on 10 June 2005, officially announced plans to move the regional capital back to Addis Ababa.

Further protests sparked on 25 April 2014, against the Addis Ababa Master Plan, then resumed on 12 September 2015 and continued into 2016, when renewed protests broke out across Ethiopia, centering around the Oromia region. Dozens of protesters were killed in the first days of the protests and internet service was cut in many parts of the region. In 2019, the Irreecha festival was celebrated in Addis Ababa after 150 years of being banned.

==Geography==
Oromia includes the former Arsi Province along with portions of the former Bale, Illubabor, Kaffa, Shewa and Sidamo provinces. Oromia shares a boundary with almost every region of Ethiopia except for the Tigray Region. These boundaries have been disputed in a number of cases, most notably between Oromia and the Somali Region. One attempt to resolve the dispute between the two regions was the October 2004 referendum held in about 420 kebeles in 12 districts across five zones of the Somali Region. According to the official results of the referendum, about 80% of the disputed areas have fallen under Oromia administration, though there were allegations of voting irregularities in many of them. The results led over the following weeks to minorities in these kebeles being pressured to leave. In Oromiya, estimates based on figures given by local district and kebele authorities suggest that 21,520 people have become internally displaced persons (IDPs) in border districts, namely Mieso, Doba, and Erer in the West Hararghe Zone and East Hararghe Zones. Federal authorities believe that this number may be overstated by as much as 11,000. In Doba, the Ministry of Federal Affairs put the number of IDPs at 6,000. There are also more than 2,500 displaced persons in Mieso. In addition, there were reports of people being displaced in the border area of Moyale and Borena zones due to this conflict.

Towns in the region include Adama, Ambo, Asella, Badessa, Bale Robe, Bedele, Bishoftu, Begi, Bule Hora, Burayu, Chiro, Dembidolo, Fiche, Gimbi, Goba, Haramaya, Holeta, Jimma, Koye Feche, Metu, Negele Arsi, Nekemte, Sebeta, Shashamane and Waliso, among many others.

===Languages===

Oromo is written with Latin characters known as &quot;Qubee&quot;, only formally adopted in 1991 after various other Latin-based orthographies had been used previously.

Oromo is one of the official working languages of Ethiopia and is also the working language of several of the states within the Ethiopian federal system including Oromia, Harari and Dire Dawa regional states and of the Oromia Zone in the Amhara Region. It is a language of primary education in Oromia, Harari and of the Oromia Zone in the Amhara Region. It is used as an internet language for federal websites along with Tigrinya.

There are more than 33.8% Oromo speakers in Ethiopia and it is considered the most widely spoken language in Ethiopia. It is also the most widely spoken Cushitic language and the fourth-most widely spoken language of Africa, after Arabic, Hausa and Swahili languages. Forms of Oromo are spoken as a first language by more than 35 million Oromo people in Ethiopia and by an additional half-million in parts of northern and eastern Kenya. It is also spoken by smaller numbers of emigrants in other African countries such as South Africa, Libya, Egypt and Sudan.
Besides first language speakers, a number of members of other ethnicities who are in contact with the Oromo speak it as a second language. See, for example, Harari, Omotic-speaking Bambassi and the Nilo-Saharan-speaking Kwama in northwestern, eastern and south Oromia.

==Economy==

Oromia is a major contributor to Ethiopia&#x27;s main exports - gold, coffee, khat and cattle. Lega Dembi in Guji Zone, owned by MIDROC has exported more than 5000 kilograms of gold, followed by Tulu Kapi gold deposit in West Welega Zone. Awoday in East Hararghe Zone is the biggest market of khat exporting to Djibouti and Somalia. Oromia also has more abundant livestock than any other region of Ethiopia, including camels.

<text>Catherine McAuley, RSM (29 September 1778 – 11 November 1841) was an Irish Catholic religious sister who founded the Sisters of Mercy in 1831. The women&#x27;s congregation has always been associated with teaching, especially in Ireland, where the sisters taught Catholics (and at times Protestants) at a time when education was mainly reserved for members of the established Church of Ireland.

== Life ==
Catherine Elizabeth McAuley was born at Stormestown House in Dublin, Ireland, to James and Elinor (née Conway) McAuley. Her father died in 1783 when she was five and her mother died in 1798. Catherine went first to live with a maternal uncle, Owen Conway, and later joined her brother James and sister Mary at the home of William Armstrong, a Protestant relative on her mother&#x27;s side. In 1803, McAuley became the household manager and companion of William and Catherine Callaghan, an elderly, childless, and wealthy Protestant couple and friends of the Armstrongs, at their estate in Coolock, a village northeast of Dublin. For 20 years she gave catechetical instruction to the household servants and the poor village children. Catherine Callaghan, who was raised in the Quaker tradition, died in 1819. When William Callaghan died in 1822, Catherine McAuley became the sole residuary legatee of their estate.

==The House of Mercy==
Catherine McAuley inherited a considerable fortune and chose to use it to build a house where she and other compassionate women could take in homeless women and children to provide care and education for them. A location was selected at the junction of Lower Baggot Street and Herbert Street, Dublin, and in June 1824, the cornerstone was laid by the Rev. Dr. Blake. As it was being refurbished, she studied current educational methods in preparation for her new endeavour. On the feast of Our Lady of Mercy, 24 September 1827, the new institution for destitute women, orphans, and schools for the poor was opened and Catherine McAuley, with two companions, undertook its management.

==Sisters of Mercy==
For three years, Catherine McAuley and her companions continued their work. McAuley never intended to found a community of religious women; her initial intention was to assemble a corps of Catholic social workers. In 1828 the archbishop permitted the staff of the institute to assume a distinctive habit and to publicly visit the sick. The habit adopted was a black tunic and cape of the same material reaching to the belt, a white collar, and a lace cap and veil. In the same year, the archbishop desired a name for the community, and McAuley chose &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot;.

McAuley was desirous that the members should combine the silence and prayer of the Carmelites, with the active labours of a Sister of Charity.

Catherine&#x27;s clerical mentor urged her to form a religious institute. Catherine and two other women, Anna Maria Doyle and Elizabeth Harley, entered the novitiate of the Presentation Sisters to formally prepare for life as religious in September 1830. On 12 December 1831 they professed vows and returned to the House of Mercy. The Sisters of Mercy consider 12 December 1831 as the day of their founding. Archbishop Daniel Murray assisted Catherine McAuley in founding the Sisters of Mercy, and accepted the vows of the first three new sisters. He then appointed Catherine Mother Superior. The rule of the Sisters of Mercy was formally confirmed by Pope Gregory XVI on 6 June 1841.

A cholera epidemic hit Dublin in 1832, and McAuley agreed to staff a cholera hospital on Townsend Street. Between 1831 and 1841 she founded additional communities in Tullamore, Charleville, Cork, Carlow, Galway, Limerick, Birr, Bermondsey and Birmingham and branch houses in Kingstown and Booterstown.

At the time of McAuley&#x27;s death, there were 100 Sisters of Mercy in ten foundations. Shortly thereafter, small groups of sisters left Ireland to establish new foundations on the east and west coasts of the United States, in Britain, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina.

At present, there are about 5,500 Sisters of Mercy worldwide, 5,000 associates, and close to half a million partners in ministry. The Mercy International Centre in Dublin, Ireland, is the international &quot;home&quot; of Mercy worldwide.

==Veneration==

Catherine McAuley died of tuberculosis on 11 November 1841 at Baggot Street, at the age of sixty-three.

In 1978, the beatification process of Catherine McAuley was opened by Pope Paul VI. In 1990, upon recognition of her heroic virtues, Pope John Paul II declared her venerable. The postulator for the cause is Brenda Dolphin RSM.

<text>The Blue Line is a rapid transit line in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, one of four rapid transit lines operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). It runs from Bowdoin station in downtown Boston under Boston Harbor to East Boston and Revere on the inner North Shore, where it terminates at Wonderland. The stop at Airport Station, by way of a free shuttle bus, is one of two rapid transit connections to Logan International Airport. In 1967, during a systemwide rebranding, the line was assigned the blue color because it passes under the Boston Harbor. With an end-to-end travel time of less than twenty minutes, the Blue Line is the shortest of Boston&#x27;s heavy-rail lines and the only line to have both third rail and overhead catenary sections.

The East Boston Tunnel was built as a streetcar tunnel in 1904 with Howard A. Carson as chief engineer; after an extension to Bowdoin in 1916, it was converted to heavy rail metro rolling stock in 1924. In 1952 and 1954 the line was extended along the former route of the Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad, in a project intended to reach Lynn but ultimately cut short to Wonderland. Further extensions to Lynn and Charles/MGH downtown are long-planned but not yet funded. From approximately 1998–2011, the MBTA made most Blue Line stations fully accessible as part of a larger effort to accommodate 6-car trains on the line. , the only station in service on the Blue Line which is not fully accessible is the downtown Boston terminus Bowdoin.

==History==
===East Boston Tunnel===

The East Boston Tunnel under Boston Harbor was the first North American subway tunnel to run beneath a body of water when it opened in 1904, and the second underwater vehicular tunnel of significant length built in the United States. The tunnel was constructed using a modified version of the Greathead Shield; of the tunnel is actually under water. The excavation took two-and-a-half years, and cost $3 million and the lives of four workmen.

Initially used as a streetcar tunnel, it ran from Maverick Square in East Boston to downtown Boston&#x27;s Court Street station, with an intermediate stop at Devonshire (now State). Court Street had pedestrian access to Scollay Square station (now Government Center) but transfers to the East Boston Tunnel required an additional fare of 1 cent. In 1906, Atlantic Station (now Aquarium) was opened, with a connection to the Atlantic Avenue Elevated. Court Street proved to be a problematic terminus as its single-track design limited frequent service.

====Bowdoin extension====

The Boston Transit Commission (BTC) began construction of a extension of the East Boston Tunnel on November 29, 1912. The extension ran from Scollay Square (where a new platform, Scollay Under, was constructed to replace Court Street station) to a new station and loop at Bowdoin Square. Tracks continued west under Cambridge Street to an incline at Joy Street, where streetcars could continue on surface tracks to Charles Street and the Longfellow Bridge to Cambridge.

Court Street station was abandoned on November 15, 1914, with service cut back to Devonshire. On March 13, 1916, service was extended to the new Scollay Under, with streetcars looping empty around the Bowdoin loop. Bowdoin station opened on March 18 along with the Joy Street Portal, which was used by a Central Square–Orient Heights through line as well as several Cambridge lines that terminated at Scollay Under. The total cost of the extension was $2.4 million.

====Metro conversion====
The East Boston Tunnel was originally planned to be operated with high-floor metro rolling stock and connected to the then-planned Cambridge Elevated line. When that plan was dropped in 1903 due to a disagreement between the Boston Transit Commission and the BERy, the stations were built with low platforms. Large bi-loading streetcars (with high floors but capable of loading from low platforms), which incorporated many attributes from metro cars used on the Main Line Elevated, began use in 1905. However, neither these nor the large center-entrance cars introduced in 1917 (which were designed for multiple unit operation) could fully handle the crowds.

In 1921, the Boston Transit Department (BTD)—the successor to the BTC—began work at Maverick Square to convert the East Boston Tunnel to high-floor metro trains. The next year, the BTD board approved the construction of high-level platforms at the four downtown stations. The Maverick Square incline was replaced with Maverick station, which provided cross-platform transfers between tunnel trains and surface streetcars.

Over the weekend of April 18–21, 1924, the East Boston Tunnel was converted to use the new high-floor trains. The tightly staged changeover required 1500 men to complete. Temporary wooden platform sections were put in place to allow service to begin on April 21, with the permanent concrete sections completed over the following months. The edges of the original low platforms can still be seen under the high platforms at State and Aquarium. Rather than modify the narrow tunnel, the BERy elected to replace the streetcars with brand-new smaller-than-usual high-platform rapid transit cars which could operate in tight clearances—particularly around the tight loop at Bowdoin. Blue Line cars are thus long, substantially shorter than the Orange Line cars and the Red Line cars.

===Revere extension===

From 1952 to 1954, a surface-level extension was constructed along the recently-defunct Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad, from Maverick to the current terminus at Wonderland. The original trackage had been narrow gauge, but was converted to standard gauge for this Revere Extension of the subway. The first above-ground station on the new extension served Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport, and was the first American urban transit connection to a commercial airfield. Beyond Maverick, the power feed was changed from third rail to overhead catenary (both at 600 V DC) to reduce the risk of winter ice buildup due to proximity to the ocean.

The line was officially renamed the East Boston Tunnel &amp; Revere Extension by the MTA in 1952, and designated as &quot;Route 3&quot; on system maps. It was renamed as the Blue Line on August 26, 1965, as part of the new MBTA&#x27;s color-based rebranding. The color blue represented water, as the line passes under Boston Harbor and travels near the coast for much of its length. Until the Silver Line was extended to Logan in 2004–05, the Blue Line was the only rapid transit connection to the airport.

On April 21, 2018, the SL3 Silver Line service to Chelsea opened with a connection to the Blue Line at Airport station, providing transfer service to Chelsea, the Seaport District and South Station.

=== Station renovations ===

Unlike the Red Line and Orange Line, which had substantial new sections and station renovations in the 1970s and 1980s, most of the Blue Line had not been substantially modified since 1954. By the 1990 passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, only and the eastbound platform at were accessible, with then under construction. In 1988, the MBTA began planning for accessibility modifications as well as platform extensions to accommodate 6-car trains - similar to what had been done on the Orange and Red lines. The project was then expected to be complete in 1994. In 1989, the MBTA awarded design contracts for modernization and platform lengthening (to accommodate six-car trains) at nine Blue Line stations. Final design on a number of the modifications - the Blue Line Modernization Project - began in 1990–92.

The first main construction phase of the project began on June 25, 1994, the line was cut back to at all times to permit reconstruction of the outer stations. and were completely rebuilt, while , and were renovated. A simultaneous $8 million noise reduction program added sound walls at Beachmont and Orient Heights, rubber mats under tracks, and soundproofing of nearby homes. The stations reopened on June 26, 1995. Unlike the other stations, Wood Island was not accessible after the 1994-95 renovation; elevators were not added until 2000.

 was closed from October 14, 2000, until October 29, 2001, for renovations, which were completed in 2003. A relocated station opened on June 3, 2004. An extensive renovation of , during which the station remained open, lasted from November 2004 to May 2011. Sequential closures of Wonderland, Wood Island, Revere Beach, and Beachmont stations took place in June through November 2008 for platform repairs.

Reconstruction of began on October 4, 2005. The project was sufficiently progressed for six-car trains to enter service on September 15, 2008, though the station was not completed until 2009. Orient Heights was closed from March 23 to November 26, 2013, for a complete reconstruction. closed from March 22, 2014, to March 21, 2016, for a complete renovation and accessibility modifications. This left all Blue Line stations accessible except for , which also has an eastbound platform that cannot be modified for six-car trains.

Service between Bowdoin and Airport was replaced by buses from May 18–31, 2020, and April 25 to May 17, 2022, for track replacement and waterproofing work in the East Boston Tunnel. During the 2022 closure, temporary ferry service between Long Wharf and East Boston was also offered. An additional closure of the outer portion of the line from May 22 to June 8, 2022, allowed for repairs to the Suffolk Downs footbridge. No fares were charged on the Blue Line from July 5 to August 31, 2023, during a closure of the Sumner Tunnel.
==Proposed expansions==
===Extension to Lynn===

There is a proposal to extend the Blue Line northward to Lynn, Massachusetts. The land to extend the line was purchased for the initial construction of the Revere Extension, but due to budgetary constraints Wonderland station was designated the northern terminus. Two potential extension routes have been identified. One proposed path would run through marshland alongside the existing Newburyport/Rockport commuter rail line, on rail lines formerly operated by the Boston and Maine Railroad. An alternative route would extend the line alongside Revere Beach Boulevard through Point of Pines and the Lynnway, along the remainder of the BRB&amp;L right of way. Other alternatives include increased commuter rail or bus service, or connecting the Blue Line to a commuter rail stop near Wonderland via a short connector.

The Blue Line extension has been proposed in various forms for over 80 years. The 1926 &quot;Report on Improved Transportation Facilities&quot; and 1945–47 &quot;Coolidge Commission Report&quot; recommended that the East Boston Tunnel line, which had been converted to rapid transit from streetcars in 1924, be extended to Lynn via the Boston, Revere Beach &amp; Lynn right-of-way. Ever since the 1954 Revere extension was cut short to Wonderland, a further extension to Lynn has been planned. Following on the 1926 and 1945-47 studies, the 1966 &quot;Program for Mass Transportation&quot; recommended that the Blue Line be extended to Lynn, while the 1969 &quot;Recommended Highway and Transit Plan&quot; proposed that the extension run as far as Salem. An extension was not present in the 1972 &quot;Final Report of the Boston Transportation Planning Review&quot;, but the 1974 &quot;Transportation Plan&quot; revived the project with possible termini of Lynn, Salem, or even Route 128 in Peabody. The 1978 &quot;Program for Mass Transportation&quot; report and 1983 Transportation Plan both continued support for an extension to Lynn. Despite the continued recommendations, however, other projects like extensions of the Red and Orange lines were given funding instead of the Blue Line.

In 2005, Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey estimated construction would begin in 2017. Authorization to bond for planning money for the project was included in an April 2008 state bond bill, and $25 million in federal earmarks have been obtained. A 2004 state bond bill authorized $246.5 million on the condition of finding 50% non-state matching funds (which presumably would come from the federal government). The Draft Environmental Impact Report was expected to be complete by the end of 2008, but was delayed as planners focused on meeting the legal deadline for the Green Line extension to Somerville and Medford.

===Red Line–Blue Line connector===

The Blue Line and Red Line are currently the only MBTA subway rail lines without a direct transfer to each other; passengers must ride one stop on the Green or Orange lines to transfer. The proposed Red–Blue connector would extend the Blue Line west from Bowdoin to an underground platform at Charles/MGH station, allowing direct transfers to the Red Line.

An extension of the East Boston Tunnel to Charles Street was considered in a 1924 study of Charles station. A 1926 proposal to convert the Tremont Street subway and connecting streetcar lines into a pair of rapid transit trunk lines called for the East Boston Tunnel to be extended south to Park Street station, with through service running between Maverick Square and Brighton using the Commonwealth Avenue line. (Three potential alignment were considered: one running south from Bowdoin, and two running southwest from a relocated Scollay Under.) Regional transportation plans from the 1940s to the early 1970s focused on suburban extensions, with no downtown extension past Bowdoin.

The rise of Kendall Square as a major employment center, the coming of the Red Line Northwest Extension, and increased traffic to Logan Airport created demand in the 1970s for a direct connection between the Red and Blue lines. A 1974 state plan again proposed an extension to Park Street, while the 1978 and 1983 Program for Mass Transportation updates called for an extension to Charles/MGH instead. A 1986 MBTA feasibility study for a Charles/MGH extension called for a cut-and-cover tunnel beginning west of Bowdoin Street with no changes to Bowdoin station. The project was then estimated to cost $79–95 million (equivalent to $– million in ). A 1987 cost-effectiveness study estimated 9,030 daily one-way trips over the extension.

In 1991, the state agreed to build a set of transit projects as part of the settlement of a lawsuit by the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) over auto emissions from the Big Dig project. Among these projects was a Red Line–Blue Line connector, to be complete by the end of 2011. The 2003–07 reconstruction of Charles/MGH station was designed to accommodate a future Blue Line platform. In 2005, the state replaced the connector with other projects providing equivalent air quality improvements. After a second lawsuit from the CLF, the state agreed in 2006 to complete design of the connector. An Expanded Environmental Notification Form was released in September 2007

The 2010 Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) instead called for a pair of deeper tunnels bored by a tunnel boring machine (TBM), starting east of Bowdoin station and passing underneath the existing platform. Keeping the existing station and loop was judged infeasible because evacuation from a disabled train would not be possible in the confined loop, and the eastbound platform is not long enough for six-car trains. Use of a TBM rather than cut-and-cover construction was intended to reduce construction cost and limit disruption on Cambridge Street. Alternatives with a replacement Bowdoin station west of Bowdoin Street, and without a replacement station, were considered; the latter was recommended due to lower cost and reduced travel time. The preferred alternative was estimated to cost $748 million and take six years to construct. Daily ridership was estimated to be 18,940 one-way trips in 2030.

Lacking available funding for construction, the MBTA did not complete design of the extension. The possibility of a public-private partnership (P3) to advance the project was studied in 2013. In 2015, the EPA removed the requirement for the MBTA to complete design. In 2018, the state commissioned a $50,000 study to reevaluate tunneling costs; it found that contrary to the 2010 DEIR, cut-and-cover tunneling could be considerably less costly than a TBM, albeit with more surface disruption. Cut-and-cover was estimated to cost $200–250 million for the tunnel costs alone, compared to $300–350 million for TBM and the $413 million estimated in the DEIR. In 2019 and 2023, the MBTA indicated plans to spend $15 million to design the connector in a five-year spending plan.

A conceptual design completed in 2020 called for cut-and-cover construction, with Bowdoin station still planned for closure. The new Blue Line level at Charles/MGH would have entrances from the existing lobby and a new headhouse in an MGH development on the north side of Charles Street. Total project cost was estimated as $850 million ($740 million for construction including 30% contingency, $50 million for design, $30 million in administration costs, and $30 million for additional rolling stock), with construction lasting from 2025 to 2030. A Notice of Project Change was issued on October 2, 2023. In November 2023, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs required the MBTA to prepare a Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Report.

A 2018 MBTA long-range planning document considered a pedestrian tunnel between the Orange Line platforms at and , which would allow transfers between the Red and Blue lines similar to (though longer than) the Winter Street Concourse between the Green and Orange lines.

====Previous connection====
A physical rail connection between the Red and Blue Lines existed in the early part of the 20th century (prior to the MBTA assigning the color designations of the subway lines). Railcars from what is today the Blue Line could emerge from a ramp portal surfacing between Joy Street and Russell Street, just beyond Bowdoin station. The railcars would run on former streetcar track down Cambridge Street and then most of the distance to the western end of the Longfellow Bridge, connecting to what is now the Red Line just east of its Cambridge subway portal, near what is now Kendall/MIT station. Because the tracks were unpowered, individual cars had to be towed along the street at night. This connection was never used in passenger service, but was used to transport Blue Line cars to the Eliot Street Yard maintenance shops then located near Harvard Square station. When the Blue Line eventually got its own maintenance shops, the connection was removed and the ramp portal was permanently covered in 1952.

==Rolling stock==
=== Current ===
Like the Orange Line and Red Line, the Blue Line tracks are standard-gauge heavy rail. The Blue Line fleet comprises 94 700-series cars (47 pairs) with stainless steel bodies from Siemens, with each car long and wide, with two pairs of doors per side. Uniquely among MBTA rolling stock, Blue Line cars use both third rail power and pantograph current pickup from overhead catenary wires. The overhead pantograph was implemented to avoid third rail icing that frequently occurs in winter. Third rail power is used in the original Blue Line tunnels, which are smaller than most modern subway tunnels. Trains switch between the two modes at Airport station, near where the line transitions between running in a tunnel and running above ground. Previously, the switchover was made underground at Maverick station.

The MBTA awarded the $174 million construction contract for the 94 cars in November 2001, with a total program cost of $200 million. The first deliveries were scheduled for January 2004, but ultimately delayed to 2007 due to manufacturing issues. The first set entered revenue service on February 20, 2008. The first three six-car trains began operating on September 15, 2008; by February 2009, eight of thirteen trainsets used at rush hour were six-car sets. By November 2009, all service was with six-car trains.

By February 2023, service was scheduled to operate at 5 to 5.5-minute headways at weekday peak hours and 9 to 11 minutes at other times. Peak service used 10–12 trains (60–72 cars), while other service used 5–6 trains (30–36 cars). The MBTA expects to replace the current fleet in the mid-2030s after a 25-year operating lifespan. A 130-car fleet is planned to replace the existing 94-car fleet.

=== Former ===
The first generation of high-floor rolling stock on the line were the No. 1 and No. 2 East Boston Rapid Transit cars, which were built by Pullman-Standard in 1923–1924 when the line was converted from streetcar operation to rapid transit. These were supplemented by the No. 3 fleet, built in 1951 by St. Louis Car Company, which was acquired for the Revere Extension. Cars in these earlier fleets were numbered in the 0500 series.

The Nos. 1–3 fleets were replaced by 70 cars in the 0600 series (No. 4 cars), built 1978-1980 by Hawker Siddeley Canada Car and Foundry of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. They were long and wide, with two pairs of doors on each side. The design was based on the PA3 model used by PATH in New Jersey. They were narrower and shorter than otherwise similar ones running on the Orange Line, due to the stations and tunnels on the Blue Line having been originally designed to accommodate streetcars. In late 2009, the Seashore Trolley Museum received retired Hawker set 622-623 for their collection. By 2011, most of the 600-series cars were retired because of severe corrosion from the salty ocean air. Several 600-series cars were retained on MBTA property but no longer usable. Parts of scrapped cars are used to maintain Orange Line 1200 series rolling stock, which were built at the same time by Hawker Siddeley and used many of the same components. In 2012, set 616-617 was placed in the former Broadway streetcar tunnel for use in emergency training.

<text>Eric Marshall McLuhan (19 January 1942 – 18 May 2018) was a communications theorist, son of Marshall McLuhan.

==Biography==
Eric McLuhan was the eldest of Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s six children. He received his BSc in communications from Wisconsin State University in 1972 and his M.A. and PhD in English Literature from the University of Dallas in 1980 and 1982. In 2007, he received the Neil Postman Award for Career Achievement in Public Intellectual Activity from the Media Ecology Association. In 2011, the University of St. Michael&#x27;s College in Toronto, Canada awarded him an L.L.D. of Sacred Letters.

Eric McLuhan coined the term &#x27;Media ecology&#x27; while teaching at Fordham University in 1967–68 with his father Marshall McLuhan. According to Eric: &quot;Media Ecology is a term I invented when we were at Fordham. I discussed it with Postman and he ran with it.&quot; &#x27;Interview with Eric McLuhan&#x27; [Laureano Ralon, 2010] 

Marshall and Eric McLuhan co-authored the books &quot;Laws of Media: The New Science&quot; (1990), &quot;Media and Formal Cause&quot; (2011), and &quot;Theories of Communication&quot; (2011). According to McLuhan associate Dean Motter, Eric also collaborated with his father on some books as a ghostwriter.

His teaching experiences were in the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto and with the McLuhan Program International. He was Director of Media Studies at the Harris Institute for the Arts in Toronto for 17 years. Prior to that he taught and tutored at York University, Dawson College and Ontario College of Art. Likewise, he was a founding partner at McLuhan and Davies Communications. He also performed the original Fordham Experiment.

McLuhan was the author of &quot;Electric Language&quot; (1998), &quot;The Role of Thunder in Finnegans Wake&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Sensus Communis, Synesthesia, and the Soul: An Odyssey&quot; (2015). He was also editor of the journal &quot;McLuhan Studies&quot; and has overseen several collections of his father&#x27;s work: &quot;The Book of Probes&quot; (2011), &quot;Marshall McLuhan Unbound&quot; (2005, with Terrence Gordon), &quot;The Medium and the Light&quot; (2010); and the co-editor of &quot;Essential McLuhan&quot; (1997, with Frank Zingrone).
Recent work included a collaboration with mime Wayne D. Constantineau, produced in a series called &quot;The Human Equation&quot; (BPS Books), which curiously included a board game. Also forthcoming is: &quot;The Dance of the Ages: Egyptian Art of the Old Kingdom and Its Relevance to the Twenty-First Century&quot;, Cambridge Scholars Press.

He lived in Ontario, Canada, continuing in retirement to work on new books, projects &amp; collections, his father&#x27;s works, his own and with collaborators.

He died in Bogotá, a day after delivering the inaugural speech for the Doctorate in Communication at University of La Sabana.

<doc id="503749" wikidata="Q4645293" url="?curid=503749" title="8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot">
<text>The 8th (King&#x27;s) Regiment of Foot, also referred to in short as the 8th Foot and the King&#x27;s, was an infantry regiment of the British Army, formed in 1685 and retitled the King&#x27;s (Liverpool Regiment) on 1 July 1881.

As infantry of the line, the 8th (King&#x27;s) peacetime responsibilities included service overseas in garrisons ranging from British North America, the Ionian Islands, India, and the British West Indies. The duration of these deployments varied considerably, sometimes exceeding a decade; its first tour of North America began in 1768 and ended in 1785.

The regiment served in numerous conflicts during its existence, notably in the wars with France that dominated the 18th and 19th centuries, the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Indian rebellion of 1857 (historically referred to as the &quot;Indian Mutiny&quot; by Britain). As a consequence of Childers reforms, the 8th became the King&#x27;s (Liverpool Regiment). A pre-existing affiliation with the city had derived from its depot being situated in Liverpool from 1873 because of the earlier Cardwell reforms.

==History==
The regiment formed as the Princess Anne of Denmark&#x27;s Regiment of Foot during a rebellion in 1685 by the Duke of Monmouth against King James II. After James was deposed during the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; that installed William III and Mary II as co-monarchs, the regiment&#x27;s commanding officer, the Duke of Berwick, decided to join his royal father in exile. His replacement as commanding officer was Colonel John Beaumont, who had earlier been dismissed with six officers for refusing to accept a draft of Catholics.
It took part in the Siege of Carrickfergus in Ireland in 1689 and in the Battle of the Boyne the following year. Further actions, while under the command of John Churchill (later 1st Duke of Marlborough) took place that year involving the regiment during the sieges of Limerick, Cork and Kinsale.

===War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714)===

For almost a decade, the regiment undertook garrison duties in England, Ireland, and the Dutch United Provinces, where it paraded for King William on Breda Heath in September 1701. On the accession of Princess Anne to the throne in 1702, the regiment became the Queen&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, although it continued to be referred to as Webb&#x27;s Regiment per an unofficial army convention that had a unit known by the name of its colonel. The War of the Spanish Succession, predicated on a dispute between a &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; and France over who would succeed Charles II of Spain, reached the Low Countries in April 1702. While Dutch marshal Prince Walrad took the initiative and besieged Kaiserswerth, the French Marshal duc de Boufflers forced Walrad&#x27;s colleague, the Earl of Athlone, to withdraw deep into the Dutch Republic. Supporting Athlone&#x27;s army, the Queen&#x27;s Regiment fought near Nijmegen in a rearguard action during the Dutch Army&#x27;s retreat between the Maas and Rhine rivers. John Churchill, Earl (later Duke) of Marlborough, ranked as Captain-General with limited authority over Dutch forces, arrived in the Low Countries soon afterwards to assume control of a multi-national army organised by the Grand Alliance. He invaded the French-controlled Spanish Netherlands and presided over a series of sieges at Venlo, Roermond, Stevensweert, and Liège, in which the regiment&#x27;s grenadier company breached the citadel. After a lull during the winter, Marlborough struggled to retain the cohesion of his army against the inclination of Dutch generals to divide his resources, while the army itself experienced a reverse at Liège in 1703.

Later in the year, the regiment assisted in the capture of Huy and Limbourg, but the campaigns in 1702 and 1703 nevertheless &quot;were largely indecisive&quot;. To aid the beleaguered Austrian Habsburgs and preserve the alliance, Marlborough sought to engage the French in a definitive set-piece battle in 1704 by advancing into Bavaria, an ally of France, and combining his force with that of Prince Eugene. As an army of 40,000 men assembled, Marlborough&#x27;s elaborate programme of deception concealed his intentions from the French. The army invaded Bavaria on 2 July and promptly captured the Schellenberg after a devastating assault that included a contingent from the Queen&#x27;s. On 13 August, the Allies encountered a Franco-Bavarian army under the overall command of the duc de Tallard, beginning the Battle of Blenheim. The Queen&#x27;s Regiment, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Sutton, supported General Lord Cutts&#x27; left wing, opposite to French-held Blenheim. According to a contemporary account by Francis Hare, Chaplain-General of Marlborough&#x27;s army, the Queen&#x27;s secured a French-constructed &quot;barrier&quot; to prevent it being used as a route of escape, taking hundreds prisoner in its vicinity. Blenheim had become congested with French soldiers and its streets filled with dead and wounded. About 13,000 French soldiers eventually surrendered, including Tallard, while the collective carnage caused more than 30,000 soldiers to become casualties.

The effective collapse of Bavaria as a French ally and the capture of its most significant fortresses followed Blenheim by year&#x27;s end. After a period of recuperation and reinforcement in Nijmegen and Breda, the Queen&#x27;s returned to active service during the Allies&#x27; attempted invasion of France, via the Moselle, in May 1705. In June, French Marshal Villeroi captured Huy and besieged Liège, forcing Marlborough to abort a campaign that lacked appreciable Allied support. The regiment became detached from Marlborough&#x27;s army to assist in the retaking of Huy before rejoining for the subsequent attack on the Lines of Brabant Although the lines were overcome, French resistance, combined with opposition among some Dutch generals and adverse weather conditions, prevented much exploitation. The Queen&#x27;s helped to seize Neerwinden, Neerhespen, and the bridge at Elixheim.

In May 1706, Villeroi, pressured by King Louis XIV to atone for France&#x27;s earlier defeats, initiated an offensive in the Low Countries by crossing the Dyle river. Marlborough engaged Villeroi&#x27;s army near Ramillies on 23 May. Along with 11 battalions and 39 squadrons of cavalry under Lord Orkney, the Queen&#x27;s fought initially in what transpired to be a feint attack on the left flank of the French lines. The feint convinced Villeroi to divert troops from the centre, while Marlborough had to use representatives to repeatedly instruct Orkney not to continue the attack. Most of Orkney&#x27;s battalions, including the Queen&#x27;s, redeployed to support Marlborough on the left. By 19:00, the Franco-Bavarian army had completely disintegrated. For the remainder of 1706, the Allies systematically captured towns and fortresses, including Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, and Ghent. The regiment fought its last siege of 1706 at Menin, one of the most formidably defended fortresses in Europe.
The threat of a French-supported Jacobite uprising in Scotland arose in 1708 and the Queen&#x27;s was among those regiments recalled to Britain. Once the Royal Navy intercepted an invasion fleet off the English coast, the regiment returned to the Low Countries, disembarking at Ostend. The French later returned to the offensive, attacking Flanders and capturing territory that had been lost in 1706. Marlborough had positioned his forces near Brussels, anticipating that an offensive might be directed against the city, and had to march his army over a period of two days. On 11 July, Marlborough led an Allied army against Bourgogne, grandson of King Louis, and Marshal Vendôme&#x27;s 100,000–man army at the Battle of Oudenarde. The Queen&#x27;s joined an advanced contingent under Lord Cadogan which crossed the Scheldt, via pontoon bridges assembled near Oudenarde, as a prelude to the arrival of the main army. While elements of the main army began to arrive at the bridges, Cadogan advanced on the village of Eyne and swiftly overwhelmed an isolated group of four Swiss mercenary battalions; three surrendered and the fourth attempted to withdraw but was intercepted by Jørgen Rantzau&#x27;s cavalry. To signify the surrender, the commanding officer of the Queen&#x27;s received some of their colours. The regiment soon became engaged in battle near the village of Herlegem, fighting through the hedges until darkness. Cadogan&#x27;s precarious situation only began to alleviate by the deployment of the Duke of Argyll&#x27;s reinforcements.

The Queen&#x27;s became occupied by a succession of sieges: at Ghent, Bruges, and Lillie. In 1709, the regiment assisted in the protracted Siege of Tournai, which capitulated in September. On the 11th, the regiment fought in the bloodiest battle of the war: Malplaquet. After being committed from reserve in the battle&#x27;s closing stages, the regiment advanced under heavy fire and fought through dense wood, having Lieutenant-Colonel Louis de Ramsay killed. The memoirs of Private Matthew Bishop, of the Queen&#x27;s Regiment, contained an account that recalled: &quot;the French were well prepared to give us a warm salute. It soon broke us in a terrible manner, though our vacancies were quickly filled up...when we got clear of the dead and wounded, we ran upon them and returning their fire, even broke them out of the breast-work.&quot;

In 1710, the regiment was represented at the sieges of Douai, Béthune, Aire and St. Venant.

===Jacobites and renewed European conflict (1715–1768)===
Rebellion against the Hanoverian King George I began in 1715 by Jacobite supporters of James Stuart, &quot;Old Pretender&quot; to the throne of Great Britain. As unrest escalated in Britain, the Queen&#x27;s Regiment arrived in Scotland and became absorbed by a Government army under the Duke of Argyll. Although numerically superior, the Jacobite army did not begin an advance south until November because of the caution of their leader, the Earl of Mar. The Duke of Argyll moved north from Stirling and positioned his forces in the vicinity of Dunblane on 12 November. On the morning of the 13th, in conditions that had frozen the ground during the night, the Battle of Sheriffmuir began.

The Queen&#x27;s Regiment formed part of General Thomas Whetham&#x27;s left wing. Confused troop movements led to both it and the Jacobite left being weaker than the corresponding right wing. While Whetham&#x27;s men attempted to readjust their dispositions, a mass of Jacobite troops began a rapid charge. Entwined in hand-to-hand combat within minutes, the sides fought until Whetham&#x27;s men broke and retreated in disarray. The Queen&#x27;s had 111 killed, including Lieutenant-Colonel Hanmer, 14 wounded, and 12 captured. The remnants withdrew from the battlefield until almost upon Stirling. Without cavalry support, the Jacobite left also broke, and the Earl of Mar abandoned the area at nightfall.

In 1716 at the behest of George I, to honour the regiment&#x27;s service at Sheriffmuir, the Queen&#x27;s became the King&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, with the White Horse of Hanover (symbol of the Royal Household) as its badge.
The King&#x27;s remained in Scotland until 1717, by which time the Jacobite uprising had been suppressed. The regiment served in Ireland between May 1717 and May 1721 and between winter 1722 and spring 1727. The regiment embarked to Flanders in winter 1742 for service in the War of the Austrian Succession. It fought at the Battle of Dettingen in June 1743 where, despite the French enjoying superiority in numbers, Britain and its Allies defeated an army under the duc de Noailles. The regiment also took part in the Battle of Fontenoy in May 1745: the King&#x27;s Regiment was positioned in the frontline of the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s army but a retreat was eventually ordered.

In 1745, Prince Charles Edward (popularly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie) landed in Scotland, seeking to restore the Stuarts to the British throne. The regiment did not become committed to battle until the Battle of Falkirk in January 1746. The regiment was part of the left wing of the front line of the army, under the command of Lieutenant-General Henry Hawley. After a failed attack by dragoons of Hawley&#x27;s army, Jacobite Army troops charged the government army, compelling the left wing of the army to withdraw while the right wing held. The rebels and Government armies both withdrew from the battlefield by night-time. The regiment also fought in the Battle of Culloden in April 1746. Once the impetuous Jacobites charged and overcame the initial volley of fire, vicious hand-to-hand fighting ensued with Hawley&#x27;s men. The King&#x27;s provided cross-fire support, firing across the front-line and into the Jacobites. The regiment sustained a single, severely wounded casualty.

The King&#x27;s fought in the Battle of Rocoux in October 1746 and the Battle of Lauffeld in July 1747. In the latter, the King&#x27;s and three other regiments became embroiled in a protracted struggle through the avenues of Val. Control of the village fluctuated throughout the battle until the Allies retreated before overwhelming numbers.

The British Army implemented a numbering system in 1751 to reflect the seniority of a regiment by its date of creation, with the King&#x27;s becoming the 8th (King&#x27;s) Regiment of Foot in the order of precedence. The beginning of the Seven Years&#x27; War, which would encompass Europe and its colonial possessions, necessitated the 8th&#x27;s expansion to two battalions, amounting to a total of 20 companies. Both battalions formed part of an expedition in 1757 that captured Île d&#x27;Aix, an island off the western coast of France, as a precursor to a planned seizure of the mainland garrison town of Rochefort. The 2nd Battalion became the 63rd Regiment of Foot in 1758.

When the regiment augmented the Hanoverian Army in 1760, the 8th King&#x27;s had its grenadier company committed to the battles of Warburg and Kloster Kampen. As a complete regiment, the 8th served at Kirch-Denkern, Paderborn, Wilhelmsthal, and the capture of Cassel.

===American Revolutionary War (1775–1783)===
In 1768, the 8th Regiment of Foot was sent from England to the Province of Quebec in British America. For the next six years the regiment garrisoned various posts in the St. Lawrence River valley. In 1774, its ten companies were dispersed to the isolated posts of the Great Lakes region: Fort Niagara (four), Fort Detroit (three), Fort Michilimackinac (two), and Fort Oswegatchie (one). With fewer than 500 soldiers, the 8th Foot was responsible for defending the entire area north of the Ohio River from the Mississippi River eastwards to the Adirondack Mountains.

During its posting, the 8th Foot possessed a number of officers adept at working with Indigenous tribes. Notable among them were Major Arent DePeyster, Captain Richard Lernoult, and Lieutenant John Caldwell. Caldwell, later 5th Baronet of Wellsborough in County Fermanagh, immersed himself in efforts to foster understanding between the British and Ojibwe, reputedly marrying a member of the tribe and becoming an honorary chief under the adopted name of &quot;The Runner&quot;. Captain Lernoult, who commanded Fort Detroit until 1779, and Major DePeyster, who succeeded Lernoult after commanding at Michilimackinac, were instrumental in maintaining the support of the Ojibwe, Odawa, Wyandot, Mingo, and Shawnee during the war. Born into a prominent New York City family of Dutch origin, DePeyster joined the British Army in 1755, was appointed commander of Fort Michilimackinac in 1774, and in 1777 arranged for roughly 200 hundred Indigenous warriors to travel to Montreal in support of the Saratoga Campaign. He repeatedly warned Indigenous warriors to avoid cruelty to prisoners and was noted for his efforts to ransom captives.
In 1775, American forces commanded by Richard Montgomery and Benedict Arnold invaded the Province of Quebec. By the beginning of December, the Americans had captured Fort Saint-Jean and Montreal, and were besieging the fortified city of Quebec. A failed attempt to storm the city during a snowstorm on the last day of December resulted in Montgomery&#x27;s death. The Americans withdrew back to Montreal in May when reinforcements from Britain began to arrive.

From Fort Oswegatchie, Captain George Forster of the 8th Foot and Claude-Nicolas-Guillaume de Lorimier of the British Indian Department led a force of 40 regulars, 40 &quot;Canadien&quot; volunteers, and a few hundred Indigenous warriors down the St. Lawrence River to attack Fort Cedars west of Montreal. The fort was held by nearly 400 Continentals under the temporary command of Major Isaac Butterfield. After two brief skirmishes on May 18, Forster demanded the fort&#x27;s surrender and warned Butterfield of the consequences should the Indigenous warriors be committed to battle. Butterfield countered with a request to withdraw under arms, which Forster refused.

Butterfield surrendered the fort on the afternoon of May 19, the same day Forster received news of an American relief force approaching the Cedars. Forster dispatched Lorimier with 30 &quot;Canadiens&quot; volunteers and 80 warriors to ambush the American column. The relief&#x27;s commander, Major Henry Sherburne, was forced to surrender after a brief battle. The engagement infuriated many of the warriors as their only fatality was a principal war chief. Forster managed to dissuade them from executing prisoners by offering ransoms.

Emboldened by the two victories, Forster continued towards Montreal and landed at Pointe-Claire, on the Island of Montreal. He withdrew back across the Lake of Two Mountains to Pointe-de-Quinchin after receiving information about the strength of Arnold&#x27;s forces at Lachine. Informed by scouts of Foster&#x27;s retreat, Arnold pursued the British in bateaux across the lake, but was deterred from landing by Forster&#x27;s men, supported by two captured artillery pieces. On the 27th, Forster sent Sherburne under a flag of truce with terms for a prisoner exchange. Arnold initially refused since one of the conditions would prevent the prisoners from rejoining the Continental Army. Forster withdrew the condition, Arnold signed the agreement, and the prisoners were released. During the negotiations both Arnold and Forster threatened the other with the prospect of atrocities: the killing of prisoners by Forster&#x27;s Indigenous allies and the destruction of Indigenous villages by Arnold&#x27;s men. The prisoner exchange was later denounced by the Second Continental Congress who refused to release any British prisoners under the pretext that abuses had been committed by Forster&#x27;s men.

In the summer of 1777, Captain Leroult, Lieutenant Henry Bird and 100 men from Fort Niagara participated in St. Leger&#x27;s expedition—a diversion in support of Major General John Burgoyne&#x27;s campaign to take control of the Hudson River valley. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Barry St. Leger, a mixed force of regulars, provincials and Indigenous warriors besieged Fort Stanwix on the Mohawk River for three weeks in August. Bird led an advance party that seized the Lower Landing before St. Leger&#x27;s main body arrived at the fort, but was too late to prevent the unloading of a batteau convoy transports supplies and reinforcements. None of the men of the 8th Foot directly participated in the destruction of Brigadier-General Nicholas Herkimer&#x27;s relief column during Battle of Oriskany.

A detachment of the 8th Foot from Detroit took part in Lieutenant Governor Henry Hamilton&#x27;s capture of Vincennes in October 1778 and garrisoned Fort Sackville during the winter. Several members of the 8th Foot were held as prisoners of war after Hamilton surrendered the fort to Lieutenant Colonel George Rogers Clark in February 1779.

A company of the regiment&#x27;s soldiers from Niagara were present at the Cherry Valley massacre in November 1778. Under the command of Captain Walter Butler of Butler&#x27;s Rangers, the regulars and two companies of rangers attacked Fort Alden while several hundred Seneca and Cayuga raided the neighbouring farms and village. Angry over false accusations of atrocities after the Battle of Wyoming, and the destruction by American forces of Unadilla and Onaquaga in early October, the Seneca and Cayuga killed 30 non-combatants including women and children. 

In the winter of 1779, Lernoult sent Bird, who had been promoted to captain, and a few volunteers from the 8th Foot with interpreter Simon Girty to the Sandusky River. There they assembled a Wyandot and Mingo war party and began a siege of the recently constructed Fort Laurens. Due to the harsh winter conditions, Bird and Girty lifted the siege after a month and withdrew back to Detroit, shortly before American reinforcements arrived.

A small detachment of the 8th Foot was present at the Battle of Newtown in 1779. In what was the only major battle of the Sullivan Campaign, Major John Butler led a mixed force of Butler&#x27;s Rangers, Brant&#x27;s Volunteers, Seneca, and Cayuga in an unsuccessful attempt to hold back Major General John Sullivan&#x27;s army.

In May 1780, Major DePeyster ordered an expedition against American forces at the Falls of the Ohio (Louisville). He choose Captain Bird to lead the force of 150 soldiers from the 8th Foot, 47th Foot, Royal Artillery, and Detroit militia, accompanied by 100 Indigenous warriors from the Detroit area. At the confluence of the Ohio and Great Miami rivers, Bird rendezvoused with Alexander McKee of the British Indian Department who had recruited several hundred warriors from the Ohio Country. Although Bird&#x27;s orders were to proceed to the Falls of the Ohio, he was overruled by his Indigenous allies who preferred to attack the isolated settlements on the Licking River in Kentucky In late June, Bird&#x27;s expedition destroyed the fortified settlements of Ruddle&#x27;s Fort and Martin&#x27;s Station. A number of non-combatants were killed or wounded at Ruddle&#x27;s Fort when the Indigenous warriors ignored the terms of surrender and took most of the inhabitants captive. Bird was able to prevent a repeat when Martin&#x27;s Station surrendered, however, both forts were plundered and burned. Afterwards, Bird&#x27;s regulars and militia escorted about 150 men, women and children to Detroit, arriving there in early August. Of the 200–250 prisoners taken by the Indigenous auxiliaries, most were brought to Detroit, but a number were killed en route, and few others, mostly young women and children, were held captive until the end of the war. 

In August 1780, Major General Frederick Haldimand, Governor of the Province of Quebec, authorized a large-scale raid against the Schoharie and Mohawk River valleys of New York. The expedition, under the command of Sir John Johnson consisted of soldiers from the 8th Foot, the 34th Regiment of Foot, Butler&#x27;s Rangers, and the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York, also known as the Royal Yorkers. With them were Brant&#x27;s Volunteers, and a contingent of Seneca. A coehorn mortar, a 3-pound &quot;grasshopper&quot; and ten Royal Artillery soldiers also accompanied the 940 man strong force. The 8th Foot saw action at the Battle of Stone Arabia, where the regiment suffered its only battle fatality during the war, and at the inconclusive Battle of Klock&#x27;s Field. Governor George Clinton later reported to the Continental Congress that the raid had destroyed 150,000 tons of grain and 200 dwellings, and that &quot;Schenectady may now be said to become the limits of our western Frontier.&quot;

A similar expedition the following year was commanded by Major John Ross of the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York, and again involved soldiers of the 8th Foot as well as from the 34th Foot and Butler&#x27;s Rangers. On October 25, 1781, Ross engaged several hundred patriot militia commanded by Colonel Marinus Willett at the Battle of Johnstown. Five days later, as Ross withdrew towards Oswego, a rear-guard action at West Canada Creek resulted in the death of Walter Butler.

In 1782, Haldimand received orders from England to cease offensive operations. The 1783 Treaty of Paris officially ended the war and placed Fort Niagara, Fort Detroit, Fort Michilimackinac, Fort Oswegatchie and Fort Haldimand in American territory. Due to the failure of the Americans to adher to some of the terms of the treaty, the British retained control of the forts until the Jay Treaty of 1796. The 8th Regiment of Foot, however, was relieved in 1785. The regiment gathered at Quebec and after 17 years in North America, sailed for England in September 1785. Many members of the regiment including Bird, however, elected to remain and settle in what is now Ontario.

===French Revolutionary War===
In 1793, revolutionary France declared war on Great Britain. The King&#x27;s became assigned to an expeditionary force sent to the Netherlands under the command of Prince Frederick, Duke of York. In 1794, the regiment attempted to lift the French Siege of Nijmegen. The allies planned a nocturnal attack, with the march conducted without audible commotion. The force leapt into the French earthworks, with hand-to-hand fighting ensuing. Despite the success, the town of Nijmegen was soon evacuated and the British withdrew from the Netherlands in 1795.

In 1799, the King&#x27;s became resident on Menorca, which had been captured from Spain the previous year. In 1801, the regiment landed at Abukir Bay, Egypt, with an expedition sent under the command of General Ralph Abercromby to counter a French invasion. The King&#x27;s participated in the capture of Rosetta, 65 miles west of Alexandria, and a fort located in Romani. The British completed the occupation of Egypt by September.

===Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812===
The regiment was sent to Gibraltar in 1802 and returned to England in 1803. It landed at Cuxhaven in Germany in October 1805 as part of the Hanover Expedition, but was withdrawn in February 1806 before taking part in the Battle of Copenhagen in August 1807.

The 1st Battalion moved to Canada in 1808 as the Napoleonic Wars extended to the Americas. Within a year, in January 1809, the battalion had embarked at Barbados with an expeditionary force comprising two divisions assembled to invade Martinique. Although a number of engagements with the French garrison preceded the island&#x27;s seizure, disease represented the principal threat to Britain&#x27;s five-year occupation. By October 1809, some 1,700 of more than 2,000 casualties had succumbed to disease. The 8th Foot returned to Nova Scotia in April, having had its commanding officer, Major Bryce Maxwell, and four others killed in a skirmish with French soldiers on the Surirey Heights during the advance on Fort Desaix in February. When sustained tension between the United States and Britain culminated in the War of 1812, the 1st and 2nd battalions were based in Quebec and Nova Scotia respectively.

Sporadic raids into Canada on the eastern frontier provided impetus for a former regimental officer, Lieutenant-Colonel &quot;Red&quot; George MacDonnell, to encroach into New York State and attack Ogdensburg in February 1813. To reach their destination, the 8th Foot and Canadian militia had to traverse across the frozen St. Lawrence River and through dense snow. After gaining control of the fort following close-quarters battle, the British destroyed the main barracks and three anchored vessels, and departed with provisions and prisoners. Ogdensburg would not be reestablished as a frontier garrison, ensuring relative peace in the region.
In April 1813, two companies of the 8th, elements of the Canadian militia, and Native American allies attempted to repulse an American attack on York (present-day Toronto). As the Americans landed on the shoreline, the grenadier company engaged them in a bayonet charge with 46 killed, including its commanding officer, Captain Neal McNeale. The Americans nevertheless overwhelmed the area but subsequently incurred 250 casualties, notably General Zebulon Pike, when retreating British regulars detonated Fort York&#x27;s Grand Magazine.

While garrisoning Fort George, at Newark (present day Niagara-on-the-Lake), in May 1813 with companies of the Glengarries and Runchey&#x27;s Company of Coloured Men, the 8th Foot attempted to disrupt an amphibious landing by the Americans. Although numerically inferior, the British delayed the invasion and retreated without disorder. In June 1813, the 8th and 49th regiments assaulted an American encampment at Stoney Creek. Five companies from the two British regiments engaged more than 4,000 Americans in a nocturnal battle. Although the Americans had two brigadiers captured and suffered losses, the British commander, Colonel John Harvey, considered the possibility of his opponents realising their numerical advantage too compelling to ignore and withdrew.

In July 1814 the regiment fought in the Battle of Chippawa in which the British commander General Phineas Riall retreated after he misidentified American regulars for militia. Later in the month, the regiment fought in the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane. The British, Canadian and Native soldiers, under the command of Lieutenant-General Gordon Drummond, engaged the American force. It was one of the bloodiest battles recorded on Canadian territory. The following month, the King&#x27;s took part in the action at Snake Hill during the siege of Fort Erie. In September 1814 the Americans attacked the British posts with overwhelming force and the regiment suffered heavy losses. The King&#x27;s Regiment received the battle honour &#x27;Niagara&#x27; for its contributions to the war. The regiment landed back in England in summer 1815.

===Indian rebellion and Second Afghan War===

Between the end of the War of 1812 and the Indian rebellion of 1857, (variously known from the oldest &quot;Sepoy Mutiny&quot; to the recent &quot;First War of Independence&quot;) the King&#x27;s undertook a variety of duties in Bermuda, Canada, Cephalonia, Corfu, Gibraltar, Ireland, Jamaica, Malta and Zante. In 1846, the regiment began a 14-year posting to India, stationed initially in the Bombay Presidency. At the beginning of the rebellion in May 1857, the 8th Foot occupied a cantonment in Jullundur, together with three Indian regiments and two troops of horse artillery.

The complex array of motives and causes that culminated in the mutiny of much of the Bengal Army would be catalysed in 1857 by rumours that beef and pork fat was being used to grease paper rifle cartridges. Confined first to a number of Bengal regiments, the mutiny eventually manifested in some areas as a more diverse, albeit disparate, rebellion against British rule. Soon after reports were received of the first mutiny at Meerut on 10 May, the 8th&#x27;s commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Hartley, had two companies secure the fort of Phillaur, near Jullundur, due to the significance of its magazine stores and reports that the 3rd Bengal Native Infantry intended to seize it.
After a period of seven weeks in Jullundur, the regiment became attached to an army preparing to besiege Delhi. Because of a shortage of troops, due primarily to cholera and other diseases, several weeks elapsed before the British had attained a strength sufficient to commence operations.

In July 1857, two companies supported a position that had been under attack for seven hours. The King&#x27;s participated in the capture of Ludlow Castle, in the vicinity of Kashmir Gate in the northern walls of Delhi. Grouped into the 2nd Column with the 2nd Bengal Fusiliers and 4th Sikhs, the 8th King&#x27;s attacked Delhi early on 14 September with the intent of capturing the Water Bastion and Kashmiri Gate. Once the city had been secured by the British, the 8th&#x27;s Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Greathed vacated his position and became commander of a column dispatched to Cawnpore. The regiment, commanded by Major Hinde, had been seriously depleted and the combined total of it and the 75th Foot numbered just 450. The regiment also took part in the second Relief of Lucknow in November, seeing much action until withdrawing, after the evacuation of civilians, on the 22nd. In an environment of systematic reprisal by the British, Captain Octavius Anson, of the 9th Lancers, recalled observing acts of punitive violence against Indian civilians, including the alleged killing of incapacitated villagers by soldiers of the 8th Foot.

The 1st Battalion was brought back to Britain in 1860. It spent the year 1865 in Dublin, Ireland, where the battalion supported garrison operations against Irish Republican activity in the city. Then, after two years in Malta, the 1st King&#x27;s returned to India in 1868. where it remained for a decade. The regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, which had been reconstituted in 1857, was itself posted to Malta (in 1863) and India (in 1877), and met up with the 1st King&#x27;s on the island and at Mundra, in the Bombay Presidency.

Within a year of the battalion&#x27;s arrival in India, in November 1878, Britain invaded Afghanistan when an ultimatum to its ruler by the Viceroy of India, Lord Lytton, went unanswered. Lytton&#x27;s demands had followed the reluctant hosting of a Russian mission to Kabul by Sher Ali and the prevention of a similar British mission from entering Afghanistan at Ali Masjid. Though still acclimatising and consequently susceptible to fever, the 2nd King&#x27;s was allocated to the Kurram Valley Field Force, under Major-General Frederick Roberts. The 2nd King&#x27;s fought at the Battle of Peiwar Kotal in November 1878.

The regiment was not fundamentally affected by the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, which gave it a depot at Peninsula Barracks, Warrington from 1873, or by the Childers reforms of 1881 – as it already possessed two battalions, there was no need for it to amalgamate with another regiment. Under the reforms the regiment was renamed the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool) on 1 July 1881.

<text>The King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool) was one of the oldest line infantry regiments of the British Army, having been formed in 1685 when a single battalion was raised as The Princess Anne of Denmark&#x27;s Regiment of Foot.
The original uniform consisted of a long scarlet coat turned up with yellow. Yellow breeches and waistcoat, white cravat, broad brimmed hat turned up and adorned with yellow ribbon, white stockings and &#x27;serviceable&#x27; shoes.

In 1702 when she succeeded the throne as Queen Anne, the sovereign ordered the title to be altered to The Queen&#x27;s Regiment. In 1751, when all British Army infantry regiments were numbered, the title became; 8th or The King&#x27;s Regiment after the then monarch King George II, and was from then onward referred to as 8th Foot, 8th Regiment or 8th King&#x27;s.

Unlike most British Army infantry regiments, which were associated with a county, the King&#x27;s represented the city of Liverpool, one of only four regiments affiliated to a city in the British Army. After 273 years of continuous existence, the regiment was amalgamated with the Manchester Regiment in 1958 to form the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool and Manchester), which was later amalgamated with the King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment and the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment to form the present Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment (King&#x27;s, Lancashire and Border).

The King&#x27;s notably saw active service in the Second Boer War, the two world wars, and the Korean War. In the First World War, the regiment contributed dozens of battalions to the Western Front, Salonika, and the North West Frontier. More than 13,000 men were killed. In the Second World War, the 5th and 8th (Irish) battalions landed during Operation Overlord, the 1st and 13th fought as Chindits in the Burma campaign, and the 2nd Battalion served in Italy and Greece. The King&#x27;s later fought in the Korean War, earning the regiment&#x27;s last battle honour.

Nine Victoria Crosses were awarded to men of the regiment, the first in 1900 and the last in 1918. An additional two were awarded to Royal Army Medical Corps officer Noel Godfrey Chavasse, who was attached to the 10th (Scottish) Battalion during the Great War.

In peacetime, the regiment&#x27;s battalions were based in the United Kingdom and colonies in the British Empire. Duties varied: riots were suppressed in Belfast, England, and the Middle East; bases were garrisoned in places such as the North-West Frontier Province and West Germany; and reviews and parades conducted throughout the regiment&#x27;s history.

==Colonial wars (1881–1914)==
The Cardwell–Childers reforms from the 1860s to the 1880s substantially reorganised the British Army, principally by amalgamating single-battalion regiments to form regiments of multiple battalions. The King&#x27;s, which already had two regular battalions, did not amalgamate, but did adopt a new title on the numbering system&#x27;s abolition. Thus, on 1 July 1881, the two battalions of the 8th (The King&#x27;s) Regiment of Foot became the 1st and 2nd Battalions, The King&#x27;s (Liverpool) Regiment. The 8th Foot had been associated with Liverpool since 1873, when it became allocated to the town&#x27;s 13th Brigade Depot. Regular regiments gained auxiliary battalions through the integration of the militia and volunteers, of which nine from Lancashire and the Isle of Man transferred to the King&#x27;s and ultimately became part of the Special Reserve and Territorial Force.

The battalions after the 1881 reforms included:

Regulars
* 1st Battalion
* 2nd Battalion

Militia
* 3rd (Militia) Battalion, former 1st Battalion, 2nd Royal Lancashire Militia (The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Own Rifles)
* 4th (Militia) Battalion, former 2nd Battalion, 2nd Royal Lancashire Militia (The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Own Rifles)

Rifle Volunteers
* [5th] 1st Lancashire Rifle Volunteer Corps, became 1st Volunteer Battalion in 1888
* [6th/7th] 5th Lancashire (The Liverpool Rifle Volunteer Brigade) Rifle Volunteer Corps acting as a double battalion, became 2nd and 3rd Volunteer Battalions in 1888
* [8th] 15th Lancashire Rifle Volunteer Corps, became 4th Volunteer Battalion in 1888
* [9th] 18th (Liverpool Irish) Rifle Volunteer Corps (also including the Isle of Man RVC), became 5th (Irish) Volunteer Battalion in 1888
* [10th] 19th (Liverpool Press Guard) Lancashire Rifle Volunteers, became 6th Volunteer Battalion in 1888

Under the new system, it was envisaged that one regular battalion would be based in the United Kingdom and one overseas. The 1st Battalion had been in North West England since the late 1870s and had been bombed while based at Salford Barracks in 1881. The attack had been the first in a dynamite campaign instigated by the Irish Republican Jeremiah O&#x27;Donovan Rossa. The barracks sustained only minor structural damage from the explosion, which killed a child and badly wounded its mother. Soon afterwards, rioting during mineworkers&#x27; strikes in Chowbent, Wigan, and Warrington required the battalion&#x27;s intervention to prevent further disorder. In 1882, the battalion moved to Ireland, based in the Curragh. During the otherwise uneventful posting, the 1st responded to riots in Belfast. The sectarian disorder coincided with the introduction of the 1886 Home Rule Bill in the British Parliament. The battalion returned to England three years later.
The 2nd King&#x27;s had been on the Indian subcontinent since 1877 and had fought in the Second Afghan War. The Third Burmese War punctuated the battalion&#x27;s overseas service in the 1880s. Intent on deposing Upper Burma&#x27;s King Thibaw and imposing imperial rule, Britain issued an ultimatum consisting of demands that were rejected as anticipated. The invasion began in November 1885 in the form of the Burma Field Force, which progressed up the Irrawaddy River via transports, enabling the rapid capture of frontier forts and the capital Mandalay. After the capital&#x27;s seizure, the battalion provided an escort that oversaw the exile of Thibaw. A guerrilla campaign against the British followed the completion of Upper Burma&#x27;s annexation on 1 January 1886, lasting for at least five years. For more than a year, the King&#x27;s operated in small groups pursuing guerrillas in the Burmese jungle. Casualties numbered 12 officers and 256 men by the time the battalion had returned to India. In early 1900 the 2nd Battalion Liverpool Regiment was stationed at Gibraltar.

Overseas service for the 1st King&#x27;s included a two-year residence in Nova Scotia, beginning in 1893. In January 1895, the battalion provided a 100-man guard of honour when the body of Canadian Prime Minister John Thompson was returned from Britain. The battalion subsequently became stationed in the West Indies, then Cape Colony in 1897. The Second Boer War began two years later. Prior to the outbreak of the war, as the discord between the British and Boer republics escalated, the 1st King&#x27;s formed a company of mounted infantry and underwent intensive training at Ladysmith, Natal Colony. War was declared on 11 October and Natal invaded by a Boer force under General Piet Joubert. General George White held authority over 13,000 British personnel dispersed throughout Natal. Heavy losses were incurred by the British in the first major engagements of the war, at Talana Hill and Elandslaagte. Retreat to Ladysmith, where the British concentrated its largest contingent, ensued. Having besieged Kimberley and Mafikeng, Boers converged upon Ladysmith and positioned artillery pieces on surrounding hills overlooking the town.
On 30 October, General White ordered an attack on northern Boer positions. White&#x27;s plans were described as vague, ambitious, and complicated, and the battle proved a disaster that became known to the British as &quot;Mournful Monday&quot;. The 1st King&#x27;s were allocated to Colonel Grimwood&#x27;s column, which intended to advance on and secure Long Hill, believed to constitute the Boer&#x27;s left flank. Unbeknownst to Grimwood, almost half of the brigade separated from the column during the night march while following a rightward deviation by the artillery batteries, including the oblivious 1st King&#x27;s and Royal Dublin Fusiliers. In the morning light, the brigade discovered that its right flank was exposed by the distance of John French&#x27;s cavalry and that Long Hill was unoccupied. Grimwood and French&#x27;s men became pinned down by heavy rifle and artillery fire. Amidst rumours of an attack against the town being imminent and failure evident, White ordered the column to retreat at noon. The artillery provided cover during the chaos that followed and prevented greater loss of life. At Nicholson&#x27;s Nek, to the north-west of Long Hill, the Boers took more than 1,000 prisoner.

The Boers enclosed Ladysmith on 2 November, beginning a 118-day siege. The King&#x27;s, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Llewelyn Mellor, became assigned to the north-eastern defensive sector under Colonel Knox, a disciplinarian who instituted a programme of fortification development in his area. Construction of the defences occurred mostly at night, although rain, oppressive heat, and cold limited the opportunity to rest. On 6 January, the King&#x27;s mounted infantry helped repulse a Boer attempt to penetrate the southern perimeter. By late January, the scarcity of supplies had become particularly acute. Disease pervaded while the town resorted to consuming the garrison&#x27;s horses and mules.

Reinforcements began to arrive in South Africa in November under General Redvers Buller. The relief of the three besieged garrisons became the general&#x27;s priority. He divided his corps and assumed personal command of the Ladysmith expedition. The relief effort was hindered by three successive defeats in December, termed by the British as &quot;Black Week&quot;, and further reverses in January and early February. The siege of Ladysmith ended on 28 February. The King&#x27;s then gained a volunteer company and had its mounted infantry absorbed by an MI battalion.
Britain eventually extended its prosecution of the war into the Orange Free State and Transvaal Republic. On 21 August, at Van Wyk&#x27;s Vlei, Sergeant Hampton and Corporal Knight held their positions and evacuated wounded mounted Kingsmen under heavy fire, for which they received the Victoria Cross. Two days later, Boer forces attacked the 1st Battalion while it was at the forefront of an advance south of Dalmanutha. The protracted engagement ended when the King&#x27;s were ordered to withdraw, having almost expended their ammunition. Casualties exceeded 70, while Private Heaton earned the Victoria Cross.

The nominal annexation of the Orange Free State and Transvaal Republic in May and September did not resolve the war. Instead, the Boer commandos transitioned to guerrilla warfare and resisted the British until 1902. The King&#x27;s concentrated in the Eastern Transvaal, where Boers under Botha and Viljoen operated. Detachments occupied networks of blockhouses and provided complements for armoured trains. One such detachment was overwhelmed at Helvetia on 29 December. Situated near the Lydenburg–Machadodorp railway, Helvetia was garrisoned primarily by a contingent of the King&#x27;s equipped with a 4.7-in gun nicknamed &quot;Lady Roberts&quot;. The nocturnal attack, conducted in fog, yielded considerable success for the Boers with scores of prisoners taken and the gun captured. Only King&#x27;s Kopje withstood the attack. The circumstances were controversial and a general court-martial later sentenced Major Stapleton Cotton, who ordered the surrender, to be cashiered and dismissed from the army. Author Arthur Conan Doyle publicly questioned the decision and contended that the wounds Major Cotton sustained merited &quot;some revision&quot; of the officer&#x27;s sentence.

With the continuation of the war in South Africa, a number of regiments containing large centres of population formed additional regular battalions. The King&#x27;s (Liverpool Regiment) formed 3rd and 4th regular Battalions in February 1900, when the militia battalions were relabeled as the 5th and 6th battalions. The Boer War also provided the first opportunity for the regiment&#x27;s volunteer battalions to serve overseas with regular forces, supplying individual detachments and service companies. The militia battalions, numbered the 5th and 6th during the war, contrastingly deployed to South Africa intact late in the conflict. A memorial sculpted by William Goscombe John to commemorate the regiment&#x27;s service in Afghanistan, Burma, and South Africa was erected in St John&#x27;s Gardens, Liverpool and unveiled by Field Marshal Sir George White on 9 September 1905.

Following the end of the war in South Africa, the 2nd battalion was in September 1902 stationed in Limerick. The 1st battalion was stationed in Rangoon from late November the same year, with a company posted to the Andaman Islands.

In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had two Reserve and six Territorial battalions.

==First World War==

===1914–1915===
The regiment fielded 49 battalions during the First World War, from a pre-war establishment of two regular, two special reserve, and six territorial. Of those battalions, 26 served abroad, including (unusually for Special Reservists) the 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion. The last surviving volunteer battalion in the British Army, the 7th Isle of Man, also mobilised two service companies for Salonika. In total the regiment received 58 battle honours and six Victoria Crosses for service on the Western Front, the Balkans, India, and Russia. Some 13,795 Kingsmen died during the course of the war, the battalions suffering an average of 615 deaths. Thousands more would be wounded, sick, or taken prisoner. Of specific formations, the four Liverpool Pals battalions had nearly 2,800 casualties, while the 55th (West Lancashire) Division&#x27;s 165th (Liverpool) Brigade, composed entirely of battalions from the King&#x27;s, incurred 1,672 dead, 6,056 wounded, and 953 missing during the period of 3 January 1916 and 11 November 1918.

A vigorous recruiting campaign involving pre-war personalities such as Lord Kitchener and Lord Derby facilitated the rapid expansion of the British Army. Territorial units formed duplicate battalions from August 1914 to May 1915. To differentiate them, they were, for instance, designated the 2/5th and 3/5th battalions, respectively. Second-line battalions had been raised for home service and recruit training, but were ultimately dispatched to the Western Front and replaced by the third-line. Driven by a conviction that the war would not be resolved quickly and seeking an alternative to the Territorial Army, Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener appealed for an initial 100,000 volunteers to form a &quot;New Army&quot;. The 17th Earl of Derby proposed forming a battalion of &quot;Pals&quot; for the King&#x27;s Regiment, to be recruited from men of the same workplace. His proposal proved successful. Within a week, thousands of Liverpudlians had volunteered for service, to eventually be formed into the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Battalions. Collectively, the battalions became known as the City of Liverpool battalions or &quot;Liverpool Pals&quot;. Lord Derby addressed recruits on 28 August:

Mobilisation began at the onset of the war, in August 1914, at which time the 1st King&#x27;s was based at Aldershot. Under command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.S. Bannatyne, the 1st King&#x27;s boarded the SS &quot;Irrawaddy&quot; at Southampton. The battalion landed at Le Havre on 13 August with the 6th Brigade, 2nd Division, one of the original components of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The BEF first engaged the German Army at Mons, Belgium, after which it went into a retreat that was sustained until 5 September, when the Allies resolved to stand at the Marne, a river east of Paris. Having acted as a rearguard to the 2nd Division, the 1st King&#x27;s and its brigade prevented a German force cutting off the 4th (Guards) Brigade, forming the rearguard at Villers-Cotteréts, and 70th Battery, Royal Field Artillery. The brigade extricated the guns, earning it praise from the 2nd Division&#x27;s commanding officer, Major-General Monro.

The Allies halted the German advance in the First Battle of the Marne; the ensuing retreat, which prompted an Allied counter-offensive, ended at the Aisne. After both battles had been fought, the battalion moved north to Ypres, during the so-called &quot;Race to the Sea&quot;. In an action at Langemarck during the First Battle of Ypres, the battalion captured the small village of Molenaarelstoek, just north-east of Polygon Wood. As the battle progressed, the German command sought a decisive victory against the outnumbered BEF and launched First Ypres&#x27; last major assault on 11 November.

Located to the south of Polygon Wood, the 1st King&#x27;s was one of only a few units available to defend British lines. A force of &quot;12 and a half&quot; divisions, including a composite of the élite Prussian Guard, attacked at 0900 along a front extending from Messines to Polygon. Some German units breached the front in places but quickly lost momentum and were gradually pushed back by a desperate defence. The Prussian Guard had advanced in dense formations, each guardsman effectively side by side and led by sword-wielding officers. In the defence of Polygon Wood, the 1st King&#x27;s held on and virtually destroyed the 3rd Prussian Foot Guards with concentrated rapid-fire and artillery support. By battle&#x27;s end, the 1st King&#x27;s casualties numbered 33 officers and 814 other ranks from an original strength of 27 officers and 991 other ranks. Among the battalion&#x27;s dead was Lieutenant-Colonel Bannatyne, killed by a sniper on 24 October.

By the end of March 1915, the King&#x27;s had eight battalions on the Western Front. The 1st and 1/5th participated in a &quot;holding&quot; attack at Givenchy designed to support the Allied offensive at Neuve Chapelle. An ineffectual preliminary bombardment failed to destroy much of the barbed wire, fatally impeding the 1st King&#x27;s. The withering hail-of-fire inflicted heavy casualties on the King&#x27;s, one of whom was the wounded Lieutenant-Colonel Carter. A platoon under Lieutenant Miller managed to reach German lines and blockade itself in a communications trench for over an hour, under fire from Allied artillery, until withdrawing to British lines. The battalion&#x27;s casualties amounted to 61 killed, 115 wounded, and 62 missing.

One month later, on 24 April, a German offensive began Second Ypres, which became the 4th and 1/6th King&#x27;s first major battle. In the second subsidiary action of the offensive, at Saint-Julien, the 4th King&#x27;s sustained more than 400 casualties over a four-day period, the majority, some 374, while supporting the 1/4th Gurkha Rifles on the 27th. The 1/6th supported 1st Cheshires in the defence of Hill 60. After the regiment&#x27;s involvement in &#x27;Second Ypres&#x27; receded, four battalions fought at Festubert, collectively incurring in excess of 1,200 casualties. Lance Corporal Tombs became the regiment&#x27;s first Victoria Cross recipient of the war for assisting wounded soldiers during the battle. The 1/10th Battalion fought its first battle on 16 June, in a &quot;local&quot; action at Bellewaarde. Losses for the Liverpool Scottish neared 400 killed, wounded and missing, with just two of 24 officers present surviving unscathed.

The British instigated a new offensive on 25 September, at Loos, to coincide with French offensives in the Champagne and Artois regions. The King&#x27;s were represented in the offensive by eight battalions, from standard infantry to pioneers. Some 150 tons of Chlorine gas was used on the first day of the battle, discharged via thousands of cylinders. Strong winds blew the gas backwards, hindering the advance of the 1st King&#x27;s and other units having to also contend with partially uncut barbed wire. The advance of the 1/9th King&#x27;s also stalled, though they took about 300 Germans prisoner. The battalion later assisted in the repulse of a German counter-attack on 8 October. More battalions arrived before the year ended, including the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Liverpool Pals, which formed the 89th Brigade, 30th Division.

===1916–1917===
The Liverpool Pals&#x27; first battle came during &quot;The Big Push&quot; on 1 July 1916, on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, the worst single day for casualties in British military history. The 89th Brigade, under the Earl of Derby&#x27;s brother Brigadier F.C. Stanley, still comprised the 17th, 19th, and 20th Pals, but had the 18th reassigned to the 21st Brigade in December. The 30th Division formed part of XIII Corps, which attacked towards Montauban, south of where Britain suffered the majority of its nearly 60,000 casualties on the 1st. At 07:30, the 30th Division began its advance on the left of the French Corps de Fer. Meeting limited opposition, the Pals completed their objectives with comparatively minimal casualties. Grievous losses were, however, incurred by the 18th from heavy machine-gun fire during its advance towards the Glatz Redoubt. The battalion&#x27;s commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel E.H. Trotter, killed by a shell on 8 July, intentionally underestimated the battalion&#x27;s casualties of about 500 to avoid the deployment of brigade reserves.

More battalions entered the fray throughout the offensive. Some 14 battalions contributed to five attempts to capture the village of Guillemont between July and September. In the early hours of 8 August, in the third attempt, the 1st, 1/5th, and 1/8th attacked in conditions that rendered visibility poor. The 1st and 1/8th reached the German front-line trenches and entered the village. Their situation deteriorated, however, and the 1/8th&#x27;s support battalion was driven back by Germans who continued to occupy the first-line trenches. Isolated and contained by counter-attacks, the 1/8th and three companies of the 1st were surrounded and mostly captured. The 1/8th had been annihilated, with losses amounting to 15 killed, 55 wounded, and 502 missing, while the 1st lost its commanding officer, Colonel Goff, and sustained 239 casualties. The 1st later received a draft of 20 officers and 750 men from the Manchester Regiment.

Wanting to alleviate the pressure on the French to the south and believing there might still be some holding out, high command ordered the 2nd and 55th divisions to resume the battle on the 9th. The attack failed and proved to be ill-prepared and disorganised, with an identical starting time and objectives. For his actions during the battle, Captain Chavasse, attached to the Liverpool Scottish, gained the first of two VCs for attending to and rescuing wounded in no man&#x27;s land. The village would not be captured until the final struggle began on 3 September, by which time the 12th was the King&#x27;s only contribution, and the regiment had more than 3,000 casualties.

After the Somme Offensive ended in November, the Allies began to prepare for a series of combined Allied offensives in April 1917. These plans would not be significantly disrupted by the German Army&#x27;s strategic withdrawal to the &quot;Hindenburg Line&quot; in northern France. The phased withdrawal, conducted from February to April, reduced the German front by . The regiment&#x27;s six second-line battalions arrived on the Western Front with the 57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division in February 1917.

To support the ill-fated Nivelle Offensive, Britain initiated the Battle of the Scarpe, in the Arras area on 9 April, which involved the regiment&#x27;s 11th, 13th, and Liverpool Pals battalions. The 13th moved forward with the 3rd Division at 0530, near Tilloy-les-Mofflaines, capturing almost 500 men and completing its objectives. To the south, barbed wire obstructed the Pals with varied results. The 18th consolidated in front of the wire until relieved on the 10th, while the 19th and 20th were eventually withdrawn, having suffered heavy losses within about of the wire. Casualties for the King&#x27;s during the initial phase of the Arras Offensive exceeded 700.

While the battle raged in Arras, the Allies prepared for an offensive in the north, in Flanders. &quot;Third Ypres&quot; (or Passchendaele) became notorious for conditions that transformed the terrain of shell holes and trenches into a quagmire of mud. Ten of the regiment&#x27;s battalions were active in the first stage, the Battle of Pilkem Ridge (31 July – 2 August). Six belonged to the 55th Division, situated in the Wieltje sector, north of the Liverpool Pals. The territorial battalions overcame their first and second objectives, but progress was difficult. Confusion prevailed during the 18th King&#x27;s and 2nd Wiltshires nocturnal advance through Sanctuary Wood. The Pals battalions had to consolidate in front of the 30th Division&#x27;s initial objective. The King&#x27;s losses accumulated, surpassing 1,800 by the 3rd, with the supporting 1/8th&#x27;s casualties the heaviest at 18 officers and 304 other ranks. The 10th&#x27;s medical officer, Captain Chavasse, received a posthumous, second Victoria Cross for attending to, and recovering, wounded in spite of his own wounds and fatigue during the battle. He succumbed to his wounds on 4 August.

An account by Captain Wurtzburg, 2/6th Liverpool Rifles, described the conditions endured by soldiers in the Ypres area:

===1918===

The King&#x27;s contributed to the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 and assisted in defensive actions as the new year neared. Acute manpower shortages in the BEF on the Western Front left many divisions understrength and so it was decided to adopt a nine-battalion system through amalgamations and disbandments. The 5th, 8th, 9th, and 10th King&#x27;s integrated with their second-line, while hundreds of their men were distributed to other King&#x27;s battalions. The 20th disbanded in February, with its strength dispersed to the other Liverpool Pals.

As the American Expeditionary Forces emboldened the Allies, Germany prepared for a final attempt to achieve a decisive victory before the US contingent on the Western Front surged further. On 21 March, a five-hour artillery and gas shell barrage across a front signified the beginning of the Battle of St. Quentin (Operation Michael) and the German spring offensive in the Somme. Although roled as pioneers, the 11th King&#x27;s occupied frontline trenches near Urvillers when the attack began. Two of its companies engaged troops at Lambay Wood and Benay and the battalion&#x27;s casualties for the day exceeded 160. The Liverpool Pals, in reserve on the 21st, hurried to the front on the 22nd to undertake localised counter-attacks, with the first and largest conducted by the 19th against the village of Roupy. The battalion advanced in darkness after 0115, uncertain of German positions, but retook the original frontline trenches unopposed. They later came under sustained attack, holding out without support until Lieutenant-Colonel Peck ordered a withdrawal at about 1600. The Germans overwhelmed the survivors, capturing the wounded Peck and many others.

The situation became dire, forcing troops to withdraw towards Ham, which itself had to be evacuated. The Third and Fifth Armies went into retreat. The 1st King&#x27;s, occupying positions near Vélu Wood during the Battle of Bapaume, came under attack on the 24th but held out until their deteriorating flanks compelled a retreat that was covered by about 30 men from its headquarters. The battalion commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Murray-Lyon, had just 60 men at his command when they arrived at Beaulencourt later in the day. On 28 March, the offensive was extended to Arras, which was soon repulsed by the Allies. Having lost its momentum and suffered about 250,000 casualties, comparable to Allied losses, Germany abandoned the operation on 5 April. The German Army did not relent and launched Operation Georgette in Flanders on 9 April. The first-day of the Battle of the Lys involved the three King&#x27;s battalions of the 165th Brigade, situated at Estaires. The bombardment against Allied positions began at 0410 and the subsequent infantry attack displaced Portuguese forces by 0800, exposing the left flank of the 165th. The King&#x27;s repulsed the frontal assaults with heavy casualties but continued to be attacked from the flanks. Counter-attacks by the 1/7th King&#x27;s and 2/5th Lancashire Fusiliers took up to 500 prisoners.

German forces made significant gains, capturing Armentières. On 11 April, British Commander-in-Chief, General Haig, issued his &quot;backs to the walls&quot; order of the day. Five days later, Private Counter, 1st King&#x27;s, volunteered as a messenger, having witnessed five preceding runners killed. He was awarded the regiment&#x27;s last Victoria Cross. The 4th King&#x27;s experienced heavy fighting near Méteren and by 19 April had at least 489 casualties. Despite relentless battles, the Allies stabilised their front and Georgette was discontinued on 29 April after the Battle of the Scherpenberg. The Liverpool Pals fought in that climax, with the 17th having to withdraw with the loss of &quot;A&quot; Company, while the 18th and 19th repelled their attackers.

The German Army halted its offensives in July. The King&#x27;s 11th Battalion disbanded in April, followed in May by the temporary consolidation of the Liverpool Pals as the 17th (Composite) Battalion. Their brief unity ended in May when they reduced to form training cadres for the U.S. 137th Regiment. In August, after four months of being on the defensive, the Allies launched an offensive against Amiens, in the Somme area. Meticulous preparation gave them the element of surprise when it began on the 8th. More than 16,000 prisoners were taken within two hours and the German frontline mostly collapsed. In the following Battle of Albert, begun on the 21st, the 13th King&#x27;s suffered 274 casualties, but captured 150 soldiers and many machine-guns, while the 1st assisted in the taking of Ervillers.
The war&#x27;s end in Europe came with the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918. The 9th Battalion&#x27;s history illustrated the initial reaction of soldiers:

On 11 December 1918, the remnants of the 1st King&#x27;s marched across the German frontier &quot;at ease&quot;, bayonets fixed and their colours uncased. The battalion would be based at Düren and Berg Neukirchen for about five months as part of the British Army of the Rhine, joined by other battalions such as the 13th. Some, including the 25th (Reserve), served in Egypt and Belgium before the majority disbanded by late 1919.

==Inter-war (1918–1939)==
Hostilities did not end for the 17th King&#x27;s on 11 November; the battalion had sailed for Murmansk, Russia, in October as part of an Allied intervention force assembled to support the &quot;White&quot; forces in their civil war against the Bolsheviks. The battalion was moved to Archangel, where it was based intact for a short period. The battalion&#x27;s companies served separately for the duration of their stay in Russia, until the 17th left in September 1919.

The Territorial Force was disbanded and later reformed as the Territorial Army and the regiment&#x27;s battalions were also reformed. However, inter-war reductions and reorganisations reduced the regiment&#x27;s territorial battalions from six to just one by 1937. The 8th disbanded in the early 1920s, the 9th was absorbed by the Royal Engineers, and a restructuring of the Territorial Army&#x27;s infantry in the mid-1930s converted the 6th, 7th, and 10th to new roles. The 6th were transferred to the Royal Engineers and became 38th (King&#x27;s) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Engineers. The 7th joined the Royal Tank Regiment and became the 40th (The King&#x27;s) Royal Tank Regiment, and the 10th became a battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders.

===1st King&#x27;s===
As Britain&#x27;s control of Ireland eroded in 1920 during the Irish War of Independence, the 1st Battalion deployed to Bantry, County Cork. The county was a ferment of Republican activity where British forces frequently subjected the movement&#x27;s supporters to oppressive measures in an attempt to curtail escalating violence. Compared to other regiments operating in the county, such as the Essex Regiment, the King&#x27;s acquired a favourable reputation among its adversaries for their professionalism and humane treatment of prisoners—which reputedly saved the lives of some Kingsmen. Their conduct was described by Tom Barry, a prominent IRA leader, as &quot;exemplary in all the circumstances&quot;. After the establishment of the Irish Free State in the south, the battalion moved to Northern Ireland to be stationed in Derry and Omagh.

After a brief deployment to Turkey as part of the army of occupation, the battalion returned to England in 1924 and resumed overseas service in 1926 with postings to Malta, Sudan, and Egypt. While much of the battalion&#x27;s time in Egypt was peaceful and comfortable, they occasionally dealt with rioting, and on one occasion a company had to be deployed to Jerusalem. In an uprising during October 1931, Greek Cypriots in Cyprus demanded union with Greece. The battalion reinforced the British garrison with two companies; C Company arrived via eight Vickers Victoria air transports, followed by the sea-transported &quot;D&quot;. India was the 1st King&#x27;s next posting, initially in Jubbulpore. The battalion relocated to Landi Kotal, Khyber Pass, in 1937. Service in the volatile North-West Frontier Province continued into the Second World War.

===2nd King&#x27;s===

The 2nd Battalion continued to serve in India following the Armistice and mobilised during the Third Afghan War in 1919. Leading a &quot;Special Column&quot;, the battalion reached the Toba Plateau, some high, but the war was concluded before the battalion could engage Afghan forces.

Those personnel who remained after the majority demobilised in 1920 joined the Sudan garrison, where the battalion reformed. Postings to Hong Kong and Canton followed in 1922, then to India in 1924, and finally Iraq the next year. Stationed near Baghdad, its residence lasted for two years, uneventful but with the distinction of being the last British battalion to serve there until the Second World War.

Immediately after returning to England, the 2nd King&#x27;s became the first battalion of the regiment to undertake public duties at Buckingham Palace. The battalion was based in various parts of the country for nearly a decade until 1938, when it became part of the Gibraltar garrison.

==Second World War==
For the regiment, expansion was on a more modest scale than that of the Great War. Ten battalions (see List of battalions of the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool)) were formed between 1939 and 1940, including the reconstituted 8th (Liverpool Irish) Battalion. Two of the battalions converted to armour and anti-air roles in 1941: the 11th became the 152nd Regiment in the Royal Armoured Corps, but continued to wear their King&#x27;s Regiment cap badge on the black beret of the RAC, as did all infantry units converted in this way, while the 12th transferred to the Royal Artillery as 101st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment.

By late 1941, the regiment had three battalions (1st, 2nd, and 13th) stationed abroad with the remainder poised to defend the United Kingdom against a possible German invasion. The 1st and 13th battalions serve in Burma as Chindits, the 2nd in Italy and Greece during the Greek Civil War, and the 5th and 8th in Western Front of World War II. The 9th Battalion, formed as a duplicate of the 5th in 1939, served with the 164th Brigade, 55th Division, transferring to 165th Brigade in April 1943. Of the battalions that had switched to other roles, only the 40th RTR (7th King&#x27;s) experienced active service. With the 23rd Armoured Brigade, the 40th RTR fought in the North African campaign, where they acquired the nickname &quot;Monty&#x27;s Foxhounds&quot;, Italy, and Greece.

===Italy and Greece===
Having spent five years in Gibraltar with the 1st Gibraltar Brigade, the 2nd Battalion King&#x27;s departed in December 1943 with the 28th Infantry Brigade (previously 1st Gibraltar Brigade) to reinforce the 4th Infantry Division in Egypt. The battalion landed in Italy with the 4th when the division joined the campaign in March 1944. On 11 May, the division conducted an opposed crossing of the Gari River during the final Fourth Battle of Monte Cassino. The 2nd King&#x27;s constituted, along with the 2nd Somersets, the main element of 28th Infantry Brigade&#x27;s initial assault. Behind schedule by 35 minutes and thus lacking artillery support, the battalion attempted to traverse the Gari under sustained mortar and artillery fire. Many boats capsized because of the strong current with resultant losses. The 4th Division collectively struggled to consolidate its bridgehead and minefields and a determined German defence inflicted casualties on the 2nd King&#x27;s and mortally wounded their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Garmons-Williams. Depleted and disorganised, the remnants withdrew from an untenable bridgehead on the 14th. The 2nd King&#x27;s by then had 72 men killed or missing and many wounded. After five months and four battles, Monte Cassino was captured on 18 May by the Polish II Corps and the Gustav Line broken.

The Allies captured Rome in June and the 2nd King&#x27;s fought in the subsequent advance to the Trasimene Line. The King&#x27;s captured Gioiella in a fierce battle that had involved the 2/4th Hampshires (part of 28th Brigade), and later secured and defended Tuori against counter-attack, earning the regiment a unique battle honour in the British Army. In about nine months of service, in difficult, mountainous terrain, with heavy casualties, the battalion was awarded four DSOs, nine MCs, three DCMs, four MMs, and six mentioned in despatches. Among the recipients were Sergeant Welsby, who single-handedly secured a fortified farmhouse, and Major J. A. de V. Reynolds, for his leadership and conduct around Casa Arlotti.

In December, the 4th Infantry Division was deployed to Greece to reinforce British forces embroiled in the country&#x27;s civil war. Conflict in Greece between government forces and Communist partisans followed the vacuum created by the German withdrawal. The partisans (ELAS) sought to establish themselves as the new political authority and confronted the British-supported government-in-exile when ordered to disband and disarm. Within 24 hours of being flown to Piraeus on 12 December, the 2nd King&#x27;s had to engage partisans in a brief action, seizing occupied barracks at a cost of 14 casualties. During a seven-week internal security employment, there were many instances of house-to-house and street fighting in Athens. By mid-January 1945, the city had been cleared of insurgents and a ceasefire agreed upon, followed by the Varkiza Agreement in February. The King&#x27;s remained for a year to support a tense peace until they left for Cyprus.

===Burma===
The 13th Battalion, King&#x27;s Regiment, was raised in October 1940 for coastal defence in England and assigned to the 208th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). The battalion sailed for India in December 1941, coinciding with Japan&#x27;s entrance into the war. Intended for internal security and garrison duties, the 13th&#x27;s strength contained many men categorised as old or of a medically downgraded condition with the result that few men were well trained. After Japan occupied Burma in 1942, the Allies formed a unit intended to penetrate deep behind Japanese lines from India. The 13th King&#x27;s provided the majority of the British contingent for the &quot;Chindits&quot;, which was formally designated as the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade and commanded by Brigadier Orde Wingate.

Organised into two groups, the Chindits&#x27; first operation (codenamed Longcloth) began on 8 February 1943. No. 2 Group, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel S.A. Cooke, was formed from the 13th King&#x27;s and divided into five independent columns, two of which (Nos 7 and 8) were commanded by majors from the battalion. No Japanese opposition was encountered initially, allowing the Chindits to cross the Chindwin River and advance into Burma unimpeded.

The 1st Battalion also took part in a similar operation in 1944 and formed 81 and 82 Columns. As in the first expedition in 1943 the Chindits again suffered heavy casualties and fought behind the Japanese lines at Kohima and Imphal. After Orde Wingate was killed in a crash in March 1944, it was decided to break up the remaining Chindit formations and some of them were to be converted into airborne infantry battalions. The 1st King&#x27;s was converted to become the 15th (King&#x27;s) Parachute Battalion of the Parachute Regiment and joined the 77th Indian Parachute Brigade attached to the 44th Indian Airborne Division where it remained for the rest of the war.

===Normandy and Germany===
In 1943, the 5th and 8th King&#x27;s (Liverpool Irish) received specialist training at Ayrshire in preparation for a planned invasion of France. They had been selected to form the nucleus of the 5th and 7th Beach Groups, which would have the objectives of maintaining beach organisation, securing positions, and providing defence against counter-attack.

As invasion neared in mid-1944, the two battalions moved from their camps to ports in southern England and embarked aboard troopships and landing ship tanks. Much of the Liverpool Irish embarked aboard the &quot;Ulster Monarch&quot;, a passenger ship that had served on the Belfast-Liverpool line before the war. Having been delayed, the invasion fleet proceeded to Normandy on 5 June. Both King&#x27;s battalions landed on D-Day, the 5th at Sword with the 3rd British Infantry Division and the Liverpool Irish at Juno with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division.

Two companies of the Liverpool Irish landed in the assault wave with the Royal Winnipeg Rifles. Under intense machine gun and mortar fire, the landing of Major Max Morrison&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; Company proceeded well, allowing some to establish a command-post upon reaching the sand dunes. In contrast, in &quot;B&quot; Company&#x27;s sector, the late arrival of the reconnaissance party and DD tanks exposed the landing infantry to heavy machine gun fire. The company&#x27;s officer commanding, Major O&#x27;Brien, and the second-in-command were among those wounded. At Sword, as the 3rd Division moved inland, the 5th King&#x27;s attempted to neutralise hostile positions and snipers. Casualties included Lieutenant-Colonel D. H. V. Board, killed by a sniper, and the OC of 9 Platoon, Lieutenant Scarfe, mortally wounded in an attack on a German position that captured 16 soldiers.

Under fire, the beach groups collected the wounded and dead, located and marked minefields, attempted to maintain organisation, and directed vehicles and troops inland. The two battalions operated with the beach groups for a further six weeks. While the depleted Liverpool Irish disbanded in August, much of its strength having been transferred to other units as reinforcements, the 5th King&#x27;s survived as a reduced cadre. Disbandment had only been avoided through the determination of Lieutenant Colonel G.D. Wreford-Brown, who argued that the 5th Battalion was nearly the most senior unit active in the Territorial Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;5 King&#x27;s/No 2 T Force&quot;&gt;5 King&#x27;s/No 2 T Force (Archive), army.mod.uk. Retrieved 13 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Allies advanced into Nazi Germany in February 1945, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) began to form dedicated units to secure important objectives—equipment, installations, intelligence, and personnel. The 5th King&#x27;s provided the nucleus for No. 2 T (Target) Force. Elements of the 5th reached the naval port of Kiel in May 1945, securing the cruiser &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; and taking 7,000 sailors prisoner. The battalion continued to conduct intelligence operations until disbandment in July 1946 during the demobilisation process. Reconstitution into the Territorial Army followed in 1947 under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Stanley.

==Post-Second World War (1945–1958)==

The 1st King&#x27;s, still roled as 15th (King&#x27;s) Parachute Battalion, remained in India with responsibility for the area around Meerut, north-east of New Delhi. After reconverting to standard infantry, the battalion departed for Liverpool in late 1947. In April 1948, the 2nd King&#x27;s deployed to the British Mandate of Palestine for two weeks. The battalion carried out internal security duties in the prelude to Israel&#x27;s establishment for two weeks before its return to Cyprus. When the army reduced its strength, the 2nd King&#x27;s chose to be absorbed by the 1st rather than have its lineage terminated. On 6 September 1948, the two battalions amalgamated in a ceremonial parade attended by honorary Colonel of the Regiment, Major-General Dudley Ward. The battalion was posted to West Germany shortly afterwards and moved to West Berlin in February 1951.

===Korean War===
The battalion was ordered to Korea in June 1952. By then, the Korean War had entered a period of stalemate, with trench warfare prevailing. At Liverpool, the King&#x27;s embarked aboard the troopship &quot;Devonshire&quot; for Hong Kong, where it underwent training before landing at Pusan, Korea, in September. Replacing the 1st Royal Norfolk Regiment in the 29th Infantry Brigade, 1st Commonwealth Division, the 1st King&#x27;s took up defensive positions on moving to the frontline, about from Seoul.

While much of the battalion&#x27;s time at the front proved uneventful, its night patrols often clashed with Chinese troops. In 1953, the battalion withdrew to reserve for three months. A tactically important feature known as &quot;The Hook&quot;, a crescent shaped ridge, was the scene of intense fighting between Commonwealth forces and the Chinese in May. On the night of 20 May, Chinese forces commenced a sustained bombardment of the Hook, defended by the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment. Two days later, a company from the King&#x27;s conducted a nighttime diversionary raid on Chinese positions known as &quot;Pheasant&quot;. During the raid, Second-Lieutenant Caws&#x27; 5 Platoon, intended to execute the actual attack, inadvertently stumbled upon an uncharted minefield, suffering 10 wounded from a strength of 16. The attack had to be abandoned, forcing the company to withdraw with its wounded back to British lines under the protection of artillery.
The King&#x27;s moved to the right sector of the Hook on 27 May, excepting &quot;D&quot; Company&#x27;s 10 Platoon and &quot;B&quot; Company (as reserve), which became attached to the Dukes. At 1953 hours, on 28 May, the battle began when a heavy artillery barrage targeted the Dukes&#x27; positions. Within minutes, the first of four successive Chinese waves attacked. Two King&#x27;s platoons had to be moved forward to reinforce the Point 121 position, which soon after came under attack by two infantry companies. After the attack was repulsed with the assistance of Commonwealth artillery, the Chinese directed their attention to the King&#x27;s on Point 146. As their troops assembled at Pheasant at around 2305, 1st King&#x27;s Lieutenant-Colonel A.J. Snodgrass called in artillery, Centurion tank, and machine-gun fire that effectively destroyed the battalion-sized formation. Fighting continued until the British cleared the remaining troops from the Hook at approximately 0330. British casualties numbered 149, including 28 killed, while Chinese losses were estimated to be 250 killed and 800 wounded.

The 1st King&#x27;s left Korea for Hong Kong in October, by which time the battalion had suffered 28 dead and 200 wounded. Of some 1,500 men that served with the King&#x27;s in Korea, 350 were regular soldiers, the rest being conscripts on national service. The King&#x27;s moved to Britain in 1955, were posted to West Germany the following year, and made its final return home in May 1958.

===Amalgamation===

The 1957 Defence White Paper (known as the &quot;Sandys Review&quot; after Secretary of State for War Duncan Sandys) announced the government&#x27;s intention to reduce the army&#x27;s overseas responsibilities and abolish national service. Regiments and other units were rationalised through amalgamation or disbandment. The decision to merge the King&#x27;s and Manchesters dismayed many serving and retired personnel. The regiments did, however, share an historical connection through the 63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot, constituted as the 8th Foot&#x27;s second battalion in 1756 and redesignated the 1st Battalion, Manchester Regiment in 1881.

In June, at Brentwood, the colours of the two regiments were paraded for the last time in the presence of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother. The King&#x27;s Regiment (Manchester and Liverpool) formally came into being on 1 September 1958. On 1 July 2006, the successor regiment amalgamated, joining with two others to form the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment.

The surviving territorial battalion of the King&#x27;s (Liverpool), the 5th, retained its identity until reduced to &quot;B&quot; Company, Lancastrian Volunteers in 1967. The lineage of 5th King&#x27;s later became perpetuated by &quot;A&quot; Company on its formation in 1992. The company became an integral component of the 4th Battalion, Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment in 2006 and contained the Liverpool Scottish Platoon.

<text>The Manchester Regiment was a line infantry regiment of the British Army in existence from 1881 until 1958. The regiment was created during the 1881 Childers Reforms by the amalgamation of the 63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot and the 96th Regiment of Foot as the 1st and 2nd battalions; the 6th Royal Lancashire Militia became the 3rd (Reserve) and 4th (Extra Reserve) battalions and the Volunteer battalions became the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th battalions.

After distinguished service in both the First and the Second World Wars, the Manchester Regiment was amalgamated with the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool) in 1958, to form the King&#x27;s Regiment (Manchester and Liverpool), which was, in 2006, amalgamated with the King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment and the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment to form the present Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment (King&#x27;s, Lancashire and Border).

==1881–1899==
Between the 1860s and 1880s, the British Army underwent a period of reform implemented by Edward Cardwell and Hugh Childers. Single-battalion regiments were amalgamated and regiments were affiliated with a geographical area. The Manchester Regiment came into being on 1 July 1881 by the union of the 63rd (West Suffolk) and 96th Regiments of Foot. They had been linked in 1873 by their allocation to the 16th Sub-district Brigade Depot in Ashton-under-Lyne, near to Manchester. The 2nd Battalion, as the 96th Foot, had been raised in the town of Manchester in 1824. Eight additional battalions were gained through the incorporation of the 6th Royal Lancashire Militia and rifle corps units from Lancashire. By July, the regiment had the following under its command:

* Regimental Headquarters
* 63rd Regimental District (Regimental Depot) based in Ashton (later named Ladysmith Barracks)
* 1st Battalion (Regular)
* 2nd Battalion (Regular)
* 3rd (1st Battalion, 6th Royal Lancashire Militia) Battalion (Militia)
* 4th (2nd Battalion, 6th Royal Lancashire Militia) Battalion (Militia)
* 1st Volunteer Battalion — former 4th Lancashire Rifle Volunteers
* 2nd Volunteer Battalion — former 6th Lancashire (1st Manchester) Rifle Volunteers
* 3rd Volunteer Battalion — former 40th Lancashire (3rd Manchester) Rifle Volunteers
* 4th Volunteer Battalion — former 20th Lancashire (2nd Manchester) Rifle Volunteers
* 5th (Ardwick) Volunteer Battalion — former 23rd Lancashire Rifle Volunteers
* 6th Volunteer Battalion — former 7th Lancashire Rifle Volunteers

The 1st Battalion was deployed to Egypt to take part in the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882 and was then deployed to Gibraltar in 1897. The 2nd Battalion was based in India from 1882 to 1897 and saw action on the North-West Frontier before departing for Aden.

==1899–1914==
===Second Boer War===

Amidst growing tension between Boers and the British in the Transvaal, the 1st Manchester shipped to South Africa in September 1899. The battalion arrived in Durban, Natal Colony in early October, and was soon afterwards moved to Ladysmith. The war began on 11 October with a Boer invasion of the colony. After Boer forces captured Elandslaagte railway station, the Manchesters had four companies sent by armoured train to Modderspruit. While disembarking there, the Manchesters and accompanying Imperial Light Horse came under ineffectual artillery fire.

The 1st Manchesters, along with the Gordon Highlanders and the Imperial Light Horse, took part in the subsequent assault. The fighting was heavy, with the Boers pouring accurate fire into the advancing British troops. Under increasingly heavy fire, the battalion halted its advance. The Manchester became the main vanguard of the frontal assault, having originally been tasked with a left-flank attack on the Boer hills. Once the battalion closed in, the Boers withdrew to their main line of defence.

On 2 November, Boer forces encircled and isolated the town of Ladysmith, beginning a 118-day siege. On 6 January 1900, a contingent of 16 soldiers of the 1st Manchesters came under attack at Wagon Hill, near to Caeser&#x27;s Camp. Against superior numbers, the detachment held its position for 15 hours. Only two survived, Privates Pitts and Scott, who had continued to hold out for many hours when the others had been killed. Both received the Victoria Cross for their actions, giving the regiment its first two VCs. By 28 February, Ladysmith had finally been relieved by a force under the command of General Redvers Buller.
The 2nd Manchesters was mobilized into a new 8th Division going to South Africa for the war. 930 officers and men of the regiment left Southampton in the &quot;SS Bavarian&quot; in March 1900, and in April arrived in Natal as reinforcements. Both battalions participated in the offensive that followed the relieving of Ladysmith, Kimberley and Mafeking. After the fall of Bloemfontein and Pretoria, the Boer commandos transitioned to guerrilla warfare. The 2nd Manchesters operated in the Orange Free State, searching farms and burning those suspected of housing commandos. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging in May 1902. The 2nd battalion stayed in South Africa throughout the war. Four months later 340 officers and men of the battalion left Cape Town on the SS &quot;Michigan&quot; in late September 1902, arriving at Southampton in late October, when they were posted to Aldershot.

When the Boers proved more resilient than predicted, a number of regiments recruited in large centres of population formed additional regular battalions. The Manchester Regiment formed the 3rd and 4th Battalions in February 1900, at which time the militia battalions were relabelled as the 5th and 6th battalions. The 3rd Battalion was stationed in Saint Helena and South Africa from August 1902, while the 4th Battalion was stationed in Cork. In 1906, the 3rd and 4th battalions both returned to the United Kingdom, where they were disbanded.

The 5th (Militia) Battalion (until February 1900 known as the 3rd battalion) was embodied in May 1900, disembodied in October that year, and re-embodied in May 1901 for service in South Africa, for which it embarked the following month. More than 800 officers and men returned to Southampton in July 1902, following the end of the war.

The 6th (Militia) Battalion (until February 1900 known as the 4th battalion) was embodied in May 1900, disembodied in October that year, and later re-embodied for service in South Africa. More than 640 officers and men returned to Southampton by the SS &quot;Guelph&quot; in October 1902, following the end of the war, and was disbanded at the Ashton barracks.

The 1st Manchesters left South Africa for Singapore in 1903. The following year, the 1st moved to India, where, in 1911, the battalion paraded at the Delhi Durbar, attended by King George V and Queen Mary. The 2nd Manchesters had returned to Britain in 1902, where it remained until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.

===Haldane reforms===
In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve. The regiment now had two Reserve and six Territorial battalions:
* 3rd (Reserve) Battalion (SR) at Ladysmith Barracks
* 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion (SR) at Ladysmith Barracks
* 5th Battalion (TF) at Bank Street in Wigan (since demolished)
* 6th Battalion (TF) at Stretford Road in Hulme (since demolished)
* 7th Battalion (TF) at Burlington Street in Manchester
* 8th (Ardwick) Battalion (TF) at Ardwick Green in Manchester
* 9th Battalion (TF) at Old Street in Ashton-under-Lyne
* 10th Battalion (TF) at Rifle Street in Oldham

==First World War==

===Mobilisation===
On the outbreak of war in August 1914 the 1st Battalion was part of the 8th (Jullundur) Brigade of the 3rd (Lahore) Indian Division, while the 2nd Battalion was part of 14th Brigade in 5th Division, stationed in Ireland.

In August 1914 the two Special Reserve battalions went to their war station in the Humber Garrison where they carried out the dual tasks of garrison duties and preparing reinforcement drafts of regular reservists, special reservists, recruits and returning wounded for the two regular battalions. 

The Territorial battalions mobilised in August 1914 as part of the East Lancashire Division. Shortly afterwards the Territorial Force was invited to volunteer for overseas service and the bulk of the East Lancashire Division did so. The division was sent to Egypt to relieve the Regular garrison for service on the Western Front and was subsequently designated the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. Those men who were ineligible for overseas service, together with the volunteers who were flooding in, were formed into second line units distinguished with a &#x27;2/&#x27; prefix (2/5th Manchesters &quot;etc&quot;) . The 2nd Line battalions of the Manchesters joined the 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division.

Meanwhile on 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain&#x27;s declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular Army, and the newly-appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum issued his famous call to arms: &#x27;Your King and Country Need You&#x27;, urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener&#x27;s First New Army, or &#x27;K1&#x27;. Volunteers poured into the recruiting offices across the country and were formed into &#x27;Service&#x27; battalions of the county regiments. So many came forward that the &#x27;K1&#x27; battalions were quickly filled and the recruitment of the &#x27;K2&#x27; , &#x27;K3&#x27; and &#x27;K4&#x27; units quickly followed. The Manchesters formed the 11th (Service) Bn (K1), 12th (Service) Bn (K2), 13th (Service) Bn (K3) and 14th (Reserve) Bn (K4).

The flood of volunteers overwhelmed the ability of the army to absorb and organise them, and by the time the Fifth New Army (K5) was authorised, many of its constituent units were being organised as &quot;Pals battalions&quot; under the auspices of mayors and corporations of towns up and down the country. The Lord Mayor and City of Manchester raised eight battalions of Manchester Pals, which became the 16th–23rd (Service) Bns of the Manchester Regiment, subtitled &#x27;1st City&#x27;, &#x27;2nd City&#x27;, &quot;etc&quot;. Meanwhile the Mayor and Town of Oldham raised the 24th (Service) Bn (Oldham Pioneers). Later the 25th–27th (Reserve) Bns were formed from the depot companies of the Pals battalions.

===Western Front===

The 1st Battalion moved to France, landing at Marseille in September 1914. Having been briefly attached to French cavalry, the 1st Battalion moved to the frontline on 26 October, relieving a battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment near Festubert. Three days later, a heavy bombardment preceded an attack by a German force directed against the 2nd Battalion, Manchesters and the 1st Battalion, Devonshire Regiment. Despite capturing a trench line, the Germans were unable to capitalise due to the actions of a platoon commanded by Second-Lieutenant James Leach. In the process of their methodical retaking of the trench, the party killed eight, wounded two and captured 14 soldiers. For their contribution to the defence of the Manchesters&#x27; trenches, Second-Lieutenant Leach and Sergeant John Hogan were awarded the Victoria Cross. Severe casualties were sustained by the 1st Manchesters and its brigade during the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. A succession of intensely fought battles followed, culminating in the Second Battle of Ypres and Battle of Loos.

The 2nd Manchesters embarked for France with the 5th Division in August 1914 and contributed to the rearguard actions that supported the British Expeditionary Force&#x27;s (BEF) retreat following the Battle of Mons. The battalion was engaged in the battles of the Marne, the Aisne and &quot;First Ypres&quot;.

On 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme, the regiment had nine battalions committed, including the Manchester Pals, the 16th (1st City), 17th (2nd City), 18th (3rd City) and 19th (4th City), all serving in the 90th Brigade of the 30th Division. The day proved to be the deadliest in the British Army&#x27;s history, with more than 57,000 killed, wounded or missing.

The regiment continued its involvement in the Somme Offensive. In late July, the 16th, 17th and 18th Manchesters attacked an area in the vicinity of the small village of Guillemont. During the action, Company Sergeant-Major George Evans, of the 18th, volunteered to deliver an important message, having witnessed five previous, fatal attempts to do so. He delivered his message, running more than half a mile despite being wounded. He was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 2 April 1917, the 2nd Manchesters attacked Francilly-Selency, in which C Company captured a battery of 77 mm guns and a number of machine-guns. Two paintings were made of this action by the military artist Richard Caton Woodville. Later in the month, the Manchester Regiment fought in the Arras Offensive.

Preparations for a new offensive, the Third Battle of Ypres, in the Ypres sector had got under-way in June with a preliminary assault on Messines. The Manchester Pals&#x27; Brigade fought in the offensive&#x27;s opening battle, at Pilckem Ridge, on 31 July. Conditions during &quot;Third Ypres&quot; (or Passchendaele) reduced the battleground to an intractable morass. During &quot;Third Ypres&quot;, Sergeant Coverdale, of the 11th (Service) Battalion, killed three snipers, rushed two machine gun positions, then reorganised his platoon to capture another position, though after advancing some distance was forced back due to bombardment from the British artillery, suffering nine casualties in the advance.

After serving on the Western Front from July 1915 with 17th (Northern) Division, including the Ypres Salient and the battles of the Somme and Arras, 12th (Service) Battalion amalgamated with Regimental HQ and two squadrons of the Manchester-based Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Own Yeomanry (DLOY), who had been dismounted and retrained as infantry. From 24 September 1917 the battalion was redesignated 12th (DLOY) Battalion, Manchester Regiment. It continued serving with 17th (N) Division until the Armistice, including the Battle of Passchendaele, the German Spring Offensive and the Allied Hundred Days Offensive.

In March 1918, the German Army launched an all-out offensive in the Somme sector. Faced with the prospect of continued American reinforcement (who had entered the war in April 1917) of the Allied armies, the Germans urgently sought a decisive victory on the Western Front. On the morning of 21 March, the 16th Manchesters occupied positions in an area known as Manchester Hill, near to St. Quentin. A large German force attacked along the 16th&#x27;s front, being repulsed in parts, but completely overwhelming the battalion elsewhere. Some positions lost were recaptured in counter-attacks by the 16th. Though encircled, the 16th continued to resist the assault, encouraged by its commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Wilfrith Elstob. During the course of the battle, Elstob single-handedly repulsed a grenadier attack and made a number of journeys to replenish dwindling ammunition supplies. At one point, he sent a message to 42nd Brigade HQ that &quot;The Manchester Regiment will defend Manchester Hill to the last&quot;, to his men he had told them &quot;Here we fight, and here we die&quot;. The 16th Manchesters effectively ceased to exist as a coherent body. Lieutenant-Colonel Elstob was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. An attempt to retake the hill was later made by the 17th Manchesters, now part of 21st Brigade, with heavy losses. Two more Victoria Crosses were awarded to the regiment in the final months of the war. Also involved in the Spring Offensive were the 2/5th, 2/6th and 2/7th battalions, serving as part of 199th (2/1st Manchester) Brigade, part of 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division, all battalions of the Territorial Force.

The later-prominent war poet, Wilfred Owen served with the 2nd Battalion, Manchesters in the later stages of the war. On 1 October 1918, Owen led units of it to storm a number of enemy strong points near the village of Joncourt. For his courage and leadership in the Joncourt action, he was awarded the Military Cross, an award he had always sought in order to justify himself. On 4 November 1918, Wilfred Owen was killed in action during the crossing of the Sambre–Oise Canal, exactly one week (almost to the hour) before the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant the day after his death.

===Middle East===
In September 1914, just before the Ottoman Empire entered the war on Germany&#x27;s side, six of the regiment&#x27;s battalions joined the Egypt garrison. They belonged to the East Lancashire Division of the Territorial Force, which was selected to release Regular Army troops for service in active theatres. Serving in the division were the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th battalions, with the latter two as part of the East Lancashire Brigade (which also included two battalions, the 4th and 5th, of the East Lancashire Regiment) and the other four the Manchester Brigade. In May 1915, the division was numbered as the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division and the brigades were numbered, the Manchester Brigade becoming 127th (1/1st Manchester) Brigade and the East Lancashire Brigade the 126th (1/1st East Lancashire) Brigade. In the same month, the division landed at Cape Helles, Gallipoli to reinforce the British beachheads established during the initial landings in April.

The Manchesters disembarked at &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot;, where, in the April landings, there had been at least 2,000 casualties. The Manchester battalions took part in the Third Battle of Krithia on 4 June 1915. The 127th Brigade reached their first objective and advanced a further 1,000 yards, capturing 217 Ottomans in the process.

During the Battle of Krithia Vineyard, the Manchesters suffered heavy losses and gained a Victoria Cross for gallantry by Lieutenant Forshaw of the 1/9th Battalion. The evacuation of Cape Helles lasted from December 1915 to January 1916. The Manchester battalions suffered many casualties during the Dardnalles Campaign. At the Helles Memorial, 1,215 names of the Manchesters alone fill the memorial.

The 1st Manchesters embarked for the Mesopotamian campaign, accompanying the infantry element of the Indian Corps, from France in late 1915. The battalion took part in the Battle of Dujaila in March 1916, which was intended to relieve the British forces in Kut-al-Amara, which was being besieged by Ottoman forces. In the battle, the 1st Manchesters seized the trenches of the Dujaila Redoubt with the 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force); however, they were subsequently displaced by an Ottoman counter-attack, being forced back to their starting lines. During the withdrawal, Private Stringer held his ground single-handedly, securing the flank of his battalion. He was awarded the Victoria Cross. British and Indian forces suffered 4,000 casualties. After five failed attempts to relieve the town, Kut surrendered to Ottoman forces on 29 April 1916. The 1st Manchesters would take part in further actions in Mesopotamia, but in March 1918 the battalion moved to Egypt.

The battalion then moved to Ottoman-controlled Palestine, still part of the 3rd (Lahore) Division, to take part in the campaign there against the Ottomans. They fought in the last major offensive there, at Megiddo, on 19 September. Within three hours the Turkish lines, held by the Turkish Eighth Army, had been broken. Open warfare defined the theatre. During the Megiddo offensive, the cavalry advanced more than 70 miles in 36 hours. The 1st Manchesters took part in further engagements until the Armistice with the Ottoman Empire, remaining in the area until 1919.

===Home Front===
During a raid by German Zeppelin L 21 on the night of 31 March - 1 April 1916, 31 soldiers of the 3rd Manchesters were killed when a bomb hit their billet at Cleethorpes.

As the war continued the Manchesters organised a number of other battalions for service away from the front lines. In 1915 the Home Service men of the TF battalions of the Manchesters and the Lancashire Fusiliers, were combined into 45th Provisional Battalion, which became 28th Manchesters on 1 January 1917. It served at home in 73rd Division and was disbanded in 1918. A 29th Battalion was formed in June 1918, but within days was absorbed into 16th (1st City) Bn. The 1st Garrison Battalion served in India, and the 2nd (Home Service) Garrison Bn at home. In addition, three training battalions were organised in 1917 for progressive training of recruits: 51st (Graduated), 52nd (Graduated) and 53rd (Young Soldier) Bns. One of the last surviving First World War veterans, Netherwood Hughes, served in the 51st Battalion. Ned Hughes died 4 April 2009 aged 108.

==Interwar years==
In 1919, during the interwar period, the 1st Manchesters returned to Britain for a year, later reinforcing the garrison in Ireland. In 1922, it garrisoned the Channel Islands before joining the British Army of the Rhine in Germany. It returned to Britain in 1927 and, in 1933, departed for the West Indies. After being posted to Egypt in 1936, the 1st Manchesters was converted into a Vickers machine-gun battalion. The battalion had to be rushed to the Mandate of Palestine when the Arab populace erupted in revolt. In difficult conditions, the battalion suffered four killed and contributed a number of men to the counter-insurgency Special Night Squads. In 1937, a company on detachment in Cyprus provided a special guard for the Coronation parade. In 1938, the battalion moved to Singapore.

Meanwhile, in 1920, the 2nd Manchesters became part of the garrison in Mesopotamia, which had been acquired by Britain as a mandate territory under the auspices of the League of Nations. During an action near Hillah, Captain Henderson reorganised his company, who were wavering in the face of a large force of tribesmen, then led the company in three attacks against the tribesmen, being severely wounded in the second attack, though carrying on for the third and final counter-attack. He carried on fighting until he succumbed to a loss of blood and collapsed. Aided by one of his men, who helped him to stand, Henderson told his company, &quot;I&#x27;m done now, don&#x27;t let them beat you.&quot; He was shot again, which killed him. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions. The battalion departed for India in 1922, where it remained until 1932. At the beginning of the Second World War, it was stationed in Britain.

The Territorial Force had been demobilised in 1919. It was reformed on 7 February 1920 and reorganised and renamed as the Territorial Army the following year. The battalions of the Manchester Regiment were reformed, the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th continuing to serve in the 127th (Manchester) Infantry Brigade, and the 9th and 10th with 126th (East Lancashire) Infantry Brigade (alongside the 4th and 5th East Lancashire Regiment), both brigades still being part of 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division. However, in 1921, the 6th and 7th battalions were amalgamated as the 6th/7th Battalion and later converted to become the 65th (The Manchester Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery.

On 31 October 1938, during the period of rearmament preceding the Second World War, the 10th (Territorial Army) Battalion was converted to armour, becoming the 41st Battalion, Royal Tank Corps, later 41st (Oldham) Royal Tank Regiment. A &#x27;second line&#x27; battalion, which was formed at Oldham in 1939, became the 47th (Oldham) Royal Tank Regiment.

==Second World War==

===North West Europe and Italy===
When the German Army invaded France in May 1940, the 2nd, 5th and 1/9th Manchesters formed part of the British Expeditionary Force - the 2nd and 1/9th were Machine Gun battalions. The 2nd Battalion, a Regular Army unit, was the MG Battalion of the 2nd Infantry Division, the 5th was serving with 4th East Lancashire Regiment and 1st Highland Light Infantry in the 127th Infantry Brigade, 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division and the 1/9th was with III Corps GHQ Troops. Despite putting up a stubborn defence, the BEF went into retreat, the Manchesters being engaged along the way. Much of the BEF converged on Dunkirk, where hundreds of ships evacuated more than 330,000 soldiers back to Britain. Of the surviving men of the 2nd Manchesters, more than 300 men were evacuated. Fewer than 200 remained, fighting until being either captured or killed. The 5th and 1/9th were also evacuated, having suffered light casualties. The evacuation ended on 3 June. Captain Jack Churchill, the only known man to kill an enemy with a longbow in the Second World War, was serving with the Manchester Regiment during this period.

In November 1941, the 5th Manchesters, along with the rest of the division (which became 42nd Armoured Division), was converted to armour as the 111th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (Manchester Regiment), serving alongside the 107th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (King&#x27;s Own) and the 110th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (Border) in the 11th Armoured Brigade. The men continued to wear their Manchester Regiment cap badge on the black beret of the RAC as did all infantry units converted in this way. However, 111 RAC was disbanded in November 1943 and 5th Manchesters reconstituted as an infantry battalion. In the summer of 1944, the battalion acted as the Royal Bodyguard at Balmoral Castle while the Royal Family was in residence and then served as a machine-gun battalion with 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division until the end of the war.

In November 1941, the 2/9th Manchesters, a 2nd Line Territorial Army duplicate of the 1/9th and a Machine Gun Battalion, was transferred to the Royal Artillery and converted into the 88th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery. (Sometime after this, the 1/9th Battalion was redesignated as the 9th Battalion.) The 88th Anti-Tank Regiment was part of the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division until July 1943 when it transferred elsewhere and, in January 1944, the regiment was transferred to 45th (Holding) Division where it converted to the 88th Training Regiment, Royal Artillery.

The 6th Battalion, created on 31 July 1939 as a duplicate of the 5th Battalion, was serving as part of the 199th Infantry Brigade, initially part of the 66th Infantry Division, alongside the 7th Manchesters and the 2/8th Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers. On 23 June 1940, the 66th Division was disbanded and the 199th Brigade was transferred to the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division. On 5 May 1942, the battalion was redesignated as the 1st Battalion, to replace the original battalion, which had been lost at Singapore in February. In October 1943, the new 1st Battalion transferred to the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division, where it was to remain for the rest of the war. On 27 June 1944, the 1st Battalion, Manchester Regiment landed in France, 21 days after the initial invasion had begun on 6 June, D-Day. With the rest of the 53rd Division, the battalion saw fierce fighting in the Battle of Normandy and took part in a number of engagements in the area around Caen, scene of much bitter fighting, which was captured by British and Canadian forces on 9 July, and later fought in the Battle of Falaise. The battalion advanced across Northern France, reaching Antwerp in Belgium in early September. The 1st Manchesters, along with the rest of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, moved to Turnhout, before advancing later that month into the Netherlands, where the 1st and 7th Manchesters saw heavy action, with the 7th, now as part of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, fighting in the Battle of the Scheldt under command of the First Canadian Army. The 1st Manchesters, after entering German territory in the face of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s defences, crossed the Rhine with the 53rd Division in late March. The 7th Manchesters with 52nd Division saw its last fighting in Bremen, when that city was captured on 26 April. The 1st Battalion ended the war in Hamburg when that city surrendered on 3 May.

The 8th (Ardwick) Battalion had been serving alongside the 5th Manchesters in the 127th Brigade of the 42nd Division until 5 May 1940, when the battalion was transferred to Malta and was replaced in the brigade by the 1st Highland Light Infantry, a Regular Army unit. In August, the battalion became part of the Northern Infantry Brigade, later redesignated 2nd Malta Infantry Brigade and, finally, 232nd Infantry Brigade. In late July 1943, the 8th Manchesters was transferred to the 20th Indian Infantry Brigade, part of the 10th Indian Infantry Division, then serving in the Middle East. Both the 8th and 9th Manchesters took part in the Italian campaign. The 9th Battalion was part of the 4th Indian Infantry Division and later, from 15 July 1944 until 31 August 1945, formed the Support Battalion of the British 46th Infantry Division. The 9th Manchesters saw much action during the Battles for the Gothic Line in August–September 1944, including the Battle of Montegridolfo. After service in Greece during the civil war and a return to Italy for the last weeks of the campaign there, it reached Graz, Austria by the end of the war.

===Far East===

Stationed in Singapore from 1938, the 1st Battalion, Manchesters, as part of the 2nd Malaya Infantry Brigade, saw action during the Japanese invasion of the island in February 1942. After a bitter defence, Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival signed the surrender of Singapore on 15 February. About 80,000 British and Commonwealth personnel became POWs of the Imperial Japanese Army. The 1st Battalion was reformed in the United Kingdom by the redesignation of the 6th Battalion.

In 1942, the 2nd Manchesters was sent to the sub-continent with the rest of the British 2nd Infantry Division, being stationed first in British India, then Burma in 1944. The battalion was involved in the Battle of Kohima in fierce fighting with the Japanese. It fought in subsequent actions in Burma until April 1945, when it returned to India.

==Postwar==
The 1st Manchesters remained in Germany as part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) until it returned to Britain in 1947, where it was joined by the 2nd Battalion. On 1 June 1948, the two battalions amalgamated in the presence of the regiment&#x27;s colonel-in-chief, Queen Elizabeth. Soon afterwards, the 1st Battalion was posted to Germany, being first based at Wuppertal. On the regiment joining the West Berlin garrison in 1950, detachments performed guard duty at Spandau Prison. The battalion proceeded, in 1951, to Malaya aboard the troopship &quot;Empire Hallande&quot;. In three years of service during the Malayan Emergency, the Manchesters had 15 men killed in action.

With the exception of a brief return to Britain, the 1st Battalion, Manchesters remained part of BAOR until 1958. In the same year, the regiment was amalgamated with the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool) to create the King&#x27;s Regiment.

==Heritage &amp; ceremonial==
===Regimental museum===
The Museum of the Manchester Regiment, which had previously been based at Ladysmith Barracks, moved to Ashton Town Hall in 1987. The museum remains closed while the town hall is being redeveloped.

===Regimental collect===

The regimental collect was:

O Lord our God whose name only is excellent and thy praise above heaven and earth we thank thee for the men of the Manchester Regiment who counted not their lives dear unto themselves but laid them down for their friends, beseeching thee to give them a part in those good things which thou has prepared for all whose names are written in the Book of Life. And grant to us that having them always in remembrance we may imitate their faithfulness and with them inherit, the new name which thou has promised to them that overcome; through Jesus Christ our 
Lord. Amen.

<text>The King&#x27;s Regiment, officially abbreviated as KINGS, was an infantry regiment of the British Army, part of the King&#x27;s Division. It was formed on 1 September 1958 by the amalgamation of the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool) which had been raised in 1685 and the Manchester Regiment which traced its history to 1758. In existence for almost 50 years, the regular battalion, 1 KINGS, served in Kenya, Kuwait, British Guiana (Guyana), West Germany, Northern Ireland, the Falkland Islands, Cyprus, and Iraq. Between 1972 and 1990, 15 Kingsmen died during military operations in Northern Ireland during a violent period in the province&#x27;s history known as &quot;The Troubles&quot;.

When formed in 1958, the King&#x27;s Regiment consisted of one infantry battalion, known within the Army as 1 KINGS, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Derek Horsford. Under a system known colloquially as the &quot;Arms plot&quot;, infantry battalions were trained and equipped for different roles for a period of between two and six years. Converted first to a mechanized battalion equipped with FV432 armoured personnel carriers in the late 1960s in West Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany), it converted back to a light battalion in UK and subsequently in Hong Kong and Northern Ireland, back to a mechanized battalion in 1980 and then again to a light battalion. Prior to and during Op Telic Iraq in 2003 the regiment was roled as an armoured infantry regiment, equipped primarily with the Warrior infantry fighting vehicle; it continued this role during the amalgamation in 2006. The regimental establishment in 2004 was 620, although its substantive strength was recorded as being 60 below that.

==History==

===1958–1980===
The King&#x27;s and Manchester Regiments, consisting of regular and Territorial Army battalions, had been selected for amalgamation by Duncan Sandys&#x27; 1957 Defence White Paper. Conscription (National Service) was to be abolished and the Armed Forces&#x27; size rationalised over a gradual period. Retired soldiers and some serving personnel despaired at the prospect of the demise of their respective regiments. The regular 1st battalions of both regiments formally amalgamated on 1 September 1958, at Brentwood, to form the 1st Battalion, King&#x27;s Regiment (Manchester and Liverpool). The title reflected the seniority of the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool), formerly eighth in the infantry&#x27;s order of precedence. Regimental subtitles (i.e. Manchester and Liverpool) would be omitted in 1968 without affecting recruitment boundaries in North West England. The regiment inherited from its predecessors certain traditions, uniform distinctions, battle honours, and an association with the Royal Family, principally Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. As Queen of the United Kingdom in 1947, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon had assumed the position of Colonel-in-Chief of the Manchester Regiment, formalising a relationship conceived during the Second World War.

Queen&#x27;s and Regimental colours were presented to the 1st Battalion by the 18th Earl of Derby on 28 November. In addition to 1 KINGS, the regiment at that time consisted of three territorial battalions, all of which retained their historical designations, colours, uniforms, and honorary colonels. This practice continued until the Territorial Army&#x27;s restructuring in the late 1960s: the 5th Battalion, The King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool), was reduced to a company of the Lancastrian Volunteers; the 8th (Ardwick) Battalion, The Manchester Regiment amalgamated with the 9th Battalion, to form The Manchester Regiment (Ardwick and Ashton) Territorials and a separate company within The Lancastrian Volunteers. Other units were constituted by elements of The King&#x27;s Regiment and its predecessors, albeit in different services of the Army. Personnel from the Liverpool Scottish and defunct 5 KINGS became part of &quot;R&quot; (King&#x27;s) Battery, West Lancashire Regiment, Royal Artillery while the heritage of the Liverpool Irish and Liverpool Rifles was claimed by troops of other Royal Artillery batteries.

Within months, the regiment received notification that it would be stationed in Kenya, which was emerging from the Mau Mau Uprising and nearing independence. Arriving in 1959, 1 KINGS was accommodated in Gilgil, situated in the Rift Valley between Naivasha and Nakuru, until relocated to Muthaiga Camp, near Nairobi. Detached from the regiment at this time were elements of headquarters and two rifle companies (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot;), which became part of the Army&#x27;s contribution to the Persian Gulf garrison in Bahrain for more than a year. Subordinated to 24 Infantry Brigade, which Britain maintained in Kenya as part of the Strategic Reserve, 1 KINGS became liable for deployment to various locations in Africa and Asia.

Subsequent to Kuwait&#x27;s independence from Britain in June 1961, President Abd al-Karim Qasim directed belligerent speeches against the oil-rich Gulf state, declaring it an integral component of sovereign Iraq. Perceiving Qassim&#x27;s rhetoric to constitute a possible military threat to Kuwait&#x27;s sovereignty, Sheikh Abdullah III appealed to Britain and Saudi Arabia for assistance. Britain responded to the emergency by concentrating military forces in the Persian Gulf, composed initially of naval assets, as a deterrence to aggression. The Strategic Reserve&#x27;s 24 Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Horsford, was transported to Kuwait in Bristol Britannias in early July to augment the country&#x27;s defences. Opportunity for the Kingsmen to acclimatise before relieving 45 Commando was fleeting. Just days after arrival, 1 KINGS occupied a ridge formation approximately 30-miles west of Kuwait City to prepare a defensive position.

When the emergency ended, 1 KINGS returned to Kenya, and in early 1962 proceeded to Britain. By July, the regiment was based in West Berlin. While there, the regiment patrolled the border with Soviet occupied East Berlin. On returning to Britain in 1964, 1 KINGS became part of the UK Strategic Reserve. A company from the regiment deployed to British Honduras later that year.

The battalion&#x27;s first deployment to Northern Ireland under the hostile conditions of the Troubles occurred in 1970, although it did not suffer its first fatal casualties until a second tour in 1972. Violence escalated substantially in 1972, resulting in the deaths of 470 people. The year witnessed the greatest loss of life during the conflict – punctuated by two episodes known as Bloody Sunday and Bloody Friday – and imposition of direct rule following the prorogation of the Stormont Parliament by the Westminster Government. Operating in West Belfast, 1 KINGS sustained 49 casualties (seven fatalities and 42 wounded) during the four-month tour. The King&#x27;s first fatality was Corporal Alan Buckley, who died after being mortally wounded during an engagement with the PIRA. One-week later, on 23 May, a PIRA sniper shot Kingsman Hanley, who had been guarding a party of Royal Engineers removing barricades in the Ballymurphy sector. On the 30th, an IRA bomb detonated within the battalion headquarters killed two, including Kingsman Doglay. An initial report by The Times identified six casualties, including four wounded soldiers and two civilian cooks, and suggested officials believed losses would have been higher had the bomb exploded while hundreds of soldiers watched a film in the canteen. The headquarters, located in RUC Springfield Road, had been the &quot;most heavily guarded&quot; police station in Belfast. The battalion returned to Belfast in February 1979. In April 1979 Kingsman Shanley and Lance Corporal Rumble were killed in the same vehicle by a PIRA sniper.

===1980–2000===
Events were organised in 1985 to observe the tercentenary of the regiment&#x27;s raising in 1685 as the Princess Anne of Denmark&#x27;s Regiment of Foot. After returning to England, to be based at Saighton Camp just outside Chester, then later to Dale Barracks Chester when Saighton Camp closed in 1985, 1 KINGS deployed to the Falkland Islands for four months and then again to Northern Ireland in May 1986.

Northern Ireland remained the British Army&#x27;s largest operational commitment into the early 1990s. Violence had declined in frequency and casualties reduced in number; however, a new method of attack emerged during the regiment&#x27;s two-year posting to County Londonderry as a resident infantry battalion in 1990. The attack on 1 KINGS was the first in a series of vehicle-delivered &quot;proxy bomb&quot; attacks against multiple targets in 1990, three of which occurred on 24 October. Three men accused by the PIRA of collaborating with the security forces were abducted and their families held hostage. Employed by the British Army as a civilian cook, Patrick Gillespie was instructed to drive his vehicle, laden with explosives, to a designated checkpoint on the border with County Donegal, Republic of Ireland. Approximately 1,000 pounds of explosives contained within Gillespie&#x27;s vehicle was detonated remotely when it reached the permanent checkpoint on Buncrana Road, near Derry, wounding many and killing Lance-Corporal Burrows and Kingsmen Beecham, Scott, Sweeney and Worrall. Structural damage to buildings in a nearby housing estate and to military infrastructure was extensive.

In 1992 1 KINGS moved to west London to serve as a Public Duties Battalion. Almost immediately it received new Colours from the Colonel in Chief. Whilst in London one platoon was detached to 1 KINGS OWN BORDER in Derry whilst two platoons were attached from the newly formed The Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment, abbreviated PWRR. A company reinforced by one of the PWRR platoons deployed as the Resident Infantry Company to the Falkland Islands and South Georgia for a four-month tour of duty. However the principal task of the battalion was to provide troops to guard Buckingham Palace, St James&#x27;s Palace, HM Tower of London and Windsor Castle. As Public Duties came to an end in September 1994, the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robin Hodges, handed over command to his brother, Lieutenant Colonel Clive Hodges. Another tour-of-duty to Northern Ireland followed in 1995. The battalion moved to the Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus the following year. After returning to Britain, further deployments to Northern Ireland followed in 1999.

===2000–2006===

Prior to the firefighters&#x27; strikes of 2003, the regiment received basic firefighting training to provide emergency cover. The battalion operated in the Greater Manchester area during the strikes as part of Operation Fresco.
Almost two-months after President George W. Bush declared an end to &quot;major combat operations&quot; in Iraq in his &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; speech on 1 May 2003, 1 KINGS reinforced from the Territorial Army King&#x27;s and Cheshire Regiment deployed to the country with 19 Mechanised Brigade. Under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Ciaran Griffin, 1 KINGS Battlegroup operated primarily in Basra Province during the initial period of post-war occupation. Tactics, familiar to the Regiment, that had been employed in Northern Ireland and the Balkans, were adopted by the British forces occupying the south of Iraq. Unless conditions dictated the wearing of helmets and deployment of Warriors, 1 KINGS disembarked from Land Rovers to conduct foot patrols in &quot;soft hats&quot; (berets). During its tour, 1 King&#x27;s organised vehicle checkpoints, seized munitions, trained local forces, mediated tribal disputes, and engaged in a &quot;hearts and minds&quot; campaign. Civil disorder also occupied the battalion, particularly when rioting occurred in August and October. The British attributed the violent demonstrations in August to Iraqi grievances over the scarcity of fuel and power shortages, compounded by oppressive temperatures exceeding 50 °C (122 °F).

The Kingsmen returned to Catterick in November 2003. No fatal casualties had been incurred by the regiment and two officers and a Territorial Army soldier were decorated with operational gallantry awards in recognition of their contributions. Allegations of abuse were documented seven months later in a report published by Amnesty International on 11 May 2004. Coinciding with a controversy centred on the publication of unrelated photographs by the Daily Mirror newspaper, the report detailed the deaths of 37 civilians, including four Iraqis that were claimed to have been killed by members of 1 KINGS Battlegroup without apparent provocation. The circumstances of their deaths were disputed and senior British officers judged the actions of the soldiers responsible to have been in compliance with the Army&#x27;s rules of engagement. Iraqi families brought their cases to the High Court of Justice in an attempt to secure independent inquiries and compensation. The court, presided over by Lord Justice Rix and Justice Forbes, concluded in December that British jurisdiction did not extend to &quot;the total territory of another state which is not itself a party to the Convention&quot;, prompting the families to challenge the judgement in the Court of Appeal. Their appeals were dismissed in December 2005.

In December 2004, it was announced that The King&#x27;s Regiment, the King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment and the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment, would be amalgamated to form The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment (King&#x27;s, Lancashire and Border) as part of the restructuring of the infantry. On formation of the new regiment on 1 July 2006, 1 KINGS became the 2nd Battalion The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment, abbreviated as 2 LANCS, but very quickly the manpower of all three merging regiments was deliberately mixed to give the new regiment its own character.

==Territorials==
When the regiment was created, all three of the remaining Territorial battalions from both the King&#x27;s and Manchesters, were transferred without a change in title. These were:
*5th Battalion, King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool); at Townsend Avenue, Liverpool
*8th (Ardwick) Battalion, Manchester Regiment; at Ardwick Green, Manchester
*9th Battalion, Manchester Regiment; at Ashton-under-Lyne

In 1967 when the TAVR was created, the 3 Battalions were reduced to 2 companies of the Lancastrian Volunteers. 5th King&#x27;s, became B Company (King&#x27;s); whilst both 8th and 9th Manchesters became C Company (Manchester).

===5th/8th (Volunteer) Battalion===

However, this regiment didn&#x27;t last very long, and in 1975 control of the Territorial units was placed back under the affiliated regiments. Therefore, HQ, B, and C Companies, 1st Battalion, Lancastrian Volunteers, alongside B Company (later D Company) of the 2nd Battalion were redesignated as the 5th/8th (Volunteer) Battalion of the King&#x27;s Regiment. Upon formation, the battalion&#x27;s structure was as follows:
*HQ Company, at Warrington
*A Company, at Warrington
*B Company, at Townsend Avenue, Liverpool
*C Company, at Ardwick Green, Manchester
*D Company, at Townsend Avenue, Liverpool

1984 saw the creation of a Home Service Force company- E (HSF) Company, with platoons spread throughout the company locations. The HSF was disbanded, however, in 1992 at the end of the Cold War, and therefore so was the company. At the same time as E Company disbanded, the battalion was reduced down to three rifle companies, and retained this structure until amalgamation in 1999.
*HQ (The Lancastrian) Company, at Warrington
*A (The King&#x27;s Liverpool) Company, at Townsend Avenue, Liverpool
*C (The Manchester) Company, at Ardwick Green, Manchester
*V (The Liverpool Scottish) Company, at Score Lane, Liverpool &quot;(transferred from 1st Battalion, 51st Highland Volunteers)&quot;

The Battalion amalgamated with the 3rd (Volunteer) Battalion of the Cheshire Regiment, in 1999, to form the King&#x27;s and Cheshire Regiment; A and V Companies amalgamated as A (King&#x27;s) Company, and C Company was redesignated as C (King&#x27;s) Company, of the new regiment. The King&#x27;s Companies of the King&#x27;s and Cheshire Regiment, later went on to amalgamate with the Lancastrian and Cumbrian Volunteers to form 4th Battalion, Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment.

<text>HMAS &quot;Maryborough&quot; (J195/B248/A122), named for the city of Maryborough, Queensland, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 20 built on Admiralty order but manned by personnel of and commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). She was the first naval vessel built in Queensland for the Royal Australian Navy during World War II.

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of . The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including &quot;Maryborough&quot;) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Maryborough&quot; was constructed by Walkers Limited in Maryborough, Queensland. She was laid down on 16 April 1940, launched on 17 October 1940 by Mrs. A. Goldsmith, wife of the general manager of Walkers, and commissioned on 12 June 1941. Engineer Rear Admiral Percival E. McNeil, third member of the Naval Board, Commander E. C. Rhodes, District Naval Officer and Lieutenant-Commander N. S. Pixley attended as official party with the rector, St. Pauls Church of England, Mayborough, Rev. A. E. Taylor leading a religious service before launching.

==Operational history==
The ship served a brief period on Australia&#x27;s east coast before departing in November 1941 for Singapore, where she was assigned to the 21st Minesweeping Flotilla along with , and with the flotilla&#x27;s commander, Commander Cant, in &quot;Maryborough&quot;. The flotilla was engaged in minesweeping, patrolling and escort duties throughout December.

After the fall of Singapore &quot;Maryborough&quot; and the flotilla, now including and , were engaged in the defense of the Dutch East Indies, raiding oil refineries in Sumatra to deny them to the Japanese and patrolling the southern area of the Sunda Strait, in particular to prevent Japanese landings in small native craft, until 28 February when Commander Cant took the flotilla to Tjilatjap for replenishment. During the night orders came to return to the strait so that &quot;Maryborough&quot; and three other ships turned back but on 1 March Batavia was ordered evacuated and the ships, then about 50 miles east of Java Head headed again for Tjilatjap. There, as Java was evacuated, Commander Cant made space on his ships for about thirty passengers each and on the night of 2 March, the other ships already having left escorting evacuation ships, &quot;Maryborough&quot; departed escorting the Dutch ship bound for Fremantle.

Those actions were followed by convoy duty in the South Atlantic to the Persian Gulf and involvement in raising the siege of Malta. From November 1942 until December 1944, &quot;Maryborough&quot; was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet.

For her wartime service, the corvette was awarded three battle honours: &quot;Pacific 1942&quot;, &quot;Indian Ocean 1942–44&quot;, and &quot;Sicily 1943&quot;.

==Fate==
&quot;Maryborough&quot; paid off in December 1945, and was sold to the Australian General Trading and Shipping Syndicate on 9 May 1947, who renamed her &quot;Isobel Queen&quot;. For years she was berthed near Victoria Bridge, Brisbane but never sailed under her own power after sale by the navy in 1947. She was later sold for scrap to Carr Enterprises in Brisbane, in 1953.

<text>Leon Eric Brooks III, better known by his stage name Kix Brooks (born May 12, 1955), is an American country music artist, actor, and film producer best known for being one half of the duo Brooks &amp; Dunn and host of radio&#x27;s &quot;American Country Countdown&quot;. Prior to the duo&#x27;s foundation, he was a singer and songwriter, charting twice on Hot Country Songs and releasing an album for Capitol Records. Brooks and Ronnie Dunn comprised Brooks &amp; Dunn for twenty years, then both members began solo careers. Brooks’ solo career after Brooks &amp; Dunn includes the album &quot;New to This Town&quot;.

In 2019, Brooks was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame as a member of Brooks &amp; Dunn.

==Early life==
Brooks grew up in Shreveport, Louisiana. He has a sister, a half-sister, and a half-brother; his father also adopted a son of his third wife. After graduating from the former Sewanee Military Academy, an Episcopal school in Sewanee, Tennessee, Brooks attended Louisiana Tech University in Ruston as a theatre arts major. He moved to Alaska to work with his father on an oil pipeline for one summer, then returned to Louisiana Tech to finish his education. After graduating, he moved to Maine to write advertising for a company owned by his sister and brother-in-law.

==Musical career==

Brooks&#x27; father urged him to pursue his desire to become a musician, and he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in the early 1980s. His then-girlfriend (now wife Barbara, with whom he has a son and daughter) followed shortly thereafter. He worked for Tree Publishing as a staff songwriter. He recorded his first solo single, &quot;Baby, When Your Heart Breaks Down&quot;, for Avion in 1983, but returned to songwriting after it only reached number 73 on the Hot Country Songs chart. Brooks and Dan Tyler co-wrote &quot;Modern Day Romance&quot;, released by Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in June 1985; it became the band&#x27;s second No. 1 hit on the country chart.

Brooks released an album, &quot;Kix Brooks&quot;, in 1989 on Capitol Records. This album also featured the song &quot;Sacred Ground&quot; which became a No. 2 country hit for McBride &amp; the Ride in 1992.

He was one half of country music duo Brooks &amp; Dunn. Their 1991 debut album, &quot;Brand New Man&quot;, generated four number-one hit singles on the country charts. Brooks usually provided backing vocals on their songs and singles. The singles featuring Brooks on lead vocals include, &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me When I&#x27;m Gone&quot; (the only Brooks &amp; Dunn single featuring Brooks on lead vocals to reach No. 1), &quot;Lost and Found&quot;, &quot;Rock My World (Little Country Girl)&quot;, &quot;Mama Don&#x27;t Get Dressed Up for Nothing&quot;, &quot;South of Santa Fe&quot;, and &quot;Why Would I Say Goodbye&quot;.

On August 10, 2009, Brooks &amp; Dunn announced to their fans, via their website they intended to disband after twenty years of touring. According to the short statement released on their web site, Brooks &amp; Dunn intended to release a greatest hits album, tour during the rest of 2009, and have a farewell tour in 2010.

Brooks resumed his solo career in 2012, releasing a new 12-track album on September 11, 2012. &quot;New to This Town&quot; features nine songs co-written by Brooks, including the album&#x27;s first single, the title track. He followed his second album with the soundtrack to the western film &quot;Ambush at Dark Canyon&quot; in 2014. Brooks composed the majority of the musical score as well as starring in the film.

On December 3, 2014, Brooks &amp; Dunn reunited, and along with Reba McEntire, performed a series of concerts in Las Vegas, Nevada, throughout the summer and fall of 2015.

Brooks performed at the 2019 Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum Concert and Induction Ceremony.

==Awards==

In 2005, Brooks, along with timber industrialist Roy O. Martin Jr., and the Louisiana State University sports legends Paul Dietzel, and Sue Gunter were among those named a &quot;Louisiana Legend&quot; by Louisiana Public Broadcasting.

==Other achievements==
Since January 2006, Brooks has hosted &quot;American Country Countdown&quot;, a syndicated radio countdown show based on Mediabase (originally was BILLBOARD, from 2006 to August 2009), country charts. Brooks succeeded the show&#x27;s former host, Bob Kingsley. Brooks is also co-owner of Arrington Vineyards, a Nashville winery with winemaker Kip Summers and businessmen John Russell.

In 2013, Kix launched the film company Team Two Entertainment along with Eric Brooks. The company makes independent films Kix produces, and Kix occasionally appears as an actor.

In 2015, Brooks contracted with Cooking Channel to host &quot;Steak Out with Kix Brooks&quot;, in which he travels around America in search of the best steakhouses.

<doc id="503770" wikidata="Q1849087" url="?curid=503770" title="List of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 1994">
<text>This is a list of the American &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine Hot 100 number-ones of 1994. There were 10 singles that topped the chart this year. The first of these, &quot;Hero&quot; by Mariah Carey, spent three weeks at the top, concluding a four-week run that had begun in December 1993. The longest running number-one single of 1994 is &quot;I&#x27;ll Make Love to You&quot; by Boyz II Men, which logged 14 weeks at number-one, tying the song with &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; by Whitney Houston for the most weeks at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 until &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men stayed atop the chart from December 1995 to the first quarter of 1996.

With the rise of &quot;On Bended Knee&quot; to the top of the Hot 100, Boyz II Men became the first act to chart consecutive number-one singles in the United States since The Beatles charted three consecutive number-one singles in 1964.

Furthermore, Lisa Loeb became the first artist to reach #1 with &quot;Stay (I Missed You)&quot; before signing to any record label.

That year, 7 acts earned their first number one song: Celine Dion, Ace of Base, R. Kelly, All-4-One, Lisa Loeb &amp; Nine Stories, and Ini Kamoze. Sting, already having hit number one with The Police, earned his first number one song as a solo act. Boyz II Men was the only act to hit number one more than once, by hitting twice.

<doc id="503776" wikidata="Q1546608" url="?curid=503776" title="Tinglish">
<text>Tinglish (or Thaiglish, Thenglish, Thailish, Thainglish, etc.) refers to any form of English mixed with or heavily influenced by Thai. It is typically produced by native Thai speakers due to language interference from the first language. Differences from standard native English occur in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. The term was coined in 1970, and several alternative terms have been proposed since its inception, such as &quot;Thainglish&quot; (1973), &quot;Thaiglish&quot; (1992), &quot;Tinglish&quot; (1994), &quot;Thinglish&quot; (1976), &quot;Thenglish&quot; (2003), and &quot;Tenglish&quot; (2012).

==Characteristics and examples==
Characteristics and examples (direct translation) include :
* omission of pronouns
* zero copula
* use of present tense + &quot;already&quot;, in contrast to past tense of Standard English (but similar to the recent past tense in Irish English)
* non-standard use or omissions of articles, declension, prepositions, and conjugation.
* addition of Thai final particles, e.g., &quot;I don’t know na&quot;
* &quot;any&quot; and &quot;every&quot; are used interchangeably
* different use of conditional constructions
* no use of double negatives
* moving &quot;S&quot; on singular verbs to the subject, for instance &quot;He&#x27;s talk too much&quot; instead of &quot;He talks too much&quot;
* omission of prepositions, for instance &quot;I wait you&quot; instead of &quot;I&#x27;ll wait for you&quot; or &quot;I listen him&quot; for &quot;I listened to him&quot;.
* &quot;very&quot; and &quot;very much&quot; are used interchangeably, for instance &quot;I very love my daughter&quot; and &quot;She beautiful very much&quot;.

=== Examples of words and phrases ===
Examples (direct translation) include:

==Pronunciation==

As some sounds in English do not exist in the Thai language, this affects the way native Thai speakers pronounce English words, as displayed in loanwords.

=== Adaptation of consonants ===
English consonants with corresponding sounds in Thai are simply carried over, while others are adapted to a similar-sounding consonant.
*, , and are devoiced to , , and : &quot;goal&quot; → , &quot;zip&quot; → , &quot;jam&quot; → .
* becomes the affricate : &quot;shirt&quot; → .
*The &quot;th&quot; sounds and are replaced by or : &quot;thank you&quot; → 
*Initial is replaced by , but final is replaced by : &quot;level&quot; → , &quot;serve&quot; → .
*Initial consonant clusters with followed by a voiceless unaspirated stop do not occur in Thai, so is added between these consonants: &quot;start&quot; → 
*Final became in older loanwords, whereas modern adaptation generally favors instead: &quot;grill&quot; → . 
*Final consonant clusters are generally truncated to only the sound directly after the vowel: &quot;act&quot; → .

=== Adaptation of vowels ===

* Diphthongs and triphthongs are generally simplified to long vowels, such as the in &quot;blade&quot; becoming . Exceptions are diphthongs ending in and , which are instead reanalysed as the Thai diphthongs ending in and : &quot;tie&quot; → , &quot;view&quot; → .

=== Tone assignment ===
All Thai syllables must have one of five tones (mid, low, falling, high, rising). English words adapted into Thai are systematically given these tones according to certain rules. English loanwords are often unusual in that tone markers are normally omitted, meaning that they are often pronounced with a different tone from that indicated by their spelling.

* Monosyllabic words that end in sonorants take the mid tone, while those that end in obstruents either take the low tone or the high tone, with the high tone predominant.
* For polysyllabics, the nonfinal consonants follow similar rules to monosyllabics, although they always take high tone when ending in obstruents.
* The tone of final consonants that end in sonorants depend on where the stress falls in the original English word. If the final syllable is stressed, the mid tone is taken, while non-final stress correlates with the falling tone being taken.
* Final consonants ending in obstruents take the low, high, or falling tone in descending order of frequency.
According to Wei and Zhou (2002), Thai is a tonal language, whose syllables take approximately the same time to pronounce, Thai people often have difficulty with English word stress. They, instead, stress the last syllable by adding high pitch (Choksuansup, 2014). 
When it comes to vowels, there are 21 phonemes in Thai compared with 15 vowels in English; therefore, it is relatively easy for Thai people to imitate the English vowels. However, the two systems have a significant discrepancy: Thai vowels are distinguished by shortness and length, while for English, it is laxness and tenseness. That explains why Thai English speakers perceive and produce lax sounds as short sounds and tense sounds as long sounds, which gives their pronunciation its uniqueness (Kruatrachue, 1960). 
In terms of consonants, there are a number of English consonants which do not exist in Thai. This makes it difficult for the Thai to perceive the difference among some sounds and produce them correctly. Instead, they replace the English consonants with the most similar sounds in Thai (Trakulkasemsuk, 2012):
 /r/ can be pronounced as /l/ or dropped.
/tʃ/, /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ are altered by Thai /tɕʰ/ (aspirated voiceless fortis palatal stop with slight affrication).
/dʒ/ is substituted by Thai /tɕ/ (weakly glottalized unaspirated voiceless fortis palatal stop).
/θ/ become either / t̪⁼/ (voiceless unaspirated apical alveolar stop), /t/, or /s/.
/ð/ is replaced by /d/
/v/ is pronounced as /w/, and /z/ as /s/
In addition, consonant cluster /st/ does not exist in Thai, so they pronounce it as /sə.t/; for example: stop /sə.tɑːp/. Ending sounds are oftentimes omitted (Choksuansup, 2014).

<doc id="503782" wikidata="Q221179" url="?curid=503782" title="Streptococcus pneumoniae">
<text>Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, is a Gram-positive, spherical bacteria, alpha-hemolytic member of the genus &quot;Streptococcus&quot;. &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; cells are usually found in pairs (diplococci) and do not form spores and are non motile. As a significant human pathogenic bacterium &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; was recognized as a major cause of pneumonia in the late 19th century, and is the subject of many humoral immunity studies.

&quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; resides asymptomatically in healthy carriers typically colonizing the respiratory tract, sinuses, and nasal cavity. However, in susceptible individuals with weaker immune systems, such as the elderly and young children, the bacterium may become pathogenic and spread to other locations to cause disease. It spreads by direct person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets and by auto inoculation in persons carrying the bacteria in their upper respiratory tracts. It can be a cause of neonatal infections.

&quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; is the main cause of community acquired pneumonia and meningitis in children and the elderly, and of sepsis in those infected with HIV. The organism also causes many types of pneumococcal infections other than pneumonia. These invasive pneumococcal diseases include bronchitis, rhinitis, acute sinusitis, otitis media, conjunctivitis, meningitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, peritonitis, pericarditis, cellulitis, and brain abscess.

&quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; can be differentiated from the viridans streptococci, some of which are also alpha-hemolytic, using an optochin test, as &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; is optochin-sensitive. &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; can also be distinguished based on its sensitivity to lysis by bile, the so-called &quot;bile solubility test&quot;. The encapsulated, Gram-positive, coccoid bacteria have a distinctive morphology on Gram stain, lancet-shaped diplococci. They have a polysaccharide capsule that acts as a virulence factor for the organism; more than 100 different serotypes are known, and these types differ in virulence, prevalence, and extent of drug resistance.

The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) serves as a critical defense mechanism against the host immune system. It composes the outermost layer of encapsulated strains of &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; and is commonly attached to the peptidoglycan of the cell wall. It consists of a viscous substance derived from a high-molecular-weight polymer composed of repeating oligosaccharide units linked by covalent bonds to the cell wall. The virulence and invasiveness of various strains of &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; vary according to their serotypes, determined by their chemical composition and the quantity of CPS they produce. Variations among different &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; strains significantly influence pathogenesis, determining bacterial survival and likelihood of causing invasive disease. Additionally, the CPS inhibits phagocytosis by preventing granulocytes&#x27; access to the cell wall.

==History==
In 1881, the organism, known later in 1886 as the pneumococcus for its role as a cause of pneumonia, was first isolated simultaneously and independently by the U.S. Army physician George Sternberg and the French chemist Louis Pasteur.

The organism was termed &quot;Diplococcus pneumoniae&quot; from 1920 because of its characteristic appearance in Gram-stained sputum. It was renamed &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; in 1974 because it was very similar to streptococci.

&quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; played a central role in demonstrating that genetic material consists of DNA. In 1928, Frederick Griffith demonstrated transformation of life turning harmless pneumococcus into a lethal form by co-inoculating the live pneumococci into a mouse along with heat-killed virulent pneumococci. In 1944, Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty demonstrated that the transforming factor in Griffith&#x27;s experiment was not protein, as was widely believed at the time, but DNA. Avery&#x27;s work marked the birth of the molecular era of genetics.

==Genetics==
The genome of &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; is a closed, circular DNA structure that contains between 2.0 and 2.1 million base pairs depending on the strain. It has a core set of 1553 genes, plus 154 genes in its , which contribute to virulence and 176 genes that maintain a noninvasive phenotype. Genetic information can vary up to 10% between strains. The pneumococcal genome is known to contain a large and diverse repertoire of antimicrobial peptides, including 11 different lantibiotics.

===Transformation===
Natural bacterial transformation involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through the surrounding medium. Transformation is a complex developmental process requiring energy and is dependent on expression of numerous genes. In &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;, at least 23 genes are required for transformation. For a bacterium to bind, take up, and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome, it must enter a special physiological state called competence.
Competence in &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; is induced by DNA-damaging agents such as mitomycin C, fluoroquinolone antibiotics (norfloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin), and topoisomerase inhibitors. Transformation protects &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; against the bactericidal effect of mitomycin C. Michod et al. summarized evidence that induction of competence in &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; is associated with increased resistance to oxidative stress and increased expression of the RecA protein, a key component of the recombinational repair machinery for removing DNA damage. On the basis of these findings, they suggested that transformation is an adaptation for repairing oxidative DNA damage. &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; infection stimulates polymorphonuclear leukocytes (granulocytes) to produce an oxidative burst that is potentially lethal to the bacteria. The ability of &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; to repair oxidative DNA damage in its genome caused by this host defense likely contributes to the pathogen&#x27;s virulence. Consistent with this premise, Li et al. reported that, among different highly transformable &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; isolates, nasal colonization fitness and virulence (lung infectivity) depend on an intact competence system.

==Infection==
&quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; is part of the normal upper respiratory tract flora. As with many natural flora, it can become pathogenic under the right conditions, typically when the immune system of the host is suppressed. Invasins, such as pneumolysin, an antiphagocytic capsule, various adhesins, and immunogenic cell wall components are all major virulence factors. After &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; colonizes the air sacs of the lungs, the body responds by stimulating the inflammatory response, causing plasma, blood, and white blood cells to fill the alveoli. This condition is called bacterial pneumonia.

&quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; undergoes spontaneous phase variation, changing between transparent and opaque colony phenotypes. The transparent phenotype has a thinner capsule and expresses large amounts of phosphorylcholine (ChoP) and choline-binding protein A (CbpA), contributing to the bacteria&#x27;s ability to adhere and colonize in the nasopharynx. The opaque phenotype is characterized by a thicker capsule, resulting in increased resistance to host clearance. It expresses large amounts of capsule and pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) which help the bacteria survive in the blood. Phase-variation between these two phenotypes allows &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; to survive in different human body systems.

==Diseases and symptoms==
Pneumonia is the most prevalent disease caused by &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae.&quot; Pneumonia is a lung infection characterized by symptoms such as fever, chills, coughing, rapid or labored breathing, and chest pain. For the elderly, those who contract pneumonia have also shown these lesser nonspecific symptoms, but also tend to show that they have tachypnea a few days before clinical certainty that they have contracted the bacterial illness. Tachypnea is characterized by rapid and shallow breathing and can affect a person’s ability to sleep, chest pain, and a decreased appetite.

While a few different bacterial infections can lead to meningitis, S. pneumoniae is one of the leading causes of this infection. Pneumococcal meningitis occurs when the bacteria goes from the blood to the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain and the spinal cord. Here, the infection will spread and cause inflammation, leading to severe disabilities like brain damage or hearing loss or limb removal or death. Symptoms include common problems such as head aches, fevers, and nausea, but the more telling signs that a bacterial infection may have reached the brain are sensitivity to light, seizures, having limited range in neck movement, and easy bruising all over the body.

Osteomyelitis, or bone infection, is a rare occurrence but has been seen in patients who were diagnosed to have a S. pneumoniae infection that went untreated for too long.

Sepsis is caused by overwhelming response to an infection and leads to tissue damage, organ failure, and even death. The symptoms include confusion, shortness of breath, elevated heart rate, pain or discomfort, over-perspiration, fever, shivering, or feeling cold.

Less severe illnesses that can be caused by pneumococcal infection are conjunctivitis (pink eye ), otitis media (middle ear infection), Bronchitis (airway inflammation), and sinusitis (sinus infection).

== Vaccine ==

Due to the importance of disease caused by &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;, several vaccines have been developed to protect against invasive infection. The World Health Organization recommends routine childhood pneumococcal vaccination; it is incorporated into the childhood immunization schedule in a number of countries including the United Kingdom, the United States, Greece,and South Africa.

Currently, there are two vaccines available for S. pneumoniae: the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). PPV23 functions by utilizing CPS to stimulate the production of type-specific antibodies, initiating processes such as complement activation, opsonization, and phagocytosis to combat bacterial infections. It elicits a humoral immune response targeting the CPS present on the bacterial surface. PPSV23 offers T-cell-independent immunity and requires revaccination 5 years after the first vaccination because of its temporary nature. PCV13 was developed when determining its low efficacy in children and infants. PCV13 elicits a T-cell-dependent response and provides enduring immunity by promoting interaction between B and T cells, leading to an enhanced and prolonged immune response.

==Biotechnology==
Components from &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; have been harnessed for a range of applications in biotechnology. Through engineering of surface molecules from this bacterium, proteins can be irreversibly linked using the sortase enzyme or using the SnoopTag/SnoopCatcher reaction. Various glycoside hydrolases have also been cloned from &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; to help analysis of cell glycosylation.

==Interaction with &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;==
Historically, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; has been a significant cause of infection, and both &quot;H. influenzae&quot; and &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; can be found in the human upper respiratory system. A study of competition &quot;in vitro&quot; revealed &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; overpowered &quot;H. influenzae&quot; by attacking it with hydrogen peroxide. There is also evidence that &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; uses hydrogen peroxide as a virulence factor. However, in a study adding both bacteria to the nasal cavity of a mouse within two weeks, only &quot;H. influenzae&quot; survives; further analysis showed that neutrophils (a type of phagocyte) exposed to dead &quot;H. influenzae&quot; were more aggressive in attacking &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is generally made based on clinical suspicion along with a positive culture from a sample from virtually any place in the body. &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; is, in general, optochin sensitive, although optochin resistance has been observed.

The recent advances in next-generation sequencing and comparative genomics have enabled the development of robust and reliable molecular methods for the detection and identification of &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;. For instance, the &quot;Xisco&quot; gene was recently described as a biomarker for PCR-based detection of &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; and differentiation from closely related species.

Atromentin and leucomelone possess antibacterial activity, inhibiting the enzyme enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, (essential for the biosynthesis of fatty acids) in &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;.

== Resistance ==

Resistant pneumococcal strains are called penicillin-resistant pneumococci (PRP), penicillin-resistant &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; (PRSP), &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; penicillin resistant (SPPR) or drug-resistant &quot;Strepotococcus pneumoniae&quot; (DRSP). In 2015, in the US, there were an estimated 30,000 cases, and in 30% of them the strains were resistant to one or more antibiotics.

<doc id="503783" wikidata="Q1094977" url="?curid=503783" title="Clan MacLeod">
<text>Clan MacLeod ( ; ) is a Highland Scottish clan associated with the Isle of Skye. There are two main branches of the clan: the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, known in Gaelic as (&quot;seed of Tormod&quot;) and the Clan MacLeod of Lewis Assynt and Raasay, known in Gaelic as (&quot;seed of Torcall&quot;). Both branches claim descent from Leòd, a Norse-Gael who lived in the 13th century.

Today, Clan MacLeod of The Lewes, Clan MacLeod of Raasay, and Clan MacLeod are represented by &quot;Associated Clan MacLeod Societies&quot;, and the chiefs of the three clans. The association is made up of ten national societies across the world including: Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United States.

==History==
===Origins===

The surname MacLeod means &#x27;son of Leòid&#x27;. The name Leod is an Anglicization of the Scottish Gaelic name Leòid, which is thought to have been derived from the Old Norse. &quot;Clann&quot; means &quot;children of the family, offspring, descendants, clan&quot;, while &quot;mhic&quot; is the genitive of &quot;mac&quot;, the Gaelic for &quot;son&quot;, and &quot;Leòid&quot; is the genitive of Leòd. The whole phrase &quot;Clan McLeod&quot; therefore means &quot;The children/offspring/descendants of the son of Leod&quot;.

The Clan MacLeod of Lewis claims its descent from Leòid, who according to MacLeod tradition was a younger son of Olaf the Black, King of Mann (r.1229–1237). However, articles have been published in the Clan MacLeod magazine which suggest an alternative genealogy for Leòid, one in which he was not son of Olaf, but a 3rd cousin (some removed) from Magnus the last King of Mann. These alternative genealogies use the genealogy of Christina MacLeod, great granddaughter of Leòid, who married Hector Reaganach (McLean/McLaine). These articles suggest that the relationship to the Kings of Mann was through a female line, that of Helga of the Beautiful Hair. The dating of Christina&#x27;s genealogy and the ability to line it up with known historical facts lend a great deal of authenticity to the claims of the authors.

MacLeod tradition is that Leòid, who had possession of Harris and part of Skye, married a daughter of the Norse seneschal of Skye, MacArailt or Harold&#x27;s son who held Dunvegan and much of Skye. Tradition stated that Leòid&#x27;s two sons, Tormod and Torquil, founded the two main branches of the Clan MacLeod, &quot;Siol Tormod&quot; and &quot;Siol Torquil&quot;. Torquil was actually a grandson of Tormod; Torquil&#x27;s descendants held the lands of the Isle of Lewis until the early seventeenth century when the Mackenzies successfully overthrew the Lewismen, partly with the aid of the Morrisons, and the MacLeods of Harris (Siol Tormod). Younger branches of Siol Torquil held the mainland lands of Assynt and Cadboll longer, and the Isle of Raasay until 1846. Siol Tormod held Harris and Glenelg on the mainland, and also the lands of Dunvegan on the Isle of Skye.

Leòid, according to tradition, died around 1280 and was buried on the holy island of Iona, where six successive chiefs of the clan found a last resting-place after him.

===14th century===
Tormod, son of Leod, does not appear in contemporary records; though according to MacLeod tradition preserved in the 19th century &quot;Bannatyne manuscript&quot;, he was a noted soldier of his era and was present at the Battle of Bannockburn. Tormod&#x27;s son and successor, Malcolm, is the first of the clan to appear in contemporary record when both he and his kinsman, Torquil, are recorded as &quot;Malcolme, son to Tormode M&#x27;Cloyde&quot;, and &quot;Torkyll M&#x27;Cloyd&quot;, in a royal charter dating to about 1343, during the reign of David II (r. 1329–1371). 
Malcolm was succeeded by his eldest child, Iain Ciar, as fourth chief of the clan. R.C. MacLeod dated this event to about 1330. Iain Ciar appears in MacLeod tradition as the most tyrannical chief of the clan; his wife is also said to have been just as cruel as he. Clan tradition states that he was wounded in an ambush on Harris, and soon after died from these wounds at the church at Rodel. R.C. MacLeod dated his death to 1392. Tradition has it that the Lord of the Isles made another attack on Skye in 1395, but Iain&#x27;s grandson William MacLeod met the MacDonalds at Sligachan (Sligichen) and drove them back to Loch Eynort (Ainort). There they found that their galleys had been moved offshore by the MacAskills, and every invader was killed. The spoils were divided at Creag an Fheannaidh (&#x27;Rock of the Flaying&#x27;) or Creggan ni feavigh (&#x27;Rock of the Spoil&#x27;), sometimes identified with the Bloody Stone in Harta Corrie.

===15th-century clan conflicts===

The Battle of Harlaw was fought in 1411 where the MacLeods fought as Highlanders in support of Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles, chief of Clan Donald.

The Battle of Bloody Bay was fought in 1481 where the Clan MacLeod supported John of Islay, Earl of Ross, chief of Clan Donald against his bastard son Angus Og Macdonald. William Dubh MacLeod, chief of Clan MacLeod was killed in the battle.

===16th-century clan conflicts===

During the 16th century the Clan MacLeod feuded heavily with the Clan Macdonald of Sleat.

In 1588 William MacLeod of Dunvegan, the 13th chief, bound himself and his heirs in a bond of manrent to &quot;assist, maintain, and defend, and concur with Lachlan Mackintosh of Dunachton, Captain and Chief of the Clan Chattan, and his heirs.&quot;

===17th century – peace among the clans and Civil War===
The Battle of Coire Na Creiche in 1601 on Skye saw the MacLeods defeated by Clan MacDonald of Sleat on the northern slopes of the Cuillin hills. In 1608 after a century of feuding which included battles between the MacDonalds, the Clan Mackenzie and Clan MacLean, all of the relevant Chiefs were called to a Lee lr meeting with Lord Ochiltree who was the King&#x27;s representative. Here they discussed the future Royal intentions for governing the Isles. The Chiefs did not agree with the King and were all thrown into prison. Donald the Chief of the Clan MacDonald of Sleat was incarcerated in the Blackness Castle. His release was granted when he at last submitted to the King. Donald died in 1616 and then Donald Gorm Org MacDonald, 9th Chief, 1st Baronet of Sleat, his nephew succeeded as the chief and became the first Baronet of Sleat. Clan MacDonald of Sleat continues to hold title to Trotternish and Sleat on Skye from that day until the present.

During the Civil War, after the Battle of Carbisdale in 1650 the defeated James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose surrendered himself to Neil MacLeod of Assynt at Ardvreck Castle. MacLeod&#x27; wife, Christine Munro, tricked Montrose into the castle dungeon and sent for troops of the Covenanter Government, and as a result Montrose was captured and executed.

During the Civil War as many as 500 MacLeods fought as royalists at the Battle of Worcester in 1651.

===18th century and Jacobite risings===

The MacLeods having supported the Jacobite rising of 1715, General Wade&#x27;s report on the Highlands in 1724, estimated the clan strength at 1,000 men.

During the Jacobite rising of 1745 the chief of the Clan MacLeod, Norman MacLeod of Dunvegan, did not support the Jacobites and instead raised several Independent Highland Companies in support of the Government forces. The chief led 500 men of the MacLeod Independent Highland Companies in support of the Government at the Battle of Inverurie, on 23 December 1745, where they were defeated.

The Macleods of Raasay, a branch of the MacLeods of Lewis, fought at the Battle of Culloden as part of the Glengarry Regiment, in retribution, the MacLeods of Dunvegan, under their chief, Norman MacLeod, burned and pillaged the Island of Raasay, harassing its inhabitants for many weeks in the late summer of 1746. As a result, Norman MacLeod became known as &quot;The Wicked Man&quot;. In 1745, MacLeod of Dunvegan was said to have been able to &quot;bring out&quot; 700 men.

===19th, 20th and 21st centuries===

The eldest son of Norman MacLeod of MacLeod (1812–1895), Norman Magnus (1839–1929), succeeded as the 26th chief. The 26th chief died without male issue. Norman MacLeod of MacLeod&#x27;s second eldest son, Torquil Olave (1841–1857) had earlier died without issue as well. Norman Magnus MacLeod of MacLeod was, therefore, succeeded by Norman MacLeod of MacLeod&#x27;s third son, Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847–1935), as the 27th chief of Clan MacLeod. Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod had no sons, but two daughters. Dame Flora MacLeod succeeded her father and was followed by her grandson John Wolrige Gordon MacLeod. In 2007, Hugh Magnus MacLeod became the 30th Chief of the Clan MacLeod. For the following events see Chiefs of Clan MacLeod.

==Clan societies and parliament==
There are ten clan societies affiliated with the Associated Clan MacLeod Societies (ACMS), based in Edinburgh, Scotland. The ACMS is international body which coordinates the ten affiliated national societies around the world. The national societies are Australia (established 1912; re-established 1951), Canada (est. 1936), England (est. 1937), France (est. 1981), Germany (est. 2003), Switzerland ( est. 2013), New Zealand (est. 1954), Scotland (est. 1891), South Africa (est. 1960) and The United States of America (est. 1954). Membership to many of these societies are open to anyone who bears the surname Macleod; anyone who is descended from people bearing the surname MacLeod, connected by marriage; anyone who is a member of the septs of the clan; anyone with an interest in the affairs of the clan, whether or not they are related to the MacLeods. In some societies, memberships are available at a price; with yearly memberships to 15-year memberships (Scotland). Every four years members of the national societies gather together at a clan parliament. The last clan parliament was held at the end of July 2014 and took place at Dunvegan.

==Castles associated with the clan==

Castles that have been owned by the Clan MacLeod have included amongst others:
*Dunvegan Castle, a mile north of the village of Dunvegan on the Skye, dates from the fourteenth century and originally stood on an island. It is the seat of the chief of Clan MacLeod. The castle includes a massive keep or tower, as well as the famous Fairy Tower, as well as a hall block and many more later extensions.
*Cadboll Castle, near Tain, Ross-shire is a now ruinous L-plan tower house. It was originally held by the Clyne family, then the MacLeods of Cadboll, but later passed to the Clan Sinclair.
*Knock Castle (Isle of Skye), also known as Caisteal Camus and Casteal Chamius, was held by the MacLeods in the fifteenth century but later passed to the Clan MacDonald. In 1515, in an attempt to resurrect the Lordship of the Isles the castle was unsuccessfully besieged by Alastair Crotach MacLeod.
*Casteal Mhicleod, near to Shiel Bridge in Lochaber, is a ruinous castle that was once held by Alastair Crotach MacLeod and was still in use in the sixteenth century. 
*Dunscaith Castle, also known as Dun Sgathaich, near Armadale, Sleat, Isle of Skye, is a now ruinous castle on a rock by the sea. It was originally held by the MacAskills (a sept of the MacLeods of Lewis), but passed to the MacLeods in the fourteenth century. The MacLeods managed to defend themselves against the MacDonald Lord of the Isles in 1395 and 1401, however the castle passed to the MacDonalds sometime during the fifteenth century.
*Duntulm Castle, near Uig, Skye was built on the site of an Iron Age stronghold and was once held by the MacLeods. In 1540 the castle was visited by James V of Scotland but in the seventeenth century it passed to the MacDonalds.
*Eilean Ghrudidh, Loch Maree, near Kinlochewe, in Wester Ross, is the site of a castle on an island, that was originally held by the MacBeaths in the thirteenth century, but was held by the MacLeods from about 1430 to 1513.
*Gunnery of MacLeod, near to Borve, on the Isle of Berneray, North Uist is the site of a castle once held by the MacLeods. Norman MacLeod of Berneray, who was the laird of the island, was born there. He was a famous scholar and fought at the Battle of Worcester in 1651.

==Clan heirlooms==
There are several notable heirlooms belonging to the chiefs of the clan and held at their seat of Dunvegan Castle. Possibly the best known is the Fairy Flag which has numerous traditions attributed its origins and supposed magical powers. It was said to have had the power, when unfurled, to save the clan on three separate occasions. Another heirloom is a wooden and silver ceremonial cup, known as the Dunvegan Cup, which was made in Ireland and dates back to 1493. The cup is thought to have passed into the possession of the Macleods sometime in the 16th or 17th century, during which time the Macleods sent aid to certain Irish chieftains in their warring against English-backed forces. Another heirloom is Sir Rory Mor&#x27;s Horn, named after the 15th chief of the clan. Clan tradition states that the male heir of the clan must quaff a drink from the horn in one go.

==Clan symbols==
Members of Clan Macleod are entitled to wear a crest badge to show their allegiance to their clan chief. Macleod of Lewis Dress Tartan Kilt is selected a range of some of the most popular Macleod of Lewis Tartans, As it is usually available in variations in which ancient and modern are most popular. This crest badge contains the heraldic crest and heraldic motto of the clan chief. These elements, like the chief&#x27;s coat of arms, are the heraldic property of the chief alone. The crest within the crest badge is blazoned &quot;a bull&#x27;s head cabossed sable, horned Or, between two flags gules, staved at the first&quot;; and the motto is &quot;hold fast&quot;. Members of Clan Macleod of The Lewes are entitled to wear a different crest badge, derived from the arms of the chief of that clan.

Members of Clan Macleod may also wear a sprig of juniper, as a clan badge. Clan badges are usually worn on a bonnet behind the crest badge, or attached at the shoulder of a lady&#x27;s tartan sash.

==Clan tartan==

The colors now belong to the scouts group St. Paschalis Baylon from Heemstede

==Clan chief==
==Clan septs==
Septs are clans or families who were under the protection of a more powerful clan or family. Scottish clans were largely collections of different families who held allegiance to a common chief. The following names, according to the Associated Clan MacLeod Societies, are attributed as septs of Clan Macleod (of Dunvegan and Harris); there are also a number of other septs attributed to Clan Macleod of The Lewes.

<text>Papilio troilus, the spicebush swallowtail or green-clouded butterfly, is a common black swallowtail butterfly found in North America. It has two subspecies, &quot;Papilio troilus troilus&quot; and &quot;Papilio troilus ilioneus&quot;, the latter found mainly in the Florida peninsula. The spicebush swallowtail derives its name from its most common host plant, the spicebush, members of the genus &quot;Lindera&quot;.

The family to which spicebush swallowtails belong, Papilionidae, or swallowtails, include the largest butterflies in the world. The swallowtails are unique in that even while feeding, they continue to flutter their wings. Unlike other swallowtail butterflies, spicebushes fly low to the ground instead of at great heights.

==Distribution and habitat==
The spicebush swallowtail is found only in the eastern US and southern Ontario, but occasionally strays as far as the American plains states, Cuba, Manitoba and Colorado. While still larvae, spicebush swallowtails remain on the leaf of the plant on which they were laid. As adults, the butterflies do not limit their flight geographically and instead are motivated mostly by availability of water and nectar and mates within the species&#x27; range.

This primarily black swallowtail is normally found in deciduous woods or woody swamps, where they can be found flying low and fast through shaded areas. Females tend to stay in open plains, while males are typically found in swamp areas.

===&quot;Papilio troilus troilus&quot;===
The more widespread subspecies of spicebush swallowtail is prevalent throughout the Eastern United States, from New England to Wisconsin, west to Illinois, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Nebraska. It also abounds in Texas and Colorado. Temperature may be a limiting factor for the spread of &quot;P. t. troilus&quot;, as in experimental conditions, they do not fare well at or above nor are they capable of flourishing at or below .

===&quot;Papilio troilus ilioneus&quot;===
The smaller subspecies of &quot;P. troilus&quot; is confined to the Southeastern coastal United States, namely throughout Florida and along coastal Georgia and in places in Texas.

==Description==

===&quot;P. t. troilus&quot;===
Typically, the wingspan of a spicebush swallowtail ranges from . Adults are primarily black/brown in color, with a trademark green-blue (male) or bright blue (female) splotch in the shape of a half moon on the hindwings. The forewing has a border of cream-colored, oval spots. In the middle portion of the wing, the spots can be moon shaped and a light blue in color. Both sexes have cream-yellow moon-shaped spots on the edges of the hindwings and a bright orange color spot at the base of the wings. In females, the orange spot at the base of the wings will turn a greenish-white shade in summer, but not the spring.

On the underside of the hindwing, there will be a dual row of orange spots, which distinguishes it from the pipevine swallowtail, which only has a single row of spots. In between these rows, there is more blue or green coloring. Characteristically, the median (inner) orange spots are discontinuous, allowing the blue or green coloring to spread medially.

===&quot;P. t. ilioneus&quot;===
The distinguishing difference in color between the two subspecies is evident where the spots, which are blue in color on the hindwing of the &quot;P. t. troilus,&quot; are more yellow in color in &quot;P. t. ilioneus&quot;. Additionally, splashes of blue can trail all the way down the tail of &quot;P. t. ilioneus&quot;.

==Ecology==
The host plants of the spicebush swallowtail are most commonly either spicebush (&quot;Lindera benzoin&quot;) or white sassafras (&quot;Sassafras albidum&quot;). Other possible host plants include prickly ash (&quot;Zanthoxylum&quot;), as well as tulip tree (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;), sweetbay (&quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot;), camphor (&quot;Cinnamomum camphora&quot;) and redbay (&quot;Persea borbonia&quot;). Redbay and swampbay (&quot;Persea palustris&quot;) are the primary host plants for members of the &quot;P. t. ilioneus&quot; strain, while spicebush and sassafras as the primary hosts for &quot;P. t. troilus&quot;. However, when given the choice between spicebush and sassafras, the &quot;P. t. troilus&quot; showed no significant preference for either.

Additionally, &quot;P. t. ilioneus&quot; live only on redbay because that is the primary host plant within the Southern range. However, in a test of &quot;P. t. troilus&quot; and &quot;P. t. ilioneus&quot; on redbay, sassafras and spicebush, although the &quot;P. t. ilioneus&quot; had higher growth and survival rates on redbay than the &quot;P. t. troilus&quot;, as a holistic group, both subspecies performed better on sassafras or spicebush over time.

In general, spicebush swallowtails tend to stick to plants that are members of the family Lauraceae. The preference for Lauraceae is so consistent among spicebush swallowtails that under experimental conditions, when placed in an environment with leaves other than Lauraceae, &quot;P. troilus&quot; died without eating anything. This fact is especially noteworthy because Lauraceae are distantly related to the host plants of other species that are food for &quot;Papilio&quot; caterpillars. The fact that spicebush swallowtails live and feed primarily on Lauraceae only is noteworthy also because most other varieties of swallowtail butterflies are nowhere near as specific. Part of the reason for the selective nature of &quot;P. troilus&quot; and host plants may have to do with the requirement of positive stimuli to confirm that a plant is Lauraceae among &quot;P. troilus&quot; before they will feed on it, while &quot;P. glaucus&quot;, for example, will at once try to feed on any plant presented to it.

The insistence on feeding primarily on Lauraceae has its advantages for spicebush swallowtails. They are able to feed two to four times more adeptly and efficiently on Lauraceae than &quot;P. glaucus&quot; on the same plant, for example, who feed on Lauraceae as well as other types of plants. In addition, there has not been any other Lepidoptera species which feeds as efficiently as the &quot;P. troilus&quot; on spicebush.
However, none of the host plants of &quot;Papilio troilus&quot; occur throughout the full range of the spicebush swallowtail. As stated above, the &quot;P. t. ilioneus&quot; strain, found in Florida, mostly feeds on redbay, while &quot;P. t. troilus&quot; feeds on either sassafras or spicebush. In a study, it was found that those spicebush swallowtails that normally feed on redbay did not grow as well on spicebush or sassafras during the first instar of development, while all insects studied grew better throughout the larval period on sassafras or spicebush. In addition, the &quot;P. t. ilioneus&quot; strain was typically larger in size than the &quot;P. t. troilus&quot;.

In a recent study, 3-&quot;trans&quot;-caffeoyl-muco-quinic acid was found to be the substance that compelled spicebush swallowtails to lay their eggs on members of Lauraceae. However, 3-&quot;trans&quot;-caffeoyl-muco-quinic acid is a component of the extract from sassafras plants but not from spicebush, redbay or camphor tree, the other top three host plants of spicebush swallowtails. This substance is not necessarily itself the stimulant but instead activates another as yet unknown compound that thus compels the spicebush swallowtail to lay eggs. Thus, this substance may hold the link for why some spicebush swallowtails prefer to lay eggs on sassafras rather than spicebush. In addition, 3-&quot;trans&quot;-caffeoyl-muco-quinic acid is a member of a family of acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, which are present in oviposition stimulants for some members of all five families of swallowtail butterflies. Hydroxycinnamic acids are also present in the extracts from host plants for two other species within the genus &quot;Papilio&quot;: the black swallowtail butterfly, &quot;P. polyxenes&quot;, and &quot;P. protenor&quot;. Thus, hydroxycinnamic acids may help explain why many types of swallowtails choose to oviposit on the plants that they choose.

===Food sources===
Spicebush swallowtails gain sustenance from eight major sources. Joe-Pye weed, jewelweed, and honeysuckle are favorite sources of nectar for the adults. They have also been known to drink nectar from lantanas, as well as thistles, milkweeds, azalea, dogbane, mimosa, and sweet pepperbush.

==Life cycle==

When female swallowtails decide which leaf to oviposit on, they frequently will drum their forelegs toward a leaf to identify it. Their forelegs have chemoreceptors located in the foretarsi that assess the chemical makeup of the leaf and use that information to decide if it is an acceptable spot. In general, females have shorter and denser sensilla on their forelegs than males, which may be a result of their having to sustain frequent heavy strokes.

The eggs of the spicebush swallowtail are greenish white in color, are fairly large and are laid one or two at a time on a spicebush leaf. Once hatched, the young larvae chew through the leaf from the edge to the midrib, about from the tip of the leaf. The larva lies on the midrib and exudes silk. Upon drying, the silk contracts and causes the leaf to fold up around the larva to form a shelter. At first, young larvae are brownish. The brown color of the larvae is independent of leaf color and will occur even on a green leaf. A folded leaf serves as the home for the young larvae. During the day, the larvae remain in the shelter so as to avoid predators and come out at night to feed. Additionally, if larvae are disturbed while rolled up in the leaf, they emit a foul-smelling substance.

When these larvae reach later stages, they turn greenish yellow before pupating. Older larvae live in a leaf, rolled up and lined with silk and held together by a line of silk. In order to pupate, the larvae will leave the shelter and find the underside of a leaf near the ground to do so. Upon discovery of a suitable leaf, the larvae begin the pupating process by emitting silk from their salivary glands, which helps attach the larvae to the branch or leaf. Then the larvae turn around while still emitting silk, which creates a &quot;safety harness&quot; for the pupating process. At the end of the pupating process, the larvae have become pupae which are either brown (winter) or green (summer).

The practice of turning either brown in winter or green in summer is called seasonal polyphenism. Because the color of the pupa reflects the color of the deciduous host plants, since the leaves will turn brown in winter and green in summer. Even in cases where the leaves are not yet brown, the pupa appear to turn that color in anticipation of the changing colors.

Roughly three generations of spicebush swallowtails occur each year. Most develop into adults throughout the range between the months of February and November. The entire development process from egg to adult takes about a month. Once they have reached the adult stage, &quot;Papilio troilus&quot; can live anywhere from two days to two weeks dependent on resource availability and predator avoidance.

==Feeding behavior==

Spicebush swallowtails (along with &quot;P. palamedes&quot;) are able to thermoregulate their thoraxes better than other &quot;Papilio&quot; species, perhaps due to their darker body and wing color. This allows them to fly and feed at lower temperatures than their counterparts.

==Social behavior==

Spicebush swallowtails often engage in &quot;puddling&quot;, a type of behavior which occurs while adults are flying in search of food or mates. Puddling reflects the fact that while engaging in either feeding or mating behavior, i.e. when they are away from home, spicebush swallowtails tend to stay in groups. These groupings are typically located on the banks of water, such as sandy or moist ridges. When puddling in these groups, the &quot;Papilio troilus&quot; will extract moisture from the soil or sand near the water.

==Mating behavior==
In general, both sexes will copulate with several mates during mating season. However, each time a female mates, she becomes less likely to mate again.

One key known form of communication among spicebush swallowtails occurs during mating. Visual cues are important for males to find females, and courtship displays can be elaborate. While these courtship displays occur, the female and male are often in contact, which is likely a way for them to relay information to one another. Additionally, the male butterfly will typically emit pheromones around the female butterfly and the female will use his scent to make her decision about mating.

Females can often be found outside the treeline, in areas of direct sun. This may be due to the fact that these areas are in direct sunlight, which allows for higher thoracic temperatures. Males are less concerned with direct sunlight during mating because their thoracic temperature rises while performing vigorous courtship dances. Males may perform these courtship dances both to females perched on host plants as well as those flying freely.

==Parental care==

Once eggs are laid, formal parental care ceases among spicebush swallowtails. Larvae do have a nutrient-rich egg, which keeps them well fed during the developmental period. Also, as noted above, females are very particular about host plant choice that aids in the success of egg development.

==Predators and avoidance==

===Predators===
When threatened, a spicebush swallowtail butterfly exudes red drops of a foul-smelling liquid. Its many predators include birds, spiders, robber flies, and dragonflies. All of these creatures will try to eat both adult spicebush swallowtail butterflies and youthful larvae.

===Mimicry===
The spicebush swallowtail&#x27;s major form of predator avoidance is through mimicry. Both subspecies and sexes of &quot;Papilio troilus&quot; have the ability to perform mimicry both as a larva and as an adult.

===Larval mimicry===
As larvae, spicebush swallowtails have two stages of mimicry. While the larvae are in the early stages, they are dark brown and thus appear to resemble bird droppings, which encourages predators to leave them alone. When the larvae have progressed to their fourth and last instar and are nearly ready to pupate, they turn a yellow-green color and are marked by two large black dots with a white highlight. The placement of these dots on the swollen thorax creates the illusion that the caterpillars are common green snakes. Mimicking snakes help the caterpillars to ward off predators, specifically birds. The caterpillar spicebush swallowtails enhance the physical resemblance behaviorally, as they have been observed to &quot;rear up and retract the actual caterpillar head.&quot;

The osmeterium of the caterpillar also helps to enhance the resemblance to a snake. When attacked, the larvae will expose the osmeterium, a Y-shaped organ typically folded up within the caterpillar. For many spicebush swallowtails, the osmeterium is red, thus creating the illusion of a snake tongue and even further enhancing the disguise.

===Adult mimicry===
Adult spicebush swallowtails practice another type of mimicry, as they resemble the pipevine swallowtail (&quot;Battus philenor&quot;), a foul-tasting butterfly. Each of the sexes are able to exhibit mimicry of &quot;B. philenor&quot; successfully, even though the brighter-blue color on female wings is a little more vibrant than the pipevine swallowtail&#x27;s coloring. As they themselves are not unpalatable and the pipevine are, this is an example of Batesian mimicry. If predators know that the pipevine swallowtail has a foul taste, they are unlikely to eat it and also unlikely to eat the spicebush swallowtail. There are other adult butterflies which mimic the poisonous &quot;B. philenor&quot;, including &quot;P. polyxenes&quot;, &quot;P. glaucus, C. promethea&quot; and &quot;L. astyanax&quot;, but &quot;P. troilus&quot; most closely resembles it. However, &quot;P. troilus&quot; has a greater physical resemblance to the other mimics than it does to &quot;B. philenor&quot;.

Besides mimicry, another form of predator avoidance for spicebush swallowtails is the &quot;club-like extensions from their hind-wings.&quot; An attack from a predator focused on the &quot;false head&quot; will leave the butterfly itself unharmed, though with slightly damaged wings.

<text>Dunvegan Castle (Caisteal Dhùn Bheagain) is located to the north of Dunvegan on the Isle of Skye, off the west coast of Scotland. It is the seat of the MacLeod of MacLeod, chief of the Clan MacLeod. Probably a fortified site from the earliest times, the castle was first built in the 13th century and developed piecemeal over the centuries. In the 19th century the whole castle was remodelled in a mock-medieval style. The castle is built on an elevated rock overlooking an inlet on the eastern shore of Loch Dunvegan, a sea loch.

==History==
The promontory was enclosed by a curtain wall in the 13th century, and a four-storey tower house was built in the late 14th century. This tower was similar in style to contemporary structures at Kisimul Castle and Caisteal Maol. Alasdair Crotach, the 8th chief, added the Fairy Tower as a separate building around 1500. During the 17th century, new ranges of buildings were put up between the old tower and the Fairy Tower, beginning in 1623 with the state apartment built by Ruairidh Mòr. The old tower was subsequently abandoned until the late 18th century, when the 23rd chief began the process of homogenising the appearance of the castle. This process continued under the 24th and 25th chiefs, with the addition of mock battlements and the new approach over a drawbridge from the east. The present appearance of the castle dates from around 1840 when this process of &quot;baronialisation&quot; was completed. The castle is a Category A listed building.

==Site==
Dunvegan Castle occupies the summit of a rock some above sea level, which projects on to the eastern shore of a north-facing inlet or bay. On the eastern, landward side of the site is a partly natural ditch around deep.

==Artifacts==
Notable family heirlooms kept at Dunvegan Castle include:
*Dunvegan Cup
*Fairy Flag
*Sir Rory Mor&#x27;s Horn

== Literature ==
The Mystery at Dunvegan Castle a novel by T.L. Huchu is set Dunvegan Castle and the Fairy Flag features in the plot.

<text>Carbisdale Castle was built in 1907 for the Duchess of Sutherland on a hill across the Kyle of Sutherland from Invershin in the Scottish Highlands. Until 2011 it was used as a youth hostel, operated by the Scottish Youth Hostels Association. The castle is situated north of Culrain, and around north-west of Bonar Bridge. It lies within the civil parish of Kincardine and Community council of Ardgay and District.

The castle is in the Scottish Baronial style, it has 365 windows, is and is protected as a category B listed building. The hostel closed for repair in 2011, and was put up for sale in 2014. Until its closure, the castle had a large collection of art, with some pieces dating back to 1680, as well as Italian marble statues. It was purchased in 2016 but offered for sale again in 2021; in 2022 it was again sold and is now a private residence.

==History==

The castle was built between 1905 and 1917 for Mary Caroline, Duchess of Sutherland, the second wife of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 3rd Duke of Sutherland, whom she married in 1889. She is better known as &quot;Duchess Blair&quot; because of her first marriage to Captain Arthur Kindersley Blair of the 71st Highland Light Infantry, who died in a hunting accident in 1883 near Pitlochry. The marriage was not well-liked in the Sutherland family. When the Duke died in 1892 his will, in favour of the Duchess, was contested by his son and heir Cromartie. In a court process that followed, the Duchess was found guilty of destroying documents and was imprisoned for six weeks in Holloway Prison.

Eventually, the Sutherland family came to an agreement giving Duchess Blair a substantial financial settlement. Furthermore, the family agreed to build a castle for the Duchess, as long as it was outside of the Sutherland lands. The Duchess employed a firm of Ayrshire builders and the castle was built between 1906 and 1917 just outside the Sutherland lands in Ross-shire. It was located on a hillside to be visible to a large part of Sutherland, especially the main road and rail line which the Sutherland family would have to use to travel south. Thus it became known as the &quot;Castle of Spite&quot; as it was widely considered that the Duchess located the castle there to spite her husband&#x27;s family and the settlement agreement. The castle&#x27;s tower only has clock faces on three of its four sides; the side facing Sutherland is blank, supposedly because the Duchess did not wish to give her former relatives the time of day.

Colonel Theodore Salvesen, a wealthy Scottish businessman of Norwegian extraction, bought the castle in 1933. He made it available as a refuge for King Haakon VII of Norway and Crown Prince Olav, who would later become King Olav V, during the Nazi occupation of Norway in World War II. During that time the castle was also used to hold important meetings; at the Carbisdale Conference on 22 June 1941 it was agreed that should Russian forces enter Norwegian territory, they would not stay there after the war. On 25 October 1944, the Red Army entered Norway and captured thirty towns, but the Russian forces later withdrew under the terms of the agreement. After the Colonel died his son, Captain Harold Salvesen, inherited the castle and gave its contents and estate to the Scottish Youth Hostels Association. Carbisdale Castle Youth Hostel opened to members on 2 June 1945.

Following frost damage, the hostel closed for repairs in February 2011. Further structural damage was discovered during repair work. Because of the cost of completing the repairs, the SYHA advertised the castle for sale in 2014, for £1.2 million. In addition they auctioned 17 marble sculptures and 36 paintings in May 2015, raising a further £1 million. In September 2016, the castle was purchased by FCFM Group Ltd, who planned to make it &quot;a world-class private residence&quot;.

The castle was put up for sale again in April 2021, priced at £1.5 million. It was sold in October 2022 to the barrister Samantha Kane and has since undergone restoration. Kane, now known as Lady Carbisdale, uses the castle as her residence but intends to partially open it to the public.

In 2024, it was again offered for sale, this time for £5,000,000.

<doc id="503796" wikidata="Q5630477" url="?curid=503796" title="HMAS Mildura">
<text>HMAS &quot;Mildura&quot; (J207/M207), named for the city of Mildura, Victoria, was one of 60 s constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The ship was laid down by Morts Dock &amp; Engineering Co in 1940 and commissioned into the RAN in 1941.

&quot;Mildura&quot;″s initial deployments were on the east coast of Australia as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol vessel. At the start of 1944, she escorted vessels between Townsville, Queensland and New Guinea. Late 1944 saw the ship relocated to Fremantle, Western Australia as a local patrol ship. After a refit at the start of 1945, &quot;Mildura&quot; was based at Morotai, and operated throughout the Dutch East Indies until August, when the corvette was sent to clear Hong Kong waters of mines. During September and October, the mine warfare area increased to include Chinese waters. In late October, &quot;Mildura&quot; returned to Sydney for refitting, then spent the next two years clearing mines around Australia, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.

The corvette was paid off in 1948, but was recommissioned in 1951 to serve as a training vessel for National Service trainees. &quot;Mildura&quot; was decommissioned again in 1953, then was towed to Brisbane for use as a training hulk for local reservists. The ship was sold for scrap in 1965.

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to be fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Mildura&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

As constructed, &quot;Mildura&quot; displaced 650 tons, with a length of , a beam of , and a draught of . the propulsion system consisted of a single triple expansion steam engine, which supplied to two propeller shafts. Maximum speed was . Main armament for the corvette consisted of one 4-inch high-angle gun, supplemented by three 20 mm Oerlikon cannons (one of which was later replaced by a 40 mm Bofors gun), plus machine guns. Depth charge chutes and throwers were also fitted. The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 85 personnel.

&quot;Mildura&quot; was laid down by Morts Dock &amp; Engineering Co in Sydney on 23 September 1940. She was launched on 15 March 1941 by the wife of Commodore John Walter Durnford, the Second Naval Member of the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board, and commissioned on 23 July 1941.

==Operational history==
&quot;Mildura&quot; was initially assigned to the 20th Minesweeping Flotilla until its disbandment in late 1941. The ship then operated independently on minesweeping, convoy escort, and anti-submarine patrols throughout Australian and South Pacific waters. In September 1942, &quot;Mildura&quot; was reassigned as a dedicated escort vessel for merchant convoys on the eastern Australian coast. In January 1943, the corvette recovered and towed the American merchant ship after the latter was torpedoed off Sydney. On 8 February, was torpedoed while part of a convoy escorted by &quot;Mildura&quot;. In January 1944, &quot;Mildura&quot; was reassigned to patrol duties in Queensland waters, with regular detachments to escort convoys between Townsville and New Guinea. This continued until August 1944, when the corvette was relocated to Western Australia and assigned to patrols of the vicinity around Fremantle.

At the start of 1945, &quot;Mildura&quot; was refitted, then in March assigned to Morotai. The ship&#x27;s main roles were to patrol the vicinity of the island, and to shepherd convoys between Morotai and Biak. On 22 June, the ship was sent to Borneo to provide nighttime patrols of Tarakan Harbour&#x27;s approaches. She was reassigned back to Morotai at the end of June. During the return voyage, the ship diverted after spotting a crashed PBY Catalina on Makheli Island. A group of natives reported that the aircrew had been rescued by another aircraft, but requested that they themselves be evacuated because they had come to the attention of the Japanese. The six natives were transported to Morotai.

After spending July based in Morotai, followed by two weeks as guardship at Balikpapan, &quot;Mildura&quot; met seven other &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes at Subic Bay, then proceeded as a group to sweep Hong Kong waters of mines from 30 August. Other duties the corvette was involved in during the Japanese surrender of Hong Kong included patrols, the pursuit and seizure of small craft, and overseeing the transfer of the Hong Kong brewery from Japanese to Allied hands. In mid-September, the Hong Kong minesweeping force was rolled into the 21st Minesweeping Flotilla, which was tasked with clearing Chinese waters of mines. This continued until 17 October, and on 20 October, &quot;Mildura&quot; departed Hong Kong for Sydney. She arrived on 19 November and was docked for refit until February 1946. &quot;Mildura&quot; joined the 20th Minesweeping Flotilla in clearing mines around Australia, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands until October 1947. The corvette received two battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Pacific 1941–45&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;.

&quot;Mildura&quot; was paid off to reserve at Fremantle, Western Australia on 21 May 1948 but was recommissioned on 20 February 1951 for use as a training ship for National Service trainees. She continued in this role until 1953.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Mildura&quot; paid off again at Melbourne on 11 September 1953. The ship was towed to Brisbane by in December, and on arrival was designated as a training hulk for reservists. The ship was sold for scrap to Brisbane Non-Ferrous on 8 September 1965.

<text>The Dassault Étendard II was a French prototype fighter aircraft initially developed as a follow-on project to the Dassault Mystère series. It was presented to the French Air Force for evaluation but was rejected in favour of the Dassault Mirage III.

Originally designated Mystère XXII, the aircraft was developed in response to a French Air Force requirement for a light, jet-powered fighter-bomber. At around the same time, the NATO NBMR-1 requirement was circulated, also calling for a light strike-fighter, and Dassault developed a very similar aircraft in parallel for that competition (the Étendard VI).

The sole prototype of the Étendard II flew on July 23, 1956 but proved to be somewhat underpowered and showed nothing like the promise of the Mirage series and was quickly abandoned.

A further development of the Étendard concept, the Étendard IV was successfully developed for French Navy service.

<text>The Indian pitta (Pitta brachyura) is a passerine bird native to the Indian subcontinent. It inhabits scrub jungle, deciduous and dense evergreen forest. It breeds in the forests of the Himalayas, hills of central and western India, and migrates to other parts of the peninsula in winter. Although very colourful, it is usually shy and hidden in the undergrowth where it picks insects on the forest floor. It has a distinctive two note whistling call which is heard at dawn and dusk. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List as the population is considered large.

==Taxonomy==
The Indian pitta was first known in England after an illustration by an Indian artist was sent by Edward Bulkley to James Petiver and given the name of &quot;Ponnunky pitta&quot;. This illustration was included by William Derham at the end of John Ray&#x27;s posthumous &quot;Synopsis methodica avium&quot; which was published in 1713. The bird was again described and illustrated by Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 and George Edwards in 1764. The Latin names coined by Brisson do not conform to the binomial nomenclature and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition he included the Indian pitta, cited the earlier publications and coined the binomial name &quot;Corvus brachyura&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type location as &quot;Moluccis&quot; and &quot;Zeylona&quot;. The Maluku Islands is an error as the Indian pitta does not occur there. The generic name &quot;Pitta&quot; was proposed by Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816 for birds with a short tail, a straight pointed beak and long wing feathers.
It is a monotypic species.

===Etymology===
The word &#x27;pitta&#x27; is derived from the Telugu language meaning &#x27;small bird&#x27;. The specific name &quot;brachyura&quot; is a combination of the classical Greek words &quot;βραχυς brakhus&quot; &#x27;short&#x27; and &quot;-ουρος -ouros&quot; &#x27;-tailed&#x27;.

Local names in India are based on the colours and behaviours like the time of calling and these include Hindi: &quot;Naorang&quot;, Punjabi: &quot;Nauranga&quot; (=Nine colours), Bengali: &quot;Shumcha&quot;, Cachar: &quot;Dao bui yegashi&quot;, Gujarati: &quot;Navaranga&quot; or &quot;Hariyo&quot;; Tamil: &quot;Kaachul&quot;, &quot;Aru-mani kuruvi&quot; (=6-O&#x27;Clock bird), &quot;Kathelachi&quot;, &quot;Thotta kallan&quot;; Telugu: &quot;Polanki pitta&quot;, &quot;Ponnangi pitta&quot;; Malayalam: &quot;Kavi&quot;; Kannada: &quot;Navaranga&quot; and Sinhala: . The Sinhala interpretation of its call is that the bird is complaining about the theft of its dress by a peacock: ,which translates as: &quot;Came and went! Came and went! I&#x27;ll still be complaining when the next Buddha comes! I&#x27;ll still be complaining!&quot;

==Description==

The Indian pitta is a small stubby-tailed bird that is mostly seen on the floor of forests or under dense undergrowth, foraging on insects in leaf litter. It has long, strong legs, a very short tail and stout bill, with a buff-coloured crown stripe, black coronal stripes, a thick black eye stripe and white throat and neck. The upper parts are green, with a blue tail, the underparts buff, with bright red on the lower belly and vent. The bird hops on the ground to forage and has been known to get trapped in ground traps meant for small mammals. It has been suggested that the width of the coronal stripe may differ between the sexes.

It is more often heard than seen and has a distinctive loud two-note whistle &quot;wheeet-tieu&quot; or &quot;wieet-pyou&quot; or sometimes, a triple note &quot;hh-wit-wiyu&quot;. They also have a single note-mewing call. They have a habit of calling once or twice, often with neighbouring individuals joining in, at dawn or dusk leading to their common name of &quot;Six-O-Clock&quot; bird in Tamil. When calling the head is thrown back and the bill is pointed upwards.

Pittas are among the few Old World suboscine birds. The Indian pitta is the basal member of a distinct clade that includes many of the Oriental species. It forms a superspecies with the fairy pitta (&quot;P. nympha&quot;), mangrove pitta (&quot;P. megarhyncha&quot;) and blue-winged pitta (&quot;P. moluccensis&quot;).

==Distribution and habitat==
The Indian pitta breeds mainly in the Himalayan foothills from the Margalla hills in northern Pakistan to Nepal and possibly up to Sikkim in the east, and in the hills of central India and in the Western Ghats south to Karnataka. It migrates to all parts of peninsular India and Sri Lanka in winter. Exhausted birds sometimes turn up in human settlements. It is rare in the Thar Desert.

==Ecology and behaviour ==
Indian pittas roost in trees.
They feed on insects and other small invertebrates that they usually pick up from the ground or leaf litter. They have also been noted to take kitchen food scraps from the ground.

They breed during the south-west monsoon from June to August, with peaks in June in central India, and in July in northern India. The nest is a globular structure with a circular opening on one side built on the ground or on low branches. It is made up of dry leaves and grasses. The clutch is four to five eggs which are very glossy white and spherical with spots and speckles of deep maroon or purple.

Avian malaria parasites have been noted in the species. Five out of thirteen birds in an ectoparasite survey were found to have the tick, &quot;Haemaphysalis spinigera&quot;.

Their seasonal movements associated with the rains have not been well studied.

<text>Computer Interface to Message Distribution (CIMD) is a proprietary short message service centre protocol developed by Nokia for their SMSC (now: Nokia Networks).

==Syntax==

An example CIMD exchange looks like the following:

 &lt;STX&gt;03:007&lt;TAB&gt;021:12345678&lt;TAB&gt;033:hello&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; 
 &lt;STX&gt;53:007&lt;TAB&gt;021:12345678&lt;TAB&gt;060:971107131212&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;

Each packet starts with STX (hex 02) and ends with ETX (hex 03). The content of the packet consists of fields separated by TAB (hex 09). Each field, in turn, consists of a &quot;parameter type&quot;, a colon (:), and the &quot;parameter value&quot;. Note that the last field must also be terminated with a TAB before the ETX.

Two-digit parameter types are &quot;operation codes&quot; and each message must have exactly one. The number after the operation code is the &quot;sequence number&quot; used to match an operation to its response. The response code (acknowledgement) of the message is equal to the operation code plus 50.

In the example above, the operation code 03 means submit message. Field 021 defines the destination address (telephone number), with field 033 is the user data (content) of the message. Response code 53 with a field 060 time stamp indicates that the message was accepted; if the message failed, the SMSC would reply with field 900 (error code) instead.
A good amount of supporting software to implement CIMD is available from
Nokia&#x27;s Website to build CIMD client. You can fire SMS from message center with the help of CIMD client tools.

<doc id="503818" wikidata="Q1073673" url="?curid=503818" title="Maybach 57 and 62">
<text>The Maybach 57 (chassis code W240) and 62 (chassis code V240) were the first automobile models of the Maybach brand since its revival by DaimlerChrysler AG (now Mercedes-Benz Group AG). They are derived from the Mercedes-Benz Maybach concept car presented at the 1997 Tokyo Motor Show. The concept car was based on the Mercedes-Benz W140 S-class sedan platform, as were the production models. The Luxury Brand Status Index 2008 placed the Maybach in first place, ahead of Rolls-Royce and Bentley. The models ceased production in February 2013 due to continued financial losses for the brand, with sales at one-fifth the level of the profitable Rolls-Royce models.

== History ==
Wilhelm Maybach was an engineer who worked with Gottlieb Daimler to design combustion engines. The first Daimler-Maybach automobile was built in 1889. Over the years, the Maybach name developed into a brand name for automobiles that were typically very large, powerful, and luxurious. For example, the Maybach Zeppelin DS 8 Cabriolet built in 1929 had side sections that could be lowered completely to allow it to be used as a parade car. In 1998, DaimlerChrysler AG&#x27;s competitor, BMW AG, purchased the ultra-luxury brand Rolls-Royce. The Maybach brand name was reintroduced in 2002 to be a direct challenger to BMW&#x27;s top vehicle, the Rolls-Royce Phantom.

== Design ==
Both Maybach models are variants of the same ultra-luxurious automobile. The model numbers reflect the respective lengths of the automobiles in decimetres. The 57 is more likely to be owner-driven, while the longer 62 is designed with a chauffeur in mind.

=== Features ===
Standard features of all models include, but are not limited to: a navigation system with voice recognition; power rear sunshade; rear-seat DVD entertainment system; interior air filter; front and rear seat massage; 21-speaker Bose premium sound system; power tilt/telescopic heated leather-wrapped-wood steering wheel with radio and climate controls; power trunk open/close; voice-activated AM/FM radio with 6-disc CD changer; keyless start; heated front and rear seats; cooled front seats; adaptive cruise control; premium leather upholstery; 18-way power front seats; 14-way power rear seats; heated cupholders; rear beverage refrigerator; rear pop-out folding table trays; rearview camera; pneumatic soft close doors; iPod adapter; wireless cell phone link; outside-temperature indicator; universal garage door opener.
Every Maybach has 2 climate control systems – one for the front compartment and one for the rear. Each can be programmed and operated independently, producing four-zone climate control.

An upgraded version of the Mercedes air suspension system called AirMatic Dual Control is standard, featuring air springs complemented by an additional spring-rate adjustment system with adaptive damping.

Options for the Maybach 62 and 62S include: 18-way power rear seats (replacing 14-way); power side sunshades; cooled rear seats; wireless headphones; electrochromic power panoramic sunroof (replacing power sunroof); steering wheel mounted navigation controls.

The company offered various options for customers to personalize their vehicles, and provided various equipment combinations.
=== Performance ===
The engine in the base Model 57 and 62 is the Mercedes-Benz M285, a 5.5-litre twin-turbo V12 developed specifically for the new Maybach cars. Output is at 5250 rpm with of torque at 2300-3000 rpm. A slightly de-tuned version, denoted M275, was used in the 2003-2006 W220 S600 and CL600 replacing the M137, naturally-aspirated V12, which appears in the 1998-2002 W220 S600 and CL600.

The Maybach 57 accelerates from in about 5.1 seconds; the Maybach 62 and 57 S, about 4.8 seconds; the Maybach 62 S, 4.5 seconds, and the Landaulet, 4.5 seconds. In terms of power output, the 57 and 62 have ; the 57 S and 62 S, ; and the Zeppelin has .

=== Price ===
As of early 2008, European and United States prices were:

* Maybach 57 - $366,934 / €341,750
* Maybach 57 S - $417,402 / €381,250
* Maybach 62 - $431,055 / €392,750
* Maybach 62 S - $492,602 / €432,250
* Maybach Landaulet - $1,350,000 / €900,000

== Introduction ==
On 26 June 2002 a Maybach 62 enclosed in a glass case on the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; departed from Southampton, England, en route to New York City, with the media and company officials staying in the luxury suites on board. The ship arrived in New York on 2 July, welcomed by geysering fireboats and a motor boat. A helicopter lifted the car off the liner and onto a dock. It was then driven to the Regent Hotel, Wall Street.

== Variants ==

=== Maybach 57 ===
The Maybach 57 is the base designation. 1,104 units produced.

=== Maybach 57 S ===
Daimler revealed the Maybach 57 S at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show, with the S standing for &quot;Spezial&quot;. It uses a 6.0-liter version of the V12 engine manufactured by Mercedes-AMG. Power output is and torque , providing a sub-five second sprint to . It also rides lower on 20-inch wheels. The North American unveiling was at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2006. 503 of the pre-facelift and 164 of the 2010 facelifted version produced.

=== Maybach 57 and 62 &quot;Zeppelin&quot; ===

Maybach revealed the &quot;Zeppelin&quot; nameplate at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show as an additional luxury package that could be ordered on both the Maybach 57 and 62. The name &quot;Zeppelin&quot; had been used for the pre-war Maybach models DS7 and DS8. 100 units were built.

The package consists of special California beige leather with Stromboli-black stitching, piano black lacquer finishes, and silver &quot;Zeppelin&quot; champagne glasses. In addition to the interior changes, the exterior has exclusive 20-inch chrome wheels and dark-red taillights. The engine is the standard 6.0-L V12 Twin-Turbo with , which is more than the S versions. The word &quot;ZEPPELIN&quot; is also incorporated into the triangular Maybach hood ornament.
=== Maybach 62 ===
The Maybach 62 included as standard features such as fully reclining rear seats, Maybach four-zone climate control, tinted windows, infrared-reflecting laminated glass all round, AirMATIC dual-control air suspension, display instruments in rear roof liner (showing speed, time, and outside temperature), folding rear tables (left and right), 21-speaker BOSE Surround Everywhere sound system, and a refrigerator compartment. The Maybach 62 also includes an array of additional features such as Cockpit Management and Navigation System (COMAND), which includes DVD navigation, CD changer in rear seats, DVD players and TV tuners front and rear, two rear LCD TV screens including remote control and two sets of headphones, and automatic closing doors.

Even though the Maybach 62 has all these features included, optional extras were available. Some of these are a panoramic glass sunroof at a cost of $11,670, and an external communication system, and a loudspeaker and microphone system which allows the occupant in the rear of the Maybach to converse with people outside the car. This option came at a cost of $1,780. Additionally, a retractable electrotransparent partition screen between the driver and the rear occupants costs $23,780 and, most expensive, a high-protection GUARD B4 Package costs an additional $151,810. 1,058 units made in total.
=== Maybach 62 S ===

The Maybach 62 S (&quot;Spezial&quot;) appeared in November 2006 at the Auto China 2006 exhibit in Beijing. It features the same engine as the 57 S, a twin-turbo V12 made by Mercedes-Benz AMG. However, the suspension remains untouched. 236 of the original and 256 units of the model year 2010 (post-facelift) were made.

On February 26, 2019, North Korean&#x27;s chairman Kim Jong-un came to visit Vietnam along with his cars, including a Maybach 62 S and a Mercedes S600 Pullman Guard.
=== Maybach 62 S Landaulet ===
The Maybach 62 S Landaulet, based on the Maybach 62 S, revives the classic landaulet car body style, which was popular in the 1920s and 30s. Powered by the 62 S&#x27;s biturbo V12, the Landaulet&#x27;s front seats are fully enclosed and separated from the rear passenger compartment by a power divider window; the opacity of this partition can be electronically controlled.

A sliding soft roof allows back-seat passengers to take in the sun from the comfort of their seats. The chauffeur&#x27;s area is finished in black leather, while the rear is white with piano black- and gold-flecked black granite inserts.

Maybach publicly unveiled the Landaulet at the Middle East International Auto Show around the end of November 2007 as a concept car. Limited production was confirmed in January 2008. In total, 22 units were made, one of which was owned by rapper Birdman. DJ Khaled owns one as well and it has appeared in a few of his music videos. Also, Lee Kun-hee, former chairman of Samsung owns one as of 2011. 

Only 18 units of the pre-facelift Maybach 62 S Landaulets were ever built, with a further four in a facelifted configuration. Ronald Bussink, a Swiss entrepreneur, placed an order for two facelifted Landaulets at the very end of production, in 2011, just when Daimler made the decision to cease production in the following year. Bussink had also changed one of those orders for a one-off RHD model. A special-request 62 S Landaulet &quot;One &amp; only RHD&quot; model was still being completed by a Maybach specialists in January 2013 on a single stand offside while the production line was being dismantled.
=== Maybach 57S Cruisero Coupé by Xenatec ===

In 2010, German coachbuilder Xenatec unveiled the Maybach 57S Cruisero, a 2-door conversion of the Maybach 57S. The Cruisero has the same length, wheelbase, and AMG V12 engine as the 57S it is based on, making it the longest 2-door that is not from 1970s. It is reported that the car was approved by Daimler and engineered to the same standard as other Maybachs. Only 8 cars were reportedly produced before Xenatec filed for bankruptcy. Cruisero car number 4 (as seen on the door sill), ordered new by Muammar Gaddafi, was listed for sale in early 2021 in the Netherlands.

== Sales ==
Initially, Daimler-Chrysler predicted annual sales of 2,000 global units with 50% coming from the United States; however, such lofty sales expectations never materialized. In 2007, Mercedes bought back 29 US dealers, reducing the total from 71 to 42.

== 2013 cessation ==
With poor sales expectations and heavy impact of 2008 financial crises, Daimler AG undertook a review of the whole Maybach division. This included talks with Aston Martin to engineer and style the next generation of Maybach models along with the next generation of Lagonda models.

However, on 25 November 2011, Daimler announced that sales of all Maybach models and the brand would cease in 2013. Before the announcement, only 3000 Maybach vehicles had been sold, with estimated loss of €330,000 for each car sold. While it was originally planned to produce it into mid-2013, very slow sales convinced Daimler to pull the plug earlier and the last car left the Sindelfingen production line on 17 December 2012. Other sources claim that production ceased in February 2013. A special 62 S Landaulet model was still being completed by January 2013 on a singular stand while the production line was being dismantled.

The line was replaced by Mercedes-Benz S-Class Pullman models. An executive told a Frankfurt newspaper that Daimler &quot;came to the conclusion that the sales chances for the Mercedes brand were better than that of Maybach.&quot;

One suggestion for Maybach&#x27;s struggles was that parent Daimler had failed to differentiate it from its Mercedes-Benz brand. While all three ultra-luxury brands share platforms and engines with other luxury brands from their parent auto company, Maybachs are built alongside the Mercedes-Benz S-Class flagship sedan, whereas Rolls-Royce and Bentley are assembled in England (separate from the rest of BMW and Volkswagen Group&#x27;s production plants), and thus are regarded as being more &quot;exclusive&quot;. Furthermore, the Maybach&#x27;s pedigree was virtually unknown outside Germany, unlike its British rivals which have long enjoyed renown worldwide; indeed the 2006 Rolls-Royce Phantom&#x27;s interior evokes memories of a 1930s car, while the Maybach 57S&#x27;s inside makes no reference to its brand&#x27;s history.

In October 2013, &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine placed the Maybach 57 and 62 on its list of &quot;The 13 worst cars of the last 20 years&quot;, commenting that &quot;Mercedes-Benz decided to reactivate a brand that nobody under the age of 90 outside Stuttgart remembered, slathering an ersatz reject Hyundai luxury body over an ageing S-Class platform and hoping that various oligarchs, rap stars and Paris Hilton wouldn&#x27;t notice that it was actually an elaborate con. They didn&#x27;t. But we did. The 57S version finally gave the hapless guy up front something to do other than stirring up revolutionary resentment towards his boss, but by the time the Landaulet appeared, the game was up, and Mercedes iced the brand in favour of six different versions of the new S-Class. Smart move. Rolls-Royce, meanwhile, is on course for a record year in 2013.&quot;
In 2009, a 2004 Maybach 62 in Germany reached 999,999 kilometres with its original owner.

<doc id="503825" wikidata="Q7868808" url="?curid=503825" title="USS Delaware (1776)">
<text>USS &quot;Delaware&quot; was a 24-gun sailing frigate of the United States Navy that had a short career in the American Revolutionary War as the British Royal Navy captured her in 1777. The Royal Navy took her in as an &quot;armed ship&quot;, and later classed her a sixth rate. The Royal Navy sold her in 1783. British owners named her &quot;United States&quot; and then French interests purchased her and named her &quot;Dauphin&quot;. She spent some years as a whaler and then in March 1795 she was converted at Charleston, South Carolina, to French privateer. Her subsequent fate is unclear.

==US Navy==
She was built under the 13 December 1775 order of the Continental Congress in the yard of Warwick Coates of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, under the direction of the Marine Committee. Upon her launching in July 1776, Captain C. Alexander took command.

&quot;Delaware&quot; served in the Delaware River, joining with Commodore John Hazelwood&#x27;s Pennsylvania state ships in operations that delayed the British Fleet in approaching Philadelphia and supplying the British Army. When the British took possession of Philadelphia 26 September 1777, &quot;Delaware&quot;, now under the command of John Barry, in company with several smaller ships, advanced upon the enemy fortifications which were being erected and opened a destructive fire while anchored some 500 yards from shore.

On 27 September she went aground on the and came under the concentrated fire of the British artillery. After a brave defense against overwhelming odds, Captain Alexander was compelled to strike his colors. &quot;Delaware&quot; was taken into the Royal Navy.

==Royal Navy==
The Royal Navy took her in as an &quot;armed ship&quot;, and later classed her a sixth rate. As an armed ship her captain was Commander James Watt. In April 1778 Commander Christopher Mason commissioned her.

On 1 December 1779 &quot;Delaware&quot; escorted a convoy of supply ships to Bermuda, and also brought some 100 officers and men of the Royal Garrison Battalion of Veterans to defend Bermuda. She and the troops arrived in time to forestall an American attack. When four American naval vessels arrived later that day they saw &quot;Delaware&quot; in place and British troops patrolling, and so left quickly.

On 6 June 1779 captured the American privateer &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;. &quot;Delaware&quot; and the privateer &quot;Union&quot; were in company and so shared in the prize money.

On 21 and 23 April 1780 &quot;Iris&quot;, &quot;Delaware&quot;, and captured the American privateers &quot;Amazon&quot;, &quot;General Wayne&quot;, and &quot;Neptune&quot;. The capture had taken place a few leagues from Sandy Hook and &quot;Iris&quot; and &quot;Delaware&quot; brought them into New York on 1 May.

==&quot;United States&quot;==
The Royal Navy sold &quot;Delaware&quot; on 14 April 1783 for £300 to Mary Hayley, who renamed her &quot;United States&quot;. She sailed from Falmouth to Boston in April 1784. Hayley had the boat fitted out as a whaler and seal hunting vessel, shipping to the Falkland Islands in late 1784. The ship returned in 1785 with a cargo of whale oil, which was seized by customs agents. After a trial, the Crown lost its case against Hayley for duty, as she was a British citizen, and was ordered to pay her £4,000 for her losses.

&quot;United States&quot; first appeared in &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Register&quot; (&quot;LR&quot;) in 1786 with J.Scott, master, Mrs Hayley, owner, and trade London–Boston. She had undergone a thorough repair in 1784. She was no longer listed in &quot;LR&quot; in 1787.

In the fall of 1786, Francis Rotch reported that Hayley had sold the &quot;United States&quot; to the firm Brothers DeBauque and that he had advised them to send the ship to the Falklands rather than Greenland.

==&quot;Dauphin&quot;==
&quot;United States&quot; may have operated under both that name, and under &quot;Dauphin&quot; for some years.

French records that show &quot;Dauphin&quot; in 1785 with Paul Coffin, master. She was described as a frigate of 695 tons. Her known ports of call included Lorient (1792), New Bedford (November 1792), then Brazil, Delagoa Bay, Saint-Laurent Bay, Île de France, and Nantucket in November 1793. She became American again in November 1793, and was in Dunkirk in 1794.

As &quot;United States&quot; she made a second voyage to the Falklands in 1786. A whaler by the name of &quot;United States&quot; arrived at Dunkirk in July 1787 from the Falklands.

Francis Rotch commissioned her in August 1787 under the name &quot;Dauphin&quot;.

French records indicate that under Captain Uriah Swain, &quot;Dauphin&quot;, Francis Rotch, agent, sailed to the coast of Brazil on 18 August 1787, and returned on 4 July 1788 with 1452 barrels of whale oil and 16,000 lbs of whalebone. She returned to Dover in 1788, selling her 25,000 gallons of whale oil duty free. The 13,000 seal skins she had collected were sold in China for ten times their New York value, confirming the lucrative nature of the China Trade. After this voyage, the vessel was sold in 1788 to the French South Sea whaling partnership.

In 1791 &quot;Dauphin&quot; was under the command of Jonathan Parker.

On 22 November 1792 &quot;Dauphin&quot; sailed for Brazil and Delagoa Bay under the command of Captain Stephen Gardner. At some point he left and Captain Lallermant replaced him. She returned in November 1793 with 1900 barrels of whale oil.

In May 1794 &quot;Dauphin&quot; arrived at Charleston, South Carolina. She was sold at auction on 23 June to Jean Bouteille who wished to convert her to a privateer. Despite efforts by Benjamin Moodie, the British Vice-consul in Charleston to block her conversion, in March 1795 she was ready and sailed for Port-de-Paix. Her ultimate fate is unknown.

<text>The Rhamnaceae are a large family of flowering plants, mostly trees, shrubs, and some vines, commonly called the buckthorn family. Rhamnaceae is included in the order Rosales.

The family contains about 55 genera and 950 species. The Rhamnaceae have a worldwide distribution, but are more common in the subtropical and tropical regions. The earliest fossil evidence of Rhamnaceae is from the Late Cretaceous. Fossil flowers have been collected from the Upper Cretaceous of Mexico and the Paleocene of Argentina.

Leaves of family Rhamnaceae members are simple, i.e., the leaf blades are not divided into smaller leaflets. Leaves can be either alternate or opposite. Stipules are present and modified into spines in many genera. In some (e.g. &quot;Paliurus spina-christi&quot; and &quot;Colletia paradoxa&quot;) spectacularly so. &quot;Colletia&quot; stands out by having two axillary buds instead of one, one developing into a thorn, the other one into a shoot.

The flowers are radially symmetrical. There are 5 (sometimes 4) separate sepals and 5 (sometimes 4 or none) separate petals. The petals may be white, yellowish, greenish, pink or blue, and are small and inconspicuous in most genera, though in some (e.g. &quot;Ceanothus&quot;) the dense clusters of flowers are conspicuous. The 5 or 4 stamens are opposite the petals. The ovary is mostly superior, with 2 or 3 ovules (or one by abortion).

The fruits are mostly berries, fleshy drupes, or nuts. Some are adapted to wind carriage, but most are dispersed by mammals and birds. Chinese jujube is the fruit of the jujube tree (&quot;Ziziphus jujuba&quot;) and is a major fruit in China.

The American genus &quot;Ceanothus&quot;, which has several showy ornamental species, has nitrogen-fixing root nodules.

Economic uses of the Rhamnaceae are chiefly as ornamental plants and as the source of many brilliant green and yellow dyes. The wood of &quot;Rhamnus&quot; was also the most favoured species to make charcoal for use in gunpowder before the development of modern propellants.

== Genera ==
==Systematics==
Modern molecular phylogenetics recommend the following clade-based classification of Rhamnaceae:

== Fossil record ==
The fossil record of the family extends back to the Late Cretaceous, with records from Colombia and Mexico. Remains from the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber of Myanmar have been suggested to belong to this family by some authors&quot;&quot;, but this has been doubted by others. The earliest fossils of modern genera of the family date to the Eocene.

<text>Effingham, a 32-gun frigate of the Continental Navy named after Thomas Howard, 3rd Earl of Effingham. She was built at Philadelphia in 1776 and 1777, and Captain John Barry was ordered to command her. When the British took possession of Philadelphia in September 1777, Barry was ordered to take the uncompleted ship up the Delaware River to a place of safety.

On 25 October general George Washington asked for the crew of &quot;Effingham&quot; for use in the fleet, and two days later the ship was ordered sunk or burned. &quot;Effingham&quot; was sunk on 2 November just below Bordentown, New Jersey, to deny her use to the British. She was burned to the water&#x27;s edge by a British raiding party on their way north from Philadelphia on 8 May 1778.

There was also an earlier galley named &quot;Effingham&quot; built in 1775 by the Pennsylvania Navy.

<text>The Dassault Étendard VI was a French prototype fighter aircraft initially developed as part of the NATO NBMR-1 competition to find a standard fighter to serve amongst member air forces. Dassault took advantage of the fact that the French Air Force had issued a requirement around the same time for a new fighter-bomber and developed aircraft in parallel as variations of the same design concept for the two prospective customers.

Originally designated Mystère XXVI, the aircraft was accepted as one of the entrants to be developed to prototype stage for a fly-off with competing designs. It fared well in test flights, but was out-performed by the Aeritalia G.91 that was eventually selected as the winner of the competition.

A further development of the Étendard concept, the Étendard IV was successfully developed for French Navy service.

<doc id="503839" wikidata="Q721407" url="?curid=503839" title="Semnopithecus">
<text>Semnopithecus is a genus of Old World monkeys native to the Indian subcontinent, with all species with the exception of two being commonly known as gray langurs. Traditionally only the species &quot;Semnopithecus entellus&quot; was recognized, but since about 2001 additional species have been recognized. The taxonomy has been in flux, but currently eight species are recognized.

Members of the genus &quot;Semnopithecus&quot; are terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to in the Himalayas.

==Characteristics==
These langurs are largely gray (some more yellowish), with a black face and ears. Externally, the various species mainly differ in the darkness of the hands and feet, the overall color and the presence or absence of a crest. Typically all north Indian gray langurs have their tail tips looping towards their head during a casual walk whereas all south Indian and Sri Lankan gray langurs have an inverted &quot;U&quot; shape or a &quot;S&quot; tail carriage pattern. There are also significant variations in the size depending on the sex, with the male always larger than the female. The head-and-body length is from . Their tails, at are always longer than their bodies. Langurs from the southern part of their range are smaller than those from the north. At , the heaviest langur ever recorded was a male Nepal gray langur. The larger gray langurs are rivals for the largest species of monkey found in Asia. The average weight of gray langurs is in the males and in the females.

Langurs mostly walk quadrupedally and spend half of their time on the ground and the other half in trees. They will also make bipedal hops, climbing and descending supports with the body upright, and leaps. Langurs can leap horizontally and in descending.

==Taxonomy==
Traditionally, only &quot;Semnopithecus entellus&quot; was recognized as a species, the remainder all being treated as subspecies. In 2001, it was proposed that seven species should be recognized. This was followed in &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; in 2005, though several of the seven species intergrade, and alternative treatments exist where only two species (a northern and a southern) are recognized. Phylogenetic evidence supports at least three species: a north Indian, a south Indian and a Sri Lankan one.

It has been suggested that the &quot;Semnopithecus priam thersites&quot; is worthy of treatment as a species rather than a subspecies, but at present this is based on limited evidence. During a study based on external morphology and ecological niche modelling in Peninsular India six main types were found, but continued to label all as subspecies. Coat color is highly variable, possible due to phenotypic plasticity and therefore of questionable value in species delimitation.

It has been suggested that &quot;Trachypithecus&quot; should be considered only a subgenus of &quot;Semnopithecus&quot;. If maintaining the two as separate monophyletic genera, the purple-faced langur and Nilgiri langur belong in &quot;Semnopithecus&quot; instead of their former genus &quot;Trachypithecus&quot;. At present it is unclear where the &quot;T. pileatus&quot; species group (consisting of the capped langur, Shortridge&#x27;s langur and Gee&#x27;s golden langur) belongs, as available mtDNA data place it in &quot;Semnopithecus&quot;, while Y chromosome data place it in &quot;Trachypithecus&quot;. A possible explanation for this is that the &quot;T. pileatus&quot; species group is the result of fairly recent hybridization between &quot;Semnopithecus&quot; and &quot;Trachypithecus&quot;.

As of 2005, the authors of &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; recognized the following seven &quot;Semnopithecus&quot; species
* Nepal gray langur &quot;Semnopithecus schistaceus&quot;
* Kashmir gray langur &quot;Semnopithecus ajax&quot;
* Tarai gray langur &quot;Semnopithecus hector&quot;
* Northern plains gray langur &quot;Semnopithecus entellus&quot;
* Black-footed gray langur &quot;Semnopithecus hypoleucos&quot;
* Southern plains gray langur &quot;Semnopithecus dussumieri&quot;
* Tufted gray langur &quot;Semnopithecus priam&quot;

Results of analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and two nuclear DNA-encoded genes of several colobine species revealed that Nilgiri and purple-faced langurs cluster with gray langur, while &quot;Trachypithecus&quot; species form a distinct clade. Since then, two other species have been moved from &quot;Trachypithecus&quot; to &quot;Semnopithecus&quot;:
* Purple-faced langur &quot;Semnopithecus vetulus&quot;
* Nilgiri langur &quot;Semnopithecus johnii&quot;

In addition, &quot;Semnopithecus dussumieri&quot; has been determined to be invalid. Most of the range that had been considered &quot;S. dussumieri&quot; is now considered &quot;S. entellus&quot;.

Thus the current generally accepted species within the genus &quot;Semnopithecus&quot; are:



A 2013 genetic study indicated that while &quot;S. entellus&quot;, &quot;S. hypoleucos&quot;, &quot;S. priam&quot; and &quot;S. johnii&quot; are all valid taxa, there has been hybridization between &quot;S. priam&quot; and &quot;S. johnii&quot;.
It also indicated that there has been some hybridization between &quot;S. entellus&quot; and &quot;S. hypoleucos&quot; where their ranges overlap, and a small amount of hybridization between &quot;S. hypoleucos&quot; and &quot;S. priam&quot;. It also suggested that &quot;S. priam&quot; and &quot;S. johnii&quot; diverged from each other fairly recently.

==Distribution and habitat==

The entire distribution of all gray langur species stretches from the Himalayas in the north to Sri Lanka in the south, and from Bangladesh in the east to Pakistan in the west. They possibly occur in Afghanistan. The bulk of the gray langur distribution is within India, and all seven currently recognized species have at least a part of their range in this country.

Gray langurs can adapt to a variety of habitats. They inhabit arid habitats like deserts, tropical habitats like tropical rainforests and temperate habitats like coniferous forests, deciduous habitats and mountains habitats. They are found at sea level to altitudes up to . They can adapt well to human settlements, and are found in villages, towns and areas with housing or agriculture. They live in densely populated cities like Jodhpur, which has a population numbering up to a million.

== Ecology and behavior ==

Gray langurs are diurnal. They sleep during the night in trees but also on man-made structures like towers and electric poles when in human settlements. When resting in trees, they generally prefer the highest branches.

Ungulates like bovine and deer will eat food dropped by foraging langurs. Langurs are preyed upon by leopards, dholes and tigers. Wolves, jackals, Asian black bears and pythons may also prey on langurs.

===Diet===

Gray langurs are primarily herbivores. However, unlike some other colobines they do not depend on leaves and leaf buds of herbs, but will also eat coniferous needles and cones, fruits and fruit buds, evergreen petioles, shoots and roots, seeds, grass, bamboo, fern rhizomes, mosses, and lichens. Leaves of trees and shrubs rank at the top of preferred food, followed by herbs and grasses. Non-plant material consumed include spider webs, termite mounds and insect larvae. They forage on agricultural crops and other human foods, and even accept handouts. Although they occasionally drink, langurs get most of their water from the moisture in their food.

===Social structure===

Gray langurs exist in three types of groups:
* one-male groups, comprising one adult male, several females and offspring;
* multiple-male groups, comprising males and females of all ages;
* all-male groups.
All-male groups tend to be the smallest of the groups and can consist of adults, subadults, and juveniles. Some populations have only multiple-male groups as mixed sex groups, while others have only one-male groups as mixed sexed groups.

Some evidence suggests multiple-male groups are temporary and exist only after a takeover, and subsequently split into one-male and all-male groups.

Social hierarchies exist for all group types. In all-male groups, dominance is attained through aggression and mating success. With sexually mature females, rank is based on physical condition and age. The younger the female, the higher the rank. Dominance rituals are most common among high-ranking langurs. Most changes in social rank in males take place during changes in group members. An adult male may remain in a one-male group for 45 months. The rate of male replacement can occur quickly or slowly depending on the group.

Females within a group are matrilineally related. Female memberships are also stable, but less so in larger groups. Relationships between the females tend to be friendly. They will do various activities with each together, such as foraging, traveling and resting. They will also groom each other regardless of their rank. However, higher-ranking females give out and receive grooming the most. In addition, females groom males more often than the other way around. Male and female relationships are usually positive. Relationships between males can range from peaceful to violent. While females remain in their natal groups, males will leave when they reach adulthood. Relationships between groups tend to be hostile. High-ranking males from different groups will display, vocalize, and fight among themselves.

===Reproduction and parenting===
In one-male groups, the resident male is usually the sole breeder of the females and sires all the young. In multiple-male groups, the highest-ranking male fathers most of the offspring, followed by the next-ranking males and even outside males will father young. Higher-ranking females are more reproductively successful than lower-ranking ones.

Female gray langurs do not make it obvious that they are in estrous. However, males are still somehow able to deduce the reproduction state of females. Females signal that they are ready to mate by shuddering the head, lowering the tail, and presenting their anogenital regions. Such solicitations do not always lead to copulation. When langurs mate, they are sometimes disrupted by other group members. Females have even been recorded mounting other females.

The gestation period of gray langur lasts around 200 days, at least at Jodhpur, India. In some areas, reproduction is year-around. Year-round reproduction appears to occur in populations that capitalize on human-made foods. Other populations have seasonal reproduction.
Infanticide is common among gray langurs. Most infanticidal langurs are males that have recently immigrated to a group and driven out the prior male. These males only kill infants that are not their own. Infanticide is more commonly reported in one-male groups, perhaps because one male monopolizing matings drives the evolution of this trait. In multiple-male groups, the costs for infanticidal males are likely to be high as the other males may protect the infants and they can&#x27;t ensure that they&#x27;ll sire young with other males around. Nevertheless, infanticide does occur in these groups, and is suggested that such practices serve to return a female to estrous and gain the opportunity to mate.

Females usually give birth to a single infant, although twins do occur. Most births occur during the night. Infants are born with thin, dark brown or black hair and pale skin. Infants spend their first week attached to their mothers&#x27; chests and mostly just suckle or sleep. They do not move much in terms of locomotion for the first two weeks of their life. As they approach their sixth week of life, infants vocalize more. They use squeaks and shrieks to communicate stress. In the following months, the infants are capable of quadrupedal locomotion and can walk, run and jump by the second and third months. Alloparenting occurs among langurs, starting when the infants reach two years of age. The infant will be given to the other females of the group. However, if the mother dies, the infant usually follows. Langurs are weaned by 13 months.

===Vocalizations===
Gray langurs are recorded to make a number of vocalizations:
*loud calls or whoops made only by adult males during displays;
*harsh barks made by adult and subadult males when surprised by a predator;
*cough barks made by adults and subadults during group movements;
*grunt barks made mostly by adult males during group movements and agonistic interactions;
*rumble screams made in agonistic interactions;
*pant barks made with loud calls when groups are interacting;
*grunts made in many different situations, usually in agonistic ones;
*honks made by adult males when groups are interacting;
*rumbles made during approaches, embraces, and mounts;
*hiccups made by most members of a group when they find another group.

==Status and conservation==
Gray langurs have stable populations in some areas and declining ones in others. Both the black-footed gray langur and Kashmir gray langur are considered threatened. The latter is the rarest species of gray langur, with less than 250 mature individuals remaining.

In India, gray langurs number at around 300,000. India has laws prohibiting the capturing or killing of langurs, but they are still hunted in some parts of the country. Enforcement of these laws has proven to be difficult and it seems most people are unaware of their protection. Populations are also threatened by mining, forest fires and deforestation for wood.

Langurs can be found near roads and can become victims of automobile accidents. This happens even in protected areas, with deaths by automobile collisions making nearly a quarter of mortality in Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary in Rajasthan, India. Langurs are considered sacred in the Hindu religion and are sometimes kept for religious purposes by Hindu priests and for roadside performances. However, some religious groups use langurs as food and medicine, and parts of gray langurs are sometimes kept as amulets for good luck.

Because of their sacred status and their less aggressive behavior compared to other primates, langurs are generally not considered pests in many parts of India. Despite this, research in some areas show high levels of support for the removal of langurs from villages, their sacred status no longer important. Langurs will raid crops and steal food from houses, and this causes people to persecute them. While people may feed them in temples, they do not extend such care to monkeys at their homes. Langurs stealing and biting people to get food in urban areas may also contribute to more persecutions.

<doc id="503856" wikidata="Q899347" url="?curid=503856" title="Lyocell">
<text>Lyocell is a semi-synthetic fiber used to make textiles for clothing and other purposes. It is a form of regenerated cellulose made by dissolving pulp and dry jet-wet spinning. Unlike rayon made by the more common viscose processes, Lyocell production does not use carbon disulfide, which is toxic to workers and the environment. Lyocell was originally trademarked as Tencel in 1982. 

&quot;Lyocell&quot; has become a genericized trademark, used to refer to the Lyocell process for making cellulose fibers. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission defines Lyocell as &quot;a fiber composed of cellulose precipitated from an organic solution in which no substitution of the hydroxy groups takes place, and no chemical intermediates are formed&quot;. It classifies the fiber as a sub-category of rayon. 

==Names==
Other trademarked names for Lyocell fibers are Tencel (Lenzing AG), Newcell (Akzo Nobel), and Seacell (Zimmer AG). The Aditya Birla Group also sells it under the brand name Excel.
There are other manufacturers like Sateri which sell their product under generic name Lyocell

==History==
The development of Tencel was motivated by environmental concerns; researchers sought to manufacture rayon by means less harmful than the viscose method.

The Lyocell process was developed in 1972 by a team at the now defunct American Enka fibers facility at Enka, North Carolina. In 2003, the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) awarded Neal E. Franks their Henry E. Millson Award for Invention for Lyocell. In 1966–1968, D. L. Johnson of Eastman Kodak Inc. studied NMMO solutions. From 1969 to 1979, American Enka tried unsuccessfully to commercialize the process. The operating name for the fiber inside the Enka organization was &quot;Newcell&quot;, and the development was carried through a pilot plant scale before the work was stopped. 

The basic process of dissolving cellulose in NMMO was first described in a 1981 patent by Mcorsley for Akzona Incorporated (the holding company of Akzo). In the 1980s the patent was licensed by Akzo to Courtaulds and Lenzing. 

The fiber was developed by Courtaulds Fibres under the brand name &quot;Tencel&quot; in the 1980s. In 1982, a 100-kg/week pilot plant was built in Coventry, UK, and production increased tenfold (to a ton/week) in 1984. In 1988, a 25-ton/week semi-commercial production line opened at the Grimsby, UK, pilot plant.

The process was first commercialized at Courtaulds&#x27; rayon factories at Mobile, Alabama (1990), and at the Grimsby plant (1998). In January 1993, the Mobile Tencel plant reached full production levels of 20,000 tons per year, by which time Courtaulds had spent £100 million and 10 years on Tencel development. Tencel revenues for 1993 were estimated as likely to be £50 million. The second plant in Mobile was planned. By 2004, production had quadrupled to 80,000 tons. 

Lenzing began a pilot plant in 1990, and commercial production in 1997, with 12 metric tonnes/year made in a plant in Heiligenkreuz im Lafnitztal, Austria. When an explosion hit the plant in 2003 it was producing 20,000 tonnes/year, and planning to double capacity by the end of the year. In 2004 Lenzing was producing 40,000 tons [&quot;sic&quot;, probably metric tonnes]. In 1998, Lenzing and Courtaulds reached a patent dispute settlement.

In 1998 Courtaulds was acquired by competitor Akzo Nobel, who combined the Tencel division with other fiber divisions under the Accordis banner, then sold them to private equity firm CVC Partners. In 2000, CVC sold the Tencel division to Lenzing AG, who combined it with their &quot;Lenzing Lyocell&quot; business, but maintained the brand name Tencel. They took over the plants in Mobile and Grimsby, and by 2015 was the largest Lyocell producer at 130,000 tonnes/year.

== Uses ==

It is used in many everyday fabrics. Staple fibers are used in clothes such as denim, chino, underwear, casual wear, and towels. Filament fibers, which are generally longer and smoother than staple fibers, are used in items that have a silkier appearance such as women&#x27;s clothing and men&#x27;s dress shirts. Lyocell may be blended with a variety of other fibers such as silk, cotton, rayon, polyester, linen, nylon, and wool. When mixed with other fibers, the resulting fabric is much stronger and more resistant to wear, tear, and pilling. Lyocell also is used in conveyor belts, specialty papers, and medical dressings.

== Properties ==

Lyocell shares many properties with other fibers such as cotton, linen, silk, ramie, hemp, and viscose rayon (to which it is very closely related chemically). Lyocell is 50% more absorbent than cotton, and has a longer wicking distance compared to modal fabrics of a similar weave. 

Compared to cotton, consumers often say Lyocell fibers feel softer and &quot;airier,&quot; due to their better ability to wick moisture. Industry claims of higher resistance to wrinkling are as yet unsupported. Lyocell fabric may be machine washed or dry cleaned. It drapes well and may be dyed many colors, needing slightly less dye than cotton to achieve the same depth of color. 

== Manufacturing process ==
The Lyocell process uses a direct solvent rather than indirect dissolution such as the xanthation-regeneration route in the viscose process. Lyocell fiber is produced from dissolving pulp, which contains cellulose in high purity with little hemicellulose and no lignin. Hardwood logs (such as oak and birch) are chipped into squares about the size of postage stamps. The chips are digested chemically, either with the prehydrolysis-kraft process or with sulfite process, to remove the lignin and hemicellulose. The pulp is bleached to remove the remaining traces of lignin, dried into a continuous sheet and rolled onto spools. The pulp has the consistency of thick posterboard paper and is delivered in rolls weighing some 500 lb (230 kg).
At the Lyocell mill, rolls of pulp are broken into one-inch squares and dissolved in &quot;N&quot;-methylmorpholine &quot;N&quot;-oxide (NMMO), giving a solution called &quot;dope&quot;. The filtered cellulose solution is then pumped through spinnerets, devices used with a variety of synthetic fibers. The spinneret is pierced with small holes rather like a shower head; when the solution is forced through it, continuous strands of filament come out. The fibers are drawn in air to align the cellulose molecules, giving the Lyocell fibers its characteristic high strength. The fibers are then immersed into a water bath, where desolvation of the cellulose sets the fiber strands. The bath contains some dilute amine oxide in a steady state concentration. Then the fibers are washed with demineralised water. Next, the Lyocell fiber passes to a drying area, where the water is evaporated from it.

Manufacture then follows the same route as with other kinds of fibers such as viscose. The strands pass to a finishing area, where a lubricant, which may be a soap or silicone or other agents, depending on the future use of the fiber, is applied. This step is a detangler, prior to carding and spinning into yarn. At this stage, the dried, finished fibers are in a form called tow, a large, untwisted bundle of continuous lengths of filament. The bundles of tow are taken to a crimper, a machine that compresses the fiber, giving it texture and bulk. The crimped fiber is then carded by mechanical carders, which perform a combing action to separate and order the strands. The carded strands are then cut and baled for shipment to a fabric mill. The entire manufacturing process, from unrolling the raw cellulose to baling the fiber, takes roughly two hours. After this, the Lyocell may be processed in many ways. It may be spun with another fiber, such as cotton or wool. The resulting yarn can be woven or knitted like any other fabric, and may be given a variety of finishes, from soft and suede-like to silky.

The amine oxide used to dissolve the cellulose and set the fiber after spinning (NMMO) is recycled. Typically, 99 percent of the amine oxide is recovered. NMMO biodegrades without producing harmful products. Since there is little waste product, this process is relatively eco-friendly, though it is energy-intensive.

=== Future research ===
Lyocell&#x27;s lack of antibacterial properties is limiting its uses in the medical field. Due to its biodegradability, low toxicity, and comfort, Lyocell would become a useful material for antibacterial garments. Several approaches have been tested to introduce antibacterial capabilities. Three general approaches have been studied to achieve this: physical blending, chemical reaction, and post-treatment. Physical blending methods introduce antibacterial agents into the spinning dope. In chemical reaction methods, antibacterial additives are crosslinked into the Lyocell fibers and therefore giving antimicrobial properties. In post-treatment methods, antibacterial additives are being deposited on Lyocell fiber surfaces through physical coating, padding, or impregnation processes. Physical blending and post-treatment methods appear to be the most promising for large-scale manufacturing. Careful consideration of cost, preparation time, and antibacterial effectiveness is required to select the best method. Creating successful modification of Lyocell fibers to enhance antibacterial properties would allow to manufacture products for health care (such as lab coats, caps, gowns), hygiene products (scrubs, sanitary napkins), and clothing (socks, underwear).

<doc id="503857" wikidata="Q35602" url="?curid=503857" title="Hawaiian Pidgin">
<text>Hawaiian Pidgin (alternately, Hawaiʻi Creole English or HCE, known locally as Pidgin) is an English-based creole language spoken in Hawaiʻi. An estimated 600,000 residents of Hawaii speak Hawaiian Pidgin natively and 400,000 speak it as a second language. Although English and Hawaiian are the two official languages of the state of Hawaiʻi, Hawaiian Pidgin is spoken by many residents of Hawaiʻi in everyday conversation and is often used in advertising targeted toward locals in Hawaiʻi. In the Hawaiian language, it is called ōlelo pai ai – &quot;hard taro language&quot;. Hawaiian Pidgin was first recognized as a language by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015. However, Hawaiian Pidgin is still thought of as lower status than the Hawaiian and English languages.

Despite its name, Hawaiian Pidgin is not a pidgin, but rather a full-fledged, nativized and demographically stable creole language. It did, however, evolve from various real pidgins spoken as common languages between ethnic groups in Hawaiʻi.

Although not completely mutually intelligible with Standard American English, Hawaiian Pidgin retains a high degree of mutual intelligibility with it compared to some other English-based creoles, such as Jamaican Patois, in part due to its relatively recent emergence. Some speakers of Hawaiian Pidgin tend to code switch between or mix the language with standard English. This has led to a distinction between pure &quot;heavy Pidgin&quot; and mixed &quot;light Pidgin&quot;.

==History==
Hawaiian Pidgin originated on sugarcane plantations in 1835 as a form of communication used between Hawaiian speaking Native Hawaiian residents, English speaking residents, and foreign immigrants. It supplanted, and was influenced by, the existing pidgin that Native Hawaiians already used on plantations and elsewhere in Hawaiʻi. Since such sugarcane plantations often hired workers from many different countries, a common language was needed in order for the plantation workers to communicate effectively with each other and their supervisors. Hawaiian Pidgin has been influenced by many different languages, including Portuguese, Hawaiian, American English, and Cantonese. As people of other backgrounds were brought in to work on the plantations, Hawaiian Pidgin acquired even more words from languages such as Japanese, Ilocano, Okinawan and Korean.

The article Japanese loanwords in Hawaii lists some of those words originally from Japanese. Hawaiian Pidgin has also been influenced to a lesser degree by Spanish spoken by Puerto Rican settlers in Hawaiʻi. As there were eventually more immigrant families who brought their children to the plantations, these children learned the language from their parents as well as English at school. Over time, a new pidgin language developed from all of the different language backgrounds which became many of the children&#x27;s first language. This was the origin of Hawaiian Pidgin, which was used and is still used by many Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian people who live there.

Hawaiian Pidgin was created mainly to provide communication and facilitate cooperation between the foreign laborers and the English-speaking Americans in order to do business on the plantations. Even today, Hawaiian Pidgin retains some influences from these languages. For example, the word in Hawaiian Pidgin has a form and use similar to the Hawaiian verb , Portuguese verb or Spanish &quot;, which mean &quot;to be&quot; but are used only when referring to a temporary state or location.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Hawaiian Pidgin started to be used outside the plantation between ethnic groups. In the 1980s, two educational programs were established which were taught in Hawaiian Pidgin to help students learn Standard English. Public school children learned Hawaiian Pidgin from their classmates and parents. Living in a community mixed with various cultures led to the daily usage of Hawaiian Pidgin, which caused the language to expand. It was easier for school children of different ethnic backgrounds to speak Hawaiian Pidgin than to learn another language. Children who grew up learning and speaking this language expanded Hawaiian Pidgin as it was their first language, or mother tongue. For this reason, linguists generally consider Hawaiian Pidgin to be a creole language.

Hawaiian Pidgin is said to have since been &quot;decreolized&quot; (Romaine, 1994), especially in Oahu, Hawaiʻi which holds the largest population of the islands. This is due to capitalism and economic changes on the islands that were implemented by the United States. Furthermore, tourism and technology have made the English language more utilized in Hawaii, which has led to the endangerment of Hawaiian Pidgin. Hawaiian Pidgin was also not taught in public education nor does it have its own writing system. Consequently, Hawaiian Pidgin was thought of as a &quot;low social status&quot; and is only a memory of the plantations that many want to forget. This brought upon racial discrimination to those who spoke the language, which excluded children from school who spoke Hawaiian Pidgin. Even though people were against Hawaiian Pidgin, the language has since been strengthened and supported by young people who honor Hawaiian Pidgin and its origins.

== Demographics and status ==
A five-year survey that the U.S. Census Bureau conducted in Hawaiʻi revealed that many people spoke Hawaiian Pidgin as an additional language. As a result of this, the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015 added Hawaiian Pidgin to the list of official languages in the state of Hawaiʻi.

In the last few decades, many residents of Hawaiʻi have moved to the US mainland due to economic issues. As a result, thousands of Pidgin speakers can be found in the other 49 states.

Historically, teachers and policymakers have debated whether growing up speaking Hawaiʻi Creole English hinders the learning of Standard English.

==Phonology==
Hawaiian Pidgin has distinct pronunciation differences from standard American English (SAE). Long vowels are not pronounced in Hawaiian Pidgin if the speaker is using Hawaiian loanwords. Some key differences include the following:

*Th-stopping: and are pronounced as or respectively—that is, changed from a fricative to a plosive (stop). For instance, &quot;think&quot; becomes , and &quot;that&quot; becomes . An example is &quot;Broke da mout&quot; (tasted good).
*L-vocalization: Word-final &quot;l&quot; is often pronounced or . For instance, &quot;mental&quot; is often pronounced ; &quot;people&quot; is pronounced [pipo].
* Hawaiian Pidgin is non-rhotic. That is, &quot;r&quot; after a vowel is often omitted, similar to many dialects, such as Eastern New England, Australian English, and British English variants. For instance, &quot;car&quot; is often pronounced &quot;cah&quot;, and &quot;letter&quot; is pronounced &quot;letta&quot;. Intrusive r is also used. The number of Hawaiian Pidgin speakers with rhotic English has also been increasing.
* Hawaiian Pidgin has falling intonation in questions. In yes/no questions, falling intonation is striking and appears to be a lasting imprint of Hawaiian (this pattern is not found in yes/no question intonation in American English). This particular falling intonation pattern is shared with some other Oceanic languages, including Fijian and Samoan (Murphy, K. 2013).
*In certain words, the sound /ts/ assimilates to /s/. Examples include: &quot;what&#x27;s&quot; becoming &quot;wass&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; becoming &quot;iss&quot; . This feature is also found in African-American Vernacular English.
Others include: , , and .

==Grammatical features==
Hawaiian Pidgin has distinct grammatical forms not found in SAE, although some of them are shared with other dialectal forms of English or may derive from other linguistic influences.

Forms used for SAE &quot;to be&quot;:
*Generally, forms of English &quot;to be&quot; (i.e. the copula) are omitted when referring to inherent qualities of an object or person, forming in essence a stative verb form. Additionally, inverted sentence order may be used for emphasis. (Many East Asian languages use stative verbs instead of the copula-adjective construction of English and other Western languages.)
: &quot;Da behbeh cute.&quot; (or) &quot;Cute, da behbeh.&quot;
: The baby is cute.

These constructions also mimic the grammar of the Hawaiian language. In Hawaiian, &quot;nani ka pēpē&quot; is literally &quot;beautiful the baby&quot; retaining that specific syntactic form, and is perfectly correct Hawaiian grammar with equivalent meaning in English, &quot;The baby is beautiful.&quot;

*When the verb &quot;to be&quot; refers to a temporary state or location, the word &quot;stay&quot; is used (see above). This may be influenced by other Pacific creoles, which use the word &quot;stap&quot;, from &quot;stop&quot;, to denote a temporary state or location. In fact, &quot;stop&quot; was used in Hawaiian Pidgin earlier in its history, and may have been dropped in favor of &quot;stay&quot; due to influence from Portuguese &quot;estar&quot; or &quot;ficar&quot; (ficar is literally translated to English as &#x27;to stay&#x27;, but often used in place of &quot;to be&quot; e.g. &quot;ele fica feliz&quot; &quot;he is happy&quot;).

: &quot;Da book stay on top da table.&quot;
: The book is on the table.

: &quot;Da watah stay cold.&quot;
: The water is cold.

For tense-marking of verb, auxiliary verbs are employed:
* To express past tense, Hawaiian Pidgin uses &quot;wen&quot; (went) before the infinitive form of the modified verb.
: &quot;Jesus wen cry.&quot; (&quot;Da Jesus Book&quot;, John 11:35)
: Jesus cried.

* To express future tense, Hawaiian Pidgin uses &quot;goin&quot; (going), derived from the going-to future common in informal varieties of American English.
: &quot;God goin do plenny good kine stuff fo him.&quot; (&quot;Da Jesus Book&quot;, Mark 11:9)
: God is going to do a lot of good things for him.

* To express past tense negative, Hawaiian Pidgin uses &quot;neva&quot; (never). &quot;Neva&quot; can also mean &quot;never&quot; as in Standard English usage; context sometimes, but not always, makes the meaning clear.
: &quot;He neva like dat.&quot;
: He didn&#x27;t want that. (or) He never wanted that. (or) He didn&#x27;t like that.

* Use of &quot;fo&quot; (for) in place of the infinitive particle &quot;to&quot;. Cf. dialectal form &quot;Going for carry me home.&quot;
: &quot;I tryin fo tink.&quot; (or) &quot;I try fo tink.&quot;
: I&#x27;m trying to think.
== Regional varieties ==
The grammar and vocabulary of Hawaiian Pidgin is largely uniform though there are slight changes depending on the region it’s spoken in.

For instance, while standard Pidgin uses “wen” as a past tense verb marker, Kauai speakers are more likely to use “had”.
:&quot;She had go awready.&quot; (Kauai)
:&quot;She wen go awready.&quot; (Standard)
:She went already.
Another example is shave ice being “ice shave” on the Big Island.

==Sociolinguistics==
The language is highly stigmatized in formal settings, for which American English or the Hawaiian language are preferred. Many researchers believe the continued delegitimization of this creole is rooted in the language’s origin story and colonial past, as it was once a plantation language. Therefore, its usage is typically reserved for everyday casual conversations. Studies have proven that children in kindergarten preferred Hawaiian Pidgin, but once they were in grade one and more socially conditioned they preferred Standard English. Hawaiian Pidgin is often criticized in business, educational, family, social, and community situations as it might be construed as rude, crude, or broken English among some Standard English speakers. However, many tourists find Hawaiian Pidgin appealing – and local travel companies favor those who speak Hawaiian Pidgin and hire them as speakers or customer service agents.

Most linguists categorize Hawaiian Pidgin as a creole, as a creole refers to the linguistic form &quot;spoken by the native-born children of pidgin-speaking parents&quot;. However, many locals view Hawaiian Pidgin as a dialect. Other linguists argue that this &quot;standard&quot; form of the language is also a dialect. Based on this definition, a language is primarily the &quot;standard&quot; form of the language, but also an umbrella term used to encapsulate the &quot;inferior&quot; dialects of that language.

The Pidgin Coup, a group of Hawaiian Pidgin advocates, claims that Hawaiian Pidgin should be classified as a language. The group believes that the only reason it is not considered a language is due to the hegemony of English. &quot;Due to the hegemony of English, a lack of equal status between these two languages can only mean a scenario in which the non-dominant language is relatively marginalized. Marginalization occurs when people hold the commonplace view that HCE and English differ in being appropriate for different purposes and different situations. It is this concept of &#x27;appropriateness&#x27; which is a form of prescriptivism; a newer, more subtle form.&quot; These Hawaiian Pidgin advocates believe that by claiming there are only certain, less public contexts in which Hawaiian Pidgin is only appropriate, rather than explicitly stating that Hawaiian Pidgin is lesser than Standard English, masks the issue of refusing to recognize Hawaiian Pidgin as a legitimate language. In contrast, other researchers have found that many believe that, since Hawaiian Pidgin does not have a standardized writing form, it cannot be classified as a language. Many linguists argue for the need to destigmatize Pidgin. One way to do so, linguists argue, includes the use of Pidgin in the classroom.

==Literature and performing arts==
In recent years, writers from Hawaiʻi such as Lois-Ann Yamanaka, Joe Balaz, and Lee Tonouchi have written poems, short stories, and other works in Hawaiian Pidgin. A Hawaiian Pidgin translation of The Bible (called &quot;Da Good an Spesho Book&quot;) has also been created, in 2020, by Wycliffe Bible Translators, Inc. Also an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night, or What You Will&quot;, titled in Hawaiian Pidgin &quot;twelf nite o&#x27; WATEVA!&quot;

Several theater companies in Hawaii produce plays written and performed in Hawaiian Pidgin. The most notable of these companies is Kumu Kahua Theater.

The 1987 film &quot;North Shore&quot; contains several characters, particularly the surfing gang Da Hui, that speak Hawaiian Pidgin. This leads to humorous misunderstandings between the haole protagonist Rick Kane and several Hawaiian locals, including Rick&#x27;s best friend Turtle, who speaks Hawaiian Pidgin.

Hawaiian Pidgin has occasionally been featured on &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; as the protagonists frequently interact with locals. A recurring character, Kamekona Tupuola (portrayed by Taylor Wiley), speaks Hawaiian Pidgin. The show frequently displays Hawaiian culture and is filmed at Hawaii locations.

Another film that features Hawaiian Pidgin is Netflix’s &quot;Finding ‘Ohana&quot;, a film that depicts the story of a brother and sister duo from Brooklyn who embark on a journey to reconnect with their Hawaiian heritage, this includes learning about Hawaiian Pidgin, as it was integral to their family history.

Milton Murayama&#x27;s novel &quot;All I asking for is my body&quot; uses Hawaiʻi Pidgin in the title of the novel. R. Zamora Linmark employs it extensively in his semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Rolling the R&#x27;s&quot;; two of the major characters speak predominately in Pidgin and some chapters are narrated in it. The novel also includes examples of Taglish.

Two books, &quot;Pidgin to Da Max&quot; and &quot;Pidgin to Da Max: Hana Hou&quot;, humorously portray Hawaiian Pidgin through prose and illustrations.

As of March 2008, Hawaiian Pidgin has started to become more popular in local television advertisements as well as other media. When Hawaiian Pidgin is used in advertisements, it is often changed to better fit the targeted audience of the &quot;kamaāina.&quot;

<text>Stalingrad () is a Paris Métro station on the border between the 10th arrondissement and 19th arrondissement at the intersection of Lines 2, 5 and 7, located at the Place de la Bataille-de-Stalingrad, which is named after the Battle of Stalingrad.

==History==
The Line 2 station opened as &quot;Rue d&#x27;Aubervilliers&quot;, named after a nearby street, on 31 January 1903 as part of the extension of line 2 from Anvers to &quot;Bagnolet&quot; (now called Alexandre Dumas). On 5 November 1910, a separate underground station was opened as part of the first section of line 7 between &quot;Opéra&quot; and Porte de la Villette a short distance away in the &quot;Boulevard de la Villette&quot; and named after it.

In 1942, the two stations combined to form &quot;Aubervilliers – Boulevard de la Villette&quot;. The line 5 opened its corresponding station on 12 October 1942 as part of its extension from Gare du Nord to Église de Pantin. In 1946, the section of the &quot;Boulevard de la Villette&quot; near the station was named the Place de Stalingrad in honour of the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad and the station&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Stalingrad&quot; at the same time.

The location remained unchanged until line extensions resumed: Line 7 was extended from Porte de la Villette to Fort d&#x27;Aubervilliers in 1979 and La Courneuve – 8 mai 1945 in 1987; a branch was created in the south in 1982 to Le Kremlin-Bicêtre and Villejuif – Louis Aragon in 1985. Line 5 was extended to Bobigny – Pablo Picasso the same year.

The platforms on Line 7 were chosen to be the prototype of &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style installation, which were completed in December 1988 before being introduced to twenty other stations being renovated.

In 2018, it saw 7,342,659 travelers enter the station, which places it at the 38th position of metro stations for its attendance.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
 The stations of the three lines are of a standard configuration with two platforms separated by the railway lines. The platforms of Line 2 are above-ground, located on a viaduct, while those of Lines 5 and 7 are underground, under an elliptical arch. Line 2 platforms are equipped with glass awnings, as are all above-ground stations on the line. Lighting is achieved through white neon lighting tubes. The steel pillars and spandrels incorporate ground glass windows which sit atop white and flat ceramic tiles. The platforms, devoid of advertising, are equipped with white &quot;Motte&quot; style benches and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates.

The platforms of Line 5 are arranged in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style blue colour: they have two lighting strips in this shade, as well as seating and spandrels covered with flat tiling of the same hue. They are equipped with &quot;Motte&quot; blue and white seats. This decoration is married with the white bevelled tiling which covers the walls, vault, and the outlets of the corridors. The name of the station is inscribed in faience in the original CMP style. The advertising frames are special: in brown faience and with simple patterns, they are surmounted by the letter &quot;M&quot;. These same frames are only present in seven other Paris metro stations.

The platforms of Line 7 are laid out in the &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style blue colour: the two lighting strips of the same colour, are supported by curved shaped false consoles. The direct lighting is white, while unlike most bands of this style, there is no multi-coloured indirect lighting present yet. The flat white ceramic tiles cover the walls, vault, and the tunnel exits but not the outlets of the corridors which are covered with white bevelled tiles, this last point also constituting an exception to the &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style. The name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates and the &quot;Motte&quot; seating is blue. Advertising frames are metallic instead of the blue half-circle, which is another exception to the &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by Lines 48 and 54 of the RATP bus network and at night, by Lines N13, N41, N42 and N45 of the Noctilien bus network.

==Nearby attractions==
Nearby are the &quot;Rotonde de la Villette&quot; (part of the &quot;Barrière Saint-Martin&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General between 1784 and 1788), the Bassin de la Villette (an artificial lake) and the Canal Saint-Martin.

<text>Jaurès () is a station on Paris Métro line 2, line 5, and line 7bis in the 10th and 19th arrondissements.

==History==

The station was opened on 23 February 1903, three weeks after line 2 was extended from Anvers to &quot;Bagnolet&quot; (now Alexandre Dumas) on 31 January 1903. Line 7bis platforms opened on 18 January 1911 as part of the first section of line 7 between Opéra and Porte de la Villette, more than two months after the opening of the line on 5 November 1910. Line 5 platforms opened on 12 October 1942 with the opening of the first section of the line between Gare du Nord and Église de Pantin. On 3 December 1967 the branch to Pré Saint-Gervais was separated as 7bis with the new service terminating at Louis Blanc.

The station was originally called &quot;Rue d&#x27;Allemagne&quot; (&quot;Street of Germany&quot;). On 1 August 1914, just before the outbreak of World War I, the name of the street and the station were changed to &quot;Jaurès&quot; as a result of the rising tensions with Germany, a day after the assassination of Jean Jaurès (1859–1914). Boulogne–Jean Jaurès on line 10 is also named in honour of him. The station &quot;Berlin&quot; on line 13 was also renamed to Liège for similar reasons.

As part of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised in 2014.

In 2019, the station was used by 5,836,196 passengers, making it the 64th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 3,148,221 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 54th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 4,055,461 passengers, making it the 52nd busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

==Passenger services==
=== Access ===
The station has six accesses:

* Access 1: Boulevard de la Villette
* Access 2: Quai de la Loire
* Access 3: avenue Jean Jaurès
* Access 4: avenue Secrétan
* Access 5: Quai de Jemmapes
* Access 6: rue de Chaumont

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The stations of consisting three lines are of a standard configuration with two platforms separated by the railway track, with the platforms for line 2 being elevated and the rest underground. Line 2 platforms are equipped with glass awnings, as are all elevated stations on the line. The steel pillars and tunnel exits incorporate stained glass windows which sit atop white and flat ceramic tiles. On the platform in the direction of Nation, part of the glass supports a stained glass work consisting of abstract patterns, dominated by the blue-white-red French flag, depicting the crowd that seized the Bastille prison on 14 July 1789, which is represented in white in the centre of the work. Created in 1989 by the visual artist Jacques-Antoine Ducatez, it is visible both from the inside and outside the station. The presence of this window in this station is explained by the proximity of the quays of Valmy and Jemappes, whom reference two decisive victories of the revolutionary wars following the overthrow of the French Monarchy. The stained glass also pays tribute to the pacifist Jean Jaurès. At the corner of the canopy and the piers, ivies were planted in 2017 by &quot;Les Jardins de Babylone&quot; as part of the revegetation of RATP spaces.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 26 and 48 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by lines N13, N41, N42, and N45 of the Noctilien bus network.
